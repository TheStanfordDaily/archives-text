The top-ranked women's vol
leyball team did a little bit of hunt
ing at Maples Pavilion this week
end as it routed the Oregon Ducks
and the Oregon State Beavers to
run its record to 20-0 and 12-0 in
the Pacific 10 Conference.
On Friday night, it took the
Cardinal women just an hour and
27 minutes to defeat the Ducks in
three straight games, 15-6, 15-10,
and 15-12.
With an early 10-1 lead in the
first game, the Stanford women
seemed to be easily rolling over
their opponent, as they have done
in most matches this year. The
Cardinal took a harsh blow, howev
er, when freshman setter Lisa
Sharpley, who is second on the
team in assists, came down on an
Oregon player's foot and rolled her
ankle. Sharpley walked off the
court but was unable to return for
the rest of the match. She was diag
nosed with a sprained ankle.
Despite the injury to Sharpley,
head coach Don Shaw stayed with
the six-attacker formation and
subbed in sophomore Catherine
Juillard to fill Sharpley's role.
Following the injury the team
slowed down a notch, but Shaw
saw the difference as something to
be expected.
"[After the injury] it took us a

while to adjust to that," said the
coach. "We opted to bring Juillard
and let her set in the back row. It
wasn't Catherine's fault, we just
had a little trouble getting into a
rhythm."
In games two and three the
team played a bit out of synch, but
never placed itself in any danger

of losing the match, due in large
part to the play of junior Marnie
Triefenbach and freshman
Kristin Folkl.
Triefenbach finished the night
with 16 kills and a .448 hitting
percentage. Folkl took care of the
Ducks from the service line, as she
delivered five aces.
Junior Cary Wendell also
helped the Cardinal both offen
sively and defensively with 28
assists, two short of her career
high, and eight digs.

"We ended up just battling to
keep things going and played well
enough to win," Shaw said.
On Saturday night, a Stanford
team minus Sharpley disposed of
the Beavers with relative ease.
Behind the outstanding attack of
Triefenbach, the team prevailed
in three straight games, 15-3, 15-
5, 15-6.
After dominating in game one,
Stanford let up a bit in game two.
However, after the Cardinal failed
to convert on several straight

points, Triefenbach finally took
over. In game two alone she gar
nered 12 kills in 19 attempts, and
did not commit a single hitting
error.
"I was really happy with my
hitting percentage," Triefen
bach said. "Early in the season I
was struggling with my hitting
percentage but now I'm trying to
be smarter and keep balls in
play."
Coach Shaw was quick to praise
Triefenbach, who finished with 22

kills and only two hitting errors.
"She's just been playing great,"
the coach said. "She's getting
more comfortable out there and
she's hitting with a lot more confi
dence."
Wendell topped her Friday
night performance with a game
against the Beavers marked one of
the finest of her career. She fin
ished with a career-high 48
assists. Wendell also played solid
defense, recording 10 digs.
The Cardinal women look to

keep their record intact next
weekend as they travel to Los
Angeles to take on third-ranked
UCLA and llth-ranked USC.
Sharpley is listed as day-to-day,
but is expected to play next week
end. Whether she makes the trip
or not, Shaw remains confident in
his team's abilities.
"I know it's going to be tough,"
Shaw said. "[UCLA and USC] are
always tough to play down there,
but I feel pretty good, especially
after [Saturday's] performance."
