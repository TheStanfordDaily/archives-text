## 31-30 loss to Bruins ends any post-season chances 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Stanford 30
UCLA 31

For the third time this year, Stanford came up
on the wrong end of a game-winning field goal.
After tying Northwestern 41-41 on a missed
Eric Abrams kick and losing 36-35 to Arizona State
on a last-second field goal by the Sun Devils, the
Cardinal (2-5-1, 1-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
was prepared to buck that trend against UCLA (3-
6, 1-5) Saturday night as it lined up for a 32-yard
attempt with 20 seconds left in the game. However,
Abrams' kick sailed straight against the cold night
sky, flying a foot outside the left goal post, giving
the Bruins a 31-30 victory.
"It was better hit than the three that I made,"
said Abrams, referring to his 26-, 21- and 22-yard
field goals earlier in the game. "I knew for about
three-and-a-half minutes that it was going to come
down to me and I was looking forward to it."
Stanford appeared poised to end the game in sto
rybook fashion. After taking over at its own 35-yard
line with three minutes left, two incomplete passes
and a sack left the Cardinal facing a fourth-and-17
from the 28. A 23-yard bullet from senior quarter
back Steve Stenstrom to senior wide receiver Justin
Armour on a play they devised during halftime
moved the chains and kept Stanford's hopes alive.
"I thought it was a done deal at that point,"
Stenstrom said. "You kind of feel in those situa
tions it was sort of meant to be. Fourth-and-17, you
don't convert that many times in your career."
Armour had similar feelings about the miracu
lous fourth down conversion.
"We did exactly what we wanted to do," he said.
"That's how you write it up, how you dream it will
work."
Three more passes moved the Cardinal down to
the UCLA 19-yard line with 40 seconds to go.
Another sack forced Stanford to burn its final time
out, and then two short out-routes to senior flanker
David Shaw advanced the ball to the 15, in perfect
position for Abrams' game-winning attempt.
"We were definitely in a field goal mode at that

point," Stenstrom said. "[On the
sack] everybody was headed toward
the endzone on an all-go pattern.
After that, we couldn't afford to
throw the ball in bounds because we
had no timeouts left. But you can't
count on the sure thing, like we've
found out this year."
Lining up on the left hash mark
(Abrams' preferred side), the kick
followed the hash mark straight
toward the goal post, according to
holder Aaron Mills.
"The snap was good, the hold
was down and the kick sounded
great," Mills said. "It was going to
be one of those matter-of-inches
kicks. It was a dead-straight ball. If
it would have been five yards
longer, it would've made it."
For all its last-second heroics,
Stanford actually had numerous
chances to put the game out of
reach. Three first downs inside the
Bruin 10-yard line all resulted in
field goals, allowing UCLA to stay
in the game.
"We misfired just enough to
only kick field goals," head coach
Bill Walsh said. "There were any
number of plays that a touchdown
would have won the game, but we
didn't get it done."
The Bruins took the lead at 31-
30 late in the fourth quarter. Gain
ing possession after Stanford's only
three-and-out series of the game,
UCLA marched 71 yards in five
minutes, 18 seconds. Halfback Skip
Hicks exploded through the middle
of the Cardinal defense to score
from seven yards out. Quarterback
Wayne Cook then found 6-foot-6
wide receiver J.J. Stokes on a tim
ing pattern for the two-point con
version, as Stokes out-jumped 5-9
comerback Leroy Pruitt.
"We had [Stokes] double-cov
ered so they called timeout," Walsh
said. "That was our blunder, we
should have double-covered him
again. They were ready to push the
ball to that side, but we didn't han
dle that well."
The dramatic finish highlighted
a game that seemed ready to shat
ter every offensive record after the
first half. With Stanford ahead 24-
20 at halftime, the two teams had
already combined for 624 total
yards. As the final whistle sounded,
the teams had combined for 1,008
total yards.
Stenstrom once again put
together a tremendous perfor

mance, completing 28-of-45 passes
for a career-high 408 yards and two
touchdowns. He also became only
the 10th player in NCAA history to
throw for over 10,000 career yards.
For the third straight game,
Stenstrom sought out Armour as
his favorite receiver, who collected
11 passes for 220 yards, both career
highs, and one touchdown. Sopho
more Brian Manning caught five
passes for 87 yards, including a per
fect diving catch at the goal line,
good for a 35-yard touchdown.
However, UCLA countered
everything the Cardinal could
muster offensively, as Cook went
19-for-25 for 296 yards and two
touchdowns. Flanker Kevin Jordan
did the most damage to the Stan
ford secondary, catching eight balls
for 146 yards. Stokes added five
catches for 94 yards and also hauled
in the key two-point conversion.
Even with these astronomic
passing numbers, each team still
found time to run the ball. Fresh
man Anthony Bookman led all rush
ers with 21 carries for 138 yards and
one touchdown, including a 70-yard
blast in the second quarter. This
marked the first time a true fresh
man broke the 100-yard barrier for
Stanford since Darrin Nelson in
1977. Sharmon Shah led the Bruins
with 110 yards on 18 carries.
However, the Cardinal's inabili
ty to give Bookman and senior full
back Ethan Allen enough rest due
to an injury-riddled backfield hurt
Stanford during its goal line situa
tions in the second half.
"Our backs were tired and we
were very thin and we couldn't run
the ball effectively at that point,"
Walsh said.
Several key mistakes at crucial
moments kept the Cardinal from
blowing out the Bruins. A false
start penalty forced Abrams to kick
a 27-yard field goal in the first
quarter, and then Stenstrom's foot
was stepped on by an offensive line
men on third-and-goal in the third
quarter, bringing Abrams in for a
21-yard kick.
On that goal line series, it
appeared as if Bookman had bro
ken the plane of the goal line, but
the ball was placed on the one-foot
line.
"I thought I was in, but as soon
as I crossed the plane they pushed
me back," Bookman said. "It was
just one of those calls that could go
either way."
Even the Stanford defense saw
several chances to put the game
away. Junior linebacker Jason
White put pressure on Cook all day

and recorded two sacks, but failed
to wrap up the Bruin quarterback
on two key UCLA drives.
On the Bruins' final scoring
drive, the Cardinal had two chances
to stop UCLA on third-and-18.
Cook got away from a charging
White and sent a pass 20 yards
downfield to Jordan. It appeared as
if Stanford's secondary caused a
fumble or at least an incompletion,
but Jordan was ruled down at the
41, good for a first down.
"Our defense is very porous and
we're very disappointed with some
facets of it," Walsh said. "But the
heart was there, they worked hard
and played as hard as they possibly
could. It's been that way every
game."
The defense forced two impor
tant fumbles in the third quarter,
but the offense only translated
those turnovers into six points.
"The defense gave us some big
turnovers in the beginning of the
second half and we just didn't capi
talize on them," Armour said.
"When they give us gifts like that, we
have to turn them into something."
Now mathematically eliminated
from post-season bowl action, Stan
ford again looks to redefine its goals
for the remaining three games.
"We're going to have to dig down
deep and see if we can finish the
season 5-5-1," Stenstrom said. "We
got three games and there's no
chance for a fourth one anymore."
Stanford was reminded of the
place of football in the grand
scheme of things as sophomore cor
nerback Eliel Swinton rejoined the
team after spending the week with
his family and his fiancee's family
in Los Angeles following her tragic
death two weeks ago. Seeing his
teammates for the first time in a
week, Swinton greeted each defen
sive back with a mighty bearhug
when he came out on the field.
"Just to see the guys again, it
made me feel happy," Swinton said.
Forced out of action with a quadri
cep injury, he is now fighting to get
back into playing shape.
"I'm trying to get back on the
field, that's what my girlfriend
would want me to do — get back
on the field as fast as I can," he
said. "It just makes me want to
play that much more. I have to
find something to keep my mind
off everything. It's strange, really
strange.
"They're thinking about moving
me back to strong safety, so I'm
just going to have a field day there.
Next week, I'm playing, no matter
what."

moved the chains and kept Stanford's hopes alive.
"I thought it was a done deal at that point,"
Stenstrom said. "You kind of feel in those situa
tions it was sort of meant to be. Fourth-and-17, you
don't convert that many times in your career."
Armour had similar feelings about the miracu
lous fourth down conversion.
"We did exactly what we wanted to do," he said.
"That's how you write it up, how you dream it will
work."
Three more passes moved the Cardinal down to
the UCLA 19-yard line with 40 seconds to go.
Another sack forced Stanford to burn its final time
out, and then two short out-routes to senior flanker
David Shaw advanced the ball to the 15, in perfect
position for Abrams' game-winning attempt.

point," Stenstrom said. "[On the
sack] everybody was headed toward
the endzone on an all-go pattern.
After that, we couldn't afford to
throw the ball in bounds because we
had no timeouts left. But you can't
count on the sure thing, like we've
found out this year."
Lining up on the left hash mark
(Abrams' preferred side), the kick
followed the hash mark straight
toward the goal post, according to
holder Aaron Mills.
"The snap was good, the hold
was down and the kick sounded
great," Mills said. "It was going to
be one of those matter-of-inches
kicks. It was a dead-straight ball. If
it would have been five yards
longer, it would've made it."
For all its last-second heroics,
Stanford actually had numerous
chances to put the game out of
reach. Three first downs inside the
Bruin 10-yard line all resulted in
field goals, allowing UCLA to stay
in the game.
"We misfired just enough to
only kick field goals," head coach
Bill Walsh said. "There were any
number of plays that a touchdown
would have won the game, but we
didn't get it done."
The Bruins took the lead at 31-
30 late in the fourth quarter. Gain
ing possession after Stanford's only
three-and-out series of the game,
UCLA marched 71 yards in five
minutes, 18 seconds. Halfback Skip
Hicks exploded through the middle
of the Cardinal defense to score
from seven yards out. Quarterback
Wayne Cook then found 6-foot-6
wide receiver J.J. Stokes on a tim
ing pattern for the two-point con
version, as Stokes out-jumped 5-9
comerback Leroy Pruitt.
"We had [Stokes] double-cov
ered so they called timeout," Walsh
said. "That was our blunder, we
should have double-covered him
again. They were ready to push the
ball to that side, but we didn't han
dle that well."
The dramatic finish highlighted
a game that seemed ready to shat
ter every offensive record after the
first half. With Stanford ahead 24-
20 at halftime, the two teams had
already combined for 624 total
yards. As the final whistle sounded,
the teams had combined for 1,008
total yards.
Stenstrom once again put
together a tremendous perfor

mance, completing 28-of-45 passes
for a career-high 408 yards and two
touchdowns. He also became only
the 10th player in NCAA history to
throw for over 10,000 career yards.
For the third straight game,
Stenstrom sought out Armour as
his favorite receiver, who collected
11 passes for 220 yards, both career
highs, and one touchdown. Sopho
more Brian Manning caught five
passes for 87 yards, including a per
fect diving catch at the goal line,
good for a 35-yard touchdown.
However, UCLA countered
everything the Cardinal could
muster offensively, as Cook went
19-for-25 for 296 yards and two
touchdowns. Flanker Kevin Jordan
did the most damage to the Stan
ford secondary, catching eight balls
for 146 yards. Stokes added five
catches for 94 yards and also hauled
in the key two-point conversion.
Even with these astronomic
passing numbers, each team still
found time to run the ball. Fresh
man Anthony Bookman led all rush
ers with 21 carries for 138 yards and
one touchdown, including a 70-yard
blast in the second quarter. This
marked the first time a true fresh
man broke the 100-yard barrier for
Stanford since Darrin Nelson in
1977. Sharmon Shah led the Bruins
with 110 yards on 18 carries.
However, the Cardinal's inabili
ty to give Bookman and senior full
back Ethan Allen enough rest due
to an injury-riddled backfield hurt
Stanford during its goal line situa
tions in the second half.
"Our backs were tired and we
were very thin and we couldn't run
the ball effectively at that point,"
Walsh said.
Several key mistakes at crucial
moments kept the Cardinal from
blowing out the Bruins. A false
start penalty forced Abrams to kick
a 27-yard field goal in the first
quarter, and then Stenstrom's foot
was stepped on by an offensive line
men on third-and-goal in the third
quarter, bringing Abrams in for a
21-yard kick.
On that goal line series, it
appeared as if Bookman had bro
ken the plane of the goal line, but
the ball was placed on the one-foot
line.
"I thought I was in, but as soon
as I crossed the plane they pushed
me back," Bookman said. "It was
just one of those calls that could go
either way."
Even the Stanford defense saw
several chances to put the game
away. Junior linebacker Jason
White put pressure on Cook all day

and recorded two sacks, but failed
to wrap up the Bruin quarterback
on two key UCLA drives.
On the Bruins' final scoring
drive, the Cardinal had two chances
to stop UCLA on third-and-18.
Cook got away from a charging
White and sent a pass 20 yards
downfield to Jordan. It appeared as
if Stanford's secondary caused a
fumble or at least an incompletion,
but Jordan was ruled down at the
41, good for a first down.
"Our defense is very porous and
we're very disappointed with some
facets of it," Walsh said. "But the
heart was there, they worked hard
and played as hard as they possibly
could. It's been that way every
game."
The defense forced two impor
tant fumbles in the third quarter,
but the offense only translated
those turnovers into six points.
"The defense gave us some big
turnovers in the beginning of the
second half and we just didn't capi
talize on them," Armour said.
"When they give us gifts like that, we
have to turn them into something."
Now mathematically eliminated
from post-season bowl action, Stan
ford again looks to redefine its goals
for the remaining three games.
"We're going to have to dig down
deep and see if we can finish the
season 5-5-1," Stenstrom said. "We
got three games and there's no
chance for a fourth one anymore."
Stanford was reminded of the
place of football in the grand
scheme of things as sophomore cor
nerback Eliel Swinton rejoined the
team after spending the week with
his family and his fiancee's family
in Los Angeles following her tragic
death two weeks ago. Seeing his
teammates for the first time in a
week, Swinton greeted each defen
sive back with a mighty bearhug
when he came out on the field.
"Just to see the guys again, it
made me feel happy," Swinton said.
Forced out of action with a quadri
cep injury, he is now fighting to get
back into playing shape.
"I'm trying to get back on the
field, that's what my girlfriend
would want me to do — get back
on the field as fast as I can," he
said. "It just makes me want to
play that much more. I have to
find something to keep my mind
off everything. It's strange, really
strange.
"They're thinking about moving
me back to strong safety, so I'm
just going to have a field day there.
Next week, I'm playing, no matter
what."
Stanford 30
UCLA 31

For the third time this year, Stanford came up
on the wrong end of a game-winning field goal.
After tying Northwestern 41-41 on a missed
Eric Abrams kick and losing 36-35 to Arizona State
on a last-second field goal by the Sun Devils, the
Cardinal (2-5-1, 1-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
was prepared to buck that trend against UCLA (3-
6, 1-5) Saturday night as it lined up for a 32-yard
attempt with 20 seconds left in the game. However,
Abrams' kick sailed straight against the cold night
sky, flying a foot outside the left goal post, giving
the Bruins a 31-30 victory.
"It was better hit than the three that I made,"
said Abrams, referring to his 26-, 21- and 22-yard
field goals earlier in the game. "I knew for about
three-and-a-half minutes that it was going to come
down to me and I was looking forward to it."
Stanford appeared poised to end the game in sto
rybook fashion. After taking over at its own 35-yard
line with three minutes left, two incomplete passes
and a sack left the Cardinal facing a fourth-and-17
from the 28. A 23-yard bullet from senior quarter
back Steve Stenstrom to senior wide receiver Justin
Armour on a play they devised during halftime
moved the chains and kept Stanford's hopes alive.
"I thought it was a done deal at that point,"
Stenstrom said. "You kind of feel in those situa

"The snap was good, the hold
was down and the kick sounded
great," Mills said. "It was going to
be one of those matter-of-inches
kicks. It was a dead-straight ball. If
it would have been five yards
longer, it would've made it."
For all its last-second heroics,
Stanford actually had numerous
chances to put the game out of
reach. Three first downs inside the
Bruin 10-yard line all resulted in
field goals, allowing UCLA to stay
in the game.
"We misfired just enough to
only kick field goals," head coach
Bill Walsh said. "There were any
number of plays that a touchdown
would have won the game, but we
didn't get it done."
The Bruins took the lead at 31-
30 late in the fourth quarter. Gain
ing possession after Stanford's only
three-and-out series of the game,
UCLA marched 71 yards in five
minutes, 18 seconds. Halfback Skip
Hicks exploded through the middle
of the Cardinal defense to score
from seven yards out. Quarterback
Wayne Cook then found 6-foot-6
wide receiver J.J. Stokes on a tim
ing pattern for the two-point con
version, as Stokes out-jumped 5-9
comerback Leroy Pruitt.
"We had [Stokes] double-cov
ered so they called timeout," Walsh
said. "That was our blunder, we
should have double-covered him
again. They were ready to push the
ball to that side, but we didn't han
dle that well."
The dramatic finish highlighted
a game that seemed ready to shat
ter every offensive record after the
first half. With Stanford ahead 24-
20 at halftime, the two teams had
already combined for 624 total
yards. As the final whistle sounded,
the teams had combined for 1,008
total yards.
Stenstrom once again put
together a tremendous perfor

mance, completing 28-of-45 passes
for a career-high 408 yards and two
touchdowns. He also became only
the 10th player in NCAA history to
throw for over 10,000 career yards.
For the third straight game,
Stenstrom sought out Armour as
his favorite receiver, who collected
11 passes for 220 yards, both career
highs, and one touchdown. Sopho
more Brian Manning caught five
passes for 87 yards, including a per
fect diving catch at the goal line,
good for a 35-yard touchdown.
However, UCLA countered
everything the Cardinal could
muster offensively, as Cook went
19-for-25 for 296 yards and two
touchdowns. Flanker Kevin Jordan
did the most damage to the Stan
ford secondary, catching eight balls
for 146 yards. Stokes added five
catches for 94 yards and also hauled
in the key two-point conversion.
Even with these astronomic
passing numbers, each team still
found time to run the ball. Fresh
man Anthony Bookman led all rush
ers with 21 carries for 138 yards and
one touchdown, including a 70-yard
blast in the second quarter. This
marked the first time a true fresh
man broke the 100-yard barrier for
Stanford since Darrin Nelson in
1977. Sharmon Shah led the Bruins
with 110 yards on 18 carries.
However, the Cardinal's inabili
ty to give Bookman and senior full
back Ethan Allen enough rest due
to an injury-riddled backfield hurt
Stanford during its goal line situa
tions in the second half.
"Our backs were tired and we
were very thin and we couldn't run
the ball effectively at that point,"
Walsh said.
Several key mistakes at crucial
moments kept the Cardinal from
blowing out the Bruins. A false
start penalty forced Abrams to kick
a 27-yard field goal in the first
quarter, and then Stenstrom's foot
was stepped on by an offensive line
men on third-and-goal in the third
quarter, bringing Abrams in for a
21-yard kick.
On that goal line series, it
appeared as if Bookman had bro
ken the plane of the goal line, but
the ball was placed on the one-foot
line.
"I thought I was in, but as soon
as I crossed the plane they pushed
me back," Bookman said. "It was
just one of those calls that could go
either way."
Even the Stanford defense saw
several chances to put the game
away. Junior linebacker Jason
White put pressure on Cook all day

and recorded two sacks, but failed
to wrap up the Bruin quarterback
on two key UCLA drives.
On the Bruins' final scoring
drive, the Cardinal had two chances
to stop UCLA on third-and-18.
Cook got away from a charging
White and sent a pass 20 yards
downfield to Jordan. It appeared as
if Stanford's secondary caused a
fumble or at least an incompletion,
but Jordan was ruled down at the
41, good for a first down.
"Our defense is very porous and
we're very disappointed with some
facets of it," Walsh said. "But the
heart was there, they worked hard
and played as hard as they possibly
could. It's been that way every
game."
The defense forced two impor
tant fumbles in the third quarter,
but the offense only translated
those turnovers into six points.
"The defense gave us some big
turnovers in the beginning of the
second half and we just didn't capi
talize on them," Armour said.
"When they give us gifts like that, we
have to turn them into something."
Now mathematically eliminated
from post-season bowl action, Stan
ford again looks to redefine its goals
for the remaining three games.
"We're going to have to dig down
deep and see if we can finish the
season 5-5-1," Stenstrom said. "We
got three games and there's no
chance for a fourth one anymore."
Stanford was reminded of the
place of football in the grand
scheme of things as sophomore cor
nerback Eliel Swinton rejoined the
team after spending the week with
his family and his fiancee's family
in Los Angeles following her tragic
death two weeks ago. Seeing his
teammates for the first time in a
week, Swinton greeted each defen
sive back with a mighty bearhug
when he came out on the field.
"Just to see the guys again, it
made me feel happy," Swinton said.
Forced out of action with a quadri
cep injury, he is now fighting to get
back into playing shape.
"I'm trying to get back on the
field, that's what my girlfriend
would want me to do — get back
on the field as fast as I can," he
said. "It just makes me want to
play that much more. I have to
find something to keep my mind
off everything. It's strange, really
strange.
"They're thinking about moving
me back to strong safety, so I'm
just going to have a field day there.
Next week, I'm playing, no matter
what."
