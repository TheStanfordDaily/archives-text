## 31-30 loss to Bruins ends any post-season chances

Stanford 30
UCLA 31

For the third time this year, Stanford came up
on the wrong end of a game-winning field goal.
After tying Northwestern 41-41 on a missed
Eric Abrams kick and losing 36-35 to Arizona State
on a last-second field goal by the Sun Devils, the
Cardinal (2-5-1, 1-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
was prepared to buck that trend against UCLA (3-
6, 1-5) Saturday night as it lined up for a 32-yard
attempt with 20 seconds left in the game. However,
Abrams' kick sailed straight against the cold night
sky, flying a foot outside the left goal post, giving
the Bruins a 31-30 victory.
"It was better hit than the three that I made,"
said Abrams, referring to his 26-, 21- and 22-yard
field goals earlier in the game. "I knew for about
three-and-a-half minutes that it was going to come
down to me and I was looking forward to it."
Stanford appeared poised to end the game in sto
rybook fashion. After taking over at its own 35-yard
line with three minutes left, two incomplete passes
and a sack left the Cardinal facing a fourth-and-17
from the 28. A 23-yard bullet from senior quarter
back Steve Stenstrom to senior wide receiver Justin
Armour on a play they devised during halftime
moved the chains and kept Stanford's hopes alive.
"I thought it was a done deal at that point,"
Stenstrom said. "You kind of feel in those situa
tions it was sort of meant to be. Fourth-and-17, you
don't convert that many times in your career."
Armour had similar feelings about the miracu
lous fourth down conversion.
"We did exactly what we wanted to do," he said.
"That's how you write it up, how you dream it will
work."
Three more passes moved the Cardinal down to
the UCLA 19-yard line with 40 seconds to go.
Another sack forced Stanford to burn its final time
out, and then two short out-routes to senior flanker
David Shaw advanced the ball to the 15, in perfect
position for Abrams' game-winning attempt.
"We were definitely in a field goal mode at that
