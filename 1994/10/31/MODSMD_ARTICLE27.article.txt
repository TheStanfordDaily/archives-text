# Women's soccer ties UCLA, beats UCSB

### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
The Stanford women's soccer team gave
the notoriously loud UC-Santa Barbara fans
reason to heckle yesterday.
Sophomore forward Erin Martin scored a
school-record four goals to lead the No. 3
Stanford women's soccer team (14-1-1) to a 6-
0 romp over the host Gauchos (5-8-3). Mar
tin's outburst came on the heels of a disap
pointing 1-1 stalemate at UCLA (10-3-3) on
Saturday.

the first entry for Martin in the Cardinal

record book. With 14 goals and 12 assists for a
total of 40 points in 1993, she re-wrote the
freshman page in 1993.
This weekend Martin emerged from the
offensive funk that she, as well as the rest of

the team, had been in. Martin had notched
only one goal in six games, and Stanford as a
whole registered only single goals against its
last two opponents, San Francisco and UCLA.
The Gauchos, however, seemed powerless to
stop a rejuvenated Cardinal attack, allowing a
season-high six goals.
Stanford head coach lan Sawyers was
delighted with the sudden offensive
turnaround.
"I'm sure yesterday's outcome [the tie to
UCLA] had a lot to do with it," said Sawyers.
"After that, the team was very frustrated and
unhappy. It's a credit to them for turning it
around."
After registering 15 shots in the
two previous games to no avail,
Martin opened the flood gates
against the Gauchos. In keeping
with a Cardinal trend, her shot only
6 minutes, 10 seconds into the con
test came from long range, 15 yards
out. This time, however, she fired
perfectly into the upper left corner
past Gaucho goalkeeper Christina
Day. The Cardinal would not need
any more scoring to defeat the Gau
chos and their floundering offense,
but the Stanford attack was only
beginning to awaken.
In the 28th minute, Martin was
at it again. After receiving a pass
from junior sweeper Jessica Fisch
er, she launched a header from the
center of the box to pad the lead.
Fischer, the Cardinal's consensus
All-American, recorded her first
assist of 1994.
The score stood at 2-0 at the
half, but Stanford then unleashed a
furious four-goal string in a 10-
minute span that left Gaucho fans
seeing Cardinal red. Sophomore
forward Emily Burt initiated the
spurt six minutes into the second
half with a tap from two feet out on
sophomore midfielder Mandy
Tucker's first career assist. Five
minutes later, Burt scored her
eighth goal of the season from 15-
yard range.
Still, the Cardinal would not let

up. Only a minute later, Tucker's
header led to a breakaway for Mar
tin, who notched her second hat trick
of the year to make it 5-0. In the 61st
minute, Martin ended the blitzkrieg
with a shot from straight away, 15
yards out, on Burt's third assist of
the campaign. Martin's score gave
her 14 goals on the year, matching
her 1993 total, and leaves her six
goals shy of Sarah Rafanelli's single
season scoring mark, set last year.
"It's a very positive sign,"
Sawyers said. "We had some good
finishes, and some great goals that
would have been great against any
team. We're still on the way to
where we want to be, but this was
good to get our confidence up."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
the back of the nets in Los Angeles
were harder to find. UCLA fresh
man goaltender Gretchen Over
gaard demonstrated how to become
the fourth-leading keeper in the
nation, posting a school-record 17
saves to keep the Cardinal from its
fourth straight win.
Despite racking up 25 shots on
goal against the Bruins, Stanford
could not score in the game's final
83 minutes, including two 30-
minute overtimes.
"We've been averaging [21]
shots a game, and if you score only
one goal, eventually it's going to
catch up with you," Sawyers said.
"We can't afford to take that many
shots and not score. We've been rid
ing our luck a little bit far, and it
caught up with us."
Against the Bruins, Stanford
made a concerted effort to pass the

ball to the forwards, Martin and
Burt. In the first half, the strategy
appeared to pay off as Burt scored
from seven feet out on an assist
from junior Dena Dey. Dey, who did
not start for only the second time
this season as Sawyers tried to find
a more offensive-heavy line-up,
posted her fourth assist to tie Mar
tin for the team lead.
However, Burt's goal would not
hold up against a scrappy Bruin
team. Freshman Traci Arkenberg,
who has contributed to 16 of
UCLA's 21 goals on the season,
evened the score for good on a shot
15 feet out from the left side. Mari
Meinhardt and Tiffany Brown were
credited with assists on the score.
In its first overtime periods of
1994, the Cardinal dominated but
couldn't score. UCLA mustered
only two shots while the Cardinal
attempted seven.
"We had great opportunities,
but we didn't take good shots,"
Sawyers said. "We didn't execute
very well in front of the goal. Give
Gretchen credit too. She's a big
keeper, but we kept shooting the
ball without any power."
With the tie, UCLA is in the
driver's seat for the best record in
the Pacific 10 Conference, at a 3-0-
1 mark with one game remaining.
However, a coaches' poll will
determine the conference champi
on. Stanford, now 1-0-1 in the Pac
-10, stands as the clear favorite to
win the title if it defeats No. 15
Washington and Washington
State in its final two regular sea
son contests.
