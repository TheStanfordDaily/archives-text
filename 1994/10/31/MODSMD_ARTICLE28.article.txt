When the Stanford men's
water polo team traveled south
to Los Angeles, they knew they
weren't going to Disneyland.
But the No. 1 Cardinal ran
into Mickey Mouse nevertheless.
When Stanford and No. 2 USC
met at the McDonald's Olympic
Pool, the Cardinal players were
greeted by a public address
announcer which coach Dante
Dettamanti called "just com
pletely tasteless."
"That was the worst
announcing job I've ever seen at
a collegiate game," Dettamanti
said, referring to the erroneous
introductions and several snide
comments during the match. "It
was completely Mickey Mouse. I
can't believe [coach John
Williamsl let him get away with
that."
