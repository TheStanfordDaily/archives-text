When the Stanford men's
water polo team traveled south
to Los Angeles, they knew they
weren't going to Disneyland.
But the No. 1 Cardinal ran
into Mickey Mouse nevertheless.
When Stanford and No. 2 USC
met at the McDonald's Olympic
Pool, the Cardinal players were
greeted by a public address
announcer which coach Dante
Dettamanti called "just com
pletely tasteless."
"That was the worst
announcing job I've ever seen at
a collegiate game," Dettamanti
said, referring to the erroneous
introductions and several snide
comments during the match. "It
was completely Mickey Mouse. I
can't believe [coach John
Williamsl let him get away with
that."

may have backfired on the Trojans
(11-5), however, as the Cardinal
(17-1) took the insults as a rallying
point. The result was a 10-7 victoiy,
Stanford's fourth win this season
over its closest rival.
USC's "lack of class" amazed
Stanford goaltender Jack Bowen,
but the junior said the team fired
up because of it.
"The score was not a good repre
sentation of the game," Bowen said.

Indeed, the Cardinal led 10-4
with three minutes left in the
match before making a few minor
errors which led to Trojan goals.
Bowen collected 12 saves, spear
heading the defensive effort which
kept USC's powerful offense from
getting on track.
"Once again, we were mainly
pressing on the right side of the
pool," Bowen said. "That lets me
come out of the goal to make steals.
lUSC | was tentative because they
knew they couldn't get the ball to
the hole from that side."
The defensive strategy of the
Cardinal aimed to keep Trojan hole

man Hrvoje Cizmic from scoring at
close range. An adjustment by
Bowen in the goal and the hole
defense of Jeremy Laster prevented
Cizmic from a big offensive game.
"We had a good press and Jere
my was awesome again," Bowen
said. "I knew Cizmic likes to roll out
and shoot across the cage, so I
adjusted and blocked both the balls
he shot in that direction. Prepara
tion was the key."
Dettamanti cited specifically the
Cardinal's 6-on-5 defense as its
strength against the Trojans. While
Stanford converted four of its seven
extra-man opportunities, USC cap

italized on only two of 11.
The coach also commended the
balanced scoring which has become
a Cardinal trademark this season.
Senior Wolf Wigo led Stanford with
three goals while senior Frank
Schneider and freshman Layne
Beaubien added two apiece.
Saturday, the Cardinal kept its
intensity, whipping No. 5 UCLA
(12-9) to clinch the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation title.
Stanford jumped out to a 5-1
lead after one period of play and
then extended the margin to 8-1 in
the second quarter. The Bruins
tried to get back into the game, clos

ing the gap to 8-4 before the Cardi
nal rattled off the next four goals to
take a 12-4 lead. The Bruins man
aged a small rally at the end of the
game to make the final score 13-7.
"We were playing really great for
the first half," Dettamanti said.
"We really took it to them."
The Cardinal featured a devas
tating inside-outside attack, as
holeman Brian Wallin tallied four
points from close range while
Laster netted two two-point goals.
"As a whole, UCIA doesn't have
strong [two-meter) defenders,"
Wallin said. "They have a relatively
small team."

Dettamanti was impressed with
Walton's ability to use his weak arm,
as the sophomore scored three of
his four goals using left-handed,
backhand shots.
The pair of victories should seal
the No. 1 seed for Stanford at the
MPSF tournament. From there,
Cardinal will make its bid for the
No. 1 seed at the NCAA Champi
onships in Long Beach, Calif., just
miles from the Magic Kingdom.
Dettamanti and company look
forward to defending the NCAA
title. The Trojans and the rest of
the NCAA should know there is
nothing Mickey Mouse about that.
