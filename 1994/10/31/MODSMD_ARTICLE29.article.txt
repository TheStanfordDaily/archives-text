# Doctors call family care a crucial medical field
## 
### Kiran Srinivas 
Two renowned San Francisco physicians
stressed the importance of family care prac
tice to nearly 50 medical students Saturday
at a day-long conference at the Medical
School.
Students from a host of California medi
cal schools attended the 12th Annual Con
ference of the California Student Association
of Family Practice to learn more about fami
ly care medicine.
Dr. Richard and Patricia Gibbs, two fami
ly care physicians who recently opened up a
free health clinic in San Francisco, stressed
to the attendees that family care doctors are
indeed a unique breed.
Patricia Gibbs added that family care doc
tors are "experts in every medical field."
The Gibbs' health clinic is one of the most
unique in the country, providing medical
attention only to people without health
insurance.
Very often the uninsured are the ones
who need the most medical attention, yet
they do not have the money to see a doctor,
said Richard Gibbs. He said he hopes the
clinic will serve many needy people in San

Francisco.
"Family care is growing very quickly,"
said Dr. Bo Greaves, chairperson of the
American Academy of Family Practice New
Physicians Committee.
With the rapidly rising costs of medical
bills, Gibbs said that more and more people
will rely on family care doctors to provide
them with a wide range of medical services
for a relatively cheap cost.
"Family care and primary care are going
to play a much bigger role in the future.
Family care doctors can serve more people
for less money," said third-year medical stu
dent Alexandra Mazard, one of the two stu
dent co-coordinators of the conference.
Mazard said the goal of the conference
was "to bring California medical students
together to show them what family care
practice is all about."
"Family care doctors serve the whole
range, from your babies to your grandmoth
er," Mazard said.
Greaves noted that more and more stu
dents at top medical schools are choosing to
specialize, rather than serve in primary care.
"It's very nice to see this conference being
held at Stanford, of all places," Greaves said.

Workshops in the afternoon exposed the
students to specific aspects of family care,
including AIDS prevention and research
opportunities in community medicine.
The conference also held a residency fair
at lunch, with booths from 30 different resi
dency programs in California.
