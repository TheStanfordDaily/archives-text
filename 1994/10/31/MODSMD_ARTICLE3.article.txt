# SAE house-less?
## University reviewing frat's status 
### Allison Short Staff writer 
Disciplinary problems last
spring have led the University to
review Sigma Alpha Epsilon's sta
tus as a fraternity, meaning that
SAE could lose its house and be
suspended as a University organi
zation.
The final decision regarding the
fraternity's status will be reached
by the end of the quarter, said se
nior Geoff Haft, SAE president.
A nine person committee —
composed of two faculty members,
two staff members, two members
of the Interfraternity Council
Board, two alumni and a student
chosen by the ASSU — will meet
later this week to discuss the rec
ommendation that will be given to
Dean of Students Michael Jackson
and Diana Conklin, acting co-di

rector of Residential Education.
In the meantime, Jackson has
suspended the fraternity's ability
to hold social events.
"This is primarily more of a re
view of the house's status than a
disciplinary problem," Haft said.
But Fraternal Affairs Advisor
Heather Dunn said past discipli
nary concerns such as an illegal
bonfire are the main reason for
SAE's review.
Traditionally, graduating SAEs
hold a bonfire in their backyard
the night before graduation.
Three years ago, the bonfire got
out of hand and the University
told the fraternity that the ritual
was too dangerous to continue,
Haft said. But last year's seniors
held the bonfire anyway.
"SAE has been told by the Uni-
veraity not to hold bonfires but
members of the fraternity chose
to disregard that," Dunn said.
"Given that incident and previ
ous other problems, we felt they
lacked the organizational struc
ture to maintain a strong housed
fraternity."
Dunn added that she has had
to deal with the fraternity on
repeated behavior problems over
the last few years.
"There's been a cumulatively
strong indication that this was
not a healthy organization," she
said. "We were spending a great
deal of time with this one orga
nization. We're to the point
where there can't be a next
time."
As a result of SAE's re-evalua
tion as a fraternity, the organiza
tion is taking numerous steps to
prove it deserves its housing sta
tus.
"I feel like we're making a lot
of positive changes in the house,"
said senior Dan Fox, SAE vice
president. "We're strengthening
the judicial process within the
house and have made a big effort
to increase the amount of com
munity service."
SAE has created a judicial
committee to deal specifically
with behavioral problems and
has undertaken a complete re
organization and re-evaluation of

the leadership duties in the
house, Fox said. Both Fox and
Haft said they have also recon
structed the house handbook to
include more specific details on
what is expected of SAEs and of
pledges.
"It's been a positive force on
the house," Haft said. "We're
moving in a much more positive
direction. Our house is in excel
lent shape right now."
In addition, the fraternity has
increased its involvement with
the Stanford community, said
Haft. Tonight, for example, SAE
is holding a haunted house for
East Palo Alto children. In the
spring the fraternity also hopes
to put on a basketball tourna
ment for Stanford students and
donate the proceeds to charity,
Fox said.
As a result of the changes,
Haft and Fox said they are
expecting a favorable recommen
dation regarding the fraternity's
status.
"We're expecting a good out
come," Fox said. "The University
is looking for change and we're
looking forward to the review
process."
"It's stacked in their (SAE's)
favor if it's one way or another,"
Dunn said. "They will have to
demonstrate that they deserve to
remain an organization on cam
pus and remain housed."
But, she added, "unfortunate
ly they have done really foolish
things that there is no excuse for
at all."
