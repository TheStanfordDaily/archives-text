# CPPC phone bid system down till next quarter
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman 
A new system at the Career Planning
and Placement Center which allows stu
dents to bid for job interviews by tele
phone has broken down and will proba
bly not be fully operational again until
winter quarter.
With the system — implemented this
fall — students can submit requests for
interviews, fmd out if their requests were
granted and sign up for interviews by
telephone, said CPPC Assistant Director
Lance Choy.
Since Oct. 19, however, the system
has only been partially functional. Stu
dents can still submit requests by phone
but must go to the CPPC for the other
two parts of the process.
The CPPC now posts lists of names of

students whose requests were granted —
a practice which has raised concerns of
confidentiality among some students,
Choy said.
To protect confidentiality, bid lists
will be posted with ID numbers for the
rest of the quarter, as was done in past
years, he said.
"When the system went down, we had
to work fast so we just put students'
names on lists," Choy explained.
Choy has heard complaints about the
posting of names, but "people felt embar
rassed, not that it was unfair," he said.
Senior Jeffrey Allison, who has placed
several bids this quarter, said he thought
the system's flaws were more of a prob
lem than its confidentiality.
Knowing who else has an interview
with a prospective employer is "not real

ly different than knowing who else is in a
class with you before a test," he said.
The system has always "been really
annoying," Allison said. "It takes so long.
Even when it was sort of working, it took
15 minutes to do two bids."
Still, he added, "I can tolerate slow
ness if it works."
The waiting periods, which increased
when the database became corrupted,
convinced the CPPC to close down the
phone system, Choy said.
Choy said he is sympathetic with
upset students. "Recruiting is nerve
wracking as it is," he said, "so they didn't
need to have all these last-minute frus
trations."
"In spite of that," he added, "I think
students were very patient."
The CPPC has become more crowded

since the phone system broke down,
Choy said, but the problem is no worse
than in the past, when there was no
phone system.
"When deadlines come up, people will
be lined up at the doors," he said. "But
it's always been like that. That's what
we're hoping to eliminate with the phone
system."
Allison suggested that the CPPC look
at putting the bidding process on-line in
stead of using the telephone so students
can see what they are doing.
"At least when you go into the office
you have something concrete," he said.
" I would rather know for sure than guess
on the telephone."
The CPPC is installing a new program
to check the database for prob
lems, Choy said, and will be testing
the system within the next few

weeks.
Switching back from the manu
al system before the end of the
quarter would only cause more
confusion, Choy said. "It's better
to let the quarter finish, and then
start the new quarter fresh," he
said.
