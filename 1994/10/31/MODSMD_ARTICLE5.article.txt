A recent analysis of 100 insti
tutions ranks Stanford as the top
scientific research university in
the country, placing it above such
institutions as Harvard, Caltech
and Yale.
The Institute for Scientific In
formation in Philadelphia, which
performed the study and pub
lished its findings in the October
edition of its newsletter Science-
Watch, placed Stanford at the top
of the field. Runners-up in this
study were Harvard, Yale, MIT,
Caltech, UC-Berkeley, University
of Chicago, Cornell and Prince

"I don't think there would be

Everything else being equal
though, it's always nice to be
number one," said James Whit
lock, Chair of the Molecular Phar
macology Department, whose de
partment was one of the two

ranked as number one in their
field.
The method used to compile
these rankings is a somewhat con
troversial measure called citation
analysis. Using a database to find
out how often, on the average, an
institution's papers are cited, the
institution looks at various fields
and calculates whose papers are
cited the most, said Chris King,
Science Watch editor.
The study compensates for the
varying sizes of institutions by di
viding the number of citations by
the number of articles published
to obtain the average number of
citations per paper.
Using this method, Stanford
placed among the top 10 in 17 of
the 21 fields examined. It ranked
first for papers cited on clinical
medicine and pharmacology, and
scored second in ecology / envi
ronment, economics and busi
ness, education, immunology and
law.
