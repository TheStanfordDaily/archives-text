# Stanford ranked top research university

A recent analysis of 100 insti
tutions ranks Stanford as the top
scientific research university in
the country, placing it above such
institutions as Harvard, Caltech
and Yale.
The Institute for Scientific In
formation in Philadelphia, which
performed the study and pub
lished its findings in the October
edition of its newsletter Science-
Watch, placed Stanford at the top
of the field. Runners-up in this
study were Harvard, Yale, MIT,
Caltech, UC-Berkeley, University
of Chicago, Cornell and Prince
ton.
"I don't think there would be
much difference between the
number five school and the num
ber one school in this ranking.
Everything else being equal
though, it's always nice to be
number one," said James Whit
lock, Chair of the Molecular Phar
macology Department, whose de
partment was one of the two

ranked as number one in their
field.
The method used to compile
these rankings is a somewhat con
troversial measure called citation
analysis. Using a database to find
out how often, on the average, an
institution's papers are cited, the
institution looks at various fields
and calculates whose papers are
cited the most, said Chris King,
Science Watch editor.
The study compensates for the
varying sizes of institutions by di
viding the number of citations by
the number of articles published
to obtain the average number of
citations per paper.
Using this method, Stanford
placed among the top 10 in 17 of
the 21 fields examined. It ranked
first for papers cited on clinical
medicine and pharmacology, and
scored second in ecology / envi
ronment, economics and busi
ness, education, immunology and
law.
"Stanford papers have a sub
stantially higher influence among
scientists themselves," King said.
"Stanford papers seem to recur
as being more cited above the
world average, at least in our
study."
The results of this study have
been greeted with mixed reactions
on campus. While most professors
agree that it is a good indicator of
the research done at Stanford,
most doubt the absolute validity
of the study.
"Rankings are always fun to
look at. . .but the fact is that they
can change according to what is
measured," said David Starrett,
the Economics Department chair.
"There are lots of different mea
sures, but there isn't one that
tells you all that you need to
know."
"It's a compliment to our fac
ulty, and it reflects the productiv
ity and creativity of our staff,"
Whitlock said. He also stressed,
however, that citation analysis is
only one kind of research mea
sure.
While expressing doubts about
the system, Chief of Clinical
Pharmacology Terrence Blas
chke pointed out that the study
does indicate "that people are
looking at the papers pub
lished by Stanford — more so
than by those at any other uni
versity."

Blaschke said the ranking will
likely increase the general aware
ness of Stanford as a premier
research school, both among the
public and the scientific commu
nity.

King agreed, adding, "I think
it shows that the independent
research coming out of Stanford
is definitely influential. It has the
attention of the scientific com
munity."
