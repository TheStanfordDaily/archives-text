# 'A new low'
## Band makes big news at Simpson trial 
### Ben Sussman 
Everything is not "all right
now" for 23 members of the Stan
ford Band who skipped practice
Friday to play outside the Los An
geles County Superior Court
house, site of the much-hyped
O.J. Simpson murder trial.
That's because those Band
members who showed up at the
trial did more than simply play.
As trial attorneys left the court-

nouse lor tne day, trie nana members wno were
gathered outside started chanting.
"Set O.J. free!" one half yelled.
"Or lock him up!" the rest yelled back.
Lead defense attorney Robert Shapiro told the
Associated Press "a new low in tasteless behavior."
This "unauthorized and unapproved" perfor
mance sent the Band into chaos Saturday as Ath
letic Director Ted Leland initially suspended the
entire band and canceled their pre-game and half
time shows for the Stanford-UCLA game.
"We were surprised by the appearance of our
band at the courthouse and, as you might under
stand, very disappointed," Leland said.
After finding out that only certain members of
the Band had been involved, however, he instead
suspended those members, referring to them jok
ingly as "a renegade group in the Band."
While no official punishment has been handed
down for the offending members, Band manager
Marshall Ungar said that he expects a final deci
sion to be made sometime this week.
Band members started their chant while play
ing the Tubes' song "White Punks on Dope." Imi
tating their half-time routine for introducing the


Leland
football team, they formed two par
allel lines for the attorneys to pass
through as they exited the court
house.
Assistant Band Manager Chris
Quaintance commented, "It's
upsetting to see the justice system
made into such a circus by one trial.
Having the Band (members] point

this out is [both] a good and funny
thing."
Leland also tried to put a posi
tive spin on it, saying that Band
members "like to live on the edge as
part of either their charm or their
bad side, depending on how you
look at it."
While the Stanford communi
ty's reaction to the incident has
been mixed — with opinions rang
ing from embarrassed to enter
tained — Quaintance said "the
student reaction seems to be fairly

positive."
Friday's incident was not the
first time that members of the
Band have received mixed publici
ty, nor was it the first time that
they did so involving O.J. Simpson.
An article in the Ixjs Angeles
Times last week criticized the
Band's performance during the
half-time show of the Stanford-
USC game. That show also
focused on the O.J. Simpson trial,
specifically the media circus sur
rounding it.

Speaking about Friday's unau
thorized performance, Quaintance,
downplayed the Band's role in the
media hype. "The whole trial has
become such a mockery that we
merely added another facet to it."
Leland gave a similar explana
tion, saying, "The difficulty we
have with them is that almost every
show, there's some part of you that
wants to discipline them. We have a
set of guidelines that they seem to
be able to work within but still
offend some people every week."
