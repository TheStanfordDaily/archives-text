gathered outside started chanting.
"Set O.J. free!" one half yelled.
"Or lock him up!" the rest yelled back.
Lead defense attorney Robert Shapiro told the
Associated Press "a new low in tasteless behavior."

the Band had been involved, however, he instead

down for the offending members, Band manager
Marshall Ungar said that he expects a final deci
sion to be made sometime this week.
