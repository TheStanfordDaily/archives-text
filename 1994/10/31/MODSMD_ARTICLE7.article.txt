# Full moon brings acting group out to play at night

### Valerie Hung 
A ghostly howl rips across the stillness,
piercing through the fabric of the night.
Suddenly, the shadows of the Quad come
alive — lunging, leaping and falling.
Welcome to a rehearsal for Full Moon
Faerie Tales.
While members of Stanford's new per
formance-based group may at times take
on wolfish characteristics, they are all just
students who happen to share an interest
in the arts. Dancers, musicians, writers
and actors can claim membership to Full
Moon Faerie Tales.
As the name implies, every full moon
draws the group out of their dens and into
the moonlight. Beginning at the stroke of
midnight, the band roves from place to
place giving 20-30 minute performances.
Their goal is to provide Stanford with a
"free constant supply of theater" that is
"improv-based and crazy," said founder
Caroline Laskow, a senior. But audiences
expecting to witness a simple fairy tale on
stage are in for a rude awakening.
"Faerie Tales is an umbrella term for

tales of mystical, magical things," Laskow
explained. "Not all are goingto involve just
text necessarily, some will be all dance or
all poetry. It's basically up to whoever's in
the group."
The group does expect to maintain an
underlying theme of feminism. "I really
like the feminist aspect," said member
Sarah Cathcart, a sophomore. "We're pre
senting fairy tales in a twisted and new
way, perhaps even unexpected."
The result is a macabre mixture of the
bizarre and beautiful.
"It's surreal ballet at night," said mem
ber Geoff Sobelle, a sophomore. "Things
that shouldn't move, move — things that
shouldn't sing, sing."
Since admission is free, funding for ma
terials comes from two grants Laskow re
ceived last spring: the Robert F. Pierce
Memorial Award and an Undergraduate
Research Opportunities grant.
The initial inspiration for the group,
however, came a year earlier. As part of the
Women's Performance Collective, Laskow
