# Full moon brings acting group out to play at night
## 
### Valerie Hung 
A ghostly howl rips across the stillness,
piercing through the fabric of the night.
Suddenly, the shadows of the Quad come
alive — lunging, leaping and falling.
Welcome to a rehearsal for Full Moon
Faerie Tales.
While members of Stanford's new per
formance-based group may at times take
on wolfish characteristics, they are all just
students who happen to share an interest
in the arts. Dancers, musicians, writers
and actors can claim membership to Full
Moon Faerie Tales.
As the name implies, every full moon
draws the group out of their dens and into
the moonlight. Beginning at the stroke of
midnight, the band roves from place to
place giving 20-30 minute performances.
Their goal is to provide Stanford with a
"free constant supply of theater" that is
"improv-based and crazy," said founder
Caroline Laskow, a senior. But audiences
expecting to witness a simple fairy tale on
stage are in for a rude awakening.
"Faerie Tales is an umbrella term for

tales of mystical, magical things," Laskow
explained. "Not all are goingto involve just
text necessarily, some will be all dance or
all poetry. It's basically up to whoever's in
the group."
The group does expect to maintain an
underlying theme of feminism. "I really
like the feminist aspect," said member
Sarah Cathcart, a sophomore. "We're pre
senting fairy tales in a twisted and new
way, perhaps even unexpected."
The result is a macabre mixture of the
bizarre and beautiful.
"It's surreal ballet at night," said mem
ber Geoff Sobelle, a sophomore. "Things
that shouldn't move, move — things that
shouldn't sing, sing."
Since admission is free, funding for ma
terials comes from two grants Laskow re
ceived last spring: the Robert F. Pierce
Memorial Award and an Undergraduate
Research Opportunities grant.
The initial inspiration for the group,
however, came a year earlier. As part of the
Women's Performance Collective, Laskow

read "Don't Bet on the Prince," a
collection of feminist fairy tales
edited by Jack Zipes.
That fall, Laskow also attend
ed a series of lectures given by
opera director and UCLA Prof.
Peter Sellars. His description of
the weekly midnight puppet
shows he took part in as a Har
vard student, combined with her
readings, provided the necessary
stimulus, she said.
. Full Moon Faerie Tales
became Laskow's special research
project. After devoting last sum
mer to hammering out the logis
tics, she distributed flyers, told
friends and held a meeting in
early October. Thirty-five people

showed up.
For those like Sobelle, the
excitement of being part of some
thing unique was an important
factor.
"There's not enough weird
stuff on campus — it's almost like
a prank," he said, "It's that same
sort of feeling."
The requirements — or lack
thereof — for becoming a group
member was another probable
cause for the large turnout. "You
have to show up," Laskow
explained. "The only thing I need
is a body."
Twenty-four of those bodies
began work for their first perfor
mance at Full Moon on the Quad.
Despite the lack of prior experi
ence on the part of some mem
bers, the wide array of talent and
positive energy made the
rehearsals memorable.

"It became an obsession,"
Sobelle said. "If you're going to do
anything, especially anything per
formance-based, it has to be
important to you or it's not
important to anyone."
Tensions ran high before the
performance. Especially nerve
wracking was the fact that most
of the audience did not show up
until after 11:00. This fed the fear
that no one would ever come.
"This thing swept through me,
and I told myself, 'OK there won't
be an audience coming,' " Laskow
said. "But I had prepared myself.
Even in the coming months there's
no guarantee of an audience."
A sizable crowd did show up,
and the act — featuring feminist
fairy tale "The Story of Petronel
la" — ran as scheduled. Bad
acoustics, however, prevented
many in the audience from hear

ing the performers.
"The 30 or so people close to
the stage got the fullest experi
ence," Laskow said. "Everyone
else got an interesting visual pic
ture."
The group distributed 300 fly
ers before whisking away to their
next destination, the Enchanted
Broccoli Forest.
In the future, Laskow hopes to
make audiences "feel like they've
just witnessed or been a part of
something different. . .as if they
were just in the path of a travel
ing sideshow."
Indeed, a word of caution for
those wishing to behold this spec
tacle: be sharp of mind and swift of
foot, for shadows awakened by the
light of the full moon vanish
abruptly, leaving only the hollow
echo of what began once upon a
time.
