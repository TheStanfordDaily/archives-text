The year was 1963 and then-California Gov.
Pat Brown and his wife, Bernice, wanted their
youngest daughter to attend UC-Berkeley.
Kathleen Brown, however, had a different
plan. With her heart set on Stanford Universi
ty, she forged her parents' signature, borrowed
some money from a family friend and applied
for admission to the Farm.
"I was thrilled when I found out I was ac
cepted because I had always wanted to go to
Stanford," Brown said in a telephone interview
hist week. "My parents were a little surprised
but otherwise delighted that I got in."
More than 30 years later, the Democratic
gubernatorial candidate still shows much of

presently engaged in a fierce race with Repub

to 1966, while her older brother, Jerry Brown,
presided from 1974 to 1982.
Brown, 49, said the current gubernatorial
race is "too close to call. But the momentum is
going in my direction."
Major issues facing the two candidates in
clude the controversial Proposition 187, a dev

astated state economy, a rising fear of crime
and an overcrowded and inaccessible public
school system.
Affordable education
Brown addresses these issues in her new 62-
page book, "Building a New California: The
Kathleen Brown Economic Plan."
Brown's economic plan — released in early
October — offers solutions for improving pub
lic schools, higher education and the economy,
for cracking down on crime and illegal immi
gration and for solving the state's budget cri
sis.
She proposes creating one million new pri
vate sector jobs, hiring additional border patrol
