# Brown gears up for election day
## Alumna reflects on campaign, recalls undergrad years on Farm 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
The year was 1963 and then-California Gov.
Pat Brown and his wife, Bernice, wanted their
youngest daughter to attend UC-Berkeley.
Kathleen Brown, however, had a different
plan. With her heart set on Stanford Universi
ty, she forged her parents' signature, borrowed
some money from a family friend and applied
for admission to the Farm.
"I was thrilled when I found out I was ac
cepted because I had always wanted to go to
Stanford," Brown said in a telephone interview
hist week. "My parents were a little surprised
but otherwise delighted that I got in."
More than 30 years later, the Democratic
gubernatorial candidate still shows much of
the same gumption. The Stanford graduate is
presently engaged in a fierce race with Repub
lican incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson.
The heir to one of California's most power-

ful political dynasties,
Brown has served as
state treasurer since
1991.
Her previous back
ground includes stints as
a New York corporate at
torney, a member of the

ucation and an appointee to the Los Angeles
Board of Public Works, which oversees the
city's vital infrastructure.
Her family name is associated with two of
the state's most successful eras. Brown's fa
ther, Pat Brown, served as governor from 1958
to 1966, while her older brother, Jerry Brown,
presided from 1974 to 1982.
Brown, 49, said the current gubernatorial
race is "too close to call. But the momentum is
going in my direction."
Major issues facing the two candidates in
clude the controversial Proposition 187, a dev

astated state economy, a rising fear of crime
and an overcrowded and inaccessible public
school system.
Affordable education
Brown addresses these issues in her new 62-
page book, "Building a New California: The
Kathleen Brown Economic Plan."
Brown's economic plan — released in early
October — offers solutions for improving pub
lic schools, higher education and the economy,
for cracking down on crime and illegal immi
gration and for solving the state's budget cri
sis.
She proposes creating one million new pri
vate sector jobs, hiring additional border patrol
officers, building boot camps for non-violent
offenders and freezing fee hikes at public uni
versities and community colleges.

ucation more affordable by expand
ing access to financial aid for mid
dle-class families, Brown said.
"As governor, I will make it my
mission to defend the principles of
affordability and accessibility that
have been under assault these last
four years," Brown claims in the
plan.
According to the plan, Brown
previously proposed a GALLoans
Program that would have lever
aged existing non-general fund
dollars to provide up to $200 mil
lion in low-interest loans for thou
sands of middle-class families.
But Brown claims Wilson vetoed
the bill, saying more financial aid
wasn't necessary.
Brown said increased access to

financial aid will be particularly
beneficial to Stanford students.
"Making loans more readily avail
able to middle-class families is
particularly important for Stan
ford students," she said.
A 'risky' proposition
Brown's plan also looks at the
controversial Proposition 187 — a
measure which would deny
health, education and social ser
vices to undocumented immi
grants and require reporting of
"suspected" illegal aliens to the
Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
"Proposition 187 would just
make a bad situation worse,"
Brown said. "It not only risks $15
billion in federal funds but it cre
ates 'Big Brother' government."
Stanford could potentially lose
federal money if Proposition 187
passes, Brown said.

As governor, Brown said she
would help establish partnerships
between independent and state
universities, and between the
public and private sectors.
For example, she noted her
fight to obtain federal funding for
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center last October. On Oct. 4,
1993, President Clinton
announced that the Department
of Energy would grant $237 mil
lion in federal funds for the B-fac
tory project to SIJVC.
Brown said she would continue
to fight for these kind of partner
ships, which "all serve to help
develop the intellectual infras
tructure of the state."
Life on the Farm
Brown, who earned a bache
lor's degree in history in 1969,
pointed to her years at Stanford
as the beginning of her political

awareness.
She described her college years
as a "time of social activism." The
civil rights movement and
protests against the Vietnam War
helped shape her political values,
she said.
One memory that stands out in
Brown's mind is the the 1963
November day that President
Kennedy was assassinated, she said.
"It was right before Big Game
weekend, and I was walking over
to Memorial Church," Brown
remembered. "They announced
over the loudspeaker that JFK
had been shot."
"I will always remember the
sharing of that experience," she
said. "For me, that event really
signaled the dimming of the ideal
ism of that era."
However, Brown said she
learned more than politics during
her time at Stanford. She said her

college experience was important
"both socially and intellectually."
Calling herself a "nontradi
tional student," Brown said it
took her six-and-a-half years to
complete her undergraduate
degree.
"My best-laid plans for a four
year college education were inter
rupted, in turns, by a marriage,
the birth of my first child, my
husband's law studies on the Fast
Coast, the birth of my second
child and a return to the West
Coast," Brown said in her plan.
In addition, it took Brown 14
years to earn a law degree from
Fordham University in New York.
Brown said Stanford courses
such as History Prof. Barton Bern
stein's "Social History" class in
1965 helped her grow intellectually.
Bernstein said he remembers
Brown as an "affable, sincerely
charming person — not bv design

but by personality — who was
intelligent with an easy and natu
ral human warmth."
Looking back, Bernstein said
he never expected Brown to run
for governor 30 years later, partly
because "at that time, women
didn't run for governor."
But he added that in retrospect
he's not surprised at Brown's
political success.
Jan Steele, who now works for
the Stanford Athletic Depart
ment, knew Brown as one of her
freshmen residents in Branner
Hall in 19H3 when Steele was a
resident assistant in the then
female dormitory.
"It's not surprising at all that
she's running for governor. Even
then I could see her in the political
arena," said Steele, who was a
senior at the time. "I really enjoyed
her a lot. She was very poised, very
friendly and very social."

page book, "Building a New California: The
Kathleen Brown Economic Plan."
Brown's economic plan — released in early
October — offers solutions for improving pub
lic schools, higher education and the economy,
for cracking down on crime and illegal immi
gration and for solving the state's budget cri
sis.
She proposes creating one million new pri
vate sector jobs, hiring additional border patrol
officers, building boot camps for non-violent
offenders and freezing fee hikes at public uni
versities and community colleges.

ucation more affordable by expand
ing access to financial aid for mid
dle-class families, Brown said.
"As governor, I will make it my
mission to defend the principles of
affordability and accessibility that
have been under assault these last
four years," Brown claims in the
plan.
According to the plan, Brown
previously proposed a GALLoans
Program that would have lever
aged existing non-general fund
dollars to provide up to $200 mil
lion in low-interest loans for thou
sands of middle-class families.
But Brown claims Wilson vetoed
the bill, saying more financial aid
wasn't necessary.
Brown said increased access to

financial aid will be particularly
beneficial to Stanford students.
"Making loans more readily avail
able to middle-class families is
particularly important for Stan
ford students," she said.
A 'risky' proposition
Brown's plan also looks at the
controversial Proposition 187 — a
measure which would deny
health, education and social ser
vices to undocumented immi
grants and require reporting of
"suspected" illegal aliens to the
Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
"Proposition 187 would just
make a bad situation worse,"
Brown said. "It not only risks $15
billion in federal funds but it cre
ates 'Big Brother' government."
Stanford could potentially lose
federal money if Proposition 187
passes, Brown said.

As governor, Brown said she
would help establish partnerships
between independent and state
universities, and between the
public and private sectors.
For example, she noted her
fight to obtain federal funding for
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center last October. On Oct. 4,
1993, President Clinton
announced that the Department
of Energy would grant $237 mil
lion in federal funds for the B-fac
tory project to SIJVC.
Brown said she would continue
to fight for these kind of partner
ships, which "all serve to help
develop the intellectual infras
tructure of the state."
Life on the Farm
Brown, who earned a bache
lor's degree in history in 1969,
pointed to her years at Stanford
as the beginning of her political

awareness.
She described her college years
as a "time of social activism." The
civil rights movement and
protests against the Vietnam War
helped shape her political values,
she said.
One memory that stands out in
Brown's mind is the the 1963
November day that President
Kennedy was assassinated, she said.
"It was right before Big Game
weekend, and I was walking over
to Memorial Church," Brown
remembered. "They announced
over the loudspeaker that JFK
had been shot."
"I will always remember the
sharing of that experience," she
said. "For me, that event really
signaled the dimming of the ideal
ism of that era."
However, Brown said she
learned more than politics during
her time at Stanford. She said her

college experience was important
"both socially and intellectually."
Calling herself a "nontradi
tional student," Brown said it
took her six-and-a-half years to
complete her undergraduate
degree.
"My best-laid plans for a four
year college education were inter
rupted, in turns, by a marriage,
the birth of my first child, my
husband's law studies on the Fast
Coast, the birth of my second
child and a return to the West
Coast," Brown said in her plan.
In addition, it took Brown 14
years to earn a law degree from
Fordham University in New York.
Brown said Stanford courses
such as History Prof. Barton Bern
stein's "Social History" class in
1965 helped her grow intellectually.
Bernstein said he remembers
Brown as an "affable, sincerely
charming person — not bv design

but by personality — who was
intelligent with an easy and natu
ral human warmth."
Looking back, Bernstein said
he never expected Brown to run
for governor 30 years later, partly
because "at that time, women
didn't run for governor."
But he added that in retrospect
he's not surprised at Brown's
political success.
Jan Steele, who now works for
the Stanford Athletic Depart
ment, knew Brown as one of her
freshmen residents in Branner
Hall in 19H3 when Steele was a
resident assistant in the then
female dormitory.
"It's not surprising at all that
she's running for governor. Even
then I could see her in the political
arena," said Steele, who was a
senior at the time. "I really enjoyed
her a lot. She was very poised, very
friendly and very social."
The year was 1963 and then-California Gov.
Pat Brown and his wife, Bernice, wanted their
youngest daughter to attend UC-Berkeley.
Kathleen Brown, however, had a different
plan. With her heart set on Stanford Universi
ty, she forged her parents' signature, borrowed
some money from a family friend and applied
for admission to the Farm.
"I was thrilled when I found out I was ac
cepted because I had always wanted to go to
Stanford," Brown said in a telephone interview
hist week. "My parents were a little surprised
but otherwise delighted that I got in."
More than 30 years later, the Democratic
gubernatorial candidate still shows much of
the same gumption. The Stanford graduate is
presently engaged in a fierce race with Repub
lican incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson.
The heir to one of California's most power-

ful political dynasties,
Brown has served as
state treasurer since
1991.
Her previous back

ucation and an appointee to the Los Angeles

city's vital infrastructure.
Her family name is associated with two of
the state's most successful eras. Brown's fa
ther, Pat Brown, served as governor from 1958
to 1966, while her older brother, Jerry Brown,
presided from 1974 to 1982.
Brown, 49, said the current gubernatorial
race is "too close to call. But the momentum is
going in my direction."
Major issues facing the two candidates in
clude the controversial Proposition 187, a dev

astated state economy, a rising fear of crime
and an overcrowded and inaccessible public
school system.
