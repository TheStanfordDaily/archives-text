## Alleged White House gunman charged Facing four felony counts, Duran ordered to take psychiatric exam for competency 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
man accused of firing a semiauto
matic rifle at the White House
was charged with four felonies
and ordered to undergo a psychi
atric exam yesterday. Prosecutors
said a letter taken from his truck
"raises questions whether he is
competent."
U.S. Magistrate Deborah Robin
son refused to release the hand
written letter, which was taken
from Francisco Martin Duran's
pickup. She ordered him returned
to court tomorrow, after the exam,
for a competency hearing.
U.S. Attorney Eric H. Holder
Jr. said authorities had recovered
two letters — the one in the truck
and another Duran was carrying
when he was seized outside the
White House.
Also found in the truck, accord
ing to prosecutors, was a shotgun,
an arsenal of ammunition, a gun

magazine, a machete, sleeping
bags and a stuffed animal.
Officials have previously indicat
ed the letter in the truck was an
explanation of how Duran's posses
sions were to be distributed to his
wife and son in event of his death.
In his first court appearance,
Duran, '26, stood and stated his
name, raised his right hand and
swore to tell the truth. He wore a
dark polo shirt and jeans into the
highest security courtroom in the
federal courthouse — one with
bulletproof plastic separating
spectators and reporters from the
judge, attorneys and defendant.
Duran sat up for most of the
15-minute hearing, but bent over
during a conference at the bench
to read a handwritten note.
Assistant U.S. Attorney John
Finnegan told the magistrate that
Duran's letter "brings into ques
tion whether the defendant is

competent to proceed."
Holder said later the request for
the 24-hour psychiatric evaluation
was "not an indication that we
believe he is incompetent." Nor
was it, he said, an indication that
prosecutors thought Duran "was
at the time of the offense insane."
Competency at this stage
means the defendant can under
stand the charges against him
and can assist his attorney, public
defender Leigh Kenny.
Kenny said she had no con
cerns about Duran's competence
at this time.
If Duran is found competent
after tomorrow's hearing, there
will be a preliminary hearing in
which prosecutors would have to
present enough evidence to justify
continuing the case.
He was charged with posses
sion of a firearm as a convicted
felon, destruction of federal prop

erty, assault on a federal officer
and use of a firearm during the
commission of a crime of violence.
Prosecutors said he could receive
as much as 35 years in prison if
convicted of all four counts.
Holder said other charges
might be filed later.
Prosecutors would not discuss
a possible motive for Saturday's
shooting, in which a man fired 20
to 30 shots at the White House
through the iron fence on Penn
sylvania Avenue with a Chinese
made semiautomatic rifle. Eight
shots hit the building.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd
Bentsen, whose department
includes the Secret Service, said
options officials are considering
for increasing security include
closing parts of Pennsylvania
Avenue and stationing more
guards on the White House side
walk.
