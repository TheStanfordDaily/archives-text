### 
FRESNO, Calif. (AP) - U.S.
Senate candidate Michael Huffin
gton discounted a poll yesterday
that showed him trailing incum
bent Dianne Feinstein, saying
that his campaign's own voter
survey shows a virtual tie.
Huffington, the Republican
nominee, also downplayed the
impact of the recent disclosure
that he and his wile employed an
illegal immigrant nanny.
"I say if you have a good rela
tionship with your family and a
good relationship with God, who
cares what they say about you?"
Huffington said at a Fresno
appearance.

In Southern California cam
paign stops yesterday, Feinstein, a
Democrat, received endorsements
and was applauded by environ
mentalists for passage of legisla
tion aimed at protecting the Cali
fornia desert.
Going into the final week of the
campaign, the independent, non
partisan Field Poll showed Fein
stein leading 45 percent to 39 per
cent.
The 6-point lead is a trace of
the 28-point lead Feinstein
enjoyed in January, but a rebound
for her after the 43 percent to 43
percent dead heat of last month.
The poll also found that despite

HufTington's roughly $25 million
campaign — more than twice the
cost of Feinstein's — one in three
voters still has no opinion of him.
The poll's findings were the
same for both registered voters
and registered voters who cast
ballots regularly. The survey was
conducted from Oct. 21 to Sun
day. The poll has a margin of error
of plus or minus 3.4 percent.
In Los Angeles, Feinstein
received the endorsements of five
Republican executives of top
defense firms, just one day after
she snagged another GOP ally —
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Rior
dan.
