## Re-elect Byron Sher 
### 
POLITICAL EXPERTS ARE
predicting that an unusual
number of incumbents will
find themselves out of work this
November, because voters seem
ready to "throw the bums out."
But Stanford's state representa
tive, Democratic Assemblyman
Byron Sher, does not deserve such
treatment. Of course, his

absence from the Sacra
mento "bum" list is not the
only reason to re-elect him.
Sher's community roots
run deep. After returning
from a Fulbright Scholar
ship in New Zealand, he

served on the Palo Alto City Coun
cil and as the city's mayor before
his election to the Assembly in
1980. In those 14 years, Sher has
established himself as one of the
most intelligent members of the
legislature. He has been active in

EUOION
94

forwarding environmental causes
(he chairs the Assembly's Natural
Resources Committee) and other
liberal efforts.
If re-elected, term limits will
force him from office in 1996.
While sentimentality does not nor
mally dictate votes, voters should
return Sher for a final two years in

the Assembly. It is simply
difficult to imagine anyone
else in the seat.
If his qualifications are
somehow not enough,
there is a final (perhaps
more selfish) reason to re
elect Sher: he is a professor

at the law school. It is obviously a
tremendous resource for Stanford
to have a lawmaker on faculty.
Furthermore, the University will
be assured of adequate (and maybe
even special) representation in
Sacramento.
