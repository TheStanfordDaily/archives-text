# Only one week to go

### 
WITH A WEEK TO go
before election day, the
congressional races are in
full swing and proposition debates
are raging. So once more we'll
remind you that voting is not just
about going to the polls one day to
punch a few holes in a ballot card.
It's about arming oneself with
enough information beforehand to
make meaningful choices.
This means reading the elec
tions handbook and local newspa
pers and gathering enough infor
mation on the candidates and
issues to make knowledgeable,
informed decisions.
On November Bth, voters across
the state will be choosing a state
governor, picking their representa
tion in the state assembly and in
Congress and deciding such
weighty matters as whether illegal
immigrants should be able to
receive social services and whether
California should adopt a single
payer health-care plan.
These are issues that can't be

captured in a sentence or a sound
bite or even a 30-second commer
cial. That's why it's important for
individual voters to do their own
legwork. Grill your dormmates,
professors, the guy sitting next to
you at lunch. There are countless
ways to gather the information nec
essary right here on campus from
stopping at a table in White Plaza to
getting involved in a student group.
Stepping into the voting booth
with enough information on the
candidates and issues will ensure
that the exercise is not just a mind
less task guided by party-lines.
So it is up to the voters to make
sure the upcoming election is
based on thoughtful, informed
choices and nothing else.
Voters between ages 18 and 29
make up about 17 percent of the
total registered voters in Califor
nia. Young people's decisions to
punch one hole and not the other
will have a weighty impact on the
election outcome — and the future
of the state.
