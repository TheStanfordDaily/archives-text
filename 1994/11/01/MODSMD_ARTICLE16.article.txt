For women, success requires more than self-empowerment

IN RESPONSE TO Carson Brown's
letter of Oct. 31, I think she makes
many good points by taking the
stance of individual empowerment and
initiative. I would like to clarify that I
was not espousing a "victimization theo
ry;" rather, I meant to emphasize the
restraints that society currently places
upon women. Certainly, there are many
assertive and successful women, who
needed no encouragement from any out
side agents. Nor are women incapable of

overcoming adversity on their own. To
an extent, women certainly are responsi
ble for their own lives and self-empower
ment.
But I would ask why women com
prised only half of one percent of the
highest paid officers and directors of 799
companies in the largest U.S. industrial
and service organizations in 1990? [For
tune Magazine, volume 122]
Are the women in these companies
merely not taking enough initiative?

Does simply being assertive and taking
advantage of opportunities yield equal
results or equal treatment? I think not.
I believe there is a danger of accepting
"victimization theory" at one extreme
and "superwoman theory" at the other.
By "superwoman theory," I mean the
belief that if a woman simply Tries hard
enough, or enacts some variation of
objective skill or ability, then she will be
successful.
Ms. Brown ends her letter by saying

that we should "challenge society." In
many ways, I feel that we are actually
saying the same things, but in different
words. To "challenge society" is what I
mean when I say that we should change
society so that women receive more
respect, encouragement and thereby
empowerment; these external factors
have an influence as great as individual
will.
