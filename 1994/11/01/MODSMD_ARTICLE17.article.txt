# Campus bicyclists and rollerbladers must take responsibility for safety
## 
### 
I have lived on this campus for over
four years, and I have traveled around
it on my bicycle constantly. During this
time, I have noticed an increasing
amount of recklessness displayed by
some rollerbladers and some bicyclists.
An incident on Friday, Oct. 28 illus
trates what I am talking about.
I was on my bicycle riding by the cor
ner of the Quad near the English
department. Another student ahead of
me was riding in the same direction
when a rollerblader darted between us,
clipping his back wheel and cutting me
off, resulting in a bicycle pile-up. Lucki
ly, neither of us was injured badly, and
no serious damage to our bicycles
resulted. The distressing thing about
the incident, however, was that the
rollerblader didn't even stop to make
sure everyone was all right, or at the
very least apologize to the two of us for
causing an accident.
By not stopping, the rollerblader
failed to take responsibility for his
actions. With all the bikers, roller
bladers, and pedestrians moving around
campus in close quarters, accidents will

happen; but when they do, it is impor
tant that everyone involved takes
responsibility for cleaning up. If we had
been in automobiles, the incident just
described would have been considered a
hit and run, and there are severe penal
ties for this offense under California
law.
If the rollerblader I have described is
you, I think you owe the other rider and
me an apology. In the future, I hope
that you will be more careful on your
skates.
