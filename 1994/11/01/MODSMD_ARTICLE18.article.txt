# Band member clarifies actions at Simpson trial
## 
### 
This may seem like splitting hairs,
but I'm writing anyway concerning
your article on the Stanford Band in
yesterday's Daily. As one of the 23
Band members who played at the Los
Angeles Country Criminal Court
house, I feel impelled to set the record
straight on a few minor details.
First of all, the band did not play
"White Punks On Dope" while Robert
Shapiro and the other trial attorneys
"left the courthouse for the day." The
attorneys were returning from their
lunch break and were actually going
back inside the courthouse. Further

more, we did not play "White Punks
On Dope" as they passed us, but
rather the William Tell Overture â€”
the song that the Band traditionally
plays during football games, when the
Stanford football team comes on the
field.
I am not faulting you for these
inaccuracies, though, as several
media sources (the Los Angeles Times,
the San Francisco Examiner, CNN
and several network affiliates) also
misreported the story in the same
manner. While the Stanford Band is
notorious for its poor taste, we at
least have some sense of style.
