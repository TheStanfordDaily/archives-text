# Band's antics are not harmful to Stanford's reputation or prestige
## 
### 
I was bemused by some of my peers'
negative reactions to the most recent
incident involving the Stanford Band.
One of them, citing that incident and
others in the past, said that the Band's
activities were hurting Stanford's repu
tation.
Is this belief anywhere near the realm

of plausibility? Will a prospective fresh
man really say to herself, "Well, all
things being equal, I'd rather go to the
school with the more polite band"? Will
we someday be told by prospective
employers, "Yes, we know you have a
degree from Stanford, but we're hiring
the guy from so-and-so Tech because
their band is housebroken"?
C'mon, people. As long as members of
the Band aren't committing felonies,
they're only hurting themselves, if any
one. I say lighten up and enjoy the fun.
