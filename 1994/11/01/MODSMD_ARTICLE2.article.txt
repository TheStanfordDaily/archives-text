# Review's Indian raises ire
## Native Americans upset over logo 
### Anita Krishnamurthy 
Upset by The Stanford Re
view's use of the Indian logo on
its pages, the Stanford Native
American Graduate Students
have decided to approach Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
about their concerns.
The group met yesterday to
discuss how they should protest
the use of the logo, which depicts
a stereotypical "Indian" who ap
pears to be on the warpath with
feathers in his cap and a toma
hawk in his hand.
Several Native American stu
dents said the logo used by The
Review promotes racism, propa
gates misconceptions within the
Stanford community and in
hibits the Native American stu
dents' learning environment.
After a lengthy debate, the
Stanford American Indian Orga
nization met late Sunday night
and resolved not to write letters
of protest to The Review. They
are still unsure of what type of
action they will take.
The graduate group, however,
decided to take prompt action.
The group plans to schedule a
meeting with Casper later this
week and present a statement of
their point of view. The state
ment will request that the ad
ministration enforce its anti-dis
crimination policy and take a
stand on the issue.
At first, the group members
were unsure whether they as a
group should even take action.
Some members said it is not
worth the effort to protest The
Review. "The object of The Re
view is to walk the first amend
ment line," said Wilson
Pipestem, a Native American
graduate student. "They anger
the people with no intention of
reporting things accurately, in
order to get us to react."
Native American graduate stu
dent Sara Jumping Eagle, howev
er, brought up another point. "By
not saying anything, does it mean
that we're tolerating the logo?"
she asked.
Many students agreed it is nec
essary to show their disapproval
of the logo in some way, although
some worried that they couldn't
make a huge impact on the com
munity.
"The Review is not so worried
about it because we are not huge
in numbers," Jumping Eagle said.
"We have to do something to
make a statement."
Review Editor in Chief Aman
Verjee said that he hasn't heard
any complaints from Native
American students and he wants
to know if they are upset about
the logo.
"We have only received three
letters to the editor about the
logo, none of which were from
Native American students," Ver
jee said. "There is no evidence of a
huge upset."
Veijee added, "If the students
are upset they should approach

me or The Review or have a forum
so that they can express their con
cerns and I can explain why I
chose the logo."
Verjee said the logo is used
simply as a fun way to spice up a
section. In fact, he said, it honors,
rather than belittles the Native
American culture.
"I'm willing to listen to the
Native American concerns and
balance the negative and positive
sides of using the logo, and if nec

essary pull the logo," he added.
The group reached a consensus
that they should make the admin
istration question its anti-dis
crimination policies and perhaps
re-evaluate them based on their
apparent tolerance of the logo.
The administration should be
forced to take a stand on the
issue, group members said,
because it is ultimately its respon
sibility to set guidelines and make
sure thev are met.

Tovar, Sara Jumping Eagle and Tina Pierce say the group finds The
Stanford Review's use of the Indian logo offensive and degrading.
