## Learning from my cadaver 
### 
WHEN I CONSIDERED writing
about my Human Anatomy class,
I first thought the subject was
too specific for the diverse Stanford audi
ence. Pulling my head away from the tox
icity of formaldehyde, I took a step back
and reconsidered. Strictly speaking,
human anatomy is the science of the
structure of human beings. In other
words, anatomy is about what's inside
you and me. In reality, however, anatomy
is a survey course for the gamut of aca
demic interests at Stanford. Let me
explain.
For those in the natural sciences, the
connections are clear — especially to
those in biology and human biology.
You'll be happy to know that all those
organs and blood vessels that you've
seen on overheads really do exist! Come
on over during dead week (no pun
intended) to study for exams. The engi
neers also are invited to marvel at the
exquisite design of our circulatory sys
tem, bones and joints. Try as it may, the
bio-tech industry cannot duplicate the
efficiency and durability of the original
product.
The anatomy laboratory is a fantastic
environment for social scientists as well.
Hundreds of anthropology dissertations
could be written about the interaction of
medical students with their faculty and
peers. The gradation of communication
— from the unshakable patience of the
senior faculty member who explains the

same concepts ad nauseam, to the proud
student who belligerently insists on
being "right" — is intriguing. The
tremendous transfer of knowledge
(anatomy of the entire body is taught in
11 weeks) and the various teaching
methods utilized to that end is itself a
subject of great interest to those in edu
cation.
Neither are the arts irrelevant in this
unique learning arena. The history of
anatomy books includes the works of
Leonardo da Vinci, whose accurate repre
sentations of the human body amaze
even the modern anatomist. Frank Net
ter, author of one of today's most popular
texts, is no less impressive in his precise
renditions of this incredibly complex
apparatus.
Yet the relevance of this course to
other disciplines goes far deeper. Dissect
ing a human body, from head to toe, is
not something that is done without a cer
tain amount of awe and emotion. The
human body is a tremendously beautiful
thing. In the lab, everything is exposed.
Every muscle of every movement which
you and I make can be seen and touched.
Even the nerves which carry sensation
from all parts of the body to the brain are
in full view. Our flexibility and power is
tremendous. The temptation is to wor
ship it as the ultimate machine, the peak
of evolutionary progress.
A closer look proves such idolatry an
error. Discovery of the cause of death

reveals our weakness and vulnerability.
In spite of the awe-inspiring design of our
body, one simple flaw can destroy the
entire system. Seen in this light, the line
between strength and fragility seems fine
indeed.
Pondering the subject further incorpo
rates students of religious studies and
philosophy. In reflection, I try to compare
what I am dissecting to what I see in the
mirror and wonder what really separates
the two. According to medicine it is lack
of blood to the brain. I find that explan&
tion insufficient.
Nothing in anatomy can explain the
soul. What really happens to our anima
tion, our passion, our innermost
thoughts? Does the collective conscious
ness of a lifetime of experience simply
vanish in the fleeting instant we call
death? Nothing I've seen even remotely
helps to answer that question. I can't tell
one body from the next, yet I know that
each one had its own values, aspirations
and dreams.
Trying to relate the physical structure
of a body to the people I interact with
daily, questions keep coming and the
answers grind to a halt. Maybe neurobi
ology next quarter will give me a clue.

Chris Carlsten hopes that the interest
over his column does not overshadow the
health care debate.
