## 
### 
This week marks the tenth anniversary of the assassination of Indira Gandhi Mrs Gandhi was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime
minister of India After her father \ death, she served as India's prime-minister for nearly two decades On October .11. 1984, two of her bodyguards,
shaheeds Meant Singh and Satwant Singh, emptied their assault rifles into her body, and then surrendered themselves to the Indian authorities
The Indian Cultural Association and the Sikh Student Association feel that the circumstances surrounding her assassination ami India 's
subsequent history reveal a great deal about the plight of the people living within the borders of India
The assassination of Indira Gandhi was the predictable result of her
depraved policies towards the Sikh nation.
Before relinquishing India in 1947, the British through colonization consolidated India and provided it with an unprecedented
appearance of "unity." The Indian National Congress was able to secure this inheritance by extending guarantees to India's many communities
which were historically autonomous from New Delhi. On December 9, 1946, Jawaharlal Nehru admitted that, "Adequate safeguards would
be provided for minorities in India...lt was a declaration, pledge and an undertaking before the world, a contract with millions of Indians, in
the nature of an oath we must keep!"
However, when the Sikh nation, under the leadership of Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, peacefully demanded that the Indian
government remain true to its word, Mrs. Gandhi responded by literally waging war on the Sikh nation. On June 3, 1984,the date of Guru Purb,
the most celebrated Sikh religious holiday, Mrs. Gandhi deploying the Indian army, air force, and navy, ordered the attack of the Sikh's holiest
gurdwara (Sikh temple), Harmandur Sahib, and forty other Sikh gurdwaras throughout Punjab. The attacks resulted in the death of thousands
of Sikhs the overwhelming of whom were religious pilgrims. In addition, Mrs. Gandhi removed the state government of Punjab; suspended
all constitutionally protected rights; and ordered the expulsion of both foreign and Indian press from Punjab, scaling Punjab from the rest of
the world. Mrs. Gandhi's cruel response to the Sikh's demands for was not only intended to suppress Sikh opposition to New Delhi's despotic
rule, but was also intended to humiliate the minority Sikh community for the purposes of catalyzing electoral support under the banner of Hindu
nationalism.
Although Mrs. Gandhi accomplished her goal of increasing Hindu electoral support, she did so by attacking a community bestowed
with the responsibility of challenging tyranny wherever it may exist (In fact, despite constituting only 1% of the subcontinent's population,
the Sikh nation contributed greater than 80% of those executed or imprisoned during India's struggle for independence.). And, on October 31,
1984. Mrs. Gandhi reaped what she had sown.
The aftermath of the assassination and India's subsequent history confirm
the Sikh nation's understanding that India is debased as a nation,
and needs radical restructuring to protect the liberty of the people within its borders.

Following the assassination of Mrs. Gandhi, Indian government officials collaborated with Indian security forces and carefully
coordinated mob violence against Sikhs living in New Delhi and other regions of India outside Punjab. This resulted in the deaths of thousands
of Sikhs, and in New Delhi alone, 50,000 Sikhs became homeless. "When the history is written of the horrors that followed the assassination
Indira Gandhi, the 32nd block of Trilokpuri Colony will be remembered as a place where civilization disintegrated!" Rone Tempest,
"Civilization Broke Down in Sikh Colony Near Delhi" Los Angeles Times, November 6, 1954.
Despite the fact that investigations revealed that at least four members of the Indian parliament were involved in orchestrating the
murder, rape, arson and looting, until this day no one has ever been arrested or charged for their involvement. Furthermore, the victims who
survived the holocaust remain homeless, having never received any reparations from the Indian government.
Instead, the Indian government is directing its resources to bolstering its security forces, the instrument of India's tragic human rights
policy against Sikhs and other minorities seeking autonomy from New Delhi. Please sec, Dead Silence: The Legacy of Abuses in Punjab
(Human Rights Watch/Asia and Physicians for Human Rights: 1994); The Human Rights Crisis in Kashmir: A Pattern of Impunity (Human
Rights Watch/Asia and Physicians for Human Rights: 1993); John-Thor Dahlburg "Punjab's Lawless Police!' Los Angeles Times: July 9, 1994.
Rajni Kothri, a noted political scientists asserts that, India is a state that is fast being reduced to a police and para-military apparatus.
Rethinking Human Rights: Challenges for Theory of Action, p.25 (New Delhi and New York: 1989). In other words, the Indian government
has become a military aristocracy and it has employed its military to conquer itself. And therein lies the fundamental problem with India and
the policies that supports it,"The use of forcc alone is but temporary. It may subdue for a moment; but it docs not remove the necessity of
subduing again; and a nation is not governed, which is perpetually to be conquered." Edmund Burke, The Thirteen Resolutions, March 22,
1775.
The Indian Cultural Association and the Sikh Student Association urge the
international community to support a plebiscite that provides the people living within
India's borders an opportunity to choose independent nationhood.
On March 19, 193 1, Mahatma Gandhi, addressing a Sikh congregation asserted, "I ask you to accept my word...and the resolution of
the Congress that it will not betray a single individual...much less a community...[o]ur Sikh friends have no reason to fear that it would betray
them. For, the moment it docs so, the Congress would not only thereby seal its own doom but that of a country too. Moreover, Sikhs arc a
brave people. They know how to safeguard their rights by exercise of amis if it should ever come to that."
In this regard the Mahatma indeed proved prophetic. In the last ten years over 100,000 Sikhs have been martyred in the Sikh nation's
effort to free Khalistan and the people living within India's borders, shaking the foundations of New Delhi's despotic rule.
The Indian Cultural Association and the Sikh Student Association ask that the international community expedite the liberation of the
people living within India's borders, by urging that the United Nations dircct a plcbiscitc in India that provides the people an opportunity to
choose independent nationhood.
