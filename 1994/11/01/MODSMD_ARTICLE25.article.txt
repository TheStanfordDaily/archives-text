The wild crowd of spirited Oterans
sends another wave down the bleachers
in Maples Pavilion as they cheer on
their dorm mate, Kristin Folkl. A key
recruit of the Stanford women's top
ranked volleyball team, Folkl has
already achieved a level of status most
college athletes only dream of. She has
successfully distinguished herself as an
invaluable member of the team with her
powerful kills and towering jumps.
"It's a disadvantage when you first
come to college and you have to play in
front of hundreds of strangers," Folkl
said. "That's why it's exciting to get so
much support from my dorm. It's nice
to be able to look out into the audience
and associate names with faces."
However, it takes quite a bit more to
divert Folkl's exclusive concentration
from her game. She was named All-
State in basketball and volleyball during
her four years in high school and was

awarded both National Player of the
Year and All-American honors her
junior and senior years for volleyball
and basketball. To top it off, she won
the prestigious Dial Award, an honor
given to the top male and female high
school athletes in the country.
"Sports have always been a big part
of my life," Folkl said. "I was such a
tomboy when I was younger. Until I was
about seven years old, people would ask
me if I was a boy or girl. I had really
short hair and hung out with boys most
of the time to play sports."
Born and raised in St. Louis, Mo.,
this midwestern girl has tried every
thing from back handsprings to piano
playing. But her affinity for the out
doors and athletic interests ranging
from ice skating to racquetball still pre
vail among her personal preferences.
"Believe it or not, soccer is my
favorite sport even though I'm terrible
at it," she claims. "Because of time con
straints, I had to choose which sports I
wanted to concentrate on. Considering
my height advantage and where my
skills lie, volleyball and basketball were
the natural choices. You don't usually
see six-foot, two-inch girls running
around the soccer field."
With exceptional stamina and self
driven motivation, Folkl's dream of rep
resenting the U.S. in the Olympics may
soon materialize into a reality. Folkl
revealed that there is a possibility of
training for the '96 women's Olympic
volleyball team; however, as she knows,
practicing with the team will not guar
antee a spot in Olympic competition.
"I played in the Goodwill games this
summer, and the Olympic coach and I dis
cussed various possibilities for my future
in volleyball," Folkl said. "But every
thing's still up on the drawing board,
nothing*s official yet. It would be a great
honor to be invited to train with [the
Olympic team |.. .though I lack the experi
ence that a lot of the other players have."
With all the hype focusing on Folkl's
athletic ability, including her profile
recently featured in The New York
Times and The San Francisco Chroni
cle, it is easy to forget the counter sides
of this multi-talented student.
"Sports have always come pretty easy
to me," Folkl said. "I've always striven
not to be classified as a 'dumb-jock', so
it's the academics that I've had to work
hard at. In high school I got straight A's
because I felt as though people would

look down on me if I didn't."
Folkl describes her upbringing as
very traditional. She names her parents
as her heroes, since the values they have
impressed upon her are the ones which
she hopes to reflect. In addition, several
others have played a significant role in
shaping her outlook on life.

"There's one teacher that sticks out
in my mind — Ms. Povard," said Folkl.
"She always forced me to think critical
ly and made me realize what school w;is
all about. She didn't aire about when
Christopher Colombus came to Ameri-

ca, but why he came."
Folkl's philosophy on life
derived partly from her child
hood days, yet is expanding as
she gains a wider perspective on
the world, contradicting some
what with her conservative
lifestyle.
"I've recently learned to live each
day as if it were the last," she
admits. "I'm not a totally wild and
carefree person, but I guess it means
that I don't take things for granted."
Folkl smiles proudly at her deci
sion to attend Stanford, passing up
two other top contenders, UCLA
arid Texas.
"I love it at Stanford, everything
seems to be falling into place," Folkl
claims. "My classes, the campus, the
people — everything is great. And I
love Otero. I'm just like everyone
else here. Dorm life is a lot of fun,
but it has its disadvantages, of
course. It's an experience that every
freshman needs to go through."
Best of all, her dormmates can't
wait until basketball season to
watch Folkl dunk.
