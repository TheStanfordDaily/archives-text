# What's a half nelson?
## Learning the basics from the Cardinal wrestlers 
### 
1 walked into the office of Chris Hor
pel, Stanford's head wrestling coach,
not knowing quite what to expect.
The problem was not being a
fledgling sports writer fresh out of Daily
lOlx — I had enough energy and naive
enthusiasm to get me past that. The
problem was that my job was to cover
wrestling, and I didn't know the first
thing about the sport.
Well, that's not entirely true. I knew
enough to get past the initial pleas
antries with this friendly bearded man.
Wrestling, as in, you know, half nelsons
and leg rides and guys scrambling
around on a mat trying to pin each
other. I had the lingo down pat, I was
making good eye contact, my interview
ing strategies seemed to be working. No
sweat.
"So Chris (we were automatically on
a first-name basis)," I asked mid-way
through the meeting, my confidence
building by the second, "how many
players are on the team this year?"
Horpel's eyes suddenly narrowed
and a silence hung in the air for a few
seconds longer than it should have.
Although I didn't know what the prob
lem was, I instantly knew that I had
said the wrong thing. My cover was
blown like a leaf in the wind.
He leaned a little closer, a mixed

expression of concern and fear and exas
peration on his face. "Allyson, the first
thing you should know about wrestling
is that these are not players. . .they're
athletes or wrestlers," he said. "Players
is for basketball and football."

He followed this up with the question
I had dreaded all along: "If you don't
mind me asking, what exactly do you
know about wrestling?"
How do the words zilch, zero, nada
grab you, Chris?
I attempted to stumble through a
tactful answer, babbling something
about two weeks of high school gym
class, watching the Olympics on TV and
a distant relative who used to wrestle in
eighth grade. Try as I might, it became
increasingly obvious that any know
ledge of wrestling simply did not occupy
my brain. Squirming under Horpel's

gaze, I cursed the day I agreed to do the
job, cursed my editors who offered me
the job, cursed the day I was born. . . .
My self-deprecations came to a
screeching halt when Chris grinned —
still pained by my ignorance, but
nonetheless with understanding.
Instead of laughing me back to my little
dreamworld of being a sports journalist,
he pulled out piles of information on
wrestling.
For the next hour, he sat across from
me and explained the rules of the sport,
gave me the low-down on the athletes of
the Cardinal team, and even demon
strated some of the moves. At first it
seemed as though he spoke in a foreign
language. Takedown? Advantage time?
Escape? Clearly there was a lot more to
wrestling than I had first assumed.
As I got to know the sport — and the
athletes — better, I learned not just the
strategy, but also the general philoso
phy behind wrestling. These were intri
cate moves Chris described, much more
than a casual game of Twister. They
involved constant thinking and antici
pation of the opponent's tactics; they
required conditioning, confidence and
quickness.
I noticed the intensity with which


Allyson
Mizoguchi
Jay Jackson psyched up for his
match, jumping and marching in
determined circles by himself in a
corner of Burnham; I saw the
twists and angles of Tod Surmon's
body as he sprang for a takedown;
I admired the way Jimmy Aguirre
shot at the legs of his opponent, so
quick and yet deceptively calm. I
saw new ways a human body could
move, bend and overpower. This
was athleticism.
As the season progressed, I
realized that wrestling is in
many ways the consummate
sport: two individuals tussle in a
competition of both mind and
body, all alone save for instinct
and skill.

My appreciation for wrestling
grew even as I struggled with
terminology and technicalities
in my stories. My role as a writ
er took on the added responsi
bility of telling not just the
facts, but making those facts
ring true with the excitement I
experienced at the matches. I
felt I owed it to the wrestlers to
spread the word. For all of their
hard work, they certainly
deserved the recognition.
The home season begins Dec. 3
against Cal Poly-SLO at Burnham,
and I'm looking forward to watch
ing the wrestlers compete again. I
won't be at the press table though,
collecting stats and recording furi
ously on my pad. Instead I'll be sit
ting with the fans.

Someday, Chris, Allyson will get
the lingo right.

required conditioning, confidence and
quickness.
I noticed the intensity with which


Allyson
Mizoguchi
Jay Jackson psyched up for his
match, jumping and marching in
determined circles by himself in a
corner of Burnham; I saw the
twists and angles of Tod Surmon's
body as he sprang for a takedown;
I admired the way Jimmy Aguirre
shot at the legs of his opponent, so
quick and yet deceptively calm. I
saw new ways a human body could
move, bend and overpower. This
was athleticism.
As the season progressed, I
realized that wrestling is in
many ways the consummate
sport: two individuals tussle in a
competition of both mind and
body, all alone save for instinct
and skill.

My appreciation for wrestling
grew even as I struggled with
terminology and technicalities
in my stories. My role as a writ
er took on the added responsi
bility of telling not just the
facts, but making those facts
ring true with the excitement I
experienced at the matches. I
felt I owed it to the wrestlers to
spread the word. For all of their
hard work, they certainly
deserved the recognition.
The home season begins Dec. 3
against Cal Poly-SLO at Burnham,
and I'm looking forward to watch
ing the wrestlers compete again. I
won't be at the press table though,
collecting stats and recording furi
ously on my pad. Instead I'll be sit
ting with the fans.

Someday, Chris, Allyson will get
the lingo right.
