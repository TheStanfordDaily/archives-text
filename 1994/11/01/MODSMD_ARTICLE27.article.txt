# Women's golf takes 2nd in tourney
## 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
For awhile it looked as if the Sun Devils, rated the best
women's golf team ever assembled by Golf World magazine,
would actually suffer defeat.
After the first two days of the San Jose State Invitation-
Mi last weekend, Stanford held a two-stroke lead over the
top-ranked team in the country, Arizona State. And upon
completion of the first eight holes during the final day of the
tournament, victory for the Cardinal still appeared likely.
"I really felt great about the two shot lead," said coach
Tim Baldwin. "Everyone felt good. I was really confident."
By the ninth hole, however, things started to break down.
"We started out well [Sunday]," Baldwin said. "Then it
basically came apart at the ninth hole when a couple play
ers shot double bogeys and [the lead} continued to slide
away. One hit a shot into the water and one hit into the
woods and another three-putted ... and it slipped away."
After all was said and done, the title went to ASU by 12
strokes. The Sun Devils shot 308 in the final round to fin
ish with a total of 909. Stanford placed second with 921

strokes, shooting a 322 on Sunday.
"It was disappointing for me and especially for the play
ers," Baldwin said. "Last year, we finished better than Ari
zona State and San Jose State in tournaments [while not
winning the competition]. We never had a two shot lead in
a tournament {last year]. We never had a chance to beat
them and win a major college tournament.
"It's only natural that the team felt the pressure," the
coach added.
After the first two rounds, senior Jamille Jose was tied
for second individually. She shot two consecutive rounds of
73 on the par 74 course.
Amanda Baxter, a sophomore who won the individual
title in her first tournament of the year, followed close
behind. Baxter, a preseason All American, ended Saturday
two strokes behind Jose with a pair of even-par rounds.
All-American sophomore Mhairi McKay shot a 73 in the
first round and followed that up with an 81. Senior Amy
Lawrence had rounds of 77 and 80 while junior Vicky Stra
da shot a 90 during the first round but came back with a 75.
"The first two rounds we had
great individual play," Baldwin
said. "(Sunday], we didn't have
any great rounds."
Baxter, Lawrence and Strada
each shot 80 during the fateful
final day. McKay shot a 82 and
Jose a 83.
"Hopefully what happened today
won't happen again," B<ildwin said.
Baxter completed the tourna
ment with a 228, which tied her
for fifth place, and Jose ended up
in seventh, one stroke behind
Baxter. McKay tied for 18th and
Lawrence tied for 23rd. Strada
came in 37th.
Up next for the Cardinal is the
Golf World Invitational. Eleven
of the top 12 teams will compete
in Hilton Head, N.C. with the
exception of ASU.
According to Baldwin, based
on the Cardinal's strong perfor
mance so far this year, Stanford
should receive either a No. 2 or
No. 3 ranking in the latest polls
when thev come out.
