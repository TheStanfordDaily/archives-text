# Sailors fifth at Districts

At the Sloop Districts this past pre-Hal
loween weekend, the Stanford sailing team
received too many tricks and not enough
treats, failing to qualify to Nationals with a
mediocre fifth place finish.
"Our goal was to qualify," said coach Steve
Bourdow. "We are definitely disappointed."
Hosted by the University of Hawaii, the
Sloop Districts serve as the gateway to the
Nationals. The four-man Cardinal squad com
prised of seniors Rolf Kaiser and Charles
Meade, junior Adam Lowry, and sophomore
Matt Chauvel had exactly that goal in mind
but came up short.
"Maybe we were a little overconfident,"
Bourdow said. "Or else we didn't give the com
petition enough credit. We were only expect
ing to see about three good teams out of the
entire field of seven, but instead, almost all
the teams were good."
Interestingly enough, out of all the good
teams, the best may not have actually won due
to an eerie protest bug that bit many of the
races. UC-Irvine ultimately placed at the top
in the regatta and qualified for nationals, but
not without a great deal of controversy.
"California was the best team there," Bour
dow said. "UC-Irvine won the regatta by hav
ing Berkeley disqualified on a sleazy protest.
Irvine pushed a situation that didn't need to
be pushed."
Stanford was not safe from the protest bug
as it was disqualified from the third race
because of a mark-rounding protest made by
Long Beach State. The disqualification, how
ever, had little effect on the Cardinal's final
finish.
"Protests are natural in this sport, but
some of the ones in this regatta were really
ugly," said sailing director Blake Middleton.
Despite the protests and accusations, the
race had to go on. Stanford started out as the
best team, winning the first race, but later on,
several big errors caught up with the Cardinal
sailors. With just seven trials and seven solid
teams, one mistake hurts, and any more than
that will kill.
"We had good speed in the beginning, but
big errors later on were costly," Bourdow said.
"Especially with just seven races, those errors
become larger. We had about three bad mis
takes while the other teams maybe just had
one or two."
One of those mistakes came in the fifth
race. After tailing off a bit from their impres-
