The Stanford field hockey team heads
into battle for second place in the Northern
Pacific Conference with University of Pacific
today after it split its two weekend exhibition
games. The Cardinal crushed Santa Clara
11-0 on Friday, but got trampled by the
Stanford alumni team 5-0 on Saturday.
The game will be the third time the Car
dinal faces the Tigers this season. Senior
midfielder Elise Morgan's two goals pro
pelled Stanford to a 2-1 victory in their first
meeting on Sept. 24. In their Oct. 8 match,
the Cardinal, playing without Morgan, suf

fered a 3-1 loss.
"We're more ready for them this time,"
said freshman goalie Kelly Nay lor. "We took
the second game for granted. We relaxed."
The game will not have any playoff impli
cations because California has already
wrapped up the NorPac Championship. The
winner will play California in the NorPac
Championship on Thursday.
"It's a pride thing," said senior tri-captain
Tina Syer. "[The game] carries a lot of
weight because it could be my last game."
The Cardinal has to be aggressive and
focus on its game plan of taking more shots,
said head coach Sheryl Johnson.
Stanford got a lot of practice this week
end. In both contests, on the team
received significant playing time and many
of the players were put in different positions.
On Friday, the Cardinal repeated the
score of its first meeting with Santa Clara on
Oct. 9. Stanford's defense dominated the
game, holding Santa Clara to no shots on
goal.
"We played well," said junior tri-captain
Leah Jacobs. "We took a lot of shots and had

On Saturday, the captains wen

put in charge of the team as they
faced Johnson and the alumni team.
"It was excellent practice," said
Naylor. "Their passing and ball han
dling are excellent. They were really
goal hungry and absolutely fearless."
Kathy Levinson scored twice

and Valerie Jackson, 1989 All-
American, and two-time All-Amer
ican Sara Hallock each added a goal
for the alumni. Hallock was the
Cardinal's leading scorer and Nor-
Pac Flayer of the Year last year.
Now the Cardinal turn their

attention to Pacific in their bid to
get into the NorPac Championship
game.
"We need to go in with a lot of
confidence," said junior tri-captain
Leah Jacobs. "We need to play con
sistently."
