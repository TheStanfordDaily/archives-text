# Frats, co-ops struggle to keep cleaner houses
## University begins stricter enforcement 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Co-operative and fraternity houses will
have to follow a stricter set of cleanliness
guidelines this year â€” a change that has agi
tated several house managers on the Row
who contend that the standards were
changed without prior warning.
Students say they have already paid in
fines what they used to pay for an entire quar
ter, and they are now spending several more
hours on their housekeeping duties.
Phi Delta Theta house manager Jay
Cairns said the University expects them to
have "perfectly white walls" and that resi
dents are "constantly sweeping."
Cairns said that with 600 people in their
house on the weekends, some of the stan
dards are "really unattainable."
This change, however, is not part of a new
University policy, but rather an increased ef
fort to enforce existing guidelines.
"There are no new standards (this year],"
said Diana Conklin, associate director of Res
idential Education. "We have talked with
Housing and Dining about bringing houses
up to the standards that have always exist
ed."
Existing standards require that, among
other things, trash cans are emptied daily,
spills are cleaned immediately and the resi
dence is generally well-maintained.
If a house fails to meet these standards, it

could be required to use and pay for the Uni
versity cleaning service.
Amy Rickerson, house manager at the co
op house Enchanted Broccoli Forest, said
that before the beginning of this year, she was
under the assumption that the standards
were going to be the same as last year.
"I think we should have been helped into
the new policy," she said. The standards are
"much tougher," she added. "We're very
upset about it."
Rickerson said fire marshals have come
every week to EBF, as opposed to only a cou
ple times per quarter last year. She said the
fire marshal pointed out several things which
"weren't even fire hazards or fire-related."
"At 8 a.m., we have people vacuuming our
halls [and] cleaning our bathroom," she said,
adding that she was still unclear as to what
constituted a violation.
Janyce Prothro, director of student man
agers for Row houses, said, "We entrust mil
lions of dollars in these houses to stu
dents. ... We have to make sure they're up to
standard."
She added that the University has "spelled
out exactly what's to be expected" in housing
manuals given to house managers at the be
ginning of the year.
"It's the University's responsibility to pro
vide a safe and healthy environment. . .[but]
residents handle the day-to-day manage-
ment," Prothro said. "If they
don't correct [problems], the Uni
versity comes to do it for them" at
a price.
Although Rickerson is still
currently negotiating fines with
the University, she estimated
that so far this year, EBF has
already been charged $60 to $70
for not meeting University stan
dards.
At the Legal Counseling
Office, coordinator Jewell Hud
son said the University has to be
very specific with what they are

going to do with the students'
money.
"They have to say, 'We're
going to serve you in this way,' "
she said. "It seems to me, though,
that if it's your area (house),
there should be some give and
take."
Recently, the University has
also encouraged co-ops and fra
ternities to hire the University
cleaning service, which would
cost each student in a house $90
per quarter.
"That's being given as an
option, but it's not mandatory,"
Prothro said.
Currently, co-ops are distin
guished from self-ops in that co
ops not only hire their own cook

ing staff but also provide for their
own cleaning services.
Delta Tan Delta and Alpha
Sigma are two houses that
switched to the University clean
ing service this year.
Delt house manager Kurt Crit
er said residents "have been real
ly happy with the change" and
that the house "now looks incred
ible." He added, however, that
they were not allowed to seek an
off-campus cleaning service.
"We're completely regulated
on what we do and don't do," he
said. "Everything has to go
through the University."
"There are definitely different
standards than last year," said
Terra house manager Todd

Neller. University officials in
formed house managers that if
the co-ops had too many viola
tions, they "would be turned into
dorms," he said.
"I think the University used
threatening tactics to encourage
co-ops to shape up," Neller added.
Although he finds most of the
guidelines reasonable, Neller said
he has received complaints from a
few residents that their co-op is
being held to higher standards
than those applied to dorms.
Hudson said that if residents
are truly unhappy about the
University's actions, respective
house managers "should have a
meeting" to voice their con
cerns.
