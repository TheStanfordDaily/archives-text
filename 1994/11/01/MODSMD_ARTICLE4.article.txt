# Frats, co-ops struggle to keep cleaner houses
## University begins stricter enforcement 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Co-operative and fraternity houses will
have to follow a stricter set of cleanliness
guidelines this year â€” a change that has agi
tated several house managers on the Row
who contend that the standards were
changed without prior warning.
Students say they have already paid in
fines what they used to pay for an entire quar
ter, and they are now spending several more
hours on their housekeeping duties.
Phi Delta Theta house manager Jay
Cairns said the University expects them to
have "perfectly white walls" and that resi
dents are "constantly sweeping."
Cairns said that with 600 people in their
house on the weekends, some of the stan
dards are "really unattainable."
This change, however, is not part of a new
University policy, but rather an increased ef
fort to enforce existing guidelines.
"There are no new standards (this year],"
said Diana Conklin, associate director of Res
idential Education. "We have talked with
Housing and Dining about bringing houses
up to the standards that have always exist
ed."
Existing standards require that, among
other things, trash cans are emptied daily,
spills are cleaned immediately and the resi
dence is generally well-maintained.
If a house fails to meet these standards, it

could be required to use and pay for the Uni
versity cleaning service.
Amy Rickerson, house manager at the co
op house Enchanted Broccoli Forest, said
that before the beginning of this year, she was
under the assumption that the standards
were going to be the same as last year.
"I think we should have been helped into
the new policy," she said. The standards are
"much tougher," she added. "We're very
upset about it."
Rickerson said fire marshals have come
every week to EBF, as opposed to only a cou
ple times per quarter last year. She said the
fire marshal pointed out several things which
"weren't even fire hazards or fire-related."
"At 8 a.m., we have people vacuuming our
halls [and] cleaning our bathroom," she said,
adding that she was still unclear as to what
constituted a violation.
Janyce Prothro, director of student man
agers for Row houses, said, "We entrust mil
lions of dollars in these houses to stu
dents. ... We have to make sure they're up to
standard."
She added that the University has "spelled
out exactly what's to be expected" in housing
manuals given to house managers at the be
ginning of the year.
"It's the University's responsibility to pro
vide a safe and healthy environment. . .[but]
