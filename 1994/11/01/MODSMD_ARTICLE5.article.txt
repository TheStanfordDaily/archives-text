# Stanford buys LSD guru Leary's letters
## 
### Tristan Sorah Reyes 
Letters to Timothy Leary, a former
Harvard University professor and lead
ing figure of the 1960s counterculture,
from his then-wife Rosemary have found
a new home at Stanford.
The 74 letters purchased last week by
the University were written by Rose
mary Leary to her husband — widely
known as "the psychedelic drug guru"
who advocated using LSD as the path to
greater self-awareness — while he was in
a San Luis Obispo prison in 1970.
"The letters are of interest to us be
cause they reflect on the culture of the
time and are a slice of the time, a special

moment in two people's lives," said
Katherine Martinez, curator for Ameri
can / British History for the University
Libraries.
Martinez purchased the letters for
$1,900 from the Pacific Book Auction
Gallery in San Francisco.
"Even though the letters are dated
1970 they give a real sense of the '605,"
Martinez said. At the time, Leary
worked as a clinical psychologist and re
searcher, doing the majority of his re
search on psychedelic drugs at Harvard
and UC-Berkeley.
Martinez said the letters give a dis
tinctive perspective on the events of the
time. While Leary was in prison, various

groups protested his conviction and
Rosemary Leary, acting on her hus
band's behalf, made speeches and partic
ipated in protests designed to free him.
"The letters provide an interesting
look at the Learys' relationship, while
presenting an opportunity to examine a
private view on the world at that time,"
Martinez said.
The letters demonstrate Leary's in
fluence on the '60s while delineating his
wife's activities at the same time, Mar
tinez added.
Among other things, the letters dis
cuss events Rosemary Leary attended in
her husband's honor, a time when she
met John Lennon and Yoko Ono,
articles about Leary in "Rolling
Stone," her desire to go on a carrot
diet, the couple's horoscopes, and
celebrities and friends of theirs
who were joining communes.
The Learys moved in a circle of
people who were also heavily
involved in the activism of the
'60s. According to The New York
Times, one of the letters reads:
"I'm calling Joan Baez on Monday,
Gracie Slick went to the White
House for a lunch reunion tea with
Tricia Nixon and took Abie Hoff
man as her bodyguard. He had a
suit and tie. They wouldn't let him
in, so Gracie declined."
The letters will join a growing
collection of primary sources
which provide Stanford students

and faculty with material for
research about the '60s, Martinez
said. During the summer, the Uni
versity also acquired a collection of
personal correspondence and writ
ings of '60s beat poet Allen Gins
burg, the author of "Howl."
Martinez said the Leary pur
chase has special benefits. "Any
time the opportunity presents itself
to acquire something such as let
ters, that aren't meant for a wide
readership, it's great," she said.
The letters, she added, give
Rosemary Leary's unique point
of view as a woman active in the
counterculture. She played an
important role in Leary's career;
the pair operated as a team.
"The letters provide an inti
mate view of time and place,"
Martinez said. "They show the
sense of energy and excitement of
the activities going on with the
countercultural movement of the
time."
