Letters to Timothy Leary, a former
Harvard University professor and lead
ing figure of the 1960s counterculture,
from his then-wife Rosemary have found
a new home at Stanford.
The 74 letters purchased last week by
the University were written by Rose
mary Leary to her husband — widely
known as "the psychedelic drug guru"
who advocated using LSD as the path to
greater self-awareness — while he was in
a San Luis Obispo prison in 1970.
"The letters are of interest to us be
cause they reflect on the culture of the

Gallery in San Francisco.
"Even though the letters are dated
1970 they give a real sense of the '605,"
Martinez said. At the time, Leary
worked as a clinical psychologist and re

search on psychedelic drugs at Harvard
and UC-Berkeley.
Martinez said the letters give a dis
tinctive perspective on the events of the
time. While Leary was in prison, various

groups protested his conviction and
Rosemary Leary, acting on her hus
band's behalf, made speeches and partic
ipated in protests designed to free him.
"The letters provide an interesting
look at the Learys' relationship, while
presenting an opportunity to examine a
private view on the world at that time,"
Martinez said.
The letters demonstrate Leary's in
fluence on the '60s while delineating his
wife's activities at the same time, Mar
tinez added.
Among other things, the letters dis

her husband's honor, a time when she
