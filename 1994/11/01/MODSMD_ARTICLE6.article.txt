# Art history goes high-tech Prof brings classic paintings on-line
## 
### Tracy Jan 
Thanks to Art Prof. Michael Marrinan, the
line between "fuzzy" and "techie" is gradual
ly diminishing where art history is concerned.
As the department "techie," Marrinan
spent last summer scanning slides of late
18th-century art onto a server to develop
Stanford's first "On-Line Study Image Sys
tem".
The new technology — which debuted this
quarter in conjunction with Marrinan's class,
Art 1208, "The Age of Revolution" — will
allow students to call onto the computer
screen works of art they have studied in class.
Dcr.ionstrating the on-line system, Marri
nan called to the screen of his Macintosh
Powerbook impressive color images of 18th
century French, English and Spanish art.

"Our immediate goal is to make it easier
for students to review course notes, to facili
tate inter-student discussions when studying
together and to alleviate some of the usual
anxiety about recording dates, names and ti
tles during lectures," Marrinan said.
"Our long-term goal is to help students
concentrate on the principal material of art
history — works of art — without being
bogged down in the mechanics of rote memo
rization," he added.
His students can now take careful notes
during lecture and go back later to review the
images, since they come up in the exact order
as shown in class, he said.
"The program is convenient to use from
your residence," said Senior Derek Powell, a

student taking the class. "The lec
ture by lecture format is good for
getting the historical background
correct."
The image system, however,
does not try to recreate Marri
nan's lectures for students who
may have missed class. The pro
gram installation is text poor,
meaning only pictures and titles
come up on screen.
Marrinan does not want the
computer to provide a replace
ment for classroom lectures.
"You come to Stanford for a
reason — to take good classes
with esteemed faculty in a live
lecture situation," he said. "The
computer serves as an additional

tool to open new arenas for learn
ing. Art 1208 is not a canned
course."
According to Marrinan, the
program just "makes it possible
for students to revisit the imagery
and takes away the anxiety."
This program is available only
to students in Art 1208 because of
the copyright.
Senior Bethany Smith said she
is "impressed with the detail of
the images."
Since she lives in Casa Italiana,
however, where the only two com
puters in the cluster are black
and-white, "it is difficult when the
slides are not in color," she said.
Smith added that while the on
line images are innovative, they
are most useful when shown on a
color screen.
"As a system it's a good idea
but you really need a color moni
tor to get the most out of it," she

said.
Powell agreed on the impor
tance of a color monitor.
"The quality of the images is
acceptable but not great" on his
black and white computer, he
said. "The slides in class are bet
ter, but I like the convenience of
this program."
In the past, students have had
to go to the library and borrow
black and white photographs,
which were expensive to repro
duce and wore out easily. With
this new system, images are more
accessible.
"The old black and white pho
tos weren't high quality," said
junior Jessica Schneider. "I like
the new system because the slides
are in the correct order and all the
spelling is right."
Schneider downloaded the
entire program onto a disk and
found no problems getting onto

the program.
Marrinan hopes that down the
road, every art history course
taught at Stanford will have
accompanying computer images,
he said.
He had envisioned the merging
between art and technology at
Stanford for a while but was
unable to realize his dream until
this year because scanners are
expensive, he added.
But the Bing Grant — given to
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences this year in order to foster
innovative teaching techniques
using technology — allowed Art
History to buy a Nikon scanner
for $2,000.
"Art is a major part of our
contemporary existence," Marri
nan said. "Connections exist
between all forms of art"
whether it be traditional studio
art or multimedia.
