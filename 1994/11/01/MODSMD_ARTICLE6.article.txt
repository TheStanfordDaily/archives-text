Thanks to Art Prof. Michael Marrinan, the
line between "fuzzy" and "techie" is gradual
ly diminishing where art history is concerned.
As the department "techie," Marrinan
spent last summer scanning slides of late
18th-century art onto a server to develop
Stanford's first "On-Line Study Image Sys
tem".
The new technology — which debuted this
quarter in conjunction with Marrinan's class,
Art 1208, "The Age of Revolution" — will
allow students to call onto the computer
screen works of art they have studied in class.
Dcr.ionstrating the on-line system, Marri
nan called to the screen of his Macintosh
Powerbook impressive color images of 18th
century French, English and Spanish art.

"Our immediate goal is to make it easier
for students to review course notes, to facili
tate inter-student discussions when studying
together and to alleviate some of the usual
anxiety about recording dates, names and ti
tles during lectures," Marrinan said.
"Our long-term goal is to help students
concentrate on the principal material of art
history — works of art — without being
bogged down in the mechanics of rote memo
rization," he added.
His students can now take careful notes
during lecture and go back later to review the
images, since they come up in the exact order
as shown in class, he said.
"The program is convenient to use from
your residence," said Senior Derek Powell, a
