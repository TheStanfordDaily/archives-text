## Farm ranked 20th in gifts

In its recently-released annual "Philanthropy
400" listing of private giving to large organizations,
the bi-weekly Chronicle of Philanthropy has ranked
Stanford 20th in total amounts of donations received.
The Chronicle ranked 400 institutions, including
such charitable groups as the Salvation Army and the
American Red Cross, as well as 141 colleges and uni
versities. Out of the 400 organizations, Harvard
ranked 11th, while the University of Pennsylvania
took 16th, and Cornell, 19th.
"It's an honor for Stanford to be ranked so high
among the nation's leading organizations," said
David Glen, director of principal gifts for Stanford's
Office of Development.
He added that the national institutions listed in
the Chronicle are able to draw upon millions of
donors nationwide, while Stanford draws on an
alumni population of only 150,000-200,000.
Being ranked 20th on a list that primarily includes
national institutions with larger donor bases is a
"testament to the quality of Stanford and its ability
to raise money," Glen said. "The fact that people
want to give to this university is a tribute."
Thanks to efforts in several areas, Stanford's do
nations have been steadily rising from $29 million in
1968 to a record $226 million last year.
The emphasis University President Gerhard
Casper places on alumni donations, the implementa
tion of the Stanford Fund and the recent five-year
Stanford Centennial campaign, which ended in 1992,
have all been major factors.
While Glen said the Chronicle's ranking is a com
pliment, he pointed out that "it's more important to
be compared with similar institu
tions, such as the major research
oriented universities."
When compared to such uni
versities, Stanford has consistent
ly ranked in the top five. Last
year, the University ranked third
in gift receipts, just behind Har
vard and the University of Penn
sylvania.
Stanford hopes to continue its
upward trend with specific plans.
"We have to continue focusing on

communicating with alumni and
letting them know we care what
tljey think," Glen said. "We have
to create an environment where
people want to give."
To this end, Stanford has insti
tuted several programs, such as
the expanded reunions which
allow alumni to return for two
and a half days and attend classes.
The Chronicle's ranking of
Stanford is an indication these
efforts are making a difference,
Glen said.
"We're pleased that donations
are steadily increasing," he said.
"We've got a ways to go, but its
paying off."
