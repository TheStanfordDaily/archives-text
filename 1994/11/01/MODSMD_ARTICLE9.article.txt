# Checking their pay
## Grad students get refunds for improper deductions 
### Pamela Phan 
In an attempt to reimburse graduate students for
deductions mistakenly taken from their paychecks,
the University's Payroll Office is now returning
hundreds of dollars in refunds.
Several graduate students who worked as teach
ing assistants while they were registered at Stanford
discovered that taxes for the Federal Insurance
Compensation Act (FICA) and Volunteer Disability
Insurance (VDI) were incorrectly withheld from
their paychecks.
Erik Lofgren, a graduate student in the Asian
Languages Department, first detected the error
when he realized that the University had stopped
making deductions he originally considered nor
mal.
Since then he has learned that anyone who
works as a registered student at the University
should automatically be exempt from these deduc
tions, he said. These taxes should not legally be
withheld.
Every summer and fall, the Payroll Office receives
listings regarding registration status through the
Network for Student Information, and sometimes
late registrants do not appear on the listings. As a
result, some students often fail to benefit from the
exemption, said Mike Silva, payroll supervisor.
"We've had to tighten up," Silva said. "We want
ed to make sure we were in strict compliance [with
IRS regulations]."
Although students were annoyed that they were
not told about the incorrect deductions, Silva said

the Payroll Office cannot do anything unless a grad
uate student who is affected by this policy notifies
the office of his or her exemption status.
"The Payroll Office is not actively publicizing this
[policy]," Lofgren said.
Many students are not aware that they have a
sizable amount of money waiting to be refunded to
them. According to Paul Atkins, a graduate student
in Japanese literature, "graduate students seem to
be learning about this by word-of-mouth."
Students who believe they qualify for exemption
can contact Brigid Bunch at the Payroll Office, Lof
gren said. Not all graduate students are immediate
ly eligible. The exemption only applies to those who
have registered and had taxes withheld from their
paycheck for FICA and VDI.
The number of refunds issued by the Payroll
Office has been relatively small so far. According to
Lofgren, the process of reimbursement is relatively
easy.
"I had absolutely no problems with Payroll. They
were extremely supportive," he said. "It was unbe
lievably good service."
Undergraduates may also be able to benefit from
the tax exemption.
The two taxes that are withheld from a worker's
paycheck are put into effect as a mandatory require
ment by law. FICA is the Social Security plan used
by the University. A total of 7.65 percent of the pay
check is deducted to pay for the two parts of FICA â€”
Old-Age Survivor Disability Insurance and Medi
care. Only 0.9 percent of a worker's paycheck is
deducted for Volunteer Disability Insurance.
