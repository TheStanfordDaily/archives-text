isa Wang, BSIT University ot
California San Diego '92. often stops by
-jfQI'ALCOMM's I'itness ('.enter after work
for a game of tennis. I get so mentally
involved with the backplane I'm working on. I
need physical exertion to bring me back to earth.

Center —the company is. after all, run by engineers. *
"They also understand that some people do better
early in the day and others later," continues Lisa. "So they developed a Flex-Time
policy that lets people set their own hours." What does she enjoy most about
being a QI'ALCOMM engineer? "You can make cool stuff like on The Jetsons®"
