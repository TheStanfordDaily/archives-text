Rep. Michael Huffington
planned.
Originally, the Republican
congressman — who gradu

headlines again yesterday
with Huffington's allegations
that a member of the Fein

nanny's husband into dis

and tax status.
Huffington claimed that a

offer of a green card and work
for life in return for publiciz-
