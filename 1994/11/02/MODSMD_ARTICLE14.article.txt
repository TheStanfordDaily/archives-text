LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) â€” Negotia
tors were buoyant yesterday after ini
tialing a new Angolan peace agreement,
but rebel hard-liners said government
attacks threaten efforts to end the 19-
year civil war.
The rebels and the government ini
tialed the document Monday night,
committing themselves to a formal sign
ing on Nov. 15. A cease-fire is to take
effect two days after the signing.
"Angola is finally returning to the
happiness it knew in 1975. The way to
peace has been long, but we're con
vinced that arms will be put down with
the signing of the protocol," said Fausti
no Muteka, who represented the gov
ernment at the protracted talks in the
Zambian capital.

Euginio Manuvakola, who represent
ed the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, or
UNITA, was equally optimistic at an
evening news conference in Lusaka.
Only U.N. mediator Alioune Blondin
Beye alluded to the continued fighting.
"I urge both sides to show military
restraint to alleviate the suffering of the
people," Beye said.
In a joint statement, the U.S., Rus
sian and Portuguese governments also
urged both sides "on an urgent basis to
refrain from all hostile military activi
ties" so that a U.N. peacekeeping force
could be deployed quickly. The three
were "observer countries" in the negoti
ations.
Stung previously by peace treaties

that fell apart, Angolans in the capital,
Luanda, said they would wait for proof
that this one was real.
"The hearts of the Angolan people
cannot bear any more false hope,"
policeman Joao Malicia said. "We'll
know when there is peace ... and every
one will cry" for joy.
A high-ranking rebel official told
reporters his fighters would abandon
the peace accord if the government did
not immediately halt a military offen
sive that has pushed to within 19 miles
of a rebel stronghold in Huambo.
Paulo Lukamba Gato, a UNITA
hard-liner, spoke to reporters in Huam
bo as government fighter jets roared
nearby, the Portuguese news agency
LUSA reported.
