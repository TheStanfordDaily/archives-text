# U.S. forces show strong resolve
## Warplanes drop 55,000 pounds of bombs in air force practice 
### 
KUWAIT (AP) - U.S. war
planes dropped 55,000 pounds of
bombs on burned-out Iraqi tanks
and other desert targets yesterday
in exercises designed to show allied
resolve to protect Kuwait.
Two B-52s and a pair of B-l
bombers led more than 100 war
planes in the biggest allied air force
exercise in several years. American
A-10 Thunderbolt tank-killing jets
and British and French combat
planes also took part.
Kuwait's defense minister,
Sheik Ahmed al-Humoud al-Sabah,
applauded as the B-52s dropped
500-pound bombs on simulated tar
gets in Kuwait's northern desert,
including burned-out Iraqi tanks
left from the 1991 Gulf War.
Allied warplanes also buzzed
northern Kuwait and the "no-fly
zone" over southern Iraq, below
the 32nd parallel. No incidents
were reported despite Iraqi
protests that the exercises were
provocative and illegal.
The air exclusion zone in south
ern Iraq was imposed in August

1992 to help protect Shiite Muslim
rebels from the forces of Iraqi Pres
ident Saddam Hussein.
Coalition aircraft have been
operating from bases in Saudi Ara
bia and Turkey to monitor the no
fly zone and a similar exclusion
zone in northern Iraq.
"If our neighbor to the north . . .
is considering an aggression
against Kuwait, this is a message
for him," Sheik Ahmed said as he
watched the exercises from a tent
erected on the Udairi Range, 25
miles east of the Iraqi border.
In Washington, Pentagon
spokesman Cmdr. Joe Gradisher
said the four American bombers
dropped a total 55,000 pounds of
bombs. The B-l bombers flew 25
hours from Ellsworth Air Force
Base, S.D., and the B-52s flew 29
hours from Minot Air Force Base,
N.D. to participate.
The warplanes scored hits on
the blackened hulks of Iraqi tanks
and vehicles strewn across the
desert, kicking up billowing clouds
of smoke and dust.

Scores of military exercises have
been held at the Udairi Range since
the emirate signed 10-year defense
pacts with the United States,
Britain, France and Russia after
the Gulf War.
On Monday, Iraq denounced the
aerial exercises, which followed the
allies' largest military deployment
in the region since the Gulf War to
counter an Iraqi military buildup
north of the border last month.
Iran's deputy speaker of parlia
ment, Hassan Rohani, said yester
day the allied maneuvers were an
"aggression that contravenes all
international laws and principles"
because they included Iraqi
airspace, state-run Tehran Radio
said in a broadcast monitored in
Cyprus.
About 30,000 allied personnel,
along with warships and combat
aircraft, were moved into the gulf
region after Saddam massed more
than 64,000 troops, including two
divisions of his elite Republican
Guard, near the Kuwaiti border in
early October.
