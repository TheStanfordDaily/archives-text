## Editorials Eshoo for Congress 
### 
IN THE 14TH Congressional Dis
trict, freshman U.S. Rep. Anna
Eshoo (D-Atherton) has shown
herself to be both dynamic and effec
tive these past two years — and she
easily deserves at least two more.
Eshoo, who is running against
Republican investment banker Ben

Brink, has proven her com
mitment to this district in sev
eral ways.
Just last year, she played
an instrumental role in bring
ing a $238 million research
project to Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, a move

that saved hundreds of jobs at SLAC.
Her backing of the SLAC B-facto
ry project is also indicative of her
genera] support for high-tech indus
try here in Silicon Valley. In addition,
Eshoo helped secure federal funds to
increase the number of police offi
cers in nearby East Palo Alto.
Eshoo courageously supported

NAFTA despite high pressure to
vote against it. And she has fought
hard for reforms in both campaign
finance and her specialty area,
health care.
Those latter two national goals
have yet to be accomplished. But re
electing Eshoo, an ardent supporter

of both, will go a long way
toward ensuring a speedy
and effective resolution in
these areas.
Eshoo has been an ardent
supporter of reproductive
rights, has advanced pro
gressive policies and has

proven responsive to the needs of
her district time and again.
As a freshman congresswoman,
Eshoo has accomplished a substan
tial amount for the 14th District.
With that in mind, voters should
support her Nov. 8 — because as a
returning member, she will only be
able to do more.
