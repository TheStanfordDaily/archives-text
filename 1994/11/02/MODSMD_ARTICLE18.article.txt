# Miller for Secretary
## 
### 
FEW VOTERS KNOW much
about the Secretary-of-State
candidates or the job they are
seeking. The position basically
involves administering elections; it
is technical and apolitical and sel
dom leads to higher office. Yet
Democrat Tony Miller and Republi
can Bill Jones both want it.
Miller is clearly more qualified.
After 16 years on staff, he became
acting Secretary of State when
March Fong Eu resigned. Miller
has pushed for lobbyist-reporting
and voter-registration reforms.
Recently, he checked the tobacco
industry's deceptive push for
Proposition 188.
Jones claims Miller represents
business as usual and that voter
turnout declined during Miller's
watch. But such problems really run
much deeper than the Secretary of
State.
Jones touts his authorship of Cali
fornia's three-strikes law as an exam
ple of his leadership skills. Yet he

didn't really author the law; he mere
ly sponsored legislation that copied
Proposition 184. Moreover, the law is
poorly drafted and is not the best
three-strikes approach available.
There is a final issue. Miller is gay
and could become the first openly
gay statewide elected official. Miller
is making no mention of the issue,
and the gay community has hardly
united behind his campaign. Simi
larly, and to his credit, Jones calls
the issue irrelevant.
But some right-wing extremists
disagree. The Committee on Moral
Concerns claims Miller will push
"the homosexual agenda." This
claim isn't just bigoted; it's ludi
crous. The Secretary of State's
office has as much to do with gay
rights policy as it does with crimi
nal sentencing laws like three
strikes â€” nothing.
The job requires attention to
detail, experience and know-how.
Miller offers that, and his sexual ori
entation should not be an issue.
