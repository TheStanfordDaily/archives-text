## The 						risk of getting personal 
### 
"Why would you want to be personal
with me?"
â€” David Mamet's "Oleanna "
IN "FROSH," THE documentary
filmed during the 1990-91 school year
at Stanford, there is one particularly
painful scene where a student attending
office hours is told by her Cultures, Ideas
and Values instructor, "Debbie, you're
blathering." The man knows the camera is
watching. His comment is calculated. And
his power play succeeds in rendering the
student speechless.
Every time I replay this scene in my
mind it becomes more absurd. Why does a
teacher feel the need to humiliate a stu
dent?
Last week, I heard of another inci
dent where the playful, interactive
style of a teaching assistant in Econ 1
turned into a similarly abusive perfor
mance. While throwing questions out
to the class, the teaching assistant sup
posedly noticed a female student run
ning her hands through her hair. Then
he mimicked the motion and said,
"Does that help you women think?"
Later in the class period, a different
woman made a similar gesture while
asking a question about the economics
material. Ignoring the question, the TA
chose instead to ask her why she need
ed to concentrate on her hair like that.
The student's reply was admirably
smart: "I was concentrating on the
question. You were thinking about my
hair."

These events are so sharply con
tentious, and so absolutely inappropriate,
that we cling to the belief that they are
unfortunate aberrations. Yet according to
the Women's Needs Assessment Study
Group, whose report was published (and
largely ignored) in 1992, events like these
occur with astonishing regularity. In one
striking example, a graduate student
heard her department chair state, "Once
you have a child, you lose your brain." In
another, a woman recalls the three men on
her friend's dissertation committee. "All
three had made passes at her at some point
in her graduate career," the report says.
Though profoundly disturbing, the
problematic attitudes at work here are not
simply the result of male nerve. Instead,
they reveal a definitive lack of recognition
and understanding toward personal issues
as they affect our lives within the Univer
sity. The WNA report cites students' "diffi
culty in talking with advisors about the
conditions surrounding their studies. . .
which many advisors do not credit as real
istic and understandable obstacles [italics
mine]."
When these advisory relationships
are between men and women, the task
of addressing personal involvement
becomes even more difficult. Female
students feel unable to speak conversa
tionally with their male instructors;
teachers fear their interest will be mis
construed. One professor told me that
none of his colleagues will deal with
students outside of the classroom, and

in this inhibited and suspicious envi
ronment I am not surprised. It is sim
ply too risky.
The point is, however, that we have
to take the risk. Because until we do,
incidents like those recounted above will
continue to infect our classrooms and
our laboratories and our lives, creating
situations where students feel "less
than," or as the WNA states,
"demeaned, disgusted, stupid, self-con
scious, overpowered, ignored, mini
mized, trivialized and marginalized."
We must recognize that as students and
teachers, we are more than mere func
tionaries of information. We are not
simply givers and receivers of knowl
edge, witnessing each other's combative
displays of intellect; we are not disem
bodied minds.
In saying this, I am reminded of a very
dear and influential teacher who told me
that we often fail to assimilate the truism
that respect must be earned, assuming
instead that age or positions of authority
must be respected for their own sake. She
encouraged me to question authority, but
politely, realizing that even an open and
inquisitive mind is more than just that.
Behind every question there is a whole per
son, and that person is what needs to be
answered.

link David Marnet with "Frosh."
