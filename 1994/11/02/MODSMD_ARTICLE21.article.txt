Prop. 186 is the answer to California's health-care crisis

BRAVO TO INSURANCE company
advertising — they didn't even
have to pay for the ad The Stan
ford Daily published on its editorial page
Oct. 31. At least The Daily saved a few of
the health-care dollars the insurance
companies have been squandering to
defeat 186 — last tallied at close to $4
million.
Not only did your ad/editorial fail to
make any substantive arguments
against 186, it also misrepresented what
Prop. 186 is all about. Let's start with
the facts.
Proposition 186 replaces private
health insurance companies with a sin
gle nonprofit fund that will provide uni
versal coverage to all Californians,
regardless of income, employment status
or age. That not only means that the 6
million currently uninsured Californians
will be insured, but also that no one cur
rently insured can ever lose their insur
ance again. No more will Californians be
denied coverage because of the inability
to pay or "pre-existing" medical condi
tions like AIDS or cancer.
As the editorial mentioned, the bene
fits provided by 186 are extremely gener
ous. All medically necessary services will
be covered, including full mental health
services, long-term disability, prescription
drugs, vision, substance abuse and some
dental care. What the editorial board
ignores is that Prop. 186 provides this
expanded coverage for the same amount
we Californians are already spending on
health care — your oft-repeated $100 bil
lion. It does this by eliminating the insur

ance-company waste and profit now eat
ing up 27 cents of every health-care dollar
spent in California.
The rest of the state's current $100
billion health-care bill will be progres
sively funded by a 2.5 percent income
tax, a 4.4 to 8.9 percent payroll tax, a $1-
a-pack cigarette tax and — what you fail
to mention — by federal health care pro
grams like Medicare and Medi-Cal,
which currently kick in $60 billion per
year to the state of California. You also
fail to mention that the new taxes
replace the more expensive premiums,
co-payments and deductibles that Cali
fornians are now paying out to insur
ance companies each year.
In fact, under Prop. 186, most people
and businesses will spend less on health
insurance than they do today. The total
tax for medical costs for a family of four
with an income of $32,000 and standard
deductions would be $57 per month.
What insurance company will offer full
family coverage for that amount? Prop.
186 puts our state's $40-billion-a-year
health-insurance industry out of busi
ness and uses the more than $10 billion
in savings to pay for expanded coverage.
As for the inaccuracies and misrepre
sentations in your editorial, we'll cite
just a few.
The editorial's comments about the
state health commissioner, for example,
illustrate the illogical and contradictory
thinking behind opposition to Prop. 186.
First you warn of the "frightening
degree of power" that would be wielded
by the health commissioner. And then a

few lines later you complain that health
coverage would be at "the whims of the
electorate, as the office of health com
missioner would be up for re-election
every four years." So which are we sup
posed to be afraid of, the electorate or
the government? Or are you suggesting
that we leave health care in the hands of
insurance-company CEOs?
You also warn of the state's "pathetic
track record" in providing education and
welfare services, but fail to comprehend
one of the key aspects of Prop. 186: All
state legislators will have the same health
insurance that you and I do. Therefore,
when they look out for their own inter
ests, as they always do, they will be look
ing out for our interests as well.
In your indictment of 186, you con
tend that the plan is not economically
feasible. Yet you fail to report that stud
ies by the Government Accounting
Office, the Congressional Budget Office
and the Joint Committee on Taxation of
the U.S. Congress have all said that a
single-payer system — the type Prop.
186 would create for the state of Califor
nia — is the only health reform plan
that can provide universal coverage and
curtail rising health care costs. The text
of Prop. 186 itself has passed the scruti
ny of analysts for the California Ameri
can Association of Retired Persons, the
League of Women Voters, Public Citizen
and Consumers Union, upon whose rec
ommendations, published in Consumer
Reports, Americans buy everything from
cars to computers.
You conclude by suggesting that

health reform is "best left to a compre
hensive and cc operative effort in the state
assembly" as opposed to a "one-time,"
"poorly drafted" "ballot measure" like
Prop. 186. This shows little awareness of
the legislative histoiy behind the Califor
nia Health Security Act. Prop. 186 had its
origins in the Petris Bill, which received
majority votes in the California state sen
ate and assembly. Thanks to insurance
company PAC money, however, the bill
failed to get the two-thirds majority
required to become law.
As we know all too well, health-care
reform has been defeated at the legisla
tive level both nationally and in Califor
nia by unprecedented special-interest
funding. Now, thanks to the work of
thousands of grassroots volunteers
across the state, we have the opportuni
ty to take health-care reform into our
own hands.
So, rather than rely on insurance
company lies, let's look at who supports
Prop. 186. It is endorsed by the state
Democratic Party, Consumers Union,
the California AARP, the League of
Women Voters of California, the Califor
nia Nurses Association, the California
Teachers Association, Public Citizen, the
LIFE AIDS lobby, the California AFL
CIO and numerous other groups.
You say Prop. 186 is "snake oil." We
say it's the cure. Vote yes for Prop. 186.
