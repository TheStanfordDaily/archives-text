## Increasing flight safety New navigation system improves landing accuracy 
### Prithika Balakrishnan 
Commercial airliners may soon
be able to land in fog, rain, and
storms on automatic pilot, thanks
to a navigation system developed by
Stanford aeronautics and astronau
tics researcher Clark Cohen and
graduate students Stewart Cobb,
David Lawrence, and Boris Pervan.
The navigation system, called
the Stanford Integrity Beacon
System, uses the satellites of the
Global Positioning System (GPS)
to track the position of an air
plane within two centimeters of

its actual location.
The system operates by bom
barding an incoming airplane with
radio waves. The waves are
beamed by four or more of the 24
satellites in the Global Positioning
System network, which is used
primarily for military purposes.
Two Stanford-designed ground
transmitters, called integrity bea
con pseudolites, also emit radio
waves identical to those sent out
by the GPS satellites. The pseudo
lites are credit-card sized trans
mitters placed on both sides of the
runway. Using a sophisticated set

of algorithms, the computer
translates these signals to track
the plane's position.
The idea behind the integrity
beacon system germinated four
years ago when Cohen was working
on his Ph.D. at Stanford. He invent
ed a way to determine the exact tilt
of a satellite within one centimeter.
The technology was intended to
facilitate the data-gathering pro
cess for Gravity Probe B, the
NASA-funded mission to test Ein
stein's theory of general relativity.
The invention, however, possessed
navigation possibilities quickly
recognized by Cohen and his facul
ty adviser Bradford Parkinson.
Parkinson contributed his
knowledge of the GPS satellite
system from his experience as an
Air Force colonel. Under his guid
ance, the Stanford team applied
Cohen's idea to developing a land
ing navigation system for com
mercial airplanes. With the help
of FAA funding, the Stanford
team's ideas materialized as the
integrity beacon system.
In the test flights, the plane's
controls were linked to a computer
program designed by the Stanford
team. The program uses informa
tion from GPS signals to fix the air
craft's position and enable it to land
safely, even in weather conditions
that would hamper a human pilot.
The integrity beacon technology

would allow planes to land in heavy
airport traffic, because beacon sig
nals only reach 1,000 feet from the
ground and would not confuse
planes using satellite navigation.
Officials from the Federal Avia
tion Administration say that the
Stanford success may prompt the
adoption of GPS satellite naviga
tion to replace the air traffic control
methods that date to World War 11.
The results of the October tests
and other FAAâ€”sponsored tests
will be presented to the Interna

tional Civil Aviation Organization
in March 1995 in an effort to show
the world's aviation community
the benefits of a satellite-based
system. The new satellite system
would offer cost-effective, safe and
practical replacement for the cur
rent system of air traffic control.
At the meeting, U.S. govern
ment representatives will propose
using GPS, instead of a more
expensive microwave system
opposed by many U.S. airlines.
Despite the dramatic results of

his research, Cohen finds the role
of Stanford students on the pro
ject as important as the world
wide effects of the Integrity Bea
con. "Although there are a lot of
political overtones involved in the
consequences of the system, and
although the players on the larger
scale happen to be governments of
various countries," he said.
"Stanford students, both gradu
ate and undergraduate, played a
key role in the success of the
Integrity Beacon."
