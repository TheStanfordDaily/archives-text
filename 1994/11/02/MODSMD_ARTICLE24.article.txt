# Stanford joins effort to organize Internet
## NSF, universities, and private industry unite to streamline technology

E-mail. Newsgroups. Gopher. Ten years ago,
these words were meaningless, but today they are
integral parts of mainstream Internet vocabulary.
To upgrade access to the vast amount of
information available on the Internet, an inter
national network of computing networks, Stan
ford has received a 3.6 million dollar grant from
the National Science Foundation (NSF).
Stanford professor Terry Winograd is the prin
cipal investigator for the Stanford branch of the
NSF project to organize the Internet. One of six
universities chosen from over 70 proposed
schools, Stanford was awarded the grant in late
September to "come up with new ideas and pro
totypes and test them out," said Winograd.
The Stanford team will consist of three fac
ulty principal investigators, two full-time tech
nical staff members, and several student assis
tants. The research is currently expected to con
tinue for four years, although, according to
Winograd, it is possible that the funders will
expand the intended goals of the project and
extend the time accordingly.
The need to bring order to the information
on the Internet arises from the sheer amount of
data available. The development of the World

Wide Web (WWW), an electronic protocol which
allows users to view hypercard-like combina
tions of text and pictures, offers users easy
access to the information stores. In addition,
libraries all over the world are scanning decay
ing texts into digital facsimiles, preserving the
ancient with the electronic.
With this rapid burgeoning of information
comes an unexpectedly massive organizational
complexity, and a need for a better way to deal
with that complexity. "Our research deals with
ways,„o£ tyiiig. together information sources
through the design of new communication
interfaces," said Winograd.
The networking research community has
been gradually working up from lower level pro
tocols such as basic file transport and represen
tations to higher ones, he added.
Now that the Web and other protocols have
become firmly established, researchers have even
loftier ambitions — like organizing all digital
information so that it is easily available to anyone
who wants to use it.
"It is a further development of the drive
towards universal networked information
access that has been so well illustrated by the
Web," Winograd said. The NSF hopes this
research will lead to a new infrastructure of the

Internet, described by Winograd as an "inte
grated digital library."
Stanford's part in this six-university consor
tium deals with the specific services and inter
faces required to pull together relevant infor
mation from numerous sites on the Internet.
Rather than forcing the user to track his way
through a labyrinth of textual links, the inter
face program would determine the student's
specific needs and retrieve pertinent data from
many different sources at once.
For example, a student seeking information
on the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger
should be able to locate video footage of the dis
aster, voice recordings from the shuttle, Con
gressional committee reports, and newspaper
text of the event from any number of sites
around the Internet. The potential of such a sys
tem—for eveiyone from the low-end user to the
research scientist—is undeniable.
With equipment, money, software and other
materials from partner companies such as Bell-
Core, Hewlett-Packard, WAIS Inc., NASA Ames,
and XEROX PARC, Stanford's team will focus
on the technologies for the digital library, testing
software and interfaces.
Other schools involved in the project, like
UC-Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon, have more
field-specific projects. Berkeley will concentrate
on environmental information, while Carnegie
Mellon is examining digital video with a math
and science focus. The University of Illinois is
responsible for placing a variety of science jour
nals and magazines on the Internet.
The six universities chosen by the NSF were
selected for their computer research community
and industrial partner researchers, Winograd
said. For example, the University of Illinois will
be enlisting the powerful aid of the National Cen
ter for Supercomputing Applications, whereas
the University of Michigan, in examining multi
media applications, will be sponsored by IBM and
Apple.
Still, the universities will retain primary con
trol of the project. A major NSF concern,
according to Winograd, was creating a "concept
that wasn't simply duplicating the kind of prod
uct development that is already going on in the
commercial sector, but that was looking ahead
towards building foundations for the long run."
