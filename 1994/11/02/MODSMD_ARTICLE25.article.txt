A:Although clouds appear
white, water is clear, right?
Almost. It absorbs red light
slightly, which is why if you're
scuba diving or looking at things
at the bottom of a deep lake,
things will look blue. Incidental
ly, the reason the ocean appears
blue is actually primarily
because it's reflecting the blue
light of the sky.
So let's assume that water is
pretty much transparent. How
ever, if you examine a smaller

portion, such as a
raindrop, you see the
colors of the rain.
What's happening
here is that light from
the sun entering the
raindrop is refracted
as it passes through
the drop.
In case you don't
remember from high
school physics, refrac
tion is the effect that
makes a spoon in a
glass of water appear
bent. Basically, light
passing from one sub
stance to another

propagates at different speeds in
the different regions. The light
bends as it travels between the
different media.
So here we go. The light
comes in and bends, then
bounces off the back of the rain
drop, and comes back out again

and bends one more time. Now
here's the trick. Different colors
of light have wavelengths that
bend by different amounts.
(Remember the prism?) So the
colors get separated, and each
one comes out at a certain angle.
An observer viewing this phe
nomenon from a distance sees a
rainbow.
While we're on the topic of
refraction, I can't help but throw
in a juicy tidbit. Beer mug man
ufacturers, and other unscrupu
lous vendors, use refraction to
make it seem like you're getting
more than you actually are. The
curved glass in a mug can work
as a lens; glass of the right thick
ness magnifies the beer, so it
appears that you have more beer

and less glass. Just a
little consumer aware
ness.
So, we've seen that
we can get colors from
water. Now, if we
move even smaller we
can get water to look
white. In clouds, you
have droplets of water
that are very small
and thus more irregu
larly shaped than a
nice raindrop. When
light enters, it
refracts and reflects
many times. When it
finally comes out,

things have gotten mixed up so
much that there is no distinc
tion among the many colors.
Unlike the rainbow, where each
color is at a specific angle, we
have all colors at every angle.


The Science
Bug
And mixing all the colors together
gives us white light.
The same thing actually happens
in a lot of other things that look
white. You probably think (I know I
did) that flour is white. Actually, it's
pretty much transparent, but looks
white for the same reason water
vapor does. Similarly, sugar, salt,
paper and snow are actually clear if
you look closely enough.
You can, however, reverse this
effect by getting substance wet.
For example, if you have a colored
T-shirt and get it wet, it will turn a
much darker color. This is because
the thin fibers were generating a
whitish haze, as explained above,
that made the color seem lighter.
When you get the shirt wet, the
water between the air and fabric
reduces the refraction. This is also
what makes a white T-shirt dan
gerous to wear in the rain.
This should more than answer
your query. I just hope the answer
doesn't take the fun out of staring
out the window at the clouds when
you should be doing work.
