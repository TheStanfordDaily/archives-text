# Blood donors urgently needed
## 
### Julie Sauer Editorial staff 
Even after last week's urgent
appeal for donors, the Stanford
Blood Center still needs dona
tions to bring blood supplies to
normal levels.
Rhoda Burns, associate direc
tor of the Stanford Blood Center,
expressed the importance of
restoring depleted blood supplies
of all types. "We had only half the
level of inventory we like to
keep," Burns said about the sup
plies at the end of October. The
excellent community response to
the call last week yielded blood
donations that pumped levels up
to seventy percent of normal,
where they currently stand, she
added.
Burns said the Center needs to
increase the donor base, because
the same people who donate on a
regular basis cannot respond
every time. The Center is
attempting to increase awareness
about the need for blood among
people who have never considered

donating before.
"It's mostly the fear of the
unknown that keeps people away,"
Burns admitted. The donation pro
cedure uses sterile equipment and
takes only about an hour, and
every donor receives information
on his or her blood type and choles
terol level after the process.
Current hospital conditions
demand all blood types. Any
healthy individual over age 17 is a
potential donor candidate. The
Center's efforts insure that the
donor and the blood are healthy
â€” candidates participate in a
medical screening when they
arrive at the Center.
The current shortage at the
Stanford Blood Center reflects
conditions in neighboring areas,
where there are similar depleted
supplies in San Francisco, San
Jose, Burlingame, and Alameda.
The Stanford shortage can be
attributed to the continued
strong demand at the Stanford
University Hospital and to
changes in the donor base.
Bums points to the reduction of

the work force in Silicon Valley dur
ing the economic downturn. Some
people are relocating, and compa
nies are sponsoring fewer blood
drives. Also, the base of steady
donors may be burned out and
unable to respond to every request.
"We don't want to cry wolf,"
Burns explained. "We only issue an
appeal if it is very necessary." Pre
sent conditions justify the strong
request for blood donations.
Blood donated at the Stanford
Center supplies the Stanford
Hospital and the Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital. Any
extra blood goes to other area
hospitals. However, last week's
severely depleted supplies pre
vented any blood banks from
helping with neighboring short
ages.
The Stanford Blood Center
encourages any interested donors
to call the Center with questions
or to make an appointment for
donating. The Blood Center is
located at 800 Welch Road and
the staff can be reached at (415)
723-7831.
