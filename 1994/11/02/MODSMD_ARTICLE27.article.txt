## This Smurf is no morning cartoon Carmel Murphy doubles as midfielder, player-coach 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
When you watch a women's soc
cer game at Maloney Field, you
might think that number 13 is
actually a player-coach.
Junior Carmel Murphy often
shouts more instructions during
the game than head coach lan
Sawyers. When you've played soc
cer for 16 years and are the daugh
ter of a coach, leadership comes
naturally.
"My dad coached my soccer
team, and he has a great love and
knowledge of the game," said the
central midfielder, who hails from
Leucadia, Calif. "He gave that
knowledge to me also, and I feel like
I understand the game really well."
At age four, Murphy first stepped
on to a soccer field as a forward. She
remained in that position for 11
years, at which time she switched to
midfield. With her creative ability
and leadership skills, the change
proved a rousing success.
"Up at forward, you don't get a
chance to create as much," Mur
phy said. "At midfield, I get to view
everything. I get to connect with
the sweeper and also connect with
the forwards. Sometimes I will
have my back to the goal, but other
times I'll face up. You kind of get
the best of both worlds."
Murphy, however, is not a typi

cal central midfielder. She made
the all-tournament teams at both
the Hartford Courant Cup and
Texas Challenge earlier this sea
son, and was a member of Soccer
America's National "Women's
Team of the Week" for the opening

cial combination of tal
ent and personality. I
couldn't wish to coach
a more open player.'

week of 1994. Unlike many who
play her position, Murphy always
poses a threat to score.
"I think more than other cen
tral midfielders, I'm more offen
sive," Murphy said. "A lot of cen
tral midfielders play laterally more
than what I would. I play direct. I
like to get the balls that are just at
the top of the 18-yard box and fin
ishing those off."
On a team with fellow on-the
field coach Melinda Minstrell and
All-American Jessica Fischer in the
backfield, Murphy is fret; to concen
trate on her offensive game. After
posting nine goals and four assists
last year, she has notched six goals

and one assist in 1994. While her
statistics may have slipped some
what, Murphy is not fazed.
"I feel more confident this year
than I've ever felt in the past," said
the candid Murphy. "I think it's
because with [Julie] Foudy and Raf
[Sarah Rafanelli] gone, okay,
you've got to do it yourself. You've
got to carry the team.
"More than in the past, I always
want the ball, wherever I am.
Whether it's defending, and I'm
going to go in and get it from them,
or if I'm receiving it from Jess [Fis
cher] to start things up on the
offense, or if I'm finishing off the
offense by receiving the ball back
from Erin [Martin] or Emily [Burt]
or a cross from Dena [Dey]. I really
feel like my game has picked up this
year. My mental game has
improved tremendously."
In the past, Murphy benefited from
the tutelage of Foudy, an All-American
central midfielder who graduated in
1992, Murphy's freshman year. Foudy
coined Murphy's current nickname,
"Smurf," and helped the new arrival
mature as a player.
"Because it was my freshman
year and I hadn't had that much
national experience, I was in awe of
Foudy definitely," Murphy said
with her ever-present smile and a
healthy dose of laughter. "I kind of
pointed in her path and I trailed.
Once she left, it was very apparent

to me that she was a huge part of
the team we just lost, and that I'm
going to have to pick it up myself
and take on the role which she had
filled."
Rafanelli, the Cardinal's current
assistant coach and all-time scoring
leader who graduated last year,
agreed that Foudy's influence on
Murphy continues to show.
"Julie Foudy was definitely a
very strong leader for this team
and this program," Rafanelli said.
"I think because Foudy left the
center mid, which was where
I Murphy] played, that was the
time when she really needed to
step up and say, 'I'm going to dom
inate the midfield. I'm going to fill
Julie's void.' Alter doing that, she's
been growing ever since."
Without Foudy or Rafanelli in
uniform, the Cardinal squad
entered 1994 in search of leaders.
Minstrell and Murphy have fit the
bill.
"I think the leadership role has
been huge [this year]," said Mur
phy. "In the past, with Raf and
Foudy, the team depended a lot on
them. I don't know that I'm as
much of a standout as Foudy was,
but we kind of rely on someone who
cannot necessarily dribble the ball
from one end to the other and score
the goals, but who can direct the
