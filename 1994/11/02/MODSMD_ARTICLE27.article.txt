## This Smurf is no morning cartoon Carmel Murphy doubles as midfielder, player-coach 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
When you watch a women's soc
cer game at Maloney Field, you
might think that number 13 is
actually a player-coach.
Junior Carmel Murphy often
shouts more instructions during
the game than head coach lan
Sawyers. When you've played soc
cer for 16 years and are the daugh
ter of a coach, leadership comes
naturally.
"My dad coached my soccer
team, and he has a great love and
knowledge of the game," said the
central midfielder, who hails from
Leucadia, Calif. "He gave that
knowledge to me also, and I feel like
I understand the game really well."
At age four, Murphy first stepped
on to a soccer field as a forward. She
remained in that position for 11
years, at which time she switched to
midfield. With her creative ability
and leadership skills, the change
proved a rousing success.
"Up at forward, you don't get a
chance to create as much," Mur
phy said. "At midfield, I get to view
everything. I get to connect with
the sweeper and also connect with
the forwards. Sometimes I will
have my back to the goal, but other
times I'll face up. You kind of get
the best of both worlds."
Murphy, however, is not a typi

cal central midfielder. She made
the all-tournament teams at both
the Hartford Courant Cup and
Texas Challenge earlier this sea
son, and was a member of Soccer
America's National "Women's
Team of the Week" for the opening

cial combination of tal
ent and personality. I
couldn't wish to coach
a more open player.'

week of 1994. Unlike many who
play her position, Murphy always
poses a threat to score.
"I think more than other cen
tral midfielders, I'm more offen
sive," Murphy said. "A lot of cen
tral midfielders play laterally more
than what I would. I play direct. I
like to get the balls that are just at
the top of the 18-yard box and fin
ishing those off."
On a team with fellow on-the
field coach Melinda Minstrell and
All-American Jessica Fischer in the
backfield, Murphy is fret; to concen
trate on her offensive game. After
posting nine goals and four assists
last year, she has notched six goals

and one assist in 1994. While her
statistics may have slipped some
what, Murphy is not fazed.
"I feel more confident this year
than I've ever felt in the past," said
the candid Murphy. "I think it's
because with [Julie] Foudy and Raf
[Sarah Rafanelli] gone, okay,
you've got to do it yourself. You've
got to carry the team.
"More than in the past, I always
want the ball, wherever I am.
Whether it's defending, and I'm
going to go in and get it from them,
or if I'm receiving it from Jess [Fis
cher] to start things up on the
offense, or if I'm finishing off the
offense by receiving the ball back
from Erin [Martin] or Emily [Burt]
or a cross from Dena [Dey]. I really
feel like my game has picked up this
year. My mental game has
improved tremendously."
In the past, Murphy benefited from
the tutelage of Foudy, an All-American
central midfielder who graduated in
1992, Murphy's freshman year. Foudy
coined Murphy's current nickname,
"Smurf," and helped the new arrival
mature as a player.
"Because it was my freshman
year and I hadn't had that much
national experience, I was in awe of
Foudy definitely," Murphy said
with her ever-present smile and a
healthy dose of laughter. "I kind of
pointed in her path and I trailed.
Once she left, it was very apparent

to me that she was a huge part of
the team we just lost, and that I'm
going to have to pick it up myself
and take on the role which she had
filled."
Rafanelli, the Cardinal's current
assistant coach and all-time scoring
leader who graduated last year,
agreed that Foudy's influence on
Murphy continues to show.
"Julie Foudy was definitely a
very strong leader for this team
and this program," Rafanelli said.
"I think because Foudy left the
center mid, which was where
I Murphy] played, that was the
time when she really needed to
step up and say, 'I'm going to dom
inate the midfield. I'm going to fill
Julie's void.' Alter doing that, she's
been growing ever since."
Without Foudy or Rafanelli in
uniform, the Cardinal squad
entered 1994 in search of leaders.
Minstrell and Murphy have fit the
bill.
"I think the leadership role has
been huge [this year]," said Mur
phy. "In the past, with Raf and
Foudy, the team depended a lot on
them. I don't know that I'm as
much of a standout as Foudy was,
but we kind of rely on someone who
cannot necessarily dribble the ball
from one end to the other and score
the goals, but who can direct the

other people to try and build things
and keep possession. Just having
that focus on the field, someone
you can turn to is really key."
Sawyers believes that people
like Murphy are few and far
between in women's soccer.
"She has a very special and rare
combination of talent and person
ality," Sawyers said. "A lot of the
players coming in now are very
technically sound, but very
mechanical. There's no personali
ty. On the other hand, Carmel
stamps her personality on eveiy
game in which she plays."
Murphy's infectious peppiness,
selfless play and lack of ego sets an
example for the entire Cardinal
squad, according to Sawyers. Fur
thermore, she is always seeking to
improve.
"I couldn't wish to coach a more
open and welcomeable player,"
Sawyers said. "She is always willing
to listen to advice. She's like a
sponge waiting to collect info from
me. That makes my job a lot easier."
Murphy's ability to remain
healthy also gives Sawyers peace of
mind. She had started every game
since her arrival until this year,
when she suffered a broken nose in
September. That injury was one of
a series of major maladies the team
experienced early on, but Murphy
did not stay on the trainer's table

for long. Protective mask and all,
she was back on the field afler an
absence of only two games.
"The only reason [breaking my
nose] threw me off was that I
couldn't play as hard as I wanted,"
she said. "I couldn't go in on head
ers or anything. More than any
thing it was just, 'Get me back out
there. I can't stand sitting on the
sidelines any more."'
After all, on the bench, Murphy
cannot rise to the occasion, with a
knack for the clutch goal, she pro
duced the only score in last year's
victory over Portland that sent the
Cardinal to the Final Four for the
first time. In the Final Four, her
goal kept Stanford even until
penalty kicks sent the Cardinal
home disappointed. This year, all
three of her game-winning goals
have come in tournaments.
While Murphy carried the
offense on her shoulders in Boulder
at the Colorado Tournament two
weekends ago, she could not shake
the team from its recent scoring rut.
After securing only a goal apiece in a
win over San Francisco and a tie to
UCLA, the Cardinal offense finally
broke through in a 6-0 triumph in
Santa Barbara last Sunday.
"All season long we've racked up
over 20 shots per game but scored
maybe two goals," Murphy said. "It
was important for our forwards to
get their confidence up by finishing
a bunch of opportunities."
The offense's resurrection has
lifted Murphy's hopes for the Car
dinal in the upcoming postseason.

"I definitely like our chances,"
she said. "We're not going to be sat
isfied with just a return trip to the
Final Four. I want to win it all."
If the close-knit Cardinal team
lifts the national championship
trophy in the air on Nov. 20,
nobody will be surprised if Murphy
scores the winning goal. If that

happens, don't expect her to talk
much about her MVP award.
"You don't want to play for the
glory or anything," Murphy said.
"You get out on the field and you
want to play for everyone else. You
want to play because you're sur
rounded by your best friends and
want to win for them."
