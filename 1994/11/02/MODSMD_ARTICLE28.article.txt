# Men's golf ready to defend NCAA crown
## 
### Brian Lee 
Rarely in the world of sports
is there occasion to characterize
a team as one of the greatest
ever. This year's Stanford men's
golf team, however, has begun
it's season under the burden of
such lofty praise.
"This team could be the best
collegiate team of all time," said
Richard Poe, head coach of Big
Eight rival Missouri. "It's cer
tainly the best I've ever seen and
in the 20 years that I've coached,
I've seen some great ones."
Defending national champion
Stanford has immediately justi
fied its billing with a No. 1 rank
ing in the current Wilson Coach
es' Poll and victories at the Ping
Preview at Ohio State and, most
recently, at the Jerry Pate Invi
tational in Birmingham, Ala. In
the latter event, the Cardinal
dominated the field en route to a
27-stroke victory over fourth
ranked Auburn, which finished

second. Thus far, highly compet
itive teams such as No. 2 Okla
homa State, No. 3 Georgia Tech,
and No. 4 Oklahoma have fallen
victim to Stanford.
Highly-touted freshman
Eldrick "Tiger" Woods has
already made a significant con
tribution to the team's success.
He leads both the team and the
nation with a 69.6 stroke aver
age. Gaining fame as the
youngest amateur champion in
history, Woods captured the
individual title at Birmingham's
Shoal Creek Country Club,
which until recently remained
closed to African Americans.
The long-awaited arrival of
golfs latest phenom has added
unique pressures and attracted
heavy media scrutiny to the team.
"We could let all the attention get
to us," senior Casey Martin said,
"but I like to think of it more as a
motivating factor."
With most of the attention
focused on Woods, people often over
look the awesome array of talent on
the team, which returns four senior
Ail-Americans in Martin, who fin

ished second at Ohio State, Will
Yanagasawa, Steve Burdick, and
Notah Begay, who won the Savane
College Ail-American Tournament
against an extremely tough field.
"Tiger is great," said Yanaga
sawa, who finished second individu
ally at Birmingham, "but if we're
going to repeat as champions, all five
guys have to be gunning."
