# No player strike here
## Cricket completes season in style 
### Ben Hur 
While the baseball strike was in
progress, Stanford's cricket club com
pleted another successful season, with
the A team finishing fifth and the B
team fourth in the Northern Califor
nia Cricket Association (NCCA).
The A team, which has cap
tured the league title the last two
seasons, started the year winning
its first five games. Led by the
exceptional play of Somit Talwar,
the team eventually finished 8-8.
Behind the excellent batting of
club president Madan Kumar and
the quality "bowling" of Rohan
Chandran, the B team won the
Saturday Cup, a post season event,
for the fourth year in a row.
"Initially, I didn't know what to
expect, but I found the atmosphere
to be great and I really had a good
time playing," Chandran said.
The overall record of each squad
determines its final league standing,
and therefore each regular season
contest bears great significance.
Both Stanford teams played well
throughout the entire season, which
runs from March through October.
Victories over arch rival California
by both Cardinal clubs highlighted
the A and B team campaigns, with
the B team holding the Bears to the
lowest run total amassed by any
league squad during the year.
Cricket holds claim to the
longest history of any team game,
and from it emerged America's
national pastime, baseball. Each
squad consists of 11 players who
take turns batting and fielding.
The object of the batting side is to
score "runs," while the object of the
opposing team is to get the batting

team "out," similar to baseball.
However, the field is oval in shape,
quite different from the traditional
baseball diamond. A white line, called
the "boundary," surrounds the field,
with two sets of "wickets" at each
end of the oval, 22 yards apart, which
represent home plate.
The batsman aims to protect
his wicket, while the "bowler"
(equivalent to a pitcher) attempts
to knock them down. Unlike base
ball, the bowler bounces the ball on
the ground and the batter must hit
the ball off the bounce. Two bats
men stand at either end of the oval
in front of each wicket, although
only one hits at any given time.
Each batsman is given an opportu
nity to hit in any given inning
Runs are scored when a bats
man hits the ball and the two bats
men manage to exchange sides. If a
batsman is able to hit the ball out
side the boundary on the ground,
his team earns four runs. If the
ball sails outside the boundary in
the air, the team receives six runs.
There are two forms of the
game, a two-inning "test match"
and a one-inning version the Car
dinal plays in the NCCA. Key dif
ferences exist between the two. A
test match is played over the
course of five days and a large per
centage of the time, the game ends
in a draw. The one-inning version
is a one day affair which in every
case produces a winner and loser.
According to Kumar, cricket is
in essence a more chess-like ver
sion of baseball, involving much
more strategy. Despite the com
plexities, the Cardinal team is will
ing to accept inexperienced mem
bers.
