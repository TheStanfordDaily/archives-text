# Big Game weekend to include rally, scaled-down bonfire
## 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
While plans for this year's Big Game rally
do not include a 15-story bonfire, the Axe
Committee is making preparations to light a
small fire in its place in Arrillaga Plaza.
"This year's fire will be significantly
smaller," said Axe Committee chair Craig
Zajac, adding that "people who were here
two years ago will not be impressed."
Zajac, a senior, said the 30-member com
mittee has not yet tested the fire out and
therefore could not give an exact size as to
how big it will be. He added, however, that it
would be "less than the size of a room."
Last year, the Big Game bonfire — tradi
tionally held in the dry Lake Lagunita bed —
was canceled because of its questionable ef
fects on the tiger salamanders believed to re
side there. Although not on the endangered
list, the salamanders are considered a threat
ened species.
In place of the bonfire, the Axe Committee
sponsored a laser light show last November

in front of Hoover Tower, which generated a
lackluster response.
Hopes of reinstituting the bonfire were
dashed this summer, when Stanford's Lake
Commission said the bed must remain bon
fire-free indefinitely.
As a result, the committee plans to hold
the Big Game rally at Arrillaga Plaza — lo
cated between the Arrillaga Family Sports
Center and the deGuerre Pool complex —
after the Big Game Gaieties performance on
Nov. 17.
"It will be very different from what we've
done two years ago," Zajac said. "In the past,
the rally hasn't been overly fun or exciting,
but we've always had the bonfire to back it
up. . . . Since there's no bonfire this year,
[the rally is] going to be more of a perfor
mance and have more entertainment."
The lack of a bonfire last year was also be
lieved to be the cause of students' voting
down of the committee's special-fee request
in the ASSU election last spring. The loss of
$29,000 in funding forced the committee to
"cut their budget down immense
ly," according to Zajac.
"Before, our budget (for the
rally] ran up to $16,000. Now, I
believe it's below half of that,"
Zajac said.
He added that committee
members have raised about
$5,000 on their own through such
fund-raising efforts as working at
ASSU Sunday Flicks and putting

up marketing banners at football
games.
Additional funds have also
come from the Athletic Depart
ment and the ASSU Program
Board, Zajac said.
Despite budgetary constraints,
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son said, "It sounds like they're
trying to be pretty creative."
Scheduled to appear at the
rally are the Stanford Band, sev
eral a cappella groups, Dean of
Admissions and Financial Aids
James Montoya and Hal Mickel
son, former voice of the band.
