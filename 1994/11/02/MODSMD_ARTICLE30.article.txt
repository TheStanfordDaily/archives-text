# Alumnus to discuss women sports writers

### Allison Otto 
Not long ago there weren't many women
sports writers. In fact, there was even a time
when there weren't any at all. How could this be
possible, one might ask, when five of the six Bay
Area reporters presently covering the NHL are
women and there are hundreds of women
across the country likewise writing about pro
fessional sports?
Try reading "A Kind of Grace: A Treasury of
Sports Writing by Women," edited by '62 Stan
ford graduate Ron Rapaport and published by
Zenobia Press in order to understand this fairly
recent emergence of women sports writers. Or
better yet, come to Rapaport's noon presenta
tion at the Stanford Bookstore on Nov. 8.
Rapaport, a nationally syndicated sports
columnist for the Los Angeles Daily News and
sports commentator for National Public Radio's
"Weekend Edition" will return to the Farm to

discuss his book along with sportswriters Ann
Killion of the San Jose Mercury News, Joan
Ryan of the San Francisco Chronicle, and
Nancy Levin of the Women's Sports Connec
tion, a publication dedicated solely to women's
sports.
Rapaport's new book is a compilation of 73
articles written by some of the best women
sportswriters in the U.S. and abroad, most of
which primarily focus on female athletes.
"In a way, this book is not representative of
the work women are doing today," writes Rapa
port in his introduction. "Michael Jordan, Pete
Rose, and Joe Montana do not appear in these
pages. Rather, the emphasis is on articles
depicting women athletes and, in many cases,
the problems they have faced in their rise to
prominence."
The pages include profiles of athletes such as
golfer Heather Farr before she died of breast
cancer, written by Betty Cuniberti for Golf

Digest and of determined jockey Mary Bacon, by
Ryan. Rapaport also chose an article detailing
runner Kathy Ormsby's suicide attempt due to
the pressures aimed at success, by Sharon Rob
for the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, and
Miami Herald writer Linda Robertson's profile
Bela Karolyi's "six-pack," the six petite gym
nasts that underwent extremely rigorous train
ing for the '92 Olympics.
A few articles deal with the struggles of
women sports writers. For instance, Kristin
Huckshorn of the San Jose Mercury News wrote
about reporter Lisa Olson's charge that she was
a victim of sexual harassment in the New Eng
land Patriots' locker room. Recently, Huckshorn
told George Vesey of the New York Times, "I
still say that covering sports was the most diffi
cult thing I ever did. You feel so alone."
