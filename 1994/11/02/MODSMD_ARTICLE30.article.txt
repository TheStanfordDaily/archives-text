# Alumnus to discuss women sports writers
## 
### Allison Otto 
Not long ago there weren't many women
sports writers. In fact, there was even a time
when there weren't any at all. How could this be
possible, one might ask, when five of the six Bay
Area reporters presently covering the NHL are
women and there are hundreds of women
across the country likewise writing about pro
fessional sports?
Try reading "A Kind of Grace: A Treasury of
Sports Writing by Women," edited by '62 Stan
ford graduate Ron Rapaport and published by
Zenobia Press in order to understand this fairly
recent emergence of women sports writers. Or
better yet, come to Rapaport's noon presenta
tion at the Stanford Bookstore on Nov. 8.
Rapaport, a nationally syndicated sports
columnist for the Los Angeles Daily News and
sports commentator for National Public Radio's
"Weekend Edition" will return to the Farm to

discuss his book along with sportswriters Ann
Killion of the San Jose Mercury News, Joan
Ryan of the San Francisco Chronicle, and
Nancy Levin of the Women's Sports Connec
tion, a publication dedicated solely to women's
sports.
Rapaport's new book is a compilation of 73
articles written by some of the best women
sportswriters in the U.S. and abroad, most of
which primarily focus on female athletes.
"In a way, this book is not representative of
the work women are doing today," writes Rapa
port in his introduction. "Michael Jordan, Pete
Rose, and Joe Montana do not appear in these
pages. Rather, the emphasis is on articles
depicting women athletes and, in many cases,
the problems they have faced in their rise to
prominence."
The pages include profiles of athletes such as
golfer Heather Farr before she died of breast
cancer, written by Betty Cuniberti for Golf

Digest and of determined jockey Mary Bacon, by
Ryan. Rapaport also chose an article detailing
runner Kathy Ormsby's suicide attempt due to
the pressures aimed at success, by Sharon Rob
for the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, and
Miami Herald writer Linda Robertson's profile
Bela Karolyi's "six-pack," the six petite gym
nasts that underwent extremely rigorous train
ing for the '92 Olympics.
A few articles deal with the struggles of
women sports writers. For instance, Kristin
Huckshorn of the San Jose Mercury News wrote
about reporter Lisa Olson's charge that she was
a victim of sexual harassment in the New Eng
land Patriots' locker room. Recently, Huckshorn
told George Vesey of the New York Times, "I
still say that covering sports was the most diffi
cult thing I ever did. You feel so alone."
Also of interest are Joan Ryan's article for
the San Francisco Examiner about
the increase in domestic violence
directed towards women on Super
Bowl Sunday; J.E. Vader's satiri
cal piece for The Oregonian con
cerning the Sports Illustrated
Swimsuit Issue; and Karen
Crouse's article for the Orange
County Register about athletes
who are stalked.
All of these articles reflect the
emergence of women sportswriters
and a new conscience in sports
writing, according to Rapaport.
"When I graduated from Stan
ford, there were no women
sportswriters. None. ['A Kind of
Grace'] tracks the rise of women
sportswriters from zero to hun

dreds . . . from a sideshow to
respectability," he said.
Rapaport maintains that it is
"not an accident" that women
sportswriters and the women's lib
eration movement began to emerge
at the same time in the early '70s.
"Sports is a metaphor for life in
more ways than one and the
women's movement is no excep
tion," he wrote. "Billie Jean King's
tennis match with Bobby Riggs in
1973 is occasionally cited as one of
the great symbolic events of
women's liberation. What is often
overlooked is how few women were
there to cover it.
"In those days, women
sportswriters were so rare that
even athletes who were not offend
ed by their presence found it hard
to take them seriously. When Les
ley Visser was a sportswriter for
the Boston Globe, she once stood

outside the Pittsburgh Steelers'
locker room — there was no ques
tion of her actually entering it —
waiting to interview quarterback
Terry Bradshaw. When he finally
emerged and saw her holding a
notebook, Bradshaw did the natu
ral thing: he took it from her and
signed it.
"There isn't a woman
sportswriter who won't tell you
things aren't better now, [but!
there will always be men who think
women don't belong there."
Rapaport also believes that
women sports writers lend a
unique perspective on the tradi
tionally male-dominated world of
sports.
"In many instances they don't
write differently, (but they bring] a
different perception," he said.
He elaborated about the advan
tages of this perspective in his

introduction, "It is clear that ath
letes tend to react differently to
being questioned by women than
by men. Often, they seem to view
female reporters as sisters in
whom they can easily confide. And
in the case of women athletes,
there can be a frankness, a sense of
camaraderie, that is absent when
they speak to men."
Rapaport hopes his book will
inspire the next generation of
women sportswriters. "Women in
college and high school think the
book speaks to them," he said.
When he finished editing "A
Kind of Grace," Rapaport said, "I
learned how many more | women]
writers there are especially in small
towns, how good they are, and
what a variety falls under women
in sports. You want to know the
latest sports wrinkle? Women
sports editors."

"Sports is a metaphor for life in
more ways than one and the
women's movement is no excep
tion," he wrote. "Billie Jean King's
tennis match with Bobby Riggs in
1973 is occasionally cited as one of
the great symbolic events of
women's liberation. What is often
overlooked is how few women were
there to cover it.
"In those days, women
sportswriters were so rare that
even athletes who were not offend
ed by their presence found it hard
to take them seriously. When Les
ley Visser was a sportswriter for
the Boston Globe, she once stood

outside the Pittsburgh Steelers'
locker room — there was no ques
tion of her actually entering it —
waiting to interview quarterback
Terry Bradshaw. When he finally
emerged and saw her holding a
notebook, Bradshaw did the natu
ral thing: he took it from her and
signed it.
"There isn't a woman
sportswriter who won't tell you
things aren't better now, [but!
there will always be men who think
women don't belong there."
Rapaport also believes that
women sports writers lend a
unique perspective on the tradi
tionally male-dominated world of
sports.
"In many instances they don't
write differently, (but they bring] a
different perception," he said.
He elaborated about the advan
tages of this perspective in his

introduction, "It is clear that ath
letes tend to react differently to
being questioned by women than
by men. Often, they seem to view
female reporters as sisters in
whom they can easily confide. And
in the case of women athletes,
there can be a frankness, a sense of
camaraderie, that is absent when
they speak to men."
Rapaport hopes his book will
inspire the next generation of
women sportswriters. "Women in
college and high school think the
book speaks to them," he said.
When he finished editing "A
Kind of Grace," Rapaport said, "I
learned how many more | women]
writers there are especially in small
towns, how good they are, and
what a variety falls under women
in sports. You want to know the
latest sports wrinkle? Women
sports editors."
Not long ago there weren't many women
sports writers. In fact, there was even a time
when there weren't any at all. How could this be
possible, one might ask, when five of the six Bay
Area reporters presently covering the NHL are
women and there are hundreds of women
across the country likewise writing about pro
fessional sports?
Try reading "A Kind of Grace: A Treasury of
Sports Writing by Women," edited by '62 Stan
ford graduate Ron Rapaport and published by
Zenobia Press in order to understand this fairly
recent emergence of women sports writers. Or
better yet, come to Rapaport's noon presenta
tion at the Stanford Bookstore on Nov. 8.
Rapaport, a nationally syndicated sports
columnist for the Los Angeles Daily News and
sports commentator for National Public Radio's
"Weekend Edition" will return to the Farm to

discuss his book along with sportswriters Ann
Killion of the San Jose Mercury News, Joan
Ryan of the San Francisco Chronicle, and
Nancy Levin of the Women's Sports Connec
tion, a publication dedicated solely to women's
sports.
Rapaport's new book is a compilation of 73
articles written by some of the best women
sportswriters in the U.S. and abroad, most of
which primarily focus on female athletes.
"In a way, this book is not representative of
the work women are doing today," writes Rapa
port in his introduction. "Michael Jordan, Pete
Rose, and Joe Montana do not appear in these
pages. Rather, the emphasis is on articles
depicting women athletes and, in many cases,
the problems they have faced in their rise to
prominence."
The pages include profiles of athletes such as
golfer Heather Farr before she died of breast
cancer, written by Betty Cuniberti for Golf

Digest and of determined jockey Mary Bacon, by
Ryan. Rapaport also chose an article detailing
runner Kathy Ormsby's suicide attempt due to
the pressures aimed at success, by Sharon Rob
for the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, and
Miami Herald writer Linda Robertson's profile
Bela Karolyi's "six-pack," the six petite gym
nasts that underwent extremely rigorous train
ing for the '92 Olympics.
A few articles deal with the struggles of
women sports writers. For instance, Kristin
Huckshorn of the San Jose Mercury News wrote
about reporter Lisa Olson's charge that she was
a victim of sexual harassment in the New Eng
land Patriots' locker room. Recently, Huckshorn
told George Vesey of the New York Times, "I
still say that covering sports was the most diffi
cult thing I ever did. You feel so alone."
Also of interest are Joan Ryan's article for
the San Francisco Examiner about
the increase in domestic violence
directed towards women on Super
Bowl Sunday; J.E. Vader's satiri
cal piece for The Oregonian con
cerning the Sports Illustrated
Swimsuit Issue; and Karen
Crouse's article for the Orange
County Register about athletes
who are stalked.
All of these articles reflect the
emergence of women sportswriters
and a new conscience in sports
writing, according to Rapaport.
"When I graduated from Stan
ford, there were no women
sportswriters. None. ['A Kind of
Grace'] tracks the rise of women
sportswriters from zero to hun

dreds . . . from a sideshow to
respectability," he said.
Rapaport maintains that it is
"not an accident" that women
sportswriters and the women's lib
eration movement began to emerge
at the same time in the early '70s.
"Sports is a metaphor for life in
more ways than one and the
women's movement is no excep
tion," he wrote. "Billie Jean King's
tennis match with Bobby Riggs in
1973 is occasionally cited as one of
