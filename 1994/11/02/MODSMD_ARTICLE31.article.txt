Anthony Bookman
Small steps from running back Anthony Bookman have taken
the Stanford football team great strides forward. With his
sophomore counterpart Mike Mitchell sidelined by an ankle
sprain and a ligament problem that has bothered him for the
past five weeks, Bookman has transformed his 4.2-seconds, 40-
meter speed into a solid rushing attack for the Cardinal. Last
weekend, the freshman bust loose for a 70-yard gain in the sec
ond quarter to lead all rushers with 21 carries for 138 yards
and one touchdown during Stanford's 31-30 loss to UCLA.
Bookman's feat marked the first time a true freshman broke
the 100-yard barrier for the Cardinal since Darrin Nelson in
1977.

Marnie Triefenbach
Perhaps junior outside hitter Marnie Triefenbach took excep
tion to the The Daily's suggestion that, if looks could kill, then
freshman middle blocker Barbara Ifejika must be the most
beautiful player in the Pacific 10 Conference. Indeed, Triefen
bach made her own bid for beauty queen this past weekend by
spiking the Ducks and Beavers out of town. In game two alone
against Oregon, she garnered 12 kills in 19 attempts and ended
the contest without a single hitting error. For the match, the 6-
footer recorded 16 kills and finished with a .448 hitting per
centage. Triefenbach followed up this massacre the following
night against Oregon State, racking up 22 kills with only two
hitting errors.
