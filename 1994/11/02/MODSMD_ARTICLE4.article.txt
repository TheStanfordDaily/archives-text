The ASSU Senate approved a bill last
night which "encourages the students of
Stanford University to vote against" Cali
fornia Proposition 187.
Proponents cited the possible effect of
the proposition — which would deny
health care and education benefits to illegal
immigrants — on the current University
health care system to justify its legality
within the ASSU Constitution.
The constitution states that the senate
cannot take stands "on matters not directly
affecting Stanford students."
"We are taking a stance on the part of
187 which affects us as Stanford students
and us as an institution," said undergradu
ate senator Michael Choo, a junior and one
of six authors of the bill.
Authors contend that if Proposition 187
passes, Stanford students wanting services
at University health providers other than
Cowell Student Health Center could en
counter procedural delays and result in de
nial of services.
"All [campus health care facilities] but
Cowell are public and they are subject to the
restrictions of Prop. 187," said graduate
senator Donald Aingworth, a co-author of
the bill.
