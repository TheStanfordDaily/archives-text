# ASSU Senate passes anti-Prop. 187 bill
## 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
The ASSU Senate approved a bill last
night which "encourages the students of
Stanford University to vote against" Cali
fornia Proposition 187.
Proponents cited the possible effect of
the proposition — which would deny
health care and education benefits to illegal
immigrants — on the current University
health care system to justify its legality
within the ASSU Constitution.
The constitution states that the senate
cannot take stands "on matters not directly
affecting Stanford students."
"We are taking a stance on the part of
187 which affects us as Stanford students
and us as an institution," said undergradu
ate senator Michael Choo, a junior and one
of six authors of the bill.
Authors contend that if Proposition 187
passes, Stanford students wanting services
at University health providers other than
Cowell Student Health Center could en
counter procedural delays and result in de
nial of services.
"All [campus health care facilities] but
Cowell are public and they are subject to the
restrictions of Prop. 187," said graduate
senator Donald Aingworth, a co-author of
the bill.
Aingworth said many foreign
students lose their visas and the
University has never required any
documentation from him since his
admittance.
"It's not just having legal [docu
mentation]," Choo said. "It's pro
viding it beyond a reasonable
doubt."
The bill, which resolves that the
senate "opposes the proposition as
it expands the scope of governmen
tal regulation into the lives of
Stanford students and their health
care concerns," passed by a two-to
one margin.
The bill drew opposition for var
ious reasons, although wording
was the chief concern of voting

opponents.
Graduate senator Marc Oppen
heimer said he disagreed with the
bill for explicitly asking students to
vote against Proposition 187.
"I fully support all of the ideas
behind the bill, but I disagree with
the statement to ask the communi
ty to directly vote against it. Stan
ford students are intelligent
enough to make that decision for
themselves," Oppenheimer said.
Senators proposed over five
amendments in the hour-long
debate.
"I'm glad it passed," said
undergraduate senator and co
author Liane Nomura, a junior.
"It's the duty of the senate to pro
tect the rights of the students."
Undergraduate senator Ed Mal
one, a junior, charged that the bill
was unconstitutional, and political
issues should not be touched bv

the senate.
"It is a disgrace to the ASSU
Constitution and to Stanford Uni
versity," Malone said. "(The pro
ponents] are making a tenuous
connection at best. They want to
be the moral godfather for stu
dents."
Despite his opposition to the
proposition, Malone said he could
not support the senate bill because
the issue goes beyond its impact on
Stanford students. "If Kathleen
Brown were elected, she could
raise taxes which could hurt Stan
ford. We can't politicize every
thing," he said.
In other action, the senate
approved a measure giving Stan
ford-in-Government $4,000 out of
its reserve fund.
SIG, which brings political
speakers and sponsors congres
sional internships for Stanford

students, did not receive its special
fee because of low voter turnout in
student elections hist year.
Undergraduate senator Andre
Vanier, chair of the Budget and
Finance Committee, said that over
the years SIG has built up over
$10,500 in reserves, which are con
trolled by the ASSU.
SIG chair Susie Thomas, a
senior, said the money will only
fund one of its nine projects. "We're
trying desperately to find funding
for the other eight committees,"
she said, adding that the group's
usual budget is around $37,000.
The senate also approved a bill
providing buses to Big Game to all
interested students. Tickets will be
$10, Choo said.
Choo also announced that the
Bookstore will offer a 25 percent
discount on all Stanford parapher
nalia the week prior to Big Game.
