# Casper talks to ASSU about Band, donations
## 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
Tackling issues as diverse as the alum
ni giving policy and the recent conduct of
members of the Stanford Band, Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper answered
questions from the ASSU Senate last
night.
In addition, he spent a significant
amount of time on The Stanford Review's
use of the former Stanford Indian logo and
changes in the University's grading policy
in the 90 minute question-and-answer
session.
Regarding The Review's use of the Uni
versity's old logo, Casper said he would
not pursue legal action against The Re
view. He noted that The Review does not
receive funding from the University and
operates independently.
"Such speech is... not outlawed under
the Grey Interpretation of the Fundamen
tal Standard. Thus the University has no
grounds for {disciplinary) action," Casper
said. "I think student organizations have
a large degree of autonomy. In
case of doubt, we are erring on the
side of freedom, in this case the
freedom of the students."
But Casper chastised The
Review for offending Native Amer
icans, saying that the use of the
Indian cartoon perpetuates stereo
types.
"Every student at Stanford . ..
has a right not to be treated as a
stereotype," he said. "No individ
ual must be treated as mainly a
member of a group. [The Review)
seem(s) not to understand the
crucial difference between being
provocative and being offensive."
Finally, Casper expressed dis
may over the increasing trend of
litigation of campus issues. "Let us
not push every issue on campus
that is controversial into a legal
straitjacket," he said.
Another question dealt with the
effect the new alumni giving policy
— which prohibits student groups
from soliciting from alumni who
have not given to those groups in
the past five years — would have
on such organizations.
"I do not know the extent to
which student groups are stifled
by the new policy," Casper said. "I
have decided that we need to have
a concentrated approach" in solic
iting funds.
"The justification for the over
all approach is that we have done

so poorly" in overall alumni giv
ing," he said. "This year the return
from undergraduate alumni
increased from 25 percent to 30
percent. That is not a bad
(increase) in one year."
Regarding the recent changes
in the University's grading policy,
Casper said, "After the change in
the policy, I have stated on the
record my agreement with this
change. I do think we have to
remember ... that there are very
liberal drop policies still in place. ..
. I cannot believe that F's will be a
very widespread phenomenon,
because Stanford students are
very good."
Casper also said that the perfor
mance by the Band members at
the Simpson trial last Friday
brought his office a lot of phone
calls. Many older alumni are
offended by the band's antics, he
said, while alumni from the 1960s
and after generally are not.
"Some actually like the Stan
ford Band, or like what they
remember of the Band, because I
am told that at one time the Band
was actually funny," Casper said,
in a comment that brought laugh
ter from the senate.
He continued, "I think the
Stanford Band wanted to make a
point about the circus into which
the O.J. Simpson trial has turned,
and they certainly added to the cir
cus."
Casper added that he had no
opinion about whether a violation
of the Fundamental Standard
occurred, but said that possible

sanctions against the Hand by the
Athletic Department would not
violate their freedom of speech.
"When they travel financed by

the Department of Athletics, that
is not a free speech issue because
they are there only at the invita
tion of the Department," he said.
