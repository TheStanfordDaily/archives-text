## Designed after Rhodes, new program to attract Asia's best 
### Justin Pollard Staff writer 
Stanford is developing a scholarship pro
gram — modeled after the Rhodes Scholar
ships at Oxford University — aimed at
bringing the future leaders of Asia to study
here for two years.
The program, tentatively called the
Asia / Pacific Scholars Program, would be
for "highly qualified [college] graduates
with leadership skills" from major Asian
countries, said University President Ger
hard Casper.
The program would offer 25 to 30 schol
arships each year for study in a broad range
of disciplines.
Casper began working on the program
during a visit to Asia last November, and
has been working on it "vigorously" ever
since, he said.
So far the University's efforts have fo
cused primarily on raising funds, Casper
said. "First we need a critical mass of
money. . .. We have $7 million now and we
need substantially more" to make the pro
gram a reality, he said.
The program would require an endow
ment fund in the "rough range" of $40-50
million, said Political Science Prof. Daniel
Okimoto.
Stanford is "now looking at organiza
tional elements" of the program and there
are still "lots of questions about applica
tions and selection procedure," Casper said.
The program, however, "won't be function
ing until 18 months from now at the earli
est," he added.
The program has garnered support from

many areas.
It "has been embraced by many parts cf
the University, including alumni, donors,
the Bechtel (International) Center and a
growing number of faculty," said Steve
Suda, director of Asian operations in the Of
fice of Development.
"We're hoping to attract financial sup
porters on both sides of the Pacific," he said.

"As Asian countries be
come more prosperous, we
hope that individuals from
those countries can help
contribute more to the ed
ucational costs of their stu
dents coming to Stanford."
Suda said the Universi
ty is currently seeking fi
nancial support from
Japan, Korea, China and
Hong Kong.

An informal group, based in the Institute
for International Studies, has been meeting
and talking about the program, Okimoto
said.
"For Stanford, our location on the Pacif
ic Rim makes us ideally situated to assume
the challenge of helping to train the next
generation of leaders in the region," Okimo
to said. The program would benefit Stan
ford by strengthening the student body and
expanding the University's network of
alumni and contacts in Asia, he added.
"Even though Asia / Pacific is the most
rapidly growing region in the world, it does
not have a university ranked in the top 10 as
a research institution," Okimoto said. The


Casper
scholarship would present the
"opportunity for bright young
(Asian] scholars to be educated
at a first-rate university," he
added.

Scholarships such as this one
"do not become prestigious
overnight," said John Pearson,
director of Bechtel. The Rhodes
Scholarship, for example, is more
than 100 years old and has a very
large endowment, he said.
