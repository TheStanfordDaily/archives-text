# 'Tackling all-encompassing issues important to us all'
## Earth Day founder branches out 
### Dalia Azim 
A quarter of a century ago, before Earth
Day, "environmentalism" was not even a
word.
But thanks to Denis Hayes — Stanford
graduate and 1969 ASSU president — con
temporary vocabularies now reflect a main
stream ecological consciousness, one which
he helped create.
Hayes, easily one of the forefathers of the
current "ecolution," has made and contin
ues to make a giant impact on the environ
ment. Projects such as the original Earth
Day in 1970 and its 1990 reprise were two of
his most far-reaching endeavors.
"[There was] an opportunity to take all
the environmental action around the coun
try and focus it into one large campaign and
to do with that anything that we could,"
Hayes said.

With that spirit, on April 22,
1970, Earth Day was born.
The inspiration to begin Earth
Day and spread his "econscious
ness" came to Hayes during and
soon after his undergraduate
years at Stanford. Hayes said he
saw numerous, dissociated haz
ards — from oil spills to defor
estation — from which he dis
cerned a larger environmental
problem.
In the mid-19605, Hayes
departed on a three-year hitchhik
ing trip around the planet where
he traveled to more than 100
countries. This experience opened
Hayes's eyes to the crucial link
between humans and their natu
ral environments.
Closer to home, in his native
state of Washington, Hayes said
he found increasing ruin in the
natural environment of his home,
and was deeply upset by the eco
logical detriment.
But he said he wasn't the only
one who was disturbed bv the

degradation of his surroundings.
"Many people at this time had
this consciousness. . hut in terms
of putting together a movement to
combine modern urban and envi
ronmental issues, this was rare,"
he said.
So in 1970 a group of environ
mentalists, including Hayes, con
sciously packaged these issues as
the environmental problem, and a
new vocabulary was created.
This original Earth Day found
20 million people demonstrating
an "econsciousness" previously
unknown to the world, Hayes
said. He inspired people to march,
rally, bury old cars and wear gas
masks, all to draw attention to the
environmental problems of the
day.
As a result of such community
mobilization, the end of this year
brought the Clean Air Act and the
creation of the Environmental
Protection Agency.
Twenty years later, Hayes's
successful creation blossomed
into Earth Day 1990, where
Hayes said he coordinated activi
ties in 131 different countries. His
immense dedication also pro
pelled him over 400,000 miles

around the world, where he
attempted to inspire populations
abroad to take their environmen
tal problems into their own
hands.
Since his involvement in the
1990 campaign, Hayes said he has
had no further involvement with
the Earth Day council.
However, he sees the effects of
Earth Day through such things as
teachers discussing environmen
tal issues in the classroom, the
restoration of urban parks, the
planting of trees and the cleaning
up urban graffiti.
"You get everybody for a period
of time talking about Earth Day,"
he said. "It's on the news each
night, it's on the TV each morn
ing. . .preachers are preaching it
from the pulpit."
All in all, Hayes said, people
are starting to take time to think
about the environmental reper
cussions of their actions.
Although he is no longer
involved in Earth Day, Hayes is
still passionate about saving the
environment.
He is currently the president of
the Seattle-based Bullitt Founda
tion — an $85 million foundation

dedicated to preserving the Pacif
ic Northwest — which is current
ly working on various projects
from cleaning up Fuget Sound to
the preservation of open space to
the wise use of energy.
The goal of this foundation is
to "map out strategies to help to
build a sustainable economy in
this region and create models
which will apply elsewhere," he
said
Hayes has also taken interest
in current environmental issues,
like the dangers of the population
explosion. A few months ago, he
attended the population confer
ence in Cairo to gain a better per
ception of these issues.
He said he sees the over-popu
lation problem as mainly stem
ming from,"the huge distinction
in people's minds that high birth
rates are bad and babies are desir
able."
"Certain societies allow no real
opportunities for women to gain
self-esteem than through mother
hood," he said. He added that he
believes if women are given pro
ductive roles in society, the popu
lation will decrease.
In order to achieve a turn

around in the population explo
sion, Hayes said the developed
world needs to provide under
developed societies with a foreign
assistance program to enhance
educational systems and to pro
vide family planning and contra
ceptives.
According to Mayes, this con
ference was, "the greatest envi
ronmental triumph of the Clinton
administration. . .we played our
role with courage and integrity in
Cairo in the face of the Vatican
and fundamentalist Islamic
groups. . .we stood firm."
In the future, the environ
mentalist would like to see the
population problem under con
trol, a move to increase the
number of families with only
one or two children, an aggres
sive pursuit of renewable ener
gy sources and a move to recy
cle 95 to 98 percent of the
materials pouring through the
system.
But in general, Mayes said he
believes "the environment is not
the only problem that's important
in building our society. . .we need
to articulate a broad set of values
tackling the all-encompassing
