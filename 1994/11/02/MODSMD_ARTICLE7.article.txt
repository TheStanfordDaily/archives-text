A quarter of a century ago, before Earth
Day, "environmentalism" was not even a
word.
But thanks to Denis Hayes — Stanford
graduate and 1969 ASSU president — con
temporary vocabularies now reflect a main
stream ecological consciousness, one which
he helped create.
Hayes, easily one of the forefathers of the
current "ecolution," has made and contin
ues to make a giant impact on the environ
ment. Projects such as the original Earth
Day in 1970 and its 1990 reprise were two of
his most far-reaching endeavors.
"[There was] an opportunity to take all
the environmental action around the coun
try and focus it into one large campaign and
to do with that anything that we could,"
Hayes said.
