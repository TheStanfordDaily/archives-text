You've worked hard to reach graduation. Now take your career to new heights you never thought possibleâ€”
by joining the high CLlmbers at CLI. In the seventies, we pioneered an exploration in compressed digital video
technology. In 1982, we placed ourselves at the top of the industry by introducing the first commercially
successful videoconferencing system. We continue to climb through the nineties, conquering new technological
territory such as Video-on-Demand and mini videoconferencing systems for personal computers.
To sustain our 30-50% growth and leadership, we need the best technical talent to keep us on top.
We are currently looking for Hardware and Software Engineers
with a BS, MS or PhD in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering or
Computer Science.
