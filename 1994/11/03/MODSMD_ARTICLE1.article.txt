# Zimbardo criticizes 3 strikes

Strongly opposing California
Governor Pete Wilson's campaign
rhetoric, Psychology Prof. Philip
Zimbardo outlined what he sees
as the down-side of California
Proposition 184, the so-called
"Three Strikes" initiative, in a
press conference yesterday.
Wilson, who advocates the
proposition, has said that con
cerned Californians are willing to
pay the costs for a war on violence.
Zimbardo, however, argued that
Governor Wilson has not ade
quately informed the public aboui
the high expense of these costs.
Speaking in Tresidder Oak
West, Zimbardo — who is famous
for his classic "Stanford Prison
Experiment" which showed the
propensity for violence in prisons
— outlined "hidden costs" that
specifically relate to elderly pris
oners. The measure mandates 25
years to life in prison for those
who have committed three
felonies.
"My research shows that the
hidden costs of enforcing the
'three-strikes-you're-out' law are
so enormous, so misdirected
when applied to elderly offenders
for non-violent crimes . . . that
Californians should crll a balk on
those pitching Proposition 184 in
the November Bth election."
Zimbardo said the current el
derly prison population 0f5,000 is
likely to rise to over 20,000 in five
years and 126,000 in 25 years —
more than the current total of all
inmates.
Estimating the annual cost for
an inmate over 50 at between
$60,000-$09,000, Zimbardo calcu
lated that the cost of a 25-year
term for an elderly inmate would
be $1,500,000. These added costs,
he said, would increase the state
corrections budget from $1.5 to
$3.5 billion in 10 years.
"The problem is that the state
budget is relatively fixed," Zim
bardo said. "For every prison
built, 8,833 new teachers will be
lost from the classrooms. Some
thing has got to give."
By taking money from higher
education, Proposition 184 will
actually encourage crime, he
added.
"We need more schools, not
crime bills," Zimbardo said.
"Studies show that the more a
person is educated, the less likely
they are to commit crimes."
Zimbardo urged people to vote
against the proposition, citing the
potential difficulty in getting it
removed. If Proposition 184 pass

es by a majority in this election, it
will require a two-thirds vote to
overturn.
"Proposition 184 tries to bind
the hands of our legislators so
they can't modify the laws as nec
essary," Zimbardo said.
He added that it would
inevitably be necessary to change
the measure, noting that the
third offense — which sends a
criminal to jail for a minimum of
25 years — could be any small
crime.
"It's not limited to violent
crime," said Zimbardo. "That's
what we've been led to believe."
Proposition 184, Zimbardo
said, limits the sentencing options
of lawmakers and courts, leaving
no room to clear jails of ailing,
elderly inmates or non-violent
felons.
"This law would knock out the
possibility of establishing tests to
determine those who were unlike
ly to commit violent crimes," Zim
bardo said.
In addition, the proposition
will not necessarily deter those
who are likely to be violent

offenders, he said.
"There's no evidence that capi
tal punishment has a deterrent
effect," Zimbardo said. "These
incredibly high-[costl deterrent
methods won't filter down to the
level of the actions of most indi
viduals."
Zimbardo emphasized the need
to cease relying on "failed solu
tions," such as long-term impris
onment for growing numbers of
prisoners. He said that such a
reliance wouldn't solve the prob
lem of the "replenishing factor"
— the idea that for every criminal
arrested, there's one ready to take
his place.
"By dealing only with the con
sequences and not the causes of
crime, (the proposition] is a fail
ure — a failure that will cost lots
of money," he said.
In Zimbardo's 1971 study, col
lege students played the roles of
prisoners and guards in a simulat
ed prison. The psychology profes
sor was forced to end the experi
ment early, however, because of
the violence and pathology exhib
ited by the participants.

level of the actions of most indi
viduals."
Zimbardo emphasized the need
to cease relying on "failed solu
tions," such as long-term impris
onment for growing numbers of
prisoners. He said that such a
reliance wouldn't solve the prob
lem of the "replenishing factor"
— the idea that for every criminal
arrested, there's one ready to take
his place.
"By dealing only with the con
sequences and not the causes of
crime, (the proposition] is a fail
ure — a failure that will cost lots
of money," he said.
In Zimbardo's 1971 study, col
lege students played the roles of
prisoners and guards in a simulat
ed prison. The psychology profes
sor was forced to end the experi
ment early, however, because of
the violence and pathology exhib
ited by the participants.
