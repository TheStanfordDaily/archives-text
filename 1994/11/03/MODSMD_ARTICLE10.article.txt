## Fire in Egypt causes 147 deaths Worst flooding in 60 years increases mortalities, destroys homes 
### 
DURUNKA, Egypt (AP) — A river
of fire ignited by an oil tank explosion
surged through a village in southern
Egypt yesterday, razing houses and
killing at least 147 people.
Deadly flooding in the region
raised the death toll to more than
200, according to security sources.
Cairo newspapers said it was the
worst flooding in 60 years, and more
rain was expected today.
The fire started when flooding
from torrential rains collapsed a
bridge over pipelines at a government
oil storage depot, setting off the
explosion and fires. Flood waters car
ried flaming petroleum from the
depot into Durunka, an adjacent
town of 22,000 people.
The blaze in Durunka, 200 miles
south of Cairo, was put out 15 hours
after the initial explosion. Rescuers
searched for more victims in the
town's burned-out houses.
Large parts of the town were lev
eled. Bodies littered the streets
before being picked up by ambu
lances. Residents were evacuated to
schools and government buildings in
the nearby city of Assiut.
Assiut Governor Samih el-Saeed
told Egyptian television that the
bodies of 147 victims had been

recovered from houses razed by
fire.
Kadry Abu Hussein, head of the
emergency operation office in Assiut,
said some victims died of burns, oth
ers of suffocation. The death toll was
expected to rise, he said.
Thirty people were killed in
floods that destroyed houses, a
school and a mosque in other parts
of Assiut province, Abu Hussein
said. Deaths also were reported in
neighboring Sohag province, but the
number of victims was not immedi
ately known.
In the Sinai peninsula in northern
Egypt, flood waters swept a bus car
rying 38 British tourists into the Red
Sea, killing one tourist. The other
pasengers on the bus, which was
heading south from Taba to Noweiba,
were slightly injured, the Interior
Ministry said.
Mohammed Abdel-Mohsen Saleh,
a Durunka resident and the represen
tative of President Hosni Mubarak's
ruling National Democratic Party in
Assiut, criticized the government for
building the depot in a highly popu
lated area.
"The government failed us when it
put up this depot close to where peo
ple live," Saleh told reporters. The

nine oil tanks at the edge of Durunka
held 15,000 tons of petroleum as
strategic reserves for the armed
forces.
An engineer who worked at the
depot, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press
that when the main bridge to the
complex collapsed, fires erupted in
pipelines, causing an explosion at
about 6:30 a.m.
Samih el-Saeed, governor of Assiut
province, declared a state of emergen
cy throughout the province and asked
the army to send helicopters to dump
fire-retarding chemicals onto the
smoldering depot.
El-Saeed said many women, chil
dren and elderly were among the
dead.
Hundreds of people made home
less by the fire and floods gathered
outside the governor's office in Assi
ut, demanding shelter and emergen
cy provisions. Kadry said authorities
were opening up schools and govern
ment buildings until permanent
shelters could be set up for the home
less.
The Assiut area is a hotbed of Mus
lim radicals, but they were not
believed to be involved in the Durun
