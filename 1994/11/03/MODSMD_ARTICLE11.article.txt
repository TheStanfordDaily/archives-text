Guides to be distributed
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Christian Coalition will distribute 33
million election guides to voters this weekend and already is facing
criticism from Democrats who say their views are being distorted in
an effort to help Republicans.
A sampling of guides shows that in the overwhelming majority of
cases, it is the Republican candidate whose views are most in line with
those espoused by the coalition, the offspring of religious broadcaster
Pat Robertson's 1988 presidential campaign.
But coalition leaders vehemently deny picking sides — which
would violate the organization's tax-exempt status. "We know the
rules and we play by them," said coalition spokesman Mike Russell.
The guides and weekend telephone prodding of Christian conser
vative voters are the final installment on a $5 million Christian Coali
tion election effort that included 10 million guides for primary races
and 17 million congressional scorecards.
