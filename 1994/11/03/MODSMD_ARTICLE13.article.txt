# Minister convicted in abortion slayings
## 
### 
PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — A jury deliber
ated just 20 minutes yesterday before convict
ing a former minister of murder in the shot
gun slayings of an abortion doctor and his
bodyguard.
Paul Hill, 40, could receive either life in
prison or death in the electric chair. The jury
will return today to decide.
Hill, acting as his own lawyer, offered no
defense during his three-day trial, refusing to
make any statement or question any witness
es. Circuit Judge Frank Bell had barred him
from arguing that the slayings were justifiable
homicide to save fetuses.
"I have nothing to say, your honor," the
blond-haired, bespectacled Hill said before
deliberations began. He showed no emotion as
the verdict was read.

Wielding a 12-gauge shotgun, Hill
ambushed Dr. John B. Britton, 69; his
unarmed bodyguard, James H. Barrett, 74; and
Barrett's wife, June, 68, as the three arrived at
the Ladies Center abortion clinic on July 29.
He was convicted of attempted murder for
wounding Mrs. Barrett.
Last month, he became the first person
convicted of violating the new federal law
against harassing or using violence against
people entering abortion clinics. He could get
up to life in prison at sentencing Dec. 9.
Before the shootings, Hill had openly advo
cated killing abortion doctors. He said such
slayings were divinely sanctioned.
"Now is the time to defend the unborn, the
same way you'd defend slaves about to be
murdered!" he shouted as he was taken to jail

after his arrest.
During their closing arguments, prosecu
tors showed jurors photos of the victims'
bloody, bullet-riddled bodies.
"He demonstrated in the most graphic, vio
lent kind of way that he does not believe that
he is bound by any laws that he doesn't agree
with," said Assistant State Attorney James
Murray. "And what he decided to do was be a
vigilante. He decided he was going to be judge,
jury and executioner."
At one point, Murray held up a poster-sized
photograph of a sign Hill had carried during
abortion protests that read: "EXECUTE
MURDERERS, ABORTIONISTS, ACCES
SORIES?"
"What's that message?" he asked jurors.
"Execute. Execute."
