## Brown for Governor 
### 
Vote Brown next Tues.
and put Calif, on the
path toward renewal

THE UPCOMING gubernato
rial election has been grabbing
headlines for months in Cali
fornia, Washington, D.C., and many
places in between.
This is because the candidate who
wins has a bright future in national
politics as well as California politics.
Pete Wilson, the Republican incum
bent, will be a front-runner for the

GOP presidential ticket in
1996 if he wins re-election.
Kathleen Brown, the Demo
cratic challenger, has been
mentioned as a potential
running-mate with Vice
President A 1 Gore in 2000, if
President Clinton is re-elect
ed in 1996.

These possibilities hinge on a lot
of what ifs, but the fact remains that
next Tuesday people from all over
the country will be anxiously await
ing California election returns.
National politics aside, Califor
nia's future is at stake on Tuesday,
and the election of Kathleen Brown
will ensure a brighter future for the
state.
It's been a rough four years for
California. The collapse of the
defense industry threw it into a
recession, an earthquake rocked the
Los Angeles area and wildfires swept
through the state. The list goes on
and on, and Wilson has claimed bad
luck.
You can't predict natural disas
ters, but the sign of a true leader is
someone who can understand his or
her followers and where they are
headed. It was easy to predict that
the end of the Cold War would crush
the defense industry. Several states
saw this and planned ahead, study
ing ways to convert to other indus
tries. Wilson vetoed legislation to
provide assistance for defense con
version and did not sign a plan for

defense conversion until it was
painfully needed, in September
1993.
Instead of relying on his record to
get him re-elected, Wilson is playing
on the fears of Californians by push
ing crime and immigration legisla
tion. Wilson's cynical attitude
toward Proposition 187 — which
would deny all social services except
emergency medical care to illegal
immigrants, including education —
reveals the absurdity of the measure.
Wilson has said he does not have a
plan to deport illegal immigrants
"turned in" under the proposition
because enforcement will immedi
ately be stopped by legal action from

opponents. The state will
have to spend millions of dol
lars defending the proposi
tion — which could save at
most $200 million a year —
and the proposition puts $15
billion in federal funds at
risk. And as someone who

says he's tough on crime, it seems
strange that Wilson would support a
measure that would put thousands
of uneducated youths on the streets.
The reason is simple: Wilson is
spouting out political answers that
will not work in reality. Brown,
although she doesn't have all the
answers, seems to recognize Califor
nia's problems and will work toward
realistic solutions. As state treasurer
and former corporate lawyer, Brown
has the background to understand
the economic complexities of Califor
nia. In addition, her economic plan
has been endorsed by more than 50
California economists, including two
of Stanford's Nobel laureates —
Profs. Kenneth Arrow and William
Sharpe.
As California's educational rank
ings continue to slide and the infras
tructure continues to age, it is time
to change the leadership of Califor
nia. Pete Wilson has not gotten the
job done; he has merely reacted
when appropriate. California needs
to come up with a plan for prosperi
ty and begin working toward it.
Kathleen Brown is the best way to
begin that process.
