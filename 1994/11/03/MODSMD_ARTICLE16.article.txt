Paid advertisement showed total disregard for truth

THE FULL-PAGE advertisement in
the Nov. 1 issue of The Daily
regarding the assassination of Indi
ra Gandhi was shocking in its complete
disregard to facts, its glorification of ter
rorists, and its implication that Indira
Gandhi got her just desserts.
We don't want to criticize The Daily's
acceptance of this paid advertisement;
that is a separate issue for debate. We do,
however, believe that a publication that is
read as widely as The Daily should take
some responsibility for the kind of mate
rial it accepts, even if it is a paid adver
tisement.
In this letter, we focus on pointing out
the complete distortion of facts by the
authors of the ad. We think it is the duty of
The Daily to print a fair and analytical reply.
"On October 31, 1984, two of [Indira
Gandhi'si bodyguards, shaheeds Beant
Singh and Satwant Singh, emptied their
assault rifles into her body and then sur

rendered themselves to the Indian
authorities."
Shaheed means one who sacrifices him
self for an honorable cause. Beant Singh
and Satwant Singh are not by any stretch
of imagination shaheeds. They were sol
diers who turned traitors and slayed the
very person they were sworn to protect.
"On December 9, 1946, Jawaharlal
Nehru admitted that, 'Adequate safe
guards would be provided for minorities
in India. ..
Nehru's pledge was never to grant
independence to any group that desires it.
We doubt that any country of any reason
able ethnic diversity could remain united
under such assumptions.
"Mrs. Gandhi, deploying the Indian
army, air force, and navy, ordered the
attack of the Sikh's holiest gurdwara,
Harminder Sahib, and 40 other Sikh gur
dwarns throughout Pury'ab."
The Golden Temple was attacked only

when all other alternatives had been
exhausted. The ad conveniently fails to
mention that Khalistani separatist ter
rorists were using the holy shrine for the
purpose of hiding themselves and a large
cache of sophisticated weapons. The Indi
an troops suffered more casualties than
necessary because they had to be careful
not to destroy the holy shrine, in which
the cowardly terrorists were hiding!
"And, on October 31, 1984, Mrs.
Gandhi reaped what she had sown."
This is by far the most tasteless
remark in the entire ad. When referring
to a leader and statesperson of such inter
national renown as Indira Gandhi, this
remark demonstrates the complete
immaturity and lack of intellectual depth
of the ad.
And what exactly is this Sikh nation
that is repeatedly referred to? Is the ad
referring to terrorists or the people of
Punjab? The people of Punjab are as inte

gral a part of India as any other. And
these are not just Sikhs. They are cur
rently enjoying a huge economic boom
and a time of peace under their demo
cratically-elected local government.
No right thinking person would con
done the horrible anti-Sikh riots that
broke out after the assassination; it is a
subject of much pain to many of us. But
to attribute it to the government is a com
pletely ridiculous claim.
Lastly, it is ironic that the ad quotes
Mahatma Gandhi, apparently in favor of
it's own manifesto. Anyone who has read
and understood the Mahatma's carefully
reasoned philosophy and ideas on life,
non-violence and peaceful resistance
knows how absurd it is to link his words
to the content of the ad.
