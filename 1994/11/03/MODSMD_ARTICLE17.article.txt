# Daily should not have run Indira Gandhi ad; apology is demanded
## 
### 
It was shocking to see The Stanford
Daily publish the paid advertisement of
Nov. 1, which tried to malign India's late
prime minister Indira Gandhi, India's
armed forces and the country as a whole.
The ad tried to portray so-called facts,
most of which were completely baseless.
However, the most important issue is
how a newspaper like The Daily —
which has the ability to mold public
opinion — could publish such an ad.
Last year, a past editor-in-chief of
The Daily wrote an article saying that
newspapers are accountable for what
they publish, whether it is a news item
or an advertisement. Why, then, did The
Daily allow such an ad to appear within

its pages? I suggest that The Daily pub
lish an apology and see to it that such an
incident is not repeated in the future.
