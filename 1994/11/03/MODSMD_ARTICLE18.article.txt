# ASSU violated principles of its own Constitution by opposing Proposition 187
## 
### 
The ASSU Senate's vote Tuesday to
oppose Proposition 187 flagrantly vio
lates the most basic principles of its own
Constitution. Specifically enjoined from
speaking on extra-Stanford issues by an
overwhelming vote of Stanford students
not four years ago, the recidivist ASSU
has somehow rationalized this dubious
action and plowed ahead with an
immoral usurpation of students' voices.
The anti-187 apologists justify their

Northian extra-constitutional excess
with specious conclusions based on
dubious assumptions. The wannabe leg
islators in the ASSU can concoct bogus
rationalizations until the entire student
body is deported or left to die on the
streets for want of medical care, but the
inescapable truth remains â€” a cabal of
incompetent bureaucrats are again pro
mulgating official pronouncements on
our behalf.
The ASSU's penchant for debating
U.S. foreign and social policy, support
ing candidates and generally meddling
outside Stanford stopped abruptly with
the overwhelming passage of the Bone-
Overdeck constitutional amendment to
Article I of the ASSU Constitution,
proscribing the ASSU from taking
positions on matters that do not
directly affect Stanford students.
Although few inside the ASSU sup
ported our measure, even its oppo
nents eventually praised the resulting

de-politicization of student govern
ment.
Sadly, the ASSU can't seem to allow
Stanford students to think or vote for
themselves, despite the fact the elec
torate has made its desire perfectly
clear. We are sliding down a long, slip
pery slope that will see the student gov
ernment get politicized, lose credibility
and ultimately its remaining legitimacy.
With no mechanism for judicial review
as the ASSU Senate itself conveniently
interprets the Constitution, we are now
at the mercy of a student government
running amok, trampling on our free
doms and stuffing words in our
mouths.
What is so wrong with allowing Stan
ford students to decide Proposition 187
for themselves?
