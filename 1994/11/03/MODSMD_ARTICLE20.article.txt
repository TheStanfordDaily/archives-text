## Casualties of higher learning 
### 
CONVERSATION IS THE first casual
ty of higher learning. Sure, carrying
20 units might save you a spring (read:
seven grand) come senior year, but its social
costs make it a precarious investment.
It costs more than the pufiy eyes and the
coflee-gut gas pains. The chief sacrifice to
the gods of the under(graduate)world is
becoming an exceedingly boring person.
Which is ironic since learning is supposed
to make you more interesting.
But for some reason choosing to bloat a
quarter makes people think that a descrip
tion of work load is the most enchanting —
if not only— form of communication. You
may have noticed recently that all those new
dormmates who seemed so invigorating just
a week or so ago are now about as novel as
yogurt.
That seemingly personality-packed,
funny-girl from down the hall hasn't spoken
a sentence to you that didn't include to
phrase "so behind it's insane" in two weeks.
The guy who taught you to find homoerotic
themes in "It's a Wonderful Life" now has
nothing to share with you but calculations of
how little sleep he's gotten in the last four
days.
It isn't that your cool-o-meter was busti
cated when you decided they were nifty
enough to talk to in public, it's that their aca
demic obligations just staged a coup d 'etat on
their social skills — churning clever dialogue
into circular soliloquies.
Around midterm time table-talk becomes
an exercise in the dysfunctional — no one

listing to no one, but everybody speaking in
turn. This strange blend of simultaneous
monologue replaces the more engaging
explorations of other.
Curious catharses happen with every trip
to the potty.
"Hey, what's up?" someone asks you in
the hall.
"Nothing, how you doing?" you answer
rhetorically, eager to pee.
"Okay I guess, except I've got this mon
ster eight-to-tener due in an hour and then
I've gotta do a problem set for my stupid soc.
class. Oh, and there's this presentation
which counts for 42 percent of my CS grade,
though I still can't seem to get that Karel the
Robot to do the hokie-pokie. But then I've
have "
Ring a bell?
So if you suspect that you speak more of
pages than content, more on midterms than
Melrose, if you find that the only person who
is willing to listen to you and at leak make the
effort to sound attentive is the same person
who happens to have the pass key, know this:
You are boring us.
Your friends only pretend to be interest
ed or sympathetic because they need to bor
row your car.
We don't want to hear about your sched
ule conflicts and we don't care to compute
your pages-per-day ratio. We've all got our
own lumps to swallow.
And what's worse is that your bringing
up the subject only excacerbates the trend,
because others join in and begin to relay
their own academic atrocities.

Pretty soon, all that once-stimulating
lunch time banter is substituted with a mute
round of "Who's the most stressed?" Raving
roommates challenge one another with
stress loads and competitions rage over who
has more course readers to skim or more
tests in a week or more spiritual attachment
to caffeine.
The phenomenon is almost understand
able. Imagine:
You 're walking along a particularly pret
ty autumn quarter, thinking nothing of your
schedule or commitments, then, suddenly,
from under the bushes comes a snarling
paper, a rabid midterm and a saber-toothed
program.
You are dumbfounded — paralyzed with
stimulus. And as you stave off the beasts with
a calculator and your few minutes of spare
time, you can think of nothing to say.
Not even, "Help."
All you can think to express is your frus
tration.
Doesn't make it any more interesting,
just understandable.
So do us a favor and give it up. Euthanize
your bitch-instinct and let's talk about some
of that stuff that made you look interesting
enough on paper for Mr. Montoya to buy you
an ice cream cone.
Keep it to yourself and let those of us
indulging in the Coco-Puff dreamworld of
P/NC have our fun.
