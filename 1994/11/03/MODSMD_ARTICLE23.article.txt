## Playing for pride Men's soccer hosts Spartans

The Stanford men's soccer
team will find out just what it
means to them today at 2 p.m. on
Maloney field. In its last Mountain
Division match versus San Jose
State, the Cardinal will attempt to
end league play with honor.
"We're playing for pride," said
sophomore goalkeeper Ryan
Craig.
Junior forward Carmen
D'Onofrio echoed the sentiment.
"We haven't beaten a Bay area
team yet, and [San Jose State] is
one of our rivals," he said.
"There's a lot of pride riding on
this game."
Stanford (4-11-2) no longer has
any chance of making the post
season playoffs due to last Sun
day's defeat at the hands of Cali
fornia. However, the Spartans
(13-4-0) remain in the hunt for a
playoff berth even though they
trail Stanford in the conference.
Because Stanford amassed a poor
overall record, it has no chance to
garner an at-large bid for the

Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion post-season tournament. The
Spartans, on the other hand, still
have hopes for an at-large bid due
to their strong overall perfor
mance.
"Since they still have a chance
to go to the tournament,"
D'Onofrio said, "maybe we can be
a spoiler."
The Spartans have a lot riding
on this game, however, and they
will prove themselves formidable
foes. Stanford head coach Colin
Lindores considers San Jose State
one of the most dramatically
improved teams in the division.
The Spartans' record bears that
evaluation out.
"We are absolutely looking to
get a win out of the game," Spar
tan head coach Gary St. Clair said.
Brian Weaver leads the Spar
tans with nine goals and 12
assists. With the talent and drive
that San Jose will bring to this
match, the Cardinal will have its
hands full trying to drive off the
Spartan assault.
