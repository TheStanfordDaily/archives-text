The Stanford men's soccer
team will find out just what it
means to them today at 2 p.m. on
Maloney field. In its last Mountain
Division match versus San Jose
State, the Cardinal will attempt to
end league play with honor.
"We're playing for pride," said
sophomore goalkeeper Ryan
Craig.
Junior forward Carmen
D'Onofrio echoed the sentiment.
"We haven't beaten a Bay area
team yet, and [San Jose State] is
one of our rivals," he said.
"There's a lot of pride riding on
this game."
Stanford (4-11-2) no longer has
any chance of making the post
season playoffs due to last Sun
day's defeat at the hands of Cali
fornia. However, the Spartans
(13-4-0) remain in the hunt for a
playoff berth even though they
trail Stanford in the conference.
Because Stanford amassed a poor
overall record, it has no chance to
garner an at-large bid for the

Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion post-season tournament. The
Spartans, on the other hand, still
have hopes for an at-large bid due
to their strong overall perfor
mance.
"Since they still have a chance
to go to the tournament,"
D'Onofrio said, "maybe we can be
a spoiler."
The Spartans have a lot riding
on this game, however, and they
will prove themselves formidable
foes. Stanford head coach Colin
Lindores considers San Jose State
one of the most dramatically
improved teams in the division.
The Spartans' record bears that
evaluation out.
"We are absolutely looking to
get a win out of the game," Spar
tan head coach Gary St. Clair said.
Brian Weaver leads the Spar
tans with nine goals and 12
assists. With the talent and drive
that San Jose will bring to this
match, the Cardinal will have its
hands full trying to drive off the
Spartan assault.

develde and D'Onofrio will spear
head the Cardinal offense. Each has
recorded five goals for the season.
Stanford will also count on fresh
man forward / midfielder Justin
Leßlanc's scoring ability.

Defensively, the Cardinal will
regain the vital services of senior
defender Jeff Kogl today after a two
game suspension. Other important
figures in the Cardinal backfield
include sophomores Duncan Hill and
Brad Davies and junior Mark Walker.
All three have provided two seasons
of steady defense and solid passing.
Even with its wealth of talent,
however, Stanford will head into

today's contest with a realistic atti
tude of how to pull off a victory.
"You know it's not a fluke when
anyone comes in with that many
wins," D'Onofrio said. "We definitely
have to take them seriously, we can't
afford to not take anyone seriously."
Today's match and Sunday's
game versus UC-Santa Barbara
bear importance for reasons beyond
simply adding more tallies to Stan

ford's record. With so many fresh
man in the lineup due to injuries
suffered by established starters, the
coaching staff has an early chance to
evaluate players for next year.
"We're looking at players," Lin
dores said. "We are determining
what to depend on and what not to
depend on."
At this late date in the season,
the Cardinal can only accomplish

psychological and emotional goals
with a win today. However, with the
way this year has progressed for
Stanford, those goals are as impor
tant as any record or statistic.
"The last two games provide an
opportunity for us to end on a posi
tive note," Craig said. "Like the foot
ball team, our early expectations
have not been fulfilled. But, this is
an opportunity to save some face."
