A field hockey team can dom
inate a game in shots, posses
sions and penalty corners, but if
it doesn't score, it is not going
to win. )
That's what happened to
Stanford last Tuesday in its 2-1
loss to University of the Pacific.
The loss knocked the Cardinal
out of tonight's Northern Pacific
Conference Championship game.
"No one was able to put the
ball in the goal," said head coach
Sheryl Johnson. "It was a prob
lem the whole season. We have
inexperienced forwards."

Stanford (6-8-1, 2-4 in Nor-
Pac) dominated the first half. It
took most of the shots, obtained
numerous penalty corners and
controlled the midfield. The only
problem was that no one was able
to score.
Although the Cardinal con
trolled the first half, the game
remained scoreless at halftime.
In the second half, the Tigers
took control. Pacific's first score
came when freshman goalie
Kelly Naylor tackled an oncom
ing attacker, but was unable to
control the rebound. Pacific for
ward Wendy Dushane then put
the ball into the net. Jen Clan ton
scored another goal later in the
half to give the Tigers a two-goal
lead.
"After they scored their first
goal, we were able to put a lot of
pressure on them," senior tri-cap
tain Tina Syer said. "But we just
didn't finish."
Sophomore forward Cory Tay
lor scored Stanford's only goal of
the game with about a minute
left. The ball was crossed from
the left of the field, and then was
passed forward by a couple of Car
dinal players before Taylor gained
possession and found the goal.
"We played really hard and
with lots of intensity," junior tri
captain Leah Jacobs said. "(The
game] wasn't disappointing in
that respect, but it's disappoint
ing that we lost. I think we play
better than they do. We showed
that today but unfortunately the
team that scored the most won."
The loss dropped Stanford into
last place in NorPac behind Pacific
and conference winner California
Now the Cardinal has just one game
remaining in the season, a Saturday
match up against UC-Santa Bar
bara
"Our season really is over,"
Jacobs said. "We'll go in with a
fun attitude and try to finish on a
high note."
