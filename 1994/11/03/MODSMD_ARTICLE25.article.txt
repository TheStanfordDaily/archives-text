# Water polo to face UOP
##

Keep focused. The goal is in sight.
For the No. 1 Stanford men's water polo team, the
goal of defending its NCAA title lies ahead. The Cardi
nal has often dominated while amassing an overall
record of 17-1. By defeating No. 5 UCLA last Saturday,
Stanford finished regular-season Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation play in first place at 8-1.
Everything seems to be in place to repeat as nation
al champions. What coach Dante Dettamanti now wor
ries about is a loss of concentration which could cause
the Cardinal to stumble in the latter part of its sched
ule.
While Dettamanti is pleased with his team's perfor
mance, which includes a sweep of No. 2 USC and
UCLA on the road last weekend, the coach knows that
a letdown remains possible. When the Cardinal hits
the road today to meet University of the Pacific in
Stockton, the squad will look to squash any possibility
of such an event.
"UOP will be tough in their own pool," said senior
captain Wolf Wigo. "We lost last year at their place —
it could be a close game for about a half, but I think
we'll win."
The Tigers have enjoyed success in recent seasons,
making a debut appearance at the NCAA tournament
one year ago and rising as high as No. 3 in the nation
al rankings. This season, Pacific (14-9, 7-9 in MPSF)
features a younger lineup, led by driver Brad Schu
macher and holeman Rey Rivera.
Although the Cardinal easily defeated the Tigers
two weeks ago at deGuerre Pool by a score of 14-3, Det
tamanti and his team will not overlook today's contest.
"We handled them easily already at home, but any
game on the road is going to be tough," Dettamanti said.
"We had difficulty at their pool last year, when we lost."
A year ago, the Cardinal rode a 16-game winning
streak into Stockton before the Tigers provided a rude
awakening. The loss started a mild losing streak which
Stanford overcame to capture the NCAA title. The
Cardinal has triumphed in its past 11 games.
"At this point, we're in really good shape, having
only one loss," Dettamanti said. "Right now, everyone
is pretty healthy. We're getting serious preparing for
NCAAs."
Even more than the NCAAs,
which will take place Nov. 25-27
in Long Beach, Stanford players
are looking forward to Saturday's
matchup with California at
deGuerre Pool.
"We need to get past UOP
before we worry about Cal," Det
tamanti said. "Our only problem
may be looking past UOP to Cal —
that worries me a little bit. We def
initely have to prepare for Cal, but
we can't afford to overlook UOP."

The Cardinal saw success
against Pacific earlier this year due
in large part to the play of junior
goalie Jack Bo wen, the defensive
performance of Jeremy Laster and a
superior fast-break counter-attack.
"We're playing really well as
a team," Dettamanti said.
"We're getting key goals from
different people and spreading
the scoring out. I don't think we
have any weaknesses — we're a
well-rounded team."
With the Cardinal firing on all
cylinders, the immediate goal is
to dispose of Pacific once again.
The long range goal of another
NCAA championship will come in
time.
