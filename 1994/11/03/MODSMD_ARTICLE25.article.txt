Keep focused. The goal is in sight.
For the No. 1 Stanford men's water polo team, the
goal of defending its NCAA title lies ahead. The Cardi
nal has often dominated while amassing an overall
record of 17-1. By defeating No. 5 UCLA last Saturday,
Stanford finished regular-season Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation play in first place at 8-1.
Everything seems to be in place to repeat as nation
al champions. What coach Dante Dettamanti now wor

the Cardinal to stumble in the latter part of its sched

While Dettamanti is pleased with his team's perfor
mance, which includes a sweep of No. 2 USC and
UCLA on the road last weekend, the coach knows that
a letdown remains possible. When the Cardinal hits
the road today to meet University of the Pacific in
Stockton, the squad will look to squash any possibility
of such an event.
"UOP will be tough in their own pool," said senior
captain Wolf Wigo. "We lost last year at their place â€”
it could be a close game for about a half, but I think
we'll win."
The Tigers have enjoyed success in recent seasons,
making a debut appearance at the NCAA tournament
one year ago and rising as high as No. 3 in the nation
al rankings. This season, Pacific (14-9, 7-9 in MPSF)
features a younger lineup, led by driver Brad Schu
macher and holeman Rey Rivera.
Although the Cardinal easily defeated the Tigers
two weeks ago at deGuerre Pool by a score of 14-3, Det
tamanti and his team will not overlook today's contest.
"We handled them easily already at home, but any
game on the road is going to be tough," Dettamanti said.
"We had difficulty at their pool last year, when we lost."
A year ago, the Cardinal rode a 16-game winning
streak into Stockton before the Tigers provided a rude
awakening. The loss started a mild losing streak which
Stanford overcame to capture the NCAA title. The
Cardinal has triumphed in its past 11 games.
"At this point, we're in really good shape, having
only one loss," Dettamanti said. "Right now, everyone
is pretty healthy. We're getting serious preparing for
