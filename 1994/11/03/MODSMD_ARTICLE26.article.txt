# Skipper Charles Meade off to Nationals

Senior skipper Charles Meade has done it
all this year for the Cardinal sailing team.
As a jack-of-all-trades, Meade has proven
himself an integral cog on Stanford's ninth
ranked team. He has contributed as an impor

a leader in the sloops competitions and a
stand-out in singlehanded races. This week
end however, at the Singlehanded Nationals

at St. Mary's College of Maryland, Meade will
have an opportunity to attain individual glory
against the nation's best.
Meade qualified in fine fashion earlier this
season at the Singlehanded Districts held in
early October at UC-Irvine. He dominated a
tough field, including highly-touted Anteater
skippers Peter Wells and Andy Beeckman,
winning by 23 points. He didn't face many
slouches then, and he won't face many this
weekend either.
"This is certainly going to be a very tough

regatta," Mead said. "Everyone's going to be
there. The competition will be extremely
tough, but I've beaten all of them before.
Then again, they've all beaten me before, too."
The competition includes local favorite
Mike Hare from St. Mary's, John Torgerson
from Old Dominion and Mark Mendelblatt
from Tufts, last year's overwhelming winner.
"Charles is probably not the favorite to
win, but there's no reason he can't finish in
