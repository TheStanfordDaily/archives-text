# Skipper Charles Meade off to Nationals
## 
### Daniel Kao Contributing Writer 
Senior skipper Charles Meade has done it
all this year for the Cardinal sailing team.
As a jack-of-all-trades, Meade has proven
himself an integral cog on Stanford's ninth
ranked team. He has contributed as an impor
tant member of the two-person dinghy fleets,
a leader in the sloops competitions and a
stand-out in singlehanded races. This week
end however, at the Singlehanded Nationals

at St. Mary's College of Maryland, Meade will
have an opportunity to attain individual glory
against the nation's best.
Meade qualified in fine fashion earlier this
season at the Singlehanded Districts held in
early October at UC-Irvine. He dominated a
tough field, including highly-touted Anteater
skippers Peter Wells and Andy Beeckman,
winning by 23 points. He didn't face many
slouches then, and he won't face many this
weekend either.
"This is certainly going to be a very tough

regatta," Mead said. "Everyone's going to be
there. The competition will be extremely
tough, but I've beaten all of them before.
Then again, they've all beaten me before, too."
The competition includes local favorite
Mike Hare from St. Mary's, John Torgerson
from Old Dominion and Mark Mendelblatt
from Tufts, last year's overwhelming winner.
"Charles is probably not the favorite to
win, but there's no reason he can't finish in

the top three," said Stanford coach
Steve Bourdow. "The most impor
tant thing is for him to get his skills
straight. He's probably not as pre
pared as he would like to be because
of the time he's spent racing with
the other type of boats instead of
the singlehanded Laser ones that
will be used in this race."
Meade realizes the work ahead
and knows that glory on the Chesa
peake won't come easy.
"I know I'll be competitive,"
Meade said. "A top-five finish will

be really solid, and I'll be very happy
with a top-three finish."
Elsewhere this weekend, the
fourth-ranked women's sailing
team and the freshmen / sophomore
team will sail in the Fall Districts
hosted by UC-Santa Cruz. Only
four teams from the North Pacific
district will compete at the event.
For the women, the regatta will
determine which teams will qualify
to sail in the more prestigious regat
tas this spring. Stanford will likely
field a formidable lineup including
junior skippers Cinnamon
Hampikian and Gretchen Uznis,
and sophomore skipper Alice Man
ard.
"Our women's team is clearly

the best in the district," Bourdow
said. "Our goal is to win, and we
should."
As for the freshmen / sophomore
races, little more will be at stake
than an opportunity to let the
younger members of the team sail.
The regatta will provide a wonder
ful chance for many of the Cardinal
standout freshmen skippers, like
Phil Barow, John Meade, and
Danny Zimbaldi, to showcase their
talents.
"We probably will have the
strongest frosh / soph team out
there as well," Bourdow said. "It's
good to get them out there to sail.
Our teams should put on a good
regatta."
