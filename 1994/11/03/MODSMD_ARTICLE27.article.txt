# Instruction, jest and criticism
## The 						discourse of men's soccer coach Colin Lindores 
### Jordan Wruble Staff writer 
The lack of a strong tradition in
American soccer is slowly being
remedied, in part because of people
like men's soccer coach Colin Lin
dores. According to the Scottish
born Lindores, the gap in experi
ence and knowledge in soccer
between the U.S. and the rest of
the world impelled him to coach at
Stanford.
"When I came over to this coun
try," he explained, "soccer wasn't as
popular as it is now. I thought there
was a need for people in the game."
In the 19505, the Cardinal
coach played at Sequoia High
School in Redwood City. "We start
ed a team there — it was the only
team on the peninsula." Lindores
learned early on that breaking new
ground with soccer in America
would be far from an easy task.
"The principal would not give
us a bus to travel," Lindores said.
"The uniforms we received were
the old football jerseys. It was a
rag-tag bunch."
Lindores' success with advanc
ing soccer in the U.S. has not sep
arated him from his heritage, as
evidenced by his lingering Scot
tish brogue. His emotion accentu
ates his accent, according to
senior midfielder Greg Wilson.
"When he starts to get upset,"

Wilson said, "you can tell he's a
full-blown Scotsman."
Today, soccer in the U.S. is, in
Lindores' words, "healthy." How
ever, Lindores, whose involve
ment with the U.S. national team
spans 18 years, feels that a lack of
a professional league in the U.S.
has hindered progress.

'He says you might be
able to hide in real life
but you can't hide on
the soccer field. He
gives you a good out
look on life.'

"Our players are probably bet
ter than we give them credit for,"
the coach said. "Unless you're
challenged, you're never going to
find out how good you really
are.
It is this concept of relentless
challenge that drives Lindores'
coaching philosophy. He consis
tently confronts his players with
their weaknesses and demands
they respond by playing tougher,
smarter, better.
"He's not the kind of guy who

hands out a lot of compliments,"
Wilson said. Though vocal, in Wil
son's opinion, the coach "brings
out the best in his players."
Lindores lays it all out for his
players. According to senior Jeff
Kogl, "[Lindores] equates soccer
with real life. He says you might be
able to hide in real life but you
can't hide on the soccer field. He
gives you a good outlook on life."
The leader of the Cardinal kick
ers is quick with a quip.
"He's got great one-liners,"
senior Ryan Estevez said. After
one game, according to Estevez,
Lindores told one of his players
who had a poor game, "You know
what? I'm gonna kick your ass.
Just for the hell of it."
"When he's talking to the team,
he's usually criticizing them," Wil
son said. "When he notices he
starts to compliment someone ...
he has to end with a criticism."
Wilson likes to tease Lindores
when he verges on praise. "Coach,"
Wilson will interrupt, "that sounds
like a compliment."
Lindores' style may be tough to
handle, and the coach knows he's
likely misunderstood. "My sense of
humor is a little more sarcastic
than it should be," he said. "[The
players] don't know whether I'm
serious or not."
According to a player who
vished to remain anonymous, the
harsh criticisms from the coach are
tough to digest. "I think it just
wears on you. It's funny for a while,
then ... you play just not to get
yelled at. It can stunt the growth of
the more sensitive players."
Asked what the effect of the
taunting had on his team,
Estevez said, "Look at our
record," in reference to the Cardi
nal's disappointing 4-11-2 overall
performance. However, Estevez
also said, "If he yells at you, it's
his way of complimenting you."
While the coach tends to criti
cize, Wilson said, "He does it in a
humorous way." According to
Kogl, Lindores had a good time
teasing a couple of players who
dyed their hair.
"He brought up Dennis Rod
man [a basketball player noted for
excellent defense and shocking
hair color)," Kogl said. "He said,
Tou'd better play defense like him
or else."'
Sometimes, Lindores might go

too far. "He's not afraid to use eth
nic taunts," said Estevez, who is
Cuban. According to Estevez, if a
player is late or makes a mistake,
the coach will say, "just like a
Cuban," or "just like a Canadian."
Lindores is aware of the barrier
he builds between himself and his
players, however. "I purposely try
not to get involved with them on
any friendship situation beyond
the field," he said. "If you're going
to be their buddy, you've lost some
thing. There's a line that you as a
coach should not cross. ... In
order to respect each other, you
keep your distance."
The style Lindores employs
finds its motivation in the nature
of the sport. Soccer requires that
players are prepared to compete
for an entire half without council
from the coach.
"This is not a sport in which you
can take time-out," Lindores said.
"[Coaches] have very little control
over the game. Once the game
begins, I largely become a spectator.
"If the players keep looking to
the sideline for the secrets of the
game, I keep telling them, 'Don't
look over here. You are the
secret.'"
It's a tough lesson to teach.
