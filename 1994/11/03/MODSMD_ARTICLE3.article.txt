# New program targets select admits

Stanford's first Presidential Scholars
will be honored tonight at a dinner at the
Faculty Club. The scholars were recog
nized by a new recruitment program
that targets select members of the in
coming freshman class. ,
The Presidential Scholarship pro
gram is a new title for the Jordan Schol
arship program, which the admissions
office began in 1986 as an attempt to pro
vide highly-qualified freshmen with a
non-monetary incentive to attend Stan
ford.
With the new title, however, comes a
slightly new twist. In the past, Jordan

Scholars would simply attend a lun
cheon with a dean for an informal chat.
This year, however, the program will
have a little more structure, said John
Reider, associate director of admissions
and the new program's coordinator.
Because of interest displayed by Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper and
Provost Condoleezza Rice, a new effort
has been made this year to push the
scholarship program, Reider said.
"We felt that it was a useful thing to
make so students would feel good about
being admitted," he said. "They get it
with their offer in the spring as a recruit
ing technique."
While all Stanford students have the

opportunity to work closely and do re
search with a professor, the new Presi
dential program is aimed at students
who seem to be more interested in this
opportunity.
The Presidential Scholarship pro
gram, like the Jordan Scholarship pro
gram, targets a very small percentage of
freshman whose academic credentials
stand out, Reider said. The admissions
office looks at a combination of grades,
test scores and difficulty of high school
program along with recommendations
which show that the students have ex
ceptional drive, he added.
I jess than 10 percent of the
incoming class are targeted,
although there is no set number
of students awarded this honor,
he said.
While Stanford does not offer
merit scholarships due to the
higher priority of offering finan
cial aid, the Presidential Scholar
ship program is a way to single
out students who show exception
al academic achievement and
ability, Reider said.
"We can't give them a better
roommate or a better view from
their room, but this is a way for
them to get some extra attention
into working closely with profes
sors," he added.
While the number of students
who take this honor into consid
eration when accepting Stanford
is unknown, "it's better than not
having it," Reider said.
A decision was made to change
the name of the Jordan Scholar
ship program because few stu
dents are aware that this pro
gram was named after Stanford's
first president.
"We decided to call the pro
gram 'Presidential Scholarship
Program' to focus attention on

the fact that the honor does come
from the highest levels of
endorsement in the University,"
Reider said.
Attending this dinner are this
year's scholars, faculty members
who have shown an interest in
undergraduate education, and
upperclass students who are cur
rently doing research or would
provide good role models for the
freshman class.
Upperclass students were cho
sen from recommendations from
various areas on campus, such as
the Honors College and the
Structured Liberal Education
program.
"Old Jordan scholars have not
been sought out specifically, but I
wouldn't be surprised if there
was some overlap," Reider said.
"We're trying to get freshmen
energized by seeing other stu
dents working closely with pro
fessors."
Casper and Human Biology
Prof. Herant Katchadourian will
be speaking at the dinner.
Katchadourian has shown great
interest in undergraduate educa
tion by conducting research on
the types of students that attend
Stanford and their career picks,
Reider said. The professor has
followed a group of students for
15 years and may talk about his
findings.
