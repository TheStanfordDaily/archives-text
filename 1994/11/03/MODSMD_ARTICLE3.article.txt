# New program targets select admits

Stanford's first Presidential Scholars
will be honored tonight at a dinner at the
Faculty Club. The scholars were recog
nized by a new recruitment program
that targets select members of the in
coming freshman class. ,
The Presidential Scholarship pro
gram is a new title for the Jordan Schol
arship program, which the admissions
office began in 1986 as an attempt to pro
vide highly-qualified freshmen with a
non-monetary incentive to attend Stan
ford.
With the new title, however, comes a
slightly new twist. In the past, Jordan

Scholars would simply attend a lun
cheon with a dean for an informal chat.
This year, however, the program will
have a little more structure, said John
Reider, associate director of admissions
and the new program's coordinator.
Because of interest displayed by Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper and
Provost Condoleezza Rice, a new effort
has been made this year to push the
scholarship program, Reider said.
"We felt that it was a useful thing to
make so students would feel good about
being admitted," he said. "They get it
with their offer in the spring as a recruit
ing technique."
While all Stanford students have the

opportunity to work closely and do re
search with a professor, the new Presi
dential program is aimed at students
who seem to be more interested in this
opportunity.
The Presidential Scholarship pro
gram, like the Jordan Scholarship pro
gram, targets a very small percentage of
freshman whose academic credentials
stand out, Reider said. The admissions
office looks at a combination of grades,
test scores and difficulty of high school
program along with recommendations
which show that the students have ex
ceptional drive, he added.
