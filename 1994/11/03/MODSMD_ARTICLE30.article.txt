Bullets Over Broadway
Woody Allen's latest film, "Bullets
over Broadway," manages to hit its
target, but fails to strike the bull's
eye. While the cast delivers genuine
and captivating performances,
Allen's heavy-handed writing seems
to cast a shadow over the whole pro
duction. The film is set in New York
during the 1920s and centers
around the world of gangsters and,
believe it or not, the theater. John
Cusack ("Say Anything," "Better Off
Dead") stars as struggling playwright
David Shayne, who has the uncanny
ability to write intensely deep plays
that flop.The movie overall delivers a
good bit of humor backed up by ex
cellent casting and sincere dialogue.
The acting, however, gets bogged
down by extra subplots and Allen's
over-written script
Ed Wood
Direct the worst films in all of Ameri
can cinematic history and what hap
pens to you? Hollywood recreates
your life on the silver screen.
Producer/director Tim Burton's latest
filmatic endeavor does just that. "Ed
Wood" delves into the relatively un
known public and curious private life
of the inept horror flick director with a

tenderness and understanding usu
ally reserved for mainstream heroes
and martyrs.
Love Affair
In "Sleepless in Seattle," Meg Ryan'i
eyes overflow with tears as she
watches the final scene of "An Affair
to Remember," sniffling and sighing
as she fantasizes about her love life
paralleling the movie. Even before
"Sleepless in Seattle" re-popularizec
the film, "An Affair to Remember"
was a classic, guaranteed to make
you cry and view the Empire State
Building as most romantic piece of
architecture this side of Las Vegas.
"Love Affair" is a not-so-timely re
make of the 1957 Cary Grant-Debo
rah Kerr weeper (itself a remake of
the 1939 film), this time starring real
life husband and wife Annette Ben
ing and Warren Beatty. The movie
sticks pretty close to the original, es
pecially at the end, changing only
the time period and characters' pro
fessions and inexplicably adding the
threat of a plane crash (possibly to
draw in the action-adventure crowd)
A classic script and strong acting
qualify "Love Affair" as a decent
movie, especially for the romantic.
However, the problem is this: Why

pay $7.50 to see a paler version of a
great film one can rent for $3.15?
Take a trip down to Blockbuster,
sack out and cry for two hours.
New Nightmare
Writer-director Wes Craven, the cre
ator of "A Nightmare on Elm Street,"
has finally proven that an bad idea
sometimes never dies. In the latest
addition to the "Nightmare" series,
Wes Craven's "New Nightmare," the
evil Freddy Krueger (Robert En
glund) returns to terrorize Heather
Langenkamp (played by herself) in
an uninspired re-hashing of the origi
nal story. Only this time the premise
is even flimsier than usual.
Only You
Move "Sleepless in Seattle" into
Rome, and you've got "Only You,"
starring Robert Downey Jr. and
Marisa Tomei. Perfectly cast as the
star-crossed lovers, Tomei and
Downey's chemistry lights up the
screen. For Downey, "Only You" is
familiar territory; the film is similar to
his other magical, romantic come
dies, such as "Heart and Souls" and
"Chances Are." Tomei also displays
a great feel for comedy, and the
screenplay showcases her abundant

natural charm. At once sweet and
funny, "Only You" is definitely a
heart-warming movie. Go see it —
maybe you'll meet the one you're
destined for in the popcorn line.
Pulp Fiction
It's good.
Damn good.
See it.
The Specialist
Billed as an exciting and explosive
action film, "The Specialist" can only
deliver half of the goods. While there
are plenty of actual explosions,
some basic elements of a good
movie are lacking — character and
plot. Following a by-the-numbers
storyline, the movie moves along at a
sluggish pacE. The weak and convo
luted plot revolves around May Mal
one's (Stone) desire to hire explo
sives expert Ray Quick (Stallone) to
avenge the death of her parents by a
member of an organized crime fami
ly. Even though the obligatory sex
scene between Stone and Stallone
is somewhat tame, these two stars
do make for an interesting pairing —
which is almost enough to make
"The Specialist" worth the price of
admission.

sluggish pacE. The weak and convo
luted plot revolves around May Mal
one's (Stone) desire to hire explo
sives expert Ray Quick (Stallone) to
avenge the death of her parents by a
member of an organized crime fami
ly. Even though the obligatory sex
scene between Stone and Stallone
is somewhat tame, these two stars
do make for an interesting pairing —
which is almost enough to make
"The Specialist" worth the price of
admission.
