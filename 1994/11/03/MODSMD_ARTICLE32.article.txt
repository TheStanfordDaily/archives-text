# Of bagels and DIY guides: tales from the indie rocker crypt
## 
### Arnold Pan 
All parents have dreams for their children
to be lawyers and doctors," Tsunami
guitarist Kristin Thomson says when
asked what she'd be doing with her life if she
wasn't an indie rocker by trade. Thomson gives a
non-committal response, answering that she's
never had concrete career plans. With a sociology
degree to her name, she muses that research
might suit her fancy. And that, about a year and a
half ago, she was an activist working with the Na
tional Organization of Women before the D.C
band turned from a hobby into her primary oc
cupation.
l or the time being, Thomson tours and makes
records with Tsunami, sells them through her in
dependently-owned record label Simple Ma
chines and works part-time at bagel shop to keep

the other two going.
"When we're not touring, we definitely have to
work," Thomson says, pointing out that her co
horts Jenny Toomey and Andrew Webster are
also hi)lding di>wn jobs, t he former at Kinki >'sand
the latter at a weekly paper in 1).(Only drummer
John Pamer isn't currently working, but that she
cause he's finishing up school after taking semes
ters off at a time to play in the band.
In many senses, Tsunami typifies the newest
wave of I )o-It-Yourself indie bands, with a place
at the front of the line of today's smart, friendly,
call-'ein-by-their-first-name punk rock kids.
Along with fellow geek hands like Velocity Ciirl
and Versus, the quartet is giving pop music a jolt,
mixingheady melodies with nervy (s)punk to cre
ate tunes which bite and smile at the same time.
After a few failed attempts at characteriz
ing Tsunami's craft. Thomson describes
it as "heavy pop" that doesn't stick to
regular song structures. Their songs are about
growing up and maturing in the now-generation,
reflecting itself not only in the lyrics, hut also in
the sound of the music itself, lust listen to the raw
edged jingle-jangle of Tsunami's debut, "Deep
Tnd," and compare il to the melancholy cool of
the hand's latest, "The I leart's Tremolo," released
this past spring.
"For me, the first record was recorded with
only one year playing the guitar," 1 homson says.
"You do what you can. 1 go back and listen to it
and, oh God, there are so many mistakes. But it
doesn't matter. That was that, that was then, so
who cares?
"You know, you just start experimenting more
with stuff if you want to develop as a person who
can play guitar. So, 1 think that was all in the back
of our minds, really. I ike, 'Oh, I'd like to try this
now.'Or,' I hat person plays like that. I want to try
that in a song.' That all kind of gelled. And it must
he something inside us all, as a hand, that makes
us not want to repeat stuff very often, to repeat
styles and things and recreate songs that we've al
ready done."
Thomson explains that "The Heart's Tremo
lo" is "more moody," the result of the band
"messing around with rhythms." The new batch
of songs certainly are more subdued and intricate
than the energetic pop ditties on "Deep End,"
where the mellowed instruments combine with
guitarist / singer Jenny Toomey's wry, wearied
vocals to paint vivid vignettes of what's become of
someone else's life, of frustration and unfulfilled
expectation.
Yet none of these portraits are depressing, if
only because Toomey reassures us with her
knowing voice; she may not have the answers, but
at least she's figured out what's wrong. As she
sings on "Quietnova": "Can't say I didn't warn
you."
That's not to say that "Heart's" is without the
visceral punch of' Deep Tnd." The opener, "Loud
is as Loud I)oes," sounds like a classic I-gotta-get
outta-here tune, where the urgent rhythm section
and the nervously chimy guitars followToomey's
search for "someone in this town that's well read."
"Be Like That" is probably the band's catchiest
song to date; Toomey does more with a three
word chorus than any human can be expected to,
breaking through the fidgety repose of the incisive
verses and marching guitars and drums with a
thrilling wail. In the song, Tsunami finds the gold
en mean between the intensity of the previous
album and the deliberate skill displayed on
"Heart's."
As rewarding as Tsunami's musical growth
is, the band's success story proves all the
more heartening because they've done it
hy themselves through their Simple Machines

label. Now a successful and visible small business
with over thirty releases in its catalog, Simple Ma
chines started out humbly in the winter of 1989 as
a means for Toomey to release material by her
pre-Tsunami gig, Geek. Toomey and her friend
Brad Sigal enlisted other area bands to join Geek
on the first seven-inch, setting in motion what
would become a six-record, multi-band compila
tion known simply as "The Machines." When
Sigal returned to college, Thomson became
Toomey's partner, both in the business and in
Tsunami.
"For me, its definitely the idea that you could
create a small business or even a hobby that be
comes something bigger and more established,"
Thomson says, describing the motivations dri
ving Simple Machines. "Through experience and
a lot of advice from people, you can create some
thing self-sustaining. You could be very creative
in it and challenge basic business practices, even.
If you have employees, you involve them in
things. I'm really interested in small business and
entrepreneurship. And the record thing is great,
because I love music. We're helping our friends'
bands and it's totally creative."
Indeed, creativity and just being nice sets
Simple Machines apart from other exempla
of the Do-lt-Yourself ethic. These qualities
seem to engender themselves in all of their pro
jects, whether it's helping to distribute a CD
made by their intern Trevor or finding an ex
cuse to throw a weekend-long party for 550 of
Simple Machines' closest friends, as was the
purpose of the "Working Holiday" singles se
ries. Even more, Thomson and Toomey are so

daily conscious, contributing proceeds from
CD compilations to charities. And then there's
the matter of the Simple Machines' now famous
24-page guide to putting out records, perhaps
its biggest contribution to the indie rock com
munity.
"Mike D. of the Beastie Boys said something
[ about it | recently, so that, of course, started a tor
rent ot mail here, which made it go out of print
again," Thomson notes. "That's why it's taking so
long. Which is line, because we love that sort of
stuff.
"The basic reason we put it together was not
to assume we could influence young people and
say, 'Do it like us.' It was more out of practicality.
We get a lot of requests every day from young
bands that are wanting us to help them put out
seven inches and 'sign' them to Simple Machines.
Unfortunately, we're really tiny as far as time
goes. There's only the two of u5.... This gave us
something to give to people [rather than] say,
'Sorry, we can't help you.' The only thing we can
help you with is information and you can do it
yourself."
As Tsunami continues to collect flattering
press and Simple Machines keeps attracting the
attention ot publications like The Village Voice
and Sassy, Thomson foresees the day when both
might become too big to handle. There's even a
two-year plan in the works, when Tsunami be
comes a full-time occupation once drummer
Pamer graduates. The odds of Thomson becom
ing a lawyer are looking like slim to none. But at
least her parents are learning to deal: "The more
press we get, the more they realize it's okay," she
says. â–

Guitarist Kristin Thomson (far right) and the rest of the band make their way through
the Do-lt-Yourself scene while holding "day" jobs and trying to finish school.
All parents have dreams for their children
to be lawyers and doctors," Tsunami
guitarist Kristin Thomson says when
asked what she'd be doing with her life if she
wasn't an indie rocker by trade. Thomson gives a
non-committal response, answering that she's
never had concrete career plans. With a sociology
degree to her name, she muses that research
might suit her fancy. And that, about a year and a
half ago, she was an activist working with the Na
tional Organization of Women before the D.C
band turned from a hobby into her primary oc
cupation.
l or the time being, Thomson tours and makes
records with Tsunami, sells them through her in
dependently-owned record label Simple Ma
chines and works part-time at bagel shop to keep

the other two going.
"When we're not touring, we definitely have to
work," Thomson says, pointing out that her co
horts Jenny Toomey and Andrew Webster are
also hi)lding di>wn jobs, t he former at Kinki >'sand
the latter at a weekly paper in 1).(Only drummer
John Pamer isn't currently working, but that she
cause he's finishing up school after taking semes
ters off at a time to play in the band.
In many senses, Tsunami typifies the newest
wave of I )o-It-Yourself indie bands, with a place
at the front of the line of today's smart, friendly,
call-'ein-by-their-first-name punk rock kids.
Along with fellow geek hands like Velocity Ciirl
and Versus, the quartet is giving pop music a jolt,
mixingheady melodies with nervy (s)punk to cre
ate tunes which bite and smile at the same time.
After a few failed attempts at characteriz
ing Tsunami's craft. Thomson describes
it as "heavy pop" that doesn't stick to
regular song structures. Their songs are about
growing up and maturing in the now-generation,
reflecting itself not only in the lyrics, hut also in
the sound of the music itself, lust listen to the raw
edged jingle-jangle of Tsunami's debut, "Deep
Tnd," and compare il to the melancholy cool of
the hand's latest, "The I leart's Tremolo," released
this past spring.
"For me, the first record was recorded with
only one year playing the guitar," 1 homson says.
"You do what you can. 1 go back and listen to it
and, oh God, there are so many mistakes. But it
doesn't matter. That was that, that was then, so
who cares?
"You know, you just start experimenting more
with stuff if you want to develop as a person who
can play guitar. So, 1 think that was all in the back
of our minds, really. I ike, 'Oh, I'd like to try this
now.'Or,' I hat person plays like that. I want to try
that in a song.' That all kind of gelled. And it must
he something inside us all, as a hand, that makes
us not want to repeat stuff very often, to repeat
styles and things and recreate songs that we've al
ready done."
Thomson explains that "The Heart's Tremo
lo" is "more moody," the result of the band
"messing around with rhythms." The new batch
of songs certainly are more subdued and intricate
than the energetic pop ditties on "Deep End,"
where the mellowed instruments combine with
guitarist / singer Jenny Toomey's wry, wearied
vocals to paint vivid vignettes of what's become of
someone else's life, of frustration and unfulfilled
expectation.
Yet none of these portraits are depressing, if
only because Toomey reassures us with her
knowing voice; she may not have the answers, but
at least she's figured out what's wrong. As she
sings on "Quietnova": "Can't say I didn't warn
you."
That's not to say that "Heart's" is without the
visceral punch of' Deep Tnd." The opener, "Loud
is as Loud I)oes," sounds like a classic I-gotta-get
outta-here tune, where the urgent rhythm section
and the nervously chimy guitars followToomey's
search for "someone in this town that's well read."
"Be Like That" is probably the band's catchiest
song to date; Toomey does more with a three
word chorus than any human can be expected to,
breaking through the fidgety repose of the incisive
verses and marching guitars and drums with a
thrilling wail. In the song, Tsunami finds the gold
en mean between the intensity of the previous
album and the deliberate skill displayed on
"Heart's."
As rewarding as Tsunami's musical growth
is, the band's success story proves all the
more heartening because they've done it
hy themselves through their Simple Machines

label. Now a successful and visible small business
with over thirty releases in its catalog, Simple Ma
chines started out humbly in the winter of 1989 as
a means for Toomey to release material by her
pre-Tsunami gig, Geek. Toomey and her friend
Brad Sigal enlisted other area bands to join Geek
on the first seven-inch, setting in motion what
would become a six-record, multi-band compila
tion known simply as "The Machines." When
Sigal returned to college, Thomson became
Toomey's partner, both in the business and in
Tsunami.
"For me, its definitely the idea that you could
create a small business or even a hobby that be
comes something bigger and more established,"
Thomson says, describing the motivations dri
ving Simple Machines. "Through experience and
a lot of advice from people, you can create some
thing self-sustaining. You could be very creative
in it and challenge basic business practices, even.
If you have employees, you involve them in
things. I'm really interested in small business and
entrepreneurship. And the record thing is great,
because I love music. We're helping our friends'
bands and it's totally creative."
Indeed, creativity and just being nice sets
Simple Machines apart from other exempla
of the Do-lt-Yourself ethic. These qualities
seem to engender themselves in all of their pro
jects, whether it's helping to distribute a CD
made by their intern Trevor or finding an ex
cuse to throw a weekend-long party for 550 of
Simple Machines' closest friends, as was the
purpose of the "Working Holiday" singles se
ries. Even more, Thomson and Toomey are so

daily conscious, contributing proceeds from
CD compilations to charities. And then there's
the matter of the Simple Machines' now famous
24-page guide to putting out records, perhaps
its biggest contribution to the indie rock com
munity.
"Mike D. of the Beastie Boys said something
[ about it | recently, so that, of course, started a tor
rent ot mail here, which made it go out of print
again," Thomson notes. "That's why it's taking so
long. Which is line, because we love that sort of
stuff.
"The basic reason we put it together was not
to assume we could influence young people and
say, 'Do it like us.' It was more out of practicality.
We get a lot of requests every day from young
bands that are wanting us to help them put out
seven inches and 'sign' them to Simple Machines.
Unfortunately, we're really tiny as far as time
goes. There's only the two of u5.... This gave us
something to give to people [rather than] say,
'Sorry, we can't help you.' The only thing we can
help you with is information and you can do it
