# L 7 — Changing their image They're not 'fucking action figures' anymore

### Taylor Antrim 
is awesome," says Donita
/ Sparks, guitarist and vocalist for the
¥ w hard core foursome 1.7, "You would
not believe the hair-do I have. I mean, we're
talking Loretta Lynn,circa ISM?."
On the other end of the phone I'm trying to
imagine Sparks cruising around Nashville
topped with Grand ole Opry curls, but no pic
tures come to my head. Combat boots and
studded leather would be one thing, but metal
queen turned I lank Williams groupie I cannot
see.
"Suzi [Gardner, L 7's other guitarist] and I
just went to the Country Music Hall of Fame,
and I think people thought we were like the
Mickey Mouse people, you know? l ike when
you go to Disney Land and there's Mickey and
Goofy and stuff. People were thinking we were
the exhibit."
Uh-huh.
I've been on the phone with Sparks for less
than a minute, and I'm already wondering who
I'm talking to. Can this all-women L.A.-core
band really afford to gallivant around the coun
try music mecca without any shame? Aren't
they supposed to have huge attitudes? Aren't
they supposed to booze and party and, like,
kick the shit out of people or something?
"Oh, and we just lovedOpryland."
Opryland?
Time to reassess, I suppose. The mythic
tampon incident of 1992 (yes, withdrawn and
tossed into an unsuspecting mosh-pit) and
other stories had rooted these women of metal
punk somewhere left of endearing quirkiness.
In fact, intimidation had set in before I even di
aled Nashville. Stories of mile-high hairdos and
theme parks understandably caught me off
guard.
A penchant for country music seems
unexpected from these veterans of
the Southern California hard-core
scene. Struggling side-by-side for recognition
in L.A. clubs, Sparks and Gardner recruited
bassist Jennifer Finch and drummer Roy Kout
sky in 1986, and in 1988 saw the release of their
first LP. Produced by bad Religion frontman
Brett Gurewitz for the now famous indepen
dent label Epitaph Records (of Offspring
fame), their self-titled debut emerged from a
firmly punk foundation and set the stage for
their later success.
Dee Plakas soon replaced Koutsky, and, two
years later with the classic LP "Smell the
Magic," the four women began the first of three
albums of thrash and crunch guitars, fuck-you
lyrics, and grinding rhythms. Theirs became a
caustic, claustrophobic sound, but one that
couldn't help but reveal near-suffocated strains
of pop catchiness.
1992's major-label debut "Bricks are
Heavy," brought L 7 to radio and MTV recogni
tion when their first single, "Pretend We're
Dead" subsequently caught fire. The album,
despite sporting their characteristic ear-bleed
ing punch, featured lyrics and liner notes of a
much less serious tilt. Playfulness bounced
through songs like "Shitlist," 'Wargasm, and
"Everglade" inflating the band's image into an
overblown parody of itself. "Bricks..." with its

double-dare us mentality kept L 7's fans laugh
ing, but sapped the band of some of its credi
bility.
Sparks explains further, "This cartooney
image that people have of us as being these
fucking action figures or something — it real
ly wasn't an intentional thing..." In fact,
Sparks regrets much about "Bricks..."
" 'Bricks are Heavy' had a lot ofdifferent in
fluences in the songwriting, you know, and so
those songs should've sounded much different
from song to song, but they all kind of got ho
mogenized in the mastering process. The
mixes sounded great, but we weren't around
for the mastering session and everything got
really smoothed out. That was really unfortu
nate."
The image problem was especially off
putting for a band with such serious political
concerns. In 1991 L 7 joined forces with the ac
tivist group The Feminist Majority Founda
tion, to found an organization called Rock for
Choice. Benefit concerts featuring bands like
Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Hole and the Red Hot Chili
Peppers raised hundreds-of-thousands of dol
lars for awareness of women's rights and to
promote a woman's right to a safe and legal
abortion.

While L 7's newest CD"Hungry For
Stink," could not be called a political
album, it does reflect an eagerness to
be finally rid of their "action-figure image."
Gone is the tongue-in-cheek ambiance, the
larger-than-life caricatures of "Bricks are
Heavy." The newest release also feels fuller and,
if possible, heavier than anything they've ever
done. Songs like "Baggage" and "Fuel My Fire"
blow the top off of anything on "Bricks..."
"We wanted a grittier sound," says Sparks.
"We wanted to have songs sound different
from each other not only in the songwriting but
in the recording process. We wanted the more
luck-shit-up punk rock stuff like 'Andres' and
then we wanted a little bit different thing with
'Stuck Here Again' and 'Shirley.'"
The lyrics on "Hungry For Stink" also differ
from L 7's previous releases. "Shitlist" from
"Bricks are Heavy" became the bands' political
rallying cry, adding various right-wing groups
to a growing list of offenders. "When 1 get mad
and I get pissed/1 grab my pen and I write out a
list." "Everglade" attacked a narrower group;
beefy, sexist, male moshers who think women
can't stage dive with the best of them. "So you
wanna have some fun?/ So break out the big
guns" sings Sparks on that album, and you can

almost hear her sneer.
"Hungry For Slink," though, contains less
bravado, revealing a more personal and vul
nerable side to l.7's characteristic verbal as
sault. "Can I Run" turns the tables on the
come-and-get-me feel of "Everglade" with
lines like "Switch to paranoid from having fun/
will he use his hands, knife, or a gun?/ Knuck
les are white, wrapped around my mace/
comes from living in a terrorist state." Also, on
"Questioning My Sanity" — "I'm saving my
piss in a jar/ This depression has gone too far/
I'm laying here in my bed/ Am I alive or am I
dead?"
"Well," says Sparks about this change in
tone, "I had some tough times in the last year
and I think I'm starting to write a bit more in
troverted instead of extroverted." She hedges at
the suggestion of a concentrated thematic
switch though.
"As Suzi says, we're just channelers some
times. We just write what we write. I don't real
ly get an idea for a song, and it's like '1 want to
show our vulnerable side.' 1 just write what's
going on and on "Bricks..." a lot of political
things were upsetting me. Last year a lot of per
sonal things were upsetting me."
r X rom the look of things, this year has
been a year for touring. After a sum
w mer with Lollapalooza —"A rock 'n'
roll summer camp"for Sparks — L 7 has moved
into a nation-wide tour with the Melvins and
Wool providing support.
Never completely happy with their record
ings, L 7 is always thrilled to get on stage and ex
plode into the unpredictability and energy of a
live show. Sparks says that she's thriving from
the current tour, and raves about the cama
raderie among the three bands. "We're pretty
much fucking shit up every night. All three
bands are," she says.
Tireless, even after playing the big benefit
for Elvis in nearby Memphis, Sparks's biggest
complaint is about walking around Nashville
too much. "I made the mistake of wearing plat
forms to the Country Music Hall of Fame, and
I've been walking all day. but Suzi and I were a
sight. I mean we were walking down the street
nearly causing accidents."
Back to the hairdo.
"It's huge. It's aged me like ten years. We're
going to take pictures of it just for history's
sake."
Their hairdos may not last until they get to
Palo Alto this Saturday night, and history
might not indelibly record the impact of this
raucous hard-core unit, but ifyou do make it to
their show, one thing's for sure.
Your ears will be ringing for a hell of a long
time. ■

The lyrics on "Hungry For Stink" also differ
from L 7's previous releases. "Shitlist" from
"Bricks are Heavy" became the bands' political
rallying cry, adding various right-wing groups
to a growing list of offenders. "When 1 get mad
and I get pissed/1 grab my pen and I write out a
list." "Everglade" attacked a narrower group;
beefy, sexist, male moshers who think women
can't stage dive with the best of them. "So you
wanna have some fun?/ So break out the big
guns" sings Sparks on that album, and you can

almost hear her sneer.
"Hungry For Slink," though, contains less
bravado, revealing a more personal and vul
nerable side to l.7's characteristic verbal as
sault. "Can I Run" turns the tables on the
come-and-get-me feel of "Everglade" with
lines like "Switch to paranoid from having fun/
will he use his hands, knife, or a gun?/ Knuck
les are white, wrapped around my mace/
comes from living in a terrorist state." Also, on
"Questioning My Sanity" — "I'm saving my
piss in a jar/ This depression has gone too far/
I'm laying here in my bed/ Am I alive or am I
dead?"
"Well," says Sparks about this change in
tone, "I had some tough times in the last year
and I think I'm starting to write a bit more in
troverted instead of extroverted." She hedges at
the suggestion of a concentrated thematic
switch though.
"As Suzi says, we're just channelers some
times. We just write what we write. I don't real
ly get an idea for a song, and it's like '1 want to
show our vulnerable side.' 1 just write what's
going on and on "Bricks..." a lot of political
things were upsetting me. Last year a lot of per
sonal things were upsetting me."
r X rom the look of things, this year has
been a year for touring. After a sum
w mer with Lollapalooza —"A rock 'n'
roll summer camp"for Sparks — L 7 has moved
into a nation-wide tour with the Melvins and
Wool providing support.
Never completely happy with their record
ings, L 7 is always thrilled to get on stage and ex
plode into the unpredictability and energy of a
live show. Sparks says that she's thriving from
the current tour, and raves about the cama
raderie among the three bands. "We're pretty
much fucking shit up every night. All three
bands are," she says.
Tireless, even after playing the big benefit
for Elvis in nearby Memphis, Sparks's biggest
complaint is about walking around Nashville
too much. "I made the mistake of wearing plat
forms to the Country Music Hall of Fame, and
I've been walking all day. but Suzi and I were a
sight. I mean we were walking down the street
nearly causing accidents."
Back to the hairdo.
"It's huge. It's aged me like ten years. We're
going to take pictures of it just for history's
sake."
Their hairdos may not last until they get to
Palo Alto this Saturday night, and history
might not indelibly record the impact of this

/ Sparks, guitarist and vocalist for the
¥ w hard core foursome 1.7, "You would
not believe the hair-do I have. I mean, we're
talking Loretta Lynn,circa ISM?."
On the other end of the phone I'm trying to
imagine Sparks cruising around Nashville
topped with Grand ole Opry curls, but no pic
tures come to my head. Combat boots and
studded leather would be one thing, but metal
queen turned I lank Williams groupie I cannot

and I think people thought we were like the
Mickey Mouse people, you know? l ike when
you go to Disney Land and there's Mickey and
Goofy and stuff. People were thinking we were
the exhibit."
Uh-huh.
I've been on the phone with Sparks for less
than a minute, and I'm already wondering who
I'm talking to. Can this all-women L.A.-core
band really afford to gallivant around the coun
try music mecca without any shame? Aren't
they supposed to have huge attitudes? Aren't
they supposed to booze and party and, like,
kick the shit out of people or something?
"Oh, and we just lovedOpryland."
Opryland?
Time to reassess, I suppose. The mythic
tampon incident of 1992 (yes, withdrawn and
tossed into an unsuspecting mosh-pit) and
other stories had rooted these women of metal
punk somewhere left of endearing quirkiness.
In fact, intimidation had set in before I even di
aled Nashville. Stories of mile-high hairdos and
theme parks understandably caught me off
guard.
A penchant for country music seems
unexpected from these veterans of
the Southern California hard-core
scene. Struggling side-by-side for recognition
in L.A. clubs, Sparks and Gardner recruited
bassist Jennifer Finch and drummer Roy Kout
sky in 1986, and in 1988 saw the release of their
first LP. Produced by bad Religion frontman
Brett Gurewitz for the now famous indepen
dent label Epitaph Records (of Offspring
fame), their self-titled debut emerged from a
firmly punk foundation and set the stage for
their later success.
Dee Plakas soon replaced Koutsky, and, two
years later with the classic LP "Smell the
Magic," the four women began the first of three
albums of thrash and crunch guitars, fuck-you
lyrics, and grinding rhythms. Theirs became a
caustic, claustrophobic sound, but one that
couldn't help but reveal near-suffocated strains
of pop catchiness.
1992's major-label debut "Bricks are
Heavy," brought L 7 to radio and MTV recogni
tion when their first single, "Pretend We're
Dead" subsequently caught fire. The album,
despite sporting their characteristic ear-bleed
ing punch, featured lyrics and liner notes of a
much less serious tilt. Playfulness bounced
through songs like "Shitlist," 'Wargasm, and
"Everglade" inflating the band's image into an
overblown parody of itself. "Bricks..." with its

double-dare us mentality kept L 7's fans laugh
ing, but sapped the band of some of its credi
bility.
Sparks explains further, "This cartooney
image that people have of us as being these
fucking action figures or something — it real
ly wasn't an intentional thing..." In fact,
Sparks regrets much about "Bricks..."
" 'Bricks are Heavy' had a lot ofdifferent in
fluences in the songwriting, you know, and so
those songs should've sounded much different
from song to song, but they all kind of got ho
mogenized in the mastering process. The
mixes sounded great, but we weren't around
for the mastering session and everything got
really smoothed out. That was really unfortu
nate."
The image problem was especially off
putting for a band with such serious political
concerns. In 1991 L 7 joined forces with the ac
tivist group The Feminist Majority Founda
tion, to found an organization called Rock for
Choice. Benefit concerts featuring bands like
Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Hole and the Red Hot Chili
Peppers raised hundreds-of-thousands of dol
lars for awareness of women's rights and to
promote a woman's right to a safe and legal
abortion.

While L 7's newest CD"Hungry For
Stink," could not be called a political
album, it does reflect an eagerness to
be finally rid of their "action-figure image."
Gone is the tongue-in-cheek ambiance, the
larger-than-life caricatures of "Bricks are
Heavy." The newest release also feels fuller and,
if possible, heavier than anything they've ever
done. Songs like "Baggage" and "Fuel My Fire"
blow the top off of anything on "Bricks..."
"We wanted a grittier sound," says Sparks.
"We wanted to have songs sound different
from each other not only in the songwriting but
in the recording process. We wanted the more
luck-shit-up punk rock stuff like 'Andres' and
then we wanted a little bit different thing with
'Stuck Here Again' and 'Shirley.'"
The lyrics on "Hungry For Stink" also differ
from L 7's previous releases. "Shitlist" from
"Bricks are Heavy" became the bands' political

beefy, sexist, male moshers who think women
can't stage dive with the best of them. "So you
wanna have some fun?/ So break out the big
guns" sings Sparks on that album, and you can

almost hear her sneer.
"Hungry For Slink," though, contains less
bravado, revealing a more personal and vul
