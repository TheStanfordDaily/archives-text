Hobee's Restaurant You
might have to wait around for a bit
to get in the door, but once inside,
Hobee's treats you to a great eating
experience, complete with bot
tomless cups of coffee and Hobee's
house tea. The atmosphere and the
menu are heavily influenced by
Californian eating trends, as evi-

denced by the
omelettes with avocado
or the vegetable and
tofu dishes. You've
heard legends about
the coffeecake here,
and most of them are
true. Don't miss out. A
meal here will usually
cost about $6 to $8. Lo
cated in Town and
Country Village at the
corner of Embarcadero
and El Camino,
Hobee's is open Mon. 7
a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Tues.

Good Earth This restaurant of
fers an upscale version of a coffee
shop, with a more intimate and
quieter atmosphere than a diner.
The Good Earth emphasizes the
healthiness of their foods and se
lection of vegetarian dishes, and
true to promise, offers a wide vari

ety of fresh breads and soups that
are good for the taste buds as well
as the body. The entire eating expe
rience is quite affordable, as meals
usually range from $8- $15. How

through Sun. from 7:30 a.m. to 10
