# FROM THE FARM TO THE STAGE
## A.C.T. artistic director, mother, scholar, daughter — Carey Perloff 
### Story by Linda Friedlieb 
In the late '70s, Carey Perloff served and guz
zled her fair share of cappuccinos at the Cof
fee House. She spent a year living in Flo Mo.
She sat up in the dry lakebed of Lake Lag.
And once in a while, she would go with some
of her fellow undergraduates into The City to sit
in the "nosebleed section" of the Geary Theater
and watch the American Conservatory Theater
perform.
Now Perloff rarely gets nosebleeds. In fact,
she can have any seat in the house — once the
Geary reopens — and a sixth-floor office with a
view of the City.
Such are the perks of serving as artistic direc
tor.
The hands
Sitting in her office on a Friday afternoon,
PerlofFs hands never stop moving as she
talks about her latest directorial effort
"Home," the dilemmas facing A.C.T. and the
difficulties of being a working mom.
"1 really wanted to be an archaeologist. It's
what I thought I would do all through school,"
she says, running her hand through her hair and
playing with her bracelets. "I had participating
in a bunch of digs in the Southwest and I was
sure that's what I wanted to do.
"I'm very interested in how you take pieces of
a past culture and relate them to the present."
Laughing, she calls her foray into directing "a
fluke." But the constant motion of her hands
seems to suggest something more akin to fate.
An East Coast baby, Carey spent her early
years growing up in Washington D.C. and later
Philadelphia in an extremely academic environ
ment with an English professor for a mother
and a cardiologist for a father.
"When I came out to Stanford, that was my
big rebellion," Carey smiles, pointing out that
her parents and a sister were all ensconced in
East Coast academia. "I'd never been west of
Chicago before that. Actually, I'd barely been to
Chicago."

While she left the East Coast behind, Carey
still felt the expectations to follow in the

family footsteps.
"Actually, the assumption

was I was going to be an aca

demic," says the 1980

Phi Beta Kappa.
it % m r

My profes-

sors were

furi

ous I didn't apply to graduate school. But there I
was one day, sitting in the basement of Green Li
brary, and I looked around myself and saw all
these unpublished dissertations. And I just
couldn't do that."
It was at the Farm where Carey got her intro
duction to performance through her major in
Classics. "It was really unusual, but at the time I
was there, we had a Classics Department that
was really interested in performance."
English or Greek?
By the time Carey left the Farm, she had a
grounding in Greek drama that still serves
her today. But it was while she was a Full
bright Fellow at Oxford University that Carey
made her first motions towards directing.
"I'm not sure you could teach anyone direct
ing. I went to Oxford to see if I could direct, part
ly because I didn't want to go to graduate
school," she smiles, beginning to pick at a piece
of artichoke and spinach pizza a friend brings
her for lunch. "Directing was a confluence of a
lot of things I loved — literary criticism, art his
tory, drama."
Her time at Oxford represented a time of ex
perimentation. Carey made her only forays into
film as part of the Oxford Film Society.
"I'm just too impatient for film. I love seeing
things happen live. You can change a direction
and then watch it happen right in front of you. I

need that kind or immediacy.
Another experiment turned out to be for
more successful. Carey met her husband while
directing him in a play for the Edinburgh Festi
val.
Carey's time in the United Kingdom seems to
have left a dramatic mark on her selection of
plays. Current she directs British playwright
David Storey's 1970 play "Home" about the de-

cline of British culture, but

. when questioned she de-

k clares her favorite play-

wright to be another

British existentialist

Harold Pinter.

"The rea-

son I think

Pinter's

work is so

fantastic is that it's not just replicated reality....
It's perfectly observed reality that is distilled al
most to poetry," she smiles. "I don't think there's
a funnier playwright than Pinter."
Her choice of playwrights seems incompati
ble with her cheery nature. The "humor" in
both Pinter and Storey is presented within the
stark contrast to the tragic topics both tackle.
"People ask me that all the time: How come
you direct such depressing plays when you're al
ways so happy?" she remarks. "It's partly I'm
married to a Brit. So I guess that's part of the at
traction.
"But really, great writing is great writing. I do
tend to love miniatures — not miniature in
scope because Greek tragedy is epic. I just have
incredible respect for anyone who can encom
pass the world in 90 minutes with no intermis
sion."
Coming Home'
Carey's latest directorial effort falls almost
in the scope. While "Home" has an inter
mission, it's definitely a miniature, fo
cused on five characters. And it's definitely
, British.

On the opening night of "Home," Carey

spent the moments just before curtain

standing in a corner of the Stage Door

Theater, wringing her hands together

.and helping direct the occasional lost

person to the proper seat.

V In those three or four min-

utes, Carey checked her watch

times, ran backstage

D
twice and finally headed

on stage to dedicate the

per

formance to long-time AC.T. performer Syd
ney Walker who died in September of cancer.
After the dedication, she ran down to her seat,
made a director's snap judgment and chose a
different one so she wouldn't have to climb over
as many people.
"You're always nervous. It never goes away.
Every rehearsal feels like the first," she admits in
Friday's interview. "When you literally just have
the empty stage and the actor, then you really see
what you can do."
"Home" is an interesting production for
Carey, partly because she has only served as
artistic director for three years. In contrast, the
four main players have seven decades of experi
ence combined on A.C.T. stages.
"Home was my chance to work with a lot of
talent," Carey says. "It's rare that you get actors
that good and actors that trust each other that
much. And it's partly that actors that age know
how to get value out of the moment because
they're experienced and they're extremely grate
ful to be working You could tell they just
looked forward to rehearsal.
Once again, Carey has chosen a play where
the humor is a means of escaping the darker the
matic background — a loss of "Home." Despite
these morose overtones, Carey's face lights up as
she talks about her subject, her directorial hands
moving faster than ever.
"I think it's really a heartbreaking play. If it
isn't funny along the way, it would just be too
tragic to watch 1 think it's hilarious."
A glance at a page of director's notes shows
that Carey's hands move as fast when carrying a
pen as when she's talking — writing covers al
most every inch of white space.

"Every detail matters. I gave them incredible
volumes of notes," she admits, sheepishly. "It
gives you a lot to play with. It's an actor's dream
play. There are no stage cues. And there's a series
of fragments which you can do a lot with."
A woman of many roles
Doing a lot" seems to be a good motto
for Carey's life as well as Storey's play.
A playpen dominates one corner of
her office, demonstrating that work coin
cides with mothering 5-year-old Lexie and 5-
month-old Nicholas.
Actually, Nicholas is lucky that his mom now
has space for him in her office. While Carey was
directing off-Broadway for Classic Stage Com
pany, Lexie didn't have such a luxurious life.
"Lexie grew up in the theater. She was the
box-office baby. All her babysitters were actors.
In New York, we lived just a few blocks from the
theater, so I used to take her with all the time,"
Carey says. "She would be in the box office and
people would come up to buy their tickets and
lean over to look in and there she was."
Carey credits her own matter-of-fact attitude
toward working momhood to her own mother,
Stanford English Prof. Marjorie Perloff. Not
only was the professor a great role model, but
she also provides an expert babysitting service
when she's in the Bay Area.
"Actually when I came to Stanford it was my
rebellion. Then my mother got an offer from
[the University of Southern California]. I tease
her that she only took the interview because it
was a free trip out west to see me," Carey says,
adding that her mother now commutes from
the Los Angeles area because her father's cardi
ology lab is there.
"It's exhausting," she says with a sigh. "Actu
ally, that's why there's so few women in the the
ater. Actually, there's very few parents of either
sex ... You just try and get through the day. I
look at young women entering the field and I'm
sad. We should have done better by now.
"The directing is the dessert People come up
to me and say, 'How do you find the time to di

rect?' For me, that's what makes it all worth
while."
Carey says one of her ambitions is to see on
site daycare established at the company's head
quarters. She contends it will increase produc
tivity and help retain talented parents.
In addition to directing and mothering,
Carey adds a third set of duties to her roster —
those of teacher. Between 1987 and 1992, she
taught dramatic writing at New York Universi
ty's Tisch School of the Arts and now she teach
es in the company's MFA program.
"A lot of my playwriting students from New
York are now out there in the field, trying to
make a living. It makes me nervous," she smiles
with pride. "I tried my hand at writing, but I de
cided if I wasn't as good as Pinter I should stop.
So I stopped."
Picking her words
Many of her most interesting roles fall
under the job tide. Judge, director,
mother hen — in some ways, artistic
director is synonymous with jack of all trades.
"In a large part, it's a producing job — se
lecting the work we do and the artists who do
it, planning the budget. And, of course, a big
part of life in the arts is fund raising. Another
important aspect is creating a home for the
company. The way you manage your company
ultimately determines what shows up on the
stage."
While she's given up writing, Carey now
serves as one of the ultimate judges of plays —
the person who chooses what will be performed
and what will never see the light of a Bay Area
stage.
Choosing the next year's calendar of plays is
one of the most challenging and enjoyable parts
of Carey's job.
"You start with a couple of core values. For
me, first and foremost it's the actors," she says.
"Home" grew out of the availability of Bill Pat
terson, Ruth Kobart, Joy Carlin and Ra\ e 3i;k
— four long-time A.C.T. talents who had
worked together many times previously.
Similarly, "Hecuba," which Carey will di
rect this spring, "evolved out of a long, long
relationship with Olympia (Dukakis). It was
a play she had always wanted to do," Carey
says."It also grew out of my own background
with Greek tragedy.... It's really a labor of
love."
The process of designing a roster of plays is a
long one, beginning with close readings of
about 50 tides and slowly narrowing down to
balance out a season with something for everv
one.
For example, once A.C.T. gained the rights to
"Angels in America," Carey says the decision to
stage that overwhelming epic affected all other
productions for the year. "You can't out-angels
'Angels.' So instead you look for contrast."
Missing the Geary
Choosing plays isn't Carey's only chal
lenge. Since the 1989 Loma Prieta earth
quake, the company has been financially
strapped and homeless thanks to the havoc the
quake wreaked on the Geary Theater. After
raising millions of dollars, construction is final
ly underway and the A.C.T. should return
home by the middle of the next season.
Carey's face lights up at the thought. "Really
it's hard to stage shows in the substandard awful
theaters we've been using," she says. Most of the
company's productions have been housed in
Stage Door and the Marines Memorial The
aters in San Francisco.
"I'm really hoping to do something with

music next season. [The Geary is] such an in
credible theater acoustically," she says.
Truly, the majestic Geary is a match for what
Carey describes as the A.C.T.'s guiding princi
pal — "real theatricality, plays which celebrate
the live actors on stage."
Certainly, Tony Kushner's "Angels in Amer
ica" is the epitome of that keynote. "It reaches
very big," Carey says."It takes on big issues, big
themes, big characters without apology. It's not
watered-down sitcom writing.
"One of the really heartening things about
'Angels' is it breaks all the rules. For a number of
years, people were saying, 'all you can produce
is two-character, one-act plays.' And that was
kind of sad. Brecht would have never come to
be if all he could write was two-character, one
act plays."
Carey sees a measure of hope for the future
in "Angels" 's ability to break so many rules.
But simultaneously, the production has been
one of the most difficult for her as artistic di
rector.
Under her leadership, A.C.T. made the un
orthodox decision to cast nationally rather
than locally, generating some criticism. And
then the company faced the incredible chal
lenge of fitting an enormous production into
the minute Marines Memorial.
"There's no breathing room in that theater.
And this is a play of a certain magnitude.
There's no storage space. You should just try
walking around backstage. It's nuts. There's
beds hanging from walls, props everywhere. It's

bedlam every night. The crew really deserves an
award."
Encore on the Farm
A few years ago, Carey returned to her alma
mater to give the Phi Beta Kappa address.
"The students were so incredible. They had
about five students stand up and give speeches.
They were in totally different fields and had re
ally different experiences," she says, continuing
to pick at her pizza. "It was really heartwarming
to hear about their depth of experience. It was
reassuring."
The trip brought back memories of her own
time here. "I adored Stanford when I was
there," she smiles. "I thought it was amazing
you could be at a university as large as Stanford
and professors would actually take the time to
talk with you."
But the lack of emphasis on the arts is a flaw
she takes to heart, pointing to the proposed
elimination of the Drama Department a few
years ago and allowing a rare frown to cross her
face.
"It's never been a school that took the hu
manities very seriously. I always felt a little mar
ginalized. ... Now I think it's even worse."
But Carey doesn't have much time to dwell
on the negative. Glancing wistfully at the plas
tic-covered salad she didn't get around to, she
prepares to head over to the Stage Door where
she's to host a student discussion on "Home."
Once again, she's in motion. ■
