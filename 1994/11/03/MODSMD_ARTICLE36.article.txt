# Frenetic 'Radioland' crazy but not really all that funny

### 
When George Lucas produced a film in
1986 by veteran writers Willard Huyck and
Gloria Katz, the result was the much-antici
pated hut embarrassing flop, "Howard the
Duck." Now, almost a decade later, and with
the addition of two more writers, the same
team returns with another disappointing
comedy. Only this time the subject is the be
hind-the-scenes chaos of a 1930'5-style radio
network.
"Radioland Murders" was originally in

ing quality ot the film, for even it the jokes
lack any depth at least some are well execut
ed.
The story begins in 1939 on the night the
radio station WBN is going national. Penny
Henderson (Mary Stuart Masterson), the
station owner's ever-efficient secretary, has
her hands full making sure that the station
runs smoothly as it goes on the air. In the
process she must cope with a disgruntled
sponsor, make decisions tor an inept direc
tor, deal with temperamental stars, quiet the
mutinous writers, make sure the scripts are
finished before the deadline, and fend oft a
husband who claims he was framed when she
caught him in a sexy singer's dressing room.
To make matters worse, the station's em
ployees are being slowly murdered, and
Penny's hapless husband, Roger, is being
framed for the deaths.
Meanwhile, the show must go on.
Director Mel Smith is clearly trying to re
create the machine-gun pacing of classic
screwball comedy with "Radioland Murders,"
but all he manages to create is a mixture of
cute gags and boring tricks. The bumbling
page can only smack into the walls so many
times before it gets old, and the exasperated
Penny can only save the situation so often be
fore we come to expect it at every turn. Even
Roger misses the mark with his dare-devil an
tics on the looming WBN sign, if only because
the sign looks like a cheap model.
The predictable plot in "Radioland Mur
ders" deflates what little suspense the mur
ders can muster. Anyone paying attention
will guess the killer's identity long before it's
revealed, by which time the film seems no
longer worth watching.

Radioland Murders

tended by Lucas as a follow-up to his break
through film, "American Graffiti (1974),
but instead he set the project aside for a sci
ence-fiction story called "Star Wars." 112 itting
ly, "Radioland Murders" now emerges from
the drawer only as Lucas is gearing up for
work on the prequel to the "Star Wars" trilo
gy-
In the hands of director Mel Smith ("The
Tall C iuy"), "Radioland Murders" races along
in a frenzy of slapstick falls, impossible
predicaments, silly mix-ups and worn-out
gags, all of which seem lifted from a bad B
movie.
Even worse is the film's failure to pay
homage to its period. In an obvious effort to
reproduce the radio show atmosphere and
the fast, snappy dialogue of the times, the
writers equate "funny" with hectic and
ridiculous, as if they believe the audience has
an attention span of a hyperactive two-year
old. Smith's direction is perhaps the only sav-

= if you've got the money to spare
= certainly worth your while
= a can't-miss
