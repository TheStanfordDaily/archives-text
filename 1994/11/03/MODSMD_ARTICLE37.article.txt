## 'Clerks' unleashes audacious, witty satire 
### 
In the no-budget, guerrilla-independent
tradition of "She's Gotta Have It"and the
more recent "El Mariachi," Kevin Smith's
"Clerks" hands out another slap in the face
to studio executives who prefer the conve
nience of judging talent by its price tag.
Made for less money than the catering

Clerks

bill for most major Hollywood produc
tions — $27,575 to be exact — this black
and-white-shot venture looks cheap, talks
fast and plays tough. Vile, remorseless and
engaging all at once, "Clerks" is quite sim
ply the most audacious American comedy
to hit the screens thus far this year.
Set in Leonardo, New Jersey, the film
details the trials and tribulations of Dante
Hicks (Brian O'Halloran), a 22-year-old
nice-guy who has the innocuous-sound
ing job title of a store clerk at Quick Stop
Groceries.
Before this particular day at work is over
though, Dante would have faced the oral
truth about his girlfriend's sexual proclivi
ties, been accused of helping a 5-year-old
have her first puff of nicotine and found a
customer sprawled across the toilet seat in
pornography-induced rigor mortis.
In his orchestration of humor as black
as Quick Stop's lousy coffee, first-time
writer-director Smith displays the same
wide-eyed enthusiasm as the proverbial
child in the candy store. Although there is
no gag deemed too profane to be exploited
here — consider the climactic encounter
enjoyed by Dante's visiting ex-girlfriend
Smith elects the use of verbal delivery
for his script's most outrageous moments;
the more graphic alternative seems almost
too easy a way out.
Himself an off-and-on employee at

the real-life Quick Stop for four years
before making "Clerks," Smith unleash
es a venomous blast of pent-up frustra
tion at the more absurd demands of sub
urban consumption, mostly by way of
the wise-cracking remarks of Randal
(Jeff Anderson), Dante's manipulative
friend and fellow clerk at the video store
next door.
The pair's ongoing love-hate symbio
sis must qualify as one of cinema's most
endearing examples of brotherhood in
arms, at times tender to the point of the
homoerotic. A self-appointed "clerk
rights" activist, Randal argues the case
for the over-qualified menial worker who
deserves little of the condescension
spilling from the other side of the
counter.
Likewise, perhaps what is left for Kevin
Smith to do is make a trip back to Quick
Stop — it only to place the trophies gar
nered by "Clerks" at Sundance and Cannes
by the trusty old cash-register. Nothing is
more qualified to exact revenge on con
sumerism than celebrity.
