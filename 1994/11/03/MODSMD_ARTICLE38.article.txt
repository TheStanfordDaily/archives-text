# 'Stargate' can only deliver the same ol' sci-fi

"Stargate" may have broken the October box office
record last weekend, but the movie did not break any
barriers in science fiction advancement. Most of the
concepts, characterizations and plot twists were bor
rowed from other action and sci-fi films.
"Stargate" stars James Spader and Kurt Russell as
two men who travel through an ancient transporter
into a world millions of light years away from Earth to
search for alternate civilizations. However, their little
journey opens up more than just communication lines.
By allowing another world direct access to Earth, the
Stargate ends up endangering the entire planet.
Spader ("Wolf") is likable as the brilliant but absent
minded F.gyptologist Daniel Jackson who unlocks the
secrets of the Stargate in two weeks after the US Military
struggled with it for years. Russell ("Tombstone") plays
hardened army man Colonel lack O'Neil who accepts a

Stargate

suicide assignment to
avoid returning to his
own empty life.
Though the two
men start out with
separate missions, in-

evitably they must come together in an effort to defeat
Ra, the ruler controlling the community of people liv
ing on the other side of the Stargate who has ambitions
to destroy Earth next. Ra is played by I aye Davidson in
his first role following his notorious debut in"The Cry
ing Game."
The movie's special effects are actually not that im
pressive, consisting mostly of advanced weaponry and
odd-looking space creatures.
At times, the story line seems to wander into the realm
of the ridiculous. One dubious subplot involves a ro

mance between Spader's character and a woman he meets
in the other world. He conveniently figures out her lan
guage within a few hours and after about a day they are
both willing to give up their lives for the other.
The film, directed by Roland Emmerich, is an enter
taining two hours, but it recalls too many elements of

such classics as the "Indiana
Jones" trilogy without the

originality and style. In
the end, "Stargate" blends
in with every other hero-

girl-villain flick that

make up that stew
of unmemorable

science fiction.
