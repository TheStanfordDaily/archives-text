## Moment of 'Divine' inspiration can't salvage Slayer from mire 
### 
Slayer seems like the kind of group you
wouldn't want to piss off.
But what else would you expect from a
hand whose newest album contains a full
color picture of two arms covered in blood
after "Slaver" has been cut into them with a

"Divine Intervention"
Slayer

razor?
"Divine Intervention" is easy to write off
as just another anger-packed, speed-metal
album. It takes several times through the
tracks to begin picking words out of the
continuous drumming, rapid-fire guitar
and lead singer Tom Araya's screamed
words.
But hidden beneath the music's death
metal format are a few clever lyrics that

spins

breathe a little bit of
life into an album
that could otherwise
be grouped along
with hundreds of
other Metallica look
alikes.
For example, at
first glance "Ditto
head" sounds like a
person trying to
scream the Declara
tion of Independence

from memory while sliding down a fast
moving waters! ide.
The song is actually a commentary on
topics ranging ostensibly from the public's
perception of radio personalities like Rush
Limbaugh (hence the title) to the O.J. Simp
son trial in Los Angeles.
Hidden within the track are lyrics like
"Anyone can be set free / On a technicality /
Explain the law to me." It's not quite Shake
speare, but clearly Slayer wants to use the
words to make a point.
With the exception of the brief silences
between tracks, guitarists Jeff Hanneman
and Kerry King only back away from their
non-stop style during the title track.
This sudden switch from loud to soft is
probably what makes "Divine Intervention"
the best song on the album. At one point
during the track, drummer Paul Bostaph
even steps away from the bass drums in favor
of a light touch on the crash cymbal.
Hanneman and King don't exactly go un
plugged during the song, but they tone down
the distortion — making the softer part of
the track contrast sharply with the rest of the
album.
But in the end, one notable song and bet
ter than average lyrics don't rescue the ma
jority of the album which becomes inextri
cably mired in the unidentifiable "metal
soup" which is the trademark of a vanilla
white speed metal band — if there is such «i
thing.
Slayer may need a little divine interven
tion of its own after this album.
