# Former LA councilman attacks state politics

### Hussein Kanji 
Commenting on the flaws of
the American political system and
suggesting possible remedies, for
mer Los Angeles City Councilman
Michael Woo spoke last night as
part of Okada's Asians in Politics
series.
Woo, who was unsuccessful in
last year's Los Angeles mayoral
race, touched upon a variety of

subjects, including Clinton's vi
sion of a domestic peace corps,
Asian under-representation in
politics and his own mayoral loss.
Citing a "concern over the sick
political system," Woo discussed
major problems with California
politics, namely the necessity for
campaign money, the under-rep
resentation of certain ethnicities
and the news media's trivializa
tion of issues.
Due to earlier political reforms
that sought to eliminate party pol
itics, the only effective way to
reach voters in California is to use
the mass media, Woo said.
According to Woo, this causes
the price of campaigns to soar and
makes politicians lose personal
contact. One of his solutions to
this problem is to get the Federal
Communications Commission to
allocate free air time for candi
dates running for office.
Claiming that the difference
between America and other coun
tries is that "when there is a prob
lem, America forms an organiza
tion and does something about it,"
Woo stressed the new service pro
ject initiated by President Clinton.
As the Western States Director


Michael Woo
of the Corporation for National
Service, Woo's goals for the pro
gram are to "get across the idea
that everyone has an obligation
to their country."
By donating a year of their
time for full or part-time service
like tutoring, giving shots and
organizing similar projects, stu
dents could qualify for education
awards up to $5,000.
Within a year's time, Woo said
he hopes to have recruited 50,000
students, reaching 100,000 stu
dents after three years.
Addressing a largely Asian-
American audience, Woo focused
on the reasons for lack of Asian-
American participation in poli
tics.
Realizing that the political sys
tem is "not an easy system to
break into," Woo claimed that
Asian Americans are "too insu
lar" and tied "into [their 1 own
community."
Woo said Asian Americans
need to organize and "ask for
things," as they — along with
other minority groups — are
under-represented in the polls.
Woo argued that Democratic
political groups are "afraid of
putting in money [to the Asian-
American communityl because of
the perception that Asians are

more Republican."
His solution, besides "far
sighted and skillful leadership" in
the Asian-American community,
is to build multi-ethnic coalitions.
These do not necessarily have
to be long-term coalitions, said
Woo, citing the recent alliance of
Latinos and Asian-Americans in
the debate over Proposition 187.
Woo also discussed his 1993
loss in the mayoral election,
which he said was mainly due to
money, his incumbency from the
city council and what he perceives
as a vagueness in his campaign.
Although "there was a lot of
residual racial tension in the
city," Woo said he didn't believe
that race was a major factor in
the election. He added, howerver,
that it wasn't completely out of
the picture.
"The passage of time has not
significantly improved racial ten
sions in that city," Woo said.
Woo also conceded that politics
is not the most desirable career,
since "most people don't look
down on lifetime dentists . . . but
it is negative to call someone a
professional politician."
There have, however, been
times where he said he felt the job
was rewarding, like when he built
the first AIDS hospice in Los
Angeles and later implemented a
solution to a dispute over liquor
sales between Korean store-own
ers and the black community in
South Central Los Angeles.
