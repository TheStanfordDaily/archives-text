Commenting on the flaws of
the American political system and
suggesting possible remedies, for
mer Los Angeles City Councilman
Michael Woo spoke last night as
part of Okada's Asians in Politics
series.
Woo, who was unsuccessful in
last year's Los Angeles mayoral
race, touched upon a variety of

subjects, including Clinton's vi
sion of a domestic peace corps,
Asian under-representation in
politics and his own mayoral loss.
Citing a "concern over the sick
political system," Woo discussed
major problems with California
politics, namely the necessity for
campaign money, the under-rep
resentation of certain ethnicities
and the news media's trivializa
tion of issues.
Due to earlier political reforms
that sought to eliminate party pol
itics, the only effective way to
reach voters in California is to use
the mass media, Woo said.
According to Woo, this causes
the price of campaigns to soar and
makes politicians lose personal
contact. One of his solutions to
this problem is to get the Federal
Communications Commission to
allocate free air time for candi
dates running for office.
Claiming that the difference
between America and other coun
tries is that "when there is a prob
lem, America forms an organiza
tion and does something about it,"
Woo stressed the new service pro
ject initiated by President Clinton.
