## Dark, chilling intensity breathes life into Come's sound 
### 
In a manner of speaking, Come is an
old dog who's got plenty of new tricks, a
straight-ahead rock 'n' roll band that
sounds so fresh and powerful that it puts
many outfits that pass for "alternative"

"Don't Ask, Don't Tell"
Come

and "innovative" these days to shame.
On its latest album, "Don't Ask, Don't
Tell," the Boston-based quartet trans
forms the time-tested rock formula, in
fusing it with palpable emotion and
smoldering energy.
Yet what makes Come so affecting can't
be explained by just the feeling or the en
ergy; rather, it's that something intangible
which emanates from the vigorous emo
tion and packs itself in the band'sdark and
chilling music. Call that something the
blues or chalk it up to sincerity or whatev
er — one hears it in the twang and shim
mer of Thalia Zedek and Chris Brokaw's
dueling guitars, in the insistent rhythms
pounded out by bassist Sean O'Brien and
drummer Arthur Johnson, and in Zedek's
gravely voice and moody lyrics. Maybe
cartharsis, overused as it is, is the word.
The album's opening track, the beguil
ing "Finish Line," defines this inexplicable
quality. It's a dense, enervating tune where
Zedek growls over the seething guitars,
waiting to explode in furious blasts at an
instant's notice. And explode they do,
crescendoing and crashing to punctuate
Zedek's aching voice as the crisp, steady
rhythms keep the beat. In the best sense,

the song goes nowhere fast and back again,
the beginning a finish line where Zedek
finds she stayed, "All this time in one
place."
It's impressive that the band can keep
up such a high level of intensity through
the six-and-a-half minute song, much
less through the entirety of the ten track
album. The second cut, "Mercury Falls,"
starts off sluggishly, but patiently picks
up pace, the guitars climbing riff by riff
to a sustained explosion only to change
gears again and ease its way down. "Yr
Reign" strums and swaggers like some
thing off the Afghan Whigs' "Congrega
tion" as Zedek screams and spits out her
story while nothing on the album gives
quite a startle as Zedek's screech which
starts off "Poison." These two cuts, along
with "In/Out," prove three raucous
numbers with a little more bite and
bounce.
Still, Comes penchant for changing
things up completes the picture, where the
slower moments are as expressive as the
loud, fast ones. "Let's Get Lost" sways with
a swampy sound, the guitars simmering
and whining to the deliberate bass line at
the surface; it's the kind of song which
probably earned Come the inaccurate tag
of being a blues band. The mellow "Ger
man Song" hints of brokaw's old band,
Codeine, in its dispirited energy. Come
crawls to the close of the album on the
gentle capper, "Arrive," in which the sub
tlety of the instrumentation and the ex
haustion in Zedek's voice overpower with
a disturbed serenity. It's the calm after the
storm, the moment where Come catches
its breath because baring one's soul is hard
work.
