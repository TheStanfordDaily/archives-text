# American Music Club offers melancholy brilliance, S.F.

Listening to American Music Club on a
sunny Stanford afternoon is a little like read
ing Sylvia Plath to an audience between takes
of "Barney." Unwelcome, perhaps, jarringly

"San Francisco"
American Music Club

melancholic, perhaps, but lingering and un
forgettable.
"San Francisco," the newest release from
these masters of invigorating gloom, suggests
a much more appropriate setting. Banks of tog
and a dampness that seeps through the skin
like depression figure prominently among
these 16 tracks of love lost and cynicism
gained. Despite all of this, though, Mark Fit/el
and his four bandmates manage to produce a
satisfaction in hopelessness, an ebullience in
wretchedness.

The album leads off with "Fearless," and its
warm circles of regret and yearning. "Your
tears are the only thing that makes me sure I've
got to love you even more," sings the habitual
ly subdued Eitzel. His breathy whisperings
sound like they're fighting a path out of his
beer while the melody seems to wind its way to
you from a line of near-empty barstools.
The faster songs mix foot-tapping rhythms
with acid strains of bitterness. "Wish the
World Away" rollicks along on messages of
willful seclusion and isolation. "I don't need
anyone's love / I couldn't afford it anyway /
With my penny's worth of hope / It's not
funny but it's a joke."
Even the seemingly upbeat "Hello Amster
dam" contains quiet images of despair. "Tail
between my legs I crawl back to the canal / all
alone my eyes rolling like the moon."
Eitzel's gloominess hinges on irony, and so
a line like "I should trade my heart in for a
watch 'cause all I do is watch the numbers slip
away" laughingly banishes weightiness. "How
Many Six Packs Does it lake Io Screw in a

Light" nails breezy sar
casm down simply with
its title.
Eitzel's wrenching po
etry drives this music as
much as guitarist Vudi's
moody licks and occa
sional bursts of disso
nance. Lines like "Clear
away the Mission St.in
my head / that keeps this
watery weariness in our
bed" sit along side stum
bling backbeats and
warped guitars. An up
lifting mix all the way
through, it's like watch
ing San Francisco gloom
reveal glimpses of exquis
ite unhappiness. And it's
just the antidote for Stan
ford's blazing sun and
blue sky.
