Fretblanket

When I think of modern Lnglish music, 1
think of pale guys with those little-Caesar
haircuts singing in whiny, wispy voices over
fuzzy, humming guitars. (iuys in vests. (iuys
who sing ambiguous llirty songs dripping
with irony. Guys who are either named Mor
rissey or in a band whose name has one syl
lable and a "u" as its primary vowel — Pulp,
Suede, Lush, Curve, and Blur to name a lew.
In fact, blur is a great name for one of these
bands because they all sort of blur together.
Apparently some people in England are
as bored with this .is I am. Fretblanket's
members sound like they were sitting
around one afternoon and someone said,
"oi, Give, (yep, one of 'em's named Clive)
let's quit this pansy crap and rock like those
American blokes."
At the very least, this band succeeds in
breaking through the cliches of English
music. Guitar-driven and energetic, Fret
blanket "rocks" a lot harder than most
other contemporary English bands. There's
nary a keyboard in sight. The vocals sound
straightforward and sincere, with little of
the coy sneering and sarcasm that marks
acts like Morrissey.
Unfortunately, Fretblanket tries to hide
its English background by sounding very
consciously American, and these influences
show through. Lead vocalist Will Copley
sings in the gravelly yell that seems to be the
hallmark of today's American alterna-pop,
and while he's good at it he still doesn't re
ally distinguish himself from the similar
sound of bands like Soul Asylum or Stone
Temple Pilots. When you add "rock-y" gui
tar solos, teen-angst lyrics and their

"grunge look, Fretblanket talis squarely
among the ranks of American bands like
Candlebox and Collective Soul. They do a
good job of playing alterna-pop, but it's still
alterna-pop. By scrambling to avoid T.ng
lish cliches, Fretblanket ends up emulating
American ones.
Althou&h it's tailor-made tor Live 105

radio play, "Junkfuel" is by and large a com
petent album. Strangely, the tracks that re
flect the most English influence, like the
slightly Cure-sounding "Transmission,'
may be the strongest on the album.
Several other songs stand out: " Twisted'
is a powerful, tight rocker and "Drag'
courageously showcases a horn section

which works better in a modern "alterna
tive" song than you might expect. Fretblan
ket is a young band (they're all still in their
teens) and they've already created a sound
that stands out from current English bands.
Their next step should be standing out from
American ones.
