"Guerrilla Funk"
Paris

Paris, the self-proclaimed Black Panther of
Hip Hop, has released his third album "Guer
rilla Funk" on (his own) Scarface Records.
While lyrically impressive, the music has little
staying power.
In comparison to his previous release
"Sleeping with the Enemy," "Guerrilla Funk"
tries to depart from a straight hip-hop tradi
tion. This is not a hassline-repeater album.
Rather, "Guerrilla Funk" samples R&B, funk
— from Me' Shell N'Dege-Ocello to the Gap
Band to Parliament — and even an occasional
taste of classical strings.
While not necessarily that creative (who
doesn't sample P-funk?), the sampling on
"Guerrilla Funk" rounds out Paris' militant
message. Paris selectively mixes sounds to frame
his tirade against the white power structure.
In the title track, the Bay Area rapper spews:
"We're still in the war zone / Black folks still
brain-dead to the truth / But I still got love so
I'm coming through / With a trunk lull of lunk
that'll make you separate the real from the fake
each and everyday"
Paris' message is not so upbeat, hut rolls in
a crafted, militant groove. Same angry stuff as
before (as in "Bush Killa" and "Coffee, Donuts
and Death"), hut a different style.

Paris explains his choice as a matter of con
sideration lor his audience. "As long as condi
tions prevail the way they do, then I'm going
to keep saying what I've got to say. But that
doesn't mean that the way I go about it is
going to be the same every time.. .The music
is funk so that the message will be accepted."
Paris composes his music for his own audi
ence — not for general consumption by the
masses (or exploitation by the media). I le cre
ates to empower: open the CD liner notes and
you will find a three-part diatribe on white su
premacy.
"Mentacide," Paris writes, "is the deliber
ate and systematic destruction of

a group's mind with the ulti
mate purpose being the

destruction of that
group."

Listen to the
album, hear Paris
exhort: "I'm
looking for a

way to make us
rise." Paris, like
a Lost Poet of
the Nineties,
preaches self-

preservation and
revolution for
Black America.

Jason s Lyric"
soundtrack

F rom the reassuring overtones of "U Will
Know" to the prophetic lyrics of "Many Rivers
to Cross," the soundtrack to "Jason's Lyric"
skillfully recounts the tale of a black male's
coming of age.
The album offers a clever compilation of
black male artists in keeping with the film's
themes of empowerment and challenges fac
ing young African-American men.

The soundtracks first re
lease, "U Will Know," com-

piles an alluring array of
black male artists to

convey a message of
unity. The song
boasts the soulful

sounds of Tevin
Campbell, Al B.
Sure, and Bov/ II
Men among oth
ers, singing solos

and in unison to
send a strong and
uplifting message.
In contrast to the

represented R&B
artists, the soundtrack
includes a smoothed-out

gangsta track by the Whitehead Brothers of
"Your Love is a 187"-fame, as well as comple
ments from the G-Funk Era with acts such as
the Five Footer Crew and The Twinz.
This collaborative effort between the film's
director Doug Mcffenry and Mercury Records
President Hd Ekstine tries to incorporate a blues
feel into the soundtrack in songs like "This City
Needs I kip" and "Just Like My Papa," which
seem out of place among the easy flowing
gangsta and hip-hop cuts on the album.
However, the powerful messages in these
blues-influenced songs cannot be ignored
The Tonies three (Tony! Toni! Tone!) set the
tone for positive father figures in the black
community as they reflectively note, "God
knows the way he is/ Is the way I am / But it's
okay /1 guess 1 can't deny that lam / lust like
my Papa / And I'll do anything / If 1 could be
the man he was."
Providing even greater variety on the
soundtrack, Mcl lenrv and Ekstine also chose
to include a few remakes such as Bobby Wom
ack's "If You Think You're Lonely Now" and a
compelling rendition of "Many Rivers to
Cross" masterfully done by Oleta Adams.
The album contains many other impressive
tracks from LL. Cool J., Ahmad and PRS, but
reaches its peak at the heartfelt lovers' cut,
"Love is Still Enough" by Atlas Recording artist
Sovory.
On the whole, the "Jason's Lyric" sound
track definitely provides a variety of lyrical fla
vors for your ears as well as food for thought.
