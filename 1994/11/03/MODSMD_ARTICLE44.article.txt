"Hydrophonic"
Soup Dragons

Although three members of the Soup
Dragons have abandoned ship, Sean Dick
son, the group's founder and lead singer, has
managed to take over and churn out an am
bitious and creative new album. "Hydro
phonic," the band's new release, still main
tains the euphoric party feel of the past two
Soup Dragons' albums, "Hotwired" and
"Lovegod," while plunging headfirst into
musical experimentation.
As a transitional album, "Hydrophonic"
allowed Dickson a lot of headroom to do
what the music-box of his mind wanted.
While die-hard fans may find that this album
tastes a little different from the past two Soup
Dragons' stews, their latest effort can defi
nitely grow on you.
Along with the classic, care-free, dance
rock, let's-get-stlipid choral feel that songs
like "One Way Street" brim with, "Hydro
phonic" also conjures images of heading

Single Gun Theory

Two of Single (iun Theory's three mem
bers play the sampling keyboard and noth
ing else — this gives you an idea of how deft
ly the band can mix in samples of other
recordings. Yet Single Gun Theory is even
more adept at writing their own songs, as the
bands ultimate skill lies in blending their
own music with a cornucopia of samples.
Their new release, "(low, the river of my
soul," has all the ingredients of a captivating
and alluring album: groovy beats, a soothing
female voice with a hint of seductiveness as
well as fresh samples from old movies, "Twin
Peaks," Pope John the 23rd and Turkish
street musicians. Together, thev all amount

"Acid Jazz Test Part II"
compilation

Even it you don't like jazz, take the Acid
Jazz Test. "Acid Jazz Test Part II" combines
the improvisational sounds of jazz with
modern electronics. This second in a two
part collection features eleven different acid
jazz players representing a wide variety of

down the highway toward Arizona in "Auto
matic Speed Queen," explores industrial
music with the Rastafarians in "Rest in
Peace" and slams in "May the Force Be With
You." These interesting tangents into nether
sound amuse and sometimes confuse, but
the overall sound still shouts Soup Dragons.
Some of the most nutty and creative I >ick
son thoughts materialize with the aid of guest
musicians. Bootsy Collins of Parliament fame
hangs loose with his space-bass and under
water space boogie in "Motherfunker," T-
Rex's percussionist Mickey Finn plays congas
in "May the Force be With You" and ex-Spe
cials' l.ynval C iolding and Neville Staples help
make the feel in "Rest in Peace." Perhaps this
newest offering by the Soup Dragons should
be called "Dickson's Jam Session."
A very trippy excursion into Dickson
space, "Hydrophonic" gives a harder and
more varied edge to the old Soup Dragons.
Those worried that the band that they know
and love has died have no need to; this album
does not promote dance-decay. Yet, be ready
to open wide and savor the flavor of Dick
sons experimentation.

to an incessant and masterful weaving of in
triguing lyrics, well-placed sound bites and
exotic instruments.
But why does the album fail to charm me?
In ten syllables: hokey metaphysics mumbo
jumbo. For example, the album opens with
"Transmission," a brief overture in which a
female voice declares, "I give you this for
your consideration. The most important
factor in any metaphysical exercise is the re
lease of belief systems, boundaries, and fears.
All limitations are self-imposed."
Amidst the tweeting birds, looping synth
feedback and hyperventilating drum ma
chine, the track fades out, leaving you won
dering whether you should take them seri
ously or start laughing.
The pseudo-philosophical quotes are
the album's ultimate downfall. Kvery time
you start to enjoy the music, some voice in
terrupts you by blurting out a sentence or
two:

styles. From the sensual voices of Deborah
Anderson and Storm Large to the hip-hop
funk of the Brooklyn Funk Essentials, this
collection transports the listener through
new and experimental sounds and rhythms.
The most danceable song of the collec
tion, "The Nature of our Tribe," makes it im
possible to sit still. Storm Large's voice and
the beats of the brushes on the drums per
vade the listener. "Le 'Main Gauche' de Fats
Waller" by Bonjour Monsieur Basil, a purely
musical selection, reminds one of sitting in a
smoke-Filled jazz ba • in Chicago jammin' to

I dedicate my life to the mystic law of cause
and effect.. .
(Consider the probable reality that all time is
simultaneous.
Huh? Maybe listeners are supposed to
transcend the normal state of human exis
tence and transmogrify themselves into a
kind ot Emersonian universal conscious
ness. But what happens instead? They just
get annoyed.
The best song on this album is "Mother
land" — it contains absolutely no mystical
quotes. Instead, Single Gun Theory uses its
trademark talent to intertwine a charming
song about the idyllic past with beautiful
samples ofsitars and Middle Eastern chants.
Single Gun Theory has set their sights
too high by trying to be our spiritual sav
iors. I lowever, as creators of music, they are
wonderful — that's what they should focus
on.

improvisational rhythms.
The music of the Brooklyn Funk Essen
tials combines jazz beats with pseudo-reggae
voices. The saxophones and horns provide a
perfect background for the singer's subtle
lyrics. Reggae turns to rap with "Vibe Pro
vidin'" by Peace Bureau which combines
funky, modern rap music with jazz beats and
saxophone rhythms.
Showcasing the incredible adaptability of
improvisational jazz in a modern context, this
collection passes the "test" with flying colors.

"Red Hot + Country"
compilation

Country music evokes incredibly diver
gent responses — some people dance furi
ously, howling out of tune, while others
make a face as it smelling onions. For the
casual fan like myself, "Red Hot + Country,"
the music business' latest effort in the fight
against AIDS, is a Whitman's sampler of
country music. Drawing from an talented
pool of traditional and popular artists, "Red
Hot + Country" is a compilation of diverse
and extremely accessible country music.
The album continues the series of pro
ductions by the Red Hot Organization, a
group formed to raise money and awareness
ot the HIV virus and its victims. Its aim is to
educate, and the music is a vehicle for the
message.
In contrast to some previous Red Hot
productions, there is an excellent body of
music behind the underlying message. The
album commences with a poignant rendi
tion of "Teach Your Children," sung by
Kathy Mattea backed by the song's origina
tors - Crosby, Stills and Nash.
Songs and artists range from Mary
Chapin Carpenter's sensual feminine voice
on "Willie Short" to Johnny Cash's rendi
tion of Bob Dylan's "Forever Young" with
his melancholy wistful tone. "Fulsome
River Blues" and "You Gotta Ik* My Baby,"
sung by Brooks and Dunn (of "Boot Scoot
Boogie" fame) and Dolly Parton respective
ly, lend a danceable flavor to the album.
However, the single most powerful mo
ment on the disc comes in "Up Above My
Head / Blind Bartimus," a gospel track with
a deeply moving message of hope for the af
flicted. Through the trembling voices of
Marty Stuart and jerry and Tammy Sulli
van, the music and the message mesh to
gether in the spirit of "Red I lot + Country."
Also appearing on the long list of artists
in the album are: Sammy Kershaw (cover
ing James Taylor's "l ire and Rain"), Jack
son Browne, Billy Ray Cyrus and Fatty
Loveless.
As with any compilation, "Red Hot +
Country" has its low points, most notably
Willie Nelson's disappointing effort on
"Crazy." Yet taken as a whole, the album is a
solid work, drawing together country music
stars of both yesterday and today into one
multidimensional work. Inside there is
something for every country music fan, the
casual and the religious alike.
So buy the album and support a cause,
the music makes it worth your while.
