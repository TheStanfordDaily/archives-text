"Love & A .45"
soundtrack

C.M. Talkington's new film "Love & A
.45" tells the story of a young couple's incred
ibly rocky journey through the heart of Texas
as they are hunted by police, drug dealers and
vengeful outlaws. The journey taken by the
movie's soundtrack is even rockier.
While I must admit that hearing the Butt

hole Surfers and Johnny Cash back-to-back
is good for a chuckle, the soundtracks dis
jointed jumps from rock to ska to punk to
pop to country leave it sounding like a 45-
minute car ride with someone who's con
stantly switching radio stations.
Such discontinuity would be easily forgiv
able if the individual songs were engaging,
but, for the most part, the songs themselves
— like the album — lack character.
There are exceptions, of course — like
"Turn It On," by the Flaming Lips, which
opens the soundtrack with an endearing
surge of imagination and energy. Similarly,

the duet "Love Hurts" by Kim Deal of the
Breeders and Boh Pollard of Ciuided By Voic
es gives the album a sad, sweet and much
needed dose of genuine feeling.
But the remaining bands on "Love & A
.45" just can't seem to muster either the
Flaming Lips' spunk or Deal and Pollard's
emotion, and instead resort to churning out
the same kinds of music, lyrics and styles that
we've all heard before.
Courtney & Western's "Am I in Love"
comes off as stale and trite, and "Black 14," by
April's Motel Room, sounds like the Stone
Temple Pilots sounding like Alice in Chains.

Even the usually reliable Meat Puppets and
Jesus and Mary Chain put forth only
mediocre efforts.
The songs aren't disastrous; they're just
not very interesting. And when they come
one after another, without even an attempt at
cohesiveness, the album's intriguing variety
of artists becomes strangely monotonous.
In "Come On," Jesus and Mary Chain
sing, "Nothing could be something if the
feeling's right." Unfortunately, for too much
of the "Love & A .45" soundtrack, the feel
ing's just not right.
