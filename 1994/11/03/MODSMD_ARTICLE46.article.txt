# Minimalist tragic comedy addresses universal issues
## 
### Linda Friedlieb 
When Thomas Wolfe coined the phrase,
"You can't go home again," as the title of
his 1940 novel, he didn't realize play
wright David Storey would take a page out ofhis
book three decades later while creating a bitter
sweet portrait of four individuals in their twi
light years.
A minimalist exercise in theater — where a
few props, a box-like set, a string of broken
phrases and words, and four legends of the Bay
Area stage bring alive a tragedy within a comedy
— "Home" provides a strong contrast to the
American Conservatory Theater's other ongo
ing comedy within a tragedy, "Angels in Ameri
ca."
Where "Angels" is dramatic and overpower
ing, "Home" is subtle and manipulative. Where
"Angels" compresses dozens of characters into
seven hours, tackling every issue from political
repression to AIDS, "I Iome" limits itself to five
characters and a few substantive, universal Is
sues — loss of culture, loss of love, loss of rela
tionship to reality.
Yet its simplicity does not take away the im
pact of going "Home."
Directed by AC.T. artistic director Carey
Perloff, "Home" is a collage of details and sen
tence fragments.
For the first three or four minutes of the play,
there isn't a single word of dialogue. Instead,
Harry (William Patterson) walks slowly into the
yard, discovers a table where he might sit, exam
ines both the chair and the table for dust, care
fully arranges his hat, gloves and newspaper in
their proper places on the table, then rearranges
them, and checks the crease in each leg of his
pants — all before sitting down and gazing off
into the uncharacteristically blue sky of Eng

land.
Patterson delivers an unbeatable perfor
mance as Harry, whose thoughts arc monopo
lized with reverence for the past and its tradi
tions and mannerisms. When his friend Jack
(Raye Birk), in the course of admiring Harry's
gloves, accidentally uses one of them to cover his
own hand, Harry remarks with the haughty su
periority of the genteel:
"Sometimes you can judge a person's charac
ter by his behavior."

Both Harry and Jack maintain the facade of
men with lives to go home to, while the two
schlubby women who share their home, Mar
jorie and Kathleen, break down their facades to
reveal the truth of shattered lives. Marjone
(Ruth Kobert) smirks as she accuses Harry of at
tempting to escape and acts protectively toward
the overly flirtatious Kathleen (Joy Carlin).
The bitter sadness of "Home" is accentuated
by the fact that the play is dedicated to the mem
ory of another longtime A.C.T. veteran Sydney

Walker who died September 30. The part of Jack
was originally reserved for Walker, who bowed
out after being diagnosed with cancer.
"Home" remains strongest as a quiet portrait
of aging and individual loss, of men and women
who have secrets they'd rather leave behind as
they age and lose contact with the real world.
When it reaches to serve as a critique of fading
British culture however, the story loses much of
its poignance and contemporary meaning.
Many of Storey's words seem to fly over the
heads of an American audience.
In many ways, "Home" remains a puzzle
with a few missing pieces. Through the first
scene (a good 30 to 40 minutes), Patterson and
Birk carry on a kind of mutual dialogue which
leaves us wondering whether they're in a coun
try club, a nursing home, a vacation resort or
prison.
Ultimately the characters' words and mo
tions that serve as the cryptic clues necessary in
unraveling "Home" 's maze of complexity, but
only if we disregard the red herrings strewn
along the path bridging fantasy and reality, Oz
and Kansas, Storey's "Home" and our own. ■
