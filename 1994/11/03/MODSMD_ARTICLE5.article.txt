# As funding dries up, Stanford reaches out
## Administrative outsourcing 'wave of future' 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
As a final group of se
nior lawyers prepares to
leave the University Legal
Office this week — the re
sult of an "outsourcing"
plan that will reduce of
fice staff from 27 to eight
University employees —
other campus administra
tors facing budget con
straints are making simi
lar choices.

And as more and more administrative
units bring in outside private groups to do
work once done by campus offices, some
University officials are talking as if such
procedures could spread.
Provost Condoleezza Rice, who is re
sponsible for setting Stanford's budget,
called outsourcing a part of the overall
cost-cutting effort she has outlined in re
cent interviews.
"We always do have to ask the question,
when it's a service that's not part of the
University's [central] mission ... if we can
do it more cheaply outside [the Universi
ty]. We have to take a chance and look at
doing things differently," she said.

"We're not on a wholesale outsourcing
bandwagon," Rice added, referring to the
changes as "taking the opportunities" pre
sented as the administration evaluates
every aspect of the University bureaucra
cy.
Reforms made last year have already
brought a number of private contractors to
campus, including new delivery and graph
ic design services as well as the new legal
team. In addition, the Stanford Manage
ment Group, which operates the Stanford
Shopping Center, was brought in by a task
force last year to restructure the services
provided at Tresidder Union.
"It's the wave of the future," said Terry
Shepard, director of University communi
cations, who praised the approach as a sen
sible way to cut costs in a constrained bud
getary environment.
Shepard, whose office oversees the de
sign and publishing of official University
documents, said he disbanded the Stanford
Graphic Center last summer because the
University simply could not afford to un
derwrite an organization that was "losing
money badly."
The provost's goal of reducing the Uni
versity budget by $12 million over the next


Rice
two years requires that such
money-losing, non-essential ser
vices be eliminated, Shepard said.
Rice said as much when she
outlined this year's budget plan
as a re-engineering effort that
would evaluate administrative
processes around the University.
"I think we've cut about as much
as we can with this sort of old
fashioned belt-tightening," she
said then.
One area specifically men
tioned as a potential site of out
sourcing in last year's budget plan
was the facilities department, but
both Rice and Associate Vice
President for Facilities Kernel
Dawkins stressed that outsourc
ing was only one option in making
repairs more quickly and effi
ciently.
The same reasoning was used
to justify the changes to Tresidder
made last year. The Stanford
Management Group has begun to
make changes, such as forming an
advisory task group, designed to
wean Tresidder off its annual
$900,000 subsidy from the Uni
versity.

A task force, chaired by Vice
Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds, was
appointed last year to oversee the
restructuring of Tresidder after
the student union was targeted to
bear the brunt of budget cuts to
Student Affairs.
The reformed legal office is
already beginning to see budget
reductions in the first month of
its scaled-down operations, said
University General Counsel
Michael Roster.
The outsourcing process that
he has instituted is budgeted to
save some $500,000 in legal costs
this year and $1 million per year
after severance payments have
ended.
The reforms stem from the
idea of the "virtual corporation"
currently popular in the business
press, blurring the distinction
between in-house and outsourced
legal services, Roster said.
By asking outside lawyers to
work at Stanford rather than in a
high-rise and paying them a
retainer instead of according to
the actual hours they spend on a
case, Roster said, his brand of out
sourcing provides a more efficient
operation without sacrificing
knowledge of the University.
As a whole, the reforms "place

the incentive on the law firm to
manage work much more effi
ciently," he said. "They have to be
very clever and find solutions."
This, along with the expertise
provided by networks within
firms, provides better quality
legal service, Roster said. "When
we ask them a question, they've
probably seen it before," he
explained.
An example he gave was a legal
question that had troubled a Uni
versity administrator for several
weeks, cleared up in five minutes
by a lawyer from an outside firm
at a recent seminar. University
lawyers, on the other hand, prob
ably would have had to research
the question in order to provide
an answer, he said.
Unlike the high-profile IBM
sponsorship of the Stanford Cen
ter for Materials Research
announced last week, these kinds
of new private partnerships will
primarily do behind-the-scenes
work, so the effects will be hard to
discern as the trend continues.
If the legal office is an example,
Roster said, students probably
won't see much difference from
this type of change.
"It's largely irrelevant where
they get their paycheck — they're
Stanford's lawyers," he said.
