# As funding dries up, Stanford reaches out
## Administrative outsourcing 'wave of future' 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
As a final group of se
nior lawyers prepares to
leave the University Legal
Office this week — the re
sult of an "outsourcing"
plan that will reduce of
fice staff from 27 to eight
University employees —
other campus administra
tors facing budget con
straints are making simi
lar choices.

And as more and more administrative
units bring in outside private groups to do
work once done by campus offices, some
University officials are talking as if such
procedures could spread.
Provost Condoleezza Rice, who is re
sponsible for setting Stanford's budget,
called outsourcing a part of the overall
cost-cutting effort she has outlined in re
cent interviews.
"We always do have to ask the question,
when it's a service that's not part of the
University's [central] mission ... if we can
do it more cheaply outside [the Universi
ty]. We have to take a chance and look at
doing things differently," she said.

"We're not on a wholesale outsourcing
bandwagon," Rice added, referring to the
changes as "taking the opportunities" pre
sented as the administration evaluates
every aspect of the University bureaucra
cy.
Reforms made last year have already
brought a number of private contractors to
campus, including new delivery and graph
ic design services as well as the new legal
team. In addition, the Stanford Manage
ment Group, which operates the Stanford
Shopping Center, was brought in by a task
force last year to restructure the services
provided at Tresidder Union.
"It's the wave of the future," said Terry
Shepard, director of University communi
cations, who praised the approach as a sen
sible way to cut costs in a constrained bud
getary environment.
Shepard, whose office oversees the de
sign and publishing of official University
documents, said he disbanded the Stanford
Graphic Center last summer because the
University simply could not afford to un
derwrite an organization that was "losing
money badly."
