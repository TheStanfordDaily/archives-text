# Three-year graduates doubled in past 2 years
## Casper's support for plan cited as potential cause 
### Megan Himan Staff writer 
Two years after University President
Gerhard Casper's nationally-publicized
call for a three-year degree program, the
number of Stanford undergraduates
choosing to graduate early has doubled.
The Registrar's office reports that 45
students graduated in 10 quarters or less
last year, an increase from the 23 students
who graduated early in 1992.
The 45 students who graduated early
last year composed 3 percent of their class,
compared to the 1.5 percent of the 1989 en
tering freshman class who graduated early
in 1992.
The significant increase in early gradua
tion has come in the two years since Casper
advocated the option of acquiring a degree
in three years — a concept that caught the
national media's attention.
Though only 45 students graduated
early last June, many more had completed
the required 180 units for graduation.
Twenty-one percent of those students en

tering as freshmen from 1987-89 had
earned 180 units by the end of their third
year, according to the 1994 Report of the
Commission on Undergraduate Educa
tion,
"Many students have been able to grad
uate in three years long before President
Casper expressed interest in the three-year
degree," said Associate Registrar Jack Far
rell.
Farrell added that many students enter
Stanford with enough units to be sopho
mores, due to Advanced Placement and
other credits from college courses taken
during their high school years.
Though the number of students gradu
ating in three years is small in absolute
terms, Paddy McGowan, director of re
search for the Registrar's Office, identified
the percentage increase as a significant
trend which was not predicted. "I'm losing
students faster than I expected," she said.
Although she was hesitant to make any
statement about the causes of the trend,
McGowan said that a combination of in-
creased AP credits among enter
ing freshmen and the rising cost
of tuition probably aided the
trend. One hundred ninety-eight
students entered Stanford with
more than 41 units of AP credit in
1991 — the entering class which
last year graduated 45 students
early.
Casper's encouragement of the
three-year degree could also have
increased the number of students
choosing to graduate early,
McGowan added.
"It has certainly crossed my
mind that the talk of a three-year
plan might have had some influ

ence," McGowan said
The commission did not advo
cate the implementation of a for
mal three-year program, but rec
ommended that students should
be made aware of the option of
graduating early.
"I think it's a valuable option
for some students," said History
Prof. James Sheehan, the commis
sion's chair.
Although Casper has been
encouraging discussion about the
three-year plan, no requirements
would be changed to facilitate
early graduation, Sheehan said.
"Casper's been eager to make
the option available," Sheehan
said. "But I don't think he's sug
gesting that we make the require
ments harder or easier."
Whatever its causes, the

increasing trend of three-year
graduation correspondingly affects
University admissions decisions,
McGowan said.
McGowan provides the admis
sions office with target numbers
for incoming freshman and trans
fer students to meet a numerical
goal for total undergraduate
enrollment. This year, the Univer
sity fell 30 students short of its
goal of 6,595 undergraduates, in
part due to the increase of stu
dents choosing to graduate early in
the past year, she said.
Currently, students do not need
to go through a special process to
graduate early, Farrell said. Stu
dents who have completed their
180 units simply go through the
regular application process for
graduation.
