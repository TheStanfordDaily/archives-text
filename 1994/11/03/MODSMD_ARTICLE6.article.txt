Two years after University President
Gerhard Casper's nationally-publicized
call for a three-year degree program, the
number of Stanford undergraduates
choosing to graduate early has doubled.
The Registrar's office reports that 45
students graduated in 10 quarters or less
last year, an increase from the 23 students
who graduated early in 1992.
The 45 students who graduated early
last year composed 3 percent of their class,
compared to the 1.5 percent of the 1989 en

in 1992.
The significant increase in early gradua

advocated the option of acquiring a degree
in three years â€” a concept that caught the
national media's attention.
Though only 45 students graduated
early last June, many more had completed
the required 180 units for graduation.
Twenty-one percent of those students en

tering as freshmen from 1987-89 had
earned 180 units by the end of their third
year, according to the 1994 Report of the
Commission on Undergraduate Educa
tion,
"Many students have been able to grad
uate in three years long before President
Casper expressed interest in the three-year
degree," said Associate Registrar Jack Far
rell.
Farrell added that many students enter
Stanford with enough units to be sopho
mores, due to Advanced Placement and
other credits from college courses taken
during their high school years.
Though the number of students gradu
ating in three years is small in absolute
terms, Paddy McGowan, director of re
search for the Registrar's Office, identified
the percentage increase as a significant
trend which was not predicted. "I'm losing
students faster than I expected," she said.
Although she was hesitant to make any
statement about the causes of the trend,
McGowan said that a combination of in-
