# Dance group to be featured on silver screen
## Ragtimers to swing in PBS documentary 
### Erin Wood 
Just as the film "The Sting"
helped popularize ragtime
music, Stanford's Vintage Dance
Ensemble is also using the silver
screen to popularize the era's
other legacy: ragtime dance.
KCET, a Los Angeles-based
television station, will be at the
sixth-annual Ragtime Ball this
Saturday to film the ensemble in
action. The film will be used for
an episode of a Public Broadcast
ing System documentary looking
at the resurgence of ragtime
music and dance in the United
States.
The Vintage Dance Ensemble
— a two-unit course made up of
approximately 60 members — is
the only dance group which will
be included in the production.
This isn't the group's first
brush with the glamour of film.
Twenty members of the ensem
ble will be featured in a CBS Sun
day Afternoon Showcase, called
"Spring Awakenings," this Sun
day.
Dance Prof. Richard Powers
leads the ensemble, teaching the

group both 19th-century and
Ragtime Era dances dating back
to 1912.
Powers originally heard about
the PBS opportunity when "a
colleague told me that [PBS was]
planning on filming ragtime

music and dance around this
time of year." He made the initial
contacts, and the group was cho
sen to perform.
"Richard Powers really does it
right and really tries to create an
atmosphere," said Morgan

Neville of KCET, associate pro
ducer of the documentary. "For
authenticity and verisimilitude,
the Stanford Ball is supposed to
be the best."
