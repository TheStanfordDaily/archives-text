# Dance group to be featured on silver screen
## Ragtimers to swing in PBS documentary 
### Erin Wood 
Just as the film "The Sting"
helped popularize ragtime
music, Stanford's Vintage Dance
Ensemble is also using the silver
screen to popularize the era's
other legacy: ragtime dance.
KCET, a Los Angeles-based
television station, will be at the
sixth-annual Ragtime Ball this
Saturday to film the ensemble in
action. The film will be used for
an episode of a Public Broadcast
ing System documentary looking
at the resurgence of ragtime
music and dance in the United
States.
The Vintage Dance Ensemble
— a two-unit course made up of
approximately 60 members — is
the only dance group which will
be included in the production.
This isn't the group's first
brush with the glamour of film.
Twenty members of the ensem
ble will be featured in a CBS Sun
day Afternoon Showcase, called
"Spring Awakenings," this Sun
day.
Dance Prof. Richard Powers
leads the ensemble, teaching the

group both 19th-century and
Ragtime Era dances dating back
to 1912.
Powers originally heard about
the PBS opportunity when "a
colleague told me that [PBS was]
planning on filming ragtime

music and dance around this
time of year." He made the initial
contacts, and the group was cho
sen to perform.
"Richard Powers really does it
right and really tries to create an
atmosphere," said Morgan

Neville of KCET, associate pro
ducer of the documentary. "For
authenticity and verisimilitude,
the Stanford Ball is supposed to
be the best."

Eight members of the Stanford Vintage Dance Ensemble dance on the riverboat set of their CBS film.
But members of the Ensemble
do not seem to feel the extra pres
sure associated with the PBS
filming.
"There hasn't been anymore
effort than usual," said Ryan
Knots, a junior. "We never seem
to have a whole lot of time before
performances — we're constantly
learning new dances."
But other members said they
are feeling a bit rushed because
the group has had only six weeks
to prepare for the Ball.
"I'm used to being polished
and professional," said freshman
Adrienne Ruth. "I'm feeling a bit
thrown together."
Despite the hurry, members
still said they are enjoying the
entire dancing experience. For
many, the Ball means more than
simply being filmed.
Alumnus James Mendoza, who
still participates in the class, said
that he is not sure exactly why he
enjoys dancing so much, but
added "it is spiritual and fun —
being close to someone, you can
feel the music, feel the atmo
sphere."
This atmosphere is achieved
with intense research. Powers

watches silent films of the Rag
time Era, interviews people
who lived in the early decades
of the century and owns one of
the largest private collections
of dance manuals in the coun
try.
Female members also put in
hours of research in order to
design their costumes. I heir
gowns — some of which will be
sewn by the members them
selves — will also be used for
other performances throughout
the year.
Members decided last spring
to costume the entire group in
clothes of the period for a more
authentic look. Women now
must wear elaborate dresses,
and men must be in tails.
Powers said this focus on
authenticity is very important to
him. To try and retain a sense of
improvisation, partners for the
elaborate dances will be decided
only moments before they are
performed.
Only one dance, the Castle
Walk, has designated partners
because of the complexity of
some of the steps. The steps —
16 pivots in a row — were called,
"absolutely impossible, almost
as hard as eating 50 eggs" by
senior Luke Haseloff, who has
been part of the group for two
years.
