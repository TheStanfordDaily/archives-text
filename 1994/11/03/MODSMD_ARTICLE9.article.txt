# SHS to network with local groups

Stanford Health Services yes
terday announced its intent to
form a health care network with
the Palo Alto Medical Founda
tion and the Sacramento-based
company Sutter Health.
"We're hoping to more closely
integrate Stanford with the Palo
Alto clinic," said Peter Van
Etten, president and chief execu
tive officer of Stanford Health
Services.
Stanford Health Services
(SHS) is a corporate manage
ment body which is overseeing
the merger of the clinical opera
tions of Stanford Hospital, the
Medical School, and affiliated
local physicians.
Currently, major insurance
providers, such as the govern
ment and large corporations,
have to contract independently
with Stanford and the Palo Alto
Medical Foundation (PAMF) to
get health care for their employ
ees. Under the new system, a
third entity would negotiate with
insurers on behalf of both SHS
and PAMF.
"Reduction of costs is a major
objective," Van Etten said. SHS
hopes that, "through eliminat
ing costly duplication of services
and facilities, Stanford Health
Services and PAMF can provide
a more seamless delivery sys
tem," he added.

In the long run, Van Etten
said he hopes that "streamlin
ing" of the local health care sys
tem will produce "significant
benefits for the consumer."
Van Etten added that the net
work will benefit not only con
sumers, but the Stanford medi
cal program as a whole. He said
he believes that cooperation with
PAMF will allow Stanford to
continue to develop state-of-the
art care, while keeping costs
down.
The letter of intent, which
establishes guidelines for the
network, states that the two
organizations will now cooperate
not only in administering care,
but also in teaching medical stu
dents and resident physicians.
Under the new plan, "each
entity will continue to play the
same type of role as it did
before," said Dr. David Druker,
the chief operating officer of
PAMF. Stanford will continue to
place more of an emphasis on
tertiary, more specialized health
care while PAMF concentrates
more on primary care.
Despite the letter of intent,
the agreement is far from final.
"A lot more was left unsaid than
said," said Steve Heath, the vice
president for communications at
Sutter Health. "The letter is in
essence a framework agreement.
Now it's up to the lawyers to
hammer out the details."

In 1992, Stanford and PAMF
signed a similar agreement
which fell apart three months
later when the two organizations
failed to agree on details of their
affiliation.
"The final agreement will
most likely come in 60 to 90
days," Heath said.
Druker said he is also sure the
agreement will be final within
the next few months. "The time
is right," he said. "I think that
both organizations are delighted
that we are finally able to get
together."
While the network alliance
could mean changes in the way
Stanford interacts with contrac
tors, Heath said that "from the
standpoint of a typical person
there will be practically no
change in his or her health care."
He also emphasized that at no
time would there be a disruption
of care, nor would anyone have
to switch physicians as a result
of the new network.
According to Heath, Sutter
Health — the parent company of
PAMF — brings with it a net
work of hospitals, part of Sut
ter's long-range goal to form a
Northern California health care
network. By joining the network,
the new alliance will gain con
tracting clout, as well as "the
experience and expertise of Sut
ter in the area of managed care,"
Heath said.
