Computer Painting
Noted digital artist Jeremy
Sutton will teach this half-day
seminar to introduce the
basics of painting on a computer. You will learn to
use a drawing tablet and the NEW Fractal Painter 3.0
on our Power Macs. This is a HANDS-ON class, where
the instructor will demonstrate the software, and you
get to try it yourself! Only a basic knowledge of the
Mac is needed-you can learn the rest here. The semi
nar is Sunday, November 1 3 from 1 to 5 PM. The $90
price ($ 150 for a couple sharing one computer)
includes instruction and computer time for the class, as
well as one free photo-realistic dye sublimation print
and two additional hours of practice time. With a
limit of five people, you will get plenty of personal
attention, but you must sign up in advance.
