You should be proud ot your college record. You saw a
window of opportunity and you took advantage of it, with
hard work, determination, and—finally—success. And
your timing couldn't be better, because right now LSI
Logic is poised for a similar opportunity—a perfect
convergence of our new technologies and market demands.
A decade ago we pioneered ASK!! technology—
a semiconductor technology that allows electronics
manufacturers to design their own integrated circuits. Since
then, we've led the ASIC industry to another level—system
level integration. Our new technology allows our Designers
to put a complete system on a single chip...and our 500K
(1.5 million gate technology) process provides the means to
manufacture it.
But we can't continue to lead the industry alone—and
that's where you come in. Our success has created
challenging engineering opportunities for you in the
following areas:
• Fihb Omen
• Smmi
• Process
