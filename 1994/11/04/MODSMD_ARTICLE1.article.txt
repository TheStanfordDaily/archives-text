# Bay Area pro fros honored

### Mia Sara Bruch 
As part of an intensified effort
to identify and attract academi
cally gifted students to the Uni
versity, the Stanford Office of Ad
missions will fete 50 selected Bay
Area high school seniors in a spe
cial program this Sunday.
The students, who were select
ed on the basis of self-reported
grades and test scores, will be
treated to a more intimate version
of a standard event in the Stan
ford admissions calendar: the
general information meeting for
Bay Area students. Held every
year in Memorial Auditorium, the
meeting traditionally hosts up to
3,000 prospective students and
parents.
The program will feature a
panel of speakers who will high
light research opportunities avail
able to undergraduates at Stan
ford, and will be moderated by
Laura Selznick, director of Un
dergraduate Research Opportuni
ties. Several students who have
pursued research in the sciences
and the humanities at Stanford
with the support of URO grants
will detail their experiences.
"Although selecting the invi
tees involved some hair-splitting,
the Admissions Committee feels
strongly that a more personal for
mat was needed to convey the
special opportunities available to
Stanford undergraduates," said
Elise Marr, assistant director of
admissions and the organizer of
this weekend's new program.
The panel was initiated this
year to provide a more personal
format to answer prospective stu
dents' questions about Stanford
and to help them negotiate the
admissions process, Marr said. It
will be held in tandem with the
traditional large informational
meeting, which will take place
later Sunday afternoon.
The new program is a novel
step for the admissions office in
that in represents a more concen
trated effort to attract academi
cally gifted students to Stanford.
Detailed recruitment programs
already exist to attract athletes
and minority students.
"We should direct our efforts
towards academically gifted stu
dents just as much as we devote
them to athletes and minorities,"
said Associate Director of Admis
sions John Reider.
Although Stanford has suf
fered from a declining yield rate

among freshman admittees, Rei
der characterized the new pro
gramming as a natural extension
of Stanford's current outreach
efforts rather than as a response
to the new statistics.
"We already make faculty
names available to prospectives
from the outset of the application
process," Reider said. "I see this
more as a threshold for coopera
tion between the admissions
office and the faculty in attract
ing students who will thrive here.
"Our yield rates have
remained relatively stable for a
while, and this program was not
created out of a sense of crisis,"
he added. Yield rates represent
the percentage of accepted stu
dents who choose to attend Stan
ford.
Although this Sunday's pro
gram is the only one of its kind
planned for the upcoming year,
Reider said he hopes to follow up
with the selected students over
the course of the admissions cal
endar, perhaps by having faculty
contact them individually in the
winter and spring.
Reider is co-chair of a commit
tee recently formed by Director of
Admissions James Montoya to
explore possible reforms in the
admissions process, including
increased faculty involvement
and the establishment of an early
decision program. The commit
tee was created earlier this fall in
light of decreasing yield rates in
incoming freshman classes.
