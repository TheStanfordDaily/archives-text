# Mother confesses to killing sons
## Manhunt for boys kidnapped in carjacking ends with arrest of mother 
### 
UNION, S.C. (AP) - The
mother who said a carjacker
dumped her on a lonely road and
drove off with her two young sons
in the back seat was charged yes
terday with their murders after
allegedly confessing.
Susan V. Smith, 23, who had
made tearful pleas on national tele
vision for the boys' return, was in
custody and would be arraigned
Friday, Union County Sheriff
Howard Wells said yesterday.
The nine-day search for 3-year
old Michael and 14-month-old
Alex, which stretched from Geor
gia to Seattle, ended where it
began, in Lake John D. Long near
where Mrs. Smith told police a
gunman forced her from the car
Oct. 25 and drove away with the
boys.
Mrs. Smith apparently provided
information that led investigators
to her car yesterday afternoon,
Solicitor Thomas Pope said.
Police divers discovered her
1990 burgundy Mazda in the lake
with the bodies of two children in
the back seat, State Law Enforce
ment Division spokesman Hugh

Munn said.
The car had been driven off a
boat ramp, he said. Divers
searched the lake several times
during the past few days, but the
water was too murky to see the car,
which was pulled out of the lake
last night, he said.
The identities of the bodies
would have to be confirmed
through an autopsy, Wells said.
He would not take questions at
a news conference and did not dis
cuss a possible motive nor how
investigators were led to the lake.
Mrs. Smith confessed to the
killings, her arrest warrant said. It
did not say if the confession came
before or after the car was found.
The arrest warrant alleged the
boys died Oct. 25 but did not say
how.
Hundreds of volunteers from
the small town torn by the disap
pearances had combed the area for
clues.
Dozens of people crowded
around outside the county court
house for Wells' news conference
and many gasped and sobbed as
Wells said Mrs. Smith would be

charged with murder.
"If she didn't want those chil
dren, she could have given them to
me or any other mother in Union.
We would have taken them," said
Karen Huss, the mother of two
sons, ages 2 and 4.
Alex and Michael's great-grand
mother expressed shock at the
day's events.
"I just couldn't imagine that
Susan would do that. She always
seemed to be such a devoted moth
er," Sara Singleton said in an inter
view with KNBC-TV from Sylmar,
Calif. Her grandson, David Smith,
is the boys' father.
As late as Tuesday, Wells said
he was treating the case "as a car
jacking that happened as it was
reported," though investigators
were perplexed about how the car
and the boys could have disap
peared so completely.
"In the absence of any hard fact
or evidence, the choice is yours,
why not hope for the best .. . and
presume them to be alive, presume
the story to be as it's given to you
until you can prove it otherwise?"
Wells said yesterday.
