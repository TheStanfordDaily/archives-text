# Islamic militants jostle Arafat

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) â€” Islamic
militants knocked oft Yasser Arafat's head
dress, called him a traitor and threw him out of
a mosque funeral yesterday in his worst politi
cal embarrassment as head of the Palestinian
government.
Enraged mourners fired guns wildly into
the air as a phalanx of police guards whisked
Arafat away from the chaotic service for Hani
Abed, a militant leader killed by a car bomb the
fundamentalists blamed on Israel.
"Arafat is a collaborator!" shouted mem
bers of the extremist Islamic Jihad movement
as Arafat was shoved out a back door of the
Omari mosque and into the pouring rain.
The scene underscored the growing extrem
ist opposition Arafat has faced in the Gaza
Strip since Palestinian self-rule began in May.
The PLO leader is wedged between Israeli
demands to crack down on Muslim fundamen

talists responsible for deadly attacks on Israeli
civilians, and the need to win their support for
self-rule.
Arafat, who had just returned from a
regional economic conference in Morocco,
came straight from the border to pay his
respects at the funeral of Abed, 35.
Abed died Wednesday after a bomb explod
ed when he opened the trunk of his air. He
had been detained by Palestinian police for 18
days in June on suspicion of helping plan an
attack at the Erez border crossing into Israel
in which two soldiers were killed. It was the
first attack on Israeli soldiers after autonomy
began.
Islamic Jihad leader Sheikh Abdullah Shcirru
sjiid only Israel could do such an expert job of rig
ging the car bomb that killed Abed. I le demand
ed that Palestinian police protect Islamic leaders
and threatened swift retaliation.
