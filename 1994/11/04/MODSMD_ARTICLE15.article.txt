Jury selected
LOS ANGELES (AP) — A jury
that includes eight blacks and eight
women was chosen yesterday for the
murder trial of O.J. Simpson. A quest
for 15 alternates remains.
Immediately after the 12 jurors
were chosen, they stood, raised their
right hands and took an oath.
"I want to welcome you to the
league of judges," Superior Court
Judge Lance Ito told them. "I believe
vou can rise to the occasion despite
the unusual circumstances. I know
you can do a good job in this case and
I trust you."
Lawyers settled on a panel with

eight women and four men. In addi
tion to the blacks, one juror is white,
one Hispanic and two are of mixed
races. Their ages range from 22 to 52.
"It's an extremely good jury for the
defense for several different reasons
beyond the obvious one that it's an
African-American jury," said Peter
Arenella, a UCLA law professor.
Zhirinovsky visit
MOSCOW (AP) - Vladimir Zhiri
novsky, the bad boy of Russian poli
tics, is finally getting a chance to tell
Americans in person just what he
thinks of them.
Alter a four-month wait, the United

States this week gave Zhirinovsky per
mission to visit in light of America's
"long and respected tradition of allow
ing freedom of speech to all persons."
Zhirinovsky, who flies to San
Erancisco on Sunday, said he wants
Americans to get to know him better.
"They should know the truth about
me, which they can learn by listening
to me," he said yesterday in an inter
view with The Associated Press.
He normally demands to be paid
for interviews, but is granting free
interviews prior to the visit.
Asked why he wants to visit the
country he once branded the "empire
of evil," Zhirinovsky said he was not
referring to the American people.
