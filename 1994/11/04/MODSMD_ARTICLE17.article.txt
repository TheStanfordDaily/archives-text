## Editorial Choose a somebody 
### 
Dianne Feinstein is the
only plausible choice for
Senate on Election Day

There is an old political
maxim that says "you can't
beat a somebody with a
nobody." Hopefully, the 1994 Cali
fornia Senate race will not be an
exception to this rule. Incumbent
Senator Dianne Feinstein is clearly
a "somebody," and her challenger,
U.S. Rep. Michael Huffington, is
turning in an Oscar performance
for the other part.

Just two years after her
landslide victory over then-
Senator John Seymour,
Feinstein has a better
record than some of her col
leagues who have been
there four times as long.
Specifically, she was a galva-

nizing force behind the Desert Pro
tection Bill, the ban on assault
weapons, the expansion of the
earned-income tax credit, and
numerous other measures designed
to help California. She has been a
leader in easing California's transi
tion to a downsized defense indus
try, and she brought much-needed
female representation to the Senate
Judiciary Committee. She has a
good working relationship with the
White House but is by no means in
President Clinton's pocket.
More generally, she has listened
to and managed to represent all of
the various (and often competing)
interests in this state. For example,
she has gained the respect of the
agricultural and environmental
communities.
These legislative victories and
other accomplishments did not
come easy. In her short term, Fein
stein has learned the ins and outs of
Washington with amazing speed.
She knows how to maneuver on the
state's behalf.
Not bad for two years. But if this
were not enough reason to vote for
her, there is the issue of her oppo

nent, one-term Congressman
Michael HufTington.
A Texas oil millionaire, HufTing
ton moved to the Santa Barbara
area with only one thing to match
his bank account — his ambition.
He spent millions of his own money
to unseat longtime incumbent con
gressman Bob Lagomarsino and,
once in Washington, immediately
began campaigning for Senate.
Setting the negative tone of the
campaign early on, he began run
ning deceptive and hostile TV ads
that showed he had little more to
offer than criticism. In fact, one of
the few ideas he has put forward is a
plan to dismantle the welfare sys-

tem. But like his tax
returns, the details of this
plan are nowhere to be seen.
Although he had nothing
to do with the policy at
hand, he spent oodles of
money to put his name on
the committee supporting

the three-strikes initiative. Not only
did this move show the transparen
cy of his buy-everything-in-sight
campaign, but the three-strikes ini
tiative is bad policy.
And then there's "nannygate."
Huffington jumped on Governor
Pete Wilson's xenophobic Proposi
tion 187 bandwagon and blamed
many of this state's problems on
undocumented immigrants. But
with a couple weeks to go, it was dis
covered that he himself has
employed an undocumented nanny.
What's worse than this hypocrisy is
how he tried to explain it. After
demanding that his wife (who has
ties to a religious cult) be left out of
the campaign, the first thing he did
after nannygate broke was blame
her for hiring the nanny.
Dianne Feinstein is one of the
most moderate, effective and talent
ed politicians this state has. She is a
somebody. Michael Huffington is
just an oil baron long on money and
ambition and short on everything
else. There's no question which
Stanford grad will make the school
more proud — send DiFi back to
Washington for six more years.
