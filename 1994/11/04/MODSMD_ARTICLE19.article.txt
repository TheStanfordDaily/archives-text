## Marco L. DeCapite Don't reduce God to a cable channel 
### 
Recently, i
SAW flyers on
campus adver
tising a particular
Christian affiliate by
stating. "If you believe
that men and women
should share equally
in the sacraments and
service of Christianity

service ui
join us where God's calling can be
answered by anyone." This type of reli
gious propaganda saddened me deeply,
not because I think women shouldn't
have the same opportunities as men in
the church, but because it draws people to
a religious group for the wrong reasons.
While subtle and seemingly harmless,
this type of advertisement represents the
degradation of religion today in our soci
ety. It doesn't focus on God, on our exis
tence, on our spirituality or life after
death. Instead, religion has become a set
of political parties lobbying for what
each group believes is right. It's a symbol
of the cable-TV generation of today,
where we're offered hundreds of chan
nels and a fancy remote control to jump
around to whatever suits our needs the
best. God isn't a cable channel. Who are
we to think we can customize the will of
God? "No women as priests on Channel
53?" Click.
Furthermore, pitting the plethora of
religious choices against each other con
tinues to divide the church — a division
created by man, not by God. People are

not perfect, so organized religion will
never be perfect since it's a structure cre
ated by people. It's a simple transitive
property taught in elementary school: if a
equals band b equals c, then a equals c.
Many seem to forget the basics in our
complicated world. Where are we going
when political agendas are tagged to reli
gious groups? Back to the sale of indul
gences? We need unity in this world more
than ever. We need to overcome the bar
riers, to recognize each other as brothers
and sisters of the same faith.
Why do we, especially those true to
our faith and belief in God, whether we
be Protestant, Catholic, Muslim or
Orthodox, continue to drive spikes
between each other? It's such trivial
issues that lead to holy wars, the ulti
mate acts against God's will. How can
there be crusaders who claim they're
killing in the name of God? Pro-lifers
who bomb abortion clinics and kill doc
tors? Pro-choicers who condemn pro-lif
ers? I don't recall God endorsing any
such acts in any of the holy books. Did I
misread somewhere? What about the
basics: "love thy neighbor as thyself?" or
"let him who is without sin cast the first
stone?" It seems like there's a lot a
stone-throwing and not a lot of peace in
this world. "WHAT? No premarital sex
on Channel 46? Can't handle that
thought!" Click.
So what's all this talk about God?
"Most intelligent people don't believe in
God," a friend said to me recently. Well,

there must have been a mistake when I
applied to Stanford — or God answered
my prayers. But that couldn't have hap
pened because we live in a society focused
on what we can see, taste, touch, feel; one
that is so devoid of trust and faith in each
other that the "intelligent" are taught to
demand empirical data for everything
before it's accepted as truth.
So faith and trust in God has become a
fool's pastime. It's too bad, because now
is when we need God the most. When
families are split apart more than ever,
when children are abandoned and
abused, when wars leave millions home
less, while AIDS spreads worldwide and
so on. But instead of turning toward God,
many use these facts as evidence that
God doesn't exist, aifci thfe'fWfetion only
gets worse. "Look at this. God let me get
a C- in calculus!" Click.
So many of us limit our studies to the
finite, the facts, the scientific results.
Don't we close a part of ourselves out if
ignore the signs, symbols and
metaphors of life as well? We need to be
in touch with our own spirituality and
transcend the petty bickering. If we
could just get away from these unimpor
tant issues that overwhelm our daily
lives, maybe we can each rise above
them and find the peace we need to
begin the real healing process in our
society.
