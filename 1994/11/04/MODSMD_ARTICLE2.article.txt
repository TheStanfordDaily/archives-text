# Democrats win students' votes
## Poll respondents also anti-Prop. 187 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
Both Stanford students in gen
eral and students who are regis
tered California voters lean
strongly towards Democrats in
next week's state elec- ■■mm

tions, according to a poll
conducted by The Daily
from Oct. 31 to Nov. 2.
In the race for gover
nor, students who are reg
istered California voters

favor Democrat Kathleen Brown,
the state treasurer, over Republi
can incumbent Pete Wilson by
about 40 percent, greatly contrast
ing a recent Field Institute poll
looking at voters statewide that
puts Wilson ahead by 9 points.
Registered student voters also
support U.S. Sen. Dianne Fein

than 50 points — over her Repub

ton, a first-term congressman
from Santa Barbara. Feinstein
also leads in the Field poll, but only
by 6 percent.
Campus support for Feinstein
is stronger than it was two years
ago, when a Daily poll showed that
51 percent of students registered
to vote in California supported the

former San Francisco mayor in
her first run for Senate, while
about 13 percent favored Republi
can candidate John Seymour.
The most marked difference be
tween registered California voters
in general and those attending

Stanford, though, is their
stance on the controver
sial Proposition 187,
which seeks to curtail so
cial services — such as
health care and education
— to illegal immigrants.

Though general support for the
proposition has dropped since the
summer, the majority of regis
tered voters still support it, 53 per
cent to 39 percent. At Stanford,
though, voters overwhelmingly
oppose the measure — 78.7 per
cent to 9 percent.
Student opinion is much less
coherent about the 14th congres
sional district seat election, with
more than half of registered stu

race between Democratic incum
bent Anna Eshoo and Republican
Ben Brink, a local businessman.
More than one third of student
voters support Eshoo's campaign
