# Democrats win students' votes
## Poll respondents also anti-Prop. 187 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
Both Stanford students in gen
eral and students who are regis
tered California voters lean
strongly towards Democrats in
next week's state elec- ■■mm

tions, according to a poll
conducted by The Daily
from Oct. 31 to Nov. 2.
In the race for gover
nor, students who are reg
istered California voters

favor Democrat Kathleen Brown,
the state treasurer, over Republi
can incumbent Pete Wilson by
about 40 percent, greatly contrast
ing a recent Field Institute poll
looking at voters statewide that
puts Wilson ahead by 9 points.
Registered student voters also
support U.S. Sen. Dianne Fein
stein by a large margin — more
than 50 points — over her Repub
lican challenger Michael Huffing
ton, a first-term congressman
from Santa Barbara. Feinstein
also leads in the Field poll, but only
by 6 percent.
Campus support for Feinstein
is stronger than it was two years
ago, when a Daily poll showed that
51 percent of students registered
to vote in California supported the

former San Francisco mayor in
her first run for Senate, while
about 13 percent favored Republi
can candidate John Seymour.
The most marked difference be
tween registered California voters
in general and those attending

Stanford, though, is their
stance on the controver
sial Proposition 187,
which seeks to curtail so
cial services — such as
health care and education
— to illegal immigrants.

Though general support for the
proposition has dropped since the
summer, the majority of regis
tered voters still support it, 53 per
cent to 39 percent. At Stanford,
though, voters overwhelmingly
oppose the measure — 78.7 per
cent to 9 percent.
Student opinion is much less
coherent about the 14th congres
sional district seat election, with
more than half of registered stu
dent voters undecided about the
race between Democratic incum
bent Anna Eshoo and Republican
Ben Brink, a local businessman.
More than one third of student
voters support Eshoo's campaign
to represent the district — which


Andrew Martinez-Fonts — Daily

includes Stanford — for a second
term, while only 7.1 percent said
they would vote for Brink.
District-wide polls on the race
have not been consistent.
Eshoo's polls put her ahead 55
percent to 18 percent, while a
Republican poll has Brink
behind by only 8 points.
Trends among Stanford stu

dents in general mirrored those
of students who are registered
California voters, with more
than 50 percent of students
supporting both Brown and
Feinstein and more than 70
percent opposing Proposition
187.
Despite being out of sync with
state feeling, though, Stanford
students are consistent with Bay
Area voters. In the nine-county
Bay Area — which represents
about a quarter of the state's
votes — Brown leads Wilson by

nine points, while Feinstein is
topping HufTington by a three
to-one margin of 66 percent to 22
percent.
Feinstein and Brown also
have leads in Los Angeles Coun
ty, which represents another
quarter of the vote, while their
opponents — and Wilson partic
ularly strongly — are beating
them in Northern California, the
Central Valley and Southern
California outside of Los Angeles
County.
The Daily poll, which was con

ducted 011 Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday nights, has a margin
of error of 5 percent. Of the 732
students total who were polled,
366 are registered to vote in Cal
ifornia.
Thirty-nine percent of the
respondents were women and
61 percent were men, almost
the same proportion as the stu
dent body last year. Under
graduates made up 49.9 per
cent of the polled group, while
graduate students were 50.1
percent.
