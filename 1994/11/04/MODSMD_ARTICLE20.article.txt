India is attempting to exterminate the Sikh religion

1 WOULD LIKE to commend you for
publishing the full-page advertise
ment in the Nov. 1 issue of The Daily
regarding the atrocities being committed
against the Sikhs of India and the relat
ed assassination of Indira Gandhi. I
would also like to refute Sudarshan S.
Chawathe and Venkat Krishnamurthy's
and Navakanta Bhat's allegations that
the advertisement published baseless
facts.
First, I would like to present some
facts of my own. In the Congressional
Record of Sept. 20, 1990, it is stated:
"Since 1984, over 100,000 Sikhs have
been killed by the Indian police." In the
four years after that statement was
made, more than 25,000 Sikhs have
been brutally massacred by the Indian
government.
The simple fact of the matter is that
Amnesty International has recognized
India as one of the worst human rights
violators in the world. According to
Amnesty International policy, the human
rights group seeks the permission of the
government before entering and detailing
human rights violations. Since 1972,
Amnesty has been denied admission by
the Indian government. You have to
wonder what India is hiding.
The answer to this question has been
supplied by Asia Watch, another world
renowned human rights organization.
Asia Watch's findings have recently
forced the United States Congress to cut
aid to India due to its atrocious human

rights violations.
As for the comments made in the Let
ters section of the Nov. 3 issue of The
Daily, they are sadly off the mark. The
simple fact of the matter is that Indira
Gandhi financially and politically sup
ported Sikh freedom fighters for up to
two years before the attack on the Har
minder Sahib (Golden Temple). When
these Sikh freedom fighters wised up and
realized that she was just using them for
her own gain, they turned from her. It is
at this time that Indira Gandhi ordered
the attack on the Harminder Sahib.
If her sole objective was to remove
these freedom fighters from the com
pound of the temple, one has to wonder
why she chose the most holiest day of
the Sikh year. Undoubtedly, Gandhi
knew that tens of thousands of innocent
Sikh children, women, and men would
be making pilgrimages to this sacred
Sikh temple. Why then did Gandhi
choose to remove her own financially
sponsored freedom fighters from the
Harminder Sahib on this day? Further
more, why were 40 other Sikh temples
attacked on the same day when there
was no evidence that they were housing
such freedom fighters?
The answer is that, since the days of
independence, there has been a push by
the Indian government to kill off the
Sikh religion. In the struggle for Indian
independence, the Sikhs made up
greater than 80 percent of those execut
ed or imprisoned. At this time, the

British recognized three separate par
ties: the Sikhs, Hindus, and Muslims.
Britain suggested there be three sepa
rate nations for these individual parties.
At that time, the Sikhs were convinced
to stay with India by promises from
Jawarahal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi
of human rights and Sikh autonomy.
Unfortunately, such promises proved to
be thin air. Upon the writing of the Indi
an constitution, the Sikhs were not rec
ognized as an independent nation but as
a sect of Hinduism. Furthermore, Pun
jabi, a predominantly Sikh language,
was not recognized while numerous
small Hindi dialects were. Imagine going
from the option of having your own
nation to the option of lifelong slavery
under the Hindu majority government
Quite simply, India is a conglomera
tion of several different cultures and lan
guages that cannot be kept together
except through the use of the military,
the current method employed by the
Indian government. The Sikhs of Punjab
are not the only group fighting for their
independence. The southernmost Indian
state of Tamil feels so much hatred
towards the government that Hindi is
not allowed to spoken within the state.
Then there is the state of Jammu and
Kashmir, where massive human rights
violations are also being committed
against a religious minority, the Mus
lims. Slowly but surely, what happened
to the Soviet Union will happen to India.
In fact, in 1990 the Associated Press

published a list of ten states most likely
to become independent nations. Three
on the list were from the Soviet Union
(all three gained independence) and
three were from India: Punjab, Jammu
and Kashmir, and Tamil.
Clearly, when you insult a proud group
like the Sikhs, as Indira Gandhi did on
June 4, 1984, you cannot expect anything
but what she received. I am not condon
ing such actions, but as I am a practicing
Sikh and understand the Sikh mentality,
I can understand why it occurred. So in
actuality, Beant Singh and Satwant
Singh, the freedom fighters involved in
Indira Gandhi's death, were martyrs.
I would like to commend The Daily
for printing such an advertisement and
promoting free speech. While this adver
tisement may not represent the opinions
of all Sikhs, it does correctly state the
facts. Hopefully, it will raise awareness
around campus about the Sikh plight for
independence. Since Oct. 31, 1984, Pun
jab has been under military rule and has
not had full elections. Furthermore,
there is no exercise of human rights
within Punjab. The government has
instated the Terrorist Activities Detain
ment Act solely within Punjab, allowing
the police to hold anyone without cause
and without trial for one whole year.
Finally, it has put a clamp on all media
in and out of Punjab. I ask of you, what
kind of democracy is this?
