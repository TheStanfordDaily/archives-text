Casper is shirking his
duties as President by
not opposing Prop. 187
If you were Gerhard Casper, and an
initiative like Proposition 187 — which
could cost Stanford University approxi
mately $7.5 million annually — was
about to be voted on, would you be con
cerned enough to publicly oppose the
bill on behalf of the University?
The obvious answer is yes, but the
actual answer from President Casper is
no.
One of the requirements of Proposi
tion 187 is that all public health
employees report any "suspected" ille
gal immigrants to Immigration and
Naturalization Services. Employees of
the Stanford Medical Center count as
public health employees because of the
federal and state funds that the Medical
Center receives each year.
If Proposition 187 passes, the federal
matching funds for the Medi-Cal pro
gram would be eliminated because of
violations of federal right-to-privacy
laws arising from health employees
reporting on their patients. This trans
lates, Medical Center sources inform
us, to an approximate annual loss of
$7.5 million to the Medical Center.
So why is Casper silent? Why not
commit University resources to fighting

a law that could cost the University a
significant amount of money? For the
last two years, the University was sub
jected to a harrowing belt-tightening
process of layoffs and administrative
restructuring because of a $40 million
budget deficit. Now are we to believe
that $7.5 million is an insignificant
sum?
I wrote a letter to President Casper
on Oct. 17 explaining this very sce
nario. He replied and explained that as
University President, he could only
publicly support or oppose legislation
that directly impacted upon the Univer
sity's "research or instructional mis
sion." I believe that the passage of
Proposition 187 would directly impact
the University, as the loss of $7.5 mil
lion from the Medical Center would not
only make it more difficult for medical
students to receive the same level of
education, it might threaten the quality
of medical services available to the
entire Stanford community.
The ASSU Senate was concerned
enough about maintaining quality
health care for all students that it
passed a bill urging students to vote
against Proposition 187. Why is Presi
dent Casper not concerned enough to
urge everyone to vote no on 187?
For him to continue to maintain a
passive silence on the issue of Proposi
tion 187 is not only morally wrong, it is
a breach of his duties as University
President to constantly look after the

best interests of the University.

Advertisement ignores
key facts about India's
policies toward Sikhs
This is a response to the reprehensi
ble paid advertisement, "Reflecting On
The Assassination of Indira Gandhi,"
printed in the Nov. 1 issue of The
Stanford Daily. I, for one, have no
qualms with the editors' decision to
run the advertisement, because it
forces us to discuss the issue — some
thing which would not have happened
otherwise.
I trust, however, that other readers
will understand the advertisement's
blatant inaccuracies, allowing them to
arrive at the insipid thrust of the
advertisement — that Gandhi's assas
sination was her own fault.
The advertisers seek to condone vio
lence within the framework of a
democracy, and claim that India is a
"debased" nation. The advertisers
would like us to believe the Indian gov
ernment killed over 100,000 Sikhs and
caused the destruction of Punjab.
Rather than tell your readers that
these are blatant fallacies, I invite
them to visit India or read the newspa

per. They will see that India is a thriv
ing democracy with a burgeoning econ
omy. Punjab has a democratically
elected government and its economy,
after years of stagnation due to terror
ism, is on the rise. Yes, we still have
problems; however, we continue to
tackle them in a democratic and nonvi
olent way.
Furthermore, I would like to point
out the hypocrisy of expatriate Sikhs
who pour money into a terrorist orga
nization that wreaks havoc in their
"homeland," while they sit in Davis,
Calif., removed from the bloodshed
and agony of their people. The adver
tisers — like other sponsors of terror
ist violence — probably have little or
no direct connection to the people or
the land they claim to support.
To set the record straight, here is a
sampling of some of the falsehoods and
misuse of facts that the advertisers
employ in their inflammatory adver
tisement.
The advertisers state, "The assassi
nation of Indira Gandhi was the pre
dictable result of her depraved policies
towards the Sikh nation."
Later, the advertisers quote Mahatma
Gandhi, the most famous proponent of
nonviolence, while concurrently assert
ing that Indira Gandhi had to be killed
because of her "depraved policies."
In a democracy, tyrants are
removed from office at the ballot box,
not gunned down in cold blood. I will

not defend Gandhi because she, like
every other leader, had her flaws.
However, violence and terrorism were
not the solution.
Similarly, the advertisers are adept
at juxtaposing disconnected facts to
create an inaccurate picture of events.
For example, they state that Bhin
dranwale "peacefully demanded" that
the Indian government safeguard its
minorities. Then they add that on
June 3, 1984, the holiest of Sikh holi
days, the Indian army was deployed
throughout the state of Punjab. The
advertisers, therefore, would like you
to believe that all the innocent lives
lost in Punjab were a direct result of
the Indian government.
However, an examination of the
facts they chose to ignore presents a
very different picture. During the peri
od of time between these two events,
there was rampant terrorism waged by
Sikh militants who had taken over
leadership of the Sikh nation. Thou
sands of innocent lives, many of whom
were Sikh, were taken by terrorist
attacks on schools, buses, trains and
airplanes. The Golden Temple, a place
of worship, was used to stockpile
weapons and harbor known terrorists.
The timing of the crackdown on the
Golden Temple may have been ill
advised, but the crackdown itself was
necessary.
