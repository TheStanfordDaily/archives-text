# How The Daily's phone poll was administered
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily poll was
based on telephone interviews
with 732 registered Stanford
undergraduate and graduate
students. Of that number, 366
said they are registered to vote
in California.
Respondents were chosen
at random from a list of stu
dents provided by the Stan
ford Directory. The poll was
conducted by paid interview
ers between the hours of 6
p.m. to 9 p.m. on Oct. 31 to
Nov. 2.
All of the questions have a
margin of error of 5 percent at
a 95 percent confidence level.
In other words, in 19 cases out
of 20, the results of the sample
will differ by no more than 5

percentage points in either
direction from the answers
that would have been obtained
by polling all Stanford stu
dents.
A difference between two
results is statistically signifi
cant only if it is greater than
twice the margin of error.
In other words, if 54 per
cent of the respondents
answered "yea" on a given
question in this poll and 46
percent answered "no," the
difference is not statisically
significant, because with a 5
percent margin of error, the
"yes" answer could be as low
as 49 percent and the "no"
answer could be as high as 51
percent.
