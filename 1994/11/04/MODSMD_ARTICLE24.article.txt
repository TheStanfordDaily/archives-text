## Cardinal to dare Dawgs Match-up akin to a pressure cooker 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Looking for a spicy recipe to liven up a dreary
November weekend? Look no further than the
finest of dining establishments, Stanford Stadi
um, as the Cardinal (2-5-1, 1-4 in the Pacific 10
Conference) takes on the No. 13 Washington
Huskies (6-2, 3-2) Saturday at 3:30 p.m.
For starters, take a pinch of the Huskies' All-
American running back Napoleon Kaufman,
because that's the most contact many defenders
are making against the all-time rushing leader
in Washington history. Kaufman has been elec
tronically timed at 4.31 in the 40-yard dash and
bench-presses 420 pounds.
For complementaiy flavor, add a dash of
Stanford's miniature version of Kaufman, fresh
man running back Anthony Bookman. After tak
ing over the starting reins and becoming the Car
dinal's go-to back, Bookman has averaged over
100 yards a game in Stanford's pass-happy
offense and has even flashed Napoleon-esque
cuts and bursts of speed, although he's still 100
pounds under Kaufman's bench-press mark.
Next, add the hefty beef stock of the
Huskies' tireless offensive line, which averages
293 pounds a man. For a little kick, throw in
Mark Bruener and Ernie Conwell, Washing
ton's talented and powerful tight end duo who
can catch and block with equal precision.
To round out this recipe for excitement, top
off the dish with Stanford's senior quarterback
Steve Stenstrom as he feasts on opposing sec
ondaries en route to becoming the most prolific
passer in school and conference history.
Now, let it simmer for just over three hours
and sit back to watch the fireworks as the top
two scoring offenses in the Pac-10 hook up in a
showdown that means a great deal to each team
but has little consequence outside Palo Alto and
Seattle.

"It's going to take our best defensive effort of
the year to hold down Kaufman," said head
coach Bill Walsh. "At least in this part of the
country, he's the best single player, along with
Steve Stenstrom."
After eight games, Kaufman stands first in
the conference and third in the nation in rush
ing yards per game at 146.8. He has surpassed
the 1,000 yard mark for the third straight year
and is closing in on 4,000 career rushing yards.
Last year against Stanford, Kaufman ran for
195 yards on 24 carries.
"You can't stop him, you just try to contain
him," freshman linebacker Jon Has kins said.
For Stanford, Stenstrom currently holds
down the top spot among quarterbacks in the
Pac-10 and is rated third nationally, averaging
315.4 yards per game. As for his milestones, he
just crossed the 10,000-yard career passing
mark last week against UCLA.
Along with boasting the top two offensive

players on the West Coast, Stanford and Wash
ington have another trait in common. Both
teams are all too aware that as of November 21
and the end of the regular season, their years
are over. While Washington remains saddled
with probation keeping the Huskies from bowl
games this year, Stanford's loss last weekend
mathematically eliminated the Cardinal from
reaching the necessary six-win plateau to
become eligible for post-season play.
"We're not down, we're not in the tank,"
Walsh said. "We've played pretty darn well, and
with a couple of place kicks we'd obviously be
talking about bowl games. We're struggling to
salvage what we am on really a good football
team."
Except for losses to Notre Dame and Ari
zona, the Cardinal is nine points away from
being 6-2 and fighting for a Rose Bowl bid.

In its toughest defensive test, the Cardinal defense aims to hold off the guns of Heisman
candidate Napolean Kaufman and the Washington Huskies tomorrow.
However, an inexperienced defense
compounded by a rash of injuries
has forced Stanford into the role of
spoiler.
A main goal for Stanford this
week will be snapping a 10-game
losing streak to Washington, which
holds a 33-31-4 series advantage.
In the '90s, the Huskies have
outscored the Cardinal 166-44.

"Our shortcomings talent-wise
really hurt us against thus kind of a
team [in recent history|," Walsh
said. "They have balance in every
thing they do, in every position.
They have very good athletes, so
there isn't a flaw in anything they
do. This year, it's probably as close
as we can get. This is the year we
can give a run at it."
Despite the flashy offensive
numbers of Kaufman and the
emergence of quarterback Damon
Huard, this year's Washington
squad prides itself on the strong

tradition of defense. Bringing in a
stable of fleet, hard-hitting
linebackers and a speedy sec
ondary, Washington has gone back
to the attacking style of defense
which propelled them to a national
championship three years ago.
Besides a wealth of talented
players on both sides of the ball,
Washington has benefited from
going through the season injury
free. The Huskies have suffered no
season-ending injuries to key play
ers and have had minimal day-to
day injuries, giving their starting

lineups remarkable consistency.
Head coach Jim Lam bright con
tributes much of this success to the
rigorous preseason practices which
established a very well-conditioned
team.
Consistency is one thing the
Cardinal defense looked for all
year. Switching players from
offense to defense and shuffling the
lineups due to injuries, Stanford
has started 22 different defensive
players this season, including five
freshmen.
"I'laving freshmen is not cham

pionship football," Walsh said.
"But we had a couple of very aver
age years recruiting, which haven't
produced outstanding players. Our
freshmen are often our best ath
letes, but the stress can consume
them because they have so much to
think about — it's so different
from high school."
For Stanford, this week of prac
tice did offer some hope for the last
three games, as several injured
players returned to the Held for the
Cardinal. Junior defensive end
Fete Swanson is back from a knee

injury which forced him to miss
five games, and sophomore
linebacker Brian Batson should see
spot duty after recovering from a
broken fibula.
Sophomore cornerback Eliel
Swinton has also jumped from the
training room to the field after
overcoming both a quadricep
injury and the death of his fiancee
three weeks ago. He should see
action as both a safety and corner
back in the Cardinal's base and
nickel defenses, according to
Walsh.
