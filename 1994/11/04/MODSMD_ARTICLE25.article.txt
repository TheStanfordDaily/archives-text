# Nostra Demas
## Reagan Demas and the Tree lumber over the week's picks 
### 
It became clear immediately
after Stanford University
changed its mascot to the Cardi
nal that there were going to be
some problems representing a
blob of a reddish tint in an elabo
rate sports mascot outfit.
In its place grew The Tree, a
happy-go-lucky stump played
today by soph more Ari Mervis.
His meaningfulness is dubious
and we are bombarded with
countless questions concerning
the correlation between timber
and the color red. Nevertheless,
we continue to support his lum
bered existence.
My prediction rating seems to
be improving — perhaps my bur
geoning luck will continue as I
pick this week's games with The
Tree (knock on wood):
Washington at Stanford
I just can't go wrong this time.
I know I've said that before, but
I've got a feeling that even a Cal
graduate could pick this game cor
rectly. Well, maybe that's stretch
ing it, but Washington's annihi
lating offensive power should dev
astate the Cardinal (and work the
scoreboard keeper into a sweat by
the fourth quarter).
The tree clearly has no sap —
he picks Stanford over an obvi

ously more talented Husky pack
by more points than the Cardinal
might score all day.
"Washington looks tough, but
how could I ever pick against
Stanford?" he asked rhetorically.
I've got a pretty satisfying
answer — the Huskies held
UCLA to 10 points earlier this
year, while the Cardinal defense
allowed the Bruins to tally 31
points last week. Stanford's pow
erful offense will have to perform
three times to scale (which
means scoring around 90 points)
to keep up with those stats. Good
luck, guys. We're with you 100
percent.

USC at Washington State
Everybody say good-bye in uni
son to USC's chances at the Rose
Bowl. They were nice but short
lived. The Tree thinks Wazzu's
defense "will come through," and
you don't have to be a wise old
Sequoia to get that feeling.
WSU's God-ordained defense
is set to put a cork in the Trojan
offensive machine that ran off 61
points two weeks ago against Cal.
The key phrase there is "against


Reagan
Demas


The
Tree
Cal," and the key phrase for USC
for this weekend's game is "Pull
man, Washington." The Trojans
don't have their wealthy alumni and
snobby student h<xly (most of which
has starred in at least one Dockers
commercial) to cheer them on.

Arizona State at Oregon
Read my beak: start thinking of
ways now to justify the legit imacy of
the Pac-10 as a top conference alter
the Ducks lay their golden egg and
nab the right to be dismembered in
the Rose Bowl by Penn State. It's a
tough swallow, but the Sun Devils
won't condemn Oregon to hell this
weekend — especially not in Eugene,
when' the Ducks have transformed
their home field from a nitty roost
ink) a protected bird sanctuary.
The Tree wouldn't mind seeing
Oregon represent the conference
in the big bowl, either. "It (would
Ik'| nice to see a team that doesn't

pay its players get to the Rose
Bowl," he said.

Texas A&M at Texas
An old-fashioned Texas shoot
out. Unfortunately for Texas, the
Aggies have a quicker draw and a
llawless record. The Longhorns
ain't expect to corral A&M just
because the game is in Austin. They
couldn't even saddle up Rice two
weeks ago, and the Aggies look like
Wyatt Harp next to the wimpy ( Kvls.
The Tree disagrees.
"A&M looked poor against
SMU last week," he said. "II a
team on probation like that can
[stay with | them — go
Longhorns."

Miami at Syracuse
The likely Orange Bowl-bound 1 lur
ricanes face their last real competi
tion of the year in the Orange(men),
but it won't turn out to be the close
game that it should Ik\
"I do like the Syracuse mascot,"
the Tree said. "But Miami's got the

better team.
If mascots determined the sue
cess of a football team the Missouri
Cavalry Bible College Warriors
would be one of the best teams in
the country and the Stanford Car
dinal would be one of the worst. As
it is, only one of those classifica
tions is correct.
The I ree: Miami by 3
Ileagan: Miami by 12
Cal at Arizona
It's homecoming for the Wild
cats. Everybody's welcome in Tuc
son, except for the Golden Bears.
They're welcome to endure a
senseless pummeling for the sec
ond time in three weeks. The Tree
points out that Cal is set to start a
quarterback that hasn't seen the
light of a game day in college foot
ball. Their 61-0 loss to USC last
month is going to be remembered
as a mild scolding compared to
what might unfold this weekend.
