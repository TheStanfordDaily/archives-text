# Nostra Demas
## Reagan Demas and the Tree lumber over the week's picks 
### 
It became clear immediately
after Stanford University
changed its mascot to the Cardi
nal that there were going to be
some problems representing a
blob of a reddish tint in an elabo
rate sports mascot outfit.
In its place grew The Tree, a
happy-go-lucky stump played
today by soph more Ari Mervis.
His meaningfulness is dubious
and we are bombarded with
countless questions concerning
the correlation between timber
and the color red. Nevertheless,
we continue to support his lum
bered existence.
My prediction rating seems to
be improving — perhaps my bur
geoning luck will continue as I
pick this week's games with The
Tree (knock on wood):
Washington at Stanford
I just can't go wrong this time.
I know I've said that before, but
I've got a feeling that even a Cal
graduate could pick this game cor
rectly. Well, maybe that's stretch
ing it, but Washington's annihi
lating offensive power should dev
astate the Cardinal (and work the
scoreboard keeper into a sweat by
the fourth quarter).
The tree clearly has no sap —
he picks Stanford over an obvi

ously more talented Husky pack
by more points than the Cardinal
might score all day.
"Washington looks tough, but
how could I ever pick against
Stanford?" he asked rhetorically.
I've got a pretty satisfying
answer — the Huskies held
UCLA to 10 points earlier this
year, while the Cardinal defense
allowed the Bruins to tally 31
points last week. Stanford's pow
erful offense will have to perform
three times to scale (which
means scoring around 90 points)
to keep up with those stats. Good
luck, guys. We're with you 100
percent.
The Tree: Stanford by 11
Reagan: Washington by 13
USC at Washington State
Everybody say good-bye in uni
son to USC's chances at the Rose
Bowl. They were nice but short
lived. The Tree thinks Wazzu's
defense "will come through," and
you don't have to be a wise old
Sequoia to get that feeling.
WSU's God-ordained defense
is set to put a cork in the Trojan
offensive machine that ran off 61
points two weeks ago against Cal.
The key phrase there is "against
