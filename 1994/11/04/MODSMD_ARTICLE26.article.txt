"It was one of those games
where you want to get it over with,
get a victory and get out of town."
That's how Stanford men's
water polo coach Dante Detta
manti described his team's
matchup with No. 5 University of
the Pacific yesterday. The top
ranked Cardinal barely escaped
from Stockton with a 10-8 tri
umph.
"We struggled in the first half,"

Dettamanti said. "I was really
afraid of that. We play Cal Satur
day and we may have been looking
ahead."'

The Cardinal (18-1) came out
flat and fell behind early. Detta

Junior Dan Hancock's fourth-quarter goal granted the water polo
squad another win in its reach for the NCAA championship.
manti attributed the slow start to
shaky defense and overconfidence.
Stanford defeated Pacific 14-3 in
the teams' first meeting two
weeks ago.
"We were not ready to play,"
Dettamanti said. "We weren't
playing good defense — they got
some really easy shots. At the
same time, we were taking some

ill-advised shots."
"It was tough to get up for
those guys," junior Jeremy Laster
said. "We had the long bus ride,
and then they had a huge crowd. It
was a hostile environment."
Although the Cardinal sput
tered out of the gates, the defend
ing NCAA champions were able to
turn the game around in the sec
ond half.
"Two things really saved us —
we drew three penalty shots
(scored by senior Wolf Wigo) and
Dan Hancock scored a couple of
critical goals," Dettamanti said.

"ln the second half, we started
playing better and we tightened
up our defense."
"Dan came up huge at the end
of the game," Laster said. "He got
open on the counter-attack and he
put the shots away."
Wigo, the team's leading scorer,
was happy to get the win and
impressed by the Tigers' grit.
"It was pretty unbelievable,"
Wigo said. "You don't beat teams
worse than 14-3. You just don't
get more of a beating than that.
For them to turn it around and be
leading going into the fourth quar

ter — I've got to give them a lot of
credit."
Dettamanti was pleased to see
his team, which has been rarely
tested this season, pull together in
a tight game.
"This will show us that we am
be beat if we're not playing our
best," Dettamanti said. "But we
got the win and learned a lesson
we have to play our best against
everyone. This was a tough game
and the guys responded. We did
what we had to do to win."
The Cardinal will be primed
and ready to play its best Satur

day, when No. 3 California comes
to deGuerre Pool for a noon
matchup.
Although the Golden Bears (17-
6) have struggled at times, they
are the only team to best the Car
dinal this year, a feat they accom
plished by a 12-11 margin in an
overtime match.
In that game, Cal played a tight
defense which caught the Cardinal
off-guard.
"They pressed hard and fouled
us everywhere," Wigo said. "We
hadn't run into that type of
defense and weren't ready for it."

This time around, the Cardinal
will be ready for any defense as it
looks to revenge the only blemish on
its otherwise perfect season record.
Wigo and fellow senior captain
Frank Schneider will have a bit of
extra incentive to beat the Bears,
as the game will mark their final
appearance at deGuerre Pool.
Both Cardinal standouts have
been mainstays in Dettamanti's
lineup since their freshman year.
"It would be nice to have a good
game," Wigo said. "I think every
one is going to be pretty pumped
up."
