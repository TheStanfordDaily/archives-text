# Kicking off against Washington

The postseason may be just around the corner, but
it's the furthest thing from the minds of the Stanford
women's soccer team.
"I'm not even thinking about Sunday's game yet,"
said junior midfielder Carmel Murphy. "I'm thinking
about Friday's. I try not to think too far ahead."
Murphy and the Cardinal have to take care of some
unfinished business from the regular season before
entertaining visions of the postseason. Pacific 10 Con
ference foe Washington (11-5-1) awaits at 3 p.m. Fri
day, and Washington State (11-4-1) closes out the reg
ular campaign at 11 a.m. Sunday morning.
Both the No. 14 Huskies and the Cougars have
playoff aspirations also. With a win over Stanford (14-
1-1), the NCAA selection committee would have diffi
culty overlooking either team when filling out the six
team West Region bracket.
The Huskies are aiming for their first-ever bid to
the tournament. After the most successful season in
school history in 1993, Washington has stepped its
play up a notch. However, losses in their last four
games against ranked opponents leave the Huskies in
need of a big win.

The Washington offense has posted just over two
goals per game in 1994, good for seventh in the West
Region. Sophomore midfielder Sainantha Obara paces
a relatively balanced attack with nine goals and two
assists on the season. Junior forwards Emily Thomp
son and Kathleen Juergens have recorded seven and
five goals, respectively, and four assists apiece.
However, Washington's defense is its primary
strength. Sophomore goalkeeper Tina Thompson's
0.856 goals-against average ranks fourth in the
region, and she has posted three shutouts.
Stanford head coach lan Sawyers believes that
Washington's unusual defensive scheme will present
a challenge for the Cardinal.
"They're playing with a slightly different system, a
flat back four," Sawyers said. "They could change it,
but the scouting report is that they're playing without
a designated sweeper, which is how the men's World
Cup teams were playing. Hopefully, we can get a good
feel for that."
Washington State presents no such defensive gim
micks, but with the top-ranked goalkeeper in the
nation, the Cougars could still mount a sizable chal
lenge. Senior Kris Young has posted eight shutouts in
