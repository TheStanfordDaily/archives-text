# Kicking off against Washington
## 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
The postseason may be just around the corner, but
it's the furthest thing from the minds of the Stanford
women's soccer team.
"I'm not even thinking about Sunday's game yet,"
said junior midfielder Carmel Murphy. "I'm thinking
about Friday's. I try not to think too far ahead."
Murphy and the Cardinal have to take care of some
unfinished business from the regular season before
entertaining visions of the postseason. Pacific 10 Con
ference foe Washington (11-5-1) awaits at 3 p.m. Fri
day, and Washington State (11-4-1) closes out the reg
ular campaign at 11 a.m. Sunday morning.
Both the No. 14 Huskies and the Cougars have
playoff aspirations also. With a win over Stanford (14-
1-1), the NCAA selection committee would have diffi
culty overlooking either team when filling out the six
team West Region bracket.
The Huskies are aiming for their first-ever bid to
the tournament. After the most successful season in
school history in 1993, Washington has stepped its
play up a notch. However, losses in their last four
games against ranked opponents leave the Huskies in
need of a big win.

The Washington offense has posted just over two
goals per game in 1994, good for seventh in the West
Region. Sophomore midfielder Sainantha Obara paces
a relatively balanced attack with nine goals and two
assists on the season. Junior forwards Emily Thomp
son and Kathleen Juergens have recorded seven and
five goals, respectively, and four assists apiece.
However, Washington's defense is its primary
strength. Sophomore goalkeeper Tina Thompson's
0.856 goals-against average ranks fourth in the
region, and she has posted three shutouts.
Stanford head coach lan Sawyers believes that
Washington's unusual defensive scheme will present
a challenge for the Cardinal.
"They're playing with a slightly different system, a
flat back four," Sawyers said. "They could change it,
but the scouting report is that they're playing without
a designated sweeper, which is how the men's World
Cup teams were playing. Hopefully, we can get a good
feel for that."
Washington State presents no such defensive gim
micks, but with the top-ranked goalkeeper in the
nation, the Cougars could still mount a sizable chal
lenge. Senior Kris Young has posted eight shutouts in
10 starts in 1994, with a minuscule
0.190 GAA. After blanking three
opponents last week, Young was
selected to the Soccer America
National Women's Team of the
Week. Young and the WSU defense
pose perhaps the higgest challenge
all year for an occasionally stagnant
Cardinal offense.
"They're a very feisty team and
very good defensively," Sawyers
said. "We don't want to change lour
approach) much. Once we get things
rolling, I'm very confident our team
am score goals."
Stanford's scoring troubles pale
in comparison with Washington
State's. The Cougars rank 17th of
27 teams in the West Region in scor
ing, with 1.56 goals per contest.
Sophomore Tari Beck leads the
squad with six goals on the season,
but the team as a whole has scored
more than twice in a game only once
in 1994.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal is
coming off one of its most impres

sive outings of the season, a 6-0
thrashing of UC-Santa Barbara.
Sophomore forward Erin Martin,
who set a school record with four
goals against the Gauchos, joined
Young on the National Team of
the Week. Martin's 14 goals on
the season place her fifth in the
west.
Assistant coach Sarah Rafanelli
believes the outburst against the
Gauchos b<x)sted the team's morale
in light, of its recent scoring struggles.
"Our forwards just went crazy in
that game and killed UCSB them
selves," Rafanelli said. "I think that
fills the rest of the team with a lot of
confidence. 1 lopefully, that will serve
to get us out of this rut we've been
in."
Sawyers also hopes that the
UCSB game has turned the team in
the right direction.
"It's good to get momentum
going into these two games, and then
hopefully the postseason," he said.
The Cardinal will definitely neixl
that momentum in the upcoming
weeks. But as for this weekend,
Stanford will work to keep its con
centration dead set on finishing off
its Washington challengers.
