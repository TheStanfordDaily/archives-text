Stanford men's soccer host
ed San Jose State yesterday on
Maloney field, but the guests
took over the house. The
bleachers were filled with more
Spartan than Stanford fans,
and the scoreboard was filled
with more Spartan goals than
Stanford goals.
The Cardinal (4-12-2) lost 3-
0 in a disappointing end to
Mountain Division play. San
Jose (14-4-0) defeated the lack
luster Stanford squad by main
taining possession of the ball
for most of the game and capi
talizing on scoring opportuni
ties.
On the times when Stanford
managed to work the ball
upfield into scoring position
the team was usually out
manned. On the other hand,
the Spartans routinely had
three or more players swarm
ing on the Cardinal goal.
"We had technical and tacti
cal breakdowns," said head
coach Colin Lindores. "We cre
ate scoring opportunities, but

we can't score. AJso, the num
ber of turnovers in the midfield
was horrendous. The players
have got to be more critical of
where the ball goes."
Indeed, the Cardinal did not
seem able to push the ball past
the midfield in any consistent
or strategic manner. A few
times Cardinal midfielders
would beat four or five Spartan
defenders, only to cross the ball
to where there were no other
Stanford players.
Stanford's frustration over
its technical difficulties, and
the weight of its poor record,
produced a tense and physical
match. One scuffle in the first
half almost escalated into a
fight.
"Sure they battle and try out
there," Lindores said, "but not
with the attitude that they can
win."
The Cardinal has been
dogged by the lack of a winning
drive or attitude for most of the
year. After a season of unful
filled expectations, Stanford
cannot seem to shake the stig
ma of losing, despite its obvious
talent.
"It's disappointing," senior
defender Jeff Kogl said. "With
the season coming to a close,
this is really tough to swallow.
In this game, we just had no
heart. We played like we didn't
