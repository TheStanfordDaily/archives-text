# No. 1 volleyball travels to UCLA, USC empires
## 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
Just as Luke Skywalker flew
his X-wing fighter into the heart
of the Death Star, so will the No.
1 Stanford women's volleyball
team face adversity in the home of
another empire when it takes on
fourth-ranked UCLA (22-3, 11-2
in the Pacific 10 Conference)
tonight and No. 13 USC (15-5, 9-
4) Saturday evening.
However, that is where the
analogy ends. While the Bruins
have what is historically the most
visible women's collegiate volley
ball program in the nation, the
Cardinal is no Rebel Alliance this
year.
Stanford is the proud owner
of an undefeated 20-0 record
and holds down first place in
the Pac-10 with a 12-0 mark. A
well-prepared Cardinal squad,
bolstered by the return of
freshman setter Lisa Sharpley
after an ankle injury last week
end, may give UCLA a chal
lenge that the Bruins' nearly
imperial status is not equipped
to deal with.
"We are really excited to go
down there and play," said senior
captain Anne Wicks. "People are
getting themselves mentally
ready for some really tough
matches."
These trips to the south are
always the subject of much antici
pation. Bouts between Stanford
and the Los Angeles schools, tra
ditional Pac-10 and national pow
ers, are not to be taken lightly. As
a result, the outcomes, whether
good or bad, involve much emo

tion.
"We have mixed feelings about
going to L.A.," Wicks said. "It
brings up memories of our great
est moments, but also some of our
most heart-breaking losses."
This year, the Cardinal has
reason to enter these matches in
good cheer. When the Bruins and
Trojans came north to Maples
Pavilion earlier in the season,
Stanford posted a convincing
three-game win over USC in an
offensive battle and dealt a four
game loss to UCLA in a defensive
affair over a weekend which reaf
firmed the Cardinal's lofty rank
ing.
The L.A. teams have also
struggled of late. No. 22 Washing
ton State swept the Trojans last
Saturday night. On the same
evening, unranked Washington
pulled out its first win ever
against the Bruins in a five-game
match. Some Stanford players
were not surprised by these devel
opments.
"It was a matter of when it
would happen, not if it would hap
pen," Wicks said. "They [UCLAI
had gone five games a few times
this year and the rally-scoring
system narrows the difference
between the favorite and the
underdog."
When a match goes to a fifth
and deciding game, every rally
produces a point. If a team wins a
rally, it scores regardless of
whether it controlled the serve or
not. This scoring method is often
said to create a crap-shoot where a
less talented team that gets on a
hot streak or gets lucky can steal a

game and a match away from a
better squad.
The UCI.A loss did not shock
Stanford head coach Don Shaw
either. According to Shaw, the con
ference's overall strength makes it
impossible to predict what will
happen.
"I'm not surprised by anything
that happens in the Pac-10," he
said. "Every match is a tough one.
There are no breathers."
In contrast, Nebraska, the
nation's only other undefeated
squad, hits minimal in-conference
competition. The only ranked
team in the Big Eight besides the
Cornhuskers is No. 14 Colorado.
In the long run, Stanford's gru
eling conference schedule will be
both a plus and a minus against a
team like Nebraska.
"It means we're better used to
dealing with tough competition,"
Shaw said. "But it also means we
can get worn down quicker over
the course of the season."
