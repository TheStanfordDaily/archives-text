## Alleged vandals' hearing delayed 
### Justin Pollard Staff writer 
Four of the Stanford student s accused of vandaliz
ingthe "Gay Liberation" sculpture last May had their
fates postponed one more time yesterday.
Senior Mark Butterfield, former student Brian
Dallimore, junior Robert Gardner and junior Jason
White have all been charged with misdemeanor
counts of vandalism in the case.
The accused students have yet to enter pleas in the
case, which is still in the preliminary hearing stage.
The four athletes were expected to enter pleas
today, however the students' attorneys requested and
were granted one last postponement.
The continuance was requested because one of the
students, Robert Gardner, is in Nevada and could not
be reached by his attorney to enter a plea on the case,
said Robert Burmeister, the attorney for Jason
White.
Deputy District Attorney Diane Doolittle argued that
a continuance should not be granted because the pre
liminary hearing had already been postponed six times.
Judge Douglas K. Southard, however, granted the
continuance because of the unusual circumstances
surrounding the case. Southard set the date for a final
preliminary hearing for November 23. On that date,
the alleged vandals will have to either settle or set a
date for their trial, he said.
A California state mandate states that 99 percent
of all cases be arraigned within 90 days, Southard
said, adding that with the additional delay, this case
will be one of the small minority which fail to meet
that deadline.
