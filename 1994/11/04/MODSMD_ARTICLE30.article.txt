# Ice hockey meets rival ASU
## 
### Allison Otto Contributing writer 
This weekend promises to be fast and furious
as the Stanford ice hockey club team takes to the
ice for a double header against one of its fore
most rivals, Arizona State.
The team's first game begins at 6:45 tonight
and is followed by a second contest on Saturday
at 2:45 p.m. at the Ice Oasis in Redwood City.
"I think it's going to be pretty exciting. It's
going to be a tight, close game," said senior team
co-captain Luke Winter. "Usually they come at
us with a very strong team."
Coach Ernie Ferrari added that developing a
checking line, using power plays and penalty
killing to the team's advantage, and matching
Stanford's stronger lines against the weaker
lines of ASU will be keys in defeating the Sun
Devils.
"I'm really looking forward to the games this
weekend," Ferrari said. "I'm very pleased with
the way the team has progressed. . .after this
weekend we'll know a lot more about our team."
Stanford's strength is partly due to the
force of its second line of forwards. "That's a
powerhouse line," said freshman defenseman

Matt Blythe. "Whenever you're in front of
your home fans you tend to play more aggres
sively."
Winter agreed with Blythe that the Cardinal
will need to step up and play tough hockey in
order to get past ASU. "Shawn Morrison [a sec
ond line forward) said to me in the locker room
the other day, 'It doesn't matter who we play. We
can hurt them ' He's right. He's absolutely
right," he said.
According to Winter, Stanford's strategy for
the upcoming games is to "methodically attack"
using the strength and abilities of the team to
defeat ASU. "The standout thing about this
team is the quality of the whole roster," he said,
adding that both the forwards and the defense
were solid.
Blythe ranks as one of the team's strongest
defenseman, according to Winter. "He's an excit
ing player. He hits. He's aggressive," he said.
When Stanford takes to the ice this weekend,
it can expect a physical contest, and a challenge,
to be sure.
"We need to take our game to the next level to
play any of the Arizona teams," Blythe said. "I
think it's a really important game, but it should
be close."
