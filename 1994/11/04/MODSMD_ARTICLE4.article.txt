# 'Like Melrose'...
## Future of SCBN remains unclear 
### Carol Riegelman 
After only two years of existence,
the Stanford Cardinal Broadcasting
Network is gearing up for harder
times as its three founders prepare to
graduate.
Seniors Matt Kulikowski, Mark Li
pawen and Walt Williamson, who are
the founding fathers of Stanford's
only student-run television network,
will be leaving their brainchild to fend
for itself after this spring.

Led by these graduating seniors, SCBN has already
had to face student denial of its ASSU special-fee for the
last two years and the chronic problem of low student
interest in programming.
But current SCBN staffers said they woriy that after
the seniors leave, there mav not, be a driving force to


Kulikowski
carry the station strongly into the
future.
The founders say the station has
provided the campus with the
unique opj>ortuiiity to get involved
with the broadcasting world. But
despite the hard work, SCBN is still
struggling to get off the ground.
The station is in need of facilities,
money and enthusiastic leaders.
"Stanford needs to wake up to
the fact that television is the most
powerful medium in today's
world," said Kulikowski, the for
mer station manager. He added he
feels the station is on the right
track, but has a long way to go.
Without a studio, SCBN is
forced to do all of its shooting on
location, which can be extremely
time-consuming and difficult.
Although the station receives a spe

cial fee from the ASSU, the money
does not cover ail the expenses
needed to run a television station,
Kulikowski said.
But more than anything, the
station needs motivated students
willing to "take the baton to carry
SCBN through the next four
years," he said.
Thttstation is looking for people
willing to take over the leadership
of the station and fill the shoes of
the graduating seniors, but they
need the support of the student
body, said sophomore Eric Gavidia,
the new events director.
"At this particular moment,
there is not enough involvement to
make it really, really big," he said,
although he added he feels that it is
still too early to tell if the level of
interest is high enough.
SCBN has an enormous vision
of the future, including more cre
ative and original programming,
the formation of a news division,
branching out to local communi

ties, and eventually even becoming
independent of the University,
Kulikowski said.
But in terms of working to
achieve this grand vision, SCBN is
taking small steps to recruit, train
and explore other funding
resources. Station members adver
tise on the air, in The Daily and on
fliers around campus, Gavidia said,
but the most they can do is try to
make a good presentation of them
selves.
SCBN is looking and working
toward the future, but the leaders
of the station may differ in their
goals. Gavidia said he would like
SCBN to cater to the tastes of the
typical Stanford student.
In Gavidia's ideal, students
would rush to watch SCBN pro
grams, saying " 'oh, I've got to
watch it tonight' — like Melrose
Place," he said.
But Mark Lipawen, the produc
er of the new mystery / drama
series coming out this year, said he

is in it for his own experience. Of
his show "Three Minutes 'til Mid
night," he said "if nobody watches,
I don't care."
SCBN is hoping to get its own
studio next year from the Office of
Student Activities, which would
provide a location for sets and film
ing, Kulikowski said. The studio
would also serve as offices for
administrative work, which right
now is done from dorm rooms.
Those involved said they have high
hopes for what the studio could do
for SCBN.
However, staffers said what the
station really needs are students
with a lot of interest. SCBN can
provide the training and the experi
ence, but Kulikowski said that the
station is looking for dedicated peo
ple willing to "carry out the vision
that Mark, Walt and I have into the
future."
Gavidia described the kind of
people they need as those who are
going to give their all to SCBN, not

work solely for their own benefit
and "leave with so much experi
ence, knowledge, and love for tele
vision and what goes on behind
television," he said.
Kulikowski said he believes that
because television is so influential,
it comes with big responsibilities.
"We have the right minds on cam
pus" to be a part of the future of
TV, but more of the community
needs to take advantage of the
opportunities provided through
SCBN, he said.
He added that the events
department — which covers
everything from Spike Lee to dorm
musicals — has a lot to offer all stu
dent groups if they realize that the
resource is available to them.
As a creative outlet for whoever
chooses to take advantage of it,
SCBN is a place to display the
immense talent at Stanford,
Gavidia said.
"Creativity ... is at the heart of
successful television," Kulikowski

said, adding he is looking to put
good minds together with
resources to produce dynamite
shows.
But staffers still worry that the
station does not get enough atten
tion. "A lot of people think there's
no reason to" watch a campus tele
vision station, said junior Kathy
Lipscomb, "co-director of "Three
Minutes 'til Midnight."
Staffers' concerns about stu
dent apathy seem to be true. Fresh
man Joe Street, for example, said
he has not yet heard about the sta
tion, and junior Jane Shaw said she
would watch it — if she could fig
ure out where to find the station on
television.
"1 really hope that this station
lasts because it gives students an
opportunity to be creative" Lip
scomb said.
But she added she is enthusias
tic about the show and the station
because, she said. "How often do
you get to direct a show for TV?"

Thttstation is looking for people
willing to take over the leadership
of the station and fill the shoes of
the graduating seniors, but they
need the support of the student
body, said sophomore Eric Gavidia,
the new events director.
"At this particular moment,
there is not enough involvement to
make it really, really big," he said,
although he added he feels that it is
still too early to tell if the level of
interest is high enough.
SCBN has an enormous vision
of the future, including more cre
ative and original programming,
the formation of a news division,
branching out to local communi

ties, and eventually even becoming
independent of the University,
Kulikowski said.
But in terms of working to
achieve this grand vision, SCBN is
taking small steps to recruit, train
and explore other funding
resources. Station members adver
tise on the air, in The Daily and on
fliers around campus, Gavidia said,
but the most they can do is try to
make a good presentation of them
selves.
SCBN is looking and working
toward the future, but the leaders
of the station may differ in their
goals. Gavidia said he would like
SCBN to cater to the tastes of the
typical Stanford student.
In Gavidia's ideal, students
would rush to watch SCBN pro
grams, saying " 'oh, I've got to
watch it tonight' — like Melrose
Place," he said.
But Mark Lipawen, the produc
er of the new mystery / drama
series coming out this year, said he

is in it for his own experience. Of
his show "Three Minutes 'til Mid
night," he said "if nobody watches,
I don't care."
SCBN is hoping to get its own
studio next year from the Office of
Student Activities, which would
provide a location for sets and film
ing, Kulikowski said. The studio
would also serve as offices for
administrative work, which right
now is done from dorm rooms.
Those involved said they have high
hopes for what the studio could do
for SCBN.
However, staffers said what the
station really needs are students
with a lot of interest. SCBN can
provide the training and the experi
ence, but Kulikowski said that the
station is looking for dedicated peo
ple willing to "carry out the vision
that Mark, Walt and I have into the
future."
Gavidia described the kind of
people they need as those who are
going to give their all to SCBN, not

work solely for their own benefit
and "leave with so much experi
ence, knowledge, and love for tele
vision and what goes on behind
television," he said.
Kulikowski said he believes that
because television is so influential,
it comes with big responsibilities.
"We have the right minds on cam
pus" to be a part of the future of
TV, but more of the community
needs to take advantage of the
opportunities provided through
SCBN, he said.
He added that the events
department — which covers
everything from Spike Lee to dorm
musicals — has a lot to offer all stu
dent groups if they realize that the
resource is available to them.
As a creative outlet for whoever
chooses to take advantage of it,
SCBN is a place to display the
immense talent at Stanford,
Gavidia said.
"Creativity ... is at the heart of
successful television," Kulikowski

said, adding he is looking to put
good minds together with
resources to produce dynamite
shows.
But staffers still worry that the
station does not get enough atten
tion. "A lot of people think there's
no reason to" watch a campus tele
vision station, said junior Kathy
Lipscomb, "co-director of "Three
Minutes 'til Midnight."
Staffers' concerns about stu
dent apathy seem to be true. Fresh
man Joe Street, for example, said
he has not yet heard about the sta
tion, and junior Jane Shaw said she
would watch it — if she could fig
ure out where to find the station on
television.
"1 really hope that this station
lasts because it gives students an
opportunity to be creative" Lip
scomb said.
But she added she is enthusias
tic about the show and the station
because, she said. "How often do
you get to direct a show for TV?"
After only two years of existence,
the Stanford Cardinal Broadcasting
Network is gearing up for harder
times as its three founders prepare to
graduate.
Seniors Matt Kulikowski, Mark Li
pawen and Walt Williamson, who are
the founding fathers of Stanford's
only student-run television network,
will be leaving their brainchild to fend
for itself after this spring.

Led by these graduating seniors, SCBN has already
had to face student denial of its ASSU special-fee for the
last two years and the chronic problem of low student
interest in programming.
But current SCBN staffers said they woriy that after
the seniors leave, there mav not, be a driving force to


Kulikowski
carry the station strongly into the
future.
The founders say the station has
provided the campus with the
unique opj>ortuiiity to get involved
with the broadcasting world. But
despite the hard work, SCBN is still
struggling to get off the ground.
The station is in need of facilities,
money and enthusiastic leaders.
"Stanford needs to wake up to
the fact that television is the most
powerful medium in today's
world," said Kulikowski, the for
mer station manager. He added he
feels the station is on the right
track, but has a long way to go.
Without a studio, SCBN is
forced to do all of its shooting on
location, which can be extremely
time-consuming and difficult.
Although the station receives a spe

cial fee from the ASSU, the money
does not cover ail the expenses
needed to run a television station,
Kulikowski said.
But more than anything, the
station needs motivated students
willing to "take the baton to carry
SCBN through the next four
years," he said.
Thttstation is looking for people
willing to take over the leadership
of the station and fill the shoes of
the graduating seniors, but they
need the support of the student
