# Tresidder overhaul may include Credit Union
## 
### Frank Guinan Michael Slemmer Staff writers 
Stanford Federal Credit Union may move its
branch office to Tresidder Union as part of an adviso
ry board's strategy to revitalize the student union.
The advisory board studying Tresidder's opera
tions has already met to discuss Stanford Manage
ment Company's preliminary plans in its recent
takeover of Tresidder's retail services. The board,
which includes faculty, staff and students, will meet
again in January.
"There were a lot of things put on the table" at the
meeting, said ASSU Council of Presidents member
Anietie Ekanem, who serves on the advisory board.
The group, however, has not decided on other changes
aside from the credit union move.
A smaller group within the board — composed

mostly of students — is working with
Dean of Students Michael Jackson to
outline the board's overall form and
shape.
The students will work to "define
exactly what | the board's] role will
be," Ekanem said, adding that it also
will consider the reporting structure
and makeup of the larger board.
According to Jackson, the stu
dents in the group were selected last

year by the ASSU to serve on the old Tresidder Union
board. The new advisory board has "absorbed the
ASSU nominations," he said.
This past summer, Jackson announced that Stan
ford Management Company, which already adminis
ters the Stanford Shopping Center, would take over
operation of Tresidder this year. The move is expected
to save the University around $700,000 in subsidies

over the next three years.
Stanford Management Company is not scheduled
to make any concrete changes to Tresidder until win
ter quarter, according to Dorothea Gregowski, assis
tant director of the Shopping Center. The company is
now meeting weekly with representatives from the
merchants' association which runs Tresidder's retail
services, she said.
A marketing survey ia due out Boon in hopes of
"ganging student interests" in the service l ' TYesldder
provides, Gregowski said.
The board's first meeting two weeks ago focused on
the takeover and helped prepare members for the task
at hand, Jackson said.
Because this first year has been set aside for defin
ing what Jackson calls Tresidder's "new mission," he
said the student group's role will be important to the


Jackson
future of the student union.
"Tresidder has changed from
an organization that plans activi
ties ... to one that houses them,"
Jackson said, adding that the advi
sory group will aid in defining this
new function.

Ekanem said he sees the group as
an opportune chance to make
Tresidder more "student-centered."
"We have a good opportunity to
get things in there |for students),"
he said, referring to such services
as a Taco Bell outlet proposed last
year for Tresidder.
Jackson agreed that this group
offers a chance to "have everybody
meet together" to discuss future
goals for Tresidder.
