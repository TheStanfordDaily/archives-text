# HIV peer counselors help set 'safe-sex agendas'
## From different backgrounds, students share their support

They sprawl on couches, talk among themselves
and take a few notes. But the moment psychologist
Doug Daher raises his hands into the air like an evan
gelist and proclaims, "Here's to latex!" they jump out
of their seats and cheer.
The jubilant are 12 HIV peer counselors, who ad
vise students who Like the anonymous HIV test of
fered at Cowell Student Health Center.
()n Mondays, the counselors meet with the two ad
visors — Doug Daher, a Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services psychologist and Carole Pertofsky,
Health Promotions Director at Cowell — to talk
about the program Condoms, dental dams and Her
shey's syrup arc regular topics.
The counselors are a diverse group, coming from
almost every conceivable background. Senior Kiran
Khush grew up in a small farming town south of
Manila in the Philippines. Sharlene Pereira's grand
mother taught her the Hula — as a little girl, she
danced all the hometown bridal showers. And sopho
more Marcus Malone throws a mean Frisbee.
Yet they all share a common desire to help guide
other students through the anxious moments that
arise during testing.
Pereira, a 1993 graduate, and Khush have provid
ed anonymous pre- and post-HIV counseling since
the program's 1992 inception. Malone is beginning
his first quarter as a peer counselor after nearly two
months of training.
HIV tests in this program are anonymous and stu
dents are asked not to use real names. To further in
sure anonymity, a photograph of each peer counselor
is displayed on the first floor of CAPS so that a stu
dent can turn down a counselor if he or she knows the
person, Pertofsky said.
In the two years the program has been in place,
and of the more than 500 students tested, no one has
tested positive for the virus.

But the focus of the program is not just adminis
tering HIV tests, but helping students set their own
safe-sex agendas. Counselors help students reflect on
a level of risk they are comfortable with, Daher said.
"We want to make this an educational experience
so that people are reflecting in the future," he added.
The two phases of the test — a pre-test session and
a post-test session two weeks later — each provide the
counselors and their counselees an hour to talk.
Sometimes the pre-test only takes 10 minutes. At
other times it can turn into an hour's worth of dis

cussion, Khush said.
Those hours are sometimes filled with frank dis
cussions about sex, drugs, eroticism and the notion
that using a condom has a lot to do with self-esteem,
Khush said.
But peer counseling is not about being intrusive or
hard nosed, she added. "I don't want to sound like a
mother. I'm their age too."

in a Stanford medical lab research
ing the herpes virus.
While working with doctors and
health professors, she discovered
that even they had trouble talking
about sexual behavior. Perhaps it
was that experience, she said
doctors stammering on t he phone
— that prompted her to become a
peer counselor.
Over the years, she said the
decision has had its rewards. "I've
had people hug me after counsel
ing, or tell me their real names."
For Khush, counseling is an
opportunity to "escape the lab."
She spends her days working in a
Stanford medical laboratory, some
times peering down the barrel of a
microscope. That world is striking

ly different from the hours she
spends counseling people, she said.
"In the lab, you're dealing with
basic science. You're looking at
how biological mechanisms cause
disease," she said. "In counseling,
you're dealing with a person and
the psychological mechanisms that
contribute to disease."
Like every counselor in the pro
gram Khush has been on the other
side of the blood-draw. All coun
selors are required to take the HIV
test before they are allowed to
counsel others. Khush and Pereira
have gone through the requisite
two-week waiting period while the
HIV test is processed and evaluat
ed. Malone, who is still in training,
will be taking his test sometime in
the next few weeks.
Opponents of HIV peer counsel
ing often cite the need for total stu
dent anonymity.
"Students who come to campus

health centers want to be sure they
don't see another student — espe
cially when it concerns a problem
that has to do with mental health or
sexuality," said Barbara Coolee,
director of the campus health center
at the University of Washington.
Vince D'Andrea, CAPS psychia
trist, has written extensively on
positive aspects of peer counseling.
1 le said counselors and universities
are often fearful of peer counseling
programs. Their rationale is
"somebody's going to make a mis
take. Somebody's going to be
injured. Somebody's going to be
sued" — but that hasn't happened
here.
Though other opponents argue
there is something unseemly about
talking over problems with a some
one other than professional,
D'Andrea asked, "But where do
you go when you want to talk? You
go to your best friend."
