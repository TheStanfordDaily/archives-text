# HIV peer counselors help set 'safe-sex agendas'
## From different backgrounds, students share their support

They sprawl on couches, talk among themselves
and take a few notes. But the moment psychologist
Doug Daher raises his hands into the air like an evan
gelist and proclaims, "Here's to latex!" they jump out
of their seats and cheer.
The jubilant are 12 HIV peer counselors, who ad
vise students who Like the anonymous HIV test of
fered at Cowell Student Health Center.
()n Mondays, the counselors meet with the two ad
visors — Doug Daher, a Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services psychologist and Carole Pertofsky,
Health Promotions Director at Cowell — to talk
about the program Condoms, dental dams and Her
shey's syrup arc regular topics.
The counselors are a diverse group, coming from
almost every conceivable background. Senior Kiran
Khush grew up in a small farming town south of
Manila in the Philippines. Sharlene Pereira's grand
mother taught her the Hula — as a little girl, she
danced all the hometown bridal showers. And sopho
more Marcus Malone throws a mean Frisbee.
Yet they all share a common desire to help guide
other students through the anxious moments that
arise during testing.
Pereira, a 1993 graduate, and Khush have provid
ed anonymous pre- and post-HIV counseling since
the program's 1992 inception. Malone is beginning
his first quarter as a peer counselor after nearly two
months of training.
HIV tests in this program are anonymous and stu
dents are asked not to use real names. To further in
sure anonymity, a photograph of each peer counselor
is displayed on the first floor of CAPS so that a stu
dent can turn down a counselor if he or she knows the
person, Pertofsky said.
In the two years the program has been in place,
and of the more than 500 students tested, no one has
tested positive for the virus.

But the focus of the program is not just adminis
tering HIV tests, but helping students set their own
safe-sex agendas. Counselors help students reflect on
a level of risk they are comfortable with, Daher said.
"We want to make this an educational experience
so that people are reflecting in the future," he added.
The two phases of the test — a pre-test session and
a post-test session two weeks later — each provide the
counselors and their counselees an hour to talk.
Sometimes the pre-test only takes 10 minutes. At
other times it can turn into an hour's worth of dis

cussion, Khush said.
Those hours are sometimes filled with frank dis
cussions about sex, drugs, eroticism and the notion
that using a condom has a lot to do with self-esteem,
Khush said.
But peer counseling is not about being intrusive or
hard nosed, she added. "I don't want to sound like a
mother. I'm their age too."
