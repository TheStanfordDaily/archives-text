### Rachel Kolman Marshak Contributing writer 
The three E's of California poli
tics— economy, education, and
execution— were the mtyor issues
addressed in a debate yesterday at
the School between represen
tatives of Gov. Pete Wilson and his
challenger, Kathleen Brown.
The debate, sponsored by the
Public Interest Law Students
Association, was moderated by
I>aw Prof. Robert Weisberg. Wilson
was represented by Santa Clara
Deputy District Attorney Thomas
Hanford, while Brown was repre
sented by Tino Cuellar — a politi
cal science graduate student and
advisor to Brown's campaign.
Both surrogates stressed their
respective candidates' commit
ment to improving the California
economy.
Hanford pointed to Proposition
187 as a way to reduce expendi
tures. He also mentioned Wilson's
support of NAFTA, his creation of a

council to promote trade with Asia
which yielded $265 million of new
investments, and his reformation
of the workers' compensation law.
Cutting government waste was
the main proposal advanced by
Cuellar. "Kathleen (Brown) wants
to cut tax loopholes for country-club
memberships and lobbyists and
administrative expenditures at the
school district level," he said. "She
wants to consolidate (overlapping]
government agencies." He added
that this will save $5.2 billion.
Moving on to education, Cuellar
said the solution to the education
problem is to discover successful
courses of action, for example in
teaching methods, and copy them.
I le also stressed an expanding of
the charter school program, which
gives control of the schools to par
ents, teachers, and students, and
investing money "in a job skills
curriculum for kids who rre not
going to college and in improve
ments in school safety, including
metal detectors and a network of

boot camps for students who bring
guns to school," Cuellar said.
He noted that there is "no easy
solution" to the education problem,
but that "the solution starts at home
in getting families off welfare."
Although both candidates sup
port increasing the number of
police officers, gun control, the
death penalty and "three strikes"
crime legislation, they disagree on
implementation.
Hanford mentioned Wilson's
past legislative accomplishments,
including the creation of the vic
tim's bill of rights, the reinstitu
tion of the grand-jury system and
the institution of the "three
strikes" legislation.
"Wilson turned the tables from
favoritism of criminals to
favoritism of decent, law-abiding
citizens," Hanford said.
Cuellar proposed the creation of
California Safety Commission, sim
ilar to the National Security Coun
cil, to coordinate crime efforts a 15
percent excise tax on ammunition.
