# Washington/Stanford Match-Ups
## 
### 
Napoleon Kaufman, a Heisman
Trophy candidate, is the leader
of the Husky offense. Kaufman
enters today's game having al
ready amassed 1,174 yards
rushing on the year and has so
lidified himself as the best back
in the Pac-10 and possibly the
nation. He has rushed for over
200 yards five times in his ca
reer. For Stanford, freshman
running back Anthony Book
man has filled in admirably for
injured Mike Mitchell and Greg
Cornelia. The 5-9, 170 pounder
rushed for 138 yards against the
UCLA Bruins last week.

Eric Bjornson, a converted quar
terback, leads the Huskies in re
ceptions with 36 for 629 yards
receiving in 1994. He has
recorded seven of Washington's
12 passing touchdowns. Justin
Armour had his best day as a col
legiate athlete last week against
UCLA, where he caught 11 pass
es for 220 yards. Armour is just
167 yards shy of Ken
Margerum's school record of
2,430 receiving yards. He comes
into today's game on a role, hav
ing caught 26 passes for 512
yards and three touchdowns in
nis last three games.

Ink Aleaga has led the Huskv de
fense in tackles the last tnree
weeks with 15 against Arizona
State, 10 against Oregon, and 13
against Oregon State. Against
the Sun Devils, Aleaga also re
covered a fumble and returned
an interception for a touch
down. Coy Gibbs, the son of for
mer NFL coach Joe Gibbs, has
provided much needed senior
leadership on a young Cardinal
defense. He has started every
fame in 1994 at inside line
acker, recording 67 tackles, in
cluding 41 unassisted.

Washington's Mark Bruener
was named an Ail-American by
the Associated Press last season
and has continued to post im
pressive numbers. He has
caught 25 passes for 274 yards
in 1994 and has already solidi
fied himself as Washington's ca
reer leader in receptions by a
tight end. Tony Cline has caught
31 passes out of the tight end po
sition for the Cardinal and has
been called upon in many crucial
third down situations. On the
year, Cline has totaled 241 yards
receiving.

Frank Garcia spearheads a
Husky offensive line which has
enabled Napoleon Kaufman to
rush for over 1,100 yards al
ready in 1994. Garcia, a fifth
year senior, won his team's "Big
Hit" award for his blocking
against Stanford last season
which allowed Kaufman to rush
for 195 yards. T.J. Gaynor has
started every game at center for
the Cardinal since Glen Ca
vanaugh went down with an in
jury in the middle of last season.
With an offensive attack that re
lies heavily upon the pass, Stan
ford is counting on Gaynor and
the rest of the fine to give Steve
Stenstrom time to throw.

David Killpatrick, a former safe
ty who helped the Huskies lead
the nation m interceptions with
22 a year ago, has moved to line
backer. Killpatrick, who hails
from Anchorage, Alaska, has
recorded 47 tackles in 1994, in
cluding 20 solo. Mike Hall is
third on the Stanford team with
52 tackles in 1994 behind se
niors Coy Gibbs and Jason Fisk.
The senior from Torrance,
Calif., has another season of eli
gibility remaining after this
year.
