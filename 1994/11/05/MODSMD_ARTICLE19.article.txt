# Justin Armour climbs Cardinal record book
## Senior wide receiver reflects on his college career, looks to life after Stanford 
### Tom Baranowski 
In the history of Stanford football few re
ceivers, if any, have enjoyed the kind of suc
cess both on and off the field as senior wide
receiver Justin Armour.
For three years number 80 has been a
fixture on the Stanford team, starting 28 of
the Cardinal's last 31 games including
eleven starts in a row dating back to last
year. Now, as Armour prepares to play his
last three games in a Cardinal uniform, he is
approaching many of Stanford's career re
ceiving marks, including the school record
for receiving yards in a career.
"I have so much fun playing the game,
and I have so much fun when I'm out there
during games that a lot of the time, win or
lose, I realize that the only part I can really
control is my own performance," Armour
said. "I try to keep that in perspective no
matter what's going on with the team."
And, during Armour's career, Cardinal
football has gone through a roller coaster of
sorts. Despite a 10-2 record in 1992 that re
sulted in a Blockbuster Bowl victory over
Penn State, the last two years under Bill
Walsh have been somewhat of a disappoint-'
ment.
Many people expected that this would be
the year that Stanford would break into the
win column and challenge the other teams
in the Pacific 10 Conference for a Rose Bowl
berth. But Stanford has struggled to a 2-5-1
regular season record in 1994 and, with last
week's loss to UCLA, has been eliminated
from post-season play.
Through all of the turmoil, Armour's
love for the game and consistent perfor
mances have remained a constant.
"I think that the biggest thing is that
you're not conscious of [losing] all of the
time," the Manitou Springs, Colo, native
said. "You just take a lot of pride in the ef
fort you put in the off-season, and you de
cide early on in your college career whether
you're going to let football be important to
you."
For Armour, that decision was clear. As a
freshman under then head coach Dennis
Green now with the NFL's Minnesota
Vikings Armour was converted from
quarterback to wide receiver. Although not
one pass went his way that year, he still re
ceived playing time in blocking situations.
The 1991 campaign ended with Armour
plagued by foot injuries, but he rebounded
as a sophomore. He became a starter in
game two of the 1992 season and remained
in the line-up for the rest of the season. Ar
mour caught 36 balls for 626 yards and
seven touchdowns that year, but that was
only a vision of what was to come.
Armour came into his junior campaign as
the team's most experienced receiver and
he brought his play to new levels, improving
not only his statistics (he caught 51 passes

for 764 yard and 6 scores), but also his role
as a leader on the team. For his efforts, he
was named Second Team All Pac-10, and
Second Team Academic All-America, de
spite missing two games with a separated
shoulder.
To this point, 1994 has shown nothing
but more improvement for the big wide out,
proving that if nothing else Armour
decided early on in his college career that
football was going to be important to him.
With three games remaining, Armour has
racked up 51 more receptions for a career
high 874 yards and 6 touchdowns. Last
week against UCLA, he turned in the best
game of his Stanford career, catching 11
passes for 220 yards (both career highs) and
one score.
Armour now has 2,264 career yards re
ceiving, and is just 167 yards away from
breaking Ken Margerum's school record.
His 874 yards receiving in 1994 place him
only 244 yards shy of the school record for
most receiving yardage in a single season.
Additionally, he is now second all-time at
Stanford with 19 touchdowns caught. But
for Armour, the records aren't what the
game is all about.
"I think [records] are neat things to get,
and it's certainly an honor considering
some of the great receivers in the past who
have held them," said the senior. "But after
watching Steve [Stenstrom] get the [pass
ing] records, and then watching him get up
the next day you can see that it didn't
change him much.
"I think it will be fun down the road to
look back when I remember my college ca
reer and know that I did something that was
pretty neat. I think it's more of a retrospec
tive type of accomplishment."
One cannot talk about Armour, his ca
reer and his accomplishments without won
dering what he will be doing next year after
graduation.
Armour currently carries a 3.4 grade
point average as a public policy major, and
in October he was awarded an $lB,OOO Na
tional Football Foundation and College Hall
of Fame Fellowship which is put towards
furthering the education of scholar-ath
letes. For Armour, though, graduate school
might have to wait until after he takes his
shot at the National Football League.
"I'll definitely look to the NFL, especial
ly if they come knocking on my door and
give me a chance to play," he said. "That's
all I ask for a chance. I think I can get
onto a team and make something happen."
"I see myself as more of an H-Back, like
Shannon Sharpe [of the Denver Broncos] in
the pros," he continued. "I want to be some
one who provides a number of different op
tions. I can line up as a weak side tight end,
or in a slot, or be a third down possession re
ceiver. I think the combination of my size,
my consistent hands, and my ability to take

a hit will be pretty valuable for any given
team."
For his part, Stanford head coach Bill
Walsh a man with a considerable amount
of NFL experience agrees. "I don't think
there is any doubt that Justin will make a
fine professional football player, probably
as a tight end," Walsh said
However, if things don't work out for Ar
mour in professional football, he is prepared
with other plans.
"I don't think I'm going to keep trying
year after year if I don't make it in the pros,"
he said. "I just think that I'll move on to
other things, and graduate school is definite
ly going to be something that I want to do."
One gets the feeling in talking with Ar
mour that the game will always be in his
blood. In fact, he has even considered doing
some coaching somewhere down the line.
"As long as I'm at grad school I think I
would try to coach as a graduate assistant,"

he said. "I wouldn't mind continuing on in
the sport and working somewhere as an as
sistant coach."
For all of his success on the field and in
the classroom, Armour claims that Stan
ford has given him one thing which is more
important to him than all others his
friends.
"I'm happiest with my friends," he said.
"Every day, any time anyone asks me from
home, or anywhere, what I like most about
Stanford, without delay I will always say
the friends I met here. I feel like I have the
greatest friends in the world.
"Since the moment I got here, with the
people I met and hung out with my fresh
man year, and the many more I hang out
with now they're just not comparable to
anything," Armour added.
"If nothing else, I'm glad I came to Stan
ford because I met those people that I'll
know for the rest of my life".

last three games in a Cardinal uniform, he is
approaching many of Stanford's career re
ceiving marks, including the school record
for receiving yards in a career.
"I have so much fun playing the game,
and I have so much fun when I'm out there
during games that a lot of the time, win or
lose, I realize that the only part I can really
control is my own performance," Armour
said. "I try to keep that in perspective no
matter what's going on with the team."
And, during Armour's career, Cardinal
football has gone through a roller coaster of
sorts. Despite a 10-2 record in 1992 that re
sulted in a Blockbuster Bowl victory over
Penn State, the last two years under Bill
Walsh have been somewhat of a disappoint-'
ment.
Many people expected that this would be
the year that Stanford would break into the
win column and challenge the other teams
in the Pacific 10 Conference for a Rose Bowl
berth. But Stanford has struggled to a 2-5-1
regular season record in 1994 and, with last
week's loss to UCLA, has been eliminated
from post-season play.
Through all of the turmoil, Armour's
love for the game and consistent perfor
mances have remained a constant.
"I think that the biggest thing is that
you're not conscious of [losing] all of the
time," the Manitou Springs, Colo, native
said. "You just take a lot of pride in the ef
fort you put in the off-season, and you de
cide early on in your college career whether
you're going to let football be important to
you."
For Armour, that decision was clear. As a
freshman under then head coach Dennis
Green now with the NFL's Minnesota
Vikings Armour was converted from
quarterback to wide receiver. Although not
one pass went his way that year, he still re
ceived playing time in blocking situations.
The 1991 campaign ended with Armour
plagued by foot injuries, but he rebounded
as a sophomore. He became a starter in
game two of the 1992 season and remained
in the line-up for the rest of the season. Ar
mour caught 36 balls for 626 yards and
seven touchdowns that year, but that was
only a vision of what was to come.
Armour came into his junior campaign as
the team's most experienced receiver and
he brought his play to new levels, improving
not only his statistics (he caught 51 passes

for 764 yard and 6 scores), but also his role
as a leader on the team. For his efforts, he
was named Second Team All Pac-10, and
Second Team Academic All-America, de
spite missing two games with a separated
shoulder.
To this point, 1994 has shown nothing
but more improvement for the big wide out,
proving that if nothing else Armour
decided early on in his college career that
football was going to be important to him.
With three games remaining, Armour has
racked up 51 more receptions for a career
high 874 yards and 6 touchdowns. Last
week against UCLA, he turned in the best
game of his Stanford career, catching 11
passes for 220 yards (both career highs) and
one score.
Armour now has 2,264 career yards re
ceiving, and is just 167 yards away from
breaking Ken Margerum's school record.
His 874 yards receiving in 1994 place him
only 244 yards shy of the school record for
most receiving yardage in a single season.
Additionally, he is now second all-time at
Stanford with 19 touchdowns caught. But
for Armour, the records aren't what the
game is all about.
"I think [records] are neat things to get,
and it's certainly an honor considering
some of the great receivers in the past who
have held them," said the senior. "But after
watching Steve [Stenstrom] get the [pass
ing] records, and then watching him get up
the next day you can see that it didn't
change him much.
"I think it will be fun down the road to
look back when I remember my college ca
reer and know that I did something that was
pretty neat. I think it's more of a retrospec
tive type of accomplishment."
One cannot talk about Armour, his ca
reer and his accomplishments without won
dering what he will be doing next year after
graduation.
Armour currently carries a 3.4 grade
point average as a public policy major, and
in October he was awarded an $lB,OOO Na
tional Football Foundation and College Hall
of Fame Fellowship which is put towards
furthering the education of scholar-ath
letes. For Armour, though, graduate school
might have to wait until after he takes his
shot at the National Football League.
"I'll definitely look to the NFL, especial
ly if they come knocking on my door and
give me a chance to play," he said. "That's
all I ask for a chance. I think I can get
onto a team and make something happen."
"I see myself as more of an H-Back, like
Shannon Sharpe [of the Denver Broncos] in
the pros," he continued. "I want to be some
one who provides a number of different op
tions. I can line up as a weak side tight end,
or in a slot, or be a third down possession re
ceiver. I think the combination of my size,
my consistent hands, and my ability to take

a hit will be pretty valuable for any given
team."
For his part, Stanford head coach Bill
Walsh a man with a considerable amount
of NFL experience agrees. "I don't think
there is any doubt that Justin will make a
fine professional football player, probably
as a tight end," Walsh said
However, if things don't work out for Ar
mour in professional football, he is prepared
with other plans.
"I don't think I'm going to keep trying
year after year if I don't make it in the pros,"
he said. "I just think that I'll move on to
other things, and graduate school is definite
ly going to be something that I want to do."
One gets the feeling in talking with Ar
mour that the game will always be in his
blood. In fact, he has even considered doing
some coaching somewhere down the line.
"As long as I'm at grad school I think I
would try to coach as a graduate assistant,"

he said. "I wouldn't mind continuing on in
the sport and working somewhere as an as
sistant coach."
For all of his success on the field and in
the classroom, Armour claims that Stan
ford has given him one thing which is more
important to him than all others his
friends.
"I'm happiest with my friends," he said.
"Every day, any time anyone asks me from
home, or anywhere, what I like most about
Stanford, without delay I will always say
the friends I met here. I feel like I have the
greatest friends in the world.
"Since the moment I got here, with the
people I met and hung out with my fresh
man year, and the many more I hang out
with now they're just not comparable to
anything," Armour added.
"If nothing else, I'm glad I came to Stan
ford because I met those people that I'll
know for the rest of my life".
