# Bookman sparks Cardinal
## Freshman runner overcomes lack of size with speed 
### Andrew Blachman Editorial staff 
Anyone who's seen Cardinal
running back Anthony Bookman
perform on the football field
would have a difficult time under
standing the freshman's nick
name.
"When I was growing up I was
real fat," said Bookman, who is
listed at a generous 5-foot 9-inch
es tall and 170 pounds in the Stan
ford football media guide.
"There was a popular television
show called 'Good Times' with a
fat janitor named Bookman so the
guys in my neighborhood started
teasing me and calling me 'Big
Butts Bookman'," he said.
Try explaining that to the
UCLA Bruins, who were victim
ized by Bookman for nearly 140
yards rushing including a 70-
yard scamper where the true
freshman outran a host of UCLA
defensive backs in last Satur
day's 31-30 loss.
"I've always been the smallest
and youngest guy out there,"
Bookman said. "But that just
means that I've got to work extra
hard."
What Bookman does have in
his favor is speed, and a lot of it.
He was an Ail-American wide re
ceiver in high school and also ex
celled at track, posting a personal
best of 4.2 seconds in the 40-yard

dash.
"Don't ever tell [Bookman]
how small he is," said Stanford
head coach Bill Walsh. "He won't
hear any of it."
Since earning his way into the
starting line-up, Bookman has
been a focal point on offense
even if he's almost always the
smallest man on the field. He leads
the team in rushing with 362
yards on the season and is averag
ing nearly five yards per carry. If
Bookman continues his current
performance, he is on pace to be
come only the second true fresh
man in school history to lead the
team in rushing.
Bookman's unexpected oppor
tunity came when injuries forced
sophomores Greg Cornelia and
Mike Mitchell out of the line-up,
leading head coach Bill Walsh to
look for a running back to provide
balance in the Cardinal's pass ori
ented offense.
"Anthony [Bookman] has been
a real life-saver for us," said
Walsh. "He's taken on a major
load. He's blocking, he's running,
and he's catching the ball. He's a
terrific young man and I think
he's going to have a heck of a ca
reer here."
But even Bookman didn't ex
pect to be getting his chance to
play this early on in his college ca
reer.
"I thought I was going to be a

role player and maybe play special
teams," said the Grand Prairie,
Texas native. "I never imagined
that I'd be in a situation like this."
Being thrust into action hasn't
been all glory for the Cardinal
back, who has also made his share
of mistakes. Bookman ill-advised
ly called for a fair catch on a punt
return at his own four yard line
against the Bruins and then com
pounded his mistake by attempt
ing to advance the ball a penal
ty which pinned the Cardinal back
on its own one yard line.
"That mistake was based on in
experience," Bookman recalled.
"When something like that hap
pens you have to just learn from it
and then it's over."
The 18-year-old then respond
ed to his own error with a 70-yard
run that got Stanford out of the
jam. On the next play Bookman
capped the drive with a nine yard
touchdown giving him four
touchdown carries on the year.
Later in the game Bookman felt
he had crossed the goal line for an
other Stanford score, but the ref
erees saw things differently and
the Cardinal was forced to settle
for a short field goal.
"We're just not getting any
breaks right now," he said. "That
one play was a touchdown but
there's nothing we can do about
it."
Bookman's success at running
the ball has created a log-jam in
the Cardinal backfield, especially
when looking ahead to the 1995
season. Both Mitchell and Cornel
ia look to return to action and
promising play from another
sophomore, Quincy Jacobs, could
make competition for ball-carry
ing duties fierce next season.
"If I'm not playing next year I
know that it won't be because I
didn't give a 100 percent effort,"
Bookman said. "That's all that I
can do."
In the meantime, Bookman is
looking forward to showcasing his
talents against the Huskies, who
boast one of the conference's best
defenses. Bookman's two finest
rushing days as a collegiate ath
lete came against USC and UCLA,
the two worst teams at stopping
the run in the Pac-10.
"It's a challenge to play against
Washington, but that's a part of
life," Bookman said. "You always
want to see how you can do against
the best competition. I don't want
to be known as a guy who could
only perform against certain
teams."
And, with just three games left
to play in what has been a disap
pointing season for Stanford foot
ball, Bookman will again be called
upon to beat the odds.
"We're playing our butts off
right now and things just aren't
working out," Bookman said.
"It's unfair in a sense but I be
lieve that everything happens for
a reason. The trials that we're
going through right now as a team
are going to pay off in the long run
- I'm sure of it."
And who would know better
than "Big Butts Bookman".
