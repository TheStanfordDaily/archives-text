# Jason White anchors young Cardinal defense
## Stanford junior learns from mistake, excels on field since returning from suspension 
### John Lawson 
Last spring junior linebacker Jason
White found himself in the center of the
media's attention. Unfortunately, it was
not for his play on the field.
A figure in the now infamous incident in
volving seven other varsity athletes and the
gay liberation sculpture situated off of the
west side of the Main Quad, White has had
to come to terms with his actions.
Talking frankly, he stated that he and his
other companions realize that they made a
mistake
"I screwed up. We all did," White said. "I
can't go back and remedy the situation.
What I can do is go forward with my life. I
can't dwell on the past."
For the last month of the 1993-94 school
year, White didn't think so positively. "I lost
a lot of weight and put no energy into any
thing. It wasn't that great of a time."
But, as he has done before, White stayed
on the Farm during the summer quarter to
take classes to ready himself for the upcom
ing season. Only this summer there was
much more "readying" to do, both physical
ly and emotionally. "Once I got my head
straight, I started to focus more than I ever
have," he said.
White was obviously anxious to begin the
season this fall, but head coach Bill Walsh
suspended him and redshirt junior quarter
back Mark Butterfleld for the first three
games of the season due to their involve
ment in the statue defacing.
Therefore, White exerted himself to a
great extent at practice, often spending
extra time on the field to make sure he
wasn't missing a step. "Since I was to play
fewer games this season, there was no way I

was going to be rusty and not ready for any
of them," he said.
White sported his famous "Alice Cooper
look" with his eye shadow as he began the sea
son against Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind.
White reeked havoc in the Irish backfleld and
those of Arizona State, USC, and Oregon
State, before finally coming into his own
against UCLA last weekend in Los Angeles.
He recorded three sacks for a total of 22
yards lost against the Bruins. By his own
admission, he should have had more. "If I
hadn't hesitated, I could have had five," he
said wistfully.
White now ranks third on the team in
sacks and eighth on the team in tackles.
Since coming back to the team, said Walsh,
"Jason has probably played the best of any
of our defensive linemen. He's really had to
work hard and battle this year. I'm proud of
the way he's returned."
Against the high-powered offense of the
University of Washington and its star run
ning back Napoleon Kaufman, White knows
he's going to need to play with the intensity
and effectiveness that he brought to the
UCLA game last week.
"I'm going to have to play my best, but
I've been readying myself to play my best all
fall," he said. "I just have to go out and get
the job done again."
White has always had to prove himself to
others, and has relished doing so. An all
state defensive end out of Boise Senior High
School in Boise, Idaho, WTute was recruited
mostly by Big Sky Conference teams who
were considered a notch below the nation's
top football programs.
White was delighted when two Pacific 10
Conference schools Stanford and Wash
ington State finally noticed him. He was

even more ecstatic when he learned that
coaching legend Bill Walsh had come out of
a short-lived retirement to return to the
Farm to steer the Cardinal again. His deci
sion to attend Stanford proved an easy one.
This class was soon dubbed the "reject class"
by the media since these young men were re
portedly recruited half-heartedly by former
coach Dermis Green, soon to be the head coach
of the Minnesota Vikings of the NFL.
"I've worked hard to disprove that no
tion; I think my junior year teammates have
as well," White said.
On top of the incident last spring, even
his football make-up has been the target of
ridicule. "The fans at Oregon State really

got on me because of my eye shadow. That
just got me more pumped to go out there
and prove to them who they were dealing
with," White said.
He drew a reference to the taunting that
Deion Sanders received before and during
the game in Atlanta this year as a new mem
ber of the San Francisco 49ers. "When [the
fans] are booing you, I look at it as a sign of
respect. They dislike you because they know
that you are an important part of the team
and need to play well to give your team a
chance to win," White said.
This 245-pound native of Boise has
proved himself in the past. Today poses just
another test that he must pass.
