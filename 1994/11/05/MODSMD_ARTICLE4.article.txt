# Kaufman negs NFL, leads Husky offense
## Washington tailback stays in school, looks to capture Heisman in senior campaign 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
It is no surprise that Washington tail
back Napoleon Kaufman is one of the best
running backs in college football. What is
surprising, however, is that he is not al
ready one of the best running backs in the
National Football League.
A leading candidate for college football's
highest individual honor the Heisman
Trophy Kaufman has tallied startling
numbers in the 1994 campaign. He has
rushed for 1,174 yards thus far this season
and has ran for over 200 yards in three sep
arate games. Stanford, as a team, has bro
ken that barrier only once in 1994.
After setting the Husky single-season
rushing record last year as a junior, Kauf
man could eclipse his own mark after just
nine games if he gains 177 yards against the
Cardinal.
More impressive, however, is the money
Kaufman turned down by remaining in
school for his senior year instead of opting
for the NFL draft and turning pro.
"There's people in the NFL or NBA with
a lot of money and they're sad that they're
not in college," Kaufman said.
"I think college is fun," he added. "This is
the only chance for me to enjoy my college
life."
There's no denying that the Husky tail
back seriously considered leaving school to
compete at the next level. He consulted
many NFL scouts, Washington coach Jim
Lambright, his old high school coach Dick
Barrett and, most importantly, his mother
at the end of last season.
"I talked to my mom a great deal," Kauf
man said. "She tried not to get involved in it.
She told me that 'lt's your decision.' I've
made it and I'm happy."
But quite a few Husky opponents are less
enthused with Kaufman's decision to stay
in school. Many teams have gone through
intense efforts to limit Kaufman's produc
tivity, aiming to stop the running back by
over-stacking the line and ignoring the pass.
To a certain degree, it has worked
Kaufman has been held to under 100 yards
rushing three times this season. But each
time has been a Pyrrhic victory for the
Huskies' opponent. Miami, Arizona State
and Oregon State lost those games by a min
imum of 14 points despite containing Kauf
man.
"If I have to be used as a decoy than so be
it," the senior said. "We win. That's the
name of the game. You have people who
don't care about winning the game, they
care more about stopping me."

When the team loses, however, Kaufman
sings a different tune.
"I always want the ball," he said after the
Huskies' loss to Oregon. "You can call me
greedy or whatever, but I want the ball."
Kaufman attributes those statements to
his overwhelming drive to compete and win.
"In situations like that, you always feel
like you want the ball," he said. "We lost as
a team and that's the way it goes."
Many of the things Kaufman does to help
Washington win go unnoticed on the statis
tics sheet but are crucial nonetheless. For
instance, Kaufman likes to block. That may
not be unusual for a huge fullback, but "Lit
tle Nip" as his teammates call him is
small compared to the average football play
er. Kaufman is only 5-foot 9-inches tall and
weighs just 180 pounds.
"I take pride in doing things smaller guys
can't do like blocking guys that are a hundred
pounds heavier [than me]," he said. "I want to
do other things [besides just running]."
For Kaufman that includes catching
passes and returning kickoffs and punts. He
is Washington's career leader in all-purpose
yardage and is reaching the top of the Pacif
ic 10 Conference career list. Currently he
ranks fifth, only 120 yards behind USC
great Marcus Allen. By the end of the sea
son, Kaufman should be firmly entrenched
in third place in between a pair of Cardi
nal backs, Darrin Nelson and Glyn Milburn.
Charles White, who played for USC from
1976-79, is first.
While Kaufman is often compared to
other small running backs in the NFL such
as Charlie Garner, Dave Meggett, Emmitt
Smith and Barry Sanders, many believe he
may possess even more pure talent than
those esteemed rushers.
One of the fastest players in college foot
ball, Kaufman has been electronically timed
at 4.31 seconds in the 40-yard dash. The
speed allows him to explode once he gets
into the open, as evidenced by many of the
long plays he has made for touchdowns.
Against San Jose State this season,
Kaufman took a hand-off from quarterback
Damon Huard on the first play from scrim
mage, ran through a hole between the right
tackle and tight end, and scampered 91
yards into the end zone.
"You don't stop this guy," said Stanford
head coach Bill Walsh. "You just try to pin
those [bigplays] down."
Another instance of amazing play by
Kaufman include the entire game against
Arizona State his sophomore year. In the
Huskies' first contest of the season, Kauf
man rushed for 159 yards. A productive day
which elicits little comment until someone

mentions that it was done on only six carries.
The first two times he ran with the ball
that game ended up in gains of 63 yards and
70 yards. During the course of the contest,
he touched the ball 10 times and tallied 250
total yards, for an amazing average of 25
yards per play.
What sets Kaufman apart from all of the
other speed backs is his strength. A fanatic
in the weight room, Kaufman stunned many
by proving the claim on his athletic depart
ment poster that he could bench press over
400 pounds. Kaufman pressed 420.
"It's strictly business in the weight

room," he said.
All of this adds up to a great back that
will most likely go in the first round of the
NFL draft this: spring. Remaining as coy as
ever, Kaufman played down his chances.
"You always have dreams of going to the
NFL," Kaufman said. "I don't know where
I'll fit in."
Reflecting on the season so far and the
question if coming back for his senior year
was the correct choice, Kaufman got
straight to the point.
"I've had a great season," he said. "I'm
glad I stayed."

in the weight room, Kaufman stunned many
by proving the claim on his athletic depart
ment poster that he could bench press over
400 pounds. Kaufman pressed 420.
"It's strictly business in the weight

room," he said.
All of this adds up to a great back that
will most likely go in the first round of the
NFL draft this: spring. Remaining as coy as
ever, Kaufman played down his chances.
"You always have dreams of going to the
NFL," Kaufman said. "I don't know where
I'll fit in."
Reflecting on the season so far and the
question if coming back for his senior year
was the correct choice, Kaufman got
straight to the point.
"I've had a great season," he said. "I'm
glad I stayed."

Napoleon Kaufman outruns Pacific defenders en route to a touchdown. "Little Nip" has
already rushed for 1,174 yards In 1994.
It is no surprise that Washington tail
back Napoleon Kaufman is one of the best
running backs in college football. What is
surprising, however, is that he is not al
ready one of the best running backs in the
National Football League.
A leading candidate for college football's
highest individual honor the Heisman
Trophy Kaufman has tallied startling
numbers in the 1994 campaign. He has
rushed for 1,174 yards thus far this season
and has ran for over 200 yards in three sep
arate games. Stanford, as a team, has bro
ken that barrier only once in 1994.
After setting the Husky single-season
rushing record last year as a junior, Kauf
man could eclipse his own mark after just
nine games if he gains 177 yards against the
Cardinal.
More impressive, however, is the money
Kaufman turned down by remaining in
school for his senior year instead of opting
for the NFL draft and turning pro.
"There's people in the NFL or NBA with
a lot of money and they're sad that they're
not in college," Kaufman said.
"I think college is fun," he added. "This is
the only chance for me to enjoy my college
life."
There's no denying that the Husky tail
back seriously considered leaving school to
compete at the next level. He consulted
many NFL scouts, Washington coach Jim
Lambright, his old high school coach Dick
Barrett and, most importantly, his mother
at the end of last season.
"I talked to my mom a great deal," Kauf
man said. "She tried not to get involved in it.
She told me that 'lt's your decision.' I've
made it and I'm happy."
But quite a few Husky opponents are less
enthused with Kaufman's decision to stay
in school. Many teams have gone through
intense efforts to limit Kaufman's produc
tivity, aiming to stop the running back by
over-stacking the line and ignoring the pass.
To a certain degree, it has worked
Kaufman has been held to under 100 yards
rushing three times this season. But each
time has been a Pyrrhic victory for the
Huskies' opponent. Miami, Arizona State
and Oregon State lost those games by a min
imum of 14 points despite containing Kauf
man.
"If I have to be used as a decoy than so be
it," the senior said. "We win. That's the
name of the game. You have people who
don't care about winning the game, they
care more about stopping me."

When the team loses, however, Kaufman
sings a different tune.
"I always want the ball," he said after the
Huskies' loss to Oregon. "You can call me
greedy or whatever, but I want the ball."
Kaufman attributes those statements to
his overwhelming drive to compete and win.
"In situations like that, you always feel
like you want the ball," he said. "We lost as
a team and that's the way it goes."
Many of the things Kaufman does to help
Washington win go unnoticed on the statis
tics sheet but are crucial nonetheless. For
instance, Kaufman likes to block. That may
not be unusual for a huge fullback, but "Lit
tle Nip" as his teammates call him is
small compared to the average football play
er. Kaufman is only 5-foot 9-inches tall and
weighs just 180 pounds.
"I take pride in doing things smaller guys
can't do like blocking guys that are a hundred
pounds heavier [than me]," he said. "I want to
do other things [besides just running]."
For Kaufman that includes catching
passes and returning kickoffs and punts. He
is Washington's career leader in all-purpose
yardage and is reaching the top of the Pacif
ic 10 Conference career list. Currently he
ranks fifth, only 120 yards behind USC
great Marcus Allen. By the end of the sea
son, Kaufman should be firmly entrenched
in third place in between a pair of Cardi
nal backs, Darrin Nelson and Glyn Milburn.
Charles White, who played for USC from
1976-79, is first.
While Kaufman is often compared to
other small running backs in the NFL such
as Charlie Garner, Dave Meggett, Emmitt
Smith and Barry Sanders, many believe he
may possess even more pure talent than
those esteemed rushers.
One of the fastest players in college foot
ball, Kaufman has been electronically timed
at 4.31 seconds in the 40-yard dash. The
speed allows him to explode once he gets
into the open, as evidenced by many of the
long plays he has made for touchdowns.
Against San Jose State this season,
Kaufman took a hand-off from quarterback
Damon Huard on the first play from scrim
mage, ran through a hole between the right
tackle and tight end, and scampered 91
yards into the end zone.
"You don't stop this guy," said Stanford
head coach Bill Walsh. "You just try to pin
those [bigplays] down."
Another instance of amazing play by
Kaufman include the entire game against
Arizona State his sophomore year. In the
Huskies' first contest of the season, Kauf
man rushed for 159 yards. A productive day
which elicits little comment until someone

mentions that it was done on only six carries.
The first two times he ran with the ball
that game ended up in gains of 63 yards and
70 yards. During the course of the contest,
he touched the ball 10 times and tallied 250
total yards, for an amazing average of 25
yards per play.
