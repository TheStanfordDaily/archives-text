# CARDINAL NOTES
## Huskies dominate series 
### Christian Leone Editorial staff 
When Stanford traveled to Washington
last year, the Cardinal came back with a
34-14 season-opening loss in Jim Lam
bright's first game as the Huskies' head
coach. The Cardinal went into the game
ranked 12th in the nation only to be
crushed by Napoleon Kaufman and his 264
all-purpose yards.
This year it is the Huskies who are
ranked 12th in the nation and the 2-5-1 Car
dinal who will attempt to upset the most tal
ented and highest ranked team in the Pac
-10 a squad Stanford has not beaten in the
last ten years. . . .
• Washington's season has been filled with
a series of ups and downs. After a disap
pointing loss to USC in their opener, the
Huskies traveled to Ohio State where they
soundly beat a solid Buckeye team. They
then traveled to Miami and broke one of the
longest home winning streaks in college
football. The Hurricanes were riding a 58-
game home winning spree, but when the
Huskies left the Orange Bowl on Sept. 24
the streak was nothing but a memory.
Washington came away with a 38-20 victo
ry
• If the Huskies score today against Stan
ford it will be the 100 th consecutive Pac-10
game in which the Huskies have not been
shutout. . ..
• Steve Stenstrom passed for a career high
408 yards in a losing effort last week against
UCLA. Stenstrom leads the Pac-10 in both
total offense with 315.4 yards per game
and passing efficiency with a rating of
146.5. ...
• Last week Justin Armour caught for 220
yards and a touchdown to bump his career
total to 2,264 yards. He is a paltry 167 yards
away from breaking the school record cur
rently held by Ken Margerum. ...
• Also looking to break into the Cardinal
record book is sophomore wide receiver Brian
Manning. Manning has 53 receptions for 1049
yards in his two years on the farm. His average
of 19.8 yards per game ranks him right behind
Bob Blunt's 21.1 yards a grab

• Last Saturday was a career day for not
only Stenstrom and Armour but also for
freshman running back Anthony Bookman
who ran for a career best 138 yards and a
touchdown. Bookman is attempting to be
come only the second true freshman in Car
dinal history to lead the team in rushing
(Darrin Nelson did so in 1977). Bookman,
who entered the starting line-up when Mike
Mitchell went down with an ankle injury,
currently leads the Cardinal in rushing with
362 yards. .. .
• Washington's .800 winning percentage
in the '9os is the seventh best in the nation
and Napoleon Kaufman is one of the biggest
reasons why.
He is averaging over 130 all-purpose
yards in his career and 191.2 yards per
game this year. Against Stanford he car
ried the ball for 151 yards in 1992 and 264
yards in 1993. This year shouldn't be much
different Stanford is giving up an aver
age of a 186.4 yards a game on the
ground. . . .
• Stanford has not had too much trouble
putting points on the board its passing
offense is first in the conference and sec
ond in the nation and its scoring offense
leads the Pac-10. The problem has been de
fense.
With injuries to Brian Batson, Pete
Swanson and Eliel Swinton and the suspen
sion of Jason White, a number of freshman
have been thrust into the Cardinal starting
lineup. Players such as Corey Hill, a con
verted running back, Kadar Hamilton,
Kailee Wong, John Haskins and Chris Draft
have all been receiving significant minutes
this year.
It's not surprising that the defense has
had its difficulties. "The freshmen are just
not ready to play," head coach Bill Walsh
said. "Wejusthaveno choice.". .. .
• The Cardinal is last in the conference in
scoring defense allowing a whopping 31.5
points a game. If the Cardinal is to avoid an
embarrassing loss today, the defense is
going to have mature quickly and step up
against Kaufman, a man not even solid vet
eran defenses have been able to slow down
this year. ...
