# Around the Pac-10

### 
California at No. 18 Arizona
The Bears have lost their last three games, including
a 61-0 thrashing at the hands of USC. Last year,
looking for their first Rose Bowl appearance ever,
No. 13 Arizona rallied to a 20-0 halftime lead. But
when the game was over their Rose Bowl hopes had
been shattered Cal came back to win 24-20.
Arizona State at No, 21 Oregon
Oregon has come out on top in four of the last five
meetings between these teams. The Ducks are 4-1 in
the conference and currently sitting on top of the Pac
-10. Ninth in division in total offense and fourth in total
defense, the Ducks are simply getting the job done.
University of Pacific at Oregon State
At 1-5, the Beavers are one of two teams with a worse
conference record than the Cardinal this year. J.J.
Young anchors the first ranked running game in the
Pac-10 with 85.9 yards a game and quarterback Don
Shanklin leads the worst passing offense in the con
ference. Last year the Beavers ran all over Pacific
with a school record 667 yards rushing, with three
different backs topping the 100-yard mark.
No. 22 Southern Cal. at No. 16 Washington St.
USC has won the last 14 home games played
against the Cougars, but today Rob Johnson and the
Trojans journey to Washington to take on the best
defense and worst offense in the conference. Last
year the Trojans had 517 yards of total offense and no
turnovers on their way to a 34-3 victory.
