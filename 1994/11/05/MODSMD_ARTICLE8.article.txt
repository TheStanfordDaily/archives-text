# A 						split decision: Nebraska and Penn State vie for title
## 
### Andrew Blachman Editorial staff 
November is here and that means
there's one big question on the minds of
college football fans across the country
who's No. 1?
And for the third time in the last five
years, we may never find out.
That's because both Nebraska (9-0)
and Penn State (7-0) cannot meet in a
New Year's Day bowl game, prompting
renewed pressure on the NCAA to insti
tute a post-season playoff schedule
which would determine an undisputed
national champion.
Coming off last week's 24-7 manhan
dling of the previously undefeated Col
orado Buffaloes, Nebraska moved to No. 1
in the Associated Press Poll. Penn State
was equally impressive, handing Big Ten
power Ohio State its worst loss in 48 years
by a score of 63-14. For their efforts, the
Nittany Lions earned the top spot in the
CNN/USA Today Coaches' Poll.
And because neither the Huskers nor
the Lions have a ranked team remaining
on their schedule (though Nebraska will
have to battle the Sooners in Norman,
Okla. later this month) both teams should

remain undefeated
through the end of the
regular season.
Should the season
unfold this way, Penn
State would end as the
Big Ten Conference
champions and would be
forced to play in the
Rose Bowl while Ne
braska, the Big Eight
champs, would have a
New Year's Day date in
the Orange Bowl. The
thought of a split na
tional champion doesn't
sit well with the fans.
For his part, Stan-

ford head coach Bill Walsh sees things
differently.
"I just don't see a [post-season] playoff
system as being a practical way of com
pleting a year," he said. "[With a playoff]
you come to the final conclusion, which
unfortunately we see in professional
sports, that there is only one real winner.
Eveiyone else is a loser."
While the Nittany Lions and Corn
huskers will likely battle for the nation's
toD ranking in the media but not on the

gridiron, Walsh takes the dispute with a
grain of salt
"The great history of college football
has been that there have been any num
ber of bowls and, while all very impor
tant, they were contests that clearly
demonstrated the college spirit," the
Stanford coach said.
"If you force upon the college athlete
a winner-take-all attitude then I don't
think it will be in the best interest of col
lege football."
