# Hungry for change
## Students march against Prop. 187; still fighting for hunger strike goals 
### Kiran Srinivas 
Chanting "Chicano studies si,
uvasno!"and "The people united,
shall never be divided," about 40
demonstrators marched Friday
afternoon from White Plaza to
the Main Quad to remember the
goals of last year's hunger strike
— and to remind the administra
tion of the agreements it made to
end the strike.

"We are here today to com
memorate the six-month an
niversary of the original hunger
strike and also to voice our con
cerns for the problems that still
exist," junior Veronica Luna
said.
The three-day strike last May
was conducted with four major
objectives: to form a Chicano
Studies program, to implement a
University-wide ban on grapes,

to develop a community center in
East Palo Alto, and to request a
formal apology to Cecilia Burcia
ga — the University's highest
ranking Chicano administrator
— for the manner in which she
was laid off.
After the strike, the Universi
ty created committees to investi
gate the previous concerns, but
most of the protesters said little
progress has been made.

"We still can't major in Chi
cano Studies," said sophomore
Felipe Barragan, co-chair of
MEChA, a Chicano / Latino stu
dent group. "We will continue as
students, staff and faculty to
keep pressure on the Universi
ty."
The protesters also rallied
against Proposition 187, the
measure which, if passed in to
morrow's election, will deny so
cial services to illegal aliens.
"Proposition 187 is racist. It's
terrible, and it discriminates,"
Barragan said.
"The climate of suspicion and
hysteria [of Proposition 187] has
already begun," said graduate
student Rosalinda Ramirez.
She cited a recent example
where a woman in southern Cali
fornia went to get a haircut at a
barber shop. The barber, wrongly
assuming the woman was an ille
gal alien, tried to place her on cit
izen's arrest while calling the po
lice. Luckily, the woman was able
to walk away, she said.
"We came to stay and we are
going to stay. For those who want
us to go home, this is our home,"
said Hilda Alvarado, a mother of
two Stanford students. "They
need to wake up and realize we
are not going to be divided."
The non-violent rally is typical
of the Chicano culture, said Rudy
Busto, an assistant professor in
Religious Studies. "Our commu
nity has a strong tradition of non
violent resistance," he said, cit
ing examples dating back from
Mayan culture to the famous
1968 Cesar Chavez hunger
strikes.


Bobby Lee — Daily
Students march in the Quad on Friday to protest Proposition 187 and to remind the University of the
concerns which led the Chicano community to organize a hunger strike last year.
Junior Elvira Prieto, one of
last year's four hunger strikers,
said she was very thankful for the
strong show of support at the
rally.
"We weren't here for the fun of
it [last yearj,' Prieto said. "It's
really nice that we are still fight
ing."
The group ended its rally by
proceeding to Building 10 to give
a formal letter of concern to Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
and Provost Condoleezza Rice.
