Tree attacked by Husky Band
Immediately following the half-time show of
Saturday's football game against Washington,
some members of the Husky band rushed the
Stanford Tree leading to the arrest of one band
member.
"It sort of turned into a brawl," Stanford Band
manager Marshall Ungar said.
According to Ungar, about 10 Washington band
members rushed onto the field toward the Tree just
as the Stanford Band made its way toward the tun
nel.
"Members of the Washington band ran onto the
field and tackled me," said Ari Mervis, the Tree.
He said that the Washington band members
punched and kicked him and attempted to "rip my
costume to shreds."
Ungar said Stanford Band members immedi
ately responded. "Band members were quickly on
the scene attempting to hold them down," he
said.
Although Stanford Band members managed to
hold six of the initial attackers until the police got
there, only one was arrested and charged with
misdemeanor battery, Ungar said. The other five
got away while police broke up the fight.
The Washington band was allowed to play the
rest of the game, but was prohibited from running
onto the field after the game and was asked to
leave immediately following the game.
Mervis suffered no serious injuries resulting
from the confrontation.
"I was out by the third quarter," said Mervis.
Student injured in fall
Junior Jeffrey Gillis received minor injuries
last Saturday when he fell and bruised his wrist
after falling off of the trunk of a friend's moving
car in the Rains parking lot.
According to Gillis, he was joking with a friend

and jumped on the trunk of her car. His friend,
however, didn't notice him on the trunk. ' She
started to drive away," laughed Gillis. "I looked
back and noticed she had no idea and kept going."
"I decided to get off before she got to the high
way," Gillis said.
Just after jumping from the car, Gillis said he
took a few steps and started to feel dizzy. "I just
wilted and blacked out. My body went limp and I
fell to the ground."
When he came to he noticed two police cars, a
fire engine and an ambulance at the scene. "I'm
sitting on the ground and I'm totally fine," Gillis
said.
He received treatment at Stanford Hospital
later that evening for a "severely" sprained ankle.
Halloween fire
On Halloween, drivers heading down Old Page
Mill Road may have noticed that more than pump
kins were burning.
Stanford Police reported that an illegal bonfire
burned near Quarry Road just off Old Page Mill
last Monday afternoon.
Palo Alto Fire Department units responded to
the "smoldering bonfire," the police report stated.
Department authorities could not be reached
for further comment.
Biker bashes car
When hearing of a hit and run accident, most
picture the motorist as the one at fault. About a
week ago, however, a bicyclist hit a vehicle on the
west side of campus near Santa Theresa Ave. and
West Campus Drive.
According to Stanford Police reports, the biker
sideswiped the car and, when asked to produce
identification, "fled from the scene."
The biker is still at large.
