Israeli temple reopens
HEBRON, West Bank (AP) — Both Mus
lims and Jews protested new Israeli security
measures at the Tomb of the Patriarchs,
reopening today eight-and-a-half months after
a Jewish settler machine-gunned 29 Muslims
as they knelt in prayer.
The measures would have Muslims and Jews
pray separately. They also would have separate
bathrooms and walkways outside the shrine,
which has been equipped with metal detectors,
electronic gates and television cameras.
Yasser Arafat, head of the Palestinian self
rule authority, issued a statement saying that
restructuring the building violated the Israeli-
PLO peace treaty.
"We consider the Ibrahimi Mosque a holy
place for Muslims, and we do not accept divi
sion or separation," he said. "We see this sep
aration as a provocation that will lead to

increasing tension between Muslims and
Jews."

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Worshipers at former
President Reagan's church bowed their heads
yesterday to pray for a "'healing hand" to fight
his Alzheimer's disease, while messages wishing
him well poured in from around the country.
"We are concerned and shocked to hear of his
illness," the Rev. Paul Pierson said in leading
parishioners at Bel Air Presbyterian Church.
"We pray for your healing hand to slow the
progress of this disease," he said in leading the
prayer.
Reagan's handwritten letter disclosing the
disease was accompanied by a statement from
five doctors. They said that while Reagan's
health was otherwise good, "it is expected that
as the years go on it will begin to deteriorate."
