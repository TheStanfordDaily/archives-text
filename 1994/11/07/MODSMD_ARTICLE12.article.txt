MILAN, Italy (AP) â€” The worst
flooding in memory turned northern
Italy into a disaster area yesterday
and killed at least 54 people across
southern Europe and North Africa.
With hundreds of people reported
missing, the number of dead was
expected to rise as rescuers reached
isolated villages and searched
through the rubble of destroyed
homes.
The flooding, the worst in Italy
since 1913, swept away bridges and
whole sections of highway and cut off
hundreds of villages.
Hardest hit was Italy's northern
Piedmont region. At least 27 people
were dead or missing. Twenty-four
inches of rain fell in Piedmont over 60
hours by late yesterday. The rain was
expected to continue another 24
hours.

Flooding also hit the northern
region a Liguria, Lorn bar dy and Val
d'Aosta, where several feet of snow
struck Alpine areas. Heavy rains
drenched much of central Italy, Sici
ly and the Naples area.
Italian officials said 20,000 fire
fighters, police and volunteers were
struggling through the downpour
with the help of helicopters and
amphibious vehicles to distribute
food and blankets.
Ombretta Fumagalli Carulli, the
government's civil defense chief, said
the deluge was the worst since 1913.
She said there were 32 weather
related deaths during the weekend in
northern Italy.
Much of Asti, a city of 74,000 peo
ple, was under nine feet of water, and
large areas of the town were without
gas, electricity or phone service. Two

thousand people fled their homes.
Authorities were evacuating resi
dents from Montalto Dora, a small
Piedmont town threatened by 2.5
million cubic feet of water behind a
dam on the verge of bursting, the
ANSA news agency said.
Flooding trapped 10 spelunkers in
a cave near Vicenza. Divers were try
ing to reach them with food and ther
mal blankets.
Two homes for the elderly were
evacuated in Cuneo, south of Turin,
Piedmont's largest city. The soccer
match between Turin's two first divi
sion teams, Juventus and Torino,
was rained out.
Flooding locked up traffic on most
of the major highways in northern
Italy, where lines of cars snaked for
miles. Hundreds of farm fields were
submerged.
