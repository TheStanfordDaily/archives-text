# Pipeline ruptures, spills 4 million gallons of oil in northern Russia
## Leak follows on the heals of earlier incident in Penchora River 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - A new
rupture in a 31-mile pipeline
has spilled nearly four million
gallons of oil in Russia's far
north just miles from the site of
a huge spill this fall, an envi
ronmental group said yester
day.
Greenpeace Russia said it
discovered the new spill 40
miles north of the oil town of
Usinsk on Friday. A duty officer
at the Russian Ministry for
Emergency Situations said the
ministry had no information on
any new spill.
Greenpeace Russia said the
oil had been set ablaze, and that
a mile-long stream of burning
oil fed by lakes of oil two feet
deep cut across the tundra.
"This is a major oil disaster
caused by oil companies that
refused to stop pumping their

oil down a pipeline they know is
falling apart," said Paul Hors
man of Greenpeace Russia.
"The pipeline must be closed
down permanently."
The earlier spill, also north
of Usinsk and some 1,000 miles
northeast of Moscow, reported
ly already has polluted the
salmon-rich Pechora River. It
resulted from a series of rup
tures along the pipeline over
the last few months.
The exact size of the earlier
spill is unknown. U.S. authori
ties have said it could be as
large as 80 million gallons. Rus
sian officials say is much small
er — 4.1 million to 17.6 million
gallons.
The Exxon Valdez tanker, by
comparison, spilled nearly 11
million gallons of oil after run
ning aground in Alaska's Prince

William Sound in 1989.
A government commission
last week said the earlier spill
should be cleaned up before
spring floods make it worse
next year. However, cleanup
efforts have already been ham
pered by snow and ice in the
region, and some polluted zones
n are hard for heavy equipment to
reach.
Greenpeace Russia criticized
the government for failing to
prevent the new spill, saying
their inspection was improper.
"If they had bothered to get
closer to the pipe than just fly
ing over it, they would have
seen the leaks, and might have
been able to prevent this spill,"
Greenpeace activist Eduard
Gismatuliin said.
The pipeline is owned by the
Komineft company.
