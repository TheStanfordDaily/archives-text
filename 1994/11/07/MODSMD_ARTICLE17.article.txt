## We, the People of California 
### 
Tomorrow, those of us for
tunate enough to call ourselves
citizens of California will cast
ballots to determine the future of our
state. Nested between a proposition to
establish a universal health-services
system and a call for more Californians
to smoke their lungs out in order to
make use of these services lies an ini
tiative that more than any other will
define what it means to be Californian.
By voting on Proposition 187, the elec
torate will decide whether 1.6 million
residents of California may partake of
the state's most basic public services,
health care and education.
What distinguishes these 1.6 million
people from the rest of the population
is the coincidence that they were not
born in the United States and that
they, for whatever reason, did not
obtain the papers necessary to stay
within the borders of this country. The
authors of Proposition 187 believe that
these people are responsible for the
woes that have befallen the state in
recent years, particularly "economic
hardship" and "personal injury and
damage caused by [their] criminal con
duct."
It is ironic that those who drafted
Proposition 187, themselves descen
dants of illegal immigrants, scream the
word "illegal" repeatedly and in all caps
in their campaign propaganda,
denouncing the alleged lawlessness of
those entering the country without

proper documentation, while key provi
sions of their own proposition directly
violate both state and federal law, as
well as the United States Constitution.
Hardly a sign of great respect for the
law they are ostensibly purporting to
uphold.
California exists because of immi
gration. The ideal that created the state
and led to its prosperity and innovative
genius was dedicated to the proposition
that anyone has the right to become a
Californian who is willing to make the
sacrifices and invest the energy neces
sary to survive and thrive on its soil.
Those who have risked their lives and
liberty to stake out a new future for
themselves by crossing into California
are in many ways more deserving of
that right than those born comfortably
within the borders of the state.
The face of any nation or state
founded on immigration is bound to
change over time. The fact that the bal
lot pamphlet for the upcoming election
is available not only in English but also
Spanish, Japanese, Vietnamese, Chi
nese and Tagalog impressively docu
ments that transformation. It is some
times difficult for those of us whose
ancestors arrived a bit earlier to accept
such a change, and the feeble attempt
to preserve the status quo by stemming
the influx of immigrants is indicative of
this difficulty. But if California is to
maintain its vitality and creativity,
such constant renewal is desirable and

even requisite.
California currently faces a host of
problems, including crime, drug abuse,
economic stagnation and a decaying
educational system. It is sad to see that
many Californians are avoiding the
task of developing proactive, creative,
dynamic, long-term solutions to these
challenges and instead are shifting the
blame to a convenient group of scape
goats, even though these very scape
goats are making essential contribu
tions to the state's fundamental infras
tructure. Depriving 1.6 million inhabi
tants of the state of health care and
education is hardly a very intelligent
way to solve any problems. What hbfe
brought about the decline of Califorrrfb
is not the influx of illegal immigrant©
but the loss of innovation and the rise
of fear and paranoia that are threaten
ing to shape the state's collective men
tality. The most recent manifestation
of this destructive defeatism is Proposi
tion 187.
A resounding no to Proposition 187
is but the first step in the rejuvenation
of the state. Subsequent steps must be
worked out through the creative effort
of all who are willing to call themselves
Californians, whether natives or immi
grants.
