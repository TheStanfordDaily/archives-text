A university and its president must remain impartial

MATTHEW SCELZA'S letter
(Nov. 4) refers to a letter I wrote
to him. Below is the text of that
letter. Daily readers can judge for them
selves the merits of the argument:
Dear Mr. Scelza and Mr. Cordova,
Thank you for your letter of Oct. 17. I
appreciate your commitment to and your
vigorous advocacy of your point of view
on this important issue.
To carry out my duties as president of
Stanford University, I am obliged to
take positions on some legislation or
government policies that directly affect
Stanford's ability to conduct its instruc
tional or research programs. I also must

comment on policies and issues of educa
tion associations of which we are a mem
ber, as in the case you mention of my
position on accreditation and diversity
before the Western Association of Col
leges and Universities.
In a different vein, I often am asked
to take positions on legislation, ballot
initiatives and issues of the day. These
appeals come from faculty, students,
staff and alumni distributed across the
entire political spectrum. As a private
citizen, I often have strong opinions on
these matters; but as president of Stan
ford, I believe that I should not commit
the institution to my own personal polit
ical views. In this, I follow a long-stand

ing tradition of the University.
Since its founding — long before legal
constraints were imposed on the political
activities of charitable institutions —
Stanford has recognized that by speak
ing for, or purporting to speak for, the
institution, one may exercise a coercive
effect that constrains the opportunities
of faculty and students to take indepen
dent positions according to their person
al judgments.
As I have stated before, a university's
freedom and obligation are to provide a
forum for the most searching and candid
discussion of public issues. One of the
century's foremost First Amendment
scholars, the late Harry Kalven, said: A

university "cannot take collective action
on the issues of the day without endan
gering the conditions for its existence
and effectiveness. There is no mecha
nism by which it can reach a collective
position without inhibiting that full free
dom of dissent on which it thrives." This
viewpoint arises "not out of a lack of
courage nor out of indifference and
insensitivity. It arises out of respect for
free inquiry and the obligation to cher
ish a diversity of viewpoints."
Thank you again for your courteous
and thoughtful request. I have declined
for the reasons stated above, but I great
ly respect your point of view and wish
you well in your efforts.

Sincerely,
Gerhard Casper
University President
