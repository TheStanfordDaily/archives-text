# Law profs speak out against Prop. 187
## Campbell and about 30 other profs call measure counterproductive, unethical 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
In line with widespread student opposition to
California Proposition 187, a group of about 30
professors in the Law School announced their op
position to the measure at a press conference held
Friday.
California State Senator and Law Prof. Tom
Campbell joined his colleagues in opposition to
the proposition — which would deny social ser
vices to undocumented immigrants — saying
that it would be both ineffective and unethical.

"Think about someone with a communicable
disease who can't go to a doctor because health
care is unavailable," said Campbell, a Republican
representing Stanford and the surrounding area.
In this case, he said, the population at large would
be in danger because the disease could spread.
In addition, children not allowed to attend
school under Proposition 187 would be unable to
contribute to the state, he said.
"What are the alternatives for a 14-year-old
young man?" Campbell asked. "That person is
going to be in a gang.... It's better to have him in
school."

Law Prof. Tom Heller said he agrees with
Campbell's assessment of the proposition. "We
are in a transition ... [and] people are unsure
how to respond," he said. "Prop. 187 sums up all
of these insecurities, but the position is indefensi
ble."
Although gubernatorial candidate Pete Wil
son has made the proposition an integral part of
his campaign, Campbell said this is one issue on
which he differs with his fellow Republican.
"There are a couple of different views in the
party on this," he said, adding that
many Republicans share his opinion.
In order to substantiate his
argument, Campbell urged Repub
licans to consider the foundations
of the party. "We are opposed to
government intrusion ... which is
exactly what 187 does," he said.
"These are not things that a less
government oriented Republican
can support," he added.
While Campbell framed the
party's split over the issue in terms
of ideology, Law Prof. Miguel
Mendez said he believes it may be
more political in origin.

"I don't believe we'd be having
this controversy if Pete Wilson's
numbers hadn't been so low,"
Mendez said, adding that he sees the
emphasis on Proposition 187 as little
more than a "political maneuver."
On the issue of California's ille
gal immigration problem, which
underlies the proposition, Campbell
said that alternative methods of
changing the status quo exist.
"You can do a test case [in the
courts] without this law," he said.
For example, Campbell suggest
ed that California might attempt to
turn one undocumented prisoner
over to federal marshals.
The resulting dispute, he said,
would resolve many of the same
issues now before voters in the
form of Proposition 187.
