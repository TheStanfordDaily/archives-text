# For the record

In Friday's article about the
surrogate gubernatorial debate
held at the Law School, Kathleen
Brown representative Tino Cel
lar was incorrectly quoted as say
ing that "the solution [to educa
tion] starts at home in getting
families off welfare."
In fact, said he
believes, as Brown does, that "a
government has a choice whether
to blame welfare or to look for
other solutions that are going to
get parents more involved with
schools." The Daily regrets the
error.
