## Red storm breaks 10-year drought against Huskies Napoleon meets defeat at Waterloo

Stanford 46
Washington 28

After 10 years, Stanford has
finally ended the Purple Reign.
Battling No. 12 Washington (6-
3, 3-3 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
amid the wet and slippery condi
tions Saturday afternoon, the Car
dinal (3-5-1, 2-4) put together its
most complete game of the season
to come away with a 46-28 victory
and snap a decade of defeat at the
hands of the Huskies.
Learning at halftime that senior
quarterback Steve Stenstrom was
out for the game due to a broken
little finger on his throwing hand,
head coach Bill Walsh calmly
inserted sophomore Scott Frost
and watched him guide the offense
on three running-oriented, time
consuming scoring drives.
"We beat them at their own
game," Walsh said. "The physical
part of our football in the second
half was a revelation to all of us. We
just played our hearts out."
Rushing for only 63 yards in the
first half, Stanford's offensive line
punished the Washington front
seven for 199 yards on the ground
in the second half. Freshman
Anthony Bookman had 21 carries

for 119 yards and two touchdowns,
and Frost sparked the offense with
his scrambling, good for 88 yards
and one touchdown on 11 carries.
He also threw eight times, complet
ing two for 31 yards and one inter
ception.
"As the game wore on, we just
gained momentum and our guys

really blocked physically," Walsh
said. "We weren't willing to throw
that much and Scott completed a
couple of key passes but his spon
taneity and his instincts demon
strated themselves."
Indeed, the play of Stanford's
offensive line became critical in the
rain-soaked second half. As the
field grew muddier and it became
difficult to run the precise routes
and plays of the Stanford offense,
Jeff Buckey, Brad Badger, T.J.
Gaynor, Mike Jerich and Seth
Dittman buckled down and played
their best game ever, according to
Stenstrom.
"At times I thought I was on a
different team," senior wide receiv

er Justin Armour said. "The guys
on the O-line you look at their eyes
in the huddle, and they were deter
mined. Jerich was firing everybody
up. That guy was so intense, I
thought he was going to blow a
head vessel. They won the game for
us in the second half."
Along with the tireless perfor
mance of the offensive line, the
defense finally showed up in the
second half and shut the opposition
down. After surrendering 25 points
in the first half, Stanford held
Washington's offense to 118 yards
and one field goal after halftime.
"The defense really dedicated
itself at halftime when we found
out that Stennie [Stenstrom]
wasn't going to be able to go back
into the game," senior linebacker
Mike Hall said. "We knew the
points might not be coming on the
board like they usually do, so we
really had to settle down and shut
down Washington."
Stanford also won the turnover
battle, as the Huskies had a diffi
cult time holding on to the wet ball.
Although Washington's Napoleon
Kaufman ran for 139 yards and
two touchdowns, he also fumbled
twice (setting up two Cardinal
touchdowns) and was slowed by a
recurring turf-toe iryury.
"Anytime you come out and play
in a situation like this where it's
slippery, it's going to be tough,"
Kaufman said. "It's something you
just have to deal with. They had to
deal with it, so did we."
The defense also forced the
Huskies to punt five times in the
game and stayed fresh throughout
the second half thanks to Stan
ford's ball-control offense, which
had possession for 18 minutes, 17
seconds in the second half.
"One of the biggest boosts for us
was watching Frost take charge
and run the offense like he did,"
Hall said. "He cut so much time off
the clock for us, and that's really
what the defense needs. I don't
think there was ever a point in the
second half when the defense was
coming out tired."
For the game, Stanford out
gained the Huskies 482-411 in total
yards. The Cardinal's 262 rushing
yards* mark the second highest
total of the year next to the 314
yards Stanford amassed versus San
Jose State. The running game
grinded out 17 rushing first downs,
including 13 in the decisive second
half.
"I just feel numb," Washington
nose tackle Steve Hoffmann said.
"I wish we could do it all over
again, but I know we can't."

Shedding a Washington tackier, freshman running back Anthony Bookman scampers around right end
for the first of his two touchdowns on Saturday.
The 46 points allowed by the
Huskies marked the most points
scored against Washington in 81
games, dating back to when they
lost 47-17 to UCLA in 1987. Also,
the 29 points Stanford amassed in
the first half were the most given
up by Washington since Alabama
rolled up a 38-0 halftime score en
route to a 52-0 win in 1975, a Bpan
of 226 games.
To start the contest, Stanford
jumped out to a quick 7-0 lead
after converting a Kaufman fum
ble into excellent field position.
Sophomore cornerback Eliel
Swinton, in his first play afler a
five-game absence due to iryury
and personal reasons, scooped up
the loose ball and ran 34 yards
before being forced out of bounds
by Washington quarterback
Damon Huard.
Three plays later, Stenstrom
found Armour in the middle of the
endzone for the score. It was the
first of two Stenstrom touch
downs in the first half, and he was
13-for-18 for 188 yards and one
interception before breaking his
finger on a touchdown run late in
the second quarter.
Battling back and forth for
most of the first quarter, Stanford
and Washington traded scores
until it was knotted at 14. Afler a
surprise Husky onside kick, a
John Wales field goal made it 17-
14.
The Cardinal then came back
with two scores on drives that
took less than a minute each. A
two-play drive set up by another
Kaufman fumble culminated in a
power sweep to Bookman for a 15-
yard touchdown run. Stanford's
other first half score came on
Stenstrom's option keeper from
five yards out, set up by a 48-yard
pass from Stenstrom to Manning.
The second half was highlight
ed by a 12-play, 37-yard Stanford
drive which took over six minutes,
ending in a 30-yard Eric Abrams
field goal. After forcing Washing
ton to punt after three downs,
Stanford proceeded to run on
every play and chew up valuable
time. The field goal made it 39-28
and forced the Huskies to go
entirely to an ineffective passing
game. For the day, Huard was 22-
for-35 for 171 yards and one inter
ception by sophomore cornerback

Leroy Pruitt (his first since the
opening game of the season).
"The conditions made it so
passing wasn't going to be great
for either team," Frost said. "The
ball was wet and heavy, and it
took a lot of weight off my shoul
ders to be able to run the ball like
we did and keep getting first
downs on the ground."
A late touchdown by Bookman
on a 12-yard run put the final nail
in the Huskies' coffm on another
drive consisting entirely of run
ning plays. After developing a
defensive game plan geared
toward stopping Stenstrom, the
Washington defenders said they
had difficulty getting used to the
speed of Frost and Bookman and
the overall power of the Stanford
running game. Coming into the
contest, the Huskies ranked
fourth in the Pac-10 at stopping
the rush, giving up only 121.3
yards per game.
Saturday's game marked one of
the first times both Stanford's
offense and defense played up to
their potentials at the same time.
The change in quarterbacks did
little to slow down the offense, as
the Cardinal rolled up 252 yards
in the first half and 230 in the sec
ond.
"Part of that's exciting and the
other part is a little frustrating,
because you know we've had it
there all year," Armour «aid.
"What won it for us in the second
half was we had offense an*.'
defense stepping up at the same
time, instead of at different inter
vals."
As for Stenstrom, the team will
wait to see if he is able to play next
Saturday against Oregon. He will
attempt to throw Monday or
Tuesday and then make a deci
sion. Because the wet conditions
made throwing that much more
difficult in the second half, Sten
strom decided there was no way
he could have finished out the
game.
"I just landed on it funny, it
was sort of a freak injury," he
said. "I had the ball tucked under
neath my arm and I landed on the
ball and somebody landed on me.
That's the ironic thing about it.
After all the bullets I've dodged,
this would be the little thing that
puts me out of a game, and the
fact that I'd be running an option
play is even more funny."
After a win like this, Stanford
has the chance to laugh like a fool
in the rain.
