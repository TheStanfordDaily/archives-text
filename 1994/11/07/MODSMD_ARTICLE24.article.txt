## Red storm breaks 10-year drought against Huskies Napoleon meets defeat at Waterloo

Stanford 46
Washington 28

After 10 years, Stanford has
finally ended the Purple Reign.
Battling No. 12 Washington (6-
3, 3-3 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
amid the wet and slippery condi
tions Saturday afternoon, the Car
dinal (3-5-1, 2-4) put together its
most complete game of the season
to come away with a 46-28 victory
and snap a decade of defeat at the
hands of the Huskies.
Learning at halftime that senior
quarterback Steve Stenstrom was
out for the game due to a broken
little finger on his throwing hand,
head coach Bill Walsh calmly
inserted sophomore Scott Frost
and watched him guide the offense
on three running-oriented, time
consuming scoring drives.
"We beat them at their own
game," Walsh said. "The physical
part of our football in the second
half was a revelation to all of us. We
just played our hearts out."
Rushing for only 63 yards in the
first half, Stanford's offensive line
punished the Washington front
seven for 199 yards on the ground
in the second half. Freshman
Anthony Bookman had 21 carries

for 119 yards and two touchdowns,
and Frost sparked the offense with
his scrambling, good for 88 yards
and one touchdown on 11 carries.
He also threw eight times, complet
ing two for 31 yards and one inter
ception.
"As the game wore on, we just
gained momentum and our guys

really blocked physically," Walsh
said. "We weren't willing to throw
that much and Scott completed a
couple of key passes but his spon
taneity and his instincts demon
strated themselves."
Indeed, the play of Stanford's
offensive line became critical in the
rain-soaked second half. As the
field grew muddier and it became
difficult to run the precise routes
and plays of the Stanford offense,
Jeff Buckey, Brad Badger, T.J.
Gaynor, Mike Jerich and Seth
Dittman buckled down and played
their best game ever, according to
Stenstrom.
"At times I thought I was on a
different team," senior wide receiv

er Justin Armour said. "The guys
on the O-line you look at their eyes
in the huddle, and they were deter
mined. Jerich was firing everybody
up. That guy was so intense, I
thought he was going to blow a
head vessel. They won the game for
us in the second half."
Along with the tireless perfor
mance of the offensive line, the
defense finally showed up in the
second half and shut the opposition
down. After surrendering 25 points
in the first half, Stanford held
Washington's offense to 118 yards
and one field goal after halftime.
"The defense really dedicated
itself at halftime when we found
out that Stennie [Stenstrom]
wasn't going to be able to go back
into the game," senior linebacker
Mike Hall said. "We knew the
points might not be coming on the
board like they usually do, so we
really had to settle down and shut
down Washington."
Stanford also won the turnover
battle, as the Huskies had a diffi
cult time holding on to the wet ball.
Although Washington's Napoleon
Kaufman ran for 139 yards and
two touchdowns, he also fumbled
twice (setting up two Cardinal
touchdowns) and was slowed by a
recurring turf-toe iryury.
"Anytime you come out and play
in a situation like this where it's
slippery, it's going to be tough,"
Kaufman said. "It's something you
just have to deal with. They had to
deal with it, so did we."
The defense also forced the
Huskies to punt five times in the
game and stayed fresh throughout
the second half thanks to Stan
ford's ball-control offense, which
had possession for 18 minutes, 17
seconds in the second half.
"One of the biggest boosts for us
was watching Frost take charge
and run the offense like he did,"
Hall said. "He cut so much time off
the clock for us, and that's really
what the defense needs. I don't
think there was ever a point in the
second half when the defense was
coming out tired."
For the game, Stanford out
gained the Huskies 482-411 in total
yards. The Cardinal's 262 rushing
yards* mark the second highest
total of the year next to the 314
yards Stanford amassed versus San
Jose State. The running game
grinded out 17 rushing first downs,
including 13 in the decisive second
half.
"I just feel numb," Washington
nose tackle Steve Hoffmann said.
"I wish we could do it all over
again, but I know we can't."
