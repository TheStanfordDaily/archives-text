# Cardinal's fortunes turn with the wind
## 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
Over the weekend, the sky opened up over Stan
ford Stadium and someone obviously smiled down
upon the Cardinal football team.
For the first time this season, the frustrated Cardi
nal squad finally had everything go its way. Up until
Saturday's game, Stanford's season was defined by
missed field goals, lost momentum and several one
point losses against teams it should have beaten.
Playing under those menacing clouds of reduced
expectations, Stanford gave both skeptics and faith
fuls alike a jolt by storming past No. 12 Washington,
46-28.
"We were due," said head coach Bill Walsh. "After
all those close games where we out-gained our opposi
tion and out-played them virtually the whole game

only to lose, we were due. It finally happened and
» i A* W
we re ecstatic.
After disasters against Notre Dame, Arizona State
and most recently UCLA, Stanford seemed to redefine
misfortune every time it stepped out onto the field.
Despite boasting the No. 1 offense in the Pacific 10
Conference and a solid core on defense, the Cardinal
has admittedly been down on its luck this season.
However, the first drive of the game against the
Huskies on Saturday indicated that a different Cardi
nal team was in the house on that night.
On a third-and-two situation on Stanford's own
48-yard line, senior nose tackle Jason Fisk pummeled
Washington's Heisman candidate Napoleon Kaufman
for a 5-yard loss, causing Kaufman to cough up the
football. Sophomore defensive back Eliel Swinton
then scooped up the ball and
returned it for a gain of 33 yards.
Three plays and 46 seconds
later, senior quarterback Steve
Stenstrom connected with senior
wide receiver Justin Armour in the
endzone for the Cardinal's quick
est first-quarter tally of the year.
Then, settling into their trade
mark slug-fests on offense, the
Huskies and Stanford exchanged
three touchdowns and a field goal
for a 17-14 Washington lead at
the end of the first quarter.
At the beginning of the second
quarter, Stanford benefited from
its second major break of the
game on a fourth-and-eight deep
in Husky territory.
Forced to punt, senior Aaron
Mills launched a 42-yard beauty,
which slipped through Kauf
man's hands for a loss of 10
yards. Defensive back Kwame
Ellis recovered the ball and
downed it on Washington's 28.
Stanford's gained 52 yards on
that fortuitous play.
Stenstrom then marched into
the endzone on two plays, capping
the drive with a 13-yard bullet to
tight end Tony Cline. Spurred by
its new found momentum and
confidence, the Cardinal then suc
cessfully attempted a trick play on
the extra-point conversion.
Backup quarterback Scott
Frost took the snap and rushed
into the endzone around left end
for a 22-17 Stanford lead. Total
elapsed time for that gift touch
down — 35 seconds.
"We haven't gotten any breaks
up until this point and now we
got our share," Frost said.
"Today a few of them went our
way and luckily we were able to
capitalize."
However, just when Stanford's
fortunes seemed to improve,
Stenstrom, the central cog in the
Cardinal's offensive machine,

went down with a broken finger
on his last successful scoring
drive of the half.
Positioned on Washington's 6-
yard line late in the second quar
ter, Stenstrom did the honors
himself and dove up the middle,
giving Stanford the go-ahead
touchdown, 29-25.
During that play, Stenstrom
jammed his little finger between
the ball and someone else's pads,
leaving sophomore Frost to
assume the quarterbacking
duties during the second half.
"There was probably a little
apprehension about whether or
not I could win the game, because
the star player was out — the guy
everyone rallies around was out,"
Frost said.
But the new-look Cardinal
took things in stride and turned a
negative into another momen
tum-builder on the first drive of
the second half.
Frost orchestrated a 74-yard
series on 11 plays and erased all
doubts with a 10-yard scramble
which put Stanford up, 36-25.
"I think that made everyone
breathe a sigh of relief when I was
able to take us down and score a
touchdown," Frost said.
After that, it was smooth sail
ing for the Cardinal — no last
minute fumbles, no last-minute
field goals, no more one-point
heartbreakers.
The tide had finally turned,
and Stanford confirmed a popu
lar hypothesis that the squad
might just be 6-2 instead of 3-5 if
it were not for a couple of bad
breaks.
"It seems like we've been
snakebitten and even when we
played well enough to win before
we haven't been able to pull it out
because it's just a few plays that
are either our mistakes or the ball
bouncing the wrong way," Frost
said.
"But today we pulled it all
together — we played well and we
got our share of the breaks. It
feels good to finally win."
