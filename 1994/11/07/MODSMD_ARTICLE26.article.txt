The Empire strikes back.
On Friday evening, the No. 1 Stanford
women's volleyball team suffered its first
defeat of the season at the hands of fourth
ranked UCLA. The Bruins (24-3, 13-2 in the
Pacific 10 Conference), a perennial power
house in the sport, avenged their loss at
Maples Pavilion earlier this season with a five
game victory (10-15, 15-4, 15-3, 12-15, 15-11)
over the Cardinal (21-1,13-1) in Pauley Pavil
ion.
Stanford rebounded the following night
with a five-game victory (15-4,15-2,14-16,13-
15, 15-13) of its own over No. 13 USC. The
Trojans (16-6, 10-5) fought fiercely on their

home court, but the Cardinal bore down and
returned home with a split in Los Angeles.
"We put together our worst match of the
year," said Stanford head coach Don Shaw of
the loss to UCLA. "And the Bruins played very
well. We were lucky that it wasn't worse than
it actually was." The Cardinal committed 39
hitting errors, a season high, and registered a
hitting percentage of .173, a season low.
Stanford came out of the gate fast to take
the first game from UCLA. However, the Bru
ins, motivated by both the chance to knock the
nation's top-ranked team down a peg and a
loss to unranked Washington the previous
weekend, battled back.
"We let them back into that first game,"
said junior outside hitter Marnie Triefenbach.
"And even though we won it, we lost momen
tum. Then, when they came out for the second
game, they changed their lineup. It really
through us for a loop."
Shaw cited a number of Cardinal errors for
the team's lackluster showing in the next two
games.
"In games two and three, we were about as
bad as we could be," he said. "A lot of balls that
we hit out just missed. When that happens,
you tend to get too careful and that doesn't
help. We also seemed to be disoriented on

defense."
The games seemed to move past the team in
a blur.
"By the time we realized that we had let up,
we had dropped two games," said freshman
outside hitter Kristen Folkl. "We had to fight
hard to get back in."
Stanford, with renewed effort, took game
four and forced a fifth and deciding contest
before finally falling. In the fifth game of a
match, points are scored on every rally, regard
less of who controls the serve. This was the
first time this season that the Cardinal had to
deal with such a scoring method.
"The rally-scoring system really magnifies
every error," Shaw said. "And we made our
share."
After experiencing its first taste of defeat,
the squad may have felt a little jittery going
into Saturday night' 3 match with the Trojans.
However, the best cure for losing is a victory.
"From a confidence standpoint, we were in
a tough situation after the loss to the Bruins,"
Shaw said. "We weren't at the top of our game
and we got a little tentative. But you have to
come back and play hard the next time. That's
the only thing you can do."
Stanford showed no sign of any
jitters as it cruised to wins in the

first two games against the Tro
jans. USC, dominated by the Stan
ford defense, managed a negative
hitting percentage. But after the
break between games two and
three, the Cardinal found that the
Trojans had turned the tables.

"USC played much, much bet
ter," Shaw said. "And we made
mental mistakes. We got a little
careless."
Indeed, Stanford left the door
open for a Trojan comeback.
"We thought it was over,"
Triefenbach said. "Instead of
putting them away, we let them
back in."
USC played its way into a fifth
game with the Cardinal. In that
game, they took a 5-2 lead and led
13-12 before Stanford scored the
last three points to end the Tro
jans' upset bid and avoid a second
loss.
"It was a real test," Folkl said.
"It was a high-pressure situa
tion."
The loss to the Bruins does not
change the state of affairs in the
Pac-10 too drastically. Because of
UCLA's loss to Washington,
Stanford still holds a half-game
lead over the Bruins for first
place.
However, the defeat did end
Stanford's bid to become the first
team since USC's 1977 squad to
go through the entire season
undefeated. But as far as Shaw is
concerned, this development is
not something to mope over.
"Being undefeated is unneces
sary," he said. "It's a good thing, but
it can make you start playing to avoid
losing, instead of playing to win."
Players echoed this sentiment.
"Everyone's been really good
all year at dealing with the pres
sure," Triefenbach said. "Even
though we said we didn't feel it,
deep down inside we did."
The team now hopes to use the
defeat as a springboard for the
rest of its Pac-10 schedule and on
into the NCAAs.

Stanford, with renewed effort, took game
four and forced a fifth and deciding contest
before finally falling. In the fifth game of a
match, points are scored on every rally, regard
less of who controls the serve. This was the
first time this season that the Cardinal had to
deal with such a scoring method.
"The rally-scoring system really magnifies
every error," Shaw said. "And we made our
share."
After experiencing its first taste of defeat,
the squad may have felt a little jittery going
into Saturday night' 3 match with the Trojans.
However, the best cure for losing is a victory.
"From a confidence standpoint, we were in
a tough situation after the loss to the Bruins,"
Shaw said. "We weren't at the top of our game
and we got a little tentative. But you have to
come back and play hard the next time. That's
the only thing you can do."
Stanford showed no sign of any
jitters as it cruised to wins in the

first two games against the Tro
jans. USC, dominated by the Stan
ford defense, managed a negative
hitting percentage. But after the
break between games two and
three, the Cardinal found that the
Trojans had turned the tables.

"USC played much, much bet
ter," Shaw said. "And we made
mental mistakes. We got a little
careless."
Indeed, Stanford left the door
open for a Trojan comeback.
"We thought it was over,"
Triefenbach said. "Instead of
putting them away, we let them
back in."
USC played its way into a fifth
game with the Cardinal. In that
game, they took a 5-2 lead and led
13-12 before Stanford scored the
last three points to end the Tro
jans' upset bid and avoid a second
loss.
"It was a real test," Folkl said.
"It was a high-pressure situa
tion."
The loss to the Bruins does not
change the state of affairs in the
Pac-10 too drastically. Because of
UCLA's loss to Washington,
Stanford still holds a half-game
lead over the Bruins for first
place.
However, the defeat did end
Stanford's bid to become the first
team since USC's 1977 squad to
go through the entire season
undefeated. But as far as Shaw is
concerned, this development is
not something to mope over.
"Being undefeated is unneces
sary," he said. "It's a good thing, but
it can make you start playing to avoid
losing, instead of playing to win."
Players echoed this sentiment.
"Everyone's been really good
all year at dealing with the pres
sure," Triefenbach said. "Even
though we said we didn't feel it,
deep down inside we did."
The team now hopes to use the
defeat as a springboard for the
rest of its Pac-10 schedule and on
into the NCAAs.

The Empire strikes back.
On Friday evening, the No. 1 Stanford
women's volleyball team suffered its first
defeat of the season at the hands of fourth
ranked UCLA. The Bruins (24-3, 13-2 in the
Pacific 10 Conference), a perennial power
house in the sport, avenged their loss at
Maples Pavilion earlier this season with a five
game victory (10-15, 15-4, 15-3, 12-15, 15-11)
over the Cardinal (21-1,13-1) in Pauley Pavil
ion.
Stanford rebounded the following night
with a five-game victory (15-4,15-2,14-16,13-
15, 15-13) of its own over No. 13 USC. The
Trojans (16-6, 10-5) fought fiercely on their

home court, but the Cardinal bore down and
returned home with a split in Los Angeles.
"We put together our worst match of the
year," said Stanford head coach Don Shaw of
the loss to UCLA. "And the Bruins played very
well. We were lucky that it wasn't worse than
it actually was." The Cardinal committed 39
hitting errors, a season high, and registered a
hitting percentage of .173, a season low.
Stanford came out of the gate fast to take
the first game from UCLA. However, the Bru
ins, motivated by both the chance to knock the
nation's top-ranked team down a peg and a
loss to unranked Washington the previous
weekend, battled back.
"We let them back into that first game,"
said junior outside hitter Marnie Triefenbach.
"And even though we won it, we lost momen
tum. Then, when they came out for the second
game, they changed their lineup. It really
through us for a loop."
Shaw cited a number of Cardinal errors for
the team's lackluster showing in the next two
games.
"In games two and three, we were about as
bad as we could be," he said. "A lot of balls that
we hit out just missed. When that happens,
you tend to get too careful and that doesn't
help. We also seemed to be disoriented on

defense."
The games seemed to move past the team in
a blur.
"By the time we realized that we had let up,
we had dropped two games," said freshman
outside hitter Kristen Folkl. "We had to fight
hard to get back in."
Stanford, with renewed effort, took game
four and forced a fifth and deciding contest
before finally falling. In the fifth game of a
match, points are scored on every rally, regard
less of who controls the serve. This was the
first time this season that the Cardinal had to
