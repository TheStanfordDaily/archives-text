The Empire strikes back.
On Friday evening, the No. 1 Stanford
women's volleyball team suffered its first
defeat of the season at the hands of fourth
ranked UCLA. The Bruins (24-3, 13-2 in the
Pacific 10 Conference), a perennial power
house in the sport, avenged their loss at
Maples Pavilion earlier this season with a five
game victory (10-15, 15-4, 15-3, 12-15, 15-11)
over the Cardinal (21-1,13-1) in Pauley Pavil
ion.
Stanford rebounded the following night
with a five-game victory (15-4,15-2,14-16,13-
15, 15-13) of its own over No. 13 USC. The
Trojans (16-6, 10-5) fought fiercely on their

home court, but the Cardinal bore down and
returned home with a split in Los Angeles.
"We put together our worst match of the
year," said Stanford head coach Don Shaw of
the loss to UCLA. "And the Bruins played very
well. We were lucky that it wasn't worse than
it actually was." The Cardinal committed 39
hitting errors, a season high, and registered a
hitting percentage of .173, a season low.
Stanford came out of the gate fast to take
the first game from UCLA. However, the Bru
ins, motivated by both the chance to knock the
nation's top-ranked team down a peg and a
loss to unranked Washington the previous
weekend, battled back.
"We let them back into that first game,"
said junior outside hitter Marnie Triefenbach.
"And even though we won it, we lost momen
tum. Then, when they came out for the second
game, they changed their lineup. It really
through us for a loop."
Shaw cited a number of Cardinal errors for
the team's lackluster showing in the next two
games.
"In games two and three, we were about as
bad as we could be," he said. "A lot of balls that
we hit out just missed. When that happens,
you tend to get too careful and that doesn't
help. We also seemed to be disoriented on

defense."
The games seemed to move past the team in
a blur.
"By the time we realized that we had let up,
we had dropped two games," said freshman
outside hitter Kristen Folkl. "We had to fight
hard to get back in."
Stanford, with renewed effort, took game
four and forced a fifth and deciding contest
before finally falling. In the fifth game of a
match, points are scored on every rally, regard
less of who controls the serve. This was the
first time this season that the Cardinal had to
deal with such a scoring method.
"The rally-scoring system really magnifies
every error," Shaw said. "And we made our
share."
After experiencing its first taste of defeat,
the squad may have felt a little jittery going
into Saturday night' 3 match with the Trojans.
However, the best cure for losing is a victory.
"From a confidence standpoint, we were in
a tough situation after the loss to the Bruins,"
Shaw said. "We weren't at the top of our game
and we got a little tentative. But you have to
come back and play hard the next time. That's
the only thing you can do."
