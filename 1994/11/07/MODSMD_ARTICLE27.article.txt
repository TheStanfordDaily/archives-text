Before Saturday, there was one
team left to beat.
Although the Stanford men's
water polo team has enjoyed plenty
of successes so far this season, one

noticeable stain mars its excellent
19-1 record.
The Cardinal revenged its only
loss of the year Saturday, taking
care of the No. 3 Golden Bears (17-
7) at deGuerre Pool. With this 10-8
victory, No. 1 Stanford has now
defeated each of the nation's top-10
teams.
"We can't complain," said senior
Wolf Wigo. "We didn't feel like we
played a really good game, certain
ly not our best of the year, but we
won. Everyone feels a little better
having it out of the way."
The Cardinal managed to defeat

the Golden Bears despite a huge
difference in 20-second ejection
fouls. During the course of the
game, officials ejected Stanford
players 12 times, compared to five
California ejections.
"I think they earned a few [ejec
tions], but the refs seemed to be
dishing them out," Wigo said. "It
seemed like every time down, they
drew a kickout."
Cal's offense proved non-exis
tent outside of its extra-man six
on-five situations. The Bears man
aged only one goal when both
teams were at full strength.

"That was the biggest factor of
the game," coach Dante Dettaman
ti said. "They scored seven of their
eight goals on penalties. They were
successful in spreading out our
zone a few times, because we like to
knock them down."
The Bears converted six of 12
six-on-fives and also took advan
tage of two penalty shots.
Dettamanti expressed concern
at the number of ejection fouls col
lected by his team.
"You can only play six-on-five
