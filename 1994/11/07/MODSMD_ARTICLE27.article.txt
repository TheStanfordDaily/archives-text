Before Saturday, there was one
team left to beat.
Although the Stanford men's
water polo team has enjoyed plenty
of successes so far this season, one

noticeable stain mars its excellent
19-1 record.
The Cardinal revenged its only
loss of the year Saturday, taking
care of the No. 3 Golden Bears (17-
7) at deGuerre Pool. With this 10-8
victory, No. 1 Stanford has now
defeated each of the nation's top-10
teams.
"We can't complain," said senior
Wolf Wigo. "We didn't feel like we
played a really good game, certain
ly not our best of the year, but we
won. Everyone feels a little better
having it out of the way."
The Cardinal managed to defeat

the Golden Bears despite a huge
difference in 20-second ejection
fouls. During the course of the
game, officials ejected Stanford
players 12 times, compared to five
California ejections.
"I think they earned a few [ejec
tions], but the refs seemed to be
dishing them out," Wigo said. "It
seemed like every time down, they
drew a kickout."
Cal's offense proved non-exis
tent outside of its extra-man six
on-five situations. The Bears man
aged only one goal when both
teams were at full strength.

"That was the biggest factor of
the game," coach Dante Dettaman
ti said. "They scored seven of their
eight goals on penalties. They were
successful in spreading out our
zone a few times, because we like to
knock them down."
The Bears converted six of 12
six-on-fives and also took advan
tage of two penalty shots.
Dettamanti expressed concern
at the number of ejection fouls col
lected by his team.
"You can only play six-on-five
defense so much," Dettamanti said.
"A lot of the ejections came in the
second half - that worries me
because it has happened a lot."
Nevertheless, the Cardinal
coach was encouraged by the over
all performance.
"Take away the six-on-fives and
we killed them," Dettamanti said.
Stanford goaltender Jack
Bowen, who collected nine saves,
was kept on his toes due to the
amount of time the Cardinal played
with a one-man disadvantage.
"Holding them to 50 percent on
the extra-man is good," Bowen said.
"They're great passers on the six
on-five. [At even strength], there
are different levels that I come out
to when I'm expecting a shot. On
the six-on-five, anyone can shoot, so
I'm at maximum intensity at all
times."
While Bowen worked hard in the
net, Wigo (four goals), Jeremy
leister (four points on two two
point shots) and Josh I/eachman
(two goals) kept his counterpart,
Cal's Sean Nolan, busy as well.
Wigo, the team's leading scorer,
is making a bid to become Stan
ford's seventh four-time Ail-Ameri
can.
"Wolfs starting to realize that
it's time to get going," Bowen said.
"He and [fellow seniorl Frank
[Schneider! are starting to feel that
way."
Stanford competes in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation tour
nament this weekend and NCAAs
will take place Nov. 25-27. Both
championships will be held in Long
Beach, Calif.
"On last weekend's trip, we real
ly stepped it up against USC and
UCLA," Bowen said. "This is a
great time to press through and
keep improving without letting
down. We want to continue on an
upswing — records don't matter
when it comes to NCAAs."
