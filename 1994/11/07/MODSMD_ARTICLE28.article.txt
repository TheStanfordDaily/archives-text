Despite the overcast skies and
raindrops this weekend, the out
come for the Stanford women's
soccer team was sunny indeed.
In two Pacific 10 Conference
matchups at Maloney Field with
major NCAA tournament implica
tions, the No. 3 Cardinal fought off
No. 14 Washington (11-6-1) 2-0 on

Freshman midfielder Elie Foster fights off a Washington State play
er during the Cardinal's 1-0 victory on a drenched Maloney Field.
Friday and Washington State (11-
6-1) 1-0 on Sunday to end the reg
ular season at 16-1-1 overall and 3-
0-1 in the conference.
For the second consecutive year,
the Cardinal finished the regular
season with a perfect record. Stan
ford has won 19 straight overall at
home since a 2-0 loss to Santa
Clara in a 1992 NCAA quarterfinal
game, and 25 consecutive games in
the regular season dating to a 5-0
defeat to North Carolina on Oct.
12, 1992.
Superior goalkeeping, junior
Carmel Murphy's left foot, and
ugly scores from close range sepa
rated the Cardinal from its Pac-10
rivals. In Friday's game, the
Huskies outshot Stanford 19-8 but
never seemed to take control of the
game. Senior goalkeeper Jennifer
Poehler, who has had little to do in
many of her eight previous
shutouts, posted a career-high 12
saves.
"I think we played a pretty good
game," Poehler said. "We did a
good job of possessing and creating
chances. Actually, even though we

didn't create as many as we usual
ly do, our percentages were higher.
We were two for eight instead of
one for 24."
Washington, on the other hand,
struggled to convert scoring oppor
tunities. Head coach lan Sawyers
attributed the Huskies' frustra
tions to the Cardinal's strategy.
"We kept them out [of close
range]," Sawyers said. "They were
shooting from 25, 30 yards, which
is fine. If you can keep a team like
Washington shooting from 25, 30
out, you have a good chance of
stopping them."
Meanwhile, Stanford, which has
at times resorted to ill-advised long
shots, converted in front of the
Washington goal. Just beyond the
16-minute mark, sophomore for
ward Erin Martin tapped a loose
ball just forward of the Washington
net to senior fullback Melinda Min
strell. With Washington goalkeeper
Tina Thompson out of position,
Minstrell touched the ball in for
her second goal of the season.
"I think it hit off somebody's
gut. It was bouncing and I kicked
it," Minstrell said of her ninth
career goal. "Beautiful form, and
the technique was there. I've had
some pretty goals, they were just
two or three years ago."

Minstrell's goal gave the Cardi
nal the early advantage, but Mur
phy's score was the one that would
make the highlight reels. At the
68:45 mark, Murphy took matters
into her own hands. She beat a cou
ple defenders and the referee
standing in the way, and fired from
just outside the box with the left
foot. The left-footer caught
Thompson off guard, and Mur
phy's shot sailed into the upper
right corner just out of her reach.
Murphy credited the aggressive
defense on the Washington side of
the field for her score.
"One of the big things for this
game was team defense," she said.
"There was someone pressuring in
the corner and I anticipated the
pass and stepped in on it. I was
going laterally and left-footed,
curled it into the right."
In yesterday's game, the
drenched field limited offensive
output from both sides. Stanford
controlled play against the
Cougars, but couldn't get on the
scoreboard, which failed to func
tion anyway. After over an hour
into the match, Stanford once
again put away a loose ball in front
of the goal.
Martin fired a shot off the right
post, which bounced back to Min
strell. Minstrell rebounded the
errant ball and Martin finished the
job, putting it past the top-ranked
goalkeeper in the nation, Kris
Young.
Minstrell's fourth assist places
her second on the team to Martin's
five. With her 15th goal of 1994,
Martin eclipsed her total in her
freshman year.
Although the Cardinal only
scored once, its patient but still
aggressive play encouraged
Sawyers.
"We're improving our percent
ages," Sawyers said. "We may not
be getting as many chances, but
we're more quality-oriented with
our entry passes.
"I'm very happy with the way
the players are taking responsibili
ty of stepping up their output.
They're fighting to be in the right
position at the right time."
Not even a controversial yellow
card to senior forward Andrea
Johnson affected the outcome as
the Cardinal kept WSU from estab
lishing its game plan. Poehler
recorded her 10th shutout of 1994
by notching three saves. The Car
dinal now turns its attention to the
upcoming NCAA Regional Cham
pionships next Saturday and Sun
day in Portland, Oregon.
