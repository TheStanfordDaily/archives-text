After slipping down the slope of
defeat this season, the Stanford
men's soccer team felt as if it fin
ished on top of the hill yesterday.
The Cardinal (5-12-2) slid to a
4-0 victory over UC-Santa Barbara
(9-8-1) on muddy Maloney field.
Despite the conditions, Stanford
played one of its best games of the
year and executed well both offen
sively and defensively.
Stanford's blanking of the Gau
chos proved particularly satisfying
since during the teams' last meet
ing, UCSB handed the Cardinal a
stinging 5-1 loss.
We handled some unfinished
business from last year," said
senior forward/defender Ryan
Estevez.
Junior midfielder Chet Zimmer
scored the Cardinal's first goal off
of a cross from sophomore defend
er Brad Davies. Estevez accounted
for the next two points, both times
with assists from sophomore for
ward/midfielder John Manchester.
A Gaucho actually scored Stan
ford's fourth goal. After Zimmer
took the ball all the way upfield
and shot it, the ball deflected off a
Gaucho defender and rolled in the
goal past a stunned Monte Skars
gard, UCSB's goalkeeper.
Both Stanford goalkeepers,
senior Jim Masetti and sophomore
Ryan Craig, tightly sealed the Car
dinal net. Masetti left the game at
the end of the first half with an
injury but Craig filled his cleats
and came up with several point
blank range saves. Also, sopho

senior midfielders Greg Wilson
and Jeff Kogl all frustrated the
Gauchos with their tenacious
defense.

dores said. "We're better than our
record. It's nice to see the players put
a good game together after such a
frustrating season. We played well,
and all the seniors played well."
Since the Cardinal did not make
the playoffs this season, yesterday
was the farewell game for the
senior players. Other than the
injured Ryan Collins, all the
seniors started and all managed to
go out with a bang.
"For the other games, saying we
were playing for pride was a little

contrived," Craig said. "But this
game really does mean something
— for some of these players, this is
the last game of their careers. More
than anything, we played this one
for ourselves."
The seniors themselves expressed
not only elation but also relief.
"It's definitely good to go out
like this," Masetti said. "We will
still remember the losing season,
but this kind of makes it that much
easier to go out. We played great,
especially Vez [Estevez], who prob
ably had the best game of the sea
son, maybe of his career."
Estevez's two goals came on the
heels of several strong but scoreless
performances. Prior to yesterday,

his last six consecutive shots barely
missed the mark. Despite his out
standing game, he preferred not to
focus on the sentimentality of this
final match.
"Don't cry for me," Estevez
said, "I went out hard."
Stanford can afford to focus on
the positive way its season ended
because its problems this year had
more to do with attitude than tal
ent. Lindores hopes that the defeat
of the Gauchos will propel the
young squad into next season with
a winning mind set.
"From now until next fall we'll
remember a win," the coach said.
"Hopefully this will be a building
block for next year."
