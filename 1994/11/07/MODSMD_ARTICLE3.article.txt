# Busing the axe back home
## ASSU rents buses for Big Trek to Cal 
### Ben Sussman 
Hoping to be able to "bus back the
axe," the ASSU has arranged for buses
to take students to and from Big Game
on Nov. 19.
Tickets for the buses were divided
into two separate sales groups — one
held for dorms, ending on Nov. 2, and
another for individual sales, which start
ed today.

According to ASSU Senate Chair Mike
Choo, several resident assistants had ex
pressed interest in renting buses to
take their students to Big Game together.
"This is exactly what the ASSU is
for," Choo said. Because of such re
quests, the ASSU offered residences an
early opportunity to purchase bus tick
ets, allowing the students to travel and
sit together without excessive hassle.
The ASSU has also subsidized a por

tion of the ticket prices for the dorm
groups, reducing prices to $10, as op
posed to the normal $12 per person for
individual sales.
Already, Choo said the buses have
"gotten a great response" from the
dorms. Based on an earlier publicity
campaign, he and other planners had ex
pected between 200 and 300 orders from
the dorms.
More than 600 orders, howev
er, have already been placed with
at least 150 more individual sales
expected.
Those individual sales start
today at the Cardinal Collection
and Disconnection, both ASSU
business projects housed in
Tresidder Union. Choo said that,
should sales exceed the available

number of buses, additional buses
are available.
Arranging Big Game buses is a
new activity for student govern
ment, said Council of Presidents
member Mork Murdock.
"We don't know when this has
been done in the past by student
government — certainly not in the
past five or six years," he said.
Choo called the busing arrange
ment "a service project," explaining
that coordinating the buses bene
fits the entire campus by allowing
as many students to go as possible.
Many bus companies, for example,

would not rent to individual dorms.
In addition, by taking buses
students will be able to avoid Cal
train and BART traffic, as well as
parking problems at UC-Berkeley
stadium, Choo said.
Approximate traveling time for
the buses will be half of that for
mass transit options, will cost only
one to two dollars more, and will
afford students the luxury of air
conditioned seats and restroom
equipped buses, Murdock said.
Buses will depart from Stanford
on Saturday at 9:30 a.m. and will
leave UC-Berkeley at 5:30 p.m.
