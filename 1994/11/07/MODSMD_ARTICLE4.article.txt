Charlie the Tuna may have just received a new
lease on life.
Thanks to a $1 million grant from Stanford and a
$1 million investment by the Monterey Bay Aquari
um, Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station and the
Aquarium have joined together to create the Tuna
Research and Conservation Center.
The new center is the first facility in the world to
both maintain tuna and study them with the hope of
learning how to conserve the tuna population.
The co-directors of the TRCC are Barbara Block
— Stanford assistant professor of biology and one of
the world's leading experts in the physiology of tuna
— and Chuck Farwell — Monterey Bay Aquarium's
