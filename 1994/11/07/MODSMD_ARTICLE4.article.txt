## New tuna research center studies fish's habitat and conservation

Charlie the Tuna may have just received a new
lease on life.
Thanks to a $1 million grant from Stanford and a
$1 million investment by the Monterey Bay Aquari
um, Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station and the
Aquarium have joined together to create the Tuna
Research and Conservation Center.
The new center is the first facility in the world to
both maintain tuna and study them with the hope of
learning how to conserve the tuna population.
The co-directors of the TRCC are Barbara Block
— Stanford assistant professor of biology and one of
the world's leading experts in the physiology of tuna
— and Chuck Farwell — Monterey Bay Aquarium's

curator of oceanic Fishes and a
pioneer in discovering ways to
maintain tuna in captivity.
Together, they will combine
their goals of researching and dis
playing tuna in an effort to con
serve them.
"We work on animals that are
fascinating to a lot of people,"
Block said, but added, "the love of
eating tuna and other fish has led
to a point where these fishes are
in a crisis on the high seas."
One factor leading to the
decrease in the tuna population is
its migrating patterns, Block said.
The warm-blooded fish travel
across thousands of miles of
ocean, searching for warm waters.
"The biggest problem is one of
management," she said. "How

does one manage a fish that has
no country? Tuna travel across
the oceans, so there's no bound
ary run by any particular country.
.. .Whichever country wants to
take the most fish can do it."
The researchers — with the
help of students interested in
physiology — are using DNA test
ing in the lab and tracking devices
at sea to determine where certain
tuna are going as well as to chart
the water temperatures in which
they swim.
"The TRCC offers a great
chance to combine field work with
lab study," said Dave Marcinek, a
grad student working at Block's
lab.
Block's team has discovered
that regardless of which part of
the ocean they are in, tuna consis
tently locate areas with tempera
tures around 18.8 degrees Cel
sius.
It's as if "they're wearing ther
mometers in their brains and in

their snouts to track water tem
perature," Block said. "They keep
it within one-tenth of a degree.
They're so consistent that we
could use them to tell us where
the warm water is."
Knowledge about the tempera
tures tuna prefer allows
researchers to design facilities
like the TRCC that are suitable
for keeping tuna in captivity.
The center is equipped with an
intricate heating and biological
filtration system. Inside, there
are three large tanks that each
hold more than 50, 6- to 8-lb. yel
lowfin tuna. This environment
will allow researchers to help pre
vent extinction by learning more
about how tuna work, particular
ly how and why they stay warm.
"It's a mystery in physiology
how tuna, and warm-blooded
mammals in general, stay warm
and mechanistically elevate body
temperature," Block said.
While studying how tuna

maintain heat, she made a discov
ery which may lead to a cure for
fatal fever, a disease caused by the
over-production of calcium in
humans.
Thus, while humans may be
able to help tuna, tuna may also
be able to help humans. One step
towards this mutually beneficial
relationship is through education,
Block said.
"People can't get excited about
the problem of tuna," she said.
"All they can do is eat it out of a
can and say it's delicious, because
they don't know there's a prob
lem."
To help educate the public, the
Aquarium will display 150 tuna
(held in a million-gallon tank) in
an outer-bay exhibit which will
host more than two million visi
tors annually. The TRCC staff
said they are confident the display
will be ready by the spring of 1996.
"Just one-and-a-half months
ago we got this Center," said Car

olyn Darrow, senior aquarist and
one of the three biologists work
ing at the TRCC. "Already the
fish are adapting well. It shows
what a great facility this is."
Progress will continue as
Block's physiological research
gives further insight into main
taining tuna in captivity.
The importance of such
research is gaining increased
international recognition, Darrow
said. Countries like Panama and
Japan are also currently engaged
in research.
"We have to start thinking
about what are responsible inter
national policies for limiting over
fishing," Block said. While she
believes tuna can still be con
sumed, Block added, "what one
has to question is why do tuna
cost $16 per pound. We have to at
least be aware that the demand
for fish is higher than the supply,
and in most cases, that means
they are being over-fished."
