# Years of protest may finally yield progress for EV
## Some residents doubt University action 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
After years of student com
plaints about deteriorating facili
ties and the aging of Escondido
Village, administrators have re
cently begun taking steps to ad
dress graduate housing problems.
Students, however, remain skep
tical and feel that University
promises may be a "quick fix"
aimed at getting the living condi
tions of Escondido out of the spot
light.
The move includes a new
timetable for improving Escondi
do maintenance services and the
formation of a review group —
which will include Escondido resi
dents — to study the exact nature
of new services, some of which will
hopefully be implemented before

the end of the
academic year,
said Associate Di
rector of Housing
and Dining Ser
vices Rodger
Whitney.
The plan also
addresses the
long-term toll
that aging has

taken on the Escondido facility.
Whitney said proactive mainte
nance may be necessary because
of the facility's "evolution" over
the last 30 years, since housing
usually requires more frequent
inspections as time goes on.
Despite administrative efforts,
however, some students still won
der whether maintenance will in

deed improve and, even if it does,
whether the changes will get at
the root of the problem.
This quarter, many residents
— particularly those living in
family apartments — became so
enraged at housing conditions
that they took their complaints
straight to the top, demanding
and receiving meetings with Vice
Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds and other
housing officials.
The new proposal came shortly
after these meetings. "I want
those apartments clean and main
tained, and I can give you my
word ... they will be in the very
near future," Whitney said.
"That's what we're working on."
But there are also problems
that go beyond general mainte
nance concerns.
For years, students have said
that they feel Escondido rent is
too high, with not enough money
going back into maintaining and
improving the apartments — a
problem that is particularly
important in light of a recent
study showing that many stu
dents who now live off-campus
would live on-campus if facilities
were upgraded. Armed with a
new plan, both administrators
and Escondido residents are gear
ing up to address students' con
cerns.
In the end, however, the long
history of complaints and the
multitude of concerns indicate
that what both students and
administrators may not realize is
that the problems may not be so
easy to solve.
Getting started
In an interview last Friday,
Whitney announced a timetable
for his new maintenance inspec
tion program, beginning as early
as next month when students
move out at the end of the quar
ter.
The administrative solution
includes implementing an annual
inspection of all apartments and
providing a preventative mainte
nance campaign — in the form of
"SWAT teams" to repair such
problems as leaky faucets — by
the end of the academic year,
Whitney said.
"I don't want to wait until next
fall," he said. "I want to be sure
that everything is in place by
then."
Whitney added that the inspec
tion teams will involve Escondido
residents. "T have already told my
staff that I want to have some of
the family members who were
concerned about this come with
us when we turn these apart
ments over," he said.
In the past, residents have had
problems with the request-based
maintenance system — some
thing the annual inspection plan
will hopefully alleviate.
"It's the landlord's job to make
sure the room is up to standard,"
said Escondido Village Family
Council member Benson Honig.
Finally, Whitney said he hopes
to complete the Capital Improve
ment Plan two years earlier than
scheduled. The plan will eventual
ly renovate all apartments in
Escondido.
"I'd like to get these apart
ments renovated in six years if we
can do it and we're already on
year three," Whitney said.
A total of 250 apartments have
been renovated to date and Whit
ney said he estimates over a third
of the 1,300 apartments in Escon
dido will be finished by the end of

August.
Many students, however, won
der why such measures were not
implemented earlier, considering
some of the Escondido buildings
are over 30 years old.
"All of the things in the Capital
Improvement Program are rou
tine maintenance that should
have been done over the past 15
years," said Jim Hansen, chair of
the Escondido Village Family
Council.
Some of the problems may be a
result of underfunding in the late
19705, said Assistant Dean of
Graduate Affairs George Dekker.
"The maintenance back then
wasn't attended to and now we're
playing catch-up," he said.
Whitney said the old way of
maintenance — where work was
done on request, or when an
apartment was turned over after
four years — was adequate in the
past. Now that apartments are
becoming older, however, the
administration must be more
"maintenance-oriented and seize
the issues more than we have in
the past," he said.
But housing problems are not
confined to long-term problems.
Over the past few years many of
the problems of cleaning and
maintenance were due to "back
to-back" situations — when main
tenance crews have very little
time to clean an apartment after
one tenant leaves and before
another arrives, Whitney said.
The problem results in part
from University efforts to give
students more flexibility by allow
ing them to move in early or move
out late, he explained.
"It's not a system of neglect
but a system of flexibility," he
said "Cleaning gets left to be the
end of the food chain."
Whitney said he hopes to work
with students to "create more
windows" for cleaning while
ensuring them flexibility.
In addition, during this busy
change-over period — when
approximately 500 apartments
are turned over in three weeks —
the University has to temporarily
hire outside cleaning crews who

are not held to the same high
standards as Stanford staff, Whit
ney said.
In the late 1980s and early
19905, for example, all the clean
ing and maintenance work was
managed by outside contractors
and was not up to Stanford stan
dards, Whitney said.
"We want to get away from hir
ing outside contractors, people
who are, frankly, used to cleaning
offices," he said, adding if the
University has to resort to using
outside staff, the crews will now
be rigorously supervised by Stan
ford staff.
One of the solutions to this
problem is to hire more Universi
ty staff, Dekker said. He added,
however, that in order to keep

rent as low as possible, Housing
and Dining Services currently has
to work with "as lean a staff as
possible and this can often get
stretched."
"Those are fundamental prob
lems you can correct by throwing
a great deal of money at it,"he
said.
Further questions
Although increased inspections
will likely quell some student con
cerns, Whitney admitted that
Escondido residents may still ask
several serious housing questions.
Among these are queries about
rental-price fairness and Escondi
do's diversity. The facility houses
1,200 singles, 450 couples and 340
families, and the administration
must devise a unified strategy to
accommodate all of their concerns
— a task which Whitney said has
proven particularly difficult in the
past.
Although there are nearly four
times as many singles as families,
it is the latter group that consis
tently appear to be communicat
ing their problems to the Univer
sity.
This phenomenon happens
mainly because families stay
longer since they are guaranteed
housing for four years — meaning
that they must live with the prob
lems for a longer period of time, in
addition to developing a larger
perspective on maintenance
issues.
There are fewer complaints
from single graduates because
they are only in the apartments
for a year and know they can live
somewhere different next year,
agreed Escondido graduate resi
dent assistant Sanford Dickert.
"Singles are very transient —
that is why you will not hear the
same outrage," he said.
But Dickert added he believes
problems do exist in Escondido
and that some graduates leave
Stanford with a poor view of hous
ing.
Director of Graduate Resi
dences Chris Griffith said she
realizes that not enough is done to
help residents communicate their

transient — that is •<
why you will not hear
the same outrage.'

problems, and is considering
printing information about hous
ing in different languages to
accommodate the large popula
tion of foreign students living in
Escondido.
"We need to do a better job at
telling them who they need to call
and when they can expect to hear
back from us," she said.
Housing and Dining Services is
also in the process of forming a
Village Operations Review Group
to allow administrators to work
with students on each of these
issues, Griffith said.
The group will be a subcommit
tee of the Graduate Housing
Action Committee, which cur
rently reviews graduate housing
issues in general, and will work on

problems specific to Escondido
Village.
"We want students to help us
find the best way to do this. We
want to do it as easily for you as
we can and as nondisruptively as
we can to your apartment," Whit
ney said.
But Dickert said he does not
believe that single graduates
would notice any disruption
because they spend little time in
their apartments during the day.
"The cabling crew came in a
week ago and I never saw them,"
he said.
Some residents said they are
skeptical about the committee
approach to solving maintenance
problems.
Escondido resident Chris
Shockman said she believes main
tenance issues should be a rudi
mentary matter for the staff.
"It's an interesting concept to
join a committee to talk about jan
itor work. People here are study
ing and have other things to do
with their time," she said
Cost of living
For a number of years, stu
dents living in Escondido have felt
that the rent is too high while not
enough of the money generated
goes back into maintaining and
improving the apartments.
The issue of high rents is not
new to Stanford. Ten years ago,
about 200 graduate students
protested outside then-University
President Donald Kennedy's
office about proposed Escondido
rent increases of 10.85 percent,
which brought the cost of a one
bedroom apartment to $439 per
month.
Currently, some students say
they feel that the rents at Stan
ford aren't comparable to local
housing prices or to graduate
housing at other universities.
This year, the cost of a one
bedroom apartment including
furnishings and utilities averages
out to be about $705 per month
for singles, and $738 for couples
and families, although rates
change from quarter to quarter.
"They need to take a real hard
look at what they're charging fam
ilies," said Family Council member
Honig. "Why are we paying twice
as much as [at] Berkeley?"
The rent for a one-bedroom
graduate apartment at UC-Berke
ley ranges between $263 and $446
a month, said UC-Berkeley Fami
ly Housing Assignment Coordina
tor Cephas John. This price, how
ever, does not necessarily include
utilities or furniture, and the
apartment may be located up to
three miles from the center of
campus.
As another example, Princeton
charges $520 a month for a one
bedroom apartment not including
utilities, said Princeton's Assis
tant Director of Housing Patricia
McArdel.
Honig added that, for the same
price he pays to live in Escondido,
he believes he could get a nicer
apartment in Palo Alto.
But Whitney said the housing
rents at Stanford have remained
at 20 to 25 percent lower than
local market rents. He also assert
ed that annual University studies
show that graduate housing
expenses are in line with other
schools comparable to Stanford.
"The schools that Stanford
competes with for graduate stu
dents are all in expensive commu
nities. . . . Stanford is not unique
in that regard," he said.
Stanford graduate students
said they also worry about the
apparent inequity of the rents
charged within Escondido.
Although the Capital Improve
ment Program is underway, it will

be at least three more years before
it is completed. In the meantime
renovated apartments are sitting
next door to unrenovated apart
ments, both at the same rent.
"I was just amazed at the bit
terness of the new people moving
into unrenovated apartments and
finding they were paying the same
rent as their neighbors living in
renovated ones," Shockman said.
In response, Whitney said that
"the basic costs remain the same"
whether tenants live in a renovat
ed or an unrenovated apartment.
He added that this means stu
dents on a tighter budget have the
same choices as others about
where to live.
"Stanford, for a long time, has
had a philosophy that we don't
want to 'ghettoize' students about
rent issues," he said.
Dekker said he believes that
the buildings that haven't been
rehabilitated could have the rents
lowered, although he admitted
this would have to occur at the
expense of students in better
buildings.
Until the Capital Improvement

Plan is complete, however, some
students living in Escondido look
at Rains with its green gardens
and modern Spanish style apart
ments and wonder why more
money cannot be put into bringing
Escondido up to that standard.
But students may not realize
that the housing debt — which is
incurred when new housing is
built — is spread between gradu
ates and undergraduates, Whit
ney said. The debt service is a
"fair cycle," meaning that 50 per
cent of the Capital Improvement
Campaign goes to graduate stu
dent housing, with 60 percent of
that directed to Escondido Vil
lage, he added.
Although undergraduate hous
ing has received more attention in
the last few years, Whitney said
the cycle is shifting. For example,
two new graduate residences are
scheduled to be built in the near
future, one by Governors' Corner
and one in place of the Manzanita
trailers.
Outside alternatives?
But as new residences are
being built, some said they won
der if Stanford is providing too
much student housing.
Three years ago, the Universi
ty made the shift to guaranteeing
housing to all undergraduates,
and currently 50 percent of grad
uates are provided with Universi
ty residences.
Stanford has more graduate
student housing than other uni
versities by "a very large margin,"
Dekker said. "What happens is
that Housing and Dining Services
is under two kinds of pressure:
they want to spend money on
maintaining existing residences
but they also want to spend it on
new student housing."

He added he believes it would
be an "attractive" possibility to
have new future residences man
aged by an outside management
company.
"Retrospectively, I personally
think we should do what some
universities do, which is to let pri
vate developers [manage housing]
and let them worry about the
debt," Dekker said.
But Whitney said he believes
that housing managed by Stan
ford is geared more toward meet
ing students needs — providing
facilities like programs for spous
es and housing assignments in
line with the academic calendar —
which a private company would
not necessarily do.
"This is not like housing in an
apartment complex in Mountain
View — it's where people go to
school and we're more concerned
about how we do maintenance
and when we do it,"he explained.
However, a study commis
sioned by Housing and Dining
Services of 500 Stanford graduate
students during May 1993 con
cluded that many students living

'Retrospectively, I
personally think we
should do what
some universities
do, which is to let
private developers
[manage housing]
and let them worry
about the debt.'

off-campus would live on-campus
if the facilities were upgraded.
Over the past six years, there
has been a gradual decline in the
number of students with families
coming to Stanford. In 1988 there
were 525 families living in Escon
dido compared to 344 this year, a
change Shockman said she
believes is due to the high cost of
living here.
But Whitney disagrees with
this philosophy, "I think there is
just a national trend that stu
dents with families are not going
to graduate schools," he said.
Substantial proportions of stu
dents off-campus also indicated in
the study that the "ability to stay
in one place" was an important
factor. Presently, single graduates
have one-year contracts for cam
pus housing.
After struggling for many
years, residents and particularly
the Escondido Village Family
Council — which was formed in
the spring of 1993 to communi
cate more effectively with univer
sity officials — are slowly reach
ing their goals.
And no matter what problems
Escondido residents encounter,
most agree that family facilities,
such as the scheduled new play
ground equipment, and the strong
feeling of community make Escon
dido a good family environment.
Although the University has
now shown a positive response to
residents' concerns, and a com
mitment to provide and maintain
a high standard of accommoda
tion for graduate students in
Escondido, however, the changes
will not occur overnight.
"We're definitely getting some
improvements, but I don't think
the work of the Council is over
yet," Hansen said.


After years of student com
plaints about deteriorating facili
ties and the aging of Escondido
Village, administrators have re
cently begun taking steps to ad
dress graduate housing problems.

But students may not realize
that the housing debt — which is
incurred when new housing is
built — is spread between gradu
ates and undergraduates, Whit
ney said. The debt service is a
"fair cycle," meaning that 50 per
cent of the Capital Improvement
Campaign goes to graduate stu
dent housing, with 60 percent of
that directed to Escondido Vil
lage, he added.
Although undergraduate hous
ing has received more attention in
the last few years, Whitney said
the cycle is shifting. For example,
two new graduate residences are
scheduled to be built in the near
future, one by Governors' Corner
and one in place of the Manzanita
trailers.
Outside alternatives?
But as new residences are
being built, some said they won
der if Stanford is providing too
much student housing.
Three years ago, the Universi
ty made the shift to guaranteeing
housing to all undergraduates,
and currently 50 percent of grad
uates are provided with Universi
ty residences.
Stanford has more graduate
student housing than other uni
versities by "a very large margin,"
Dekker said. "What happens is
that Housing and Dining Services
is under two kinds of pressure:
they want to spend money on
maintaining existing residences
but they also want to spend it on
new student housing."

He added he believes it would
be an "attractive" possibility to
have new future residences man
aged by an outside management
company.
"Retrospectively, I personally
think we should do what some
universities do, which is to let pri
vate developers [manage housing]
and let them worry about the
debt," Dekker said.
But Whitney said he believes
that housing managed by Stan
ford is geared more toward meet
ing students needs — providing
facilities like programs for spous
es and housing assignments in
line with the academic calendar —
which a private company would
not necessarily do.
"This is not like housing in an
apartment complex in Mountain
View — it's where people go to
school and we're more concerned
about how we do maintenance
and when we do it,"he explained.
However, a study commis
sioned by Housing and Dining
Services of 500 Stanford graduate
students during May 1993 con
cluded that many students living

personally think we
should do what
some universities

about the debt.'

off-campus would live on-campus
if the facilities were upgraded.
Over the past six years, there
has been a gradual decline in the
number of students with families
coming to Stanford. In 1988 there
were 525 families living in Escon
dido compared to 344 this year, a
change Shockman said she
believes is due to the high cost of
living here.
But Whitney disagrees with
this philosophy, "I think there is
just a national trend that stu
dents with families are not going
to graduate schools," he said.
Substantial proportions of stu
dents off-campus also indicated in
the study that the "ability to stay
in one place" was an important
factor. Presently, single graduates
have one-year contracts for cam
pus housing.
After struggling for many
years, residents and particularly
the Escondido Village Family
Council — which was formed in
the spring of 1993 to communi
cate more effectively with univer
sity officials — are slowly reach
ing their goals.
And no matter what problems
Escondido residents encounter,
most agree that family facilities,
such as the scheduled new play
ground equipment, and the strong
feeling of community make Escon
dido a good family environment.
Although the University has
now shown a positive response to
residents' concerns, and a com
mitment to provide and maintain
a high standard of accommoda
tion for graduate students in
Escondido, however, the changes
will not occur overnight.
"We're definitely getting some
improvements, but I don't think
the work of the Council is over
yet," Hansen said.


After years of student com
plaints about deteriorating facili
ties and the aging of Escondido
Village, administrators have re
cently begun taking steps to ad
dress graduate housing problems.
Students, however, remain skep
tical and feel that University
promises may be a "quick fix"
aimed at getting the living condi
tions of Escondido out of the spot
light.
The move includes a new
timetable for improving Escondi
do maintenance services and the
formation of a review group —
which will include Escondido resi
dents — to study the exact nature
of new services, some of which will
hopefully be implemented before

the end of the
academic year,
said Associate Di
rector of Housing
and Dining Ser
vices Rodger
Whitney.
The plan also
addresses the
long-term toll
that aging has

taken on the Escondido facility.
Whitney said proactive mainte
nance may be necessary because
of the facility's "evolution" over
the last 30 years, since housing
usually requires more frequent
inspections as time goes on.
Despite administrative efforts,
however, some students still won
der whether maintenance will in


Whitney
deed improve and, even if it does,
whether the changes will get at
the root of the problem.
This quarter, many residents
— particularly those living in
family apartments — became so
enraged at housing conditions
that they took their complaints
straight to the top, demanding
and receiving meetings with Vice
Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds and other
housing officials.
The new proposal came shortly
after these meetings. "I want
those apartments clean and main
tained, and I can give you my
word ... they will be in the very
near future," Whitney said.
"That's what we're working on."
But there are also problems
that go beyond general mainte
nance concerns.
For years, students have said
that they feel Escondido rent is
too high, with not enough money
going back into maintaining and
improving the apartments — a
problem that is particularly
important in light of a recent
study showing that many stu
dents who now live off-campus
would live on-campus if facilities
were upgraded. Armed with a
new plan, both administrators
and Escondido residents are gear
ing up to address students' con
cerns.
In the end, however, the long
history of complaints and the
multitude of concerns indicate
that what both students and
administrators may not realize is
that the problems may not be so
easy to solve.
Getting started
In an interview last Friday,
Whitney announced a timetable
for his new maintenance inspec
tion program, beginning as early
as next month when students
move out at the end of the quar
ter.
The administrative solution
includes implementing an annual
inspection of all apartments and
providing a preventative mainte
nance campaign — in the form of
"SWAT teams" to repair such
problems as leaky faucets — by
the end of the academic year,
Whitney said.
"I don't want to wait until next
fall," he said. "I want to be sure
that everything is in place by
then."
Whitney added that the inspec
tion teams will involve Escondido
residents. "T have already told my
staff that I want to have some of
the family members who were
concerned about this come with
us when we turn these apart
ments over," he said.
In the past, residents have had
problems with the request-based
maintenance system — some
thing the annual inspection plan
will hopefully alleviate.
"It's the landlord's job to make
sure the room is up to standard,"
said Escondido Village Family
Council member Benson Honig.
Finally, Whitney said he hopes
to complete the Capital Improve
ment Plan two years earlier than
scheduled. The plan will eventual
ly renovate all apartments in
Escondido.
"I'd like to get these apart
ments renovated in six years if we
can do it and we're already on
year three," Whitney said.
A total of 250 apartments have
been renovated to date and Whit
ney said he estimates over a third
of the 1,300 apartments in Escon
dido will be finished by the end of

August.
Many students, however, won
der why such measures were not
implemented earlier, considering
some of the Escondido buildings
are over 30 years old.
"All of the things in the Capital
Improvement Program are rou
tine maintenance that should
have been done over the past 15
years," said Jim Hansen, chair of
the Escondido Village Family
Council.
Some of the problems may be a
result of underfunding in the late
19705, said Assistant Dean of
Graduate Affairs George Dekker.
"The maintenance back then
wasn't attended to and now we're
playing catch-up," he said.
Whitney said the old way of
maintenance — where work was
done on request, or when an
apartment was turned over after
four years — was adequate in the
past. Now that apartments are
becoming older, however, the
administration must be more
"maintenance-oriented and seize
the issues more than we have in
the past," he said.
But housing problems are not
confined to long-term problems.
Over the past few years many of
the problems of cleaning and
maintenance were due to "back
to-back" situations — when main
tenance crews have very little
time to clean an apartment after
one tenant leaves and before
another arrives, Whitney said.
The problem results in part
from University efforts to give
students more flexibility by allow
ing them to move in early or move
out late, he explained.
"It's not a system of neglect
but a system of flexibility," he
said "Cleaning gets left to be the
end of the food chain."
Whitney said he hopes to work
with students to "create more
windows" for cleaning while
ensuring them flexibility.
In addition, during this busy
change-over period — when
approximately 500 apartments
are turned over in three weeks —
the University has to temporarily
hire outside cleaning crews who

are not held to the same high
standards as Stanford staff, Whit
ney said.
In the late 1980s and early
19905, for example, all the clean
ing and maintenance work was
managed by outside contractors
and was not up to Stanford stan
dards, Whitney said.
"We want to get away from hir
ing outside contractors, people
who are, frankly, used to cleaning
offices," he said, adding if the
University has to resort to using
outside staff, the crews will now
be rigorously supervised by Stan
ford staff.
One of the solutions to this
problem is to hire more Universi
ty staff, Dekker said. He added,
however, that in order to keep

rent as low as possible, Housing
and Dining Services currently has
to work with "as lean a staff as
possible and this can often get
stretched."
"Those are fundamental prob
lems you can correct by throwing
a great deal of money at it,"he
said.
Further questions
Although increased inspections
will likely quell some student con
cerns, Whitney admitted that
Escondido residents may still ask
several serious housing questions.
Among these are queries about
rental-price fairness and Escondi
do's diversity. The facility houses
1,200 singles, 450 couples and 340
families, and the administration
must devise a unified strategy to
accommodate all of their concerns
— a task which Whitney said has
proven particularly difficult in the
past.
Although there are nearly four
times as many singles as families,
it is the latter group that consis
tently appear to be communicat
ing their problems to the Univer
sity.
This phenomenon happens
mainly because families stay
longer since they are guaranteed
housing for four years — meaning
that they must live with the prob
lems for a longer period of time, in
addition to developing a larger
perspective on maintenance
issues.
There are fewer complaints
from single graduates because
they are only in the apartments
for a year and know they can live
somewhere different next year,
agreed Escondido graduate resi
dent assistant Sanford Dickert.
"Singles are very transient —
that is why you will not hear the
same outrage," he said.
But Dickert added he believes
problems do exist in Escondido
and that some graduates leave
Stanford with a poor view of hous
ing.
Director of Graduate Resi
dences Chris Griffith said she
realizes that not enough is done to
help residents communicate their

transient — that is •<

the same outrage.'

problems, and is considering
printing information about hous
ing in different languages to
accommodate the large popula
tion of foreign students living in
Escondido.
"We need to do a better job at
telling them who they need to call
and when they can expect to hear
back from us," she said.
Housing and Dining Services is
also in the process of forming a
Village Operations Review Group
to allow administrators to work
with students on each of these
issues, Griffith said.
The group will be a subcommit
tee of the Graduate Housing
Action Committee, which cur
rently reviews graduate housing
issues in general, and will work on

problems specific to Escondido
Village.
"We want students to help us
find the best way to do this. We
want to do it as easily for you as
we can and as nondisruptively as
we can to your apartment," Whit
ney said.
But Dickert said he does not
believe that single graduates
would notice any disruption
because they spend little time in
their apartments during the day.
"The cabling crew came in a
week ago and I never saw them,"
he said.
Some residents said they are
skeptical about the committee
approach to solving maintenance
problems.
Escondido resident Chris
Shockman said she believes main
tenance issues should be a rudi
mentary matter for the staff.
"It's an interesting concept to
join a committee to talk about jan
itor work. People here are study
ing and have other things to do
with their time," she said
Cost of living
For a number of years, stu
dents living in Escondido have felt
that the rent is too high while not
enough of the money generated
goes back into maintaining and
improving the apartments.
The issue of high rents is not
new to Stanford. Ten years ago,
about 200 graduate students
protested outside then-University
President Donald Kennedy's
office about proposed Escondido
rent increases of 10.85 percent,
which brought the cost of a one
bedroom apartment to $439 per
month.
Currently, some students say
they feel that the rents at Stan
ford aren't comparable to local
housing prices or to graduate
housing at other universities.
This year, the cost of a one
bedroom apartment including
furnishings and utilities averages
out to be about $705 per month
for singles, and $738 for couples
and families, although rates
change from quarter to quarter.
"They need to take a real hard
look at what they're charging fam
ilies," said Family Council member
Honig. "Why are we paying twice
as much as [at] Berkeley?"
The rent for a one-bedroom
graduate apartment at UC-Berke
ley ranges between $263 and $446
a month, said UC-Berkeley Fami
ly Housing Assignment Coordina
tor Cephas John. This price, how
ever, does not necessarily include
utilities or furniture, and the
apartment may be located up to
three miles from the center of
campus.
As another example, Princeton
charges $520 a month for a one
bedroom apartment not including
utilities, said Princeton's Assis
tant Director of Housing Patricia
McArdel.
Honig added that, for the same
price he pays to live in Escondido,
he believes he could get a nicer
apartment in Palo Alto.
But Whitney said the housing
rents at Stanford have remained
at 20 to 25 percent lower than
local market rents. He also assert
ed that annual University studies
show that graduate housing
expenses are in line with other
schools comparable to Stanford.
"The schools that Stanford
competes with for graduate stu
dents are all in expensive commu
nities. . . . Stanford is not unique
in that regard," he said.
Stanford graduate students
said they also worry about the
apparent inequity of the rents
charged within Escondido.
Although the Capital Improve
ment Program is underway, it will

be at least three more years before
it is completed. In the meantime
renovated apartments are sitting
next door to unrenovated apart
ments, both at the same rent.
"I was just amazed at the bit
terness of the new people moving
into unrenovated apartments and
finding they were paying the same
rent as their neighbors living in
renovated ones," Shockman said.
In response, Whitney said that
"the basic costs remain the same"
whether tenants live in a renovat
ed or an unrenovated apartment.
He added that this means stu
dents on a tighter budget have the
same choices as others about
where to live.
"Stanford, for a long time, has
had a philosophy that we don't
want to 'ghettoize' students about
rent issues," he said.
Dekker said he believes that
the buildings that haven't been
rehabilitated could have the rents
lowered, although he admitted
this would have to occur at the
expense of students in better
buildings.
Until the Capital Improvement

Plan is complete, however, some
students living in Escondido look
at Rains with its green gardens
and modern Spanish style apart
ments and wonder why more
money cannot be put into bringing
Escondido up to that standard.
But students may not realize
that the housing debt — which is
incurred when new housing is
built — is spread between gradu
ates and undergraduates, Whit
ney said. The debt service is a
"fair cycle," meaning that 50 per
cent of the Capital Improvement
Campaign goes to graduate stu
dent housing, with 60 percent of
that directed to Escondido Vil
lage, he added.
Although undergraduate hous
ing has received more attention in
the last few years, Whitney said

two new graduate residences are
scheduled to be built in the near
future, one by Governors' Corner
and one in place of the Manzanita
trailers.

week ago and I never saw them,"
he said.
Some residents said they are
skeptical about the committee
approach to solving maintenance
problems.
Escondido resident Chris
Shockman said she believes main
tenance issues should be a rudi
mentary matter for the staff.
"It's an interesting concept to
join a committee to talk about jan
itor work. People here are study
ing and have other things to do
with their time," she said
Cost of living
For a number of years, stu
dents living in Escondido have felt
that the rent is too high while not
enough of the money generated
goes back into maintaining and
improving the apartments.
The issue of high rents is not
new to Stanford. Ten years ago,
about 200 graduate students
protested outside then-University
President Donald Kennedy's
office about proposed Escondido
rent increases of 10.85 percent,
which brought the cost of a one
bedroom apartment to $439 per
month.
Currently, some students say
they feel that the rents at Stan
ford aren't comparable to local
housing prices or to graduate
housing at other universities.
This year, the cost of a one
bedroom apartment including
furnishings and utilities averages
out to be about $705 per month
for singles, and $738 for couples
and families, although rates
change from quarter to quarter.
"They need to take a real hard
look at what they're charging fam
ilies," said Family Council member
Honig. "Why are we paying twice
as much as [at] Berkeley?"
The rent for a one-bedroom
graduate apartment at UC-Berke
ley ranges between $263 and $446
a month, said UC-Berkeley Fami
ly Housing Assignment Coordina
tor Cephas John. This price, how
ever, does not necessarily include
utilities or furniture, and the
apartment may be located up to
three miles from the center of
campus.
As another example, Princeton
charges $520 a month for a one
bedroom apartment not including
utilities, said Princeton's Assis
tant Director of Housing Patricia
McArdel.
Honig added that, for the same
price he pays to live in Escondido,
he believes he could get a nicer
apartment in Palo Alto.
But Whitney said the housing
rents at Stanford have remained
at 20 to 25 percent lower than
local market rents. He also assert
ed that annual University studies
show that graduate housing
expenses are in line with other
schools comparable to Stanford.
"The schools that Stanford
competes with for graduate stu
dents are all in expensive commu
nities. . . . Stanford is not unique
in that regard," he said.
Stanford graduate students
said they also worry about the
apparent inequity of the rents
charged within Escondido.
Although the Capital Improve
ment Program is underway, it will

be at least three more years before
it is completed. In the meantime
renovated apartments are sitting
next door to unrenovated apart
ments, both at the same rent.
"I was just amazed at the bit
terness of the new people moving
into unrenovated apartments and
finding they were paying the same
rent as their neighbors living in
renovated ones," Shockman said.
In response, Whitney said that
"the basic costs remain the same"
whether tenants live in a renovat
ed or an unrenovated apartment.
He added that this means stu
dents on a tighter budget have the
same choices as others about
where to live.
"Stanford, for a long time, has
had a philosophy that we don't
want to 'ghettoize' students about
rent issues," he said.
Dekker said he believes that
the buildings that haven't been
rehabilitated could have the rents
lowered, although he admitted
this would have to occur at the
expense of students in better
buildings.
Until the Capital Improvement

Plan is complete, however, some
students living in Escondido look
at Rains with its green gardens
and modern Spanish style apart
ments and wonder why more
money cannot be put into bringing
Escondido up to that standard.
But students may not realize
that the housing debt — which is
incurred when new housing is
built — is spread between gradu
ates and undergraduates, Whit
ney said. The debt service is a
"fair cycle," meaning that 50 per
cent of the Capital Improvement
Campaign goes to graduate stu
dent housing, with 60 percent of
that directed to Escondido Vil
lage, he added.
Although undergraduate hous
ing has received more attention in
the last few years, Whitney said
the cycle is shifting. For example,
two new graduate residences are
scheduled to be built in the near
future, one by Governors' Corner
and one in place of the Manzanita
trailers.
Outside alternatives?
But as new residences are
being built, some said they won
der if Stanford is providing too
much student housing.
Three years ago, the Universi
ty made the shift to guaranteeing
housing to all undergraduates,
and currently 50 percent of grad
uates are provided with Universi
ty residences.
Stanford has more graduate
student housing than other uni
versities by "a very large margin,"
Dekker said. "What happens is
that Housing and Dining Services
is under two kinds of pressure:
they want to spend money on
maintaining existing residences
but they also want to spend it on
new student housing."

He added he believes it would
be an "attractive" possibility to
have new future residences man
aged by an outside management
company.
"Retrospectively, I personally
think we should do what some
universities do, which is to let pri
vate developers [manage housing]
and let them worry about the
debt," Dekker said.
But Whitney said he believes
that housing managed by Stan
ford is geared more toward meet
ing students needs — providing
facilities like programs for spous
es and housing assignments in
line with the academic calendar —
which a private company would
not necessarily do.
"This is not like housing in an
apartment complex in Mountain
View — it's where people go to
school and we're more concerned
about how we do maintenance
and when we do it,"he explained.
However, a study commis
sioned by Housing and Dining
Services of 500 Stanford graduate
students during May 1993 con
cluded that many students living

'Retrospectively, I
personally think we
should do what
some universities
do, which is to let
private developers
[manage housing]
and let them worry
about the debt.'

off-campus would live on-campus
if the facilities were upgraded.
Over the past six years, there
has been a gradual decline in the
number of students with families
coming to Stanford. In 1988 there
were 525 families living in Escon
dido compared to 344 this year, a
change Shockman said she
believes is due to the high cost of
living here.
But Whitney disagrees with
this philosophy, "I think there is
just a national trend that stu
dents with families are not going
to graduate schools," he said.
Substantial proportions of stu
dents off-campus also indicated in
the study that the "ability to stay
in one place" was an important
factor. Presently, single graduates
have one-year contracts for cam
pus housing.
After struggling for many
years, residents and particularly
the Escondido Village Family
Council — which was formed in
the spring of 1993 to communi
cate more effectively with univer
sity officials — are slowly reach
ing their goals.
And no matter what problems
Escondido residents encounter,
most agree that family facilities,
such as the scheduled new play
ground equipment, and the strong
feeling of community make Escon
dido a good family environment.
Although the University has
now shown a positive response to
residents' concerns, and a com
mitment to provide and maintain
a high standard of accommoda
tion for graduate students in
Escondido, however, the changes
will not occur overnight.
"We're definitely getting some
improvements, but I don't think
the work of the Council is over
yet," Hansen said.


After years of student com
plaints about deteriorating facili
ties and the aging of Escondido
Village, administrators have re
cently begun taking steps to ad
dress graduate housing problems.
Students, however, remain skep
tical and feel that University
promises may be a "quick fix"
aimed at getting the living condi
tions of Escondido out of the spot
light.
The move includes a new
timetable for improving Escondi
do maintenance services and the
formation of a review group —
which will include Escondido resi
dents — to study the exact nature
of new services, some of which will
hopefully be implemented before

the end of the
academic year,
said Associate Di
rector of Housing
and Dining Ser
vices Rodger
Whitney.
The plan also
addresses the
long-term toll
that aging has

taken on the Escondido facility.
Whitney said proactive mainte
nance may be necessary because
of the facility's "evolution" over
the last 30 years, since housing
usually requires more frequent
inspections as time goes on.
Despite administrative efforts,
however, some students still won
der whether maintenance will in


Whitney
deed improve and, even if it does,
whether the changes will get at
the root of the problem.
This quarter, many residents
— particularly those living in
family apartments — became so
enraged at housing conditions
that they took their complaints
straight to the top, demanding
and receiving meetings with Vice
Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds and other
housing officials.
The new proposal came shortly
after these meetings. "I want
those apartments clean and main
tained, and I can give you my
word ... they will be in the very
near future," Whitney said.
"That's what we're working on."
But there are also problems
that go beyond general mainte
nance concerns.
For years, students have said
that they feel Escondido rent is
too high, with not enough money
going back into maintaining and
improving the apartments — a
problem that is particularly
important in light of a recent
study showing that many stu
dents who now live off-campus
would live on-campus if facilities
were upgraded. Armed with a
new plan, both administrators
and Escondido residents are gear
ing up to address students' con
cerns.
In the end, however, the long
history of complaints and the
multitude of concerns indicate
that what both students and
administrators may not realize is
that the problems may not be so
easy to solve.
Getting started
In an interview last Friday,
Whitney announced a timetable
for his new maintenance inspec
tion program, beginning as early
as next month when students
move out at the end of the quar
ter.
The administrative solution
includes implementing an annual
inspection of all apartments and
providing a preventative mainte
nance campaign — in the form of
"SWAT teams" to repair such
problems as leaky faucets — by
the end of the academic year,
Whitney said.
"I don't want to wait until next
fall," he said. "I want to be sure
that everything is in place by
then."
Whitney added that the inspec
tion teams will involve Escondido
residents. "T have already told my
staff that I want to have some of
the family members who were
concerned about this come with
us when we turn these apart
ments over," he said.
In the past, residents have had
problems with the request-based
maintenance system — some
thing the annual inspection plan
will hopefully alleviate.
"It's the landlord's job to make
sure the room is up to standard,"
said Escondido Village Family
Council member Benson Honig.
Finally, Whitney said he hopes
to complete the Capital Improve
ment Plan two years earlier than
scheduled. The plan will eventual
ly renovate all apartments in
Escondido.
"I'd like to get these apart
ments renovated in six years if we
can do it and we're already on
year three," Whitney said.
A total of 250 apartments have
been renovated to date and Whit
ney said he estimates over a third
of the 1,300 apartments in Escon
dido will be finished by the end of

August.
Many students, however, won
der why such measures were not
implemented earlier, considering
some of the Escondido buildings
are over 30 years old.
"All of the things in the Capital
Improvement Program are rou
tine maintenance that should
have been done over the past 15
years," said Jim Hansen, chair of
the Escondido Village Family
Council.
Some of the problems may be a
result of underfunding in the late
19705, said Assistant Dean of
Graduate Affairs George Dekker.
"The maintenance back then
wasn't attended to and now we're
playing catch-up," he said.
Whitney said the old way of
maintenance — where work was
done on request, or when an
apartment was turned over after
four years — was adequate in the
past. Now that apartments are
becoming older, however, the
administration must be more
"maintenance-oriented and seize
the issues more than we have in
the past," he said.
But housing problems are not
confined to long-term problems.
Over the past few years many of
the problems of cleaning and
maintenance were due to "back
to-back" situations — when main
tenance crews have very little
time to clean an apartment after
one tenant leaves and before
another arrives, Whitney said.
The problem results in part
from University efforts to give
students more flexibility by allow
ing them to move in early or move
out late, he explained.
"It's not a system of neglect
but a system of flexibility," he
said "Cleaning gets left to be the
end of the food chain."
Whitney said he hopes to work
with students to "create more
windows" for cleaning while
ensuring them flexibility.
In addition, during this busy
change-over period — when
approximately 500 apartments
are turned over in three weeks —
the University has to temporarily
hire outside cleaning crews who

are not held to the same high
standards as Stanford staff, Whit
ney said.
In the late 1980s and early
19905, for example, all the clean
ing and maintenance work was
managed by outside contractors
and was not up to Stanford stan
dards, Whitney said.
"We want to get away from hir
ing outside contractors, people
who are, frankly, used to cleaning
offices," he said, adding if the
University has to resort to using
outside staff, the crews will now
be rigorously supervised by Stan
ford staff.
One of the solutions to this
problem is to hire more Universi
ty staff, Dekker said. He added,
however, that in order to keep

rent as low as possible, Housing
and Dining Services currently has
to work with "as lean a staff as
possible and this can often get
stretched."
"Those are fundamental prob
lems you can correct by throwing
a great deal of money at it,"he
said.
Further questions
Although increased inspections
will likely quell some student con
cerns, Whitney admitted that
Escondido residents may still ask
several serious housing questions.
Among these are queries about
rental-price fairness and Escondi
do's diversity. The facility houses
1,200 singles, 450 couples and 340
families, and the administration
must devise a unified strategy to
accommodate all of their concerns
— a task which Whitney said has
proven particularly difficult in the
past.
Although there are nearly four
times as many singles as families,
it is the latter group that consis
tently appear to be communicat
ing their problems to the Univer
sity.
This phenomenon happens
mainly because families stay
longer since they are guaranteed
housing for four years — meaning
that they must live with the prob
lems for a longer period of time, in
addition to developing a larger
perspective on maintenance
issues.
There are fewer complaints
from single graduates because
they are only in the apartments
for a year and know they can live
somewhere different next year,
agreed Escondido graduate resi
dent assistant Sanford Dickert.
"Singles are very transient —
that is why you will not hear the
same outrage," he said.
But Dickert added he believes
problems do exist in Escondido
and that some graduates leave
Stanford with a poor view of hous
ing.
Director of Graduate Resi
dences Chris Griffith said she
realizes that not enough is done to
help residents communicate their

problems, and is considering
printing information about hous
ing in different languages to
accommodate the large popula
tion of foreign students living in
Escondido.
"We need to do a better job at
telling them who they need to call
and when they can expect to hear
back from us," she said.
Housing and Dining Services is
also in the process of forming a
Village Operations Review Group
to allow administrators to work
with students on each of these
issues, Griffith said.
The group will be a subcommit
tee of the Graduate Housing
Action Committee, which cur
rently reviews graduate housing
issues in general, and will work on

problems specific to Escondido
Village.
"We want students to help us
find the best way to do this. We
want to do it as easily for you as
we can and as nondisruptively as
we can to your apartment," Whit
ney said.
But Dickert said he does not
believe that single graduates
would notice any disruption
because they spend little time in
their apartments during the day.
"The cabling crew came in a
week ago and I never saw them,"
he said.
Some residents said they are
skeptical about the committee
approach to solving maintenance
problems.
Escondido resident Chris
Shockman said she believes main
tenance issues should be a rudi
mentary matter for the staff.
"It's an interesting concept to
join a committee to talk about jan
itor work. People here are study

but a system of flexibility," he
said "Cleaning gets left to be the
end of the food chain."
Whitney said he hopes to work
with students to "create more
windows" for cleaning while
ensuring them flexibility.
In addition, during this busy
change-over period — when
approximately 500 apartments
are turned over in three weeks —
the University has to temporarily
hire outside cleaning crews who

are not held to the same high
standards as Stanford staff, Whit
ney said.
In the late 1980s and early
19905, for example, all the clean
ing and maintenance work was
managed by outside contractors
and was not up to Stanford stan
dards, Whitney said.
"We want to get away from hir
ing outside contractors, people
who are, frankly, used to cleaning
offices," he said, adding if the
University has to resort to using
outside staff, the crews will now
be rigorously supervised by Stan
ford staff.
One of the solutions to this
problem is to hire more Universi
ty staff, Dekker said. He added,
however, that in order to keep

rent as low as possible, Housing
and Dining Services currently has
to work with "as lean a staff as
possible and this can often get
stretched."
"Those are fundamental prob
lems you can correct by throwing
a great deal of money at it,"he
said.
Further questions
Although increased inspections
will likely quell some student con
cerns, Whitney admitted that
Escondido residents may still ask
several serious housing questions.
Among these are queries about
rental-price fairness and Escondi
do's diversity. The facility houses
1,200 singles, 450 couples and 340
families, and the administration
must devise a unified strategy to
accommodate all of their concerns
— a task which Whitney said has
proven particularly difficult in the
past.
Although there are nearly four
times as many singles as families,
it is the latter group that consis
tently appear to be communicat
ing their problems to the Univer
sity.
This phenomenon happens
mainly because families stay
longer since they are guaranteed
housing for four years — meaning
that they must live with the prob
lems for a longer period of time, in
addition to developing a larger
perspective on maintenance
issues.
There are fewer complaints
from single graduates because
they are only in the apartments
for a year and know they can live
somewhere different next year,
agreed Escondido graduate resi
dent assistant Sanford Dickert.
"Singles are very transient —
that is why you will not hear the
same outrage," he said.
But Dickert added he believes
problems do exist in Escondido
and that some graduates leave
Stanford with a poor view of hous
ing.
Director of Graduate Resi
dences Chris Griffith said she
realizes that not enough is done to
help residents communicate their

problems, and is considering
printing information about hous
ing in different languages to
accommodate the large popula
tion of foreign students living in
Escondido.
"We need to do a better job at
telling them who they need to call
and when they can expect to hear
back from us," she said.
Housing and Dining Services is
also in the process of forming a
Village Operations Review Group
to allow administrators to work
with students on each of these
issues, Griffith said.
The group will be a subcommit
tee of the Graduate Housing
Action Committee, which cur
rently reviews graduate housing
issues in general, and will work on

problems specific to Escondido
Village.
"We want students to help us
find the best way to do this. We
want to do it as easily for you as
we can and as nondisruptively as
we can to your apartment," Whit
ney said.
But Dickert said he does not
believe that single graduates
would notice any disruption
because they spend little time in
their apartments during the day.
"The cabling crew came in a
week ago and I never saw them,"
he said.
Some residents said they are
skeptical about the committee
approach to solving maintenance
problems.
Escondido resident Chris
Shockman said she believes main
tenance issues should be a rudi
mentary matter for the staff.
"It's an interesting concept to
join a committee to talk about jan
itor work. People here are study
ing and have other things to do
with their time," she said
Cost of living
For a number of years, stu
dents living in Escondido have felt
that the rent is too high while not
enough of the money generated
goes back into maintaining and
improving the apartments.
The issue of high rents is not
new to Stanford. Ten years ago,
about 200 graduate students
protested outside then-University
President Donald Kennedy's
office about proposed Escondido
rent increases of 10.85 percent,
which brought the cost of a one
bedroom apartment to $439 per
month.
Currently, some students say
they feel that the rents at Stan
ford aren't comparable to local
housing prices or to graduate
housing at other universities.
This year, the cost of a one
bedroom apartment including
furnishings and utilities averages
out to be about $705 per month
for singles, and $738 for couples
and families, although rates
change from quarter to quarter.
"They need to take a real hard
look at what they're charging fam
ilies," said Family Council member
Honig. "Why are we paying twice
as much as [at] Berkeley?"
The rent for a one-bedroom
graduate apartment at UC-Berke
ley ranges between $263 and $446
a month, said UC-Berkeley Fami
ly Housing Assignment Coordina
tor Cephas John. This price, how
ever, does not necessarily include
utilities or furniture, and the
apartment may be located up to
three miles from the center of
campus.
As another example, Princeton
charges $520 a month for a one
bedroom apartment not including
utilities, said Princeton's Assis
tant Director of Housing Patricia
McArdel.
Honig added that, for the same
price he pays to live in Escondido,
he believes he could get a nicer
apartment in Palo Alto.
But Whitney said the housing
rents at Stanford have remained
at 20 to 25 percent lower than
local market rents. He also assert
ed that annual University studies
show that graduate housing
expenses are in line with other
schools comparable to Stanford.
"The schools that Stanford
competes with for graduate stu
dents are all in expensive commu
nities. . . . Stanford is not unique
in that regard," he said.
Stanford graduate students
said they also worry about the
apparent inequity of the rents
charged within Escondido.
Although the Capital Improve
ment Program is underway, it will

be at least three more years before
it is completed. In the meantime
renovated apartments are sitting
next door to unrenovated apart
ments, both at the same rent.
"I was just amazed at the bit
terness of the new people moving
into unrenovated apartments and
finding they were paying the same
rent as their neighbors living in
renovated ones," Shockman said.
In response, Whitney said that
"the basic costs remain the same"
whether tenants live in a renovat
ed or an unrenovated apartment.
He added that this means stu
dents on a tighter budget have the
same choices as others about
where to live.
"Stanford, for a long time, has
had a philosophy that we don't
want to 'ghettoize' students about
rent issues," he said.
Dekker said he believes that
the buildings that haven't been
rehabilitated could have the rents
lowered, although he admitted
this would have to occur at the
expense of students in better
buildings.
Until the Capital Improvement

Plan is complete, however, some
students living in Escondido look
at Rains with its green gardens
and modern Spanish style apart
ments and wonder why more
money cannot be put into bringing
Escondido up to that standard.
But students may not realize
that the housing debt — which is
incurred when new housing is
built — is spread between gradu
ates and undergraduates, Whit
ney said. The debt service is a
"fair cycle," meaning that 50 per
cent of the Capital Improvement
Campaign goes to graduate stu
dent housing, with 60 percent of
that directed to Escondido Vil
lage, he added.
Although undergraduate hous
ing has received more attention in
the last few years, Whitney said
the cycle is shifting. For example,
two new graduate residences are
scheduled to be built in the near
future, one by Governors' Corner
and one in place of the Manzanita
trailers.
Outside alternatives?
But as new residences are
being built, some said they won
der if Stanford is providing too
much student housing.
Three years ago, the Universi
ty made the shift to guaranteeing
housing to all undergraduates,
and currently 50 percent of grad
uates are provided with Universi
ty residences.
Stanford has more graduate
student housing than other uni
versities by "a very large margin,"
Dekker said. "What happens is
that Housing and Dining Services
is under two kinds of pressure:
they want to spend money on
maintaining existing residences
but they also want to spend it on
new student housing."

He added he believes it would
be an "attractive" possibility to
have new future residences man
aged by an outside management
company.
"Retrospectively, I personally
think we should do what some
universities do, which is to let pri
vate developers [manage housing]
and let them worry about the
debt," Dekker said.
But Whitney said he believes
that housing managed by Stan
ford is geared more toward meet
ing students needs — providing
facilities like programs for spous
es and housing assignments in
line with the academic calendar —
which a private company would
not necessarily do.
"This is not like housing in an
apartment complex in Mountain
View — it's where people go to
school and we're more concerned
about how we do maintenance
and when we do it,"he explained.
However, a study commis
sioned by Housing and Dining
Services of 500 Stanford graduate
students during May 1993 con
cluded that many students living

'Retrospectively, I
personally think we
should do what
some universities
do, which is to let
private developers
[manage housing]
and let them worry
about the debt.'

off-campus would live on-campus
if the facilities were upgraded.
Over the past six years, there
has been a gradual decline in the
number of students with families
coming to Stanford. In 1988 there
were 525 families living in Escon
dido compared to 344 this year, a
change Shockman said she
believes is due to the high cost of
living here.
But Whitney disagrees with
this philosophy, "I think there is
just a national trend that stu
dents with families are not going
to graduate schools," he said.
Substantial proportions of stu
dents off-campus also indicated in
the study that the "ability to stay
in one place" was an important
factor. Presently, single graduates
have one-year contracts for cam
pus housing.
After struggling for many
years, residents and particularly
the Escondido Village Family
Council — which was formed in
the spring of 1993 to communi
cate more effectively with univer
sity officials — are slowly reach
ing their goals.
And no matter what problems
Escondido residents encounter,
most agree that family facilities,
such as the scheduled new play
ground equipment, and the strong
feeling of community make Escon
dido a good family environment.
Although the University has
now shown a positive response to
residents' concerns, and a com
mitment to provide and maintain
a high standard of accommoda
tion for graduate students in
Escondido, however, the changes
will not occur overnight.
"We're definitely getting some
improvements, but I don't think
the work of the Council is over
yet," Hansen said.


After years of student com
plaints about deteriorating facili
ties and the aging of Escondido
Village, administrators have re
cently begun taking steps to ad
dress graduate housing problems.
Students, however, remain skep
tical and feel that University
promises may be a "quick fix"
aimed at getting the living condi
tions of Escondido out of the spot
light.
The move includes a new
timetable for improving Escondi
do maintenance services and the
formation of a review group —
which will include Escondido resi
dents — to study the exact nature
of new services, some of which will
hopefully be implemented before

the end of the
academic year,
said Associate Di
rector of Housing
and Dining Ser
vices Rodger
Whitney.
The plan also
addresses the
long-term toll
that aging has

taken on the Escondido facility.
Whitney said proactive mainte
nance may be necessary because
of the facility's "evolution" over
the last 30 years, since housing
usually requires more frequent
inspections as time goes on.
Despite administrative efforts,
however, some students still won
der whether maintenance will in


Whitney
deed improve and, even if it does,
whether the changes will get at
the root of the problem.
This quarter, many residents
— particularly those living in
family apartments — became so
enraged at housing conditions
that they took their complaints
straight to the top, demanding
and receiving meetings with Vice
Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds and other
housing officials.
The new proposal came shortly
after these meetings. "I want
those apartments clean and main
tained, and I can give you my
word ... they will be in the very
near future," Whitney said.
"That's what we're working on."
But there are also problems
that go beyond general mainte
nance concerns.
For years, students have said
that they feel Escondido rent is
too high, with not enough money
going back into maintaining and
improving the apartments — a
problem that is particularly
important in light of a recent
study showing that many stu
dents who now live off-campus
would live on-campus if facilities
were upgraded. Armed with a
new plan, both administrators
and Escondido residents are gear
ing up to address students' con
cerns.
In the end, however, the long
history of complaints and the
multitude of concerns indicate
that what both students and
administrators may not realize is
that the problems may not be so
easy to solve.
Getting started
In an interview last Friday,
Whitney announced a timetable
for his new maintenance inspec
tion program, beginning as early
as next month when students
move out at the end of the quar
ter.
The administrative solution
includes implementing an annual
inspection of all apartments and
providing a preventative mainte
nance campaign — in the form of
"SWAT teams" to repair such
problems as leaky faucets — by
the end of the academic year,
Whitney said.
"I don't want to wait until next
fall," he said. "I want to be sure
that everything is in place by
then."
Whitney added that the inspec
tion teams will involve Escondido
residents. "T have already told my
staff that I want to have some of
the family members who were
concerned about this come with
us when we turn these apart
ments over," he said.
In the past, residents have had
problems with the request-based
maintenance system — some
thing the annual inspection plan
will hopefully alleviate.
"It's the landlord's job to make
sure the room is up to standard,"
said Escondido Village Family
Council member Benson Honig.
Finally, Whitney said he hopes
to complete the Capital Improve
ment Plan two years earlier than
scheduled. The plan will eventual
ly renovate all apartments in
Escondido.
"I'd like to get these apart
ments renovated in six years if we
can do it and we're already on
year three," Whitney said.
A total of 250 apartments have
been renovated to date and Whit
ney said he estimates over a third
of the 1,300 apartments in Escon
dido will be finished by the end of

August.
Many students, however, won
der why such measures were not
implemented earlier, considering
some of the Escondido buildings
are over 30 years old.
"All of the things in the Capital
Improvement Program are rou
tine maintenance that should
have been done over the past 15
years," said Jim Hansen, chair of
the Escondido Village Family
Council.
Some of the problems may be a
result of underfunding in the late
19705, said Assistant Dean of
Graduate Affairs George Dekker.
"The maintenance back then
wasn't attended to and now we're
playing catch-up," he said.
Whitney said the old way of
maintenance — where work was
done on request, or when an
apartment was turned over after
four years — was adequate in the
past. Now that apartments are
becoming older, however, the
administration must be more
"maintenance-oriented and seize
the issues more than we have in
the past," he said.
But housing problems are not
confined to long-term problems.
Over the past few years many of
the problems of cleaning and
maintenance were due to "back
to-back" situations — when main
tenance crews have very little
time to clean an apartment after
one tenant leaves and before
another arrives, Whitney said.
The problem results in part
from University efforts to give
students more flexibility by allow
ing them to move in early or move
out late, he explained.
"It's not a system of neglect
but a system of flexibility," he
said "Cleaning gets left to be the
end of the food chain."
Whitney said he hopes to work
with students to "create more
windows" for cleaning while
ensuring them flexibility.
In addition, during this busy
change-over period — when
approximately 500 apartments
are turned over in three weeks —
the University has to temporarily
hire outside cleaning crews who

are not held to the same high
standards as Stanford staff, Whit
ney said.
In the late 1980s and early
19905, for example, all the clean
ing and maintenance work was
managed by outside contractors
and was not up to Stanford stan
dards, Whitney said.
"We want to get away from hir
ing outside contractors, people
who are, frankly, used to cleaning
offices," he said, adding if the
University has to resort to using
outside staff, the crews will now
be rigorously supervised by Stan
ford staff.
One of the solutions to this
problem is to hire more Universi
ty staff, Dekker said. He added,
however, that in order to keep

rent as low as possible, Housing
and Dining Services currently has
to work with "as lean a staff as
possible and this can often get
stretched."
"Those are fundamental prob
lems you can correct by throwing

said.
