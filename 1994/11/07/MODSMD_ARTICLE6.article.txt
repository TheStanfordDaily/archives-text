# Student challenges Sher for state seat
## Ph.D. candidate Mills tries his hand at politics 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
After four years at Northwest
ern, eight years in the navy and an
upcoming doctorate in electrical
engineering from Stanford, what
does Bill Mills want to do next?
He's running for state assem
bly.

But this is no Mickey
Mouse campaign. Mills, a
35-year-old Republican,
hopes to unseat Stanford
Law Prof. Byron Sher, a
Democrat who has held
the post since 1980.

"Some friends of mine recruit
ed me back in February," Mills
said. "They needed a moderate
Republican to run [in the prima
ry] against someone from the rad
ical right. They knew my positions
and I began getting more interest
ed in politics."
Mills considers himself a "fis
cally conservative, socially pro
gressive, somewhat libertarian
leaning Republican."

"We need to keep our govern
ment effective, fiscally responsi
ble, cost-effective and efficient,"
Mills said. "We need to take re
sponsibility for our own lives."
The 21st Assembly District in
cludes not only Stanford and Palo
Alto, but Los Altos, Menlo Park
and portions of San Mateo Coun
ty.

Although both candi
dates are from Stanford,
Mills said his campaign
will not focus around the
University because the
state "does not get in
volved with Stanford that

much."
He said his platform largely re
volves around government re
straint. "Byron feels government
should be involved in many as
pects of our lives," Mills said. "I
generally feel we should take re
sponsibility for our own lives and
not [have government] do every
thing for us."

It is for this reason, he said,
that he opposes the controver
sial Proposition 187, which
would deny health care and edu
cational benefits to illegal immi
grants.
"It's going to be tied up in the
courts," Mill said. "It will make
some people feel that they have
done something, but it won't do
anything. There are plenty of
employers who are willing to look
the other way."
He is also opposed to Proposi
tion 186, which would replace
existing health programs with a

state-run system, he said. "With
15 percent of the population not
covered by health care, we need
to do something to make the
free-enterprise system work bet
ter."
Mills also said money should
be spent more efficiently in edu
cation and the environment. He
cited a law which prohibits the
dumping of chlorine in San Fran
cisco Bay.
"It sounds good, but local labo
ratory companies can't dump tap
water because it contains chlo
rine," he said. "The state has not
considered how laws are impact
ing the real world. It's the same
with regulators."
Mills said he supports a regula
tory environment which encour

ages job growth. "We need to stop
the 'permit shopping agency.'
The building permits are at the
county level, the environmental
permits are at different level. . . .
There are overlapping jurisdic
tions," he said. "That's an enor
mous administrative burden.
New businesses can face a night
mare."
Mills, who still serves in the
naval reserve, said once he
receives his doctorate, he will
search for jobs in the space indus
try. He has not, however,
removed politics from his career
plans, he said.
"I am seriously considering
running again whether I win or
not," he said. "I'll have to see how
it goes."
