# Student challenges Sher for state seat
## Ph.D. candidate Mills tries his hand at politics 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
After four years at Northwest
ern, eight years in the navy and an
upcoming doctorate in electrical
engineering from Stanford, what
does Bill Mills want to do next?
He's running for state assem
bly.

But this is no Mickey
Mouse campaign. Mills, a
35-year-old Republican,
hopes to unseat Stanford
Law Prof. Byron Sher, a
Democrat who has held
the post since 1980.

"Some friends of mine recruit
ed me back in February," Mills
said. "They needed a moderate
Republican to run [in the prima
ry] against someone from the rad
ical right. They knew my positions
and I began getting more interest
ed in politics."
Mills considers himself a "fis
cally conservative, socially pro
gressive, somewhat libertarian
leaning Republican."

"We need to keep our govern
ment effective, fiscally responsi
ble, cost-effective and efficient,"
Mills said. "We need to take re
sponsibility for our own lives."
The 21st Assembly District in
cludes not only Stanford and Palo
Alto, but Los Altos, Menlo Park
and portions of San Mateo Coun
ty.

Although both candi
dates are from Stanford,
Mills said his campaign
will not focus around the
University because the
state "does not get in
volved with Stanford that

much."
He said his platform largely re
volves around government re
straint. "Byron feels government
should be involved in many as
pects of our lives," Mills said. "I
generally feel we should take re
sponsibility for our own lives and
not [have government] do every
thing for us."
