# Holiday honors life, death
## Dia de los Muertos warms community 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
Song, laughter and a sense of
unity filled The Nitery in Old
Union on Friday night as the
Chicano community celebrated
El Dia de los Muertos.
Some 200 people crowded
into the theater for the celebra
tion, sitting in aisles and lining
the sides of the stage to watch
the performances.
El Dia de los Muertos is a cel
ebration of the dead, a merging
of Spanish and indigenous Mex
ican traditions in which fami
lies visit their dead relatives, ex
plained Rudy Busto, assistant
professor of religious studies.
Although the holiday is cele
brated on Nov. 2, it should not
be confused with Halloween,
Busto said. Halloween, which
originated in the British Isles, is
"a holiday for being afraid of
the dead," Busto said. "El Dia
de los Muertos is a way to ven
erate the ancestors."
This year's celebration was
dedicated to Stanford sopho

more Jessica Williams, who died
in a car accident on Oct. 20.
"Although Jessica is no longer
with us, she will be remembered
by many as an excellent friend,
student and leader," the event
program said. "Jessica's presence
has surely been felt in and outside
of Stanford and her absence is felt
among many of us as well."
A number of student groups
participated in the celebration,
including Ballet Folkl6rico de
Stanford and Teatro Xicano.
The male and female members
of Ballet Folkl6rico switched roles
Friday night, which, a dancer
explained, is a custom because
"everything is backwards" on
Nov. 2 when the dead come back
to life.
Teatro Xicano performed two
skits, one commemorating last
spring's hunger strike and anoth

er protesting Proposition 187.
The holiday of El Dia de los
Muertos itself is celebrated in dif
ferent ways in different locations,
Busto said, and has only become
widely recognized in recent years.
"This is a holiday which in
many places is a revitalized tradi
tion," Busto said. "Twenty years
ago, people who did it were older
women. At the end of the Chicano
movement (in the 19705), people
realized that connections to their
cultural past were central" in
finding their community.
Arcadio Morales, resident fel
low at Casa Zapata, and Joey
Guerrero, a student, read their
original poems. In "Memories of
My Barrio," Morales told of his
friends and his youth, recalling
that "much to the faculty's cha
grin, we all applied to college and
got in,"and in "To Death," Guer
rero challenged death: "For now,
I'll hold fast to my life."
Daniel Contreras, a graduate
student, offered his thoughts
before the final act — traditional

music by the Trio Cardenal. The
Trio drew loud applause and per
formed encore after encore, each
time being joined in song by more
of the crowd.
Contreras told of his grand
mother's death earlier this year.
"I was struck by how natural it
seemed," he said. "Her death
made me feel torn and depressed,
but it did not make me feel angry.
"What makes me angry," he
said, "is that people younger than
me can get AIDS. . . .Every death
of a Chicano by AIDS is a death
that didn't need to be."
Moving to gang violence, Con
treras asked, "Is it a natural
death that a 15-year-old Chicano
should die for wearing the wrong
color? Every death of a Chicano
by gang violence is a death that
didn't need to be."
"I want us to think about
death tonight and become angry,"
Contreras said. "Let's make the
next Day of the Dead a day we
might not have to commemorate
so many deaths."
