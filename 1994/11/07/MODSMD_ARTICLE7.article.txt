Song, laughter and a sense of
unity filled The Nitery in Old
Union on Friday night as the
Chicano community celebrated
El Dia de los Muertos.
Some 200 people crowded
into the theater for the celebra
tion, sitting in aisles and lining
the sides of the stage to watch
the performances.
El Dia de los Muertos is a cel
ebration of the dead, a merging
of Spanish and indigenous Mex
ican traditions in which fami
lies visit their dead relatives, ex
plained Rudy Busto, assistant
professor of religious studies.
Although the holiday is cele
brated on Nov. 2, it should not
be confused with Halloween,
Busto said. Halloween, which
originated in the British Isles, is
"a holiday for being afraid of
the dead," Busto said. "El Dia
de los Muertos is a way to ven
erate the ancestors."
This year's celebration was
dedicated to Stanford sopho
