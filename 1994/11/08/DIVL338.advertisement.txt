A lot of good folks started their careers in California.
Our dean went to Pomona and to UCLA law school.
Our associate dean went to Berkeley and then to law school at Davis.
Our director of admission graduated from Santa Clara and then went on to USC.
At one time, each vowed, "I will never leave California."
Until they saw the great Pacific northwest.
And Willamette University College of Law.
They each broke their vow.
To find out more about law school and life in the Pacific
Northwest, we invite you to meet with one of our
representatives:
Ryan S. Petersen, Admission Counselor
at the Stanford University Law Fair
Wednesday, November 9, 1994
Tresidder Memorial Union

We think you'll like what he has to say.
Who knows? Maybe, you, too, will break your vow.

small, selective private university situated adjacent to Oregon's capltol. More than 60% of the 1L class Is from
outside the state of Oregon. Annually, 16%-20% are from California. Graduates practice primarily In the West,
