Martin Carnoy
Faded Dreams:
The Politics and Economics of Race in America
(Cambridge University Press, $29.95)
Faded Dreams paints a new and chal
lenging picture of how racial inequality
has evolved in America. Carnoy shows that the dominant views of economic
differences between blacks and whites do not adequately explain why blacks
made such large gains in the past and stopped making them in the 1980s
and 19905. Using a systematic analysis of fifty years of data on income, edu
cation, and variety of jobs,
the book offers a powerful
argument for active govern
ment intervention to
improve the education and
living conditions of disad
vantaged black children.
Martin Carnoy is Professor
