# Voting on the Farm
## Quirky rules govern campus elections 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
Today as students across cam
pus attempt to vote in the Califor
nia election, many could find
themselves unable to cast their
ballots because of the logistics of
the voting process.
California law requires all citi
zens to re-register to vote if they
change their name, residence, or

party affiliation. This poses a par
ticular problem for Stanford stu
dents, who usually switch resi
dences yearly.
In addition, the University
campus is in fact split into 12
precincts in two political divisions,
meaning that students in differ
ent parts of campus will be voting
separately in one race.
To bo eligible to vote in this
election, a student must have re
registered to vote under their cur
rent address by Oct. 11 — 29 days
before the election. If students
choose not to establish residency
in California, they may continue to
vote in their home districts by
requesting absentee ballots.
The way the registration law
applies to Stanford students is
sometimes confusing. If a student
registered to vote on campus as a
freshman living in Branner Hall,
for example, this same student
would have to re-register as a
sophomore if she moved to Roble,
or even to another room within
the same residence.

According to Ray Johnson, a
precinct technician from Santa
Clara County, the same principle
applies to citizens throughout Cal
ifornia. "Even if you live in an
apartment complex and you move
next door to another apartment,
you must re-register," he said.
"That is the law."
However, many students are
not aware of the specifics involved
in voter registration. "I voted on
campus my sophomore year and I
have never re-registered," said
senior Mike Chinnavaso. "I had no
clue that I actually had to re-regis
ter."
If a student does not re-regis
ter, the registrar of voters will
assume the student's residence
has not changed and a sample bal
lot will be sent to that student's
post office box.

The location of the student's
polling place for election day is list
ed on the back of the sample ballot
— generally, the place he or she
voted the year before if the stu
dent has not re-registered.
Students are usually directed to
the polling place closest to their
place of residence.
Each polling place has a list of
voters for that precinct. Students
who have not re-registered and try
to vote in their original polling
place will not be listed there but
can still receive a provisional ballot
and vote in the election.
However, this ballot must be
verified by the registrar of voters
in order to be tallied in the elec
tion. If the registrar notices that
the student's new residence does
not match the residence listed on
the original registration form, the

ballot will be discarded.
"If you did not re-register to
vote you do not have any options,"
said Maggie Khan, supervisor of
voter services for Santa Clara
County. "The only thing you can
do is re-register so you can vote in
the future."
Stanford has 12 polling places
corresponding to its precincts. All
University precincts will be voting
in the 14th Congressional District,
the 21st Assembly District and the
Mid-Peninsula Regional Park Dis
trict.
But not all the ballots at Stan
ford will look alike. Instead, some
students will vote in Ward 1 and
others will vote in Ward 2. Each
ward has its own representative to
elect in the race for the director of
open space management in the
Mid-Peninsula District.
