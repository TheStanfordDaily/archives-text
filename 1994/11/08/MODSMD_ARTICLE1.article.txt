# Voting on the Farm
## Quirky rules govern campus elections 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
Today as students across cam
pus attempt to vote in the Califor
nia election, many could find
themselves unable to cast their
ballots because of the logistics of
the voting process.
California law requires all citi
zens to re-register to vote if they
change their name, residence, or

party affiliation. This poses a par
ticular problem for Stanford stu
dents, who usually switch resi
dences yearly.
In addition, the University
campus is in fact split into 12
precincts in two political divisions,
meaning that students in differ
ent parts of campus will be voting
separately in one race.
