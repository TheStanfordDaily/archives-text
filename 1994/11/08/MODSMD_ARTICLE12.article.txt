GOVERNOR:
Kathleen Brown i Z

California's future is at stake
tomorrow, and the election of Kath
leen Brown will ensure a brighter
future for the state. Although
Brown certainly doesn't have all
the answers, she seems to recog
nize California's problems and will
work toward realistic solutions.
Republican incumbent Pete Wil
son, on the other hand, is playing
on the fears of Californians by
pushing crime and immigration
legislation rather than relying on
his past record.
His support of Proposition 187
— a measure which would deny all
social services except emergency
medical care to illegal immigrants
— provides a microcosm of this ill-

U.S. SENATOR:
Dianne Feinstein \Z

Just two years after her landslide
victory over then-Senator John Sey
mour, Democratic incumbent Dianne
Feinstein has a better record than
many of her colleagues who have
been in Washington four times as
long.
Conversely, Republican chal
lenger Michael Huffington is a
Texas oil baron long on money and
short on everything else. Huffing
ton has offered little more than crit
icism of Feinstein's policies, and one
of the few ideas he has actually put
forward is an incomplete plan to dis
mantle the current welfare system.
Feinstein, on the other hand,
is known for substantive action.

U.S. REPRESENTATIVE:
Anna Eshoo \Z

In the 14th Congressional District,
freshman U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-
Atherton) has proven both dynamic
and effective these past two years.
Eshoo has demonstrated her
commitment to the district in sever
al ways. Just last year, she played an
instrumental role in bringing a $238
million research project to Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, a move

STATE ASSEMBLY:
Byron Sher ✓

In his 14 years on the state

Byron Sher has established himself
as one of the most intelligent and
capable members of the legislature.
He has been active in forwarding
environmental causes (he chairs the

SECRETARY OF STATE:
Tony Miller \Z

Although few voters know
much about the Secretary of State
candidates or the job they are
seeking, there is one thing they
should know; Democrat Tony
Miller is clearly more qualified
than his opponent, Republican
Bill Jones.
After 16 years on staff, Miller
became acting Secretary of State
when March Fong Eu resigned.

proposition m
YESn NO 0

Proposition 184 would reaffirm
the "three strikes and you're out"
law recently passed by the state gov
ernment.
But this new law is poorly crafted.
The law requires only the first two
"strikes" to be serious or violent

advised strategy. In effect, he has
tried to vindicate his record in
office by displacing the blame for
California's woes.
During Wilson's term, however,
California has been plagued by dif
ficulties which were indeed avoid
able. Most notably, Wilson was
overtaken by inertia prior to the
defense industry's collapse, failing
to provide legislative assistance for
post-Cold War defense conversion
until it was too late. For the most
part, Wilson has only acted when
obliged.
As state treasurer and a former
corporate lawyer, Brown has the
background to grasp the economic
complexities of California and ulti
mately put the state on the road
toward renewal. While she may not
be everything voters could hope for,
at this point in time Brown is the
best choice available.

She was a galvanizing force
behind the Desert Protection
Bill, the ban pn assault weapons,
the expansion of the earned
income tax credit and numerous
other measures designed to help
California. She has been a leader
in easing the state's transition to
a downsized defense industry
and has brought much-needed
female representation to the
Senate Judiciary Committee.
These legislative victories did
not come easily. Feinstein has
learned the ins and outs of Wash
ington with amazing speed, and she
knows how to maneuver on the
state's behalf.
In sum, there's no question
which of these two Stanford gradu

proud — send DiFi back to Wash

that saved hundreds of jobs at
SLAC. Eshoo also helped secure fed

police officers in nearby East Palo
Alto. She courageously supported
NAFTA despite high pressures to
vote against it. And she has fought
hard for reforms in both campaign
finance and health care.
As a freshman congress worn an,
Eshoo has accomplished a substan

ers should support her on Election
Day, because as a returning member,
she will only be able to do more.

Assembly, he served on the Palo Alto
City Council and as that city's
mayor. Sher is also a professor at the
Law School, so he can be expected to
go to bat for the University when
needed.
If Sher is re-elected, term limits
will force him from office in 1996.
While sentimentality should not
normally dictate votes, voters
should return Sher for a final two
years in the Assembly. It is simply
too difficult to imagine anyone else
in the seat.

Miller has pushed for lobbyist
reporting and voter-registration
reforms. Recently, he checked the
tobacco industry's deceptive push
for Prop. 188.
Interestingly, Miller is gay and
could become the first openly gay
statewide elected official. Miller is
making no mention of the issue,
and to his credit Jones also calls
the issue irrelevant.
The Secretary of State job
requires attention to detail, experi
ence and know-how. Miller offers
that, and his sexual orientation
should not be an issue.

17 and then forges a check at 40 now

Voters should voice their disap

PROPOSITION 186:
VESD NO 0

Though its promises may seem
both numerous and grandiose,
Proposition 186 is an invitation to a
state health-care disaster that voters
would be wise to reject.
Prop. 186 would institute a so
called "single-payer" health-care
system, whereby a single govern
ment-run system would replace pri
vate health insurance.
Studies have concluded that the

PROPOSITION 187:
YES □ HIQg

One of this year's most hotly con
tested ballot items is Proposition
187, which would deny health, edu
cation and social services to undocu
mented immigrants and require
reporting of "suspected" illegal
immigrants to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
Proponents of the "Save Our
State" initiative say its institution
will save California $200 million and
reduce illegal immigration. But
implementation costs would eat up
half those savings. The plan would
also jeopardize billions in federal

PROPOSITION 188:
WESD NO 0

Proposition 188 is an under
handed ploy perpetrated by Philip
Morris and other tobacco compa
nies.
At first glance, Prop. 188 may
appear to regulate public smoking.
In truth, however, the tobacco
industry created the proposition to

program would operate on a budget
of about $100 billion. This is a sub
stantial sum to pass on to the state,
especially considering the state
bureaucracy's pathetic track record
with education and welfare pro
grams.
Even worse, that $100 billion
budget would largely fall under the
control of a single state health com
missioner who would wield a fright
ening degree of power over Califor
nia's health system, relatively free
from the checks and balances that
constrain other government offi
cials.

funding for the state. That could
mean a net loss of $15 billion.
Passing Prop. 187 would have
other harmful ramifications as well.
Denying health services to undocu
mented immigrants would cause
public health problems. Cutting off
education would further isolate an
underclass and would increase
crime. Requiring state employees to
report "suspected" undocumented
immigrants would create an un-
American police state. And Prop. 187
would not stop illegal immigration.
People come to the United States for
jobs and opportunity, not services.
Illegal immigration is a problem
that must be corrected. Prop. 187,
however, would be a large step in the
wrong direction.

Philip Morris claims Prop. 188
benefits public health and busi

come out against the measure.
Philip Morris is hoping to slip

ballot issues receive more atten

Passing Prop. 187 would have
other harmful ramifications as well.
Denying health services to undocu
mented immigrants would cause
public health problems. Cutting off
education would further isolate an
underclass and would increase
crime. Requiring state employees to
report "suspected" undocumented
immigrants would create an un-
American police state. And Prop. 187
would not stop illegal immigration.
People come to the United States for
jobs and opportunity, not services.
Illegal immigration is a problem
that must be corrected. Prop. 187,
however, would be a large step in the
wrong direction.

gut existing state and local smok
ing restrictions.
Philip Morris claims Prop. 188
benefits public health and busi
ness, but major health organiza
tions and business groups have
come out against the measure.
Philip Morris is hoping to slip
188 past the electorate while other
ballot issues receive more atten
tion. Voters shouldn't give them
the pleasure.
