## A 						little dose of optimism 
### 
OBSERVING THE COURSE of
our world via newspaper head
lines and television clips, I have
become fearful for our future.
Community violence, environmental
degradation and homelessness, as
examples, may be seen not only through
the media but also in the streets of Palo
Alto, East Palo Alto and surrounding
communities. The symptoms of these
aggregate ills — high rates of depres
sion, divorce and suicide — are sobering
reminders of our dysfunctional condi
tion. That there is abundant inequality
and abuse in our society seems indis
putable.
Why isn't this frightening prognosis
met with an onslaught of activism? In
fact, there are several responses to the
general malaise which pervades our
world. The first is to deny it. An exam
ple is the person who, when told of the
horrendous living condition of the
homeless, denies it because he or she
cannot see it. Another possibility is to
hope that "they" or "the government"
will resolve these problems. As a result,
we form unrealistic expectations for
others while absolving ourselves of
responsibility. Yet government seems
perpetually unable to respond to the
disturbing trend of disempowerment
within our underserved population.
A final option is to creatively inter
vene and make a difference. At the
Arbor Free Clinic in Menlo Park, Stan
ford medical students are proving that

such initiative can be beneficial for
everyone involved. Started in 1990 by
students as part of the Community
Scholars program at the School of
Medicine, the Clinic provides free
health care to the underserved commu
nity of the Mid-Peninsula region, which
surrounds Stanford. Volunteers,
including Stanford undergraduates,
medical students and physicians, supply
their energy and expertise toward pro
viding routine health care at the Clinic
every Sunday afternoon. And Arbor
continues to be run exclusively by stu
dents, who pride themselves on their
independence from University adminis
tration.
Why does this entity work where oth
ers have failed? The driving force is the
mutually beneficial environment which
the Clinic fosters. Unlike many other
volunteer efforts, those who work at
Arbor benefit greatly from the experi
ence. For pre-medical students, it is
often the first interaction with patients,
an experience which can greatly influ
ence their outlook on a future medical
career. For medical students, it is an
opportunity to put classroom skills to
practical use. It is therapeutic to feel
genuinely in demand rather than a peon
at the bottom of the hospital ladder. For
the physicians, it is an opportunity to
give something back. Says Dr. Edwin
Atwood, a cardiologist and a frequent
face at Arbor, "It's a privilege to be a
doctor, and being here really reminds us

of that. I'm not sure who it helps more
— us or them."
For the patient, the benefits are
enormous. For many of them, this is the
only health care available. Prescription
drugs, physical examinations and stan
dard tests are all readily available. The
normally short waiting period and
friendly staff make this vastly prefer
able to a tortuous wait at the County
hospital. Finally, patients are comfort
ed by the warm, non-judgmental atmo
sphere at Arbor Clinic.
Unfortunately, Arbor Free Clinic is
an aberration. It is considered heroic
that busy medical students would
undertake such an effort in the face of
widespread societal ills. Others talk
about it, praise it, and are even some
how proud of it, yet most remain unin
volved. The inspiration provided by the
Clinic to both patients and volunteers
quickly evaporates outside its doors.
It is easy to remain paralyzed by this
suffocating sense of doom which looms
throughout our society. Yet with inac
tion things will only get worse. As long
as Arbor Free Clinic remains a rare
symbiosis of individual and community
needs, it will remain a small cog in the
machine of social change which is nec
essary for our survival. Arbor Free Clin
ic is just the beginning.

Chris Carlsten encourages you to go out
