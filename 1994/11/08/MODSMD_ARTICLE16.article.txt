Zimbardo's criticism of
Wilson ignored fact that
Brown also supports 184

As Election Day approaches, the media
bears a responsibility to provide accurate
representation of the issues facing voters.
Unfortunately, this does not always occur.
The Daily's "Zimbardo criticizes 3 strikes"
article of Nov. 3 begins by reporting that
Prof. Philip Zimbardo "strongly [opposes!
California Governor Pete Wilson's cam
paign rhetoric" in favor of Prop. 184, the
Three-Strikes-And-You're-Out initiative.

The article continues that Wilson "advo
cates the proposition" and that Zimbardo
"argued that Governor Wilson has not ade
quately informed the public" about poten
tial ramifications if the measure is passed.
By only reporting Wilson's support, The
Daily missed an important point: guberna
torial challenger Kathleen Brown is also in
favor of Prop. 184. By "strongly opposing"
campaign rhetoric in favor of the proposi
tion, Zimbardo is opposing Wilson arid
Brown's support of the measure. Rightly
or wrongly, both candidates should be held
responsible for "not adequately informing
the public" about Prop. 184. The Daily
should have mentioned in the article that

both candidates support the measure.

ASSU's position on 187
just as unconstitutional
as the proposition itself
Ironically, Prop. 187 and the ASSU
Senate bill passed opposing it (SA-1)
are strikingly similar. 187 is almost cer
tainly unconstitutional under the cur
rent interpretation of the U.S. Consti-

tution. SA-1 is also almost certainly
unconstitutional under the current
ASSU Constitution. Yet both have
strong support from an electorate igno
rant of the issues involved. But while
SA-1 has already passed, 187 probably
will not. The difference is this: advo
cates of 187 know their bill will face a
constitutional challenge — and look
forward to it — while advocates of SA-1
know that since they are the only con
stitutional safeguard in the ASSU, they
can choose not to worry about a pesky
constitution.
