## Wishing for some superman power 
### 
If only I were. That's a common thought that
goes through my mind when I'm lifting
weights or trying to out-jump those darn six
footers in pickup hoops. What if I could be taller?
What if I could actually gain 20 more pounds?
What would I wish for if God granted me the
opportunity to change my body in one respect?

But wait. Why the heck should I stop at mere
alteration of physical dimensions? Why not ask
for what everybody hoped for when they were
kids? That's right — what super power would I
want to assist my athletic pursuits?
Several options leap to my mind immediately.
I shall discuss them just in case God decides to
experiment with me and wants to know which
ability I've settled upon. Sure, you may think
I'm nuts now, but do you really know what
you're eating from Food Service? The cranberry
juice looks suspiciously like ethidium bromide
(my favorite mutagen), and why the heck does
my nose glow fluorescent green after I eat pesto?
So here goes.
1. Super strength. You'd think you could do a lot
with this one besides winning the world lifting
championships. But really, other than events
such as the javelin throw and the shot put,
strength alone just doesn't cut it. A heck of a lot
of good strength'll do you in football if you don't
have the speed to chase down the ball. And hav
ing tremendous body strength doesn't mean you
increase your momentum — no matter how
much you can lift, you're at a certain body
weight with a certain amount of speed, and
someone bigger and faster will still stick your
face into the dirt. I think I'd rather have some
thing more exotic.
2. How 'bout heat vision. Too exotic here. Obvi
ously of little use unless you're involved in winter
sports and have the mindset of Tanya Harding.
