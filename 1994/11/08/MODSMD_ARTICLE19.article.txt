## Wishing for some superman power 
### 
If only I were. That's a common thought that
goes through my mind when I'm lifting
weights or trying to out-jump those darn six
footers in pickup hoops. What if I could be taller?
What if I could actually gain 20 more pounds?
What would I wish for if God granted me the
opportunity to change my body in one respect?

But wait. Why the heck should I stop at mere
alteration of physical dimensions? Why not ask
for what everybody hoped for when they were
kids? That's right — what super power would I
want to assist my athletic pursuits?
Several options leap to my mind immediately.
I shall discuss them just in case God decides to
experiment with me and wants to know which
ability I've settled upon. Sure, you may think
I'm nuts now, but do you really know what
you're eating from Food Service? The cranberry
juice looks suspiciously like ethidium bromide
(my favorite mutagen), and why the heck does
my nose glow fluorescent green after I eat pesto?
So here goes.
1. Super strength. You'd think you could do a lot
with this one besides winning the world lifting
championships. But really, other than events
such as the javelin throw and the shot put,
strength alone just doesn't cut it. A heck of a lot
of good strength'll do you in football if you don't
have the speed to chase down the ball. And hav
ing tremendous body strength doesn't mean you
increase your momentum — no matter how
much you can lift, you're at a certain body
weight with a certain amount of speed, and
someone bigger and faster will still stick your
face into the dirt. I think I'd rather have some
thing more exotic.
2. How 'bout heat vision. Too exotic here. Obvi
ously of little use unless you're involved in winter
sports and have the mindset of Tanya Harding.

Sure, melt the ice from under
Nancy's footing, but what good
does that really do? You look tough
only because you can make every
one else look silly. Heat vision
would be loads of fun at Big Game,
but otherwise, I think I'll pass.
3. Invincibility. Completely useless
except that you'll never get hurt.
Let's go back to the football exam
ple. You're invincible. You feel on
top of the world. You're in the
NFL. You get set a few yards
behind the line of scrimmage, all

200 pounds of you at inside
linebacker. The opposition snaps
the ball, the quarterback hands the
ball ofT, and here comes some 240-
pound fullback drafted in the first
round straight out of jail. What
happens? You don't get hurt, but
you do a great impression of Brian
Bosworth meeting Bo Jackson. Bo
still plays baseball. Have you heard
of the Boz lately?
4. X-ray vision. This one may be of
more use than one might first
imagine. Sure, you can see the plays
that your adversaries devise, but
why limit your abilities? If you're
really eager to win and willing to
put up with perhaps a nasty sight
or two, why not start to rather inti

mately describe your adversary's
anatomy during a contest? Imagine
if you were dribbling a basketball or
trying to do a layout double back
during a gymnastics meet, and
someone you're competing against
starts to address you directly about
that rather peculiar birth mark on
your left bum cheek. I can't speak
for anybody else, but I know some
thing like that would definitely
destroy my concentration!
5. Super speed. Here, we perhaps
have the ultimate weapon in ath
letics. Besides events such as lift
ing, disk shooting, archery or
equestrian, there's nothing you
can't excel at given the speed of the
Flash. Stronger and bigger than

me? Catch me first! I can do things
so fast that, even when I break the
rules, no one can witness me doing
so. I'd be the first jockey to race in
the Kentucky Derby without a
horse — and win. Tour de France?
I'll do that without a bike between
the time I wake up in the morning
and when I make the usual pil
grimage to the bathroom. Or I can
even sprinkle the Alps and forget
the bathroom entirely.
Okay, God. I want super speed.
Oh boy! I think food service is open!

While Sam may not have super
speed, he does have super disci
pline. Done three days early,
Sam?
