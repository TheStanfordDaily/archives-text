# 50 candidates apply for BCSC director job
## 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
With more than 50 applica
tions for the position of Black
Community Services Center di
rector received by the deadline
yesterday, the search committee
now faces the daunting task of
narrowing the field.
The applicant pool met or ex
ceeded expectations both in num
ber and qualifications, said Dan
dre DeSandies, chair of the search

committee. He added the commit
tee had received applications from
all over the country.
"I have heard the committee is
very pleased with the pool," said
BCSC interim director Blair Bow
man, who also applied for the po
sition.
The search, which began in
September after the resignation
of former acting director Barbara
Smith, is still only in its infant
stages. The committee will
"meet as often as it takes" to sift
through and eventually reduce
the candidate list to a manage
able number, said DeSandies,
student affairs officer at the
Undergraduate Advising Center.
The finalists will then be
invited to campus for personal
interviews, probably in January.
The timeline remains somewhat
vague about the final date of
appointment, DeSandies said.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said he will work with
the committee to formulate an
unranked list of the top three

candidates and then pick the
director out of that list himself.
DeSandies said the search
committee — composed of 13
University faculty, staff, stu
dents and alumni — will be look
ing for someone with extensive
student affairs experience since
the position doubles as associate
dean for student affairs.
Furthermore, the director
should have a strong academic
focus and be able to deal with
issues that black students face
on a "predominantly white cam
pus," DeSandies added.
Senior Anietie Ekanem, last
year's Black Student Union
head, said the new director must
above all act as an advocate for
students and articulate their
needs.

Ekanem, a COP member,
added that the new director will
have to address and help in the
healing of "old wounds." More
specifically, he said the adminis
tration's seeming lack of support
for the ethnic centers — includ
ing the BCSC — has been a
source of distress the new direc
tor should play a role in alleviat
ing.
One of the most drastic com
munity responses to the admin
istration's perceived indifference
came in the form of this sum
mer's resignations of Smith and
former assistant director Shaun
McAlmont, who cited the Uni
versity's lack of support as the
main reason for their departure.
DeSandies stressed the
iniDortance of community incut

during the next few months. At
least one public forum will be
held during the finalist stage to
facilitate feedback, and anyone
with interim suggestions should
contact him, he said.
"We want to make this a fair,
equitable process," he added.
Smith filled the position of
acting director following the res
ignation of former director Keith
Archuleta during the spring of
1992.
A national search during the
1992-93 academic year proved
fruitless when the top con
tender, Judith James, first
accepted and later rejected the
position. A second choice also
declined the position, and Smith
was asked to remain as acting
director.
