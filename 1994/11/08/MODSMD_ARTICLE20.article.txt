# No. 1-seeded soccer won't host NCAAs
## Women must travel to Portland 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
The Oregon Ducks have derailed
many Pacific 10 Conference opponents in
their quest for a Rose Bowl bid. In the
process, they may have kept the top-seed
ed Stanford women's soccer team from
hosting the NCAA West Regional Cham
pionship.
Despite a 16-1-1 regular season
record, the No. 3 Cardinal will have to
travel to Portland, where second seed
University of Portland (14-5) plays host
in next weekend's regional. Stanford will
face the winner of a Wednesday first
round matchup between No. 14 Wash
ington (12-6-1) and No. 18 Oregon State
(13-4), on Saturday, Nov. 12.
NCAA Assistant Director of Champi
onships Philip A. Buttafuoco cited off
the-field considerations for awarding the
regional to Portland, which is already
hosting the Final Four.
"We were concerned with Stanford
hosting a football game on campus,"
Buttafuoco said. "We were worried
about the playing field and the accom
modations surrounding the student-ath
letes. Stanford made its best effort to
convince the committee that it was pre
pared, but we were leery to put soccer
and football on the same weekend at the
same site."
Buttafuoco noted that last year, a sim
ilar shift in sites occurred.
"The NCAA stopped Notre Dame last
year from hosting a regional due to the
Notre Dame-Florida State football game.
We did not want to change from the
precedent established," he said.
Another top seed, No. 5 Connecticut,
also will travel to a different location for
its Regional. In the East Region, perhaps
the weakest of the four, No. 7 Hartford
will serve as host.
Stanford head coach lan Sawyers took
the announcement in stride, downplay
ing the significance of the home-field
advantage.
"It really doesn't matter," Sawyers
said. "There are plusses and minuses to
hosting the regionals. It's great for
recruiting, but at the same time there are
less distractions when you play on the
road. The kids can really focus on the job
at hand away from home."
Stanford had hosted a tournament
game in each of the last three years, but
football had never directly conflicted
with the tournament until now.
"I felt like it was coming," said junior

sweeper Jessica Fischer. "You never
know how it's going to work out. It
doesn't really bother me at all. We're
happy to be in, and I feel really good
about where we are."
The tournament, which has expanded
from 12 teams in 1992 to last year's 16 to
its current 24, features seven teams from
the west coast. In the past, the commit
tee has sometimes filled out the West
Region with schools from elsewhere.
In 1994, the West may be, from top to
bottom, the most solid in the tourney.
The lowest seed, St. Mary's, was ranked
in the top ten early in the season. With an
11-7-1 record and the loss of their start
ing goalkeeper, the Gaels were a mild
surprise over UCLA, Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo, and San Francisco. Strength of
schedule gave the nod to St. Mary's, who
will play at No. 9 Santa Clara (14-4-1) in
a rematch of a game last week to deter
mine who goes to Portland.
The host Pilots will meet the winner
of that contest on Saturday, with tenta
tive starting time set for 11 a.m. or 1:30
p.m. The 5,000 seat stadium may well be
filled to capacity, as the Final Four has
been sold out since August. Stanford will
play either Oregon State, the fourth seed,
or fifth-seeded Washington.
The Cardinal faced the Huskies last
Friday, but have not come up against
OSU in Sawyers' tenure as head coach.
The Beavers, who defeated Washington
1-0 on Oct. 18, would pose a tough threat,
according to Sawyers.
"They have a very good forward
[Valerie Williams, tied for fourth in the
nation in scoring] who's a great goal scor
er [she has 19 goals in 1994]," he said.
"They're physical, well-organized, and a
good defensive team."
If Stanford can get by its regional
semifinal opponent, Portland, Santa
Clara or St. Mary's will await. The Cardi
nal defeated the Broncos 3-1 and the
Gaels 2-0 at home this season, but have
not faced the Pilots since last season's 1-
0 victory that sent Stanford to its first
Final Four.
"Portland is a very good team,"
Sawyers said. "They're very well-orga
nized. But they're a little young in the
backfield."
Portland compensates for any defen
sive struggles with the highest scoring
offense in the region. Two players,
Tiffany Milbrett and Shannon MacMil
lan, are in the top four in the nation in
offense.

Senior Melinda Minstrell and the Cardinal team will shoot for the national
title beginning at Western Regionals this weekend.
If Stanford reaches the Final
Four, it will meet the Midwest
Region winner in a national semifi
nal. Top-ranked Notre Dame (19-0-
1) is the host, and will meet the win
ner of No. 16 George Mason (15-2-
2) at No. 13 Virginia (13-4-3). No. 6
William and Mary (16-3) draws the
other first-round bye and awaits the
winner of Washington State (11-6-
1) at No. 10 Wisconsin (16-5). The
unranked Cougars, who lost their
last two games, were a surprise
selection to shift from the West.
The other half of the bracket fea

tures eight-time defending national
champion North Carolina (21-1-1).
The No. 2 Tar Heels host the South
Region and will face an ACC rival,
either No. 11 Clemson (15-4) or
North Carolina State (10-8-4). No.
4 Duke (16-4-1), the only team to
defeat North Carolina since 1990,
draws the other bye and anticipates
either Great Midwest tournament
champion Cincinnati (15-4-2) or
No. 19 Vanderbilt (16-4).
In the East, three Ivy League
schools will try to topple Connecti
cut and Hartford, who were award
ed first-round byes. No. 15 Dart
mouth (11-3-1) or No. 12 Brown
(10-4-1) will face the Huskies, and
Harvard (9-3-3) or No. 17 Mas
sachusetts (15-5) await the Hawks.
