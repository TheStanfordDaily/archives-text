# 40 days, 40 nights
## Sailors battle rain to triumph in Santa Cruz 
### Daniel Kao Contributing writer 
The biggest challenges the Stan
ford sailing team encountered this
weekend at UC-Santa Cruz did not
come in the form of Bears, Trojans,
or even Banana Slugs. In the
Women Fall Championships and
the concurrent Freshman/Sopho
more Regatta, the Cardinal's
biggest adversary came in the guise

of Mother Nature.
"In all the years I've coached
and coordinated regattas, this has
got to be one of the most miserable
days I've seen," said longtime sail
ing director Blake Middleton.
"There was a lot of capsizing
amongst the sailors because of the
big, high waves, not because of
poor boathandling. The buoys were
also almost impossible to see.
There were a lot of misjudgments

because of the waves. A lot of peo
ple also went in with illnesses like
hypothermia or seasickness. The
conditions were extremely chal
lenging."
The foul weather, which includ
ed rain, cold, and worst of all swells
that were up to eight feet high, cut
short both the regattas which fea
tured the use of two-person Flying
Junior boats. The elements did lit
tle, however, to dampen the perfor
mances of the Cardinal sailors.
With just four races held due to
the inclement weather, the
women's team still swept the top
two spots in a field of half-a-dozen
schools. Sophomore skipper Alice
Manard and freshman crew Kathy
Angkustsiri led the Cardinal with a
first place finish with junior skip
per Gretchen Uznis and freshman
crew Noelle Marquis piloting the
second-place boat.
Manard dominated the race
with three first-place finishes and a
third. The Cardinal victory pro
vides rankings for Fall Intersec
tionals and also gives Stanford first
choice when picking which regattas
in which to participate in the
spring season.
The Stanford team sailed to tri
umph in the two-division Fresh
man/Sophomore Regatta whose
competitors had to be freshman or
sophomore skippers. Fab freshmen
skippers Phil Barow, John Meade
and Danny Zimbaldi led the Cardi
nal team. The team of Meade and
sophomore crew Megan Ireson fin
ished second in the A Division
behind fellow Cardinal Barow and
junior crew Sybil Diver. The Zim
baldi/Rogers combination also fin
ished second in their respective
division, yet that was enough to
give Stanford the victory. "There
were huge waves, but the condi
tions weren't really that much of a
problem," Meade said. "Phil,
Danny and I just went out there to
do what we needed to do, sail well
and win."
The conditions may have been
better this weekend for senior Car
dinal skipper Charles Meade at St.

the Singlehanded Nationals, but

were far worse.
Meade entered as the top finish
er in Districts, yet he wasn't able
to repeat his performance against
16 of the nation's best singlehand
ed Laser sailors. He wound up the
weekend with a ninth-place finish.
Bill Hardesty of King's Point even
tually came away with the title fol
lowed by last year's winner Mark
Mendelblatt of Tufts.
The conditions along the
Chesapeake in Maryland featured
a mix of strong and light winds

and the regatta appeared ripe for
Cardinal glory. Those hopes quick
ly faded, however, as Meade strug
gled in several early races. It was a
combination of ill-timed mistakes
and backfired risks that led to his
downfall.
"Charles's early and middle
races were his really bad ones,"
said coach Steve Bourdow. "He
would sail well and then make a
mistake that would cost him a lot
of points. Also, whenever he found
himself struggling in the middle of
the pack in some races, he would
take some big risks that didn't
work out and would slip even far
ther down. He ended up finishing
at the tail end of all the good peo

pie."
And with as competitive a field
as was present, trying to play catch
up did not prove an easy task,
especially when those in the lead
sailed nearly flawlessly. Meade
valiantly attempted to make up
some ground, but entering the sec
ond day, he found himself in a
ninth-place hole he couldn't get
out of.
"I didn't get anything solid going
the first day," Meade said. "Even
with a couple of good races, it was
not a good feeling because I
couldn't establish a rhythm. It was
tough. I really had some problems."
The problems lessened on the
last day of competition. His finish

es in the remaining six races
included two first-place finishes,
and the rest all qualified in the top
ten. Although little changed as far
as placement, the point differen
tials decreased greatly. By the end
of the race, the biggest gap between
any of the top nine places was a
mere seven points. The ninth and
10th places though, were separated
by 40 points.
"The guys up front would have
had to make a lot of mistakes for
Charles to make up any ground,"
Bourdow said. "But he did sail well
the last day nevertheless. It's just
unfortunate he couldn't sail up to
his potential for the entire regat
ta."
