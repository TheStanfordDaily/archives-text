In only its second show of the year, the Stanford
Equestrian team shook off inexperience and rode
its way to victory.
The team spent Sunday on the Middle Ranch in
Lake View Terrace outside of Burbank, and
exceeded their own expectations by tying for High
Point Western Team, which is a dressed-up term
for first place.
"We were all surprised," said western coach
Corrine Beaudouin. "We only had one other show
we competed in."
The western team, which finished with 25
points, tied with Fresno State. Defending champi
on UC-Davis ended up in third with 15 points.
Leading the way was Duane Kracke, who won
the open stock feat event. Kracke also earned the
distinction of Reserve High Point Western Rider,
the title given to the second-best rider in the west
ern competition.
Other class champions included Quito Perlman,
who took part in advanced stock feat one, and
Ingrid Hoffman. Competing for her first time,
Hoffman rode in intermediate stock feat two while
Julie Hill finished second in intermediate stock
feat one to help the Cardinal.
The Stanford English team placed fifth and was
paced by Victoria Pettibone. Also competing for
her first time, Pettibone won the advanced walk
trot canter class while Maya Moiseyev finished
third. Amanda Hoche, Ines Diego and Katherine
Williams also represented Stanford among the
high-scorers. Hoche took third in open flats while
Diego finished third in novice flats. Williams com
peted in the walk trot class and also ended in third.
In the past, the Cardinal western team had been
consistently eclipsed by the English team and high
er showings by the western team have been rare.
"Overall the Stanford western team has tended to
live in the shadow of the English team," Perlman
said. "We [the western team] are extremely pleased."
