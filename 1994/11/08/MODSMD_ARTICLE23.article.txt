The Stanford field hockey
team ended its season on a high
note by crushing UC-Santa Bar -
bara, 5-0, Saturday on a rain
soaked field.
"It was a great way to end the
season," said senior tri-captain
Tina Syer. "We came together so
nicely. I just wish we could con
tinue playing."

The Cardinal dominated all
phases of the game. It controlled
and kept possession of the ball
while taking numerous shots and
obtaining multiple penalty cor

ners. Defensively, Stanford shut
down the Gauchos, holding them
to just one shot on goal.
"We played very well," said
head coach Sheryl Johnson. "Our
passing was very good."
Junior forward Jennifer
Gleuck sparked the Cardinal
onslaught after sophomore for
ward Baochi Nguyen passed the
ball down the right side of the
field. Syer crossed the pass into the
middle of the circle, and Glueck
took the pjiss and put it past the
Gaucho goalie. A couple of minutes
later, freshman midfielder Paige
Mader picked the ball out of a
crowd and fired into the back of the
net.
Later in the first half, sopho
more forward Kory Taylor
received a pass in the open field
and beat the goalie one-on-one for
the Cardinal's third score of the
afternoon. Sophomore midfielder
Amy Marfil closed out the first
half scoring with a lob shot per
fectly placed over the outstretched
arm of the UCSB goalie. Syer
assisted on the goal by stopping
the ball after a penalty corner.
Stanford continued to domi
nate throughout the second half.
It held the Gauchos to no shots on

goal and kept possession of the
ball for the majority of the half.
The only score of the half came off
the stick of Nguyen after she
pounced on a save rebounded off

the Gaucho goalie on a shot fired
by Taylor.
Stanford finished the year with
a 6-8-1 record and in hist place in
the Northern Pacific Conference at

2-4.
"We have a really young team,"
Johnson said. "All the skill levels
improved. It was disappointing
not to make regionals this year,
but I'm looking forward to next
year. We have a good nucleus to
build on."
This nucleus will lose only one
senior from the current team.
Unfortunately for Stanford, that
senior is Syer, the team assists
leader since her sophomore year.
This season, she received the sec
ond-most votes for the All-North
ern Pacific Conference team. The
Cardinal will compensate for that
loss by returning 10 of its starters,
including junior midfielder Elise
Morgan. Morgan, who was the
second leading scorer on last
year's team, played less than half
of Stanford's games this season
due to leg and knee injuries.
"It's sad, and I'm really going
to miss this team," Syer said.
"INext year] the team's going to
be great."
