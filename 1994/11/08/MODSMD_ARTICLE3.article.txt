## Students hold vigil against Prop. 187 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
In a last minute push to protest
Proposition 187 before today's
election, about 50 people gathered
at Memorial Church last night for
a candlelight vigil.
Representatives of several
campus groups spoke, each shar
ing a story of persecution and call
ing for the pattern to end with the
defeat of Proposition 187, a con
troversial measure that would
deny education and non-emer
gency health care to illegal immi
grants.
"I really have to wonder what
kind of hatred fuels acts like
Proposition 187," said alumnus
John Newsome, a representative
of the gay and lesbian community
who now works for the Haas Cen
ter.
Newsome compared the hatred
in the proposition to that in a re
cent shooting of a gay man in San
Francisco and called for coopera
tion among all groups that have
experienced discrimination.
Senior Jason Pu said the mea
sure will not differentiate among
Asian Americans, only between
Asian Americans and the white
community. "This is a measure
that is globally racist," he said.
The message the proposition
sends, Pu said, is that "in a nation
of immigrants, some immigrants

matter more than others."
Other speakers recalled histor
ical instances of persecution
against minorities and warned
that Proposition 187 would only
continue the negative trend.
Freshman Angie Parker cited
instances of Europeans destroy
ing Native American culture.
"Today I ask you ... not to let
racism and intolerance be incor
porated into one more govern
ment policy," she said.
Junior Aaron Lehman said
Wednesday will mark the 56th an
niversary of Kristallnacht, a night
in 1938 Germany when the Nazis
attacked Jews, their homes and
businesses and "a time when the
Jewish people were labeled as the
scapegoats of society."
The same "scapegoat" image
would be promoted by Proposi
tion 187, he said.
The debate surrounding
today's election "is about more
than a proposition," said Floyd
Thompkins, associate dean of
Memorial Church. "It's about you
and me. It's about the character of
those of use who live in this state.
"The issue is whether people of
moral courage will stand up and
fight right now — before there is
a concentration camp, before
their friend is put in prison, before
their sons and daughters are

thrown out of class.
"At some point, somebody has
to stand up and say, 'Enough is
enough,' " Thompkins said. "I
hope that everybody votes no, but
if it is not (defeated), let it be clear
that we will not stop fighting."
Proposition 187 should be
defeated because of its effect on
minority communities, not
because of costs to the majority,
graduate student Jon Blazer said.
"While we do well to heed our
own enlightened self-interest, we
must move beyond it," Blazer
said. Proposition 187 "is wrong
because it denies hardworking

immigrants the right to make a
good life for themselves and their
families."
Sophomore Jos6 Gutierrez
shared his own story of immigra
tion, telling of his father's hands,
dry and cracked from working in
the fields.
"The fields have been the
trademark not only of my father
but of all immigrant families," he
said. The people who have
enjoyed the results of such labor
"will vote to overlook the hard
work of immigrant families," he
added.
Calling for action, Gutierrez
said, "Let's get up. Let's stand
up, for we will not diminish the
hard work these people brought
to this country. I am not ashamed
of the dirt on my father's hands."
