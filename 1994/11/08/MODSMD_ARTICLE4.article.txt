# Groups face new funding hurdle
## Student organizations struggle with restrictions on alumni giving 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
In an effort to increase overall alumni giv
ing, the administration has restricted student
groups from directly soliciting alumni dona
tions, causing concern among campus leaders
that the move could further damage some al
ready-strapped organizations.
The new policy, which took effect two
months ago and also applies to all University
departments and other non-student groups af
filiated with Stanford, is part of a larger move
for general centralization of the solicitation
process in the Development Office.
Instead of contributing to individual organi
zations, the Development Office is now encour
aging alumni to donate to a new, unrestricted
Stanford Fund, said Nancy Wells, a develop-

ment officer. The fund will
support departments and
campus groups at the discre
tion of the president and the
provost, she added.
Previously, student groups
could solicit from anyone
within the alumni population
as long as they informed the
Development Office of their
targets. In fact, the office

often assisted the groups through the provi
sion of lists of alumni and other information.
The new policy prevents student groups
from soliciting money from alumni who have
not given to those groups within the last five
years, Wells said. But it also includes a five
year "phase-out plan," designed to eventually
ban groups from any solicitation of alumni,

leaving the donation field clear for develop
ment officers.
Wells said the intent of the policy is to re
strict the number of letters and solicitations
that go out to former Stanford students.
"By cutting down on letters and being more
focused, we hope to simplify our message [to
alumni] .. . encouraging them to support the
University and improve campus life," Wells
added.
At an ASSU Senate meeting last week, Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper cited poor
overall alumni giving figures to justify the need
for "a concentrated approach" in soliciting
funds. Currently, Casper said, only 30 percent
of alumni donate to the University.
