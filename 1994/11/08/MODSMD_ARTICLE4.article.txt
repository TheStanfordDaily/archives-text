# Groups face new funding hurdle
## Student organizations struggle with restrictions on alumni giving 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
In an effort to increase overall alumni giv
ing, the administration has restricted student
groups from directly soliciting alumni dona
tions, causing concern among campus leaders
that the move could further damage some al
ready-strapped organizations.
The new policy, which took effect two
months ago and also applies to all University
departments and other non-student groups af
filiated with Stanford, is part of a larger move
for general centralization of the solicitation
process in the Development Office.
Instead of contributing to individual organi
zations, the Development Office is now encour
aging alumni to donate to a new, unrestricted
Stanford Fund, said Nancy Wells, a develop-

ment officer. The fund will
support departments and
campus groups at the discre
tion of the president and the
provost, she added.
Previously, student groups
could solicit from anyone
within the alumni population
as long as they informed the
Development Office of their
targets. In fact, the office

often assisted the groups through the provi
sion of lists of alumni and other information.
The new policy prevents student groups
from soliciting money from alumni who have
not given to those groups within the last five
years, Wells said. But it also includes a five
year "phase-out plan," designed to eventually
ban groups from any solicitation of alumni,

leaving the donation field clear for develop
ment officers.
Wells said the intent of the policy is to re
strict the number of letters and solicitations
that go out to former Stanford students.
"By cutting down on letters and being more
focused, we hope to simplify our message [to
alumni] .. . encouraging them to support the
University and improve campus life," Wells
added.
At an ASSU Senate meeting last week, Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper cited poor
overall alumni giving figures to justify the need
for "a concentrated approach" in soliciting
funds. Currently, Casper said, only 30 percent
of alumni donate to the University.
For student groups who depend heavily on


Casper
alumni donations, however, the
new policy "presents some obvious
problems," said junior Jon Oram,
treasurer for Stanford-in-Govern
ment. Groups are no longer guaran
teed the same amount of money
that they could raise on their own,
he added.
For example, Oram said that
SIG members do not raise funds to
support their operating budget, but
instead use the alumni donations to
help pay for student fellowships.
"A lot of [alumni] are first-time
donors and give sporadically," he

said. "[The new policy] handicaps
us from raising a significant
amount of money to give to stu
dents."
Oram added that alumni don't
usually give right after they gradu
ate, and that therefore the new pol
icy closes off young alumni as a
resource for student groups.
Graduate student Alex Gould,
business manager at KZSU, said
the radio station had planned to
solicit alumni this year after having
a large portion of their special fee
refunded last year.
"We pretty much hit a brick wall
[with the new policy]," he said.
"Because we haven't solicited
before, we can't do it now."
Future funds are also at risk for

some groups. Stanford Review Edi
tor-in-Chief Aman Verjee said the
paper's current budget will not be
affected because the alumni who
fund its production already have a
developed pattern of giving.
"What it will hurt is our budget
for the future," said Verjee, a
senior. The new policy "is going to
limit our fundniLsing as we try to
expand our circulation ... and look
for new alumni."
However, Wells said the Stan
ford Fund is meant to meet the
greatest needs of undergraduate
life. "We have people here in the
Stanford Fund to contribute to stu
dent groups, but in a different way
this year," she said.
She added that the new policy is

not aimed at discouraging groups
from raising money, and that the
office is looking at ways to advise
student groups about alternative
means of supplementing their bud
gets.
Nevertheless, the impact on
many student groups will not be
minimal.
"There are a lot of groups that
don't do significant fundraising ofT
campus, but a lot do," said Nanci
Howe, director of the Office of Stu
dent Activities. "It will impact the
income of some student organiza
tions. ... One of the best avenues of
funding will be restricted."
The new policy has prompted
the Council of Presidents to meet
with administration officials to dis

cuss its implementation.
The COP met with Casper early
last week in an effort to ensure that
undergraduate interests are looked
after as money from the new Stan
ford Fund is allocated to student
groups on campus.
"We want to create a program to
prioritize decisions" about the allo
cations, COP member Anietie
Ekanem said.
"It is unclear how the money will
be given out to student groups," he
said. "We gave the suggestion that
the COP and the President's Office
work together to see that the prop
er priority is given [to student
groups!."
Ekanem added that sometimes
administration "don't know what

undergraduates want," citing the
hunger strike last spring as an exam
ple of communication problems.
Another problem may stem from
a kind of communication glitch:
some campus groups remain
unaware of the new policy.
Senior Jeff Baird, president of
Sigma Nu, said last night that he
had not heard of the new policy. "I
really can't say (what impact the
restrictions might have) until I see
the policy," he said.
Senior Nirav Tolia, finance man
ager for the Fleet Street Singers,
also said he was unaware of the pol
icy but that the new regulation
would be unlikely to affect the a
cappella group because it rarely
solicits donations.

affected because the alumni who
fund its production already have a
developed pattern of giving.
"What it will hurt is our budget
for the future," said Verjee, a
senior. The new policy "is going to
limit our fundniLsing as we try to
expand our circulation ... and look
for new alumni."
However, Wells said the Stan
ford Fund is meant to meet the
greatest needs of undergraduate
life. "We have people here in the
Stanford Fund to contribute to stu
dent groups, but in a different way
this year," she said.
She added that the new policy is

not aimed at discouraging groups
from raising money, and that the
office is looking at ways to advise
student groups about alternative
means of supplementing their bud
gets.
Nevertheless, the impact on
many student groups will not be
minimal.
"There are a lot of groups that
don't do significant fundraising ofT
campus, but a lot do," said Nanci
Howe, director of the Office of Stu
dent Activities. "It will impact the
income of some student organiza
tions. ... One of the best avenues of
funding will be restricted."
The new policy has prompted
the Council of Presidents to meet
with administration officials to dis

cuss its implementation.
The COP met with Casper early
last week in an effort to ensure that
undergraduate interests are looked
after as money from the new Stan
ford Fund is allocated to student
groups on campus.
"We want to create a program to
prioritize decisions" about the allo
cations, COP member Anietie
Ekanem said.
"It is unclear how the money will
be given out to student groups," he
said. "We gave the suggestion that
the COP and the President's Office
work together to see that the prop
er priority is given [to student
groups!."
Ekanem added that sometimes
administration "don't know what

undergraduates want," citing the
hunger strike last spring as an exam
ple of communication problems.
Another problem may stem from
a kind of communication glitch:
some campus groups remain
unaware of the new policy.
Senior Jeff Baird, president of
Sigma Nu, said last night that he
had not heard of the new policy. "I
really can't say (what impact the
restrictions might have) until I see
the policy," he said.
Senior Nirav Tolia, finance man
ager for the Fleet Street Singers,
also said he was unaware of the pol
icy but that the new regulation
would be unlikely to affect the a
cappella group because it rarely
solicits donations.
In an effort to increase overall alumni giv
ing, the administration has restricted student
groups from directly soliciting alumni dona
tions, causing concern among campus leaders
that the move could further damage some al
ready-strapped organizations.
The new policy, which took effect two
months ago and also applies to all University
departments and other non-student groups af
filiated with Stanford, is part of a larger move
for general centralization of the solicitation
process in the Development Office.
Instead of contributing to individual organi
zations, the Development Office is now encour
aging alumni to donate to a new, unrestricted
Stanford Fund, said Nancy Wells, a develop-

ment officer. The fund will
support departments and
campus groups at the discre
tion of the president and the
provost, she added.
Previously, student groups
could solicit from anyone
within the alumni population
as long as they informed the
Development Office of their
targets. In fact, the office

often assisted the groups through the provi
sion of lists of alumni and other information.
The new policy prevents student groups
from soliciting money from alumni who have
not given to those groups within the last five
years, Wells said. But it also includes a five
year "phase-out plan," designed to eventually
ban groups from any solicitation of alumni,

leaving the donation field clear for develop
ment officers.
Wells said the intent of the policy is to re
strict the number of letters and solicitations
that go out to former Stanford students.
"By cutting down on letters and being more
focused, we hope to simplify our message [to
alumni] .. . encouraging them to support the
University and improve campus life," Wells
added.
At an ASSU Senate meeting last week, Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper cited poor
overall alumni giving figures to justify the need
for "a concentrated approach" in soliciting
funds. Currently, Casper said, only 30 percent
of alumni donate to the University.
For student groups who depend heavily on


Casper
alumni donations, however, the
new policy "presents some obvious
problems," said junior Jon Oram,
treasurer for Stanford-in-Govern
ment. Groups are no longer guaran
teed the same amount of money
that they could raise on their own,
he added.
For example, Oram said that
SIG members do not raise funds to
support their operating budget, but
instead use the alumni donations to
help pay for student fellowships.
"A lot of [alumni] are first-time
donors and give sporadically," he

said. "[The new policy] handicaps
us from raising a significant
amount of money to give to stu
dents."
Oram added that alumni don't
usually give right after they gradu
ate, and that therefore the new pol
icy closes off young alumni as a
resource for student groups.
Graduate student Alex Gould,
business manager at KZSU, said
the radio station had planned to
solicit alumni this year after having
a large portion of their special fee
refunded last year.
"We pretty much hit a brick wall
[with the new policy]," he said.
"Because we haven't solicited
before, we can't do it now."
Future funds are also at risk for

some groups. Stanford Review Edi
tor-in-Chief Aman Verjee said the
paper's current budget will not be
affected because the alumni who
fund its production already have a
developed pattern of giving.
"What it will hurt is our budget
for the future," said Verjee, a
