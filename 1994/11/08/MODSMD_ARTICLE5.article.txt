# Students go to S.F. to protest Zhirinovsky
## Join thousands in speak out against Russian nationalist ELECTION 94 
### Ben Sussman Contributing writer 
About 30 students from Stanford's Hillel and
Students Against Genocide chapters joined a
crowd of more than 1,000 protesters in San
Francisco last night to speak out against Russian
ultra-nationalist politician Vladimir Zhiri
novsky.
Zhirinovsky, who heads Russia's Liberal De
mocratic Party, gave a speech at the Sheraton
Palace Hotel for the World Affairs Council of San
Francisco.
Over the course of his political career, Zhiri
novsky has made himself known for vicious anti-
Semitic and racist remarks. According to litera
ture put out by the Jewish Community Relations
Council — one of the groups sponsoring last
night's protest — he has blamed Jews for start
ing both world wars and claims that he "will fol
low in Hitler's footsteps."
This comparison to the Holocaust spurred
many Bay Area Jewish groups into action. "What
[Zhirinovskyl is saying is morally repugnant,"
said Hillel Program Director Michael Latz. "His
plan to rid Russia of Jews goes against what we
believe in."
In addition, Zhirinovsky has publicly threat-

ened that, should he gain power
in Russia, he would be willing to
utilize Russia's nuclear
weapons to achieve his goals.
"When extremists have
power and access to nuclear
weapons, the entire [political]
landscape has changed," Latz
said.
Last night's protesters —
who came from many Bay Area
colleges and organizations —
sought to call attention to Zhiri
novsky's views and political
record. In Russia's 1993 elec
tions, Zhirinovsky's Liberal
Democratic Party won nearly
one-quarter of the vote, leading
all other competitors.
"Basically, he's a hate-mon
ger, and it would be a shame if
the American public were
unaware of his stance." said
junior Seth Yoskowitz, vice
president of Hillel's Synagogue
Board.
The fact that Zhirnovsky won
"25 percent of the Russian pop
ulation is a real threat,"
Yoskowitz added.
However, according to
Michael Jacobs, a Stanford
alumnus and chair of the Jew
ish Community Relations Coun
cil, Zhirinovsky attempted to
tone down his image in last
night's speech.
" 'I'm not an anti-Semite,' "
Jacobs quoted Zhirinovsky as
saying. " 'I'm not a racist. I'm
not a nationalist. I just want to
bring the best to Russia.' "

The speech excerpts brought
jeers from the crowd, and an
equally doubtful response from
Jacobs, who compared the
politician to a virus within Rus
sian society.
Jacobs called upon the Rus
sian people to "defeat [Zhiri
novsky] before he becomes a
sickness in Russia that cannot
be cured."
A number of other speakers
addressed the crowd, including
U.S. Reps. Nancy Pelosi (D-San
Francisco) and Tom Lantos CD-
San Mateo).
Pelosi led the crowd in chant
ing "never again," echoing a
popular Jewish slogan used for
the Holocaust. She also said
that, while San Francisco main
tained a "tolerant" attitude
toward Zhirinovsky, the city's
willingness to let him speak was
"not to be misinterpreted as
condoning his message."
However, many in the crowd
were displeased that Zhiri
novsky had even been granted a
visa to enter the United States.
"The State Department has
made an enormous mistake,"
Lantos said.
Stanford graduate student
Michael Rothenberg, chair of
student affairs for SAGE — a
group which focuses on the
ongoing atrocities in the former
Yugoslavia — also spoke to
protesters.
He addressed Zhirinovsky's
record in Bosnia, saying that
the politician openly supports
the genocide perpetrated by
Serbs against Moslem Bosnians.
"In Bosnia," Rothenberg said,
"the words are 'yes, again.' "
