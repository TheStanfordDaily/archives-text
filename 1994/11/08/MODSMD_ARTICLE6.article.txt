# Eshoo spends election eve talking politics over pizza
## Stanford representative pays visit to Law School 
### Neha Gupta 
In a "last-minute encouragement to
vote," U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo shared pizza
and political views with a crowd of stu
dents and faculty at the Law School last
night.
"Of all that I'm doing, this is something
that I have been looking forward to the
most," said Eshoo of the informal event,
which was co-sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau and Stanford in Govern
ment.
The Democratic congresswoman was
elected in 1992 to represent the 14th Con
gressional District, which includes Stan
ford and the surrounding area.
Criticizing prevalent attitudes about
government, Eshoo issued a call for faith in
the political process to the crowd of about
60, later fielding questions both publicly
and in an interview with The Daily.
Eshoo spoke about negative campaign
ing and, in general, about how negative atti
tudes towards politicians need to change.
"People need to return to thinking of a ca
reer in public service as one of the noblest
careers," she said.
More and more politicians say, "I
promise you I will do nothing," Eshoo
noted.
She encouraged students to realize that
the government is a vehicle for change. For
example, government is responsible for the
many gains made thus far by the United
States in areas such as civil rights, Eshoo

noted.
Legislation isn't perfect, she added, be
cause "it reflects humanity."
"This is one of the most dangerous sea
sons and it won't end tomorrow night,"
Eshoo said of the mudslinging and negative
attitudes evident in the current campaigns.
"This is the beginning of yet another chap-

School yesterday.
ter. If more of this takes place in
Congress with this attitude, then
the nation won't be well-served.
"Unfortunately there is not
truth in advertising. I've never
engaged in a negative campaign
and I'm not going to start now,"
Eshoo added. "The only way to
turn this around is if the public
doesn't reward those that do."
When pressed as to whom she
would vote for in the senatorial
race between U.S. Senator Dianne
Feinstein and U.S. Rep. Michael
HufFington to uphold her theory of
not rewarding those who enrage in

negative campaigning, Eshoo
evaded the question by focusing on
how the advertisements were not
uplifting to people.
Later she said that if she were
Feinstein, she would try to raise
money to speak directly with peo
ple through television, warning
them about Huffington's deep
pockets and asking them to see
through the advertisements to the
real issues.
"You have to say something
because people buy into this type
of negative advertising," said
Eshoo.
If re-elected, Eshoo said she
would like to see a return to civili
ty in the House of Representa
tives, because "the last two to
three weeks in the House were

filled with a lot of bitterness."
Two years of work was all voted
down within the last 10 days of the
103 rd Congress with the failure of
bills on health care reform and
environmental protection, Eshoo
recalled.
Following her presentation,
Eshoo answered questions about
several Stanford issues, including
this summer's $200 million cut in
Department of Defense funding to
research universities and the
recent settlement of the Universi
ty's long-standing indirect-cost dis
pute with the federal government.
"I fought hard to have the DOD
cut be a minimum cut with the
understanding that all budgets
were being cut," she said, adding
"I think everyone is relieved that

the indirect-cost issue has been
resolved."
In addition, Eshoo offered her
views on California Proposition
187, a measure which would make
undocumented immigrants ineli
gible for social services including
health care and education.
"I'm glad that this campus has
taken a stance against Prop. 187.
"Imagine that it is called 'Save our
state,' " she said. "I think it will
have an impact on this campus,
land] it could have a financial
impact on California."
As for her Republican opponent
Ben Brink, Eshoo said, "I don't
know what he believes in. I
haven't heard him speak on core
values. He talks a lot about regula
tion."
