# GOP shift possible in Congress
## 
### 
A surly, sullen midterm cam
paign sure to increase Republican
clout in Congress closed yester
day with President Clinton
imploring voters to keep
Democrats in control. A dozen or
more big races hinged on which
party proved best at getting its
voters to the polls.
As is tradition, candidates
plunged into one last day of hand
shakes and rallies — and paid for
one last night of attack ads. Clin
ton visited three states, hoping to
tilt a few Senate contests his way.
Democrats felt somewhat bet
ter about their incumbents'
chances in the combative Senate
contests in Pennsylvania and Vir
ginia, but Republicans still were

within clear striking distance of
the a Senate majority.
By itself, that would tilt the
balance of power for the second
half of Clinton's term, forcing
him to regroup on such issues as
the balanced budget amendment,
health care and welfare reform.
And gaining the 40 seats nec
essary to control the House for
the first time since the Eisen
hower administration was hardly
out of the GOP's reach.
With so many races neck-and
neck, the parties could agree on
one thing election eve: turnout
operations would prove the key in
the Senate races likely to decide
who runs the chamber come Jan
uary, and in a few close state

house battles as well.
Democrats have a 56-44 Sen
ate majority, meaning Republi
cans need a seven-seat gain to
capture that chamber for the
first time since 1986. Democrats
conceded the GOP was well on its
way — heavily favored to gain
Democratic seats in Maine, Ohio,
Arizona and Tennessee.
Virginia had perhaps the most
unpredictable contest of all —
pitting incumbent Democrat
Charles S. Robb against former
Reagan White House aide, and
Iran-Contra hand, Oliver North.
Robb pulled ahead in late
polls, narrowly, and desperately
needed good turnout among
black voters.
