Attention:
Stanford University Employees
Private Physicians Group at Stanford (PPGS) is again being
offered to you as a health care network through the Blue
Shield Stanford Triple Option Plan. PPGS is a multi-specialty
group of 250 of the most respected physicians in their fields.
All practice near Stanford Hospital.
PPGS offers its members many unique features:
•PPGS physicians practice from their own private
office, not in a clinic.
•Authorizations for specialist services are processed
within 48 hours.
•Most 08/Gyn physicians are primary care
providers.
During Open Enrollment (November 1 - November 23), you
can become a member of PPGS by selecting one of our
more than 50 primary care physicians. Come to the Stanford
Triple Option booth at the Health Fair, November 8, 9, and 10
for more information and receive a free gift from PPGS.
