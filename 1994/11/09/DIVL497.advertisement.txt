You want Joe Schmo's phone number.
Arid Flo Schmo's. You have to meet them at the Art library.
You need to know where it is. And while you're at it,
when does it close? And where can you all go for dinner?
You want Italian. You want to see the menu first.
And to get there, how about a map?
You'll find the answers in here.

The shiny new 94-95 Stanford Directory
will arrive on campus next week. It isn't just

thousands of dollars worth of coupons, color
maps with street indexes, a revamped
University Information Guide, and more.
This book has more answers than you have questions.
