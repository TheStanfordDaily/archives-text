Ralph Wiley
What Black People
Should Do Now:
Dispatches from Near the Vanguard
(One World/Ballantine, $12.00)
Meet Ralph Wiley. He's young, gifted
and brash. He's one of the hottest new
voices chronicling the African-American experience. 1991 marked Wiley's
debut as a critic of popular American culture with the publication of his
controversial and critically acclaimed book, Why Black People Tend to Shout In
his newest collection of essays, What Black People Should Do Now, Wiley con
tinues his role of artist as agitator in twenty-two explosive pieces where
race, politics and culture collide with the reality of black survival in
America. Covering diverse topics, Wiley fearlessly confronts the many
curiosities and frailties of African-American life. His work burns with the
challenge to think before you act
A veteran journalist, Wiley is also the author of Serenity: a Boxing
Memoir; and the co-author, with Spike Lee, of By Any Means Necessary: The
Dials and Tribulations of the Making of Malcolm X. His work has appeared in
Sports Illustrated, Emerge and Premiere magazines.
