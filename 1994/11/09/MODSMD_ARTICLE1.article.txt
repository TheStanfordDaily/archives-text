Two years ago today, the De
mocrats were euphoric, havingjust
gained the White House and re
tained both houses of Congress.
Two years later, a gain of eight
senators and 51 representatives in
yesterday's elections has given Re
publicans control of both houses of
Congress for the first time in 40
years.
In analyzing the results, some
point at anti-incumbent feelings,
others at Democratic failures, but
one thing is certain: explaining why
and how this happened will be fod
der for political commentators and
professors to feed on for at least 40
years to come.
According to Political Science
Prof. Terry Moe, voters' desire for a
Republican majority in the Senate
and the House is a strong indication
of dissatisfaction.
"People are fed up with politi
cians and with big government and
are registering a protest vote," he
said. "It doesn't mean that people
have suddenly turned Republican."
His colleague, Political Science
Prof. Luis Fraga, agreed that voters

Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and Democ
rat Sen. Dianne Feinstein were both re-elect
ed to second terms yesterday, and a contro
versial measure to deny health care and
other benefits to illegal immigrants was ap
proved by a three-to-two vote.
But the main news of the day was the na
tionwide tide of GOP victories, which gave
Republicans control of both houses of Con
gress for the first time since 1954.
Overall, Republicans gained eight seats in
the Senate, 51 in the house and 11 governor
ships.
As a result, Sen. Bob Dole will likely take
over as Senate Majority Leader, and Rep.
Newt Gingrich will become Speaker of the
House of Representatives.
In addition, as the majority party, Repub
licans will now chair all Congressional com
mittees and subcommittees.
Election Day was not only a bleak day for

Democrats but also for women and minori
ties who suffered losses nationwide. The
number of female governors decreased from
four to one.
The estimated 8.8 million Californians
who cast their ballots yesterday were asked
to chose a governor, U.S. senator and decide
on a number of propositions on issues rang
ing from health care to smoking.
After one of the most costly gubernatorial
races in California's history, Wilson bounced
back from approval ratings that had sunk as
low as 15 percent to easily beat Brown by 55
percent to 41 percent.
In his acceptance speech in Los Angeles,
Wilson told a cheering crowd of supporters
that observers had underestimated him, as
well as the state of California.
"As I said after the Northridge quake,
they can shake us, but they can't break us,"
he said.
Wilson admitted last night that the odds
of re-election were stacked against him.
