# GOP takes over Congress in unprecedented sweep
## Wilson retains office, Feinstein edges out Huffington in late night nail-biter Many see votes as reflection of dissatisfaction 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer Beth Berselli Senior staff writer with AP wire reports 
Two years ago today, the De
mocrats were euphoric, havingjust
gained the White House and re
tained both houses of Congress.
Two years later, a gain of eight
senators and 51 representatives in
yesterday's elections has given Re
publicans control of both houses of
Congress for the first time in 40
years.
In analyzing the results, some
point at anti-incumbent feelings,
others at Democratic failures, but
one thing is certain: explaining why
and how this happened will be fod
der for political commentators and
professors to feed on for at least 40
years to come.
According to Political Science
Prof. Terry Moe, voters' desire for a
Republican majority in the Senate
and the House is a strong indication
of dissatisfaction.
"People are fed up with politi
cians and with big government and
are registering a protest vote," he
said. "It doesn't mean that people
have suddenly turned Republican."
His colleague, Political Science
Prof. Luis Fraga, agreed that voters

Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and Democ
rat Sen. Dianne Feinstein were both re-elect
ed to second terms yesterday, and a contro
versial measure to deny health care and
other benefits to illegal immigrants was ap
proved by a three-to-two vote.
But the main news of the day was the na
tionwide tide of GOP victories, which gave
Republicans control of both houses of Con
gress for the first time since 1954.
Overall, Republicans gained eight seats in
the Senate, 51 in the house and 11 governor
ships.
As a result, Sen. Bob Dole will likely take
over as Senate Majority Leader, and Rep.
Newt Gingrich will become Speaker of the
House of Representatives.
In addition, as the majority party, Repub
licans will now chair all Congressional com
mittees and subcommittees.
Election Day was not only a bleak day for

Democrats but also for women and minori
ties who suffered losses nationwide. The
number of female governors decreased from
four to one.
The estimated 8.8 million Californians
who cast their ballots yesterday were asked
to chose a governor, U.S. senator and decide
on a number of propositions on issues rang
ing from health care to smoking.
After one of the most costly gubernatorial
races in California's history, Wilson bounced
back from approval ratings that had sunk as
low as 15 percent to easily beat Brown by 55
percent to 41 percent.
In his acceptance speech in Los Angeles,
Wilson told a cheering crowd of supporters
that observers had underestimated him, as
well as the state of California.
"As I said after the Northridge quake,
they can shake us, but they can't break us,"
he said.
Wilson admitted last night that the odds
of re-election were stacked against him.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein thanks her supporters while the fate of her race against Michael
Huffington remained uncertain. The Associated Press later declared her the winner.
"It wasn't too long ago that
the smart-money pundits were
not only writing me off, they
were writing off California," he
said. "About a year ago, I think
I faced longer odds than George
Foreman."

Conceding defeat, Brown
said she will help Wilson "chart
California through this diffi
cult passage in our history. To
take these crises we face and
turn them into opportunities,
for our Californians deserve no
less."
As for the Senate race, Fein

stein barely edged out Huffing
ton 47 percent to 45 percent.
The race was so close that it
wasn't called until early this
morning. Huffington led in the
early returns, but Feinstein
eventually caught up and took
the lead.
"What a cliffhanger," Fein

stein told supporters at San
Francisco's Fairmont Hotel last
night. "It seems to me we don't
know what the final result is
going to be. We are going to
wait and see what those results
are."
"It is clear watching what's
happening across the country
that the Republicans are having
an unbelievable victory," Huff
ington told supporters at his
Costa Mesa campaign head
quarters. "And what we want to
do in California tonight is add
to that victory."
The Huffington-Feinstein
race — which in its final days
was dominated by personal
issues like the candidate's hir
ing of illegal aliens — set a new
record for spending in Senate
races at $41 million. Huffing
ton chipped in $27 million of
his personal fortune to the
campaign.
According to an exit poll by
Voter News Service, Feinstein
was supported by voters who
felt she had more experience,
was better able to deal with the
state's economy, and knew Cal
ifornia better than Huffington,
who moved from his native
Texas to California in 1991.
Huffington served just two
years in Congress while Fein
stein has more than 20 years in
public office, including a stint
as the mayor of San Francisco.
The poll also found that Wil
son drew support from voters
with family incomes over
$100,000 while the lowest
income group favored Brown.
Women were divided 50-50
between the two candidates,
while only 40 percent of male
voters supported Brown, the
poll found.

According to the poll, voters
concerned about crime and ille
gal immigration overwhelming
favored Wilson, who supported
Proposition 187 and criticized
Brown's opposition to the death
penalty.
Proposition 187 — which
was approved 59 percent to 41
percent — was indeed a key
issue for both the gubernatorial
and Senate race.
Wilson and Huffington sup
ported the measure, which will
deny health, education and
social services to undocument
ed immigrants and require
reporting of "suspected" illegal
immigrants to the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
Brown and Feinstein both
opposed the measure.
Opponents of 187 — who
have challenged the constitu
tionality of the proposition's
provisions — said they will file
an injunction against the mea
sure today. The measure is
expected to go all the way to the
United States Supreme Court.
In other propositions, Propo
sition 184, which will reaffirm
the "three strikes you're out"
law recently passed by the state
government, was approved 72
percent to 28 percent.
Proposition 186 to institute
a state-run, "single-payer"
health-care system was defeat
ed 73 percent to 27 percent.
And proposition 188, the
tobacco industry-sponsored
measure to preempt all local
smoking ordinances, was
defeated 71 percent to 29 per
cent.
Californians also voted on
seven state offices, four of
which were filled by Republi
cans.

Democrats Gray Davis,
Delaine Eastin and Kathleen
Connell captured the offices of
lieutenant governor, state
superintendent of public
instruction and state controller
respectively.
Davis defeated Republican
Cathie Wright 53 percent to 40
percent, while Eastin beat
Republican-backed Maureen
DiMarco 56 percent to 44 per
cent.
Eastin will be the first
female superintendent in Cali
fornia's history.
Republican incumbent Dan
Lungren defeated Democrat
Tom Umberg for attorney gen
eral, and Republican Matt Eong
defeated Democrat Phil
Angelides for treasurer.
Republican Chuck Quacken
bush will be California's next
insurance commissioner. With
96 percent of the votes counted
early this morning, Republican
Bill Jones had a slight lead over
Democrat Tony Miller for sec
retary of state.
"This is a glorious day to be a
Republican," Lungren said.
"We have made a change in
America and California that's
going to last a long, long time."
In local elections, Democrat
ic incumbent U.S. Rep. Anna
Eshoo held on to her 14th con
gressional district seat, defeat
ing Republican Ben Brink 61
percent to 39 percent.
Stanford Law School Prof.
Byron Sher, a democrat, was
re-elected to the state assem
bly, defeating Republican and
Stanford student Bill Mills.

were not specifically endorsing the
Republican party, but were express
ing an anti-incumbent, anti-govern
ment feeling.
"Many were voting against
incumbents or against any individu
al who had the view that govern
ment could somehow help," he said.
Edwin Meese, Attorney General
under Ronald Reagan, said that the
American people were acting specifi
cally to repudiate Bill Clinton.
"Most of us recognize that the
public is not happy with what is
going on," he said. "Yet I did not
expect the magnitude of this change.
This is a major change in terms of
how many seats switched positions.
This race was not only a "No"
vote against Democratic policy or an
admonishment of Bill Clinton, but
according to Hoover Institution
Senior Fellow Martin Anderson, the
vote was also a clear endorsement of
Republican ideology.
"This race was an ideological ref
erendum," he said. "People are vot
ing against what they don't believe
and for what they do believe."

Meese agreed that voters were
effectively saying that the Republi
can party represented America's
best hope.
"You will see a less oppressive
government," Meese said. "You will
see a Congress that will not increase
the amount of government regula
tions that burden the people.
"This will be the first time in 40
years that the Republicans have con
trol of both houses," he said.
"Because of that you are going to get
away from the centralization of
power we have seen in the last two
years."
Many political experts agree on
the shape that Republican reform
will take. "They will be trying to pur
sue a balanced budget and decrease
the size of government," Moe said.
"Basically, they will try to construct
a Republican agenda that they can
win on in 1996."
Anderson said that the Republi
cans will most likely attempt to
quickly establish their popularity
with the American people. "They
will send out a law for term limits
and they will probably send a bal
anced budget amendment out to the
states for discussion and ratifica
tion," he said.
He predicted that the Republi

cans might immediately put forward
a politically attractive bill which stip
ulates that the Congress is not
exempt from the laws that apply to
the American people.
For Republicans to succeed, Moe
emphasized the need for them to
define an agenda and take construc
tive action on their own. "The word
is positive change," he said.
However, with a Democratic
president and a Republican majority
in Congress, such change will be dif
ficult to manufacture.
"Clinton and the Republicans
might be able to agree on welfare
reform but for the most part Clinton
is in for some big trouble," Moe said.
"Health care is an impossible dream
now. Basically, Clinton was pursu
ing a liberal agenda and he won't be
able to do that anymore. Politics will
have to come into the center."
Moe says he expects Clinton to
adapt to the new face of Congress in
order to do what is necessary to
make changes occur.
Fraga agreed, saying that "Clin
ton will continue to try to make
things work. But he is in an even
more difficult position in dealing
with the Congress. The key is how
willing the Congress will be with
dealing with him."

Republican party, but were express
ing an anti-incumbent, anti-govern
ment feeling.
"Many were voting against
incumbents or against any individu
al who had the view that govern
ment could somehow help," he said.
Edwin Meese, Attorney General
under Ronald Reagan, said that the
American people were acting specifi
cally to repudiate Bill Clinton.
"Most of us recognize that the
public is not happy with what is
going on," he said. "Yet I did not
expect the magnitude of this change.
This is a major change in terms of
how many seats switched positions.
This race was not only a "No"
vote against Democratic policy or an
admonishment of Bill Clinton, but
according to Hoover Institution
Senior Fellow Martin Anderson, the
vote was also a clear endorsement of
Republican ideology.
"This race was an ideological ref
erendum," he said. "People are vot
ing against what they don't believe
and for what they do believe."

Meese agreed that voters were
effectively saying that the Republi
can party represented America's
best hope.
"You will see a less oppressive
government," Meese said. "You will
see a Congress that will not increase
the amount of government regula
tions that burden the people.
"This will be the first time in 40
years that the Republicans have con
trol of both houses," he said.
"Because of that you are going to get
away from the centralization of
power we have seen in the last two
years."
Many political experts agree on
the shape that Republican reform
will take. "They will be trying to pur
sue a balanced budget and decrease
the size of government," Moe said.
"Basically, they will try to construct
a Republican agenda that they can
win on in 1996."
Anderson said that the Republi
cans will most likely attempt to
quickly establish their popularity
with the American people. "They
will send out a law for term limits
and they will probably send a bal
anced budget amendment out to the
states for discussion and ratifica
tion," he said.
He predicted that the Republi

cans might immediately put forward
a politically attractive bill which stip
ulates that the Congress is not
exempt from the laws that apply to
the American people.
For Republicans to succeed, Moe
emphasized the need for them to
define an agenda and take construc
tive action on their own. "The word
is positive change," he said.
However, with a Democratic
president and a Republican majority
in Congress, such change will be dif
ficult to manufacture.
"Clinton and the Republicans
might be able to agree on welfare
reform but for the most part Clinton
is in for some big trouble," Moe said.
"Health care is an impossible dream
now. Basically, Clinton was pursu
ing a liberal agenda and he won't be
able to do that anymore. Politics will
have to come into the center."
Moe says he expects Clinton to
adapt to the new face of Congress in
order to do what is necessary to
make changes occur.
Fraga agreed, saying that "Clin
ton will continue to try to make
things work. But he is in an even
more difficult position in dealing
with the Congress. The key is how
willing the Congress will be with
dealing with him."
Two years ago today, the De
mocrats were euphoric, havingjust
gained the White House and re
tained both houses of Congress.
Two years later, a gain of eight
senators and 51 representatives in
yesterday's elections has given Re
publicans control of both houses of
Congress for the first time in 40
years.
In analyzing the results, some
point at anti-incumbent feelings,
others at Democratic failures, but
one thing is certain: explaining why
and how this happened will be fod
der for political commentators and
professors to feed on for at least 40
years to come.
According to Political Science
Prof. Terry Moe, voters' desire for a
Republican majority in the Senate
and the House is a strong indication
of dissatisfaction.
"People are fed up with politi
cians and with big government and
are registering a protest vote," he
said. "It doesn't mean that people
have suddenly turned Republican."
His colleague, Political Science
Prof. Luis Fraga, agreed that voters

Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and Democ
rat Sen. Dianne Feinstein were both re-elect
ed to second terms yesterday, and a contro
versial measure to deny health care and
other benefits to illegal immigrants was ap
proved by a three-to-two vote.
But the main news of the day was the na
tionwide tide of GOP victories, which gave
Republicans control of both houses of Con
gress for the first time since 1954.
Overall, Republicans gained eight seats in
the Senate, 51 in the house and 11 governor
ships.
As a result, Sen. Bob Dole will likely take
over as Senate Majority Leader, and Rep.
Newt Gingrich will become Speaker of the
House of Representatives.
In addition, as the majority party, Repub
licans will now chair all Congressional com
mittees and subcommittees.
Election Day was not only a bleak day for

Democrats but also for women and minori
ties who suffered losses nationwide. The
number of female governors decreased from
four to one.
The estimated 8.8 million Californians
who cast their ballots yesterday were asked
to chose a governor, U.S. senator and decide
on a number of propositions on issues rang
ing from health care to smoking.
After one of the most costly gubernatorial
races in California's history, Wilson bounced
back from approval ratings that had sunk as
low as 15 percent to easily beat Brown by 55
percent to 41 percent.
In his acceptance speech in Los Angeles,
Wilson told a cheering crowd of supporters
that observers had underestimated him, as
well as the state of California.
"As I said after the Northridge quake,
they can shake us, but they can't break us,"
he said.
Wilson admitted last night that the odds
of re-election were stacked against him.


Meghna Chakrabarti — Daily
Sen. Dianne Feinstein thanks her supporters while the fate of her race against Michael
Huffington remained uncertain. The Associated Press later declared her the winner.
"It wasn't too long ago that
the smart-money pundits were
not only writing me off, they
were writing off California," he
said. "About a year ago, I think
I faced longer odds than George
Foreman."

Conceding defeat, Brown
said she will help Wilson "chart
California through this diffi
cult passage in our history. To
take these crises we face and
turn them into opportunities,
for our Californians deserve no
less."
As for the Senate race, Fein

stein barely edged out Huffing
ton 47 percent to 45 percent.
The race was so close that it
wasn't called until early this
morning. Huffington led in the
early returns, but Feinstein
eventually caught up and took
the lead.
"What a cliffhanger," Fein

stein told supporters at San
Francisco's Fairmont Hotel last
night. "It seems to me we don't
know what the final result is
going to be. We are going to
wait and see what those results
are."
"It is clear watching what's
happening across the country
that the Republicans are having
an unbelievable victory," Huff
ington told supporters at his
Costa Mesa campaign head
quarters. "And what we want to
do in California tonight is add
to that victory."
The Huffington-Feinstein
race — which in its final days
was dominated by personal
issues like the candidate's hir
ing of illegal aliens — set a new
record for spending in Senate
races at $41 million. Huffing
ton chipped in $27 million of
his personal fortune to the
campaign.
According to an exit poll by
Voter News Service, Feinstein
was supported by voters who
felt she had more experience,
was better able to deal with the
state's economy, and knew Cal
ifornia better than Huffington,
who moved from his native
Texas to California in 1991.
Huffington served just two
years in Congress while Fein
stein has more than 20 years in
public office, including a stint
as the mayor of San Francisco.
The poll also found that Wil
son drew support from voters
with family incomes over
$100,000 while the lowest
income group favored Brown.
Women were divided 50-50
between the two candidates,
while only 40 percent of male
voters supported Brown, the
poll found.

According to the poll, voters
concerned about crime and ille
gal immigration overwhelming
favored Wilson, who supported
Proposition 187 and criticized
Brown's opposition to the death
penalty.
Proposition 187 — which
was approved 59 percent to 41
percent — was indeed a key
issue for both the gubernatorial
and Senate race.
Wilson and Huffington sup
ported the measure, which will
deny health, education and
social services to undocument
ed immigrants and require
reporting of "suspected" illegal
immigrants to the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
Brown and Feinstein both
opposed the measure.
Opponents of 187 — who
have challenged the constitu
tionality of the proposition's
provisions — said they will file
an injunction against the mea
sure today. The measure is
expected to go all the way to the
United States Supreme Court.
In other propositions, Propo
sition 184, which will reaffirm
the "three strikes you're out"
law recently passed by the state
government, was approved 72
percent to 28 percent.
Proposition 186 to institute
a state-run, "single-payer"
health-care system was defeat
ed 73 percent to 27 percent.
And proposition 188, the
tobacco industry-sponsored
measure to preempt all local
smoking ordinances, was
defeated 71 percent to 29 per
cent.
Californians also voted on
seven state offices, four of
which were filled by Republi
cans.

Democrats Gray Davis,
Delaine Eastin and Kathleen
Connell captured the offices of
lieutenant governor, state
superintendent of public
instruction and state controller
respectively.
Davis defeated Republican
Cathie Wright 53 percent to 40
percent, while Eastin beat
Republican-backed Maureen
DiMarco 56 percent to 44 per
cent.
Eastin will be the first
female superintendent in Cali
fornia's history.
Republican incumbent Dan
Lungren defeated Democrat
Tom Umberg for attorney gen
eral, and Republican Matt Eong
defeated Democrat Phil
Angelides for treasurer.
Republican Chuck Quacken
bush will be California's next
insurance commissioner. With
96 percent of the votes counted
early this morning, Republican
Bill Jones had a slight lead over
Democrat Tony Miller for sec
retary of state.
"This is a glorious day to be a
Republican," Lungren said.
"We have made a change in
America and California that's
going to last a long, long time."
In local elections, Democrat
ic incumbent U.S. Rep. Anna
Eshoo held on to her 14th con
gressional district seat, defeat
ing Republican Ben Brink 61
percent to 39 percent.

public office, including a stint
as the mayor of San Francisco.
The poll also found that Wil
son drew support from voters
with family incomes over
$100,000 while the lowest
income group favored Brown.
Women were divided 50-50
between the two candidates,
while only 40 percent of male
voters supported Brown, the
poll found.

According to the poll, voters
concerned about crime and ille
gal immigration overwhelming
favored Wilson, who supported
Proposition 187 and criticized
Brown's opposition to the death
penalty.
Proposition 187 — which
was approved 59 percent to 41
percent — was indeed a key
issue for both the gubernatorial
and Senate race.
Wilson and Huffington sup
ported the measure, which will
deny health, education and
social services to undocument
ed immigrants and require
reporting of "suspected" illegal
immigrants to the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
Brown and Feinstein both
opposed the measure.
Opponents of 187 — who
have challenged the constitu
tionality of the proposition's
provisions — said they will file
an injunction against the mea
sure today. The measure is
expected to go all the way to the
United States Supreme Court.
In other propositions, Propo
sition 184, which will reaffirm
the "three strikes you're out"
law recently passed by the state
government, was approved 72
percent to 28 percent.
Proposition 186 to institute
a state-run, "single-payer"
health-care system was defeat
ed 73 percent to 27 percent.
And proposition 188, the
tobacco industry-sponsored
measure to preempt all local
smoking ordinances, was
defeated 71 percent to 29 per
cent.
Californians also voted on
seven state offices, four of
which were filled by Republi
cans.

Democrats Gray Davis,
Delaine Eastin and Kathleen
Connell captured the offices of
lieutenant governor, state
superintendent of public
instruction and state controller
respectively.
Davis defeated Republican
Cathie Wright 53 percent to 40
percent, while Eastin beat
Republican-backed Maureen
DiMarco 56 percent to 44 per
cent.
Eastin will be the first
female superintendent in Cali
fornia's history.
Republican incumbent Dan
Lungren defeated Democrat
Tom Umberg for attorney gen
eral, and Republican Matt Eong
defeated Democrat Phil
Angelides for treasurer.
Republican Chuck Quacken
bush will be California's next
insurance commissioner. With
96 percent of the votes counted
early this morning, Republican
Bill Jones had a slight lead over
Democrat Tony Miller for sec
retary of state.
"This is a glorious day to be a
Republican," Lungren said.
"We have made a change in
America and California that's
going to last a long, long time."
In local elections, Democrat
ic incumbent U.S. Rep. Anna
Eshoo held on to her 14th con
gressional district seat, defeat

were not specifically endorsing the
Republican party, but were express
ing an anti-incumbent, anti-govern
ment feeling.
"Many were voting against
incumbents or against any individu
al who had the view that govern
ment could somehow help," he said.
Edwin Meese, Attorney General
under Ronald Reagan, said that the
American people were acting specifi
cally to repudiate Bill Clinton.
"Most of us recognize that the
public is not happy with what is
going on," he said. "Yet I did not
expect the magnitude of this change.
This is a major change in terms of
how many seats switched positions.
This race was not only a "No"
vote against Democratic policy or an
admonishment of Bill Clinton, but
according to Hoover Institution
Senior Fellow Martin Anderson, the
vote was also a clear endorsement of
Republican ideology.
"This race was an ideological ref
erendum," he said. "People are vot
ing against what they don't believe
and for what they do believe."

Meese agreed that voters were
effectively saying that the Republi
can party represented America's
best hope.
"You will see a less oppressive
government," Meese said. "You will
see a Congress that will not increase
the amount of government regula
tions that burden the people.
"This will be the first time in 40
years that the Republicans have con
trol of both houses," he said.
"Because of that you are going to get
away from the centralization of
power we have seen in the last two
years."
Many political experts agree on
the shape that Republican reform
will take. "They will be trying to pur
sue a balanced budget and decrease
the size of government," Moe said.
"Basically, they will try to construct
a Republican agenda that they can
win on in 1996."
Anderson said that the Republi
cans will most likely attempt to
quickly establish their popularity
with the American people. "They
will send out a law for term limits
and they will probably send a bal
anced budget amendment out to the
states for discussion and ratifica
tion," he said.
He predicted that the Republi

cans might immediately put forward
a politically attractive bill which stip
ulates that the Congress is not
exempt from the laws that apply to
the American people.
For Republicans to succeed, Moe
emphasized the need for them to
define an agenda and take construc
tive action on their own. "The word
is positive change," he said.
However, with a Democratic
president and a Republican majority
in Congress, such change will be dif
ficult to manufacture.
"Clinton and the Republicans
might be able to agree on welfare
reform but for the most part Clinton
is in for some big trouble," Moe said.
"Health care is an impossible dream
now. Basically, Clinton was pursu
ing a liberal agenda and he won't be
able to do that anymore. Politics will
have to come into the center."
Moe says he expects Clinton to
adapt to the new face of Congress in
order to do what is necessary to
make changes occur.
Fraga agreed, saying that "Clin
ton will continue to try to make
things work. But he is in an even
more difficult position in dealing
with the Congress. The key is how
willing the Congress will be with
dealing with him."
Two years ago today, the De
mocrats were euphoric, havingjust
gained the White House and re
tained both houses of Congress.
Two years later, a gain of eight
senators and 51 representatives in
yesterday's elections has given Re
publicans control of both houses of
Congress for the first time in 40
years.
In analyzing the results, some
point at anti-incumbent feelings,
others at Democratic failures, but
one thing is certain: explaining why
and how this happened will be fod
der for political commentators and
professors to feed on for at least 40
years to come.
According to Political Science
Prof. Terry Moe, voters' desire for a
Republican majority in the Senate
and the House is a strong indication
of dissatisfaction.
"People are fed up with politi
cians and with big government and
are registering a protest vote," he
said. "It doesn't mean that people
have suddenly turned Republican."
His colleague, Political Science
Prof. Luis Fraga, agreed that voters

Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and Democ
rat Sen. Dianne Feinstein were both re-elect
ed to second terms yesterday, and a contro
versial measure to deny health care and
other benefits to illegal immigrants was ap
proved by a three-to-two vote.
But the main news of the day was the na
tionwide tide of GOP victories, which gave
Republicans control of both houses of Con
gress for the first time since 1954.
Overall, Republicans gained eight seats in
the Senate, 51 in the house and 11 governor
ships.
As a result, Sen. Bob Dole will likely take
over as Senate Majority Leader, and Rep.
Newt Gingrich will become Speaker of the
House of Representatives.
In addition, as the majority party, Repub
licans will now chair all Congressional com
mittees and subcommittees.
Election Day was not only a bleak day for

Democrats but also for women and minori
ties who suffered losses nationwide. The
number of female governors decreased from
four to one.
The estimated 8.8 million Californians
who cast their ballots yesterday were asked
to chose a governor, U.S. senator and decide
on a number of propositions on issues rang
ing from health care to smoking.
After one of the most costly gubernatorial
races in California's history, Wilson bounced
back from approval ratings that had sunk as
low as 15 percent to easily beat Brown by 55
percent to 41 percent.
In his acceptance speech in Los Angeles,
Wilson told a cheering crowd of supporters
that observers had underestimated him, as
well as the state of California.
"As I said after the Northridge quake,
they can shake us, but they can't break us,"
he said.
Wilson admitted last night that the odds
of re-election were stacked against him.


Meghna Chakrabarti — Daily
Sen. Dianne Feinstein thanks her supporters while the fate of her race against Michael
Huffington remained uncertain. The Associated Press later declared her the winner.
"It wasn't too long ago that
the smart-money pundits were
not only writing me off, they
were writing off California," he
said. "About a year ago, I think
I faced longer odds than George
Foreman."

Conceding defeat, Brown
said she will help Wilson "chart
California through this diffi
cult passage in our history. To
take these crises we face and
turn them into opportunities,
for our Californians deserve no
less."
As for the Senate race, Fein

stein barely edged out Huffing
ton 47 percent to 45 percent.
The race was so close that it
wasn't called until early this
morning. Huffington led in the
early returns, but Feinstein
eventually caught up and took
the lead.
"What a cliffhanger," Fein

stein told supporters at San
Francisco's Fairmont Hotel last
night. "It seems to me we don't
know what the final result is
going to be. We are going to
wait and see what those results
are."
"It is clear watching what's
happening across the country
that the Republicans are having
an unbelievable victory," Huff
ington told supporters at his
Costa Mesa campaign head
quarters. "And what we want to
do in California tonight is add
to that victory."
The Huffington-Feinstein
race — which in its final days
was dominated by personal
issues like the candidate's hir
ing of illegal aliens — set a new
record for spending in Senate
races at $41 million. Huffing
ton chipped in $27 million of
his personal fortune to the
campaign.
According to an exit poll by
Voter News Service, Feinstein
was supported by voters who
felt she had more experience,
was better able to deal with the
state's economy, and knew Cal
ifornia better than Huffington,
who moved from his native
Texas to California in 1991.
Huffington served just two
years in Congress while Fein
stein has more than 20 years in
public office, including a stint
as the mayor of San Francisco.
The poll also found that Wil
son drew support from voters
with family incomes over
$100,000 while the lowest
