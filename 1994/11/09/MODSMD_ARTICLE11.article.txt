## Key Dems, including Cuomo and Rostenkowski, lose seats 
### 
Throughout the country yesterday,
several staples of American politics were
swept from office as the Republican party
won majorities in both houses of
Congress. The following are briefs on
some important races:
Foley hanging on
SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) - Worlds
away from the easy victories he once
enjoyed, House Speaker Tom Foley still
clutched today at a slim hope that he
could dodge the dour fate of Democratic
incumbents across the country.
With 99 percent of precincts reporting,
Foley trailed Republican challenger
George Nethercutt by just 2,174 votes, or
50.6 percent to 49.4 percent. About
14,000 absentee ballots remained

uncounted, making the race too close to
call.
Not since the Civil War has a House
speaker been turned out of office.
Sweating out his own race last night,
a solemn Foley acknowledged the dam
age inflicted on his party. Even if Foley
remains in office, Republicans will con
trol the House and the speaker's job will
probably go to Newt Gingrich of Geor
gia.
"It is clear there is a sense on the
part of Americans across the country
that they are dissatisfied with the pace
of change," Foley grimly told support
ers.
Nethercutt, meanwhile, was jubilant.
"What we're seeing across the country is
grass-roots politics at its best," he said.
"It's a voice of the people to change the

system that exists in Washington."
Rosty loses in Chicago
CHICAGO (AP) â€” Dan Rostenkowski
had a saying that used to amuse his
friends in Washington."In Chicago," this
city's premier congressman for decades
would tell them, "we sometimes say that
politics is a blood sport."
That old adage came home to Ros
tenkowski with a vengeance on a night
that was like a bad dream for Democrats
everywhere.
"I'm going to go back to Washington
and clean out my desk," the former
chairman of the powerful House Ways
and Means Committee told reporters yes
terday after being defeated by Republican
Michael Patrick Flanagan.
Flanagan, 32, who had been the
answer to a trivia question on a radio

show only weeks earlier, was less a win
ner than a beneficiary as voters punished
the 18-term lawmaker for his indictment
on federal corruption charges.
Rostenkowski had hoped to coast qui
etly to victory with help from Democratic
ward leaders. He didn't figure on the
depth of voter concern over his 17-count
fraud indictment on charges ranging
from ghost payrolling to theft of postage
stamps.
Rostenkowski's defeat set the stage
for a fresh battle two years from now in
the sth Congressional District, which
runs from luxury high-rises along Lake
Shore Drive to bungalows on the
Northwest Side and neighboring sub
urbs.
While Republicans celebrated, Flana
gan pledged no change in the conserva

tive views that may have been unknown
to some of those who voted for him.
"I'm pro-life and anti-gun control,"
Flanagan said. "There's no backing away
from that."
Cuomo out in N.Y.
NEW YORK (AP) - He might have
been president, or Supreme Court jus
tice, or at least the governor who made
them forget Roosevelt and Rockefeller.
Instead, Mario Cuomo left politics as a
loser last night, a seemingly great man
with no great deeds.
None, at least, that impressed New
York State voters enough to give him a
fourth term in office.
When it all was over, state Sen. George
Pataki had 49 percent of the vote to
Cuomo's 45 percent.
