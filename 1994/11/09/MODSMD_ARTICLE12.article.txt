Aristide appeals for cooperation

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti
(AP) â€” President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide extended an
olive branch to Haiti's military
yesterday in his most direct
appeal for cooperation since he
returned from exile last month.
"I want to say again to all
Haitian military officers, sol
diers and interim police officers
that I have come to bring you
peace," Aristide said.
The military is blamed for
condoning 3,000 political mur
ders after Aristide was ousted in
a September 1991 coup. Many
soldiers had threatened to kill
Aristide if he returned.
But Aristide, speaking at the
inaugural of his new Cabinet,
said it was time to "walk hand in

hand with the military authori
ties, Haitian and foreign."
The inaugural took place at
the gleaming white national
palace, with hundreds of
Haitians gawking from outside
the green iron gates. American
soldiers and private security
guards in civilian dress stood
guard.
Aristide hugged and shook
hands with Prime Minister
Smarck Michel and his 17 Cabi
net ministers in a white
columned hall lined with the
busts of national heroes.
Michel's economic recovery
program, outlined over the
weekend, would reduce tariffs,
increase exports and privatize
unprofitable state enterprises.

Charges dropped against Cowlings

LOS ANGELES (AP) - A 1
"A.C." Cowlings won't be
charged with a crime for driving
the white Bronco in which O.J.
Simpson fled the day he was
supposed to turn himself in.
"We can't prove the case,"
District Attorney Gil Garcetti
"announced yesterday. He said
"the investigation is closed.
Deputy District Attorney
Christopher Darden was reas
signed from the Cowlings case
to the Simpson murder case,
drawing immediate criticism
from the Simpson defense, in
part because Darden is black.
"We have said that the
(Cowlings) investigation was a

charade," said defense attorney
Johnnie Cochran Jr., who also
is black. "Now, all of a sudden,
he shows up over here, now that
we have eight African-Ameri
cans (on the jury)... .We are
concerned about it."
In court yesterday, Superior
Court Judge Lance Ito relaxed
the rules for the 12 sworn-in
jurors, who have been living
under a media blackout since
mid-September. The search
also began for 15 alternate
jurors.
Opening statements are
expected in January, after a
hearing on the admissibility of
DNA test results.

Apologies made to black community

UNION, S.C. (AP) - Susan
Smith's family offered apologies
to the black community yester
day for her false claim that a
black man had abducted her two
sons.
"We apologize to all of the
black citizens in Union and
everywhere," said Scotty
Vaughan, Mrs. Smith's brother.
He added: "I'm thankful espe
cially to many of my black
friends, who called me to com
fort me and tell me they still
loved me. It was just a terrible
misfortune that all this hap
pened."
For nine days after her chil
dren vanished Oct. 25, Mrs.

Smith had claimed a black car
jacker had driven off with them.
When the car was found in a
lake and she was charged with
murder, many blacks were
angry and hurt as well as sad.
"The apology was needed for
the healing process. I think the
gesture was well-needed and
well-taken," said funeral home
owner William E. Free 111, who
is black.
Sheriff Howard Wells said of
the apology, "I believe it'll go a
long way into easing the tension
and helping us to get back to a
state of normal function in the
county. I hope that it satisfies
everyone."
