EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) -
Yitzhak Rabin, attempting to bolster Yasser
Arafat against a widening circle of Palestinian
critics, pledged yesterday to ease the closure of
the Gaza Strip and to work faster to expand
Palestinian autonomy.
The promises came at a time when Arafat is
losing ground to Islamic militants opposed to
reconciliation with Israel.
Arafat passed two groups of protesters — dis
gruntled truckers hurt by the sealing of Gaza
and mothers of prisoners held by Israel — as the
PLO leader drove from his Gaza City headquar
ters to meet Rabin at the Erez Crossing between
Israel and Gaza
Hundreds of policemen armed with Kalash
nikov assault rifles lined the eight-mile route to
protect him.
Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, tried to
assure Arafat that he hadn't lost interest in
making peace with the Palestinians, promising
the Israelis would negotiate "in the most forth
coming spirit."
The Palestinians have felt shunted aside
since Jordan and Israel signed their Oct. 26
peace accord. The Palestine Liberation Organi
zation has also accused Rabin of stalling on
implementing stage two of autonomy — an
Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank and
Palestinian elections.
Hinting at Palestinian dissatisfaction, Arafat
said: "We hope that in this atmosphere and atti
tude, we will follow up to implement accurately
and honestly what was agreed upon."
Despite the upbeat words, there appeared to
be little warmth between the two leaders after
the 90-minute meeting, their seventh since
Israel and the PLO pledged to make peace 14
months ago. They rarely looked at one another
as they addressed reporters, and stood behind

separate lecterns.
Rabin's key concession in the meeting with
Arafat appeared to be his agreement to simulta
neously negotiate the elections and troop rede
ployment in the West Bank, where 120,000
Jewish settlers live among 1 million Palestini
ans.
"The discussions will be comprehensive, all
the issues that need to be solved to move to the
next stage," Rabin said.

Under the autonomy accord, Israeli troops
are to leave Palestinian population centers on
the eve of elections for a self-rule council, and
Palestinian police will take over.
Israeli army commanders have said Pales
tinian security forces are not ready to take con
trol of additional territory because they haven't
restrained Islamic militants in the Gaza Strip
and the West Bank town of Jericho since those
areas became autonomous six months ago.
