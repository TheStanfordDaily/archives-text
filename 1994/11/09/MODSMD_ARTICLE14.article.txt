# U.S. refuses to ease sanctions against Iraq

WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States
is ruling out easing U.N. sanctions against
Iraq even if the Iraqis recognize Kuwait's bor
der.
And with its veto, the United States has the
power to enforce its view.
The State Department took the tough stand
yesterday even before getting a readout on
talks in Moscow between Russian Foreign
Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev and Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz.
The Russian Foreign Ministry announced
following those talks that Iraq was ready to
bow to a key U.N. demand and recognize
Kuwait's border, formalizing an earlier pledge
to Kozyrev.
The ITAR-Tass news agency said Aziz had

delivered a letter from Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to Russian President Boris Yeltsin
concerning recognition of Kuwait's borders
and sovereignty.
Iraq has considered Kuwait its 19th
province and seized the Persian Gulf country
Aug. 2, 1990. The United States massed a
coalition with Saudi Arabia and other coun
tries to reverse the annexation early in 1991.
This year, President Clinton sent troops to
the gulf to force Iraq to withdraw its forces
from the border area.
"Border recognition would meet only one of
a number of requirements with which Iraq has
not complied," said David Johnson, a State
Department spokesman. "It would not itself
establish Iraq's peaceful intentions."

Johnson said the United States would
oppose any Security Council action to ease
sanctions, which include a ban on purchases of
Iraqi oil. Sanctions also require Iraq to keep its
troops away from its border with Kuwait.
Since 1990, the United States and Russia
sometimes have taken different approaches
toward Saddam. Basically, Washington has
pursued a tough line while Moscow has sought
ways to ease tensions and in the meantime col
lect a $7 billion debt from Iraq.
Saddam told Kozyrev last month that he
would recognize Kuwait's borders. But the
U.N. Security Council was not content with
his informal pledge and has insisted that Iraq's
Revolutionary Council and its parliament
make the recognition official.
