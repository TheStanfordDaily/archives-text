ASSU must stay out of
off-campus issues if it is
to serve as student voice

ONE OF THE most con
tentious issues California
voters faced in yesterday's
election was Proposition 187, a mea
sure aimed at curbing the alleged
negative effects of illegal immigra
tion by denying social services to
undocumented immigrants and
requiring that suspected undocu
mented immigrants be reported to
the Immigration and Naturaliza
tion Service.
A wide variety of individuals and
organizations at Stanford came out
against Prop. 187 — an encouraging
response to an unwise proposal.
What's not so encouraging, though,
is that one of the groups that made
a statement on Prop. 187 had no
business doing so: the ASSU Sen
ate.
At its Nov. 1 meeting, in blatant
violation of the ASSU Constitution,
the senate considered SA-1, a reso
lution opposing Prop. 187 and urg
ing students to vote against it. The
resolution, under the sponsorship of
five ASSU senators and a member
of the Council of Presidents, passed
the senate by a majority vote.
The ASSU Constitution grants
the ASSU and its senate power to
represent the student body in non-
University affairs. But to keep the
ASSU'B focus on student advocacy
and away from partisan politics, the
constitution forbids the senate from
representing the student body in
"matters not directly affecting Stan
ford students."
That definition requires that at
least one Stanford student be
"affected by the matter in a substan
tially different manner" than if he or
she were not a Stanford student.
SA-1 employed the following
rationale in contending that Prop.
187 would affect Stanford students:
Students are required to purchase
insurance, and if they do not have

their own health insurance, they
must purchase a University-provid
ed plan that reduces coverage for
those who do not use the Stanford
Hospital and other affiliated facili
ties. As Prop. 187 would affect Stan
ford Hospital, SA-1 contended, stu
dents could be refused medical care
if they were not immediately able to
prove that they were legal residents.
The senate's justification here
relies on a dubious slippery-slope
argument. Were this reasoning
acceptable, the senate could con
ceivably take positions on any num
ber of issues. For instance, students
at Stanford are required to have
textbooks. If they steal those text
books, they could face life in prison
under the state "three strikes,
you're out law." Therefore, using an
argument similar to SA-l's, the
ASSU could constitutionally oppose
the three-strikes law.
Clearly, the senate's reasoning is
not valid. Prop. 187 affected the
senate's hypothetical students
because they needed medical care,
could not prove legal residency and
chose the University health plan
over other insurance alternatives —
not specifically because they were
students.
An appeal to legislative history
also casts doubt on SA-l's constitu
tionality. Douglas Bone, a former
ASSU senator and co-author of the
applicable section of the ASSU Con
stitution, has stated publicly that he
believes SA-1 is unconstitutional.
To remain an effective and credi
ble vehicle for student advocacy at
Stanford, the ASSU must remain
impartial on controversial off-cam
pus issues, as the ASSU Constitu
tion wisely provides. Otherwise,
student government will degenerate
into an arena for meaningless polit
ical bickering.
It is heartening that Stanford
student leaders were sound enough
in their judgment that they person
ally opposed Prop. 187. But if stu
dent leaders want to make personal
political statements, they should do
so under their own names — not
under the authority of the ASSU.
