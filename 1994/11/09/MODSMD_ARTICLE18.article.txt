Changes to policy on retaking courses were reasonable

ON OCT. 31, The Daily ran a
front-page article ominously
entitled "Grade policy looms
over some." It dealt with the new
rules for retakes and printed a set of
peoples' reactions to the policy
change. The article, without actually
describing the new policy, implied that
the changes will be low-impact and
positive, that last year's loud cries of
protest have magically turned to gen
eral assent and that I, as the individu
al most responsible for organized
opposition to the grading policy
changes last spring, remain in unfath
omable opposition to the new retake
policy. These oversights and misper
ceptions need to be corrected.
My first problem with the article
was that it completely misrepresented
my attitude toward the new retake
policy. I'm sure that if I were in fact
an unbudging opponent of the new
rules, my views could have made a
nice foil to an otherwise innocuous
story. But I am not, and I did not
appreciate being cast as such through
the use of mangled and impertinent
quotes. I had come to the Daily office
and spoken in person with the writer
of the story the night before, and I
was truly surprised and unhappy with

the result in the morning. Never did I
say that the retake policy change was
a bad thing. In fact, I remember
specifically outlining why it could be
positive.
For instance, imagine a freshman
or sophomore who decides to take an
academically challenging quarter but
eventually finds that the load is too
much and ends up with less-than-stel
lar grades across the board. Under the
old system, if that student decided to
retake one course, the first grade
would disappear and the transcript
would end up showing a quarter in
which the student didn't take on too
much but didn't do very well anyway.
Having classes disappear isn't neces
sarily a good thing.
There are plenty of arguments for a
change from the old (not very old,
actually) system: to reveal when some
one has spent more time mastering
the material; to prevent people from
casually abusing the opportunity to
retake classes; to encourage students
to use their time here more produc
tively.
But students should not get the
impression that there's nothing to
worry about. Fred Che, the head
advising associate in Otero, went too

far when he "agreed that the new poli
cy will help freshmen who are taking
courses with upperclassmen." Only
next year will freshmen be on a level
playing field. This year, freshmen, use
caution! Upperclassmen are now in a
transition year in which they can
freely retake classes first taken last
year or earlier. But no one gets to
retake any of this year's classes under
the old system. Got that? If you take
Chemistry 31 this fall, fail and want
to retake it in the spring, the fall
course will show up with an "RP"
mark. Just to make sure everyone
knows.
The problem with this is that it
puts freshmen at a disadvantage this
year as they compete in courses with
upperclassmen who may have already
had a "free shot" at the material. My
advice for anyone taking a "gatekeep
er" course for the first time this year
is be very careful that you don't over
commit yourself. Also, remember that
the drop deadline is still extremely
generous this year.
I pity anyone who gets caught in
the last turns of the "vicious circle" of
retakes, but one shouldn't get the
idea, either, that people have been
massively abusing the system. Accord

ing to the Registrar's Office, there
were about 700 retake petitions sub
mitted in the 1992-93 academic year
versus around 65,000 course registra
tions. So retakes account for about 1
percent of courses taken at Stanford;
maybe they're concentrated in those
"gatekeeper" or "weed-out" courses,
but that's a completely different
issue.
Anyway, there never was any sig
nificant controversy over the retake
policy changes. They seemed reason
able and still do. I'm not, and as far
as I know I never was an opponent of
the new retake policy, and I'm sorry
that The Daily apparently didn't real
ize that. This attitude is no "radical
shift from the uproar" of last spring,
as the article puts it; the ruckus back
then was about the imposition of the
"F" (excuse me — "NP") mark and
the shortened drop deadline. That's
what is going to make a real impact
next year. But it's much too late to
feel bitter about it; now we have to
learn to work within the system
we're getting. The safety net is being
removed, folks — be careful that you
don't fall off the academic tightrope.

freely retake classes first taken last
year or earlier. But no one gets to
retake any of this year's classes under
the old system. Got that? If you take
Chemistry 31 this fall, fail and want
to retake it in the spring, the fall
course will show up with an "RP"
mark. Just to make sure everyone
knows.
The problem with this is that it
puts freshmen at a disadvantage this
year as they compete in courses with
upperclassmen who may have already
had a "free shot" at the material. My
advice for anyone taking a "gatekeep
er" course for the first time this year
is be very careful that you don't over
commit yourself. Also, remember that
the drop deadline is still extremely
generous this year.
I pity anyone who gets caught in
the last turns of the "vicious circle" of
retakes, but one shouldn't get the
idea, either, that people have been
massively abusing the system. Accord

ing to the Registrar's Office, there
were about 700 retake petitions sub
mitted in the 1992-93 academic year
versus around 65,000 course registra
tions. So retakes account for about 1
percent of courses taken at Stanford;
maybe they're concentrated in those
"gatekeeper" or "weed-out" courses,
but that's a completely different
issue.
Anyway, there never was any sig
nificant controversy over the retake
policy changes. They seemed reason
able and still do. I'm not, and as far
as I know I never was an opponent of
the new retake policy, and I'm sorry
that The Daily apparently didn't real
ize that. This attitude is no "radical
shift from the uproar" of last spring,
as the article puts it; the ruckus back
then was about the imposition of the
"F" (excuse me — "NP") mark and
the shortened drop deadline. That's
what is going to make a real impact
next year. But it's much too late to
feel bitter about it; now we have to
learn to work within the system
we're getting. The safety net is being
removed, folks — be careful that you
don't fall off the academic tightrope.
