## The 						culture that never was 
### 
I DON'T KNOW what Generation X
is. It seems to be a term that has
no precise meaning, a mark of
identification with which no one iden
tifies, a culture that is fixed and disso
ciated.
The only example I can think of
that fulfills the peculiar qualifications
for this acquired culture is MTV's
comically titled "The Real World."
Static, ever-present, this world's cul
ture exists above revision or develop
ment, quite literally a program
defined by its correspondence to defi
nition. We watch "The Real World"
and see a retrospective of a culture
that never was.
Which is why for many of us the
generational affiliation is so disturb
ing. We expect our culture to evolve
through our beliefs, our arts and our
social forms. We hope that our culture
will look forward, toward things bet
ter, that it will find connections more
often than classifications. Instead, the
culture we've been asked to consume
appears more in danger of being swal
lowed by its own explanation.
It may also suffocate on personali
ty. Take Puck, for example, the tow
head bike messenger in"The Real
World" San Francisco who seemed for
a moment original. A radical perhaps,
a man who avoided labels by thinking
for himself.
But like the larger Generation-X
culture, Puck became a sad and simple

projection of anarchy defined. A pre
formance. Quirks calculated to convey
his disdain for convention run wild:
no eating utensils, no baths, no
Kleenex or courtesy.
Yet this is hardly radical. Puck's
determined self-invention is more
accurately reactive, seemingly guided
by principles as sophisticated as the
Opposite Game. Granted, he is a char
acter, a type, but a paradox remains
between such self-consciousness and
the need for conscience. He tries so
hard to distinguish himself, yet he
reacts indiscriminately. And we are
still left with a question: What, then,
can he be?
In the Oct. 30 issue of the Los
Angeles Times Magazine, the article
"How Stewart Brand Learns" reveals
an alternative version of a self contin
uously reinvented through a process
of becoming rather than projecting.
Brand, former Stanford student and
Merry Prankster, creator of the
"Whole Earth Catalog" and the WELL
(the Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link),
refuses to consider the self as an
object definable. Instead, he suggests
an evolutionary, educated identity, a
self that does not appropriate but
learns.
"There is a difference between
intention driving us on and mystery
pulling us on," he says. "Mystery will
always educate and correct. Intention
can go off the end of its own limb." If

we take his word we arrive at a cul
ture that is no longer halting or self
ish or predictable, a culture that
adapts, as Matthew Arnold put it, in
the interests of a "general humane
spirit" moving forward with faith.
Brand sees, as others do not, that
cultural relationships are every bit as
important as the currently popular
autonomy. We should take note of his
claim that every individual — no mat
ter how radical or independent or
Puckish — is part of a complex system
of individuals that constantly shape
each other's lives.
As part of that system, we must
thoughtfully respond and adapt to
each other continually in a way that
extends far beyond the politics and
personality of a lifestyle. A lifestyle is
a culture of limitations: a label in a
shirt collar, a self-proclamation, an
advertisement for a whole new gener
ation. The lifelong acts of a culture
are much more mysterious. So per
haps we should take Brand's advice,
and improvise.

Elizabeth Kelly decided not to apply to
be in this year's incarnation of MTV's
"The Real World," though she still
sometimes wonders what happens
when people stop being polite and
start getting real.
