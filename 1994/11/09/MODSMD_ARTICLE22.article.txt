Every religion has its
own beliefs and way of
interpreting God's will
The bottom line is this: I don't even
know what Marco L. DeCapite's Friday
Forum article (Nov. 4) on God and cable
TV is about, and the questions raised by
his article ridiculously outnumber those
addressed sufficiently. The article is
tedious in its lack of focus and annoying
in its presumptive nature. He ineffec
tively attempts to address (I think) two
massive issues: the detriments of orga
nized religion and the conflict between
scientific and religious thought (does it
exist?).
DeCapite speaks of nonsecular, Uni
tarian spirituality as the only solution to
the problems that plague the world
today. Finding God now "when we need
[him] most" (because of AIDS, broken
families, abandoned and abused children
etc.) may be popular religious rhetoric,
but is distinctly lacking in practical sub
stance. "We need to be in touch with our
own spirituality and transcend the petty

bickering", he proclaims idealistically.
Only then may the "real healing process
in our society" begin.
What healing process is he referring
to here? Medieval magic to cure lethal
diseases? Faith to stop child abuse? How
can you assume that God is what we
need most right now? Maybe we should
place our faith in the rational ability of
the human mind rather than supreme
obscurities to solve such problems such
as these. Isn't this sort of faith a little
more productive within society?
Maybe he just wants everyone to love
each other more. Sure, maybe if all orga
nized religions could just stop driving
"spikes between each other," society
would be a better place. Indeed, how
could anyone disagree with this state
ment?
But DeCapite gets it wrong when he
assumes the people of the world are
"brothers and sisters of the same faith."
Religions "drive spikes between each
other" because they are by nature very
particular organizations with specific
beliefs. In religious tradition, these
beliefs are often irreconcilable; each reli
gious sect is following its own interpre
tation of God's word. Religious beliefs
are extremely hard to reconcile between

sects, and DeCapite's assumption that
everyone can put their differences aside
to "heal" society shows a disregard for
religion's historical disposition. "It's
such trivial issues that lead to holy
wars."
Trivial to whom, Marco? The jihad
are not committing ultimate acts
"against God's will" when they kill their
enemies, they are committing them
selves to eternal heroism. "I don't recall
God endorsing any such acts in any of
the holy books." And which has
DeCapite read? Isn't interpretation a
subjective process? It has nothing to do
with DeCapite's misreading and every
thing to do with his specific interpreta
tion. This is the way religion works, and
unless all people are identical, religious
conflict will exist. Like DeCapite, I have
seen enough strife born of conflict
between organized religions. And this is
not to say that religion does not do good
for many people in the world. However,
when it comes to finding real healing
processes, looking to unite diverse reli
gious beliefs into a single "spirituality"
is an impossible notion.
And one more thing: faith and truth
are two completely different entities.
"Most intelligent people don't believe in

God", says DeCapite's friend. First, real
ize that most intelligent people don't
make claims they could never substanti
ate ("most intelligent people I know"
would be less objectionable). And also
recognize the silliness of DeCapite's
assumption that everyone that attends
Stanford is intelligent. Finally, let's
agree that being devoid of trust and
faith does not mean one is intelligent,
lacking intelligence does not implicate
reliance upon faith and scientists can
have faith in God, too.

change, alumnus says
Why won't the Athletic Department
leave the band alone? Until the advent of
the Athletic Department censorship, the
marvelous music and irrepressible antics
of the merrymakers of musical madness,
the one, the only, the truly incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior University

Marching Band were vastly more enter
taining than the Cardinal football team.
So what if the Simpson serenade was
gross? Hasn't this been true of the whole
sordid saga? Free the Band. Or change
the name to Stuffy University.
