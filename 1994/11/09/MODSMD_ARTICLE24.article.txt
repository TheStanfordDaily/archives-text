## Project maps human DNA Diabetes, blood disease linked to specific genes 
### Rajen Sheth 
Imagine going to the doctor in the future and finding
out with just a few tests whether you will have a heart
attack by the age of sixty, or finding out through a home
test if you have a high risk for certain types of cancer.
These are just some of the advances that may be
made possible as a result of the Human Genome Pro
ject, which seeks to map out the entire structure of
human DNA. Stanford has one of the largest human
genome research programs in the United States.
Of the sixteen U.S. centers, two are located on cam
pus: the Stanford Genome Center (directed by Dr.
David Cox, Dr. Richard Myers, and Dr. Doug Vollrath,
professors of Genetics) mid the Stanford DNA Sequence
and Technology Center (directed by Dr. lion Davis, pro
fessor of Biochemistry and Genetics, mid Dr. David Bot
stein, chairman of the genetics department).
The Human Genome Project is a worldwide endeav
or which started in October 1990 and is projected to be
completed in about 15 years. The main purpose of the
project is to find the genes responsible for causing vari
ous human diseases and disorders.
Many diseases such as cancer or diabetes are caused
by mutations in a certain human genes. If scientists
knew exactly which gene mutation caused a specific dis
ease, they could tell whether a patient has the potential
for that disease by testing for the presence of the gene
mutation.
In addition, researchers could explore why the muta
tion causes the disease, and they could use the informa
tion to develop drugs for treatment or cure.
"The human genome project would provide a new
way to treat human disease and provide new knowledge
to find better therapeutics for people with medical prob
lems," Cox said. He added that drugs are currently
developed in a very haphazard way, randomly through
trial mid error. Scientists simply test different drugs on
a disease until they find one that works.
Cox said that the Human Genome Project would be
a big improvement 011 today's methods. He gives the
example of a gene recently linked to diabetes. While
exploring that particular gene, researchers realized that
when the gene mutates, it fails to produce an enzyme
which takes glucose into cells.
Restoring this particular enzyme in diabetes victims
could treat and prevent diabetes. "People didn't have

any clue when they first started looking as to what the
gene was or where it was," Cox said. "By the fact that
you had this whole human genome, you could start
looking through it to say which piece of the DNA is
hooked up with the disease," he added.
The Stanford Human Genome Center has concen
trated on finding landmarks on the strands of DNA and
discovering which genes are located between those land
marks.
To map the positions of the landmarks, Stanford
researchers use probes which bind to certain sequences
of DNA and help determine the location of a particular
sequence.
After locating the sequence, researchers use radia
tion hybrids to discover where the probe is located rela
tive to other probes. Scientists insert several probes into
the DNA in a human cell and then X-ray the cell to
break apart the DNA
To make sure that the DNA is not destroyed by the
X-ray, the human DNA is then bonded with hamster
DNA in a hamster cell. The bonding process insures
that the human DNA may be analyzed further.
The hamster cell is then X-rayed and the resulting
DNA fragments tire bonded to the DNA of a new cell.
After testing eighty-five of these radiation hybrid cells,
scientists can determine the distance between the two
probes.
If two probes in any particular hybrid end up on the
same DNA fragment, they are likely to be close togeth
er in the entire genome. The data of the probes' location
in the eighty-five hybrids is pooled together, and if two
probes are on the same DNA fragment frequently, it is
determined that those two probes are close together in
the genome. "It's sort of like doing a jigsaw puzzle back
wards," Cox explained.
These probes set up landmarks along the genome,
and when a gene is discovered, it can be placed in a "bin"
defined by the space between two landmarks. In a
human genome of three billion base pairs, the efforts of
researchers around the world have progressed so that,
at the moment, there is a landmark every 400,000 base
pairs. As progress continues, there will be a landmark
every 100,000 base pairs.
The Stanford (Jenome Center started by finding
landmarks on chromosome four in the human DNA.
Because that effort was very successful, Stanford
researchers then started setting up landmarks along

the entire genome and developing DNA sequencing
techniques that would fill in the spaces between land
marks.
The second genome center at Stanford, the Stanford
DNA Sequence and Technology Center, uses the yeast
genome to perfect DNA sequencing techniques.
The yeast genome is much smaller than the human
genome, so it is easier to study. But, since many of the
same genes present in humans also occur in yeast, tech
niques perfected on yeast DNA can be used on human
DNA. Cox estimates that the entire yeast genome will
be mapped out in couple of years.
Stanford geneticists have also discovered disease
genes that were part ially made possible by the maps of
the Human Genome Project. Uta Francke recently iso
lated a gene on the X chromosome responsible for a rare
disease causing abnormal blood platelets in patients.
The genome mapping made it easier to find and clone
the gene.
One intriguing possibility for this project is that,
once certain genes are isolated and scientists under
stand why those genes cause diseases and disorders,
doctors could predict whether a person will develop var
ious diseases.
However, the results of revealing such predictions

could be risky and uncertain. A person whose genes
carry the code for a disease that cannot be cured may
not want to know that information. Data from the
genome project could also be used for political purposes.
Five percent of the Human Genome Project budget
is being spent on the ethics of the project and deciding
how to handle the information that will result. "We
must see that this new information is not used in a
twisted way to further agendas that may not be scien
tifically based," Cox said.
One major problem with the Human Genome Pro
ject has been organizing the worldwide effort. The
National Center for Genome Research, a division of the
National Institutes of Health in Washington, D.C., has
become the central organizing group for the project.
Also, two computer databases have been set up to pool
all the information gathered.
With many different mapping techniques, more
organization is necessary to ensure that every region of
the genome is being mapped adequately and that
results from different centers can be confirmed.
However, once the entire genome is mapped, Cox
and other geneticists believe that it will greatly benefit
society. The new wealth of information may open doors
which scientists believed were permanently closed.
