# Inflationary theory defines origins of universe
## 
### Tamar Ezer 
The Big Bang theory of the origin of the uni
verse, long accepted by physicists, cannot pro
vide a complete description of our universe.
But Stanford physics professor Andrei Linde
has helped produce a new conception of the uni
verse that addrqpees of the inconsistencies
in the old version of the Big Bang theory.
The theory of a hot Big Bang visualizes the
universe as originating in a spherically symmet
rical ball of fire that cooled as it expanded.
According to the theory, the entire universe
began in a state of infinitely high temperature
and density.
This theory was veiy successful in explaining
many properties of our universe. By the late
19705, physicists realized that it predicts the
existence of very small, heavy primordial
monopoles, or particles having one magnetic
pole, with an abundance equal to that of pro
tons. However, this is impossible because the
density of matter would have to be 15 orders of
magnitude greater than it is now. The total life
time of such a universe would be extremely
small.
Rejecting the oversimplified Big Bang theo
ry, Linde's inflationary model envisions the
early universe as being filled by a scalar field,
which is similar to a cosmological "vacuum" in
that it does not contain any elementary parti
cles. However, the scalar field may have a very
large energy density.
The scalar field, homogeneously present
everywhere, cannot be noticed. However, the
particles surrounded by the scalar field change
their properties and gain mass from its exis
tence. Remarkably, the density of the hypothet
ical scalar field remains almost constant during
expansion of the universe.
According to Einstein's theory of gravity, the
denser the universe, the faster it will expand. If
the density of the scalar field remains almost
constant during expansion, then the universe
expands exponentially fast. This stage of expo
nentially rapid expansion in a state without any
elementary particles is called inflation.
The inflationary theory presents the uni
verse as very large due to its exponential expan
sion; the great distances between monopoles

would explain why we haven't encountered
them yet.
The old Big Bang theory also provides no
explanation for the homogeneity of the uni
verse. Matter in the universe spreads out with
incredible uniformity, but, at the same time, the
universe incorporates small-scale deviations
from homogeneity, such as stars and galaxies.
Adopting an inflationary universe resolves
this difficulty. Inhomogeneities would stretch
out in an exponentially expanding universe, giv
ing the appearance of both flatness and unifor
mity. At the same time, quantum fluctuations
produced and amplified during inflation would
result in the formation of inhomogeneities like
galaxies.
Linde explained that the existence of the

scalar field is the main part of the inflationary
theory that has not been proven yet. Discover
ing its existence would cement the theoty; how
ever, even if the fields cannot be found, it would
be possible to build an analogue of the scalar
field using other fields whose existence is
known.
The recent versions of inflationary theory
describe the universe as a growing fractal; every
part of the universe produced by inflation is a
complete picture of the overall universal pat
tern. On a sufficiently large length scale (which
is, however, much greater than the scale that
can be presently observed) the pattern should be
the same, independent of the scale and of the
time of the observation.
"A fractal is a mathematical notion," Linde
said. "It is eternally repeating structure, which
looks the same on all scales." He offered the
example of a snowflake: each small segment is a
complete rendition of the entire snowflake's
pattern.
The inflationary universe begins in an
extremely small domain filled by a scalar field
which drives its expansion. As the initial infla
tionary domain expands, it branches out into
different exponentially large worlds. If one tries
to show the distribution of density of matter in
the universe, it looks as a series of peaks and val
leys. We live in one of such valleys now.
The peaks, on the other hand, are regions of
expansion where new "worlds" may be forming
even at the present moment. These inflationary
regions arise from quantum fluctuations that
cause the scalar field to grow. Each of the
regions of inflationary universe eventually may
collapse, but at the same time new regions are
constantly forming, so the overall universe is
self-replicating.
New worlds, or domains, continuously form
in an inflationary universe, and each can have
unique laws of physics.
"We assume one fundamental physical theo
ry for the whole universe, but this theory may
have various realizations depending on the val
ues of the [difTeringl scalar fields," Linde said.

"In this imprecise sense one can
speak about division of the uni
verse into parts with different laws
of physics."
This implies that in some of
inflationary domains all interac
tions will be divided into weak,
strong and electromagnetic, as in
our part of the universe, whereas in
some other domains there will be
no difference between these inter
actions. Quantum fluctuations pro
duced during inflation may be
strong enough even to change the
number of dimensions of space.
"The state of the universe
which we see around us may be not
the only one that is possible. It may

happen that the universe is divided
into an exponentially large number
of domains," Linde said. "We live
in our part of the universe, not
because it is the only part that
exists, but because it is the part
that can incorporate life of our
type," he said.
The new cosmological theory
can even shed some light on an old
problem which troubled mathe
maticians: why mathematics is so
surprisingly efficient in describing
our world. "Our universe contains
many different parts with different
properties. Simple mathematics
works only in those parts where
stable structures can exist. Howev
er, we can live only in such places.
Thus we can live only in those
parts of the universe where mathe
matics works well," Linde
explained.

explanation for the homogeneity of the uni
verse. Matter in the universe spreads out with
incredible uniformity, but, at the same time, the
universe incorporates small-scale deviations
from homogeneity, such as stars and galaxies.
Adopting an inflationary universe resolves
this difficulty. Inhomogeneities would stretch
out in an exponentially expanding universe, giv
ing the appearance of both flatness and unifor
mity. At the same time, quantum fluctuations
produced and amplified during inflation would
result in the formation of inhomogeneities like
galaxies.
Linde explained that the existence of the

scalar field is the main part of the inflationary
theory that has not been proven yet. Discover
ing its existence would cement the theoty; how
ever, even if the fields cannot be found, it would
be possible to build an analogue of the scalar
field using other fields whose existence is
known.
The recent versions of inflationary theory
describe the universe as a growing fractal; every
part of the universe produced by inflation is a
complete picture of the overall universal pat
tern. On a sufficiently large length scale (which
is, however, much greater than the scale that
can be presently observed) the pattern should be
the same, independent of the scale and of the
time of the observation.
"A fractal is a mathematical notion," Linde
said. "It is eternally repeating structure, which
looks the same on all scales." He offered the
example of a snowflake: each small segment is a
complete rendition of the entire snowflake's
pattern.
The inflationary universe begins in an
extremely small domain filled by a scalar field
which drives its expansion. As the initial infla
tionary domain expands, it branches out into
different exponentially large worlds. If one tries
to show the distribution of density of matter in
the universe, it looks as a series of peaks and val
leys. We live in one of such valleys now.
The peaks, on the other hand, are regions of
expansion where new "worlds" may be forming
even at the present moment. These inflationary
regions arise from quantum fluctuations that
cause the scalar field to grow. Each of the
regions of inflationary universe eventually may
collapse, but at the same time new regions are
constantly forming, so the overall universe is
self-replicating.
New worlds, or domains, continuously form
in an inflationary universe, and each can have
unique laws of physics.
"We assume one fundamental physical theo
ry for the whole universe, but this theory may
have various realizations depending on the val
ues of the [difTeringl scalar fields," Linde said.

"In this imprecise sense one can
speak about division of the uni
verse into parts with different laws
of physics."
This implies that in some of
inflationary domains all interac
tions will be divided into weak,
strong and electromagnetic, as in
our part of the universe, whereas in
some other domains there will be
no difference between these inter
actions. Quantum fluctuations pro
duced during inflation may be
strong enough even to change the
number of dimensions of space.
"The state of the universe
which we see around us may be not
the only one that is possible. It may

happen that the universe is divided
into an exponentially large number
of domains," Linde said. "We live
in our part of the universe, not
because it is the only part that
exists, but because it is the part
that can incorporate life of our
type," he said.
The new cosmological theory
can even shed some light on an old
problem which troubled mathe
maticians: why mathematics is so
surprisingly efficient in describing
our world. "Our universe contains
many different parts with different
properties. Simple mathematics
works only in those parts where
stable structures can exist. Howev
er, we can live only in such places.
Thus we can live only in those
parts of the universe where mathe
matics works well," Linde
explained.
The Big Bang theory of the origin of the uni
verse, long accepted by physicists, cannot pro
vide a complete description of our universe.
But Stanford physics professor Andrei Linde
has helped produce a new conception of the uni
verse that addrqpees of the inconsistencies
in the old version of the Big Bang theory.
The theory of a hot Big Bang visualizes the
universe as originating in a spherically symmet
rical ball of fire that cooled as it expanded.
According to the theory, the entire universe
began in a state of infinitely high temperature
and density.
This theory was veiy successful in explaining
many properties of our universe. By the late
19705, physicists realized that it predicts the
existence of very small, heavy primordial
monopoles, or particles having one magnetic
pole, with an abundance equal to that of pro
tons. However, this is impossible because the
density of matter would have to be 15 orders of
magnitude greater than it is now. The total life
time of such a universe would be extremely
small.
Rejecting the oversimplified Big Bang theo
ry, Linde's inflationary model envisions the
early universe as being filled by a scalar field,
which is similar to a cosmological "vacuum" in
that it does not contain any elementary parti
cles. However, the scalar field may have a very
large energy density.
The scalar field, homogeneously present
everywhere, cannot be noticed. However, the
particles surrounded by the scalar field change
their properties and gain mass from its exis
tence. Remarkably, the density of the hypothet
ical scalar field remains almost constant during
expansion of the universe.
According to Einstein's theory of gravity, the
denser the universe, the faster it will expand. If
the density of the scalar field remains almost
constant during expansion, then the universe
expands exponentially fast. This stage of expo
nentially rapid expansion in a state without any
elementary particles is called inflation.
The inflationary theory presents the uni
verse as very large due to its exponential expan
sion; the great distances between monopoles

would explain why we haven't encountered
them yet.
The old Big Bang theory also provides no
explanation for the homogeneity of the uni
verse. Matter in the universe spreads out with
incredible uniformity, but, at the same time, the
universe incorporates small-scale deviations
from homogeneity, such as stars and galaxies.
