## Yawning disease spreads in lectures

Q, "Why are yawns conta
gions?"
—sleepy in CIV
A So you too have experienced
he painful tedium of a bor
ing lecture. As you know, yawn
ing is but one part of the audi
ence reaction, which also
includes head-nodding, huge
spasms when someone wakes
up from their nap, and drool all
over your notes. Hopefully,
reading this will give you a
completely new respect for the
ultimate display of disrespect.
Why do we yawn in the first
place, let alone when other peo
ple are yawning? Yawning is
basically your body's response
to a lack of sufficient oxygen.
There's a little region at the
bottom of the brain that mea
sures the carbon dioxide in
your blood. If there's too much
carbon dioxide, there's proba
bly too little oxygen. So your
brain triggers a yawn.
The fact that your brain moni
tors your breathing by measuring

carbon dioxide levels is
essential for divers who
stay down under water
without air. Hyperventi
lating forces out the
carbon dioxide. This
rapid breathing tricks
the brain into thinking
that the oxygen flow is
sufficient, and it pre
vents the necessity of
gasping for air.
What does a yawn
actually do for you,
besides show off your
tonsils to your admir-

ing professor? First of
all, the deep inhalation brings
a fresh batch of oxygen into
your lungs. In normal breath
ing, you only cycle about a liter
of air in and out of your lungs.
However, there are usually
about three more liters just sit
ting there. With a big inhala
tion and exhalation (i.e. a
yawn), you can move out a lot
of this, replacing the stale air
with fresh oxygenated air.
In addition to bringing nice
new air into your lungs, a yawn
actually helps open up parts of
the lungs that are closed. The
bronchial tubes of the lungs
branch off into millions of tiny
air sacs, known as alveoli, where
the transfer of oxygen into the
blood actually takes place. At
any point in time, some of these
sacs are closed or collapsed and
air cannot enter them.
A yawn opens up the alveoli
in two ways. It actually forces

air into these collapsed regions
and opens them back up. Yawn
ing also redistributes a sub
stance in the lungs called sur
factant. Surfactant is basically
like soapy water, and it helps
lower the surface tension of the
lining of your lungs.
Surface tension is much like
the force that provides resis
tance when blowing up a bal
loon. By reducing the surface
tension, the surfactant helps the
alveoli stay open. Yawning helps
makes sure that all areas of the
lungs have enough surfactant.
Next question. Why do we
yawn in boring classes? Boring
classes embody the two most
important causes of yawning.
The first is poor ventilation in a
crowded room. The oxygen in
the air starts to decrease, so
everyone starts to yawn.
In addition, when you get
tired, your breathing becomes
more shallow. You start taking
in less oxygen, and your lungs
fill up with carbon dioxide. A
good yawn is needed to get the
oxygen back in there.
Now, we get to what you
really wanted to know. Why are

they contagious? The
best explanation is
that conditions that
make one person want
to yawn, will probably
make other people
want to yawn as well.
If you are sleepy, peo
ple around you will
probably be sleepy too.
If the room is stuffy,
everyone will find it
stuffy as well, and will
„ end up yawning.
Why do you look at
someone yawning and
want to yawn yourself?

Well, according to the above
hypothesis, you're both probably
in a situation that makes you
susceptible to yawning. Seeing
the other person simply triggers
you to yield to this urge.
Some people have suggested
that yawning used to be a form
of communication among our
ancestors. They point to the fact
that many animals use yawns to
display hostility, or even to
show affection. For example,
Adelie penguins use yawning as
part of their mating ritual.
However, there is nothing
more than circumstantial evi
dence supporting these ideas.
So for the lovelorn among you,
I would not suggest adopting
yawning as a part of your mat
ing ritual.
