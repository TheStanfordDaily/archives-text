# 'Verdict of the people'
## Brown gives early concession speech 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
Despite last-minute efforts
to garner votes from the Bay
Area, Kathleen Brown was
soundly defeated last night by
incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson.
Wilson easily won the elec
tion by a three-to-two margin.
"Tonight we must accept the
verdict of the people of Califor
nia," Brown said in her conces
sion speech, delivered less than
three hours after polls closed.
Though Brown's speech
emphasized Wilson's role as the
instrument of the people's will,
she also pointed to her specific
plans for education and the
economy as challenges he will
have to meet.
Only 45 minutes before the
polls closed, over 20 people
remained in Brown's San Fran
cisco office calling constituents
and encouraging them to use
the remaining minutes of the
election day to vote for the cur
rent California treasurer.
Supporters manned the
phones all the way through 8
p.m., when polls closed.
Among them was former

California Sen. Alan Cranston.
"We've got to keep at it,"
Cranston said. "Some people
were very surprised when I
identified myself. Some didn't
say anything. Most people have
already voted."
A more somber Cranston
appeared later at the reception
for Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
"These are terrible results," he
said. "People are not happy
with the way government is
performing. They took it out on
Democrats."
Arthur Lipscomb, 17, has
been a volunteer at the Brown
camp since September. "I like
[volunteering] a lot," he said,
when not taking incoming
phone calls.
"It's not what I expected."
Lipscomb, a San Francisco high
school student, said he spent
most of his two months regis
tering people for yesterday's
election.
At Stanford, Brown's alma
mater, a strong push to register
Democrats also fell short.
Freshman Bill Shen said he
recruited over 200 people
attempting to garner support of
"inconsistent voters."
"The goal was to get them to
get out and go to the polls,"
Shen said. "They're the people
the newspapers don't poll, and
we're banking on this to mak
ing the difference."
At Feinstein's rally last
night, Shen expressed his opti
mism for the next election in
two years.
"With the losses tonight, '96
will be a very important elec
tion," he said. "We'll take back
what we lost tonight in *96.
This year was a very anti-demo
crat, anti-incumbent and anti
politics."
