# Sher wins assembly seat
## 
### 
Bucking the Republican trend,
incumbent Byron Sher, a profes
sor at the Law School, won the
21st District State Assembly race
last night. Sher's win held the
seat for the Democratic Party.
Sher beat Stanford graduate
student Bill Mills, finishing with
a solid 63 percent of the district's
votes, compared with Mills' 37
percent.
These numbers reflect returns
from 354 precincts, or 100 per
cent of the precincts in the 21st
District.
The 21st District includes not

only Palo Alto and Stanford, but
Los Altos, Menlo Park and por
tions of Santa Clara County.
Although Mills — a 35-year
old graduate student pursuing
his doctoral degree in electrical
engineering — was not expected
to win yesterday's race, his rela
tively high numbers can be
attributed, in part, to both
national renewed interest in the
GOP and to party-line voting.
In an interview earlier this
week, Mills praised the Republi
can party as the wave of the
nation's future.
