## 
### Justin Pollard Staff writer 
Pete Wilson supporters had
every reason to be happy yester
day, as the incumbent Republican
governor soundly defeated his
Democratic challenger, State Trea
surer Kathleen Brown, by a nearly
three-to-two margin.
With 99 percent of the vote tal
lied, Wilson won by 55 percent to
41 percent.

workers and other Republicans
from Santa Clara County celebrat
ed their victory in San Jose.
"This is a great night for the
Republican party because the peo
ple have said they agree with what
we represent," said Betty Quick,
chair of the Santa Clara County
Pete Wilson Re-election Commit
tee. "They want to give us a chance
to carry out the promises we have
made."
The election was "somewhat of
a referendum on President Clin

ton," Quick said. It was "reflective
of people's unhappiness with the
Democratic administration — peo
ple want change."
"I think [Wilson won] because
people focused on his goals — what
he has done and intends to do. He
has worked hard to bring [Califor
nia's] economy back, and the state
is beginning to move back up eco
nomically," Quick said.
Even Wilson supporters agreed
that his victory was in large part
due to a poor campaign by Kath
leen Brown.
"People didn't have a lot of con
fidence in [Brown's] ability to be a
good governor, because she lacks
knowledge and experience," Quick
said.
"The only reason Wilson won
was because the Democrats put up
such a lackluster candidate," added
Ted Bundesen, a 1992 Republican
candidate for Congress.
"[Brown] ran no campaign. She

ran on his issues and lost on his
issues," Bundesen said. Wilson
won "not because he deserved to
win but because [Brown] deserved
to lose," he said.
Republicans were jubilant not
only because Wilson won but
because their party also gained
control of the U.S. Senate and the
House of Representatives.
"This is the first time Republi
cans have a majority in the House
and Senate since 1954," said Glo
ria Horn, chair of the Santa Clara
County Republican Committee.
"It's a great year."
"I thought it was more likely to
see the Berlin Wall come down in
our lifetime than for Republicans
to win the House and Senate,"
said Paul Mazzetta, a Wilson sup
porter.
Some have said that Wilson's
win also puts him in a very strong
position for national office, and
he is already being discussed as a
possible 1996 Presidential candi
date.
