Pete Wilson supporters had
every reason to be happy yester
day, as the incumbent Republican
governor soundly defeated his
Democratic challenger, State Trea
surer Kathleen Brown, by a nearly
three-to-two margin.
With 99 percent of the vote tal

of people's unhappiness with the
Democratic administration — peo
ple want change."

people focused on his goals — what
he has done and intends to do. He
has worked hard to bring [Califor

is beginning to move back up eco

good governor, because she lacks
knowledge and experience," Quick
said.
"The only reason Wilson won
was because the Democrats put up
such a lackluster candidate," added
Ted Bundesen, a 1992 Republican
candidate for Congress.
"[Brown] ran no campaign. She
