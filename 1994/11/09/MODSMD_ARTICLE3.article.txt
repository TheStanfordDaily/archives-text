# 'Mandate'
## Stanford GOP celebrates victory 
### Sheila McDonald 
All was more than well at the
Stanford College Republicans'
election-watch meeting last night
as evidence of their party's tidal
wave victory mounted.
"I think the mandate of this
election is clear — it's the massive
repudiation of President Clinton
and his liberal agenda," said club
president Adam Ross, who sport
ed a T-shirt with Ronald Reagan's
picture and the caption, 'Remem
ber when America had a real pres
ident?'
Other members were more sur
prised by the victory.
"I never, ever thought we'd
make this kind of progress," said
former College Republicans presi
dent Cyd Zeigler, a senior. "A cou
ple of months ago, many of these
[Democratic candidates] were
deemed undefeatable."
Ross, a senior, said he believes
Clinton's proposed health-care
program — "a government
takeover of the greatest health
care system in the world" — was
one of the agenda points to which
voters were responding.
Freshman Nicole Cooper, an
other member, also singled out
health care as one of the Democra
tic party's most vulnerable
points. Cooper, who described
herself as liberal in her social
views, said she is a Republican
"purely and solely" for economic
reasons.
Ross, who is from Texas, said
victories in his home state —
from pro-choice Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison to George W. Bush,
who ran on a particularly con
servative platform — show that
the Republican party is attract
ing voters of all stripes.
Another club member, Grad
uate School of Business student
Richard Rock, said losing candi
dates like Sen. Dave McCurdy
from Oklahoma and Sen. Jim
Sasser from Tennessee were
"new Democrat" casualties of
Clinton's unpopularity.
"Clinton took on the mantle
of 'new Democrat' — fiscally
conservative, favoring lower
taxes — but then governed as a
liberal when he had cam
paigned as a conservative," he
said.
Rock added that incumbent
Democrats who won back their
seats will remember the scare of
their slim winning margins.
"I think they will think twice
the next time they vote on liber

al spending bills, because they
know they're treading on thin
ice," Rock said.
Rock was unruffled about the
defeat of Oliver North in Vir
ginia.
"I think lots of Democrats are
disappointed North didn't win
because it would have given
them a lightning rod for the next
two years," he said. "It's just
like Republicans would like to
get rid of Ted Kennedy, but he's
something for the party to rail
against."
Zeigler, the former club pres
ident, threw up his hands at vot
ers in his home state of Mas
sachusetts.
"[lt] seems to be the only
state re-electing a multi-term
Democrat to the Senate," he
said.
Dating to the 19605, the Col
lege Republicans currently have
more than 100 members. Ross
said that University policy for
bids student organizations from
officially endorsing candidates,
but that about 50 club members
had helped local Republican
campaigns with precinct walks
and other tasks.
"I've gone through two of
these things that haven't been
so happy — when Clinton won in
1992, and when the Liberals
won in Canada last year," Cebal
los said. "It's very exciting to be
here."
