# Democratic Eshoo retains office amid praise
## 14th Congressional District incumbent bucks Republican trend 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Amid widespread Democratic
defeats, incumbent Anna Eshoo bucked
the trend and beat her Republican oppo
nent Ben Brink in the 14th Congression
al District elections.
Eshoo received 61 percent of the vote
after all of the precincts in the district —
which encompasses Stanford — had
reported their results in the district.
"I'm honored and privileged [to have
wonl. It's a privilege for [voters] to say,
'Yes, we want you to return to the
House,' " Eshoo said.
At Eshoo's Mountain View head
quarters, volunteers gathered to watch
the returns and celebrate her victory.
Her triumph, however, was never
really in doubt, said Amy Kershaw, the
organizer for the North Santa Clara
County office. "Ben Brink came in late [to
the race] and didn't have much name
recognition," she said. "We didn't think
that he could mount a real challenge."
The volunteers unanimously praised
Eshoo's political record and character.
"There are poor politicians, but Anna
Eshoo is not one of them," said Stanford
freshman Bill Shen, a campaign volun
teer. "The voters around here are more
educated and informed [than voters in
general] and Eshoo has earned their
trust."

Art Lynch, executive vice president of the
North California Democratic Council com
mended Eshoo's "good character, intelligence
and thoughtfulness."
Eshoo is especially beneficial for Stanford
students, said senior Eloise Lawrence, a vol
unteer. "She's very approachable and [will
ing] to have students help her out," she

It's a privilege for [voters] to
say, we want you to return
to the House.'

added.
Eshoo's victory was marred by the number
of Democrats who were defeated. "Unfortu
nately, there will be many of my colleagues
whom I won't be serving with," she said.
"That saddens me."
Democratic congressman Tom Lantos of
San Francisco and San Mateo blamed the
losses on the "sour mood of the country and
the penetrating cynicism whipped up by the
Rush Limbaughs" of the nation.
"The remedy to the irrationality of the
electorate is education, politics and hard
work," he said.
Despite the Democrats' poor showing,
Eshoo did not give up hope. "We will survive
and come back. I'll work with the new leader
ship to try and make things work," she said.
