# Feinstein claims late-night victory
## Trailing early, senator claims 2 percent win 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
Despite widespread Republican wins in yester
day's elections, Democrat Dianne Feinstein came
out as the victor last night in a tight, down-to
the-wire race for one of California's U.S. Senate
seats.
Feinstein trailed her Republican challenger,
Michael Huffington, for much of the evening.
Hundreds of people gathered in support of Fein
stein at the San Francisco Fairmont Hotel
cheered when the results showed an even 46 per
cent for each candidate at about 11:30 p.m.
But this morning, the Associated Press
declared Feinstein the winner by a 47 to 45 per
cent margin although 700,000 absentee ballots
remain uncounted.
Democrat Barbara Boxer, the other California
senator, told the crowd that Huffmgton's early
lead in the results did not guarantee a victory.
"Those early results are coming in from
Republican strongholds," she said. "I say this
because I've had this experience before." In the
1992 elections, Boxer was expected to lose her
race but won after more results were tabulated.
Shortly after midnight, Feinstein gave a brief
speech to the crowd of supporters.
"It seems to me that we don't know yet what
the final result will be, but I wanted to come
down and say thank you," she said. "This has
been a tough campaign."
"Two years ago, you said, 'Go to Washington
and make a difference for California,' and we
have .... I want you to be proud of this candida
cy because I have worked hard for the people of
California."
California "is a great state — a state of hope, a
state of opportunity, a state in which if we work
together, we can make it better for every one of
our residents," Feinstein said.
"I want to thank you for waiting for what has
been a long evening," she added. "Now we just
have to be patient."
The first results gave Feinstein a lead in the
election, which made campaign staffers confi
dent, said Bill Chandler, director of communica
tions for the Feinstein campaign.
The feeling amongst those who worked on the
campaign was "a sense of relief mixed with a
degree of optimism," Chandler said early in the
evening. "The exit polls have us up six points."
Chandler and other staffers remained opti
mistic through the evening that Feinstein would
win. "This campaign pitted a proven leader with
someone who has really done nothing in the
congress," Chandler said. "I think that's what
made the difference."'
There were times in the campaign that wor
ried the staff, he said. "It's been tough. Con
gressman Huffington showed he would say any
thing and do anything in a campaign that would
degrade Dianne's record.
"Huffington spent so much money that it gave

us all a scire that he might succeed," he added.
Campaigner Ben Zebley said he has worked
full-time on the Feinstein campaign because he
shares her politics. Like himself, he said, "the
senator is very moderate when it comes to fiscal
issues but very liberal on social issues."
Another motivation, Zebley said, was that
"having Huffington as a [senator] sounded
frightening to me. He hasn't pushed through any
legislation. I think California needs someone
who's going to fight for it."
Supporters packed the Grand Ballroom at the
Fairmont Hotel, tensely watching several televi
sions for election results. Despite the crowd, sup
porter James White-Gellepes said he was disap
pointed that more people didn't attend, but
guessed that it was because of Feinstein's lead in
the polls.
loiter in the evening, after Feinstein had
slipped to eight points below Huffington and was
crawling slowly back up, Boxer asked the crowd

to be patient while results trickled in.
"You have to understand what's going on in
the country," she explained. "Two years ago, the
people said they wanted change and changed the
presidency. Now they're losing patience and
they're changing the Senate."
With Feinstein's victory, though, "We will be
able to say that our Senate seats are not for sale,"
Boxer said, in criticism of the large sums spent by
Huffington on his campaign. "This is an impor
tant message," she said, "because we are the
trend-setters here."
This Senate race had even more significance
"not only because we are keeping a fighting team
for California in the Senate ... but because
IFeinstein] never ran away from public service.
She said there was a point to it."
"It's been a very, very tough night," Boxer
said at 10 p.m., two hours after polls closed. "But
look — it's getting closer. We're going to be cheer
ing pretty soon."
