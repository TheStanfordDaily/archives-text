# Brink loss blamed on timing
## 
### Crystal Carreon Contributing writer 
At the Republican headquarters
in Redwood City, the celebration
over the party's national sweep in
the U.S. House and Senate elec
tions eased the disappointment
over candidate Ben Brink's loss to
Democrat Anna Eshoo in the 14th
Congressional District elections.
"It's not surprising that he lost,"
said Matt Leipzig, a former political
consultant for Bruce Herschenson,
who ran for U.S. Senate in 1992.
"Northern California is a terrible
area for conservatism. We're right
in one of the hot-beds of liberal
ism."
Amid the sporadic cheering and
applause as news of Republican
gains in national elections contin
ued to pour in, many local Republi
cans gave their own interpretations

as to why Brink did not win.
Dee Foley, a member of the San
Mateo County Republican Central
Committee, said that Eshoo, as the
incumbent, had not only name
recognition among voters but also
had the financial backing to run an
effective campaign.
She said that Brink was "fight
ing from the beginning" for finan
cial support.
"He was scrambling until the
very end for money," Foley said. "If
the race were held three weeks
from now, he would have won — he
was exponentially going up in the
polls."
Although Brink lost, the cam
paign did unite and excite many
Republicans in the district, accord
ing to Caroline Trotter, coordinator
of the steering finance committee.
"Ben has had tremendous sup
port from the Republican Party

itself," she said. "In this district,
those who have had the opportuni
ty to meet him are very impressed
by him."
Brink's loss, however, is over
shadowed by the "tremendous"
Republican gains throughout the
nation, Trotter said.
The mood of the country has
changed dramatically over the past
two years, said Brink campaign vol
unteer Michael Schuh.
"Two years ago, Clinton said
that he would do all these wonder
ful things. He didn't," Schuh said.
"People don't believe him anymore
and are voting Republican."
As the crowd of about 75 Repub
licans continued to cheer the
incoming election results, Foley
said that the political change in
Washington is encouraging.
"It's a good night to be a Repub
lican," Foley said.
