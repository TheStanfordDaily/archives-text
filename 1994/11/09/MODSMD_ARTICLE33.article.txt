# Prop. 187's passage consoles Huffington
## 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
Though the controversial Propo
sition 187 — to which Rep. Michael
Huffington tied his campaign —
passed, he won't be going to the Sen
ate next year.
"She [Feinsteinl ran twice ...
she's got the greatest name I.D.
said Gloria Horn, chair of Santa
Clara County Republicans speaking
at their campaign headquarters in
San Jose last night.
Although party members could
not celebrate a Huffington victory,
they cheered at the news that Propo
sition 187 had passed.
"This will force the government
to protect the borders against illegal
immigrants," said Republican sup
porter Pete Contostavlos, who
immigrated to California in 1947. "I
came in legally and I don't think
other people should come in illegal
ly."
However, Horn, who is an Asian
American, said that the proposition
was not her favorite issue. "I had a
lot of pressure to be against 187
because I'm a minority and what it
does to minorities," she said.
But she added that she thinks the
situation would have been worse if
the proposition had not passed.
Because now there will be fewer ille
gal aliens in California, she said, peo

pie will not readily assume minori
ties are illegal aliens.
Santa Clara Republican cam
paign workers disagreed last night
as to whether weeks of a much-criti
cized negative campaign between
Huffington and Feinstein affected
the electorate's vote.
With little known about Huffin
gton's political agenda and lack of
congressional experience, some felt
that his campaign should have
focused more on his agenda.
"There should be less mud-rak
ing and more issues... people would
rather vote on issues more than
mudslinging," Republican Bill
Proudy said.
While he said he thought it was
the "dirtiest campaign" he's ever
seen, Contostavlos said the charac
ter of a person is as important as the
issues.
Not all of Republican Pete Wilson
campaigners celebrating victory in
San Jose supported Huffington.
"I'm not really excited about Huff
ington ... he's politically unknown,"
said Mark Patrasso, President of Sili
con Valley Log Cabin, a gay and les
bian organization. "His agenda is a
mystery to me."
Patrasso said that he supported
Feinstein because of her "well
known agenda" and political history,
but does favor Huffington's liberal
stance on gays in the military.
