## Alternative stress relief 
### 
Sometimes you get too busy to focus on some of the
more important things in life.
Too busy flirting with your section leader to actually
grasp the profundities of Plato (350 pages worth of pro
fundities at that). Too busy flipping through compli
mentary J. Crew and L.L. Bean Christmas catalogs to
even realize that you're procrastinating.
Too busy leading shady sex lives through forwarded e
mail messages to actually comprehend that sex, death
and power, or any combination thereof, is the key to that
paper you're trying to write.
Too busy dissecting the aesthetic value of your neigh
bor's "Pin the Penis on John Bobbitt" poster while the
Intervarsity Christian group down the hall gives you the

collective evil eye to realize that it's five o'clock in the
morning — again.
Those and the other preoccupations during the quar
terly midterms sweep are, well, rather unhealthy ten
dencies.
The ungodly all-nighters spent learning history from
the dawn of time to at least the Middle Ages, those bags
of Cool Ranch Doritos stashed in your room for mid
night emergencies, that permanent slouch you've
acquired from napping in the libraries.
Pretty soon, everyone realizes the hazardous effects
of those papers and exams.
For guys, their muscle mass will begin to decrease
proportionally with the number of hours they spend
buried in Green. Their athletic ability is sapped with
every extra brain contortion they're subjected to in
those pre-med classes.
For women, well, let's just say that eating habits dur
ing midterms can stretch the meaning of control-top
pantyhose to another dimension. And the freshman 15?
Of course it's a myth, only in the sense that freshman
might be a narrowly constructed misnomer in this situ
ation.
What ever happened to that state champion in swim-

ming, that varsity letter holder in
five sports, or even that weekend
beach volleyball bum?
Gone are the freshman orien
tation days with the impromptu
ultimate Frisbee showdowns, the
mud volleyball games and that
indefatigable enthusiasm in IMs.
In its place are former athletes
coping with the suffocating atmo
sphere which defines those
midterm hell weeks.
Academia, when taken in large
doses, is extremely harmful to
your health. Take a look at the
goobers at M.I.T. or CalTech.
As for the average Stanford
student, they don workout shorts
and the requisite Stanford sweat
shirts and head for the gyms to
rediscover that lean muscle
under all those layers of gray
matter.
It's a chance for the former
high school linebacker to grunt
and sweat and experience his first
rush of testosterone since, well,
high school. It's also a chance to
go and check out the body pierc
ings on some of the more expres
sive members of this campus.
And then there are the guys who
wear those heinous G-string-like
tank tops, only in deference to the
shirt rule.
For a little aerobic exercise,
there is Ariana's Afro-funk class
every week, guaranteed to work

muscles around the butt you
never knew you had.
For more aerobic toning, hun
dreds of dedicated women dili
gently perform thousands of step
repetitions at high-impact aero
bics. On the crapping step, off the
crapping step, on the crapping
step... #
And if you're motivated
enough, you can step to your own
music, at your own pace, while
watching the guys play IM bas
ketball at the Ford Center Stair-
Masters.
For the highly motivated men
and women there is always the
more traditional body-abuse
method — running. During
midterm week you see an
increased amount of Walkman
toting, spandex-wearing jogger
extraordinaires huffing and puff
ing along the Campus Drive
route, up to the dish, around
campus or at the track — mutter
ing chemical formulae or reciting
Shakespeare under their breaths.
So when the procrastination
bug hits again while studying for
midterms this week, fight the
urge to snuggle up with another
bag of microwave popcorn (24
grams of fat in that baby) while
watching your favorite episodes
of Melrose on tape.
Instead, go out and see if you
can run that five- or six-minute
mile. Just for old time's sake.

Clad appropriately in her sweats,
Kathryn will join those speedsters
(just as soon as she finishes her
carton of Ben and Jerry's).
