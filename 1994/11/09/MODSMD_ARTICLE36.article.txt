## Alternative stress relief 
### 
Sometimes you get too busy to focus on some of the
more important things in life.
Too busy flirting with your section leader to actually
grasp the profundities of Plato (350 pages worth of pro
fundities at that). Too busy flipping through compli

even realize that you're procrastinating.
Too busy leading shady sex lives through forwarded e
mail messages to actually comprehend that sex, death
and power, or any combination thereof, is the key to that
paper you're trying to write.
Too busy dissecting the aesthetic value of your neigh

Intervarsity Christian group down the hall gives you the

collective evil eye to realize that it's five o'clock in the
morning — again.
Those and the other preoccupations during the quar

The ungodly all-nighters spent learning history from
the dawn of time to at least the Middle Ages, those bags
of Cool Ranch Doritos stashed in your room for mid
night emergencies, that permanent slouch you've
acquired from napping in the libraries.
Pretty soon, everyone realizes the hazardous effects
of those papers and exams.
For guys, their muscle mass will begin to decrease
proportionally with the number of hours they spend
buried in Green. Their athletic ability is sapped with
every extra brain contortion they're subjected to in
those pre-med classes.
For women, well, let's just say that eating habits dur
ing midterms can stretch the meaning of control-top
pantyhose to another dimension. And the freshman 15?
Of course it's a myth, only in the sense that freshman
might be a narrowly constructed misnomer in this situ
ation.
