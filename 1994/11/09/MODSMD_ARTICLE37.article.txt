# Ruggers jumpstart
## 
### John Lawson 
As the Cardinal second and
third teams, comprised of
freshmen and newcomers,
headed off to the University of
Nevada-Reno for Saturday
afternoon games, head coach
Franck Boivert didn't know
what to make of his new crop
of ruggers.
Upon their return to the
Farm, some sense of security
came over him â€” the seconds
handled Reno's first team 10-0
and the thirds shutout the
Wolf Pack second team 3-0.
Playing on a narrower
than-regulation rugby pitch
hampered the ruggers' fast,
darting style, especially
against the larger, more physi
cal Reno players. But Stanford
was still able to exploit its
hosts' lack of foot speed to
come away with victories.
"Nevada-Reno has just
recently begun to develop a
rugby program," said senior
club president Jeff Freund.
"Their team doesn't have the
experience that ours does but
is chalk full of ex-football play
ers. We were able to run
around them just enough to
win."
Boivert was anxious to see
what his new players could

accomplish in their first game,
since he thought they had been
practicing extremely well dur
ing the previous two weeks.
"I was impressed with the
way they performed Satur
day," he said. "Freshmen Ray
Richardson and Dave Water,
especially, played great games.
Ray won the game for us with
a 45-yard run and Dave dis
played excellent decision-mak
ing throughout the match."
Boivert noted that these fresh
men may not remain on the
second team for much longer
with such superb play.
Instead they would move up
to the first team, which took
the weekend off after spending
the previous one in Los Ange
les facing UCLA and Cal State
Fullerton. Stanford ran over
the Bruins 40-0 in the first
match, playing with pace and
authority.
"That attitude cost us a vic
tory against Fullerton,"
Boivert said of the 17-17 tie in
the following match. "We were
over-confident and not concen
trating at the task at hand. I'm
glad we experienced that early
in the year so that we can learn
from our mistake."
