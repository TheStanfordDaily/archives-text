# From the ashes
## Out of tragedy came new strength for Eliel Swinton 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
The man is now a weapon, tem
pered by the distinct forces of love
and death.
The weapon is poised to strike,
with little regard to what it harms,
as long as it causes suffering.
Love and death struggle against
each other, but come together to
fuel the inner furnace of Eliel
Swinton's soul.
Seeing his life fall apart on
October 20, the fateful night he
learned his fiancee Jessica
Williams had died in a car accident,
Swinton has dealt with enough
pain to last a lifetime. And now,
the sophomore defensive back
wants to share that feeling with
others.
M I have a lot of pain in me right
now," Swinton said. The night he
found out that Williams had died,
he felt "like all my bones fell down
to my feet and I was just standing
there."
Engineered since birth by his
parents to be a football player,
Swinton decided that it is no
longer a game. While he has main
tained his characteristically friend
ly, open demeanor of! the field,
Swinton has poured his aggression
out through football. After one
game back in the lineup, the faucet
is Still wide open.
"Whoever is playing against me,
I look at it as if they killed my girl
friend," he said in describing his
game-day mentality. "I can release
all my anger on the field, and do it
legally. I can just go out there and
unload on somebody. Even if I
punch somebody, it's only a 15-
yard penalty. It's not like I'm going
tojail."
Swinton is a changed person

since the accident. Always a little
crazy on the field, he now plays the
game with pure reckless abandon,
getting in the face of any opponent
who dares talk back to him.
Against Washington, the 190-
pound Swinton nearly went toe-to
toe with 245-pound Ail-American
tight end Mark Bruener and sever
al of the Huskies' mammoth offen
sive linemen.
"I'm a little more psychotic on
the field, because I really want to
hurt somebody now and it's legal,."
he said. "I know I can do it, if I put
my mind to it. I could really dam
age somebody. I'm a bruiser. I'm
going to get in your face, scream in
your face, and I'm going to blow
you up. I'm literally going to try to
kill you."
His shoes bear a stark reminder
of his recent ordeal. Across each
toe, the word "Jessica" is writtert.
On the back, "love" and "death"
are on each heel, forcing him to see
both the joy he felt with her and
the fact that she is no longer with
him while he is out on the field.
"That's basically the love I have
for her, but she's dead," Swinton
said. "There's a line between
them, but it really doesn't divide
them. I love her in death, never
theless."
Besides the grief and pain he
has been through surrounding the
death of Williams, Swinton has
also had to grapple with a deterio
rating family life. While his moth
er Paula still remains close to his
heart, his father Oscar has moved
out of the picture. According to
Swinton, his father made some
choices that the family did not.
approve of over the past year or so,
and Swinton just does not want to
deaJ with that at this point in his
life.
Since then Swinton and his
older brothers have cut off
almost all contact with their
father. Only recently have they
begun to attempt to let their
father know how much he has
hurt the family.
Growing up a self-described
"thug" in Los Angeles, Swinton
used football to forge alliances
with those who became his
teammates. Fiercely loyal to
"his boys" on the team, Swinton
sees the Stanford football squad
as his family.
As freshmen last year, he and
running back Quincy Jacobs
were getting teased by Jason
White and other upperclassmen
who asked the two first-year
players when they would get the
customary tattoo many of the
Cardinal players wore.
After the season had ended,
Swinton called up Jacobs one
night and the two journeyed to
undertake the ritual. The simple
"No Fear" emblazoned on the
ankle of White and others was
not enough; Swinton and Jacobs
decided on something more
specifically relevant to their time
as members of the Stanford foot
ball team. The result — a power
ful w C-House" (Cardinal House)
etched on their arms stands as a
testament to their devotion to
the Cardinal program.
Since then, Swinton has seen
his family life begin to crumble
and his anchor at school disap
pear. Describing his relationship
with Williams as "a fairy tale,"
Swinton is quick to remember
all the positive moments he had
with her. Out of everything she
did and meant to him, Swinton
believes her insistence to never
give up has helped him greatly
through the past three weeks.
Before her tragic death, a hip
flexor and quadricep injury had
sidelined Swinton for three
weeks. Football and Williams
had always been there for Swin
ton at different times during his
entire life, and for two weeks, he
had neither. For someone who
had been so heavily involved in
football since the age of three,
the sport became a given.
"It's like my girlfriend — you

never know how much you love
her until it's gone," he said.
"You know you love the sport, I
know I love her, but you learn
how much you love her when
they're gone, but by that time
it's too late. I'm back playing
again, but with her, she's gone. I
almost look at it as if I have
another chance with football,
but not with her. So you better
make sure you do all you can
while you can."
His experiences over the past
three weeks have taught Swin
ton much about life and his own
inevitable death. "Life and
death, not a big deal to me any
more. I'm prepared to go tomor
row. If somebody came right
here right now, and said one of
us is going to die, me or you, I'd
probably stand up and say, 'take
me.' I'm more prepared," he
said.
But by gathering strength
from his memories of Williams
and her indomitable work ethic,
he has fought his way back onto
the field and on his first play of
the Washington game, he saw a
Napoleon Kaufman fumble roll
wildly into his path.
"I got cut, or slipped or some
thing and as I was falling I saw
the ball fly out, maybe five yards
away," he said. "I thought, 'the
ball.' So I scooped it up and
started running, but I couldn't
get out of third. My gears were
grinding, and by then [Washing
ton quarterback Damon] Huard
had the angle and forced me out
of bounds. It was kind of embar
rassing. That's all Mike
[Mitchell] talks about."
These days, Swinton still uses
the self-hypnosis technique a
high school coach taught him to
prepare for each game. Slowly
letting all the energy leave his
body in deep breaths, Swinton
then envisions every play he
missed in previous games.
But then the "human high
light tape" kicks in, and he sees
himself making every one of
those plays in ferocious fashion.
Swinton has added memories
from his time with Williams,
and all these mental images
slowly build up in his mind.
With every breath, the energy
grows within his muscular body
as he once again becomes a
weapon bent on delivering just a
piece of the suffering he has
endured and continues to strug
gle through.

from his time with Williams,
and all these mental images
slowly build up in his mind.
With every breath, the energy
grows within his muscular body
as he once again becomes a
weapon bent on delivering just a
piece of the suffering he has
endured and continues to strug

Intensity is Swinton's trademark on the field, but when he plays well, even he has time to smile.
The man is now a weapon, tem
pered by the distinct forces of love
and death.
The weapon is poised to strike,
with little regard to what it harms,
as long as it causes suffering.
Love and death struggle against
each other, but come together to
fuel the inner furnace of Eliel
Swinton's soul.
Seeing his life fall apart on
October 20, the fateful night he
learned his fiancee Jessica
Williams had died in a car accident,
Swinton has dealt with enough
pain to last a lifetime. And now,
the sophomore defensive back
wants to share that feeling with
others.
M I have a lot of pain in me right
now," Swinton said. The night he
found out that Williams had died,
he felt "like all my bones fell down
to my feet and I was just standing
there."
Engineered since birth by his
parents to be a football player,
Swinton decided that it is no
longer a game. While he has main
tained his characteristically friend
ly, open demeanor of! the field,
Swinton has poured his aggression
out through football. After one
game back in the lineup, the faucet
is Still wide open.
"Whoever is playing against me,
I look at it as if they killed my girl
friend," he said in describing his
game-day mentality. "I can release
all my anger on the field, and do it
legally. I can just go out there and
unload on somebody. Even if I
punch somebody, it's only a 15-
yard penalty. It's not like I'm going
tojail."
Swinton is a changed person

since the accident. Always a little
crazy on the field, he now plays the
game with pure reckless abandon,
getting in the face of any opponent
who dares talk back to him.
Against Washington, the 190-
pound Swinton nearly went toe-to
toe with 245-pound Ail-American
tight end Mark Bruener and sever
al of the Huskies' mammoth offen
sive linemen.
"I'm a little more psychotic on
the field, because I really want to
hurt somebody now and it's legal,."
he said. "I know I can do it, if I put
my mind to it. I could really dam
age somebody. I'm a bruiser. I'm
going to get in your face, scream in
your face, and I'm going to blow
you up. I'm literally going to try to
kill you."
His shoes bear a stark reminder
of his recent ordeal. Across each
toe, the word "Jessica" is writtert.
On the back, "love" and "death"
are on each heel, forcing him to see
both the joy he felt with her and
the fact that she is no longer with
him while he is out on the field.
"That's basically the love I have
for her, but she's dead," Swinton
said. "There's a line between
them, but it really doesn't divide
them. I love her in death, never
theless."
Besides the grief and pain he
has been through surrounding the
death of Williams, Swinton has
also had to grapple with a deterio
rating family life. While his moth
er Paula still remains close to his
heart, his father Oscar has moved
out of the picture. According to
Swinton, his father made some
choices that the family did not.
approve of over the past year or so,
and Swinton just does not want to
deaJ with that at this point in his
life.
Since then Swinton and his
older brothers have cut off
almost all contact with their
father. Only recently have they
begun to attempt to let their
father know how much he has
hurt the family.
Growing up a self-described
"thug" in Los Angeles, Swinton
used football to forge alliances
with those who became his
teammates. Fiercely loyal to
"his boys" on the team, Swinton
sees the Stanford football squad
as his family.
As freshmen last year, he and
running back Quincy Jacobs
were getting teased by Jason
White and other upperclassmen
who asked the two first-year
players when they would get the
customary tattoo many of the
Cardinal players wore.
After the season had ended,
Swinton called up Jacobs one
night and the two journeyed to
undertake the ritual. The simple
"No Fear" emblazoned on the
ankle of White and others was
not enough; Swinton and Jacobs
decided on something more
specifically relevant to their time
as members of the Stanford foot
ball team. The result — a power
ful w C-House" (Cardinal House)
etched on their arms stands as a
testament to their devotion to
the Cardinal program.
Since then, Swinton has seen
his family life begin to crumble
and his anchor at school disap
pear. Describing his relationship
with Williams as "a fairy tale,"
Swinton is quick to remember
all the positive moments he had
with her. Out of everything she
did and meant to him, Swinton
believes her insistence to never
give up has helped him greatly
through the past three weeks.
Before her tragic death, a hip
flexor and quadricep injury had
sidelined Swinton for three
weeks. Football and Williams
had always been there for Swin
ton at different times during his
entire life, and for two weeks, he
had neither. For someone who
had been so heavily involved in
football since the age of three,
the sport became a given.
"It's like my girlfriend — you

never know how much you love
her until it's gone," he said.
"You know you love the sport, I
know I love her, but you learn
how much you love her when
they're gone, but by that time
it's too late. I'm back playing
again, but with her, she's gone. I
almost look at it as if I have
another chance with football,
but not with her. So you better
make sure you do all you can
while you can."
His experiences over the past
three weeks have taught Swin
ton much about life and his own
inevitable death. "Life and
death, not a big deal to me any
more. I'm prepared to go tomor
row. If somebody came right
here right now, and said one of
us is going to die, me or you, I'd
probably stand up and say, 'take
me.' I'm more prepared," he
said.
But by gathering strength
from his memories of Williams
and her indomitable work ethic,
he has fought his way back onto
the field and on his first play of
the Washington game, he saw a
Napoleon Kaufman fumble roll
wildly into his path.
"I got cut, or slipped or some
thing and as I was falling I saw
the ball fly out, maybe five yards
away," he said. "I thought, 'the
ball.' So I scooped it up and
started running, but I couldn't
get out of third. My gears were
grinding, and by then [Washing
ton quarterback Damon] Huard
had the angle and forced me out
of bounds. It was kind of embar
rassing. That's all Mike
[Mitchell] talks about."
These days, Swinton still uses
the self-hypnosis technique a
high school coach taught him to
prepare for each game. Slowly
letting all the energy leave his
body in deep breaths, Swinton
then envisions every play he
missed in previous games.
But then the "human high
light tape" kicks in, and he sees
himself making every one of
those plays in ferocious fashion.
