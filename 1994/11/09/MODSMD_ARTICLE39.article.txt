# From the ashes
## Out of tragedy came new strength for Eliel Swinton 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
The man is now a weapon, tem
pered by the distinct forces of love
and death.
The weapon is poised to strike,
with little regard to what it harms,
as long as it causes suffering.
Love and death struggle against
each other, but come together to
fuel the inner furnace of Eliel
Swinton's soul.
Seeing his life fall apart on
October 20, the fateful night he
learned his fiancee Jessica
Williams had died in a car accident,
Swinton has dealt with enough
pain to last a lifetime. And now,
the sophomore defensive back
wants to share that feeling with
others.
M I have a lot of pain in me right
now," Swinton said. The night he
found out that Williams had died,
he felt "like all my bones fell down
to my feet and I was just standing
there."
Engineered since birth by his
parents to be a football player,
Swinton decided that it is no
longer a game. While he has main
tained his characteristically friend
ly, open demeanor of! the field,
Swinton has poured his aggression
out through football. After one
game back in the lineup, the faucet
is Still wide open.
"Whoever is playing against me,
I look at it as if they killed my girl
friend," he said in describing his
game-day mentality. "I can release
all my anger on the field, and do it
legally. I can just go out there and
unload on somebody. Even if I
punch somebody, it's only a 15-
yard penalty. It's not like I'm going
tojail."
Swinton is a changed person

since the accident. Always a little
crazy on the field, he now plays the
game with pure reckless abandon,
getting in the face of any opponent
who dares talk back to him.
Against Washington, the 190-
pound Swinton nearly went toe-to
toe with 245-pound Ail-American
tight end Mark Bruener and sever
al of the Huskies' mammoth offen
sive linemen.
"I'm a little more psychotic on
the field, because I really want to
hurt somebody now and it's legal,."
he said. "I know I can do it, if I put
my mind to it. I could really dam
age somebody. I'm a bruiser. I'm
going to get in your face, scream in
your face, and I'm going to blow
you up. I'm literally going to try to
kill you."
His shoes bear a stark reminder
of his recent ordeal. Across each
toe, the word "Jessica" is writtert.
On the back, "love" and "death"
are on each heel, forcing him to see
both the joy he felt with her and
the fact that she is no longer with
him while he is out on the field.
"That's basically the love I have
for her, but she's dead," Swinton
said. "There's a line between
them, but it really doesn't divide
them. I love her in death, never
theless."
Besides the grief and pain he
has been through surrounding the
death of Williams, Swinton has
also had to grapple with a deterio
rating family life. While his moth
er Paula still remains close to his
heart, his father Oscar has moved
out of the picture. According to
Swinton, his father made some
choices that the family did not.
