# Ins and outs of the sport of water polo
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
For years, Stanford University has been a
national powerhouse in the sport of water polo.
The Cardinal has claimed seven NCAA champi
onships, including last year's triumph.
This season, coach Dante Dettamanti's
squad has amassed a 19-1 record while retain

ing its No. 1 rank in the nation since the pre
season polls were released.
But the most frequently asked question on
campus regarding the defending national cham
pions of collegiate water polo is not "Can they
repeat?"
Around Stanford, the more common inquiry
is probably as simple as, "What's water polo?"
Because water polo is mainly a regional sport

which has boomed throughout California, many
people have never heard of it, much less seen it
played.
The action can be compared to several other
more widely known sports. The primary skill is
swimming, as players cannot touch the bottom
of the pool at any time.
Like soccer and hockey, water
polo features field players and a goal
tender. The goaltender is the only
player allowed to use two hands to
control the ball — the six players on
the field must use only one.
Offensively, one can compare the
game to basketball. The center-for
ward, or hole position, is similar to
the center. The offense often runs
through the holeman, who is usual
ly the biggest and strongest player
on a team. All other field players
play the roles of drivers. The fast
break counterattack is comparable
to basketball's fast break.
Recently, the collegiate game
added a two-point goal, which is
awarded for any shot made from
beyond seven meters outside of the
goal-box.
Defensively, teams often choose
between a pressing man-to-man or
a zone defense of some type. Ejec
tion fouls of 20 seconds result in
six-on-five extra-man situations,
comparable to hockey's power play.
Unlike other more "All-Ameri

can" sports, water polo referees are
not in the midst of the action, but
stand at poolside to officiate. The
result is a constant battle waged
underneath the water — just about
everything the referee cannot see is
fine and legal. Indeed, the action is
fast-paced, exciting and sometimes
brutal.
Water polo, the oldest Olympic
team-sport, is considered one of the
most physically strenuous of all the
Olympic events.
"I don't know why water polo
isn't more popular," Dettamanti
said. "It's growing. Unfortunately,
we're competing for athletes with
other sports like soccer which are
gaining popularity."
The lack of publicity of the sport
can be traced back to several fac
tors, beginning with television.
"To be popular, you have to
show well on TV," Dettamanti said.
"It's very hard to film water polo."
To compensate for video diffi
culties, the world governing body
of the sport is considering chang
ing rules to better accommodate
the media. Dettamanti thinks this
would be a big mistake.
"The governing body thinks
water polo needs to be more excit

ing to be more popular," he said.
"But changing the rules won't
change the fact that the action
takes place in the water. What
makes a sport exciting is the
action, the scoring, close games
and great rivalries between teams
— our sport has all of that."
While water polo commands a
tremendous following in Europe,
where several professional leagues
exist, in the States, it remains a
California pastime.
On Stanford's roster, only two
players, Daniel Lehoczky of Hungary
and Wolf Wigo, from New York, hail
from outside the Golden State.
"Water polo is becoming more of
a national sport," Wigo said. "In
the last four years, the number of
high schools with programs has
quadrupled. There is a National
East team, made up of the best col
lege and high school players."
Wigo, who had established him
self as a top prospect since his early
teens, did not hone his skills
through high school competition
like many other players do. The
three-time All-American competed
instead for the New York Athletic
Club — a men's team — through
out his youth.

While the sport is modestly
growing as a whole, women's water
polo has skyrocketed in popularity.
Stanford's women's team will
receive full varsity status next year.
"That's going to be the future of
the spor,." Dettamanti said.
Wigo noted that nationally,
women's water polo is already more
spread out than the men's game.
"There are a lot of good women
players from the East Coast," he
said. "The difference is women
often play on men's teams, so they
can play at a higher level."
California schools still dominate
men's collegiate water polo. Stan
ford, California, UCLA, USC, and
UC-Irvine — all from the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation — are
mainstays at the top of the national
rankings. In 25 years of NCAA tour
nament play, every national cham
pion has come from the MPSF.
"The competition is very
intense," Dettamanti said. "In
football, how many times do you
get to play a top-10 team? Or a top
-25 team. Not too often. But in
water polo practically every game
on the West Coast features two
top-10 teams. That makes all the
matches exciting."

players from the East Coast," he
said. "The difference is women
often play on men's teams, so they
can play at a higher level."
California schools still dominate
men's collegiate water polo. Stan
ford, California, UCLA, USC, and
UC-Irvine — all from the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation — are
mainstays at the top of the national
rankings. In 25 years of NCAA tour
nament play, every national cham
pion has come from the MPSF.
"The competition is very
intense," Dettamanti said. "In
football, how many times do you
get to play a top-10 team? Or a top
-25 team. Not too often. But in
water polo practically every game
on the West Coast features two
top-10 teams. That makes all the
matches exciting."
For years, Stanford University has been a
national powerhouse in the sport of water polo.
The Cardinal has claimed seven NCAA champi
onships, including last year's triumph.
This season, coach Dante Dettamanti's
squad has amassed a 19-1 record while retain

ing its No. 1 rank in the nation since the pre
season polls were released.
But the most frequently asked question on
campus regarding the defending national cham
pions of collegiate water polo is not "Can they
repeat?"
Around Stanford, the more common inquiry
is probably as simple as, "What's water polo?"
Because water polo is mainly a regional sport

which has boomed throughout California, many
people have never heard of it, much less seen it
played.
The action can be compared to several other
more widely known sports. The primary skill is
swimming, as players cannot touch the bottom
of the pool at any time.
Like soccer and hockey, water
polo features field players and a goal
tender. The goaltender is the only
player allowed to use two hands to
control the ball — the six players on
the field must use only one.
Offensively, one can compare the
game to basketball. The center-for
ward, or hole position, is similar to
the center. The offense often runs
through the holeman, who is usual
ly the biggest and strongest player
on a team. All other field players
play the roles of drivers. The fast
break counterattack is comparable
to basketball's fast break.
Recently, the collegiate game
added a two-point goal, which is
awarded for any shot made from
beyond seven meters outside of the
goal-box.
Defensively, teams often choose
between a pressing man-to-man or
a zone defense of some type. Ejec
tion fouls of 20 seconds result in
six-on-five extra-man situations,
comparable to hockey's power play.
Unlike other more "All-Ameri

can" sports, water polo referees are
not in the midst of the action, but
stand at poolside to officiate. The
result is a constant battle waged
underneath the water — just about
everything the referee cannot see is
fine and legal. Indeed, the action is
fast-paced, exciting and sometimes
brutal.
Water polo, the oldest Olympic
team-sport, is considered one of the
most physically strenuous of all the
Olympic events.
"I don't know why water polo
isn't more popular," Dettamanti
said. "It's growing. Unfortunately,
we're competing for athletes with
other sports like soccer which are
gaining popularity."
The lack of publicity of the sport
can be traced back to several fac
tors, beginning with television.
"To be popular, you have to
show well on TV," Dettamanti said.
"It's very hard to film water polo."
To compensate for video diffi
culties, the world governing body
of the sport is considering chang
ing rules to better accommodate
the media. Dettamanti thinks this
would be a big mistake.
"The governing body thinks
water polo needs to be more excit

ing to be more popular," he said.
"But changing the rules won't
change the fact that the action
takes place in the water. What
makes a sport exciting is the
action, the scoring, close games
and great rivalries between teams
— our sport has all of that."
While water polo commands a
tremendous following in Europe,
where several professional leagues
exist, in the States, it remains a
California pastime.
On Stanford's roster, only two
players, Daniel Lehoczky of Hungary
and Wolf Wigo, from New York, hail
from outside the Golden State.
"Water polo is becoming more of
a national sport," Wigo said. "In
the last four years, the number of
high schools with programs has
quadrupled. There is a National
East team, made up of the best col
lege and high school players."
Wigo, who had established him
self as a top prospect since his early
teens, did not hone his skills
through high school competition
like many other players do. The
three-time All-American competed
instead for the New York Athletic
Club — a men's team — through
out his youth.

While the sport is modestly
growing as a whole, women's water
polo has skyrocketed in popularity.
Stanford's women's team will
receive full varsity status next year.
"That's going to be the future of
the spor,." Dettamanti said.
Wigo noted that nationally,
women's water polo is already more
spread out than the men's game.
"There are a lot of good women
players from the East Coast," he
said. "The difference is women
often play on men's teams, so they
can play at a higher level."
California schools still dominate
men's collegiate water polo. Stan
ford, California, UCLA, USC, and
UC-Irvine — all from the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation — are
mainstays at the top of the national
rankings. In 25 years of NCAA tour

get to play a top-10 team? Or a top

on the West Coast features two
