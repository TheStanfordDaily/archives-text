# Ins and outs of the sport of water polo

For years, Stanford University has been a
national powerhouse in the sport of water polo.
The Cardinal has claimed seven NCAA champi
onships, including last year's triumph.
This season, coach Dante Dettamanti's
squad has amassed a 19-1 record while retain

ing its No. 1 rank in the nation since the pre
season polls were released.
But the most frequently asked question on
campus regarding the defending national cham
pions of collegiate water polo is not "Can they
repeat?"
Around Stanford, the more common inquiry
is probably as simple as, "What's water polo?"
Because water polo is mainly a regional sport

which has boomed throughout California, many
people have never heard of it, much less seen it
played.
The action can be compared to several other
more widely known sports. The primary skill is
swimming, as players cannot touch the bottom
of the pool at any time.
