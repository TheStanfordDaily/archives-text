Scott Frost
In the second half of its gridiron confrontation against Washington last
Saturday afternoon, the Cardinal abandoned its high-tech aerial
assault in favor of plain and simple smash-mouth football. After senior
quarterback Steve Stenstrom left the game in the first half with an
injury to the little finger on his throwing hand, sophomore quarterback
Scott Frost stepped up to spark a bruising ground attack, temporarily
transforming Stanford into the top-ranked Nebraska Comhuskers.
Indeed, on one series, Frost engineered a 12-play, 37-yard Stanford
drive which took over six minutes, ending in a 30-yard Eric Abrams
field goal. On the day, Frost averaged eight yards per rush, scrambling
for a total of 88 yards and one touchdown on 11 carries. He also threw
eight passes, completing two for 31 yards and one interception.

Jennifer Poehler
When one considers senior goalkeeper Jennifer Poehler's No. 7
national and No. 2 West Region ranking in goals-against average,
one might at first attribute all the credit to the women's soccer
team's outstanding defense. Indeed, for a significant part of the
year, the Cardinal fullbacks have given Poehler nothing to do. How
ever, Poehler displayed the skills to support her lofly rating this
past weekend against Washington and Washington State. On Fri
day against the Huskies, who have qualified for the NCAA tourna
ment, Poehler posted a career-high 12 saves to help Stanford blank
Washington 2-0. Then against the Cougars on Sunday, she record
ed three more saves and registered her third consecutive shutout, 1-
0, for her 10th of the season.
