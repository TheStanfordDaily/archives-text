# Prop. 187's passage spurs response
## 
### Ben Decker 
Though the controversial Proposition
187 passed by an easy three-to-two margin
yesterday, amid an emotional outcry the
measure's opponents have promised to
continue fighting against it.
Proposition 187, which is designed to
deny education and non-emergency health
care to illegal immigrants, was one of the
most visible issues in the 1994 California
elections, with gubernatorial and Senate
candidates taking strong public stances on

the measure.
But organizations such as "Californi
ans United Against 187" have already
started making plans on how to overturn
the measure, which Californians voted in
59 percent to 41 percent.
"We have a lot of organizing to do, but I
believe 187 will be overturned very easily
and very quickly," said Hugo Hernandez, a
"Californians United" organizer.
Whatever other forms continued oppo
sition to the measure takes, most people
think that a lawsuit challenging the propo

sition's constitutionality will be at the
forefront.
"(Proposition)lB7 is wrong," said Cali
fornia Senator Barbara Boxer in an inter
view with The Daily. "I hope Pete Wilson
meant it when he said he was ready to test
it in court."
In San Francisco, at a "Stop 187" rally,
people were shocked and angered by the
measure's passage. "[Proposition 187] is
part of an attack on immigrants. It's an at-
tack on racial, ethnic, and religious
minorities. It's an attack by the
right wing on what we have built in
California," said Frank Wu, a
teaching fellow at Stanford present
at the rally.
In El Centro Chicano and at a
gathering of those opposed to 187,
people were equally disturbed.
School of Education graduate
student Matthew Scelza, a mem
ber of the Stanford anti-Proposi
tion 187 movement, delivered the
following statement prepared by
the organization: "We regret the
passage of 187. It is a misguided
initiative, blaming California's
economic hardship on immi
grants."
"People see this as a bill that
imposes a sense of fear," said
senior Dave Castillo, a resident
assistant in Casa Zapata. "It is
similar to many other policies
imposed on the lower classes, in
the hope that some problem will be
solved. Instead of looking at the
root of the problem they're perse

cuting those not able to defend
themselves."
Despite the initial feelings of
sadness and frustration, many
organizers of anti-187 movements
see it as only a setback that will
encourage immigrant communi
ties to organize politically.
"The sleeping giant is no longer
asleep," said Mike Garcia, a mem
ber of the steering committee of
Californians United Against 187 in
San Jose. "For many years the
Latino community has been under
represented at the polls, Proposi
tion 187 has given the community
a wake up call."
"The Latino community is a
community that has traditionally
not voted, but this has brought us
together," said Mario Salgado, the
statewide campaign manager for
"Californians United", "We want
•to build a political voice."
The proposition played a major
role in California's gubernatorial
race. Governor Pete Wilson made
the proposition a cornerstone of his
campaign, and those opposed to
187 said he will regret it.
"In Wilson's case, it's pretty
simple: he rode the coat tails of the
anti-immigrant feeling. He was

able to effectively get the California
voter's minds off the economy,"
said Political Science Prof. Luis
Fraga, director of the Center of
Chicano Itesearch.
"The law may be on Wilson's
side, but the demographics are on
ours. I don't think he'll be able to
go anywhere without hundreds of
protesters," Garcia warned.
"Wilson has just committed the
biggest mistake of his life," Her
nandez said, "Now we have a
cause. You can't stop people with a
cause."
No one could predict exactly
what opponents will do in reaction
to Proposition 187, but many
expect walk outs and marches.
Hernandez emphasized that "Cali
fornia United" urges ail students
to remain in school, and the orga
nization is "stressing total and
complete non-violence."
Nothing definite has been
planned at Stanford, but Castillo
said to "look for something soon."
The Stanford branch of Stop
187 will be holding a meeting
tonight in the Asian-American
Activities Center at 10 p.m. to dis
cuss the group's plans for the
future.
