# Heavy rains penetrate Zapata's roof

### Nicole Harry 
Some students felt this weekend's
heavy rains indoors.
Sunday morning, water leaked into
Casa Zapata, affecting the lounge, as
well as one room on the first floor and
two rooms on the third.
"We heard it at 6:30 a.m. and put
something underneath to catch the
water," said sophomore Mhairi McKay,
Zapata resident. "But we were awak
ened again at eight when water began to
drip in the closet."

The water primarily affected
McKay's room, while there was some
minor damage to the lounge and the
third floor.
"It's odd to have a roof leak on the
first floor," said Peter Harvey, the man
ager of Housing and Dining Mainte
nance Services. "One would automati
cally assume that the major damage
from a roof leak would be on the top
floor."
Instead, water entered from the third
floor, trickled down a drainage pipe and
penetrated McKay's room, causing it to

smell. As a result, she and her room
mate, Andrea Baxter, were evacuated
and are currently staying in a guest
room.
"Fortunately, we heard it early
enough so that nothing got terribly
soaked," besides a few disks and comput
er boxes, Baxter said.
According to Cesar Cervantes, facili
ties supervisor at Stern Hall, mainte
nance was able to put a temporary in
dustrial-strength plastic patch over the
leak. The maintenance crew,
however, must wait until there
are four continuous days of good
weather before they can make
more permanent repairs, he said.
With rain forecasted for the
next few days, such repairs could
be delayed. Both McKay and Bax
ter said they are concerned that a
similar incident will occur every
time it rains.
While Harvey said mainte
nance is hopeful there won't be
extensive rain, he said they are
optimistic that the patches will
work.
Others, however, expressed
concern. "It's scary to think
we're fighting against nature,"
said senior Sally Matlin, Zapata
theme associate. But she added,
"It's nice to hear that people
care. We talked to Cesar Cer
vantes and he said he's sorry it
couldn't have been fixed sooner."
This weekend's leak isn't the
only incident in recent Zapata's
history. Last year Zapata experi
enced minor damage from a leak
as well.
Four other students said that
wet patches have been growing
on their carpets as result of leaks.
"If you close the door the
smell builds up and hits you,"
said freshman Krizan Livic, Zap
ata resident.
Today, maintenance will be
replacing at least five carpets and
conducting room inspections of
the entire dorm.
"I'm not expecting any more
damage," Cervantes said. "But
we want to make sure so we
won't have to inconvenience the
students further."
To prevent future problems,
maintenance will replace the
twenty-year-old roof when Stern
is renovated next summer under
the $110-million capitol
improvement plan.
While residents said they are
grateful for the temporary mea
sures being taken to remedy the
situation, they expressed disap
pointment at having to wait for
permanent repairs.
"It's frustrating that a budget
can't take into account all of the
unforeseen problems," Matlin
said.
