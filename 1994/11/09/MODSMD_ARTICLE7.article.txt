# Freelancing Foster grows roots on Farm
## 
### Karen Heywood Staff writer 
After a nomadic upbringing and
a motley, 18-year journalistic ca
reer, new Stanford News Service
Director Douglas Foster is finally
putting down roots at the place he
once called home.
The son of a former doctoral
student and world-traveler, Fos
ter, 41, spent one year of childhood
in Escondido Village, interspersed
with several-year stays in Taiwan,
West Africa, Brazil and locations
throughout the United States.
Foster — former editor and
publisher of the liberal Mother

Jones magazine — said the diversi
ty of his childhood surroundings
spawned his interest in journalism,
an interest that ultimately led him
back to the Farm.
"By the time I was in 11th grade
I'd been in 10 schools," Foster said.
"The first thing I'd do when dad
came home and said 'What do you
think about moving to West
Africa?' would be to go to the li
brary and get some magazine arti
cles about where we were going —
so I think that's got to be the part of
the backdrop that got me interest
ed in doing [journalism] from the

the publications
to which he
contributed arti

years as a free
lance reporter.

Bobby Lee — Daily
beginning."
Foster — whose duties at the
News Service include managing a
16-member staff, producing the
weekly Campus Report and bi
monthly Stanford Observer, and
providing press releases and infor
mation services to off-campus
media — is enthusiastic about his
two-month-old position.
"The News Service is primarily
intended to be a bridge for faculty
members to talk to each other and
talk to the outside world.. Fos
ter said, adding that he especially
enjoys "the kinds of exciting peo
ple I've met here (and) have the
opportunity to do work with — to
cover, report on and help project
their voices in the outside world."

Although News Service is fast
paced — "there's the daily work,
the weekly work, and the bi
monthly work" — Foster said he
appreciates the community aspect
of working in the University set
ting.
"It's more human and less fre
netic than, say, a newsroom in
Washington, D.C.," he said,
adding that Stanford's environ
ment is conducive to digging deep
er and getting more personal than
in other media outlets.
Foster's experience qualifies
this comparison. Since holding the
post of managing editor for his
college newspaper at University of
California at Santa Cruz, he has
held jobs in both print media and
television.
His past positions include two
years of general assignment
reporting for the daily Salinas Cal
ifornian, magazine and television

work at San Francisco's Center
for Investigative Reporting, devel
oping story ideas for CBS's "60
Minutes," making documentaries
and pieces for"The MacNeil-
Lehrer News Hour" as well as his
work for the San Francisco-based
Mother Jones magazine.
After more than five years of
editing at Mother Jones, Foster
left the left-wing magazine in
1992 to "go back to some of my
own writing," he said. He free
lanced for a year, contributing to
such publications as Rolling
Stone, Harper's, The New York
Times and The Los Angeles Times
before returning to Stanford as a
John S. Knight Fellow last year.
The News Service opening
came up at the tail end of the fel
lowship, Foster said. "Someone in
the [Knight program! knew the
job was open and thought I might
be good at it,"he said.

Foster commented that
because his memories of living at
Stanford as a child are vague, his
return to the University "feels

'There are times
when more of an
honest-broker
role ... makes more
sense.'
— Doug Foster

more like a continuation of my
exploration of Stanford that I
began as a Knight Fellow" than a
homecoming.
These days, Foster has trans
planted himself from his former
East Bay home to live on-campus,

a mile-and-a-half from the News
Service office.
Although he has yet to
encounter many middle-of-the
night fast-breaking stories, "I
decided that I really needed to be
close [to campus] in order to do
the job well, I had to learn the
community, and had to be
around," he said.
And while he says working on
politically-motivated projects like
Mother Jones was a "tremendous
charge," Foster feels ready to set
tle down for the time being.
"There are different times in a
person's life where a kind of cru
sading spirit both fields what you
feel and where you are political
ly," Foster said, "But there are
other times when more of an hon
est-broker role that involves a
larger spectrum makes more
sense, and that's the period I'm in
now."
