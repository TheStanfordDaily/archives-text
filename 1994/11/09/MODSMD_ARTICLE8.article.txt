# Remembering 'broken glass'
## Survivor recalls Nazi atrocities 
### Kiran Srinivas 
Yesterday evening, on the eve of the 56th anniver
sary of Kristallnacht, Holocaust survivor and Bay Area
resident Evelyn Fielden described her terror-filled days
in Germany to a group of about 40 students in Otero
Lounge.
Even though both of Fielden's parents were Jewish,
they had baptized her in the Lutheran faith in the
hopes that she would live a normal life in Germany.
Fielden, who was born in Berlin in 1921, said she did
not enjoy her childhood. "The German upbringing is
very rigid. It was too strict, and I was never too happy
about being a German, to be honest," she said.
"I didn't know any Jews while growing up. I didn't
even know my parents were Jews. My parents wanted
me to grow up in a Christian environment," she said.
In 1933, when Fielden was only 12, Hitler came to
power. At the time, still unaware of her Jewish back
ground, she desperately wanted to leave the country be
cause she hated the German lifestyle. Learning that
both her parents were Jewish further added to her de
sire to escape from Germany.
On Nov. 9,1938, the night of Kristallnacht — com
monly known as the "night of broken glass" — the
Nazis secretly burned down all of the synagogues in
Germany. Fielden, then only 16 years old, still vividly
remembers the appalling scene.
"I went outside and suddenly I saw all these build
ings on fire. I didn't realize they were all synagogues,"
she said. "I didn't even know what a synagogue was."
After that night, Fielden said she and her sister de
cided to leave for the United States. Realizing the im
migration process would take years, she and her sister
went to England to wait in a land
free from Nazi rule.
In 1944, Fielden and her sister
finally arrived in the United
States. By then, her parents had
settled in San Francisco, and
shortly thereafter her family was
reunited.
While her husband, a member
of the U.S. army, was stationed in
Germany and Austria during the
late 1940s and 50s, Fielden
returned to Europe with him. She
said that during her stay in Ger
many, she longed to return to the
United States.
Growing up in Germany has
made her very wary of all politics
today, she said. "That chapter [of
very sad history] is over, but it
seems new chapters are starting
all the time."
Most of the students at the lec
ture were impressed by Fielden's
story.
"It definitely makes me realize
how little I've experienced," said
freshman Jeff Hindman. "Com
pared to her, I've lived a very shel
tered life."
By learning about the Holo
caust, hopefully society will pre
vent it from happening again, he
said. "It's important to have these
type of lectures to educate people."
