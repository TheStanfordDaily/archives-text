Pavid Holloway
Stalin & the Bomb:
The Soviet Union and Atomic Energy, 1939-1956
(Yale University Press, $30.00)
For forty years the Soviet-American
nuclear arms race dominated world politics,
yet the Soviet nuclear establishment was
shrouded in secrecy. This spellbinding book
answers questions that have intrigued policymak
ers and the public for years by tracing the histo
ry of Soviet nuclear policy. This history throws
light on Soviet policy at the height of the Cold
War, illuminates a central but hitherto secret ele
ment of the Stalinist system, and puts into per
spective the tragic legacy of this program today
environmental damage, a network of secret
cities, and a huge stockpile of unwanted
weapons.
David Holloway is professor of political sci
ence and co-director of the Center for
International Security and Arms Control at Stanford.
This event will be held at the Bookstore on campus.
