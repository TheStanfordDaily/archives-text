Making a bequest to the
American 1 leart Association
says something special about
you. It's a gift of health for
future generations — an
unselfish act of caring.
Your gift will fund research
and educational programs to
fight heart attack, stroke,
high blood pressure and other
cardiovascular diseases. And
bring others the joy and
freedom of good health.
To learn more about how
you can leave a legacy for the
future, call 1-800-AHA-USAI
