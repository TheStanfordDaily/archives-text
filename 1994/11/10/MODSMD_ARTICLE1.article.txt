# More defense spending?
## University wary about research funding's future under Republican congress 
### Tristan Sorah Reyes 
The Republican sweep of both houses of
Congress has University officials hopeful but
cautious about increased federal funds for re
search programs.
While some are optimistic that Republican
control of Congress will shower additional de
fense funds on research universities, others
predict that any increased defense spending
will go directly into the military.
"There is a lot that has yet to happen be
fore we can see exactly what is going to
occur," said Larry Horton, associate vice
provost for the Office of Public Affairs.
"It is a guess that Republicans will be more

likely to fund that particular spending (de
fense) than the Democrats," said Political
Science Prof. David Brady.
Increased spending on national defense
could be a positive aspect for the University if
the money goes to fund research. Research
currently accounts for 23 percent of Stan
ford's budget, and 15 percent of that money
comes from the Defense Department.
But University President Gerhard Casper
said he believes it will be even harder now
than before for Stanford to get federal re
search funds.
Even if defense spending is increased, he
said, more defense spending may not go to re
search programs for universities but to actu

al strengthening of the military. It doesn't
help that for most members of Congress, uni
versities don't rank very high on their list of
priorities, Casper added.
This summer, the U.S. House of Represen
tatives voted to cut the amount of defense ap
propriation funds going to research universi
ties by $900 million — half of the budget at
that time — diverting the funds to areas such
as strengthening military readiness and im
proving living and working conditions in mil
itary units.
In its own version of the appropriations
bill, the U.S. Senate cut only $82 million. A
congressional conference later
settled on a cut of $200 million in
defense funding to university
research.
"The next few years will proba
bly be even tougher than we had
expected them to be," Casper said.
"It is fair to say that, to the
extent to which the voters have
sent the message to Washington,
that is being interpreted as a mes
sage against big government,"
Casper said. "That means that
Washington will become even
more tight-fisted then they have
been when it comes to spending."
Horton said that the Universi
ty still isn t sure exactly how the

proposed defense appropriations
cuts will be made. The controlling
party will have a difficult job of
allocating resources, since there is
never enough, he said. How the
resources will be allocated has yet
to be determined.
With the new tide of Republi
cans flowing into the House and
Senate, the appropriations bill's
future effects on Stanford are
even more uncertain.
"The Republicans will proba
bly slow down the degree of cuts
that the Clinton administration
proposed," said Martin Anderson,
a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution. "If you compare
things that would have been to
what they will be now that the
Republicans are in control, there
now might be more money for the
Defense Department and there

fore also for research," he said.
The Associated Press reported
yesterday that the Republicans in
the Senate and those in the House
have promised to roll back
defense cuts, adding that Republi
can Rep. Newt Gingrich of Geor
gia — the likely candidate for
speaker of the house next term —
has also promised higher defense
spending.
But Horton emphasized that
who is in office is of limited
importance to the University. "All
issues that Stanford is concerned
with are non-partisan," he said.
"Issues such as education, stu
dent aid, and research are highly
valued by both parties," Horton
added. "So Stanford will continue
to work with whatever party is in
power just as we have done in the
past."
