# More defense spending?
## University wary about research funding's future under Republican congress

The Republican sweep of both houses of
Congress has University officials hopeful but
cautious about increased federal funds for re
search programs.
While some are optimistic that Republican
control of Congress will shower additional de
fense funds on research universities, others
predict that any increased defense spending
will go directly into the military.
"There is a lot that has yet to happen be
fore we can see exactly what is going to
occur," said Larry Horton, associate vice
provost for the Office of Public Affairs.
"It is a guess that Republicans will be more

likely to fund that particular spending (de
fense) than the Democrats," said Political

Increased spending on national defense
could be a positive aspect for the University if
the money goes to fund research. Research
currently accounts for 23 percent of Stan
ford's budget, and 15 percent of that money
comes from the Defense Department.
But University President Gerhard Casper
said he believes it will be even harder now
than before for Stanford to get federal re
search funds.
Even if defense spending is increased, he
said, more defense spending may not go to re
search programs for universities but to actu

al strengthening of the military. It doesn't
help that for most members of Congress, uni
versities don't rank very high on their list of
priorities, Casper added.
This summer, the U.S. House of Represen
tatives voted to cut the amount of defense ap
propriation funds going to research universi
ties by $900 million — half of the budget at
that time — diverting the funds to areas such
as strengthening military readiness and im
proving living and working conditions in mil
itary units.
In its own version of the appropriations
bill, the U.S. Senate cut only $82 million. A
