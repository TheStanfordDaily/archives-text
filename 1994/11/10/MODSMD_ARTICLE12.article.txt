## GOP wastes no time readying agenda 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In
charge and eager to begin, lead
ers of the new Republican
majorities in the House and
Senate sketched a conservative
agenda yesterday including a
balanced budget amendment
and term limits for lawmakers.
A tax cut, welfare reform,
crime legislation and health
reform also are likely to be
addressed in the 104 th Congress
— the first under GOP control
since the Eisenhower era.
Senate Republican leader Bob
Dole and Rep. Newt Gingrich,
House speaker-in-waiting,
pledged cooperation with Presi
dent Clinton wherever possible.
"Maybe we can do some busi
ness," Dole told the president in
a phone conversation witnessed

by reporters.
Beyond that, Gingrich said in
an interview that he and the
president talked by telephone
about being able to "disagree
with reasonableness where we
disagree."
Clinton also pledged to
"reach out" to Republican lead
ers and urged them to "join me
in the center of the public
debate. . ." He hinted broadly
that he would favor a tax cut
next year, and also called for a
measure to strengthen his hand
at cutting spending unilaterally.
For now, Republicans exulted
in midterm elections that
changed the face of government,
leaving them with control of the
House for the first time in 40
years, and producing a 53-47

edge in the Senate. That includ
ed Sen. Richard Shelby of Alaba
ma, a Democrat who switched to
the GOP as Republican aides
cheered profusely at a Capitol
Hill news conference.
Gingrich said Republicans
would move ahead — as
promised — on its campaign
"Contract with America"in the
first 100 days of the 104 th Con
grss, which convenes in January.
In the House, the first-day
agenda will include legislation
to place Congress under the
same federal laws that apply to
the rest of the country, deeply
cut congressional staffing levels,
reduce the number of commit
tees and subcommittees and
implement term limits for com
mittee chairmen.

Over the next 99 days, Gin
grich and Republicans have
pledged to bring several major
bills to the floor for a vote.
These include two constitution
al amendments, one to balance
the budget and one to impose
term limits on lawmakers.
Other proposals include a $500-
per-child tax credit, with accom
panying spending cuts to keep
the deficit from rising, welfare
reform, a crime bill, a capital
gains tax cut, protecting the
Pentagon's budget and other
measures.
Clinton said, however, he
would not "compromise on my
convictions," and the Republi
can majorities are well shy of
the two-thirds that would be
needed to override any vetoes.
