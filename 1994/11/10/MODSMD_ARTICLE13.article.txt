Violence erupts
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP)
— Tens of thousands of police
and soldiers were stationed
throughout Sri Lanka for yes
terday's presidential election,
but at least five people died in
dozens of clashes, a bloody end
to a race thrown into turmoil by
political violence.
Heavily favored to win the
race was Prime Minister Chan
drika Kumaratunga, whose
socialist People's Alliance won
parliamentary elections three
months ago after promising to
open talks with Tamil rebels.
Victory for Mrs. Kumaratun
ga would be a mandate to push
ahead with the talks, suspended
after her main opponent, Gami
ni Dissanayake, was killed at an
Oct. 24 election rally by a sui
cide bomber believed to be a
Tamil rebel.
Fifty-six other people also died.
Dissanavake's widow, Srima,

replaced him, but she failed to
generate a wide sympathy vote.

sidents from Iraqi leader Sad
dam Hussein.
The air raid was the first
this year on Iranian opposition
bases in Iraq, but there have
