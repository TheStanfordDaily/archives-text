# Next step for controversial law
## Prop 187 struggle moves into courts 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Immi
gration activists swept into court
yesterday, charging that a new
law which denies education and
most health care to illegal immi
grants also violates basic civil
rights.
One judge immediately barred
enforcement of the sections of
Proposition 187 that would expel
undocumented immigrants from
California public secondary
schools and its public colleges and
universities.
San Francisco Superior Court
Judge Stuart Pollak noted that
the ballot measure conflicts with a
1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling
that requires states to provide a
public education to all residents.
Voters' endorsement of Propo
sition 187, closely watched from
Washington to Mexico City,
touched off small protests in
Northern California and focused a
glaring spotlight on the center
stage immigration now commands
in America. The United States, a
beacon to migrants for more than
a century, now shares the strug
gles of other nations faced with
mass migrations across borders.
Proposition 187 supporters
hope to take their successful cam
paign to other states, including
Texas. But Hispanic activists
insist the racial and economic
fears that motivated California
voters are unique to this reces
sion-hit state.
"It's opened up enormous
wounds that are going to take a
long time to heal," said Cecilia
Munoz of the National Council of
La Raza, a moderate Hispanic
advocacy group in Washington.
"Clearly, there are people out
there who And the growth of the
Latino population in America and
in California very threatening."
But, Munoz added: "Texas and

other states don't have the same
type of recession, and the same
type of backlash, that California
has seen."
Gary Mounce, a University of
Texas-Pan American political sci
entist, agreed it will be less of an
issue there: "Those politics of hate
or immigrant bashing, you find it
here, but I don't think the major
politicians are lending any cre
dence to it."
In this city shaken by racial
rioting just three years ago over
verdicts in the Rodney King beat
ing case, police braced for student
protests. High school and middle
school students briefly shut down
highways in three Northern Cali
fornia spots early yesterday.
Proposition 187 supporters
insist their agenda is not racist,
but economic, bearing a message
that Californians are fed up with
spending scarce state tax dollars
on people who don't belong here.
Republican U.S. Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher lashed out at oppo
nents of Proposition 187 who
complained about the measure's
purported racism and called him
"a racist skinhead." He said the
measure should send a message to
poor people worldwide that the
United States cannot help every
one.
"I think the word's going to get
out that we will turn this tide in a
very kind way, but a very forceful
way," Rohrabacher said.
Gov. Pete Wilson ordered state
departments to begin drawing up
emergency guidelines to implement
Proposition 187, but cautioned
health care and other social service
providers to wait for the guidelines
before turning people away.
Much of the new law was in
limbo anyway as civil rights
groups rushed into federal and
state courts with challenges.
