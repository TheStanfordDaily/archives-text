## Turn on and tune in

About three months
ago, many Stanford students
and their peers looked at poli
tics with cynicism, if they bothered
to look at all.
But something magical happened.
Galvanized in part by the attention
surrounding Proposition 187, stu
dent energy became intense. And on
election day, the youngest demo
graphic group of voters defied con
ventional wisdom and voted in large
numbers.
Looking back, however, some may
feel their first instincts were right.
Voters aged 18-29 (and Stanford stu
dents in particular) roundly opposed
Governor Wilson and Prop. 187, and
yet older voters overwhelmingly
endorsed both. Does this mean that
young people and their votes meant
or did nothing? Absolutely not.
While the election results indicate
the Democratic party's weakness

and California's xenophobic fears,
they were in no way a message to
drop out. In fact, they were a wake
up call.
Specifically, it appears that Dianne
Feinstein will be returning to Wash
ington thanks in part to younger vot
ers. Similarly, this contingency
helped stop the tobacco industry's
backdoor ploy by opposing Prop. 187.
Such cohesion is critical, and
speaks to a much larger issue. Young
voters must not forget that their
efforts netted results and that the
only way to achieve greater results is
with greater efforts. Both enthusi
asm and apathy are highly conta
gious, yet only one is a sickness.
If young voters maintain their
newfound political energy, the estab
lishment will have no choice but to
take them seriously. Younger stu
dents can, and indeed did, impact the
process. Don't stop now.
