# Three-year planning

### 
The three-year degree option
appeared to be a novel, perhaps even
revolutionary concept when Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper sug
gested it for Stanford two years ago.
But just last year, 45 students
graduated early — up from 23 in
1992. And 21 percent of graduates
from 1991 to 1993 earned 180 units
by the end of their third year.
With numbers like these, it's
clear that the three-year degree
option is not such a distant idea.
And this is something Stanford
must reckon with seriously.
More students are opting for the
fast track — with or without a for
malized program. So it is up to the
University to keep up.
This means offering adequate
information, advice and support,
even if it does not implement ah
actual three-year degree program.
The Commission on Undergradu
ate Education recommended that
students be made aware of the early
graduation option, which is a good

first step.
But the University needs to go
beyond this, and help students get
the most out of their fewer-than
four-year Stanford experience. For
example, at Harvard University,
advanced freshmen actually receive
information booklets on how to fin
ish in three years.
Though some think that three
years is a bit hasty, others think it
just makes sense. More students are
coming in with more Advanced
Placement credits. Tuition is rising.
At least one of these things will
never change.
Considering these realities, the
University needs to do what it can to
prepare itself and its students for
what seem to be growing trends:
lean economic conditions every
where and fast-track graduations
here at Stanford.
Because three-year graduates
may be going away — quickly. But
three-year graduations are definite
ly not.
