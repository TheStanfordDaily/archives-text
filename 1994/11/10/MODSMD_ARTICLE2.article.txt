# Students continue fighting Prop. 187
## 
### Crystal Carreon Contributing writer 
As the rain continued to fall, a
group of students gathered yes
terday in White Plaza to voice
their concerns, anger and sadness
over the passage of Proposition
187 in Tuesday's elections.
The residence staff at Casa Za
pata organized the gathering,
which drew a multi-ethnic crowd
of approximately 65 students de
spite the bad weather.
Senior Dave Valle, a Zapata
resident who helped organize the
event, said that it was meant to
provide a public forum where stu
dents could address the implica
tions of the new legislation. Valle
said he felt students seemed to
"look the other way" and ignore
the "bigger issue" of Proposition
187 as it passed into law.
"I hope this provokes people to
think about what this means," he
said moments before the event
began.
Proposition 187, which passed
with 59 percent of the vote, will
deny suspected illegal aliens ac
cess to public health care, social
services and public education. It is
estimated that 300,000 students
will be suspended from California
schools due to their immigration
status when the measure goes

into effect.
Students at the gathering said
they will continue to fight Propo
sition 187 and other mandated
methods of discrimination.
"This isn't the end," said se
nior Javier Ruiz, a resident assis
tant at Zapata. "The one key word
is unity. We had unity last year
during the hunger strike. We need
to unite again to keep this from
being [implemented]."
The gathering in White Plaza
was one of many post-election at
tempts throughout the state to
protest the passage of the proposi
tion and raise awareness about its
implications.
Yesterday morning, the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union filed a
lawsuit in U.S. Federal District
Court and was granted a restrain
ing order to block the implemen
tation of the law.
Although Proposition 187 is
currently tied up in litigation,
Valle said that this alone should
not stem student efforts to protest
the legislation.
"Regardless [of this lawsuit],
the sentiment is there which
passed such a law and this is what
we need to fight against — the
racist sentiment," he said.

ilar concerns in a letter.
"The Proposition wasn't just
mean-spirited. It was downright
ugly and racist," Valle read of the
letter. "It's not aimed at the mil
lions of undocumented English,
French, Germans, Belgians,
Spaniards, Swedes, Italians, East
Europeans, Australians, South
Africans and other Europeans who
have outstayed their visas. "

Burciaga, In his letter, also stat
ed that the law is not solely about
attacking illegal immigration.
"Proposition 187 is no differ
ent than the repatriation program
when Mexicans and Mexican
Americans were blamed for the
Depression and over 700,000 ...
were deported back to Mexico,"
the letter said. "If it's about immi
gration, then we should realize
that we are all immigrants, here
on earth for only an instant and
then gone for all eternity."
Senior Francisco Valdiosera
said that Proposition 187 does

not have "a lot to do with the
issue of illegal immigration." In
the campaign commercials, "they
just showed Mexicans crossing
the border, Mexicans running
across the freeways," he said.
Valdiosera, who emigrated
from Mexico when he was five
years old, said the law is similar
to what Hitler attempted to do
in Nazi Germany — mainly to
get rid of those who did not
belong.
"It really hurts," Valdiosera
said. "It really hurts to come to a
country where I am not wanted."
