## Understanding your TA 
### 
THE PROBLEM WITH TAs is that
they don't speak the same lan
guage that their students write in.
You ask questions in English and they
answer in jargon.
Think back to the care-free days of
Great Works when Mr. I'm-on-page
-402-of-my-doctoral-thesis would twirl
your world around with the various olo
gies and isms that were supposed to help
you remember how to spell Gilgamesh.
All your fellow ex-valedictorians would
smile and nod and agree, hoping to
Dante's heaven that no one would figure
out that they didn't know what "post
structuralism" really meant.
Something in that transition from
under to graduate breeds an insecurity
in those section-leaders — a fear that,
even after all their years in school,
someone else in the room might come off
sounding more intelligent.
Since TAs don't know enough people
to name drop, they use big words to
compensate. Sooner or later, some of the
pre-meds in your section pick up on
them, look them up at home, and then
raise their status by throwing them
around as if everyone reads Hegel in
high school.
The problem is that no one knows
what these people are babbling about.
It's a lexicon comprised of words we
see all the time and we all know how to
spell, but we just don't know how to use
in a sentence. (The highest brow is not
always the best understood.) It's a self

perpetuating academic vocabulary
unfortunately used by the same individ
uals you have to speak to if you want an
extension.
The following is an abbreviated list of
practical definitions (they've worked for
me) of words often used by or associated
with your TA:
Bourgeoisie — The bad guys.
Deconstruct — To make obvious.
Discourse — A five unit DR (as
opposed to dat course).
Epistemological — Theories which
speculate as to how we know what words
like epistemological means. Wondering
why you wonder.
Etymology — Looking back to the
ancient Greek or Latin roots of a word
for insight into what modern writers
mean when they use it.
Exactly — The proper response to any
thing you don't understand.
Exegesis — Overanalysis to the point
of nausea (see Shpiel).
Freudian — It turned me on.
Hierarchical — I'm cooler than you
are.
Hubris — What makes you suck more
than the person to your left.
Ideology — What US believes that
THEY believe.
Marxism — The philosophical school
which argues that if everyone had noth
ing then no one would need anything.
Methodology — How you go about
screwing something up.

Modernism/Postmodernism — Any
thing which does not fall into a more
recognizable category. Used freely and
interchangeably.
Multidisciplinary — You'll read this
again in psych 1.
Ontological — Theories which specu
late whether our beings exist enough to
know what ontological means. Wonder
ing if you wonder.
Organizational — The type of prob
lem your paper possesses, as expressed
by your TA, when no other apparent jus
tifications exist for giving it a B.
Pedantic — The graduate student's
most common form of expression.
Proletariat — The good guys.
Rhetoric — What we already knew
before you said it again.
Society — The source of all trouble, the
direction of all blame, and a shmancy
way of saying, "bunch of people hanging
out."
So next time Captain CIV says, "After
deconstructing your exegesis on Marx
ism I must say that your modernist ide
ology was rather rhetorical in its ontolo
gy," don't hide behind your Oxford Dic
tionary — smack him with it.
