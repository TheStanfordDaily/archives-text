Defense of paid advertisement was equally baseless

MR. GREWAL, WHO claims to be a
champion of facts, is guilty of
complete disdain for facts in his
Nov. 4 letter to The Daily. I could have
sent him a personal letter but decided
against it because he chose to slander
India, distort facts and spread lies in a
public forum.
As an Indian, let me first acknowledge
the existence of human rights violations
in India. There probably isn't a single
nation combatting terrorism today that
isn't guilty of human rights violations.
With regard to Mrs. Gandhi's assassina
tion, Mr. Grewal states, "I am not condon
ing such actions, but as I am a practicing
Sikh and understand the Sikh mentality, I
can understand why it occurred. So in
actuality, Beant Singh and Satwant
Singh, the freedom fighters involved in
Indira Gandhi's death, were martyrs."
I could use Mr. Grewal's flawed logic in
much the same way to justify the Indian
Government's human rights violations
and say, "I am not condoning the human
rights violations, but as I am an Indian
and understand the Indian mentality, I
can understand why they have occurred.
So, in actuality, the Indian army and
para-military forces, the defenders of the
public good involved in violence, are patri
ots."
I could also quote from a recent report
of the Human Rights Watch/Asia (Indir:
Arms and Abuses in Indian Punjab and
Kashmir, Sept. 1994): "Sikh militants reg

ularly engaged in a pattern of serious vio
lations of humanitarian law. Most of these
violations involved deliberate attacks on
unarmed civilians. These took a variety of
forms: random assaults on civilians; tar
geted killings of Hindu civilians and Sikh
civilians suspected of collaboration with
the Indian government; and assassina
tions of political figures and Hindu reli
gious leaders."
After citing further instances like
extortion of money from local business
men and the threatening of journalists,
the report continues, "militant groups
deliberately directed attacks against civil
ians in public areas, shooting randomly,
for example, through crowded market
places, in residential districts, and on con
gested streets. These attacks apparently
were designed to cause extensive civilian
casualties, and induce general terror
among the civilian population, in clear vio
lation of all international norms."
I would rather not indulge in a petty,
child-like argument of "you first." So,
unlike the people who wrote the paid
advertisement which ran in the Nov. 1 edi
tion of The Daily, let me paraphrase Gand
hi in a way that is true to his non-violent
beliefs: "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for
a tooth. And the whole world will go
blind." Keeping that in mind, I, and other
like-minded Indians, continue to strive for
an examination of human rights viola
tions, rather than justifying them as being
the "predictable result" of the depraved

politics of militant Sikh terrorists.
I thank Mr. Grewal for reinforcing a
point I made in my Nov. 4 letter to The
Daily. In my letter I aver, "The advertis
ers — like other sponsors of terrorist vio
lence — probably have little or no direct
connection to the people or land they
claim to support." Mr. Grewal, in the lat
ter half of his letter, displays his complete
ignorance of India, her history and her
Constitution.
He claims Punjabi, the language of the
Sikhs, is "not recognized in the Indian
Constitution while numerous Hindi
dialects" are. Does he choose to lie
because he thinks the emotion of his letter
gives him the right to gloss over facts?
Punjabi is indeed recognized by the Indian
Constitution. English and Hindi are the
official languages for communication
among the governments of the various
states and the federal government, while
thirteen other languages, including Pun
jabi, are also recognized under the Indian
Constitution.
He then implies "the southernmost
state of Tamil" would like to secede from
India. Mr. Grewal, here is a fact: Tamil is
not and never has been a state in India. If
you are referring to the state of Tamil
Nadu, let me tell you this: after the early
1960'8, they have shown no desire to be
independent. Yes, they refuse to speak
Hindi because it is an Indo-Aryan lan
guage and the residents of Tamil Nadu,
who are of Dravidian origin, prefer to

speak Tamil, an Indo-Dravidian language.
Tamil has one of the oldest and richest
bodies of literature — rivaled only by that
of Sanskrit — and the Tamilians have a
great deal of pride in their language. In
1965, the year the writers of the Indian
Constitution had picked for phasing out
English as an official language, the Tamil
ians protested the imposition of Hindi
upon Southern India. They led a success
ful agitation — one that did not leave
thousands of innocent people dead or
maimed — that resulted in English being
retained in the Indian Constitution.
Here is another point that Mr. Grewal
tosses out as purported truth: "Since Oct.
31,1984, Puiyab has been under military
rule and has not had full elections." Here,
Mr. Grewal, is another one of those pesky
facts: Punjab had parliamentary elections
in 1989 and there has been another elec
tion since. Punjab has a democratically
elected state government, with elected
members in both the upper and lower
houses of parliament.
I really have no desire to bore readers
with more facts, but I would suggest Mr.
Grewal pay heed to some of these facts
before he slanders India. I make this sug
gestion not out of selfish, blind pride in
my country, but because I think we stand
to gain more from an educated discussion
of facts than from an emotional outburst
of blatant lies.
