# Kimball voting list a violation of privacy
## 
### 
Yesterday I voted for the first time in my
life. Sure, it was nice to be able to make some
political impact, but something was serious
ly disturbing about the polling location.
On the main door of Kimball Hall, there
was a list containing the names of everyone
registered to vote in the hall. Next to the

names were the residences of the voters and
finally their party affiliations. I do not know
whether similar lists were placed on the out
sides of the doors of other polling stations at
Stanford.
When did personal party affiliations
become publicly available? I explicitly
remember a statement of privacy on the vot
ing registration form. This privacy was vio
lated by the list at the Kimball voting station.
