The Daily welcomes letters from its readers. Letters will be published at the
editor's discretion and are subject to editing. All letters must include the author's
name, phone number and Stanford affiliation, if any. Disks should have the
owner's name written clearly on the front and may be picked up two business days
after they have been dropped off.
