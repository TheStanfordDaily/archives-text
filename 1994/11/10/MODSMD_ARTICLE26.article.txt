The No. 1-ranked Stanford men's golf team faces a
demanding test this weekend as it travels cross-coun
try to play in the Golf World/Palmetto Dunes Colle
giate Tournament in Hilton Head, S.C.
The Cardinal, on top of both the Wilson Coaches'
and the Golf World polls, is trying for its third victory
in four tournaments. After this weekend, the team
will take somewhat of a winter break, playing only two
tournaments until its hectic spring schedule begins in
March.
"This should be a nice way to end our fall tourna
ment schedule," said head coach Wally Goodwin. "The
competition should be tough and it will give us a
chance to play many of the teams that we may see

again later in the year."
Indeed, the field at Hilton Head should prove to be
as much as the Cardinal can handle. Among the
schools represented will be eight of the nine teams
ranked behind Stanford in the Golf World top 10,
including No. 2 Oklahoma State and No. 7 Arizona
State, who combined have taken the tournament title
five of the past eight years. Also playing will be No. 3
Nevada-Las Vegas, the only team to defeat the Cardi
nal since the Tucker Invitational at New Mexico early
in September.
Senior Ail-American Notah Begay reigns as the
defending champion, after shooting 14 under par for a
three-day total 0f202. The score ranked as the second
lowest in the history of the Golf World/Palmetto
Dunes tournament. Begay however, is paying little
regard to the pressures of repeating.
"Winning last year was great," Begay said, "but I
just have to concentrate on playing well this weekend
and making a contribution to the team's perfor
mance."
This year's competition for the individual title looks
to be as fierce as the race for the team title. The field
includes eight returning first-team All-Americans and
four World Amateur Team competitors. Among the
notables are Todd Dempsy, the defending NCAA
champion, Alan Bratton, the co-recipient of the 1994
Nicklaus Award as the top collegian, and Trip Kuehne,
the U.S. Amateur runner-up to Stanford freshman
Tiger Woods. Woods will also vie for Begay's title.
The expectations for the team remain high after it
ran away with the team title in the Jerry Pate Invita
tional in Birmingham, Ala The Cardinal destroyed
the field with a team score of 846, 27 strokes ahead of
the nearest competitor. Individually, Stanford golfers
took top honors as Woods captured the title and senior
Ail-American Will Yanagisawa finished second by two
strokes.
"A lot of people will be expecting us to play well
after dominating at [Birmingham]," said All-Ameri
can Steve Burdick. "We demand a lot of ourselves as
well, but we just have to relax and concentrate on the
game and not the expectations."
"There is a big difference in our expectations and
expectancies," Goodwin said. "My expectancies are
that we will drive well, putt well, and chip well; this is
a great team. However, my expectations are different
because of the factor of luck.... I'm not sure about
how much luck was involved in the win we had at
Birmingham because we just ran away with it.
"Regardless, whoever wins this tournament, there
will be luck involved. I just hope that at the end of the
weekend, we are in a position to have a shot at the
championship."
