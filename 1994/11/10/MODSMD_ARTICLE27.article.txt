# Tennis swings at Rolex
## Both teams face top competition 
### Courtney Mann Contributing writer 
A tidal wave of Cardinal will
sweep over the courts of North
ern California this weekend as
both the men's and women's
tennis teams step up to the net
in the Rolex Northern California
Men's Intercollegiate Tourna
ment held at California and the
Women's Rolex Regionals held
at St. Mary's College in Moraga.
Both of these tournaments
potentially lead to automatic
entry into the Rolex Individual
Indoor Championships held in
Dallas in February. The champi
on of this weekend's tourna
ments and the runner-up
receive unconditional entry. In
addition, a player must have
competed in this tournament in
order to achieve a wildcard berth
into the February tournament.
For the men's team however,
this tournament means signifi
cantly more than a mere qualify
ing competition. Before the
Rolex Qualifying Tournament
existed, this weekend's festivi
ties were held annually since
1947 to enhance tennis promi
nence of individuals and schools
in the Northern California area.
The competition continues
towards this aim despite its clas
sification as the Rolex qualifying
tournament.
The Stanford men's team has
additional desires to achieve
bragging rights among its local
colleagues. The Cardinal cur
rently owns those rights after
taking the crown last year and
for the last six years. In fact, Cal
ifornia's victory in 1979 was the
last time a team other than
Stanford captured this tourna
ment (a team champion was not

awarded in 1987).
The Cardinal is presented
with an opportunity to continue
its dominance as it will enter six
players out of the team's eight
into the top 11 singles seeds:
junior Jeff Salzenstein (1),
freshman Scott Humphries (3),
freshman Paul Goldstein (4),
junior Jim Thomas (6), junior
Ricky Becker (10) and sopho
more Grant Elliot (11). Fresh
men Charles Hoeveler and
Misha Palecek round out the
rest of the Stanford lineup.
All but Hoeveler received
first round byes into the second
round. As last year's defending
singles champion, Thomas
brings a history of success with
him to the tournament.
"It's nice going into a tourna
ment knowing you've played
well there before," he said.
The doubles bracket seedings
show equal promise for Stan
ford. The doubles teams of
Humphries/Goldstein, Salzen
stein/Elliot and Thomas/Becker
placed into the first, fourth, and
seventh spots, thus sending
them straight into the second
round. Palecek and Hoeveler
will attempt to join the others
there with a first round victory
over John Devorss and Delbert
Rlodll of Oregon. Salzenstein
reigns as half of this tourna
ment's 1993 championship dou
bles team.
Men's head coach Dick Gould
believes the overall timing of the
tournament is favorable. "It's a
real good time for a tournament.
We're finishing up our sixth
week of practice, and we're look
ing good physically," he said.

"They feel a lot more comfort

Gould said. "It's a good time to
see how much from practice they
can put into effect this week

Stanford women's tennis sim
ilarly looks to do some signifi
cant damage in their Rolex
Regional Tournament. Featur
ing the top talent in the North
west, the singles bracket will
draw its champion from a pool of
64 and the doubles from a pool of
32. The Cardinal will enter eight
players into the singles competi
tion, translating into four teams
for doubles play.
As a tournament essentially
devoted to qualifying players for
the tournament in February, the
team eagerly seeks to gain expe
rience as well as a positive start
on the season.
"This is a good opportunity to
play in a lot of matches and beat
some other players up rather
than beating ourselves up," said
Brennan.
The women received as favor
able seedings as the men did.
The Cardinal will occupy spots
four through eight in the forms
of Katie Schlukebir, Kim Shas
by, Sandra De Silva, Ania
Bleszynski and Julie Scott,
respectively. The top three seeds
have been assigned to Vira
Vitels, Jennifer Poulos, and Pam
Nelson, all from Cal.
In doubles competition, the

women will team up Schlukebir
and Shasby, Bleszynski and Amy
Chiminello, Scott and Wendy
Sacks, and De Silva and Sophy
Woodhouse. This weekend
marks the first college competi
tion for freshmen Bleszynski,
Scott, and Woodhouse.
"I'm a little nervous just
because I haven't played a com
petitive match in a long time.
But I feel comfortable that prac
tice and my team has prepared
me well for the weekend,"
Bleszynski said.
Since the competition will be
the first of their collegiate
careers for three of the eight
participants, Brennan will look
to experienced seniors Chiminel
lo and Shasby to provide guid
ance for the rookies. The team
also will rely on the leadership of
AIl-American Schlukebir, the
only Stanford player to have
already competed this year.
"Katie's been out there
already, and she's a very mature
sophomore," the coach said. "I'd
like them [Schlukebir, Chiminel
lo, and Shasby] to show the oth
ers that they've been there
before."
Brennan also views the tour
nament as an immeasurable
opportunity to watch archrival
Cal in action. Although the Car
dinal squads will not square off
in team competition until
spring, Brennan has visions of
success against the Golden
Bears.
"They have the top three, but
we have the next five, and that's
still from the preseason rank
ings," Brennan said. "With our
depth, we may be able to beat
them by nipping them down the
line. Our goal is to beat the Wee
nies every time we play them."

already, and she's a very mature
sophomore," the coach said. "I'd
like them [Schlukebir, Chiminel
lo, and Shasby] to show the oth
ers that they've been there
before."
Brennan also views the tour
nament as an immeasurable
opportunity to watch archrival
Cal in action. Although the Car
dinal squads will not square off
in team competition until
spring, Brennan has visions of
success against the Golden
Bears.
"They have the top three, but
we have the next five, and that's
still from the preseason rank
ings," Brennan said. "With our
depth, we may be able to beat
them by nipping them down the
line. Our goal is to beat the Wee
nies every time we play them."

Junior Jeff Salzenstein and his killer swing will represent the Cardi

A tidal wave of Cardinal will
sweep over the courts of North
ern California this weekend as
both the men's and women's
tennis teams step up to the net
in the Rolex Northern California
Men's Intercollegiate Tourna
ment held at California and the
Women's Rolex Regionals held
at St. Mary's College in Moraga.
Both of these tournaments
potentially lead to automatic
entry into the Rolex Individual
Indoor Championships held in
Dallas in February. The champi
on of this weekend's tourna
ments and the runner-up
receive unconditional entry. In
addition, a player must have
competed in this tournament in
order to achieve a wildcard berth
into the February tournament.
For the men's team however,
this tournament means signifi
cantly more than a mere qualify
ing competition. Before the
Rolex Qualifying Tournament
existed, this weekend's festivi
ties were held annually since
1947 to enhance tennis promi
nence of individuals and schools
in the Northern California area.
The competition continues
towards this aim despite its clas
sification as the Rolex qualifying
tournament.
The Stanford men's team has
additional desires to achieve
bragging rights among its local
colleagues. The Cardinal cur
rently owns those rights after
taking the crown last year and
for the last six years. In fact, Cal
ifornia's victory in 1979 was the
last time a team other than
Stanford captured this tourna
ment (a team champion was not

awarded in 1987).
The Cardinal is presented
with an opportunity to continue
its dominance as it will enter six
players out of the team's eight
into the top 11 singles seeds:
junior Jeff Salzenstein (1),
freshman Scott Humphries (3),
freshman Paul Goldstein (4),
junior Jim Thomas (6), junior
Ricky Becker (10) and sopho
more Grant Elliot (11). Fresh
men Charles Hoeveler and
Misha Palecek round out the
rest of the Stanford lineup.
All but Hoeveler received
first round byes into the second
round. As last year's defending
singles champion, Thomas
brings a history of success with
him to the tournament.
"It's nice going into a tourna
ment knowing you've played
well there before," he said.
The doubles bracket seedings
show equal promise for Stan
ford. The doubles teams of
Humphries/Goldstein, Salzen
stein/Elliot and Thomas/Becker
placed into the first, fourth, and
seventh spots, thus sending
them straight into the second
round. Palecek and Hoeveler
will attempt to join the others
there with a first round victory
over John Devorss and Delbert
Rlodll of Oregon. Salzenstein
reigns as half of this tourna
ment's 1993 championship dou
bles team.
Men's head coach Dick Gould
believes the overall timing of the
tournament is favorable. "It's a
real good time for a tournament.
We're finishing up our sixth
week of practice, and we're look
ing good physically," he said.

tition to the Indoor Tennis Asso

ciation's All-American Tourna

days after practiced started.
"They feel a lot more comfort
able than they did in Texas,"
Gould said. "It's a good time to
see how much from practice they
can put into effect this week
end."
Stanford women's tennis sim
ilarly looks to do some signifi
cant damage in their Rolex
Regional Tournament. Featur
ing the top talent in the North
west, the singles bracket will
draw its champion from a pool of
64 and the doubles from a pool of
32. The Cardinal will enter eight
players into the singles competi
tion, translating into four teams
for doubles play.
As a tournament essentially
devoted to qualifying players for
the tournament in February, the
team eagerly seeks to gain expe
rience as well as a positive start
on the season.
"This is a good opportunity to
play in a lot of matches and beat
some other players up rather
than beating ourselves up," said
Brennan.
The women received as favor
able seedings as the men did.
The Cardinal will occupy spots
four through eight in the forms
of Katie Schlukebir, Kim Shas
by, Sandra De Silva, Ania
Bleszynski and Julie Scott,
respectively. The top three seeds
have been assigned to Vira
Vitels, Jennifer Poulos, and Pam
Nelson, all from Cal.
In doubles competition, the

women will team up Schlukebir
and Shasby, Bleszynski and Amy
Chiminello, Scott and Wendy
Sacks, and De Silva and Sophy
Woodhouse. This weekend
marks the first college competi
tion for freshmen Bleszynski,
Scott, and Woodhouse.
"I'm a little nervous just
because I haven't played a com
petitive match in a long time.
But I feel comfortable that prac
tice and my team has prepared
me well for the weekend,"
Bleszynski said.
Since the competition will be
the first of their collegiate
careers for three of the eight
participants, Brennan will look
to experienced seniors Chiminel
lo and Shasby to provide guid
ance for the rookies. The team
also will rely on the leadership of
AIl-American Schlukebir, the
only Stanford player to have
already competed this year.
"Katie's been out there
already, and she's a very mature
sophomore," the coach said. "I'd
like them [Schlukebir, Chiminel
lo, and Shasby] to show the oth
