# Tennis swings at Rolex
## Both teams face top competition 
### Courtney Mann Contributing writer 
A tidal wave of Cardinal will
sweep over the courts of North
ern California this weekend as
both the men's and women's
tennis teams step up to the net
in the Rolex Northern California
Men's Intercollegiate Tourna
ment held at California and the
Women's Rolex Regionals held
at St. Mary's College in Moraga.
Both of these tournaments
potentially lead to automatic
entry into the Rolex Individual
Indoor Championships held in
Dallas in February. The champi
on of this weekend's tourna
ments and the runner-up
receive unconditional entry. In
addition, a player must have
competed in this tournament in
order to achieve a wildcard berth
into the February tournament.
For the men's team however,
this tournament means signifi
cantly more than a mere qualify
ing competition. Before the
Rolex Qualifying Tournament
existed, this weekend's festivi
ties were held annually since
1947 to enhance tennis promi
nence of individuals and schools
in the Northern California area.
The competition continues
towards this aim despite its clas
sification as the Rolex qualifying
tournament.
The Stanford men's team has
additional desires to achieve
bragging rights among its local
colleagues. The Cardinal cur
rently owns those rights after
taking the crown last year and
for the last six years. In fact, Cal
ifornia's victory in 1979 was the
last time a team other than
Stanford captured this tourna
ment (a team champion was not

awarded in 1987).
The Cardinal is presented
with an opportunity to continue
its dominance as it will enter six
players out of the team's eight
into the top 11 singles seeds:
junior Jeff Salzenstein (1),
freshman Scott Humphries (3),
freshman Paul Goldstein (4),
junior Jim Thomas (6), junior
Ricky Becker (10) and sopho
more Grant Elliot (11). Fresh
men Charles Hoeveler and
Misha Palecek round out the
rest of the Stanford lineup.
All but Hoeveler received
first round byes into the second
round. As last year's defending
singles champion, Thomas
brings a history of success with
him to the tournament.
"It's nice going into a tourna
ment knowing you've played
well there before," he said.
The doubles bracket seedings
show equal promise for Stan
ford. The doubles teams of
Humphries/Goldstein, Salzen
stein/Elliot and Thomas/Becker
placed into the first, fourth, and
seventh spots, thus sending
them straight into the second
round. Palecek and Hoeveler
will attempt to join the others
there with a first round victory
over John Devorss and Delbert
Rlodll of Oregon. Salzenstein
reigns as half of this tourna
ment's 1993 championship dou
bles team.
Men's head coach Dick Gould
believes the overall timing of the
tournament is favorable. "It's a
real good time for a tournament.
We're finishing up our sixth
week of practice, and we're look
ing good physically," he said.
