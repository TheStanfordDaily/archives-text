## 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
On Friday the Stanford women's golf team has
a chance to prove that golfers hit with woods
rather than into them.
After last tournament's disaster when a two
stroke lead transformed almost instantaneously
into a 12 stroke loss, the Cardinal will attempt to
erase any traces of the experience from its memo
ry-
At 8 a.m. Stanford will begin its toughest tour
nament to date. Twelve teams, eight of which are
ranked in the top 10, will compete in the Golf
World-Palmetto Dunes Collegiate taking place in
Hilton Head, S.C.
"It's going to be a very star-studded field of both
teams and individuals," said coach Tim Baldwin.
In addition to the top teams in the country, the
best collegiate players will also take part. The ros
ters include three Curtis Cuppers, Stephanie

Sparks of Duke, Janice Moodie of San Jose State
and Mhairi McKay of Stanford. The trio played for
their respective countries in the international
event.
Other stars slated for the tournament include
five additional World Amateur Team champi
onships competitors. Overall, four returning first
team Ail-Americans will play for their universities.
Fourth-ranked Stanford will challenge second
ranked San Jose State and third-ranked UCLA as
well as the fifth- through ninth-ranked schools,
Wake Forest, Texas, Duke, Furman and Tulsa.
Other ranked teams include No. 11 Oklahoma and
USC, ranked 13th. Tennessee and small-college
champion Rollins will also attend. Last year's win
ner, top-ranked Arizona State, will compete in
another tournament this weekend.
The tournament will be held in conjunction
with the men's competition, one that also features
great players and the top-ranked
Stanford men's golf team.
The women's golf team mem
bers that will make the cross
country trip include McKay,
Andrea Baxter, Jamille Jose,
Vicky Strada and Amy Lawrence.
Baxter, a preseason All-American
and semi-finalist at the U.S. Ama
teur, won the individual title in the

first tournament of the year in
which the Cardinal competed. Jose
has played consistently well
throughout the season, finishing in
the top 10 in every tournament. The
five team members will compete on
the par-72 Arthur Hills course at
Palmetto Hall.
When asked if Stanford might
forget the lessons of the previous
tournament, Baldwin replied that
does not foresee history repeating
itself. "We're anticipating that all of
our players will play strong and that
our team will [challenge for] the
title," Baldwin said.
