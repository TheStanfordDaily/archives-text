# Rough and tough
## Lacrosse season begins 
### Amir Arbabi 
As the fall sports season
comes to an end, Stanford fans
anxiously await the start of
the new sports lineup. While
both spectators and players
are gearing up for basketball,
the most popular winter sport,
there are also many other
teams on campus looking for a
chance to display their respec
tive skills on the playing field.
Looking forward to a very
productive season this year,
the Stanford men's lacrosse
team is one of them. After
turning in a mediocre 7-6
record last season, the team
made an impressive appear
ance at the West Coast play
offs for the first time in years.
The reason for this new-found
success? Working hard and
setting higher goals.
Senior captain Matt Jones,
the team leader, anticipates a
promising season. "Right
now, it is a matter of getting
things together with all of the
new people on the team and
our new coach," Jones said.
"Once we do, I think v/e'll be
great."
Keys to the team's success
include the acquisition of five
freshmen: Ronald Rhea, Tyler
Roozen, Dan Broderick, Pat
Orosco and Jeremy Milo. In
addition, transfer Peter Jensen
from UCLA adds necessary
experience to the line up.
The team has just started
practicing together, and as a
result things are just begin
ning to gel, according to Jones.
First-year coach Dan Williams,

from Dartmouth, is also
expected to play an influential
part in the course the team
takes this season.
"The coach and the team
are very enthusiastic about
our upcoming season, and
know with a lot work we can
be productive," Rhea said.
"Coming together with many
new players and a new coach
takes time, but I think we'll be
ready for the opener on
November 18th."
Each lacrosse team fields 10
players â€” three attackmen,
three midfielders, three
defensemen and one goalie.
While a team is comprised of
fewer players, the sport resem
bles football in that it involves
a large amount of gear. Since
they check each other with
their bodies and sticks, players
require plenty of protection
including shoulder pads,
gloves, arm pads, and a hel
met. Additionally, the lacrosse
ball is made of a metal core
coated with a very strong rub
ber material that can cause a
great amount of pain if it
comes into contact with a play
er.
"The physical part of the
game is exhilarating, but it is
in no way a substitute for
skill," Rhea said.
The day before Big Game,
the team will take on Califor
nia's lacrosse team at Maloney
field. The rest of the strenuous
15-game regular season sched
ule continues in February,
including opponents such as
UC-Davis, UC-Santa Cruz and
other California schools.
