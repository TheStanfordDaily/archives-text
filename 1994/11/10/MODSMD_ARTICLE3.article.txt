# Fac Sen to debate CUE again today
## Science core committee to include students 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
Debate over the Commission on
Undergraduate Education's rec
ommended curricular reforms will
continue at the Faculty Senate
today, as the process of imple
menting those reforms is opened
up to student input.
The committee that will design
a new science core — which would
replace the current science, engi
neering and mathematics distrib
ution requirements — will now in
clude two student members select
ed by the ASSU.
Provost Condoleezza Rice will
appoint the committee's faculty
members by the end of the quarter
with input from the Faculty Sen
ate.
Rice had planned to restrict the
design committees only to profes
sors who would commit to teach-

ing the new
course. But lob
bying from the
ASSU Council of
Presidents con
vinced her to
change her mind,
she said.
"Curriculum
matters are in the
faculty jurisdic-

tion — when you get your syl
labus, there's no student input to
that," Rice said. "But more impor
tant is the need to have continuity
for a couple years. I was concerned
about continuity and experience,"
she said.
To meet those concerns, the
COP agreed to impose two re
quirements on student represen
tatives: students must serve on
the committee for two years, and


Casper
must also have studied in a tech
nical field.
One undergraduate science or
engineering major and one sci
ence graduate student will be
selected by the ASSU's Commit
tee on Committees within the
next two weeks, said COP mem
ber Mork Murdock.
Rice said students' letters and
phone calls to herself and to Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
were persuasive.
"Just like I had some concerns,
I think there were also some con
cerns of the faculty," she said.
"But when we talked about it at
the [Faculty Senate] steering
committee meeting, people were
convinced by the arguments stu
dents made to Gerhard and to
me."
Rice, Biology Prof. Robert
Simoni — the senate chair — and
Political Science Prof. David
Brady, who chairs the senate's
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, will name faculty mem
bers to the science core committee.
A second committee to
redesign the University's "culture
core" — defined by the CUE
report as the Cultures, Ideas and
Values program and the Ameri

can Cultures and World Cultures
DRs — will be formed next quar
ter, Murdock said.
From the COP's perspective,
the new committee positions are
much better than the initial plan
Rice announced, he added.
"For a curriculum to be effec
tive," Murdock said, "it helps to
have people who are actually tak
ing the classes involved in the pro
cess, giving feedback and helping

to make them."
Murdock also cited a lack of
"precedence" for Rice's proposal.
"When [the committees] were
initially announced ... we imme
diately asked what the justifica
tion was for that," he said. "Near
ly all Faculty Senate committees

have students on them."
Simoni also praised the
changes as "very positive," espe
cially because of the nature of the
implementation process and the
science core debate so far.
"There's been no real resis
tance to the idea in principle, but
everyone I've talked to has a dif
ferent idea of how [the class]
should be brought about," he
said.
Nevertheless, Simoni said he
expects today's senate debate to
go relatively smoothly.
The senate has invited the
chairs of all technical depart
ments to today's meeting, so
there will be "no shortage of opin
ions," Simoni said, but he added
that such input shouldn't disturb
an overall consensus.
"There's fairly good agreement
that the current options probably
don't emphasize scientific princi
ples enough," he said.
This means implementing a
science core could happen "rela
tively quickly," Simoni added.
Casper has expressed hopes that
the report would be fully imple
mented within two years.
Selection of student represen
tatives on the science committee
will follow normal ASSU nomi
nating procedures. Students can
call 5-ASSU for instructions on
how to apply, or e-mail assu
cop@list.
