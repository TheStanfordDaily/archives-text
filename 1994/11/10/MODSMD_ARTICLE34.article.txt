# Different cultures meet and mesh on the Reservation
## Stanford students both teach and learn through Zuni program 
### Moira Chiong 
Sitting in a high school cultur
al anthropology class, students of
the Zuni tribe were astonished to
find a picture in their textbooks of
a Native-American student
attending Stanford.
Their assistant teacher, junior
Bianca Perla, wants to take that
astonishment and turn it into
motivation. She wants her stu
dents at the Zuni reservation to
realize that pursuing a Stanford
education is a realistic goal.
"I want to give a sense of hope
to the students and the message
that they have the opportunity to
go on in education if they're
interested, despite life circum
stances," she said.
As part of the quarter-long
Zuni Reservation Project, Perla
and four other Stanford under
graduates assist teachers at two
high schools on the Zuni Indian
Reservation in New Mexico. The
project — which Anthropology
Profs. Cliff Barnett and John
Rick founded in 1987 — allows
students and professors to teach
cultural anthropology of the
Southwest to Native-American
high school students. Stanford
students lead discussions and
games, proofread papers and
help with note taking.
Sophomore Julia Macias
recalled the first days of school.
"At first we told them something
and they'd write it down," she
said. "But now we can talk and
are on the same level, which
makes it more exciting for me
and for them."

Rick also noted the unique
connection between the Zuni
teen-agers and Stanford stu
dents. "Magic occurs between
college students and high school
students — they have a lot to say
to each other and it's extremely
rewarding on both sides," he
said.
For their work, the teaching
assistants will receive 15 units
for the quarter in Cultural
Anthropology of the Southwest
and Directed Independent Study,
Macias said.
In order to receive units, the
teaching assistants help Barnett
lead the Cultural Anthropology
of the Southwest course, which
spans the pre-history period of
the Southwest to modern society.
"In this course, we're trying to
teach that cultures are living
things," Barnett said. "If they
remain static, they die. Culture
is also a problem-solving device
that students can use as their
ancestors did."
He also emphasized that while
the students may know a lot
about their own tribe, they will
often know less about others. In
order to increase this knowledge,
Barnett takes the students on
trips to Navajo reservations and
other locations in New Mexico.
Barnett said the course also
strives to give students an idea of
what universities are like and
provides academic tools that
Stanford students perhaps take
for granted, such as study skills,
note taking and writing.
Macias said, from her experi
ence she has gained a different

perspective on Native-American
culture, and realized how much
of the culture she will never
know. Because of this perspec
tive, she said she understands
the difficulties some Zunis have
relating to both societies.
"It's hard to hold onto what's
different and what is the same,"
she said. "Holding onto one cul
ture is difficult when bombarded
by the mainstream culture of the
United States," Macias said.
Perla cited incidents when
conflict between Zuni and Amer
ican values arose.
Religion poses a problem, she
said, because the Zuni tribe can
not be Christian and practice the
Zuni religion at the same time.
Education is also problematic
for Zuni students, Perla said.
Often students will go to school
until 3 p.m., and then return
home to begin their formal Zuni
training, which affords them less
time to study for school.
Besides working within the
schools, the Stanford students
work several hours per week for
community service projects like
Head Start, a nursery school pro
gram for low income families,
peer counseling and the Zuni
Conservation Project.
Macias, who volunteers at
Head Start, said that while the
classes are taught in English, the
emphasis is on Zuni culture. In
class, Zuni foster grandparents
will come to tell Zuni stories and
at National Head Start Day, they
performed traditional Zuni
dances.
Four Stanford students live in

government housing at Black
Rock, a newer suburb, and one
lives in a traditional Zuni-built
stone house at Old Town. Perla
lives in Black Rock with a family
of two parents and a child.
"One thing that struck me
was the way they discipline their
children," Perla said. "Parents
talk to kids like grown-ups who
have minds and logic and give
them explanations. They allow
them to learn through their
actions. They're soft spoken peo
ple."
Perla cited the differences
between living in mainstream
America and living on the reser

vation. "Being with the Zuni
seems like being in America but
then some things are different,"
she said. "The attitude is more
relaxed; in their minds, new
things happen because of the
interaction between witches,
mystical things and dreams,"
Perla said.
She said she has also picked
up on colloquialisms including
"la," the equivalent of "not," and
"ha" which Zuni children use in
questions. For example, a child
might say to his father, "Papa
ha, can we go to the park-ha?"
Macias lives in Old Town with
a more traditional family, sur

rounded by maternal relatives.
When Zuni men marry, they
marry into the wife's family with
socialization based on the wife's
side. While the other students
live with younger families who
may have spent time in urban
America, Macias' family has
lived in Old Town their entire
life.
"Just like in any situation
where you're going to a new
place it will be different," she
said. "It does not have to be hard,
it depends on how flexible you're
willing to be. If you're willing to
come and experience something
new, it shouldn't be hard."
