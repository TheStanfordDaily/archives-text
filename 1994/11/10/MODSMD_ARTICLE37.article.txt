# Palo Alto Players Presents the musical revue
## BLUES IN THE NIGHT 
### Linda Friedlieb 
The Palo Alto Players want to put some
blues in your night. With their sec
ond production of the year, the local
theater group h.is struck both some high
notes and some low, some sharp and some
flat.
By far the most resounding chord in
their production of "Blues in the Night" is
that ot nostalgia, with strong performances
ot such classic songs .is "Wild Women I )on't
Have the Blues' and "Nobody Knows You
When You're Down and Out." C ertainly the
music serves as both a clarion call and a
comfort to those who are hittinc bottom in

the game ot love.
As a musical, "Blues" is constructed al
most entirely as a string of favorite old blues
songs mixed in with some which may ring no
bells whatsoever. Originating off-Broadway
in 19H2, "Blues" remains a tribute to the
greats of the genre — Bessie Smith, Duke
Hllington, Benny Goodman, Alberta Hunter
and more.
Together their tunes tell the story ot three
women — called somewhat unimaginatively
"The Lady from the Road," "T he Woman of
the World" and"The Girl on a Date." 1 he
women are held together bv their common

home in an old, run-down motel and the
aura of heartbreak which engulfs the trio
throughout one long night and several trips
down memory lane. Of course, what more
can we expect of a musical full ot blues
songs?
In addition, a lone male — I he Man in
the Saloon — serves .is toil, commentator
and sometimes-fantasv man tor these
women and their songs ol heartbreak.
One ol the interesting things about
the Halo Alto Players production
of "Blues" is the apparently race
blind casting. While the Man and the Lady
are both African-American, the t iirl and the
Woman are not — a crucial distinction
given that most of the tunes were originally
performed by such African-American
greats as Bessie Smith.
However, when it comes to voices, all of
the actors can hit their share of high notes.
Carolyn Tidwell and Dee Dee Healy, as the
1 adyand the Woman respectively, keep us al
ternating between tears and laughter per
forming songs such as " lake it Right Back,"
"Take Me for a Buggy Ride" and "Lush Life."
Their strong voices resound with experience
singing the blues, appropriate since both per
form locally with the Mike Sloan Band.
Anne-Becky Redlich performs adequately
as the innocent young Girl, but her part lacks
the same development and depth of the other
women's roles and her voice is sometimes
drowned out by the orchestra performing
behind her.
With a talent for funny faces and chem
istry with all three of his female co-stars,
lerome Mason often steals the spotlight. As
he tries to get away from the Lady as she sings
"Buggy Ride" and performs his own rousing
rendition of "Babv Doll," Mason brings

many needed instances of comic relief to his
blue songs. Unfortunately, while his gestures
always make the audience laugh, his voice is
sometimes overshadowed by the power of
the orchestra.
Like any story of men and women, to
some extent "blues" comes down to sex, love
and some crazy mixture of the two. The phys
ical aspects are played up by the women u ith
an incredible number of pelvic thrusts, sonu
tremendous "come hither looks, and tlun
amazing ability to sing certain lyrics with
semi-straight face. (Check out "Kitchen
Man": "Mis jelly rolls are always hot/ tlk
never fail to touch my spot. )
but what "blues" has in song, it lacks i
plot. Often, the numbers don't follow am
sort of linear or story-driven path, instead
wandering and meandering where the lyrics
take them. Time passes, but ver\ little
changes in any meaningful or thought-pro
voking way.
Ultimately, "Blues" remains a string of
notes which leaves behind the deeper mean
ing of the music. It sets a tone and a mood
but lacks the story and character depth which
would make it more than a passing fain\ ■
