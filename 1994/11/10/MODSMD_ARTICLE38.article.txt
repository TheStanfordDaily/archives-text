# E B FRALEY and the Cross-Eyed Cats in the Spotlight

### Tasneem Campwala 
Next Wednesday, new blues band E.B.
Fraley and the Cross-Eyed Cats will
join the ranks of other local musical
talents who have had their chance to shine
in the Coffee-House spotlight. Earlier this
week, 1 met the man who got them there.
At 5:30 p.m., 1 shouldered my way into
the Coffee House, battled the dinner
crowd, and eventually found myself a cor
ner to sit in. I sipped a latte, desperately
needing a caffeine high to keep me going
for the rest of the day. A few minutes later,
E.B. Fraley, guitarist-songwriter/lead
singer/frontman/demo hocker, joined me.
1 checked him out. Sure, I thought, he
seems the stereotypical rock musician
type: long hair, pierced ears, slightly
scruffy. But then we got to talking, and I re
alized that there's more to F.B. Fraley (and
his music) than just an image.
First of all, he's a self-taught musician.
At 14, he picked up his brother's guitar, be
ginning a life-long love affair. Although he
worked the hard rock and heavy metal
scenes for a while, these musical styles
weren't enough to appease Fraley's musical
tastes. The first song he ever learned to play
was Boston's "More Than a Feeling," but he
quickly moved into creating and writing
his own original music.
Fraley remembered his songwriting be
ginnings with amusement:
"In the beginning, I'd play keyboards
and my brother would play guitar, but we
sucked so bad that we couldn't even play
the simplest rock tunes," he said with a
chuckle. "In a way, I was sort of forced into
making up my own stuff — I couldn't play
anyone else's."
Eventually, Fraley found his musical
niche when a friend showed him a video
tape of Stevie Kay Vaughn in performance.
The sound of blues turned him on and
found expression in his own song-writing
and guitar-playing.
E.B. Fraley's new album, "Down the
Road," is clearly influenced by the
blues styles of the old masters like
Stevie Ray Vaughn and Muddy Waters. At
the same time, Fraley demonstrates his
own talent and refreshingly unique style.
Fraley described his album, "It's a com
bination of different blues styles. We only

had one day to do all of the recording, so
the album is pretty much live. I think that
some of the best songs on the album were
written in a few minutes, sometimes right
before we went into the studio."
The spur-of-the-moment writing tech
nique that Fraley uses certainly seems to
work for him. The ten songs on the album,
while all fluid and richly textured, each
have a distinctive sound.
"Leave You Be," for instance, features
Fraley's rough, raspy vocals and rhythmic
electric guitar, while the title track "Down
the Road" carries more of a pop beat.
"Tight Grip" builds itself around a
heavy Hendrix-style guitar riff, which con
trasts with "Bring Me Back Home," a
sweet-sounding acoustic tune with a folk
blues edge. "To Be the One (To Be With
Me)" follows a more traditional blues
style.
"The first side of the album is lively, fun,
peppy. It's good-time music. Nothing
heavy or too serious," Fraley said of "Down
the Road."
"The second side has more of a message.
'Donny Hart,' was the first song that I ever
wrote. It's a hopeful song, looking forward
to that time when we won't have distinc
tions based on race and class. Maybe that's
my idea of heaven."
So, would you say that your music is re
ligious? I asked.
"Sure, I think that some of my music
comes from my own religious beliefs. In
the song 'Today,' I imagine myself having a
personal conversation with God, but the
song can be interpreted in so many differ
ent ways. It definitely doesn't have to be re
ligious for everyone," Fraley explained.
Perhaps one of the most intriguing and
appealing qualities of Fraley's music is that
it is so personal. The lyrics are sensitive and
thoughtful. The music is raw and evoca
tive.
"Today," for instance, blends hard rock
guitar and drums with heartfelt and honest
lyrics: "When I speak aloud, will they hear
what I say?/ When they listen, will they
judge me right away?/. . . you keep telling
me I have so much to say/ You keep telling
me tomorrow's not today."
The sincerity which Fraley feels about
his music came through as we talked
about "Today." He revealed, looking
thoughtful, "Making music is not just
about making money. I also feel that there's
an important responsibility to make a dif
ference in people's lives, even if it's just a
small one. Everyone's got something im
portant to say, and I speak through my
music."

Although a few of the songs on Fraley's
album are serious in tone, most of the
music is simply light-hearted and upbeat
— the kind with toe-tapping and head
banging appeal. "Little Skeeter" is my
own personal favorite. "Little Skeeter/
I've got my baseball bat/ Little Skeeter/
I'm going to squash you flat" is the gist of
the song, a combination of witty (and
rather silly) lyrics with driving guitar and
bass.
Okay, so end the suspense, Fraley. Who
exactly is Little Skeeter? I asked.
"Don't you know?" Fraley teased, flash
ing me a characteristic, rakish grin.
Well ... I think I know, but I'd rather
not guess ... So tell me, I demanded.
"It's simple, really. I wrote the song late

one night. Because it was very hot, I had the
window open. But there wasn't a screen . ..
so I spent a very long, frustrating time
chasing mosquitoes out of the room. Every
time I thought I had got rid of them, I'd
turn out the light. And then, I would hear
'Buzz .. . Buzz ... Buzz!"'
A song about mosquitoes? Good grief!
"Yep. Just mosquitoes. Nothing pro
found," Fraley laughed.
We wrapped up the interview, and Fra
ley left. I shuffled my papers around, and
got my things together. As 1 was about to
leave, 1 noticed the cup of coffee, forgotten
in the heat of the conversation. Fraley's en
ergy and enthusiasm for his work rubbed
off on me. 1 felt buzzed — and 1 didn't even
need the caffeine. ■
