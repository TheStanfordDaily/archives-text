It's not just the whole borderline-offen
sive motif that puts some off to the
Jerky Boys, it's their style of humor.
They're raunchy and cruel. They're random
and irreverent.
They pick up the phone and bother people.
The Jerky Boys are piofessional prank
callers — as such, some see their niche in the
entertainment world as just one or two evolu
tionary steps below that of Howard Stern.
Just the same, Kamal and Johhny B. and
their grab-bag of characters have ridden the
word-o-mouth underground from the CD
shop to the collegiate subconscious — granti
ng them the heavyweight title for the most
quoted shtick around.
Pack that with some creative promotion
and a few cuss words here and there, and
they've made a whole new genre out of a pre
adolescent pastime. Two top-selling albums
down and a flick on the way, the Jerky Boys
seem to have made it a career to boot.
How did it all start?
Kamal: It started as a little boring-we-had
nothing-to-do thing. Me and John were hang
ing out and we had, like, a case of beers and we
were drinking, getting drunk and —
Johnny B. (interrupting): — Actually the first
calls were done sober.
Kamal: Oh yeah, the next day we were drunk.
Anyway John called around — the auto me
chanic thing, 'Pablo Honey,' all that Sol Rosen
berg stuff — bothering a few people. We made
a tape and passed it out to friends and they
passed it out to other people and within a
year's time, like, everyone knew about us. It
just got big like that. This was in the mid
eighties.
Bless the underground, huh?
K: Right, they were underground, then we
came out with the fucking albums.
And does your mother know?
K: Know what?
What you do?
K: Oh sure —she's very proud of me. She's very
proud of what I do. My mom is actually the one
who dubbed us the Jerky Boys. She walked up
to the two of us and said, "Boy have I gotta
name for you." Actually, my mom gave us a few
ideas for skits. She gave me this one idea for
when I did the 'Fava Beans.' If you listen close
ly you can hear my mother on the background
saying, "Tell 'em this. Tell 'em you'll make him
eat his shoe." My mom, my own fucking moth
er. But she's good at that shit
Yup, this time all the one-to-four-minute
phone bits that make up the Jerky Boys'
two albums are mother-approved.
Though mom must be doing something
right. Their second album, "Jerky Boys 2,"
weaseled its way to number 12 on the charts —

the first time ever for a comedy album. After
two years of lingering in the upper echelon of
sales, their first album has been dubbed the
"Dark Side of the Moon" of comedy.
Uh-huh, all this for calling up a crematori
um and asking them if they'll charbroil your
mother befc r e she's dor.e breathing.
Mind you crank calls are something that
have been, to some extent, done before. And
with the Jerky Boys' recent success, they're not
the only ones going at it anymore. Similarly
styled rude-tapes have surfaced en mass, clut
tering the incoming-talent baskets at recording
studios all over the country.
The Jerky Boys' character-voices —
being familiar caricatures — are easily
mimicked, which is good for them in the
pop-culture sense, but bad in terms of the
competition.
Still, their routine isn't meant to be taken
like the Post-It® / "if only I'd thought of that
first I'd be a bazillionaire" phenomenon. To
their minds it's a matter of talent.
There area couple other folks out there doing the

cranking thing.
J: Yeah well let's face
it man, we came out
with this thing in the
mid-eighties. All
kinds of people are riding on our coat
tails right now. There are disk jockeys
that rip us off. They take our skits and
literally do it verbatim. But these guys
make thousands of calls to get one
halfway fucking decent call.

You gonna get back at them or
just let them sit?

J: No man, fuck it. Let 'em
chase us. You know
what happens? The
fans listen and they
may hear a skit and
they go, "Oh man that
shit, it fuckin' sucks."
K: And don't forget,
those other prank callers

that came before us — like you
got that 'Tube Bar' tape or what
ever — they didn't influence us.
We're not anything like those
things. That's like what five-year
olds do. We try to bring, like, little
stories into our skits.

How long have you two known each other?
J: About 20 years.
How old are you?
K: I'm 28.
J: And I'll be 33.1 don't look it, I mean, I still get
proofed for a six-pack.
Is there anything or anyone you won't do?
K: We never call people's homes. We only call
businesses. We'd never call something too off
color, like the police department or hospitals or

fire stations. Nothing like that. Believe it or not
we do have a modus operandi.
Any guidelines?
K: It's like, you don't want to fuck with people's
heads too much.
J: . A good point to make here is that, it's much
more fun to do a twisty, wacko kinda fucking
thing rather than to do a terrorizing thing. I
mean some of the ones we do are terrorizing,
but very few of them. And when they are we
wane it off so that it's not gunna fuck some
body's head up. And remember, we have to get
releases from these people in order to put them
on the album.
So if 1 give you a name and number, you wouldn't
take care of them for me?
K: Truthfully, we don't really do
that. A lot of people want us to but
... Oh man! Did you hear that?
John just laid out a fucking half-minute fart.
I've got it on tape.

And just when you thought there
was an ethic to all this. Now you
can see where some of the contro
versy which surrounds these two starts to form.
Their potty mouths are not for everyone, nor
are the discussions of anal pangs or lodged
potatoes or terrorist bombings.
Already, half the people who started reading
this article about them have counted enough
"fucks" to fold it down in favor of the cross
word puzzle.
Like "Beavis and Butthead," they are best
enjoyed drunk and with a group of friends.
And like "Saturday Night Live," they're much
funnier to quote the next day than they are in
—l i

the original.
For example: it's funnier to call a
friend'Pablo Honey'or to won

der aloud whether you

Obnoxious potty nouths or comedy
phenomenon?

should bring your shoes to the optometrist
than it is to actually hear Johhny B. say it
Doesn't mean they're not
funny at all, rather, that

signed for popularity. In

fact, their brand of (lowest-)
common-denominator humor has spread the
antagonistic gospel from east to west; and
they've kicked the pants off their competition
in the process.
All with a few phone calls.

Is cranking an art form then?
Look at it this way. Our "blue" stuff is very hip
in the sense that it's the dirtiest shit you could
ever hear, but it's not threatening to anyone.

We go into these conversa
tions about ourselves.

We get into this
heavy-duty
fucking sexual
stuff and all

kinds of horrible shit. It'll all be on the
third album.
When will that be coming out?
■ In about a year.
) What's the goal of a call?
: K: Truthfully speaking, everything we do is all
1 spontaneous. We literally just wing it. There's
i no message. There's no nothin'. As a matter of
fact, what makes us laugh the most is when
we're going to call people—say I'm to do
a call—and John will just shout out a number

and I'll just dial it. When it's ringing he'll tell
me that it's, like, a car place or something like
that. I won't even know until the guy gets on
the phone.
And is every one a winner?
K: Believe it or not, we only have 95 calls ever.
And every one of therr is a winner.
J: Actually that's the truth. The only things we
don't put on the albums is some stuff we
don't have cleared and certain things only
we like and everybody else says, "Holy
shit!"

How often do you guys do the calls?
K: Maybe once a year. The record
company says, "Hey guys, we gotta
put out another album." And we go
in ... We don't make all kinds of
prank phone calls, we only have the
95 together. We have some on re
serve, we could do new ones, but,
what the fuck.
And in-between the sessions?
J: We do like what we're doing right
now with you. We're promoting.
Wait up a second. Let's
think about this. This is
their job: They make

their rounds about once a year, take a vaca
tion, and then spend the next 11 months dis
cussing the original three days work. They've
made hardly any more calls than their fans
have heard — no waste, no editing. Their
guidelines consist of "Don't make anyone
bleed" and "Let's not get arrested again."
These guys have it even better than Weird
AL
Yet it's enough to keep busy. Enough to sell
albums. Enough to make a movie.
Any other projects?
J: We also just got done doing a movie. "The-
Jerky Boys," starts February 10. We tried to
bring back the old 1930's "Abbot and Costello,"
"Three Stooges"-type of comedy. Very slap
stick, but we mix it with the stuff that we do. So
it's very different and very unusual and very
creative I believe.
Do we get to see your faces in it?
K: Oh yeah, we were just goofing around with
that mask shit... as a joke for the fans. We
don't have to worry. Joey Buttafuoco's doing
movies now and that guy almost had someone
fucking killed.
What do you guys do when you're off the phones?

K: We like to play with each other's mickeys.
Does that fill up a whole week?
K: Sometimes. I also rebuild carburetors. Like
ones that aren't even broken. I just like fucking
rebuilding 'em and taking 'em apart as a hobby.
J: What I like doing is, for no fucking reason
whatsoever, on sunny days I just put all kinds
of butter ghee and all kinds of peanut butter,
anything sticky, all over... and then I put my
pants on.
—t's like they said, there's no message to
it. It's just meant to be funny —
whether they succeed at that is a factor
of your disposition.
But if they're only making calls and being
funny once a year, killing time in-between by
pouring Miracle Whip all over each other's
carburetors, what are they doing to make so
many fans out of ordinarily sensitive people?
Here's Johnny B.'s theory:
J: I'll let you in on a little secret of why our phe
nomenon has worked here so well. Because at
night, Kamal and I — this is fucking cool, no
body else knows this — we get into this really,
really tiny baby plane. And we go up in the sky
and we fly all over major cities and stuff and we
just drop heavy duty love and peace bombs all
over the cities.
You think that's worked?
J (While Kamal hums the French national an
them): Oh, it's worked man. We load the plane
up and we just go out and we drop tons of love
and peace bombs. When these love and peace
bombs hit they make this beautiful purple light
and the next thing you know, we're living in a
world where it couldn't be more lovely.
What else do we want to tell everyone about you?
J: If you could just make a real big note about
the peace bombs. And tell 'em that we'll be
coming to a city near you. And if you see this
purple light at night and smell this really cool
smell — that's Kamal and Johnny. Fucking
peace bombs and love bombs. Everywhere.
It's a theory.
But even if you do buy it, you still left with a
couple of questions...
Are the Jerky Boys really just a massive trick
played on the East Coast's collective taste buds?
Are Kamal and Johhny B. simply mocking the
recording industry with their psuedo-profes
sionalism? Do they deserve an eighth of the
success they've got?
It all depends on whether they make you
laugh.

things. That's like what five-year
olds do. We try to bring, like, little
stories into our skits.

How long have you two known each other?
J: About 20 years.
How old are you?
K: I'm 28.
J: And I'll be 33.1 don't look it, I mean, I still get
proofed for a six-pack.
Is there anything or anyone you won't do?
K: We never call people's homes. We only call
businesses. We'd never call something too off
color, like the police department or hospitals or

fire stations. Nothing like that. Believe it or not
we do have a modus operandi.
Any guidelines?
K: It's like, you don't want to fuck with people's
heads too much.
J: . A good point to make here is that, it's much
more fun to do a twisty, wacko kinda fucking
thing rather than to do a terrorizing thing. I
mean some of the ones we do are terrorizing,
but very few of them. And when they are we
wane it off so that it's not gunna fuck some
body's head up. And remember, we have to get
releases from these people in order to put them
on the album.
So if 1 give you a name and number, you wouldn't
take care of them for me?
K: Truthfully, we don't really do
that. A lot of people want us to but
... Oh man! Did you hear that?
John just laid out a fucking half-minute fart.
I've got it on tape.

And just when you thought there
was an ethic to all this. Now you
can see where some of the contro
versy which surrounds these two starts to form.
Their potty mouths are not for everyone, nor
are the discussions of anal pangs or lodged
potatoes or terrorist bombings.
Already, half the people who started reading
this article about them have counted enough
"fucks" to fold it down in favor of the cross
word puzzle.
Like "Beavis and Butthead," they are best
enjoyed drunk and with a group of friends.
And like "Saturday Night Live," they're much
funnier to quote the next day than they are in
—l i

the original.
For example: it's funnier to call a
friend'Pablo Honey'or to won

der aloud whether you

Obnoxious potty nouths or comedy
phenomenon?

should bring your shoes to the optometrist
than it is to actually hear Johhny B. say it
Doesn't mean they're not
funny at all, rather, that

signed for popularity. In

fact, their brand of (lowest-)
common-denominator humor has spread the
antagonistic gospel from east to west; and
they've kicked the pants off their competition
in the process.
All with a few phone calls.

Is cranking an art form then?
Look at it this way. Our "blue" stuff is very hip
in the sense that it's the dirtiest shit you could
ever hear, but it's not threatening to anyone.

We go into these conversa
tions about ourselves.

We get into this
heavy-duty
fucking sexual
stuff and all

kinds of horrible shit. It'll all be on the
third album.
When will that be coming out?
■ In about a year.
) What's the goal of a call?
: K: Truthfully speaking, everything we do is all
1 spontaneous. We literally just wing it. There's
i no message. There's no nothin'. As a matter of
fact, what makes us laugh the most is when
we're going to call people—say I'm to do
a call—and John will just shout out a number

and I'll just dial it. When it's ringing he'll tell
me that it's, like, a car place or something like
that. I won't even know until the guy gets on
the phone.
And is every one a winner?
K: Believe it or not, we only have 95 calls ever.
And every one of therr is a winner.
J: Actually that's the truth. The only things we
don't put on the albums is some stuff we
don't have cleared and certain things only
we like and everybody else says, "Holy
shit!"

How often do you guys do the calls?
K: Maybe once a year. The record
company says, "Hey guys, we gotta
put out another album." And we go
in ... We don't make all kinds of
prank phone calls, we only have the
95 together. We have some on re
serve, we could do new ones, but,
what the fuck.
And in-between the sessions?
J: We do like what we're doing right
now with you. We're promoting.
Wait up a second. Let's
think about this. This is
their job: They make

their rounds about once a year, take a vaca
tion, and then spend the next 11 months dis
cussing the original three days work. They've
made hardly any more calls than their fans
have heard — no waste, no editing. Their
guidelines consist of "Don't make anyone
bleed" and "Let's not get arrested again."
These guys have it even better than Weird
AL
Yet it's enough to keep busy. Enough to sell
albums. Enough to make a movie.
Any other projects?
J: We also just got done doing a movie. "The-
Jerky Boys," starts February 10. We tried to
bring back the old 1930's "Abbot and Costello,"
"Three Stooges"-type of comedy. Very slap
stick, but we mix it with the stuff that we do. So
it's very different and very unusual and very
creative I believe.
Do we get to see your faces in it?
K: Oh yeah, we were just goofing around with
that mask shit... as a joke for the fans. We
don't have to worry. Joey Buttafuoco's doing
movies now and that guy almost had someone
fucking killed.
What do you guys do when you're off the phones?

K: We like to play with each other's mickeys.
Does that fill up a whole week?
K: Sometimes. I also rebuild carburetors. Like
ones that aren't even broken. I just like fucking
rebuilding 'em and taking 'em apart as a hobby.
J: What I like doing is, for no fucking reason
whatsoever, on sunny days I just put all kinds
of butter ghee and all kinds of peanut butter,
anything sticky, all over... and then I put my
pants on.
—t's like they said, there's no message to
it. It's just meant to be funny —
whether they succeed at that is a factor
of your disposition.
But if they're only making calls and being
funny once a year, killing time in-between by
pouring Miracle Whip all over each other's
carburetors, what are they doing to make so
many fans out of ordinarily sensitive people?
Here's Johnny B.'s theory:
J: I'll let you in on a little secret of why our phe
nomenon has worked here so well. Because at
night, Kamal and I — this is fucking cool, no
body else knows this — we get into this really,
really tiny baby plane. And we go up in the sky
and we fly all over major cities and stuff and we
just drop heavy duty love and peace bombs all
over the cities.
You think that's worked?
J (While Kamal hums the French national an
them): Oh, it's worked man. We load the plane
up and we just go out and we drop tons of love
and peace bombs. When these love and peace
bombs hit they make this beautiful purple light
and the next thing you know, we're living in a
world where it couldn't be more lovely.
What else do we want to tell everyone about you?
J: If you could just make a real big note about
the peace bombs. And tell 'em that we'll be
coming to a city near you. And if you see this
purple light at night and smell this really cool
smell — that's Kamal and Johnny. Fucking
peace bombs and love bombs. Everywhere.
It's a theory.
But even if you do buy it, you still left with a
couple of questions...
Are the Jerky Boys really just a massive trick
played on the East Coast's collective taste buds?
Are Kamal and Johhny B. simply mocking the
recording industry with their psuedo-profes
sionalism? Do they deserve an eighth of the
success they've got?
It all depends on whether they make you
laugh.

Story by Michael Green

It's not just the whole borderline-offen
sive motif that puts some off to the
Jerky Boys, it's their style of humor.
They're raunchy and cruel. They're random
and irreverent.
They pick up the phone and bother people.
The Jerky Boys are piofessional prank
callers — as such, some see their niche in the
entertainment world as just one or two evolu
tionary steps below that of Howard Stern.
Just the same, Kamal and Johhny B. and
their grab-bag of characters have ridden the
word-o-mouth underground from the CD
shop to the collegiate subconscious — granti
ng them the heavyweight title for the most
quoted shtick around.
Pack that with some creative promotion
and a few cuss words here and there, and
they've made a whole new genre out of a pre
adolescent pastime. Two top-selling albums
down and a flick on the way, the Jerky Boys
seem to have made it a career to boot.
How did it all start?
Kamal: It started as a little boring-we-had
nothing-to-do thing. Me and John were hang
ing out and we had, like, a case of beers and we
were drinking, getting drunk and —
Johnny B. (interrupting): — Actually the first
calls were done sober.
Kamal: Oh yeah, the next day we were drunk.
Anyway John called around — the auto me
chanic thing, 'Pablo Honey,' all that Sol Rosen
berg stuff — bothering a few people. We made
a tape and passed it out to friends and they
passed it out to other people and within a
year's time, like, everyone knew about us. It
just got big like that. This was in the mid
eighties.
Bless the underground, huh?
K: Right, they were underground, then we
came out with the fucking albums.
And does your mother know?
K: Know what?
What you do?
K: Oh sure —she's very proud of me. She's very
proud of what I do. My mom is actually the one
who dubbed us the Jerky Boys. She walked up
to the two of us and said, "Boy have I gotta
name for you." Actually, my mom gave us a few
ideas for skits. She gave me this one idea for
when I did the 'Fava Beans.' If you listen close
ly you can hear my mother on the background
saying, "Tell 'em this. Tell 'em you'll make him
eat his shoe." My mom, my own fucking moth
er. But she's good at that shit
Yup, this time all the one-to-four-minute
phone bits that make up the Jerky Boys'
two albums are mother-approved.
Though mom must be doing something
right. Their second album, "Jerky Boys 2,"
weaseled its way to number 12 on the charts —

the first time ever for a comedy album. After
two years of lingering in the upper echelon of
sales, their first album has been dubbed the
"Dark Side of the Moon" of comedy.
Uh-huh, all this for calling up a crematori
um and asking them if they'll charbroil your
mother befc r e she's dor.e breathing.
Mind you crank calls are something that
have been, to some extent, done before. And
with the Jerky Boys' recent success, they're not
the only ones going at it anymore. Similarly
styled rude-tapes have surfaced en mass, clut
tering the incoming-talent baskets at recording
studios all over the country.
The Jerky Boys' character-voices —
being familiar caricatures — are easily
mimicked, which is good for them in the
pop-culture sense, but bad in terms of the
competition.
Still, their routine isn't meant to be taken
like the Post-It® / "if only I'd thought of that
first I'd be a bazillionaire" phenomenon. To
their minds it's a matter of talent.
There area couple other folks out there doing the

cranking thing.
J: Yeah well let's face
it man, we came out
with this thing in the
mid-eighties. All
kinds of people are riding on our coat
tails right now. There are disk jockeys
that rip us off. They take our skits and
literally do it verbatim. But these guys
make thousands of calls to get one
halfway fucking decent call.

You gonna get back at them or
just let them sit?

J: No man, fuck it. Let 'em
chase us. You know
what happens? The
fans listen and they
may hear a skit and
they go, "Oh man that
shit, it fuckin' sucks."
K: And don't forget,
those other prank callers

that came before us — like you
got that 'Tube Bar' tape or what
ever — they didn't influence us.
We're not anything like those
things. That's like what five-year
olds do. We try to bring, like, little

their job: They make

their rounds about once a year, take a vaca
tion, and then spend the next 11 months dis
cussing the original three days work. They've
made hardly any more calls than their fans
have heard — no waste, no editing. Their
guidelines consist of "Don't make anyone
bleed" and "Let's not get arrested again."
These guys have it even better than Weird
AL
Yet it's enough to keep busy. Enough to sell
albums. Enough to make a movie.
Any other projects?
J: We also just got done doing a movie. "The-
Jerky Boys," starts February 10. We tried to
bring back the old 1930's "Abbot and Costello,"
"Three Stooges"-type of comedy. Very slap
stick, but we mix it with the stuff that we do. So
it's very different and very unusual and very
creative I believe.
Do we get to see your faces in it?
K: Oh yeah, we were just goofing around with
that mask shit... as a joke for the fans. We
don't have to worry. Joey Buttafuoco's doing
movies now and that guy almost had someone
fucking killed.
What do you guys do when you're off the phones?

K: We like to play with each other's mickeys.
Does that fill up a whole week?
K: Sometimes. I also rebuild carburetors. Like
ones that aren't even broken. I just like fucking
rebuilding 'em and taking 'em apart as a hobby.
J: What I like doing is, for no fucking reason
whatsoever, on sunny days I just put all kinds
of butter ghee and all kinds of peanut butter,
anything sticky, all over... and then I put my
pants on.
—t's like they said, there's no message to
it. It's just meant to be funny —
whether they succeed at that is a factor
of your disposition.
But if they're only making calls and being
funny once a year, killing time in-between by
pouring Miracle Whip all over each other's
carburetors, what are they doing to make so
many fans out of ordinarily sensitive people?
Here's Johnny B.'s theory:
J: I'll let you in on a little secret of why our phe
nomenon has worked here so well. Because at
night, Kamal and I — this is fucking cool, no
body else knows this — we get into this really,
really tiny baby plane. And we go up in the sky
and we fly all over major cities and stuff and we
just drop heavy duty love and peace bombs all
over the cities.
You think that's worked?
J (While Kamal hums the French national an
them): Oh, it's worked man. We load the plane
up and we just go out and we drop tons of love
and peace bombs. When these love and peace
bombs hit they make this beautiful purple light
and the next thing you know, we're living in a
world where it couldn't be more lovely.
What else do we want to tell everyone about you?
J: If you could just make a real big note about
the peace bombs. And tell 'em that we'll be
coming to a city near you. And if you see this
purple light at night and smell this really cool
smell — that's Kamal and Johnny. Fucking
peace bombs and love bombs. Everywhere.
It's a theory.
But even if you do buy it, you still left with a
couple of questions...
Are the Jerky Boys really just a massive trick
played on the East Coast's collective taste buds?
Are Kamal and Johhny B. simply mocking the
recording industry with their psuedo-profes
sionalism? Do they deserve an eighth of the
success they've got?
It all depends on whether they make you
laugh.

Story by Michael Green

It's not just the whole borderline-offen
sive motif that puts some off to the
Jerky Boys, it's their style of humor.
They're raunchy and cruel. They're random
and irreverent.
They pick up the phone and bother people.
The Jerky Boys are piofessional prank
callers — as such, some see their niche in the
entertainment world as just one or two evolu
tionary steps below that of Howard Stern.
Just the same, Kamal and Johhny B. and
their grab-bag of characters have ridden the
word-o-mouth underground from the CD
shop to the collegiate subconscious — granti
ng them the heavyweight title for the most
quoted shtick around.
Pack that with some creative promotion
and a few cuss words here and there, and
they've made a whole new genre out of a pre
adolescent pastime. Two top-selling albums
down and a flick on the way, the Jerky Boys
seem to have made it a career to boot.
How did it all start?
Kamal: It started as a little boring-we-had
nothing-to-do thing. Me and John were hang
ing out and we had, like, a case of beers and we
were drinking, getting drunk and —
Johnny B. (interrupting): — Actually the first
calls were done sober.
Kamal: Oh yeah, the next day we were drunk.
Anyway John called around — the auto me
chanic thing, 'Pablo Honey,' all that Sol Rosen
berg stuff — bothering a few people. We made
a tape and passed it out to friends and they
passed it out to other people and within a
year's time, like, everyone knew about us. It
just got big like that. This was in the mid
eighties.
Bless the underground, huh?
K: Right, they were underground, then we
came out with the fucking albums.
And does your mother know?
K: Know what?
What you do?
K: Oh sure —she's very proud of me. She's very
proud of what I do. My mom is actually the one
who dubbed us the Jerky Boys. She walked up
to the two of us and said, "Boy have I gotta
name for you." Actually, my mom gave us a few
ideas for skits. She gave me this one idea for
when I did the 'Fava Beans.' If you listen close
ly you can hear my mother on the background
saying, "Tell 'em this. Tell 'em you'll make him
eat his shoe." My mom, my own fucking moth
er. But she's good at that shit
Yup, this time all the one-to-four-minute
phone bits that make up the Jerky Boys'
two albums are mother-approved.
Though mom must be doing something
right. Their second album, "Jerky Boys 2,"
weaseled its way to number 12 on the charts —

the first time ever for a comedy album. After
two years of lingering in the upper echelon of
sales, their first album has been dubbed the
"Dark Side of the Moon" of comedy.
Uh-huh, all this for calling up a crematori
um and asking them if they'll charbroil your
mother befc r e she's dor.e breathing.
Mind you crank calls are something that
have been, to some extent, done before. And
with the Jerky Boys' recent success, they're not
the only ones going at it anymore. Similarly
styled rude-tapes have surfaced en mass, clut
tering the incoming-talent baskets at recording
studios all over the country.
The Jerky Boys' character-voices —
being familiar caricatures — are easily
mimicked, which is good for them in the
pop-culture sense, but bad in terms of the
competition.
Still, their routine isn't meant to be taken
like the Post-It® / "if only I'd thought of that
first I'd be a bazillionaire" phenomenon. To
their minds it's a matter of talent.
There area couple other folks out there doing the

cranking thing.
J: Yeah well let's face
it man, we came out
with this thing in the
mid-eighties. All
kinds of people are riding on our coat
tails right now. There are disk jockeys
that rip us off. They take our skits and
literally do it verbatim. But these guys
make thousands of calls to get one
halfway fucking decent call.

You gonna get back at them or
just let them sit?

J: No man, fuck it. Let 'em
chase us. You know
what happens? The
fans listen and they
may hear a skit and
they go, "Oh man that
shit, it fuckin' sucks."
K: And don't forget,
those other prank callers

that came before us — like you
got that 'Tube Bar' tape or what
ever — they didn't influence us.
We're not anything like those
things. That's like what five-year
olds do. We try to bring, like, little
stories into our skits.

How long have you two known each other?
J: About 20 years.
How old are you?
K: I'm 28.
J: And I'll be 33.1 don't look it, I mean, I still get
proofed for a six-pack.
Is there anything or anyone you won't do?
K: We never call people's homes. We only call
businesses. We'd never call something too off
color, like the police department or hospitals or

fire stations. Nothing like that. Believe it or not
we do have a modus operandi.
Any guidelines?
K: It's like, you don't want to fuck with people's
heads too much.
J: . A good point to make here is that, it's much
more fun to do a twisty, wacko kinda fucking
thing rather than to do a terrorizing thing. I
mean some of the ones we do are terrorizing,
but very few of them. And when they are we
wane it off so that it's not gunna fuck some
body's head up. And remember, we have to get
releases from these people in order to put them
on the album.
So if 1 give you a name and number, you wouldn't
take care of them for me?
K: Truthfully, we don't really do
that. A lot of people want us to but
... Oh man! Did you hear that?
John just laid out a fucking half-minute fart.
I've got it on tape.

And just when you thought there
was an ethic to all this. Now you
can see where some of the contro
versy which surrounds these two starts to form.
Their potty mouths are not for everyone, nor
are the discussions of anal pangs or lodged
potatoes or terrorist bombings.
Already, half the people who started reading
this article about them have counted enough
"fucks" to fold it down in favor of the cross
word puzzle.
Like "Beavis and Butthead," they are best
enjoyed drunk and with a group of friends.
And like "Saturday Night Live," they're much
funnier to quote the next day than they are in
—l i

the original.
For example: it's funnier to call a
friend'Pablo Honey'or to won

der aloud whether you

Obnoxious potty nouths or comedy
phenomenon?

should bring your shoes to the optometrist
than it is to actually hear Johhny B. say it
Doesn't mean they're not
funny at all, rather, that

signed for popularity. In

fact, their brand of (lowest-)
common-denominator humor has spread the
antagonistic gospel from east to west; and
they've kicked the pants off their competition
in the process.
All with a few phone calls.

Is cranking an art form then?
Look at it this way. Our "blue" stuff is very hip
in the sense that it's the dirtiest shit you could
ever hear, but it's not threatening to anyone.

We go into these conversa
tions about ourselves.

We get into this
heavy-duty
fucking sexual
stuff and all

kinds of horrible shit. It'll all be on the
third album.
When will that be coming out?
■ In about a year.
) What's the goal of a call?
: K: Truthfully speaking, everything we do is all
1 spontaneous. We literally just wing it. There's
i no message. There's no nothin'. As a matter of
fact, what makes us laugh the most is when
we're going to call people—say I'm to do
a call—and John will just shout out a number

and I'll just dial it. When it's ringing he'll tell
me that it's, like, a car place or something like
that. I won't even know until the guy gets on
the phone.
And is every one a winner?
K: Believe it or not, we only have 95 calls ever.
And every one of therr is a winner.
J: Actually that's the truth. The only things we
don't put on the albums is some stuff we
don't have cleared and certain things only
we like and everybody else says, "Holy
shit!"

How often do you guys do the calls?
K: Maybe once a year. The record
company says, "Hey guys, we gotta
put out another album." And we go
in ... We don't make all kinds of
prank phone calls, we only have the
95 together. We have some on re
serve, we could do new ones, but,
what the fuck.
And in-between the sessions?
J: We do like what we're doing right
now with you. We're promoting.
Wait up a second. Let's
think about this. This is
