# Violations decrease
## Honor code cases fell 25 percent last year 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
After a dramatic rise two years
ago, the number of Honor Code vio
lations decreased by more than 25
percent last year, according to an
annual summary of misconduct
cases released by the Judicial Af
fairs Office yesterday.
According to the report, 28 inci
dents of Honor Code violations
were reported to the Judicial Af
fairs Office last year.
Though the numbers were down
from a record 40 reported cases in
the 1992-93 academic year, the fig
ures were still higher than in earli
er years. Only 20 Honor Code viola
tions were reported in each of the
1990-91 and 1991-92 school years.
"We don't have an explanation
for the fluctuations from year to
year," said Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole.
The violations included 12 cases
of plagiarism, six of unpermitted
collaboration, four of other unper
mitted aid and three of alterations

to graded work. Charges were even
tually dropped in three of the cases.
Cole noted that the report was
the final product of a long chain of
events. "This is an office statistic.
This does not reflect the extent of
student Honor Code problems,"
she said.
Cole added the decrease is prob
ably due to a change in how often
students report violations.
Specifically, she cited the results
of an Honor Code survey given out
last spring. Many students sur
veyed said they felt dissatisfied
with the Honor Code and stated,
among other things, that it should
be better explained and more
strongly enforced.
"If we didn't have the survey
data, we wouldn't know if the
change in figures reflected a change
in student attitudes [toward cheat
ing] or in students' reporting be
havior," Cole said.
Of the reported violations, the
most came out of computer science
