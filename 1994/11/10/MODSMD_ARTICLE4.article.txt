# Violations decrease
## Honor code cases fell 25 percent last year 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
After a dramatic rise two years
ago, the number of Honor Code vio
lations decreased by more than 25
percent last year, according to an
annual summary of misconduct
cases released by the Judicial Af
fairs Office yesterday.
According to the report, 28 inci
dents of Honor Code violations
were reported to the Judicial Af
fairs Office last year.
Though the numbers were down
from a record 40 reported cases in
the 1992-93 academic year, the fig
ures were still higher than in earli
er years. Only 20 Honor Code viola
tions were reported in each of the
1990-91 and 1991-92 school years.
"We don't have an explanation
for the fluctuations from year to
year," said Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole.
The violations included 12 cases
of plagiarism, six of unpermitted
collaboration, four of other unper
mitted aid and three of alterations

to graded work. Charges were even
tually dropped in three of the cases.
Cole noted that the report was
the final product of a long chain of
events. "This is an office statistic.
This does not reflect the extent of
student Honor Code problems,"
she said.
Cole added the decrease is prob
ably due to a change in how often
students report violations.
Specifically, she cited the results
of an Honor Code survey given out
last spring. Many students sur
veyed said they felt dissatisfied
with the Honor Code and stated,
among other things, that it should
be better explained and more
strongly enforced.
"If we didn't have the survey
data, we wouldn't know if the
change in figures reflected a change
in student attitudes [toward cheat
ing] or in students' reporting be
havior," Cole said.
Of the reported violations, the
most came out of computer science
courses. The 12 cases from that
department involved plagiarism
and unpermitted collaboration.
"This seems to happen every
year," said former Computer Sci
ence Chair Jeffrey Ullman. "People
don't understand that copying a
program is cheating ... and they
assume they can get away with it."
He added that the Computer
Science Department allows people
to consult, but students have to
acknowledge when they get help.
Violations also occurred in biolo
gy, chemistry and CIV courses as
well as in other humanities and

engineering courses.
The majority of violations
involved undergraduates, and
penalties ranged from one-quarter
suspensions to expulsion from the
University.
Fundamental Standard viola
tions stayed rather constant over
the past two years, according to the
report. Twelve cases were brought
to the Judicial AfTairs Office last
year, involving such infractions as
property damage, forgery, altering
a transcript, theft and misrepre
sentation.
Cole said, however, that there
were many more non-academic
behavior problems last year which
were not reported to the Judicial
Affairs Office.
"A very large number of inci

dents are residence problems," she
said. "There is a network of resi
dence deans which handles that."
All of the Fundamental Stan
dard violations were committed by
undergraduates, and 11 of them
were committed by male students.
While final decisions are still
pending in three of the cases,
penalties have included everything
from probation and work penalty
to paying restitution of up to
$2,000.
Of the 42 total misconduct
charges last year, 39 went uncon
tested, and two still have to go
before the Stanford Judicial Coun
cil this year. The remaining case
involved a student who leff the
University last year and has not
returned since the incident.
