"Blowout Comb'
Digable Planets

have experimented with everything from
70s P-Funk to heavy metal in order to
stay on the cutting edge. Perhaps this is
also what made the encounter between
jazz and hip-hop inevitable.
In 1993, two groups launched albums
that would put jazz-influenced rapon the
musical map. Rap duo in
collaboration with several jazz instru
mentalists, opened both mindsiand
pocketbooks with their groundbreaking
release of "Jazzmatazz." Meanwhile, hot
on their heels was a hungry trio of college
kids.
Cool like dat, Craig (Doodlebug) Irv
ing, Ann (Ladybug) Viera and Ishamael
(butterfly) Butler, a.k.a. Digable Planets,
rolled in strapped with their debut album
"Reachin." Collecting props everywhere
from MTV to the NAACP, the crew
emerged as one of the foremost hip-hop
luminaries of 1993.
And there was no gatt-toting or blunt
smoking for these bohemian brothers

and a sister. I heir tools? A horn here, a
stand up bass there, a nostalgic push tor
the "Rebirth of Slick" and a confident
flow that took them from topics like mu
sical theory; to a woman's right to choose
without ever missing a beat.
fliey were clean all right. I hey were
crossover.
Surprise suckas! In their latest re
lease titled "Blowout Comb, you'll
hardly recognize the fresh-laced former
freshmen. 'I he buttoned-up, slicked
back if not somewhat spacey aesthetic
is all but gone. Or» the artists them
selves we now see Afros — big ones —
braids and even dreads, blowout
combs, the kind that fight with any and
every nappy head, litter the album jack
et from cover to cover. Inside are print
ed messages that call for the liberation
of Airican-Amencan political prison
ers, and that promote black self-love
and commitment to action.
It's as if the group had waited and bade
their time before dropping the Afrocen
tricbomb.
And musically, where a jazz-inspired
cool predominated on their first album,
Digable Planets allows the sophomore to
be influenced by the Funk, the whole
Funk, and nothing but the Funk .. .
The net effect is an incredible album
that speaks directly to the minds and
souls of black folk, while still shaking the
funk out of all its listeners. If some of us
wondered where Digable Planets could
go from their übiquitous debut,
"Blowout Comb" is the answer — back to
their proverbial roots and up to the next


musical level.
The album also features some of hip
hop's best. Guru of "Gangstarr" checks in
on "Borough Check," a reflection on the re
alities of Brooklyn life, Jeru the Damaja
comes in on "Graffiti," and acid-jazz diva
Sarah Webb infuses "Dial 7 (Axioms of
Creamy Spies)" with a hypnotically seduc
tive sway. The addition of these artists en
hance and compliment the groove that the

trio created.
On the new album, Digable Planets are
more sure of themselves. Witty word-play
and a laid back, meditative rapping style is
still very much a part of their signature. Yet
playfulness is not all they have in their new
bag of tricks. The party is still on, but poli
tics is right in your face with it. Track after
track, the group proves that they have more
than what it takes survive in hip-hop while
creating consistently arresting music.
Say what you will about their latest trans
formation. Digable Planets is one luminary
that isn't going out.
