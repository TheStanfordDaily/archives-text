# Just another Nirvana album
## 
### 
In a depressing display of commercialism,
Nirvana's last album features an M TV logo on
the cover. It is small and could seem unobtru
sive except for that odious catch phrase of soft
serve marketing, "Unplugged," emblazoned
alongside. The fuz/y pictures on the liner notes

"Unplugged in New York'
Nirvana

of Kurt crooning and strumming smack ot
short-changed elegy, of cheated despair. This
album cannot be mournful, we think. MTV
cannot he allowed to churn out the official Nir
vana in memorial)!.
So surrender any hopes of sentimental
reverie, of where-were-you-when-you-heard?
storytelling, of "I relate, Kurt " weepiness. Ac
cept this record as representative of nothing,
indicative of musical talent, or crushing genius
maybe, but not of a young life lost and definite
ly not of a grave-sent last word on generational

nihilism. Its iList another brilliant Nirvana
album, that's all.
Parts feel too accessible; songs like "Dumb,"
"Polly," and "About a Girl" translate what was
subdued punk into an acoustic whitewash. But
Cobain's voice has never sounded so ragged.
Scratchy, tensioned, and exposed, he subverts
his melodies with wonderful edginess. "Where
Did You Sleep Last Night," an old blues song,
quakes with vocal restraint until the last chorus
when he starts screaming.
It's the covers on this album that work the
best. The three Meat Puppets songs, "Plateau,"
the unbelievable "Oh Me," and "Lake of l ire,'
invigorate with the same seismic punch that
"Smells Like Teen Spirit" had way back when.
Except they're quiet, elegant, ignorant of punk
formulas. Folk songs, all of them.
"Pennyroyal Tea," though, succeeds with a
crushing tunelessness. C.obain plays and sings
without accompaniment, and the chords are
so messy, his voice strained so high that it's
painful to hear. But on this album of near-per
fect catchiness, the wrenching mess is exhila
rating.
