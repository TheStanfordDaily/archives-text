# Russell rocks with his cello
## 
### 
Arthur Russell is the kind of eclectic ge
nius who transcends the standard musical
categorizations of pop rock and classical. An
influential figure in New York's music scene
before his death from AIDS in 1992, he
founded Sleeping Bag Records and pro
duced several innovative hit dance singles.
But Russell's most significant contributions
to music were his own unique compositions
and performances.
"Another Thought" is a collection of Rus
sell's songs from the late '80s. Redefining the
term "classic rock," Russell's dynamic voice
is often accompanied by only a sweetly
singing cello. His background as both a con
servatory-trained cello player and a student
of Indian music enabled Russell to uncanni
ly bridge classical and pop/rock genres.
Recasting the cello as a rock instrument,

"Another Thought"
Arthur Russell

Russell sculpts unheard of sonic landscapes.
Slapping his own four-string to death, Rus
sell and his funk cello guide "See Through
Love," a progressive disco-folk-rock journey
through the realm of — what else but illu
sionary love.
A feedback-like cry opens "Keeping Up,"
in which two guest vocalists layer gorgeous
harmonies over Russell's already soulful
voice. To the pulsation of a percussive cello
beat, Russell and friends whine beautifully.

There is no best track on "Another
Thought" as every song is enchanting in its
own way. Russell's creativity is unparalleled; he
made true alternative music without dabbling
in jazz (the usual thing to do) or gratifying
himself in avant-noise (the self-indulgent
tiling to do). With nearly 900 hours of record
ed music in archive, the genius of Arthur Rus
sell should be explored much further.
