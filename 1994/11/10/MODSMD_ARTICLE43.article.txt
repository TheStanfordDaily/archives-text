# Widespread Panic — there's no alternative to good old rock 'n' roll
## spins 
### 
If you're up for a dose of good old South
ern rock and roll, pick up a copy of Wide
spread Panic's new alburn, "Ain't Life
Grand." The Athens, Georgia-based band's
fourth release is their best recording yet.
Long renowned for being a great live
band, Widespread Panic has finally done an
equally good job of bringing their patented
sound into the studio. All of the tracks were
recorded live, with no splicing and only one
sampled sound — a van door slamming
shut.
As usual, the guitar and keyboard sounds
are very clean, seldom altered by effects and
often purely acoustic. The album is full of
melodies like the acoustic guitar riff on "Air
plane," which will leave you humming long
after the song is over. In addition, Wide
spread has tightened up the their percussion
section as the addition of conga drums and
some Latin-influenced rhythms supply a
slightly jazzier feel.
Widespread shows incredible versatility
on their latest album. They include more

mellow songs such as "Raise the root" and
"Ain't life grand," than on previous albums.
These songs, however, are accompanied by

"Ain't Life Grand''
Widespread Panic

harder upbeat tunes like "Junior" and
"Blackout blues," as well as an instrumental,
"Liza's apartment," and funkier songs.
Widespread's lyrics have never matched
their instrumental talent, but this is another
area in which the band has been coming
more into its own.
Some songs such "Can't get high," speak
of romances gone sour: "Now that you're
gone/ I'm sober every night/1 can't get high/
I can't get it right." For a band that parties as
much as Widespread Panic, those words
carry a lot of weight.
