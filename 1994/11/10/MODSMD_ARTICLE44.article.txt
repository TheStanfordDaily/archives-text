# "Voodoo U" Lords of Acid
## 
### 
Sex is to Lords of Acid as angst is to Nine
Inch Nails. A techno conglomerate consist
ing of Praga Khan, Jade 4 U, Oliver Adams
and others, Lords of Acid is infamous
amongst the rave scene for its carnal nature.
Articles on alternative rave reported that
Lords of Acid's music has been known to
drive ecstasy-crazed ravers to devour each
other in mass orgies. Their last album,
"Lust," included the hits "Rough Sex" and"I
Must Increase My Bust."
Compared to Lords of Acid's new album,
"Voodoo U," "Lust" is tame. The cover art itself
is quite a shocker — a shameless depiction of
nude orange she-devils titillating each other,
complete with purple genitalia.

The album opens with an incredible fury of
techno power. The first three tracks break the
speed limit with BPMs (beats per minute) well
over 100. The title track is a blast of breakbeats
and the characteristic rave drilling sound. The
next song, "Crab Louse" is reminiscent of
"Rough Sex," opening with a seductive and ro
mantic overture, and then suddenly exploding
into a grinding aggro tempo.
Not only is it the most creative song of the
album, it must be the only song in history that
tries to make genital crabs sexy:
1 wanna talk to you about forbidden pleasures of
the flesh/ The most thrilling satisfaction, for all
mankind/ Better than everything you've ever
imagined in your wildest dreams/ The secret of
... the crab louse
The rest of the album explores every aspect
of sex on top of standard techno beats, reggae
heavy metal purees and even in nursery songs.
The music on this album is much more ag
gressive than Lords of Acid's first release, and

the sexual themes border on violent. In most of
the songs, the female voices have been strained
through a vocoder, resulting in a distorted tone
that would only seem seductive to sado
masochists. A new injection into their music,
the band makes use of noise loops and guitars
as both "Young Boys," an anthem for the pe
dophile, and "Dirty Willy" open with heavy
guitar riffs. The results sound like Lords of
Acid asked Metallica to guest star in these
songs — Lords of Acid evolved into an ab
solute frenzy.
Some people praise techno as "pure music,"
since it hinges on the essence of the beat, un
tainted by lyrics. However, Lords of Acid shat
ters that definition by heaping layers upon lay
ers of raw nymphomania on top of their drum
machines. Since it is techno, the music is defi
nitely danceable, but good luck on finding
someone to dance with who won't either be of
fended or want to get into your pants.
