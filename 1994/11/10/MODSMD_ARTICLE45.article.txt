# 'Toward the Within" Dead Can Dance
## 
### 
"Toward the Within," Dead Can Dance's
newest release, is a live album, recorded dur
ing their tour last year. However, of the fit
teen tracks on the CD, only four have ap
peared on previously released albums.
Through the other 1 1 songs, Dead Can
Dance once again displays their indisputable
musical talent.
Dead Can Dance's music is most simply
described as exotic and esoteric. Originally a
goth band, Dead Can Dance quickly evolved
into a supremely artistic mix of cultural
music, starting with elements from Renais
sance Europe and then expanding into every
continent. Its two members, Brendan Perry
and Lisa Gerrard, consistently show their
amazing breadth in a variety of music from

Middle Eastern spirit dances to traditional
Persian songs to Spanish Catalans.
This album takes the listener on a musical
odyssey, starting with "Rakim," a song that
beautifully orchestrates all the elements of
Dead Can Dance's repertoire — Perry's
husky voice, Cierrard's ethereal chanting, in
toxicating percussion and ravishing instru
mentation.
For the next hour, the album travels
through a galaxy of musical worlds, like a
Lollapalooza of world and folk music.
The aspect of Dead Can Dance live that
shines the most is Lisa Cierrard's voice. In
"Sanvean" and "Song of the Sibyl," her voice
takes 011 an extra dimension, a thickness and
power that wraps her vocals in an added
touch of melancholy.
The concert version of "Cantara," Dead
Can Dance's most famous song, is much
more dramatic and intense than the album
version. The tune's steady crescendo resem
bles Ravel's "Bolero," but with a faster pace.

As the song progresses, Lisa Gerrard's vocals
become more and more intense,

enter aggro-chant-mode, and
end in a frenetic climax. v

Ironically, the main
gimmick of the .

album is its only
fault. The audi

ence's applause is
almost insulting.
No matter how I
somber the song, j
the Favlovian au
dience never fails
to raise a mindless

raucous that bor-
ders on annoying. ■
You wonder whether

they are cheering Dead
Can Dance's commercial

coolness, or truly appreciating the
absolute elegance and majesty of their music.
