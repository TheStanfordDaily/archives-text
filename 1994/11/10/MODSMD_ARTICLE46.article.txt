# "four" Blues Traveler
## 
### 
The story of Blues Traveler is an inspira
tional one. John Popper, the band's lead
singer and furious harmonica player, was
temporarily confined to a wheelchair follow
ing a motorcycle crash in 1992 that left him
with broken limbs and profound desire to
sing the blues.
The result of that inspiration is the music
at the focus of the band's latest effort,
"four," a compelling mix of folksy blues and
energetic rock 'n' roll fused together to form
the band's unique interpretation of the
blues.
For years Blues Traveler has held the repu
tation of an incredible touring band that has
never quite been able to capture their live
presence and personality on an album.
While "four" is by no means a concert
album, it contains tracks such as the fast
paced and catchy "Run-around" and the fierv
"Stand" which for the first time transpose the
band's live presence into album form.
There is no theme to this record. Rather, it
can be described as a musical scrapbook with
influences ranging from the Blues Brothers to
Jimi Hendrix. The band successfully synthe
sizes some of the most widely popular types
of music into a distinctive form of fast-paced,
high-energy and immediate music which
today's pervasive sound of keyboards and
drum machines fails to capture.
Yet like most of its work, "four" comes
across as a very hit-or-miss effort. "Crash
Burn" is an absolutely blazing track, capti
vating the listener with the lightning-fast
ability of Popper on harmonica and Chan
Kinchla on lead guitar. The anthem-esque

tune "Fallible" resonates with a

blues-laden accessibility — but
as soon as the band tries to

slow the tempo, the music
falters.

Taken as a whole,
"four" predominantly
i portrays Blues Traveler
| in their best light, a live
I performance atmos
■ phere, but hazes that

I view with an obvious at
tempt to enter the main
stream radio-dominated

arena. Their style is original
and the music, when it works,

is moving — yet the album and

the band's continual evolution still

appear incomplete, keeping a good album
from becoming a great one.
