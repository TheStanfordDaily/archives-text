Try this: Take this CI), put it
in your player, turn up
the bass, and observe.
What you'll experience is
a homemade earthquake

as everything in your room
— and everybody else within
a 500-foot radius — shakes
uncontrollably. The album's
hard-hitting bass could

cause anyone or anything to gyrate uncon
trollably to the music.

The label Moonshine Music once
again brings London hard-core mixes
to the U.S. scene in "Speed Limit 140 ,
BPM, five." These tracks are indeed /

high speed, contain some of th<
fastest dance mixes around and
should not be heard bv the faint

at heart or on a full stomach
"Speed Limit 140 BPM" pro
vides an excellent nonstop
mix for any party and will
guarantee a good time for
those who enjoy dancing to
alternative music.

Darren lay mixes an incredible
variety of work from over 10 dif

ferent deejays most of who
retain the banging drums
and hard-hitting bass of
| London hard-core. New

sounds and voices are
heard throughout the

mixes creating quite a
psychedelic and intense
experience.

SLM's reggae voic
es on "Boof Dem" con
trast with the touch of soul
which is heard in "I'll Be
There" by Just Another

Label. Other songs experiment
with both human voices and
various bass rhythms. When
the mixes do slow down, the
variety adds the music and

creates a time for dancers to
stop for a much-needed breather.

' The main challenge in this
London hard-core collection is
keeping up with the speed of the

music which moves much faster than most ol
what is heard in the U.S. The speed, experi
mentation and combination of the various
styles with a hard-core, banging bass sound
creates an intense, new dance experience.
