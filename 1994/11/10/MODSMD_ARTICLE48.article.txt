## All flash and fire, no substance 'Interview with a Vampire' doesn't meet expectations 
### 
Tom Cruise wanted to he taken seriously.
Neil Jordan wanted to prove lie could com
pete on Hollywood's home ground. Anne
Rice wanted to confound all involved by first
puhlically disowning the project, then hearti
ly endorsing it.
A case of too many personal egos at stake
and too little substance to hold them together
— "Interview With the Vampire" ends up
constipated on a diet rich in pyrotechnical
novelty, but painfully lacking an emotional
center.
For the uninitiated, Rice's source novel is
the opening chapter of the so-called "Vampire

Interview with a Vampire

Chronicles" that introduces the charismatic
L'Estat (Cruise), vampire extraordinnaire
roaming 18th-century New Orleans where he
begins to stalk handsome Louis (Brad Pitt), a
plantation-owner aggrieved by the recent
demise of his wife and child.
Succumbing to L'Estat's invitation, Louis
exchanges unbearable torment for a sensa
tion-free eternity and becomes a vampire

himself. Two hundred years later, Louis is in
terviewed by a fascinated journalist (Christ
ian Slater), and a grisly tale of jugular-hunt
ing and self-preservation unfolds.
As the moral foil to Lestat's relentless sense
of adventure, Louis' conscience prompts him
to refrain from taking human lives for most of
the movie's earlier half. Unfortunately, Pitt is
obviously ill at ease with the myriad philo
sophical waxings demanded by the script,
while Cruise's faltering French accent makes
for unintended amusement.
A much-needed lift in the proceedings ar
rives in the form of the rebellious child vam

pire Claudia, played with

lively abandon by Kirsten Dunst. Together
with Louis and Lestat, who calls Claudia "our
daughter," the trio makes a hilarious, though
decidedly negative role model of gay parent
ing.
But by the time one gets to the ludicrously
overblown confrontation between Louis and
a band of vampires in a Parisian theater
house, any remaining semblance of narrative
coherence is quickly deserted.
Indeed "Interview" is best approached as
an F/X extravaganza, with its literary preten
sions cast well aside.
