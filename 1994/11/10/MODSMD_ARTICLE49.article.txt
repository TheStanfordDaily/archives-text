# It's alive!' Branagh creates a monster of a movie
## 
### 
"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" is director
Kenneth Branagh's recent monster creation.
Branagh, the brilliant director and thespian of
"Henry V" and "Much Ado About Nothing,"
brings yet another literary classic alive on the
silver screen. His direction is stellar and elec-

Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

trie. He captures immense energy in his film,
using just the right combination of special ef
fects and melodrama.
"Frankenstein" is a Gothic tale of blood,
gore and romance, guaranteed "to curdle the
blood and quicken the beatings of the heart."
Branagh himself stars in the lead role ofVictor
Frankenstein, the intelligent yet slightly off
kilter scientist, who experiments with electric
ity and amniotic fluid to create a monster.
Branagh infuses his character with a fire
and passion — he is a mad-man with a mis
sion. In one scene, the young Victor Franken

stein stands over his beloved mother's grave
and painfully pronounces:
"Mother, you need never

die. No one need ever
die — I will stop
this." Branagh

brings honest
emotion to the
role; his Franken
stein is a

deeply trou
bled man,
torn by ,
warring >
passions for
his work
and his beau
tiful fiancee
Elizabeth.

British ac

L ness of her

beth is a

complex char
acter; one mo
ment an elfin
and carefree
girl and then
the next a fiery

sioned woman.
Even the supporting cast of
"Frankenstein" shines with Hol
lywood stars. John Cleese is

Frankenstein's pro fessc> r,
who speaks from his

puipit like a fire-and
brimstone preach
er. Tom Hulce

("Amadeus") is

Henry, Victor Frankenstein's insane yet lovable
medical colleague and best friend. Hulce brings
wit and humor to the gory drama, lightening the
mood and keeping the film from taking itself too
seriously.
Aidan Quinn is Captain Walton, the ad
venturer who finds Frankenstein among the
northern icecaps and to whom Frankenstein
tells his tale. Quinn, whose piercing blue eyes
give him away (disguised otherwise by long
hair and a shaggy beard) is the perfect foil for
Branagh's Frankenstein. Both are ambitious
and driven, yet Walton learns from Franken
stein's mistakes.
Last, but certainly not least, is the master of
monstrosity himself, Robert DeNiro, who plays
Frankenstein's monster creation — "evil
stitched to evil stitched to evil." DeNiro brings
the demonic intensity of his "Cape Fear" role to
"Frankenstein" as a monster both grotesque
and horrible to the extreme. Yet the monster is
poignantly human — he is the beast that no
one understands: "I have love in me, the likes of
which you can scarce imagine — and I have
rage in me, which you would not believe."
