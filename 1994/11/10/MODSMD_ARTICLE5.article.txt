# Pro-art, pro-pornography and definitely not PC
## Paglia argues merits of art 						Continued from front page 
### Samuel Park Contributing writer 
Noted "anti-feminist" intellectual and
media darling Camille Paglia drew laugh
ter, cheers and ovations from a full house at
Kresge Auditorium last night.
In a speech punctuated by exclamations,
exhortations and impersonations, Paglia
criticized everything from elite schools to
schools of feminist thought, attacking gay
activists and progressives along the way.
"Feminists have been stupid in their na
tional campaign, and the result is the back
lash from the far right," Paglia said. "You
haven't been listening to me, so now there's
the cold douche for the nation!"
Gay activists were not spared, either.
"Get out of the ghetto!" she urged. Their
stance against religion, argued Paglia, has
alienated heterosexuals and brought oppo

sition to gays at the school-board level.
"It is suicide for gays to set themselves
against religion," Paglia said.
Paglia portrayed pro-gay groups as
"elitist," and condemned them for treating
their opponents as homophobic "hillbil
lies."
"You can no longer demonize the right,"
Paglia said. "I despise setting gays against
straights. There's no such thing as gay vs.
straight. Everybody has the potential for
homosexual expression."
Speaking the night after Republicans
took control of both houses of Congress in
national elections, Paglia — a libertarian —
said that the Democratic losses demand a
"profound reflection" on the part of pro
gressives.
"We need rapid rethinking of what has
led us to this debacle," Paglia
said.
Paglia pointed out the false
polarities of left versus the right.
"Progressives need to listen to what
the far right is saying," she said.
"We need to realize why we people
are listening to the right. They have
the correct diagnosis, but it's up to
us to help show solutions."
Here to promote her new book,
"Vamps and Tramps," Paglia
criticized Stanford for its politi
cally correct mentality and
mocked the way cultural imperi
alism is emphasized in academia.
Education, for Paglia, should
be "art-centered with homoerotic
elements."
"The moment the beauty of
the male and female body is put
out in the center, there'll be a
softening of Judeo-Christian val
ues," Paglia said.
Paglia spent a large part of the
evening criticizing feminism and
modern feminist theories. She
denied the feminist assumption
that pornography is degrading
and harmful to women.
"It's not patriarchy," Paglia

said. "What pornography shows is
the animal reality of sexuality.
The idea that pornography
degrades us is such a crock. The
hottest pornography is put out by
gay men, and there's no women
there."
She also denied the charge, put
out by feminists such as Cather
ine McKinnon, that rape is
caused by society when it condi
tions men to rape. She ridiculed
McKinnon's assertion that rape
in Bosnia was due to Playboy
magazine.
"The history of civilization is
not about oppressor vs.
oppressed, but that of barbarism
vs. civilization," Paglia said.
"Society protects women against
rape. When social controls break
down, all hell breaks loose."
According to Paglia, there
should be no women's studies and
gay studies programs because
they are too separatist.
Paglia, who at one point
described herself as a "crazy les
bian Amazon feminist," is a pro
fessor of humanities at the Uni
versity of the Arts in Philadel
phia. Her books include "Sexual
Personae: Art and Decadence
from Nefertiti to Emily Dickin
son" and "Sex, Art and American
Culture."
