## Don't forget the Kleenex® 'The War' does nothing more than fight for your tears 
### 
"The War" is a highly engineered vi
sual Hallmark® card tailored to make
mommies coo, cause your mascara to
run and melt your Junior Mints.
It has all the necessary components:
• 2 parts established actor (Kevin
Costner) known for his down-to-earth
sentimentality and "oh, golly" guffaws
• 3 parts up-and-coming child star
(Elijah Wood in a hip crew cut a la Keanu

= only if it's free
= if you've got the money to spare
= certainly worth your while
= a can't-miss

"Speed" Reeves) whose bulging blue eyes
constantly plead for some tenderness
and understanding
• a sprinkling of children in tattered
Osh Kosh B'Gosh® overalls uttering one
liners like: "He was busier than a one
legged man in a butt-kicking contest!"
This Hollywood concoction has been
tailored to make you laugh, make you
cry, make you reflect, make you feel all

warm n' fuzzy
inside...
We can't help
but sense that
we are being
force-fed yet an
other big-studio
formula tear
jerker.
To capture
this tale of a

The War

good family experiencing had times, di
rector Jon Avnet ("Fried Green Toma
toes") returns to a tried-and-true setting
for filmed melodramas, the rural South.
The set is adorned with magnolia trees,
swamps, overgrown ivy, junk yards and
other leftover props from his last film.
In this movie, a war-wrecked father
named Stephen Simmons (Costner)
has returned to his hometown after a
stay in a mental hospital following his
brutal experience in Vietnam. Al
though he can't find a job, he's con
stantly tormented by nightmares and
his family is reduced to living in a wel
fare shack, Stephen continues to preach
tolerance, hope, and understanding to

his son (Wood): "As long as we got
hope there's always a chance." The son
eventually uses his father's teachings
when the town bullies initiate a turf
war over his tree house.
The movie's intent is good, but in
stead of gently presenting a moving tale
about a family's struggle and a child's
rite of passage, "The War" presents a
contrived dose of family values.
Costner's character becomes an all
knowing preacher while Wood's charac
ter develops into a precocious sponge of
his father's wisdom. The film does not
show the subtlety that underlies moral
development. Rather, it assaults you like
an ABC After School Special.
Watch out. "The War"® is a, brand
name tear-jerker that will intentionally
pull your emotional strings.
