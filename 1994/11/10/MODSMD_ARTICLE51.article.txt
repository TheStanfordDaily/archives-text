# Stanford Drama's ’Joe Turner's Come and Gone‘ tells A tale of Those Lost and searching
## 
### Sangeetha Ramanujam 
From the figure ot a mysterious man in
a black coat and hat in a collage,
Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright
August Wilson created Herald Loomis, the
central character of "|oe Turner s Come
and Cone. Director Harry I*lam, Ir. a pro
lessor in the Stanford Drama Department
brought this figure as well as the entire pla\
to life List Friday night at the I ittle Theater.
For two hours, the audience was trans
ported to another America, to a country
where newly treed slaves drifted in search
ol their own identities and a way to connect
with their environment.
The play s action centers around Set h
and Bertha Holly's boardinghouse in the
North, and the characters that enter and
leave it. The visitors to the house are all try
ing to reclaim something that they've lost.
At the heart of the story is one such man,
Herald I.oomis, who arrives at the board
inghouse with his daughter. The two of
them have been wandering the country,
looking lor his wife. His obsession with
this mission leaves him unfeeling to the
outside world, and physically marked by
his fierce glare and melancholy face. While
the audience is drawn to his plight, the play
is not specifically focused 011 his story.
As the setting never changes the play re
volves around the actions and relation
ships between the occupants ot boarding
house. However, the simplicity ot the set
ting, the relatively small cast, and the size
of the theater all bring the characters closr
to the audience, making them seem more
fully alive.
Throughout the piece, Flam effectively
draws on connections to Africa. The

music, mostly blues and spiritual songs, is
almost always present, yet blends with the
plav rather than intruding into it. In the
background, intermingled with the back
drop are tribal faces that loom out into the
audience whenever the lights are dimmed.
They serve as yet another reminder that the
ties to Africa do indeed exist.
I lie performance's only occasional
shorttalling is that the acting, though ex
cellent, is overdone at times. Almost all of
the actors use their hands a great deal
this is appropriate at certain times but dur
ing others it is more of a excess and a dis
traction. There are also brief moments
when the characters seem to get so involved
in producing the dialectical language for
the place and time that the acting seems
forced and almost expressionless. Howev
er, the enthusiasm exhibited by the whole
cast makes up for these few weaknesses.
Watching this play, it's very easy to
get caught up in the humor and
the apparent simplicity of the plot.
Hut the themes go much deeper. Laced in
with the comedy is a sense of desperation
and the cast emphasizes the serious aspects
effectively. This desperation is brought on
by the feeling of complete hopelessness,
that the characters will never get further in
life.
"He told me I was worthless," Herald
Loomis says. This is a feeling that reverber
ates through all of the characters — a no
tion that they might indeed be at fault for
not making anything of their lives, for not
fitting in.
And that is the theme of the story. It is
about more than a bunch of folks wander
ing in and out of a boardinghouse. The
play tells of a people displaced, searching.
"Seems like everybody looking for some
thing," Bynum says, accurately describing
the situations of .ill the characters.
They're all searching tor their own iden
tities, their "song" as Bynum calls it
throughout the play. Nowhere is this more
evident than in the figure of Loomis.
Moody and confused, he has spent 1 1 years
in search of his wife, hoping that when he
finds her, he'll have found his place in the
world. "The world has to start somewhere,"

he says and for him, life has been a constant
search from the beginning.
Freshman Sterling Brown is perfect for
the part, walking around in a seeming daze
for much of the play. His words usually
come out in abrupt shouts and the look of
defiance never quite leaves his eyes. Brown

captures the essence of a
haunted and enigmatic

man.
But »is lar .is acting
goes, it is graduate
student Willi a m
franklin as Bynum
Walker who makes a
lasting impression.
Granted, Bynum's i
part itself leaves J
plenty of room for 1
interpretation and
amusement, but
that wouldn't

have been
enough —
Franklin's
skill
brings
every

thing together in Bynum: the talent, the en
thusiasm, the consistency, even the hand
gestures.
"Joe Turner's Come and Gone" is a play
about people finding inner peace and a pur
pose to existence, tor "life don't mean noth
ing unless it got meaning." It's about realiz
ing how much they already possess. "...
When a man forgets his song he goes off in
search of it ... till he finds out he got it
with him all the time." It strikes a chord
within all of us and is definitely worth see
ing. ■
