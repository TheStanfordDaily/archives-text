Bullets Over Broadway
Woody Allen's latest film, "Bullets
over Broadway," manages to hit its
target, but fails to strike the bull's
eye. While the cast delivers genuine
and captivating performances,
Allen's heavy-handed writing seems
to cast a shadow over the whole pro
duction.
The film is set in New York during the

1920s and centers around the world
of gangsters and, believe it or not,
the theater. John Cusack stars as
struggling playwright David Shayne,
who has the uncanny ability to write
intensely deep plays that flop. The
movie overall delivers a good bit of
humor backed up by excellent cast
ing and sincere dialogue. The act
ing, however, gets bogged down by
extra subplots and Allen's over-writ
ten script.
Clerks
In the no-budget, guerrilla-indepen
dent tradition of "She's Gotta Have
It"and the more recent "El Mariachi,"
Kevin Smith's "Clerks" hands out an
other slap in the face to studio exec
utives who prefer the convenience of
judging talent by its price tag. Made
for less money than the catering bill
for most major Hollywood produc
tions — $27,575 to be exact — this
black-and-white-shot venture looks
cheap, talks fast and plays tough.
Vile, remorseless and engaging all at
once, "Clerks" is quite simply the
most audacious American comedy
to hit the screens thus far this year.
Love Affair
Even before "Sleepless in Seattle"
re-popularized the film, "An Affair to
Remember" was a classic, guaran

teed to make you cry and view the
Empire State Building as most ro
mantic piece of architecture this
side of Las Vegas. "Love Affair" is a
not-so-timely remake of the 1957
Cary Grant-Deborah Kerr weepe,
this time starring real-life husband
and wife Annette Bening and Warren
Beatty. The movie sticks pretty close
to the original, especially at the end,
changing only the time period and
characters' professions. A classic
script and strong acting qualify
"Love Affair" as a decent movie, es
pecially for the romantic. However,
the problem is this: Why pay $7.50
to see a paler version of a great film
one can rent for $3.15?
New Nightmare
Writer-director Wes Craven, the cre
ator of "A Nightmare on Elm Street,"
has finally proven that a bad idea
sometimes never dies. In the latest
addition to the "Nightmare" series,
"New Nightmare," the evil Freddy
Krueger (Robert Englund) returns to
terrorize Heather Langenkamp
(played by herself) in an uninspired
re-hashing of the original story. Only
this time the premise is even flimsier
than usual.
Only You
Move "Sleepless in Seattle" into

Rome, and you've got "Only You,"
starring Robert Downey Jr. and
Marisa Tomei. Perfectly cast as the
star-crossed lovers, Tomei and
Downey's chemistry lights up the
screen. For Downey, "Only You" is
familiar territory; the film is similar to
his other magical, romantic come
dies, such as "Heart and Souls" and
"Chances Are." Tomei also displays
a great feel for comedy, and the
screenplay showcases her abundant
natural charm. At once sweet and
funny, "Only You" is definitely a
heart-warming movie.
Go see it — maybe you'll meet the
one you're destined for in the pop
corn line.
Pulp Fiction
It's good.
Damn good.
See it.
Now.
Radioland Murders
When George Lucas produced a film
in 1986 by veteran writers Willard
Huyck and Gloria Katz, the result
was the much-anticipated but em
barrassing flop, "Howard the Duck."
Now, almost a decade later, and with
the addition of two more writers, the
same team returns with another dis
appointing comedy. Only this time

the subject is the behind-the-scenes
chaos of a 1930'5-style radio net
work. In the hands of director Mel
Smith ("The Tall Guy"), "Radioland
Murders" races along in a frenzy of
slapstick falls, impossible predica
ments, silly mix-ups, and worn-out
gags, all of which seem lifted from a
bad B-movie.
Stargate
"Stargate" may have broken the Oc
tober box office record last weekend
but the movie did not break any bar
riers in science fiction advancement.
Most of the concepts, characteriza
tions and plot twists were borrowed
from other action and sci-fi films.
"Stargate" stars James Spader and
Kurt Russell as two men who travel
through an ancient transporter into a
world millions of light years away
from Earth to search for alternate civ
ilizations. By allowing another world
direct access to Earth, the Stargate
ends up endangering the entire
planet. The film, directed by Roland
Emmerich, is an entertaining two
hours, but it recalls too many ele
ments of such classics as the "Indi
ana Jones" trilogy. In the end, "Star
gate" blends in with every other
hero-girl-villain flick that makes up
that stew of unmemorable science
fiction.
