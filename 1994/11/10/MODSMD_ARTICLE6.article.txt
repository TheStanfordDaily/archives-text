A suspect has been identified as the dri
ver who cut off the van carrying eight Stan
ford students on Oct. 20 â€” resulting in an
accident that killed one student and injured
another, said a California Highway Patrol
traffic officer.
The accident occurred when sophomore
Selena Saunders swerved to avoid the car
that cut her off. Her van then skidded,
crashed into a guardrail and overturned
near the intersection of highways 880 and
92. Saunders claims to have no memory of

the accident, according to freshman
Chrichelle McCloud, one of the passengers
in the van.
Stanford sophomore Jessica Williams
was killed in the crash, and junior Tamecca
Nichole Hicks was seriously injured when
the two were thrown from the vehicle.
Hicks, who has been in Castro Valley's
Eden Medical Center since the accident,
had reconstructive surgery on her forehead
yesterday morning and may be released
early next week. Williams' funeral was held
Oct. 28; a memorial service will be held on
campus Nov. 21.
Outside witnesses have report
ed that the driver of the other
vehicle needlessly braked after
cutting Saunders off, McCloud
said.
"I am sure the accident was
malicious," she said.
Saunders and the surviving
passengers are still coping with
the accident's aftermath. "I am
upset with losing a friend," Saun
ders said. "I am upset that Nicole
is still hurt. I am upset with the
guy driving the other car."
Hicks said she has not had
time to think about the accident
and does not clearly remember it.
She is "just trying to concentrate
on getting better," she said.
Hicks added she plans to take
the quarter off to recover at home
in Dallas, Texas, and will return

to Stanford next quarter.
The case has been submitted
to the Fremont District Attor
ney's office, who will review it
and decide whether and what
charges to press, said the CHP
officer. The district attorney
apparently hasn't started work
ing on the case yet, but it has
been submitted, he added.
McCloud said she hopes the
driver "has to serve some time
and [that] people know who he
is." She added she hopes that the
other driver is at least tried for
vehicular manslaughter. "I hope
he [the attorney] gives them the
maximum amount of charges."
If charges are brought against
the offending driver, the van pas
sengers may be considered wit
nesses to the accident.
"I try to take it day by day but
there isn't a day that goes by
when I don't think about it,"
Saunders said. "It helps that
we're all sticking together and
supporting each other."
