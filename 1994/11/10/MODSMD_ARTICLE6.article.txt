A suspect has been identified as the dri
ver who cut off the van carrying eight Stan
ford students on Oct. 20 â€” resulting in an
accident that killed one student and injured
another, said a California Highway Patrol
traffic officer.
The accident occurred when sophomore
Selena Saunders swerved to avoid the car
that cut her off. Her van then skidded,
crashed into a guardrail and overturned
near the intersection of highways 880 and
92. Saunders claims to have no memory of

the accident, according to freshman
Chrichelle McCloud, one of the passengers
in the van.
Stanford sophomore Jessica Williams
was killed in the crash, and junior Tamecca
Nichole Hicks was seriously injured when
the two were thrown from the vehicle.
Hicks, who has been in Castro Valley's
Eden Medical Center since the accident,
had reconstructive surgery on her forehead
yesterday morning and may be released
early next week. Williams' funeral was held
Oct. 28; a memorial service will be held on
campus Nov. 21.
