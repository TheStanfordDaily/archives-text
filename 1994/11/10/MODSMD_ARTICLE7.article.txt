### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Addressing members of the student
media yesterday, University President
Gerhard Casper spoke about such is
sues as the results of Tuesday's elec
tion, the University budget and alumni
donations.
During the hour-long interview at
the Lou Henry Hoover House, Casper
fielded questions from representatives
from KZSU and The Daily. The press
conference was broadcast live by the
campus radio station.
Reflecting on Tuesday's election,
Casper said he was unsure about what
effect the passage of Proposition 187
will have on Stanford.
"I have no idea yet because nobody
has really done a detailed analysis of
where effects might be," he said.
Proposition 187 — which will deny
health care and other social services to
illegal immigrants — probably won't
have any immediate effects on the Uni
versity because legal issues surround
ing the measure still need to be re
solved, Casper said.
But he added that an area likely to be
affected by the measure is Stanford
Health Services, which accepts public
patients and federal funds and is there
fore subject to the proposition.
Casper said his main goals for the
year include trimming $ 12 million from
the University's operating budget and
increasing alumni giving rates.
"One of our major challenges now
will be to see if we can reduce any of the
administrative overheads in the con
stituent parts of the University, such as
the departments and schools," he said.
Over the last five years the Universi
ty's central administration has reduced

expenditures "in real terms" by 10 per
cent, and the major task now is to make
sure the constituent parts are as "effec
tive and lean," he said.
Speaking about alumni giving rates,
Casper said he has had a "long-time"
concern about poor alumni support for
the University.
Although the giving rate has in
creased from 25 to 30 percent in the last
year, Casper said alumni participation

still must increase
substantially.
This need to in
crease alumni sup
port prompted the
University to develop
a new, unrestricted
Stanford Fund and to
implement a policy
that restricts student
groups from directly
soliciting alumni do
nations, he said.
Instead of con
tributing to individ
ual organizations,
alumni will be en
couraged to donate to
the Stanford Fund —
a "concentrated" ap
proach which will
hopefully net more
unrestricted funds
for the University,
Casper said.
"Stanford alumni
were solicited zillions
of times during the
course of the year by
various parts of Stan
ford without any co
ordination and any
effort to bring it to
gether," he said. "So,

they developed a very thick skin."
The new policy doesn't prevent stu
dent groups from soliciting alumni do
nations altogether, Casper said. In
stead student groups must limit their
solicitations to alumni who have con
tributed to their organization within
the last five years.
