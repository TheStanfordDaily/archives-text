SAN FRANCISCO BAY IS CLOSER THAN YOU THINK; IT NEEDS YOUR HELP!
The rainy season is here and the campus storm drain system is vulnerable to pollutants. All water and materials that enter storm drains
flow directly into local creeks and to the Bay. Here's how you can help:
Don't rinse soap from your car near storm drains; wash it
Dispose of empty or partly empty oil, paint or toxic
materials' containers properly, not in parking lots or near
gutters or storm drains.
Check for leaks under your car. Regular service helps
prevent fluid leakage.
Prevent spills when changing motor oil or draining
antifreeze; use large drip pans, collect fluids in a
container and recycle.
