# Students ready to fight 187

### Crystal Carreon Contributing writer 
Following the passage of
Proposition 187 Tuesday night,
several Stanford students are now
initiating a campaign to counter
the new law.
About 50 students gathered at
the Asian American Activities
Center late Wednesday night to
vent their frustrations and con
cerns, as well as to discuss ways to
continue their efforts against the
anti-immigration measure. An
other meeting will be held Sunday
afternoon in the same location.
"I feel as though everything
that was said and done did not
matter," said senior Jason Pu,
who helped organize the meeting.
"It's time to come together and
think of what to do, think of the
next step. The fight's not over," he
said.
Students are considering start
ing a letter-writing campaign to
national news organizations and
establishing a network with other
universities and off-campus orga
nizations to fight the new law.
They also suggested mobilizing
a committee to offer legal counsel
ing and health services to illegal
immigrants who may be denied
access if the law is put into effect.
A possible long-term goal is to
create an "underground school."
"We have our education, we
can fight using our education,"
said senior Emma Luevano, a
member of the former STOP 187
organization.
"Although we expressed our
fear and anger about the passing
of the proposition, we all agreed
that we have a definite role to
play," she said. "We can change
this."
Although the efforts of STOP
187 failed at the ballot box,
Sophomore Vanessa Frank said
that the student groups did win
in some ways — they united.
"It didn't make me feel very
good that it passed, but it is good
to see the coalitions that have
formed as a result of this proposi
tion," she said.
The meeting Wednesday night
was organized by former mem
bers of STOP 187, which led cam
pus efforts against the measure.
