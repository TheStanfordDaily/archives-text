## Jordan's King Hussein visits Israel 
### 
ZEMACH, Israel (AP) â€” Shaking
hands with well-wishers and kissing a
baby, Jordan's King Hussein put a
warm human face on his peace treaty
with Israel yesterday, becoming only
the second Arab leader to publicly visit
the Jewish state.
Hussein arrived in northern Israel
by helicopter and spent nearly three
hours talking with Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin. He promised he would
visit Jerusalem soon, but gave no date.
While the peace treaty preserved the
Jordanian king's nominal control over
Muslim holy sites in east Jerusalem, the
Palestinians, who see east Jerusalem as
the capital of their future state, want
that role for themselves. A visit by Hus
sein to Jerusalem could provoke vio
lence.
The king took a 10-minute stroll
from the helicopter pad to the nearby
Beit Gavriel cultural center on the

shores of the Sea of Galilee, where the
Bible says Jesus walked on the water.
He shook hands with an Israeli army
officer and students in a crowd of sever
jil hundred that gathered to see him. He
also stopped to kiss a baby girl.
It was Hussein's first public visit to a
country he has often visited secretly. He
is the only Arab leader besides the late
Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat, to
openly visit the Jewish state. Sadat was
assassinated on Oct. 6, 1981, by Islamic
militants opposed to peace with Israel.
I lussein said the Israeli and Jordani
an people are on the "threshold of a
peace which I hope generations to come
will cherish, protect and enjoy." He
called the treaty an "honorable peace, a
balanced peace."
The treaty was signed Oct. 26 in the
presence of President Clinton at the
Arava border crossing in southern
Israel. Hussein stayed on his side of the

border and did not enter Israel during
that ceremony.
Speaking only a few miles from the
Golan Heights that Israel seized from
Syria in the 1967 Mideast war, Rabin
said he hoped the agreement would give
momentum to talks with Syria and
Lebanon.
Before the king arrived, the two coun
tries opened a new border crossing at
Sheik Hussein Bridge, 13 miles south of
Zemach, one of four links opened since
the two countries ended 46 years of war.
Israeli and Jordanian schoolgirls
presented bouquets of flowers, and a
squadron of Jordanian and Israeli sin
gle-engine planes flew overhead trailing
a banner that proclaimed peace in three
languages: "Shalom, Peace, Salaam."
"Who does not love peace?" asked
55-year-old Jordanian farmer Talal el-
Ghazawi. "We have waited for this
moment for 50 years."
