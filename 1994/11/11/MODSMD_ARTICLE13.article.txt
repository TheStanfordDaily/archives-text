Bosnian violations
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)
— The United Nations accused the Muslim
led government yesterday of firing shells on
its own territory, apparently to provoke a
response against the Bosnian Serbs.
Lt. Col. Jacques Lechevallier told
reporters that analysis of the shell craters
from two 80-millimeter mortars fired last
Tuesday on a Sarajevo neighborhood
showed they came from government posi
tions. One person was wounded in the
attack.
There was no response to the accusation
from the Bosnian government.
Iraq recognizes Kuwait
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — In a bid to end
debilitating international sanctions, Iraq

formally recognized Kuwait today and
dropped a territorial claim that led to the
1990 invasion of the emirate.
The Iraqi state news agency said Iraq's
parliament conferred formal recognition of
Kuwait's existence during a special session
today, the first time since Kuwait's inde
pendence 33 years ago that Baghdad recog
nized its southern neighbor.
Iraq's National Assembly "supports
Iraq's recognition of the sovereignty of the
state of Kuwait, its territorial integrity and
its independence," said a statement carried
by the official Iraqi News Agency,
Saddam Hussein's ruling Revolutionary
Command Council endorsed the bill right
afterwards. According to the news agency,
the recognition was effective immediately
and would be published in the official
Gazette to make it legal.
