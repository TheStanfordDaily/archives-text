STANFORD HAS ALWAYS
been on the fast track. After
only a century, Stanford has
positioned itself as one of the top
universities in the country —
alongside its East Coast counter
parts who are 200 and 300 years
old.
At the same time, Stanford is
often called more pioneering and
forward-looking than its col
leagues, as evidenced by its success
in such emerging fields as engi
neering and high-tech business.
This ability to recognize and
fund what will be important in the
future is one of Stanford's greatest
talents. And now, as the Universi
ty works diligently to create a
scholarship program at Stanford
— modeled after the Rhodes
Scholarships at Oxford University
— for Asian students, it can once
again be commended for having
the foresight to reach out to the
fastest-growing region in the

world.
The program would make Stan
ford a truly international universi
ty and would benefit both Asia and
Stanford. Students who came to
study here would receive an
unparalleled education (None of
the top 10-ranked research univer
sities in the world are in Asia), and
Stanford would increase its pres
tige and alumni base on the Pacific
Rim.
Currently, the program is only a
vision because about $40 million
more needs to be raised ($7 million
has been raised thus far). Hopeful
ly, lots of alumni support and
donations from prominent Asians
will have the program up and run
ning in a few years.
Although it may not be an
immediate success, in all likeli
hood the Asia/Pacific Scholars Pro
gram will pay off for Stanford,
making it the ultimate goal for
students throughout Asia.
