# The 						Bonfire is back
## 
### 
FOR A WHILE, it appeared
that Big Game festivities
would have to survive with
out the monumental Big Game
Bonfire for the second year in a
row. Much to the surprise and
delight of students, however, the
Stanford Axe Committee recently
announced that this year's cele
bration, scheduled after the Nov.
17 performance of Big Game Gai
eties, will culminate in the tradi
tional rally complete with a bon
fire.
The bonfire, usually held in
the Lagunita lake bed, was can
celed last year due to concerns
about the threat the bonfire
posed to the California tiger sala
mander, as well as the effects of
the pollution created by such a
massive blaze. In its place, the
Axe Committee sponsored a laser
show on the side of Hoover
Tower. A disappointment to most
students, the lackluster light dis
play dampened rather than

roused the general spirit.
This year, the bonfire will be
considerably smaller than its
previous 15-story stature and
will be held at Arrillaga Plaza.
But it is still sure to excite Stan
ford students for Big Game,
offering a chance for them to
cheer a little at home before
trekking to Berkeley.
Also, to make up for the small
er size of the fire, the Axe Com
mittee is focusing more on enter
taining students through perfor
mances. The rally will feature
the Stanford Band, several a
cappella groups and special
guests.
After a less-than-spectacular
football season for the Cardinal,
the bonfire will help students
revive a flagging school spirit
and will hopefully help inspire
the team enough to regain the
Axe. So now that we have the
bonfire back, who's ready to
roast some Weenies?
