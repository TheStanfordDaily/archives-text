## Gerhard Casper The 						Review’s different shades of Grey 
### 
SINCE 1896, THE
Fundamental Stan
dard has been the
rule of student conduct
at Stanford. It says:
"Students at Stanford
are expected to show
both within and without
the University such
respect for order, morali-

ty, personal honor and the rights of others
as is demanded of good citizens. Failure to
do this will be sufficient cause for removal
from the University."
As a private institution, Stanford is cer
tainly in its right to ask those who choose
to join the University of their free will to
abide by its standards.
In 1990, after 18 months of discussion
and debate, the Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council adopted an "interpretation" of
the Fundamental Standard. Law Prof.
Thomas Grey had surveyed the boundaries
between free expression and discriminato
ry harassment and recommended a line of
demarcation — what became known as the
Grey Interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard.
Some portray the Grey Interpretation
as inhibiting free expression. However, it
also can be viewed as protecting expression
by distinguishing more precisely between
the permissible and the impermissible
under a Fundamental Standard that oth
erwise relies on the general concept of
"good citizenship."
Ironically, students associated with The

Stanford Review currently find themselves
on both sides of the fence.
Last May, in accord with the highly
unwise and undesirable trend of turning
every campus issue into a legal matter,
nine such students filed a lawsuit charging
that the Grey Interpretation violates the
First Amendment and California law and
improperly inhibits their speech. The Uni
versity currently is spending scarce finan
cial resources to defend against this suit.
Meanwhile, The Review's editors this
fall instituted a feature called "Smoke Sig
nals," bearing a caricature of a Native
American. Though many find the carica
ture distasteful, The Review is protected
from disciplinary action by none other than
the specificity of the Grey Interpretation.
As the interpretation states:
"Students have the right to hold and
vigorously defend and promote their opin
ions, thus entering them into the life of the
University, there to flourish or wither
according to their merits. Respect for this
right requires that students tolerate even
expression of opinions which they find
abhorrent."
It goes on (emphasis added):
"Speech or other expression constitutes
harassment by personal vilification if it: a) is
intended to insult or stigmatize an individu
al or a small number of individuals on the
basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or national or eth
nic origin; and b) is addressed directly to the
individual or individuals whom it insults or
stigmatizes; and c) makes use of insulting

or 'fighting' words or nonverbal symbols."
The U.S. Supreme Court has held that
"fighting words" are not protected by the
First Amendment. I emphasize the "ands"
because not only fighting words but all
three conditions must be present before
the interpretation allows disciplinary
action.
If for no other reason than that The
Review caricature is not addressed directly
to individuals, its purveyors are protected
from student discipline by the very Grey
Interpretation they seek to eliminate.
I believe The Review's editors are, in
fact, not addressing the caricature to
American Indians at all, but rather to the
University for having eliminated the Indi
an mascot 22 years ago. Knowing full well
that the Indian will not return, they are
using this caricature to thumb their noses,
to try to get a rise out of us and to garner
support from those alumni who continue
to miss the Indian. Alas, they seem not to
understand the crucial difference between
being provocative and being insulting.
Under the circumstances this carica
ture is insulting. In explaining his position
that the Indian should be discontinued as
Stanford's mascot (a position supported by
the ASSU Senate 18-4 in a 1972 vote), for
mer University President Richard Lyman
told The Review two years ago: "I pon
dered whether one has any business mak
ing a football mascot out of an ethnic
group, or for that matter telling such a

group that in our superior wis
dom we had concluded that
they were wrong to feel offend
ed."
Every person at Stanford is

different, and we should avoid
reinforcing standardized mental
pictures that represent an affec
tive attitude towards whatever
one's origins may be. An
acquaintance of mine who had
come to the United States
through various way stations
from Eastern Europe once said:
"I would go back to where I came
from, if I hadn't come from so

many places." Each one of us is
actually "multicultural," has
come from "so many places" that
stereotyping, in addition to
being insulting, is pointless.
In accordance with the Uni
versity's commitment to unin
hibited, robust and wide-open
debate, those who agree with
me should engage The Review
on the issue.
