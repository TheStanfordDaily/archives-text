A pattern of oppression in India's policies toward Sikhs

After sifting through
Madan Kumar's various degrees of
condescension in his Nov. 10 letter
to the Daily, I found some statements
that I would like to rebut. One of the
founding principles of the Sikh religion is
one of self-defense and defense for those
who are being wrongfully harmed. It is
for this reason that the British used to
say, "Sikhs can be your worst enemy or
your best friend." When the prime minis
ter of India ordered an attack on the most
sacred Sikh temple on the holiest day of
the year, Sikhs all over the world took
that as an attack to their livelihood and
became India's worst enemy. For this
reason, what Indira Gandhi's body
guards, Beant Singh and Satwant Singh,
did was an act of self-defense and martyr
dom.
Secondly, please remember that the
assassination of Indira Gandhi was an
act planned and committed by two indi
viduals, whereas the Delhi riots ensuing
Mrs. Gandhi's assassination were coordi

nated by the Indian government. In fact,
three members of the Indian parliament
have admitted to participating in the
brutal slayings of innocent Sikhs in
Delhi. Not surprisingly, those three
members of parliament have yet to have
charges pressed against them. Mean
while, Punjab is the only state in which
the Terrorist and Detainment Activities
Act applies. Under this act, the police can
apprehend any Sikh they fancy and hold
him or her without trial and without
cause for up to two years (earlier I had
wrongfully stated the time as one year).
It cannot be denied that there are
Sikh militants who are harming inno
cent individuals. However, what the gov
ernment is doing is harming the very
people they are supposed to represent.
Furthermore, the anger of the Sikhs has
to be expected after years of tyranny.
I must admit to the mistake of refer
ring to the state of Tamil Nadu as Tamil.
Yet, I refuse to believe that the people of
Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil

Nadu, Agra and Nagaland (ail states in
India) would fight for their indepen
dence if they were being properly repre
sented. As for Kumar's accusations that
I lied about the recognition of the Pun
jabi language and elections in Punjab, I
would have to disagree.
First and foremost, I stated, "Upon
the writing of the Indian constitution,
the Sikhs were not recognized as an
independent religion, but as a sect of
Hinduism. Furthermore, Punjabi, a pre
dominantly Sikh language, was not rec
ognized while numerous small Hindi
dialects were." What I stated is 100 per
cent correct. It took the Indian govern
ment until the 1970s to recognize the
Punjabi language. Moreover, as of now,
the Sikh religion is still recognized as a
sect of Hinduism.
Finally, I stated, "Since Oct. 31,1984,
Punjab has been under military rule and
has not had full elections." Once again, I
am 100 percent correct. The majority of
the Sikh people have refused to vote

since 1984 for several reasons. The most
obvious is pressure from the military and
Punjab police. Being a majority in Pun
jab, the Sikhs could easily elect sepa
ratist representatives, which is what the
Indian government is afraid of. Second,
the Sikh people have lost faith in the
Indian way of "democracy" due to past
experiences of rigged elections. Finally,
as Kumar himself stated, elections have
only been held twice in the last six years.
What kind of democracy is that?
I ask Kumar next time not to distort
the simple facts, but to deal with the
issue of India's attempt to destroy the
Sikh people. In fact, I agree with Kumar
that there needs to be an educated dis
cussion of the facts. For this reason,
there is a panel discussion titled "Politi
cal Unrest in Punjab India: the Different
Perspectives" on Sunday, Nov. 13 from
1 to 3 p.m. in Tresidder Oak Lounge
East.
