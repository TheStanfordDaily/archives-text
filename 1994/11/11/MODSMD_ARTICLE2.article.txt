## Peace corps tries for more recruits 
### Laura Shin Staff writer 
In an effort to drum up support for
the Peace Corps, deputy director
Charles Baquet visited Stanford yes
terday to discuss recruiting strate
gies with professors and administra
tors.
Baquet said he wanted to thank
the University for being a "very gen
erous" provider of volunteers and
talked about ways to continue and ex
pand Stanford's strong recruitment
record.

Stuart Moran, the area manager of the Peace
Corps' recruitment office in San Francisco, also joined
Baquet in three separate meetings with the heads of
the Political Science Department, the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center and the Graduate School
of Business' career development office.
Prof. Lucius Barker, chair of the Political Science
Department, called the effort to meet with depart
ment chairs "a new technique" in the recruitment


Baquet
strategy of the corps.
Baquet said he and Barker dis
cussed various volunteer possibil
ities for political science students,
including working in youth-at
risk programs and helping with
community development.
He said a professor like Barker,
who has direct contact with stu
dents and is "sufficiently knowl
edgeable about the Peace Corps,"
can help recommend qualified
students to the organization.
With 13 Peace Corps offices
nationwide, it is difficult for each
office to seek out individual stu
dents at every school in its dis

trict, he said.
For instance, the San Francis
co office oversees the recruitment
at all the schools in California,
Nevada and Oregon — a large
region that can be easily covered
by "professors [whoj know the
students very well and know their
abilities," Baquet said.
The Peace Corps, however, is
not simply focusing on under
graduate students. Baquet and
Moran also met with Sheri
Taguchi of career development
office in the Business School.
They are primarily recruiting
people with business or law back
grounds who could work in devel
oping areas such as central
Europe, Russia and Asia.
Ruth Schneider, director of the
Career Planning and Placement

Center, also met with Baquet and
Moran. She said that in their
visit, the two representatives
tried to "dispel a myth that the
Peace Corps looks only for techni
cal majors."
The Peace Corps is trying to
recruit more volunteers this year
and increase its volunteer staff
from 6,500 to 7,500 in order to
meet needs in several Eastern
European countries which have
been asking for more help. The
Peace Corps' budget has also
increased.
In the past, California has pro
vided the most volunteers nation
wide, with UC-Berkeley enlisting
the most volunteers, followed by
Humboldt State University and
Stanford third, with 14 volun
teers this year, Baquet said.
