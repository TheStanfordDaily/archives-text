## Frost slated to QB against the Ducks 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Stanford, meet Scott Frost.
Scott Frost, Stanford. Now that
introductions are out of the way,
it's time for football.
Saddled with the loss of
senior Steve Stenstrom to a bro
ken finger, head coach Bill Walsh
now hands the reins of one of the
most complex offenses in the
country over to the athletic
sophomore from Wood River,
Neb.
However, it is not as if the
Cardinal (3-5-1, 2-4 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) is com
pletely at a loss for Saturday's
game against the Ducks (7-3, 5-
1) at 3:30 p.m. at Stanford Sta
dium. Frost steps in for the
Cardinal to run one of the
nation's top offenses after
guiding Stanford to a remark
able 46-28 win over Washing
ton last weekend. And based on
his performance in the second
half against the Huskies, few
should doubt the sophomore's
ability.
"It was frightening," said
Oregon head coach Rich Brooks.
"I was extremely impressed by
how Stanford dominated a very
talented Washington team."
While the rainy conditions
limited his chances to throw,
Frost's feet made up for the lack
of a typical Stanford aerial
assault as he gained 88 yards on
just 11 carries. The two passes
(out of eight) that he did com
plete both came on important
third down plays.

"I came to Stanford to learn
how to do the precision passing,"
Frost said. "There's nothing
wrong with using the abilities I
have, but hopefully as I get more
experienced, I'll do that less and
less."
And if the Stanford offensive
line and defense play like they
did against the Huskies, much of
the pressure will be taken off
Frost to produce Stenstrom-like
numbers. While the offense has
averaged 463 yards per game
under Stenstrom's guidance, an
emerging running attack behind
freshman Anthony Bookman
has supplemented the Cardinal's
top-rated passing game in the
Pac-10.
"We've been a finesse team
for awhile and I think we will
continue to be a finesse team,"
Frost said. "But you can't win
when you get physically beaten,
and in the second half we physi
cally beat Washington. That
makes my job easy."
Thanks to Bookman and the
play of the offensive line, Stan
ford has averaged 173 yards on
the ground over the past four
games. In those games, the
speedy Bookman has averaged
105 yards a game and has scored
six touchdowns.
Even with the switch at quar
terback, Walsh foresees little
change in the offensive game
plan. Frost has been tabbed as
Stenstrom's successor ever since
he stepped foot on campus and
has been preparing for this day

for two years.
"I think it will look a lot like the
old Stanford offense of the first
nine games," senior offensive tack
le Seth Dittman said, echoing
Walsh's sentiments.
Except for Stenstrom, most of
the injuries plaguing the team have
healed. Junior defensive end Pete
Swanson and sophomore corner
back Eliel Swinton returned to
action last week, and Walsh said
sophomore linebacker Brian Bat
son may see playing time against
Oregon after recovering from a
broken right fibula against Notre
Dame.
Oregon comes to Stanford Sta

dium as the surprise team in a wild
race toward the Rose Bowl. Tied
with Arizona and USC at the top of
the Pac-10, Oregon holds the
advantage as it has defeated both
of those teams. The last time the
Ducks smelled the roses on New
Year's Day was 1958.
This year, Oregon fields a defen
sive unit that has begun to make a
name for itself in the latter part of
this season. Dubbed "Gang Green"
by the players, the Ducks have qui
etly moved into fourth in overall
defense in the Pac-10, relinquish
ing barely over 300 yards per game.
Oregon gives up only 17.8 points
per game and has held its last two
opponents to 19 combined points.
"Oregon's defense is the best in
the Pac-10 right now," Walsh said.
"No question, that's a formidable
defense. But then again, nobody's
been able to stop us yet this year."

Led by an unorthodox sec
ondary which likes to blitz at
unpredictable times, the Ducks
have perhaps the most unified
defensive front in the conference.
Brooks noted how well safety Chad
Cota (80 tackles) has coordinated
pass coverage and how linebackers
Rich Ruhl (80 tackles) and Jeremy
Asher (75 tackles) are managing
the front seven.
"They really mix it up well,"
Frost said. "They're playing with a
lot of team cohesion, playing as a
unit really well. There are no blown
assignments and everybody's cov
ering each others' backs."
Oregon's defense has also
proven itself against some of the
top individual talent in the confer
ence, which has helped support an
inconsistent offensive attack.
Quarterback Danny O'Neil has
battled injuries and is only averag

ing 135 yards passing per game
this season. Last year, O'Neil
became the first quarterback in
Duck history to pass for over 3,000
yards in a season.
O'Neil's diminished production
has been countered by a sizeable
increase in Oregon's running
game. Averaging 141.3 yards per
game, the ground attack is led by
Dino Philyaw (611 yards) and
Ricky Whittle (502).
While the thought of taking
away a team's Rose Bowl chances
seems secondary to winning the
game for many Stanford players,
Swinton took a more devious
approach to Saturday's game.
"Oregon's a good squad, but to
know I can ruin somebody's
dream, that's just a joy for me,"
Swinton said. "That's like giving
me a piece of pie when I'm starv
ing."

now hands the reins of one of the
most complex offenses in the
country over to the athletic
sophomore from Wood River,
Neb.
However, it is not as if the
Cardinal (3-5-1, 2-4 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) is com
pletely at a loss for Saturday's
game against the Ducks (7-3, 5-
1) at 3:30 p.m. at Stanford Sta
dium. Frost steps in for the
Cardinal to run one of the
nation's top offenses after
guiding Stanford to a remark
able 46-28 win over Washing
ton last weekend. And based on
his performance in the second
half against the Huskies, few
should doubt the sophomore's
ability.
"It was frightening," said
Oregon head coach Rich Brooks.
"I was extremely impressed by
how Stanford dominated a very
talented Washington team."
While the rainy conditions
limited his chances to throw,
Frost's feet made up for the lack
of a typical Stanford aerial
assault as he gained 88 yards on
just 11 carries. The two passes
(out of eight) that he did com
plete both came on important
third down plays.

"I came to Stanford to learn
how to do the precision passing,"
Frost said. "There's nothing
wrong with using the abilities I
have, but hopefully as I get more
experienced, I'll do that less and
less."
And if the Stanford offensive
line and defense play like they
did against the Huskies, much of
the pressure will be taken off
Frost to produce Stenstrom-like
numbers. While the offense has
averaged 463 yards per game
under Stenstrom's guidance, an
emerging running attack behind
freshman Anthony Bookman
has supplemented the Cardinal's
top-rated passing game in the
Pac-10.
"We've been a finesse team
for awhile and I think we will
continue to be a finesse team,"
Frost said. "But you can't win
when you get physically beaten,
and in the second half we physi
cally beat Washington. That
makes my job easy."
Thanks to Bookman and the
play of the offensive line, Stan
ford has averaged 173 yards on
the ground over the past four
games. In those games, the
speedy Bookman has averaged
105 yards a game and has scored
six touchdowns.
Even with the switch at quar
terback, Walsh foresees little
change in the offensive game
plan. Frost has been tabbed as
Stenstrom's successor ever since
he stepped foot on campus and
has been preparing for this day

for two years.
"I think it will look a lot like the
old Stanford offense of the first
nine games," senior offensive tack
le Seth Dittman said, echoing
Walsh's sentiments.
Except for Stenstrom, most of
the injuries plaguing the team have
healed. Junior defensive end Pete
Swanson and sophomore corner
back Eliel Swinton returned to
action last week, and Walsh said
sophomore linebacker Brian Bat
son may see playing time against
Oregon after recovering from a
broken right fibula against Notre
Dame.
Oregon comes to Stanford Sta

dium as the surprise team in a wild
race toward the Rose Bowl. Tied
with Arizona and USC at the top of
the Pac-10, Oregon holds the
advantage as it has defeated both
of those teams. The last time the
Ducks smelled the roses on New
Year's Day was 1958.
This year, Oregon fields a defen
sive unit that has begun to make a
name for itself in the latter part of
this season. Dubbed "Gang Green"
by the players, the Ducks have qui
etly moved into fourth in overall
defense in the Pac-10, relinquish
ing barely over 300 yards per game.
Oregon gives up only 17.8 points
per game and has held its last two
opponents to 19 combined points.
"Oregon's defense is the best in
the Pac-10 right now," Walsh said.
"No question, that's a formidable
defense. But then again, nobody's
been able to stop us yet this year."

Led by an unorthodox sec
ondary which likes to blitz at
unpredictable times, the Ducks
have perhaps the most unified
defensive front in the conference.
Brooks noted how well safety Chad
Cota (80 tackles) has coordinated
pass coverage and how linebackers
Rich Ruhl (80 tackles) and Jeremy
Asher (75 tackles) are managing
the front seven.
"They really mix it up well,"
Frost said. "They're playing with a
lot of team cohesion, playing as a
unit really well. There are no blown
assignments and everybody's cov
ering each others' backs."
Oregon's defense has also
proven itself against some of the
top individual talent in the confer
ence, which has helped support an
inconsistent offensive attack.
Quarterback Danny O'Neil has
battled injuries and is only averag

ing 135 yards passing per game
this season. Last year, O'Neil
became the first quarterback in
Duck history to pass for over 3,000
yards in a season.
O'Neil's diminished production
has been countered by a sizeable
increase in Oregon's running
game. Averaging 141.3 yards per
game, the ground attack is led by
Dino Philyaw (611 yards) and
Ricky Whittle (502).
While the thought of taking
away a team's Rose Bowl chances
seems secondary to winning the
game for many Stanford players,
Swinton took a more devious
approach to Saturday's game.
"Oregon's a good squad, but to
know I can ruin somebody's
dream, that's just a joy for me,"
Swinton said. "That's like giving
me a piece of pie when I'm starv
ing."
