## Frost slated to QB against the Ducks 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Stanford, meet Scott Frost.
Scott Frost, Stanford. Now that
introductions are out of the way,
it's time for football.
Saddled with the loss of
senior Steve Stenstrom to a bro
ken finger, head coach Bill Walsh
now hands the reins of one of the
most complex offenses in the
country over to the athletic
sophomore from Wood River,
Neb.
However, it is not as if the
Cardinal (3-5-1, 2-4 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) is com
pletely at a loss for Saturday's
game against the Ducks (7-3, 5-
1) at 3:30 p.m. at Stanford Sta
dium. Frost steps in for the
Cardinal to run one of the
nation's top offenses after
guiding Stanford to a remark
able 46-28 win over Washing
ton last weekend. And based on
his performance in the second
half against the Huskies, few
should doubt the sophomore's
ability.
"It was frightening," said
Oregon head coach Rich Brooks.
"I was extremely impressed by
how Stanford dominated a very
talented Washington team."
While the rainy conditions
limited his chances to throw,
Frost's feet made up for the lack
of a typical Stanford aerial
assault as he gained 88 yards on
just 11 carries. The two passes
(out of eight) that he did com
plete both came on important
third down plays.

"I came to Stanford to learn
how to do the precision passing,"
Frost said. "There's nothing
wrong with using the abilities I
have, but hopefully as I get more
experienced, I'll do that less and
less."
And if the Stanford offensive
line and defense play like they
did against the Huskies, much of
the pressure will be taken off
Frost to produce Stenstrom-like
numbers. While the offense has
averaged 463 yards per game
under Stenstrom's guidance, an
emerging running attack behind
freshman Anthony Bookman
has supplemented the Cardinal's
top-rated passing game in the
Pac-10.
"We've been a finesse team
for awhile and I think we will
continue to be a finesse team,"
Frost said. "But you can't win
when you get physically beaten,
and in the second half we physi
cally beat Washington. That
makes my job easy."
Thanks to Bookman and the
play of the offensive line, Stan
ford has averaged 173 yards on
the ground over the past four
games. In those games, the
speedy Bookman has averaged
105 yards a game and has scored
six touchdowns.
Even with the switch at quar
terback, Walsh foresees little
change in the offensive game
plan. Frost has been tabbed as
Stenstrom's successor ever since
he stepped foot on campus and
has been preparing for this day
