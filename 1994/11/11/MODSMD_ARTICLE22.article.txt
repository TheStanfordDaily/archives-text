It's do or die time for the Stanford cross country
teams as they travel to the District-8 champi
onships in Tucson, Ariz., this weekend to attempt to
qualify for the national championships.
The Cardinal women, coming off their second
straight Pacific 10 Conference title, will try to main

tain the level they have run at so far this year in
hopes of securing one of the two automatic bids to
the national championships.
According to head coach Vin Lananna, during
the past two weeks the team has gotten ready to
turn its efforts up a notch to make a run at the dis
trict championship, yet the women's team will stick
to the same strategies that have already proven suc
cessful this year.
"Everyone seems to be fired up," he said. "I
think for the women it will be business as usual."
Business as usual for the Cardinal women has
been success all year long. Led by freshmen Kortney
Dunscombe and Sarna Renfro, the women have
won every race but one this year.
The course this weekend is flat with a small
number of moguls, and, according to host Arizona,
it is best described as looking easy but running
hard. The Stanford women should excel in such
conditions as they are a strong team that is disci
plined enough to keep its pack together.
On the other hand, the men's team has been
working hard in the last two weeks to rebound from
its disappointing fifth-place finish at Pac-lOs.
Following the Pac-lOs, Lananna insisted that his
team is as good as it was before the low finish and
that little would need to be fixed in order for the
team to run well in districts.
Two weeks later, Lananna feels they are ready.
"The men look good and ready to go," he said. "I
feel very optimistic about the race this weekend."
The men will have to once again contend with
Pac-10 rival Arizona, led by the highly-touted
brother combo of Bob and Martin Keino.
The Cardinal, though it lost to Arizona two
weeks ago, did defeat the Wildcats a month ago at
the Michigan Invitational. As was the case in all
three races, Lananna feels the key to a victory will
simply be for the men to put themselves in a posi
tion to win near the end of the race.
If the women or men fail to finish first or second,
they will have to rely on the cross country selection
committee to extend to them a wild card berth to
the NCAA Championships on Nov. 21 in Fayet
teville, Ark.
