### Daniel Kao Contributing Writer 
In the ever-expanding war
of college recruiting, the Cardi
nal men's basketball team reg
istered an impressive victory,
signing a recruiting class for
the Fall of 1995 which ranks
amongst the top 15 in the
nation.
Hailing from Southern Cali
fornia, 6-foot, 170-pound
Arthur Lee could very well be
the Cardinal point-guard of the
future. In his junior year at
North Hollywood High School,
Lee averaged 18 points, 4.5
assists and three steals a game.
Another guard signee is 6-
foot-3, 175-pound Kris Weems,
who averaged 18.2 points, 4.2
rebounds, 3.8 assists and 2.6
steals last year. Weems, shoot
ing 49 percent from 3-point
territory as a senior, will pro

vide Stanford with a long dis
tance threat.
Pete Sauer, from Shady
Side Academy (near Pitts
burgh, Pa.), is a fine forward
prospect for the Cardinal. The
6-foot-8, 230-pound Sauer
dominated opponents his
junior year, averaging 26.4
points and 12 rebounds per
game.
Forward Mark Seaton, at 6-
foot-9, 220 pounds, led Servite
High School (Anaheim, Calif.)
in scoring and rebounding,
averaging 12 and eight,
respectively.
Andy McClelland, the Car
dinal's signee at the pivot, led
Corona Del Sol High School
(Tempe, Ariz.) to the 1994 Ari
zona state championship. The
6-foot-10, 235-pound center
averaged 15 points and 12
rebounds while shooting 60
percent from the floor.
