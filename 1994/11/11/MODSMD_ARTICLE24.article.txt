## Reagan and Econ prof. Michael Boskin pick this week's gains and losses 
### 
In a twisted sort of way, you
could call me a competitive firm in
the journalism industry. I supply a
service, and I compete with other
Stanford Daily writers for your
demand of that service.
However, sensing that the
demand for my product is dwin
dling at a rate equal to the decline
of my prognosticating skills, I've
sought and attained the service of
Michael Boskin, a Hoover Institu
tion senior fellow and Tully M.
Friedman, professor of Economics.
Boskin may find it much easier
to predict fluctuations in the inter
est rate and capital investment
than the outcomes of college foot
ball games. But even if you don't
agree with his Laissez-faire theo
ries of government and economics
(shame on you), perhaps you'll be
more inclined to buy into his picks
on the games of the week:
Oregon at Stanford
Three weeks ago I made per
haps my boldest (and most asi
nine) prediction yet — it was going
to be a fowl Rose Bowl for the first
time in over 40 years as the Ducks
would waddle their way to the big
showdown.

Twenty-one days later, that
pick remains the only bright spot
in what has been my dismally dark
ability to foresee the future. The
Ducks hold their future in their
own webbed feet — a win tomor
row against the Cardinal and a vic
tory next week at Oregon State
would fulfill my greatest prophesy.
Professor Boskin, however, sees
marked improvement in Stan
ford's play and predicts the Cardi
nal will "prep for Big Game by
knocking Oregon out of Rose Bowl
contention."
Stenstrom is out for the game
and if the Cardinal needs any
thing now it is the stability and
experience that one of the best
senior quarterbacks in the country
can give. No Stenstrom, no win.
Stenstrom, still no win. The Ducks
are on a roll, and while they've got
the big Bowl in sight they aren't
about to stop and smell the Roses
just yet.
Boskin: Stanford by 6
Reagan: Oregon by 7
