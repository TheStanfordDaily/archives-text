## Reagan and Econ prof. Michael Boskin pick this week's gains and losses 
### 
In a twisted sort of way, you
could call me a competitive firm in
the journalism industry. I supply a
service, and I compete with other
Stanford Daily writers for your
demand of that service.
However, sensing that the
demand for my product is dwin
dling at a rate equal to the decline
of my prognosticating skills, I've
sought and attained the service of
Michael Boskin, a Hoover Institu
tion senior fellow and Tully M.
Friedman, professor of Economics.
Boskin may find it much easier
to predict fluctuations in the inter
est rate and capital investment
than the outcomes of college foot
ball games. But even if you don't
agree with his Laissez-faire theo
ries of government and economics
(shame on you), perhaps you'll be
more inclined to buy into his picks
on the games of the week:
Oregon at Stanford
Three weeks ago I made per
haps my boldest (and most asi
nine) prediction yet — it was going
to be a fowl Rose Bowl for the first
time in over 40 years as the Ducks
would waddle their way to the big
showdown.

Twenty-one days later, that
pick remains the only bright spot
in what has been my dismally dark
ability to foresee the future. The
Ducks hold their future in their
own webbed feet — a win tomor
row against the Cardinal and a vic
tory next week at Oregon State
would fulfill my greatest prophesy.
Professor Boskin, however, sees
marked improvement in Stan
ford's play and predicts the Cardi
nal will "prep for Big Game by
knocking Oregon out of Rose Bowl
contention."
Stenstrom is out for the game
and if the Cardinal needs any
thing now it is the stability and
experience that one of the best
senior quarterbacks in the country
can give. No Stenstrom, no win.
Stenstrom, still no win. The Ducks
are on a roll, and while they've got
the big Bowl in sight they aren't
about to stop and smell the Roses
just yet.

There's no question that the

Michael
Boskin
Pac-10 has been the biggest enig
ma in college football this year.
These two teams are two reasons
why. The Golden Bears can't
decide if they want to be fantastic
(vs. UCLA), pretty good (vs. Ari
zona), or downright horrible (vs.
USC). Washington plays like a
team with no post-season one
weekend (vs. Oregon) and like a
potential national champion the
next (vs. Miami).
Nevertheless, both teams have
fallen into the ranks of the
mediocre. It's the same story

throughout the conference, but
even Boskin believes these two
teams are the most disappointed of
the disappointing. He views Cal as
"no match for [the Huskies], even
in a down year for both teams."
The key in this contest will be
turnovers. Both teams can score
and neither can play defense. The
home field should give the Huskies
the advantage they need to set up
Cal for next weekend's Big Game
defeat.
Boskin: UWbylO
Reagan: UW by 13
Notre Dame at Florida State
What would have been the game
to watch this weekend turns out to
be another snoozer. You might
want to watch the game anyway,

just to get a good look at one of the
two teams that will play for the
national championship come Jan
uary.
Boskin also doubts Notre
Dame's ability to stick with the
Seminoles. "The Irish are not as
strong as Lou Holtz thinks," he
said.
Visions of grandeur for Jan
uary 1 have always been justi
fied in South Bend. However,
the only vision the Irish will get
this year is of televised bowl
games from their couches at
home.
Boskin: FSU by 14
Reagan: FSU by 10
Arizona at USC
This is the toughest game of the

year to pick. Period. Two teams of
almost identical ability face off
with Rose Bowl bids still lingering
for both.
Boskin calls them "two good,
not great" squads. Clearly, the
Wildcats haven't lived up to the
pre-season hype. And the Tro
jans are about as constant as the
average University tuition.
"Desert swarm will shut down
the SC offense," Boskin said. The
potential is there, but the edge of
playing in the Coliseum nudges my
favor to the Trojans.

want to watch the game anyway,

just to get a good look at one of the
two teams that will play for the
national championship come Jan
uary.
Boskin also doubts Notre
Dame's ability to stick with the
Seminoles. "The Irish are not as
strong as Lou Holtz thinks," he
said.
Visions of grandeur for Jan
uary 1 have always been justi
fied in South Bend. However,
the only vision the Irish will get
this year is of televised bowl
games from their couches at
home.

Reagan: FSU by 10
Arizona at USC
This is the toughest game of the

year to pick. Period. Two teams of
almost identical ability face off
with Rose Bowl bids still lingering
for both.
Boskin calls them "two good,
not great" squads. Clearly, the
Wildcats haven't lived up to the
pre-season hype. And the Tro
jans are about as constant as the
average University tuition.
"Desert swarm will shut down
the SC offense," Boskin said. The
potential is there, but the edge of
playing in the Coliseum nudges my
favor to the Trojans.
