# Soccer to begin NCAA play
## 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
Maybe Stanford was fortunate not to garner
home-field advantage after all.
If Wednesday's first round matches of the NCAA
Women's Soccer Tournament set the tone for the
rest of the tourney, Stanford may enjoy playing
elsewhere in its fifth consecutive postseason
appearance. On Wednesday, five of eight road
teams came away with surprising victories. Now
the tournament shifts to the four regions, each with
four teams.
Stanford (16-1-1), the No. 3 team in the nation,
had lobbied to entertain the West Region at Mal
oney Field, but was rebuffed due to the conflict with
tomorrow's Oregon-Stanford football game.
Instead, No. 2 seed University of Portland (14-5),

which already is hosting the Final Four, draws the
home ticket all the way to the national champi
onship should the Pilots advance that far.
However, the Cardinal hopes to ensure a neutral
Final Four. Tomorrow morning at 11 a.m., the
Pacific 10 Conference champions will meet No. 18
Washington (13-6-1), a convincing 3-0 winner at
No. 15 Oregon State (13-5) on Wednesday.
The Huskies faced Stanford a week ago at Mal
oney Field, dropping a 2-0 decision despite out
shooting the Cardinal 19-8. Senior fullback Melinda
Minstrell, playing in her penultimate home game,
scored the game winner. The team captain noted
that while Stanford controlled much of the game,
the Cardinal's play leaves room for improvement in
a rematch.
"At the end of the second half, we lost our con-
centration," said Minstrell, who
made Soccer America's National
Team of the Week for the second
time this season. "There are some
things we need to clean up. I think
we need to be getting more shots on
goal but keep the same percentage."
Head coach lan Sawyers, who
was pleased with Washington's low
percentage scoring opportunities
last Friday, said he will fine tune the
team strategy tomorrow.
"I think we're going to be tactiad
ly different," Sawyers said. "We're
going to make some necessary

adjustments there, but we don't
want to change the result."
A win over Washington would
send Stanford to Sunday's 1 p.m.
regiomil final against Portland or St.
Mary's, who will meet in Saturday'. o
bte game. Up to 5,000 Pilot fans are
expected to crowd Harry A. Merlo
Field to root against the Gaels.
St. Mary's shocked No. 3 seed
Santa Clara (14-5-1) 2-0 on Wednes
day at Buck Henry Stadium to
advance to the regional.
Sawyers said that St. Mary's, who
lost to the Cardinal 2-0 on Oct. 5 and
3-0 to Portland on Oct. 21, is proof
that anything can happen during
tournament time.
"I don't really think they're any
different," Sawyers said. "Playoffs
lire playoffs, and people are going to

rise to the occasion. They have a very
feisty defensive team, and technical
ly Santa Clara was superior. But
they fought and battled and over
came that disadvantage."
Despite shutting out the Broncos,
St. Maiy's has had trouble keeping
opponents from lighting up the
scoreboard. Sophomore Nicole Bar
bacovi finished the regular season
19th of 27 goalkeepers in the West.
Further, Portland has been a
goalie's nightmare. The top scoring
team in the West Region at 3.26 gpg
boasts the nation's most prolific one
two scoring punch. Tiffany Milbrett
is third in the nation with 25 goals,
and Shannon MacMillan is two
notches back with 22.
"They're a very good team, very
well-organized," Sawyers said of the

Pilots. "But they're a little young in
the backfield."
Although according to Sawyers,
"anything can happen in the tourna
ment," Portland and Stanford are
the favorites to meet in the Sunday
final. The Cardinal, 4-3-1 overall in
the tournament, has knocked the
Pilots out each of the last two years.
Still, Sawyers believes his young
players will be able to handle playing
before the largest crowd of their lives.
"I'm excited about that," he said.
"That can only be a positive thing.
You really find out what a good job
or bad job you've done of preparing
your players. If you can't play in that
kind of atmosphere, then I did a bad
job recruiting. And I think I did a
great job of recruiting the kids that I
brought in."
