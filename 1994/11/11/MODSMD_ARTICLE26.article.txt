# Last home stand
## Spikers to end with Arizonas 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
Some countries are trying to
alleviate overpopulation. The sec
ond-ranked Stanford women's vol
leyball team is hoping for it.
The Cardinal plays its final reg
ular-season home matches this
weekend. Stanford (21-1, 13-1 in
the Pacific 10 Conference) takes on
No. 15 Arizona State (14-8, 8-6)
Friday evening at 7 p.m. and bat
tles No. 16 Arizona (12-8,7-7) Sat
urday night at 7:30 p.m.
With these two top-twenty con

tests, the team hopes to pack
Maples Pavilion and break the
weekend attendance record. The
current record of 9,628 people was
set in 1991 while hosting UCLA
and USC.
The Athletic Department has
made a few adjustments to the
normal routine in order to bring in
a big crowd. Saturday's match will
begin one half-hour later than
usual due to the late start of the
Oregon-Stanford football game.
Also, anyone with a ticket stub
from the football game can get into
the volleyball match free of charge.

Students, as always, receive free
admittance regardless.
High attendance provides a
boost to the players.
"It helps regardless of whether
we're home or away," said senior
captain Anne Wicks. "It's a lot of
fun to play in front of an excited
crowd."
"When you're on the road and
there's a bunch of people getting in
your face, it really fires you up to
perform well," she continued.
"And when we're at home, a big
crowd at Maples always provides
us with a lot of support."
Stanford head coach Don Shaw
agrees that a large crowd provides
emotional sustenance for his squad.
"A big crowd, the band playing
— that type of atmosphere can
really charge you up," he said.
Attracting a large number of
people not only helps a team, but
it also makes the event more
enjoyable for the crowd. People
feed off one another. According to
Shaw, providing a good time for
spectators is a large part of any
athletic program.
"That's what athletics is all
about," he said. "It's not just about
the players, it's about the fans."
To combat the anticipated
crowd of Cardinal supporters, Ari
zona State brings talented outside
hitters Christine Garner and
Leanne Schuster to the Farm.
Tiffanie Johnson-Gates, wife of
Oakland Athletics infielder Brent
Gates, is the starting setter. The
Sun Devils are riding a four-match
win streak, but were swept by
Stanford in Tempe while manag
ing only a .079 hitting percentage.
Left-side hitters Barb Bell and
Melissa Ferris have led the Ari
zona offensive attack throughout
the 1994 campaign, while middle
blockers Charita Johnson and

Tamika Dennis have shored up
the blocking. Earlier in the year,
the Wildcats, like the Sun Devils,
fell in three games to the Cardinal.
"Both [ASU and Arizona] are
really good teams that can jump
all over you, if you're not careful,"
Wicks said.
"We're prepared for them and
fired up to come back from some
less-than-satisfactory matches
last weekend," she continued.
Wicks was referring to last
weekend's trip to Los Angeles
where the Cardinal suffered its
first and only setback of the sea
son at UCIA. The loss dropped
Stanford from No.l to N0.2.
"In the long run, it will help
us," Wicks said. "It was a little
wake-up call."
While the team may have pre
ferred to "wake up" in a different
manner, Shaw feels that there is no
harm done. Like Wicks, he believes
that the defeat will help toughen
the squad down the stretch.
"We needed to start picking up
the quality and the pace," he said.
"This is the time of the year when
the season turns into dog days. We
can see the light at the end of the
tunnel, but we still need to get
there. We're looking ahead to the
playoffs, but we need to think
about these matches."
"The trip [to L.A.I was a great
experience," he continued. "We
hadn't played a five-game match
all year. We really needed that
type of pressure. It will definitely
help us."
