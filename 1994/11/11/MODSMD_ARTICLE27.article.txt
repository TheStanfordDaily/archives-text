# Water polo to splash in MPSF Tourney
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
For the Stanford men's water
polo team, the 1994 season has
borne several similarities to last
year's NCAA championship-win
ning season.
Like 1993, the team has been
ranked No. 1 since the year's first
poll. Like last year, Stanford (19-1)
has won both the Southern and
Northern California Tourna
ments. And also identical to a year
ago, the Cardinal has put together
several impressive winning
streaks.
But when coach Dante Detta
manti and his squad travel south
to meet UC-San Diego Friday, and
follow this up at the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Tourna
ment Saturday and Sunday, they
will attempt to avoid a repeat of
last year's performance.
A year ago, the No. 1 Cardinal
entered the MPSF tourney as the
top-seeded team, only to lose to
UC-Irvine and California on the
first day of play. The losses elimi

nated Stanford from the tourna
ment, with a fifth-place finish.
"It was pretty embarrassing
to be No. 1 and lose and be
knocked out of the tournament,"
said senior Wolf Wigo. "This
year, we want to show everyone
that our one loss of the season
[to California] was a fluke, and
that we are above everyone
else."
Before the Cardinal turns its
complete attention to the confer
ence tournament, it must take care
ofUCSD.
Dettamanti called the Tritons,
"a pesky team," which people may
overlook.
"They tend to bother you the
whole game," Dettamanti said.
"They don't roll over; they play
hard the whole time. You don't
ever feel comfortable, but I want to
get everyone in and rest the
starters a little."
The Tritons have played both
No. 4 Pepperdine (13-6) and No. 6
UCLA (13-10) tightly this season.
