# Water polo to splash in MPSF Tourney
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
For the Stanford men's water
polo team, the 1994 season has
borne several similarities to last
year's NCAA championship-win
ning season.
Like 1993, the team has been
ranked No. 1 since the year's first
poll. Like last year, Stanford (19-1)
has won both the Southern and
Northern California Tourna
ments. And also identical to a year
ago, the Cardinal has put together
several impressive winning
streaks.
But when coach Dante Detta
manti and his squad travel south
to meet UC-San Diego Friday, and
follow this up at the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Tourna
ment Saturday and Sunday, they
will attempt to avoid a repeat of
last year's performance.
A year ago, the No. 1 Cardinal
entered the MPSF tourney as the
top-seeded team, only to lose to
UC-Irvine and California on the
first day of play. The losses elimi

nated Stanford from the tourna
ment, with a fifth-place finish.
"It was pretty embarrassing
to be No. 1 and lose and be
knocked out of the tournament,"
said senior Wolf Wigo. "This
year, we want to show everyone
that our one loss of the season
[to California] was a fluke, and
that we are above everyone
else."
Before the Cardinal turns its
complete attention to the confer
ence tournament, it must take care
ofUCSD.
Dettamanti called the Tritons,
"a pesky team," which people may
overlook.
"They tend to bother you the
whole game," Dettamanti said.
"They don't roll over; they play
hard the whole time. You don't
ever feel comfortable, but I want to
get everyone in and rest the
starters a little."
The Tritons have played both
No. 4 Pepperdine (13-6) and No. 6
UCLA (13-10) tightly this season.

MPSF Tournament.
The match-up with UCSD will
r'so be a homecoming for two
of the Cardinal squad,
junior goaltender Jack Bowen and
freshman Layne Beaubien. Both
players attended Coronado High
School in San Diego.
Afler Friday's match, the Cardi
nal Arill travel to Long Beach to
face either Pepperdine or No. 5
University of the Pacific (14-10) in
the first round of the MPSF tour
ney. The Cardinal has defeated
both teams this year.
"This tournament is almost an
exact duplicate of the NCAA tourna
ment," Dettamanti said. "It's in the
same pool [Belmont Plaza Olympic
Pool], the top-five teams will be the
same and the format will be the
same. The only difference will be
who we will play in the first round."

The nine teams in the MPSF
conference have each faced off
against each other once in an offi
cial league match. Stanford placed
first in league play with a record of
7-1. The tournament champion
will receive an automatic hid to the
NCAA tourney Nov. 25-27.
While Dettamanti wants to
avoid another poor tournament
showing, he and his team realize
the most important games will be
played at the NCAAs.
"We didn't play well at the con
ference tournament last year, but it
didn't affect our performance at
the NCAAs," Dettamanti said. "We
would like to win — we haven't
won our league since 1986. But this
is not as important as the NCAAs."
The similarities between this
season and last year have been
plentiful for the defending nation
al champions. On the road to back
to-back NCAA titles, the MPSF
championship would be an added
bonus to Stanford's recent list of
successes.
