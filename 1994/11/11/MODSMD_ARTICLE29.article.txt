# Sailors to face West's best
## 
### Ben Hur 
The time has come for the Stanford sail
ing team to flex its muscle. This weekend,
the Cardinal squad travels to the North-
South Intersectional Regatta in hopes of
securing a high fall ranking and a spot in the
prestigious East Coast regattas later in the
year.
The competition will be held at Lake
Cachuma in Southern California, and will
feature the strongest teams in the West.
Each school will compete in four divisions,
two dinghy divisions and two laser cate
gories. Stanford will send both its varsity
and junior varsity teams to the competition.
Stanford's squad appears solid, and the
Cardinal is favored to capture the title. The
two person dinghys will be led by freshman
Betsy Charmicheal and senior standout
Charles Meade, along with freshman Danny
Zimbaldi and sophomore Ki Mun. The laser
division will spotlight junior Adam Lowry
and freshman John Meade.
This weekend's events are particularly
important because the victorious squad will
have first choice on which Spring Intersec
tionals to attend. Since spaces in these
regattas arc quite limited, a Cardinal win is
crucial. Stanford has its eye on the Thomp
son Trophy and several other spring compe
titions. This Intersectional also determines
the fall rankings for the western schools,
giving Stanford a chance to re-establish its
sailing dominance.
"I think our chances are pretty good,"

said Charles Meade. "We are stronger than
any of the other teams across all four divi
sions."
Coach Steve Bourdow agreed, but also
expressed concern over the competition in
the dinghy division. He acknowledged that
the Cardinal will have to race well in order
to defeat the talented crews of California,
UC-Irvine and Hawaii.
Stanford is not taking anyone lightly,
and the sailors are proving it in practice.
Rigorous training and dedication fit as inte
gral pieces in the Cardinal's formula for suc
cess.
"Strong competition in practice has
helped us prepare. I think we are ready,"
Charles Meade said.
This weekend will also be full of festivi
ties, as past Stanford sailors will return to
compete with the junior varsity in the After
Guard Division. Former Ail-American Scott
Sellers and current Stanford sailing director
Blake Middleton will be among the partici
pants. Both the varsity and junior varsity
will camp out together on the lake.
"We are well prepared, and we have had
a lot of competitions. The junior varsity will
dominate — we have the deepest team out
there," said sophomore Alice Manard.
light wind conditions are expected for
the Invitational, although the recent rains
could create adverse conditions and make
weather an important factor.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal sailors are
confident, and Bourdow has only one place
in mind. "We expect to finish first," he said.
