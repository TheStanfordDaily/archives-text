Several prominent lawyers discussed their experi
ences advocating gay civil rights yesterday at the Law
School, encouraging the audience to explore such
areas as possible career paths.
"Change in the nature of American society" is nec
essary and an "ethical obligation," said Kendall
Thomas of Columbia Law School.
Thomas was joined by John Davidson of the Amer
ican Civil Liberties Union, Tom Stoddard, a past di
rector of Lambda Legal Defense Fund, and Michelle
Benecke, director of Service Members Legal Defense
Network.
The panelists said that although the situation has
improved in the last 10 years,
there is still considerable work to
be done.
Using their backgrounds in law,
they discussed the avenues that
could be taken to continue pursu
ing social change.
One example would be "to go to
court [and] be aware you can use
your case as a vehicle for social
change," Benecke said.
Stoddard had a different point
of view. Conceding that law is a
"conformist profession," he urged
the audience to "break out of it"
and take the risks involved with
actively advocating gay rights.
"We must attack the cultural

foundations that let legislators
make such outrageous claims,"
Thomas agreed, referring to the
debate over service in the military.
Benecke, who served in the mili
tary for six years before she came
out, formed her own organization to
fight for military change when the
national campaign ended last year.
Stoddard cited Benecke as a
classic example of a person who
takes a risk that leads to personal
satisfaction.
Although the speakers recom
mended defending gay rights, they
pointed out that there were very
definite risks involved.
"We live in a world of homopho
bia that is codified in law," said
Thomas.
In a recent survey of both gay
and straight lawyers in IjOS Ange
les, 40 percent stated that they had

observed overt instances of dis
crimination based on sexual orien
tation, Davidson said.
However, he was quick to point
out that there can be great rewards
in promoting gay rights. "It is not a
disability, it's just that you will do
different things," he said.
In response to a question from
an audience member, Benecke said
that the main issue in the future
will no longer be military service,
which she felt was a mistake to
address.
She said it opened up a Pando
ra's box before the infrastructure
to fight it was in place. "The deci
sion got made without us,"
Benecke said.
Future gay civil rights issues,
she said, will be over other mea
sures, namely public school curricu
lums, adoptions and marriages.
