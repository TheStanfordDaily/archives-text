# Montoya announces early decision option
## Change comes in response to low yield rate 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
In an effort to encourage a larger portion
of admitted incoming freshmen to enroll at
Stanford, the Office of Admissions and Fi
nancial Aids will implement an early deci
sion program next year.
Beginning with the freshman class of
1996, high school students who commit to
attending Stanford will now learn whether
they have been admitted as early as mid-De
cember, provided they apply by the early
Nov. 1 deadline.
Students who apply by the traditional
Dec. 15 date can also receive early admis
sion notification in February by committing
to Stanford.
'Stanford's lack of an early admissions
program has put the University at a disad
vantage in attracting and enrolling . . .
highly recruited students," said Dean of Ad
missions and Financial Aid James Montoya.

To support the claim, Montoya cited a
survey of 130 admitted students who had
enrolled in other schools. The survey found
that 34 respondents would have considered

Stanford their first choice
if they had an early deci
sion option.
Montoya announced the
changes at yesterday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting.
He read the explanation
of one student who with
drew his application in
order to enroll early at
Harvard University. "By

the time I received admission from Stan
ford, I had already been sold on Harvard,"
the student wrote.
Montoya also announced that the regu
lar admissions process would be accelerated
"to give students and families additional


Montoya
time" to consider Stanford. Admis
sion notification will now go out no
later than mid-March.
The University's yield rate, or
percentage of admitted students
who enroll, has declined steadily
since 1980, when it was 65 percent.
It currently stands at 54 percent,
while Harvard's remains at 75 per
cent.
Montoya, though, de-emphasized
the yield figures in his report, argu
ing that the admissions field has sim

ply grown more competitive over the
years. All eight Ivy League schools
have early admissions programs, and
"overlap admits" — in which top
schools directly compete over stu
dents — have increased, he said.
As more schools have offered
early admission programs, Stan
ford has lost students to schools
that would not normally be consid
ered rivals, Montoya said.
The new admissions calendar
will allow the University to compete
for those students, without exclud
ing students who do not have
"highly polished" advising in high
school or may not be ready to apply
bv Nov. 1, he added.

Montoya also discussed plans to
increase faculty involvement in the
recruitment process.
Communications Prof. Kristine
Samuelson, who serves on the sen
ate's Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aids,
said such involvement would likely
involve "professors getting on the
phone to call students who they
would like to see come to Stanford."
Montoya, however, emphasized
that yield rate is primarily affected
by outside influences.
"The two factors that impact our
yield rate are U.S. News and World
Report rankings and earthquakes,"
he said.
