## Change comes in response to low yield rate

In an effort to encourage a larger portion
of admitted incoming freshmen to enroll at
Stanford, the Office of Admissions and Fi
nancial Aids will implement an early deci

Beginning with the freshman class of
1996, high school students who commit to
attending Stanford will now learn whether
they have been admitted as early as mid-De
cember, provided they apply by the early
Nov. 1 deadline.
Students who apply by the traditional
Dec. 15 date can also receive early admis
sion notification in February by committing
to Stanford.
'Stanford's lack of an early admissions
program has put the University at a disad
vantage in attracting and enrolling . . .
highly recruited students," said Dean of Ad
missions and Financial Aid James Montoya.

To support the claim, Montoya cited a
survey of 130 admitted students who had
enrolled in other schools. The survey found
that 34 respondents would have considered

Stanford their first choice
if they had an early deci
sion option.
Montoya announced the
changes at yesterday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting.
He read the explanation
of one student who with
drew his application in
order to enroll early at
Harvard University. "By

the time I received admission from Stan
ford, I had already been sold on Harvard,"
the student wrote.
Montoya also announced that the regu
lar admissions process would be accelerated
"to give students and families additional
