# Fac Sen begins to mold proposed science core
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate pondered several
possible formats yesterday for a three-quar
ter science core for non-scientists proposed
by the Commission on Undergraduate Edu
cation last month.
Geological and Environmental Sciences
Prof. Gail Mahood and Mathematics Prof.
Brad Osgood — both members of the senate
and the commission — outlined a possible
model for the science core as envisioned by
the commission.
According to their model, the course
would be divided into individual tracks,
each of which would be taught by teams of

tenured faculty.
Mahood stressed that the core would not
be "department-based," but instead would
draw faculty from a variety of departments.
"The course would be highly interdisci
plinary," she said.
As for the science core's content, Ma
hood said it will include topics such as com
puter literacy, problem solving and labora
tory work. It "will not be a course on the
philosophy or the history of science," she
said.
The labs will be similar to discussion sec
tions and should "be able to be done in the
kitchen," Mahood said.
