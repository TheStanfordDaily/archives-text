# Fac Sen begins to mold proposed science core
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate pondered several
possible formats yesterday for a three-quar
ter science core for non-scientists proposed
by the Commission on Undergraduate Edu
cation last month.
Geological and Environmental Sciences
Prof. Gail Mahood and Mathematics Prof.
Brad Osgood — both members of the senate
and the commission — outlined a possible
model for the science core as envisioned by
the commission.
According to their model, the course
would be divided into individual tracks,
each of which would be taught by teams of

tenured faculty.
Mahood stressed that the core would not
be "department-based," but instead would
draw faculty from a variety of departments.
"The course would be highly interdisci
plinary," she said.
As for the science core's content, Ma
hood said it will include topics such as com
puter literacy, problem solving and labora
tory work. It "will not be a course on the
philosophy or the history of science," she
said.
The labs will be similar to discussion sec
tions and should "be able to be done in the
kitchen," Mahood said.
Explaining the role of mathematics in
the science core, Osgood said the
course will concentrate on "math
ematics in the service of science."
Students will use math, includ
ing statistics and probability, as a
tool to understand "real genuine
problems in science," he said.
They will also work with data
and graphs and get a "working
knowledge of the basic ideas of
calculus," Osgood said. Realizing
that many non-scientists have
"math anxiety," he said faculty
could "trick them into solving dif
ferential equations."
Several faculty members
voiced concerns about this model
of the science core.
Chemistry Prof. Michael Fayer
said the mathematical instruction
in the core "shouldn't just be fold
ed into tricking people into learn
ing" about differential equations.
"I'm worried that students
won't be able to apply the knowl
edge they gain in this manner,"
he said.
Fayer also questioned making
the core interdisciplinary. It
might be easier to sustain the core
over the long run if it is depart
ment-based, he said.
English Prof. John Bender

expressed concern about labs
billed as discussion sections. "I'd
like to see labs that are labs," he
said.
"There are times when I think
you're backing 'Physics for Poets'
even though you say you're not,"
he told Mahood and Osgood.
Psychology Prof. Amos Tver
sky said the commission's goals
were a "bit unrealistic." Many
students who would take the core
are "anxious" about science and
may not have the necessary skills
to succeed in the class, he said.
"We have to be realistic about
what could be accomplished in
this class from the students' point
of view," Tversky said.
Several faculty also raised con
cerns about the resources neces
sary to implement and sustain the
science core.
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Policy
George Dekker said many faculty
members are anxious that
resources will be pulled away
from science majors.
"The University must be will
ing to make a substantial commit
ment to resources if we're going
to go forward with this," Dekker
said.
The biggest problem in terms
of resources will be obtaining
additional faculty to help teach
the course, Mahood said. Only a
few more teaching assistants and

a full-time coordinator w. !d be
needed for the core, she said.
Overall, the cost of the science
core will be comparable to those
for Cultures, Ideas and Values,
said Chemistry Prof. Richard
Zare, a member of the commis
sion's subcommittee on the
breadth requirements.
In its final report, the commis
sion recommended the creation
of a new three-quarter sequence
tentatively titled, "Introduction
to the Natural Sciences, Quanti
tative Analysis, and Technolo
gy-"
Intended for non-scientists,
the course would replace the cur
rent distribution requirements in
Mathematical Sciences, Natural
Sciences, and Technology and
Applied Science (Areas 4, 5 and 6).
It could be offered as early as the
fall of 1996.
Students would be able to take
the course any year, but "hopeful
ly not freshman year," Mahood
said. Faculty estimate that 600 to
700 students would take the sci
ence core each year.
Following the commission's
advice, Provost Condoleezza Rice
will appoint a committee to design
the science core by the end of this
quarter. The committee will be
composed of two students and fac
ulty members who are willing to
teach in the core.
