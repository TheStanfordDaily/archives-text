# 'Hands-on' test formed students

### Marc Lee Staff writer 
The stage is not in a theater, but
rather in a doctor's office.
And the actors here are "patients"
who present Stanford medical stu
dents with a clinical problem to be
examined.
This scene is all part of a new
Medical School program designed to
assess students' clinical compe
tence.

Students in the Standardized Pa
tient Program are evaluated based
on their interaction, in an examina
tion setting, with standardized pa
tients, who are either acting the part
or actually have a medical condition.
The program is currently avail
able to medical students completing
the medicine or family medicine
core clerkships or the Preparation
for Clinical Medicine course, accord
ing to Asst. Dean of Medical Educa
tion Marc Nelson, who directs the

program.
At the ring of a bell, student "doc
tors" read the patient files for two
minutes to obtain information such
as vital signs and a brief explanation
of the problem.
When the bell sounds again, the
students enter the exam rooms and
begin interviewing the patient, tak
ing a history and administer a phys
ical exam where appropriate. They

have 20 minutes to diagnose the
patient.
Medical student Bruce Ellison
said the new program is a welcome
change from written examinations.
"I think it's real-world," he said.
"When you're seeing a patient, the
last thing you're doing is filling out
a multiple-choice exam."
In some cases, standardized
patients describe a family mem
ber's symptoms to the doctor over

the phone to present students with
a different situation.
Nelson said the program also
puts students in sensitive situa
tions they might not be in other
wise, such as interacting with AIDS
and cancer patients, or dealing with
issues regarding sexuality.
"Most of the students are very
good at interpersonal skills. But
there are some students who are
either rude or disrespectful in
some way," said Sam Leßaron, an
associate professor of family
medicine.
The program arose in part from
a need to better define students'

clinical skills, Nelson said.
Leßaron, who is director of the
family medicine clerkship, said the
program also allows faculty to eval
uate their teaching.
Also, the National Board of Med
ical Examiners will soon add a stan
dardized patient portion to the
written exam that physicians must
pass to practice in the United
States, Nelson said.
Only about one-third of medical
schools in the country use stan
dardized patient programs. But
Christine Leßaron, assistant direc
tor of the program, said, "This is
the trend of the future."
