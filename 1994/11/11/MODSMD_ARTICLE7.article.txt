The stage is not in a theater, but
rather in a doctor's office.
And the actors here are "patients"
who present Stanford medical stu
dents with a clinical problem to be
examined.
This scene is all part of a new
Medical School program designed to
assess students' clinical compe
tence.

Students in the Standardized Pa
tient Program are evaluated based
on their interaction, in an examina
tion setting, with standardized pa
tients, who are either acting the part
or actually have a medical condition.
The program is currently avail
able to medical students completing
the medicine or family medicine
core clerkships or the Preparation
for Clinical Medicine course, accord
ing to Asst. Dean of Medical Educa
tion Marc Nelson, who directs the

program.
At the ring of a bell, student "doc
tors" read the patient files for two
minutes to obtain information such
as vital signs and a brief explanation
of the problem.
When the bell sounds again, the
students enter the exam rooms and
begin interviewing the patient, tak
ing a history and administer a phys
ical exam where appropriate. They
