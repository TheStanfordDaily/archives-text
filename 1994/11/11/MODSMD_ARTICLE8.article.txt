# Stenstrom out for season
## Sophomore Scott Frost takes the reigns mid-year 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
For a quarterback who is said to have near
perfect timing with his passes, Steve Stenstrom
sure picked a rotten time to go down with a sea
son-ending injury.
As Stanford prepares for potential Rose Bowl
bound Oregon this Saturday and then Big Game
in two weeks, the leading passer in Pacific 10
Conference history will watch the final two
games of his collegiate career from the sidelines.
Surgery performed Wednesday to repair a bro
ken bone in the joint of his little finger on his
right hand ended his season.
After a school-record 41 straight starts, the
senior signal-caller now faces a premature end to
a record-setting career. Several doctors exam
ined the finger this week, and Stenstrom waited
as long as possible before making the final deci
sion to have surgery.
"I've said all this year that I think Steve Sten
strom has to be considered the All-American
quarterback in college football," head coach Bill
Walsh said. "He has had a great career at Stan
ford and this year was no exception.
"It's a big loss. My guess is that he'd have
been in the top three or four career-wise for
yardage (had he played the final two games]. It's
a loss for Stanford and a loss for college football."
Stenstrom broke his finger late in the second
quarter of the Washington game last Saturday.
On a quarterback option play from the six-yard
line, Stenstrom took the ball and cut inside for a
touchdown. On the tackle, his finger got caught

in an odd position, resulting in the break.
"I just landed on it funny, it was sort of a freak
injury," he said. "I had the ball tucked under
neath my arm and I landed on the ball and some
body landed on me. That's the ironic thing about
it. After all the bullets I've dodged, this would be
the little thing that puts me out of a game, and
the fact that I'd be running an option play is even
more funny."
Before the injury, Stenstrom had completed
13 of 18 passes for 189 yards and two touch
downs on the day. For the year, he was 217-for
-333 for 2,822 yards, with 16 touchdowns and six
interceptions.
The starting job now falls to sophomore Scott
Frost, who has seen very limited action at quar
terback the past two years but started five games
at free safety this season. Frost assumes the po
sition amid similar circumstances as Stenstrom
did four years ago.
Taking over for the injured and ineffective
Jason Palumbis five games into the 1991 season
as a redshirt freshman, Stenstrom led Stanford
to seven straight wins and a berth in the Aloha
Bowl. Since that time, Stenstrom has started
every game for the Cardinal despite taking
countless hits on sacks and scrambles. While he
had been knocked out of several games with mild
concussions, the familiar number 18 always re
turned to the field the next week.
"After all the football he's played," Walsh
lamented. "[The injury] came at the end of play,
I don't think anybody even hit him. He just fell
