# Quack Attack waddles on
## Ducks shock conference, aim for Rose Bowl birth 
### John Lawson Contributing writer 
Sitting in the locker room after
his team's 34-10 demolition of Ari
zona State, University of Oregon
tailback Kevin Parker held a rose
to his nose and spoke the improba
ble truth: "It smells nice, baby!
We're two games away, baby!"
Believe it or not, the Oregon
Ducks, who finished last season
with three consecutive Pacific 10
Conference losses and tied for last
place in the conference, are now in
the driver's seat in this year's race
to the Rose Bowl. If the Ducks (7-
3,5-1 in the Pac-10) win their final
two games, today against the
Stanford Cardinal (3-5-1, 2-4) and
next Saturday against the Oregon
State Beavers (3-6, 1-5), they will
head to Pasadena for the first time
since 1958.
"It would be great to see a team
like Oregon in the Rose Bowl, just as
it would be great to see a team like
Stanford there someone who
doesn't end up there veiy often,"
said Stanford head coach Bill Walsh.
"I wish Stanford could win [today's
game] but Oregon could still go to
the Rose Bowl."
It's been a wild and wonderful
turnaround for the Ducks this year.
It looked like another ho-hum,
mediocre season for the green and
yellow after they lost their second
and third games to Hawaii and
Utah respectively. As Oregon fans
began to doubt their team once
again, head coach Rich Brooks saw
a positive in their latter defeat.
"We outplayed the Utes for 40
minutes," he said. "But in the
final 20, we turned the ball over
and gave away the game. I empha
sized to the team that if we learned
to play for a full 60 minutes, we
would be a team to be reckoned
with."
The Ducks were definitely listen
ing to those words. They came back
the following week and walloped the
lowa Hawkeyes 40-18 and then
manhandled USC in Los Angeles by
a 22-7 margin. After succumbing to
Washington State in Pullman, the
Ducks have played inspired football,
defeating California, Washington,
Arizona, and Arizona State.
"I think we caught our fans by
surprise," Brooks said. "In Sep
tember, they made their deer
hunting plans for November. But
now they have to change them.
They haven't been this excited in a
long time. They really don't know
how to act."
One has to look no further than
Oregon's defense to find the an
swer for the team's sudden rise to
the top of the conference. The
Ducks' secondary, with junior
Alex Molden and senior Herman
O'Berry at the corners and seniors
Chad Cota and Jeff Sherman at
the safeties, may be the best in the
nation. This unit has stolen an as
tounding 16 passes by Pac-10
quarterbacks this year while only
giving up seven touchdowns.
Because Brooks is so confident
in his secondary, he has had the
ability to put seven and sometimes
even eight men on the line of
scrimmage to stop the run.
"Our secondary has provided
the leadership for the whole defen
sive unit," Brooks said. "Although
five of our starters are new on the
front seven this year, they have
played with poise and really ma
tured under the watchful eyes of
guys like Cota and Sherman."

While the defense has proven
spectacular, the offense, although
not the most prolific in the confer
ence, has gotten the job done. Se
nior quarterback Danny O'Neil
has followed up his stellar 1993
campaign (in which he threw for
3,224 yards and 22 touchdowns)
with a decent performance in the
1994 season, throwing for 1,244
yards and 12 touchdowns. Senior
running back Dino Philyaw has
rushed for 611 yards and seven
touchdowns. But the statistics are
not the point when it comes to the
Ducks' offense.
"We might not light up the
scoreboard," Brooks said, "but
we're effective enough to win our
share of football games. Many of
the guys have been playing [for
Oregon] for a few years, and I
think they are all gelling together
now. It's fantastic."
As USC coach John Robinson
told Sports Illustrated, "They're
playing hard, and they've got some
real chemistry going for them."
Robinson's team, which plays Ari
zona this week, is hoping for a
Duck loss coupled with a Trojan

victory that would let USC deter
mine its own fate going into the
last game of its Pac-10 schedule.
Brooks, who has led the Ducks
for 18 years amassing a record of
88-108-4, is a man who Walsh be
lieves has earned his moment in
the spotlight.
"He's finally getting his due,"
Walsh said. "He kept that program
together through some tough
years. He's got my vote for Pac-10
coach of the year for the way he's
turned those guys around."
So, how sweet is it to say "I told
you so" to all the pre-season poll
sters who picked Oregon near or at
the bottom of the Pac-10 picture?
"I'd like for us to complete the
metamorphosis, so to speak, be
fore I'll say anything," Brooks
said. "It would be great, however,
to upset the apple card and end up
in Pasadena."
And, how would you deal with
the No.-2 ranked and undefeated
Penn State Nittany Lions if you
did in fact win the Pac-10 crown?
"That would be a problem,"
Brooks said. "[But] it's a problem
I'd like to have."

Oregon quarterback Danny O'Neil passed for 3,000 yards last year
but led his team to only five wins. This year he has been slowed by Injuries
but has his team on pace to win the Pac-10.
