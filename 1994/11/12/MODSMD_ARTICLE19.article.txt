# Without fear, Swinton vents anger on the field
## The 						loss of his fiancee has changed the sophomore's attitude and perception of both life and death 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
The man is now a weapon, tempered by
the distinct forces of love and death.
The weapon is poised to strike, with little
regard to what it harms, as long as it causes
suffering.
Love and death struggle against each
other, but come together to fuel the inner
furnace of Eliel Swinton's soul.
Seeing his life fall apart on October 20,
the fateful night he learned his fiancee Jes
sica Williams had died in a car accident,
Swinton has dealt with enough pain to last
a lifetime. And now, the sophomore defen
sive back wants to share that feeling with
others.
"I have a lot of pain in me right now,"
Swinton said. The night he found out that
Williams had died, he felt "like all my bones
fell down to my feet and I was just standing
there."
Engineered since birth by his parents to
be a football player, Swinton decided that it
is no longer a game. While he has main
tained his characteristically friendly, open
demeanor off the field, Swinton has poured
his aggression out through football. After
one game back in the lineup, the faucet is
still wide open.
"Whoever is playing against me, I look at
it as if they killed my girlfriend," he said in
describing his game-day mentality. "I can
release all my anger on the field, and do it
legally. I can just go out there and unload on
somebody. Even if I punch somebody, it's
only a 15-yard penalty. It's not like I'm
going to jail."
Swinton is a changed person since the ac
cident. Always a little crazy on the field, he
now plays the game with pure reckless
abandon, getting in the face of any opponent
who dares talk back to him. Against Wash
ington, the 190-pound Swinton nearly went
toe-to-toe with 245-pound Ail-American
tight end Mark Bruener and several of the
Huskies' mammoth offensive linemen.
"I'm a little more psychotic on the field,
because I really want to hurt somebody now
and it's legal," he said. "I know I can do it, if
I put my mind to it. I could really damage
somebody. I'm a bruiser. I'm going to get in
your face, scream in your face, and I'm
going to blow you up."
His shoes bear a stark reminder of his re
cent ordeal. Across each toe, the word "Jes
sica" is written. On the back, "love" and
"death" are on each heel, forcing him to see
both the joy he felt with her and the fact
that she is no longer with him while he is out
on the field.
"That's basically the love I have for her,
but she's dead," Swinton said. "There's a
line between them, but it really doesn't di
vide them. I love her in death, neverthe
less."
Besides the grief and pain he has been
through surrounding the death of Williams,
Swinton has also had to grapple with a dete
riorating family life. While his mother
Paula still remains close to his heart, his fa
ther Oscar has moved out of the picture. Ac
cording to Swinton, his father made some

choices that the family did not approve of
over the past year or so, and Swinton has
chosen not to deal with that at this point in
his life.
Since then Swinton and his older broth
ers have cut off virtually all contact with
their father. Only recently have they begun
to attempt to let their father know how
much he has hurt the family.
Growing up a self-described "thug" in
Los Angeles, Swinton used football to forge
alliances with those who became his team
mates. Fiercely loyal to "his boys" on the
team, Swinton sees the Stanford football
squad as his family.
As freshmen last year, he and running
back Quincy Jacobs were getting teased by
Jason White and other upperclassmen who
asked the two first-year players when they
would get the customary tattoo many of the
Cardinal players wore.
After the season had ended, Swinton
called up Jacobs one night and the two jour
neyed to undertake the ritual. The simple
"No Fear" emblazoned on the ankle of
White and others was not enough; Swinton
and Jacobs decided on something more
specifically relevant to their time as mem
bers of the Stanford football team. The re
sult a powerful "C-House" (Cardinal
House) etched on their arms stands as a tes
tament to their devotion to the Cardinal
program.
Since then, Swinton has seen his family
life begin to crumble and his anchor at
school disappear. Describing his relation
ship with Williams as "a fairy tale," Swin
ton is quick to remember all the positive
moments he had with her. Out of every
thing she did and meant to him, Swinton
believes her insistence to never give up has
helped him greatly through the past three
weeks.
Before her tragic death, a hip flexor and
quadricep injury had sidelined Swinton for
three weeks. Football and Williams had al
ways been there for Swinton at different
times during his entire life, and for two
weeks, he had neither. For someone who
had been so heavily involved in football
since the age of three, the sport became a
given.
"It's like my girlfriend you never know
how much you love her until it's gone," he
said. "You know you love the sport, I know I
love her, but you learn how much you love
her when they're gone, but by that time it's
too late. I'm back playing again, but with
her, she's gone. I almost look at it as if I have
another chance with football, but not with
her. So you better make sure you do all you
can while you can."
His experiences over the past three
weeks have taught Swinton much about life
and his own inevitable death. "Life and
death, not a big deal to me anymore. I'm
prepared to go tomorrow. If somebody came
right here right now, and said one of us is
going to die, me or you, I'd probably stand
up and say take me. I'm more prepared," he
said.
But by taking strength from his memo
ries of Williams and her indomitable work
ethic, he has fought his way back onto the

field and on his first play of the Washington
game, he saw a Napoleon Kaufman fumble
roll wildly into his path.
"I got cut, or slipped or something and as
I was falling I saw the ball fly out, maybe
five yards away," he said. "I thought, 'the
ball.' So I scooped it up and started running,
but I couldn't get out of third. My gears
were grinding, and by then [Washington
quarterback Damon] Huard had the angle
and forced me out of bounds. It was kind of
embarrassing. That's all Mike [Mitchell]
talks about."
These days, Swinton still uses the self
hypnosis technique a high-school coach

taught him to prepare for each game. Slow
ly letting all the energy leave his body in
deep breaths, Swinton then envisions every
play he missed in previous games.
But then the "human highlight tape"
kicks in, and he sees himself making every
one of those plays in ferocious fashion.
Swinton has added memories from his time
with Williams, and all these mental images
slowly build up in his mind. With every
breath, the energy grows within his muscu
lar body as he once again becomes a weapon
bent on delivering just a piece of the suffer
ing he has endured and continues to strug
gle through.
