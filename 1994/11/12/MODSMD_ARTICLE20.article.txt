# Cline does it all for Stanford
## 
### Tom Baranowski Staff writer 
Tony Cline stretches his legs
out, then glances toward the sky as
if he were looking for some mes
sage in the clouds. The senior is
taking a short break from class
work, and at six-feet five-inches
tall and 250 pounds, he casts a long
shadow over the ground similar to
the one he casts as Stanford's
starting tight end. After a momen
tary pause he begins to speak.
"Obviously it's been a really
tough year" said the goat-teed se
nior. "The Washington win gives
us a bit of pride though. Beating a
team like Washington helps to mo
tivate us to do well against Oregon
and Cal."
Cline shifts in his seat a bit,
then continues. "Oregon's a
bunch of over-achievers. They all
really hustle to the ball. They're
not the most talented team that
we've seen this year, but they play
really hard."
Cline laughs a bit to himself
and grins. "I don't want to give
away our game plan, because
we're planning on doing some cool
new stuff, so let me just say that
we're going to have to execute. We
can't be the ones to turn the ball
over like Washington did last
weekend. We have to hold on to
the ball and execute our offense."
In the last two seasons Cline
has been a critical part of the Car
dinal offense's execution and
game plan. In 1993, he set a Stan

ford record for single season recep
tions by a tight end, catching 42
balls for 465 yards. Now, with the
end of the 1994 campaign right
around the corner, Cline has
tacked on 34 more receptions to
his career totals, and has proven
his importance in the Cardinal
passing game. However, even
more important for Stanford has
been his blocking a skill for
which head coach Bill Walsh has
continuously heaped praise upon
the senior.
"I take a lot of pride in my
blocking," Cline said. "I put more
importance on blocking than re
ceiving because that is what the
coaches emphasize with me. When
they draw a running play up and
I'm the primary blocker on the
play it gets me excited. I take a lot
of pride in beating my man it's
more of a one-on-one competition.
I like competing with another per
son and beating up on a guy."
Cline hasen't always had this
opportunity, however. After a
high school career at Davis High in
California that included All-
League and national honors as a
tight end, and after starting on his
high school basketball team, aver
aging 20 points a game, Tony came
to Stanford with high hopes. He
spent his first year behind current
Chicago Bear tight end Ryan Wet
night and in 1991 he suffered a ca
reer-threatening back injury that
kept him off of the football field for
most of the year.
"When I was injured I was just

trying to get back. A couple of doc
tors told me that I wouldn't play
again," Cline recalled. "That moti
vated me to work hard to recover,
but at the very least I wanted to
get back to a situation where I
could function normally play
pick-up basketball and stuff like
that. I wanted to get my back bet
ter so I could be comfortable in
everyday life. I didn't want to feel
70 years old when I was only 19."
That motivation for recovery
drove Cline to where he stands
today as a pro prospect at tight
end on Stanford's football team.
And now, looking back on his ca
reer, Cline remembers a couple of
outstanding experiences.
"I think my fondest memory of
my football career is probably Big
Game my freshman year in 1990
[the year Stanford came back to
beat Cal 27-25 in the final 15 sec
onds of play]. I got to play a little
bit in that game which, as a fresh
man, was really exciting. That
game and the Colorado game last
year [in which Cline caught 11
passes for 120 yards and the game
winning touchdown] are my fond
est memories."
A small smile crosses Cline's
face at the thought of these games,
and for a moment the senior seems
content with his surroundings. He
glances back up toward the sky,
then turns again towards his
books, ready to take the steps that
will lead him to graduation, and on
to what is sure to be a successful
life.

Senior Tony Cline does It all as the Cardinal's tight end; not only has
he held up opposing cornerbacks to give Stenstrom time to throw but
he has also caught for 260 yards.

trying to get back. A couple of doc
tors told me that I wouldn't play
again," Cline recalled. "That moti
vated me to work hard to recover,
but at the very least I wanted to
get back to a situation where I
could function normally play
pick-up basketball and stuff like
that. I wanted to get my back bet
ter so I could be comfortable in
everyday life. I didn't want to feel
70 years old when I was only 19."
That motivation for recovery
drove Cline to where he stands
today as a pro prospect at tight
end on Stanford's football team.
And now, looking back on his ca
reer, Cline remembers a couple of
outstanding experiences.
"I think my fondest memory of
my football career is probably Big
Game my freshman year in 1990
[the year Stanford came back to
beat Cal 27-25 in the final 15 sec
onds of play]. I got to play a little
bit in that game which, as a fresh
man, was really exciting. That
game and the Colorado game last
year [in which Cline caught 11
passes for 120 yards and the game
winning touchdown] are my fond
est memories."
A small smile crosses Cline's
face at the thought of these games,
and for a moment the senior seems
content with his surroundings. He
glances back up toward the sky,
then turns again towards his
books, ready to take the steps that
will lead him to graduation, and on
to what is sure to be a successful
life.

Senior Tony Cline does It all as the Cardinal's tight end; not only has
he held up opposing cornerbacks to give Stenstrom time to throw but
he has also caught for 260 yards.
