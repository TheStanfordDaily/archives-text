# Defense matures in victory over Washington
## Stanford slows Napoleon Kaufman and Huskies in second half to secure upset 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The monkey is finally off of their backs.
Last Saturday the Stanford defense vin
dicated itself, at last living up to the high ex
pectations of a Bill Walsh-coached team. De
spite a difficult first half, the Cardinal came
together in the rain and wind at Stanford
Stadium, shutting down the powerful
Husky offense en route to a 46-28 win.
After last year's fiasco, the Cardinal de
fense could only get better. Finishing dead
last in the Pacific 10 Conference in every de
fensive category, there were, as John Mad
den might say, holes big enough for a Mack
truck to drive through.
However, during the eight games this
season prior to the win against the Huskies,
the gaps shrunk to a size that was just big
enough for an opposing player to run
through. The Stanford defense improved
enough to at least keep the team in most of
the games. Unfortunately, remaining close
this year has ultimately meant a Cardinal
(3-5-1,2-4 Pac-10) loss. Duringthe first half
of the Washington game it looked like more
of the same.
Despite Washington's initial possession of
the game, which was stopped when senior
nose tackle Jason Fisk stuffed Husky running
back Napoleon Kaufman and sophomore Eliel
Swinton returned the resulting fumble for 33
yards, the situation looked grim. The Huskies
traversed 74 yards in only five plays for a
touchdown on their second possession. From
then on, Washington continued to roll and fin
ished the half with 25 points.
Nothing appeared to have changed. In 30
minutes of play, Washington rushed for 193
yards and went through the air for 111
more. The Huskies were on pace to gain 588
yards in the game and Kaufman was up to
his same old tricks against the Cardinal.
The previous season "Little Nip" had run
rampant around and through the Cardinal
secondary for a total of 195 yards rushing.
During the first half of this year's game, Kauf
man racked up 99 yards on just 13 carries and
returned two kickoffs for 71 more yards.
Adding to the pressure on the Stanford
defense was the loss of senior quarterback
Steve Stenstrom. Stenstrom broke a finger
late in the first half on a touchdown run and
sat out the rest of the game.
"We [the defense] knew the points might
not be coming on the board like they used
to," said redshirt junior linebacker Mike
Hall. "The defense really dedicated them
selves at halftime."
"We had to play hard and rise up to the
challenge," added Fisk. "We couldn't count

on the offense scoring like they used to."
By all accounts, the defense certainly
rose to the occasion. Washington was held
to only three points and even more telling
only 114 yards of total offense after the
break. Kaufman could only muster 40 more
yards on the ground and was held in check
as a receiver.
"Defensively, we certainly played better
and better as the game wore on," said head
coach Bill Walsh.
The victory was a welcome respite from
the depression previous losses had created
amongst the defensive players.
"It's been frustrating," said senior line
backer Coy Gibbs.
"The win was really nice," Fisk said.
"We've been so close. It's great to finally
win. We needed the victory to prove to our
selves that we can do it."
Contrary to other teams' attempts to
stop Kaufman, the Cardinal did not stack
the line and challenge the Huskies to pass.

"We didn't make any changes for this
game," Gibbs said. "Our problem in the past
was that we weren't playing what was
called. It's a matter of us executing."
The challenge of performing was made
more acute by the situation the team found it
self in, with a number of freshman and sopho
mores starting in crucial positions. The four
freshmen strong safety Kadar Hamilton,
linebackers Chris Draft and Jon Haskins and
lineman Kailee Wong have made key con
tributions, yet are still inconsistent. ..
"We're playing so many freshmen in key
roles," Walsh said. "They're fooled and baf
fled at times. On some plays Chris Draft
would stop [in the middle of plays] and on
others he would go the wrong way. He's just
learning.
"Sometimes they're getting experience
at the expense of wins," he added.
The seniors, however, have been trying
their best to help the freshmen make the
transition from high school to big time col

lege football.
"They [the freshmen] are an extremely
talented bunch of players," Fisk said. "You
got to have the attitude. It's hard playing
football but they've gotten better."
With no chance of playing in a bowl, Stan
ford's two remaining games become that
much bigger. And with a chance for Oregon
to make it to the Rose Bowl for the first time
since 1958 and hopes rising that the Axe will
be brought back to the Farm in 1994, the
games take on an almost monumental mag
nitude. The defense vows it will be ready.
"It's all we got left," Gibbs said. "I'm
going to let it all on the line."
"Oregon is a very talented team," Fisk
said. "A win would be really nice. I really
don't want Oregon to represent us in the
Rose Bowl."
"I really wish we could have put it to
gether sooner." added Gibbs. "We've given
up a lot of points this year but I think that
we've shown people that we can win."

stop Kaufman, the Cardinal did not stack
the line and challenge the Huskies to pass.

"We didn't make any changes for this
game," Gibbs said. "Our problem in the past
was that we weren't playing what was
called. It's a matter of us executing."
The challenge of performing was made
more acute by the situation the team found it
self in, with a number of freshman and sopho
mores starting in crucial positions. The four
freshmen strong safety Kadar Hamilton,
linebackers Chris Draft and Jon Haskins and
lineman Kailee Wong have made key con
tributions, yet are still inconsistent. ..
"We're playing so many freshmen in key
roles," Walsh said. "They're fooled and baf
fled at times. On some plays Chris Draft
would stop [in the middle of plays] and on
others he would go the wrong way. He's just
learning.
"Sometimes they're getting experience
at the expense of wins," he added.
The seniors, however, have been trying
their best to help the freshmen make the
transition from high school to big time col

lege football.
"They [the freshmen] are an extremely
talented bunch of players," Fisk said. "You
got to have the attitude. It's hard playing
football but they've gotten better."
With no chance of playing in a bowl, Stan
ford's two remaining games become that
much bigger. And with a chance for Oregon
to make it to the Rose Bowl for the first time
since 1958 and hopes rising that the Axe will
be brought back to the Farm in 1994, the
games take on an almost monumental mag
nitude. The defense vows it will be ready.
"It's all we got left," Gibbs said. "I'm
going to let it all on the line."
"Oregon is a very talented team," Fisk
said. "A win would be really nice. I really
don't want Oregon to represent us in the
Rose Bowl."
"I really wish we could have put it to
gether sooner." added Gibbs. "We've given
up a lot of points this year but I think that
we've shown people that we can win."

Stanford's defense has had its fair share of troubles this year, but last week came through and slowed the Huskies to preserve the
46-28 victory.
The monkey is finally off of their backs.
Last Saturday the Stanford defense vin
dicated itself, at last living up to the high ex
pectations of a Bill Walsh-coached team. De
spite a difficult first half, the Cardinal came
together in the rain and wind at Stanford
Stadium, shutting down the powerful
Husky offense en route to a 46-28 win.
After last year's fiasco, the Cardinal de
fense could only get better. Finishing dead
last in the Pacific 10 Conference in every de
fensive category, there were, as John Mad
den might say, holes big enough for a Mack
truck to drive through.
However, during the eight games this
season prior to the win against the Huskies,
the gaps shrunk to a size that was just big
enough for an opposing player to run
through. The Stanford defense improved
enough to at least keep the team in most of
the games. Unfortunately, remaining close
this year has ultimately meant a Cardinal
(3-5-1,2-4 Pac-10) loss. Duringthe first half
of the Washington game it looked like more
of the same.
Despite Washington's initial possession of
the game, which was stopped when senior
nose tackle Jason Fisk stuffed Husky running
back Napoleon Kaufman and sophomore Eliel
Swinton returned the resulting fumble for 33
yards, the situation looked grim. The Huskies
traversed 74 yards in only five plays for a
touchdown on their second possession. From
then on, Washington continued to roll and fin
ished the half with 25 points.
Nothing appeared to have changed. In 30
minutes of play, Washington rushed for 193
yards and went through the air for 111
more. The Huskies were on pace to gain 588
yards in the game and Kaufman was up to
his same old tricks against the Cardinal.
The previous season "Little Nip" had run
rampant around and through the Cardinal
secondary for a total of 195 yards rushing.
During the first half of this year's game, Kauf
man racked up 99 yards on just 13 carries and
returned two kickoffs for 71 more yards.
Adding to the pressure on the Stanford
defense was the loss of senior quarterback
Steve Stenstrom. Stenstrom broke a finger
late in the first half on a touchdown run and
sat out the rest of the game.
"We [the defense] knew the points might
not be coming on the board like they used
to," said redshirt junior linebacker Mike
Hall. "The defense really dedicated them
selves at halftime."
"We had to play hard and rise up to the
challenge," added Fisk. "We couldn't count

on the offense scoring like they used to."
By all accounts, the defense certainly
rose to the occasion. Washington was held
to only three points and even more telling
only 114 yards of total offense after the
break. Kaufman could only muster 40 more
yards on the ground and was held in check
as a receiver.
"Defensively, we certainly played better
and better as the game wore on," said head
coach Bill Walsh.
The victory was a welcome respite from
the depression previous losses had created
amongst the defensive players.
"It's been frustrating," said senior line
backer Coy Gibbs.
"The win was really nice," Fisk said.
"We've been so close. It's great to finally
win. We needed the victory to prove to our
selves that we can do it."
Contrary to other teams' attempts to
stop Kaufman, the Cardinal did not stack
the line and challenge the Huskies to pass.

"We didn't make any changes for this
game," Gibbs said. "Our problem in the past
was that we weren't playing what was
