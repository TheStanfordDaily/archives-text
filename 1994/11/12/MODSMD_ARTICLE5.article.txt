# CARDINAL NOTES
## Stenstrom's season ends early, Frost steps in to lead Cardinal against Ducks 
### Christian Leone Andrew Blachman Editorial staff 
Before the season, anyone bold enough to predict
that Oregon would go to the Rose Bowl would proba
bly have been shot, or at least lost their job. The
Ducks dropped four of their last five games last year
and began this season losing two of their first three
hardly thrusting themselves into the center of the
Pacific 10 Conference race.
But quietly the Ducks have proved effective
enough to win their last four games in a row in
cluding stunning upsets of Washington and Arizona
and have positioned themselves as the team to beat
in the Pac-10. With just two games left to play, Ore
gon is the master of its own destiny.
With a win over Stanford today and a victory at
Oregon State the conference's worst team next
week, the Ducks will earn their first trip to the Rose
Bowl since 1958.
There they would likely meet probable Big Ten
champion Penn State and, again, few would dare to
forecast an Oregon victory.
But, as the Ducks have proven in 1994, conven
tional wisdom doesn't always hold true in college
football....
In sophomore Eliel Swinton's first play since re
turning to the Cardinal team, the cornerback scooped
up a Napoleon Kaufman fumble and returned the
ball for 34 yards.
Swinton had missed Stanford's previous five
games due to injury and the death of his fiancee Jes
sica Williams in a tragic car accident.. . .
The Oregon Ducks are ranked 11th in the
CNN/USA Today College Coaches' Poll but only 15th
in the Associated Press Top 25.. . .
While senior quarterback Steve Stenstrom has be
wildered most of the defenses in the Pac-10, he has
been unlucky against the Washington Huskies.
His 189 yards passing last week was his lowest
output since he threw for just 93 yards against Wash

ington in 1992. Both times, Stenstrom was knocked
out of the game before halftime.
It seems that the Huskies have been the only team
that has been able to solve Stenstrom by finding a
way to put him on the bench. . . .
After starting a record 41 games for the Cardinal,
Stenstrom will not play today or in next week's Big
Game. He underwent surgery on his fractured right
little finger on Wednesday. Stenstrom will finish his
career with 11 Stanford records including career wins
and career yards passing and seven Pac-10 records. .. .
Two weeks ago freshman Anthony Bookman ran
for a career best 138 yards on 21 carries. He current
ly leads the team with 481 yards to average a cool 5.5
yards every time he gets ball. Anthony Bookman
should be the first true freshman since Darrin Nel
son in 1977 to lead the team in rushing. . . .
When Stenstrom left the field in the second quar
ter of last week's contest, the Cardinal was clinging to
a 28-25 lead. Many thought that without the Ail-
American candidate at the helm, Stanford would be
unable to match Kaufman and the Huskie offense.
But Scott Frost, who spent five games in a row start
ing at free safety, got the call and stepped up.
Handing off to Bookman for over 100 yards and
scrambling for 90 yards himself. Frost, with the help
of a defense that finally came through in the clutch,
led the Cardinal to victory while only completing 2 of
8 passes for 31 yards. . . .
After last week's upset of Washington, many Car
dinal fans are asking whether next year's offense will
abandon the pass and shift to a wishbone formation.
With a healthy Mike Mitchell and Anthony Bookman
and an athletic Scott Frost quarterbacking the of
fense, many are asking, "why not?"
But those who are used to great Stanford quarter
backs and Walsh's passing offense find it hard to be
lieve that such a transition is on its way. It will be
tough for a man like Walsh to abandon his pro-style
offense for the grind-it-out-on-the-ground style of
football played on college fields all over the coun
try

With Stentsrom out for the remainder of the season, the Cardinal's offense
will now revolve around Scott Frost's ability to run the ball.
