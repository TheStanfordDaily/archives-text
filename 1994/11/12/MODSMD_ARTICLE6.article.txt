# Around the Pac-10

#l3 Arizona (7-2) at #l7 USC (6-2)
Last year the 13th-ranked Wildcats rolled over the Trojans to
open the season with a 5-0 record. Arizona's double eagle ilex de
fense held USC's high powered offense to only 47 rushing yards
while sacking Rob Johnson six times and recovering three Trojan
fumbles in the 38-7 win. Right now both teams are tied for the con
ference lead with 15th-ranked Oregon, making today's meeting in
Los Angeles crucial in the Rose Bowl race.
#24 Washington State (6-3) at Oregon State (3-6)
The Cougars dominated last year's conference opener against
the Beavers. Oregon State was held to four first downs in their 51-
6 defeat. This year the Beavers, who run a wishbone offense, again
find themselves in the basement of the Pac-10 with just one con
ference win against UCLA.
California (3-6) at #22 Washington (6-3)
The Huskies have won the last thirteen meetings against the
Golden Bears of California. Last year in one of the better games the
Pac-10 had to offer, Washington overcame a thirteen point deficit
in the fourth quarter to beat the 16th ranked Bears. Damon Huard
began the game with four interceptions and a fumble but when
crunch time rolled around the Washington quarterback completed
12 of 14 passes for two touchdowns and the 24-23 win.
UCLA (3-6) at Arizona State (3-6)
UCLA and Arizona State have two things in common: They are
both having abysmal seasons and they have both beaten the Car
dinal. The Sun Devils and Bruins rank 10th and 9th respectively in
the Pac-10 in total defense. The Bruins are coming off a Rose Bowl
season while the Sun Devils have taken the step down from medi
ocrity to simply being a bad team.
