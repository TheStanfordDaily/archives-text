HOW DO YOU PLACE CALLS WHEN
YOU'RE AWAY FROM CAMPUS?
A. I look for coins in pay phones until I find enough for the call.
B. I call collect and hope the person likes me as much as I thought.
C. I use my Stanford-provided Sprint calling card and get:
LOW RATES,
(lower than those available to individual Sprint calling card customers)
CONVENIENT DIALING PROCEDURES,
(with easy toll-free access to the Sprint network)
and SIMPLIFIED BILLING!
(where charges appear on the same statement as my Stanford phone charges)

If you selected either A or B, you may need some extra tutoring.
Stop by Communication Services, Forsythe Hall, room 195,
or call 7-HELP to talk about the advantages
of the Stanford-provided Sprint Calling card.
Don't leave campus without it!
