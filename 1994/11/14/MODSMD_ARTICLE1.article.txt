# Another lodger?
## Non-student gets the boot 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
Imagine dating Olympic swimmer bummer
Sanders, rooming with former Stanford football star
Glyn Milburn and having a perfect 4.0 at Stanford.
Sound too good to be true? It may be.
A boarder in the Delta Kappa Epsilon house who
claimed all of these experiences was asked to vacate
the premises last Friday after University officials —
and the house — discovered that he was not a regis
tered student.
Larry Dunn Jr., who apparently was a summer vis
itor in 1991, left the Deke house last week, claiming
the unverified registration was a mix-up and that he
would be back once things were resolved, said sopho
more Alejandro Menchaca, Dunn's former room
mate.
Senior Adam Averbach, the Deke president, said
the fraternity did not know Dunn was not a student
until the University notified them that his registra
tion could not be verified by the housing office.
Even after Averbach and Deke resident assistant
Brian Steele confronted Dunn with the University's
findings and told him he must move out, Dunn con-
tinued to claim that the incident
was "just confusion," he said.
According to Averbach, the
fraternity inquires about student
status when admitting boarders
and then provides the housing
office with a list of the new board
ers in order to verify student reg
istration. Since Dunn gave the
Dekes a valid University I.D.
number, discovering his non-stu
dent status was that much more
difficult.
"I got a notice that he was on
an unregistered list and given a
three-day notice to move," said
Patricia Polhemus, resident dean
for Row Housing and Florence
Moore Hall.
"I called to see if there were
any problems we could help him
with . . . land] to see if he could
get registered," she said.
But Polhemus said a meeting
with Dunn yielded no solutions.
"I want students to know that if
they have a problem we work it
out and that's our main goal, but
that was impossible in this situa
tion," said Polhemus.
Although Dunn has only been
a Deke house boarder since the
beginning of this quarter, Men
chaca said Dunn claimed to have
lived in Kimball, Mirrielees, and
Robinson over the past three
years.
Menchaca said that a few
days before Polhemus alerted
the fraternity, he began to real
ize that the things his roommate
had been telling him were not
true.

"We started catching him on
all these little lies," he said.
According to Menchaca,
Dunn told him and others that
he had a 4.0 CPA, had dated
Olympic swimmer Summer
Sanders, had once roomed with
former Stanford football star
Glyn Milburn, and that he had a
photographic memory that
enabled him to "write papers in
his head."
Menchaca said Dunn also told
him that he had attended
Brigham Young University for a
year before embarking upon his
two-year Mormon mission and
ultimately deciding to transfer to
Stanford.
Dunn also told Menchaca and
others that he was suffering from
cancer.
Menchaca suggested that
Dunn may have been telling the
truth in this case. "He looked
sick all the time" and slept quite
often, he said. Menchaca also said
that Dunn told him that he took
morphine.
"He is by far the nicest guy I
ever met, I but I I don't know if it's
genuine or a con," said Menchaca.
Polhemus added that Dunn
owed money to the University but
declined to comment further.
After Polhemus spoke with
Dunn, she said she let the Dekes
know that he had to move out of
the house by Friday. In compli
ance with University demands,
Dunn returned his keys to the
Deke house Thursday night and
left early Friday morning.
"I go to Stanford and get a con
artist as a roommate. Maybe they
should have admitted him in the
first place," Menchaca said. "He's
a pretty smart guy."
