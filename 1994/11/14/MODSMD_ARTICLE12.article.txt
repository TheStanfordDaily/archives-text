# Congresswoman speaks on public interest law

Calling on young law students to contribute
to society, Eleanor Holmes Norton — the liep
resentative to Congress from the District of
Columbia — delivered a keynote address last
Friday, capping off the Law School's Public
Interest Law Week.
In her speech, Holmes focused on the roots
of public interest law, as well as its place in the
modern American judicial system.
"Public interest law owes everything to the
American civil rights movement," she said,
adding that the NAACP's legal defense fund
"pioneered" the idea of law in the public inter
est.
Despite those rather limited beginnings,
Holmes explained, public interest law — which
encompasses civil and human rights as well as
public defenders' offices — has grown.
"Public interest law began on the left — it
has now found its way to the right," she said.
"In public interest law, we have a hold of some
thing permanent."
Holmes went on to say that, while law in the
public interest represents the best parts of the
American legal system, it is not always the
most visible or accessible.
"Law in the public interest has chiefly been

the province of the private bar," she said,
adding that a significant portion of legal rep
resentation for public interest has been pro
vided by private lawyers who volunteer their
time.
Claiming that legal services are "often as
vital as medical services," Holmes allied upon
today's law students to serve the public inter
est.
"A lawyer is obligated to find a way to con
tribute to the public interest," she said. "Each
of us must find her own path to fulfill (that]
obligation."
According to Holmes, one of the ways for
students and lawyers to fulfill that duty is
through pro bono, or donated, services.
"Pro bono service am do much to remind
the bar that law is one of the great professions,
and not just another business," she explained.
The challenge, Holmes went on to say, is to
find a way to make public practice "take root"
in private firms.
Without that necessary connection to pri
vate practice, she said, "pro bono law could
become a pet of the profession," creating a sit
uation that could increase already high levels of
distrust in the legal profession.
"Law is neither noble nor base. It can be
either, it can surely be both," Holmes summed
ud. "It is not a value svstem. it is a svstem

always in search of values.
After finishing her speech, Holmes spoke
about the recent round of elections, and the
resulting changes in Congress that may be on
the horizon.
"It's hard to overestimate what happened
on Tuesday. I think this is a true revolution,"
she said, claiming that much of the tumult in
Congress is due to the fact that "society is jus
tifiably fed up with the decline in 'ordinary
morals.' "
With this social backlash, and with a new,
Republican-controlled Congress, Holmes pre
dicts that "there will be some anti-civil rights
laws introduced."
"Many of the ideas that were considered
kooky will pass and not be vetoed," she added,
including a possible amendment re-instituting
prayer in the public schools.
When asked if a Republican-controlled
Congress means that prospects for statehood
for the District of Columbia are dead, Holmes
responded curtly, "Yes, pretty much."
According to her, the District will have
enough trouble simply getting enough money
from Congress to fund its budget."The notion
of asking a Republican Congress for more
money is laughable," she said. "Washington
D.C. can't get money unless they take initiat
ing steps on their own."
