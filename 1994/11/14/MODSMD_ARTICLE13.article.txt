## Clinton to meet with Asian leaders 
### 
JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) â€”
On his first overseas trip since
the elections, President Clinton
assured anxious Asian leaders
yesterday that America's foreign
policy will not be shaken by the
Republican landslide in
Congress.
"The position of the United
States is certainly just as strong
as it ever has been," Clinton
said, setting the stage for a sum
mit on expanding trade with
Asia's booming economies.
Organizers hope leaders of 18
Pacific and Asian nations
attending the Asia-Pacific Eco
nomic Cooperation forum will
agree to free trade in the region
by 2020, though China and
Malaysia are resisting.
In advance of the summit,
Clinton was holding one-on-one
talks Monday with the leaders of
China, Japan, South Korea and
Australia.
Disputes over human rights
and trade barriers were expected
to be high on the agenda for

Clinton's second meeting with
Chinese President Jiang Zemin
in a year.
Frictions eased somewhat
after Clinton granted most
favored-nation trade status to
China, and Beijing has agreed to
several business deals, including
a $1.6 billion purchase of Amer
ican passenger aircraft.
Talks with Japan and South
Korea were likely to center on
trade and North Korea's agree
ment to freeze and ultimately
dismantle facilities suspected of
being capable of producing
nuclear weapons.
Questions about Clinton's
political standing and the
impact of last week's historic
GOP wins followed the presi
dent on a fast-paced state visit
yesterday to the Philippines, the
first by an American president
in 19 years.
Before flying to Indonesia,
Clinton commemorated World
War II victories in the Pacific
and toured bomb-ravaged Cor

regidor, the scene of fierce fight
ing and Allied humiliation a
half-century ago. The island
fortress in Manila Bay was cap
tured by Japan after Gen. Dou
glas Mac Arthur, under orders
from Franklin D. Roosevelt, fled
to Australia, pledging, "I shall
return."
"Gen. Mac Arthur did return,
and so would freedom," Clinton
said at the Manila American
Cemetery containing the graves
of 17,206 fallen servicemen.
"Countless horrors lay in the
way, including the butchery of
house-to-house fighting in
Manila."
Warmly toasting Clinton
later at Malacanang Palace,
Philippine President Fidel
Ramos sounded regretful about
Clinton's election setbacks.
Praising the president's for
eign policy and economic record,
Ramos said, "These achieve
ments have apparently not had
the recognition that they
deserve in your country."
