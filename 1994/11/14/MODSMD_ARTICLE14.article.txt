SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Two heavily
armed gunmen in bulletproof vests and mil
itary fatigues opened fire in Pacific Heights
last night, hitting two police officers and a
paramedic, police said.
Police returned fire and killed one gun
man in a wild street shootout in the upscale
neighborhood of high-rises and Victorian
houses. The other man was listed in stable
condition at a hospital with a gunshot
wound in the leg, police spokeswoman Bar
bara Davis said.
The bomb squad was called to the scene to
check the dead gunman's body, which police
said may be carrying explosives. Police found
a detonator and wires near a car.
One officer was shot in the head and was
in critical condition at San Francisco Gener
al Hospital, nursing supervisor Gloria
Rodriguez said. A second officer was hit in
the chest and was in serious condition.
"It doesn't look good," Rodriguez said of
the officer wounded in the head.
A paramedic shot in the left forearm was
in stable condition, she said.

The two men had stolen a car in Moun
tain View, 35 miles south of San Francisco,
police said. They then drove to San Francis
co, where they carjacked a woman driving a
BMW near the corner of Franklin and Pine
streets around 6:40 p.m.
When police responded to calls of the car
jacking, the men opened fire.
Police began shooting back, for a gunfight
that witnesses said lasted as long as 25 min
utes.
"It was crazy, it was constant," said Mimi
Mehrabi, who lives on the block. "It was a
really scary thing. Cops were hiding behind
buildings and behind their cars."
The suspects had as many as six guns,
Officer Mark Madsen said, some of them
automatic weapons. The two fired as many
as 200 rounds of ammunition, shattering
car windows, hitting buildings and leaving
bullet holes in vehicles up and down the
block.
They reloaded their weapons several
times and continued firing until officers
shot them, Officer Gary Constantine said.
