Sweden joins EU
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -
Swedes voted yesterday to join the
European Union in a referendum that
could sweep all Nordic nations into the
expanding economic and political bloc.
Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson
declared the referendum approved
after returns showed 52 percent of vot
ers said "Yes" and 47 percent said
"No." Nearly 1 percent of the ballots
were blank.
"The result is good for Sweden and
good for Europe," Carlsson said.
The approval by Sweden should
influence voters in neighboring Norway,
which is holding a referendum on EU
membership in two weeks. Finland said
"Yes" last month and Austria last June.
"Now I think Norway will say 'Yes'
as well," the leader of Norway's conser
vative party, Jan Petersen, told the

Swedish news agency TT.
Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho
held out the prospect of creating a
Nordic block in the EU.
"We have so many things in com
mon ... because of our geographical
position, nature and environment that
if Finland and Sweden can't find each
other within the EU, who can?" Aho
said.
If all four nations join, the Euro
pean Union would grow next year to 16
members, encompassing about 375
million people and an economy worth
$7 trillion a year. They are scheduled
to join Jan. 1.
German memorial
BERLIN (AP) — The German mili
tary for the first time honored Jews
who died fighting for Germany in
World War I during Memorial Day com

memorations yesterday.
In a ceremony attended by Jewish
leaders, Chief of Staff Klaus Naumann
laid a wreath at Berlin's Weissensee
cemetery, where 395 German Jewish
soldiers killed in World War I are
buried.
Last year, Jewish leaders boycotted
the central Memorial Day ceremony,
during which a controversial war
memorial was dedicated in Berlin.
Jewish leaders said the memorial
honoring both war dead and victims of
Nazism did not adequately separate vic
tims from persecutors.
The centerpiece of the memorial in
Neue Wache, or New Guard House, is a
bronze statue of a grieving woman
holding a son killed in battle. At the
base of the statue are urns containing
the ashes of an unknown soldier, a
resistance fighter and a death camp vic
tim.
