staff members and two at-large editorial writers selected from the community by the Dally staff.

WHILE THE ASSU has not
always been the most pro
ductive organization on
campus, its "Bus Back the Axe"
initiative has demonstrated that
something worthwhile can indeed
result from student government.
In a flash of creativity and fore
sight, the ASSU has arranged for
buses to take Stanford students
to and from Big Game on Nov. 19.
In the past, specific residences
took up this task, but difficulties
frequently arose when companies
refused to rent buses to individu
al dormitories.
Under the collective supervi
sion of the ASSU, dorms and indi
viduals have been able to find a
mutually beneficial mode of
transportation to UC-Berkeley in
the creation of the Bus Back the
Axe program. According to
Deputy Senate Chair Michael
Choo, 750 reservations have
already been made, many more

than the ASSU initially projected.
For those who would have
taken public transportation to
Berkeley, the ASSU's program
will eliminate the hassle of the
seemingly endless Caltrain/BART
excursion across the Bay. The
Council of Presidents has esti
mated that travel time on the
ASSU buses will be half of what it
would be using public transporta
tion.
The program will also help
drivers by letting them leave the
worry of swollen traffic jams
behind and concentrate on more
fruitful objectives — like shouting
insults at the Weenies.
Finally, for everyone involved,
the program will foster a true
sense of collective spirit as hun
dreds of students trek to Big
Game together. The ASSU's "Bus
Back the Axe" program is a wel
come addition to the spirit of
Stanford football.
