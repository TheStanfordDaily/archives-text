# Inform voters of rules
## 
### 
Last Tuesday, stu
dents around campus
exercised their right to vote
on important issues facing the
area. Unfortunately, many were
stunned to find that right denied
them due to confusion about the
formalities of the voting process.
According to California law, a
voter must reregister after any
change of name, residence or party
affiliation. Many did not realize
that this regulation applies to stu
dents — who usually change resi
dences every year — and conse
quently could not participate in
the elections.
If students fail to reregister,
they usually receive sample ballots
anyway in their post office boxes.
They may then vote at their
assigned site on Election Day, but
their ballots must be verified by
the registrar of voters in order to
be tallied. If a student's new resi
dence does not match the resi
dence listed in registration

records, his or her ballot is dis
carded.
Voters were also confused about
the locations of polling sites. With
the campus divided into 12 sepa
rate precincts, several students
were unsure of where to vote and
flooded the registrar of voters'
office with calls.
To prevent such disorder in the
future, the registrar of voters
should make efforts to ensure that
students at Stanford and other
local colleges are aware of registra
tion policies well before Election
Day. Otherwise, these mix-ups
may alienate a large number of
young voters.
While this year has seen an
admirable and impressive rise of
student activism on campus, these
efforts to promote awareness
about important political issues
and to encourage students to vote
on them are in vain if the voice of
the students is snuffed out by legal
technicalities.
