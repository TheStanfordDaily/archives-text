## Taking the long way home 
### 
Sometimes, i take the long way
home. I may be at Tresidder and
detour through the Quad on my
way back to Castano. Or I drop by the
Sculpture Garden en route from Build
ing 60 to the Post Office. If it's a clear,
moonlit night, a stroll down Palm Drive
may be in order. On a particularly nice
day, I may even walk up to the Dish and
catch the view of the campus, the Bay
and the Foothills.
This is admittedly not the most time
saving way to get from one place to
another on a hectic day. But it serves a
purpose.
Sometime, on a starry night, stand in
the middle of the rosette at the center of
the Main Quad. Look to the north, past
Memorial Court and the Burghers of
Calais, down Palm Drive, toward the
real world. Think of the management
consultants, the venture capitalists and
the investment bankers whose acumen
keeps the wheels of the economy in
motion. Think of the homeless beggars
at Lytton Plaza carving out their exis
tence, living from hand to mouth. Think
of the minds of Silicon Valley matching
their wits with the buggiest of algo
rithms and locked in mortal combat
with the most obstinate of operating
systems.
Then, turn around and face the mosa
ic depiction of a scene from one of
humanity's great epics. This is one of
my favorite artifacts on campus (I was
rather crushed when a visiting friend

once told me the Quad would look better
without it). Regardless of what one
thinks of its religious connotations, it is
emblematic of humankind's endeavor to
press beyond its self-imposed bound
aries, to overcome the limitations dictat
ed by our seeming affinity for the dust
we strive to rise above.
Most fitting for an institute of higher
learning, I think.
Surrounding you now is the academic
heart of the University. A construct of
stone and tiles and glass, as well as a
number of palm trees, the Quad is archi
tecturally imposing yet not overwhelm
ing, combining monumental simplicity
with a dose of Californian lightness of
being. As a work of art and architecture,
it is beautiful in its own right and com
mands one's attention.
But the Quad is not just lifeless mat
ter. The walls tell stories of great attain
ments in the sciences, engineering and
the humanities and the ongoing effort to
infuse more or less willing young minds
with the skills and creativity necessary
to attain greatness of their own. Noth
ing moves, except the occasional
rollerblader, yet the place is pulsating
with the unseen and quiet power of
curiosity and perseverance. The
columns channel the intellectual energy
though the arcades, past the archways
and into the world beyond.
Without us to observe and interpret
it, the material world around us would
indeed be lifeless and devoid of beauty.

To paraphrase the 18th-century aes
thetician Archibald Alison, "the quali
ties of matter are not to be considered as
sublime or beautiful in themselves," but
only to the extent that they reflect and
stimulate qualities within ourselves.
Beauty is inspiration. The monu
ments to human aspirations and
achievements surrounding us provide a
focus for our thoughts, gathering our
ideas and motivation, molding them into
creative and useful forms. All this is
embedded in a natural environment that
connects us with the universe, remind
ing us that human intellect is but one
source of beauty and grandeur.
The goals of a university are to bring
out the best in human thought, to stim
ulate inquisitiveness and innovation
toward a deeper understanding of the
world and toward the betterment of the
human condition. The edifices and the
natural environment of this university
do not simply provide the physical
resources needed to run an institution,
but rather, if the time is taken to con
template their significance and marvel
at their beauty, they contribute to the
sense of wonder and creativity necessary
to attain these goals.
