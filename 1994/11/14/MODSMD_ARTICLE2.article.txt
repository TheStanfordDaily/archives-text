# Fighting 187
## Students hope to slow effects 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Contributing writer 
Vowing to continue the fight against Proposition
187 while perhaps expanding their efforts to include
broader concerns about racism a group of students
met yesterday in the Asian-American Activities Cen
ter to organize a new plan of attack.
Although the 10 students present recognized that
the immediate fight to defeat Proposition 187 —
which passed in last week's election with 59 percent
of the vote — was over, they were divided over
whether the focus of the new group should be to sim
ply fight the implementation of the measure or to at
tempt to stop racism in general.
If implemented, the measure will make undocu
mented immigrants ineligible for such social services
as health care and education.
"It's a tremendous opportunity for people to come
together to work on things," said senior Jason Pu, an
organizer. "In the short-term, [the
goal is] to stop the implementation
of Proposition 187, but the issues
behind 187 such as racism and clas
sism should also be addressed," he
added.
While recognizing that the con
stitutionality of Proposition 187 is
currently being challenged in two
separate court cases, group mem
bers expressed a continuing need to
fight the measure, discussing vari
ous strategies for inducing change.
The group decided to initiate a
letter-writing campaign to media
organizations in order to keep atten
tion focused on Proposition 187.
Freshman Crystal Carreon, one
of the campaign organizers, said a
letter-writing effort would be effec
tive in ensuring that the impacts of
Proposition 187 were not ignored.
The media "would keep their eyes
and ears open about what we do,"
she added.
The group also discussed plans
to reach out to the different ethnic
organizations and the Stanford
community in general.

These efforts were deemed nec
essary because many people don't
feel affected by the issues of Propo
sition 187 and therefore ignore
them, said senior Emma Luevano.
"People feel really safe here
(from racism issues) and I'm sick of
that," Luevano said. "We have to
show people that they aren't safe
here," she added.
Concrete actions to resist the
impact of Proposition 187 were also
proposed.
Law student Jon Blazer suggest
ed starting a program to give legal
advice to people affected by Propo
sition 187. He also proposed that
the group coordinate with similar
organizations across the country in
an effort to defeat a potential feder
al version of Proposition 187.
The group could also staff the
phones or work in the clinic of Cal
ifornia United, an anti-Proposition
187 organization, Pu said.
All of these issues will be dis
cussed in more detail at the group's
next meeting at 10 p.m. Tuesday in
the Women's Center.
"If we can pull the community
together and make people think
about the issues, [we will] have a
voice, power, and solidarity," Pu
said.
