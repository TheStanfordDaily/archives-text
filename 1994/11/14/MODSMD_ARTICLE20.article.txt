Stance against Prop. 187 was within ASSU's power, duty

IAM WRITING in response to the edi
torial appearing Nov. 9 under the
headline "A borderline crossed," about
the ASSU resolution against Proposition
187, which had by that point passed. I
hope to clear up several misrepresenta
tions in this piece. Though I was not an
author of the bill in question, I write
because I believe that in this case The
Daily editorial board has made claims
based on inadequate research.
The editorial board asserts that the
ASSU Senate is the one campus organi
zation which had no business making a
statement with regards to Prop. 187. In
addition, the board claims that the
approved resolution was in "blatant vio
lation of the ASSU Constitution." This is
simply not the case. The real faults of
this Daily editorial lie in its distortion of
the issues at hand. The ASSU, in fact,
has every right to make a statement on
this particular proposition, on the basis
of a careful reading of the constitution
and examination of this situation.
The editorial stated that "the ASSU
must remain impartial on controversial
off-campus issues." I would maintain that
there are controversial off-campus issues

which student government should be
expected to take a stand on. These include
propositions that affect government finan
cial aid or educational policy changes. We
also have a situation where students are
impacted by a denial of health care they
would experience because they are stu
dents here. It was the decision of the sen
ate that this issue, though controversial
and statewide, had specific effects on stu
dents at Stanford berause of their student
status. A stand has been taken which in
fact is constitutional and has met the
strict standard required.
The Daily asserts that students are
not in fact forced to do anything that
another person living in California
wouldn't have to do. But scrutiny of the
student insurance policy indicates that
students are in fact required to have
health insurance and if not able to fur
nish their own are then required to pur
chase the University plan, which penal
izes students who do not use publicly
funded health-care providers. These are
conditions placed upon Stanford students
as a part of their requirements to be reg
istered as a student. These are not
optional, nor are they shared by most

California residents.
The editorial trivializes the fact that
Stanford students can be forced to prove
legal status to receive medical care at
Stanford Hospital, which, according to
the University insurance policy, students
are required to use (otherwise they
would be able to go to any private health
care provider and would not be subject to
the effects of Prop. 187). This situation is
equated in the editorial with an extreme
ly weak example of a student who steals
textbooks and then is subjected to the
three-strikes initiative. This line of rea
soning implies that getting health care is
the equivalent of stealing books.
The sad fact is that The Daily editorial
board purposely avoided even discussing
constitutionality with any current mem
ber of the ASSU. I believe they instead
turned to a former graduate senator as
the sole source of institutional memory
related to the ASSU. This former senator
wrote a letter to the editor proclaiming
the bill unconstitutional without present
ing any discussion of the bill itself.
Within the bounds of the ASSU Con
stitution, it is the sole responsibility of
the ASSU to represent students on

issues which affect them as Stanford stu
dents — even if this means only one stu
dent. Given the requirements placed on
students by the University health insur
ance policy, a significant portion of our
student body may be suspected to be ille
gal aliens — those with accents or
appearances or languages different than
that of an average white citizen. Some of
these may include international students
or American-born citizens who have mis
placed their documents. In addition, the
processing of legal documentation could
serve to slow down medical service to
other Stanford students required to use
Stanford Hospital.
The ASSU Council of Presidents and
Senate are in fact focusing on strictly
student issues. This is evidenced to date
by the dorm representative system, the
Bus Back the Axe project, work to reform
the special-fee process and demands for
student representation on committees
revising the distribution requirement
system. The ASSU stance in opposition
to Prop. 187 is not inconsistent with
these efforts.
