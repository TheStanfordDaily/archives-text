## Oregon has a 55-21 field day against the Cardinal Team unravels to Gang Green pressure

For all those wondering how long
the magic Scott Frost showed last
week against Washington would
last, the answer came abruptly to
the Stanford faithful.
Throwing an interception on the
First play of the game, the sopho
more quarterback was forced to play
catch-up for the rest of the after
noon as No. 11 Oregon (8-3, 6-1 in
the Pacific 10 Conference) steadily
took apart the Cardinal (3-6-1, 2-5)
55-21 Saturday at Stanford Stadi
um.
Frost's first pass, a short out pat
tern intended for sophomore Brian
Manning, was tipped by Duck cor
nerback Alex Molden into the hands
of linebacker Paul Jensen at the
Stanford 30-yard line. Four plays
later, quarterback Danny O'Neil

found a wide open Cristin
McClemore for the score.
"We came out flat and a little
jumbled and over-anxious," said
senior wide receiver Justin Armour.
"I don't know if we could have beat
en Oregon. They were on all four
cylinders."
Every drive seemed to be punctu
ated with one or two key mistakes
which allowed Oregon to retain
momentum and rack up 532 yards
of total offense, a season-high
against the Cardinal defense. These
seemingly insignificant blunders
added up, as Stanford finished the
day with 12 penalties for 115 yards.
That total was over twice as much as
the Cardinal averaged per game
coming into Saturday's contest.
"I'm disappointed in not only the
outcome but the way the game pro
gressed," head coach Bill Walsh said.
"It's really the first time this year
that we've come unraveled as the
game progressed. We lost a lot with
out an offense."
Despite the shaky start, the loss
cannot be pinned solely on Frost's
shoulders. The defense failed to slow
down the Duck attack and the sec
ondary was victimized by an Oregon

school-record six touchdown passes
by O'Neil. In three quarters of
action, O'Neil was 21-for-37 for 339
yards, all season highs for the senior.
"They were all so wide open,"
O'Neil said, remarking on his six
scoring passes.
Pat Johnson and McClemore
were O'Neil's favorite targets, as
each posted impressive numbers.
Johnson caught seven balls for 128
yards and one touchdown and
McClemore grabbed five passes for
88 yards and three scores.
Previous to this game, Walsh said
Oregon had not shown a potent
offense. However, mental and phys
ical breakdowns on defense led to
the continuation of several Duck
scoring drives.
"I really don't know what was
happening," said freshman defen
sive end Kailee Wong. "A lot of it was
mental errors. They are a lot better
than I expected. They definitely sur
prised me."
For the first 20 minutes of the
game, Stanford played the Ducks
close. Down only 10-0 to start the
second quarter, the Cardinal

urday.
marched 87 yards on nine plays to
get on the scoreboard. On third-and
one from the Oregon 28-yard line,
Frost pivoted the wrong way to find
no running backs awaiting his hand
off. Instead, he improvised around
the right side before cutting back left
across the field for the score. Senior
tight end Tony Cline threw a key
block, upending Molden to clear
Frost's path into the end zone.
While the wild scramble could
have sparked the Cardinal offense,
which only managed 43 yards in the
first quarter, the Oregon defense put
a quick end to those plans. Two
punts and another Frost intercep
tion led to 21 Duck points, propelling
Oregon to a 31-7 halftime lead.
"They are playing very inspired
football," Armour said, referring to

Oregon's "Gang Green" defense.
"They play possessed."
Although Stanford's defense held
the Ducks to only 27 yards on the
ground in the first half, O'Neil had
already thrown for 261 yards and
four scores at intermission.
"Coach Walsh addressed that it
was a new game [in the second
half]," Armour said. "Don't worry
about the score or about what's hap
pened. But Oregon continued to play
us hard and they didn't let down."
Stanford's optimism surround
ing the second half was dismissed as
the Cardinal made continual mental
mistakes which turned into more
Oregon points. Three pass interfer
ence penalties throughout the
course of the game, an unsports
manlike conduct penalty and a per
sonal foul on the Ducks' first scoring
drive of the second half were all
indicative of Stanford's frustration.
After a one-yard scoring plunge
by freshman Anthony Bookman

made the score 38-14 in the third
quarter, Oregon responded by
returning the kickoff 92 yards to the
Cardinal seven-yard line. Although
the Ducks only managed a field goal
after the impressive return by Ricky
Whittle, it signified one of Oregon's
keys to dominating the game, the
battle for field position.
Playing a short field, the Ducks'
average starting position was at
their own 41-yard line, compared to
Stanford's 22-yard line average
start. Four of Oregon's nine scoring
drives started inside Cardinal terri
tory, while Stanford's best start was
at their own 36.
After the rough beginning, Frost
settled down to play a respectable
game. Completing 18 of 38 passes
for 264 yards and one touchdown, he
also led the team with 56 yards rush
ing on eight carries. Senior Mark
Butterfield came in during the
fourth quarter throwing five com
pletions for 11 passes for 72 yards

and an interception.
"I really wasn't nervous," Frost
said. "I had a few bad breaks and
made some mental mistakes early,
but as the game went on I got into
the flow of things. I was happy with
the way I did some things, but how I
played is a big part of whether or not
the team wins. We lost the game, so
obviously I didn't do well enough."
Walsh held a similar view on the
sophomore's first career start,
replacing senior Steve Stenstrom
who is out for the season with a bro
ken right little finger.
"After some shaky plays, he
[Frost] began to get the feel of the
game," Walsh said. "But naturally
we didn't have the offense in sync
with a big change like that."
The muddy field and relentless
Duck defense made it difficult for
Bookman to utilize his speed out of
the backfield. He carried 15 times for
38 yards and a touchdown as Stan
ford only managed 116 yards on the

ground, its lowest total in five
games.
"It was a soup field in no time,"
Armour said. "And they filled it with
manure, which made it worse. It
smelled like a barnyard out there."
The one bright spot to come out
of Saturday's thrashing at the
hands of the Ducks was Armour's
record-setting performance.
Catching nine passes for 131
yards, the senior became Stan
ford's all-time career leader in
receiving yardage with 2,459. The
senior surpassed Ken Margerum's
record of 2,430 yards, which was
set from 1977-1980. However,
Armour was quick to recognize
the context in which he set the
record.
"It means that I had great team
mates and played with a great quar
terback and got great support,"
Armour said. "It's a reference to a lot
of hard work from a lot of different
people. I was just here at the right

time."
Armour was among 22 seniors
who played their final games at
Stanford Stadium. Wearing a shirt
with "My Last Walk 11-12-94"
written across the front, Armour
looked back at the day's game with
a great fondness for his time as a
Cardinal.
"It was hard," he said. "I was
with Steve [Stenstrom] and David
Shaw and I kept cracking jokes just
to keep myself from getting too emo
tional. This is the most special time
of my life, and I don't really want it
to end but it's got to."
The 55 points surrendered by
Stanford marked the most points
given up since 1981, when the Car
dinal lost to Arizona State 62-36.
After such a humbling loss, all the
team can do now is spend the next
week getting Frost more accus
tomed to running the offense in
preparation for Big Game at Cal's
Memorial Stadium this Saturday.
