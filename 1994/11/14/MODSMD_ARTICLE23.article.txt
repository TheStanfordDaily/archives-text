For all those wondering how long
the magic Scott Frost showed last
week against Washington would
last, the answer came abruptly to
the Stanford faithful.
Throwing an interception on the
First play of the game, the sopho
more quarterback was forced to play
catch-up for the rest of the after
noon as No. 11 Oregon (8-3, 6-1 in
the Pacific 10 Conference) steadily
took apart the Cardinal (3-6-1, 2-5)
55-21 Saturday at Stanford Stadi
um.
Frost's first pass, a short out pat
tern intended for sophomore Brian
Manning, was tipped by Duck cor
nerback Alex Molden into the hands
of linebacker Paul Jensen at the
Stanford 30-yard line. Four plays
later, quarterback Danny O'Neil

found a wide open Cristin
McClemore for the score.
"We came out flat and a little
jumbled and over-anxious," said
senior wide receiver Justin Armour.
"I don't know if we could have beat
en Oregon. They were on all four
cylinders."
Every drive seemed to be punctu
ated with one or two key mistakes
which allowed Oregon to retain
momentum and rack up 532 yards
of total offense, a season-high
against the Cardinal defense. These
seemingly insignificant blunders
added up, as Stanford finished the
day with 12 penalties for 115 yards.
That total was over twice as much as
the Cardinal averaged per game
coming into Saturday's contest.
"I'm disappointed in not only the
outcome but the way the game pro
gressed," head coach Bill Walsh said.
"It's really the first time this year
that we've come unraveled as the
game progressed. We lost a lot with
out an offense."
Despite the shaky start, the loss
cannot be pinned solely on Frost's
shoulders. The defense failed to slow
down the Duck attack and the sec
ondary was victimized by an Oregon

school-record six touchdown passes
by O'Neil. In three quarters of
action, O'Neil was 21-for-37 for 339
yards, all season highs for the senior.
"They were all so wide open,"
O'Neil said, remarking on his six
scoring passes.
Pat Johnson and McClemore
were O'Neil's favorite targets, as
each posted impressive numbers.
Johnson caught seven balls for 128
yards and one touchdown and
McClemore grabbed five passes for
88 yards and three scores.
Previous to this game, Walsh said
Oregon had not shown a potent
offense. However, mental and phys
ical breakdowns on defense led to
the continuation of several Duck
scoring drives.
"I really don't know what was
happening," said freshman defen
sive end Kailee Wong. "A lot of it was
mental errors. They are a lot better
than I expected. They definitely sur
prised me."
For the first 20 minutes of the
game, Stanford played the Ducks
close. Down only 10-0 to start the
second quarter, the Cardinal
