# O'Neil chalks up career-highs
## 
### Andrew Blachman Editorial staff 
Those who showed up at Stanford Stadium on Satur
day hoping to see a record-setting Pacific 10 Conference
quarterback have his way with an opposing defense got
their wish.
Unfortunately for Stanford fans, that quarterback
was not the Cardinal's Steve Stenstrom.
With Stenstrom out for the remainder of the year
with a broken right little finger, Oregon quarterback
Danny O'Neil filled the void — providing Cardinal faith
ful with their usual weekly dose of passing highlights.
O'Neil lit up the Stanford secondary for 339 yards
passing and an all-time University of Oregon record six
touchdown passes in the Ducks' 55-21 pasting of the
Cardinal. He accomplished all that through just three
quarters of play before giving way to Oregon's second
and third string quarterbacks to mercifully conclude the
rout.

"I felt pretty darn good out there today," O'Neil said
in the locker room after the game. "My offensive line just
played great the entire game and when that happens it
makes things pretty easy for me as a quarterback."
The formidable line, coupled with a porous Stanford
defense, made things almost too easy for the lanky Duck
quarterback.
O'Neil put the ball up in the air 37 times without
being sacked and was almost never under pressure from
the Cardinal defensive rushers. Throughout the entire
game, O'Neil was only knocked down twice — both
times after he scrambled out of the pocket.
"I never axpected to have that much time to sit there
and throw the ball and look off receivers," the senior
said. "But the only times I got hit were when I got anx
ious and started running. The wet and muddy field real
ly hampered our running game and meant that we were
going to have to pass more and I was excited about that."
Despite the muddy field, O'Neil's jersey was in pris-
tine white condition after the game
— a testament to Stanford's lack of
ability to pressure the quarterback.
"Evidently we don't play pass
defense. Period," said Stanford head
coach Bill Walsh. "We don't get to
the passer or even get close to the
passer."
The Stanford secondary also had
trouble staying with Oregon
receivers all day long, taking even
more pressure off of O'NeiL On the
Ducks' first possession of the game
O'Neil dropped back to pass at the
Stanford 22-yard line and spotted
flanker Cristin McLemore wide
open breaking toward the end zone.
"I looked up and I saw Mac all
alone and I actually froze for a sec
ond and got nervous," O'Neil said.
"I thouglit there must be someone
there that I wasn't seeing because

there was no way he could have been
that open."
But McLemore caught the ball
without a defender in sight and
waltzed into the end zone for the
first of his three touchdown grabs of
the day. "[O'Neil] is doing a great job
for us right now and I'm just proud
to be a part of it," said McLemore,
who also set a new Oregon record
with 18 career touchdown recep
tions.
For the game, O'Neil completed
21 of his 37 pass attempts without
throwing an interception. His six
touchdown tosses broke his own
school record of four — a feat he's
accomplished twice before in his col
lege career.
"I've always imagined getting
the record but I never thought it
would happen," he said. "I've never
thrown six touchdowns before —
not even in high school. It feels
good to get [the record] especially
when the game is this important to
us."

By halflime O'Neil had already
thrown for 261 yards and four
touchdowns in a game which the
1 lth-ranked Ducks dominated from
start to finish. With the win, Oregon
improved to 8-3 overall and 6-1 in
the Pac-10.
"Danny O'Neil is an outstanding
quarterback," said Oregon head
coach Rich Brooks. "We've known
that since the beginning of the year
and we would not be in the position
that we're in without him."
That position has the Ducks
primed for a run at the Rose Bowl.
With a win against Oregon State
next Saturday, Oregon will earn
their first trip to Pasadena since
1958.
"There isn't a team out there
which wants to win more than we
do," O'Neil said. "We can't start
looking ahead to the Rose Bowl
because we have a tough game this
week against a really solid team. If
we aren't prepared we're going to
come home crying."
