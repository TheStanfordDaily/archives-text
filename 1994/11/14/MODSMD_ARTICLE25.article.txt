Washington 5
Stanford 1
Portland 2

A tie can sometimes be as good
as a win, but a loss always spells
defeat.
After surviving a penalty-kick
shootout against Washington (13-
6-2) on Saturday, the Stanford
women's soccer team's season
came to an abrupt end in sudden
death overtime yesterday in a 2-1
loss to host Portland (16-5).


Mark Leibowitz — Daily file
Freshman Jen Royval breaks away in a recent game against the
Huskies.
The top-seeded Cardinal (16-2-
2) failed to score in regulation the
entire weekend. Sophomore full
back/midfielder Suzie Boots, who
had only one career shot on goal
before this month, provided the
only offensive punch for Stanford.
Her penalty kick sent the Huskies
home, and the first goal of her
career extended yesterday's battle
to sudden death.
Boots' heroics and stellar
defense from senior goalkeeper
Jennifer Poehler could not over
come the troubles of the dormant
Cardinal offense. Poehler extend
ed the longest scoreless streak of
her career to 561 minutes, 11 sec
onds before allowing the first of
two goals to Pilots star forward
Tiffany Milbrett.
Poehler stopped everything in
sight until a collision took her out
with only 25 seconds remaining in
regulation. Without a back-up
goalkeeper, head coach lan
Sawyers turned to freshman full
back Melissa Moore, who played at
goalie in two preseason scrim
mages. Moore completed regula
tion, but Poehler returned to the
net for overtime.
Unfortunately, her effective
ness diminished with her injury.
Milbrett, who scored three times
in Portland's 6-0 victory over St.
Mary's on Saturday and entered
the tournament third in the
nation with 25 coals, finally broke

the ice just 24 seconds before the
end of the first 15-minute over
time. Her 29th goal of the season,
a 14-yard bouncer toward the far
post, was assisted by Maria Schue
man.
Desperate for a goal before the
conclusion of the second and
potentially final overtime, Boots
gave Stanford new life. A perfect
left cross from freshman midfield
er Elie Foster set up Boots for a
header from three yards out. Fos
ter, normally a starter, came off
the bench to get her second assist
of 1994.
The teams remained tied after
the second overtime, but in region
al final play, two 15-minute sud
den-death extra periods are added.
The additional time increases the
chance that the outcome will not
be settled by penalty kicks.
Unfortunately for the top-seed
ed Cardinal, Milbrett ensured that
no shootout would be necessary.
Her unassisted score after 129:04
of play sent a surprisingly small
crowd of 1,727 into a frenzy and
gave Portland its first-ever post
season victory over the Cardinal in
three tries.
Stanford was fortunate to be
alive for the Portland matchup
after Saturday's monumental
struggle against Washington. The
Huskies, which gave Stanford fits
in a 2-0 loss at Maloney Field on
Nov. 4, stretched Stanford to the
limit.
As in the Portland game,
Poehler's shutout streak was pro
longed by a shot off the post. In
the 32nd minute, the Huskies'

leading scorer, Samantha Obara,
fired from just inside the box but
was denied by the iron. Obara s
near-miss was one of six Washing
ton attempts in the first 45 min
utes, while Stanford was held to
just one for its lowest output of
1994.
Both teams managed eight
shots through the second half and
the two 15-minute overtimes.
Since the game was a regional
semifinal, the sudden-death OT
was by-passed for a penalty kick
shootout.
Stanford, which was knocked
out of the 1993 Final Four in a
shootout against George Mason,
started the shootout with a score
by junior fullback Jessica Fischer.
Stanford had a 2-1 lead after four
kicks, but leading scorer Erin Mar
tin was denied on the fifth shot by
Washington goalkeeper Tina
Thompson. The Huskies then tied
the score, and the teams
exchanged goals until a 4-4 dead
lock after the scheduled 10 kicks.
The tension mounted as the
teams continued to alternate until
one pulled ahead. Foster scored,
but Terry Gleason kept the Husky
hopes alive. Finally, Boots put the
Cardinal ahead 6-5 and Sanya
Trandum's shot was saved by
Poehler to allow the Cardinal to
escape.
Since the outcome was decided
by a shootout, the game is official
ly recorded as a 0-0 tie. Coupled
with the loss to Portland, the Car
dinal ended the season with a .850
winning percentage, its lowest in
four vears.

the ice just 24 seconds before the
end of the first 15-minute over
time. Her 29th goal of the season,
a 14-yard bouncer toward the far
post, was assisted by Maria Schue
man.
Desperate for a goal before the
conclusion of the second and
potentially final overtime, Boots
gave Stanford new life. A perfect
left cross from freshman midfield
er Elie Foster set up Boots for a
header from three yards out. Fos
ter, normally a starter, came off
the bench to get her second assist
of 1994.
The teams remained tied after
the second overtime, but in region
al final play, two 15-minute sud
den-death extra periods are added.
The additional time increases the
chance that the outcome will not
be settled by penalty kicks.
Unfortunately for the top-seed
ed Cardinal, Milbrett ensured that
no shootout would be necessary.
Her unassisted score after 129:04
of play sent a surprisingly small
crowd of 1,727 into a frenzy and
gave Portland its first-ever post
season victory over the Cardinal in
three tries.
Stanford was fortunate to be
alive for the Portland matchup
after Saturday's monumental
struggle against Washington. The
Huskies, which gave Stanford fits
in a 2-0 loss at Maloney Field on
Nov. 4, stretched Stanford to the
limit.
As in the Portland game,
Poehler's shutout streak was pro
longed by a shot off the post. In
the 32nd minute, the Huskies'

leading scorer, Samantha Obara,
fired from just inside the box but
was denied by the iron. Obara s
near-miss was one of six Washing
ton attempts in the first 45 min
utes, while Stanford was held to
just one for its lowest output of
1994.
Both teams managed eight
shots through the second half and
the two 15-minute overtimes.
Since the game was a regional
semifinal, the sudden-death OT
was by-passed for a penalty kick
shootout.
Stanford, which was knocked
out of the 1993 Final Four in a
shootout against George Mason,
started the shootout with a score
by junior fullback Jessica Fischer.
Stanford had a 2-1 lead after four
kicks, but leading scorer Erin Mar
tin was denied on the fifth shot by
Washington goalkeeper Tina
Thompson. The Huskies then tied
the score, and the teams
exchanged goals until a 4-4 dead
lock after the scheduled 10 kicks.
The tension mounted as the
teams continued to alternate until
one pulled ahead. Foster scored,
but Terry Gleason kept the Husky
hopes alive. Finally, Boots put the
Cardinal ahead 6-5 and Sanya
Trandum's shot was saved by
Poehler to allow the Cardinal to
escape.
Since the outcome was decided
by a shootout, the game is official
ly recorded as a 0-0 tie. Coupled
with the loss to Portland, the Car
dinal ended the season with a .850
winning percentage, its lowest in
four vears.
