# Runners win at District-8s
## Women take all; men garner second 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
The Stanford cross country teams are
headed to the big dance.
On a rain-soaked course in Tucson,
Ariz., the Cardinal women and men quali
fied for the national championships on
Saturday by taking first and second place,
respectively, in the NCAA District-8
championships.
"Quite honestly, it was an impressive
performance all the way around," said
head coach Vin Lananna. "I was so
impressed with how our athletes rose to
the occasion."
Freshman Kortney Dunscombe, who
has been tops among the Stanford women
all year, led the Cardinal to the District-8
title. Dunscombe finished in fourth place,
with a time of 17 minutes, 45 seconds.
"I think that, with the conditions, I was
where I wanted to be," said Dunscombe.
"The race went very well."
Saturday's race again exhibited the
depth of the women's team — when one
runner is not at her peak, another steps up
and takes charge.
In the past two weeks sophomore
Monal Chokshi has been one of the run
ners to step up for the Cardinal. Chokshi
took 10th place at the Pac-10 champi
onships, then bettered her performance

this past weekend by taking eighth place
with a time of 18:05.
"Because our team runs in a tight pack,
I could see everyone on the team," said
Chokshi of her performance. "I felt really
secure out there."
Chokshi also believed the inclement
weather was a benefit to the Cardinal.
"We had to run through water six times
throughout the course," she said. "We
totally psyched ourselves up and didn't let
the rain get to us."
Lananna is not so quick to claim the
weather as a benefit, but said overall he
really didn't care about it."I don't know
what caused what to happen," he said. "All
I know is the women went out and got the
job done."
For the men's team, the trip to Tuscon
was nearly as successful as the women's,
as they beat such teams as Oregon, UCLA
and Washington — teams they lost to in
the Pac-10 meet.
The Cardinal men silenced their critics
this weekend by putting together one of
the finest races of the season.
"I think the biggest difference was that
things were on the line," said Lananna,
comparing his team's performances in the
last two meets.
"I don't think any of the guys wanted
the season to be measured by a
fifth place finish in the Pac-lO's,"
he added. "In fact, our finish two
weeks ago made this weekend's
finish even better."
Sophomore Greg Jimmerson,
who finished third this weekend
with a time of 31:14, felt the
men's attitude going into this
weekend ,was a major factor in
their performance.
"I think we might have gone
into [the Pac-lO's] too seriously.
We put to much pressure on our
selves," he said. "This time we
just tried to have fun — I think
teams weren't looking for us to
win."
Following Jimmerson for Stan
ford was sophomore J.J. White,
who finished sixth overall with a
time of 31:25. White felt that the
team finally came together in
Tucson.
"I think everyone pulled
together and did what we were
capable of," he said. "We realized
it was do or die time, and everyone
ran through the past problems."
