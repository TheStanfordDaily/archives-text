A warning to those further down the line — the
engineers have gotten the train back on track.
After last week's split in Los Angeles which mem
bers of the No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball team
called "less than satisfactory," the Cardinal returned
home to the friendly confines of Maples Pavilion this
past weekend to make amends.
Stanford (23-1 overall, 15-1 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference) swept No. 15 Arizona State (15-9, 9-7) on
Friday evening 15-9, 15-5, 15-11 and dealt with No.
16 Arizona in much the same manner the following
night, winning 15-4,15-6, 15-6.
If there were any who doubted the team after the
trip south, these victories served to reaffirm the Car-
dinal's steadfast grip of the game.
Players were definitely happy with
the rebound.
"It was a 100 percent turn
around," said senior Denise Rotert.
"Eveiything was clicking."
The squad remained focused and
on target throughout each match

this weekend. In a few previous out
ings, some players felt that their
level of intensity was rising and
Hilling too much.
"I was pleased because we played
evenly the whole time," said senior
Anne Wicks. "There was no let
down. We stayed intent on what we
were doing out there."
Rotert and Wicks, the squad's
only seniors, were honored on Sat
urday night before the start of their
final regular-season home match.

"I had a great time," Wicks said.
"I can't take any of this for granted.
I only have four or five more weeks.
I have to enjoy the chance to play
with these fabulous young women
and this great coaching staff in front
of all these wonderful people."
The captain had an outstanding
weekend. Against the Sun Devils,
Wicks had eight kills on nine
attempts for an .889 hitting percent
age. Her Saturday night encore
included five more kills, two solo
blocks and four block assists.
"[Wicks is] definitely coming on
strong," said Stanford head coach
Don Shaw. "And right when we
need it most."
Wicks and fellow middle blocker
Barbara Ifejika led the charge
against Arizona State. Stanford's
middle attack overpowered the Sun
Devils' right-side as the Cardinal
jumped out to a 7-1 lead in game
one. The trash-talking Devils fought
back to close the gap to 8-4, but
never came closer as Stanford tri
umphed.
Wicks had five kills and three
blocks as the Cardinal ran away and
hid in game two. She came out on top
in a head-to-head matchup with
ASU's junior outside hitter and lead
ing trash-talker Christine Garner.
The Devils proved more tena
cious in the third contest, matching
Stanford point for point to a 7-7
deadlock. At that time, a Kristin
Folkl kill gave the serve back to the
Cardinal. Then, Ifejika and fresh
man setter lisa Sharpley teamed up
on a block that ignited a 7-0 run.
ASU tried to come back, but Ifejika
sealed their fate with a lightning
quick kill.
Stanford held the Sun Devils to a
.072 hitting percentage in a defen
sive battle. Garner led ASU with a
.211 mark and 15 kills. Stanford
spread the wealth more liberally
with players registering five or more
kills.
It was much the same story on
Saturday night. Stanford repeat
edly ran out to a quick lead and
played outstanding defense. The
Wildcats managed negative hit
ting percentages in both games
one and three against the red apd
white walls put up by Cardinal
blockers.
"They [Arizona] were just up
there trying to beat it through the
block," Shaw said. "They couldn't
do it tonight."
The match lasted a mere hour
and six minutes as the Cardinal
wasted no time in dispensing with
the 'Cats. The Cardinal registered a
.244 team hitting percentage, slight
ly below its average, but well above
Arizona's mark of .038.
"They didn't really do anything
we didn't expect them to do," Shaw
said. "It was pretty much the same
things we saw when we were down
there."
