For the water polo teams in the
Mountain-Pacific Sports Federa
tion, the conference tournament
held in Long Beach, Calif., this
weekend was a dress rehearsal for
the upcoming NCAA champi
onships.

Stanford can't wait for the real
thing.
The Cardinal (23-1), which
began the weekend with a 19-6
non-conference win against UC-
San Diego, cruised through the
MPSF tourney virtually unchal
lenged, defeating No. 2 USC in the
finals.
In the fifth match-up of the year
between the two rival schools, the
Cardinal dominated from the
opening whistle. The result was a
17-7 thrashing of the Trojans, and
the first conference title for Stan
ford since 1986.
The Cardinal dominated in all
phases of the game, taking an early
6-0 lead over USC. The defense
was led by goaltender Jack Bo wen,
who collected 10 saves in three
