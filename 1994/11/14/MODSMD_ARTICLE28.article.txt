For the water polo teams in the
Mountain-Pacific Sports Federa
tion, the conference tournament
held in Long Beach, Calif., this
weekend was a dress rehearsal for
the upcoming NCAA champi
onships.

Stanford can't wait for the real
thing.
The Cardinal (23-1), which
began the weekend with a 19-6
non-conference win against UC-
San Diego, cruised through the
MPSF tourney virtually unchal
lenged, defeating No. 2 USC in the
finals.
In the fifth match-up of the year
between the two rival schools, the
Cardinal dominated from the
opening whistle. The result was a
17-7 thrashing of the Trojans, and
the first conference title for Stan
ford since 1986.
The Cardinal dominated in all
phases of the game, taking an early
6-0 lead over USC. The defense
was led by goaltender Jack Bo wen,
who collected 10 saves in three


Henry Hsu — Dally file
Brian Wallin and a Pacific opponent tussle for possession in a recent
match. Wallin scored three goals against UCSD this weekend
quarters of work. Bowen bene
fited from a crashing defense
which limited the Trojan's lead
ing scorer, Hrvoje Cizmic, to one
goal from close range.
Offensively, senior Wolf Wigo
continued to make his case for
Player of the Year honors. The
three time All-American scored a
career-high seven points to lead
the attack on the Trojan net.
Wigo scored in just about
every possible way, netting two
two-point shots, a penalty shot,
a goal in a man-advantage situa
tion and one natural goal. Earli
er this year, Wigo established a
career high of six goals, also
against USC.
While Dettamanti was obvi
ously pleased with the game's
outcome, he admitted there
were factors which limited the
play of the Trojans.
"In all fairness to USC, they
had a very tough game just
hours before," Dettamanti said.
The Trojans were pushed to
double-overtime in a semi-final

match with No. 3 California.
"USC rolled over," Detta
manti said. "They were just
exhausted, both mentally and
physically. I expect that if we
play them at the NCAAs, they
will be a completely different
team. Their game with Cal was
physical and emotional — it took
too much out of them."
Stanford started the weekend
further south in San Diego for a
match with No. 12 UCSD. The
Cardinal jumped out quickly,
scoring three two-point goals in
the first three minutes of play,
two by Jeremy Laster and the
other from the arm of Wigo.
In what Dettamanti called a
warm-up for the MPSF tourna
ment, nine Stanford players
scored goals, led by Laster with
four and Brian Wallin and Brian
Pyle with three apiece.
On its way to the MPSF tour
nament finals, Stanford defeat
ed No. 6 UC-Santa Barbara 12-9
on Saturday, then took care of
No. 4 Pepperdine by a final of
14-9 in its first match yesterday.
The Cardinal found its open
ing round victory over the Gau
chos to be its toughest test of
the tournament, as UCSB made

a valiant attempt to qualify for
the NCAA tourney.
"UCSB shaved and tapered
for these games," Dettamanti
said. "They needed a big win —
for them, it was like a champi
onship game."
The Gauchos played with
heart, leading Stanford 6-5 at
the half and 7-5 seconds into the
third quarter before Josh Leach
man's two-point goal set off a
string of six unanswered Cardi
nal goals.
Against Pepperdine, Stanford
dominated after a close first
half. The Cardinal led by as
many as six goals behind the
offensive output of Wigo and
Wallin, who each scored three
times.
In addition to Wigo's seven
goals, fellow senior Frank
Schneider played an impressive
match, netting four goals of his
own while dishing out several
assists.
The NCAA finals will be held
at the same site as the MPSF
tournament, Nov. 25-27.
The dress rehearsal went off
beautifully. Now the Stanford
water polo team is ready for the
big show.
