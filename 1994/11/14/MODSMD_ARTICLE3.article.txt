# CUE recommends no CIV for transfers
## Students will be able to choose three appropriate courses as alternatives 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Just two years after the Faculty
Senate rejected a similar proposal, the
Commission on Undergraduate Edu
cation has recommended that transfer
students be able to substitute three
"appropriate" courses for the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values requirement.
Such courses could include upper
level classes that cover material similar
to CIV tracks, said junior Laura

Goodrich, a transfer student who
served on the commission's subcom
mittee on breadth requirements.
History Prof. James Sheehan, the
commission's chair, said that "looking
at the CIV requirement from the trans
fer students' point of view" convinced
the commission to re-introduce the
proposal.
The commission found that CIV is a
"uniquely freshman course" that is
"not clearly applicable to transfer stu
dents," he addtxl.

Furthermore, the CIV requirement
significantly limits a transfer student's
ability to choose courses, Sheehan said.
A three-quarter sequence of CIV
amounts to 15 units, which for juniors
— who normally have to take 90 units
here to complete a degree — equals
one-sixth of their Stanford course
work.
"That's a big chunk," Sheehan said.
"It doesn't make sense, nor does it
seem fair, to load transfer students
down with courses."

The commission's rationale for the
proposal differs significantly from the
reasoning behind the original proposal
considered by the senate in May 1992,
Sheehan said.
That proposal was presented largely
on "budgetary grounds," said Shee
han, who voted against it.
According to the original proposal,
the University could cut back the num
ber of lecturers needed for CIV by
about one lecturer and a half by no
longer requiring transfer stu
dents to take the course.
Of the approximately 150
transfer students this year, about
110 are presently enrolled in CIV,
said Margaret Harris, the pro
gram's coordinator. The other
transfer students fulfilled the CIV
requirement by taking a compara
ble course at another school.
However, many faculty mem
bers involved in the senate debate
"didn't buy" the financial savings
argument, said Classics Prof.
Marsh McCall, a member of the
senate at the time.
Sheehan said although the com
mission's proposal will save some
money, budgetary concerns are
not the main purpose of the new
recommendation. Rather, the rec
ommendation is designed to be
more effective in meeting the
needs of transfer students.
The original proposal also
argued that transfer students
"didn't fit into CIV," but that
assertion did not match many fac
ulty members' experiences. Shee

han said.
McCall, who teaches the
Humanities CIV track this quar
ter, said he hits always had good
experiences with transfer students
in the course. "They bring a slight
ly different perspective to the
course than freshmen do," he said.
But History Prof. Paul Seaver,
director of the CIV program and
one of the presenters of the 1992
proposal, said that CUV "tends not
to be an optimal situation for
transfer students."
Often transfer students use
their previous experience to domi
nate the conversations, or else
they are afraid of monopolizing
discussions and therefore remain
silent, he said.
"CIV is a peculiarly freshmen
experience," he said. "Transfers
can make better use of their time."
The senate's Committee on
Undergraduate Studies will con
sider the new recommendation,
said Political Science Prof David
Brady, the committee chair. The
senate will then vote on the recom
mendation.
Although Sheehan said he is
unsure when the proposal will
come before the senate, he antici
pates that it will pass.

He added that the original pro
posal probably would have been
approved if it had been presented
in a better manner.
Transfer students say they are
likewise "optimistic" that the pro
posal will be approved, and are
willing to do anything they can to
convince senate members to let
them out of a "very frustrating"
requirement.
Senior Tony Sabadini, who
transferred from Colby College in
Maine, said he views the commis
sion's recommendation as a "sign
that the University is at least
being a little more understanding
of our situation as transfers."
Sabadini's personal experience
with CIV was "very frustrating,"
he added.
"I went in first quarter and I'd
already read most of the books and
I already knew how to write a
paper," he said.
Sabadini said he also found it
"frustrating" that transfer stu
dents were limited when choosing
which CIV track they wanted to
take.
"My year we were told to plan
on not getting into our first
choice," he said. "We were told
we'd fill in the empty spots in the

tracks."
If transfers are required to take
CIV, then they should have the
same opportunity as freshmen to
pick which track they want to
take, he added.
Goodrich, who transferred from
Holy Cross College in Mas
sachusetts, said that most transfer
students are at a level "way
above" the average freshman.
She added that she has heard
"horror stories" about transfers
who "have to stay an extra year
just to take CIV" or "who can't do
honors work because of CIV."
CIV equals one quarter's
tuition approximately $6,200 —
and it is "financially unfair" to
make transfer students stay on an
extra year or be unable to do hon
ors work because of the CIV
requirement, Goodrich said.
Sabadini and Goodrich agreed
that the commission's recommen
dation is a much better way for
transfers to fulfill the CIV require
ment.
Goodrich said the new recom
mendation will allow transfer stu
dents much more flexibility in
choosing classes. The "appropriate"
courses could be chosen to fit into a
transfer student's major, she said.

ulty members' experiences. Shee

han said.
McCall, who teaches the
Humanities CIV track this quar
ter, said he hits always had good
experiences with transfer students
in the course. "They bring a slight
ly different perspective to the
course than freshmen do," he said.
But History Prof. Paul Seaver,
director of the CIV program and
one of the presenters of the 1992
proposal, said that CUV "tends not
to be an optimal situation for
transfer students."
Often transfer students use
their previous experience to domi
nate the conversations, or else
they are afraid of monopolizing
discussions and therefore remain
silent, he said.
"CIV is a peculiarly freshmen
experience," he said. "Transfers
can make better use of their time."
The senate's Committee on
Undergraduate Studies will con
sider the new recommendation,
said Political Science Prof David
Brady, the committee chair. The
senate will then vote on the recom
mendation.
Although Sheehan said he is
unsure when the proposal will
come before the senate, he antici
pates that it will pass.

He added that the original pro
posal probably would have been
approved if it had been presented
in a better manner.
Transfer students say they are
likewise "optimistic" that the pro
posal will be approved, and are
willing to do anything they can to
convince senate members to let
them out of a "very frustrating"
requirement.
Senior Tony Sabadini, who
transferred from Colby College in
Maine, said he views the commis
sion's recommendation as a "sign
that the University is at least
being a little more understanding
of our situation as transfers."
Sabadini's personal experience
with CIV was "very frustrating,"
he added.
"I went in first quarter and I'd
already read most of the books and
I already knew how to write a
paper," he said.
Sabadini said he also found it
"frustrating" that transfer stu
dents were limited when choosing
which CIV track they wanted to
take.
"My year we were told to plan
on not getting into our first
choice," he said. "We were told
we'd fill in the empty spots in the

tracks."
If transfers are required to take
CIV, then they should have the
same opportunity as freshmen to
pick which track they want to
take, he added.
Goodrich, who transferred from
Holy Cross College in Mas
sachusetts, said that most transfer
students are at a level "way
above" the average freshman.
She added that she has heard
"horror stories" about transfers
who "have to stay an extra year
just to take CIV" or "who can't do
honors work because of CIV."
CIV equals one quarter's
tuition approximately $6,200 —
and it is "financially unfair" to
make transfer students stay on an
extra year or be unable to do hon
ors work because of the CIV
requirement, Goodrich said.
Sabadini and Goodrich agreed
that the commission's recommen
dation is a much better way for
transfers to fulfill the CIV require
ment.
Goodrich said the new recom
mendation will allow transfer stu
dents much more flexibility in
choosing classes. The "appropriate"
courses could be chosen to fit into a
transfer student's major, she said.
Just two years after the Faculty
Senate rejected a similar proposal, the
Commission on Undergraduate Edu
cation has recommended that transfer
students be able to substitute three
"appropriate" courses for the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values requirement.
Such courses could include upper
level classes that cover material similar
to CIV tracks, said junior Laura

Goodrich, a transfer student who
served on the commission's subcom
mittee on breadth requirements.
History Prof. James Sheehan, the
commission's chair, said that "looking
at the CIV requirement from the trans
fer students' point of view" convinced
the commission to re-introduce the
proposal.
The commission found that CIV is a
"uniquely freshman course" that is
"not clearly applicable to transfer stu
dents," he addtxl.

Furthermore, the CIV requirement
significantly limits a transfer student's
ability to choose courses, Sheehan said.
A three-quarter sequence of CIV
amounts to 15 units, which for juniors
— who normally have to take 90 units
here to complete a degree — equals
one-sixth of their Stanford course
work.
"That's a big chunk," Sheehan said.
"It doesn't make sense, nor does it
seem fair, to load transfer students
down with courses."

The commission's rationale for the
proposal differs significantly from the
reasoning behind the original proposal
considered by the senate in May 1992,
Sheehan said.
That proposal was presented largely
on "budgetary grounds," said Shee
han, who voted against it.
According to the original proposal,
the University could cut back the num
ber of lecturers needed for CIV by
about one lecturer and a half by no
longer requiring transfer stu
dents to take the course.
Of the approximately 150
transfer students this year, about
110 are presently enrolled in CIV,
said Margaret Harris, the pro
gram's coordinator. The other
transfer students fulfilled the CIV
requirement by taking a compara
ble course at another school.
However, many faculty mem
bers involved in the senate debate
"didn't buy" the financial savings
argument, said Classics Prof.
Marsh McCall, a member of the
senate at the time.
Sheehan said although the com
mission's proposal will save some
money, budgetary concerns are
not the main purpose of the new
recommendation. Rather, the rec
ommendation is designed to be
more effective in meeting the
needs of transfer students.
The original proposal also
argued that transfer students
"didn't fit into CIV," but that
assertion did not match many fac
ulty members' experiences. Shee

han said.
