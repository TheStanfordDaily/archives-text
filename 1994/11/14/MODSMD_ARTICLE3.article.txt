# CUE recommends no CIV for transfers
## Students will be able to choose three appropriate courses as alternatives 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Just two years after the Faculty
Senate rejected a similar proposal, the
Commission on Undergraduate Edu
cation has recommended that transfer
students be able to substitute three
"appropriate" courses for the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values requirement.
Such courses could include upper
level classes that cover material similar
to CIV tracks, said junior Laura

Goodrich, a transfer student who
served on the commission's subcom
mittee on breadth requirements.
History Prof. James Sheehan, the
commission's chair, said that "looking
at the CIV requirement from the trans
fer students' point of view" convinced
the commission to re-introduce the
proposal.
The commission found that CIV is a
"uniquely freshman course" that is
"not clearly applicable to transfer stu
dents," he addtxl.

Furthermore, the CIV requirement
significantly limits a transfer student's
ability to choose courses, Sheehan said.
A three-quarter sequence of CIV
amounts to 15 units, which for juniors
— who normally have to take 90 units
here to complete a degree — equals
one-sixth of their Stanford course
work.
"That's a big chunk," Sheehan said.
"It doesn't make sense, nor does it
seem fair, to load transfer students
down with courses."

The commission's rationale for the
proposal differs significantly from the
reasoning behind the original proposal
considered by the senate in May 1992,
Sheehan said.
That proposal was presented largely
on "budgetary grounds," said Shee
han, who voted against it.
According to the original proposal,
the University could cut back the num
ber of lecturers needed for CIV by
about one lecturer and a half by no
