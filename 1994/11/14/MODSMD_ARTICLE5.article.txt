# STV successful in grad residences, not undergrad

Do you want your STV? If you are an
undergraduate, you may not get it.
In undergraduate residences, the
fate of Stanford Television — the Uni
versity's experimental cable television
for student residences — will probably
be decided soon after the quarter's end,
according to Maureen Trimm, assis
tant director of Communication Ser
vices.
The pilot cable television program
was initiated to provide students with
better quality television, including
more channels like ESPN and MTV.
Tho eprvirp nromiprpd fnr under

graduates in Florence Moore Hall and
for graduate students in McFarland
and Escondido Village buildings 88 and
116 earlier this quarter. Specific dorms
were selected to gauge how well the
program would be accepted by students
before expanding the service to all resi
dences.
Graduate students have subscribed
in large numbers, but residents in Flo
Mo have responded less enthusiastical
ly, Trimm said. There has been a
steady trickle of new undergraduate
subscribers during the quarter, per
haps one or two a week, she added.
Consequently, graduate residences
will definitely be wired for cable, but

undergraduates may not be provided
with the service because it will not be
worth the time or expense to install the
connections, she said.
The lack of undergraduate response
can be largely attributed to a "cultural
difference," Trimm said.
Many undergraduates don't bring
televisions to school with them and
they watch television in the lounges,
Trimm said. Graduates live in apart
ments and many have televisions, she
said.
"We don't have a TV. We don't pay
attention to it. People keep coming by
and hooking things up," said sopho
more Erin Tebbetts. a Flo Mo resident.

But Trimm added that providing
cable might encourage more people to
bring televisions. "People don't bring
TVs to school if cable service is not
available," she said.
Many undergraduate residents who
have subscribed seem pleased with the
service. "I have a positive impression so
far. I like the channel selection —
CNN, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central,"
said junior Rob Swierk, another Flo Mo
resident.
He added he thought a two-week
delay in hook-ups during October had
"turned some people off."
Swierk added that, although
people in the dorm had wanted to
subscribe to the service in the
lounge, Communication Services
"gave us a run-around."
"People didn't subscribe
because they thought they would
have it in the lounge," he
explained.
In December, Communication
Services will distribute a survey
to Flo Mo residents asking for
their reactions to STV, including
why they did or didn't subscribe.
The results could determine
whether undergraduates will
receive the cable service.
"We are committed to EV and

Rains but the undergraduate res
idences are still uncertain,"
Trimm said.
Another reason graduates are
guaranteed the service is that
connecting Escondido is less
expensive.
The graduate residences are
currently being completely
rewired for telephone and com
puter connections, making it rela
tively easy to include cable hook
ups, Trimm said.
Communication Services
wants to decide whether or not to
provide undergraduates with STV
by the end of the quarter to stay
on schedule. The University had
planned to have all cable hook
ups installed by next fall.
"This will take a tremendous
amount of equipment and time,"
Trimm said.
