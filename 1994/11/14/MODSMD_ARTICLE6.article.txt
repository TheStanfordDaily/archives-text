# Stanford grad orbits on the shuttle Endeavor

"Up, up, up!" cried 2-year
old Shannon when her father,
Steve Smith — the sixth Stan
ford graduate to go into space —
blasted into orbit for the first
time on Sept. 30.
With him aboard the space
shuttle Endeavor went Stan
ford grad Jeff Wisoff on his sec
ond trip to space, along with a
Stanford pennant, water polo
hat and School of Engineering
banner.
"That was my way of thank
ing Stanford," said Smith, who
graduated in 1981 and received
a master's degree in electrical
engineering in 1982 and anoth
er in business in 1987.
"The key to my [success] was
Stanford. I owe a lot to it — my
education, friends, athletic ex
perience. .said Smith, who
was captain of the water polo
team. "And I met my wife

there."
Smith said his experience in
space was unforgettable. The
8.5 minute ascent into the 11-
day flight was "exciting," he
said. With a 6.5 million pound
thrust, the vibration was "in
credible."
Once in space, "it was a blast,
a really magical experience,"
Smith said. "You're trained to
expect zero-g, but until you've
been there, it's hard to imagine
what it feels like to pick up 100
pounds and have it float in front
of you face."
Part of the challenge in space
was learning to think of the ceil
ing and walls as floors. Another
difficulty was adapting to the
sixteen-hour days. Once, Smith
was e-mailing his wife when he
fell asleep. When he woke up, he
had floated upside down into
the kitchen.
