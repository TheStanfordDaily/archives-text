# Stanford grad orbits on the shuttle Endeavor

"Up, up, up!" cried 2-year
old Shannon when her father,
Steve Smith — the sixth Stan
ford graduate to go into space —
blasted into orbit for the first
time on Sept. 30.
With him aboard the space
shuttle Endeavor went Stan
ford grad Jeff Wisoff on his sec
ond trip to space, along with a
Stanford pennant, water polo
hat and School of Engineering
banner.
"That was my way of thank
ing Stanford," said Smith, who
graduated in 1981 and received
a master's degree in electrical
engineering in 1982 and anoth
er in business in 1987.
"The key to my [success] was
Stanford. I owe a lot to it — my
education, friends, athletic ex
perience. .said Smith, who
was captain of the water polo
team. "And I met my wife

there."
Smith said his experience in
space was unforgettable. The
8.5 minute ascent into the 11-
day flight was "exciting," he
said. With a 6.5 million pound
thrust, the vibration was "in
credible."
Once in space, "it was a blast,
a really magical experience,"
Smith said. "You're trained to
expect zero-g, but until you've
been there, it's hard to imagine
what it feels like to pick up 100
pounds and have it float in front
of you face."
Part of the challenge in space
was learning to think of the ceil
ing and walls as floors. Another
difficulty was adapting to the
sixteen-hour days. Once, Smith
was e-mailing his wife when he
fell asleep. When he woke up, he
had floated upside down into
the kitchen.

Zero-g has no effect on alum Steve Smith, who proudly displays the banner of his alma
mater on the space shuttle Endeavor.
Looking back at the earth from
orbit, Smith said he could not
believe how beautiful it was.
"No matter what religion you
ascribe to, you can't help but won
der who put [the earthl there," he
said. "It's an island in absolute
blackness, a vacuum and we have
to protect it."
Smith said he has always been
fascinated with aviation and being
a pilot. His grade-school drawings,
which his mother collected, consist
largely of rockets.
"And I watched Apollo — it was
almost natural to be interested in
space."
So Smith set out to fulfill that
goal.
"Everything I did was designed
to prepare my self to be an astro
naut." Flying in college with the
Stanford Flying Club, working with
IHM for seven years, going to busi
ness school to learn to work with
people and working for NASA as a
flight controller — it was all to
develop what Smith called a "skill
set," which would pay off in the

end.
Smith fdled out the 13-page
application to the space academy
five times before NASA selected
him. He was chosen from the 2,000
to 3,000 applicant pool as a finalist
to be interviewed and medically
tested.
At the interview, NASA asked
Smith his strengths and weakness
es, his work and accomplishments,
why he wanted to become an astro
naut, why the space program was
important to the United States and
about his hobbies and heroes.
Smith said he admires Charles
Lindberg and Jacques Cousteau,
both explorers like himself, in addi
tion to Willy Mayes. In fact, the
Lindberg family gave Smith Lind
berg's reading glasses to take on
the flight, and Smith invited
Cousteau to the shuttle launch.
Cousteau could not make it, but he
sent a letter and a hat.
Smith was selected and joined
the 14th astronaut class in August
1992. After one year of training
evaluation, he was eligible for
flight, and is now a career astro
naut at the Johnson Space Center
in Houston.
In the future, he said he hopes to
help build an international space

station. "I'd like to make the ulti
mate camping trip, to another plan
et."
But for now, Smith spends 70
percent of his time training for
flight When he and other astro
nauts do not train, they are
assigned responsibilities around
the space station. Smith deals with
main engines, vehicles and loading
and unloading astronauts for flight.
During the flight, his duties
included shuttle mechanics, com
munications, payload bay doors
and in-flight maintenance.
"I was basically a Mr. Fix-it,"
Smith said. He also oversaw most
of the secondary payload experi
ments.
This shuttle took a space radar
lab with it in order to take radar
images of the earth's environment
for policy makers. The secondary
payloads included the crystals of an
anti-cancer drug and 1993 gradu
ate Teddy Johnson's soed-germina
tion project.
Smith emphasized the thou
sands of scientific advancements in
medical technology and communi
cations from space exploration. For
example, suits used by multiple
sclerosis patients were developed
from spacewalk suits with water

tubed underwear to control body
temperature.
On this particular flight, the
astronauts discovered that gypsy
moths, which are highly destruc
tive, are sterile when bom in space.
Now, scientists can try to mimic
that environment on earth and
hopefully breed sterile gypsy
moths.
"All these things were not
intended, but they happened,"
Smith said, adding that he chose to
be an astronaut for this very reason
— not only is it "fun and satisfying,
but it makes lives better."
While many have the impression
that the United States spends a lot
of money on the space, Smith
pointed out that $14 billion is actu
ally less than 1 percent of the bud
get, adding that the return is seven
to nine times that of the invest
ment.
Americans spend five times that
amount on pizza and eight times
that on cosmetics every year, he
said. "Spending one penny every
dollar on the future is nothing."
True, the risks of being an astro
naut are high, but he, his wife and
his parents can live with the "life
giving decision" because of the
potential pay-back.
