For the second year in a row, a survey bv the Asso
ciation of University Technology Managers has listed
Stanford as having the second highest income from
invention royalties.
The survey listed Stanford's income for fiscal year
1993 as more than $32 million in royalties. The Uni
versity's total was exceeded only by the $45.4 million
garnered by the nine schools of the University of Cal
ifornia system.
According to Kathy Ku, director of the Office of
Technology Licensing, Stanford's total jumped sig
nificantly from last year's amount of $25.5 million,
and is expected to rise to more than $38 million for fis
cal year 1994.
"We consider ourselves an entrepreneurial office,'"
Ku explained, adding that "Silicon Valley is an entre
preneurial region."
Stanford's increase in income, however, reflects a
national trend among research institutions.
According to Jon Sandelin, a senior associate with
the Office of Technology Licensing, revenue generat
ed by inventions rose an estimated $100 million dur
ing fiscal years 1991 through 1993.
One reason Sandelin gave for this increase is en
couragement by the federal government.
"A good part of it is the government's focus on
technology transfer as a legitimate activity for uni
versities," Sandelin said.
Sandelin also explained that many large private
corporations have begun to turn to technology devel
oped outside their facilities.
"U.S. industry has become much more receptive to
such licensing," he said. On the other hand, Sandelin
added that "universities are looking carefully for out
side income."
Ku said much of Stanford's 1993 royalty income
comes from a single patent — shared by Stanford and
the University of California — for technology related
to recombinant DNA.
