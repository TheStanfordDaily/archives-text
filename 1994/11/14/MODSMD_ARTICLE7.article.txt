# Ranked 2nd in royalties
## 
### Ben Sussman Contributing writer 
For the second year in a row, a survey bv the Asso
ciation of University Technology Managers has listed
Stanford as having the second highest income from
invention royalties.
The survey listed Stanford's income for fiscal year
1993 as more than $32 million in royalties. The Uni
versity's total was exceeded only by the $45.4 million
garnered by the nine schools of the University of Cal
ifornia system.
According to Kathy Ku, director of the Office of
Technology Licensing, Stanford's total jumped sig
nificantly from last year's amount of $25.5 million,
and is expected to rise to more than $38 million for fis
cal year 1994.
"We consider ourselves an entrepreneurial office,'"
Ku explained, adding that "Silicon Valley is an entre
preneurial region."
Stanford's increase in income, however, reflects a
national trend among research institutions.
According to Jon Sandelin, a senior associate with
the Office of Technology Licensing, revenue generat
ed by inventions rose an estimated $100 million dur
ing fiscal years 1991 through 1993.
One reason Sandelin gave for this increase is en
couragement by the federal government.
"A good part of it is the government's focus on
technology transfer as a legitimate activity for uni
versities," Sandelin said.
Sandelin also explained that many large private
corporations have begun to turn to technology devel
oped outside their facilities.
"U.S. industry has become much more receptive to
such licensing," he said. On the other hand, Sandelin
added that "universities are looking carefully for out
side income."
Ku said much of Stanford's 1993 royalty income
comes from a single patent — shared by Stanford and
the University of California — for technology related
to recombinant DNA.
For fiscal year 1994, Ku esti
mated that the recombinant DNA
project will earn more than $23
million for the University.
"The largest portion [of Stan
ford's invention royalty income]
has been the DNA case," she said.
By the time that patent expires in
1997, it is expected to earn nearly
$170 million in royalties.
As with other universities
across the country, Stanford's
inventors have an incentive to
create new technology. The Uni

versity's revenue-sharing policy
gives one-third of the invention's
royalties to the inventor, another
third to the inventor's depart
ment, and the remaining third to
the University, Ku said.
The conflict of interest policy
passed last year by the Faculty
Senate sets out explicit rules gov
erning patent rights and the dis
tribution of royalties for faculty
inventions.
In all, the report credits Stan
ford inventors with patents for 39
new inventions, giving the Univer
sity a total of 214 royalty-generat
ing licenses. The report was pub
lished in the Nov. 9 edition of the
Chronicle of Higher Education.
