Stanford operators will no longer have to deal with
students' incessant calls for phone numbers — the
Stanford Directory arrives on campus today.
Most Stanford students will recognize the basic for
mat of the phone book, but some changes have been
made, said 1994-95 Project Director Paul Yee.
"These changes were made to devise an easier way
to find things," Yee said.
Besides the new full-color maps with local street in
dexes and a comprehensive advertising guide, the Di
rectory also contains new mini tables of contents
throughout its pages and a reorganized information
guide.
Yee said he was also excited about the Directory's
cover page on which color-coded headings — which
correspond to the page colors of each section — are laid
over a photo of the Dish.
"Structure comes from function," he said. This, he
added, was the main reason the changes were made.
Most undergraduates will receive copies of the
phone book in their residences today, and graduate
students and faculty can pick up copies in their de
partments.
Those undergrads who live in Escondido Village can
pick up phone books after this Tuesday at the E.V. of
fice, and those who live off campus will receive a card
in the mail which they can exchange for a directory at
the ASSU Office in Tresidder.
The 12-person staff began work in earnest on the
nine-month project in June, Yee said, with most of the
staff staying around campus during the summer.
"The Directory has an extremely dedicated and
hard-working staff who sacrificed a lot to reach the
deadline," said the Directory's Financial Manager
Steve Russell.
This year has been extremely successful for the Di
rectory, Yee said, with advertisement sales topping
last year's by $30,000. In total, the Directory earned
$330,000 in advertisement sales.
