John Keegan
A History of Warfare
(Vintage Books, $14.00)
Analyzing centuries of conflict -
in societies from the Amazon to the
Balkans, waged by nomadic horsemen,
peasant guerrillas, and superbly disci
plined regiments - Keegan unveils the
deepest motives behind humanity's
penchant
for mass bloodshed. This immensely grip
ping book is a masterpiece of military
scholarship, irresistible in its style and ter
rifying in its implications.
"Absorbing ... F\Â»egan furnishes his
readers with multiple intellectual dimen
sions, and makes it possible for us to learn
from a variety of alternative military cul
tures. He writes persuasively." -The New
York Times
