Linda Gray Sexton
Searching for Mercy Street:
My Jounrney Back to My Mother,
Anne Sexton
(Little, Brown; $22.95)
Linda Gray Sexton's mother, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Anne Sexton,
suffered from chronic mental illness and committed suicide on October
4, 1974. Searching for Mercy Street is the product of an arduous emotional
and intellectual journey of two decades
during which Linda tried to heal herself by
remembering the joy as well as the pain.
"Linda Sexton's memoir is a tour de
force, shot through with passion, candor,
and the urgency of a grown daughter
forced to come to terms with her famous
mother's legacy. Anne Sexton would have
applauded her daughter's honesty, insight,
and the sheer power of her prose." -
Elizabeth Benedict, author of Safe Conduct
This event will be held at the bookstore on campus.
