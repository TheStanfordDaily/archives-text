## Flooding leaves many homeless; at least 100 dead

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
â€” Heavy rains and flooding from
Tropical Storm Gordon swept
across Haiti yesterday, killing at
least 100 people, triggering land
slides and washing away makeshift
homes in the slums of the capital.
Terrified people fled their
homes in the early morning dark
ness as floodwaters poured in.
Some spent the night huddled on
their rooftops in the downpour.
By the time the skies cleared,
thousands of people were left
homeless.
"I didn't save anything, only
myself," said Lekeas Dorvilier, 35,
who jumped out the window of his
two-room home minutes before it

crumbled into a ravine.
Bodies lay in the sun in some
neighborhoods. Many of the vic
tims lived in flimsy tin shacks on
hillsides. Rescue workers said they
expected the death toll to climb.
President Jean-Bertrand Aris
tide flew over his battered nation in
a U.S. military helicopter to survey
damage from the 1994 Atlantic
hurricane season's deadliest storm.
"Obviously we will do what we
can to help the Haitian govern
ment," said Col. Barry Willey, a
U.S. military spokesman.
Thousands of U.S. soldiers
arrived in the Caribbean nation in
September to help restore Aris
tide's elected government. Aris

tide, who was ousted in a 1991
coup, returned Oct. 15.
Two deaths also were reported
in Jamaica, where the storm caused
widespread flooding and mudslides.
At least two people were killed in
Cuba and 65,000 were evacuated,
Cuba's official Prensa Latina news
agency reported.
The storm killed at least 40 peo
ple in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian
Press Agency said. Radio
Metropole said 40 people were
killed in the southeastern port
Jacmel, and dozens more were
missing. And radio station Signal
FM said 20 people were killed in
Leogane, about 40 miles west of
Port-au-Prince.
