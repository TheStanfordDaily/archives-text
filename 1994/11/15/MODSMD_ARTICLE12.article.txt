## Healing EV's wounds 
### 
AFTER YEARS OF accusations
that they were turning a blind
eye to squalid, unsafe condi
tions in Escondido Village, Housing
and Dining Services officials have
finally acknowledged that there are
severe maintenance problems in the
residence complex.
With help from Escondido resi
dents, the University is taking steps
to ensure that maintenance prob
lems are adequately addressed. Plans
include annual inspections of all
apartments and a new "SWAT team"
system to repair problems like leaky
faucets.
University officials deserve credit
for taking these positive steps toward
rebuilding its often rocky relation
ship with Escondido guests. But it is
clear that much more work lies
ahead before the University can truly
close the book on its past conflicts
with graduate-housing residents.
Serious systemic problems persist in
the graduate-housing system.
One issue that needs to be
resolved is the dispute over the rental
prices students pay for graduate

housing. University officials hold
that graduate residences charge sub
stantially lower rent than can be
found in neighboring communities.
But some residents point out that
they pay much higher rent than stu
dents at other schools, such as UC-
Berkeley. They also point out that
students in older, often shabby apart
ments pay the same rent as students
in the newer, renovated apartments.
While the solution may not lie in
instantly lowering every resident's
rent, the University clearly can and
should do more to resolve these issues
than simply shrug its shoulders.
It is crucial that the University
work with residents to solve rent
questions, especially in relation to
graduate students who often must be
financially self-sufficient and, in
many cases, must also support fami
lies.
By comprehensively following up
on its work in Escondido, the Uni
versity can prove once again that uni
versally agreeable solutions can be
reached through civilized dialogue
and a little effort.
