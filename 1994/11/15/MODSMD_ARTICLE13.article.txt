# Time isn't on their side

WITH EVEN LESS time
on the Farm than the
average undergraduate,
Stanford's transfer students
deserve flexibility when it comes
to choosing courses.
For this reason, the Commission
on Undergraduate Education's
recommendation that transfer stu
dents be exempt from the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values require
ment is a welcome proposal.
Whereas CIV serves a dual
purpose for freshmen — as an
introduction to the study of cul
ture and, more generally, as an
introduction to Stanford's aca
demic environment — this pur
pose is not nearly as relevant to
transfer students.
Transfer students arrive at
Stanford with at least one year

of college-level courses behind
them. For the most part, this
past experience means that they
have already acclimatized them
selves to academic life at the col
lege level.
As a result, transfer students
could make better use of their
limited time if they were simply
allowed to pursue distribution
requirements and courses in
their chosen field of study.
History Prof, and CUE Chair
man James Sheehan recognized
this fact when he recently
remarked that CIV is a "unique
ly freshman course." Sheehan's
statement is correct, and the
Faculty Senate's Committee on
Undergraduate Studies should
take notice when it comes time
to vote on the issue.
