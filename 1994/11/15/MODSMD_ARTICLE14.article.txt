Casper's response to The Review's 6 Chief 9 inadequate

A NUMBER OF letters to The Daily
have focused on the Review's
"Chief as a symbol stereotyping
and debasing the indigenous peoples of
this continent. But if one looks beyond
the superficial representation, an under
lying theme of hatred, bigotry and igno
rance surfaces — and this generalizes to
all people of color.
The caricature symbolizes everything
negative we (people of color) have been
told about ourselves. It again tells us
that we are either from an inferior stock
dependent on mainstream America or
from a passive make-up willing to

endure injustice. Even the caricature's
terse commentaries are stereotypical of
our speech as limited to uncomplicated
thought.
President Casper's belated attempt at
opposing the caricature through written
and oral statements is disgusting. He
asserts that he is powerless against The
Review for two reasons. First, he must
obey the Grey Interpretation, which
licenses the caricature as a symbol com
plying with "respect for order, morality,
personal honor and the rights of others
as is demanded of good citizens."
Casper's second excuse is his concern

for protecting Stanford's supposed mea
ger funds, which would be vulnerable to
a lawsuit from The Review.
In other words, Casper has justified
his inaction through supposed fiduciary
responsibility and concern for the law.
But in reality, he has made a choice to
favor money over the protection of peo
ple. Casper's licensing of the caricature
has now created a dangerous climate for
the University, whether he likes it or
not.
Clearly, the use of the caricature is
morally wrong. One doesn't need
Grey to interpret that. What the Uni

versity needs is a president with
enough moral fortitude to do what is
right. As long as the caricature is
allowed, Casper remains a partner in
the proliferation of racism at Stan
ford. The continued use and dissemi
nation of the caricature can only have
a multiplying effect. Casper's inaction
has licensed future racist actions in
the guise of morally excusable opin
ions. And as many of us know, excus
es for racism will eventually lead to
violence.
