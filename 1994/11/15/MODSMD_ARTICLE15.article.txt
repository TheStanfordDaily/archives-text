# Review's use of Indian is antithetical to their ideological principles
## 
### 
On Oct. 3, the principles of The Stan
ford Review were stated in an article titled
"The New Campus Radicals." I would
specifically like to call attention to Princi
ple 2, second paragraph, which states,
"We are committed though free and ratio
nal discourse, to ending venomous and
unenlightened stereotypes of race, ethnici
ty and gender. The enforcement of a
'politically correct' position through regu
latory speech codes, however, is antitheti
cal to the free marketplace of ideas and is
ultimately counter-productive."
Is not the caricature of the Indian
in The Review's weekly column enti
tled "Smoke Signals" clearly a ven
omous and unenlightened stereotype
of race and ethnicity? To call this pic
ture an effort at ending "venomous
and unenlightened stereotypes" is
nothing short of a lie. In no feasible
way does it "honor" the American
Indian, as Review Editor in Chief
Aman Verjee stated in the Nov. 1 arti
cle covering the issue of the caricature.

Rather, it belittles us by stereotypical
ly portraying the angry Indian with
eyes bulging and tomahawk in hand. If
the American Indian Newsletter "The
Coming Voice" started a column enti
tled "Honky Happenings," which pic
tured a caricature of a fat, beer-drink
ing, football watching white man, and
in which we spoke about the Review's
happenings, would not that immedi
ately cause an uproar?
The Review argues that it is counter
productive in a free marketplace of
ideas to enforce a "politically correct"
position in regulatory speech codes, but
I must ask what kind of productive dis
cussion a blatantly racist stereotype can
produce. None! All that is produced is
confrontation, anger and name calling,
each of which is incompatible with
rational discourse. If you start with
name calling, then you will be limited to
name calling, leaving no issues
resolved.
Let's not revive this old debate over
the Indian mascot. Clearly there is no
detrimental effect by simply changing the
column's racist theme. Is it necessary to
belittle an entire race "as a fun way to
spice up a section?" I think not!
