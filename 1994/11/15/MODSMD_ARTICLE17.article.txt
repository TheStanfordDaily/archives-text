## The 						ostrich generation 
### 
IN CUBBYHOLES THROUGHOUT
our campus, obscure research is pro
ceeding daily. Dark corners house pro
jects concerned with stress endocrinology
in baboons, the effects of hypnosis on
breast cancer patients and almost any
thing else you can imagine. I wonder if
anyone would support a study of the rela
tionship between students and ostriches.
Here's why I think such a study mer
its attention. Ostriches are known to
stick their heads in holes, severing com
munication with the outside world.
Recently, I've seen students doing the
same thing, though a little more subtly
(most campus inhabitants remain pru
dent enough to avoid getting their necks
stuck in crevices).
On the surface, things seem well
enough, with classes full of smiling youth
and paths teeming with colliding cyclists.
Simultaneously, our understanding of
the "way things work" is constantly
improving. Communication and travel
have become phenomenally convenient,
and technology has drastically narrowed
gaps between individuals worldwide.
As a whole, the world has become a lot
smaller. An enhanced communion with
the world around us should follow. But as
individuals, we seem to be tunneling
inward, away from the sphere that is
shrinking to embrace us. Here are the
symptoms:
1. The Virtual Reality Craze
Somehow, many have begun to find it
more attractive to deal with simulated

reality than reality itself. Hence the rise
of automated voices at the other end of
phone calls, the spread of the TV culture
and video games throughout residences
and the cult of e-mail. Such examples of
"progress" ironically distance us from
true contact with others while they pro
fess to bring us closer together. We
demand "call waiting" so that the flow of
our conversation can continually be frag
mented until we've got four people
engaged simultaneously.
The obsession with operating "on
line" increasingly severs contact among
individuals. I was shocked to fmd a friend
watching his engineering lecture from
his apartment sofa recently. What does
such isolation do to the human spirit?
The technology is not inherently damag
ing. Yet it has contributed to the distance
between members of our community
have not supplemented it suf
ficiently with genuine human connec
tion. We're just leaving more messages
on machines.
2. A Lack of Trust
The rise in technical supplements to
human interaction erodes our faith in the
world around us. The media connects us
with distant events, yet depicts a dire
world of murder and tragedy. Fear fur
ther isolates us, so that rather than seek
ing deeper connections amongst our
peers, we become more cynical. We no
longer need to actively seek information;
it is fed to us via "the network." Similar
ly, our only connection with the political

process is through the media, which
alienates us by its divisive sensational
ism. In spite of live election coverage,
Washington — the supposed nucleus of
connection to our fellow citizens — seems
farther and farther away. Student
activism has clearly suffered. Heads back
in our holes.
3. The "Whatever" Attitude
The final stage of self-absorption. In
our protective shells, the outside world
can often be forgotten. As we are support
ed by technology, committed relation
ships to people matter less. It's all right to
"blow something off," because the person
"blown off" no longer means as much. We
spend less time in casual conversation
and more time in front of a computer."
Commitment to friendships is demeaned
as we inhale simulated interactions. Then
we permanently attach Walkman head
phones to our ears, hoping to be nour
ished. We declare ourselves "non-judg
mental," so that whatever other people do
is okay. Our opinions, passions and other
connections to the outside world? "What
ever," is what I hear.
Am I too harsh? Exceptions abound.
Am I just cynical? Maybe. Yet I feel a gap
between us, and I'm concerned.
