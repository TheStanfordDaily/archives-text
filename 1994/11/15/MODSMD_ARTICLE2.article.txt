Nine African-American columnists
gathered on campus last night to debate
Mike Tyson, O.J. Simpson and current is
sues facing black people in the United
States.
The members of the Trotter Group —
an association of black journalists — dis
cussed Haiti and last Tuesday's elections,
among other topics, at the forum at Cub

berly Auditorium which drew a mixed
crowd of about 100.
Moderator Charles Ogletree, a law pro
fessor at Harvard University and member
of Stanford's Board of Trustees, asked the
panel if the black celebrities in the news for
scandals were victims of a conspiracy
against African Americans.
Sherman Miller, a columnist wit{?, the
Wilmington News Journal in Delaware,
said people who commit crimes cannot be
excused on the basis of a "conspiracy."

"We say if a person did something
wrong, we're supposed to cover it up," he
said. "These people are icons for my chil
dren. If they're allowed to get away with
things then my children are allowed to get
away with things."
But DeWayne Wickham of USA Today
said conspiracies do exist against black
Americans. He called charges of sexual
abuse against singer Michael Jackson a
"blatant conspiracy."
Mike Tyson was a victim of
growing up as an underprivileged
African American, said Peggy
Peterman of the St. Petersburg
Times. "He was made into what
he was," she said. "I think as jour
nalists we need to get down to that
bottom line. Here we are again
with a black man getting used by
the system."
Once black people reach a level
of success, though, they are treated
differently, argued Derrick Jack
son of the Boston Globe. "I don't
see the same concern issue for all
the black men on death row," he
said. Simpson has received special
treatment because he is "someone
who did his best to make white peo
ple comfortable with him," he said.

"O.J. Simpson, for all practical
purposes, was seen as a white boy,"
agreed Vernon Jarrett, a retired
columnist.
"African Americans are under a
constant pressure to conform to a
white persona," Jackson said. "But
white people do not put this pres
sure on themselves." While black
people are expected to be polite and
upstanding, he said, white heroes
today include characters such as
Beavis and Butt-head.
But while African Americans
may feel confined by white stan
dards, "I also think there's a box
put around black people by black
people," said Sheryl McCarthy of
New York Newsday.
Haiti provides another example
of a white society benefiting while
blacks suffer, Peterman said. "We
kept worrying about going into
Haiti, but we've been there for gen
erations," she said. "We continue

to sue Third World countries and
black people for our benefit. Black
people need to know that these peo
ple are part of us."
The most recent elections,
which gave a majority in the U.S.
House of Representatives and Sen
ate to Republicans, may help give
African Americans a sense of com
munity, Peterman said.
"I believe we're going to have to
talk to each other as a communi
ty," she said. "It's time for African
Americans to talk to each other."
Because Republicans are not
going to look out for the interests
of the black community, Jarrett
added, "It's time not only to start
building coalitions with white peo
ple but to start building coalitions
with us."
Brenda Payton of the Oakland
Tribune, Les Payne of Newsday and
Lorraine Montre of the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch also participated.
