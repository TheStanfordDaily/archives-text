Nine African-American columnists
gathered on campus last night to debate
Mike Tyson, O.J. Simpson and current is
sues facing black people in the United
States.
The members of the Trotter Group —
an association of black journalists — dis
cussed Haiti and last Tuesday's elections,
among other topics, at the forum at Cub

berly Auditorium which drew a mixed
crowd of about 100.
Moderator Charles Ogletree, a law pro
fessor at Harvard University and member
of Stanford's Board of Trustees, asked the
panel if the black celebrities in the news for
scandals were victims of a conspiracy
against African Americans.
Sherman Miller, a columnist wit{?, the
Wilmington News Journal in Delaware,
said people who commit crimes cannot be
excused on the basis of a "conspiracy."

"We say if a person did something
wrong, we're supposed to cover it up," he
said. "These people are icons for my chil
dren. If they're allowed to get away with
things then my children are allowed to get
away with things."
But DeWayne Wickham of USA Today
said conspiracies do exist against black
Americans. He called charges of sexual
abuse against singer Michael Jackson a
"blatant conspiracy."
