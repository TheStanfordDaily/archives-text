### Emery Chen Staff writer 
While the result may not have been the win it
was hoping for, the Stanford women's golf team
came back from South Carolina last weekend with
its national-title hopes intact.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal, which competed in
the Golf World/Palmetto Dunes Collegiate at
Hilton Mead, S.C., finished a strong third in a field
consisting of some of the best teams in women's
golf. Eight of the top 10 schools in the nation took
part in the annual tournament held on the Arthur
Hills Course.
Stanford compiled a total of 906 strokes, eight
behind champion No. 8 Tulsa and two behind sec
ond-place No. 2 San Jose State.
"I feel good about our performance in the tour
nament," said coach Tim Baldwin. "Tulsa played
about as well as they could possibly play. [In addi
tion], San Jose State just really primed for the tour
nament. If we finished a little stronger we could
have beat them."
The Cardinal finished the first round Eriday
with a total of 310, which placed Stanford fourth in
the standings. Saturday ended with the Cardinal in
second, two strokes behind the Spartans. Stanford
shot a combined 294 for the low round of the day.
The Cardinal fired a 302 in the final round.
Tulsa came from third three strokes behind, shoot
ing a 293 to win. San Jose State also shot a 302 in
the final round.
"Throughout the tournament we had extremely
strong performances from the whole team," Bald
win said. "Mhairi McKay had three good rounds,
shooting a 77 in terrible weather the first day, a 72
in bad weather the second day and a two-under-par
-70 the final day."
McKay, a first team All-American last year as a
freshman, finished the individual competition tied
for third, four strokes behind Stephanie Neill of
Wake Forest. Junior Vicky Strada ended up alone
in 12th place after firing rounds of 77, 71 and 80.
Senior Jamille Jose tied for 16th, two strokes
behind Strada. Jose also posted a 77 in the first
round and completed the tournament with a 74 and
a 79. Sophomore preseason All-American Andrea
Baxter's first two rounds of 83 and 80 proved dis
appointing but she came back strong with a 73 to
put h»F i«-arctic for -36th with teammate Amy

ford's turbulent seasbn.
Lawrence. Lawrence, a senior, shot
rounds of 79, 77 and 80.
The tournament was the final
one of the fall season for the Cardi
nal. The team resumes action with
two during winter,
the first Occurring February in Ari
zona. Stanford will also host its own
tournament March 3-5 on the Stan
ford Golf Course.
"We, the whole team, feel really

good about our accomplishments
this fall," Baldwin said. "We've
beaten some great teams. It's our
best start ever. We've had two wins,
a second and a third.
"Individually, we've had some
great play," he added. McKay regis
tered a win and three top-five fin
ishes, Baxter a win and three top-10
finishes, Jose three top-10 finishes,
Strada two top-10 finishes and
Lawrence two top-10 finishes.
Stanford's record currently
stands at 51-3. The three loses
came at the hands of top-10 teams
— No.l-ranked Arizona State,

No.B-ranked Tulsa and N0.2-
ranked San Jose State.
"We're a real part of the big four
— Arizona State, Tulsa, San Jose
State and Stanford," Baldwin said.
"It seems that the other teams,
UCLA, Texas, Wake Forest and
others, are a notch below us."
The four-tournament run has
taken a toll on the team. The Cardi
nal has traveled to Oregon, Wash
ington, Monterey and South Caroli
na so far this season.

a rest," Baldwin said. "We've asked
them to do a lot in a short time."
