# Dry those tears
## Gridiron goodbyes 
### 
Being a senior means say
ing goodbye to a lot of
things, and it isn't a
whole lot of fun.
Come June, I will hid adieu
to the finals crunch, sleep depri
vation and Food Service —
these things I won't miss. But
the most important pieces of my
life, namely the people and
experiences I've known here,
will be difficult to leave.
Already, I've said goodbye to my
last October on the Farm, my
final first-week-of-November,
my last November 14 ... the list
goes on, and my future creeps
ever closer. It scares me to
death.

This Saturday, when the 22
senior football players took
their "Last Walk" before the
final home game, I was remind
ed of this strange passage of
time. Amid the applause of fans
and family, each athlete passed
through the tunnel of band
members and supporters for the
last time of their collegiate
careers.
Perhaps they were remem
bering the very first time they
stepped onto that field. Maybe
they were reliving their best and
worst plays, the camaraderie,
the noise. Or maybe they were
trying not to think of the weight
of it all, and just simply concen
trating on putting one foot in
front of the other.
"I don't really want it to
end," said senior Justin Armour
after the game, "but it's got to."
This Saturday, I too will say
a reluctant goodbye to Stanford
football. Sure, I may return as a
hoity-toity alumnus in 15 years
with a Mercedes and 2.4 kids,
and throw a tailgater featuring
caviar and white wine (more
Uke bread and water from the
trunk of my 80 Volvo). But it
will never be the same.

When else will I wear a red
trash bag over my shoulders
and a Burger King crown on my
head? I will never again feel as
cold as I did sleeping out for my
first game against Colorado, as
rebellious as I did sneaking fruit
into Big Game, as hyped to give
high-fives all around and
scream at the top of my lungs.
But still I must say goodbye.
"Au revoir" to overpriced
frozen lemonades, ineffective
yell leaders and shaky bleach
ers. "Hasta" to alums who
never stand and students who
never sit. "See ya" to Flag Boy
and that cannon blast at the end
of Arthur P. Barnes' rendition
of the national anthem. All of
those things, and more — I'll
miss them.
Mostly I will miss the great
moments in Stanford football
from these past four seasons.
For years to come, I will recall
the crazed lunacy of rushing
Cal's field two years ago in the
midst of mustard fights and vio
lent Weenies. I'll remember
Steve Stenstrom's wonder arm,
Armour's effortless catches and
the heroics of the entire team as
we pounded the Huskies two
weeks ago.
More sorely I'll relive the
utter despair of seeing those
dirty Golden Bears tear down
our goalposts after last year's
mauling. Sitting in the stands
long after the game was over, I
watched the Weenies rip up our
field, attack our Tree and take
away our Axe. That was rivalry
at its finest, and I'll even miss
that.
To all the things that make
up a Stanford football game —
from the jump in "All Right
Now" to the frantic clapping
that accompanies the "William
Tell Overture" — goodbye.
I don't really want it to end,
but it's got to.
There are many "walks"
through life, and being a senior
is just one of them. This Satur
day I will say goodbye to Stan
ford football — but hopefully
not before I say hello again to
the Axe.

Allyson sends her best karma to
the Cardinal this Saturday.
Beat Cal!
