## Soccer recounts paradoxic season 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
Stanford men's soccer head coach Colin Lindores
has never experienced more losses. Yet, the Cardinal
(5-12-2) has rarely shown more talent and more
potential to become a great team. The paradoxical
1994 season marked a changing of the guard on the
Farm, with five outstanding seniors moving on and
many underclassmen moving up to fill their cleats.
"We had big expectations," said senior
forward/defender Ryan Estevez. "We had a lot of tal
ent In the preseason I couldn't imagine any team
beating us because we seemed so solid in every
respect."
The Cardinal's season-opening tournament bore
out these expectations, as Stanford defeated Cal State
Fullerton and battled UCLA, the Pacific Division
champions, to a tie in regulation time before falling in
overtime. From that point on, however, the Cardi
nal's fortune soured decisively.
In the eight following games, Stanford lost seven
and tied one. One aspect of Stanford's season reared
its ugly head during this dry-spell — injuries. Soccer
is a very physical and aggressive sport, but the Cardi
nal suffered many more than the usual slew of knee
and ankle sprains. The fact that many players lost
were starters aggravated the problem.
Senior midfielder Ryan Collins and junior for
ward/midfielder Steve Kirschbaum both suffered sea
son-ending knee injuries. Stanford's strategy had
originally figured heavily on the contributions of
these two athletes — the team planned to play
through Kirschbaum in the center and Collins was to
provide much of the scoring.
At various points in the season, junior forward
Carmen D'Onofrio, freshman midfielder/forward
Justin Leßlanc, sophomore midfielder Paul Philips,
and freshman midfielder Daniel Wytock — all
starters — had to sit on the sidelines with injuries.
With its unstable personnel situation, the Cardinal
never had the security of a strong lineup.
"Although injuries are a part of the game," Lin
dores said, "we had an overdose of them. Overall, how
we played was typical of a team that never reached a
level of consistency in our lineup. We had constantly
changing personnel until the last five games. We were
missing starters that we were really depending on,
that make the team function. Sometimes individuals
can make things happen."
Stanford's inconsistent play reflected its shaky
lineup. In addition to the tough contest against
UCLA, probably the Cardinal's
most memorable moment of the
season was upsetting No. 4 Fresno
State. The Cardinal dealt the
Mountain Division champion Bull
dogs their only loss of the season
outside of their first game. Also,
Stanford tied the Air Force Acade
my in Colorado Springs, a high-alt i
tude feat few teams have managed.
However, the Cardinal lost a
bevy of matches that, by all
accounts, it should have won. For
instance, versus the University of
Akron, Stanford clearly fielded the
better squad. Yet, the Zips man
aged to defeat the Cardinal 4-3 with
their opportunistic long-ball game.
The most costly of Stanford's losses
came in league play. With the
Mountain Division title and post
season chances on the line, the Car
dinal failed to stymie a talented but
unspectacular Cal squad.
"We're closer to being a good
team than our record demon
strates," Lindores said.
Despite the team's 12 losses, the
strong play of certain individuals
boosted the Stanford effort. In
their last season, the Cardinal's
seniors played their hearts out to
leave the Farm on a good note.
Despite the extreme frustration of
the year, all four non-injured

seniors helped Stanford smother
UC-Santa Barbara 4-0 in the sea
son's last game.
Of all the players on the team,
senior midfielder Greg Wilson was
the only one to start in and play
every game. Wilson made honor
able mention in this year's Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation All-
Federation selection. Lindores
hails Wilson as the most improved
player of the year.
"Even though as a team this
season was not good," Wilson said,
"individually, I felt I could end on
this season. I gave it my honest
effort every game. I had some
injuries but I never sat out. Even
when there was no chance of win
ning the conference, I was still play
ing for something else. It's a good
way to end my soccer career even
though I'm sad about it."
Lindores picked senior Jeff
Kogl, a Second-Team All-Federa
tion midfielder, as the most consis
tent player of the year. Especially in
light of the extremely young lineup
Stanford was forced to start, Kogl
provided some essential stability.
His presence was sorely missed in
the loss to Cal.
Senior goalkeeper Jim Masetti
left Stan ford soccer with a tem
pered perspective. After having
been cut from the team his fresh
man year, Masetti returned his
junior year not taking anything for
grim ted.
"Sure it's frustrating to go out
with a bad season," Masetti said.

"But when the going gets tough
you really see who's playing for the
love of the game and who's in it just
for the glory."
Estevez, a transfer from Van
derbilt University, held in tough all
the way to the end. He filled in at
the Cardinal's thinned-out forward
position and kept the Stanford
attack alive. However, he cites the
camaraderie of playing as what he
will miss the most.
"It's going to be tough," Estevez
said. "My best' friends were on the
team. Especially since I was a trans
fer, they were the guys who really
took me in. Soccer was an integral
part of my Stanford experience."
Finally, Collins compounded the
season's frustrations with a knee
injury. Although Collins has aspi
rations to play after graduation in a
semi-professional league, he echoed
Estevez's sentiments.
"We all struggled together on
the field, dealt with the same prob
lems — that was really important,"
Collins said. "It's a great group of
guys."
Next season, new players from
this group will have to step up.
D'Onofrio has already established
himself, garnering a First-Team
All-Federation selection, and
freshman midfielder Eric Vande
velde has left an imprint with his
scoring.
The changing of the guard at the
Farm certainly did not take place
smoothly, but it provided glimpses
of hope for next season.

has never experienced more losses. Yet, the Cardinal
(5-12-2) has rarely shown more talent and more
potential to become a great team. The paradoxical
1994 season marked a changing of the guard on the
Farm, with five outstanding seniors moving on and
many underclassmen moving up to fill their cleats.
"We had big expectations," said senior
forward/defender Ryan Estevez. "We had a lot of tal
ent In the preseason I couldn't imagine any team
beating us because we seemed so solid in every
respect."
The Cardinal's season-opening tournament bore
out these expectations, as Stanford defeated Cal State
Fullerton and battled UCLA, the Pacific Division
champions, to a tie in regulation time before falling in
overtime. From that point on, however, the Cardi
nal's fortune soured decisively.
In the eight following games, Stanford lost seven
and tied one. One aspect of Stanford's season reared
its ugly head during this dry-spell — injuries. Soccer
is a very physical and aggressive sport, but the Cardi
nal suffered many more than the usual slew of knee
and ankle sprains. The fact that many players lost
were starters aggravated the problem.
Senior midfielder Ryan Collins and junior for
ward/midfielder Steve Kirschbaum both suffered sea
son-ending knee injuries. Stanford's strategy had
originally figured heavily on the contributions of
these two athletes — the team planned to play
through Kirschbaum in the center and Collins was to
provide much of the scoring.
At various points in the season, junior forward
Carmen D'Onofrio, freshman midfielder/forward
Justin Leßlanc, sophomore midfielder Paul Philips,
and freshman midfielder Daniel Wytock — all
starters — had to sit on the sidelines with injuries.
With its unstable personnel situation, the Cardinal
never had the security of a strong lineup.
"Although injuries are a part of the game," Lin
dores said, "we had an overdose of them. Overall, how
we played was typical of a team that never reached a
level of consistency in our lineup. We had constantly
changing personnel until the last five games. We were
missing starters that we were really depending on,
that make the team function. Sometimes individuals
can make things happen."
Stanford's inconsistent play reflected its shaky
lineup. In addition to the tough contest against
UCLA, probably the Cardinal's
most memorable moment of the
season was upsetting No. 4 Fresno
State. The Cardinal dealt the
Mountain Division champion Bull
dogs their only loss of the season
outside of their first game. Also,
Stanford tied the Air Force Acade
my in Colorado Springs, a high-alt i
tude feat few teams have managed.
However, the Cardinal lost a
bevy of matches that, by all
accounts, it should have won. For
instance, versus the University of
Akron, Stanford clearly fielded the
better squad. Yet, the Zips man
aged to defeat the Cardinal 4-3 with
their opportunistic long-ball game.
The most costly of Stanford's losses
came in league play. With the
Mountain Division title and post
season chances on the line, the Car
dinal failed to stymie a talented but
unspectacular Cal squad.
"We're closer to being a good
team than our record demon
strates," Lindores said.
Despite the team's 12 losses, the
strong play of certain individuals
boosted the Stanford effort. In
their last season, the Cardinal's
seniors played their hearts out to
leave the Farm on a good note.
Despite the extreme frustration of
the year, all four non-injured

seniors helped Stanford smother
UC-Santa Barbara 4-0 in the sea
son's last game.
Of all the players on the team,
senior midfielder Greg Wilson was
the only one to start in and play
every game. Wilson made honor
able mention in this year's Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation All-
Federation selection. Lindores
hails Wilson as the most improved
player of the year.
"Even though as a team this
season was not good," Wilson said,
"individually, I felt I could end on
this season. I gave it my honest
effort every game. I had some
injuries but I never sat out. Even
when there was no chance of win
ning the conference, I was still play
ing for something else. It's a good
way to end my soccer career even
though I'm sad about it."
Lindores picked senior Jeff
Kogl, a Second-Team All-Federa
tion midfielder, as the most consis
tent player of the year. Especially in
light of the extremely young lineup
Stanford was forced to start, Kogl
provided some essential stability.
His presence was sorely missed in
the loss to Cal.
Senior goalkeeper Jim Masetti
left Stan ford soccer with a tem
pered perspective. After having
been cut from the team his fresh
man year, Masetti returned his
junior year not taking anything for
grim ted.
"Sure it's frustrating to go out
with a bad season," Masetti said.

"But when the going gets tough
you really see who's playing for the
love of the game and who's in it just
for the glory."
Estevez, a transfer from Van
derbilt University, held in tough all
the way to the end. He filled in at
the Cardinal's thinned-out forward
position and kept the Stanford
attack alive. However, he cites the
camaraderie of playing as what he
will miss the most.
"It's going to be tough," Estevez
said. "My best' friends were on the
team. Especially since I was a trans
fer, they were the guys who really
took me in. Soccer was an integral
part of my Stanford experience."
Finally, Collins compounded the
season's frustrations with a knee
injury. Although Collins has aspi
rations to play after graduation in a
semi-professional league, he echoed
Estevez's sentiments.
"We all struggled together on
the field, dealt with the same prob
lems — that was really important,"
Collins said. "It's a great group of
guys."
Next season, new players from
this group will have to step up.
D'Onofrio has already established
himself, garnering a First-Team
All-Federation selection, and
freshman midfielder Eric Vande
velde has left an imprint with his
scoring.
The changing of the guard at the
Farm certainly did not take place
smoothly, but it provided glimpses
of hope for next season.
