## Soccer recounts paradoxic season 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
Stanford men's soccer head coach Colin Lindores
has never experienced more losses. Yet, the Cardinal
(5-12-2) has rarely shown more talent and more
potential to become a great team. The paradoxical
1994 season marked a changing of the guard on the
Farm, with five outstanding seniors moving on and
many underclassmen moving up to fill their cleats.
"We had big expectations," said senior
forward/defender Ryan Estevez. "We had a lot of tal
ent In the preseason I couldn't imagine any team
beating us because we seemed so solid in every
respect."
The Cardinal's season-opening tournament bore
out these expectations, as Stanford defeated Cal State
Fullerton and battled UCLA, the Pacific Division
champions, to a tie in regulation time before falling in
overtime. From that point on, however, the Cardi
nal's fortune soured decisively.
In the eight following games, Stanford lost seven
and tied one. One aspect of Stanford's season reared
its ugly head during this dry-spell — injuries. Soccer
is a very physical and aggressive sport, but the Cardi
nal suffered many more than the usual slew of knee
and ankle sprains. The fact that many players lost
were starters aggravated the problem.
Senior midfielder Ryan Collins and junior for
ward/midfielder Steve Kirschbaum both suffered sea
son-ending knee injuries. Stanford's strategy had
originally figured heavily on the contributions of
these two athletes — the team planned to play
through Kirschbaum in the center and Collins was to
provide much of the scoring.
At various points in the season, junior forward
Carmen D'Onofrio, freshman midfielder/forward
Justin Leßlanc, sophomore midfielder Paul Philips,
and freshman midfielder Daniel Wytock — all
starters — had to sit on the sidelines with injuries.
With its unstable personnel situation, the Cardinal
never had the security of a strong lineup.
"Although injuries are a part of the game," Lin
dores said, "we had an overdose of them. Overall, how
we played was typical of a team that never reached a
level of consistency in our lineup. We had constantly
changing personnel until the last five games. We were
missing starters that we were really depending on,
that make the team function. Sometimes individuals
can make things happen."
Stanford's inconsistent play reflected its shaky
lineup. In addition to the tough contest against
