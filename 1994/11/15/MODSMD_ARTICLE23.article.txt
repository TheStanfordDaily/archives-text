# Sailers land first place in Intersectional
## 
### Ben Hur 
Like most people involved with collegiate
sailing, Stanford coach Steve Bourdow was not
surprised by the Cardinal's victory at the North-
South Intersectional, a win that asserted its
position as the best squad in the west.
"We did what we expected to do this week
end," Bourdow said.
The competition, held at Lake Cachuma in
southern California, pitted some of the best sail
ing teams in the country against each other and
determined the autumn rankings of all West

Coast schools. The victor also received first
choice on which regattas to attend in the spring.
The Cardinal captured the victory by an
impressive 48-point margin, easily surpassing
second place UC-Irvine. The University of
Southern California finished third.
Stanford dominated the regatta, with senior
Charles Meade and freshman Betsy Carmicheal
winning the A division and freshman John
Meade taking the D division. Freshman Danny
Zimbaldi, racing with junior Sibyl Diver and
sophomore Ki Mun, finished a close second in
the B division, only three points out of first

place. Junior Adam Lowery overcame a couple
of poor races to finish second in the C division.
A productive week of practice coupled with
Stanford's superior depth enabled the Cardinal
to excel.
"We were really well prepared and very con
sistent," John Meade said. "Everybody sailed to
the peak of their abilities. That was why we did
so well."
Meade destroyed his competition in the D
division, winning seven races and finishing with
the lowest point total, only half as
many as his nearest competitor.
Strong winds on Saturday
also helped the Stanford squad,
and in particular the dinghy tan
dem of Zimbaldi and Diver, win
ners of four out of the six races
that day.
"We were both very confident
in our ability to sail as a team,"
Diver said. "We channeled our
concentration on the course and
did a good job of anticipating."
This regatta marked the end
of the fall season, and the Cardi
nal will hold on to its No. 1 rank
ing at least until January, when
the winter season begins.
