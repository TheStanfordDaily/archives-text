ranked Oklahoma State, the No. 1 Stanford
men's golf team finished second in the Golf
World/Palmetto Dunes Collegiate Tourna
ment this weekend in Hilton Head, S.C.

The tournament is always
decided on the 17th. Unfortu
nately for us, we had some
problems approaching the
green.'
—Wally Goodwin

With both the team and individual titles
on the line, Oklahoma State's Chris Tidland
sank a 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th green,
placing his team one stroke ahead of the
defending NCAA champion Cardinal. The
shot also gave hirn a one-stroke victory over
Georgia Tech's Stewart Cink.
Despite the lofty expectations placed on
his team, head coach Wally Goodwin was
satisfied with this weekend's results. "Ideal
ly, we'd like to win every time," Goodwin
said, "but this was still a good tournament
for us. I feel like it has further established
ourselves and Oklahoma State as the two
teams to beat."
Leading by three strokes after two
rounds, the Cardinal, like the rest of the
field, encountered trouble on the third day,
when the weather proved particularly cold
and windy.
"After playing two excellent rounds, we
had some difficulty adjusting to the condi
tions on Sunday," Goodwin said.
The second-place finish came as
Stanford's fourth straight in the top
three thus far. Throughout the fall
schedule, the team has placed out of the
top three only at the Tucker Invitational
in Albuquerque, N.M., where it finished
eighth without senior Ail-Americans

Notah Begay and Casey Martin, who
were serving a one-tournament suspen
sion for a slight NCAA infraction last
season.
Senior All-American Steve Burdick pro
vided the Cardinal with its tournament
highlight. He fired a five-under-par 211 en
route to a tie for third place individually.
"Overall, I was pleased with my perfor
mance." he said. "I felt like I played pretty
consistent golf and was able to maintain a
solid game on a tough course."
Burdick's teammate Tiger Woods was
not so fortunate this weekend. Entering the
final round leading the field by two strokes,
the freshman encountered some difficulty,
overhitting three of the first four greens on
the front nine, accumulating three quick
bogeys.
"Tiger just couldn't seem to find his
rhythm on Sunday." Goodwin said.
After finishing the front nine solidly
with a birdie, Woods' game declined, hit
ting rock bottom at the 17th hole where
he shot a double-par eight. He finished
with a eight-over-par 80, which dropped
him out of the top-10 individually. It was
the first score over par for Woods, who
up to this weekend, held the nation's
best scoring average at 69.6 strokes a
round.
The freshman phenom was not alone in
his trouble on the intimidating 17th hole.
Framed by dense woods and marked by two
dangerous water hazards, the hole general
ly draws the biggest crowds, eager to see
even the best collegians fall prey to its per
ils.
"The tournament is always decided on
the 17th," Goodwin said. "Unfortunately
for us, we had some problems approaching
the green." Like Woods, Begay overshot the
green and ended up in the trees just behind.
The mistake ultimately resulted in a dam
aging double-bogey.
The tournament marked the end of the
Cardinal's fall schedule. The team plays
only three tournaments in the next four
months, competing again next February in
Hawaii before traveling to Oregon in March.
