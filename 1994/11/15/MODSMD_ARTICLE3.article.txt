# Poet Adrienne Rich returns to Farm with 'Dark Fields'
## 
### Joanna Dickler 
Drawing a standing ovation from a ca
pacity crowd in Kresge Auditorium last
night, poet and former Stanford professor
Adrienne Rich delivered a reading that of
fered material for meditation to the mem
bers of a community she said she remem
bers fondly.
"It's very moving for me to be here
again tonight," said Rich, who now lives
and writes in Santa Cruz.
Her readings from her newest collec
tion of poetry, "Dark Fields of the Repub
lic," inspired a lively crowd to many in
stances of awed silence, interspersed with
low whistles.
The lecture, presented by the Creative
Writing Program, was part of the Jean
and Bill Lane Lecture Series. The first of

three Lane speakers for the 1994-95
school year, Rich will be followed by writ
ers Denise Levertov and Tobias Wolff.
A widely recognized and loved writer
whose poetry reaches back more than
four decades, Rich taught in the English
Department and Feminist Studies Pro
gram at Stanford from 1986 to 1990.
Among her many awards, her "genius
grant," awarded last June by the
Mac Arthur Foundation, stands out —
giving the poet $374,000 to use in any way
she wishes.
Despite her blessings, the 65-year-old
Rich told 500 audience members last
night that certain events can still depress
her. Last week's election, which occurred
as she was doing the final revisions for

Poet Adrienne Rich presented a few of her works to an audience at Kresge Auditori
um last night.
"Fields," caused her "a lot of
shame, a lot of rage, a lot of
grief."
"I revised more tough-mind
edly and vigorously than I have
ever done in my life," Rich said,
to "try to make I my] work truer
to a vision of what is possible."
This vision came partially to
light in Rich's last poem of the
night, when she read excerpts
from her work "Inscriptions."
While writing the poem, Rich
said she had in mind the evolu
tion of a person's political aware
ness.
In part, she was trying to cap
ture "the turbulence ... of com
ing to understand oneself as a
political person."

"When a voice learns to sing,
it can be heard as dangerous.
When a voice learns to listen, it
can be seen as desperate," says
the poem's speaker.
Rich's concern for the devel
oping person also came across in
"Rachel," a poem written for her
niece.
"What she opens her grey
eyes on is drastic," Rich's poem
says. "It's the end of a century."
Where Rachel will be left when
the century turns, and she is an
adult dealing with a younger
generation, is a question the
poem ponders and leaves unan
swered.
Lighter pieces revealed some
of Rich's signature audacious
and unexpected witticisms.
One such piece, "Sending
Love," reflected on the common
practice of "sending love" in a
letter, and variations on the

theme.
The audience erupted in
laughter in many instances, par
ticularly when the poem told of a
man who "on his e-mail finds
[love! waiting from Patricia." It
is the kind of love that "can't
make you sick," the poem
observes.
Although Rich's politics and
her awareness of the human con
dition find their way into her
poems, she said much poetry is
written in voices — voices that
are not necessarily her own or
those of real living beings.
She noted that the poet Wal
lace Stevens said that all poetry
is fiction.
"I don't know if I agree with
that," she said.
"Poetry is often a fiction,"
Rich allowed. After a moment,
she added, "that tries to tell the
truth."
