# Forging a trail of his own
## Robert Warrior settles in as Farm's sole Native American prof 
### Nina Wasow 
In his own words, Robert Allen Warrior is a
"lowly" assistant English professor. But he would be
the only person to say that.
Warrior, an Osage Indian, has definitely made a
name and a place for himself at Stanford by enrich
ing the intellectual community with his Native
American literature classes.
Warrior is the only Native American faculty mem
ber and the only professor teaching Native American
literature and intellectual history on campus. Stan
ford's lack of Native American faculty is one element
propelling discussion about a possible program in
Native American Studies.
While he supports the idea of a program, saying, "I
would love to have colleagues and more grad stu
dents in that area here," he also feels that the matter
is, to some extent, out of his reach. He says, "That's
up to administrators."

Warrior emphasized that universities around the
country should work to change misconceptions that
exist about Native Americans.
"So much of the challenge faced on the academic
end is breaking stereotypes, not breaking ground,"
he said, "because that's already been done."
At Stanford, Warrior has played a large part in
this innovation through his independent work in the
long-unexplored field of Native American studies.
Though he received his master's degree in religion
from Yale Divinity School, and master's and doctor
ate degrees from Union Theological Seminary in
New York, he found there weren't exactly abundant
resources when it came to Native American issues.
"I took one course in Native American studies, I
think in graduate school," he said.
"I basically developed my own curriculum, by
reading Indian literature," Warrior said. One look

with books, most with well worn
spines and frayed pages — con
firms his ravenous reading
habits.
"I grew up having gained a
really voracious appetite for read
ing from my father," Warrior
said. He was raised in Wichita,
Kansas, and on a reservation in
Osage County, Oklahoma.
"I also got this part of him that
was an Indian," he added. "Not
stereotypically — he wasn't sit
ting in a teepee. He was a sales
man, who always had this cultur
al stuff around."
The rich Native American lit
erary tradition, however, didn't
become clear to Warrior until
later in life.
"I always knew it was there,
but in college and grad school, a
lot of the literature opened up to
me," Warrior said. "Like C.S.
Lewis said, 'If you want to get a lot
of reading done, consider it a vice,'
" he said. "So I was always reading
instead of doing my homework."
Warrior said he is interesting
in teaching well-known Native
American literature, as well as
more obscure writings.
"Of course I like to teach the
great Native American writers,
like N. Scott Momaday," he said.
"I also like to teach the lesser

known writers of the 18th and
19th centuries, authors who
break stereotypes."
Warrior talked about one
author, a Pequot named William
Apess who was a Christian mis
sionary to soldiers in the 1820s
and 1830s.
Apess' writings are an example
of works he uses for discussion in
his class, "20th Century American
Indian Writing," Warrior said.
"There are a lot of contempo
rary works by American Indians,
writing critiques of Christian
practice, Christian hypocrisy,
Christian racism," Warrior said.
"Even those [Indians] who
were Christians railed against the
church, and had to come up with
a way of being both (Indians and
Christians!," he added. "And
often, they abandoned [religion 1
forcefully against injustice. They
took the position that, 'God
doesn't care about the color of my
skin, so why do you?' "
Warrior noted that in small
seminar settings, his classes have
been composed of more than 70
percent Native American stu
dents. "I enjoy having that audi
ence there," he said.
Of the students who are not
Native American, Warrior
acknowledged that ignorance
about the history and literature of
Native Americans is widespread.
"I recognize that, and I don't
punish them because of a (high
school) educational system that's

poor at best," he said. "I try to
make it a user-friendly course."
"It's difficult, because I'm try
ing to create a context in the 18th
and 19th century that is often
times not very pretty," Warrior
said. "We look at events like the
Trail of Tears and Wounded
Knee, through the eyes of Native
American authors."
After joining the Stanford fac
ulty in 1992, Warrior taught in the
freshman English program.
Besides teaching Native American
studies, he teaches about half the
time in the subject in which he was
trained: religion and theology.
Recently, Warrior finished a
book titled "Tribal Secrets:
Recovering American Indian
Intellectual Traditions," a com
parative interpretation of the
works of John Joseph Mathews
and Vine Deloria, Jr., two Native
American intellectuals who
rejected assimilationism.
The book was inspired by a
personal experience: "I met
Mathews in the early 1970s at a
tribal celebration where he was
autographing books. I must have
been 8 or 9," Warrior said.
"lln my book] I examined their
writing, and the challenges that
they posed to the field and to the
current generation of Native
Americans," he continued.
In the future, Warrior plans to
concentrate on 19th century writ
ers and pursue research in Native
American poetry.

known writers of the 18th and
19th centuries, authors who
break stereotypes."
Warrior talked about one
author, a Pequot named William
Apess who was a Christian mis
sionary to soldiers in the 1820s
and 1830s.
Apess' writings are an example
of works he uses for discussion in
his class, "20th Century American
Indian Writing," Warrior said.
"There are a lot of contempo
rary works by American Indians,
writing critiques of Christian
practice, Christian hypocrisy,
Christian racism," Warrior said.
"Even those [Indians] who
were Christians railed against the
church, and had to come up with
a way of being both (Indians and
Christians!," he added. "And
often, they abandoned [religion 1
forcefully against injustice. They
took the position that, 'God
doesn't care about the color of my
skin, so why do you?' "
Warrior noted that in small
seminar settings, his classes have
been composed of more than 70
percent Native American stu
dents. "I enjoy having that audi
ence there," he said.
Of the students who are not
Native American, Warrior
acknowledged that ignorance
about the history and literature of
Native Americans is widespread.
"I recognize that, and I don't
punish them because of a (high
school) educational system that's

poor at best," he said. "I try to
make it a user-friendly course."
"It's difficult, because I'm try
ing to create a context in the 18th
and 19th century that is often
times not very pretty," Warrior
said. "We look at events like the
Trail of Tears and Wounded
Knee, through the eyes of Native
American authors."
After joining the Stanford fac
ulty in 1992, Warrior taught in the
freshman English program.
Besides teaching Native American
studies, he teaches about half the
time in the subject in which he was
trained: religion and theology.
Recently, Warrior finished a
book titled "Tribal Secrets:
Recovering American Indian
Intellectual Traditions," a com
parative interpretation of the
works of John Joseph Mathews
and Vine Deloria, Jr., two Native
American intellectuals who
rejected assimilationism.
The book was inspired by a
personal experience: "I met
Mathews in the early 1970s at a
tribal celebration where he was
autographing books. I must have
been 8 or 9," Warrior said.
"lln my book] I examined their
writing, and the challenges that
they posed to the field and to the
current generation of Native
Americans," he continued.
In the future, Warrior plans to
concentrate on 19th century writ
ers and pursue research in Native
American poetry.
In his own words, Robert Allen Warrior is a
"lowly" assistant English professor. But he would be
the only person to say that.
Warrior, an Osage Indian, has definitely made a
name and a place for himself at Stanford by enrich
ing the intellectual community with his Native
American literature classes.
Warrior is the only Native American faculty mem
ber and the only professor teaching Native American
literature and intellectual history on campus. Stan
ford's lack of Native American faculty is one element
propelling discussion about a possible program in
Native American Studies.
While he supports the idea of a program, saying, "I
would love to have colleagues and more grad stu
dents in that area here," he also feels that the matter
is, to some extent, out of his reach. He says, "That's
up to administrators."

Warrior emphasized that universities around the
country should work to change misconceptions that
exist about Native Americans.
"So much of the challenge faced on the academic
end is breaking stereotypes, not breaking ground,"
he said, "because that's already been done."
At Stanford, Warrior has played a large part in
this innovation through his independent work in the
long-unexplored field of Native American studies.
Though he received his master's degree in religion
from Yale Divinity School, and master's and doctor
ate degrees from Union Theological Seminary in
New York, he found there weren't exactly abundant
resources when it came to Native American issues.
"I took one course in Native American studies, I
think in graduate school," he said.
"I basically developed my own curriculum, by
reading Indian literature," Warrior said. One look

with books, most with well worn
spines and frayed pages — con
firms his ravenous reading
habits.
"I grew up having gained a
really voracious appetite for read
ing from my father," Warrior
said. He was raised in Wichita,
Kansas, and on a reservation in
Osage County, Oklahoma.
"I also got this part of him that
was an Indian," he added. "Not
stereotypically — he wasn't sit
ting in a teepee. He was a sales
man, who always had this cultur
al stuff around."
The rich Native American lit
erary tradition, however, didn't
become clear to Warrior until
later in life.
"I always knew it was there,
but in college and grad school, a
lot of the literature opened up to
me," Warrior said. "Like C.S.
Lewis said, 'If you want to get a lot
of reading done, consider it a vice,'
" he said. "So I was always reading
instead of doing my homework."
Warrior said he is interesting
in teaching well-known Native
American literature, as well as
more obscure writings.
"Of course I like to teach the
great Native American writers,
like N. Scott Momaday," he said.
"I also like to teach the lesser

known writers of the 18th and
19th centuries, authors who
break stereotypes."
