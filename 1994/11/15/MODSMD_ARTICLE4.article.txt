# Forging a trail of his own
## Robert Warrior settles in as Farm's sole Native American prof 
### Nina Wasow 
In his own words, Robert Allen Warrior is a
"lowly" assistant English professor. But he would be
the only person to say that.
Warrior, an Osage Indian, has definitely made a
name and a place for himself at Stanford by enrich
ing the intellectual community with his Native
American literature classes.
Warrior is the only Native American faculty mem
ber and the only professor teaching Native American
literature and intellectual history on campus. Stan
ford's lack of Native American faculty is one element
propelling discussion about a possible program in
Native American Studies.
While he supports the idea of a program, saying, "I
would love to have colleagues and more grad stu
dents in that area here," he also feels that the matter
is, to some extent, out of his reach. He says, "That's
up to administrators."

Warrior emphasized that universities around the
country should work to change misconceptions that
exist about Native Americans.
"So much of the challenge faced on the academic
end is breaking stereotypes, not breaking ground,"
he said, "because that's already been done."
At Stanford, Warrior has played a large part in
this innovation through his independent work in the
long-unexplored field of Native American studies.
Though he received his master's degree in religion
from Yale Divinity School, and master's and doctor
ate degrees from Union Theological Seminary in
New York, he found there weren't exactly abundant
resources when it came to Native American issues.
"I took one course in Native American studies, I
think in graduate school," he said.
"I basically developed my own curriculum, by
reading Indian literature," Warrior said. One look
around his small office — where the walls are lined
