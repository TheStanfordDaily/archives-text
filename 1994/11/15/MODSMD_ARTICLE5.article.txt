# Early decision: the competitive edge?
## New program not a new idea for admissions office 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Though Stanford's recent adoption of an
early decision program has been praised by
many as a necessary step for attracting the
nation's best students, some University of
ficials say they are doubtful the change —
which represents a fundamental shift in
Stanford's admissions philosophy — will
notably increase the yield rate.
"It's good for students whose first choice
is Stanford, . . . [but] it's not going to
change things very much, I believe," said
Physics Department Chair Doug Osheroff,
who heads a committee examining ways to
increase faculty involvement in the admis
sions process.
The new policy was designed to make
Stanford more competitive against schools
such as Harvard, Yale and other East Coast
institutions.
The early decision program will allow

students who are willing to
commit themselves to
Stanford to apply early to
the University and receive
admission notification in
mid-December. Another
program, which will allow
students to commit them
selves to Stanford and
apply by the regular dead
line, will give notification
in early February.

Early admissions programs are common
place at schools on the East Coast. Some
have a similar early decision program, while
other Ivy League schools have an early ac
tion program — a non-binding process in
which the applicant finds out admission sta
tus early but has until May to make a final
commitment.
But with the exception of Harvard Uni-


Montoya
versity, yield rates for Ivy League
schools average around 55 percent
— comparable to Stanford's own
54 percent yield rate this year.
A university's yield rate is the
percentage of its admitted stu
dents who choose to attend that
specific school.
Although Yale University has
used an early action program for
years, the school has continued to
experience a drop in its yield rate,
according to Yale's Dean of Under
graduate Admissions Richard
Shaw. He added, however, that
the drop has not been very signifi
cant.
But Stanford officials maintain
that an early decision program will
help the University attract top
students by making the admis
sions schedule more flexible, in
keeping with other schools.
Ivy League precedent
Of the eight Ivy League schools,
four have early action programs
while four have early decision.
Harvard, Yale, Princeton and
Brown each have an early action
program. "It gives an opportunity

for people to know early and apply
early ... but does not lock them
in," Shaw said.
He added that he sees c.ie early
decision program as a "construc
tive change" for Stanford which
will "probably help Yale as well."
"It will allow early applicants to
apply and get out of the pool,
decreasing the number of dual
applicants," he said.
At Harvard — where the yield
rate stands at 75 percent — Dean
of Admissions and Financial Aid
William Fitzsimmons said that
while it was ideal to have students
take longer to make up their
minds, the school realized that
"some students are truly ready to
make that kind of decision."
Of the students who get admit
ted to Harvard through early
action, about 88 to 92 percent end
up attending the school.
"The question is, would they
have come anyway? Clearly, many
would have if our experience is
any indication," Fitzsimmons
said. "In circumspect, ultimately
what's important is not the yield
rate but the quality of the student
body."
Past attempts
This year does not mark the
first time a change in the admis

sions calendar has been consid
ered. Former Dean of Undergrad
uate Admissions Jean Fetter, now
an assistant to University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper, said the
Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions studied implementing an
early decision program in the mid
1980s.
"We spent considerable time
weighing the pros and cons [of
such a program ].. . and concluded
that it would not be beneficial for
Stanford," Fetter said.
The admissions office's best
estimate was that such a program
would attract about 20 additional
students a year who would not
have chosen Stanford otherwise,
Fetter said.
She cautioned that the num
bers were unpredictable, however,
because "it's a variable parameter
program."
Fetter added that she does not
believe in early admissions pro
grams and that she personally
thinks universities should handle
all their admissions decisions
through the regular review pro
cess.
"There are good educational
reasons for not having an early
decision program," Fetter said.
"Schools benefit from seeing what
classes students are taking their

senior year . . . [andj students
make better decisions when they
have an array of colleges to choose
from."
Despite her views on early
admissions programs, Fetter con-

ceded that it was
increasingly clear
that Stanford
was at a disad
vantage by not
having such a
program.
"Stanford has
been forced to
modify its (admis
sions] process

because of the surrounding envi
ronment," she said. "[The change]
will level the playing fields
between the high-caliber schools."
A philosophical change
Before the introduction of the
early decision program, Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid James Montoya said
admissions officials felt it was
important to view every applica
tion before deciding on any indi
vidual student.
"We have come to realize that
as we read applications, we are
making decisions," Montoya said.
The early decision program, there
fore, "does reflect a philosophical

change," he added.
Montoya de-emphasized the
focus on yield rates. "The Univer
sity can artificially increase yield
rates by accepting students we
don't think would go to Harvard
or Yale,"he said.
But Stanford is interested in
attracting the best and brightest
students, Montoya said. Based on
research, his office found that
"some of the nation's best stu
dents are applying early else
where," he added.
Montoya said early decision
programs improve the access to
the University for prospective stu
dents by "making the admissions
calendar more flexible."
The school decided on the
early decision program — rather
than the early action plan —
because such a program, "we
sensed . .. had no disadvantage
for a place like Stanford," Mon
toya said.
Changes to the application pro
cess seems to have caught a trend
among several campuses across
the nation. Earlier this year Har
vard switched to the common
application, and Fitzsimmons said
that "it's been announced that
Princeton will be going to early
decision next year."
With the early decision pro

gram, Montoya said students will
have to commit to the University
when they apply, but that the
application is binding only if the
financial aid is satisfactory and
meets the student's needs.
"There's an outstanding num
ber of bright students who really
want to be here," said Communi
cation Prof. Kristine Samuelson,
chair of this year's Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid. "[Early decision]
provides a mutual opportunity for
both Stanford and prospective stu
dents."
The decision to change the
admissions calendar was
announced last week following the
release of that committee's annual
report.
The report stated that while
Stanford has been successful in
"admitting an increasing number
of top-rated students," the yield
rate for those living on the East
Coast has been steadily declining
since the 1989 Loma Prieta Earth
quake.
"Stanford has held its own on
the western half of the country,"
Montoya said. "[Since the earth
quake,] the areas of the country
where we have seen a decrease
have been New England, the mid-
Atlantic and the South."
