Though Stanford's recent adoption of an
early decision program has been praised by
many as a necessary step for attracting the
nation's best students, some University of
ficials say they are doubtful the change —
which represents a fundamental shift in
Stanford's admissions philosophy — will
notably increase the yield rate.
"It's good for students whose first choice
is Stanford, . . . [but] it's not going to
change things very much, I believe," said
Physics Department Chair Doug Osheroff,
who heads a committee examining ways to
increase faculty involvement in the admis

The new policy was designed to make
Stanford more competitive against schools
such as Harvard, Yale and other East Coast
institutions.
The early decision program will allow

students who are willing to
commit themselves to
Stanford to apply early to
the University and receive
admission notification in
mid-December. Another
program, which will allow
students to commit them
selves to Stanford and
apply by the regular dead
line, will give notification
in early February.

Early admissions programs are common
place at schools on the East Coast. Some
have a similar early decision program, while
other Ivy League schools have an early ac
tion program — a non-binding process in
which the applicant finds out admission sta
tus early but has until May to make a final
commitment.
