After months of discussion and research,
the committee to examine the feasibility of
a Chicano Studies program will release its
confidential report to Dean of Humanities
and Sciences John Shoven next week.
Although he would not release details of
the committee's proposal, Assoc. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Ramon Saldivar,
the committee's chair, said a comparative
program on ethnic studies was an option
that the committee has considered.
"Students want a rigorous program ...
in which they can examine the sophisticat

program.
The report is the culmination of a study
on "an issue that a lot of people have been
widely involved in," Saldivar said. The 12-

the resolution of last spring's student
hunger strike, in response to the demand
for a Chicano Studies program.
A similar committee was formed to study
the possibility of implementing an Asian-
American Studies program. That commit

the quarter.
The Chicano Studies committee will
hold its final meetings this week to combine
