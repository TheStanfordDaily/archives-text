# Chicano Studies group nears finish on report
## 
### Megan Himan Staff writer 
After months of discussion and research,
the committee to examine the feasibility of
a Chicano Studies program will release its
confidential report to Dean of Humanities
and Sciences John Shoven next week.
Although he would not release details of
the committee's proposal, Assoc. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Ramon Saldivar,
the committee's chair, said a comparative
program on ethnic studies was an option
that the committee has considered.
"Students want a rigorous program ...
in which they can examine the sophisticat
ed range of knowledge of American cul
tures," he said.
Last month, Saldivar said research con
ducted over the summer showed that a cen

tral department for Chicano Studies is not
necessarily a precondition for a successful
program.
The report is the culmination of a study
on "an issue that a lot of people have been
widely involved in," Saldivar said. The 12-
member committee was formed as part of
the resolution of last spring's student
hunger strike, in response to the demand
for a Chicano Studies program.
A similar committee was formed to study
the possibility of implementing an Asian-
American Studies program. That commit
tee should complete its report by the end of
the quarter.
The Chicano Studies committee will
hold its final meetings this week to combine
the work done by various members of its
subcommittees. Last week, the
committee held its second open
forum to discuss the various
ways Chicano Studies programs
have been implemented at other
universities.
"At the second forum the
committee reported on their
research of the pros and cons of
various programs that exist at

other institutions," Saldfvar
said.
Saldfvar said the programs
researched by the committee
included those focusing on Chi
cano Studies specifically as well
as those which were part of an
ethnic or American Studies pro
gram. "In the American Studies
programs we looked to see how
they handled the diversity of
American cultures," Saldfvar
added.
The committee was aided by
"very productive, informed

input" from students, Saldivar
said. Student input was mainly
received at the two open forum
meetings held by the committee,
as well as through the four stu
dents on the committee, Saldivar
said.
Though the committee start
ed out with three students, the
fourth — graduate student Ali
cia Schmidt-Camacho — was
added to the committee after she
spent the summer researching
the issue as an assistant to
Saldivar.
