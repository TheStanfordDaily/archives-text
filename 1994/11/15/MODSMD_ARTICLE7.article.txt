### Samuel Park Contributing writer 
Only months after its return to
Wilbur Hall, Soto the dog was
stolen again early Monday morn
ing.
"We have a couple of leads, but
we're still investigating them,"
said Chris Place, a resident assis
tant in Soto. "We have not yet no
tified the police but we're thinking
of doing that."
Place said a Soto resident
might have witnessed the theft of
the stone dog, which is the dorm's
mascot.
Freshman Jaime Chang told
Place that she saw at least four
people leaving the dorm dressed in
dark clothing around 3 a.m. Mon
day, but that she could not identi
fy them.
"They must've been pretty big
people, since Soto (the statue)
weighs over 150 pounds," Place
said. "Chang thought they were
just people from the dorm wreak
ing havoc."
Soto residents said they are an
gered by the theft.
"A group of our freshmen are
talking about retaliating, so we
fear for [the kidnappers'] safety,"
Place said. "We want Soto back at
any cost."
The original Soto was Leland
Stanford, Jr.'s pet dog. Legend
says he saved the boy's life when
little Leland was attacked by a
rabid raccoon. Since the dog liked
to play in the area where Wilbur
now stands, Soto the dorm was
erected there in his honor.
Place said he suspects the kid
