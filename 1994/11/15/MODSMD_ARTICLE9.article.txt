Nuclear pressure supported
JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — In an orchestrat
ed show of unity, President Clinton won pledges
yesterday from China, Japan and South Korea to
keep the pressure on North Korea to freeze its sus
pected nuclear weapons program.
Clinton, after one-on-one talks with presidents
and prime ministers, said North Korea's neighbors
offered "their strong support" for the accord to
freeze and ultimately dismantle Pyongyang's nucle
ar program.
China, South Korea and Japan already had
endorsed the North Korean agreement, but Clinton
showcased the issue because many details of how to
implement the pact over 10 years remain to be
worked out.
Clinton said the plan — providing North Korea
with alternate fuels and new light-water reactors
for giving up its nuclear program — would "require

a lot of efforts on several fronts."
Perhaps the thorniest question is how to divide
the estimated $4 billion cost of the deal. Japan and
South Korea are expected to shoulder most of the
burden.
Small aircraft safety defended
WASHINGTON (AP) — An airline passenger
group says small commuter airplanes should be
avoided for safety reasons, but the airline industry,
defending the small aircraft, said the warning
issued yesterday "needlessly frightens the public."
And Federal Aviation Administrator David R.
Hinson said commuter airlines "have achieved and
have sustained a high level of safety."
The International Airline Passengers Associa
tion urged its members not to fly in planes with
fewer than 31 seats, which it said have an accident
rate "significantly higher" than larger craft.
