Recent Development of Scientific and Ethical Opinions on Fetal Tissue and Embryo Research
March 1988 Department of Health and Human Services moratorium:
•no federal funds for for human fetal tissue transplantation research using tissue from induced abortions until farther study
January 1989 NIH panel on human fetal tissue transplantation research recommedations to
the DHHS:
•lift the moratorium on federal funding of this research
•development of additional policy guidelines by the NIH staff
April 1989 Stanford University Medical Center Committee on Ethics statement published in
New England Journal of Medicine:
•fetal tissue use should be subject to the same rules as cadavers
•women who experience induced abortions should not profit from subsequent fetal tissue use
•medical personnel who perform abortions should not profit from subsequent fetal tissue use
•tissue use should be prohibited if fetus aborted specifically for donation purposes
•human fetal tissue can be used for medical research subject to these conditions
November 1989 DHHS Secretary Louis Sullivan continues the funding moratorium
August 1994 NIH advisory panel recommends human embryo research according to some
guidelines:
•research on embryos generated by IVF, up to 14 days
•creation of embryos (that would not otherwise be created)
for research purposes, in approved cases
•biopsy of embryo cells
•growing cell lines from IVF embryos that are not implanted
•Recommendations that may be approved in the future:
•creating research embryos from fetal oocytes
•embryo experimentation up to the 18th day of growth
•using eggs or sperm from donors who were paid for their gametes
•cloning embryos in their early stages
