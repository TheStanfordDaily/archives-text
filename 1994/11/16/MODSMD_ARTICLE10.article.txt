## Hispanic groups seek boycott 
### 
AUSTIN (AP) - Two Hispan
ic groups yesterday urged a
minority boycott of California
related products and entertain
ment — including Mickey Mouse
— after that state voted to deny
education and other services to
illegal immigrants.
"If California doesn't want our
people, we don't want to do busi
ness with California," said state
Rep. Roberto Alonzo of Dallas,
head of the Mexican American
Democrats of Texas, one of two
state MAD groups.
Alonzo was joined at a Capitol
news conference by Dallas busi
nessman Luis de la Garza, presi
dent of the North Texas immi
grant-rights organization El
Grupo de Apoyo a Immigrantes
Latinoamericanos, or GAILA.
De la Garza, who has a radio

talk show, and Alonzo said
they've received calls of concern
since California's Nov. 8 passage
of Proposition 187.
"The hysteria. . . has already
come to Texas," Alonzo said,
recounting the story of a woman
who was told by a bill collector,
"'Ma'am, if you don't pay your
bill, now that Proposition 187 has
passed, we're going to call the
INS (Immigration and Natural
ization Service) in to deport
you."'
Alonzo, calling specifically on
minority leaders and organiza
tions, said groups shouldn't have
their conventions in California
and should boycott "anything
that's connected to California,
even Mickey Mouse. We should
stop doing business with Califor
nia."

Hispanic-Americans in Ari
zona also have planned action in
response to the proposition's pas
sage, including a boycott.
Disneyland spokesman John
McClintock said Disney was neu
tral on Proposition 187 and the
park hasn't yet seen an effect on
attendance. "It's a free country,
and I think people should be able
to do what they feel they have to
do," McClintock said of the pro
posed boycott.
Ron Prince, chairman of Cali
fornia's Save Our State group
and an author of Proposition 187,
said the measure has nothing to
do with bill collectors and it isn't
targeting a particular race.
A spokesman for California
Gov. Pete Wilson didn't immedi
ately return a telephone call from
The Associated Press.
