Prayer in schools
WASHINGTON (AP)
School prayer Ls one thing he could
talk about with the Republicans,
President Clinton said yesterday.
A liberal group quickly accused
him of "an instant cave-in"
because of last week's election
results.
A proposed constitutional
amendment allowing voluntary
prayer in schools is among the
items high on the House Republi
cans' agenda. After they take
charge of Congress in January,
House GOP leaders plan hearings
on the subject, and they expect a
House vote by early July.
Liberal groups long have
argued against the amendment,
on the grounds it violates the con
stitutional separation of church
and state.
But Clinton, asked about the
GOP proposal during a news con

ference in Indonesia, where he is
attending a trade meeting, said he
did not believe that separation nec
essarily would be violated by vol
untary school prayer.
"What I think the country
needs and what I think the schools
need is a sense that there are cer
tain basic values of citizenship,
including valuing the right of peo
ple to have and express their faith,
which can be advocated without
crossing the line of separation of
church and state and without in
any way undermining the fabric of
our society," Clinton said.
He said he has personally sup
ported voluntary school prayer for
some time but that it was neces
sary to make sure students cannot
be coerced into praying, or forced
to say a specific prayer.
Fighting renewed
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegov

ina (AP) — Fighting convulsed
Bosnia's northwest pocket yester
day, where dug-in government
troops were trying to keep Bosnian
Serbs from overrunning an inter
nationally protected safe zone.
Fighting also exploded in the
Majevica hills in northeastern
Bosnia, site of a Serb-held TV
tower, and near Mostar on the
southwest front. Serbs claimed
gains in both regions, but U.N.
officials said the Muslim-led gov
ernment army appeared to have
the upper hand.
In the north, Bosnian Serbs
shelled Tuzla, another so-called
U.N. "safe area," for a second
straight day, killing one resident
and wounding three.
NATO was under pressure to
respond to the fighting in the
Bihac pocket in the northwest and
to U.N. accusations that Serbs in
neighboring Croatia were helping
Bosnian Serbs by providing
artillery cover. The Serbs deny it.
