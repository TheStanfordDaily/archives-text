# End to Angolan civil war?

LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) â€” Generals from
Angola's warring sides tried yesterday to turn
promises to end 19 years of fighting into a work
able truce.
U.N. special envoy Alioune Blondin Beye, who
has mediated peace talks for nearly a year, said
declaring a truce would enable the Angolan gov
ernment and the rebels to formally make peace at
a signing ceremony Sunday.
The signing was pushed back yesterday after
fighting in the rebel stronghold of Huambo and
elsewhere produced victories for government
forces and caused the rebel National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola, known as
UNITA, to balk.
The leader of the UNITA delegation in Lusa

ka, Gen. Eugenio Manuvakola, and Gen. Pedro
Neto, head of the government delegation to talks
in Zambia's capital, expressed optimism a negoti
ated settlement would end the conflict.
Manuvakola and Neto met late into the
evening yesterday, trying to work out details of a
truce.
Once the date and time of the cease-fire are
set, Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
and rebel leader Jonas Savimbi will come to
Lusaka to sign a peace treaty.
Savimbi's appearance in Lusaka would lay to
rest rumors that he has been killed or wounded
in the fighting.
Beye reported meeting with Savimbi in Octo
ber and finding him in good health.
