## Editorials Presidential speech 
### 
University presidents come in
all shapes and sizes. Some
are studious, others gregari
ous. Some are activist; others like to
play it safe. And some are politically
outspoken, while others simply are
not.
University President Gerhard
Casper is one of the presidents who
is not. He recently refused to speak
out publicly on Proposition 187 and
has made it his policy to generally
avoid taking stands on controversial
issues and events.
As irksome as some have found
this decision, it is a valid one that is
more a matter of leadership style
than absolute responsibility.
Many have recently denounced
Casper for not making his views
known. He was shirking his respon
sibility as the head of this institu
tion, they said.
However, even leaders of large,
influential institutions have a choice

in whether to go public with their
views or keep them to themselves.
Some will make their political views
the centerpiece of their administra
tion, while others prefer to leave the
politics out.
This does not mean that the indi
viduals who comprise the institu
tion must do the same.
In fact, it might be said that the
Stanford campus overwhelmingly
opposed Prop. 187 even though the
University president remained
silent on the issue. Stanford stu
dents spoke loud and clear on the
measure through a variety of cam
pus activities. And a poll conducted
by The Daily showed that nearly 80
percent of students opposed the
measure.
The job description of a universi
ty president includes many duties
that cover academic, financial and
administrative areas.
The politics are optional.
