# Keep Big Game safe
## 
### 
THERE IS A fine line between
healthy rivalry and misplaced
aggression. Two years ago
that line was crossed at Big Game.
Falling prey to a grinding Cardi
nal offense, the UC-Berkeley foot
ball squad was beaten in front of its
home crowd. Instead of swallowing
defeat stoically, some Cal support
ers deemed it more appropriate to
hurl frozen oranges at Stanford
players, band members and cheer
leaders.
A small group of Cal fans went
even further; they rushed past
unsuspecting security guards and
viciously tackled Greg Siegel, the
Tree at the time.
With Big Game approaching, it is
comforting to know that the Athlet
ics Department has taken steps to
ensure things don't get out of hand
again at Cal.
According to Rob Thompson, the
Events and Operations Manager for
the Athletics Department, repre
sentatives from relevant groups —

including the UC-Berkeley police
force, the Stanford Police Depart
ment and both schools' athletics
departments — have met on a regu
lar basis during the past six months
to discuss security concerns.
As a result, Thompson said that
this year's security at UC-Berkeley
will be much tighter. Guards will
undergo staff training prior to the
game, and a more thorough inspec
tion of incoming fans should pre
vent them from bringing objects
such as frozen oranges into the sta
dium, according to Thompson.
At the same time, it goes without
saying that Stanford students
should also take responsibility for
their own actions at Big Game.
Yelling, jeering and shouting insults
are all part of the fun; attempting to
hurt people is not.
When the final whistle is blown,
let's leave Cal fans with an intimi
dating memory of the Cardinal
offense — not a dizzying memory of
flying oranges.
