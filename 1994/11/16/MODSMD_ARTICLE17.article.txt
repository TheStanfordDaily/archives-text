Advice on dealing with programs like Prime Time Live

IJUST FINISHED watching Prime-
Time Live's program segment on
cheating in American colleges and
universities.
I was fortunate to have an insider's
perspective on the program since I was
interviewed by Chris Wallace for 35 min
utes or so during his visit to the Stanford
campus. Wallace was not interested in
anything I had to say that did not sup
port his desire to present a picture of
nationwide rampant cheating. It was evi
dent during the interview that he did not
want to hear any information or data at
odds with this grim picture. For example,
a 1994 survey of Stanford students finds
a significant increase in support for the
Honor Code over similar surveys con
ducted in 1976 and 1984. The same
database shows little or no change in
self-reported dishonesty with the excep
tion of unpermitted collaboration, where
attitudes and behaviors are changing and

students are engaging in more of this
type of cheating.
Since none of this interview appeared
in the program, I can only conclude that
my comments and data were left on the
editing room floor, rejected as unhelpful
to the development of the program plan.
By contrast, my colleague Don McCabe
(professor of management at Rutgers
University and a founder of the National
Center for Academic Integrity) got exten
sive coverage because his most recent
data from public colleges and universities
do suggest that cheating is widespread.
We're in the education business and I
can tell you that this experience has been
very educational. What have I learned?
1) When (and if) you watch an expose
type "news" program, always ask your
self, "What's missing? What am I not
hearing?" Remember the editing-room
floor.
2) If you are contacted by representa

tives of such a program, consult with
your president and news and communi
cations people prior to agreeing to a cam
pus visit, interviews or any other form of
cooperation.
3) If you agree to a campus visit by a
news team such as Prime Time Live's, be
sure to do the following:
• Notify your president and your news
service or public relations office of the
impending visit;
• Keep notes of all your conversations
or meetings with the producer or other
key participants;
• Have someone from your school pre
sent during your interview;
• Have that person make an audio
tape of the session;
• Take your time answering questions,
don't get riled and don't allow yourself to
be bullied into saying something that
isn't true and
• Most importantly, create opportuni

ties to say what you want the audience to
hear. Remember your own agenda.
Follow these rules and with any luck,
you too will not appear on Prime Time
Live or its ilk.
A final observation: Wallace, his pro
ducer and their film crew were intrusive
and rude during their visit. They made
an unannounced and unpermitted visit
to an undergraduate dormitory, which
was strictly prohibited by the terms of
Stanford's agreement with the network.
When asked to leave by the faculty resi
dent fellow, they refused. Their goal of
obtaining dramatic footage was more
important than respecting the rights of
the dormitory's residents.
So, in summary, watch out for these
folks and their genotypes. They are
mean-spirited, biased and totally unde
serving of your time or attention.
