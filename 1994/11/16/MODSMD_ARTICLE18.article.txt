# University should not force a chosen morality
## 
### 
I must say that Lawrence Tovar's let
ter printed in today's Daily is one of the
WORST things I have ever read. People
like him with such totalitarian views on
how people should behave disgust the
living hell out of me. Sure, I agree with
the general sentiment that The Review's
caricaturic use of the Native American is
horrible and insulting and immoral —
but to insist that it's the University's job
to mandate and enforce the implementa
tion of all morality in every facet of the
campus sector is utterly dictatorial. He
says, "Casper's licensing of the carica
ture has now created a dangerous cli
mate for the University"; far more dan
gerous, however, is the climate Tovar
himself wishes to create: a "Clockwork
Orange" state that suppresses every-

thing that doesn't go along with its
wishes.
