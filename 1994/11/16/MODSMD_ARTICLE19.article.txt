# Quirks in registrar of voters' computer system akin to a literacy test
## 
### 
In response to your editorial "Inform
voters of rules" (Nov. 14), I have a small
addendum. Despite the fact that I duti
fully registered to vote in late Septem
ber, by early November I had still not
received a ballot guide. So I called the
registrar of voters' office; she informed
me that because of the formatting of the
computer program, it was unable to
accommodate an address such as
McFarland 22C, Escondido Village (not

my real address). The computer
required a number first, so the comput
er had my address as 22C Escondido Vil
lage. That, of course, is another address
entirely.
She so utterly confused me as to
what my address was, or at least what it
ought to be in order to vote, that I
ended up voting provisionally (my name
did not show up on any of the voter
lists), and wrote on my ballot that I
might be registered under any one of a
few variations on my address. Whether
or not my vote counted I do not know,
but given my recent experience with the
registrar of voters' office, I doubt it did.
If their computer truly cannot accom
modate unusual addresses (and my
address is not that unusual), then some
people are essentially being excluded
from voting. I was asked to pas 3 a litera
cy test to vote, and I guess I failed.
