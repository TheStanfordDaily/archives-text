# Irwin's hearing postponed again
## Judge's absense delays senior's third court appearance in a month 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
The preliminary hearing for suspend
ed senior Thomas Irwin, charged with
felony vandalism of the "Gay Libera
tion" sculpture last May, was postponed
again yesterday because Palo Alto Mu
nicipal Court Judge Rise Jones Pichon
was absent.
The hearing, which will continue on
Dec. 13, was to be Irwin's third appear
ance in court.

Irwin and former student Todd
Laßocca were the only two students
charged with felonies in the incident,
where police arrested eight students for
pouring black paint on the George Segal
sculpture and wedging a bench between
two of its figures.
Of the remaining six students al
legedly involved, four have been
charged with misdemeanors.
Outside the courtroom yesterday
Irwin's attorney, John Hackmann said
he feels "the law is not being enforced

evenly."
He also said that the charges are too
harsh for young college students who
had just "screwed up." At the continu
ance Hackmann said that Irwin "could
be found innocent of all charges," claim
ing that the University has no evidence
against him.
Although police found Irwin with
paint on his hands, Hackmann said the
evidence does not mean he committed
the felony.
"[lrwin] had paint on his
hands but so did the police offi
cer (from the paint can)," he
said.
Irwin faces felony charges

because the $9,400 it cost to
repair the sculpture is higher
than the $5,000 cutoff between
misdemeanor and felony vandal
ism.
Hackmann said, however,
that because Stanford only
obtained one estimate of the
damages, he questions whether
the repairs could have been com
pleted for less money.
