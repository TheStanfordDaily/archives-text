A discourse on discourse

ON SUNDAY, NOV. 13, a number
of students gathered at Tresid
der Union to discuss different
perspectives on the political unrest in
Punjab, India. The discussion was the
result of profound personal invest
ment, every student involved voluntar
ily committing themselves to the cre
ation of a conversation they felt was
important yet had been absent for too
long.
The impetus for reviving the discus
sion on campus was a paid advertise
ment "Reflecting on the Assassination
of Indira Gandhi" published in The
Daily on Nov. 1, a piece which many
felt was misrepresentative in its one
sidedness. Several students responded
by composing individual replies pub
lished as letters to the editor in The
Daily. Using another tactic, an inde
pendent group of nine students con
cerned with the issue — a group con
taining a variety of backgrounds and
opinions — banded together to provide
an "educated response" in the form of
an organized panel discussion. Their
response, like those contained in the
letters, was passionate and informed
It was also inclusive, uniting any stu
dents with the desire to educate them
selves and each other through conver
sation.
The questions surrounding the
future of Punjab, of the Indian state
and the lives of Sikhs, Hindus and oth
ers who inhabit those regions are com
plex and volatile. As an outsider and

relative newcomer to the discussion, I
will not consume this space with my
own political views. I would, however,
like to express my admiration for the
more knowledgeable members and sup
porters of the Indian community who
articulated, with great sensitivity, a
form of interested scholarship. In only
10 days, these students conceived a
detailed program, including an infor
mation packet tracing the history of
Punjabi politics since Partition in 1947
and a panel of speakers to present
many sides of the political crisis.
Where in the past similar events have
descended into shouting and even vio
lence, this discussion was character
ized by consideration and control.
Such an environment — where stu
dents representing larger cultures in
conflict come together productively —
is a rarity. Yet this, the university,
should always be a safe haven for such
discourse. In a 1989 article in The New
Yorker, the brilliant writer and educa
tor George Steiner described the Uni
versity of Chicago under Robert May
nard Hutchins as just such a place,
where inspired teachers introduce the
attempt "to discover a general princi
ple of human understanding," and
where students are privileged to take
part in the "revaluation of knowledge
and society." Earlier, Hutchins had
identified this privilege on a grander
scale: "After all, the great thing about
a university is that it can afford to
experiment; and I use the word afford

not in its financial connotation, but to
remind us that a university is free to
cultivate and exhibit the independence
of thought, the willingness to depart
from tradition, the readiness to take a
chance."
I applaud those students who take
that chance in ways that are both per
sonal and political. These students are
activists in their own education, cre
atively applying the tools of criticism
and analysis towards issues that affect
them. They are a refreshing departure
from a student population which rarely
makes the effort to read each other's
work, much less question and com
ment upon it or encourage others to
enter into the discussion. I applaud
those students who place themselves in
a position to be, as Steiner says, "ine
briated" with the spirit of intellectual
exhilaration.
The multipartisan panel discussion
on Punjab is a remarkable instance
where students made that effort. I
commend their initiative, careful work
and commitment to an educated explo
ration of ideas. They acted in a way
that takes advantage of their privi
leged position as students; they have
exercised their power to reshape soci
ety. May others follow their example.

Elizabeth Kelly may not know it but
she, too, is exercising her power to
reshape society.
