## NIH may rule on embryo research 
### Julie Sauer Editorial staff 
In early December, the National Insti
tutes of Health (NIH) will reconsider poli
cies about human embryo research, open
ing the door for future federal funding of
this research at Stanford and research
institutions nationwide.
Historically, in 1988 the Department of
Health and Human Services (DHHS)
imposed a moratorium on federal funding
of research that transplants human fetal
tissue into human recipients.
Louis Sullivan, then DHHS secretary,
enacted the moratorium despite NIH rec
ommendations in favor of human fetal tis
sue transplantation research (HFTTR).
Prior to the 1988 ruling, in fiscal year
1987, the NIH awarded 11.2 million dol
lars in grants and contracts for human
fetal tissue experiments.
President Clinton removed the HFTTR
ban immediately upon taking office. The
administration has also approved research
on human embryos, opening the door for
NIH regulations that would allow for cre
ation and harvest of in vitro embryos. The
new rules would also allow experimenta
tion on pre-implantation embryos before
the 14th day of growth.
The pending rulings would broaden the
scope of permissible research to include
human embryos.
Dr. Irving Weissman, professor of
Pathology at the Stanford School of
Medicine, conducted fetal tissue research
under the 1988 DHHS moratorium. He
said the ban only prohibited use of fetal tis
sue for direct transplantation into patients
for therapy.
Although he no longer does fetal tissue
research, "we didn't stop research during
that time [the DHHS ban)," he said.
"Nothing we did was against the ban.
Some people interpreted the ban as
widespread, but it only prohibited implant
ing [fetal tissue] to patients," he added.
The medical community's interest in
human fetal tissue and more recently, in
human embryo cells, arises from the early
human cells' ability to proliferate, and
their decreased likelihood of being rejected
by the cell recipients.
The dubious morality of scientific

experimentation on living human embryos
generated in vitro makes this research a
subject of much debate.
Researchers are studying possible appli
cations in fetal tissue for treating Parkin
son's disease, muscular dystrophy, AIDS,
Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and for its
usefulness in organ transplants.
Embryonic experimentation is also
occuring to determine causes of reproduc
tive failure, infertility, and developmental
and birth defects.
According to Dr. Mark Johnson, assis
tant professor of Gynecology and Obstet
rics, researchers have done biopsies of
embryonic cells to understand human
reproductive biology. After the cell is
removed from the embryo, its genes can be
amplified or its chromosomes counted.
"As long as we know a gene for a specif
ic disease carried by the couple, then the
couple's pre-implantation embryos can be
screened for the gene during in vitro fertil
ization (IVF)," he said. "We can see which
embryos are normal and which are carriers
of the diseased gene." The normal embryos
can be selected for implantation.
This research is not currently conduct
ed at Stanford, but Johnson indicated that
there may be future plans here for experi
ments in this area.
The embryos carrying the disease, such
as cystic fibrosis, are not selected for
implantation. They must either die outside
the mother's body or, according to pending
NIH regulations, they could be subjected to
further experimentation.
Biopsy allows researchers to "take nor
mal human embryos that won't be used
[for implantation| and study their develop
ment as to how cells divide," Johnson said.
Johnson currently works with mouse
embryonic stem cells that make up the
inner cell mass of the blastocyst, which
gives rise to the embryo. He studies undif
ferentiated cells and cell growth, and his
work could be applicable to human
embryos under new NIII regulations.
Alan Krensky, professor of pediatrics, is
not involved in human embryo research.
However, he indicated that gene therapy, a
potential application of this research, may
be on the forefront of pediatric medicine.
"The potential to manipulate embryos
is quite astonishing," Krensky said. "The

biology is there. . .the science is easy. The
ethical issues tire hard."
The NIH panel for embryo research has
recommended regulations that will be
reviewed at a meeting of Director Harold
Varmus' advisory council on December 1
and 2.
The rules would allow NIH funding for
research on existing, 'unused' in-vitro
embryos up to the 14th or 18th day of
growth. The agency would allow human
embryos to be created in-vitro specifically
for research purposes. Pending regulations
also approve biopsy of embryo cells and the
creation of cell lines from embryos that are
a product of IVF.
In addition, the NIH panel is still con
sidering other ways of manipulating
human embryos. According to Weissman,
the new NIH guidelines have "opened the
possibility of transplantation of cells and
tissues to human patients for therapy."

This activity was banned under the Bush
administration.
The NIH regulations as recommended
by the human embryo panel are a cause for
moral and ethical concern, because they
permit creation of human embryos for
research purposes, and they allow experi
mentation on embryos that are a 'by-prod
uct' of IVF procedures. Human embryos
resulting from these processes either die or
iire subject to experimentation.
The opening of a field of embryo
research, coupled with the already existing
field of fetal tissue research, presents sev
eral difficult moral problems that are rec
ognized by scientists and ethicists alike.
The market for human fetal tissue for
medical purposes "could create financial
incentive {for abortion] that would be
unattractive to all of us," said Donald
Kennedy, professor of Biology and former
university president. Kennedy served as

Commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration from 1977-79.
Christopher Scott, Associate Director of
Beckman Center for Molecular and Genet
ic Medicine, sees the possibility of women
aborting for 'altruistic' reasons, for exam
ple, if they have a family member who may
benefit from fetal tissue.
Speaking of the pending NIH funding of
research that would create in vitro
embryos specifically for experimentation,
Scott said, "I have trouble with making a
factory for embryos."
Before the issue of human embryo
research emerged, but while the human
fetal tissue research was being debated, the
Stanford University Medical Center Com
mittee on Ethics published a report called
'The Ethical Use of Human Fetal Tissue in
Medicine" in the April 20,1989 issue of the


Andrew Martinez-Fonts â€” Daily
New England Journal of Medicine.
The statement approves the use
of human fetal tissue from elective
abortions for research purposes,
subject to restrictions on financial
benefit and abortions specifically
for tissue donations.
The journal article states that
"conception should not be under
taken for a purpose other than
bearing children." However, the
pending NIH guidelines would
allow creation of in vitro embryos
for research purposes. If the Uni
versity were to accept NIH funding
for embiyo research, it would be
contradicting these previously
issued guidelines for the ethical use
of human tissue.
Donald Kennedy, president
when the journal report was pub
lished, explained that the report
was designed by a group of faculty.
"It is not University policy at all,"
he said. However, many prominent
faculty and administrators sup
ported it as a policy statement.
Timothy Jackson, religious

studies professor who disapproved
of the committee statement, sees
any NIH regulations allowing
embryo research as disturbing. "I
wouldn't deny that there may be
scientific good, but we have always
refused to make life an instrument
for scientific utility," he said. "Life
is what all science is moving
towards."
Despite the growing drive at the
federal and university levels in
favor of fetal and embiyo tissue
research, there are still dissenting
voices. Dr. William Landau, head of
the Department of Neurobiology at
Washington University, says there
is no evidence that fetal tissue
transplants will make a working
connection to patient brain tissues
in Parkinson's patients.
There is also the possibility that
other mammalian embryos, like
those from primates, might offer
substitutes for human embryos as
sources of medical research. How
ever, Dr. Johnson expressed the
difficulties of conducting IVF pro
cedures on primates. Besides,
"some primates are protected" he
said. The pending NIH guidelines
would deny humans the protection
already offered to primates.

when the journal report was pub
lished, explained that the report
was designed by a group of faculty.
"It is not University policy at all,"
he said. However, many prominent
faculty and administrators sup
ported it as a policy statement.
Timothy Jackson, religious

studies professor who disapproved
of the committee statement, sees
any NIH regulations allowing
embryo research as disturbing. "I
wouldn't deny that there may be
scientific good, but we have always
refused to make life an instrument
for scientific utility," he said. "Life
is what all science is moving
towards."
Despite the growing drive at the
federal and university levels in
favor of fetal and embiyo tissue
research, there are still dissenting
voices. Dr. William Landau, head of
the Department of Neurobiology at
Washington University, says there
is no evidence that fetal tissue
transplants will make a working
connection to patient brain tissues
in Parkinson's patients.
There is also the possibility that
other mammalian embryos, like
those from primates, might offer
substitutes for human embryos as
sources of medical research. How
ever, Dr. Johnson expressed the
difficulties of conducting IVF pro
cedures on primates. Besides,
"some primates are protected" he
said. The pending NIH guidelines
would deny humans the protection
already offered to primates.
In early December, the National Insti
tutes of Health (NIH) will reconsider poli
cies about human embryo research, open
ing the door for future federal funding of
this research at Stanford and research
institutions nationwide.
Historically, in 1988 the Department of
Health and Human Services (DHHS)
imposed a moratorium on federal funding
of research that transplants human fetal
tissue into human recipients.
Louis Sullivan, then DHHS secretary,
enacted the moratorium despite NIH rec
ommendations in favor of human fetal tis
sue transplantation research (HFTTR).
Prior to the 1988 ruling, in fiscal year
1987, the NIH awarded 11.2 million dol
lars in grants and contracts for human
fetal tissue experiments.
President Clinton removed the HFTTR
ban immediately upon taking office. The
administration has also approved research
on human embryos, opening the door for
NIH regulations that would allow for cre
ation and harvest of in vitro embryos. The
new rules would also allow experimenta
tion on pre-implantation embryos before
the 14th day of growth.
The pending rulings would broaden the
scope of permissible research to include
human embryos.
Dr. Irving Weissman, professor of
Pathology at the Stanford School of
Medicine, conducted fetal tissue research
under the 1988 DHHS moratorium. He
said the ban only prohibited use of fetal tis
sue for direct transplantation into patients
for therapy.
Although he no longer does fetal tissue
research, "we didn't stop research during
that time [the DHHS ban)," he said.
"Nothing we did was against the ban.
Some people interpreted the ban as
widespread, but it only prohibited implant
ing [fetal tissue] to patients," he added.
The medical community's interest in
human fetal tissue and more recently, in
human embryo cells, arises from the early
human cells' ability to proliferate, and
their decreased likelihood of being rejected
by the cell recipients.
The dubious morality of scientific

experimentation on living human embryos
generated in vitro makes this research a
subject of much debate.
Researchers are studying possible appli
cations in fetal tissue for treating Parkin
son's disease, muscular dystrophy, AIDS,
Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and for its
usefulness in organ transplants.
Embryonic experimentation is also
occuring to determine causes of reproduc
tive failure, infertility, and developmental
and birth defects.
According to Dr. Mark Johnson, assis
tant professor of Gynecology and Obstet
rics, researchers have done biopsies of
embryonic cells to understand human
reproductive biology. After the cell is
removed from the embryo, its genes can be
amplified or its chromosomes counted.
"As long as we know a gene for a specif
ic disease carried by the couple, then the
couple's pre-implantation embryos can be
screened for the gene during in vitro fertil
ization (IVF)," he said. "We can see which
embryos are normal and which are carriers
of the diseased gene." The normal embryos
can be selected for implantation.
This research is not currently conduct
ed at Stanford, but Johnson indicated that
there may be future plans here for experi
ments in this area.
The embryos carrying the disease, such
as cystic fibrosis, are not selected for
implantation. They must either die outside
the mother's body or, according to pending
NIH regulations, they could be subjected to
further experimentation.
Biopsy allows researchers to "take nor
mal human embryos that won't be used
[for implantation| and study their develop
ment as to how cells divide," Johnson said.
Johnson currently works with mouse
embryonic stem cells that make up the
inner cell mass of the blastocyst, which
gives rise to the embryo. He studies undif
ferentiated cells and cell growth, and his
work could be applicable to human
embryos under new NIII regulations.
Alan Krensky, professor of pediatrics, is
not involved in human embryo research.
However, he indicated that gene therapy, a
potential application of this research, may
be on the forefront of pediatric medicine.
"The potential to manipulate embryos
is quite astonishing," Krensky said. "The

biology is there. . .the science is easy. The
ethical issues tire hard."
The NIH panel for embryo research has
recommended regulations that will be
reviewed at a meeting of Director Harold
Varmus' advisory council on December 1
and 2.
The rules would allow NIH funding for
research on existing, 'unused' in-vitro
embryos up to the 14th or 18th day of
growth. The agency would allow human
embryos to be created in-vitro specifically
for research purposes. Pending regulations
also approve biopsy of embryo cells and the
creation of cell lines from embryos that are
a product of IVF.
In addition, the NIH panel is still con
sidering other ways of manipulating
human embryos. According to Weissman,
the new NIH guidelines have "opened the
possibility of transplantation of cells and
tissues to human patients for therapy."

This activity was banned under the Bush
administration.
The NIH regulations as recommended
by the human embryo panel are a cause for
moral and ethical concern, because they
permit creation of human embryos for
research purposes, and they allow experi
mentation on embryos that are a 'by-prod
uct' of IVF procedures. Human embryos
resulting from these processes either die or
iire subject to experimentation.
The opening of a field of embryo
research, coupled with the already existing
field of fetal tissue research, presents sev
eral difficult moral problems that are rec
ognized by scientists and ethicists alike.
The market for human fetal tissue for
medical purposes "could create financial
incentive {for abortion] that would be
unattractive to all of us," said Donald
Kennedy, professor of Biology and former
university president. Kennedy served as

Commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration from 1977-79.
Christopher Scott, Associate Director of
Beckman Center for Molecular and Genet
ic Medicine, sees the possibility of women
aborting for 'altruistic' reasons, for exam
ple, if they have a family member who may
benefit from fetal tissue.
Speaking of the pending NIH funding of
research that would create in vitro
embryos specifically for experimentation,
Scott said, "I have trouble with making a
factory for embryos."
Before the issue of human embryo
research emerged, but while the human
fetal tissue research was being debated, the
Stanford University Medical Center Com
mittee on Ethics published a report called
'The Ethical Use of Human Fetal Tissue in
Medicine" in the April 20,1989 issue of the


Andrew Martinez-Fonts â€” Daily
New England Journal of Medicine.
The statement approves the use
of human fetal tissue from elective
abortions for research purposes,
subject to restrictions on financial
benefit and abortions specifically
for tissue donations.
The journal article states that
"conception should not be under
taken for a purpose other than
bearing children." However, the
pending NIH guidelines would
allow creation of in vitro embryos
for research purposes. If the Uni
versity were to accept NIH funding
for embiyo research, it would be
contradicting these previously
issued guidelines for the ethical use
of human tissue.
Donald Kennedy, president

"It is not University policy at all,"
