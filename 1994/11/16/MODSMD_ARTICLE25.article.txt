# Knuckle-cracking causes annoyance, not arthritis

Q: "Will I get arthritis from
cracking my knuckles?"
—anonymous
A: Almost everybody has
heard this admonition at
one point in their lives.
But is it really true, or just a
vicious rumor circulated to take
away one of life's little plea
sures?
The sound your knuckles
make when they crack makes it
seem like you're doing some real
damage to your joints. However,
it's really not much different
from stretching other joints.
The region around any joint
is filled with a clear liquid

known as synovial
fluid. This acts as a
lubricant to keep the
joint running smooth
ly-
This fluid consists
of about 15 percent
carbon dioxide, dis
solved much like the
carbonation in a soda
can. As long as there is
the normal amount of
pressure in the joint,
the carbon dioxide
remains dissolved.
But then, you come
along and crack your
knuckles, even

though your grandmother told
you not to. This has the same
effect as opening your soda can.
You decrease the pressure on
the joint, and all the carbon
dioxide forms bubbles. Efferves
cent knuckles, I guess you could
say.
However, as soon as these
bubbles have formed, they col
lapse again. As they implode,
the fluid sloshes back against
itself. The sounds of all of these
bubbles popping at once makes
the loud crack.
The same effect causes a pot
of water to start hissing several
minutes before it begins to boil.
The water at the bottom of the
pot gets heated first, so it begins
to boil and form bubbles. How
ever, if the water above is not

hot enough, the bubbles simply
collapse again as they rise into
the colder water. The hissing is
just a continuous version of the
cracked knuckle.
So why can't you crack your
knuckles more than once? It
turns out that the bubbles don't
disappear completely when they
pop. A tiny bubble remains in its
place. If you continue to stretch
your joint, this bubble expands,
rather than new bubbles form
ing. It takes about 15 minutes
for the carbon dioxide in the lit
tle bubble to redissolve, so you
have a little time to wait until
you can get cracking again.
So, does it cause arthritis?
Nope. Arthritis is basically the
deterioration of the cartilage at
the joint. As this breaks down,

the joint doesn't run as
smoothly, and you get
pain and stiffness in
your knuckles.
Arthritis is usually
the result of an auto
immune disease, such
as rheumatoid arthri
tis. The disease occurs
when the body's own
defenses start attack
ing the cartilage in the
joints. Such diseases
are generally heredi
tary, so you're destined
to get arthritis whether
or not you crack your
knuckles.

Arthritis can also result from
excessive trauma to a joint,
like the stress caused in people
who do difficult work with their
hands. Cracking your knuckles,
however, does not qualify as
excessive trauma. In fact there's
basically no harm in cracking
your knuckles.
Cracking your back is similar
to cracking your knuckles. The
sound results from the same
type of bubbles popping, as well
as bones and ligaments sliding
across each other.
Cracking the back is a simple
form of chiropracty. Although it
is a bone of contention in the
medical community, many peo
ple claim that cracking the back


The Science
Bug
and other spinal manipulation
can help ease pain by stretch
ing out the muscles and liga
ments. As most people can
attest, it feels good in the short
term; the question is whether
patients derive any long term
benefit.
Of course, you have to be
careful when practicing self
chiropracty. Real back prob
lems like slipped disks can be
aggravated by applying this
extra stress. And common
sense tells you (I hope) that
putting lots of force on the
spinal cord could be a bad idea.
And if your grandmother
tells you you're going to get
arthritis, tell her it's heredi
tary. If you do develop the joint
disease, it's 25 percent her
fault.
