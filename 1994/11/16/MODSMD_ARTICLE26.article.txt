# Research funding tightens as Cold War thaws
## Universities, private industry must compensate for lost funds 
### Aly Remtulla 
Stanford's position as one of the nation's
largest research institutions means the uni
versity should be especially concerned that
federal research and development expendi
tures have decreased by seven percent since
1988.
Although net spending has increased,
investment research is not keeping pace with
the economy. According to Dr. George
Springer, Chair of the Aeronautics and
Astronautics Department, the decrease in
funding is due to "the climate in Washington
after the Cold War, where there have been
significant cutbacks to the defense budget."
The Stanford departments hardest hit by
the cutbacks are those in the hard sciences
and engineering, which are most closely
associated with defense technology. Individ
ual departments are feeling the federal cut
backs in different ways, depending on the
degree to which they rely on government
funding.
The Aeronautics and Astronautics
Department receives a large portion of its
funding from NASA, the National Science
Foundation (NSF), and the Department of
Defense (DOD). Springer is quick to point
out that a large portion of funding comes
from affiliate companies; these businesses
are part of a program where Springer's
department conducts research projects in
conjunction with 15-20 private companies.
Springer notes that there has been a big

shift towards non-government support over
the past few years, but an even bigger shift
towards consortium triangles — collabora
tive efforts between government, private
industry, and universities. "Government is
pushing technology transfer, and encourag
ing the defense industry to couple with uni
versities," Springer said.
Although the triangle consortium idea is
a practical one, there are controversial
issues involved with its implementation.
The issue of property rights causes problems
where funding has been provided by the pri
vate sector and skills and knowledge provid
ed by the university.
Stanford has a hard-nosed policy on the
issue of trying to keep control of all proper
ty rights, Springer admitted. This viewpoint
often handicaps the university, as some
companies are unwilling to invest in
research when they cannot own any result
ing patents.
The second issue is that the "government
wants us to be part of a three-legged stool,
where we contribute to the cost of the
research," Springer described.
As a private institution, it is difficult for
Stanford to contribute its own funding to
collaborative efforts. Here Springer sees
Stanford at a disadvantage compared to
state schools where state funding for the
school is much higher.
The current importance of large private
industry sponsors to the Aero/Astro Depart
ment contrasts with that of other depart

ments on campus. Dr. Vahe Petrosian,
chairman of the Astronomy Program,
explains that physics research is almost a
hundred percent government funded
through the same government departments
that fund most physical science research on
campus: NASA, NSF, and DOD.
Petrosian stressed that private industry
funding is minimal at present because non
governmental organizations do not have the
large amount of funds needed to do research
in this field.
The most significant contribution from
the private sector is to build optical tele
scopes. They are "traditionally private as one
can put a name on it, because it is a building
and not a spacecraft," Petrosian said. He
sites the Carnegie and Keck Foundations as
major non-governmental supporters.
Both Springer and Petrosian can feel the
effect of the cutbacks and see greater feder
al cutbacks in the future.
For example, "NASA has been downgrad
ing [funding] for a few years," Petrosian
said. Each year, there is a noticeable
decrease of a few million dollars.
Petrosian emphasizes that at Stanford
the effects could be significant in some
areas, while other departments may fare
better. "Even staying the same is bad,
because [Stanford] needs to increase fund
ing yearly," he said.
The problem is that although the actual
dollar value of funding increases, due to
inflation, the real purchasing power of the
funds is decreasing.
Petrosian notes that the effects of
decreased governmental support are
widespread. "We seem to spend more time
and money writing proposals to get fund
ing." He feel that it is a waste of time for the
department as well as the granting institu
tion. However, competition for scarce funds
is increasing. "We have concern about too
little returns on our proposals," he said.
Springer remembers the days when the
government would give large amounts of
money to Stanford with no strings attached,
except to write and present a few papers.
With the federal research and development
funds decreasing, the government can afford
to put more restrictions and limitations on
funding.
Both professors agree that the role of
industry will increase significantly in the
future as Stanford looks toward the private
sector to increase investment in research and
development. Springer notes that he does
not see a complete shift to private funding.
Most likely, a new balance will be reached
between government spending, and triangle
consortiums where research is carried out
with government and industry funding and
university knowledge. Springer describes
this as a situation where everyone wins.

chairman of the Astronomy Program,
explains that physics research is almost a
hundred percent government funded
through the same government departments
that fund most physical science research on
campus: NASA, NSF, and DOD.
Petrosian stressed that private industry
funding is minimal at present because non
governmental organizations do not have the
large amount of funds needed to do research
in this field.
The most significant contribution from
the private sector is to build optical tele
scopes. They are "traditionally private as one
can put a name on it, because it is a building
and not a spacecraft," Petrosian said. He
sites the Carnegie and Keck Foundations as
major non-governmental supporters.
Both Springer and Petrosian can feel the
effect of the cutbacks and see greater feder
al cutbacks in the future.
For example, "NASA has been downgrad
ing [funding] for a few years," Petrosian
said. Each year, there is a noticeable
decrease of a few million dollars.
Petrosian emphasizes that at Stanford
the effects could be significant in some
areas, while other departments may fare
better. "Even staying the same is bad,
because [Stanford] needs to increase fund
ing yearly," he said.
The problem is that although the actual
dollar value of funding increases, due to
inflation, the real purchasing power of the
funds is decreasing.
Petrosian notes that the effects of
decreased governmental support are
widespread. "We seem to spend more time
and money writing proposals to get fund
ing." He feel that it is a waste of time for the
department as well as the granting institu
tion. However, competition for scarce funds
is increasing. "We have concern about too
little returns on our proposals," he said.
Springer remembers the days when the
government would give large amounts of
money to Stanford with no strings attached,
except to write and present a few papers.
With the federal research and development
funds decreasing, the government can afford
to put more restrictions and limitations on
funding.
Both professors agree that the role of
industry will increase significantly in the
future as Stanford looks toward the private
sector to increase investment in research and
development. Springer notes that he does
not see a complete shift to private funding.
Most likely, a new balance will be reached
between government spending, and triangle
consortiums where research is carried out
with government and industry funding and
university knowledge. Springer describes
this as a situation where everyone wins.
