## Men's Basketball '94 Season Preview That time of year again Cardinal hoopsters have experience, youth and talent entering this highly-touted season 
### Daniel Kao Contributing writer 
With the scent of pigskin and roses fading away with
the waning days of autumn, it's time to shift the focus
from sacks and Hail Marys to slam dunks, three-point
bombs and, dare it be dreamt, March Madness.
While Rose Bowl dreams are buried six-feet under
until next fall, the hopes of an invitation to the big dance
— the NCAA tournament — after a two-year absence
are alive and kicking.
"The thing we want this year is to get to t he NCAA
tournament," said sophomore guard Brevin Knight.
Afler rebounding from a distressing 7-23 '92-'93 sea
son to go 17-11 last year, the Cardinal appears primed
and ready to land that coveted berth in college basket
ball's most prestigious tournament. The team rolled
through its first two exhibition game opponents, dis
mantling the Blue and Gold Fleet from Sim Francisco,
a team of ex-collegiate stars, 97-70 last Wednesday, and
the Cairns Marlins 98-87, an Australian professional
team, last night. With the preliminaries over, now the
real fun begins.
There is no doubt that the regular season, which
along with a grueling Pacific 10 Conference schedule
also includes NCAA-tournament caliber teams like Vir
ginia and Wisconsin, won't be a Cakewalk.
The Pac-10 is as strong as ever this year with peren
nial powerhouses Arizona and UCIA likely to vie for
conference bragging rights. Stanford may have a chance
to move up from Last season's fourth-place finish, but it
may be a feat in itself not to slip down.
"In the Pac-10, the problem that all the teams will
face is that everyone will be improved," head coach
Mike Montgomery said. "There's not a lot of room for
teams to move. The people at the top won't take major
steps backwards. We're a better basketball team, but
moving into the top three spots just will not be an
easy proposition, and the people b< >w will be nipping
at our heels. It's going to be a very competitive league
with a lot of talent."
Additionally, after last year's moderate success,
Stanford can't expect t< sn ak up on t "an\ <.pj >
nents. That means that certain weaknesses w ill need to
be addressed, like the question of depth and the lack of
a go-to guy.
"One of our biggest weaknesses is that we don't have
that player we can go to every time and know that we're
going to get points from him," Knight said. "We have a
team where everyone can score, but we don't have that
one dominant, scorer on the team."
Even with some question marks, the team still has
more exclamation marks including an electrifying,
dynamic backcourt, a hard-nosed, blue-collar frontline,
and young, new talent. The Cardinal lost just two play
ers to graduation and will return nine lettermen. This
translates into experience and chemistry. Add a dash of
some fun-loving energetic vigor, and watch out for a con
coction that is likely to make some noise in college bas
ketball this year.
"This team plays really well together," Knight said.
"We've had a lot of experiences together last vear with

Ups and downs. We understand where people need the
ball, what the other person's thinking, when they need
help and how. We maximize each other's abilities. We
also just have fun. That's a big thing. We want to be
loose on the court when playing."
Knight, honored as Pac-10 Freshman of the Year
last season, will be the point man again this year for the
Cardinal attack. At five-foot-10, Knight sparked the
Cardinal offense, leading the team with 5.4 assists a
game last ye*ir. He was also a playmaker on the defen
sive end of the court, giving opponents fits while racking
up an average of 2.8 steals a game, tops in the nation for
freshmen. While scoring a respectable 11.1 points a
game, Knight's field goal percentage was just 35.4. The
subpar shooting allowed opponents to back off of him
towards the end of last season, giving him the outside
shot, in hopes of negating his quickness and ability to
penetrate.
"I practiced a lot this summer on my outside shot,
shooting 200 to 300 jumpers a day," Knight said. "By
the end of the year, afler people found out what I could
do, they decided to back up and pack it in so I couldn't
drive. Not being able to make a jump shot hurt me a lot
and also hurt the team. By backing up, I wasn't able to
create things for other people. But I've shot a lot ofjump

league with a lot of talent.'

shots over the summer, and I feel really comfortable."
Knight's comfort has shown in the two exhibition
game victories this season. In the two games, Knight led
Stanford in scoring, 28 points versus the Blue and Gold
Fleet and 23 against Cairns, hitting 16-of-20 from the
field and two-for-two from three-point land. Not bad by
any standards.
Joining Knight in the starting backcourt will be last
season's leading scorer, long-distance threat Dion Cross
15.1 ppg). The six-foot-two junior guard hit 42.2 per
cent of his three pointers and shows little signs of slow
ing down this year. Against Cairns, Cross nailed four-of
nine from downtown.
"Dion Cross is an excellent shooter," Montgomery
said. "I like my chances with him. If anything, he's actu
ally increased his range."
The tandem of Cross and Knight will be a
major strength for Stanford this year provided
that both remain healthy. Cross has been both
ered with a knee injury, and Knight missed sev
eral practices due to a sprained ankle. Both are
back practicing, but having the two of them
remain injury-free will be one of the most impor
tant factors this year.
"We have key people that need to stay healthy this
year in order for us to be as good a team as we're capable
of," Montgomery said. "For example, the difference in
our basketball team with and without Brevin is signifi
cant. The pace is much slower without him. With him,

the pace picks up on fast breaks, getting the kill down
the floor, and creating high-percentage opportunities."
Seniors Warren Gravely and David Harbour
offer valuable depth and experience. Gravely will
likely spot Knight at point guard. The ever-versa
tile Harbour will probably ply his skills at guard
and small forward. Freshmen Kamba Tshionyi

and walk-ons David Bennion and Mark Thomp
son, both from local Palo Alto High School, pro
vide some new blood in the Cardinal back court.
