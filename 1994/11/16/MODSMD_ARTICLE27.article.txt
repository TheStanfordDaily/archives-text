## Men's Basketball '94 Season Preview That time of year again Cardinal hoopsters have experience, youth and talent entering this highly-touted season 
### Daniel Kao Contributing writer 
With the scent of pigskin and roses fading away with
the waning days of autumn, it's time to shift the focus
from sacks and Hail Marys to slam dunks, three-point
bombs and, dare it be dreamt, March Madness.
While Rose Bowl dreams are buried six-feet under
until next fall, the hopes of an invitation to the big dance
— the NCAA tournament — after a two-year absence
are alive and kicking.
"The thing we want this year is to get to t he NCAA
tournament," said sophomore guard Brevin Knight.
Afler rebounding from a distressing 7-23 '92-'93 sea
son to go 17-11 last year, the Cardinal appears primed
and ready to land that coveted berth in college basket
ball's most prestigious tournament. The team rolled
through its first two exhibition game opponents, dis
mantling the Blue and Gold Fleet from Sim Francisco,
a team of ex-collegiate stars, 97-70 last Wednesday, and
the Cairns Marlins 98-87, an Australian professional
team, last night. With the preliminaries over, now the
real fun begins.
There is no doubt that the regular season, which
along with a grueling Pacific 10 Conference schedule
also includes NCAA-tournament caliber teams like Vir
ginia and Wisconsin, won't be a Cakewalk.
The Pac-10 is as strong as ever this year with peren
nial powerhouses Arizona and UCIA likely to vie for
conference bragging rights. Stanford may have a chance
to move up from Last season's fourth-place finish, but it
may be a feat in itself not to slip down.
"In the Pac-10, the problem that all the teams will
face is that everyone will be improved," head coach
Mike Montgomery said. "There's not a lot of room for
teams to move. The people at the top won't take major
steps backwards. We're a better basketball team, but
moving into the top three spots just will not be an
easy proposition, and the people b< >w will be nipping
at our heels. It's going to be a very competitive league
with a lot of talent."
Additionally, after last year's moderate success,
Stanford can't expect t< sn ak up on t "an\ <.pj >
nents. That means that certain weaknesses w ill need to
be addressed, like the question of depth and the lack of
a go-to guy.
"One of our biggest weaknesses is that we don't have
that player we can go to every time and know that we're
going to get points from him," Knight said. "We have a
team where everyone can score, but we don't have that
one dominant, scorer on the team."
Even with some question marks, the team still has
more exclamation marks including an electrifying,
dynamic backcourt, a hard-nosed, blue-collar frontline,
and young, new talent. The Cardinal lost just two play
ers to graduation and will return nine lettermen. This
translates into experience and chemistry. Add a dash of
some fun-loving energetic vigor, and watch out for a con
coction that is likely to make some noise in college bas
ketball this year.
"This team plays really well together," Knight said.
"We've had a lot of experiences together last vear with

Ups and downs. We understand where people need the
ball, what the other person's thinking, when they need
help and how. We maximize each other's abilities. We
also just have fun. That's a big thing. We want to be
loose on the court when playing."
Knight, honored as Pac-10 Freshman of the Year
last season, will be the point man again this year for the
Cardinal attack. At five-foot-10, Knight sparked the
Cardinal offense, leading the team with 5.4 assists a
game last ye*ir. He was also a playmaker on the defen
sive end of the court, giving opponents fits while racking
up an average of 2.8 steals a game, tops in the nation for
freshmen. While scoring a respectable 11.1 points a
game, Knight's field goal percentage was just 35.4. The
subpar shooting allowed opponents to back off of him
towards the end of last season, giving him the outside
shot, in hopes of negating his quickness and ability to
penetrate.
"I practiced a lot this summer on my outside shot,
shooting 200 to 300 jumpers a day," Knight said. "By
the end of the year, afler people found out what I could
do, they decided to back up and pack it in so I couldn't
drive. Not being able to make a jump shot hurt me a lot
and also hurt the team. By backing up, I wasn't able to
create things for other people. But I've shot a lot ofjump

league with a lot of talent.'

shots over the summer, and I feel really comfortable."
Knight's comfort has shown in the two exhibition
game victories this season. In the two games, Knight led
Stanford in scoring, 28 points versus the Blue and Gold
Fleet and 23 against Cairns, hitting 16-of-20 from the
field and two-for-two from three-point land. Not bad by
any standards.
Joining Knight in the starting backcourt will be last
season's leading scorer, long-distance threat Dion Cross
15.1 ppg). The six-foot-two junior guard hit 42.2 per
cent of his three pointers and shows little signs of slow
ing down this year. Against Cairns, Cross nailed four-of
nine from downtown.
"Dion Cross is an excellent shooter," Montgomery
said. "I like my chances with him. If anything, he's actu
ally increased his range."
The tandem of Cross and Knight will be a
major strength for Stanford this year provided
that both remain healthy. Cross has been both
ered with a knee injury, and Knight missed sev
eral practices due to a sprained ankle. Both are
back practicing, but having the two of them
remain injury-free will be one of the most impor
tant factors this year.
"We have key people that need to stay healthy this
year in order for us to be as good a team as we're capable
of," Montgomery said. "For example, the difference in
our basketball team with and without Brevin is signifi
cant. The pace is much slower without him. With him,

the pace picks up on fast breaks, getting the kill down
the floor, and creating high-percentage opportunities."
Seniors Warren Gravely and David Harbour
offer valuable depth and experience. Gravely will
likely spot Knight at point guard. The ever-versa
tile Harbour will probably ply his skills at guard
and small forward. Freshmen Kamba Tshionyi

and walk-ons David Bennion and Mark Thomp
son, both from local Palo Alto High School, pro
vide some new blood in the Cardinal back court.

either guard position.
The front line welcomes the
return of Stanford's leading
rebounder from last season,
senior forward Andy Poppink (7.4
rebounds a game). After playing
power forward last season where
he averaged 12.4 points a game,
Poppink plans to switch over to
small forward where he will be
able to better utilize his bulk and

strength against smaller oppo
nents.
"I'm really excited about him,"
Montgomery said. "He's lifted
weights. He looks good. He's
strong. He gives us better size for
rebounding and maybe some
posting up as well to take advan
tage of some size mismatches. But
he's athletic enough as well to
play on the perimeter and get the
job done."
Poppink has been up to his old
ways again in the two early pre
season games, pulling down 10
boards in both. Against Cairns,
Poppink also showed some ofTen

sive power scoring 20 points off of
8-for-ll shooting from the field.
Junior Darren Allaway, sopho
more Rich Jackson, as well as
seniors Bart Lammersen and
Todd Manley will also bolster
Stanford's front court. Allaway
and Lammersen, two physical
grinders, will provide tough play
and solid rebounding around the
basket. Jackson and Manley, both
better players facing the hoop,
will work hard to give Stanford
some consistent production. But
this season, the big name
amongst the big men, in more
ways than one, is seven-foot-one

freshman center Tim Young.
"Tim is as talented a big man
as we've had in a long time,"
Montgomery said. "He has very
good hands, good feel and touch.
He makes a tremendous differ
ence in how we can play. He's
going to be a very good player
with some strength and experi
ence. He's got all the ingredients.
Everybody will be delighted by his
play."
Along with being the tallest
player ever to don a Cardinal jer
sey, Young, from Harbor High
School (Santa Cruz, Calif.), has
been rated as one of the top 50

112 reshmen ball players in the coun
try. He averaged 24.8 points and
11.7 rebounds a game his senior
year in high school and also com
peted as a member of the United
States Junior Team. As Young
soon found out though, the col
lege game is much different.
"At first, I was surprised at
how hard it was and how much
faster and stronger athletes are at
this level, as well as how much
longer workouts are," Young said.
"But I'm starting to get the hang
of it. There are some fundamen
tals that I need to learn and work
on.

So the stage has been set for
some excitement and winning.
"It'll be important to get some
people out there to watch us
play," Knight said. "It would help
us out a lot to know that we have
people there behind us."
But while a new start and a
new beginning is coming for the
Stanford faithful, there's one
thing that can be counted on no
matter what the season, no mat
ter what the sport. Young, despite
being a freshman, has already
learned it well and puts it best.
"I'm looking forward to play
ing Cal."

ball's most prestigious tournament. The team rolled
through its first two exhibition game opponents, dis
mantling the Blue and Gold Fleet from Sim Francisco,
a team of ex-collegiate stars, 97-70 last Wednesday, and
the Cairns Marlins 98-87, an Australian professional
team, last night. With the preliminaries over, now the
real fun begins.
There is no doubt that the regular season, which
along with a grueling Pacific 10 Conference schedule
also includes NCAA-tournament caliber teams like Vir
ginia and Wisconsin, won't be a Cakewalk.
The Pac-10 is as strong as ever this year with peren
nial powerhouses Arizona and UCIA likely to vie for
conference bragging rights. Stanford may have a chance
to move up from Last season's fourth-place finish, but it
may be a feat in itself not to slip down.
"In the Pac-10, the problem that all the teams will
face is that everyone will be improved," head coach
Mike Montgomery said. "There's not a lot of room for
teams to move. The people at the top won't take major
steps backwards. We're a better basketball team, but
moving into the top three spots just will not be an
easy proposition, and the people b< >w will be nipping
at our heels. It's going to be a very competitive league
with a lot of talent."
Additionally, after last year's moderate success,
Stanford can't expect t< sn ak up on t "an\ <.pj >
nents. That means that certain weaknesses w ill need to
be addressed, like the question of depth and the lack of
a go-to guy.
"One of our biggest weaknesses is that we don't have
that player we can go to every time and know that we're
going to get points from him," Knight said. "We have a
team where everyone can score, but we don't have that
one dominant, scorer on the team."
Even with some question marks, the team still has
more exclamation marks including an electrifying,
dynamic backcourt, a hard-nosed, blue-collar frontline,
and young, new talent. The Cardinal lost just two play
ers to graduation and will return nine lettermen. This
translates into experience and chemistry. Add a dash of
some fun-loving energetic vigor, and watch out for a con
coction that is likely to make some noise in college bas
ketball this year.
"This team plays really well together," Knight said.
"We've had a lot of experiences together last vear with

Ups and downs. We understand where people need the
ball, what the other person's thinking, when they need
help and how. We maximize each other's abilities. We
also just have fun. That's a big thing. We want to be
loose on the court when playing."
Knight, honored as Pac-10 Freshman of the Year
last season, will be the point man again this year for the
Cardinal attack. At five-foot-10, Knight sparked the
Cardinal offense, leading the team with 5.4 assists a
game last ye*ir. He was also a playmaker on the defen
sive end of the court, giving opponents fits while racking
up an average of 2.8 steals a game, tops in the nation for
freshmen. While scoring a respectable 11.1 points a
game, Knight's field goal percentage was just 35.4. The
subpar shooting allowed opponents to back off of him
towards the end of last season, giving him the outside
shot, in hopes of negating his quickness and ability to
penetrate.
"I practiced a lot this summer on my outside shot,
shooting 200 to 300 jumpers a day," Knight said. "By
the end of the year, afler people found out what I could
do, they decided to back up and pack it in so I couldn't
drive. Not being able to make a jump shot hurt me a lot
and also hurt the team. By backing up, I wasn't able to
create things for other people. But I've shot a lot ofjump

league with a lot of talent.'

shots over the summer, and I feel really comfortable."
Knight's comfort has shown in the two exhibition
game victories this season. In the two games, Knight led
Stanford in scoring, 28 points versus the Blue and Gold
Fleet and 23 against Cairns, hitting 16-of-20 from the
field and two-for-two from three-point land. Not bad by
any standards.
Joining Knight in the starting backcourt will be last
season's leading scorer, long-distance threat Dion Cross
15.1 ppg). The six-foot-two junior guard hit 42.2 per
cent of his three pointers and shows little signs of slow
ing down this year. Against Cairns, Cross nailed four-of
nine from downtown.
"Dion Cross is an excellent shooter," Montgomery
said. "I like my chances with him. If anything, he's actu
ally increased his range."
The tandem of Cross and Knight will be a
major strength for Stanford this year provided
that both remain healthy. Cross has been both
ered with a knee injury, and Knight missed sev
eral practices due to a sprained ankle. Both are
back practicing, but having the two of them
remain injury-free will be one of the most impor
tant factors this year.
"We have key people that need to stay healthy this
year in order for us to be as good a team as we're capable
of," Montgomery said. "For example, the difference in
our basketball team with and without Brevin is signifi
cant. The pace is much slower without him. With him,

the pace picks up on fast breaks, getting the kill down
the floor, and creating high-percentage opportunities."
Seniors Warren Gravely and David Harbour
offer valuable depth and experience. Gravely will
likely spot Knight at point guard. The ever-versa
tile Harbour will probably ply his skills at guard
and small forward. Freshmen Kamba Tshionyi

and walk-ons David Bennion and Mark Thomp
son, both from local Palo Alto High School, pro
vide some new blood in the Cardinal back court.

either guard position.
The front line welcomes the
return of Stanford's leading
rebounder from last season,
senior forward Andy Poppink (7.4
rebounds a game). After playing
power forward last season where
he averaged 12.4 points a game,
Poppink plans to switch over to
small forward where he will be
able to better utilize his bulk and

strength against smaller oppo
nents.
"I'm really excited about him,"
Montgomery said. "He's lifted
weights. He looks good. He's
strong. He gives us better size for
rebounding and maybe some
posting up as well to take advan
tage of some size mismatches. But
he's athletic enough as well to
play on the perimeter and get the
job done."
Poppink has been up to his old
ways again in the two early pre
season games, pulling down 10
boards in both. Against Cairns,
Poppink also showed some ofTen

sive power scoring 20 points off of
8-for-ll shooting from the field.
Junior Darren Allaway, sopho
more Rich Jackson, as well as
seniors Bart Lammersen and
Todd Manley will also bolster
Stanford's front court. Allaway
and Lammersen, two physical
grinders, will provide tough play
and solid rebounding around the
basket. Jackson and Manley, both
better players facing the hoop,
will work hard to give Stanford
some consistent production. But
this season, the big name
amongst the big men, in more
ways than one, is seven-foot-one

freshman center Tim Young.
"Tim is as talented a big man
as we've had in a long time,"
Montgomery said. "He has very
good hands, good feel and touch.
He makes a tremendous differ
ence in how we can play. He's
going to be a very good player
with some strength and experi
ence. He's got all the ingredients.
Everybody will be delighted by his
play."
Along with being the tallest
player ever to don a Cardinal jer
sey, Young, from Harbor High
School (Santa Cruz, Calif.), has
been rated as one of the top 50

112 reshmen ball players in the coun
try. He averaged 24.8 points and
11.7 rebounds a game his senior
year in high school and also com
peted as a member of the United
States Junior Team. As Young
soon found out though, the col
lege game is much different.
"At first, I was surprised at
how hard it was and how much
faster and stronger athletes are at
this level, as well as how much
longer workouts are," Young said.
"But I'm starting to get the hang
of it. There are some fundamen
tals that I need to learn and work
on.

So the stage has been set for
some excitement and winning.
"It'll be important to get some
people out there to watch us
play," Knight said. "It would help
us out a lot to know that we have
people there behind us."
But while a new start and a
new beginning is coming for the
Stanford faithful, there's one
thing that can be counted on no
matter what the season, no mat
ter what the sport. Young, despite
being a freshman, has already
learned it well and puts it best.
"I'm looking forward to play
ing Cal."
With the scent of pigskin and roses fading away with
the waning days of autumn, it's time to shift the focus
from sacks and Hail Marys to slam dunks, three-point
bombs and, dare it be dreamt, March Madness.
While Rose Bowl dreams are buried six-feet under
until next fall, the hopes of an invitation to the big dance
— the NCAA tournament — after a two-year absence
are alive and kicking.
"The thing we want this year is to get to t he NCAA
tournament," said sophomore guard Brevin Knight.
Afler rebounding from a distressing 7-23 '92-'93 sea
son to go 17-11 last year, the Cardinal appears primed
and ready to land that coveted berth in college basket
ball's most prestigious tournament. The team rolled

to move up from Last season's fourth-place finish, but it
may be a feat in itself not to slip down.
"In the Pac-10, the problem that all the teams will
face is that everyone will be improved," head coach
Mike Montgomery said. "There's not a lot of room for
teams to move. The people at the top won't take major
steps backwards. We're a better basketball team, but
moving into the top three spots just will not be an
easy proposition, and the people b< >w will be nipping
at our heels. It's going to be a very competitive league
with a lot of talent."
Additionally, after last year's moderate success,
Stanford can't expect t< sn ak up on t "an\ <.pj >
nents. That means that certain weaknesses w ill need to
be addressed, like the question of depth and the lack of
a go-to guy.
"One of our biggest weaknesses is that we don't have
that player we can go to every time and know that we're
going to get points from him," Knight said. "We have a
team where everyone can score, but we don't have that
one dominant, scorer on the team."
Even with some question marks, the team still has
more exclamation marks including an electrifying,
dynamic backcourt, a hard-nosed, blue-collar frontline,
and young, new talent. The Cardinal lost just two play
ers to graduation and will return nine lettermen. This
translates into experience and chemistry. Add a dash of
some fun-loving energetic vigor, and watch out for a con
coction that is likely to make some noise in college bas
ketball this year.
"This team plays really well together," Knight said.
"We've had a lot of experiences together last vear with

Ups and downs. We understand where people need the
ball, what the other person's thinking, when they need
help and how. We maximize each other's abilities. We
also just have fun. That's a big thing. We want to be
loose on the court when playing."
Knight, honored as Pac-10 Freshman of the Year
last season, will be the point man again this year for the
Cardinal attack. At five-foot-10, Knight sparked the
Cardinal offense, leading the team with 5.4 assists a
game last ye*ir. He was also a playmaker on the defen
sive end of the court, giving opponents fits while racking
up an average of 2.8 steals a game, tops in the nation for
freshmen. While scoring a respectable 11.1 points a
game, Knight's field goal percentage was just 35.4. The
subpar shooting allowed opponents to back off of him
towards the end of last season, giving him the outside
shot, in hopes of negating his quickness and ability to
penetrate.
"I practiced a lot this summer on my outside shot,
shooting 200 to 300 jumpers a day," Knight said. "By
the end of the year, afler people found out what I could
do, they decided to back up and pack it in so I couldn't
drive. Not being able to make a jump shot hurt me a lot
and also hurt the team. By backing up, I wasn't able to
create things for other people. But I've shot a lot ofjump

shots over the summer, and I feel really comfortable."
Knight's comfort has shown in the two exhibition
game victories this season. In the two games, Knight led
Stanford in scoring, 28 points versus the Blue and Gold
Fleet and 23 against Cairns, hitting 16-of-20 from the
field and two-for-two from three-point land. Not bad by
any standards.
Joining Knight in the starting backcourt will be last
season's leading scorer, long-distance threat Dion Cross
15.1 ppg). The six-foot-two junior guard hit 42.2 per
cent of his three pointers and shows little signs of slow
ing down this year. Against Cairns, Cross nailed four-of
nine from downtown.
"Dion Cross is an excellent shooter," Montgomery
said. "I like my chances with him. If anything, he's actu
ally increased his range."
The tandem of Cross and Knight will be a
major strength for Stanford this year provided
that both remain healthy. Cross has been both
ered with a knee injury, and Knight missed sev
eral practices due to a sprained ankle. Both are
back practicing, but having the two of them
remain injury-free will be one of the most impor
tant factors this year.
"We have key people that need to stay healthy this
year in order for us to be as good a team as we're capable
of," Montgomery said. "For example, the difference in
our basketball team with and without Brevin is signifi
cant. The pace is much slower without him. With him,

the pace picks up on fast breaks, getting the kill down
the floor, and creating high-percentage opportunities."
Seniors Warren Gravely and David Harbour
offer valuable depth and experience. Gravely will
likely spot Knight at point guard. The ever-versa
tile Harbour will probably ply his skills at guard
and small forward. Freshmen Kamba Tshionyi

either guard position.
The front line welcomes the
return of Stanford's leading
rebounder from last season,
senior forward Andy Poppink (7.4
rebounds a game). After playing
power forward last season where
he averaged 12.4 points a game,
Poppink plans to switch over to
small forward where he will be
able to better utilize his bulk and

strength against smaller oppo
nents.
"I'm really excited about him,"
Montgomery said. "He's lifted
weights. He looks good. He's
strong. He gives us better size for
rebounding and maybe some
posting up as well to take advan
tage of some size mismatches. But
he's athletic enough as well to
play on the perimeter and get the
job done."
Poppink has been up to his old
ways again in the two early pre
season games, pulling down 10
boards in both. Against Cairns,
Poppink also showed some ofTen

sive power scoring 20 points off of
8-for-ll shooting from the field.
Junior Darren Allaway, sopho
more Rich Jackson, as well as
seniors Bart Lammersen and
Todd Manley will also bolster
Stanford's front court. Allaway
and Lammersen, two physical
grinders, will provide tough play
and solid rebounding around the
basket. Jackson and Manley, both
better players facing the hoop,
will work hard to give Stanford
some consistent production. But
this season, the big name
amongst the big men, in more
ways than one, is seven-foot-one

freshman center Tim Young.
"Tim is as talented a big man
as we've had in a long time,"
Montgomery said. "He has very
good hands, good feel and touch.
He makes a tremendous differ
ence in how we can play. He's
going to be a very good player
with some strength and experi
ence. He's got all the ingredients.
Everybody will be delighted by his
play."
Along with being the tallest
player ever to don a Cardinal jer
sey, Young, from Harbor High
School (Santa Cruz, Calif.), has
been rated as one of the top 50

112 reshmen ball players in the coun
try. He averaged 24.8 points and
11.7 rebounds a game his senior
year in high school and also com
peted as a member of the United
States Junior Team. As Young
soon found out though, the col
lege game is much different.
"At first, I was surprised at
how hard it was and how much
faster and stronger athletes are at
this level, as well as how much
longer workouts are," Young said.
"But I'm starting to get the hang
of it. There are some fundamen
tals that I need to learn and work
on.

So the stage has been set for
some excitement and winning.
"It'll be important to get some
people out there to watch us
play," Knight said. "It would help
us out a lot to know that we have
people there behind us."
But while a new start and a
new beginning is coming for the
Stanford faithful, there's one
thing that can be counted on no
matter what the season, no mat
ter what the sport. Young, despite
being a freshman, has already
learned it well and puts it best.
"I'm looking forward to play
ing Cal."
