The Cardinal women rowers reaped the benefits of their grueling
early-morning workouts as they beat out 21 other California teams
to win the women's varsity 8 three-mile race at the Newport
Autumn Rowing Regatta this weekend. The team clinched first
place by 32 seconds, an impressive finish as most races are decided
by mere seconds. Clocking a final time of 18 minutes, 29 seconds in
the event, held on the Pacific in Newport Beach, the crew now holds
the valuable distinction of being the fastest in the state. The victo
ry was especially sweet since last year's victors, Cal, finished only
eighth. Coxed by Missy Keyes, the squad consists of Kara Johnson
(stroke), Cara Rice, Sue Becker, Maria Johnson, Bess Kennedy,
Julie Lewczyk, Jen Brown and Vanja Stenius (bow).

The Cardinal men's tennis team had its most impressive outing to
date this past weekend at the 49th Rolex NorCal Intercollegiate
Tennis Champsionships, capturing its 22nd singles title and 26th
doubles championship. Junior team captain Jeff Salzenstein
fought tenaciously to come away with a much-deserved first-place
singles win at Stanford Tennis Stadium on Monday. Top-seeded
Salzenstein battled for two-and-a-half hours against freshman
Cardinal teammate Scott Humphries to take the final win, 4-6, 6-
3, 7-6 (7-5). This victory automatically qualifies Salzenstein for
the Rolex Championships in Dallas, held in The Cardi
