## Profs say it's too early to know if recent Republican election gains indicate a ideological shift by voters 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Contributing writer 
Despite the recent shift of con
gressional power to the Republi
cans, the long-term effects of the
1994 elections remain unclear,
concluded Communication Prof.
Steven Chaffee and Political Sci
ence Prof. Luis Fraga in a panel
at the Law School yesterday.
The panel discussion, spon
sored by the ASSU Speakers' Bu
reau, addressed the recent Re
publican gain of both houses of
Congress, which has spurred
many political pundits across the
country to forecast a new age of
Republican dominance.
But Chaffee said that in the

long run these particular elec
toral results may not be that im
portant and that the election cer
tainly was not a "watershed" like
the elections of 1932 or 1980.
These sorts of results can look
deceptively dramatic, he added.
"This always happens in mid
term elections," Chaffee said.
"The party that did better last
time does worse."
Fraga said the impact of the
Republican victory wouldn't be
clear until the next election. He
thought, however, that there was
a definite shift in the voting pat
terns of white voters.
"White voters found the Re
publicans more attractive rela
tive to the Democrats than ever

before," Fraga said. "It was not
just in the South, but in the Mid
west, the West, and even the
Northeast."
Despite this shift of voters,
Chaffee did not believe that all
chances for a Clinton re-election
were gone. He pointed out that
"at this time last year, Pete Wil
son was down" and at this time
during Bush's term, "he looked
golden."
"Clinton has yet to run a cam
paign and face an opponent,"
Chaffee said. "Last time he ran a
good campaign and it carried him
over rocky things. We also don't
know what the conditions will
be," he said.
He added, however, that he
"wouldn't bet a lot of money on
Clinton."
Both Fraga and Chaffee pre
dicted that party conventions
would be a decisive factor in the
1996 elections.
Clinton's chances would be
greatly improved if there was a
split at the Republican national
convention, Fraga said.
A split in either party could
prove fatal, but may be
inevitable, Chaffee said. "We
have yet to see which party will
bite its own hand, but one will,"
he added.
Republicans could also make
mistakes similar to the ones
made by Clinton early in his
term, when he focused on issues
— such as gays in the military —
other than those he campaigned
on, Chaffee said.
"The Republican say that
they are going to get through an
amendment on school prayer,
but that's not what they won
on," he said. "School prayer
could be for the Republicans
what gays in the military was for
Clinton," he added.

Both also agreed that the
Republican triumph had little to
do with Republican candidates'
stances on major issues such as
crime and the economy.
Chaffee noted that while
"crime is decreasing and the
economy is improving," the
Republicans still posted a huge
victory.
Instead, voters were lashing
out against Democratic incum
bents, Fraga said.
He rejected a purely anti-gov
ernment feeling among voters,
pointing out that many Republi
can incumbents retained their
seats.
Voters' perceptions were also
important in determining the
outcome, Fraga said. "The media
was used by the candidates to
portray a [false] image of the
economy, crime and immigra
tion," he said.
This problem was intensified
by the media's bias toward nega
tive coverage of events and by
the "propensity of the public to
try to find simple answers," he
added.
Economics Prof, ivi.chael
Boskin, former member of the
Council of Economic Advisers
under President Bush, was also
slated to appear on the panel,
but had to cancel because of a
bad back.
