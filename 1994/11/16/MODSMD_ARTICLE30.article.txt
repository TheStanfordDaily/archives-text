# Men's and women's tennis rule the Rolex Invitationals
## Blesynski wins singles title in Cardinal upset 
### Courtney Mann Contributing writer 
Stanford women's tennis will have substantial
representation at the Rolex Championships this
February in Dallas following freshman Ania
Bleszynski's upset capture of the singles title in the
Rolex Northwest Region Women's Tennis Champi
onships held at St. Mary's College last weekend.
The Cardinal will also send the doubles team of
All-American sophomore Katie Schlukebir and
senior Kim Shasby to Texas as they finished the
doubles competition in the runners-up position.
Wildcard spots for the February tournament are
also available to others who displayed superiority
within last weekend's brackets.
Bleszynski, the No. 8 seed overall in the singles
draw, knocked off the No. 2 seed, California's Jen
nifer Poulos, in the finals to take the title. The
women played through the first set on serve and
took it to a tie-breaker. "| Poulos] won the first point
of the tie-break. At that point, I just got more fired
up," Bleszynski said. The increased level of intensi
ty and a stingy defense propelled her to a 7-1 tie
break victory.
Despite a first-set victory, Bleszynski remained
wary of Poulos. "I knew she was a fighter. She start
ed playing much better in the second set, so I had to
concentrate on playing up to that level as well," said
the freshman.
The set continued on serve until 2-2 when
Bleszynski broke. However, Poulos was able to
break right back due primarily to two untimely dou
ble faults by the freshman. Bleszynski shook that
misfortune off quickly by winning Poulos's serve
again, and then went on to capture the remainder of
the games and the title in a 6-3 victory.
Bleszynski remains modest of her championship
despite her superior performance. "Going in, I
didn't expect this at all," she said. "I saw a lot of big
names out there, so I just tried to take one match at
a time. As a freshman and an underdog, I really felt
that the pressure was on my opponents' shoulders,
especially in the last two matches."
"I was not very surprised at her success, but very
pleased," said head coach Frank Brennan. "Ania's
not a great practice player, so it was nice to see her
perform under pressure. She goes out there and gets
it done."
The freshman from Thousand Oaks, Calif.,
received entry to the finals by means of a 6-4, 6-1
upending of the No. 3-seed Pam Nelson of Califor
nia. Bleszynski bowled over her four previous oppo
nents, playing the minimum eight sets in four
matches. In fact, no opponent including Poulos and
Nelson took the freshman to three sets.
Stanford also sent Schlukebir, the No. 4 seed, to
the semi-finals of the singles bracket where she met
a tough 6-4,6-7 (7-5), 7-5 defeat at the hands of Pou

los. Schlukebir toyed with her previous opponents,
losing no more than four games in any given set.
Shasby reached the quarterfinals after three sound
victories but met elimination head on 7-6, 4-6, 6-3 at
the hands of Poulos.
Stanford freshman Julie Scott also played solid
tennis on her way to the quarterfinals where fellow
teammate Bleszynski waited. "It was real nice to see
the new girls play," Brennan said. "I thought Julie
played real well, and she lost to a teammate [whose
name] always gets an asterisk next to it."
The third round spelled danger for the remainder
of the Stanford squad as senior Amy Chiminello ran
into none other than Stanford-killer Poulos.
Chiminello dominated the first two rounds however,
falling in only two of 26 total games. Cal's Keirsten
Alley upset Stanford's Sandra DeSilva, the tourna
ment's No. 6 seed, 6-3, 6-1.
California's Nelson disposed of Stanford's Wendy
Sacks also in the third round. Sacks had played
extremely well previously however, losing only three
