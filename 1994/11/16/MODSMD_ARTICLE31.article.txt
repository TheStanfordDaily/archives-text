# Men dominate in all-Stanford finals
## 
### Courtney Mann Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's tennis
team turned the Rolex and Nor-
Cal Men's Intercollegiate Tennis
Invitational into its own personal
Tournament of Champions this
weekend at California, capturing
the singles, doubles and honorary
team championships. The all-
Stanford finals in both singles and
doubles exemplified the Cardi
nal's complete dominance.
Junior team captain Jeff
Salzenstein defeated freshman
teammate Scott Humphries in a
grueling two-and-a-half-hour set
that ended in a 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5)
victory for Salzenstein.
Humphries and fellow freshman
Paul Goldstein put away their
junior mentors Jim Thomas and
Ricky Becker in straight sets 7-6
(7-4), 6-2 to take the doubles
crown and their first collegiate
championship.
Stanford's honorary team
championship marked the sev
enth consecutive showing of such
prominence, increasing its tour
nament leading title total to 28.
The other titles also bumped up
the singles title total to 22 and the
doubles to 26.
Based on their placements in
this competition, the singles team
of Salzenstein and Humphries
and the duos of Humphries/Gold
stein and Becker/Thomas qualify
for the Rolex Championships,
which will be held in Dallas, Texas
in February. The Cardinal may
possibly send additional players
based on wild card births issued at
a later date.
Despite a friendly atmosphere
at Stanford Tennis Stadium for
the finals (moved for conve
nience), the championship match
es were played with much intensi
ty. Humphries took the first set in
the singles final that stayed close
throughout.
"We held our own serves, but it
really seemed like he had control,"
Salzenstein said. After a 4-4 tie in
that set, Humphries held serve
and then broke for the set.
Salzenstein then jumped out to
a quick 3-0 lead in the second set

as the momentum began to shift
to the other side of the court.
Humphries battled back but fell
short as Salzenstein capitalized
the early advantage to win and
seize the set 6-3.
The top-seeded junior held
onto the momentum until 5-3 in
the third and deciding set when
Humphries stepped up to break
serve and win two consecutive
games. The set eventually went
into a title deciding tie-breaker
which saw the players trading off
points until 5-5 in the break when
Salzenstein won two consecutive
points and the title.
"This final is indicative of the
caliber of tennis these guys play,"
said head coach Dick Gould.
Salzenstein rolled over his
opponents in order to reach the
final. He played the minimum two

sets in every match, allowing his
opponents a stingy total of 23 vic
torious games in over five match
es. A championship in such a his
torically prestigious tournament
gave Salzenstein additional plea
sure. "It's really exciting to win a
tournament with such great
names from the past including my
coach [assistant coach John
WhitlingerJ," said the team cap
tain.
Humphries cruised through his
opponents on the way to Salzen
stein, also playing the minimum
number of sets. The freshman dis
posed of Michael Hill, the only
non-Stanford player to advance to
the semi-finals, by a decisive score
of 6-1, 6-4.
The Cardinal's other singles
competitors might have advanced
further were it not for the domi
nant play of their championship
teammates. Goldstein bulldozed

opponents from St. Mary's Col
lege, University of the Pacific,
University of Washington and
California before meeting Salzen
stein (6-4, 6-2) in the semi finals.
Goldstein did not lose more than
three games in any of his previous
sets.
When Becker reached the
quarterfinals, Humphries oust
ed the junior from the competi
tion. However, Becker played at
the top of his game throughout
the first four rounds, upsetting
the No. 5 seed and the Huskies'
top player Ornello Arlati 6-4, 3-
6, 7-5. "It was real good to see
Ricky beat a No. 1 player with a
solid national ranking," Gould
said.
Thomas as well advanced all
the way to the quarterfinals,
breezing in straight sets until
meeting Hill and his defeat 4-6, 6-
3, 6-3. Stanford freshman Charles
Hoeveler also lost to Hill in the
third round after defeating Larry
Ollin of the University of Santa
Clara and John Devorss of the
University of Oregon in the first
two rounds.
Junior Grant Elliot advanced
to the fourth round for Stanford,
only losing at most three games in
each set. Cal's Casey Louie, a No.
7 seed, inched past Elliot by a
score of 7-5, 7-6 (7-6). Also adding
to Stanford's impressive creden
tials was freshman Misha Pale
cek, who advanced to the third
round before losing a tough match
to Washington's Nick Williams 6-
3, 7-5, 6-4.
Gould saw great things from
the squad in the singles draw. "I
think we had a real good tourna
ment," he said. "Misha, Jim and
Grant ran into some tough match
es in those later rounds. If there
were any disappointments, it was
that they could have gotten to
play some more sets."
Doubles brought no less suc
cess for the Cardinal. The all-
Stanford final featured tough,
intense teamwork in which
Humphries and Goldstein eventu
ally came out on top. The talented
freshman duo jumped out quickly
to a 4-1 lead in the first set.
Becker and Thomas then
seized the momentum and bat
tled back to a 5-5 tie. The set
entered a tie-breaker at 6-6 in
which youth prevailed by a
score of 7-4.
In the second set, both teams
held serve throughout the first
four games, leading to a 2-2 tie.
Humphries and Goldstein then
took over, breaking and holding
serve twice each to win four
consecutive games, the match,
and the title 7-6 (7-4), 6-2.
"In the second set, we got
much more aggressive, coming
up to the net and being very
deliberate with our volleys,"
Goldstein said. "They had us
playing their game in the first
set, hitting the ball around,
playing real long points. It was
a real good tie-break; it could
have gone either way."
Humphries added, "It felt
good to get that first one under
the belt. It gives us a good mea
sure of what we need to do to

win."
The tandem of Humphries
and Goldstein blazed past oppo
nents on its way to the title,
outscoring its opponents by a
total tally of 37-18 in four
rounds.
Becker and Thomas proved
their worth as well at the
expense of some tough oppo
nents on the path to Stanford
Tennis Stadium. They pulled
out an upset against the No. 2-
seeded team of Hill and Bobby
Mahal of California in a tie
break 9-8 (7-1).
Becker and Thomas also
defeated the third Stanford
doubles team to reach the
semis, Salzenstein and Elliot.
Becker and Thomas captured
that three set match 6-4, 1-6, 6-
1.
Stanford's fourth doubles
team, Hoeveler and Palecek,
advanced 8-5 over their first
round opponents John Devorss
and Delbert Riodll of the Uni
versity of Oregon, only to meet
an 8-3 elimination at the hands
of Sacramento State's Alek
sander Filep and Damon Coupe.
The results of the doubles
draw secured and boosted

Gould's confidence with the
doubles aspect of this year's
squad.
"One of the biggest questions
coming in was how to get three
solid teams put together, and I
think Jim and Ricky showed us
we can do just that, which is
critical," the coach said.
Gould also believes that the
two juniors played with added
motivation.
"They didn't get to play last
year, and I think they thought
they deserved it," Gould said.
"It's a gigantic boost to us as a
team to see them playing good,
solid doubles."
At the very least, the Stan
ford squad upheld their presea
son No. 1 ranking, and gave
Cardinal tennis fans a taste of
what is to come.
"I'm real pleased with where
we're all at this fall," Salzen
stein said. Gould promises more
of the same.
"To get five guys in the quar
terfinals for singles and three
doubles teams in the semi
finals is a major accomplish
ment," said Gould. "They're
going to be a lot of fun to watch
this year."

breezing in straight sets until
meeting Hill and his defeat 4-6, 6-
3, 6-3. Stanford freshman Charles
Hoeveler also lost to Hill in the
third round after defeating Larry
Ollin of the University of Santa
Clara and John Devorss of the
University of Oregon in the first
two rounds.
Junior Grant Elliot advanced
to the fourth round for Stanford,
only losing at most three games in
each set. Cal's Casey Louie, a No.
7 seed, inched past Elliot by a
score of 7-5, 7-6 (7-6). Also adding
to Stanford's impressive creden
tials was freshman Misha Pale
cek, who advanced to the third
round before losing a tough match
to Washington's Nick Williams 6-
3, 7-5, 6-4.
Gould saw great things from
the squad in the singles draw. "I
think we had a real good tourna
ment," he said. "Misha, Jim and
Grant ran into some tough match
es in those later rounds. If there
were any disappointments, it was
that they could have gotten to
play some more sets."
Doubles brought no less suc
cess for the Cardinal. The all-
Stanford final featured tough,
intense teamwork in which
Humphries and Goldstein eventu
ally came out on top. The talented
freshman duo jumped out quickly
to a 4-1 lead in the first set.
Becker and Thomas then
seized the momentum and bat
tled back to a 5-5 tie. The set
entered a tie-breaker at 6-6 in
which youth prevailed by a
score of 7-4.
In the second set, both teams
held serve throughout the first
four games, leading to a 2-2 tie.
Humphries and Goldstein then
took over, breaking and holding
serve twice each to win four
consecutive games, the match,
and the title 7-6 (7-4), 6-2.
"In the second set, we got
much more aggressive, coming
up to the net and being very
deliberate with our volleys,"
Goldstein said. "They had us
playing their game in the first
set, hitting the ball around,
playing real long points. It was
a real good tie-break; it could
have gone either way."
Humphries added, "It felt
good to get that first one under
the belt. It gives us a good mea
sure of what we need to do to

win."
The tandem of Humphries
and Goldstein blazed past oppo
nents on its way to the title,
outscoring its opponents by a
total tally of 37-18 in four
rounds.
Becker and Thomas proved
their worth as well at the
expense of some tough oppo
nents on the path to Stanford
Tennis Stadium. They pulled
out an upset against the No. 2-
seeded team of Hill and Bobby
Mahal of California in a tie
break 9-8 (7-1).
Becker and Thomas also
defeated the third Stanford
doubles team to reach the
semis, Salzenstein and Elliot.
Becker and Thomas captured
that three set match 6-4, 1-6, 6-
1.
Stanford's fourth doubles
team, Hoeveler and Palecek,
advanced 8-5 over their first
round opponents John Devorss
and Delbert Riodll of the Uni
versity of Oregon, only to meet
an 8-3 elimination at the hands
of Sacramento State's Alek
sander Filep and Damon Coupe.
The results of the doubles
draw secured and boosted

Gould's confidence with the
doubles aspect of this year's
squad.
"One of the biggest questions
coming in was how to get three
solid teams put together, and I
think Jim and Ricky showed us
we can do just that, which is
critical," the coach said.
Gould also believes that the
two juniors played with added
motivation.
"They didn't get to play last
year, and I think they thought
they deserved it," Gould said.
"It's a gigantic boost to us as a
team to see them playing good,
solid doubles."
At the very least, the Stan
ford squad upheld their presea
son No. 1 ranking, and gave
Cardinal tennis fans a taste of
what is to come.
"I'm real pleased with where
we're all at this fall," Salzen
stein said. Gould promises more
of the same.
"To get five guys in the quar
terfinals for singles and three
doubles teams in the semi
finals is a major accomplish
ment," said Gould. "They're
going to be a lot of fun to watch
this year."
The Stanford men's tennis
team turned the Rolex and Nor-
Cal Men's Intercollegiate Tennis
Invitational into its own personal
Tournament of Champions this
weekend at California, capturing
the singles, doubles and honorary
team championships. The all-
Stanford finals in both singles and
doubles exemplified the Cardi
nal's complete dominance.
Junior team captain Jeff
Salzenstein defeated freshman
teammate Scott Humphries in a
grueling two-and-a-half-hour set
that ended in a 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5)
victory for Salzenstein.
Humphries and fellow freshman
Paul Goldstein put away their
junior mentors Jim Thomas and
Ricky Becker in straight sets 7-6
(7-4), 6-2 to take the doubles
crown and their first collegiate
championship.
Stanford's honorary team
championship marked the sev
enth consecutive showing of such
prominence, increasing its tour
nament leading title total to 28.
The other titles also bumped up
the singles title total to 22 and the
doubles to 26.
Based on their placements in
this competition, the singles team
of Salzenstein and Humphries
and the duos of Humphries/Gold
stein and Becker/Thomas qualify
for the Rolex Championships,
which will be held in Dallas, Texas
in February. The Cardinal may
possibly send additional players
based on wild card births issued at
a later date.
Despite a friendly atmosphere
at Stanford Tennis Stadium for
the finals (moved for conve
nience), the championship match
es were played with much intensi
ty. Humphries took the first set in
the singles final that stayed close
throughout.
"We held our own serves, but it
really seemed like he had control,"
Salzenstein said. After a 4-4 tie in
that set, Humphries held serve
and then broke for the set.
Salzenstein then jumped out to
a quick 3-0 lead in the second set

as the momentum began to shift
to the other side of the court.
Humphries battled back but fell
short as Salzenstein capitalized
the early advantage to win and
seize the set 6-3.
The top-seeded junior held
onto the momentum until 5-3 in
the third and deciding set when
Humphries stepped up to break
serve and win two consecutive
games. The set eventually went
into a title deciding tie-breaker
which saw the players trading off
points until 5-5 in the break when
Salzenstein won two consecutive
points and the title.
"This final is indicative of the
caliber of tennis these guys play,"
said head coach Dick Gould.
Salzenstein rolled over his
opponents in order to reach the
final. He played the minimum two

sets in every match, allowing his
opponents a stingy total of 23 vic
torious games in over five match
es. A championship in such a his
torically prestigious tournament
gave Salzenstein additional plea
sure. "It's really exciting to win a
tournament with such great
names from the past including my
coach [assistant coach John
WhitlingerJ," said the team cap
tain.
Humphries cruised through his
opponents on the way to Salzen
stein, also playing the minimum
number of sets. The freshman dis
posed of Michael Hill, the only
non-Stanford player to advance to
the semi-finals, by a decisive score
of 6-1, 6-4.
The Cardinal's other singles
competitors might have advanced
further were it not for the domi
nant play of their championship
teammates. Goldstein bulldozed

opponents from St. Mary's Col
lege, University of the Pacific,
University of Washington and
California before meeting Salzen
stein (6-4, 6-2) in the semi finals.
Goldstein did not lose more than
three games in any of his previous
sets.
When Becker reached the
quarterfinals, Humphries oust
ed the junior from the competi
tion. However, Becker played at
the top of his game throughout
the first four rounds, upsetting
the No. 5 seed and the Huskies'
top player Ornello Arlati 6-4, 3-
6, 7-5. "It was real good to see
Ricky beat a No. 1 player with a
solid national ranking," Gould
said.
Thomas as well advanced all
the way to the quarterfinals,
breezing in straight sets until
meeting Hill and his defeat 4-6, 6-
3, 6-3. Stanford freshman Charles
Hoeveler also lost to Hill in the
third round after defeating Larry
Ollin of the University of Santa
Clara and John Devorss of the
University of Oregon in the first
two rounds.
Junior Grant Elliot advanced
to the fourth round for Stanford,
only losing at most three games in
each set. Cal's Casey Louie, a No.

score of 7-5, 7-6 (7-6). Also adding
