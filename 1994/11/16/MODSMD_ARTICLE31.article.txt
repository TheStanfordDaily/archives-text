# Men dominate in all-Stanford finals
## 
### Courtney Mann Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's tennis
team turned the Rolex and Nor-
Cal Men's Intercollegiate Tennis
Invitational into its own personal
Tournament of Champions this
weekend at California, capturing
the singles, doubles and honorary
team championships. The all-
Stanford finals in both singles and
doubles exemplified the Cardi
nal's complete dominance.
Junior team captain Jeff
Salzenstein defeated freshman
teammate Scott Humphries in a
grueling two-and-a-half-hour set
that ended in a 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5)
victory for Salzenstein.
Humphries and fellow freshman
Paul Goldstein put away their
junior mentors Jim Thomas and
Ricky Becker in straight sets 7-6
(7-4), 6-2 to take the doubles
crown and their first collegiate
championship.
Stanford's honorary team
championship marked the sev
enth consecutive showing of such
prominence, increasing its tour
nament leading title total to 28.
The other titles also bumped up
the singles title total to 22 and the
doubles to 26.
Based on their placements in
this competition, the singles team
of Salzenstein and Humphries
and the duos of Humphries/Gold
stein and Becker/Thomas qualify
for the Rolex Championships,
which will be held in Dallas, Texas
in February. The Cardinal may
possibly send additional players
based on wild card births issued at
a later date.
Despite a friendly atmosphere
at Stanford Tennis Stadium for
the finals (moved for conve
nience), the championship match
es were played with much intensi
ty. Humphries took the first set in
the singles final that stayed close
throughout.
"We held our own serves, but it
really seemed like he had control,"
Salzenstein said. After a 4-4 tie in
that set, Humphries held serve
and then broke for the set.
Salzenstein then jumped out to
a quick 3-0 lead in the second set

as the momentum began to shift
to the other side of the court.
Humphries battled back but fell
short as Salzenstein capitalized
the early advantage to win and
seize the set 6-3.
The top-seeded junior held
onto the momentum until 5-3 in
the third and deciding set when
Humphries stepped up to break
serve and win two consecutive
games. The set eventually went
into a title deciding tie-breaker
which saw the players trading off
points until 5-5 in the break when
Salzenstein won two consecutive
points and the title.
"This final is indicative of the
caliber of tennis these guys play,"
said head coach Dick Gould.
Salzenstein rolled over his
opponents in order to reach the
final. He played the minimum two

sets in every match, allowing his
opponents a stingy total of 23 vic
torious games in over five match
es. A championship in such a his
torically prestigious tournament
gave Salzenstein additional plea
sure. "It's really exciting to win a
tournament with such great
names from the past including my
coach [assistant coach John
WhitlingerJ," said the team cap
tain.
Humphries cruised through his
opponents on the way to Salzen
stein, also playing the minimum
number of sets. The freshman dis
posed of Michael Hill, the only
non-Stanford player to advance to
the semi-finals, by a decisive score
of 6-1, 6-4.
The Cardinal's other singles
competitors might have advanced
further were it not for the domi
nant play of their championship
teammates. Goldstein bulldozed

opponents from St. Mary's Col
lege, University of the Pacific,
University of Washington and
California before meeting Salzen
stein (6-4, 6-2) in the semi finals.
Goldstein did not lose more than
three games in any of his previous
sets.
When Becker reached the
quarterfinals, Humphries oust
ed the junior from the competi
tion. However, Becker played at
the top of his game throughout
the first four rounds, upsetting
the No. 5 seed and the Huskies'
top player Ornello Arlati 6-4, 3-
6, 7-5. "It was real good to see
Ricky beat a No. 1 player with a
solid national ranking," Gould
said.
Thomas as well advanced all
the way to the quarterfinals,
breezing in straight sets until
meeting Hill and his defeat 4-6, 6-
3, 6-3. Stanford freshman Charles
Hoeveler also lost to Hill in the
third round after defeating Larry
Ollin of the University of Santa
Clara and John Devorss of the
University of Oregon in the first
two rounds.
Junior Grant Elliot advanced
to the fourth round for Stanford,
only losing at most three games in
each set. Cal's Casey Louie, a No.
7 seed, inched past Elliot by a
score of 7-5, 7-6 (7-6). Also adding
to Stanford's impressive creden
tials was freshman Misha Pale
cek, who advanced to the third
round before losing a tough match
to Washington's Nick Williams 6-
3, 7-5, 6-4.
Gould saw great things from
the squad in the singles draw. "I
think we had a real good tourna
ment," he said. "Misha, Jim and
Grant ran into some tough match
es in those later rounds. If there
were any disappointments, it was
that they could have gotten to
play some more sets."
Doubles brought no less suc
cess for the Cardinal. The all-
Stanford final featured tough,
intense teamwork in which
Humphries and Goldstein eventu
ally came out on top. The talented
freshman duo jumped out quickly
