# It's raining, it's pouring
## Lawns receive double water dose, but irrigation system could end drowning 
### Soumya V. Raman 
This past week, as it rained on campus, it
poured on campus lawns.
Stanford lawns received more than their fair
share of water as the sprinklers continued to
water the grounds despite heavy rainfall.
But a new centralized irrigation controller
that the University will test this summer may
be the solution to the water waste which the
current labor-intensive system creates.
"It takes 16 hours worth of labor to shut off
the sprinkler system," said Herb Fong, the
manager of Stanford's Grounds, Labor and
Contracts Division. "We don't have enough
man-power," he said, explaining why the sprin
klers kept working through the rain.
"The new system involves a significant
investment for the university," Fong said. "The
hope is that the long-term payback will be effec
tive."
Though he would not specify the exact cost
of the project, Fong said it will include the major
capital expense of new equipment and the phys
ical process of extensive wiring.
Centralized irrigation control systems offer
the possibility of controlling hundreds of acres
of irrigated ground from a single location. "The
new system will make adjustments on a daily
basis automatically," Fong said, "as it will be
tied up to a weather station."
The experiment will be restricted to about
one-eighth of campus — which includes the

Quad, Oval and White Plaza — where water use
has been metered.
The centralized irrigation controller will be
operational, as the first part of the experiment,
in the summer. The summer results will be
compared with water-use rates from last sum
mer to determine how effective the new system
is, before it is implemented throughout the
campus.
The existing system is not centralized and
the controls are dispersed in various buildings
throughout the campus. It takes approximately
32 hours for an irrigation expert to turn the sys
tem off and switch it back on again.
"We will also have our own weather station,"
Fong said, which will lead to savings on labor
costs, because the new system requires little
man-power to monitor.
Apart from making more effective use of the
labor, the new system has great potential for
water conservation, Fong said.
Currently, the irrigation system is shut off
during fall and winter and the flow of water is
kept constant in summer and spring — even
when it is not necessary.
But the new automated variation system has
the capacity to sense, and automatically replace,
any loss in the ground water level. This system
is already being used in Palo Alto and by many
agencies in San Jose.
According to the Stanford's Water depart
ment, Stanford uses one billion gallons of
domestic water from the Hetch Hetchy reser-

voir and 350 million gallons of lake water every
year.
The lake water is used exclusively for fire
hydrants and watering purposes. Because of
drought conditions and an increase in both the
population and the cost of water, there is a
greater need to conserve water, Fong said.
During the drought the grounds division
mainly supported the academic programs, ath
letic grounds and the play fields. Many received
absolutely no water during this time, which led
to a loss of landscape. "It takes decades to nur
ture them, and because they need water all year
round, we lose them in a season," he said.
The grounds department is trying to use
alternative means of re-landscaping and design
ing new landscapes that don't require too much
water. "We try to adopt the most water-con
serving means to water the plants," Fong said.
The new equipment has been installed in the
new Gates building, renovated sections of the
main quad, the new economics building and the
Green earth sciences building. The academic
area is irrigated by the lake water, which cannot
be used for any other purpose and is free except
for the cost of pumping it.
"Student housing is not yet scheduled for
this type of service," Fong said. However, it is
the domestic water that Stanford buys from the
Hetch Hetchy reservoir that is used to irrigate
dormitory areas and Escondido lawns, which
are approximately equal in area to the main
campus.
