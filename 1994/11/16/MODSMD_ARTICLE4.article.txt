# SHAC gives local homeless a voice
## 
### Nicole Harry Contributing writer 
With the help of the Stanford Homelessness Ac
tion Coalition, a student-run political advocacy
group, the homeless of Palo Alto now have a voice.
Local homeless residents recently had the chance
to express their concerns in the SHAC Sheet, the first
local grass-roots community newspaper to be written
primarily by low-income residents.
"Awareness really isn't the concern," said senior
Terry O'Day, lead director of SHAC. "More impor
tantly, the goal is to empower the homeless to speak
for themselves."
Nearly 85 percent of the articles were written by
homeless community members, while students con
tributed the remainder. The first edition of SHAC
Sheet marks the culmination of work done over the
summer, O'Day said.

SHAC financed the printing of the paper through
a $400 fellowship from the Haas Center for Public
Service and the Bay Area Homeless Program. During
last year's spring election, SHAC lost its special-fee
request; however, members of the organization are
looking toward other sources, such as grants and do
nations, to pay for the production of four papers this
year, O'Day said.
For its first edition, SHAC printed and distributed
1,100 copies of the SHAC Sheet to 20 homeless Palo
Alto residents at no charge, O'Day said. The home
less vendors then sold the papers on Veterans' Day
on Palo Alto street corners and were allowed to keep
all of the profits they earned, he added.
"The SHAC Sheet won't put enough money in the
pockets of the vendors to buy a condo," O'Day said,
adding, "it has other purposes." Among these are to
break down stereotypes and gen
erate a dialogue for permanent
solutions, he noted.
O'Day said the choice of Veter-

ans' Day for initial distribution
was symbolic because a large per
centage of Palo Alto's homeless
population are veterans.
As a political advocacy group,
SHAC petitioned successfully
last month for the inclusion of a
homeless person on the Palo
Alto Task Force. This active

involvement of the homeless is
one of the first steps towards
resolving the problem, O'Day
said.
A local homeless community
member said the opportunity to
voice concerns is important.
Larry Duncan, a homeless Palo
Alto resident involved in the

SHAC Sheet project, noted that
being able to speak out as an indi
vidual is one of the characteristics
that makes the SHAC Sheet so
unique.
"It comes directly from the
grass roots," Duncan said in a
statement. "It is not an ends in
itself, but an organizing tool."
