# Alumni-giving policy draws ASSU criticism
## Senate may launch protest against restrictions 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
Undergraduate senator Stephen Russell
exhorted the ASSU Senate last night to take
action to oppose the administration's Stan
ford Fund policy, which he said severely
limits the fundraising capabilities of stu
dent groups.
Russell's comments capped a meeting in
which the senate debated its own effective
ness in organizing buses for students to
take to and from Big Game. They also
passed bills opening the Axe Committee's
reserve funding to pay for the Big Game
Rally and splitting the Cardinal Collection
into two distinct ASSU businesses.
"When I first heard about [the Stanford
Fund]," Russell said, "I thought it might be
the most egregious assault on student
groups in the recent history of Stanford.
I'm now convinced it may be even worse."
The new policy, which took effect in Sep-

tember, is part of a move to
centralize the University's
fundraising efforts. The
Board of Trustees ap
proved the plan last year —
which will eventually end
all alumni solicitation by
student groups — in reac
tion to low levels of alumni
giving.
The Development Office

has said that the intent of the policy is to
minimize the number of letters and solicita
tions that go out to alumni.
But Russell warned that under the poli
cy, student groups will be limited to solicit
ing funds only from alumni who have do
nated within the past five years. Eventual
ly, he said, this list would diminish to noth
ing, because recent graduates would not be
on any group's list, and the base of older


Russell
alumni would dwindle away.
Noting that details of the plan
are still very unclear, Russell said
groups would be allocated their
funding by the University from
the unrestricted Stanford Fund.
Hence, those groups not in good
standing with the administration
— such as the Stanford Review —
might be in danger of having their
funding severely cut, he said.
"I don't think there's any issue
we ought to fight harder against,"
Russell told the senate, arguing
further that student groups
should be granted exemptions
from the fundraising restrictions
like the ones given to athletic and
health groups.
After the meeting, Russell said
that there are specific steps the
student government can take in
combating the University mea
sure. "Initially, the ASSU needs
to force clarification of the poli
cy," he said.
However, he added that if the
University is not amenable to any
degree of change, the students
can force the issue, Russell said.
"The ASSU could first and
foremost make itself a fundrais
ing umbrella," he said. "If the stu
dent groups need to be protected,
the ASSU may need to step in."
Russell said that the ASSU
could go so far as to violate the
University's policy as a test case
to find out whether or not it is
reasonable.
In addition, he said the ASSU
can organize protests. "Students

can not participate in [University]
activities like the sophomore
telethon until Stanford respects
the student groups," he said.
Russell said that there is
strong opposition within student
government to the giving policy.
"There's strong agreement in
both the COP and senate that this
is a top priority," he said.
In addition, the Bus Back the
Axe program, which was spon
sored and funded by the ASSU,
came under attack from senators
on two fronts. Some senators
were upset by the failure of orga
nizers to solicit any sponsorship
funding; they had counted on
$1,000 from sponsors, resulting a
loss on the project of between
$700-$ BOO.
Council of Presidents Member
Mork Murdock defended the
members of the senate who orga
nized the project.
"I think we made a few errors
in judgment in terms of trying to
get sponsorship," Murdock said.
"If we view it as a service project,
we basically were able to reach 90
percent of our budget."
Another bill passed by the sen
ate authorized the Axe Commit
tee to spend $1,975 of its $2,000
reserve fund in order to pay for
the Big Game Rally tomorrow
evening. The bill faced no opposi
tion.
Also, undergraduate senator
Ed Malone urged the senate to
revoke a bill passed two weeks ago
opposing Proposition 187 on the
basis that it violated the Senate's
Constitution. The motion died
when it gained no support from
any senators who had supported
the bill originally.
