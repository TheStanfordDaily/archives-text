# Alumni-giving policy draws ASSU criticism
## Senate may launch protest against restrictions 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
Undergraduate senator Stephen Russell
exhorted the ASSU Senate last night to take
action to oppose the administration's Stan
ford Fund policy, which he said severely
limits the fundraising capabilities of stu
dent groups.
Russell's comments capped a meeting in
which the senate debated its own effective
ness in organizing buses for students to
take to and from Big Game. They also
passed bills opening the Axe Committee's
reserve funding to pay for the Big Game
Rally and splitting the Cardinal Collection
into two distinct ASSU businesses.
"When I first heard about [the Stanford
Fund]," Russell said, "I thought it might be
the most egregious assault on student
groups in the recent history of Stanford.
I'm now convinced it may be even worse."
The new policy, which took effect in Sep-

tember, is part of a move to
centralize the University's
fundraising efforts. The
Board of Trustees ap
proved the plan last year —
which will eventually end
all alumni solicitation by
student groups — in reac
tion to low levels of alumni
giving.
The Development Office

has said that the intent of the policy is to
minimize the number of letters and solicita
tions that go out to alumni.
But Russell warned that under the poli
cy, student groups will be limited to solicit
ing funds only from alumni who have do
nated within the past five years. Eventual
ly, he said, this list would diminish to noth
ing, because recent graduates would not be
on any group's list, and the base of older
