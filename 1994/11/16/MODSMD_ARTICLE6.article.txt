# Asian-American Studies report almost complete
## 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
Students and faculty
covered a range of issues in
the second and last meet
ing yesterday between the
Asian-American Studies
committee and interested
community members, giv
ing the committee more to
consider in shaping its
final report.
Pertinent points

brought up by students included questions
of courses and curriculum, the possibility of
advanced degrees in Asian-American Stud
ies and student representation on future
committees.
The committee is nearing the home
stretch in fulfilling its objective of submit
ting a report on its recommendations for a
possible Asian-American Studies program.
Members hope to have the report to John
Shoven, Dean of the School of Humanities

and Sciences, by Thanksgiving or at least by
the end of November.
Political Science Prof. Daniel Okimoto,
the committee chair, said the meeting
proved to be "constructive and useful," and
accomplished its purpose of getting further
feedback from students.
Some of the questions raised — such as
how new Asian-American Studies professors
might be funded — were beyond the purview
of the committee, Okimoto said, as the com
mittee is serving merely in an advisory ca
pacity for a specific purpose.
The committee, which was formed last
spring in reaction to student protest, views
student input as a valuable component in its
deliberations, said law student Leslie
Hatamiya, a committee member.
"Personally, I think the committee has
done good work," said History Prof. Gordon
Chang, a committee member, "and I'm con
fident that Dean Shoven will consider our
recommendation seriously."
Okimoto added that some of the issues


Chang
discussed at the meeting are ones
the committee has and will contin
ue to address. The committee will
meet at least two more times
before reaching "full closure" and
transferring ideas to written form.
The committee's search for
input has expanded far beyond the
two meetings with students, hav

ing met with Asian-American fac
ulty and alumni, as well as several
departments, including African-
American Studies and American
Studies.
Several committee members
engaged in extensive research this
summer, which involved surveying
Asian-American Studies programs
at universities across the country.
As a result, the committee is
now examining a plethora of possi
ble options for Asian-American
Studies programs, drawing from

existing models at other schools.
The possibilities range from an
Asian-American Studies major
and /or minor to an interdisci
plinary approach, Okimoto said.
Ultimately, however, the com
mittee is looking for what will
work best at Stanford, Hatamiya
said. The committee has studied
older programs while taking into
consideration the changes in
Asian-American history and
demographics today, she added.
The committee's jurisdiction is

limited to the report's contents, she
said. If anything else is to emerge
from the process, it is Shoven who
would decide to pursue further
action and create more committees
to explore areas such as tenure, bil
lets and faculty recruiting.
In general, though, committee
members feel their work will not
be regarded lightly.
"We've thoroughly explored a
lot of options and how to imple
ment them," said junior Jerry
Chen, a committee member.
