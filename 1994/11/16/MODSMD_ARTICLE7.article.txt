# Chicken soup for the sniffles ...
## Peer educators dispense advice 
### Stephen L. Shih 
When sophomore Jimmy Boegle was a little kid
and he got sick, his mommy would wrap him up with
warm blankets and feed him piping hot bowls of
chicken soup, and little Jimmy would feel all better.
But for Jimmy, and for other students who have
— at one time or another — gotten the sniffles or
worse since leaving home, the days of soup and
smothering are over.
Students still have someone to turn to, however,
when they're feeling a bit under the weather: their
local Peer Health Educators.
True, PHEs — the foot soldiers of the new Peer
Health Education program — aren't mom or dad,
and they probably won't make you soup, but they
can help you get over a cold and advise you on a host

of other health-related issues, including mental and
emotional well-being, fitness and nutrition, sexual
health and drug and alcohol abuse.
And soon they'll be able to do one thing that you
would probably never see mom doing — hand out
condoms.
"We need to consider taking different approaches
[to health] at Stanford," said sophomore Angela
Amarillas, coordinator of the program and PHE for
Serra, "and maybe PHE is a way to do that."
Of course, the PHEs aren't doctors — although a
few of them may be someday as five of eight are plan
ning to major in human biology. Nor are they pro
fessional counselors.
Each one has, however, taken a health promotion
