# Chicken soup for the sniffles ...
## Peer educators dispense advice 
### Stephen L. Shih 
When sophomore Jimmy Boegle was a little kid
and he got sick, his mommy would wrap him up with
warm blankets and feed him piping hot bowls of
chicken soup, and little Jimmy would feel all better.
But for Jimmy, and for other students who have
— at one time or another — gotten the sniffles or
worse since leaving home, the days of soup and
smothering are over.
Students still have someone to turn to, however,
when they're feeling a bit under the weather: their
local Peer Health Educators.
True, PHEs — the foot soldiers of the new Peer
Health Education program — aren't mom or dad,
and they probably won't make you soup, but they
can help you get over a cold and advise you on a host

of other health-related issues, including mental and
emotional well-being, fitness and nutrition, sexual
health and drug and alcohol abuse.
And soon they'll be able to do one thing that you
would probably never see mom doing — hand out
condoms.
"We need to consider taking different approaches
[to health] at Stanford," said sophomore Angela
Amarillas, coordinator of the program and PHE for
Serra, "and maybe PHE is a way to do that."
Of course, the PHEs aren't doctors — although a
few of them may be someday as five of eight are plan
ning to major in human biology. Nor are they pro
fessional counselors.
Each one has, however, taken a health promotion

course and will soon have "tool kits"
containing information on topics
ranging from eating disorders to
safe sex. They will also have at their
disposal first-aid kits and supplies of
over-the-counter cold medication,
vitamin C and, of course, condoms.
Perhaps most importantly, each
PHE will serve as "a liaison between
the residents and student health
services," said Carole Pertofsky,
director of the Health Promotion
Program at Cowell Student Health
Center.
Or, as Amarillas puts it, a PHE
can act as a "first stop" for students,
advising them on what to do or
where to go next. If a student feels
sick, her PHE could give her some
non-prescription medication or sug
gest she go to Cowell if symptoms
were serious.
If a student were depressed, his
PHE could offer emotional support

or advise him or her to go to the
Bridge.
"Students need someone to go
to," Amarillas said. "We're here to
guide them and help them make
good health decisions."
The PHEs — who currently
serve Florence Moore Hall, Naranja
in Lagunita Court, SchifT in the
Suites, Serra in Stern Hall, Toyon
Hall, and Cedro and Junipero in
Wilbur Hall — will cover a wide
range of health issues this year.
First, they will all be trained on
how to run a cold and allergy clinic
so that students with running noses
and sore throats will be able to go to
their PHE for non-prescription
treatment and diagnosis, a service
that has previously only been avail
able at Co well.
From there, Pertofsky empha
sizes that each PHE will have the
freedom to plan his or her own pro
grams based on timely issues.
Senior Athena Nicon, for
instance, held an informal discus
sion on nutrition for residents of
Naranja and is preparing a tentative

Nov. 30 program on stress manage
ment — just in time for Dead Week
Senior Fidencio Saldana is orga
nizing an exercise program for
Cedro and working with senior Ann
Terai, PI IE for Junipero, to produce
a series of informal newsletters that
will Ix? posted in bathroom stalls.
Senior Barbara Love has already
put out two "issues" of her stall
series for Toyon, the first dealing
with safe sex and the second with
getting over a cold.
According to Pertofsky, the idea
of a PHE program arose out of "a
need for someone with specialty
training" who could answer specific
health-related questions Resident
Assistants could not.
Training for the PHEs is ongoing
— before the end of the year, in
addition to instruction on operating
a cold clinic, the PHEs will learn
CPU, first-aid care and lessons
about healthy dining in the resi
dences.
Like any new organization, the
PHE program has a few kinks to
work out. First and foremost —

PHE visibility. It may take a while
for students to get to know their
PHEs and to see them as resources,
especially for PHEs like Saldana
and Terai, who don't live in Wilbur.
Another challenge is integrating
PHEs — who are all upperclassmen
— into all-frosh dorms such as
Branner Hall.
Still, most representatives are
optimistic about the program's
future.
"People who otherwise wouldn't
take the time to go to Cowell and see
an official doctor or adult are com
ing to see me," she said. "It's work
ing out well."
And on a macroscopic scale, the
program isn't just about stopping a
runny nose or warning about the
dangers of drug abuse. Nicon hopes
the program as a whole will "put an
emphasis on health" in the daily
lives of students.
"It's going to be an exciting year
for Cowell and for the school in
terms of student health," Amarillas
agreed. "It's important for students
to come check it out."
