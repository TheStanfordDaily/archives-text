additional charges for driving
with a suspended license and
having open containers of

A second person faces addi
tional charges for possession of
a fraudulent driver's license.
The seven students — mem

foot long, 10-foot wide banner
which hung from the lower

how many, since the film
hasn't yet been developed."

Syers was booked, but has

Syers faces two felony
charges, one for possession of
