IRONICALLY, THE TIME TO START
SAVING FOR RETIREMENT IS WHEN IT LOOKS
LIKE YOU CAN LEAST AFFORD IT.
Can't afford to save for retirement?
The truth is, you can't afford not to.
Not when you realize that your retirement
can last 20 to 3oyears or more. You'll want
to live at least as comfortably then as you
do now. And that takes planning.
By starting to save now, you can take
advantage of tax-deferral and give your
money time to compound and grow.
Consider this: set aside just $100 each
month beginning at age So and you can
accumulate over $138,209* by the time
you reach age (>5. But wait ten years and
you'll have to budget $203 each month
to reach the same goal.
Even if you're not counting the years to
retirement, you can count on TIAA-CREF
to help you build the future you deserve -
with flexible retirement and tax-deferred
annuity plans, a diverse portfolio of invest
ment choices, and a record of personal
service that spans 7 5 years.
Over 1.5 million people in education and
research put TIAA-CREF at the top of
their list for retirement planning. Why not
join them?
Call today and learn how simple it is
to build a secure tomorrow when you
have time and TIAA-CREF working on
your side.
Start planning your future. Call our Enrollment Hotline 1 800 842-2888.
