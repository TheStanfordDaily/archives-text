# 'Smoke signals'
## Mascot incites protest 
### Pam Phan 
Hoping to prompt University
President Gerhard Casper into
taking action against The Stan
ford Review, a group of about 50
Native-American students
protested yesterday afternoon
in front of the Office of the Pres
ident and the Provost.
Expressing their outrage
over the use of an Indian logo by
The Review, students gathered
as many issues of the conserva
tive newspaper as they could
find, tore them up and dumped
them on the doorstep of
Casper's office.
"We are asking other ethnic
groups to also remove the Stan
ford Review from its racks,"
said Lawrence Tovar, a gradu
ate student in Linguistics. As a
member of the Comanche Indi
an tribe, he said he is offended
that "the different nations that
make up the indigenous people
of America have been grouped
together under one stereo
type."
The Review's Indian mascot
generates a false stereotype of
the Native American as some
one who carries a tomahawk
and wears grotesque facial ex
pressions, Tovar said. Ile added
