## Mascot incites protest

Hoping to prompt University
President Gerhard Casper into
taking action against The Stan
ford Review, a group of about 50
Native-American students
protested yesterday afternoon
in front of the Office of the Pres
ident and the Provost.
Expressing their outrage
over the use of an Indian logo by
The Review, students gathered
as many issues of the conserva
tive newspaper as they could
find, tore them up and dumped
them on the doorstep of
Casper's office.
"We are asking other ethnic
groups to also remove the Stan
ford Review from its racks,"
said Lawrence Tovar, a gradu
ate student in Linguistics. As a
member of the Comanche Indi
an tribe, he said he is offended
that "the different nations that
make up the indigenous people
of America have been grouped
together under one stereo
type."
The Review's Indian mascot
generates a false stereotype of
the Native American as some
one who carries a tomahawk
and wears grotesque facial ex
pressions, Tovar said. Ile added

In front of Casper's office yesterday afternoon, Lawrence Tovar, a graduate student
in linguistics, protested The Stanford Review's use of the Indian mascot.
that he feels it creates a "climate of
hostility" on campus.
"I don't feel like I am equal with
the other students as long as this
mascot is here," Tovar said.
"Everyone should be as offend
ed as if they were seeing a little
black Sambo or a sleepy-eyed char
acter in a sombrero," said Denni
Woodward, a Mescalero Indian
serving as assistant director of
Stanford's American Indian Pro
gram Office.
Woodward said she believes
members of the Stanford commu
nity are not treating this issue in
the same way they would treat it if
another ethnic group had been
involved. She added that since
Native Americans have always
been "subjected to being mascots,"
it is harder to overcome stereotypi
cal images.
Two weeks ago, the Stanford
Native American Graduate Stu
dents wrote a letter to Casper ask
ing him to address the issue, but
the president claimed that censor
ship of The Review is not within his
jurisdiction.
"We don't want him to censor
[it]," said Gil Ramirez, a graduate
student in Anthropology and a
member of the Yaqui tribe. "This
is not about free speech. ... It is
[Casper's] obligation to provide
moral leadership. These kind of
images have no place here."
Casper is the one person who
has the power to remove this offen
sive logo, Tovar said. He added that
he believes Casper is choosing not
to, however, because he fears a law

suit from The Review.
"I feel as though he's double
talking all the time," Tovar said.
Aman Verjee, The Review's
editor-in-chief, criticized the
protesters for going to Casper and
not confronting The Review
itself.
"They didn't come to us direct
ly," said Verjee. "They went to
Casper They shouldn't sidestep
me as Editor of The Stanford
Review."
He said that the best way for the
Native-American students to solve
this problem is to send a petition to
The Review and then sit down in
an open forum with its staff.
Verjee added that Casper can
only take away a newspaper's
"publishing rights ... and other
journalistic privileges." He said
Casper's position limits any fur
ther assistance he can give to
the Native-American community
regarding this issue.
Veijee said he fails to under
stand the Native American com
munity's argument. The protesters
view the logo as demeaning and
offensive, but never explain why,
he added.
"We never intended to offend
anyone," explained Verjee. "We
question your premises."
Members of Stanford's Native-
American community said they
intend to continue protesting until
the logo is eliminated from The
lie view.
Yesterday's protest was pre
ceded by a meeting held in El Cen
tro Chicano on politics and
racism. Members of several differ
ent ethnic communities came
together at the meeting to talk
about the issue of ethnic images
on campus.
