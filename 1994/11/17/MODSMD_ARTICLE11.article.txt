Warnings about asthma drug
WASHINGTON (AP) — Asthma sufferers
have been dying since a new drug hit the mar
ket in April, some apparently because they mis
takenly believed the long-lasting drug would
immediately relieve their breathing problems.
There have been 20 deaths reported to the
Food and Drug Administration among users of
Serevent. It is not yet clear how many are
linked to misuse of the drug, but manufacturer
Glaxo Inc. is warning patients and doctors to
use it properly.
Serevent is very effective at preventing asth
ma attacks and its effects last longer than other
drugs, experts agree. But it doesn't treat actual
asthma attacks — because it takes at least 30
minutes to begin working.

"It's very, very important that people under
stand Serevent is not for acute asthma,"
Ramona Jones of manufacturer Glaxo Inc. said
yesterday. Instead, she said, "It's so important
for people to have that short-acting bron
chodilator in case they get in trouble."
Military readiness questioned
WASHINGTON (AP) — Three Army tank
divisions whose assignments include reinforc
ing South Korea and the Persian Gulf are not
fully ready for combat, the first time in 12 years
the Army has been so rusty, officials said yes
terday.
The Army refused to disclose which divisions
were involved, saying the information was clas
sified.
