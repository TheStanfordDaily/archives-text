# Slow inflation growth reported
## Federal Reserve critics say interest rates increase unnecessary 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Con
sumer prices rose just 0.1 per
cent last month, the best infla
tion performance since spring,
the government reported only a
day after the Federal Reserve
raised interest rates to dampen
inflationary pressures.
Fed critics quickly seized on
yesterday's benign inflation
report — energy and clothing
prices actually fell — as proof
the central bank had needlessly
increased the threat of reces
sion by voting the biggest
increase in interest rates in 13
years.

"Inflation is not a threat,"
said Jerry Jasinowski, president
of the National Association of
Manufacturers and a leading
Fed critic. "The Federal
Reserve's aggressive increase in
interest rates yesterday was
unnecessary."
The central bank, making its
sixth and largest rate boost this
year, raised two key rates by
three-fourths of a percentage
point. Major banks followed
immediately, raising their
prime lending rate to 8.5 per
cent, meaning that borrowing
costs will go up for millions of

Americans.
Critics argue that the central
bank has failed to realize that
dramatic changes in the U.S.
economy, including increased
foreign competition, mean that
the economy can grow at faster
rates with lower unemployment
without raising inflation
threats.
"Yesterday's tightening looks
a bit risky based on the inflation
report," said Sung Won Sohn,
chief economist of Norwest
Corp. in Minneapolis. "We could
get a recession because the Fed
overreacted."
