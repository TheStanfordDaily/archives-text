UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
The U.N. Security Council yester
day called Iraq's recognition of
Kuwait "a significant step."
Diplomats said the gesture could
hasten the end of sanctions that
have crippled the Iraqi economy.
In a carefully-worded state
ment, the 15-member council said
it would closely monitor Iraq's
pledge last week to acknowledge
Kuwait's sovereignty and bor
ders.
"The Security Council wel
comes this development," said the
statement, reached after three
days of discussion. It was signed
by U.S. Ambassador Madeleine
Albright, the council's president.
Iraq's recognition of neighbor
ing Kuwait is a fundamental step
to lifting the oil embargo and
other economic sanctions
imposed after Iraq's Aug. 1990
invasion of Kuwait, New Zealand
Ambassador Colin Keating said
outside the council chamber.
He said the U.N. Commission

monitoring Iraq might report by
March that all U.N. requirements
had been met for lifting the sanc
tions.
Russian Ambassador Sergey
Lavrov added that "recognition of
Kuwait was considered by every
body as a crucial issue .. . Until
and unless Kuwait was recog
nized, it was evident that council
members would not reach consen
sus on moving on lifting the sanc
tions."
Iraq abandoned its longstand
ing territorial claims to Kuwait a
week ago, hoping to win an end to
the four-year-old sanctions that
have strangled its economy. The
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sparked
the 1991 Gulf War, in which a
U.S.-led force drove Iraq out of
the tiny emirate.
Diplomats noted, however,
that Iraq's change in policy came
only after Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein recently again ordered
thousands of troops toward the
Kuwaiti border.
