# Ireland's uncertainty
## Political crisis challenges peace process 
### 
DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) - The
Irish government, which helped
weave the complex peace process
in Northern Ireland, unravelled
yesterday over a judicial appoint
ment.
"Neither I nor any of my col
leagues can vote confidence in
this government," said deputy
prime minister Dick Spring,
head of the Labor Party,
announcing his immediate resig
nation along with the five other
ministers from the junior coali
tion party.
But Spring, who was also for
eign minister, said he was confi
dent the Northern Ireland peace
process could withstand the
Irish political crisis.
"I believe there is no leader in
this house who would not be
willing to carry on the work
started by the Taoiseach (Prime
Minister Albert Reynolds) in the
spirit in which he started that
work, if the necessity arose."
Reynolds was expected to seek
a national election following a
confidence vote scheduled for
tonight, which would leave him

without a majority, shorn of
Labor's support.
But President Mary Robinson
could give other parties the
chance to form a new govern
ment, rather than call an elec
tion.
Mrs. Robinson, visiting
Belfast yesterday, said the peace
process had wide support in the
south.
"There is not only support for
but appreciation of the impor
tance of the peace process that is
shared across the political spec
trum," she said.
Pearlier yesterday, Reynolds
had told Parliament he regretted
the controversial judicial
appointment that led to Labor's
walkout.
Reynolds said he had received
new information that Harry
Whelehan, a former attorney
general who was appointed pres
ident of the High Court, had
misled the Cabinet about an
extradition case. Had he known
last week, Reynolds said, he
would not have pressed ahead
with Whelehan's appointment.
