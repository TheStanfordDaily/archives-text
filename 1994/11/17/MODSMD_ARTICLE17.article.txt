## Speak to The Review 
### 
THE STANFORD REVIEW'S
use of the "Chief" caricature
in this year's volume has gen
erated the expected response —
claims of racism, prejudice and
immorality. Most of these com
plaints, however, have been misdi
rected.
Since late-October, representa
tives from the Stanford Native
American Graduate Students orga
nization have been attempting to
meet with President Casper to
demand that he block The Review's
use of the Indian. Similarly, during
the past few weeks The Daily has
received several letters arguing that
Casper should have the moral forti
tude to prevent The Review from
using the caricature.
By attempting to utilize channels
of authority rather than approach
ing The Review itself, concerned
individuals and groups are taking
the wrong approach.

As president, Casper's duty is not
to determine for students what is
right or wrong. A well-reasoned and
logical argument should not need
the signature of Stanford's presi
dent in order to carry weight.
If members of the Stanford com
munity have complaints with The
Review — which they evidently do
— they should first address those
problems to The Review itself.
In the midst of the debate regard
ing the Indian, The Review has only
received six letters of complaint,
according to Editor-in-Chief Aman
Verjee. Verjee has made it clear that
he would be happy to discuss the
issue in a public forum, in order to
confront and discuss his detractors'
arguments.
Concerned students should take
The Review up on this offer, and
voice their opinions to the people
involved rather than the authorities
above.
