# Saluting Stenstrom
## 
### 
JIM PLUNKETT AND John
El way. Two of the greatest
names ever to emerge from the
Stanford football program.
Add one more name to that list —
Steve Stenstrom.
With 41 starts in the cardinal
and-white, Stenstrom developed
into a Saturday afternoon mainstay,
a player who represented any hopes
fans held for a conference champi
onship, or even a chance to smell
the roses.
This season, Stenstrom proved
just why he deserves mention as one
of Stanford's most accomplished
quarterbacks ever. Calling the sig
nals for the team's first nine games,
Stenstrom distinguished himself as
one of the top passing quarterbacks
in collegiate football by toppling vir
tually every Cardinal and Pacific 10
Conference offensive record.
While a little-finger injury during
the Washington game two weeks
ago prematurely ended the All

American candidate's senior sea
son, Stenstrom's contributions to
the Stanford community will still be
felt even as he stands on the side
lines. Sharing his experiences as a
football player and as a student, he
is a member of Athletes in Action at
Stanford, a Christian ministry
through which athletes speak to
youth groups and high schools.
Encouraging kids to stay in school
and set high goals, Stenstrom is an
ideal role-model for the next gener
ation.
Characterizing Stenstrom as
"one of the classiest guys I've
known," wide receiver Justin
Armour described his teammate as
someone "leading in the right direc
tion, a positive one that builds oth
ers up that follow." For the past four
years, his teammates have followed
his lead on the football field. It's the
kids who he's taken the time to talk
to, however, who will remember his
inspiring example for years to come.
