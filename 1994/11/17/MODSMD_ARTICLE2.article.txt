# ASSU 187 act raises issues of jurisdiction
## Resolution's constitutionality disputed 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
Despite last week's passage of California
Proposition 187, the ASSU Senate bill
which encouraged students to vote against
the measure may not yet be a done deal.
While most senators defend senate bill SAI,
concerns over its constitutionality have
been mounting.
The debate has raised questions not only
about the bill's constitutionality, but also
about the administration's authority over
the ASSU and the ASSU's independence
from outside review.
Undergraduate senator Ed Malone filed
a complaint last Wednesday with Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole, requesting that

she "reconsider the congruence of this reso
lution vis & vis University policy and the
ASSU Constitution and nullify it if it fails
the appropriate tests."
Malone, a junior, was the chief dissenter
during the senate debate over the bill on
Nov. 1. He claims the bill, which passed 14-
4, is "a blatant assault on University policy
and the ASSU Constitution." Monday,
however, Malone requested that Cole for
ward the letter Dean of Students Michael
Jackson, who claims technically to have ju
risdiction over the ASSU.
In Tuesday night's senate meeting, Mal
one proposed a point of order to nullify the
bill on grounds of unconstitutionality. His
motion was struck down, howev
er, because only those voting for
a ratified bill can move for its
nullification.
At the ASSU level, the consti
tutional question revolves
around the paragraph which
states that "no ASSU governing
body, including the Senate or
Council of Presidents, shall exer
cise this right on matters not
directly affecting Stanford stu
dents."
The constitution defines a
matter as directly affecting Stan
ford students "only if there is at
least one Stanford student who is
affected by the matter in a sub
stantially different manner than
would be the case if he or she
were not a University student."
This portion was added to the
constitution through an amend
ment in 1990, following student
complaints that the senate was
focusing too much on outside
political issues and not enough
on University concerns. The sen
ate voted down the amendment
in debate, but authors Douglas
Bone and John Overdeck solicit
ed petitions and eventually won
the necessary two-thirds majori
ty in a student vote.
Constitutionality questions
Authors of the bill contend
that they strictly scrutinized the
constitution before presenting
the measure.
"We only passed a resolution
that was within constitutional
limits," said Deputy Senate
Chair Michael Choo, one of the
bill's six authors. "We didn't take
a stance on Prop. 187 as it affects
students generally. This is not a
quasi-Stanford issue. It's a direct
issue."
Choo said that the original
conception of the bill was uncon
stitutional, but that it was
altered to meet constitutional
requirements. "We whittled
down a resolution which origi
nally would not have passed con
stitutional scrutiny," he said.
"We only addressed it within
constitutional concerns."
The authors legitimized the
bill's constitutionality by citing
the potential loss of public health
care facilities to undocumented
or foreign Stanford students.

Currently, the only private facili
ty on campus is Cowell Health
Center.
Choo said Proposition 187 —
which is currently being chal
lenged in court — will cause pro
cedural delays for all students if
it is implemented, because they
must prove their legal status.
University President Gerhard
Casper said, however, that
Proposition 187 has few implica
tions on Stanford because it is a
private institution. Health care
concerns, Casper said, are "not a
University problem directly."
The problem would fall to Stan
ford Health Services, which is a
separate corporation, he said.
"We do not have undocument
ed students here," Casper said
emphatically. "Federal law
requires that we have foreign
students only if they have an
appropriate visa."
During senate debate, howev
er, no formal point of order was
made to appeal the bill's consti
tutionality, Choo said. Despite
Malone's objections, he did not
formally ask the chair to judge
the bill, Choo said.
Both proponents and oppo
nents of the bill have accused
their rivals of bringing their out
side political aims onto the sen
ate floor.
"We have political disagree
ments being phrased in constitu
tional disagreement," said Sen
ate Chair Nawwar Kasrawi.
Not so, said Bone. "I would be
just as opposed to SAI if it had
endorsed 187," he said. He
accused the proponents of "mak
ing a political statement on 187
with whatever rationale was nec
essary." He added that his
amendment was not intended to
legitimize a bill such as SAI.
Administrative authority
The legitimacy of Malone's
claim to the administration is
also unclear.
The ASSU is a part of Stu
dents Affairs and is thus subject
to University policy, Malone said.
In his letter, he cites IRS laws
and Stanford's Administrative
Guide, which prohibits attempts
"to influence legislation not
directly related to the education
al enterprise."
"It is my belief that all agen
cies of the University are subject
to this," Malone said. "This is a
non-profit organization, so all

agents should be subject to gov
ernment restriction."
The Administrative Guide,
however, states that the Regis
trar has jurisdiction to interpret
the Administrative Guide, not
the Office of Judicial Affairs.
Malone said Jackson told him
that the Judicial Affairs Office
had no jurisdiction over the
ASSU. Malone added that Jack
son said he had authority to
make a decision, which prompted
Malone to forward the letter.
Cole said yesterday that she has
no jurisdiction over ASSU
affairs.
Proponents of the bill claim no
one can exercise jurisdiction.
"We're a separate body," Choo
said. "The legal counsel for the
University is not the legal coun
sel for the ASSU."
"The ASSU is an independent
body," said Mork Murdock, a
member of the Council of Presi
dents. "We don't report to any of
them or are an agent to any of
them. [Malone] doesn't have a
clear understanding of what our
relationship with the administra
tion is."
Murdock said that although
the ASSU works closely with the
administration, the ASSU is not
governed by the University.
But Jackson said yesterday
that the University technically
does have authority over the
ASSU. The administration, how
ever, has never intervened in
ASSU affairs in the past and will
most likely not do so in this case,
he said.
"We try as much as possible to
let the ASSU govern its own
affairs," Jackson said. "I think
issues like this are more appro
priately dealt with on the senate
floor."
Jackson questioned students'
reasons for appealing to the
administration when they should
be discussing the issue in resi
dences as well as in government.
Registrar Roger Printup con
curred with Jackson, saying that
the issue did not "violate the
guide memo as we know it."
Printup, who is vested author
ity through the Administrative
Guide, said the ASSU is treated
as any student group, such as the
Stanford Republicans. "The
Guide is not intended to cut off
debate which goes on in the Uni
versity community," he said.
"We don't want to do anything to
make Stanford seem stifling."

Reviewing the senate
Another argument bill
authors use to discount adminis
trative intervention stems from
the section in the ASSU constitu
tion which states that "the sen
ate shall have the power to inter
pret [the] Constitution and the
bylaws of the association," essen
tially allowing the ASSU to act as
both a judicial and a legislative
branch.
For Malone, this clause justi
fies University intervention to
prevent a possibly renegade
ASSU.
"There is no judicial review in
the ASSU Senate," Malone said.
"The ASSU Senate is subject to
University policies. They are an
agent of Student Affairs. I
believe the administration
should take responsibility for the
ASSU Senate overstepping its
bounds."
He said he is considering
launching a constitutional
amendment to establish a judi
cial review within the ASSU Sen
ate.
"It is problematic that one
branch of government deter
mines its own actions," Choo
said. "But until a better alterna
tive is proposed and ratified, the
policy should remain in the
ASSU Senate."
Many senators agree that
there has not been any accept
able alternative. "I haven't seen
yet a proposal that would insti
tute checks and balances," Kas
rawi said. "The senate is the
most open body that's avail
able."
Senators raised concerns over
who should get the judicial
authority and the lengths of
terms. "It would end up being
administrators," said COP mem
ber Vanessa Alvarado.
"I see it being detrimental in
the long run," Kasrawi said.
A judicial branch would not be
productive, Bone said. "It's odd.
[The lack of a judiciary] makes it
very hard to stop the senate from
doing illegal things," he said.
"I'm not convinced that a judicial
branch would change things.
There's still likely to be the same
thinking."
Casper said that regardless of
the outcome of upcoming deci
sions, the rules will now be more
defined for future debates.
"Sometimes we have to wait for
problems to come up to find out
what the rules are," he said.

stitutional scrutiny," he said.
"We only addressed it within
constitutional concerns."
The authors legitimized the
bill's constitutionality by citing
the potential loss of public health
care facilities to undocumented
or foreign Stanford students.

Currently, the only private facili
ty on campus is Cowell Health
Center.
Choo said Proposition 187 —
which is currently being chal
lenged in court — will cause pro
cedural delays for all students if
it is implemented, because they
must prove their legal status.
University President Gerhard
Casper said, however, that
Proposition 187 has few implica
tions on Stanford because it is a
private institution. Health care
concerns, Casper said, are "not a
University problem directly."
The problem would fall to Stan
ford Health Services, which is a
separate corporation, he said.
"We do not have undocument
ed students here," Casper said
emphatically. "Federal law
requires that we have foreign
students only if they have an
appropriate visa."
During senate debate, howev
er, no formal point of order was
made to appeal the bill's consti
tutionality, Choo said. Despite
Malone's objections, he did not
formally ask the chair to judge
the bill, Choo said.
Both proponents and oppo
nents of the bill have accused
their rivals of bringing their out
side political aims onto the sen
ate floor.
"We have political disagree
ments being phrased in constitu
tional disagreement," said Sen
ate Chair Nawwar Kasrawi.
Not so, said Bone. "I would be
just as opposed to SAI if it had
endorsed 187," he said. He
accused the proponents of "mak
ing a political statement on 187
with whatever rationale was nec
essary." He added that his
amendment was not intended to
legitimize a bill such as SAI.
Administrative authority
The legitimacy of Malone's
claim to the administration is
also unclear.
The ASSU is a part of Stu
dents Affairs and is thus subject
to University policy, Malone said.
In his letter, he cites IRS laws
and Stanford's Administrative
Guide, which prohibits attempts
"to influence legislation not
directly related to the education
al enterprise."
"It is my belief that all agen
cies of the University are subject
to this," Malone said. "This is a
non-profit organization, so all

agents should be subject to gov
ernment restriction."
The Administrative Guide,
however, states that the Regis
trar has jurisdiction to interpret
the Administrative Guide, not
the Office of Judicial Affairs.
Malone said Jackson told him
that the Judicial Affairs Office
had no jurisdiction over the
ASSU. Malone added that Jack
son said he had authority to
make a decision, which prompted
Malone to forward the letter.
Cole said yesterday that she has
no jurisdiction over ASSU
affairs.
Proponents of the bill claim no
one can exercise jurisdiction.
"We're a separate body," Choo
said. "The legal counsel for the
University is not the legal coun
sel for the ASSU."
"The ASSU is an independent
body," said Mork Murdock, a
member of the Council of Presi
dents. "We don't report to any of
them or are an agent to any of
them. [Malone] doesn't have a
clear understanding of what our
relationship with the administra
tion is."
Murdock said that although
the ASSU works closely with the
administration, the ASSU is not
governed by the University.
But Jackson said yesterday
that the University technically
does have authority over the
ASSU. The administration, how
ever, has never intervened in
ASSU affairs in the past and will
most likely not do so in this case,
he said.
"We try as much as possible to
let the ASSU govern its own
affairs," Jackson said. "I think
issues like this are more appro
priately dealt with on the senate
floor."
Jackson questioned students'
reasons for appealing to the
administration when they should
be discussing the issue in resi
dences as well as in government.
Registrar Roger Printup con
curred with Jackson, saying that
the issue did not "violate the
guide memo as we know it."
Printup, who is vested author
ity through the Administrative
Guide, said the ASSU is treated
as any student group, such as the
Stanford Republicans. "The
Guide is not intended to cut off
debate which goes on in the Uni
versity community," he said.
"We don't want to do anything to
make Stanford seem stifling."

Reviewing the senate
Another argument bill
authors use to discount adminis
trative intervention stems from
the section in the ASSU constitu
tion which states that "the sen
ate shall have the power to inter
pret [the] Constitution and the
bylaws of the association," essen
tially allowing the ASSU to act as
both a judicial and a legislative
branch.
For Malone, this clause justi
fies University intervention to
prevent a possibly renegade
ASSU.
"There is no judicial review in
the ASSU Senate," Malone said.
"The ASSU Senate is subject to
University policies. They are an
agent of Student Affairs. I
believe the administration
should take responsibility for the
ASSU Senate overstepping its
bounds."
He said he is considering
launching a constitutional
amendment to establish a judi
cial review within the ASSU Sen
ate.
"It is problematic that one
branch of government deter
mines its own actions," Choo
said. "But until a better alterna
tive is proposed and ratified, the
policy should remain in the
ASSU Senate."
Many senators agree that
there has not been any accept
able alternative. "I haven't seen
yet a proposal that would insti
tute checks and balances," Kas
rawi said. "The senate is the
most open body that's avail
able."
Senators raised concerns over
who should get the judicial
authority and the lengths of
terms. "It would end up being
administrators," said COP mem
ber Vanessa Alvarado.
"I see it being detrimental in
the long run," Kasrawi said.
A judicial branch would not be
productive, Bone said. "It's odd.
[The lack of a judiciary] makes it
very hard to stop the senate from
doing illegal things," he said.
"I'm not convinced that a judicial
branch would change things.
There's still likely to be the same
thinking."
Casper said that regardless of
the outcome of upcoming deci
sions, the rules will now be more
defined for future debates.
"Sometimes we have to wait for
problems to come up to find out
what the rules are," he said.
Despite last week's passage of California
Proposition 187, the ASSU Senate bill
which encouraged students to vote against
the measure may not yet be a done deal.
While most senators defend senate bill SAI,
concerns over its constitutionality have
been mounting.
The debate has raised questions not only
about the bill's constitutionality, but also
about the administration's authority over
the ASSU and the ASSU's independence
from outside review.
Undergraduate senator Ed Malone filed
a complaint last Wednesday with Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole, requesting that

she "reconsider the congruence of this reso
lution vis & vis University policy and the
ASSU Constitution and nullify it if it fails
the appropriate tests."
Malone, a junior, was the chief dissenter
during the senate debate over the bill on
Nov. 1. He claims the bill, which passed 14-
4, is "a blatant assault on University policy
and the ASSU Constitution." Monday,
however, Malone requested that Cole for
ward the letter Dean of Students Michael
Jackson, who claims technically to have ju
risdiction over the ASSU.
In Tuesday night's senate meeting, Mal
one proposed a point of order to nullify the
bill on grounds of unconstitutionality. His
motion was struck down, howev
er, because only those voting for
a ratified bill can move for its
nullification.
At the ASSU level, the consti
tutional question revolves
around the paragraph which
states that "no ASSU governing
body, including the Senate or
Council of Presidents, shall exer
cise this right on matters not
directly affecting Stanford stu
dents."
The constitution defines a
matter as directly affecting Stan
ford students "only if there is at
least one Stanford student who is
affected by the matter in a sub
stantially different manner than
would be the case if he or she
were not a University student."
This portion was added to the
constitution through an amend
ment in 1990, following student
complaints that the senate was
focusing too much on outside
political issues and not enough
on University concerns. The sen
ate voted down the amendment
in debate, but authors Douglas
Bone and John Overdeck solicit
ed petitions and eventually won
the necessary two-thirds majori
ty in a student vote.
Constitutionality questions
Authors of the bill contend
that they strictly scrutinized the
constitution before presenting
the measure.
"We only passed a resolution
that was within constitutional
limits," said Deputy Senate
Chair Michael Choo, one of the
bill's six authors. "We didn't take
a stance on Prop. 187 as it affects
students generally. This is not a
quasi-Stanford issue. It's a direct
issue."
Choo said that the original
conception of the bill was uncon
stitutional, but that it was
altered to meet constitutional
requirements. "We whittled
down a resolution which origi
nally would not have passed con
stitutional scrutiny," he said.
"We only addressed it within
constitutional concerns."
The authors legitimized the
bill's constitutionality by citing
the potential loss of public health

University is not the legal coun
sel for the ASSU."
"The ASSU is an independent
body," said Mork Murdock, a
member of the Council of Presi
dents. "We don't report to any of
them or are an agent to any of
them. [Malone] doesn't have a
clear understanding of what our
relationship with the administra
tion is."
Murdock said that although
the ASSU works closely with the
administration, the ASSU is not
governed by the University.
But Jackson said yesterday
that the University technically
does have authority over the
ASSU. The administration, how
ever, has never intervened in
ASSU affairs in the past and will
most likely not do so in this case,
he said.
"We try as much as possible to
let the ASSU govern its own
affairs," Jackson said. "I think
issues like this are more appro
priately dealt with on the senate
floor."
Jackson questioned students'
reasons for appealing to the
administration when they should
be discussing the issue in resi
dences as well as in government.
Registrar Roger Printup con
curred with Jackson, saying that
the issue did not "violate the
guide memo as we know it."
Printup, who is vested author
ity through the Administrative
Guide, said the ASSU is treated
as any student group, such as the
Stanford Republicans. "The
Guide is not intended to cut off
debate which goes on in the Uni
versity community," he said.
"We don't want to do anything to
make Stanford seem stifling."

Reviewing the senate
Another argument bill
authors use to discount adminis
trative intervention stems from
the section in the ASSU constitu
tion which states that "the sen
ate shall have the power to inter
pret [the] Constitution and the
bylaws of the association," essen
tially allowing the ASSU to act as
both a judicial and a legislative
branch.
For Malone, this clause justi
fies University intervention to
prevent a possibly renegade
ASSU.
"There is no judicial review in
the ASSU Senate," Malone said.
"The ASSU Senate is subject to
University policies. They are an
agent of Student Affairs. I
believe the administration
should take responsibility for the
ASSU Senate overstepping its
bounds."
He said he is considering
launching a constitutional
amendment to establish a judi
cial review within the ASSU Sen
ate.
"It is problematic that one
branch of government deter
mines its own actions," Choo
said. "But until a better alterna
tive is proposed and ratified, the
policy should remain in the
ASSU Senate."
Many senators agree that
there has not been any accept
able alternative. "I haven't seen
yet a proposal that would insti
tute checks and balances," Kas
rawi said. "The senate is the
most open body that's avail
able."
Senators raised concerns over
who should get the judicial
authority and the lengths of
terms. "It would end up being
administrators," said COP mem
ber Vanessa Alvarado.
"I see it being detrimental in
the long run," Kasrawi said.
A judicial branch would not be
productive, Bone said. "It's odd.
[The lack of a judiciary] makes it
very hard to stop the senate from
doing illegal things," he said.
"I'm not convinced that a judicial
branch would change things.
There's still likely to be the same
thinking."
Casper said that regardless of
the outcome of upcoming deci
sions, the rules will now be more
defined for future debates.
"Sometimes we have to wait for
problems to come up to find out
what the rules are," he said.
