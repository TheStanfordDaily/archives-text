THE SEARCH FOR romantic com
panionship is meant to be a workout.
The problem is that generally the
one to be chased is in better shape than
you.
Prince/ss Charming has been running
eight miles a day while you've been on a
couch horking pints of cookie dough
watching the new Cindy Crawford tape.
And there's just so much more to it
than a tiresome pursuit, isn't there?
There's the outfit picking anguish, the
conversational nausea, the late-night calls
to friends begging a review of the pick-up
line just one more time. There's the detec
tive work of finding out where they live
and whether or not they are already
attached (there's only so much fingering
will tell you).
And then there's that small matter of
putting your ego on the chopping block and
handing some cute stranger a cleaver —
trusting their aim just because the corners
of their mouth make your toes curl in your
Chuck Taylors.
It's enough to make you give up the
whole mess and resign yourself to academ
ic hibernation.
No matter how excited we were at
autumn's onset, no matter what affirma
tions of tenacity we recited, we get so lost
on that road to relational salvation. And
we learn, yet again, that if it doesn't hap
pen in the first three weeks, it just doesn't
happen.
Here's how the cosine curve works:

You begin the quarter at y=l, a hyper
ready, super-saturated solution of estrogen
and/or testosterone; buff, tan and ready for
the schema busting antagonism of the
chase. The first couple of fall quarter days
you spend flirting in high gear, parting
your hair perfect each time and being as
cute and charming in life as you were on
your college essays.
This holds for about two weeks until the
first paper hits and your schedule won't
allow for anything but sweatshirts and
jeans and a half-assed attempt at eye con
tact from across the lecture hall. Any pur
suit potential drops deep into the subzero
range once midterms bleach all remnants
of the perky from your life.
Bored in class you fantasize about sleep,
not sex. Nap becomes, a more sultry word
than nook and you would gladly trade a
month's worth of orgasms for an extension
and a handful of Honey Nut Cheerios.
Once the work-hump is over (about
where we are now in the quarter) you —
pookie less — find yourself complacently
lazing in a passive groove; relying on finals
to build frustrations, working out to
relieve them, Seinfeld to make you laugh,
and crisis to break the trend.
Your datebook rules your life (funny
how those who use their datchooks so reli
giously never have any time to go out any
way) and thus theself-defeating/self-fulfill
ing prophecy of celibacy at Stanford is
propagated.
(There are two theories as to how that

awful Lno] dating myth began in the first
place. The first is that someone in the early
eighties started a rumor that heterosexual
love wasn't PC and that, besides, it cuts
into good programming time. The second
is that its really all a part of Zimbardo's
unauthorized comeback experiment in
mind-control. Either way it's a comfort
trap.)
But think for a sec — if "okay but not
great" isn't good enough for your problem
set, why should it be for your love life?
We Jill have wants. We all have libidos —
even those who revel in a self-inflicted, self
protective asexu»Jify. even if you
could shut down the main juice valve, it's
nearly impossible to turn off the cuddle
instincts (without religious backing).
So if you had the energy and the incli
nation to put on aftershave or eye liner at
the beginning of the quarter, find it again.
Be wide-eyed and eager. The quarter isn't
over yet; couples and copulation can hap
pen any time of the year.
Ask him out. Ask her out.
Ask them both out — just don't forget
what you said you wanted before your tan
faded.
