Story on use of embryonic tissue in research was biased

THE NOV. 16 article on the use of
embryonic tissue for biomedical
research was the worst article I have
ever read. I say this first because I am
writing an opinion, not a news article.
Apparently, the writer of the article
doesn't know the difference.
I always expect some slant to any news
article. However, I have never seen such a
blatant example of reporter bias as I did
when I read the article discussing the pos
sibility of the National Institutes of Health
changing its guidelines for research using
human embryos. The writer's clear pro
life stance and one-sided article made me
wonder how it ever got past the editor. I

only had to turn to the list of the Daily
stalT to realize that she just happens to be
the editor of the science section.
I won't dispute the scientific facts of the
article. I will say that the writer's grasp of
biomedical science does not seem particu
larly compelling. I won't dispute the
quotes. However, I have a feeling that they
may not have been used in the spirit that
they were given. I will comment on her
blatant failure to even try to report the
"news."
Not only does the writer use phrases
like "dubious morality" to describe the use
of embryonic tissue for research, but she
also conjures up images of massive genetic

engineering and eugenics. Perhaps most
telling is her statement, "(Embryos not
selected] must either die outside the moth
er's body or, according to pending NIH
regulations, they could be subjected to fur
ther experimentation." Using words like
"die" and "subjected to" when referring to
embryos is not, in my opinion, an example
of evenhanded reporting. While she does
interview some faculty in order to write an
"unbiased" article, it remains blatantly
obvious where she stands. Finally, at the
end of the article she implies that the NIH
is more concerned with the right of pri
mates than the rights of human beings.
The whole article, in fact, assumes that

the embryo is a human being and that its
rights are inviolate. I don't know if this is
true. Apparently she does.
I won't even try to touch on the moral
dilemma facing scientists trying to develop
guidelines. It's not a question which can
be answered easily in a few columns of
print. The writer of the article, however,
has no problem using The Daily as her
personal pulpit, writing an opinion piece
under the guise of a news article. I can
respect a person's opinions on embryo
research and abortion. However, an opin
ion is not news.
