# Review's contention that ASSU Speakers Bureau is biased was unfounded
## 
### 
In an article about "political partisan
ship infiltrating student organizations,"
The Stanford Review attacked the ASSU
Speakers Bureau and Stanford in Gov
ernment for inviting U.S. Rep. Anna
Eshoo to campus before the election, but
not inviting her opponent, Ben Brink.
This is not only a serious, unfounded
and malicious public attack on two orga
nizations based on non-partisanship; it
is also part of a broad, disturbing pat
tern of The Review's inability or unwill
ingness to deal with other campus enti
ties in a civil manner.
To begin with, Ben Brink did visit
Stanford twice earlier in the quarter,
through the Stanford Republicans and
Stanford in Government. For the
Bureau's part, in light of our limited
time and energy, we judged that inviting
Mr. Brink for a third campus appear
ance in one quarter made little sense.
Also, the Bureau invited all the other

major political candidates, regardless of
political affiliation: Feinstein, Huffing
ton, Brown and Wilson. In fact, the one
we worked hardest to bring was Huffing
ton, the Republican Senate candidate.
Finally, the fall speaker the Bureau
put the most time, effort, and money
into was John Sununu. The conspiracy
to bar conservative voices from campus
evidently sprung a Mem Aud-sized leak
that October evening.
The issue may be the "Chief' logo,
Stanford's oppressive speech code that
has never been enforced, or "biased"
campus groups that dare to invite the
incumbent congresswoman to speak
after her opponent has already been here
twice; The Review's predictable modus
operandi is to pick a fight, and then cite
the angry response as proof of the left
wing P.C. thought-police conspiracy.
At least Oliver Stone tells entertain
ing, original conspiracy theories. The
Review trots out tired, clichÂ£d parodies
of political paranoia, and tries to pass
them off as brave, Patrick Henry-esque
rebellions against unjust tyranny. So
long as we are dealing with fantasy, I'll
take the Mighty Morphin Power
Rangers over The Review.
