# Casper and UC-Berkeley chancellor urge friendly competition at Big Game
## 
### 
The Big Game is one of the great tra -
ditions in college athletics, matching two
preeminent institutions that share excel
lence in academics and athletics. The
game also provides the San Francisco
Bay Area with a unique venue to develop
camaraderie, kinship and relationships
among alumni and friends. The spirit of
Big Game should mirror the pursuit of
high academic standards, rich athletic
tradition, friendly rivalry and a history
of tolerance and civility on our respec
tive campuses.
We welcome you to enjoy the 1994
Big Game and celebrate the rich tradi
tion in the spirit of unity, friendship and
good sportsmanship.

President, Stanford University
