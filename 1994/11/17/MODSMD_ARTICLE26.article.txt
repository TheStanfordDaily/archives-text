## Forging success Seniors Anne "Hammer" Wicks and Denise "Anvil" Rotert form deadly duo 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
In the movie Forrest Gump, the
title character and his friend
Jenny went together like peas and
carrots.
This season, for the second
ranked Stanford women's volley
ball team, seniors Anne Wicks and
Denise Rotert have come together
in a similar manner. The squad
has used the pair like a hammer
and an anvil, flattening opponents
between the two.
It is a combination that has
become very familiar to those who
follow the team. Wicks, the ham
mer, provides a strong force at the
net, using her hitting and blocking
skills to pound her adversaries.
And after the 6-foot-2 middle
blocker rotates into the back row
and finishes with her serving
duties, more often than not, head
coach Don Shaw will replace her
with Rotert, the anvil.
The 5-foot-ll defensive special
ist excels at ball-control and pass
ing. Opposing hitters and servers
who attempt to chip away at the
Cardinal's game by attacking her
area of the court rarely achieve
their goals. After she has complet
ed her tour of duty in the back row,
Wicks returns once again to wreak
havoc in the front row, starting the
cycle anew.
"These two players give us a
great combination," said Shaw.
"The fact that we can use their
respective strengths in such a way

really helps the team."
The relationship between
Wicks and Rotert has also influ
enced how they see the action on
the court when one is on the floor
and the other is not. They are able
to look through their counter
part's eyes.
"It's sort of a bonding experi
ence," Rotert said. "I don't know if
I've ever passed a ball that she's
hit, but we're tied together in a dif
ferent way."
Shaw is quick to compliment
both women on their contributions
to the team's overall development
and strength.
"They've been great team play
ers," he said. "They have the right
attitude and they've done what it
takes to succeed."
Shaw also noted that despite
the way he has used the two as one
at times, Wicks and Rotert are
both individuals with their own
talents.
For example, there are few, if
any at all, who would consider
Wicks a role player. She represents
an integral part of the offense and
the centerpiece of the squad's
blocking scheme.
Her outstanding play at
Lakeville High School in.Lakeville,
Minn., garnered her Volleyball
Monthly's 1990 high school co-
Player of the Year award. Com
bined with her academic achieve
ments, such athletic prowess made
Wicks one of five finalists for the
Dial Award, given annually to the
