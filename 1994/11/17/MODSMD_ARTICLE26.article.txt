## Forging success Seniors Anne "Hammer" Wicks and Denise "Anvil" Rotert form deadly duo 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
In the movie Forrest Gump, the
title character and his friend
Jenny went together like peas and
carrots.
This season, for the second
ranked Stanford women's volley
ball team, seniors Anne Wicks and
Denise Rotert have come together
in a similar manner. The squad
has used the pair like a hammer
and an anvil, flattening opponents
between the two.
It is a combination that has
become very familiar to those who
follow the team. Wicks, the ham
mer, provides a strong force at the
net, using her hitting and blocking
skills to pound her adversaries.
And after the 6-foot-2 middle
blocker rotates into the back row
and finishes with her serving
duties, more often than not, head
coach Don Shaw will replace her
with Rotert, the anvil.
The 5-foot-ll defensive special
ist excels at ball-control and pass
ing. Opposing hitters and servers
who attempt to chip away at the
Cardinal's game by attacking her
area of the court rarely achieve
their goals. After she has complet
ed her tour of duty in the back row,
Wicks returns once again to wreak
havoc in the front row, starting the
cycle anew.
"These two players give us a
great combination," said Shaw.
"The fact that we can use their
respective strengths in such a way

really helps the team."
The relationship between
Wicks and Rotert has also influ
enced how they see the action on
the court when one is on the floor
and the other is not. They are able
to look through their counter
part's eyes.
"It's sort of a bonding experi
ence," Rotert said. "I don't know if
I've ever passed a ball that she's
hit, but we're tied together in a dif
ferent way."
Shaw is quick to compliment
both women on their contributions
to the team's overall development
and strength.
"They've been great team play
ers," he said. "They have the right
attitude and they've done what it
takes to succeed."
Shaw also noted that despite
the way he has used the two as one
at times, Wicks and Rotert are
both individuals with their own
talents.
For example, there are few, if
any at all, who would consider
Wicks a role player. She represents
an integral part of the offense and
the centerpiece of the squad's
blocking scheme.
Her outstanding play at
Lakeville High School in.Lakeville,
Minn., garnered her Volleyball
Monthly's 1990 high school co-
Player of the Year award. Com
bined with her academic achieve
ments, such athletic prowess made
Wicks one of five finalists for the
Dial Award, given annually to the

nation's top scholar-athlete.
While her feats look great on
paper and film, Wicks has also
impressed Shaw with her personali
ty.
"As soon as I met her, just getting
to know her personality, I felt she
would be a foundation block for this
team," Shaw said. "She's just such a
solid person, both physicalJy and
psychologically."
When the highly-touted Wicks
first came to the Farm, she found
herself far down the depth chart
behind future U.S. National Team
players Bev Oden and Amy Cooper.
According to Shaw, this only added
to her development.
"She came into a situation where
there was very little opportunity to
play," he said. "But she didn't let it
bother her and used it to become a
stronger player."
After a strong junior campaign in
which she had 230 kills and led the
team with 34 aces and 90 blocks,
Shaw named Wicks team captain for
the '94 season. The senior has

downplayed the role, even as she
provides veteran leadership.
"Being captain hasn't meant a
whole lot of leading," Wicks said. "I
think everyone here is pretty good at
taking care of themselves. It's more
making sure that everyone's happy
and well-adjusted, that everyone is
feeling good about what we're
doing."
Because of Wicks' attitude, her
adeptness in high-pressure situa
tions and the fact the she is "just so
cool," the team christened her
"Slick."
"I was sort of sad when I got it,"
Wicks said. "I couldn't tell if they
were being sarcastic or not. But I've
grown into it"
Rotert, Slick's defensive counter
part, has not accumulated the high
caliber statistics her teammate has.
She's not supposed to.
Rotert, known as "Kitt" because
of her Camaro's resemblance to the
vehicle from the television show
Knight Rider, enters matches to pre
vent opposing offenses from crack
ing the Cardinal facade.
"Denise is as solid a back-row
player as we've ever had," Shaw
said. "She's definitely an asset."
It's a tough position to be in. You
don't always know when you're

going to be called on, so you always
have to maintain a state of readi
ness. She's handled it exceptionally
well."
Rotert underwent shoulder
surgery during the off-season. How
ever, this has not stopped the back
row specialist from doing everything
else that she can to benefit the
squad.
"I think it's helped me find my
role," Rotert said. "Before, I'm not
sure if I always knew how I was sup
posed to help the team. The injury
sort of gave me a place. I can see it as
a good thing."
Having experienced many "good
things," the seniors are a little reluc
tant to face the end of their Stanford
playing days.
"It still hasn't really sunk in yet,"
Wicks said. "It seems like there's
still so much more to do that I don't
really want to think about the end
yet."
Rotert agreed with this senti
ment.
"It's come a lot quicker than I
expected it to," she said. "It's a
strange feeling."
Still, the two seem happy with
their four-year journey in Stanford's
cardinal and white.
"The program's changed a lot

over our four years," Wicks said. "I
feel pretty good about where it's
gone and where it's going. Overall,
it's been a wonderful experience."
Even after Wicks and Rotert
enter the post-Cardinal world, the
team will still feel the effects of their
contributions, according to fresh
man outside hitter Kristen Folkl.
"Having Slick around has taught
me to be more confident, to go about
things more aggressively and to not
worry so much about being too
aggressive," she said. "From Denise,
I have learned a lot about being
poised and being ready. I have a bet
ter sense of when to react and when
to wait when playing defense."
Wicks and Rotert played a large
part in integrating Stanford's amaz
ing class of recruits into the pro
gram.
"I could tell from my first two
weeks here that they were going to
do their best to make me feel at
home," Folkl said. "They have made
sure that we freshmen felt comfort
able."
Just because the end is near
doesn't mean Wicks' and Rotert's
work is done, however.
There's still a Pacific 10 Confer
ence and national championship to
earn.
