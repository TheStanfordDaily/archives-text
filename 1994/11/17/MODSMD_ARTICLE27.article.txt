# Professional Perspective
## Ex-Cardinal football players speak about their NFL lives and Saturday's Big Game 
### Jordan Wruble Staff writer 
The Cardinal football team of two years ago is
clearly the best in recent memory. After slaughtering
California and thrashing Penn State in the Block
buster Bowl, that squad finished the season ranked
ninth in the country. It also placed numerous seniors
into the NFL. Here's a quick look at how some of
those stars are faring in the professional ranks and
their views on the upcoming Big Game.
As a second-round pick of the Denver Broncos,
running back Glyn Milburn found early success in
the NFL. His favorite memory is of the first game —
"I scored my first touchdown in the first game and
we won," Milburn said.
Although it may have seemed like professional
football would be a cakewalk for the diminutive half
back, Milburn started making mistakes toward sea
son's end.
"I struggled at the end of last year," Milburn said.
"[The 16-game season] wears on you physically and
mentally."
Milburn feels the experience he gained last year
will keep him sharp through the duration of the sea
son. He's extremely happy with his role with the
Broncos, returning punts and kickoffs and catching
the ball out of the backfield. Milburn leads the Bron
cos with 52 receptions and ranks among the league's
best punt returners at 11 yards per return.
Milburn's punt return average is just one-tenth of
a yard less than that of former teammate and cur
rent San Diego Charger Darrien Gordon, whose 90-
yard punt return for a touchdown this season bol
stered his statistics. Gordon filled the spot as Cardi
nal cornerback on the Blockbuster Bowl team before
the Chargers selected him in the first round.
In the same division, the Chargers and Broncos
play twice each year. Said Milburn of Gordon, "I wish
him luck, except when we're play
ing the Chargers."
John Lynch, once in the defen
sive secondary with Gordon, is try
ing to gain recognition as a hard
hitter with the Tampa Bay Bucca
neers. The former third-round
pick's bone-crunching hits are
earning him more and more playing
time.
"It takes time to develop a repu
tation in the NFL," Lynch said.
"But (the ability to hit hard] is still
there."
Lynch is back playing free safety
after trying linebacker during his
rookie season. "They experimented
with me at linebacker last year,"
Lynch said. "Now I'm back at free
safety where I'm comfortable."
Lynch, who started five games
last year, got his first start of this
season last week.
Offensive lineman Chris Dal
man says playing with the 49ers is a
dream come true. "Every kid that
plays football wants to play pro
football and wants to do so for the

closest team," said Dalman, who
grew up in Salinas, just south of
San Jose.
Dalman is enjoying success both
as an individual and as a member of
a championship-caliber team. Dal
man was excited as he talked about
the 49ers, coming off their big win
last weekend against the Cowboys.
"The season couldn't be going bet
ter. We're in the driver's seat."
When the 49ers' offensive line
suffered numerous injuries, the
versatile Dalman, who plays both
right and left guard as well as cen
ter, got the opportunity to start
three games. His first start came
against the Rams and pitted him
against a rising star in the NFL,
mammoth defensive tackle, Sean
Gilbert. It turned out to be a major
highlight in the young career of
Dalman, who held Gilbert in
check.
Dalman, a former sixth-round
selection, is fortunate to get so
much playing time as a young
offensive lineman. He plays a posi
tion that often requires a huge
adjustment for college athletes. "I
was familiar and comfortable with
the 49er offense," Dalman said. "It
is real similar to the [Stanford!
offense, though more complex. I

had a jump on others because it
wasn't totally foreign"
Dalman knew as a rookie that he
wouldn't be afforded the same lee
way as high round picks. "As a sixth
round pick, you have to work hard
to make the team. There aren't the
same expectations as with high
picks, who get more leniency."
Former Cardinal linebacker
Dave Garnett had an even tougher
route to the pros. Undrafted, Gar
nett earned a spot with the Min
nesota Vikings under Head Coach
— and former Stanford Head
Coach — Dennis Green.
"I knew free agent rookies don't
get picked up often," Garnett said.
"I went where they wanted me."
Garnett secured his place with
the team a year ago when his 64-
yard interception return for a
touchdown sealed a preseason win
for the Vikings over the Sea
hawks.
There was more to the story.
"[The interception| was against
[former Notre Dame quarterback]
Rick Mirer, which was nice," Gar
nett said, pointing out the rivalry
between Stanford and Notre Dame.
What's Green like as a pro
coach? "It's the same as always."
Garnett said. "He runs a tight ship.

He's very focused on winning. In
short, it's a pleasure."
Garnett calls this season "up
and down," weighing his team's
division leading 7-3 record against
his personal problems. Garnett
missed five weeks with a sprained
knee suffered against the New
York Giants. He is finally return
ing to action this week and looks
forward to taking on ex-Cardinal
Ryan Wetnight, who is now playing
tight end for the Chicago Bears.
Originally undrafted, Wetnight is
another member of the Block
buster Bowl team to make it in the
NFL.
The former Stanford stars still
keep an eye on Cardinal sports and
many have stayed in touch with
current team members. Garnett's
brother Kevin is a senior defensive
back. Dalman talks to senior offen
sive lineman T.J. Gaynor as well as
other members of the Delta Tau
Delta fraternity. Lynch keeps con
tact with Justin Armour and Steve
Stenstrom. "1 call to wish them
luck before a game," Lynch said.
No seniors on that Blockbuster
Bowl team ever lost to Cal during
their Stanford careers. With Big
Game 1994 approaching, nearly all
reflect upon the 1990 contest as the

most memorable one.
"That was the craziest situation
I've ever been involved with in foot
ball," said Lynch, referring to the
storm of Cal fans rushing the field
thinking they had won.
The former Cardinal gridders
are eagerly anticipating Saturday's
game. "I'm looking forward to the
Cardinal taking back the Axe," Gar
nett said. "Thus is their bowl game.
This is the game that's most impor
tant for school pride."
Dalman offers his own encour
agement: "Pride is on the line. Flay
with pride."
Dalman is still bitter over last
season's defeat. "I saw the game
last year. It made me angry seeing
Cal run around on the field like
they'd won the national champi
onship." To the team, he says,
"Remember that. That was some
thing we never did."
"You always go through tough
times," Milburn said. "But after
that you can turn it around. My
first year we weren't very good and
by the end of my carter we were
ranked in the top 10 in the nation."
Milburn's advice? "Hang in
there," he said. "Don't get discour
aged or depressed. Persevere to the
end."

yard punt return for a touchdown this season bol
stered his statistics. Gordon filled the spot as Cardi
nal cornerback on the Blockbuster Bowl team before
the Chargers selected him in the first round.
In the same division, the Chargers and Broncos
play twice each year. Said Milburn of Gordon, "I wish
him luck, except when we're play
ing the Chargers."
John Lynch, once in the defen
sive secondary with Gordon, is try
ing to gain recognition as a hard
hitter with the Tampa Bay Bucca
neers. The former third-round
pick's bone-crunching hits are
earning him more and more playing
time.
"It takes time to develop a repu
tation in the NFL," Lynch said.
"But (the ability to hit hard] is still
there."
Lynch is back playing free safety
after trying linebacker during his
rookie season. "They experimented
with me at linebacker last year,"
Lynch said. "Now I'm back at free
safety where I'm comfortable."
Lynch, who started five games
last year, got his first start of this
season last week.
Offensive lineman Chris Dal
man says playing with the 49ers is a
dream come true. "Every kid that
plays football wants to play pro
football and wants to do so for the

closest team," said Dalman, who
grew up in Salinas, just south of
San Jose.
Dalman is enjoying success both
as an individual and as a member of
a championship-caliber team. Dal
man was excited as he talked about
the 49ers, coming off their big win
last weekend against the Cowboys.
"The season couldn't be going bet
ter. We're in the driver's seat."
When the 49ers' offensive line
suffered numerous injuries, the
versatile Dalman, who plays both
right and left guard as well as cen
ter, got the opportunity to start
three games. His first start came
against the Rams and pitted him
against a rising star in the NFL,
mammoth defensive tackle, Sean
Gilbert. It turned out to be a major
highlight in the young career of
Dalman, who held Gilbert in
check.
Dalman, a former sixth-round
selection, is fortunate to get so
much playing time as a young
offensive lineman. He plays a posi
tion that often requires a huge
adjustment for college athletes. "I
was familiar and comfortable with
the 49er offense," Dalman said. "It
is real similar to the [Stanford!
offense, though more complex. I

had a jump on others because it
wasn't totally foreign"
Dalman knew as a rookie that he
wouldn't be afforded the same lee
way as high round picks. "As a sixth
round pick, you have to work hard
to make the team. There aren't the
same expectations as with high
picks, who get more leniency."
Former Cardinal linebacker
Dave Garnett had an even tougher
route to the pros. Undrafted, Gar
nett earned a spot with the Min
nesota Vikings under Head Coach
— and former Stanford Head
Coach — Dennis Green.
"I knew free agent rookies don't
get picked up often," Garnett said.
"I went where they wanted me."
Garnett secured his place with
the team a year ago when his 64-
yard interception return for a
touchdown sealed a preseason win
for the Vikings over the Sea
hawks.
There was more to the story.
"[The interception| was against
[former Notre Dame quarterback]
Rick Mirer, which was nice," Gar
nett said, pointing out the rivalry
between Stanford and Notre Dame.
What's Green like as a pro
coach? "It's the same as always."
Garnett said. "He runs a tight ship.

He's very focused on winning. In
short, it's a pleasure."
Garnett calls this season "up
and down," weighing his team's
division leading 7-3 record against
his personal problems. Garnett
missed five weeks with a sprained
knee suffered against the New
York Giants. He is finally return
ing to action this week and looks
forward to taking on ex-Cardinal
Ryan Wetnight, who is now playing
tight end for the Chicago Bears.
Originally undrafted, Wetnight is
another member of the Block
buster Bowl team to make it in the
NFL.
The former Stanford stars still
keep an eye on Cardinal sports and
many have stayed in touch with
current team members. Garnett's
brother Kevin is a senior defensive
back. Dalman talks to senior offen
sive lineman T.J. Gaynor as well as
other members of the Delta Tau
Delta fraternity. Lynch keeps con
tact with Justin Armour and Steve
Stenstrom. "1 call to wish them
luck before a game," Lynch said.
No seniors on that Blockbuster
Bowl team ever lost to Cal during
their Stanford careers. With Big
Game 1994 approaching, nearly all
reflect upon the 1990 contest as the

most memorable one.
"That was the craziest situation
I've ever been involved with in foot
ball," said Lynch, referring to the
storm of Cal fans rushing the field
thinking they had won.
The former Cardinal gridders
are eagerly anticipating Saturday's
game. "I'm looking forward to the
Cardinal taking back the Axe," Gar
nett said. "Thus is their bowl game.
This is the game that's most impor
tant for school pride."
Dalman offers his own encour
agement: "Pride is on the line. Flay
with pride."
Dalman is still bitter over last
season's defeat. "I saw the game
last year. It made me angry seeing
Cal run around on the field like
they'd won the national champi
onship." To the team, he says,
"Remember that. That was some
thing we never did."
"You always go through tough
times," Milburn said. "But after
that you can turn it around. My
first year we weren't very good and
by the end of my carter we were
ranked in the top 10 in the nation."
Milburn's advice? "Hang in
there," he said. "Don't get discour
aged or depressed. Persevere to the
end."
The Cardinal football team of two years ago is
clearly the best in recent memory. After slaughtering
California and thrashing Penn State in the Block
buster Bowl, that squad finished the season ranked
ninth in the country. It also placed numerous seniors
into the NFL. Here's a quick look at how some of
those stars are faring in the professional ranks and
their views on the upcoming Big Game.
As a second-round pick of the Denver Broncos,
running back Glyn Milburn found early success in
the NFL. His favorite memory is of the first game —
"I scored my first touchdown in the first game and
we won," Milburn said.
Although it may have seemed like professional
football would be a cakewalk for the diminutive half
back, Milburn started making mistakes toward sea
son's end.
"I struggled at the end of last year," Milburn said.
"[The 16-game season] wears on you physically and
mentally."
Milburn feels the experience he gained last year
will keep him sharp through the duration of the sea
son. He's extremely happy with his role with the
Broncos, returning punts and kickoffs and catching
the ball out of the backfield. Milburn leads the Bron
cos with 52 receptions and ranks among the league's
best punt returners at 11 yards per return.
Milburn's punt return average is just one-tenth of
a yard less than that of former teammate and cur
rent San Diego Charger Darrien Gordon, whose 90-
yard punt return for a touchdown this season bol
stered his statistics. Gordon filled the spot as Cardi
nal cornerback on the Blockbuster Bowl team before
the Chargers selected him in the first round.
