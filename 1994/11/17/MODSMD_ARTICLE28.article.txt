# Caught amidst the raging winds of change
## Senior nose tackle Jason Fisk reflects upon his Stanford career 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Calling Stanford's season a wild roller coast
er of uplifting triumphs and emotional tragedies
could be understating the obvious. For many of
the upperclassmen on the team, that ride can be
extended to encompass an entire career.
Senior nose tackle Jason Fisk is one of those
Cardinal veterans, first receiving playing time

under former head coach Denny Green four
years ago and then hardening under the direc
tion of Bill Walsh.
In his five years at Stanford, the Davis, Calif,
native has seen crack defensive units and a bowl
victory and also suffered through the two-year
collapse of the defense. And all during that time,
Fisk has retained his stoic face and consistent
level of play.
Want on-the-job training? Try 41 starts (37

straight and counting heading into Big Game)
for a defensive player who endures possibly the
most punishment, game in and game out, of any
player on the field. During that time, the 6-foot
4, 285-pounder has gradually taken on the man
tle of leadership.
In his four-year stint as the key stop-troop in
defensive coordinator Fred vonAppen's army,
his tackle total has climbed steadily.
Making 18 tackles his freshman
year, that total rose to 49 in 1992
and 67 last year. This year he is sec
ond on the team with 72 stops, only
seven behind senior linebacker Coy
Gibbs.
Fisk also provides a steady force
behind the line of scrimmage. For
the year, he has broken through for
10 tackles-for-loss for minus-43
yards, including five sacks for
minus-33. For his career, he has
eight sacks ;ind 22 tackles-for-loss.
Despite his consistent level of
play, the defense as a whole has suf
fered through a year of missed
opportunities and inability to come
together as a unit. For a seasoned
veteran who was an important
member of the rock-solid 1992
defense, the frustration has only
grown the past two years.
"Just going from being on that
defense and then falling to the level
that we fell, it's hard," Fisk said.
"Giving up sometimes less than a
100 yards totally and then going to
giving up 400-500 yards a game and

31 points, and not really making
anything happen. Its a hig
turnaround."
Because of all his playing time,
Fisk brings possibly the most valu
able commodity to the Stanford
defense — experience. With the
incredible amount of time spent
learning and practicing the Stanford
defense, Fisk has a good view of the
progression of this year's defense.
"It's been there all year, in scat
tered places," Fisk said. "Some days
it just comes together. That's going
to happen. There's nothing more
important to being good than experi
ence. You can be the best athlete in
the world, but if you don't have a
sense of where the receiver will run
the route or where the back's going
to hit the hole, you're not going to do
much. That's the key factor that's
held us back."
Fisk has tried to impart some of
the winning tradition that he experi
enced as a younger player, which the
freshmen and sophomores on this
year's squad have not been a real
part of.
"But it didn't work out like we
hoped," Fisk said. "We showed them
how to get close a lot of times,
though."
Indeed, Fisk and the defense

have had their share of close calls.
Through the middle of the season,
Stanford played four consecutive
games in which the contest was not
decided until the final minutes,
including two one-point losses.
Now, the 3-6-1 Cardinal can look
back on the first 10 games and see
just nine points keeping it from a 7-3
record The difference in those games
— the defense's inability to stop the
other team when it needed to.
Finally breaking through with a
strong performance in the second
half against Washington in Stan
ford's 46-28 victory, the defense
appeared to have turned the corner.
But then a week later, that same
group gave up 55 points to Oregon,
the most surrendered in 13 years by
the Cardinal. For Fisk and the rest
of the defense, the frustration con
tinues to mount.
"People really rose to the occa
sion against Washington,"he said.
" Every body on that defense was
playing their hearts out and knew
that they could get it done. It just
hasn't happened every week like
that. If we knew, then we would
make it a good defense all the time."
Due to that experience and the
desire to return to winning ways,
Fisk brought in lofty goals this year.

Despite describing himself as an
"eternal pessimist," Fisk subscribed
to the opinion of many others in see
ing a Rose Bowl berth as a viable end
to the year. After several of the Car
dinal's heartbreaking losses, he
quickly adapted those goals.
"We had all the talent to do it, but
nothing came together like we
expected it to do or hoped it would,"
he said. "You have to set your goals
big and work from there. We did
have to scale them down — now
maybe we can get into a bowl game,
now maybe we can be .500, now
maybe we can beat Cal."
After Big Game, a winter of
uncertainty looms for Fisk. While a
professional football career may be
in the cards, the psychology major
and two-time Academic All-Pacific
10 Conference honoree also has sub
tle aspirations to enter the medical
field. Although he is not sure
whether it will be in a research
capacity or an actual medical prac
tice, Fisk has some time to decide.
"I'm going to explore in the next
couple of quarters some things I
haven't been able to explore," he
said. "I haven't been able to work in
a lab or do anything related to what
I'm interested in because of the time
spent with football."

Want on-the-job training? Try 41 starts (37

straight and counting heading into Big Game)
for a defensive player who endures possibly the
most punishment, game in and game out, of any
player on the field. During that time, the 6-foot
4, 285-pounder has gradually taken on the man
tle of leadership.
In his four-year stint as the key stop-troop in
defensive coordinator Fred vonAppen's army,
his tackle total has climbed steadily.
Making 18 tackles his freshman
year, that total rose to 49 in 1992
and 67 last year. This year he is sec
ond on the team with 72 stops, only
seven behind senior linebacker Coy
Gibbs.
Fisk also provides a steady force
behind the line of scrimmage. For
the year, he has broken through for
10 tackles-for-loss for minus-43
yards, including five sacks for
minus-33. For his career, he has
eight sacks ;ind 22 tackles-for-loss.
Despite his consistent level of
play, the defense as a whole has suf
fered through a year of missed
opportunities and inability to come
together as a unit. For a seasoned
veteran who was an important
member of the rock-solid 1992
defense, the frustration has only
grown the past two years.
"Just going from being on that
defense and then falling to the level
that we fell, it's hard," Fisk said.
"Giving up sometimes less than a
100 yards totally and then going to
giving up 400-500 yards a game and

31 points, and not really making
anything happen. Its a hig
turnaround."
Because of all his playing time,
Fisk brings possibly the most valu
able commodity to the Stanford
defense — experience. With the
incredible amount of time spent
learning and practicing the Stanford
defense, Fisk has a good view of the
progression of this year's defense.
"It's been there all year, in scat
tered places," Fisk said. "Some days
it just comes together. That's going
to happen. There's nothing more
important to being good than experi
ence. You can be the best athlete in
the world, but if you don't have a
sense of where the receiver will run
the route or where the back's going
to hit the hole, you're not going to do
much. That's the key factor that's
held us back."
Fisk has tried to impart some of
the winning tradition that he experi
enced as a younger player, which the
freshmen and sophomores on this
year's squad have not been a real
part of.
"But it didn't work out like we
hoped," Fisk said. "We showed them
how to get close a lot of times,
though."
Indeed, Fisk and the defense

have had their share of close calls.
Through the middle of the season,
Stanford played four consecutive
games in which the contest was not
decided until the final minutes,
including two one-point losses.
Now, the 3-6-1 Cardinal can look
back on the first 10 games and see
just nine points keeping it from a 7-3
record The difference in those games
— the defense's inability to stop the
other team when it needed to.
Finally breaking through with a
strong performance in the second
half against Washington in Stan
ford's 46-28 victory, the defense
appeared to have turned the corner.
But then a week later, that same
group gave up 55 points to Oregon,
the most surrendered in 13 years by
the Cardinal. For Fisk and the rest
of the defense, the frustration con
tinues to mount.
"People really rose to the occa
sion against Washington,"he said.
" Every body on that defense was
playing their hearts out and knew
that they could get it done. It just
hasn't happened every week like
that. If we knew, then we would
make it a good defense all the time."
Due to that experience and the
desire to return to winning ways,
Fisk brought in lofty goals this year.

Despite describing himself as an
"eternal pessimist," Fisk subscribed
to the opinion of many others in see
ing a Rose Bowl berth as a viable end
to the year. After several of the Car
dinal's heartbreaking losses, he
quickly adapted those goals.
"We had all the talent to do it, but
nothing came together like we
expected it to do or hoped it would,"
he said. "You have to set your goals
big and work from there. We did
have to scale them down — now
maybe we can get into a bowl game,
now maybe we can be .500, now
maybe we can beat Cal."
After Big Game, a winter of
uncertainty looms for Fisk. While a
professional football career may be
in the cards, the psychology major
and two-time Academic All-Pacific
10 Conference honoree also has sub
tle aspirations to enter the medical
field. Although he is not sure
whether it will be in a research
capacity or an actual medical prac
tice, Fisk has some time to decide.
"I'm going to explore in the next
couple of quarters some things I
haven't been able to explore," he
said. "I haven't been able to work in
a lab or do anything related to what
I'm interested in because of the time
spent with football."

Both on and off the field, senior nose tackle Jason Fisk has seen
much over his four-year career.
Calling Stanford's season a wild roller coast
er of uplifting triumphs and emotional tragedies
could be understating the obvious. For many of
the upperclassmen on the team, that ride can be
extended to encompass an entire career.
Senior nose tackle Jason Fisk is one of those
Cardinal veterans, first receiving playing time

under former head coach Denny Green four
years ago and then hardening under the direc
tion of Bill Walsh.
In his five years at Stanford, the Davis, Calif,
native has seen crack defensive units and a bowl
victory and also suffered through the two-year
collapse of the defense. And all during that time,
Fisk has retained his stoic face and consistent
level of play.
Want on-the-job training? Try 41 starts (37

straight and counting heading into Big Game)
for a defensive player who endures possibly the
