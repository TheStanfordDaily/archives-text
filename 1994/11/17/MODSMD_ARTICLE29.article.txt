Injuries are a part of every
sport, and teams somehow have
to fight their way through them.
But with four of 10 starters hurt,
the Stanford wrestling team will
face more than just a fight early in
the season.
"There are always injuries,"
said head coach Chris Horpel,
who enters his 16th year coaching
at Stanford. "It's a combat sport.
[The rash of injuries] just means
business as usual."
Junior co-captain Jimmy
Aguirre and junior Tod Surmon,
both of whom qualified for the
National Championships last
year, head the Cardinal's list of
sidelined athletes. Aguirre, last
year's Pacific 10 Conference
champion, and Surmon both
placed 13th in NCAAs in the 134-
and 150-pound divisions respec
tively. Both will not be able to
wrestle until January, with Sur
mon recovering from an elbow
injury and Aguirre from a rup
tured disk in his neck.
Heavyweight Scott Whitt will
also miss early action because he
is currently playing football. Hor
pel doesn't expect the senior to get
in wrestling shape until January.
