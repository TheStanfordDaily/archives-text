# Wrestlers set for strong year despite injuries

Injuries are a part of every
sport, and teams somehow have
to fight their way through them.
But with four of 10 starters hurt,
the Stanford wrestling team will
face more than just a fight early in
the season.
"There are always injuries,"
said head coach Chris Horpel,
who enters his 16th year coaching
at Stanford. "It's a combat sport.
[The rash of injuries] just means
business as usual."
Junior co-captain Jimmy
Aguirre and junior Tod Surmon,
both of whom qualified for the
National Championships last
year, head the Cardinal's list of
sidelined athletes. Aguirre, last
year's Pacific 10 Conference
champion, and Surmon both
placed 13th in NCAAs in the 134-
and 150-pound divisions respec
tively. Both will not be able to
wrestle until January, with Sur
mon recovering from an elbow
injury and Aguirre from a rup
tured disk in his neck.
Heavyweight Scott Whitt will
also miss early action because he
is currently playing football. Hor
pel doesn't expect the senior to get
in wrestling shape until January.
"I set some pretty lofty team

Although handicapped by early injuries, the Stanford wrestling team is posed to wage a fierce '94-'95
campaign.
goals," senior co-captain Jay Jack
son said. "But with all the injuries,
it'll be really hard. We could always
count on wins from [Aguirre and
SurmonJ. We'll do the best we can."
Juniors Ed Medina and Jack
Art man will replace Aguirre and
Surmon. Medina is a returning let
terman and Artman finished fourth
in the 150-pound class in last Sun
day's California Open at Cal State-
Fullerton.
In the Fullerton event, 16 Cardi
nal wrestlers competed, with nine
placing in the top six. Jackson won
the 134-pound division, triumphing
in all four of his matches and regis
tering two pins. Last year, Jackson
placed ninth at NCAAs.
"A lot of guys wrestled well,"
Jackson said. "But there's still lots
of room for improvement."
The Cardinal hopes that the
improvements will come soon, as
Stanford will compete in its first
dual meet of the year this Friday at
UC-Davis. Two of the injured
starters, junior Sahlan Martin and

sophomore Roger Liu, should wres
tle against Davis.
"It's a rivalry," Horpel said.
"They want to show us they are just
as good as we are. I will not accept a
defeat to them."
According to Jackson, since
wrestling is one of the Aggies' few
Division I sports, Davis attracts
many wrestling fans and its ath
letes tend to perform better as a
result.
"I never want to lose to them,"
said Jackson, who has never lost to
the Aggies. "It's a pride thing."
With all the injuries, dual meets
will prove difficult. However, Hor
pel believes that his squad can
overcome the handicap. Stanford
retains most of last year's team,
which finished eighth in the Pac-10
with a 3-7 record. The Cardinal lost
only one significant athlete to grad
uation — Lance Johnson, a 142-
pounder who placed in Pac-lOs all
four years at Stanford and quali
fied for NCAAs in his sophomore
and junior years. An injury kept
him out of last year's national tour
nament.
"We have really good leadership
this year," Horpel said. "The atti
tude will stay good. We'll do well
with what we've got."
