# New pro-fro weekend
## A 						renewed emphasis to recruit minorities 
### Neha Gupta Contributing writer 
In yet another attempt to make Stanford
more attractive to prospective students and
to better coordinate the recruitment of mi
norities, the Office of Undergraduate Ad
missions has decided to replace its annual
Prospective Freshman Week with a new
program called Stanford Admit Weekend.
This new program is an effort to bring
the diverse communities of Stanford to
gether in one weekend. "We'll be able to bet
ter showcase all the different strengths of
the University this way," said Elise Maar,
Associate Director of Admissions and coor
dinator of the weekend.
In addition, the three-day event — which

will also replace the sepa
rate recruiting efforts of
the African-American,
Native-American and
Chicano / Latino commu
nities — is an attempt to
encourage more minority
students to choose Stan
ford instead of schools like
Harvard and Yale, said
Dean of Undergraduate

Admissions and Financial Aid James Mon
toya.
The new program will allow for better
coordination among administration, facul
ty and students, as well as more integration

of the different communities var
ious events, Maar said.
The weekend will also address
the concern that increasing num
bers of parents want to accompany
their students to campus by pro
viding them with special pro
grams.
Another difference in the week
end is that students and their par
ents will have to pre-register for
the weekend's programs in order
to coordinate attendance, Maar
added.
While the weekend's structure
has been established, Montoya
emphasized that student input is
needed to carry out the program.
"If the community is unaware
of our efforts, I think it will be very
difficult to be very successful," he
said.
The weekend is actually part of
the office's larger effort to refocus
Stanford's overall recruitment
strategy in regards to the three

target minority groups — Chicano
/ Latinos, Native Americans and
African Americans.
The increased recruitment is a
result of a $200,000 grant recently
given to the ethnic centers by the
Provost's Office. The money will he
distributed over a two-year period
in order to aid the ethnic commu
nities with recruitment and reten
tion of undergraduate and gradu
ate students, Montoya said.
For example, Associate Director
of Admissions Julie Taylor has
met with a variety of black com
munity members since last spring,
meeting this fall solely with stu
dent leaders. A variety of funda
mental issues were discussed in
these meetings which would create
a more effective recruitment pro
gram, she said.
These issues include contacting
students earlier, the role family
plays in making a decision of
where to enroll, going across the
country to attend school and com
ing to California. An effort will
also be made to focus on academic
programs available to African-
American students, such as

research.
An implemented suggestion has
been to send postcards out to stu
dents informing them of visits to
their areas by Stanford admission
officers.
This strategy has already
proved effective, as evidenced by
larger turnouts at regional meet
ings this fall. "'Many of the stu
dents mention how impressed they
are that Stanford is making a spe
cial effort to contact them," Maar
said.
Last night, the black communi
ty also held a meeting to bolster
student interest and enthusiasm
for the new efforts to recruit stu
dents of color.
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions is hoping to get more
feedback from this meeting as stu
dents discuss a variety of issues
facing the black community.
Since the black community has
historically concentrated on bring
ing prospective freshmen to visit
Stanford through its own recruit
ment activities, the office also
wants to ensure that efforts are
coordinated.

While all three of the African-
American, Chicano / Latino and
Native-American groups are being
targeted, a special effort is being
made to focus on the black com
munity because the number of
African Americans enrolling at
Stanford is not rising along with
other minorities, Taylor said.
According to Montoya, since
Harvard and Yale saw a dramatic
drop in the number of African
Americans who enrolled at their
schools, they "intensified their
efforts and thus became competi
tion for Stanford." In response,
Stanford is now concentrating to
increase enrollment on this minor
ity.
"There's a lot of demand for
black students who can go to Stan
ford. It has a lot to do with neck
and-neck competition," said Blair
Bowman, director of the black
community center.
This is a special concern for
Stanford because it is situated on
the West Coast away from the
majority of concentrations of black
students in the East and South,
Montoya said.
