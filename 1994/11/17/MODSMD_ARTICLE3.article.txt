### Neha Gupta Contributing writer 
In yet another attempt to make Stanford
more attractive to prospective students and
to better coordinate the recruitment of mi
norities, the Office of Undergraduate Ad
missions has decided to replace its annual
Prospective Freshman Week with a new
program called Stanford Admit Weekend.
This new program is an effort to bring
the diverse communities of Stanford to
gether in one weekend. "We'll be able to bet
ter showcase all the different strengths of
the University this way," said Elise Maar,
Associate Director of Admissions and coor
dinator of the weekend.
In addition, the three-day event — which

will also replace the sepa
rate recruiting efforts of
the African-American,
Native-American and
Chicano / Latino commu
nities — is an attempt to
encourage more minority
students to choose Stan
ford instead of schools like
Harvard and Yale, said
Dean of Undergraduate

Admissions and Financial Aid James Mon
toya.
The new program will allow for better
coordination among administration, facul
ty and students, as well as more integration
