# Field hockey looks back on its season

The Stanford field hockey
team had quite a ride this year.
"[The season] was a roller
coaster," said junior tri-cap
tain Leah Jacobs. "We had
some really good games. Some
games we'd play to our poten
tial and be up, but we also fell
hard."
The Cardinal began the
year with a five-game East
Coast trip that included a visit
to then-No. 1 North Carolina.
Stanford lost four and was
outscored 14-1 in the five
games. In their first game on
the West Coast, however, Cali
fornia crushed the Cardinal, 3-
0, on Sept. 16 at Berkeley.
But the Cardinal's Califor
nia homecoming marked the
return of junior tri-captain
Elise Morgan, who had pulled
her left quadricep muscle
doing sprints in the preseason.
The team felt her impact in the
very next game at University
of the Pacific. Morgan scored
both of the Cardinal's goals in
its 2-1 triumph.
Stanford then went on to
win four games in a row, rip
ping its opponents by a com
bined score of 13-4. During the
streak, the Cardinal pummeled
California, 3-1, in front of a
home crowd.
"[One of the highest points
of the season] was beating Cal
at home decisively in front of
so many fans," Morgan said.
The Cardinal then found
itself tied with the Golden
Bears for first place in the
Northern Pacific Conference
heading into a three-game
weekend. On Oct. 7, Stanford

pounded Davis and Elkins, a
Canadian team, but lost Mor
gan for the year. The midfield
er suffered a partially torn lat
eral collateral ligament in her
knee which needed surgical
repair.
"Elise's injury changed the
whole feeling on the team,"
Jacobs said. "She is the most
consistent player on the team."
Pacific dominated the Car
dinal's next game, scoring a 3-
1 victory on Stanford's field.
"Losing to [Pacific] was the
lowest point [of the year],"
senior tri-captain Tina Syer
said. "We came out flat and it
ended our NCAA hopes. It was
frustrating."
Even without Morgan in the
line-up, Stanford still finished
the year fighting. The squad
suffered two tough losses, 1-0
to California on Oct. 15 and 2-
1 to Pacific on Nov. 1, but in
the latter contest, the Cardinal
dominated but just was not
able to put the ball in the net.
Stanford also tied Simon Fras
er, 0-0, in the California Invi
tational on Oct. 23.
The Cardinal played one of
its best games of the year
against Simon Fraser, accord
ing to Morgan. "We were con
sistent throughout the entire
game," she said. "[For 70 min
utes,] we kept up the team
game."
Stanford finished with an
overall record of 6-8-1 landing
it last in NorPac at 2-4.
"[Failing to make playoffs]
was a disappointment," Syer
said. "I'm still proud of the
way we played. My goal was to
have the team play beautiful
