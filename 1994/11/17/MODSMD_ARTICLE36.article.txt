# Sounds from tradition-laden ’Fiddler' fill Colden Gate
## 
### Linda Friedlieb 
Tradition! Tradition!" The popular re
frain represents an apt beginning for a
musical which in itself has become a
tradition.
"Fiddler on the Roof," now playing at San
Francisco's (iolden (iate Theater as part of the
annual Best of Broadway series, is the living
embodiment of the word. The production,
performed in honor of the musical's 30th an
niversary, uses Jerome Robbin's original Tony
award-winning direction and choreography.
For those not traditionally oriented, "lid
dler" is the narrative of a Jewish dairyman
named Tevye who is raising his family of five
daughters in the town of Anatevka, in a rural
corner of Russia. It's a story of romance as the
eldest daughters seek husbands for love and a
tale of survival as the Jews of Anatevka try to
live their lives without provoking the preju
dice surrounding them.
The atmosphere of the historic old Gold
en Gate seems appropriate for "Fiddler" —
both appear to be relics from the golden age
of the stage. And, like the gilt on the walls of
the theater, "Fiddler" often appears a little
cheesy or overdone.
After all, any story which revolves around
a matchmaker setting up marriages and
daughters resisting those matches may seem
a little trite to us average college students
looking for a date to the movies rather than
someone to stand with under the traditional
marriage chuppah.
And "Matchmaker, matchmaker, make
me a match, find me a find, catch me catch,"
is a tune we're unlikely to catch many of our
classmates singing.
So the key is to remember that "Fiddler" is a
historical romance — telling of a different time
in a different place where women deciding their
own marriages was something akin to treason.
Once we get past the culture shock, "Fid
dler" remains what it has always been — a
musical treat for the eyes and ears.
Robbins' original choreography remains
as sharp as ever, with the intersection of Jew
ish and non-Jewish people in "To Life" an
amazing jumble of constantly moving feet
gracing the floor while songs such as "The
Wedding Dance" combine the old single-sex
dance traditions with more modern ball

room dance, demonstrating the evolution, or
perhaps destruction, of a custom.
In the role of Tevye, internationally
renowned stage actor Theodore Bikel
performs admirably especially during
such noted musical numbers as "Tradition"
and "If 1 Were a Rich Man." His chemistry
with Marcia Rodd, in the role of his wife
Golde, shines through yards of bickering and

the somewhat sappy "Do You Love Me?"
One odd part of this production of "Fid
dler" are the accents — or lack thereof. If we
close our eyes, the resemblance to a certain
Kevin Costner film appears somewhat strik
ing. Accents came, accents went; this charac
ter had a somewhat authentic sound, that
one didn't even try.
Bikel's Tevye did not speak with much of

an accent, while Chevi Colton as Yenta the
matchmaker sounded like she had just
jumped off the boat carrying her from Anat
evka to San Francisco. As the eldest daughter
Tzeitel, Joanna Glushak had just a trace of an
accent until she imitated Yenta's voice while
singing "Matchmaker."
The great thing about an ensemble is that
it helps to take the pressure off any individual
actor to be anything more than good. With
the exception of Bikel and possibly Rodd, few
seemed to feel that pressure.
Yet the entire cast of the production ex
ceeded expectations — recreating a tradi
tion of excellence with the same kind of bal
ance and delicacy as must by exercised by any
fiddler balancing on a roof.
From the familiar Jewish Yenta positively
exuding gossip down to the ghostly Fruma
Sarah (Holly Evers) frightening Golde out of
her sleep, all members of the cast held their
heads high. Some even shined — specifical
ly Glushak as the eldest daughter Tzeitel and
Jerry Matz as her somewhat shy beau Motel.
Despite the overwhelming aura of tradi
tion, "Fiddle" in many ways remains a ground
breaker — hitting 30 years with the same
strength and power with which it debuted.
Just as Tzeitel, Hodel, Chava and Tevye
found ways to both break and construct the
traditions of their own lives, Bikel and compa
ny have found a way to combine the history
and charm of a 30-year-old tradition with the
power of talent which had not even been born
the first time a fiddler played on a roof. ■
