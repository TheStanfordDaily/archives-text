# Singing songs of 'curves and bends and slippery skin'

Thinking Lame Assholes Union Local
Fuck You." Since naming themselves the
Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, Mark
Davies, Anne Eickelberg, Brian Hageman, Jay
Paget and Hugh Swarts have grown accus
tomed to people getting the name wrong,
though rarely with such hostility.
"We don't see that level of bitterness in ref
erence to us very often," says guitarist / vocal
ist Brian Hageman, reacting to the uncompli
mentary nickname used in a letter to Ba
nanafish magazine. "We thought it was pretty
hilarious, actually."
"That came from a person who thinks Hel
met is the greatest band on earth, and that the
kind of stuff we do is ruining the scene," he
adds.
Mixing delicate melodies, urgent guitars
and spooky musical landscapes, and spicing
them up with everything from Eastern
rhythms to random home recordings, the
Thinking Fellers' eccentric musical experi
mentation seems to break all the rules of con
ventional rock; but that same experimenta
tion probably keeps them too far out of touch
with "the scene" to actually ruin it.
"1 don't really have a point of reference for
us and alternative music," Hageman explains.
"It's just that my tastes, and most of the peo
ple's tastes in the group, are going outside
that."
With influences ranging from Neil Young
to the Talking Heads to Asian folk music, the
Thinking Fellers' style is indeed hard to grasp,
especially as it changes so drastically and un
expectedly from song to song and from album
to album. Perhaps the Fellers describe their
style best in the song "Cup of Dreams," when
they sing, "We'll sing a song of curves and
bends and slippery skin."
The Thinking Fellers have held true to that
promise, having spent the last seven years
churning out one slippery-skinned song after
another, offering no indication of which way

the band might curve and bend next. Even the
members of the band don't really know where
the songs come from or where they might go.
"Our general approach is to get together
and play a lot and record anything that sounds
like it might be starting to be interesting,"
Hageman says. "Usually we're kind of sur
prised by the outcome, because the songs seem
like they were written on their own."
Fourteen of these songs comprise the
band's latest album, "Strangers From the Uni
verse," which offers a wonderfully diverse col
lection of sounds, ranging from the rocking,
bouncing "My Pal the Tortoise" to the
thoughtful and relaxing "Hundreds of Years."
"We throw in a lot of different kinds of in
struments just to Find a sound that we like,"
Hageman says, describing the band's collabo
rative songwriting and performing. "For bet
ter or worse, it's totally democratic."
"We usually hope that what we come up
with will be something that runs the listener
through a variety of moods," he adds. "We're
trying to set up intense situations — not nec
essarily intense because they're loud or noisy
— but we just try to make complex moods."
These complex moods dominate
"Strangers From the Universe," as it bombards
the listener with strange, vivid imagery creat
ed by both music and words.
"The Oxenmaster" — one of five brief at
mospheric interludes on the album — fea
tures a bass and an unamplified electric guitar
recorded through a single stereo pair of mi
crophones, intended to give the song "a true
stereo feel, where you can actually feel the
shape of the room," Hageman says.
A similarly inventive Thinking Fellers' trick
involves taking a whole mix and running it
through a HA. system and then recording it
with a single stereo pair of microphones in
order to "change the character of the sound."
Techniques such as these are even more en
chanting when coupled with the band's wildly
imaginative lyrics, which are the product of an
odd fascination with "how the world works."
"Sometimes they come from dreamlike
states, and sometimes they just come from
doing a lot of writing," Hageman says. "We're
just trying to find interesting ways of looking
at things."

In "Socket," the singer is knocked out by an
electrical shock and awakes in a confused and
disturbed state, singing: "The doctors claim
there's nothing wrong with me / But 1 can't
taste or smell / And I can hardly see / And sleep

is my worst
enemy."
"Sinking
Boats," from
the 1991
" Lovelyville"
album, de
picts the
singer in a
similarly
puzzling sit
uati on :
"Hotcakes
lying in the

middle of the road / I tipped a glass to some
people who drowned / And in a deep funk I
felt a murky brotherhood / With inhalers of
water, intentional or not."
Thinking Fellers lyrics are an intriguing
mix of wisdom, nonsense and power,
grounded in real world experience, but
extended far beyond.
"Operation" appears to be one of the band's
more dreamlike songs, as it tells the tale of a
person who suddenly finds himself on an op
erating table for no apparent reason. A con
fused voice sings: "I was having an operation
done /No I didn't know what for /1 just ended
up being there /1 hadn't been paying attention
/ 1 was very afraid / We were downtown out
side / It hardly seemed the place for an opera
tion."
"That stuff comes from the horrors of work
and the difficulty one has in controlling their
own atmosphere, and having to deal with a lot
of shit that you'd rather not deal with," says
Hageman, explaining the inspiration for the
song. "You have to watch yourself at all times;
otherwise you'll find yourself being operated
on."
The Thinking Fellers have dealt with the
hardships of work since their beginning.
Hageman, Davies, Eickelberg, and Swarts
grew up in lowa City, lowa, where they first
started performing to a somewhat disinterest-

Ed community.
"It was kind of hard," Hageman says, "Be
cause playing shows, we could never hope to
have a very large audience."
The four of them left lowa City in 1986, and
they journeyed to San Francisco, where, with
the addition of fifth member Jay Paget, they
would become the Thinking Fellers Union
Local 282.
"We moved out because we wanted to expe
rience another place," Hageman explains,
"And San Francisco seemed like the place be
cause some of the music that we all held in
common, like the Ralph Records stuff like the
Residents came from there. So we thought
there might be a larger support group for doing
odd stuff there."
Eight years later, the Thinking Fellers are on
their way back to San Francisco, this time as
part of their current tour, which comes to the
Great American Music Hall on Tuesday, Nov.
22, with Fly Ashtray and the Sun City Girls.
The band has been enjoying the chance to
play in front of some larger, all-ages audiences.
"We were looking down on twelve-year-olds in
the front row," Hageman says, describing a re
cent show, "And doing whatever we could to
confuse them."
"It's been the best national tour we've done
yet," he adds, "because there's been more at
tention to this record than to any before."
On album or in concert, the Thinking
Fellers' playful yet thoughtful blend of spirit,
power and imagination sets them far apart
from the crowd.
As more and more hands clog the alterna
tive airwaves with distortion and angst, a
unique world of confusion invites curious
minds to wander past the usual grungy con
straints, and into the uncharted terrain of the
Thinking Fellers Union Local 282. ■
