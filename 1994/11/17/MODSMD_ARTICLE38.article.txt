The Oasis If you're on-the
prowl and looking for cheap place
to hang out, eat, socialize and
scope, this is the place for you. The
Oasis is probably the closest that
Palo Alto ever gets to seedy, but the
atmosphere is great and the beer
selection is extensive. If you're out

to avoid peach stucco
and musak, The Oasis
might be a good choice.
Watch out if you're
under 21, as you will be
relegated to the out
door patio. Food here is
quite inexpensive, as
most of it is from the
pizza and burger food
group. Located at 241
El Camino Real, Menlo
Park, The Oasis is open
seven days a week from
11 a.m. to 2 a.m. 326-
8896.
Alice's Restau
rant The atmos-

phere and location of this place
are incomparable, so enjoy the
rugged decor (complete with
mounted animal heads) and the
redwood surroundings. During
most of the week, Alice's offers a
plethora of Americana, like the
extensive brunch menu or the

homemade pies. On Mondays
and Tuesdays, Alice's goes inter
national and offers up cuisine
from Nepal and Mexico. Vegetar
ians beware! Your selections from
the dinner menu might be limited
to just one. The entire eating ex
perience is well worth the $8- $15
that you might spend on a meal.
Located at the intersection of Sky
line and Highway 84, at 17288
Skyline Blvd. in Woodside, Alice's
Restaurant is open Mon. through
Thurs. from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., Fri.
and Sat. from 8:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.
and Sun. from 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.
851-0303.
Cafe for All Seasons Per
haps the brainchild of Res Ed and
multiculturalism, this restaurant
offers dishes from a wide variety
of cultures and countries, letting
your taste buds go international.
Go hungry (the portions are
enormous) and try some of the
standard American dishes, or go

crazy and check out the flavorful
Greek salad. Cafe for All Seasons
is moderately priced, with meals
ranging from about $7 to $13.
The restaurant is pleasantly locat
ed at 271 University Ave., and is
open Mon. through Thurs. from
11 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., Fri. from

a.m. to 10 p.m., and Sun. 10 a.m.
to 9 p.m. 321-4144.
Gordon Blersch Brewing
Company Ooh, the smell of
freshly brewed beer in the air. Yep,
this cafe and bar is extremely pop
ular on weekends, and the reason
is clear as you encounter the fresh
beer and classy ambiance. This
place is frequented by the young
professionals who are looking to
mingle. The fare here is a combi
nation of typical beer hall and Cal
ifornia cuisine, but your best bet is
to stick with the burgers and fries.
Definitely upscale from the usual
beer hall, Gordon Biersch will

probably cost you $6 to $12 for a
meal. Located 640 Emerson St.in
Palo Alto, Gordon Biersch Brew
ing Company is open Sun.
through Thurs. from 11 a.m. to 10
p.m., Fri. and Sat. 11 a.m. to 11
p.m. The bar is open even later.
323-7723.
Blue Sky Cafe and Flower
Bar Arguably even more Cali
fornian than the grass shots of
fered at the Juice Club, Blue Sky
offers their own twist on the
boundaries of the edible with their
literally flowery cuisine. The food
here is light and tasty, with dishes
that offer a variation from the tra
ditional, like salads with fruity
dressings. At the end of this cozy
and intimate dining experience,
you'll have to pay the hefty sum of
$10 to $25 per meal. Blue Sky Cafe
and Flower Bar can be found at
336 Bryant St.in Mountain View,
and is open seven days a week from
8 a.m. to 10 p.m. 961-2082.
