# 1898-1994: From ‘At the Gay Coney Island' to 'Natural Born Gaieties'

campusoefore Big Game," explains another.
These Ram's Head veterans are talking, of
course, about Gaieties, the one time of the
year when Stanford students get to laugh at
themselves, at Cal and at what constitutes

”In Galetles '91 a Pro Fro goes wide-eyed

Stanford life.
"Gaieties is about seeing your own college
experience up on the stage acted out by that
guy who always said stupid things in CIV
section, and recognizing your shared exis
tence in the universe — you both got a 'B' in
CIV anyway," said Dan Goldman, last year's
director, and now a writer.
Big Game Gaieties is the original, student
written and produced musical parody that
runs the week of Big Game. A mixture of
laughter, music, and dance, Gaieties pre
miered at Memorial Auditorium last night,
and will be performed again tonight and Fri
day night.
"Everything in Gaieties is funny," said Jeff

Meador, Executive Producer of Ram's Head
Theatrical Society, which produces Gaieties.
"Audiences come wanting to have a good
time, and we provide them just that. They
give the performances the extra boost of en
ergy to take the show over the top each night."
Full of pop culture and inside jokes, Gai
eties takes a satirical look at Stanford.
"It's all about energy and enthusiasm,"
said stage manager Alison Duxbury.

'CIV professor as
Bbeneier Scrooge?'
■SWSVIhe Gaieties writers started work
-J_i| J ing on the script in the spring,
headed up by co-head writers
John Bagdanoff and Scarlett Higgins.
"The first meeting was at Denny's, of
course, and we just basically sat around steal
ing each other's fries and shooting the shit
about what we thought was funny at Stan
ford," Goldman said.
Goldman recalled being surrounded by a
dozen "hysterically funny" people shouting
out things they wanted in the show.
"What if your CIV professor were

Ebenezer
Scrooge? I
wonder if the
clock tower
was wrong
back in 1892?
What if we had
theme houses
like 'lowa
House,' 'Bad
Sitcom Theme
House,' 'Disco
Theme House'
and 'Nihilism
Theme
House?"

"There was a scene In 'Full
Frontal Gaieties' ('9l) when the
techles filled a recycling bin
with Ice. An actor was put In
the bin during a scene and had
to suffer through this on-stage
for 10 minutes. He was a great
sport and we ail had a great
laugh."
— Alison Duxbury,
four-year veteran of Gaieties

Goldman said. "I was laughing so hard I
nearly passed out, and I realized if I had to
die just then, at least I didn't die at
Wendy's."
Gaieties started out as burlesque, in the
tradition of vaudeville. A few jokes here, a
few songs there, maybe a couple of pretty
young women prancing around... Ln recent
years, it has become more plot-oriented, a
path taken by Broadway musicals them
selves.
The show changes every year, but there a
few recurring characters.
"For the past four years, ever since we did
'Into the Woods' in '91, we have given our sa
cred milky white cow a cameo appearance,"
Meador said.
Aside from the celebrity appearances,
other traditions include the band playing at
the end of the show, and a "Branner sucks"
line.
"We love this line, because it sends every
one into hysterical fits of chanting and
screaming. I remember two years ago how
Branner managed to stop the show for ten
minutes with all of its chanting," Meador
said.
'You tcilloA my student.
Prepare to die/
fWSJ n the past, Stanford celebrities such
as the University President and the
■Jmb> Dean of Undergraduate Admissions,
James Montoya, have made guest appear
ances.
One of Meador's favorite sketches was one
which involved a duel between a Stanford
and a Cal student. The Cal student won by
cheating, and killed the Stanford student.
Montoya came out with a huge axe and con
fronted the Cal student: "My name is James
Montoya. You killed my student. Prepare to
die."
"Everyone was on the floor laughing
every night," Meador said. "Montoya has
wonderful comic timing and audiences love
him."
Another favorite sketch of Meador's
featured a cameo by then-President Don
Kennedy. A Weenie from Cal was trying
to infiltrate the ranks of the "Quadfa
ther," played by Kennedy. When
Kennedy faked a heart attack on-stage,
the Weenie impostor yelled, "Quick! Get
this man to Cowell Student Health Cen
ter!"
In reply, Kennedy popped back up and

said, "Aha! Only a Weenie would send a
dying man to Cowell!"
"Through Gaieties, I saw these two
University big-wigs coming down to the
theater and hanging out with students and
making jokes," Meador said.

"Everyone,
even the ad
ministration,
knows that the
show is pure
fun. Seeing
Montoya and
Casper ham it
up my frosh
year made me
realize how
fun everyone
could be at
Stanford."
Gaieties vet
eran Ingrid
Hoffman's fa
vorite Gaieties
moment also
involves a Uni
versity Presi
dent.
"My favorite
memory is
President
Casper ex
plaining to me

in the green room his shock at seeing a naked
man in the orchestra pit," Hoffman said.
The "naked man" — or man in various
states of undress, to be exact — has been a
regular recurrence at Gaieties for the last
three years, ever since now-senior Mike
Oristian played the piano for and made a
cameo appearance that made "Full Frontal
Gaieties" live up to its name.

"ln 'Full Frontal Gaieties,' we had a scans that was a
game show, 'The $25,000 Pyramid Jeopardy Jack
pot Wad,' or something like that. It unft of course,
Stanford vs. Cal. One of the playets for Cal was
named 'asshole In a bear suit.'.. ■ Cal fans rushed
the stage, and a referee came out and declared a
delay of game against Cal. Stanford, of course,
came back to win the game, Just like Big Game '90.
That scene used a bunch of events that everyone

on campus knew, and used them In such an unexpected way that the scene
was hysterical."
— Jeff Meador, executive producer of Ram's Head

'Natural Born Oaietits'
ea<^or sa 'd this year's show a
"very plot-based production,"
has the "best darned script"
he has ever read.
Auditions were held last month and a cast
of 40 or so was selected. The actors have re
hearsed for the past five weeks.
"This year the technical staff is having fun
trying to outdo itself," Meador said. "They
make the show fun to watch; past years have
seen everything from disco balls to trap
doors to a self-erecting Hoover Tower."
Meador delivered all-around praise for
the writing, artistic, and production staff.
"Without the energy of these people, Gai
eties would cease to exist," he said.
Earlier this week, as he prepared for the
last few hectic days before opening night,
Meador recalled another "favorite" Gaieties
tradition. "Usually the last dress rehearsal is

a show for the band, since they don't get to
see it,"he said. "So the band gets to heckle
the cast — they were almost in tears last
year. But it's fun in a sort of masochistic
way."
Gaieties has provided a lot of people, in
cluding Goldman, with unforgettable mo
ments:
"Gaieties always make me think of clos-

ing night '91 — finishing the last perfor
mance ever of 'Full Frontal Gaieties,' run
ning into the audience as the Band began to
play in a confined space never meant for a
marching band, starting a conga line with
the cast, touching the Axe as it was led tri
umphantly through the aisles, and jumping
with 2,000 other people in a single room at
just the right moment when the Band final
ly played 'All Right Now.'
"They tell me Cal has a barbecue during
Big Game week. Where would you rather
be?"«
