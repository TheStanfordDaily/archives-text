## Technology task force looks at video learning and software for education 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
With an eye toward the 21st
century, members of the Commis
sion on Technology in Teaching
and Learning brainstormed ideas
last night about policies Stanford
could use to improve the use of
technology in all facets of the Uni
versity.
The commission — which Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
introduced last spring as a
keynote of his State of the Uni
versity address — is charged with
studying how Stanford can enrich
its teaching and learning through
technology.
The commission heard reports
from six subcommittees: infra
structure and support services;
instructional software; outreach
to high schools and community
colleges; alliances with business
es, governments, and industries;
coalitions with other universities,
libraries, and professional soci
eties; and continuing education.
James Gibbons, dean of the
School of Engineering, also spoke

at the meeting about his work
with tutored video instruction.
According to Commission Co
ordinator Patricia Devaney, one
of the basic questions that the
commission must ask itself is,
"What will people demand from
education in the next decade?"
The commission hopes to use
informational resources to in
crease faculty productivity, en
gage the brightest high school
students and improve students'
learning. "We need to find out
what applications are needed by
the University and not simply cre
ate applications that will go un
used," Devaney said.
Some of the subcommittee pro
posals include early outreach to
talented high school students
through electronic mail services
and video course learning.
"One thing we're looking at is a
program that will target top re
cruits by providing them with a
Stanford undergraduate as a
mentor," said Devaney. "Another
possibility is to create an early ad
missions program that would
allow students admitted in their
junior year of high school to pur
sue Stanford courses during their
senior year and come into the
school with at least sophomore
standing."
Geoffrey Cox, vice provost for
institutional planning and
another commission member,
said he hoped Stanford could
offer instructional opportuni
ties to students still in high
school in order to challenge and

prepare them for higher educa
tion.
One way to begin the process
of providing instruction to off
campus students is through
tutored video instruction. In this
process, developed by Gibbons,
students watch a videotaped lec
ture with a tutor present. Any
time students have questions the
tape is stopped, and the tutor
helps the students with any prob
lems they are having.
"This separates the dissemina
tion of material from the actual
learning of the material," Gib
bons said. "It is focused on the
lecture but you are able to pre
cede at your own pace."
