# Spanning the twentieth century, a Gaieties timeline
## 
### 
1898 — Meant as a rally before The Big
Game, the first production of Gaieties is
staged. "At the Gay Coney Island" features
songs, dances, skits, and jokes.
1907 — The football show, entitled "The
College Widower," is a two-act burlesque
presented after the game.
1911 — Ram's Head is formed to "encour
age local talent" and "foster production of
original work in all light dramatic lines."
Big Game Gaieties' first show is "Football
Follies," a parody of Broadway's "Ziegfield
Follies."
1922 — Entitled "Football Frothies," the
show follows the adventures of Jack, a Har
vard transfer who can't decide what to
major in. He eventually decides to major in
love, and spends the rest of the show look
ing for the right girl. The Big Game, against
the Bruins, results in a Stanford victory.
1927 — With 16 of the "most beautiful
women on the campus," the revue empha
sizes short, clever numbers, rather than a
few long acts.
1929 — The title is "60 Giddy Girls —
Count 'em — 60." Women's lib, anyone?
1936 — A few days after a Roosevelt land
slide, Gaieties is completely sold-out. A
combination of farce and drama, the show's
score is hailed by its director as the "best
yet."
1939 — Gaieties stars preview to a San
Francisco audience. Student-written songs
include "Why Don't You Leave Me Alone?"
and "So Long Ago."
1940 — After four years in Berkeley, the
Axe is back in the Farm. Nazi squadrons
bomb Birmingham. The world's at war, but
the show must go on. Tunes for the show
range from romantic songs to patter and
satiric lyrics.
1943 — "At Ease." Profits go to War Bonds.
During war years, the show was produced

and directed almost entirely by women.
1944 — Due to the war, no show.
1945 — Gaieties returns with "How the
Navy Ought to Be."
1947 — As years go by, "skirts lengths
shorten and the Gaieties girls come into the
picture," the Daily reported. "Of course we
don't want to exploit sex," the director ex
plained, "but the show will now have a lot
of chorus girls performing during the ap
propriate moments."
1951 — Big Game Gaieties opens for its
31st year. Sketches include "Gone with the
Windski," Ram's Head's version of the Mar
garet Mitchell classic as if written by Tol
stoy. Songs include "Who the Hell Cares."
1953 — Ticket prices are $.75, $ 1, and $
1.25. The 14-scene production features
such numbers as "Tea for Schmidt," a bur
lesque on German spies who undermine
British Air Force command during WWII.
The show's noted for an "unusually large
number of costume changes for the cast of
100."
1965 — "Blue and Goldfinger." Described
as an original thriller in the tradition of
James Bond, the show deals with a terror
organization at Cal whose leader is a dia
bolical computer with a plan to R. F. Stan
ford. Characters include Jimmy Bond,
Lotta Love, Harry Byrd, and "Bebe."
1968 — The originally scheduled Gaieties
show "never materialized," according to a
Daily report. The Broadway show "A Funny
Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"
is presented instead.
1971 — The final performance of Gaieties
for six years. According to a Daily review,
the show was a "less than a popular parody
of 'Dracula,' featuring the show's theme
song 'Trannsylvania* sung to the tune of
'Oklahoma.' "1978 co-director Gary Fur
long said, "Students then would rather

throw bricks through a window than do a
musical show."
1977 — With a heightened interest in the
production of Gaieties, the show makes a
return attempt. The attempt, according to a
Daily report, was a "huge success as rekin
dled student interest resulted in an encore
performance."
1978 — Ticket sales for all three perfor
mances soar. "Many years ago, Gaieties was
seen in conjunction with the bonfire and
the Big Game. Now, it is being accepted
completely in its own merits and that's
what will keep it going," said co-director
Furlong.
1983 — "Raiders of the Lost Axe" spans the
history of Stanford, from the death of little
Leland to little Herbie (Hoover) singing
"Supply Side." It ended with a futuristic
view of Big Game in the 21st century. Jokes
needled everything from Branner hall
freshmen to the Wells Fargo Bank. The cli
max was a scene in the football players'
locker room.
1985 — "Poltergaieties" features a "clueless
frosh" in love with a "bitch" from Berkeley
who's been assigned to head a Band kid
napping. Meanwhile, ghosts from the Le
land Stanford family escape from the Mau
soleum and at one point, they're zapped to
another dimension by a Bible-thumping
TV evangelist. Walk-on characters include
Columbo, Charlie's Angels, and a valley girl
Nancy Drew ("The answer is soooo obvi
ous").
1990- In "Anachrophobia," we find the ro
mantic pairing of a schizophrenic resident
assistant and a 120-year old freshman. Tra
ditional format of loosely related sketches
replaced with a single unified plot. "With a
whole show we could do more than just,
'the post office is slow.' We could tell a story
worth hearing," explained the director. ■
