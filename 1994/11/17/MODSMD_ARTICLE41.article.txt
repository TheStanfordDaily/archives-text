Most of "I Don't Want To Talk About It"
emanates a deceptively charming glow as
67-year-old writer-director Maria I.uisa
Bemberg unveils the film's mildly unusual
premise, set in provincial 1940s Argentina.
Widowed Leonor (Luisina Brando) is
fiercely protective of her only daughter
Charlotte (Alejandra Podest&), who will
never grow taller than her two-feet seven
inches. Having burnt all books — "Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs," "Gulliver's
Travels" — that even hinted at Charlotte's
own condition, Leonor spared no expenses
in molding Charlotte into the most refined
and educated 15-year-old in town.
Enter the dashing, single millionaire Lu-

I Don't Want to Talk About It

dovico (Marcello Mastroianni), whose per
sonal history the tongue-wagging commu
nity fails to ascertain. Sharing with Char
lotte his worldly experiences in conversa
tion, Ludovico finds her an intellectual
equal, and afterward shocks everyone, in
cluding himself, by falling in love with her.
Exquisitely photographed by Felix
Monti, the film is picture-perfect, be it the
decorative detailing of its interiors or the

carefully hand-picked waterfront locations.
Nevertheless, although the director is
clearly after the effect of magical realism to
lift her unlikely tale into extraordinary
realms, she relies too heavily on aesthetic ar
tifice and stops short of weaving a genuine
ly mythical spell over her creation.
Indeed, l.udovico's mysterious moment
of reckoning about his feelings for Charlotte
comes across as clumsily contrived and
woefully inadequate — a flash of white light
dazzles him as he watches her ride in the
barn. Likewise, l.udovico's fatalistic streak
that manages to coax forth a couple of em
barrassed giggles, but does little else to illu
minate the story's development.
Within such limitations, Mastroianni
does well to balance his signature brand of

suaveness with a sense
of dignified infatuation.
Arguably, the choice of

Mastroianni ("La Dolce Vita," "8-1/2") con
stitutes part of Bemberg's tribute to Fellini,
whose famous symbolic gestures are in
abundance here — the whimsical Rota-in
spired music score, a colorful carnival pro
cession and multiple caricatures of provin
cial bourgeoisie.
Ultimately though, despite persuasive
turns by Brando and Podesta, "I Don't Want
To Talk About It" remains unconvincing by
serving up a conclusion that alienates most
of what came before it. While ridiculing
human preoccupation with self-denial, Be
mberg makes a case for predestination that
is too flimsy to convert many.
