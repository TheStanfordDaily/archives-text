# 'Wellville' may induce nausea
## 
### 
The sad thing is that I love movies. Really. 1
can't think of a single movie I've hated. But as
I sat through "The Road to Wellville' last
week, the only thing that kept me from walk
ing out of the theater was my job.
The film, directed by Alan Parker, has an
absurd non-plot centered around creator-of
the-cornflake John Kellogg (played by Antho
ny Hopkins) and a controversial health spa he
developed around the turn of the century. The
primary teaching at the Battlecreek Sanitari
um is that you can live forever by taking good
care of your digestive track. This produces two
hours worth of defecation jokes, like the sign
hanging in the spa's dining hall which reads,
"Clean bowels make for clean thoughts."
Though this humor is plenty nauseating, its
real offense is that it just isn't funny. At all.
It's completely beyond me how this script
managed to lure the talents of Hopkins, Brid
get Fonda, Matthew Broderick, John Cusack
and Dana Carvey.
Fonda and Broderick play Eleanor and Will
Lightbody, a young, troubled couple who go
to Kellogg's Sanitarium in hopes of purging
their bodies and souls to save their marriage.
Instead, Will begins a twisted affair with a fel-

The Road to Wellville

low patient while Eleanor turns to sexual ful
fillment from an "alternative doctor."
Cusack and Carvey have their own bewil
dering storyline in which they try to manufac
ture a new breakfast cereal but end up stealing
both Kellogg's name and then his product.
This, too, is unbelievable and not the slightest
bit intriguing. Academy Award-winning
Hopkins is very far removed from the digni
fied roles in "Remains of the Day"and "Shad
owlands" that won him acclaim. In this
comedic venture as the buck-toothed cereal
mogul who is flakier than his product, Hop
kins is zany and engaging, but degrades him
self with his vulgar subject matter.
This movie had no point, no humor, com
pletely unrealistic characters, misplaced death
scenes, a ridiculous ending and grotesque dis
plays of bodily functions from start to finish.
Far from being an elixir, "The Road to
Wellville" just made me sick.
