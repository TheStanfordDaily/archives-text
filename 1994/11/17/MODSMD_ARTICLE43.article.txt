## Better than usual holiday fare 
### 
The workaholic dad be
comes Santa Claus and in
the process learns to be a
better father. Even with a
silly and unrealistic
premise working against
it, the creative and engag
ing plot makes "The Santa
Clause" a movie that's
more than watchable. The
special effects which
transform star Tim Allen,

The Santa Clause

in his first motion picture, into St. Nick are in
credibly realistic and not to be missed.
The plot revolves around Scott Calvin
(Allen), a toy company executive who shares
custody of his son, Charlie, with his ex-wife.
