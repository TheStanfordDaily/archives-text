## Better than usual holiday fare 
### 
The workaholic dad be
comes Santa Claus and in
the process learns to be a
better father. Even with a
silly and unrealistic
premise working against
it, the creative and engag
ing plot makes "The Santa
Clause" a movie that's
more than watchable. The
special effects which
transform star Tim Allen,

The Santa Clause

in his first motion picture, into St. Nick are in
credibly realistic and not to be missed.
The plot revolves around Scott Calvin
(Allen), a toy company executive who shares
custody of his son, Charlie, with his ex-wife.

custody of his son, Charlie with his ex-wife.
Scott and his son aren't very close, but spend
Christmas Eve together anyway. After a disas
trous night, Allen and Charlie are awakened
when a man dressed as Santa Claus falls from
the roof. Scott searches the man's coat pockets
and finds a card telling him to put the coat on
and the reindeer will do the rest.
When he follows the directions, Santa
evaporates and Scott and Charlie are taken to
the North Pole where they decipher a final
clause — that the wearer of Santa's suit be
comes the Santa Claus. Suddenly Scott begins
to gain weight in order to truly fill Santa's
shoes (and jacket). And in the process of
learning how to be Santa, Scott is also taught
a lesson about the value of faith.
The comedy in"The Santa Clause" is more
biting than the typical holiday fare. Some of

the jokes about divorce may go over the heads
of children. This gives older viewers .1 reason
to watch, while children will enjoy the slap
stick comedy.
But both groups are sure to be impressed
by the amazing special effects pulled off in the
film. The scenes where Allen is shown to ex
pand into his Santa Claus-sized stomach —
thanks to movie magic and lots of latex —
come off as funny and well done.
On the acting side, Allen delivers a strong
performance, reaching an emotional level be
yond that of Tim Taylor, the character he
plays on "Home Improvement." He lets down
the macho "Tool Time" image and allows his
character to show love for his son.
" The Santa Clause" isn't as hokey or con
trived as many holiday movies tend to be. It's
sentimental, but not so much as to over
whelm the rest of the movie. For a relaxing
and amusing break from holiday shopping,
check out "The Santa Clause."
