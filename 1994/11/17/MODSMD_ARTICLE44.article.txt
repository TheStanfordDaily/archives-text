# Linda Fiorentino both seduces and uses men in John Dahl's ‘The Last Seduction'

The root of all evil. These are the words that
leap instantly to mind when one thinks of Brid
get Gregory. Played with over-the-top sinister
glee by I.inda Fiorentino, Bridget is the fiendish
center of "The Last Seduction," and is without
doubt the biggest bitch to visit a theatre near
you since Sharon Stone wielded an ice pick.
The latest film-noir offering from acclaimed
"Red Rock West" director John Dahl, "The
I.ast Seduction" is a dark, rather twisted telling
of the machinations of a dark, absolutely
twisted woman. Bridget and her doctor hus
band Clay are frustrated and disheartened by
their financial situation and the cost of living in
New York.
Ever the icons of morality, they decide to
pull a one-time drug deal, thinking it will place
them in the lap of luxury and pay off their

loans, after which they would return to being
good people. Unfortunately for Clay, Bridget
decides to take the money and run, leaving him
in the none-too-gentie hands of the thumb
breaking loan sharks to whom the couple owes
money. Thus begins the game of wits and will
that becomes "The Last Seduction."
Delivering an entertaining performance,
Fiorentino plays Bridget with a great deal of
gusto. However, it's a bit implausible that one
person could be so completely black-hearted,
and the more terrible Bridget becomes, the

more unrealistic the portrayal seems.
She is especially cruel in her dealings with
Mike, the sweet, naive pawn who becomes
besotted with Bridget. Despite his repeated
attempts at affection and conversation, Brid

get uses him brutally, first for sex and later to
further her dastardly plot. Her coldness at
one point drives Mike to scream, "You make
me feel like a 4-H experiment!"
Nonetheless, she pushes his buttons with
such skill that he ends up dancing to her tune
right down to the last frame.
Whatever the scheme, everything falls
right into place for Bridget. So much so that

the movie loses part of its credibility as the
plot intricacies unfold just a little too per
fectly for to be believed.
For all its flaws, however, "The Last Se
duction" is a fast-paced and fun trip. Bill
Pullman provides Clay with the right combi
nation of humor and slime and Peter Berg
manages to not appear completely pathetic
while he's ruthlessly gutted and coldly

screwed over as Mike.
But it is Fiorentino who is the soul (even
if she's sold it) of the film, inspiring com
ments like, "Anybody check you for a heart
beat lately?" Fiorentino's performance,
while not subtle by any means, is terrifically
nasty. She may be the root of all evil, but it's
always nice to see a woman get ahead.
