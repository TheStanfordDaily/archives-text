# Mamet offers strikingly relevant rendition

Imagine writing a paper on a topic
that you really care about, spending
hours and days slaving over the paper,
attempting to address the topic as fully
as possible, aiming for absolute perfec
tion even though you don't entirely un
derstand the question. Imagine invest
ing your intellectual and emotional

Oleanna

trust in the suggestions the professor
gives you. Then imagine failing the
paper anyway. How would you react?
"Oleanna," directed and written by

David Mamet, is a screen adaptation of
the play which has caused controversy
since its opening in 1992. The movie,
starring William H. Macy as the profes
sor, John, and Debra Eisenstadt as the
student, Carol, is exceedingly loyal to
the theatrical version. John and Carol

= only if it's free
= if you've got the money to spare
= certainly worth your while
= a can't-miss

are the only two characters with speaking
roles and the changes between scenes and
acts are clearly delineated with brief
fillers(such as scenes of students walking
down halls).
"Oleanna" is not an easy movie to watch
or think about. There is no hero, no whirl
wind plot. Yet one becomes fully engaged in
the intricacies of the movie. "Oleanna" pos
sesses subtlety and assumes the intelligence
of its viewer. It forces the those watching to
make difficult judgments about the charac
ters and the issues it raises. "Oleanna" is no
torious for leaving its viewers arguing about
the abstract concepts it embraces.
This movie is replete with issues such as
the value of higher education, what consti
tutes sexual harassment and even rape, polit
ical correctness, and the balances of power.

The movie's purpose is not to please the
viewer; rather, it challenges and provokes.
The film begins with Carol confronting
John about a grade. John apparently thinks
higher education is worthless; Carol, who is
from a lower-middle class background and
has struggled to go to college, is appalled by
his ideas. The topic of her performance in the
class is barely approached.
The next few scenes address the results of
the initial conversation. Carol first files a
complaint with the tenure committee alleg
ing that John abused his privileges as a
teacher. Later, she charges him with rape. As
both characters are alternately demonized, it
is never clear if either of them is morally right.
"Oleanna" is a wonderful and tense depic
tion of the explosion of a fairly normal expe
rience into something uncontrollable. In the
aftermath of the Anita Hill hearings, "Olean
na" 's portrayal of sexual harassment affects
the viewer with its harsh relevance.
