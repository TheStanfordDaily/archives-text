## Echobelly, Pizzicato Five rely on image 
### 
Somewhere along the line, an ingenious
advertising pro came up with the phrase,
"Image is everything," creating a clever way to
gloss over substance with style. Lately, it
seems that what works in the world of com
mercials has carried over to the (commercial)
music world, where image has become, if not
everything, at least something more than the
music itself.
About Britain's daily special — Echobelly
— the introductory blurb of a Melody Maker
Magazine feature 011 the band says it all, de
crying that the eclectic quintet is "making our
tiny island seem like the most fashionable
place 011 earth again." All this hype, yet not
one mention of the band's sound.
True to form, there's no lire, only smoke
with Echobelly, the latest idle threat to the

rock-and-roll throne from the UK. Though
the band packs a good visceral wallop 011 its
debut, "Everybody's Got One," that punch

doesn't sting for long. Even on the album's
better offerings, "Insomniac" and "Call Me

scratches the skin but no deeper.
At the heart of the problem is singer Sonya

lyrics beyond the level of blathering rhetoric, a
flaw which is especially clear on the deceptive
ly catchy "Give Her a Gun."
The band's fleeting beauty fails to convince
the listener that much more lies beyond
what's on the surface, never proving that style
is backed up by substance. Maybe it's because
we've already heard the Echobelly recipe of a

smidgen of Smiths
and a dash of Suede
in its happier in-

stances, together with a few "Metal Mickey"
moments and a generous portion of Brit atti
tude. Or that when a frown and a whine are
less than a real frown and a real whine, there's
no compelling reason to listen.
Figuring out Pizzicato l-'ive is a lot more
difficult, because style is substance and vice
versa for the flashy Japanese dance-pop sensa
tion. Which goes to say that the trio's Ameri
can debut, "Made in USA," is either extreme
ly shallow and manipulative or pretty damn
near to brilliant. After listening to their radio
