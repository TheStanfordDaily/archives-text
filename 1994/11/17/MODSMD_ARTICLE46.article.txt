## Echobelly, Pizzicato Five rely on image 
### 
Somewhere along the line, an ingenious
advertising pro came up with the phrase,
"Image is everything," creating a clever way to
gloss over substance with style. Lately, it
seems that what works in the world of com
mercials has carried over to the (commercial)
music world, where image has become, if not
everything, at least something more than the
music itself.

Magazine feature 011 the band says it all, de
crying that the eclectic quintet is "making our
tiny island seem like the most fashionable
place 011 earth again." All this hype, yet not
one mention of the band's sound.
True to form, there's no lire, only smoke

better offerings, "Insomniac" and "Call Me

scratches the skin but no deeper.

lyrics beyond the level of blathering rhetoric, a
flaw which is especially clear on the deceptive
ly catchy "Give Her a Gun."
The band's fleeting beauty fails to convince
the listener that much more lies beyond
what's on the surface, never proving that style
is backed up by substance. Maybe it's because
we've already heard the Echobelly recipe of a

smidgen of Smiths
and a dash of Suede
in its happier in-

stances, together with a few "Metal Mickey"
moments and a generous portion of Brit atti
tude. Or that when a frown and a whine are
less than a real frown and a real whine, there's
no compelling reason to listen.
Figuring out Pizzicato l-'ive is a lot more
difficult, because style is substance and vice
versa for the flashy Japanese dance-pop sensa
tion. Which goes to say that the trio's Ameri
can debut, "Made in USA," is either extreme
ly shallow and manipulative or pretty damn
near to brilliant. After listening to their radio


hit "Twiggy, Twiggy / Twiggy vs. James
Bond" one's inclined to opt for the latter.
The infectious dance tune seamlessly
mixes together a hodgepodge of trash cul
ture allusions, placing a sample copped from
the majestic "Hawaii Five-O" theme next to
some gibberish about Twiggy and her mini
skirt, all backed a jumping, throbbing bass

groove and some chirping electronic thingy.
They then throw in a swaggering organ bit
and some sped-up bossanova beats and
which they mix into the thundering flow of
the song. Give Pizzicato Five ample credit
for turning such junk into a fresh and vi
brant song with even more bite than its loud
bark.
If anything, the charisma of "Twiggy,
Twiggy" makes it even harder to deal with
the band. Sure, you'll grow to dig the song
and much of the album, though the sense

that you're missing the joke lingers, il only
because almost all of "Made in USA" is sung
in Japanese. It's pop culture in all its glory,
but just what culture Pizzicato Five repre
sents never becomes clear.
Still, that the band can make a dent in
whatever barriers are in its way hints that
they are more than just all glitter. So what it
