## Aerosmith's 'Big' greatest hits album BIG ONES chronicles the best of the last sevenyears 
### 
Not many bands could get away with pro
ducing more than one greatest hits album.
But Aerosmith's latest release, "big Ones,"
brings together the seven years of music the
group has released since it signed on with Clef
fen Records, proving that the aging band is still
very much alive.
The group's longevity breaks the album free
from the glitzy self-indulgent stigma which
surround most bands' attempts to capitalize on
past successes.
Instead of coming off as a money-making
venture, "Big Ones" is more of an anthology ot
Aerosmith's best songs since the hand resur
rected itself from the depths of unpopularity
back in 1987.

Amid the group's
rush to put out an
album and go on such
an extensive summer
time tour, Aerosmith
managed to bundle two
previously unre 1 eased
songs which reveal a
vastly different charac
ter from much of the
group's earlier work.

"Big Ones"
Aerosmith

That is not to say that Steven Tyler is break
ing away from his energetic approach to mak
ing music. On the contrary, the band's new
songs steer clear of slower ballads like "Crazy"
and "Cryin*" which marked its most recent
hits.
"Blind Man," one of the pair of new songs,
brings the album to life, as it harkens back to
the days of the "Pump" album and earlier,
when Aerosmith often shied away from exper
imentation in favor of simpler harmonies be
tween the guitar and Tyler's voice.
In this way, the song complements the rest
of the album. You can almost see Tyler dancing
across the stage, moving his body in time with
the music and taunting the people in the front
row of the audience — an experience that re
minds you just how powerful Aerosmith's
music is.
