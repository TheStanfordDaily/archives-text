# Lords bring nothing new, but still hip
## 
### 
Straight out of Newark, New Jersey the
Lords of the Underground are comin' atcha
with the same ole' funk. But surprisingly, it's
still cool.
Doitall, Mr. Funke, and DJ Lord Jazz hit
the music scene in 1993 with their debut
album, "Here Comes the Lords." The group's
record sales must have pleased them because
their second album, "Keepers of the Funk,"
should be titled "Here Comes the Lords Fart
II." The album uses the same jazz undertones
combined with the clever lyrical skills that
brought them prominence in the music in
dustry with their debut album.
The album's first single, "Tick Tock," reeks
of the Underground sound, leaving listeners
with the cooled-out, you-can-nod-ya-head
to feel.
The Lords added an interesting twist to
their second album in a song titled "Faith."

"Keepers of the Funk"
Lords of the Underground

The cut offers a religious tone from a group
that demonstrates it is okay not to he so
hardcore. Unfortunately, The Lords didn't go
to such great pains with the rest of their
songs. The message in "Faith" is about as
deep as the album gets, while during the rest,
the trio boasts about their own lyrical skills.
Like they're all of that?
The truth is the album is cool. But listeners
and fans of The Lords of the Underground
may feel cheated because the "Keepers of the
Funk" kept the funk exactly like it was.
