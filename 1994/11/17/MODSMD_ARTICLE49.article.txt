turally Aware Music for Soft-Rock Radio Sta
tions." It is much more likely to be wafting
softly in the background of a Portola Valley
dinner party than taken as a reverent tribute
to Native American musical influences.
Although this latest output is a com-

bined effort with
The Red Road
Ensemble, a
group of Native
American musi
cians, the music

is not (stereo)typically Native American. The
general feel is similar to most any recent
work that purports to make use of non-tra
ditional (in terms of the American music in-

dustry) musical cultures and traditions.
For the most part, the fluid mellifluousity
that characterizes the 12 songs is more of a
hybrid sound that mixes the pulsing, surre
alistic candlelight style of Enigma and the
(so-marketed) soothing rhythms of
Guatemalan Rainforest Watermusic. Many
songs utilize the Laurie Anderson-like
breathiness of female backup singers and
programmed music reminiscent of Peter
Gabriel's artistry. And although this occa
sionally works in translating the spirituality
of Native American culture on audio, it usu
ally results in producing only an Enya-like
musical flow.
"Cherokee Morning Song" and "Ancestor
Song" are the two tracks that are clearly

identifiable as Native American music. The
pounding drums and chanting voices reflect
the emotion of a people that have a much

more land-based philosophy.
This spirituality, and the history of

the oppression of the different

tribes, is of utmost importance

for Robertson who is himself

of Native American her

itage. He is much more
concerned with providing
an educational experience

than an actual and genuine |
one. "Ghost Dance" is
doubly useful. Not only

does it give the history of the
1890 massacre at Wounded

Knee, it describes the different

mindfrarm of the Sioux and the

white man. As the song illustrates, the Sioux
did not value what the government

preached: "You can kill my body / You can
damn my soul / For not believing in your
god."

Although Native American spirituality,

culture, tradition, and history

are more than worth not

only preserving but per

haps also advocating

Robertson's "Music
for The Native Amer

icans" is not particu
larly helpful in either

112 respect. But for those
consumers who want

to feel good about buy
ing a culturally direct

Ed album to put next to

their rainforest music with

out pondering Native Ameri

can culture, then this is a fine choice.
