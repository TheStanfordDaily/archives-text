Stanford Law Prof. Thomas
Grey and renowned attorney and
author Edward Cleary engaged in
a heated debate about content
based speech regulations — espe
cially on college campuses — yes
terday afternoon in the Law
School.
Grey who wrote the "Grey In
terpretation" of the school's Fun
damental Standard, argued "we
have to deal on this campus, in a
legal matter and a moral matter,
with preventing discrimination,"
he said.

The Grey Interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard prohibits
speech which "is intended to in
sult or stigmatize an individual
... on the basis of their sex, race,
color, handicap, religion, sexual
orientation, or national and eth
nic origin; and is addressed direct
ly to the individual. .. whom it in
sults; and makes use of insulting
or 'fighting' words or non-verbal
symbols."
The Grey Interpretation is cur
rently under attack by a group of
students who claims that it is un
constitutional. The group
recently filed suit, and the case is
now pending while the parties
prepare more information.
Cleary was an attorney in the
recent R.A.V., petitioner vs. City
of St. Paul, Minn., case in which
the Supreme Court ruled in his
favor that "hate speech" — in
the form of a burning cross — is
protected under the First
Amendment. He argued that
schools, including Stanford,
should abolish all speech codes.
"The real issue is of political
correctness," Cleary said. "In
the long-run, punishing offen
sive speech is simply counter
productive."
Offensive ideas and speech
are legal in the real world, Cleary
said, adding that "the school
environment should not be arti
ficial."
But Grey responded by say
ing, "1 think the provision here

is legal, should be held as legal,
and more importantly I think it
is right."
Stanford's code is very nar
row, applying only to "gutter epi
thets" directed at a certain indi
vidual with the intent to discrim
inate, Grey said.
"We have a University policy
to prevent discrimination
against our students, and this is
part of the way to fight discrimi
nation," Grey said.
But Cleary, who recently
wrote "Beyond the Burning
Cross: The First Amendment
and the Landmark R.A.V
Case," responded by arguing
that there is a distinction
between offensive speech and
d> 'crimination.
Tiie debate, presented by
Stanford's campus Federalist
Party, attracted about 90 people,
mostly law students.
"I came here on the side of
Cleary, but left on the side of
Grey," said first-year law stu
dent Marc Leibowitz. "The nar
rowness of the code protects
what needs to be protected."
