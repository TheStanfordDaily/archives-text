The Basics have definitely discovered their
musical niche, but they're still doing quite a bit
of soul-searching.
In "Haven Road," their third album in four
years, Stanford grads Kelly Colbert Baynham
and Drew Baynham, together with Drew Ro
bilio, continue to write and perform the same
clean Christian, light rock which characterized
their first two releases. The album's lyrics, both
inspired and inspiring, touch on many of the
same themes as their previous works did — rela
tionships, love and, as always, the process of self
actualization.

"Haven Road"
The Basics

ships with Christian overtones, although not to
an extent which would alienate non-Christian
listeners.
In"lt'sa Fragile Thing," Colbert Baynham de
livers a heartfelt account of the fear and uncer
tainty of becoming a "we." In much the same
vein, Baynham expresses the solitude that ac

companies giving yourself to someone else in
"Chart the Unknown."
Soothing drum beats open "Love You Slow,"
which reflects on the evolution and growth of
love and the desire to capture the experience
moment-by-moment.
Although these tunes arc a little sappy at
times, they're neither preachy nor overly senti
mental. Instead, the songs express very real emo
tions and problems that many face and can relate
to.
While they cover the "feelings" side of rela
tionships, The Basics also address the practical


aspects of sexual relationships as well, fo
cusing on the emotional and physical in
vestments. Baynham's catchy "Brains Head
South" advocates safe-sex via open commu
nication before passion takes over. "It's kind
of hard to think / When we're already in
gear / Before you Hash those eyes / Before I
kiss your mouth / VVc gotta get something
straight/ Before our brains head south."
The theme of solitude emerges in "Ceil
ings and Walls" as Baynham appeals to God
for an answer to his loneliness and inablity
to open up and share his emotions.
The song's upbeat rhythm contrasts with
somber lyrics: "I want to know the healing,
the release/ from the deadening, the stiffen
ing, the cooling from the heat / of the anger
that simmers in our souls / and causes us to
try to walk the / whole road alone."
Many of the group's songs boil down
to, well, the basics. In an assortment of
guitar, keyboard and drum backed songs,
they sing of striving for the truth behind
love and loss, telling things as they are and
ultimately relying on strength from
above. In "Haven Road", the Basics fur
ther a perpetual search which they have
learned to verbalize in very real, unpre
tentious terms.
