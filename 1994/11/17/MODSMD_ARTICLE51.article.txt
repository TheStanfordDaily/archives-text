## Blood, gore and rock 'n' roll: a look beyond its graphic album art 
### 
The tall, tatooed, New York hard-rock
drummer used a menacing Robert
DeNiro-like growl to pose the ques
tion: "You talkin to me?" Not a very auspi
cious start to the phone interview I was sup
posed to conduct with Vinnie Signorelli,
drummer of Unsane, the Big-Apple band that
blew the lid off underground music at the end
of the 1980s. Producing a grinding fusion of
hardcore punk and gore scream metal, Unsane
has a sound that has found a lasting fan base.
Actually, at the opening of our phone con
versation, Vinnie was quoting DeNiro in "Taxi
Driver." Unsane, currently on tour as the
opening band for Biohazard, uses bites from
the movie to warm up the crowd before they
take the stage and between numbers, so "the
crowd who doesn't know will understand
where we're coming from,"he said.
It is also needed to fill the time between
songs when Chris Spencer, guitarist and
singer, and Peter Shore, bassist, tune up their
instruments. "The guys play their instruments
so hard they have to tune up in between
songs," Vinnie said.
And Unsane certainly plays every song
hard. Unsane is often compared — much to
the band's bewilderment — to Helmet. Ad
dressing this analogy, Vinnie found only two
similarities. Both groups came out of New
York in the late 1980s (with Helmet achieving
a larger success in the mainstream) and both
use distorted vocals.
But compared to Helmet's occasionally de
cipherable barking scream, the songs on "Total
Destruction" (Unsane's latest LP — released
last spring) and all of Unsane's back catalog
(two albumsand manysingles) have vocals that
sound more like they are being emitted from
industrial machinery than from a human voice
box. Vinnie explains, "Our vocals are used
more as an instrument than as a [traditional]
vocal or melody. It is just another annoying
factor in our groove, another emotion."
l ike the abrasive nature of their music, the
artwork on the band's albums and singles is
much more vivid and graphic than any Nir
vana cartoon banned by Wal-Mart. Unsane's
eponymous first album pictured a decapitated
body lying on a subway rail. The picture was
genuine, a gift from a contact in the police
forensics department. The second album, ac
tually a compilation of past singles, depicted a
bloody bathtub. Not to be outdone, "Total De
struction" has photos of a particularly violent
and gruesome automobile wreck.
But on the next album, which Unsane is
currently working on, a few changes can be ex
pected. First of all, according to Vinnie, "the

next album cover is gonna be just one drop of
blood coming down in midair." Entitled
"Lovesongs," the sound may be also a bit dif
ferent. Pressed for examples, Vinnie reveals
that the band is "not gonna be embarassed to
put on something different. Country is fine,
quiet is fine."
Hang on, how did country music (or even
quiet music for that matter) become a possibil
ity for Unsane, famous for their loud wreckage
of sound? "Well," Vinnie continues, "on tour
we listen to 1 lank Williams all the time."
Hank Williams? For a band that would have
been a perfect selection to perform a sound
track to "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Whose music is a controlled fast tour through
the world of smash and slash, an in-your-face
aural representation of the brutal elements of
humanity?
Much of the change may have come as a re
sult of Vinnie's hiring in 1992, when original
drummer Charlie Ondras died from a drug
overdose. Vinnie was a respected drummer,
formerly playing in The Swans and the cult-ish
Foetus. His drumming provides a regularity, a

solidity, that Ondrasdid not contribute amidst
his wild antics and fervor (often ad-libbing).
At the start, Vinnie joined on only with the
promise that Shore and Spencer would work
hard and make a commitment to the band.
Known as the "responsible" member of the
band, Vinnie said he always ends up packing
up the equipment on tour. When asked
whether he enjoyed this task, he called it "good
excercise — it keeps me in shape," and point
ed out that it was sensible: "I have the most
equipment and have to look out for all my
drums." But he did reveal that he "always
wind(s] up doing that" because "the other two
guys tend to get a little blitzed."
The band's songwriting process has also
benifitted from the addition. It is now a three
person endeavor. Vinnie discussed how he felt
recording "Total Destruction."
"It was a total test in a sense. I have this
thing about replacing Charlie. Do I imitate
him? 'Total Destruction' was a phase for Un
sane," he said. "Now we're getting into a niche,
we're not afraid to sound like what we're going
to sound like, though it may be different, a dif

ferent groove for Unsane. Like Blew,' we'll
sound slower and try different things. We may
do some harmonica, use some standup bass."
Unsane has also enjoyed rising popularity.
The aforementioned "Blew" is mellow for Un
sane and appears on the Jabberjaw compila
tion album, which also includes bands such as
Hole and Seaweed. Jabberjaw is an under
ground club in L.A. that is, sadly, becoming
very popular it has released its compilation na
tionwide.
On this tour, Unsane will bypass Jabberjaw
and play at the infamous Whiskey in Holly
wood. However, Vinnie likes playing at Jab
berjaw. "It's small and sweaty. The sound is
loud, everybody is right in your face."
This is the ideal crowd for a band whose
drummer had at last count 15 tattoos and has
"added a few more since." For a man with so
many of them, Vinnie seemed unexpectedly
surprised when queried about F.ngima of the
Jim Rose Circus Sideshow, a man whose entire
body is tatooed as a puzzle that has been pieced
together. Following a long whistle, Vinnie ex
claimed, "that's dedication — a life's commit
ment. That I don't understand." He explained
his collection by a certain combination of
"time and circumstance" and a simple "I just
dig 'em."
Vinnie is more concerned with the future of
Unsane. After this tour they will play a New
Year's Eve show in Seattle, tour Japan, finish
recording the new album and make a new
video, somewhere in San Francisco. In terms of
making it big, Vinnie states, "I don't think
that's gonna happen." Unsane's future is
"busy, busy, busy. To stay alive we have to stay
busy."
Whatever happens Unsane will keep play
ing their music and treating criticism by being
able to "laugh at it, take a piss at it. Some peo
ple get it, some people don't."
If you are one of those people who doesn't
like the loud, musical homages to power
through slammingly intense guitar riffs, thun
dering bass and indecipherable screeching,
stay away from the Trocadero next Monday.
But if you are a fan, or want to see how Unsane
uses music to push and pull, poke and bend
human emotion in the most violent way, show
up early and stand in the front. And say hi to
Vinnie. ■

tion: "You talkin to me?" Not a very auspi
cious start to the phone interview I was sup
posed to conduct with Vinnie Signorelli,
drummer of Unsane, the Big-Apple band that
blew the lid off underground music at the end
of the 1980s. Producing a grinding fusion of
hardcore punk and gore scream metal, Unsane
has a sound that has found a lasting fan base.
Actually, at the opening of our phone con
versation, Vinnie was quoting DeNiro in "Taxi
Driver." Unsane, currently on tour as the
opening band for Biohazard, uses bites from
the movie to warm up the crowd before they
take the stage and between numbers, so "the
crowd who doesn't know will understand
where we're coming from,"he said.
It is also needed to fill the time between
songs when Chris Spencer, guitarist and
singer, and Peter Shore, bassist, tune up their
instruments. "The guys play their instruments
so hard they have to tune up in between
songs," Vinnie said.
And Unsane certainly plays every song
hard. Unsane is often compared — much to
the band's bewilderment — to Helmet. Ad
dressing this analogy, Vinnie found only two
similarities. Both groups came out of New
York in the late 1980s (with Helmet achieving
a larger success in the mainstream) and both
use distorted vocals.
But compared to Helmet's occasionally de
cipherable barking scream, the songs on "Total
Destruction" (Unsane's latest LP — released
last spring) and all of Unsane's back catalog
(two albumsand manysingles) have vocals that
sound more like they are being emitted from
industrial machinery than from a human voice
box. Vinnie explains, "Our vocals are used
more as an instrument than as a [traditional]
vocal or melody. It is just another annoying
factor in our groove, another emotion."
l ike the abrasive nature of their music, the
artwork on the band's albums and singles is
much more vivid and graphic than any Nir
vana cartoon banned by Wal-Mart. Unsane's
eponymous first album pictured a decapitated
body lying on a subway rail. The picture was
genuine, a gift from a contact in the police
forensics department. The second album, ac
tually a compilation of past singles, depicted a
bloody bathtub. Not to be outdone, "Total De
struction" has photos of a particularly violent
and gruesome automobile wreck.
But on the next album, which Unsane is
currently working on, a few changes can be ex
pected. First of all, according to Vinnie, "the

next album cover is gonna be just one drop of
blood coming down in midair." Entitled
"Lovesongs," the sound may be also a bit dif
ferent. Pressed for examples, Vinnie reveals
that the band is "not gonna be embarassed to
put on something different. Country is fine,
quiet is fine."
Hang on, how did country music (or even
quiet music for that matter) become a possibil
ity for Unsane, famous for their loud wreckage
of sound? "Well," Vinnie continues, "on tour
we listen to 1 lank Williams all the time."
Hank Williams? For a band that would have
been a perfect selection to perform a sound
track to "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Whose music is a controlled fast tour through
the world of smash and slash, an in-your-face
aural representation of the brutal elements of
humanity?
Much of the change may have come as a re
sult of Vinnie's hiring in 1992, when original
drummer Charlie Ondras died from a drug
overdose. Vinnie was a respected drummer,
formerly playing in The Swans and the cult-ish
Foetus. His drumming provides a regularity, a

solidity, that Ondrasdid not contribute amidst
his wild antics and fervor (often ad-libbing).
At the start, Vinnie joined on only with the
promise that Shore and Spencer would work
hard and make a commitment to the band.
Known as the "responsible" member of the
band, Vinnie said he always ends up packing
up the equipment on tour. When asked
whether he enjoyed this task, he called it "good
excercise — it keeps me in shape," and point
ed out that it was sensible: "I have the most
equipment and have to look out for all my
drums." But he did reveal that he "always
wind(s] up doing that" because "the other two
guys tend to get a little blitzed."
The band's songwriting process has also
benifitted from the addition. It is now a three
person endeavor. Vinnie discussed how he felt
recording "Total Destruction."
"It was a total test in a sense. I have this
thing about replacing Charlie. Do I imitate
him? 'Total Destruction' was a phase for Un
sane," he said. "Now we're getting into a niche,
we're not afraid to sound like what we're going
to sound like, though it may be different, a dif

ferent groove for Unsane. Like Blew,' we'll
sound slower and try different things. We may
do some harmonica, use some standup bass."
Unsane has also enjoyed rising popularity.
The aforementioned "Blew" is mellow for Un
sane and appears on the Jabberjaw compila
tion album, which also includes bands such as
Hole and Seaweed. Jabberjaw is an under
ground club in L.A. that is, sadly, becoming
very popular it has released its compilation na
tionwide.
On this tour, Unsane will bypass Jabberjaw
and play at the infamous Whiskey in Holly
wood. However, Vinnie likes playing at Jab
berjaw. "It's small and sweaty. The sound is
loud, everybody is right in your face."
This is the ideal crowd for a band whose
drummer had at last count 15 tattoos and has
"added a few more since." For a man with so
many of them, Vinnie seemed unexpectedly
surprised when queried about F.ngima of the
Jim Rose Circus Sideshow, a man whose entire
body is tatooed as a puzzle that has been pieced
together. Following a long whistle, Vinnie ex
claimed, "that's dedication — a life's commit
ment. That I don't understand." He explained
his collection by a certain combination of
"time and circumstance" and a simple "I just
dig 'em."
Vinnie is more concerned with the future of
Unsane. After this tour they will play a New
Year's Eve show in Seattle, tour Japan, finish
recording the new album and make a new
video, somewhere in San Francisco. In terms of
making it big, Vinnie states, "I don't think
that's gonna happen." Unsane's future is
"busy, busy, busy. To stay alive we have to stay
busy."
Whatever happens Unsane will keep play
ing their music and treating criticism by being
able to "laugh at it, take a piss at it. Some peo
ple get it, some people don't."
If you are one of those people who doesn't
like the loud, musical homages to power
through slammingly intense guitar riffs, thun
dering bass and indecipherable screeching,
stay away from the Trocadero next Monday.
But if you are a fan, or want to see how Unsane
uses music to push and pull, poke and bend
human emotion in the most violent way, show
up early and stand in the front. And say hi to
Vinnie. ■
