Bullets Over Broadway
Woody Allen's latest film, "Bullets
over Broadway," manages to hit its
target, but fails to strike the bull's
eye. While the cast delivers genuine
and captivating performances,
Allen's heavy-handed writing seems
to cast a shadow over the whole
production.
The film is set in New York during

the 1920s and centers around the
world of gangsters and, believe it or
not, the theater. John Cusack ("Say
Anything," "Better Off Dead") stars
as struggling playwright David
Shayne, who has the uncanny abili
ty to write intensely deep plays that
flop. The movie overall delivers a
good bit of humor backed up by ex
cellent casting and sincere dia
logue. The acting, however, gets
bogged down by extra subplots and
Allen's over-written script. If slightly
more character-driven rather than
plot-based, "Bullets" could have
right on the mark.
Clerks
In the no-budget, guerrilla-indepen
dent tradition of "She's Gotta Have
It"and the more recent "El Mari
achi," Kevin Smith's "Clerks" hands
out another slap in the face to studio
executives who prefer the conve
nience of judging talent by its price
tag. Made for less money than the
catering bill for most major Holly
wood productions — $27,575 to be
exact — this black-and-white-shot
venture looks cheap, talks fast and
plays tough. Vile, remorseless and
engaging all at once, "Clerks" is
quite simply the most audacious
American comedy to hit the screens
thus far this year.

Frankenstein
"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" is di
rector Kenneth Branagh's recent
monster creation. Branagh, the bril
liant director and thespian of "Henry
V" and "Much Ado About Nothing,"
brings yet another literary classic
alive on the silver screen. Branagh's
direction is stellar and electric. He
captures immense energy in his
film, using just the right combination
of special effects and melodrama.
"Frankenstein" is a Gothic tale of
blood, gore and romance, guaran
teed "to curdle the blood and quick
en the beatings of the heart."
Branagh himself stars in the lead
role of Victor Frankenstein, the intel
ligent yet slightly off-kilter scientist,
who experiments with electricity and
amniotic fluid to create a monster.
Interview with a vampire
Tom Cruise wanted to be taken seri
ously. Neil Jordan wanted to prove
he could compete on Hollywood's
home ground. Anne Rice wanted to
confound all involved by first publicly
disowning the project, then heartily
endorsing it. A case of too many per
sonal egos at stake and too little
substance to hold them together —
"Interview With the Vampire" ends
up constipated on a diet rich in py
rotechnical novelty, but painfully

lacking an emotional center.
Pulp Fiction
It's good.
Damn good.
See it.
Radioland Murders
When George Lucas produced a
film in 1986 by veteran writers
Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, the
result was the much-anticipated but
embarrassing flop, "Howard the
Duck." Now, almost a decade later,
and with the addition of two more
writers, the same team returns with
another disappointing comedy.
Only this time the subject is the be
hind-the-scenes chaos of a 1930's
style radio network.
In the hands of director Mel Smith
("The Tall Guy"), "Radioland Mur
ders" races along in a frenzy of slap
stick falls, impossible predicaments
silly mix-ups, and worn-out gags, all
of which seem lifted from a bad B
movie.
Stargate
"Stargate" may have broken the Oc
tober box office record last week
end, but the movie did not break
any barriers in science fiction ad
vancement. Most of the concepts,
characterizations and plot twists

were borrowed from other action
and sci-fi films.
"Stargate" stars James Spader and
Kurt Russell as two men who travel
through an ancient transporter into
a world millions of light years away
from Earth to search for alternate
civilizations. However, their little
journey opens up more than just
communication lines. By allowing
another world direct access to
Earth, the Stargate ends up endan
gering the entire planet.
The film, directed by Roland Em
merich, is an entertaining two hours,
but it recalls too many elements of
such classics as the "Indiana
Jones" trilogy without the originality
and style. In the end, "Stargate"
blends in with every other hero-girl
villain flick that make up that stew of
unmemorable science fiction.
The War
"The War" is a highly engineered vi
sual Hallmark® card tailored to
make mommies coo, cause your
mascara to run and melt your Junior
Mints.
Starring Kevin Costnerand Elijah
Wood, this film does not show the
subtlety that underlies the actual
moral development these characters
supposedly go through. Rather.it
assaults you with a morality lesson
like an ABC After School Special.
