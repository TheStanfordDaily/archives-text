THURS/17
■ For a theatrical experience that
takes you away from the usual line
of Stanford politics, try "Rush Lim
baugh in Night School." Charlie
Varon mockingly portrays the noto
rious talk-radio host as his show's
popularity gains a monumental
boom in 1996. Limbaugh tries to adapt to
the changing ways of the world, only to find
himself in more trouble that he ever thought
possible. The show starts at 8:30 p.m at The
Marsh, which advertises itself as "a breeding
ground for new performance." That it is. The
Marsh is located at 1062 Valencia in S.F. Tick
ets are rapidly selling out, so call 641-0235 as
soon as possible.
FRI/18
■ For a great evening of music, po
litical commentary and fun dancing,
check out Dr. Loco's Rockin'
Jalapeno Band. This band full of acade
mics, political activists and great musicians will
be bringing their groovin' sounds of Chicano
power to Alberto's at 9:30 p.m. If you've never
seen them on campus before, be sure to go, as
their unique combination of rock and Mexican
rhythms is not to be missed. Alberto's is locat
ed at 736 W. Dana in Mountain View. 968-3007
■ If you missed them last week at
the 11th Street Block Party, you still
have another chance to catch Jun
gle Biskit, an excellent jazz band
with funky sounds. The show starts at 10

p.m., but go early and sample some of the
yummy yet affordable regional Italian cuisine
and the great selection of microbreweries of
fered at the restaurant part of 11 11 is located
at 374 11th St.in S.F For information and
reservations, call 431 -3337
SAT/19
■ The Village Voice says that we
should "run to see" Sarah Schul
man's new play, "1984." This drama is
the psychological journey of one gay man and
includes a shockingly honest discussion of the
impact of AIDS. It is said that Schulman's writ
ing and Mark Ameen's acting truly represent
the private conversations and emotions of gays
dealing with the AIDS epidemic. The perfor
mance starts at 8 p.m. at Josie's Cabaret and
Juice Joint, at 3583 16th St.in S.F. For reserva
tions or more information, call 861-7933.
■ They've just released a new
album, and all American Music Club
touches is turning to gold. The stage of
the historic Great American Music Hall should
be no exception, as the alterna-rock/pop band
returns to its original stomping grounds. AMC
will be playing tonight and tomorrow night.
The Great American Music Hall is located at
859 O'Farrell between Polk and Larkin. Call
885-0750 for box office.

busting and healing" with clairvoy
ant, healer and writer Lisa Patter

ty to see a great combination of
classic and modern dance as the Pl
lobolus Dance Theatre presents
three new works. The troupe is well
renowned for their unique and innovative mix

dance program will probably contain some nu
dity. Pilobolus will begin their six-piece perfor

■ If you're into animal portraiture,
but can't stand those cutesy Hall
mark cards, then be sure to check
out "A Photographic Bestiary." This
collection of of animalia in all of its splendor
features the works of more than two dozen
acclaimed photographers, and certainly
gives the audience a different and often
poignant view of our animal relatives. The

information.
WED/23

the price tag, check out an open re

phony. The Symphony is performing
