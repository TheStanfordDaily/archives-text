# Sand Hill draft submitted to Palo Alto
## 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
Taking another step in its 60-year struggle
to improve the Sand Hill Road corridor, Stan
ford submitted its latest proposal to the Palo
Alto City Council yesterday.
The application proposes widening Sand
Hill Road, expanding the Stanford Shopping
Center and constructing two major housing
developments.
The proposal is a revision of a plan the

Council considered two years ago following
complaints that the original policy was envi
ronmentally harmful to San Francisquito
Creek and would greatly increase traffic on
Sand Hill Road.
The development project is expected to ben
efit Stanford by meeting demands for housing,
improving the flow of traffic and earning sub
stantial revenue for the University from the
rental of housing and expansion of the shop
ping center. The improvements are estimated
to bring in $800,000 a year for Palo Alto

through increased sales, property and utility
tax revenues.
Though the original proposal called for the
city of Palo Alto to contribute $2.1 million to
wards road improvements, the new proposal
demands that Stanford foot the entire bill.
Coe said he admits it is "a little unusual" for
a university to pay the total costs for the road
construction but said Stanford wants to show
it is a "member of a larger community."
