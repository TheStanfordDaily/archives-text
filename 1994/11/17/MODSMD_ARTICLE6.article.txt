# Sand Hill draft submitted to Palo Alto
## 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
Taking another step in its 60-year struggle
to improve the Sand Hill Road corridor, Stan
ford submitted its latest proposal to the Palo
Alto City Council yesterday.
The application proposes widening Sand
Hill Road, expanding the Stanford Shopping
Center and constructing two major housing
developments.
The proposal is a revision of a plan the

Council considered two years ago following
complaints that the original policy was envi
ronmentally harmful to San Francisquito
Creek and would greatly increase traffic on
Sand Hill Road.
The development project is expected to ben
efit Stanford by meeting demands for housing,
improving the flow of traffic and earning sub
stantial revenue for the University from the
rental of housing and expansion of the shop
ping center. The improvements are estimated
to bring in $800,000 a year for Palo Alto

through increased sales, property and utility
tax revenues.
Though the original proposal called for the
city of Palo Alto to contribute $2.1 million to
wards road improvements, the new proposal
demands that Stanford foot the entire bill.
Coe said he admits it is "a little unusual" for
a university to pay the total costs for the road
construction but said Stanford wants to show
it is a "member of a larger community."
"Stanford wants to contribute to
major regional issues," he said. He
added that because it is a commer
cial project, it will pay for itself and
University funds will not really be
used.
The new proposal follows a
seven-month community outreach
program completed in April. "We
have tried to l>e very responsive to
the community comments we
received," said Director of Commu

nity Relations Andy Coe.
The major improvements pro
posed include widening Sand Hill
Road to four lanes and extending it
to El Camino Real, so traffic will no
longer "dead-end" into a parking
lot. Quarry Road will also be
expanded to four lanes ending in a
functional three-way intersection at
El Camino.
The proposal will also include the
construction of 388 independent
living units for seniors on the 21-
acre site of the old Children's 1 lospi
tal. Continuing care facilities will be
provided by a Health Center with 70
"assisted living" units and 46 rooms

of skilled nursing facilities. Also, on
a 48-acre area of land northwest of
Sand Hill Road, 630 multi-family
apartments will be built .primarily
for Stanford workers.
In addition, the University plans
to expand the Stanford Shopping
Center retail space by 12 percent to
include additional retail outlets.
Improvements in the overall
appearance of the center will also be
made.
Gail Slocum, a member of the
Menlo Park Citv Council, said she is
concerned that the development
will be "an awfully big change for
Menlo Park." She added, however,

that there has been a lot of work to
improve the original policy. "My
primary concern was there will be
too many roads," she said.
Changes to the original proposal
that were made in response to con
cerns from the local community
include leaving Arboretum Road
open from Sand Hill Road to Quar
ry Road, constructing Vineyard
I>ane between Sand Hill Road and
Quarry Road, and making improve
ments for bicycle, pedestrian and
shuttle traffic in the area.
Most of the Sand Hill Road
extension will now also be located
on the existing Stanford Shopping

Center parking lot, moving it fur
ther from the creek to an average
setback of 195 feet.
Because of further concerns
about increased pollution running
into the creek, both the housing
developments have also been
moved back from the creek to
reduce damage.
The housing developments have
also been "scaled back" to provide
more open space, Coe said. "We
want to give a setting where they
[residents] can still appreciate the
open space," he said.
The proposed improvements are
now subject to the Environmental

Impact Report process, to be con
ducted by the city of Palo Alto.
This will begin with a "public
scoping meeting" at the beginning
of next year to allow members of the
community to voice their opinions,
said Lorie Topley, the senior plan
ner for the City of Palo Alto.
The city will then study the
potential impact of the project —
including the effect on traffic and
environ men till issues — and pre
pare an Environmental Impact
Report which will be discussed at
public meetings, Topley said.
The approval process should be
completed by spring 1996.
