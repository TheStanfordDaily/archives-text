One night can change an en
tire life. For Marcelo Rubens
Paiva, it was the night he dove
into a lake in his native country
of Brazil. The lake was shallow,
but Paiva started drowning.
When he emerged from the
water, he was paralyzed from
the neck down.
The incident gave an entirely
new direction to the agricultur
al-engineering major's life.
When he checked out of the hos
pital at the age of 20, Paiva start
ed writing. Several bestsellers
later, he's studying at Stanford
for a year as one of six interna
tional Knight Fellows.
"Once, I said to myself, 'How
good that this [accident] hap
pened to me!' Look how crazy
that is," Paiva said. "But I've
known a world that I would
never have known without this
accident. In my 35 years of life
I've gone to heaven and to hell."
"A little nothing turned my
life into a nightmare," Paiva
wrote in his semi-autobiographi
cal 1982 best-seller "Feliz Ario
Velho" ("Happy Old Year"). "If I
can't walk again, I'll find a way
to kill myself. . . . Death was eas
ier than the agony of the situa
tion."
After Paiva's initial bouts

with pessimism, he learned to
accept his condition and even
thought of it as a rebirth.
"The first year, the idea of
death was constant — now it's
not," Paiva said. "In the begin
ning, I couldn't move my arms
and was totally dependent.
Slowly I recovered my move
ments, got used to my body and
started doing things on my
own."
One of those things was get
ting out of bed by himself, an ac
tion most take for granted.
"I still remember the first day
I got off my bed by myself — it
was exciting. Until then I'd al
ways had to wait for someone to
wake up, or call someone. I
couldn't just say, 'Oh, I'm tired
of sleeping, I think I'll go for a
cup of milk,' " he said.
He returned home in a wheel
chair, and needed a nurse to feed
him, clothe him, bathe him and
take him places. Paiva said it
took a while for him to get used
to life at home.
"When I started moving my
arms, making new friends, when
I went back to college, I broke
out with the person I was before
and started a new life."
With the help of physical
therapy, Paiva's condition grad
ually improved. Soon he was able
