# Disabled journalist discovers 'new life'
## 
### Samuel Park Contributing writer 
One night can change an en
tire life. For Marcelo Rubens
Paiva, it was the night he dove
into a lake in his native country
of Brazil. The lake was shallow,
but Paiva started drowning.
When he emerged from the
water, he was paralyzed from
the neck down.
The incident gave an entirely
new direction to the agricultur
al-engineering major's life.
When he checked out of the hos
pital at the age of 20, Paiva start
ed writing. Several bestsellers
later, he's studying at Stanford
for a year as one of six interna
tional Knight Fellows.
"Once, I said to myself, 'How
good that this [accident] hap
pened to me!' Look how crazy
that is," Paiva said. "But I've
known a world that I would
never have known without this
accident. In my 35 years of life
I've gone to heaven and to hell."
"A little nothing turned my
life into a nightmare," Paiva
wrote in his semi-autobiographi
cal 1982 best-seller "Feliz Ario
Velho" ("Happy Old Year"). "If I
can't walk again, I'll find a way
to kill myself. . . . Death was eas
ier than the agony of the situa
tion."
After Paiva's initial bouts

with pessimism, he learned to
accept his condition and even
thought of it as a rebirth.
"The first year, the idea of
death was constant — now it's
not," Paiva said. "In the begin
ning, I couldn't move my arms
and was totally dependent.
Slowly I recovered my move
ments, got used to my body and
started doing things on my
own."
One of those things was get
ting out of bed by himself, an ac
tion most take for granted.
"I still remember the first day
I got off my bed by myself — it
was exciting. Until then I'd al
ways had to wait for someone to
wake up, or call someone. I
couldn't just say, 'Oh, I'm tired
of sleeping, I think I'll go for a
cup of milk,' " he said.
He returned home in a wheel
chair, and needed a nurse to feed
him, clothe him, bathe him and
take him places. Paiva said it
took a while for him to get used
to life at home.
"When I started moving my
arms, making new friends, when
I went back to college, I broke
out with the person I was before
and started a new life."
With the help of physical
therapy, Paiva's condition grad
ually improved. Soon he was able

to live on his own, earn money and
with the help of an electric
wheelchair, go places without trou
ble.
"I had two options [after the acci
dent). That of recuperating, jind that
of depression," Paiva said. "I
oould've chosen to be angry all my
life. But I chose the way to recovery."
Paiva describes this process as
something natural that happens to

human beings.
"If I got depressed, I'd have no
friends and no one could stand me,"
he said. "I wouldn't have a girl
friend, or a sex life. Not even work.
Instinctively, my body and my head
led me to recovery. More and more
I got used to it and worked to get
out of the hole."
Paiva talks about what hap
pened the way one refers to a bad
dream, as if it were far into the
past. An intensely happy and
humorous person, Paiva recognizes
that the accident gave his life of
writing a new, better turn.

Over the course of his career,
Paiva has shared top literary hon
ors with Jorge Amado and Menotti
del Picchia as recipient of the Moin
ho Santista Award (Brazil's version
of the Nobel Prize). And he also
won a Jabuti award, equivalent to
the American Pulitzer Prize.
The stage production of "Feliz
Ario Velho" has traveled in several
international tours, including an
appearance at New York's summer
Shakespeare Festival in 1985.
"I never felt I deserved all these
awards," Paiva said. "Even today I
ask myself, 'Why did they give me

all these awards?' I didn't under
stand. I thought I was too young to
be winning all those awards."
"I think I still haven't written
my life's masterpiece. I like my
later books better," he added.
He's written five other books,
four fiction and one play. His most
recent work is a collection of essays.
His books have been translated in
more than 10 languages.
Paiva now enjoys married life
with his wife in Escondido Village.
He's hard at work on a new book,
this one about his childhood. Paiva
has also worked as a newspaper

columnist and TV anchor in Brazil.
"He's done exceptionally good
work in both print and broadcast
journalism in Brazil. It's unusual
for someone to have success in both
kinds of media," said Knight Fel
lows Coordinator Jim Risser.
"I admire his courage and ability
to function as such an outstanding
journalist," Risser added.
For many disabled people in
Brazil, Paiva is a role model.
"I'm not a hero. I'm no better
than anyone else," he said. "I'm
part of this universe. Everyone is
capable of the changes I underwent

— everyone has the potential to sur
vive and adapt to a new situation.
According to Paiva, it took 10
years to end the torment. From the
accident, he learned an important
lesson.
"Man can change, be different
things. Man has the potential to
adapt, to rebuild," Paiva said. "It's
a fabulous thing. Man is a lot better
than he thinks. Man has conquered
this planet, gone to the moon,
crossed oceans.... What happened
to me is an example of the ability
that people have of rebuilding
themselves."
