Gary Hamel
Competing for the Future
(Harvard Business School Press, $24.95)
In Competing for the Future,
Hamel and his co-author develop a coherent
model for how today's executives can identify
and accomplish no less than heroic goals in
tomorrow's marketplace.
'Today,
most businesses are caught in the feeding
frenzy of cutting costs, restructuring, and
reengineering, and only a few are genuinely
committed to creating future revenues. You will
know who they are-because they will be read
ing Competing for the Future, the long-awaited
book by Gary Hamel and C.K. Prahalad,
arguably the two most influential thinkers on
strategy in the Western World." -Peter Senge,
author of The Fifth Discipline,
This event will be held at the Bookstore on camp us.
