To Cal and Stanford Students, Alumni and Fans,
The Big Game is one of the great traditions in
college athletics, matching two pre-eminent
institutions that share excellence in academics
and athletics. Ihe game also provides the San
Francisco Bay Area with a unique venue to
develop camaraderie, kinship, and relationships
among alumni and friends. The spirit of the Big
Game should mirror the pursuit of high academic
standards, rich athletic tradition, friendly rivalry,
and a history of tolerance and civility on our
respective campuses.
We welcome you to enjoy the 1994 Big Game
and celebrate the rich tradition in the spirit of
unity, friendship and good sportsmanship.
