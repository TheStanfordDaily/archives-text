OFFICIAL UNIVERSITY ANNOUNCEMENT
STANFORD UNIVERSITY'S POLICY ON CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND ALCOHOL
Student conduct is guided by the Fundamental Standard, which
states the expectation that students will act in ways that
demonstrate respect for order, morality, personal honor, and
that rights of others. Implicit in the Standard is the
understanding that students are responsible for making their
own decisions and accepting the consequences of those
decisions.
In order to make informed decisions about alcohol use,
students and others should be aware of the health and safety
risks associated with its use, as well as the state and local laws
about possessing, serving and consuming alcohol. It is widely
recognized that the misuse and abuse of drugs ("controlled
substances")* and the abuse of alcohol are major contributors
to serious health problems as well as to social and civic
concerns. The health risks associated with the use of illicit
drugs and the abuse of alcohol include various deleterious
physical and mental consequences including addiction, severe
disability, and death. Information concerning the known effects
of alcohol and specific drugs is available from the Alcohol and
Drug Information Center at the Cowell Students Health Center.
The goal of this policy is to reduce drug and alcohol abuse and
the human and material costs associated with it. The
University, as an educational institution, approaches student
conduct issues from a perspective that places greater emphasis
on individual responsibility and development than on
regulatory measure. Consequently, education about and
prevention of alcohol-related problems will continue to be our
primary emphasis. Moreover, it is the intention of the
University that students as individuals and as members of
groups will conduct themselves in accordance with this and all
other University policies governing student conduct.
* Controlled substances are those defined in 21 U.S.C. 812 and
includc, but are not limited to such substances as marijuana,
heroin, cocaine and amphetamines
Policy
It is the policy of Stanford University to maintain a drug- free
workplace and campus. The unlawful manufacture,
distribution, dispensation, possession, and/or use of controlled
substances or the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of
alcohol is prohibited on the Stanford campus, in the workplace,
or as part of any of the University's activities. The workplace
and campus are presumed to include all Stanford premises
where the activities of the University are conducted. Violation
of this policy may result in disciplinary sanctions up to and
including termination of employment or expulsion of students.
Violations may also be referred to the appropriate authorities
for prosecution. This policy will be reviewed at least
biennially.
Some Application
* No University funds or funds collected by the University
may be used in a way which violates the policy.
While there are a few frosh at Stanford who are 21 or older,
and residence staff members often are in the 21 or older age
range, the fact remains that the great majority of residents of an
all-frosh dormitory are minors. Consequently, it is hard to
imagine how house dues for all -frosh residences could be used
to buy alcohol without violating both state law and University
policy.
* Notwithstanding the foregoing, regardless of how money is
collected, all provisions of the policy apply to all students,
faculty, and staff.
* Event planners will be held individually and collectively
responsible for planning and collectively responsible for
planning and carrying out events in compliance with the policy.
One or more house/organization officers must assume
responsibility for the event's compliance with the alcohol
policy. These officers' names must be made available to the
police and to the University upon request.
Consequences of Violation
Educational and rehabilitative measures will be the preferred
response to infractions unaccompanied by more egregious
conduct. However, behavior could run the gamut from a simple
Minor in Possession (of alcohol) with no prior disciplinary
history to drunken behavior resulting in loss of life. Penalties
will be calibrated according to the severity of the misconduct.
Behavior associated with drug or alcohol use and abuse may
constitute one or more of the following.
1. Violation of the University residence agreement or Terms
and Conditions of Fraternity Occupancy, subjecting the student
to loss of University housing.
2. Violation of student organization conditions of recognition,
subjecting the student to expulsion from organization and/or
the organization's loss of University recognition and associated
privileges.
3. Violation of the Fundamental Standard, subjecting the
student to University discipline which includes as a possible
outcome suspension or expulsion from Stanford.
Inebriation is not an excuse for misconduct but rather is an
aggravating circumstance. A student's careless or willful
reduction, through the use of alcohol or other intoxicants, of
his or her own ability to think clearly, exercise good judgment,
and respond to rational intervention is considered ground for
more stringent penalties than might be levied otherwise.
Residences or student organizations found to have violated the
policy arc subject, as groups, to University sanctions such as
suspension of social privileges and loss of University
recognition, meeting space, and housing, if applicable.
Civil Liability
While the law regarding civil liability is complex, it is
important to know that under some circumstances party hosts,
sponsors, bartenders, or others may be held legally liable for
the consequences of serving alcohol to underaged drinkers or
to obviously intoxicated persons.
Criminal Liability
Stanford University is not a sanctuary from the enforcement of
state and local laws. Students and others on campus who
violate the law may be and have been arrested and prosecuted.
Primary responsibility for law enforcement, including that
related to alcohol, rests with law enforcement agencies,
primarily the Stanford Police Department. Uniformed officers
who patrol the campus and respond to calls are deputized by
the sheriff of Santa Clara county and are fully empowered and
authorized to stop vehicles, make arrests, and enforce all upon
as a complete and careen citing of relevant laws. More
information is available at the Stanford Department of Public
Safety, 711 Serra Street.
Generally, as of September, 1990, it is a criminal offense:
1. To provide any alcoholic beverage to a person under 21
- Cal. Business and Professions code 25658
2. To provide any alcoholic beverage to an obviously
intoxicated person
- Cal. Business and Professions Code 25602
3. For any person under age 21 to purchase alcohol
- Cal. Business and Profession Code 25628
4. To be under the influence of alcohol in a public place and
unable to exercise care for one's own safety or that of others
- Cal. Penal Code 647
5. For persons under 21 to have any container of alcohol in any
public place or any place open to the public
- Business and Professions code 25662
6. To operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of
alcohol or other intoxicants or with a blood alcohol level of
.08% or higher
-Cal. Vehicle Code 23152
7. To have an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle and
for persons under 21 to drive a vehicle carrying alcohol or to
possess alcohol while in a motor vehicle.
- Cal. vehicle code 23223, 23224
8. To have in one's possession or to use talse evidence of age
and identi to purchase alcohol.
- Cal. Business and Professions Code 25661

controlled substances (those listed in Schedules I through V of
the controlled substances Act)
-21 USC 812; 21 USC 828, 841,844, 845, 845 a

use a minor to transport, sell, or distribute marijuana.
- Cal. Health and Safety 11361
THE ROLE OF RESIDENCE STAFF
PERTAINING TO STANFORD UNIVERSITY'S
POLICY ON CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES
AND ALCOHOL
The role of Resident Assistants and Resident Fellows
("resident staff') at Stanford is principally educational,
advisory, and developmental. It is crucial that students trust
their staff members and feel comfortable confiding in them,
turning to them freely for assistance whenever they need it. As
role models and as employees and agents of the University,
residence staff are expected to comply with the controlled
Substances and Alcohol Policy themselves. For example, they
must not provide to minors, nor may they allow program funds
under their control to be used in a way which violates the
policy. With regard to the policy, residence staff members are
expected to work with students in the following ways.
As educators, residence staff should help ensure that students
are made aware of University policy, pertinent California law,
and the health risks associated with the use and abuse of
alcohol and other drugs.
As advisors, residence staff should urge sensible party
planning and management and help students in their efforts to
abide by the event planning guidelines.
As community builders, RAs and RFs should work closely
with residents to create and maintain a safe and healthful
residential environment.
Resident Assistants and Resident Fellows are not expected to
police or monitor the conduct of students, or to receive or act
upon reports of violations. They are expected to exercise the
same judgment concerning this policy as they do with other
University policies. For example, they must continue to
intervene and exercise responsible guidance any time they are
aware of any situation that is threatening to the health or safety
of individuals or groups.
THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND
ALCOHOL POLICY GUIDELINES FOR
EVENT PLANNERS
The following guidelines are meant to assist students in
planning and managing events in ways that are in compliance
with the controlled Substances and Alcohol Policy. The
guidelines apply to all students planning events on the Stanford
campus or any off-campus University program or activity. The
list below, drawn up for events at which alcohol will will be
served, is not exhaustive. Individuals and groups are
responsible for developing strategies for planning and carrying
out events that are safe and in compliance with University
policy.
* If you choose to serve alcohol at all, make it an adjunct to the
event, not the center of it.
* Ensure that non-alcoholic drinks (EANABS) arc at least as
accessible and attractive as, and more plentiful than, alcoholic
drinks. The amount of alcohol provided should be reasonable
and in proportion to the number of event participants who are
legally able to drink.
* Create an atmosphere in which people are encouraged to
interact, and are helped to feel comfortable - have something
for people to do besides just stand around and drink.
* Encourage moderation by using moderate-sized glasses and
cups.
* Have the alcohol in a secure part of the room where access
can be readily controlled. Ensure that it is attended at all times,
and have it served rather than leaving it open to self-service.
Make sure that servers have been trained in responsible alcohol
serving.
* Stop serving alcohol at least an hour before the end of the
event, and make sure you have plenty of other beverages and
snacks left to serve at this time.
* Refuse to serve someone who has had too much to drink.
* Do not let an intoxicated person drive!
* If the event is advertised, do not mention alcohol in the
publicity.
* If the event is open to people who arc not known to the
residence or the organization, take extra precautions to guard
against problems such as theft, assault, drunken driving,
individuals wandering off in need of assistance, and possible
injuries. While any of these concerns can arise among people
who know each other, experience shows that they are more
common when gatherings are large and includc strangers.
* High school students should be afforded vigorous protection
from access to alcohol, if they are allowed to attend the event
at all. It is generally wiser to restrict attendance to college-aged
people or older.
* Designate plenty of sober monitors to help manage the party.
Station them at the front door and in the area where alcohol is
being served, and have some circulate inside and outside the
house to check other possible means of entry, attend to house
security, respond to problems, and so forth.
* Emphasize to the group sponsoring the event (e.g., a
residence, a fraternal group, a student voluntary organization),
that it is each member's responsibility to ensure that the event
is managed well and to exercise care for the well-being of all
participants.
* Exercise care and authority in hiring the band. Do not permit
members to bring minors ("friends of the band") to the event.
* Control the noise of the event. The farther away it can be
heard, the more likely you'll draw complaints and unwanted
guests.

THE ROLE OF RESIDENCE STAFF
PERTAINING TO STANFORD UNIVERSITY'S
POLICY ON CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES
AND ALCOHOL
The role of Resident Assistants and Resident Fellows
("resident staff') at Stanford is principally educational,
advisory, and developmental. It is crucial that students trust
their staff members and feel comfortable confiding in them,
turning to them freely for assistance whenever they need it. As
role models and as employees and agents of the University,
residence staff are expected to comply with the controlled
Substances and Alcohol Policy themselves. For example, they
must not provide to minors, nor may they allow program funds
under their control to be used in a way which violates the
policy. With regard to the policy, residence staff members are
expected to work with students in the following ways.
As educators, residence staff should help ensure that students
are made aware of University policy, pertinent California law,
and the health risks associated with the use and abuse of
alcohol and other drugs.
As advisors, residence staff should urge sensible party
planning and management and help students in their efforts to
abide by the event planning guidelines.
As community builders, RAs and RFs should work closely
with residents to create and maintain a safe and healthful
residential environment.
Resident Assistants and Resident Fellows are not expected to
police or monitor the conduct of students, or to receive or act
upon reports of violations. They are expected to exercise the
same judgment concerning this policy as they do with other
University policies. For example, they must continue to
intervene and exercise responsible guidance any time they are
aware of any situation that is threatening to the health or safety
of individuals or groups.
THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND
ALCOHOL POLICY GUIDELINES FOR
EVENT PLANNERS
The following guidelines are meant to assist students in
planning and managing events in ways that are in compliance
with the controlled Substances and Alcohol Policy. The
guidelines apply to all students planning events on the Stanford
campus or any off-campus University program or activity. The
list below, drawn up for events at which alcohol will will be
served, is not exhaustive. Individuals and groups are
responsible for developing strategies for planning and carrying
out events that are safe and in compliance with University
policy.
* If you choose to serve alcohol at all, make it an adjunct to the
event, not the center of it.
* Ensure that non-alcoholic drinks (EANABS) arc at least as
accessible and attractive as, and more plentiful than, alcoholic
drinks. The amount of alcohol provided should be reasonable
and in proportion to the number of event participants who are
legally able to drink.
* Create an atmosphere in which people are encouraged to
interact, and are helped to feel comfortable - have something
for people to do besides just stand around and drink.
* Encourage moderation by using moderate-sized glasses and
cups.
* Have the alcohol in a secure part of the room where access
can be readily controlled. Ensure that it is attended at all times,
and have it served rather than leaving it open to self-service.
Make sure that servers have been trained in responsible alcohol
serving.
* Stop serving alcohol at least an hour before the end of the
event, and make sure you have plenty of other beverages and
snacks left to serve at this time.
* Refuse to serve someone who has had too much to drink.
* Do not let an intoxicated person drive!
* If the event is advertised, do not mention alcohol in the
publicity.
* If the event is open to people who arc not known to the
residence or the organization, take extra precautions to guard
against problems such as theft, assault, drunken driving,
individuals wandering off in need of assistance, and possible
injuries. While any of these concerns can arise among people
who know each other, experience shows that they are more
common when gatherings are large and includc strangers.
* High school students should be afforded vigorous protection
from access to alcohol, if they are allowed to attend the event
at all. It is generally wiser to restrict attendance to college-aged
people or older.
* Designate plenty of sober monitors to help manage the party.
Station them at the front door and in the area where alcohol is
being served, and have some circulate inside and outside the
house to check other possible means of entry, attend to house
security, respond to problems, and so forth.
* Emphasize to the group sponsoring the event (e.g., a
residence, a fraternal group, a student voluntary organization),
that it is each member's responsibility to ensure that the event
is managed well and to exercise care for the well-being of all
participants.
* Exercise care and authority in hiring the band. Do not permit
members to bring minors ("friends of the band") to the event.
* Control the noise of the event. The farther away it can be
heard, the more likely you'll draw complaints and unwanted
guests.

OFFICIAL UNIVERSITY ANNOUNCEMENT
STANFORD UNIVERSITY'S POLICY ON CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND ALCOHOL
Student conduct is guided by the Fundamental Standard, which
states the expectation that students will act in ways that
demonstrate respect for order, morality, personal honor, and
that rights of others. Implicit in the Standard is the
understanding that students are responsible for making their
own decisions and accepting the consequences of those
decisions.
In order to make informed decisions about alcohol use,
students and others should be aware of the health and safety
risks associated with its use, as well as the state and local laws
about possessing, serving and consuming alcohol. It is widely
recognized that the misuse and abuse of drugs ("controlled
substances")* and the abuse of alcohol are major contributors
to serious health problems as well as to social and civic
concerns. The health risks associated with the use of illicit
drugs and the abuse of alcohol include various deleterious
physical and mental consequences including addiction, severe
disability, and death. Information concerning the known effects
of alcohol and specific drugs is available from the Alcohol and
Drug Information Center at the Cowell Students Health Center.
The goal of this policy is to reduce drug and alcohol abuse and
the human and material costs associated with it. The
University, as an educational institution, approaches student
conduct issues from a perspective that places greater emphasis
on individual responsibility and development than on
regulatory measure. Consequently, education about and
prevention of alcohol-related problems will continue to be our
primary emphasis. Moreover, it is the intention of the
University that students as individuals and as members of
groups will conduct themselves in accordance with this and all
other University policies governing student conduct.
* Controlled substances are those defined in 21 U.S.C. 812 and
includc, but are not limited to such substances as marijuana,
heroin, cocaine and amphetamines
Policy
It is the policy of Stanford University to maintain a drug- free
workplace and campus. The unlawful manufacture,
distribution, dispensation, possession, and/or use of controlled
substances or the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of
alcohol is prohibited on the Stanford campus, in the workplace,
or as part of any of the University's activities. The workplace
and campus are presumed to include all Stanford premises
where the activities of the University are conducted. Violation
of this policy may result in disciplinary sanctions up to and
including termination of employment or expulsion of students.
Violations may also be referred to the appropriate authorities
for prosecution. This policy will be reviewed at least
biennially.
Some Application
* No University funds or funds collected by the University
may be used in a way which violates the policy.
While there are a few frosh at Stanford who are 21 or older,
and residence staff members often are in the 21 or older age
range, the fact remains that the great majority of residents of an
all-frosh dormitory are minors. Consequently, it is hard to
imagine how house dues for all -frosh residences could be used
to buy alcohol without violating both state law and University
policy.
* Notwithstanding the foregoing, regardless of how money is
collected, all provisions of the policy apply to all students,
faculty, and staff.
* Event planners will be held individually and collectively
responsible for planning and collectively responsible for
planning and carrying out events in compliance with the policy.
One or more house/organization officers must assume
responsibility for the event's compliance with the alcohol
policy. These officers' names must be made available to the
police and to the University upon request.
Consequences of Violation
Educational and rehabilitative measures will be the preferred
response to infractions unaccompanied by more egregious
conduct. However, behavior could run the gamut from a simple
Minor in Possession (of alcohol) with no prior disciplinary
history to drunken behavior resulting in loss of life. Penalties
will be calibrated according to the severity of the misconduct.
Behavior associated with drug or alcohol use and abuse may
constitute one or more of the following.
1. Violation of the University residence agreement or Terms
and Conditions of Fraternity Occupancy, subjecting the student
to loss of University housing.
2. Violation of student organization conditions of recognition,
subjecting the student to expulsion from organization and/or
the organization's loss of University recognition and associated
privileges.
3. Violation of the Fundamental Standard, subjecting the
student to University discipline which includes as a possible
outcome suspension or expulsion from Stanford.
Inebriation is not an excuse for misconduct but rather is an
aggravating circumstance. A student's careless or willful
reduction, through the use of alcohol or other intoxicants, of
his or her own ability to think clearly, exercise good judgment,
and respond to rational intervention is considered ground for
more stringent penalties than might be levied otherwise.
Residences or student organizations found to have violated the
policy arc subject, as groups, to University sanctions such as
suspension of social privileges and loss of University
recognition, meeting space, and housing, if applicable.
Civil Liability
While the law regarding civil liability is complex, it is
important to know that under some circumstances party hosts,
sponsors, bartenders, or others may be held legally liable for
the consequences of serving alcohol to underaged drinkers or
to obviously intoxicated persons.
Criminal Liability
Stanford University is not a sanctuary from the enforcement of
state and local laws. Students and others on campus who
violate the law may be and have been arrested and prosecuted.
Primary responsibility for law enforcement, including that
related to alcohol, rests with law enforcement agencies,
primarily the Stanford Police Department. Uniformed officers
who patrol the campus and respond to calls are deputized by
the sheriff of Santa Clara county and are fully empowered and
authorized to stop vehicles, make arrests, and enforce all upon
as a complete and careen citing of relevant laws. More
information is available at the Stanford Department of Public
Safety, 711 Serra Street.
Generally, as of September, 1990, it is a criminal offense:
1. To provide any alcoholic beverage to a person under 21
- Cal. Business and Professions code 25658
2. To provide any alcoholic beverage to an obviously

injuries. While any of these concerns can arise among people
who know each other, experience shows that they are more
common when gatherings are large and includc strangers.
* High school students should be afforded vigorous protection
from access to alcohol, if they are allowed to attend the event
at all. It is generally wiser to restrict attendance to college-aged
people or older.
* Designate plenty of sober monitors to help manage the party.
Station them at the front door and in the area where alcohol is
being served, and have some circulate inside and outside the
house to check other possible means of entry, attend to house
security, respond to problems, and so forth.
* Emphasize to the group sponsoring the event (e.g., a
residence, a fraternal group, a student voluntary organization),
that it is each member's responsibility to ensure that the event
is managed well and to exercise care for the well-being of all
participants.
* Exercise care and authority in hiring the band. Do not permit
members to bring minors ("friends of the band") to the event.
* Control the noise of the event. The farther away it can be
heard, the more likely you'll draw complaints and unwanted
guests.

OFFICIAL UNIVERSITY ANNOUNCEMENT
STANFORD UNIVERSITY'S POLICY ON CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND ALCOHOL
Student conduct is guided by the Fundamental Standard, which
states the expectation that students will act in ways that
demonstrate respect for order, morality, personal honor, and
that rights of others. Implicit in the Standard is the
understanding that students are responsible for making their
own decisions and accepting the consequences of those
decisions.
In order to make informed decisions about alcohol use,
students and others should be aware of the health and safety
risks associated with its use, as well as the state and local laws
about possessing, serving and consuming alcohol. It is widely
recognized that the misuse and abuse of drugs ("controlled
substances")* and the abuse of alcohol are major contributors
to serious health problems as well as to social and civic
concerns. The health risks associated with the use of illicit
drugs and the abuse of alcohol include various deleterious
physical and mental consequences including addiction, severe
disability, and death. Information concerning the known effects
of alcohol and specific drugs is available from the Alcohol and
Drug Information Center at the Cowell Students Health Center.
The goal of this policy is to reduce drug and alcohol abuse and
the human and material costs associated with it. The
University, as an educational institution, approaches student
conduct issues from a perspective that places greater emphasis
on individual responsibility and development than on
regulatory measure. Consequently, education about and
prevention of alcohol-related problems will continue to be our
primary emphasis. Moreover, it is the intention of the
University that students as individuals and as members of
groups will conduct themselves in accordance with this and all
other University policies governing student conduct.
* Controlled substances are those defined in 21 U.S.C. 812 and
includc, but are not limited to such substances as marijuana,
heroin, cocaine and amphetamines
Policy
It is the policy of Stanford University to maintain a drug- free
workplace and campus. The unlawful manufacture,
distribution, dispensation, possession, and/or use of controlled
substances or the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of
alcohol is prohibited on the Stanford campus, in the workplace,
or as part of any of the University's activities. The workplace
and campus are presumed to include all Stanford premises
where the activities of the University are conducted. Violation
of this policy may result in disciplinary sanctions up to and
including termination of employment or expulsion of students.
Violations may also be referred to the appropriate authorities
for prosecution. This policy will be reviewed at least
biennially.
Some Application
* No University funds or funds collected by the University
may be used in a way which violates the policy.
While there are a few frosh at Stanford who are 21 or older,
and residence staff members often are in the 21 or older age
range, the fact remains that the great majority of residents of an
all-frosh dormitory are minors. Consequently, it is hard to
imagine how house dues for all -frosh residences could be used
to buy alcohol without violating both state law and University
policy.
* Notwithstanding the foregoing, regardless of how money is
collected, all provisions of the policy apply to all students,
faculty, and staff.
* Event planners will be held individually and collectively
responsible for planning and collectively responsible for
planning and carrying out events in compliance with the policy.
One or more house/organization officers must assume
responsibility for the event's compliance with the alcohol
policy. These officers' names must be made available to the
police and to the University upon request.
Consequences of Violation
Educational and rehabilitative measures will be the preferred
response to infractions unaccompanied by more egregious
conduct. However, behavior could run the gamut from a simple
Minor in Possession (of alcohol) with no prior disciplinary
history to drunken behavior resulting in loss of life. Penalties
will be calibrated according to the severity of the misconduct.
Behavior associated with drug or alcohol use and abuse may
constitute one or more of the following.
1. Violation of the University residence agreement or Terms
and Conditions of Fraternity Occupancy, subjecting the student
to loss of University housing.
2. Violation of student organization conditions of recognition,
subjecting the student to expulsion from organization and/or
the organization's loss of University recognition and associated
privileges.
3. Violation of the Fundamental Standard, subjecting the
student to University discipline which includes as a possible
outcome suspension or expulsion from Stanford.
Inebriation is not an excuse for misconduct but rather is an
aggravating circumstance. A student's careless or willful
reduction, through the use of alcohol or other intoxicants, of
his or her own ability to think clearly, exercise good judgment,
and respond to rational intervention is considered ground for
more stringent penalties than might be levied otherwise.
Residences or student organizations found to have violated the
policy arc subject, as groups, to University sanctions such as
suspension of social privileges and loss of University
recognition, meeting space, and housing, if applicable.
Civil Liability
While the law regarding civil liability is complex, it is
important to know that under some circumstances party hosts,
sponsors, bartenders, or others may be held legally liable for
the consequences of serving alcohol to underaged drinkers or
to obviously intoxicated persons.
Criminal Liability
Stanford University is not a sanctuary from the enforcement of
state and local laws. Students and others on campus who
violate the law may be and have been arrested and prosecuted.
Primary responsibility for law enforcement, including that
related to alcohol, rests with law enforcement agencies,
primarily the Stanford Police Department. Uniformed officers
who patrol the campus and respond to calls are deputized by
the sheriff of Santa Clara county and are fully empowered and
authorized to stop vehicles, make arrests, and enforce all upon
as a complete and careen citing of relevant laws. More
information is available at the Stanford Department of Public
Safety, 711 Serra Street.
Generally, as of September, 1990, it is a criminal offense:
1. To provide any alcoholic beverage to a person under 21
- Cal. Business and Professions code 25658
2. To provide any alcoholic beverage to an obviously
intoxicated person
- Cal. Business and Professions Code 25602
3. For any person under age 21 to purchase alcohol
- Cal. Business and Profession Code 25628
4. To be under the influence of alcohol in a public place and
unable to exercise care for one's own safety or that of others
- Cal. Penal Code 647
5. For persons under 21 to have any container of alcohol in any
public place or any place open to the public
- Business and Professions code 25662
6. To operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of
alcohol or other intoxicants or with a blood alcohol level of
.08% or higher
-Cal. Vehicle Code 23152
7. To have an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle and
for persons under 21 to drive a vehicle carrying alcohol or to
possess alcohol while in a motor vehicle.
- Cal. vehicle code 23223, 23224
8. To have in one's possession or to use talse evidence of age
and identi to purchase alcohol.
- Cal. Business and Professions Code 25661
9. Illegally to manufacture, sell, distributive, or posses
controlled substances (those listed in Schedules I through V of
the controlled substances Act)
-21 USC 812; 21 USC 828, 841,844, 845, 845 a
10. Unlawfully to possess or possess for sale controlled
substances specified in California Health and Safety Code

11.To transport, sell, or distribute marijuana to a minor or to
use a minor to transport, sell, or distribute marijuana.
- Cal. Health and Safety 11361
THE ROLE OF RESIDENCE STAFF
PERTAINING TO STANFORD UNIVERSITY'S
POLICY ON CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES
AND ALCOHOL
The role of Resident Assistants and Resident Fellows
("resident staff') at Stanford is principally educational,
advisory, and developmental. It is crucial that students trust
their staff members and feel comfortable confiding in them,
turning to them freely for assistance whenever they need it. As
role models and as employees and agents of the University,
residence staff are expected to comply with the controlled
Substances and Alcohol Policy themselves. For example, they
must not provide to minors, nor may they allow program funds
under their control to be used in a way which violates the
policy. With regard to the policy, residence staff members are
expected to work with students in the following ways.
As educators, residence staff should help ensure that students
are made aware of University policy, pertinent California law,
and the health risks associated with the use and abuse of
alcohol and other drugs.
As advisors, residence staff should urge sensible party
planning and management and help students in their efforts to
abide by the event planning guidelines.
As community builders, RAs and RFs should work closely
with residents to create and maintain a safe and healthful
residential environment.
Resident Assistants and Resident Fellows are not expected to
police or monitor the conduct of students, or to receive or act
upon reports of violations. They are expected to exercise the
same judgment concerning this policy as they do with other
University policies. For example, they must continue to
intervene and exercise responsible guidance any time they are
aware of any situation that is threatening to the health or safety
of individuals or groups.
THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND
ALCOHOL POLICY GUIDELINES FOR
EVENT PLANNERS
The following guidelines are meant to assist students in
planning and managing events in ways that are in compliance
with the controlled Substances and Alcohol Policy. The
guidelines apply to all students planning events on the Stanford
campus or any off-campus University program or activity. The
list below, drawn up for events at which alcohol will will be
served, is not exhaustive. Individuals and groups are
responsible for developing strategies for planning and carrying
out events that are safe and in compliance with University
policy.
* If you choose to serve alcohol at all, make it an adjunct to the
event, not the center of it.
* Ensure that non-alcoholic drinks (EANABS) arc at least as
accessible and attractive as, and more plentiful than, alcoholic
drinks. The amount of alcohol provided should be reasonable
and in proportion to the number of event participants who are
legally able to drink.
* Create an atmosphere in which people are encouraged to
interact, and are helped to feel comfortable - have something
for people to do besides just stand around and drink.
* Encourage moderation by using moderate-sized glasses and
cups.
* Have the alcohol in a secure part of the room where access
can be readily controlled. Ensure that it is attended at all times,
and have it served rather than leaving it open to self-service.
Make sure that servers have been trained in responsible alcohol
serving.
* Stop serving alcohol at least an hour before the end of the
event, and make sure you have plenty of other beverages and
snacks left to serve at this time.
* Refuse to serve someone who has had too much to drink.
* Do not let an intoxicated person drive!
* If the event is advertised, do not mention alcohol in the
publicity.
* If the event is open to people who arc not known to the
residence or the organization, take extra precautions to guard
against problems such as theft, assault, drunken driving,
individuals wandering off in need of assistance, and possible
injuries. While any of these concerns can arise among people
who know each other, experience shows that they are more
common when gatherings are large and includc strangers.
* High school students should be afforded vigorous protection
from access to alcohol, if they are allowed to attend the event
at all. It is generally wiser to restrict attendance to college-aged
people or older.
* Designate plenty of sober monitors to help manage the party.
Station them at the front door and in the area where alcohol is

house to check other possible means of entry, attend to house
security, respond to problems, and so forth.
* Emphasize to the group sponsoring the event (e.g., a
residence, a fraternal group, a student voluntary organization),
that it is each member's responsibility to ensure that the event
is managed well and to exercise care for the well-being of all
participants.
* Exercise care and authority in hiring the band. Do not permit
members to bring minors ("friends of the band") to the event.
* Control the noise of the event. The farther away it can be
heard, the more likely you'll draw complaints and unwanted
guests.
