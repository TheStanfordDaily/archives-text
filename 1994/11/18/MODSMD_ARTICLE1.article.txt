# Grape Policy Committee to release report
## 
### Kiran Srinivas Contributing writer 
Stanford's Grape Policy Committee, which has
gathered most of the information it needs to issue a
final report, will soon hold a community hearing to
solicit more ideas about the possibility of a Univer
sity-wide ban on grapes.
The committee, headed by Political Science Prof.
Luis Fraga, is hoping to submit a report to Univer
sity officials by the end of the fall quarter.
"We are right now looking over the factual infor
mation. We are beginning to draft early sections of
our report," said Fraga, who is also director of the
school's Center for Chicano Research. "We have yet
to make a formal decision or recommendation."
The committee — consisting of four faculty mem
bers, two senior staff members, two graduate stu
dents and two undergraduates — has received in
formation from many sources, including the United
Farm Workers Union, the state's Department of
Pesticide Regulations and last
year's hunger strikers, Fraga
said.
Four Chicana students staged
a three-day hunger strike in the
Quad last May, demanding among
other things a University-wide
ban on grapes. They were con
cerned for the many Chicano
migrant workers who endure pes
ticides, low wages and harsh
working conditions in California
grape fields.
"We have been meeting weekly
since early October," Fraga said.
"We have met with a diverse set of
individuals and have seen a
diverse set of perspectives."

But the committee, which has
divided into subcommittees to
better research the grape issue,
wants to hear from a wider range
of people, Fraga said.
Consequently it has decided to
hold a public hearing in Kresge
Auditorium on Nov. 28 from 6 to
8 p.m. Community members can
reserve a five-minute presenta
tion time by calling the Center for
Chicano Research at 723-3914.
This open forum, Fraga said,
"will allow the committee to solic
it ideas and information from a
broad cross-section of the Stan
ford community."
Fraga said individuals who
want to see the documents the
committee has reviewed so far can
find them in El Centro Chicano,
the reserves at Meyer Library, the
Office of Multicultural Develop

ment or the Office of the Academ
ic Secretary.
University officials created the
committee in response to last
year's hunger strike. Other objec
tives of the strike were to form a
Chicano Studies program, develop
a community center in East Palo
Alto and request a formal apology
to Cecilia Burciaga.
Burciaga was the University's
highest-ranking Chicana admin
istrator prior to being laid off.
Along with the Grape Policy
Committee, the University
formed committees to discuss the
Chicano Studies issue and the
East Palo Alto community center
issue.
The other two committees are
also expected to present their
evaluations to University officials
by the end of this quarter.
