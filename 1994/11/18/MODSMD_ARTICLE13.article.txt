## Irish Prime Minister resigns amid scandal over judicial appointment 
### 
DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) â€” Weeks after
being hailed as a hero for helping bring
about an IRA cease-fire, Prime Minister
Albert Reynolds resigned yesterday in a
scandal over a priest accused of child
molestation.
His departure left lawmakers stunned,
the government facing a potentially tortu
ous road to repair, and prospects for the
Northern Ireland peace process uncertain.
"In life ... you can't win them all," a
grim-looking Reynolds told a hushed par
liament as lawmakers were about to take a
no-confidence vote on his coalition govern
ment.
A judge whose appointment precipitat
ed the crisis resigned several hours later. A
few days ago his resignation might have
saved the government, but by yesterday
the damage was beyond repair and all par
ties agreed Reynolds was right to step
down.
His voice breaking and close to tears,
Reynolds told parliament the main
achievement of his 22-month government
was "the breakthrough to peace in North

ern Ireland," and he was stepping down to
keep negotiations from being derailed.
"A terrible cycle of death has been
brought to an end," he said. The IRA
began a cease-fire on Sept. 1 and pro-
British Protestant gunmen announced
their own truce Oct. 13.
Reynolds' departure paves the way for
his Fianna Fail party, which has been a
major player in the peace process, to elect
a new leader and perhaps return to power
in a new coalition.
Reynolds and his ministers submitted
their resignations to President Mary
Robinson yesterday afternoon. Reynolds
said he was not asking for a general elec
tion.
The Labor Party withdrew from the
governing coalition Wednesday over the
appointment of former attorney general
Harry Whelehan as president of Ireland's
High Court. Labor was unsatisfied with
Reynolds' explanation of why Whelehan's
office had failed to act on an extradition
warrant for a Catholic priest accused of
molesting children.

Whelehan, sworn in as president of the
High Court just three days earlier,
announced yesterday that he too would
resign despite the "unjust attacks" against
him.
Labor opposed Whelehan, a conserva
tive Catholic, because he failed for seven
months to extradite the Rev. Brendan
Smyth to Northern Ireland to face child
molestation charges. Smyth eventually
returned under orders from Cardinal
Cahal Daly and is serving a four-year sen
tence.
Irish and British ministers had been
working for several months on a frame
work for inter-party talks in Northern Ire
land. Sinn Fein, the IRA's political part
ner, had just joined the mainstream
debate.
"There's a sense of bewilderment and
disbelief that this has happened given
(Reynolds') outstanding achievements,
particularly in relation to Northern Ire
land ... which will secure his place in his
tory," said Michael Martin, a Fianna Fail
lawmaker.


Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds meets with President Mary Robinson to tender
his resignation yesterday as the parliament prepared to debate a motion of no confi
dence in his government.
