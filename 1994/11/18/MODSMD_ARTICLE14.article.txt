# White House gunman indicted
## Shooter faces life in prison if guilty of attempted assassination 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Colorado man accused of an
assault-rifle attack on the White
House last month was indicted
yesterday on a new charge of
trying to assassinate President
Clinton. Francisco Martin
Duran, who pleaded innocent,
could face up to life in prison if
convicted.
U.S. Attorney Eric Holder
said prosecutors plan to prove
that Duran intended to kill the
president when he allegedly
fired about 29 rounds from a
semiautomatic rifle at the White
House from a public sidewalk.
Clinton was in the White
House at the time of the Oct. 29
attack. The mansion was struck

by several gunshots, but nobody
was hurt.
Duran did not speak during
his arraignment before U.S.
District Judge Charles R.
Richey. Public defender Leigh
A. Kenny entered the plea on
his behalf.
Prosecutors filed court
papers asking Duran's lawyers
to disclose whether they plan to
assert an insanity defense.
Richey gave Duran's lawyers
until Monday to reply.
The judge did not immediate
ly rule on a request by The
Washington Post, The New
York Times and NBC television
that he release a letter written
by Duran that was the basis for

a government-requested compe
tency examination of the defen
dant. A psychiatrist found that
he was able to understand the
charges against him.
Public defender A.J. Kramer
told Richey the letter should not
be released, at least for now,
because it could cause prejudice
against Duran.
"This letter says nothing
about the president. ... It has
nothing to say about any harm
intended to the president,"
Kramer said.
Duran, 26, of Colorado
Springs, was arrested on the
Pennsylvania Avenue sidewalk
after he was tackled by two
bystanders.
