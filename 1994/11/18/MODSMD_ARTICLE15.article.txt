Aristide names new eommander
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide named a new army com
mander yesterday, hoping to succeed this time in
subordinating Haiti's traditionally dominant mil
itary to civilian rule.
The last military chief Aristide appointed,
Raoul Cedras, turned on Aristide just seven
months into his presidency, then brutally ruled
Haiti until 20,000 American troops intervened in
September to send him packing.
The appointment of Brig. Gen. Bernardin Pois
son, an obscure American- and French-trained
soldier who had led the military's firefighting
division, bore several parallels to that of Cedras.
Both were considered technocrats and supported
by the international community. Neither ever
held a field command, and both leapfrogged over
several more experienced candidates.
The choice carries great risks. Cedras ultimate

ly chose to back his restive soldiers in overturning
democracy; Poisson will have to overcome the
expected resistance within the ranks to Aristide's
plan to separate the police from the military and
slash the number of soldiers from 7,450 to 1,500.
Tropical Storm runs up coast
MIAMI (AP) — After taking a zigzag path that
left hundreds dead in Haiti and ravaged winter
vegetable crops in Florida, Tropical Storm Gor
don confounded forecasters by turning into a hur
ricane yesterday and swirling up the East Coast.
By late afternoon the hurricane had kicked up
high surf and winds along the North Carolina
coast but wasn't expected to hit land anywhere
along the Eastern Seaboard.
"It's overcast and it's blowing. It's just like a
typical nasty little storm for us," said Bob
Touhey, an innkeeper in Ocracoke, on North Car
olina's Outer Banks.
