Early admissions a start
to improving yield rate,
but not the final answer

IF YOU ARE an undergraduate,
odds are that Stanford was your
first choice. If not, you have
probably changed your mind by
now. And if even by now you're still
wishing you had gone somewhere
else, pick up the national weather
report next month and check out
the single digits next to Boston or
New Haven. Those are not typos.
Current feelings aside, all under
grads remember the long and often
painful wait that begins when their
application is mailed off. But Stan
ford has taken pity on the nation's
nervous high school students, and
at the same time done itself a favor.
The new early decision admission
program is long overdue.
The new program will allow high
school seniors willing to commit to
Stanford if accepted do just that.
Beginning next year, applicants can
file by Nov. 1 and receive an answer
as early as mid-December, or apply
by the normal Dec. 15 deadline and
hear as early as February.
High school students who are
sure they want to come here should
be allowed to let the admissions
office know that. There is some
thing inherently unfair about the
notion that the admissions office
may be unable to differentiate
between one student who would
trade his dog to come to Stanford
and another student who is apply
ing simply to appease his stuffy
parents.
In addition, early admissions is
helpful to the psyche of admitted
students. They can begin their sec
ond-semester senior year (arguably
the most lax point American cul
ture affords) early. If admitted by
Dec. 15, they may be even be able to
bag their first semester finals. Tak
ing this one step further (and
maybe too fan, these students will

be better rested and have more
time to reflect before college.
Obviously, there is more to this
than genuine concern for the
applicants. The primary goal of
the admissions office is and
should be to assemble the best
possible freshman class. Just
about every other nationally com
petitive private college has an
early admissions program, and
not having one has hurt Stan
ford's ability to enroll some stu
dents. According to Dean of
Admissions James Montoya, of
130 admitted students who
enrolled in other schools, 34 (or
26 percent) said they would have
considered Stanford if it had an
early decision program.
In addition to gathering the
strongest possible class, Stanford
administrators must be somewhat
motivated by the fact that yield
rates (the percentage of students
who actually enroll after admis
sion) are one way that various enti
ties such as the U.S. News and
World Report compare colleges.
Indeed, these factors may go
hand in hand because as Stan
ford's reported rankings (which
mean little to anyone but college
applicants, administrators and
the aforementioned stuffy par
ents) go up, so should the yield
rate. Another factor affecting this
ratio, according to Montoya, is the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and
student fears that another may
hit.
While the new early decision
program may help the yield rate
and net the freshman class a few
more top-notch applicants, there is
a very important caveat to all of
this. Students do not come to Stan
ford for magazine rankings and
they do not go elsewhere for seis
mic stability. They come here for
the education and for the campus.
Stanford must not forget that a
focus on the undergraduate educa
tion is the only real way to keep the
college at its best and the yield rate
at its highest.
