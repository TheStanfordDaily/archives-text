At heart of'Chief 9 controversy are complex, weighty issues

I AM WRITING in response to the recent
debate over The Stanford Review's nega
tive and derogatory portrayal of Native
Americans through their use of "The Chief."
This issue is driving me up the wall. Do I
find the portrayal offensive? Certainly. Does
it keep me awake at night? Never. I simply
don't have enough respect for The Review or
their obvious publicity stunt for it to upset
me too much.
What upsets me is that they have been so
annoyingly successful at twisting issues to
serve their own crusade against political cor
rectness. I don't have a problem with The
Review's crusade, per se, but I do have a
problem with Native Americans providing
the medium through which The Review
gains further free publicity.

The unfortunate thing for Indians, and
the most disturbing aspect of The Review's
racist caricature, is that people only pay
attention to Native Americans when we're
either used as someone's mascot or in buck
skin and turquoise, fighting the good fight
for the liberal left. This automatic associa
tion of Native Americans with the left is sim
ply not accurate. We are not a homogenous
group, and while there are radical factions,
we are not radicals or leftists. Stanford alone
has nearly 200 Native American students
representing over 50 different nations.
We are multiculturalism. We are diversi
ty. In the past this has been both a hin
drance and an advantage for us. On this
issue, however, support is across the board.
In two days, we have amassed over 100 sig

natures from Native American students on
campus protesting The Review's caricature,
and the numbers are still growing.
I don't think, however, that any of us
want to be talking about mascots for the rest
of the year. We are not here to talk about
mascots or give publicity to The Review. We
are nere as students. Many of us are here for
the betterment of our communities; to serve
as doctors, lawyers, writers or even (shudder)
politicians.
If we're going to talk about Indians, let's
talk about the issues confronting Indians
today. The mascot is just the very tip of the
iceberg. It's something that gets Indians in
the media, but often hides the real legacy of
genocide that is still with us today. Let's talk
about 80 percent unemployment on Ameri

ca's reservations; let's talk about land claims,
century-old unenforced treaties, a dismal
education system and an impenetrable
bureaucracy called the Bureau of Indian
Affairs.
Do I care about The Review or their mas
cot? Yes, to the extent that it reminds me of
the ignorance that pervades our society
about Indians. I care more, however, about
my cousins and uncles whose reality dictates
more respect from me than some stupid
mascot. If we can somehow shift the empha
sis of this attention from mascots to Indians
and from The Review to the real issues, then
maybe all of this nonsense will be worth
while.
