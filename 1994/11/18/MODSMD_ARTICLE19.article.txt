# Cowell's HIV counselors take their job seriously, undergo rigorous training
## 
### 
Despite the good intentions of The
Daily's journalist, the Nov. 4 article
covering the Anonymous HIV Antibody
Testing Peer Counselor Program at
Cowell Student Health Center inaccu
rately portrayed the members of our
program in a "corny" manner. Having
spent more than two and a half years
counseling and developing the program
as a coordinator, I feel compelled to
respond.
Our counselors take their job very
seriously. They undergo rigorous train
ing in both HIV biology/policy and
counseling techniques, stay up-to-date
on current HIV/AIDS findings and
strive to refine their counseling tech
niques. Their backgrounds range from
working directly with HIV positive
patients through community-based
organizations to working with Project

SAVE. Each counselor works on a com
mittee in addition to assuming counsel
ing responsibilities, to divide up the
heavy work load of maintaining and
developing a student-run group.
Contrary to the article, Hershey's
syrup is not a regular topic of our group
â€” Stanford students are smarter than
that. They tend to know and avoid mix
ing common oil-based lubricants with
the use of condoms and dental dams.
Instead common topics discussed at our
weekly meetings are more likely to
include: the risk associated with oral
sex without a barrier or how to work
with a patient who wants to discuss
statistics rather than his/her own
behavior.
Another inaccuracy is the claim that
we are a group of jubilant latex evange
lists. This is a gross exaggeration. As a
group, we are primarily concerned with:
educating students on HIV and the HIV
antibody test; lowering barriers for
high risk students through testing in a
non-judgmental, supportive environ
ment with a peer; assessing with the
student his/her level of risk; challeng-

ing and empowering students to lower
their risk by exploring options and per
ceived barriers to risk reduction; mak
ing referrals to outside support groups
as necessary; and facilitating entry into
early intervention programs for those
students who test positive.
We promote safer sex, as well as
abstinence, but this is done in the con
text of helping the student focus on
viable risk lowering activities which
he/she can readily employ to reduce
risky behavior. Counseling sessions
often include discussions of sexually
transmitted diseases as well as decision
making under the influence of alcohol
and other drugs to promote sexual
health and encourage students to take
active responsibility for taking care of
themselves.
The program has grown from the
ideas of three students and support from
Cowell and Student Affairs Staff to a
well-developed and well-utilized program.
We have helped students and administra
tors at UC-Santa Cruz set up a program
on their campus and are continually
sought after to provide information for

other college health programs. As pro
gram coordinator, I documented the
essential principles and policies associat
ed with the program in a 30-page chap
ter, "Perspectives on HIV Antibody Test
Peer Counseling" to be included in the
third edition of "D'Andrea's Peer Coun
seling," a book used in colleges across the
country to teach the fundamentals of
peer counseling.
To correct additional misinforma
tion, photographs of peer counselors
are displayed on the first floor of Cowell
to help ensure anonymity. Also, my
motivation for becoming an HrV peer
counselor includes three primary rea
sons: wanting to get involved in public
health, hoping to apply my recent skills
in peer counseling to a new program I
could help develop and desiring to
speak candidly and openly to promote
sexual health, which seemed to be diffi
cult for several health professionals I
observed.
