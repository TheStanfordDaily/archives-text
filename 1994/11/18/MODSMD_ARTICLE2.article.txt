# IFC reviews Theta Delts
## Results of investigation expected next week 
### Jason Waggoner Staff writer 
Only two months alter its reactivation as a housed
fraternity, Theta Delta Chi may suffer a social sus
pension based on the Inter fraternity Council's judi
cial review of an incident which occurred last month.
The incident involved an intoxicated Stanford
graduate student who was head-butted by a group of
high school students from East Palo Alto at a party
at tb,e house Oct. 14.
The judicial board's decision on the incident is ex
pected to come out next week, said Nanci Howe, di
rector of the Office of Student Activities.
Because the case is still under review, Howe did
not discuss the specifics of the issue.
However, she did say that "there was a problem at
a party where someone was hurt. We're trying to ad
dress how to have safer parties in the future."
Howe said that the judicial board has taken into
account the fraternity's regulation of alcohol at the
party. "The person (at the party)
was intoxicated," she said.
When situations like last
month's head-butting incident
happen, "we're concerned with
how the alcohol was handled," she
said.

Howe stressed that the Theta
Delt situation is not unusual. "We
have party problems a lot. Then we
try to deal with them," she said.
The IFC judicial board consists
of representatives from several
fraternities who investigate disci
plinary matters and make recom
mendations on how to handle
future conflicts.
The Theta Delts may face pro
bation — a period of time with no

parties — or community service if
the board finds the fraternity neg
ligent.
"We are under review by the
Greek judicial board and we will
be happy to work with the board
and the Office of Student Activi
ties," Theta Delt President Cyd
Zeigler said.
Currently, the fraternity is not
having parties because of the judi
cial board review.
