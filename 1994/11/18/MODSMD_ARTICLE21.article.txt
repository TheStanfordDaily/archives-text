## Sally Cole Does Stanford need exam proctors?

£ £ YES, THE HONOR
Code is important
but it puts the bur
den on other students,
not the teacher or admin
istration, to police it. This
is unfair. Proctor exams."
A female graduate stu
dent expressed this opin
ion last spring in a survey

of the effectiveness of the Stanford Honor
Code, conducted by the Student Conduct
Legislative Council. If the survey results
are representative of general student views
on this topic, her opinion has widespread
support.
Why is that? Why are Stanford stu
dents, and students at many other schools
with Honor Code systems, so resistant to
the idea of taking action when they witness
the dishonesty of others?
I believe that this reluctance stems from
a general ambivalence in our society about
the role of citizens who witness miscon
duct. We give a medal to the person who
chases down a purse-snatcher but we need
to pass laws to protect the corporate whis
tle-blower from the retaliation of those
who consider loyalty the supreme virtue.
And many of us were reared, and rear our
children, to believe that tattling is never
acceptable — especially if the offender is a
sibling, friend or teammate.
It's no wonder that many Stanford stu
dents, after 18 or more years of such social
ization, reject the institutionally-imposed

obligation to accept responsibility for the
conduct of others.
And what do we faculty and staff do to
help them understand and accept this obli
gation? Not much, in my opinion. Many of
us are ambivalent ourselves about this
aspect of the Honor Code, the requirement
that students take some form of action in
the face of peer dishonesty.
Some schools make it even harder on
students by requiring reporting, allowing
no other response. By contrast, Stanford's
Honor Code states: "A primary responsi
bility assumed by students is to discourage
violations of the Honor Code by others.
Various methods are possible. Drawing
attention to a suspected violation may stop
it. Moral suasion may be effective. Initiat
ing formal procedures is a necessary and
obligatory remedy when other methods are
inappropriate or have failed. Faculty mem
bers have like responsibilities when sus
pected violations come to their attention."
("Interpretations and Applications," 2.[a])
Thus the Stanford approach to academ
ic integrity encourages students to consid
er the complexity of the situation and fig
ure out the best course of action. The Code
says, in effect, "You're an intelligent and
capable person. You decide what to do.
Make sure, though, that you do some
thing."
Almost nobody believes that academic
dishonesty is acceptable. Understandable
sometimes, but not acceptable. Student
willingness to enforce the Honor Code,

though, is the quid pro quo for no proc
tored examinations. Can Stanford stu
dents and faculty rely upon this willing
ness when it is put to a real test?
Sometimes students simply lack the
vocabulary to confront cheating in
progress. They see it, are angered and dis
tracted by it and want to do something, but
they can't decide what to do. So they seethe
silently, do poor work on their own exams,
and report the problem to the instructor
afterwards. At this point, there is no per
mitted alternative to a formal report to
Judicial Affairs, an investigation, and pos
sible discipline including a one-quarter
suspension, a No Credit in the class and a
40-hour work penalty.
The witnesses could have done every
one a favor had they been able to stoft the
problem by saying, for example, "Hey, cut
that out!" (Dean of Student Affairs Emeri
tus Jim Lyons offers another example
from Haverford where cheating witnesses
respond by tapping their pencils on their
desks and staring at the offender. He says
that this form of social pressure was very
effective in stopping cheating.) In any case,
instructors can help students overcome
this temporary paralysis by encouraging
them to speak out and by offering exam
ples of potentially effective strategies.
The rest of us, teachers and staff alike,
could also do a better job of helping stu
dents to display the courage of their con-

victions. Stanford is in the
business of training the next
generation of national and
world leaders, but we're not
squarely facing the ethical
dimension of that training.
Our country and our world
desperately need courageous
leadership; people who will
speak out for what is right
rather than swaying with the
latest "approval rating."
Exams aren't proctored in
real life. People succeed or
falter based upon the
strength of their mettle.
They are helped to succeed by
the willingness of friends and
colleagues to speak out when
the temptation appears to
cheat, or lie, or steal, or hurt
someone.
Actually, the exams of life
are proctored and guess
what, folks? We are the proc
tors.

and report the problem to the instructor
afterwards. At this point, there is no per
mitted alternative to a formal report to
Judicial Affairs, an investigation, and pos
sible discipline including a one-quarter
suspension, a No Credit in the class and a
40-hour work penalty.
The witnesses could have done every
one a favor had they been able to stoft the
problem by saying, for example, "Hey, cut
that out!" (Dean of Student Affairs Emeri
tus Jim Lyons offers another example
from Haverford where cheating witnesses
respond by tapping their pencils on their
desks and staring at the offender. He says
that this form of social pressure was very
effective in stopping cheating.) In any case,
instructors can help students overcome
this temporary paralysis by encouraging
them to speak out and by offering exam
ples of potentially effective strategies.
The rest of us, teachers and staff alike,
could also do a better job of helping stu
dents to display the courage of their con-

victions. Stanford is in the
business of training the next
generation of national and
world leaders, but we're not
squarely facing the ethical
dimension of that training.
Our country and our world
desperately need courageous
leadership; people who will
speak out for what is right
rather than swaying with the
latest "approval rating."
Exams aren't proctored in
real life. People succeed or
falter based upon the
strength of their mettle.
They are helped to succeed by
the willingness of friends and
colleagues to speak out when
the temptation appears to
cheat, or lie, or steal, or hurt
someone.
Actually, the exams of life
are proctored and guess
what, folks? We are the proc
tors.
