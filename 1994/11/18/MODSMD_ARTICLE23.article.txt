MOSCOW, RUSSIA
IT WOULD BE like the Fourth of
July, Rosh Hashanah, Christmas,
Ramadan and whatever other major
holiday you can think of all rolled into
one. Two Mondays ago, Russia took a
day off from work (and the Stanford in
Moscow program took a day off from
class) to celebrate the October Revolu
tion holiday (yes, the holiday is actually
in November — the Russian calendar
was changed after the Revolution to con
form with the rest of the world).
The day was meant to commemorate
the Bolshevik storming of the Winter
Palace in St. Petersburg (at the time
called Petrograd, then Leningrad, now
once again St. Petersburg) where they
wrested power away from the provision
al government and created what eventu
ally became the C.P.S.U. (B) — Commu
nist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolshe
viks). In communist times, this was the
most important holiday of the entire
year, complete with the obligatory mili
tary parades through Red Square and
resplendent banners proclaiming the

glory of October 1917.
But where is the place for such a hol
iday now in a state where communism
has fallen? Even though the Lenin Mau
soleum on Red Square was open (it's
usually closed on Mondays) and most
people had the day off work, President
Boris Yeltsin tried to make little of the
holiday by reporting to work with his
entire staff.
The communists were out in full
regalia, starting their march from the
Oktyabrskaya (October) Metro station
where the largest statue of Lenin
remains. They proceeded to Lubyanka
Square, the former location of the K.G.B.
headquarters, the Central Party Head
quarters and the Youth Communist
League (the building where the Stanford
in Moscow center now preaches their ide
ologies to a different shade of red).
As the marchers arrived in the
Square, music blared over loudspeakers
proclaiming "Sovietsky Soyuz (Soviet
Union)" and "Den Pobedi (Day of Victo
ry)." Mostly elderly, many marchers
wore pins with profiles of Lenin or Stal
in, and carried various signs condemn

ing Yeltsin, telling the Yankees to go
home (that's us), or just proclaiming the
past glory of what used to be one of the
two world superpowers.
As I photographed the many
babushkas participating in the events,
one yelled at me and asked why journal
ists only take pictures of the older people.
In fact, during one person's speech, a
speaker pointed to a Stanford student as
evidence that the youth were also in
agreement with their motives. The major
ity of the young among the demonstrators
were small children who were shouting
slogans — the ramifications of which they
could not possibly comprehend.
And the communists were not the only
ones who came out for the festivities. The
nationalists had a table where they were
selling their propaganda, including a
book entitled "The Truth of the Jews," a
pamphlet explaining how the mistakes of
the communists were caused by Jewish
revolutionaries. I bought a pin depicting
the Beli Dom (the White House, where
the former Russian parliament was locat
ed) up in smoke as it was last year, with
flags which hearkened back to the

monarchist past. There were people car
rying flags with an icon of Jesus Christ
against a red background, in what
seemed to be some kind of non-sensical
combination of Communist and Chris
tian ideology. You could buy a book about
Stalin's life for the sum of 3,500 rubles
(about $1.10). Even the kiosks that pro
liferate Moscow in their blossoming form
of capitalism were giving out free "C
Praznikom (Happy Holiday)" flags with
the purchase of a Coca Cola.
And in this very paradox — where
capitalism meets communism — lies the
enigma that Russia is now experiencing.
The Lenin statues and monuments still
stand, but are now accompanied by
advertisements for shares in banks and
candy bars. You can still wait in three
different lines at a store to buy a piece of
state-produced cheese, but if you go
across the street you can shop with your
credit card for imported food in a West
ern-style supermarket. A policeman at
the march said there were 5,000 people
present, while later reports cited any
where from 10,000 to 30,000. But this is
nothing compared to the 500,000 people

that the communists said would turn
out for the "meeting" and the 10 million
people who live in Moscow.
Change is coming to Eastern Europe,
but at the same time the West often has
the misconception that this change will
mean that Russia will also become like
the United States, Germany, Japan or
other models of Western economic suc
cess. As Russia shifts towards a new
type of government during this transi
tion, we cannot be entirely certain what
will result. But whatever happens, it will
be a path that Russia has long struggled
to follow — toward a true democracy.
And maybe getting a free Revolution
holiday flag with a Coca Cola is just Rus
sia's way of dealing with the past and
the immense changes that the future
will bring.
