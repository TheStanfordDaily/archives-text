# Four see theses hit bookstore shelves
## 
### Joanna Dickler 
Not many Stanford undergraduates expect
to see their honors theses wind up on book
shelves in the "Stanford Authors" section of
the Bookstore or find themselves giving read
ings of their own fiction there.
But in the case of four former students,
that's exactly what happened.
Michael Friedly, Leslie Hatamiya and
Doug Stewart all wrote theses that were rec
ognized as among the top 10 percent of hon
ors work written the year they graduated.
Ultimately, all three theses — researched
and written with the support of grants from
the Office of Undergraduate Research
Opportunities — went on to be published as
books.
Stewart remembered with some lingering
astonishment the time when the University
of Texas Press called him about his thesis on
the Amazonian rainforest.
"They called me and said, 'We'd like to
publish your book. Would you like to let us
read it?' I said, 'Are you kidding?'"
A fourth student, 1990 grad David Vann,
was able to devote time to fiction writing
with the support of two URO grants. Some of
that work landed on the pages of the
"Atlantic Monthly" as Vann's first published
story, "Ichthyology."
"The best thing about the grant was that
it gave me time to write, to not have to take
on another job in the summer," Vann said.
URO — the funding resource for the four
authors — awards $300,000 in grants each
year to undergraduates who submit propos
als for academic research or artistic creation
projects. Although students embark on pro
jects hoping for self-generated discovery and
academic accomplishment, they typically
don't plan or expect to have the results of
their work published.
Laura Selznick, director of URO, notes
that "many high-quality theses find their
way into publication in professional and
scholarly journals or literature," but said

having a book published as the result of an
honors thesis is rather unusual.
She also said it takes "encouragement and
support on the part of the faculty member"
who sponsors a URO grantee, to get pub
lished.
1990 grad Leslie Hatamiya said her thesis
on the legislative redress for Japanese-Amer
ican victims of the World War II internment
camps was published largely at the urging of
her advisor, Political Science Prof. David
Brady.
Hatamiya said that throughout the writ
ing of her thesis, Brady suggested it could be
turned into a book. He took the finished
manuscript to Stanford University Press.
The final product, "Righting A Wrong:
Japanese Americans and the Passage of the
Civil Liberties Act of 1988," became the first
undergraduate thesis they had ever pub
lished.
Hatamiya recalled how it was "such a
relief to get the book in my hand and think,
'Oh my God, it's done.'"
Her reaction makes sense, considering the
amount of rewriting a thesis must undergo
to take on the form of a publishable book.
Undergraduate theses are written to compile
scholarly findings, and are not always creat
ed with the idea of a broad-ranging, more
commercial audience in mind.
Doug Stewart received the call from the
University of Texas Press in May 1992. His
book, "After the Trees: Living on the
Transamazon Highway," was not ready for
publication until the summer of 1993.
Even then, the press took another year to
produce the finished product, coming out
with the book this fall.
"For an academic press, that's pretty
quick," Stewart said.
For 1992 grad Mike Friedly — now a grad
uate student at Duke University — the pro
cess was much more expedient.
Friedly's thesis on Malcolm X was pub
lished the same year of his graduation by
Carroll and Graf in New York, a non-aca

demic press, as "Malcolm X: The Assassina
tion."
Friedly said there was "a huge amount of
interest around the country that year' in his
topic because of the release of the Spike Lee
film, "Malcolm X."
The book came out a week before the
opening of the film, "not a coincidence,"
according to Friedly.
The thrill of publication would be nothing,
though, if not for the author's memory of
painstaking research and the fulfilling pro
cess of unearthing knowledge.
Friedly spent a considerable amount of
time at the FBI Building in Washington,
D.C., sorting through archived files on Mal
colm X, some of which had not been released
to the public and had portions of documents
blacked out.
He said it was "a great thrill to be digging
into something, to be uncovering things no
one had looked at before." In effect, he said,
he was trying to solve a "mystery in histo-
T y-
The research process could also be a very
personal experience, an opportunity for self
discovery as well as academic revelation.
Vann used some of his URO funding to take
a trip to Ketchikan, Alaska, where he
researched the background for "Ichthyolo
gy," a largely autobiographical story based
on the death of his father.
By visiting places where his father had
lived, where Vann himself had lived and talk
ing to people his father had known, Vann
said he was "researching I his 1 own past as
well as his Ifather's] past."
"It's been really only by the grace of these
programs," that Vann was able to concen
trate on writing and choose it as his calling,
he said. He is now writing under a Stegner
fellowship at Stanford.
"Universities, in many ways, fill in for
what in the past might have been patronage
or other forms of sponsorship," he said. "A
university is where a young writer can go
today. . .and get support for writing."

This student is one of many who have had their honors theses
turned into books.
