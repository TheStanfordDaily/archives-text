## BIG GAME 1994: THE 97TH YEAR If adage 'the worse the record the better the game' holds true, this year's Battle for the Axe promises excitement 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
For a team that has failed to pro
duce headlines on the field, Stan
ford sure is doing its best to stay in
the news off the field.
From senior quarterback Steve
Stenstrom's surgery on his little
finger which ended his season last
week to the recent speculation
about head coach Bill Walsh's
future at Stanford, the spotlight
has been temporarily pulled away
from the 97th Big Game this Satur
day at 12:30 p.m. at Californias
Memorial Stadium.
Both the Cardinal (3-6-1, 2-5 in

the Pacific 10 Conference) and the
Golden Bears (3-7, 2-5) have faced
difficult years and have little to
show for their hard work. However,
a victory Saturday could go a long
way to easing the bumps and bruis
es of a losing season.
"We're trying to salvage the
crazy season that we've had,"
Walsh said. "Our effort in this
game means an awful lot in the
final reflection of how our season
went. It really put a negative image
on last year, when we came unrav
eled [in Cal's 46-17 victory]. We are
certainly looking for a way to end
the season on a positive note."
For the first time in five years,

neither team has a chance at post
season play. However, many of the
best Big Games have come when
both teams have suffered through
sub-par seasons. Stanford's mirac
ulous win in 1990 capped just a 5-6
season, and Cal finished that year
at 7-4.
Indeed, the adage "the worse the
record, the better the game" seems
to fit this year's match-up perfectly.
"If that's the case, we can expect
an incredible game," Walsh said
jokingly.
Senior nose tackle Jason Fisk
agreed with Walsh's sentiments.
"I think it will elevate the inten
sity out there," Fisk said. "Neither
of us have anything else to play for
and it's our last game. I think peo
ple will be very up for it, on both
sides."
Stanford is coming off one of its
worst losses in the last few years, a
55-21 massacre at the hands of the
Ducks. As for the Golden Bears,
they are mired in a five-game losing
streak.
Both teams have also been bit
ten by the Pac-10 quarterback
injury bug. Cal's Dave Barr was
knocked out for the season with a
broken shoulder and Stenstrom's
broken little finger forced the all
time Pac-10 leader in passing
yardage to the sidelines for his final
two games.
In their places, sophomores Pat
Barnes and Scott Frost leap into
the limelight. Barnes has started
the past two games, and put up
impressive numbers against Wash
ington last week in a 31-19 loss
when he went 33-for-44 for 389
yards and two touchdowns.
Frost had an equally impressive
showing in the second half against
the Huskies two weeks ago when he
guided Stanford to a 46-28 win.
week, he suffered from the
typical mistakes a young quarter
back will make in his first career
start in the loss to Oregon.

"Scott made a lot of mental
errors that can be corrected,"
Walsh said. "Not too many physi
cal, but a lot of mental. That's
almost the expected norm for a
young quarterback. Steve
[Stentsrom], you may recall, took a
lot of sacks in '92 when we had an
outstanding team because he was
deciding who to throw to and what
to do. Scott doesn't have that prob
lem because he's a spontaneous
runner, but his judgments are in
deciding quickly enough on who to
throw to. That just takes time and
experience.
"If someone were to look at
Steve in his final games for Stan

ford and then go back to his fresh
man or sophomore year, you
wouldn't even recognize the player,
there's such a development over
those years. And Scott will be the
same way."
Frost's amazing 28-yard touch
down run showed a glimpse of
Frost the athlete, but now Walsh
wants to see more of Frost the pass
er. While the coach noted that
Frost's downfield passing was good,
the intricate timing needed for so
many of Stanford's short routes
was lacking.
"He is like some players that you
work with when you are swearing
at them and then cheering for

them, saying 'I knew he could get it
done,'" Walsh said.
Offensively for Cal, Barnes has
several explosive weapons at his
disposal. Wide receiver Iheanyi
"Eyechart" Uwaezuoke has 49
catches for 640 yards and Na'il
Benjamin has 43 receptions for 566
yards. Reynard Rutherford leads
the Golden Bears rushing attack
with 617 yards on 145 carries.
However, the Cal offense has
struggled under the revolving door
at quarterback, averaging only
328.8 yards per game (ninth in the
Pac-10). This same inconsistency

Game.
Has applied to the defense.
Although it currently ranks
third in the Pac-10 in total
defense, giving up only 303.3
yards per game, it surrendered
61 points to USC earlier this
year.
Linebacker Jerrott Willard
spearheads Cal's defense. The
four-year player has collected
464 tackles in his career and will
end up third in career tackles at
Cal. Last year, Willard's nine
total tackles had a lot to do with
Stanford's minus-5 yards rush
ing for the game.
Last year's Big Game loss left
a sour taste in many of the play
ers' mouths, according to senior
tight end Tony Cline. Stung by
the lopsided Cal victory, Stan
ford was forced to surrender the
Axe after a six-year possession of
the trophy.
However, the combination of
the poor records, the energy of
Cal's Memorial Stadium and the
70,000 screaming fans comprise

all the ingredients for a memo
rable Big Game. Two of the
greatest endings in college foot
ball history have come from con
tests played at Cal — the Bears'
controversial 25-20 win on "The
Play," a 5-lateral kickoff return
for a touchdown to end the
game, and the Cardinal's come
back in 1990, when it scored
nine points in 12 seconds to win
27-25.
"That crowd picks you up and
gives you extra adrenaline," said
senior wide receiver Justin
Armour.
After last year's devastating
loss, Walsh has grown concerned
about the younger players'
knowledge and reverence for Big
Game. Showing video tapes all
week of Big Game highlights, the
coaching staff has tried to
impress the importance of this
game.
"I've had to remind our young
players about the significance of
this game, and all the excitement
and participation that surrounds
it," Walsh said. "Because if they
haven't seen it, they walk out in
the stadium and go into a state
of shock."
Gauging from the freshmen's

traditional end-of-the-season
skit after yesterday's practice, it
seems they have been infcctcd
with Big Game fever. Even the
embattled Walsh cracked a smile
as the players imitated their
coaches and teammates.
Walsh won't have to worry
about his veteran players losing
their bearings on Saturday. For
nine fifth-year seniors, this will
be their third trip to Berkeley.
And for some, the Big Game tra
dition extends to before their
arrival on the Farm.
"I have a brother who went
there and a step-father who went
there, so I learned the tradition
of Big Game when I was quite a
bit younger," Fisk said. "You
can't really explain it — it's just
Big Game."
Stenstrom aptly reinforced the
idea that truly anything can hap
pen in a Big Game. "This game's
not over until everybody clears
out of the stadium," he said.
