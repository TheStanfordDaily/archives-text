# Men's, women's cross country head to NCAAs
## 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
When the men's and women's cross country
teams both qualified for the national champi
onships last week, Vin Lananna experienced his
greatest achievement thus far as Stanford's
coach.
"Getting both teams to nationals was my
goal," Lananna said. "To establish a solid pro
gram, that was the first thing we had to do — get
both teams there in the same year."
Lananna adds that he believes both squads
still have one more great race left in them. He's
hoping they will run that race Monday in Fayet
teville, Ark., as both teams shoot for the NCAA
title. In all, 22 of the country's best teams will
comprise the field in both the men's and women's
divisions.
In regard to the sixth-ranked Cardinal
women, who advanced to the national champi
onships last year, they hope to fulfill their season
long goal of topping last year's 1 lth-place finish.
"Our goal since the beginning of the year has
been to make the top 10," said sophomore Monal
Chokshi. "I think we can do it."
The women must overcome challenges from
perennial powers such as
Arkansas, Michigan, Brigham
Young and Oregon. They have
defeated all of these teams except
Michigan thus far in the season.
Meanwhile, the llth-ranked
men's team, which will compete in
the NCAAs for the first time since
1985, is not only happy to have
qualified, but looks to sneak up on
some of the more highly ranked
teams.
"One of our main goals was to
get there," said sophomore Greg
Jimmerson, "but I think we can
make a very good showing."
The top teams the Cardinal will
race against include Arizona,
Arkansas, BYU, Georgetown and
Michigan. The men have encoun
tered difficulty with Arizona, but
have beaten the Wildcats once ear
lier in the year, and have also out
run the Wolverines and the
Cougars.
During the last week of practice,
the Cardinal has focused on
preparing for the grueling meet,
lent particular attention
to the men, as they will run 2,000
meters longer than their usual
8,000 meters.
Only once before, in the Dis
trict-8 Championships, did the
men race 10,000 meters. Assistant
coach Andy Gerard sees the longer
distance as a benefit to the team,
however.
"It's a big plus," Gerard said,
"because we [traditionally] gear
towards longer distances."
Both the men and the women
have been preparing psychological
ly as well.
"At this point in the season,
[practice] is mentally focusing,"
Gerard said. "We're really just fine
tuning the team."
Although the players and coach
es have expressed their satisfaction
with both teams qualifying, Gerard
said the Cardinal has set high goals
for the race Monday.
"Realistically, we'll be happy
with the men finishing in the top
10 or 12," he said. "For the women,
we'll be happy with a top-10 finish.

When asked if the women, who
have lost only one race all year, can
win the NCAA crown, Gerard
believes it's not out of the realm of

possibility.
"Beyond being good, you've got
to be lucky," he said. "We'll need
everyone to be running well."
