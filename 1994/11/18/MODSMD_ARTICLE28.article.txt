# Spikers Northwest bound
## No. 2 women to clash with Huskies, Cougars 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
While Cardinal dreams of a Rose Bowl bid
went the way of the dodo bird, the second
ranked Stanford women's volleyball team
has been steadily working its way towards a
Pacific 10 Conference championship.
And now, as the Stanford football team
hopes for consolation with a victory over Cal
ifornia, the Cardinal spikers are looking to
make their dream a reality this weekend.
Standing in their path is a difficult trek
north and two top-25 opponents. Stanford
(23-1, 15-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
faces No. 23 Washington (14-11, 8-8) Friday
evening and deals with No. 25 Washington
State (15-11,7-9) on Saturday night. A sweep
of the northern schools would clinch the con
ference title for the Cardinal.
Although the Washingtons proved easy
meat for the red and white when Stanford
opened up its conference schedule at Maples
Pavilion two months ago, Cardinal head
coach Don Shaw is still waiy.
"Both of these teams have really surprised
me," he said. "When we played them before,
they did not look good. I wouldn't have
expected them to be where they are now [in
the middle of the conference standings]."
"But that was then and this is now," he
added. "We must have seen them on really
poor nights, because they've definitely pulled

it together."
The Huskies and Cougars will be battling
for bids in the upcoming NCAA tournament.
Because five other Pac-10 teams have virtu
ally sealed up invitations to the dance, Wash
ington and WSU have to make an impression
upon those who will have the final say. A vic
tory over the Cardinal would be a very effec
tive way to do that.
"They're on the bubble as far as the tour
nament goes," Shaw said. "A win over us
might push them over the top."
This may not be such a tall order on their
home floors. In Seattle, Washington man
aged to defeat fourth-ranked UCLA, the Car
dinal's main competition for the Pac-10 title.
On the same evening, the Cougars took out
No. 13 USC in Pullman. Should the Cardinal
win both matches, it would be the first school
to pull off a sweep in Washington State all
year.
"At home, they've given some good teams
real tough times," Shaw said. "They put
relentless pressure on you and pull out all the
stops tactically."
In addition to fighting the skills of the
squads they will be facing, Stanford will also
have to face the rigors of travel.
After flying to Seattle on Thursday and
battling the Huskies Friday night, the Cardi
nal will have to take a eight-hour bus trip to
Pullman on Saturday to play
the Cougars. The weather is
supposed to be harsh, as is the
traffic. Washington State's
football team is hosting Wash
ington in the Apple Cup, their
version of the Big Game, and
the roads are expected to be
clogged.
"Logistically, it's a little
funky," Shaw said. "But we've
just got to go up there and do
it. It's the same thing every
year, but the freshmen haven't
ever had to do this before. It
might affect their play.
Because we've been starting
three freshmen this year, it
might be a bigger factor than in
years past."
One of those freshmen, set
ter-hitter Lisa Sharpley,
received honors as this week's
Pac-10 Player of the Week.
Against Arizona State last Fri
day, Sharpley had five kills, 10
digs, 15 assists and a match
high five blocks.
The following night against
Arizona, she added seven kills,
nine digs, 13 assists and four
blocks.
The freshman helped lead a
rejuvenated Cardinal defense.
"Our offensive attack wasn't
quite running on all cylinders,
but we did an excellent job with
our blocking defense," Shaw
said.
"When you hold two top
twenty teams to a hitting per
centage under .100 on two con
secutive nights, you know
you're doing something right."
