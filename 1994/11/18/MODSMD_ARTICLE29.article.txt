## Valiantly challenging Stanford's Big Man, Reagan takes on Casper in week's picks 
### 
I take to my smeared and foggy
crystal ball for the final time this
football season, and joining me on
this week's sojourn into the
unknown is Stanford University
President Gerhard Casper, who is
ready to flaunt his little-known
but highly-developed knowledge
of sports.
Perk your ears for the wisdom
of Casper, who finally gets a
chance to step aside from his
newly-appointed position as medi
ator of campus free-speech squab
bles and pick the college football
games of the week (fortunately, I
won't ask him to evaluate the
Washington Redskins or Cleve

You might be thinking to your
self, what makes Big Game so big
when both teams are entering the
contest coming off sickening sea
sons with nauseating records to
prove it?
Good question. I wish I had an
answer for you. All I know is that
in years when a win is as marginal
ly valuable as this one is for both
squads, Big Game turns into a bat
tle of honor and nobility â€” that is,
one team will have honor and the
other no ability.
President Casper would like to
think the Big Game trophy was
