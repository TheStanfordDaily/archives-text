## Valiantly challenging Stanford's Big Man, Reagan takes on Casper in week's picks 
### 
I take to my smeared and foggy
crystal ball for the final time this
football season, and joining me on
this week's sojourn into the
unknown is Stanford University
President Gerhard Casper, who is
ready to flaunt his little-known
but highly-developed knowledge
of sports.
Perk your ears for the wisdom
of Casper, who finally gets a
chance to step aside from his
newly-appointed position as medi
ator of campus free-speech squab
bles and pick the college football
games of the week (fortunately, I
won't ask him to evaluate the
Washington Redskins or Cleve
land Indians):

Stanford at Cal
You might be thinking to your
self, what makes Big Game so big
when both teams are entering the
contest coming off sickening sea
sons with nauseating records to
prove it?
Good question. I wish I had an
answer for you. All I know is that
in years when a win is as marginal
ly valuable as this one is for both
squads, Big Game turns into a bat
tle of honor and nobility — that is,
one team will have honor and the
other no ability.
President Casper would like to
think the Big Game trophy was


Reagan
Demas


Gerhard
Casper
destined to remain on the Stan
ford campus:
"As any of our semioticians
could attest, deconstruction of the
trophy's name — the Stanford
Axe — leads to an inescapable
conclusion about its proper place
of residence."
One could also conjecture that
the use of an axe in memorializing
Big Game can mean nothing but
bad news for a school that has a
redwood for its mascot. Neverthe
less, Casper predicts a Cardinal
victory — by less than he'd like to.
"As to the margin of victory,
modesty and compassion for the
less-fortunate (i.e. Berkeley stu
dents) prevent (me] from listing
its full proportions," he said.
I concur in the verdict but dis
sent on the spread. A floundering
passing game and inexperienced
Cardinal running squad, coupled
with an already established lack
of defense by the Bears, is bound
to make this Big Game a Big
Snoozer. In fact, I'd encourage
anyone going to the game to bring
along a Big Pillow and a Big Book
to read.

Oregon at Oregon State
It's dubbed "The Civil War" in
football-hungry Oregon, but this
year's contest in Corvallis should
make Bosnia look like two three
year-olds bickering over Legos.
I never thought I'd be saying
this, but much is at stake in this
pitiful match-up, including every
ounce of dignity I've ever pos
sessed. If the Ducks win, as I pre
dicted over a month ago, they'll
make their first trip to the Rose
Bowl since televisions first began
getting popular in rich white
folks' homes. If the Beavers win,
both I and the entire Oregon
squad will retreat into a humiliat
ed self-exile, never to be seen in
public again.
The President is dubious of the
'Civil War' title. "|lt| suggests
that the history departments at

the two universities have a hold
on the imagination of their cam
puses. Lest anyone take the anal
ogy too far — yielding such garish
subtitles as 'The Battle of the
Orange and the Green' — {I'll just
conclude] that the more southerly
combatant will win this war."
I'll give Oregon State's history
department more credit than
that, but I certainly won't give
their football team the benefit of
the doubt. Last week's victory
over Washington State was a
freakish anomaly, as most Beaver
victories in the past five years
have been. There'll be no home
town heroics for OSU, who will be
green with envy watching their
feathered friends (fiends?) playing
football on New Year's Day.

USC at UCLA
President Casper's platonic
approach to prognosticating:
"The second definition of' Tr
ojan' in the Oxford English dictio
nary includes 'a person of disso
lute life.' Be that as it may, on Big
Game day, it is impossible to pre
dict victory for any team with
'University of California' or a
variation of' Bears' in its name."
Casper (who tried out for but
was cut early from the Stanford
football cheerleading squad) pre
sents biased means towards a
legitimate end. The Trojans will
take this game in Pasadena
behind Rob Johnson's second
highest in the nation passing-effi
ciency rating and an offensive
arsenal bigger than (but not near
as hard to detect as) North
Korea's. They'll leave the field
praying that they'll be back in the
Rose Bowl come January. They
won't know it then, but they're
hopes are all for naught.

Washington at Washington
State
The President views Stan
ford's defeat of the Huskies two
weeks ago as a factor in determin
ing the better of these Pacific
N irthv est squads.
"[The Cardinal] upset Wash
ington, clearly indicating that the

Huskies are an outstanding
team," he said.
I'll turn his argument around
to draw a different conclusion.
Stanford upset UW, clearly indi
cating that the Huskies are not
worthy of the bowl game and tele
vision appearances they weren't
allowed to have this season any
way.
Watch the Cougars' defense
eat the silky-haired, lovable
Husky dogs alive.

Auburn at Alabama
Forget the strengths and weak
nesses of these two football teams
— President Casper would like to
predict the outcome of the game
based on a separate, less common
set of criteria:
"With the state geological sur
vey and a U.S. Bureau of Mines
experiment station, the Universi
ty of Alabama obviously is strong
on (and in) the ground. However,
Auburn's technical and engineer
ing schools give it the advantage
in damming up the Crimson
Tide."
If I thought most of the Tiger
football players were in the school
of engineering, I might agree.
Enough said on that subject. But
Auburn, who is suffering through
its second year of probation with
out a single loss, is probably run
ning short of payoff cash and
prizes to keep its coaches and
players happy. Besides, that snob
by little Bowden kid needs more
than last week's tie against Geor
gia to hammer him down to size.
Casper: Auburn by 10
Reagan: Alabama by 7
And a few predictions for the
road:
The Nittany Lions munch on
Duck flambee in Pasadena... The
Cornhuskers fall victim to a Gator
attack in the Florida bayou . . .
The Irish go bowl-less without
Trojan protection . . . Other than
that, I have absolutely no idea.
And I never did.
Final stats:
Them: 28 for 39 (72%)
Me: 23 for 40 (58%)

both I and the entire Oregon

public again.
The President is dubious of the
'Civil War' title. "|lt| suggests

combatant will win this war."
I'll give Oregon State's history
department more credit than
that, but I certainly won't give
their football team the benefit of
the doubt. Last week's victory
over Washington State was a
freakish anomaly, as most Beaver
victories in the past five years
have been. There'll be no home
town heroics for OSU, who will be
green with envy watching their
feathered friends (fiends?) playing
football on New Year's Day.

President Casper's platonic
approach to prognosticating:
"The second definition of' Tr
ojan' in the Oxford English dictio
nary includes 'a person of disso
lute life.' Be that as it may, on Big
Game day, it is impossible to pre
dict victory for any team with
'University of California' or a
variation of' Bears' in its name."
Casper (who tried out for but
was cut early from the Stanford
football cheerleading squad) pre
sents biased means towards a
legitimate end. The Trojans will
take this game in Pasadena
behind Rob Johnson's second
highest in the nation passing-effi
ciency rating and an offensive
arsenal bigger than (but not near
as hard to detect as) North
Korea's. They'll leave the field
praying that they'll be back in the
Rose Bowl come January. They
won't know it then, but they're
hopes are all for naught.

The President views Stan
ford's defeat of the Huskies two
weeks ago as a factor in determin
ing the better of these Pacific
N irthv est squads.
"[The Cardinal] upset Wash
ington, clearly indicating that the

Huskies are an outstanding
team," he said.
I'll turn his argument around
to draw a different conclusion.
Stanford upset UW, clearly indi
cating that the Huskies are not
worthy of the bowl game and tele
vision appearances they weren't
allowed to have this season any
way.
Watch the Cougars' defense
eat the silky-haired, lovable
Husky dogs alive.

Auburn at Alabama
Forget the strengths and weak
nesses of these two football teams
— President Casper would like to
predict the outcome of the game
based on a separate, less common
set of criteria:
"With the state geological sur
vey and a U.S. Bureau of Mines
experiment station, the Universi
ty of Alabama obviously is strong
on (and in) the ground. However,
Auburn's technical and engineer
ing schools give it the advantage
in damming up the Crimson
Tide."
If I thought most of the Tiger
football players were in the school
of engineering, I might agree.
Enough said on that subject. But
Auburn, who is suffering through
its second year of probation with
out a single loss, is probably run
ning short of payoff cash and
prizes to keep its coaches and
players happy. Besides, that snob
by little Bowden kid needs more
than last week's tie against Geor
gia to hammer him down to size.

And a few predictions for the
road:
The Nittany Lions munch on
Duck flambee in Pasadena... The
Cornhuskers fall victim to a Gator
attack in the Florida bayou . . .
The Irish go bowl-less without
Trojan protection . . . Other than
that, I have absolutely no idea.
And I never did.
Final stats:
Them: 28 for 39 (72%)
Me: 23 for 40 (58%)
I take to my smeared and foggy
crystal ball for the final time this
football season, and joining me on
this week's sojourn into the
unknown is Stanford University
President Gerhard Casper, who is
ready to flaunt his little-known
but highly-developed knowledge
of sports.
Perk your ears for the wisdom
of Casper, who finally gets a
chance to step aside from his
newly-appointed position as medi
ator of campus free-speech squab
bles and pick the college football
games of the week (fortunately, I
won't ask him to evaluate the
Washington Redskins or Cleve
land Indians):

You might be thinking to your
self, what makes Big Game so big
when both teams are entering the
contest coming off sickening sea
sons with nauseating records to
prove it?
Good question. I wish I had an
answer for you. All I know is that
in years when a win is as marginal
ly valuable as this one is for both
squads, Big Game turns into a bat
tle of honor and nobility — that is,
one team will have honor and the
other no ability.
President Casper would like to
think the Big Game trophy was


Reagan
Demas


Gerhard
Casper
destined to remain on the Stan
ford campus:
"As any of our semioticians
could attest, deconstruction of the
trophy's name — the Stanford
Axe — leads to an inescapable
conclusion about its proper place
of residence."
One could also conjecture that
the use of an axe in memorializing
Big Game can mean nothing but
bad news for a school that has a
redwood for its mascot. Neverthe
less, Casper predicts a Cardinal
victory — by less than he'd like to.
"As to the margin of victory,
modesty and compassion for the
less-fortunate (i.e. Berkeley stu
dents) prevent (me] from listing
its full proportions," he said.
I concur in the verdict but dis
sent on the spread. A floundering
passing game and inexperienced
Cardinal running squad, coupled
with an already established lack
of defense by the Bears, is bound
to make this Big Game a Big
Snoozer. In fact, I'd encourage
anyone going to the game to bring
along a Big Pillow and a Big Book
to read.

Oregon at Oregon State
It's dubbed "The Civil War" in
football-hungry Oregon, but this
year's contest in Corvallis should
make Bosnia look like two three
year-olds bickering over Legos.
I never thought I'd be saying
this, but much is at stake in this
pitiful match-up, including every
ounce of dignity I've ever pos
sessed. If the Ducks win, as I pre
dicted over a month ago, they'll
make their first trip to the Rose
