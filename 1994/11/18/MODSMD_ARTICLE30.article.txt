Football? Big Game?
Not this year. This Saturday in Berkeley, the tele
vision cameras will be at Berkeley's Speiker Pool as
ESPN2 will televise the 10:30 a.m. Big Splash water
polo match to a nation-wide audience on tape-delay at
8:30 p.m.
The contest itself holds little relevance in the hunt
for the national championship, as No. 1 Stanford (23-
1) and No. 3 California (19-8) will most likely carry
those rankings into the NCAA tournament.
But, as in any meeting between the two schools, a
great deal of pride will be on the line.
"This game has no significance as far as seeding for
NCAAs is concerned," said Stanford coach Dante Det
tamanti. "It's for bragging rights in the Bay Area. It's
part of the great rivalry between Stanford and Cal."
The rivalry in water polo is so intense that ESPN2
will feature the match on its program, "Greatest
Rivalries in Sports."
The Cardinal and Golden Bears have dominated
collegiate water polo over the past 25 years, winning
18 NCAA titles over that span. California has won 11
to Stanford's seven. The teams have captured 18 of
the last 20 and 10 of the past 11 NCAA tournaments.
Stanford and Cal have met in the NCAA finals six
times, splitting three wins apiece.

When the teams meet Saturday, the Cardinal will
be seeking its first Big Splash victory since 1986, when
Stanford won the NCAA title with a perfect 36-0
record.
This year, the Cardinal has been nearly as domi
nating as the 1986 squad. The one stain on an other
wise perfect season is a 12-11 overtime loss to Cal in
Berkeley in October.
Since then, Stanford has won 17 consecutive
matches, including three last weekend at the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation tournament. The Car
dinal defeated No. 2 USC 17-7 in the tournament
finals to gain an automatic berth in the NCAA tour
ney.
"I told the guys that in the last three weeks of the
season, we have our three most important games —
the conference tournament, Big Splash and the
NCAAs," Dettamanti said. "Our goal is to win all
three."
This match will be the rubber-game between the
two squads, as Stanford evened the season-series with
the Golden Bears with a 10-8 victory at deGuerre Pool
two weeks ago.
"We want to have a winning record against every
team," Dettamanti said. "We want to put that to rest.
There's also a good chance we'll play Cal at NCAAs."

ploying a collapsing defense.
"We're not really scared of any
one," said goaltender Jack Bowen.
"They have some of the best hole
men in the country, but our drop
worked well against USC lin the
MPSF final]. I feel pretty confident."
If the match bears any resem
blance to the last time the two
teams clashed, six-on-five penalty
situations will prove important for
both teams.
"The key for us is to avoid man
down situations," Dettamanti said.

"Last time we played, we gave them
13 six-on-fives. That was how they
scored all of their goals. We can't put
ourselves in the position to get penal
ties — penalties give a lesser team a
chance to beat a better team."
For seniors Wolf Wigo and Frank
Schneider, not winning the Big
Splash is about the only accomplish
ment the two standouts have not
achieved in their four-year careers.
Hence, Wigo and his teammates will
be all business in the water.
"We need to phase out all the
hype and execute," Wigo said.
Junior Jeremy Laster added,
"We need to overcome Cal's crowd
and the fact that it's the Big Splash.
We know we're the better team."
