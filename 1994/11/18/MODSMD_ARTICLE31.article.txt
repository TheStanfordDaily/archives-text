# Looking to help and hinder
## Fencers to take a stab at Cal 
### Sam Wu Editorial staff 
Hostile advertisement takes
on new meaning when one con
siders the goals that the Stanford
men's and women's fencing
teams have set for themselves in
their matches against California
tonight at Roble Gym.
Indeed, for one, the Cardinal
hopes to help elevate Cal's fenc
ing team from club to varsity sta
tus by promoting the Golden
Bears through this evening's 6
p.m. competition.
On the other hand, Stanford,
as always, looks to put some
cyanide in the Golden Bears'
honey.
"There's no question whether
we will win," said women's head
coach Sherry Posthumus. "We
want to stamp our dominance
upon them as well as aid their
cause."
Men's head coach Zoran
Tulum guaranteed that the Car
dinal will at least fulfill the for
mer objective. "As far as Berke
ley is concerned, we do not antic
ipate having any difficulties beat
ing them," he said.
The talent comprising both
Stanford squads lends such con
fidence to their respective coach
es.
Tulum's contingent features

such standouts as senior Sean
McClain, a member of the Men's
National Foil Team who also
competes in epee.
"There is no doubt that Sean
is the No. 1 contender [for the
national title] in either weapon,
epee or foil," Tulum said.
Overall, Tulum expects six of
his fencers, two per weapon
(saber, foil and epee) to qualify
for the NCAA Championships.
The coach presents an extremely
positive outlook for the Cardinal,
considering the fact that a maxi
mum of six athletes from any sin
gle squad can receive a NCAA
berth.
As for an apparent weakness
in foil, as manifested in the men's
second-place finish in the West
ern Regional Champions last
year, Tulum believes that he has
the remedy in senior Ceoff Don
aker and freshman Sasha Zuck
er. The coach attributed last sea
son's foil performance in part to
the absence of Donaker, who was
in Germany for overseas study.
"I foresee Geoff and Sasha
each qualifying for NCAAs in
foil," Tulum said.
"I can almost guarantee a
Western Regional title," the
coach added in reference to the
team as a whole. "And because of
our promising recruiting class,
we are looking towards an NCAA

title within the next few years."
While the Stanford women
may not pack the firepower the
men carry, Posthumus remains
optimistic about her team's
chances at defending its Western
Regional crown.
The main dilemma facing the
women this year is the fact that
the Cardinal has incorporated
epee to its campaign due to
changes in NCAA rules.
"Half the team has switched
from foil to epee," Posthumus
said. "This means we have to
rebuild the foil team. The
strength went to epee, and our
remaining strength isn't here at
Stanford." Three of the Cardi
nal's foil fencers are spread out
in Washington D.C. and New
Zealand, while a fourth has
stopped out temporarily.
Nonetheless, Stanford still
boasts two Pacific 10 Conference
champions in junior Morgan
Hoch and senior Stephanie Wien.
In addition, the Cardinal will
gain the services of Lara Smith.
The junior won the women's
qualifiers for the Junior Olympic
Championships and will repre
sent Stanford this January at the
Junior Olympic Fencing Cham
pionships.
"Overall, we expect to do
well," Posthumus said, "just as
we have done in the past."
