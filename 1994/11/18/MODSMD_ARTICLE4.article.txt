# Granfield discusses corporate law trend

Why do many conscientious liberals turn
into corporate lawyers after three years at an
elite law school?
That was the subject of a lecture yesterday
at the Law School by Robert Granfield, profes
sor of sociology at the University of Denver.
Speaking before an audience of 40 people,
Granfield faulted the arbitrary curriculum of
elite law schools with transforming the identi
ty of students from one of social activism to a
detached and isolated view of the law.

While political sentiment within the student
population at the top-rated law schools (Chica
go, Columbia, Harvard, Stanford, and Yale) is
overwhelmingly liberal, a large percentage
turn to corporate practice after graduation.
According to figures given by the Princeton
Review, 20 percent to 40 percent of a typical
graduating class go into corporate law, while
less than 20 percent opt to enter public interest
practice.
"Law school curriculum is rarely subjected
to critical review," said Granfield. Students
"get a market-based and elitist view of law

practice, rather than a participatory attitude"
in the law, he said.
The curriculum reduces law to cold, dis
jointed scientific action that does not take the
effects cf the community into consideration,
said Granfield.
Law students succumb to extreme pragma
tism, he said. They become, "hyperrational. . .
like high-altitude bombers, they're pilots who
don't see what they hit."
Granfield also questioned law school ethics
