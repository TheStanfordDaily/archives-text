# Granfield discusses corporate law trend

### Martin L. Yeung 
Why do many conscientious liberals turn
into corporate lawyers after three years at an
elite law school?
That was the subject of a lecture yesterday
at the Law School by Robert Granfield, profes
sor of sociology at the University of Denver.
Speaking before an audience of 40 people,
Granfield faulted the arbitrary curriculum of
elite law schools with transforming the identi
ty of students from one of social activism to a
detached and isolated view of the law.

While political sentiment within the student
population at the top-rated law schools (Chica
go, Columbia, Harvard, Stanford, and Yale) is
overwhelmingly liberal, a large percentage
turn to corporate practice after graduation.
According to figures given by the Princeton
Review, 20 percent to 40 percent of a typical
graduating class go into corporate law, while
less than 20 percent opt to enter public interest
practice.
"Law school curriculum is rarely subjected
to critical review," said Granfield. Students
"get a market-based and elitist view of law

practice, rather than a participatory attitude"
in the law, he said.
The curriculum reduces law to cold, dis
jointed scientific action that does not take the
effects cf the community into consideration,
said Granfield.
Law students succumb to extreme pragma
tism, he said. They become, "hyperrational. . .
like high-altitude bombers, they're pilots who
don't see what they hit."
Granfield also questioned law school ethics
courses which are supposed to
remedy legal amorality, saying
that they are so removed from
reality that they "have little bear
ing with the social contradictions
in everyday life."
"They fail to stimulate how the
law interacts in human relation
ships because they are nebulous
and vague," he said.
As a result, Granfield said that
"liberal" corporate lawyers ratio
nalize company actions with
which they may personally dis
agree. Rather than seeing the eco
nomic devastation a plant closure

inflicts on a community, they rea
son, "it's perfectly legal" or "if I
didn't do it, someone else would
have," he said.
Granfield noted that some cor
porate lawyers have even said
they do what could be considered
ethically questionable acts out of
loyalty or because they felt the
company was the real victim in
the case.
Other reasons given for choos
ing corporate rather than public
interest law were loan debts —
which typically can run up to
$100,000 — and job security. But
Granfield maintained that the
very nature of the law curriculum
pushes students into corporate
law and to label these liberals as
"sellouts" was a harsh oversimpli

fication.
In addition to arbitrary cur
riculums, Granfield faults exter
nal factors for turning liberal law
students into corporate lawyers.
The shortage of public interest
jobs due to a lack of funding, cou
pled with growing national cyni
cism and overwhelming work
loads, dissuades some from taking
up public interest law, he said.
In addition, the decline of the
activist state has eliminated many
opportunities for doing public
interest work through govern
ment, he said.
As the nation moves toward a
more conservative stance, action
by the state to help the disadvan
taged will inevitably continue its
downward spiral, Granfield said.
