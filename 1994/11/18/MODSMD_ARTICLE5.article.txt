# Bonfire's return looks to spark Big Game win
## 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
The Big Game Bonfire re
turned to Stanford yesterday, this
time in a much smaller fashion.
Flames rose 35 feet into the air,
sometimes dousing a spirited
crowd of 900 with sparks. Stu
dents, some toting marshmal
lows, yelled and cheered as Cal
bears were hacked with axes and
set ablaze at the annual pre-Big
Game rally.
"It was as big of a fire as it could
be without damaging the shrubs,"
said Craig Zajac, chair of the Axe
Committee. He added that the
event was closely monitored by
the University, alumnus John Ar
rillaga, policemen and firemen.
Axe Committee members said
last night's event went virtually
without glitches.

"The only drawback was the
wind," Zajac said. Original plans
called for two slide screens on ei
ther side of the fire, held behind
Arrillaga Sports Center. Howev
er, strong winds forced the com
mittee to project slides directly
onto the gym facade, Zajac said.
Last year's bonfire was can
celed because of concern over the
dwindling population of tiger sala
manders in Lake Lagunita. The
bonfire was replaced with a laser
light show.
While the base of the bonfire
two years ago was several stories
high, the base of yesterday's mini
bonfire was under 10 feet.
The program was narrated by
longtime bonfire and band an
nouncer Hal Mickelson. Mickel
son told the crowd of the long his-

Tory of the Axe.
"The Axe has been taken and
retaken, pilfered and repilfered,"
Mickelson said. "It is one of the
most stolen items in Western his
tory."
As Mickelson spoke, members

of the Axe Committee acted out
the scene, smashing more than 10
bears in less than 10 minutes.
Following the chanting of the
Axe yell, seniors from the Stan
ford football team, Ld by head
coach Bill Walsh, marcheJ with
torches and threw them onto the
effigy of a Cal bear. A fireworks
show followed as the bear was
reduced to ashes in 20 minutes.
The Axe Committee, which

was denied its ASSU special fee
last year, has spent virtually ali
of its reserve funds to stage the
bonfire, Zajac said. "There is
essentially no money left," he
said.
Funds for this year's bonfire
came chiefly from the Athletic
Department. The Axe Committee
also raised some of its own funds
and received money from the
ASSU Program Board, he said.
