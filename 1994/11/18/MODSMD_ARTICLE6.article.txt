# Stanford to clarify solicitation policy
## University unclear on enforcement measures 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
Widespread concern expressed by stu
dent leadership as well as several student
groups has prompted the University to re
examine its policy centralizing alumni solic
itation and preventing student groups from
canvassing alumni for money.
The change — an effort by the Universi
ty's fund-raising division to L uild up an an
nual "Stanford Fund" of unrestricted gifts
that could be spent at University adminis
trators' discretion — has been criticized as
ill-defined and unfair to groups with their
own claims on alumni loyalty and support.
And with University administrators con
fessing they don't quite grasp the scope of
student concern, the question of how to
deal with organized opposition has shroud
ed the policy in confusion.
The policy, which became effective Sept.
1, mandates that student groups only solic
it funding from alumni who contributed to
their group within the five years preceding

that date. As these lists will remain static
while numbers of alumni grow, student
groups will have access to fewer donors
each year.
Responding to some of the concerns,
Provost Condoleezza Rice yesterday asked

staff members from the of
fices of student affairs and
development to clarify the
policy and look at ways to
"smooth the transition" to
other fund-raising meth
ods for student groups.
As part of this process,
Vice President for Devel
opment John Ford and
Vice Provost and Dean for

Student Affairs Mary Edmonds will hold a
meeting Nov. 30 with student leaders op
posed to the changes.
That meeting, though, is not intended to
gather input about changes to the policy,
but to clarify it, Ford said. "We know we


Rice
have the right policy," he said, "and
knowing Stanford students, I can
imagine that if they're not satisfied
student leaders will carry this to a
higher level. But I hope we can
reach an understanding at that
time."
•Dipping into the pie'
Robbing student groups of need
ed funds certainly was not the
intention of the new policy, Ford
said. Rather, the Development
Office is hoping to cut down on the
"barrage" of mailings alumni
receive each year.
"Based on our own experiences,
we think we can say that the fund
will bring in more gilt dollars from
alumni more efficiently with fewer
letters,"he said.
Such concerns with a low base of
alumni donors have plagued the
Development Office for years.
Ford said he Is "very worried
that, the barrage of solicitation is
very much a part of the reason that
our giving rate comes in so much
lower than Harvard, Yale and
Princeton which have till had simi
lar policies for years."
Stanford's alumni giving rate of
26 percent currently stands at
approximately half that of compa
rable schools.
Development Officer Nancy
Wells, who heads the Stanford
Fund effort, said she would sepa
rate the office's concerns from the
funding questions facing student
groups. "We have a larger goal in
mind," she said, namely increasing
the percentage of alumni who give
annually to the University.

Such arguments rest on a "prob
lematic assumption" that fund
raising by student groups can be
sacrificed to the University's inter
ests in general, ASSU Council of
Presidents member Mork Murdock
said.
Since student solicitation takes
place on a "much more minor level"
and for vastly different reasons
than University fund raising, he
asked, "Are they really making any
progress toward these goals?"
Ford said that since student
groups are increasingly "dipping
into the (alumni) pie" — largely due
to the loss of many ASSU special
fees in last spring's general election
— they are siphoning funding that
is "crucial" to other areas of under
graduate life.
"Is it more important for stu
dent groups to get those dollars
than financial aid or the library?"
Ford asked.
He added that it doesn't seem
fair to ask alumni to support stu
dent groups when the students
who benefit most from these
groups don't seem willing to fund
them.
But some students are skeptical
of the policy's real motivations.
ASSU Senator Steve Russell,
who has led student opposition to
the policy, said that both sides agree
the actual dollar amounts in ques
tion are not large.
"If it's not about money, it's
about control," he said. "They have
created a lie, and the lie is the Stan
ford Fund — that somehow they
arc just clearing up a bureaucratic
mess with this policy."
Jon Oram, treasurer of Stan
ford-in-Government, agreed. "This
has absolutely nothing to do with
increasing the percentage of alumni
that five to Stanford."

Looses for student groups?
Rice said the administration
"never intended that student
groups would in some way lose
money."
But the new policy would make
it much more difficult for some stu
dent groups to tap a source of funds
on which they have relied.
Until this year, SIG sent letters
to more than 1,000 alumni who
were previously involved in the pro
gram, asking for money to offset
the expenses of several dozen stu
dent interns in Sacramento and
Washington, D.C.
When the group asked the Devel
opment OfTloe for this year's alum
ni contact list, SIG received only
352 names — those who had donat
ed money for fellowships within the
last five years.
The numbers decreased because
the new policy limits student
appeals to "current donors."
A corresponding decline in dona
tions and the scope of the program
can be expected, SIG Chair Susie
Thomas said. "The number of fel
lowships we offer is directly linked
to the amount of money we raise
from alumni," she said.
Fund-raising officials said the
names taken off lists are not a like
ly source of funds anyway, since
they have been asked to give in the
past and have not responded.
Student groups "aren't losing
any dollars," Ford said. The off-lim
its alumni "are not (currently) giv
ing to them ... so they shouldn't
lose anything."
Ford emphasized the goal of the
program was to prevent groups
from considering an "en masse
solicitation" strategy and not
those efforts that target specific
groups of alumni. "We're not try

ing to squelch a pattern of support
that's already been established,"
he said.
Complicating the issue is the
variety of mechanisms used by stu
dent groups use to obtain alumni
support.
Fraternities and several other
established student organizations
have alumni associations which
raise funds for their related organi
zations. Some groups solicit alumni
for one-time efforts, such as album
recordings by a capella groups or
overseas trips for the Stanford
Symphony, according to Nanci
Howe, Director of the Office of Stu
dent Activities.
In addition, there are groups
such as SIG or The Stanford
Review, which actively solicit alum
ni giving as an integral support for
their activities.
"Some groups have the potential
to be dramatically affected," Howe
said. "On the whole, most groups
will not."
Ford said the number of groups
that actually ask for lists from the
Development Office is small,
"maybe four or five" out of some
500 student groups. Those are the
only groups which the policy was
designed to affect, he said.
Howe, though, estimated that
some 50 groups engaged in alumni
solicitation, raising between
$50,000 and $100,000.
A 'matter of trust'?
How the University plans to
implement and enforce the policy,
however, remains "the $64,000
question," Ford said.
"Basically, as far as enforcement
goes, we don't have any way to
ensure that groups won't go outside
the policy at this time," Ford said.
"I don't have enough staff to be

running around policing people.
"It's a matter of trust, similar to
the Honor Code, that we hope stu
dents will follow for the good of
undergraduate education," he
added.
The burden of determining a
method of enforcement is now in
the provost's hands, Ford said,
adding that he and his staff will not
ignore violations of the policy.
"Indeed, if we fmd egregious
ignoring of these policies we will
make every effort to bring this to
the attention of whoever Provost
Rice sees as the proper authority
and ensure that whatever enforce
ment that person sees fit is earned
out," he said.
But finding such violators is
complicated by the fact that the
office will have to rely on student
groups to tell them who has con
tributed, as University donor
records are incomplete.
"The records are not clear
enough to tell who has and has not
given," Ford said.
Without the teeth of clear
enforcement, the policy as it stands
leaves room for students to easily
work outside the Development
Office, Russell said.
Functionally, the policy means
that if groups maintained lists of
alumni that are not generated by
the Development Office and contin
ue to use those lists, that does not
fall under the policy, Wells admit
ted.
Russell speculated that student
groups could easily alter their alum
ni solicitation strategy in order to
frustrate the program and main
tain "one of the last vestiges of inde
pendence" for student groups.
As enthusiasm wanes, however,
Russell said the policy could have a
long-term effect.

"It's typical University strategy
— create a law, not enforce it, let
institutional memory work its
magic," he said. "Then they begin
to enforce the policy" after students
have forgotten their former inde
pendence.
However, if groups circumvent
the Development Office with their
own alumni donor lists, it may have
the effect of pushing student groups
even further from the office's reach.
Rice, acknowledging that possi
bility, said "this was certainly not
the intention" of the fund.
Administrators also seem con
fused about what form the fund's
disbursement process will take. The
funding will be administered by the
president and the provost, but how
these decisions will be made is still
unclear.
Rice raised the possibility of an
application process for student
groups, while Howe seemed to
believe the fund would offer a series
of one-time grants, similar to the
President's Fund.
Ford, who said he takes "full
responsibility" for the policy in
terms of its overall effect on the
level of giving, said the policy would
indeed "let the powers that be divvy
up the funds."
He added that students will, to
some extent, have to trust that the
administration is making wise
funding choices.
"I understand that there needs
to be a level of trust that the people
who are making allocations are
doing so for the good of undergrad
uates," he said.
In addition, having the president
and the provost allocate money
from the funds "will make student
groups and academic deans make
their case for what they think is
important," Ford said.
