# Family leave in works for graduate students

The Personal Leave for Graduate Stu
dents Committee is in the final stages of
creating Stanford's first maternity and pa
ternity leave policy for graduate students.
As well as developing a maternity and pa-

ternity leave policy, the
committee is also trying to
formalize the existing
graduate Leaves of Ab
sence Policy which
presently is not "clearly
spelled out" anywhere,
said Assoc. Dean of Gradu
ate Policy George Dekker.
The committee was
formed last May "because

we discovered that Stanford had no official
policy with regard to maternity leave or pa
ternity leave for graduates," Dekker said.
The committee hopes to have a final
draft of the proposal complet ed by the be
ginning of next year.
The current leave policy explains in gen
eral terms what students have to do to go on

leave, but omits other important informa
tion, said Dekker.
"A lot of the practices are unofficial," he
said. "They are humane, liberal and kind
but aren't specified in print."
For example, if a student must leave for
a quarter, the student's supervisor would
not typically reduce the total length of the
research by the quarter spent away. This
decision is usually left to individual depart
ments.
The lack of information also leads stu
dents to speculate about the leave policy,
Dekker added. The committee learned that
some students incorrectly he.ard through
the "grapevine" that they would lose cam
pus accommodation if they took maternity
leave.
The committee is also trying to intro
duce a few modifications that will make the
present policy more flexible — especially for
maternity and paternity leave — by allow
ing students to work half-time instead of
taking leave, he said.
Whatever policy statement emerges,
