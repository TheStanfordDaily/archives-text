# Family leave in works for graduate students

The Personal Leave for Graduate Stu
dents Committee is in the final stages of
creating Stanford's first maternity and pa
ternity leave policy for graduate students.
As well as developing a maternity and pa-

ternity leave policy, the
committee is also trying to
formalize the existing
graduate Leaves of Ab
sence Policy which
presently is not "clearly
spelled out" anywhere,
said Assoc. Dean of Gradu
ate Policy George Dekker.
The committee was
formed last May "because

we discovered that Stanford had no official
policy with regard to maternity leave or pa
ternity leave for graduates," Dekker said.
The committee hopes to have a final
draft of the proposal complet ed by the be
ginning of next year.
The current leave policy explains in gen
eral terms what students have to do to go on

leave, but omits other important informa
tion, said Dekker.
"A lot of the practices are unofficial," he
said. "They are humane, liberal and kind
but aren't specified in print."
For example, if a student must leave for
a quarter, the student's supervisor would
not typically reduce the total length of the
research by the quarter spent away. This
decision is usually left to individual depart
ments.
The lack of information also leads stu
dents to speculate about the leave policy,
Dekker added. The committee learned that
some students incorrectly he.ard through
the "grapevine" that they would lose cam
pus accommodation if they took maternity
leave.
The committee is also trying to intro
duce a few modifications that will make the
present policy more flexible — especially for
maternity and paternity leave — by allow
ing students to work half-time instead of
taking leave, he said.
Whatever policy statement emerges,


Dekker
Dekker said he wants it to wan
students about how taking leav<
will affect funding. He noted thai
funding policies vary from spoil
sor to sponsor. For example, the
Mellon Foundation "frowns" at
any kind of leave of absence.
"The biggest single problenr
that comes up with leave is it. car
have a disastrous effect on long
range funding," Dekker said.
The committee has been gath

ering factual data regarding the
leave policy through different
student services including Cowell
Student Health Center and
Housing and Dining Services. It
also received feedback from facul
ty on a rough draft of the policy.
Although the majority of
response has been positive, there
has been some concern about how
the new maternity and paternity
leave policy will impact the time
it takes to complete a doctorate
degree program, Dekker said.
"This is a concern I have too
. . . . But if administered properly
it shouldn't have that effect," he

said.
Graduate student Chris
Shockman said she is pleased
about the work the committee is
doing but would have liked the
clarification of the policy to have
come earlier.
She was diagnosed clinically
with Lyme Disease last year after
being bitten by a tick and was
admitted to the hospital after the
illness became life-threatening.
When her adviser contacted her
in the hospital, Shockman said,
she wanted to ask to go on leave
but was unaware of the policy.
"You shouldn't be in a situa

tion where you are negotiating
with sick people. You should just
be able to say 'I'm sick' without
further explanation," she said,
adding that both students and
professors should know the rules.
Although the leave policy is
being clarified, students will still
have to fill out a form to be
assessed by the department chair
and their adviser before being
granted leave.
The committee includes
Dekker, three graduate students,
Director of Graduate Residences
Chris Griffith and five faculty
members.
