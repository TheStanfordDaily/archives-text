## Coach to decide after Thanksgiving 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
As if preparing for the Big
Game were not enough, Stan
ford head coach Bill Walsh has
found himself amid a tornado of
controversy regarding his fu
ture at Stanford University this
week.

During his regular Tuesday
press conference, Walsh an
swered a question about his fu
ture as head coach with an
open-ended response and fol
lowed that up with an equally
indecisive statement Wednes
day.

Coach Bill Walsh will be resigning after this season.
was finding my bliss," he said
Tuesday. "This is what I love to
do. I don't expect to leave Stan
ford, unless there is a grouping
of people who want to look for
alternatives, which is always
possible."
On Wednesday, he issued a
statement leaving the possibility
of working in a capacity other
than head football coach at
Stanford open for consideration:
"I am committed to Stanford

University and I expect to
remain here for several
years. ... I thoroughly enjoy the
experience of being the head
football coach at Stanford. My
number one interest is the
future of the Stanford football
program. I will continue to work
to improve the program and
make Stanford competitive at
the highest level."
Walsh also stated that he
would wait until after Thanks
giving to make a decision. He
currently has two years left on a
five-year contract.
According to Director of Ath
letics Ted Leland, he and Walsh

have had five or six conversa
tions about Walsh's future.
While Walsh may not want to
stay on as head coach, Leland
has discussed other options,
including a position as associate
athletic director.
"We're doing 100 percent of
what we can do to convince him
to stay," Leland said in a report
in yesterday's San Jose Mercury
News. Leland also noted that
when Walsh was signed three
years ago, he did not expect him
on "staying for 15 years. That
was never part of the agreement
with him."
Leland was unavailable for

comment yesterday.
After the victory over Wash
ington two weeks ago, Walsh,
Leland and provost Condoleezza
Rice discussed Walsh's future at
Stanford over dinner.
However, this type of hedging
on Walsh's part is not uncom
mon to the Pro Football Hall of
Famer. During his stint as head
coach of the San Francisco
49ers, he contemplated retire
ment after a 3-6 season in 1982
and a rough 6-5 start in 1988.
He also hinted at hanging it up
after last year's difficult 4-7 sea
son for the Cardinal.
Walsh, who will turn 63 on

Nov. 30, has faced several trying
situations this year. At 3-6-1,
the team is suffering through
its second straight losing sea
son, with many of the defeats
coming on last second plays.
Walsh has also had to fend off
weekly questions about his com
ments aimed at opposing teams
in the book "Rough Magic,"
which chronicled the 1992 Stan
ford season.
As far as potential replace
ments go, Stanford offensive
coordinator Terry Shea has
never been shy about his aspira
tions to become the head coach
at Stanford at some point in the

future. In fact, before Walsh
took the job in 1992, Shea had
been a finalist to replace Denny
Green, who left for a head
coachingjob with the Minnesota
Vikings.
Before coming to Stanford in
1992, Shea was the head coach
at San Jose State in 1990 and
1991. During his tenure, he
guided the Spartans to a 15-6-2
record. As offensive coordina
tor, Shea has developed an
offense which averages over 450
yards per game this year.
According to Leland, Shea
again would be on the list if
Walsh chooses to step aside.
