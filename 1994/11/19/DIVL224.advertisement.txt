"The l/nauthorized Authority on Cardinal Football"
America's fastest-growing independent Cardinal Football new!>-
letter Is on flrel It is in fact, smokin'l Sworn to combat apathy and
indifference. The Bootleg is dedicated to developing hard core
support of The Card. Originally just a vehicle for the editors to get
chicks, The Bootleg has earned a proud place in today's "unpopular
culture", that of free thought and reasoned self-expression. Here's
what people are saying about the Libertine Leviathan of Literary
Libation, Lacerative Loquaciousness, and Licentious Lambast:

Thought-Provoking Thunderchlckens of the Thesaurus for
yet another outstanding Bootlegl"
(Cliff S. of Norman, OK)
"We smoked those distempered Dawgsl...!n fact I haven't
seen so much smoke in a long timel And yes, the Ducks can
be roasted. I'm sure of Frost has risenl"

(Dave T., Local Defensive Line Coach)
