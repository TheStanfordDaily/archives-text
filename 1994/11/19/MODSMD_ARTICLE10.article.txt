# Senior class bids adieu to Stanford football
## 22 Cardinal players wind up careers, look to bring Axe back to Farm in their final game 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
For 22 seniors, the 97th Big
Game marks their final appear
ance in the cardinal and white.
While Saturday's game signals the
end of the seniors' collegiate ca
reers, they will carry memories of
four, or in some cases, five years as
Stanford football players with
them.
Over the past four years, Stan
ford lias chalked up a record of 25-
20-1, including an Aloha Bowl
berth and a victory in the Block
buster Bowl following the 1992 sea
son. This class has seen the highest
ranking Stanford experienced
since 1970 (ninth, in 1992) and the
first 10-win season since 1940.
However, this class has also
seen its share of hardships. The
last two years have failed to pro
duce a winning season and the de
fense never regained the national
caliber of the 1992 team.
Yet few classes have had such
an impact on the Stanford record
books. Thanks to Steve Sten
strom's incredible resiliency and
timely emergence as a redshirt
freshman in 1991, the Cardinal
passing records have nearly all be
come the possession of number 18.
During his 41-game stint as
starting quarterback, Stenstrom
amassed 10,351 career passing
yards (bowl games not included)
and holds 18 Stanford and Pacific
10 Conference records.
"When I was a freshman 1 would
see all the records posted up on the
walls and I saw that [John] Elway
passed for 9,000-plusyards," Sten
strom said. "Then you look up and
see IHeisman trophy winner] Jim
Plunkett two thousand yards be
hind the leader. You think those
records won't be touched, but then
things work out the right way and
all of a sudden your name is being
thrown around with those names.
It's quite an honor, it's really mind

boggling at times."
And during that time, another
highly touted quarterback has
worked his way up in Stanford his
tory. However, Justin Armour
dropped his aspirations of running
the show for the Cardinal to be
come one of the top wide receivers
on the Farm and a favorite target
of Stenstrom's.
Armour recently became the
career leader in yards receiving
(2,459) and can move into fourth
place in career receptions with just
three catches Saturday. He is also
second on the career touchdown
reception list with 20.
Other prominent seniors mak
ing their last trek include defen
sive mainstays nose tackle Jason
Fisk and linebacker Coy Gibbs.
These two cornerstones to the
Stanford defense have started, at
least part-time, for the last four
years. This year, Gibbs ranks first
in tackles with 79, and Fisk is right
behind him with 72.
The defense also says goodbye
to defensive backs Branyon Davis,
Kevin Garnett, John Henton and
Lenard Marcus and linebackers
Dave Grable, Nate Olsen and
Damon Phillips. Stanford place
kicker/punter Aaron Mills also de
parts after four steady years man
ning the kicking chores.
Offensively, versatile running
back Ethan Allen, offensive line
men Mike Jerich, Seth Dittman,
Carl Mennie, Ryan Waters, wide
receivers mark Harris and David
Shaw, tight ends Tony Cline and
Jeff Hansen, and all-purpose play
er Ozzie Grenardo are all making
their final appearance Saturday.
For the future, some players
are definitely gearing toward the
scouting combines and a career in
the National Football League
while others are acutely aware
that the football pads will find a
place on the shelf after the final
whistle blows against Cal.
While some may harbor reser

vations about leaving, Gibbs takes
a different angle to the end of his
football career.
"I'm sick of it,"he said. "I still
enjoy playing the games, but I
don't enjoy all the preparation. I
used to love it, thrive on it. I used
to get fired up for practice, what
ever it was, I was pumped. Now,
playing this thing since I was eight
or whatever, it finally caught up to
me and I got tired of it."
Cline, a fifth-year senior and
one of the more irreverent mem
bers of the team, shakes off Gibbs'
response. "I'm not sick of football,
not at all," Cline said. "I love foot
ball, that's why I want to continue
playing. Coy just wants to go on to
race-car driving [with his father]."
Part of playing on the same

team for four or five years is the
constant collection of game memo
ries. While many of these blur to
gether over an 11-game schedule,
some special moments stick out
for individual players.
"I doubt I'll remember the loss
es, but I'll remember the Big
Games and some of the big wins,"
Cline said. "Beating Colorado last
year [on his last-second touch
down catch] and beating Notre
Dame twice at Notre Dame —
those I'll remember."
As far as Big Game memories,
the 1990 contest in which Stan
ford pulled out a 25-24 win by
scoring nine points in the final 12
seconds stands tallest for the nine
fifth-year seniors on the roster.
"I remember [place-kicker

John] Hopkins looking around t
warm up for his kicking and the,
had taken down the practice net
so he starting lining up balls oi
the sidelines and kicking them u
into the stands," Fisk said. "Yoi
could see the ball just go Boom
and hit somebody in the head -
mostly they hit Cal fans."
Gibbs remembers an off-the
field instance as his favorite Bi
Game memory.
"[ln 1991] when Bob Whitfiel
flipped off the crowd, that was
good Big Game memory," Gibb
said.
And now, heading into thei
final game, these seniors have
chance to add to the already stc
ried history of one of college fool
ball's greatest rivalries.

fifth-year seniors on the roster.
"I remember [place-kicker

John] Hopkins looking around t
warm up for his kicking and the,
had taken down the practice net
so he starting lining up balls oi
the sidelines and kicking them u
into the stands," Fisk said. "Yoi
could see the ball just go Boom
and hit somebody in the head -
mostly they hit Cal fans."
Gibbs remembers an off-the
field instance as his favorite Bi
Game memory.
"[ln 1991] when Bob Whitfiel
flipped off the crowd, that was
good Big Game memory," Gibb
said.
And now, heading into thei
final game, these seniors have
chance to add to the already stc
ried history of one of college fool
ball's greatest rivalries.

For 22 seniors, the 97th Big
Game marks their final appear
ance in the cardinal and white.
While Saturday's game signals the
end of the seniors' collegiate ca
reers, they will carry memories of
four, or in some cases, five years as
Stanford football players with
them.
Over the past four years, Stan
ford lias chalked up a record of 25-
20-1, including an Aloha Bowl
berth and a victory in the Block
buster Bowl following the 1992 sea
son. This class has seen the highest
ranking Stanford experienced
since 1970 (ninth, in 1992) and the
first 10-win season since 1940.
However, this class has also
seen its share of hardships. The
last two years have failed to pro
duce a winning season and the de
fense never regained the national
caliber of the 1992 team.
Yet few classes have had such
an impact on the Stanford record
books. Thanks to Steve Sten
strom's incredible resiliency and
timely emergence as a redshirt
freshman in 1991, the Cardinal
passing records have nearly all be
come the possession of number 18.
During his 41-game stint as
starting quarterback, Stenstrom
amassed 10,351 career passing
yards (bowl games not included)
and holds 18 Stanford and Pacific
10 Conference records.
"When I was a freshman 1 would
see all the records posted up on the
walls and I saw that [John] Elway
passed for 9,000-plusyards," Sten
strom said. "Then you look up and
see IHeisman trophy winner] Jim
Plunkett two thousand yards be
hind the leader. You think those
records won't be touched, but then
things work out the right way and
all of a sudden your name is being
thrown around with those names.
It's quite an honor, it's really mind

boggling at times."
And during that time, another
highly touted quarterback has
worked his way up in Stanford his
tory. However, Justin Armour
dropped his aspirations of running
the show for the Cardinal to be
come one of the top wide receivers
on the Farm and a favorite target
of Stenstrom's.
Armour recently became the
career leader in yards receiving
(2,459) and can move into fourth
place in career receptions with just
three catches Saturday. He is also
second on the career touchdown
reception list with 20.
Other prominent seniors mak
ing their last trek include defen
sive mainstays nose tackle Jason
Fisk and linebacker Coy Gibbs.
These two cornerstones to the
Stanford defense have started, at
least part-time, for the last four
years. This year, Gibbs ranks first
in tackles with 79, and Fisk is right
behind him with 72.
The defense also says goodbye
to defensive backs Branyon Davis,
Kevin Garnett, John Henton and
Lenard Marcus and linebackers
Dave Grable, Nate Olsen and
Damon Phillips. Stanford place
kicker/punter Aaron Mills also de
parts after four steady years man
ning the kicking chores.
Offensively, versatile running
back Ethan Allen, offensive line
men Mike Jerich, Seth Dittman,
Carl Mennie, Ryan Waters, wide
receivers mark Harris and David
Shaw, tight ends Tony Cline and
Jeff Hansen, and all-purpose play
er Ozzie Grenardo are all making
their final appearance Saturday.
For the future, some players
are definitely gearing toward the
scouting combines and a career in
the National Football League
while others are acutely aware
that the football pads will find a
place on the shelf after the final
whistle blows against Cal.
While some may harbor reser

vations about leaving, Gibbs takes
a different angle to the end of his
football career.
"I'm sick of it,"he said. "I still
enjoy playing the games, but I
don't enjoy all the preparation. I
used to love it, thrive on it. I used
to get fired up for practice, what
ever it was, I was pumped. Now,
playing this thing since I was eight
or whatever, it finally caught up to
me and I got tired of it."
Cline, a fifth-year senior and
one of the more irreverent mem
bers of the team, shakes off Gibbs'
response. "I'm not sick of football,
not at all," Cline said. "I love foot
ball, that's why I want to continue
playing. Coy just wants to go on to
race-car driving [with his father]."
Part of playing on the same

team for four or five years is the
constant collection of game memo
ries. While many of these blur to
gether over an 11-game schedule,
some special moments stick out
for individual players.
"I doubt I'll remember the loss
es, but I'll remember the Big
Games and some of the big wins,"
Cline said. "Beating Colorado last
year [on his last-second touch
down catch] and beating Notre
Dame twice at Notre Dame —
those I'll remember."
As far as Big Game memories,
the 1990 contest in which Stan
ford pulled out a 25-24 win by
scoring nine points in the final 12
seconds stands tallest for the nine
fifth-year seniors on the roster.
"I remember [place-kicker

John] Hopkins looking around t
warm up for his kicking and the,
had taken down the practice net
so he starting lining up balls oi
the sidelines and kicking them u
into the stands," Fisk said. "Yoi
