# California/Stanford Match-Ups
## 
### 
In last week's brutal lost to
Oregon, Scott Frost completed 18
of 38 passes for 264 yards. Al
though he struggled at times he
showed signs of brilliance when
he turned a broken play into a
dramatic 28 yard touchdown run.
Pat Barnes, who now has a 139.4
quarterback rating, took over the
reigns of a struggling California
squad when team leader Dave
Barr was injured earlier this year.

Anthony Bookman, a 5 foot 9
inch running back from Grand
Prairie, Texas has rushed for a
solid 4.7 yards a carry with seven
touchdowns this season. Book
man, with his team leading 519
yards, will likely be the first true
freshman since Darrin Nelson in
1977 to lead the team in rushing.
Reynard Rutherford has ran for
660 yards and four touchdowns
this year. He has also caught 26
passes for just over 175 yards.

Justin Armour became Stan
ford's all-time receiving leader
with his 131 yards against Ore
gon. Armour now totals 2,459 ca
reer receiving yards breaking Ken
Margerum's school record of
2,430. With 1,069 yards this sea
son, Armour is only 49 yards shy
of Washington's 26 year old
record. Iheanyi Uwaezuoke has
caught 49 balls for 640 yards and
four touchdowns this year.

An avid hunter and marksman,
senior Tony Cline has been a con
sistent blocker and receiver
throughout his career. He has
caught for 290 yards this year and
at 6 foot 5 inches and 240 pounds
has muscled around defensive
ends and created holes for Cardi
nal running backs. Sophomore
California tight end Sean Bullard
has caught for 228 yards on 13
catches to average an impressive
17.5 yards per catch.

The heart and soul of the Cal
defense, senior Jerrot Willard
now has 464 career tackles and
will finish as Cal's No. 3 all-time
tackier behind only David Ortega
and Hardy Nickerson. Cardinal
linebacker Coy Gibbs leads the
team in tackles with 79. The se
nior has three sacks and eight
tackles for losses. In Big Game, he
will lead a defense that will have
to step up for the Cardinal to take
home the Axe.

After a tough season for place
kicker Eric Abrams — where he
made just fifty percent of his field
goals and missed two potential
game-winners — senior Aaron
Mills will start Big Game as the
Cardinal's place kicker and
punter. Mills is a perfect five for
five this year on point after touch
downs and has yet to attempt a
field goal. Ryan Longwell is aver
aging 41.5 yards a punt but has
only made 7 field goals in 19 at
tempts.
