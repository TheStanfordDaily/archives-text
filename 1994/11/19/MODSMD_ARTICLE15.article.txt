# Aaron Mills comes full circle
## Senior kicker to attempt field goals, punts in final game 
### Ben Hur Contributing writer 
From tragedy to triumph,
Aaron Mills has endured and suc
ceeded in a roller-coaster football
career at Stanford.
Highly recruited out of high
school by schools such as Florida,
Florida State and Georgia, Mills
had dreams of becoming a Nation
al Football League place kicker.
His decision to join the Cardinal
football squad was determined by
a combination of both football and
academics.
"The other schools didn't have
academics," Mills said. "When
Stanford recruited me, I saw that
they were a Pacific 10 Conference
team with a strong schedule, plus
their academics were right up
there with Harvard's. It was the
best of both worlds."
Upon his arrival in 1991, Mills
proved to be automatic on PATs,
converting 40 of 40, nearly break
ing the school record. He also
added six field goals that year.
However, at the beginning of
the 1992 season, Mill's hopes of an
NFL kicking career were dashed
when he was relieved of his place
kicking duties. His responsibilities
were limited to punting the foot
ball.
As the only punter on scholar
ship, Mills heard the sneers of his
critics.
"People thought I was punting
because no else was here," Mills
said. "I decided that I was going to
open some eyes and prove that I
would be the punter even if there
were ten other guys here."
Mills did more than open some
eyes. He ended up having one of
the best punting seasons in Stan
ford history. He racked up 2,661
yards punting and finished first in
the Pac-10 and 14th in the nation
in punting average.
"I got another chance to con
tribute. This time I didn't mess
up," Mills said.
As one of the best punters in
the land, Mills prepared to im
press the scouts and worked to be
come a powerful defensive weapon
in the Cardinal arsenal. But like
many aspects of the 1994 season,
life took an unexpected turn.
Coaching for a local junior high
school girl's basketball team, Mills
tore the anterior cruciate liga
ment in his right knee.
"I just came down on it during
practice. It was a freak accident,"
Mills said.
But Mills insists that his injury
came while doing something he
loves.
"In the future, I want to do
stuff with kids, get them active in
sports. I want to do something to

get this 'Sega Generation' into
athletics," Mills said.
An accelerated rehabilitation
was necessary in order for the se
nior to be ready in the fall. Al
though not 100 percent when the
season began, Mills has been effec
tive throughout the year, averag
ing 40.8 yards per kick, fourth in
the Pac-10.
Although statistically he has
not punted as well this year, Mills
is pleased with the way he has
played.
"I haven't been the same this
year physically as I was last sea
son, but I am happy with the way I
have performed. Although it was
not as good as last season, I am
just as proud," he said.
Coach Bill Walsh shared simi
lar sentiments, acknowledging
that recovering from such a seri
ous injury and returning to the
field so quickly requires a truly

dedicated individual.
"I thought he was very brave to
come through the way he did with
his bad knee," Walsh said.
In his final career game in a
Stanford uniform, Mill's journey
has come full circle. He will handle
both the place-kicking and punt
ing duties against Cal and has
nearly completed his rehabilita
tion. It seems only fair that his fi
nale will take place before a packed
crowd at Berkeley's Memorial Sta
dium.
"I have at least one more game,
and I am going to take advantage
of it," Mills said.
According to Walsh, Mills will
have many opportunities to boot
punts on future Sundays.
"I believe he has an NFL fu
ture," Walsh said. "He is an out
standing athlete. He punts well, is
a good kicker, and is great to
coach."
