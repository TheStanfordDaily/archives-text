# Stanford's sophomore flanker electrifies defenses, overcomes adversity to spark Cardinal
## Manning speaks softly and carries a Big Game

When Brian Manning arrived
at Stanford last year, it definitely
proved to he a humbling experi
ence.
"Back home you have your lit
tle highlight tape and it's real spe:
cial," ho began in a nostalgic tone
of voice. "But when you get here,
somebody else can show you some
thing better. I was stunned at the
talent level."
The sophomore flanker from
Kansas City, Mo., let out a holler
when it was suggested that he has
put together quite a college high
light film in just two seasons on
the Farm. "I guess so," he said
blushing.
Last year alone, Manning in
deed lit up the highlight reel with
an array of dazzling receptions
that averaged a whopping 22.5
yards per catch — which would
have topped the Cardinal record
had injuries not kept him from re
ceiving the minimum 20 passes.
In seven games last season, he
racked up 17 receptions for an as
tounding 382 yards and four
touchdowns. The Stenstrom-
Manning combination proved a
lethal offensive weapon. All from a
guy who doesn't think he deserves
his own highlight tape.
In a grueling four game stretch
last season where Stanford faced
perennial powerhouses Colorado,
UCLA, Notre Dame and Arizona,
Manning rose to the occasion. He
caught 14 of his 17 receptions
against those tough opponents,
amassing over 300 yards, and four
touchdowns. A hamstring injury
sidelined him for four of the last
five games last season, but this
year he has returned stronger
than ever.
With his sleek 5-foot 11-inch
frame and lightening 4.33 speed,
Manning continues to stun oppo
nents and dazzle fans. With 19.4
yards per catch, Manning is chas
ing the record again this year. Last
week against Oregon, he had three
catches for 81 yards. In two short
seasons, the young receiver has
emerged as an exciting and explo
sive player who can make big plays
and win ball games.

Off the field, however, Brian
Manning's temperament is any
thing but explosive. He is a shy,
soft-spoken product of his Mid
west upbringing. In his own
humble way, he maintains a
strong sense of values, and takes
nothing for granted. When asked
if it was a difficult transition
from Kansas City to Palo Alto, he
thought for a moment before re
plying. "1 don't know if it was
tough, I don't think I know what
tough is yet."
But Manning's road to Stan
ford was anything but easy. I lis se
nior year in high school was
marked by hardship and uncer
tainty. Immediately before the
football season began, his mother
passed away, losing heryear-and
a-half battle with cancer. On top of
that, he sprained both of his an
kles and sat out for most of the
season. It was a tough year, Man
ning admits, but with the help of
his family he was able to put the
pieces back together.
"It was real quick and surprised
everybody. But [Mom] prepared
us. Our family is real spiritual. To
this day I'm real spiritual. . . that
lightened the load. God helped me
through that critical period."
Somehow, Manning overcame
his troubles. A strong sense of
family and religion kept him going
when the chips were down. "My
family's God fearing," he ex
plained. "That has really set in me
over the years."
Manning rehabilitated his an
kles and went on to win the Mis
souri State triple jump title that
spring. That impressive feat fur
ther enticed college recruiters who
had been impressed by Manning's
junior football season. The rest is
history.
It took no time for Manning to
show that he belonged at Stanford.
Even after sitting out nearly his
entire senior season of high school,
he had no trouble adjusting to big
time college football and proved
himself as one of Stanford's most
promising young talents.
The key to Manning's success is
that he takes nothing for granted.
He admits that the Cardinal's sea
son hasn't shaped up quite as he

might have hoped, but he refuses
to write off the rest of Stanford's
season and look ahead to next
year.
"As a team, this year is not
over. Our first goal is to win this
football game and bring home the
Axe." Only then is it time to reflect
on this season. "This off-season is
for us as a team to realize how hor
rible it felt to lose. Sundays really
hurt."
Brian Manning is a team player

who feels uncomfortable talking
about himself. He'd much rather
talk about the team's accomplish
ments than his own achievements.
After Saturday's loss to Oregon,
he was hesitant to comment on his
individual performance, saying
"we got outplayed as a team, we
can't point fingers.
"We're going through some dif
ficult times, so we're there for one
another. . . It's a very difficult part
of our lives," he said.

Manning admits that he is not a
vocal team leader, but he leads by
example. "I'm a leader by the way
I play the game and by the way I
practice," he said. "I'm kind of soft
spoken — I'm not one to speak a
lot. Maybe one day I'll be able to do
that."
But, for now, Manning leads
through his electric play on the
field — a contribution which he
hopes will help bring the Axe back
to the Farm.
