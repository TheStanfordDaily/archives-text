# Allen concludes versatile career on the Farm
## Stanford fullback reflects on Cardinal highlights, looks to future after graduation 
### Tom Baranowski Staff writer 
For Stanford Cardinal running
back Ethan Allen, last week's 55-
21 shellacking at the hands of the
Oregon Ducks has stirred up some
haunting memories.
"It reminded me a little of the
Cal game last year," Allen said.
"We were kind of flat and we just
didn't play well. I don't know if I
can pinpoint any specific areas
where we played poorly — our de
fense was struggling, but our of
fense was as well."
With the Oregon game in the
not-so-distant past, Allen and the
rest of the Cardinal football team
look this week to their greatest
rival — the Golden Bears of Cali
fornia. Last year Stanford lost to
Cal for the first time since 1986 by
a score of 46-17 and now it is look
ing to end a disappointing 3-6-1
'94 campaign on a high note by
bringing the Axe back to its right
ful place on the wall in Tressider
Memorial Union.
The game takes on a special im
portance for Allen and the rest of
the graduating seniors.
"Obviously the Big Game
means a lot to the seniors and the
people who won't be around next
year," said Stanford's starting
fullback. "It means plenty to those
people, but I would hope it is im
portant to the rest of the team be
cause there is a lot of tradition be
hind this game. It may not effect
any post-season opportunities for
either team, hut it will give us at
least as many wins as we had last
year. So, tradition aside, it's im
portant to get one more win."
In order to get one more victory
against a very tough Cal team the
Cardinal is going to have to pick up
its team play.
"I think it's a pretty good
match-up because Cal has a pretty

good defense, and we've got a de
cent offense," Allen said. "Both of
those units have played well at
times this year, but neither of the
two teams has been successful.
Hopefully we can be physical on of
fense like we were against Wash
ington."
If there is one thing that Allen
has not had a problem doing, it is
being physical. In the last two
years, he has been one of the most
consistent Cardinal players. After
spending his freshman year as a
redshirt and then receiving only
limited playing time in '91 and '92,
Allen burst onto the scene last
year.
In '93 Allen led the Cardinal
and all Pacific 10 Conference run
ning backs in receptions, hauling
in 52 passes for 313 yards and one
score. To those impressive num
bers he added 46 carries for 260
yards and two touchdowns from
his fullback slot.
After injuries decimated the
Cardinal backfield this year, Allen
found himself thrust into the fire
as the only Stanford running back
with solid game experience.
Through 10 outings he has re
sponded beautifully, carrying the
ball 64 times for 264 yards and two
touchdowns while catching 36
more passes for a career high 359
yards and one score.
With one game left in his Stan
ford career, Allen has amassed
1,379 yards of all-purpose running
and eight touchdowns, while con
tinuing to contribute to his team
as a blocker and a leader.
When asked about his time at
Stanford, Allen is quick to point
out a number of intangibles that
have contributed to his success.
"The offensive scheme —
which gets the football to the run
ning backs when the defenses are
focusing on receivers — leaves
running backs open more," he

said. "And Steve Stenstrom puts
the ball right on you, which really
contributes to all of those recep
tions. I've just kind of been used
as a utility back. I've gotten a lit
tle more opportunity to run the
ball this year, but my emphasis
each week depends on whose
healthy. Each week it seems like I
could be running, blocking, or re
ceiving."
All good things must come to an
end, though, and for Allen this Big
Game marks the transition to the
next step of his life — one which
will undoubtedly lead to graduate
school.

"I'll be graduating in the
spring," he said. "Right now I'm
trying to nail down a Graduate
Assistant position at a Big Ten
football program. I've talked to
Minnesota, and I think that there
is a spot for me there, but I'm also
interested in Michigan and a few
other Big Ten schools. I'm from
Minnesota originally, so I would
like to continue my schooling
back there and be part of the Big
Ten."
Allen realizes that there is still
one more task to be accomplished
here on the Farm however —
bringing back the Axe in his final

game in a Cardinal uniform.
"[This Big Game] is going to be
very emotional, just because foot
ball is something I've been doing
for a long time," the senior said. "I
can think back to all the years I
have played, the times I've had,
the camaraderie, and everything
else, so it will be very emotional for
me.
"I'm really thankful for this op
portunity, and I'd love for us to
have a great game, and for us to
play well. But, if it doesn't turn out
that way, I will have had a great
experience here, and that's what
I'll remember."
