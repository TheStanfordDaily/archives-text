# Big Game history filled with uncanny finishes
## Stanford, California rivalry marked by last second victories in annual battle for the Axe 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
Big Game is what it is because it epito
mizes the greatness in college football. Two
universities in a struggle for the supremacy
of the Bay Area. A rivalry with over one
hundred years of history.
Over the duration of the titanic Stan
ford-Cal struggles, a few odd things are to be
expected. And those odd things have hap
pened. Four times teams snatched victories
from the grasp of certain defeat, four times
leaving the vanquished to ponder what
could have been. Here are the details of
those four games:
Number 1 — Big Game 1972
At halftime, things appeared fine for
Stanford.
The Cardinal led 14-3 on the strength of
Gordv Riegel's 71-yard interception return
for a touchdown. Bears' quarterback Vince
Ferragamo — a future L.A. Ham — had
been intercepted four times and looked
shaky.
Cal coach Mike White kept faith in Fer
ragamo and let him remain in the game. It
proved to be a wise decision.
Ferragamo led a comeback and put Cal in
a position to win. With only minutes to go in
the game, the Golden Bears were down 21-
18 but had the ball and were making a drive.
Cal moved the ball down field and found
themselves on the Cardinal six-yard line.
Three plays later Cal faced fourth down
with just seconds to go. Take the field goal
and the tie, right?
White made his second wise decision of
the game. He went for the win.
Through the mud, tension and confu
sion, Ferragamo found wide receiver Steve
Sweeney wide open in the corner of the end
zone and tossed the football in his general
direction. Defensive back Jim Ferguson in
tended to cover him but slipped and fell,
leaving Sweeney open. As time ran out and
the fans poured onto the field, Sweeney
dove and caught the pass to capture the vic
tory for Cal. The Bears never attempted the
PAT and the final score read Cal 24, Stan
ford 21.
Number 2 — Two years later: 1974
This time, it was a grim day for Stanford.
Despite a 61-yard Guy Benjamin touch
down pass to Tony Hill that gave the Cardi
nal the lead, future Atlanta Falcons' quar
terback Steve Bartowski put Cal in front
with a TD pass to Steve Rivera with 33 sec
onds left in the game to make the score 20-
19.
The Golden Bears kicked off and left
Stanford most of the field to move down
with 23 seconds remaining. Two passes
later, however, Benjamin gave the Cardinal
its final chance.
The football sat on the Cal 33-yard line.
At this point the field goal would be a diffi
cult 50-yarder.

No problem.
Stanford place kicker Mike Langford had
already put two previous attempts through
the goal posts. He did not disappoint on his
third test.
Final score Stanford 22, California 20.
Number 3 — His knee touched the
ground! His knee touched the ground!
Year 1982
Title — "The Play"
Everyone knows what happened. Dwight
Garner was tackled. His knee touched the
ground. The game was over. Everyone could
see what had hapenned — except the offi
cials.
John Elway engineered one of his patent
ed drives. Stanford led 19-17 after a Mark
Harmon 35-yard field goal with four sec
onds left to play. Four seconds.
Four seconds for Cal to wreck the heart
of every Cardinal fan and one trombone.
After a 15-yard unsportsmanlike con
duct penalty was assessed to Stanford for
excessive celebration, the Cardinal kicked
off from the 25-yard line. What took place
next has become one of the most well known

football plays in history.
The Harmon squib kick ended up in the
arms of Kevin Moen at the 43-yard line.
Moen then pitched to Richard Rodgers who
then was immediately hit. Rodgers some
how managed to toss the ball before he was
down. The ball ended up with Dwight Gar
ner who then ran a few yards before being
tackled. Only the officials did not agree.
While the Stanford Band began their 15
minutes of fame by moving into the end
zone, the play continued. Garner then
pitched the ball, while down, back to
Rodgers. Rodgers then ran down field until
caught up to by members of the Cardinal
team and tossed it to Marion Ford. Ford
sprinted to the 20-yard line, saw that he was
about to be smothered and threw it over his
head.
The next moves seemed like d6j& vu hap
pened as Moen caught the blind pass and
then proceeded to flatten trombone player
Gary Tyrell, thus ending the most infamous
day in Stanford's storied history.
Stanford 20, Cal 19 (a.k.a. 25).
Number 4 — "Please clear the field.

The game's not over."
Eight years after "the Play", Stanford fi
nally got its revenge.
Cal led 25-18. With just minutes left in
the game and Stanford quarterback Jason
Palumbis took control.
Palumbis capped a drive that lasted 1:54
minutes with a touchdown pass to Ed Mc-
Caffrey bringing the Cardinal within one
point.
Stanford went for the win.
On the two-point conversion, Palumbis
looked to pass and did so, completing a short
pass to John Hardy. The only problem was
that Hardy was a Cal cornerback. With 12
seconds remaining, the Cal boosters ran
onto the field cheering the Bears' apparent
victory.
However, the game still had a few plot
twists remaining. After moving the kickoff
15 yards forward because of a penalty on the
Cal cheering section, Stanford lined up for
the kickoff.
The onside kick was executed perfectly
by kicker John Hopkins. The ball bounced

away from the paws of Cal run
ning back Russell White into the
hands of Stanford's Kevin Scott.
The Cardinal gained the ball on
Cal's 37-yard line and had anoth
er chance to score. The first pass
by Palumbis fell incomplete but
Cal's John Belli was flagged for
roughing the passer. The 15-yard
penalty moved the ball to the 22-
yard line. Palumbis threw anoth
er incomplete pass but Stanford
had time for one last play.
In came Hopkins. Hopkins had
connected on four prior field goals
and was presented with a chance
for a fifth. The 39-yard attempt
went between the goalposts and
the Stanford fans ran onto the
field, victors by the final score of
Stanford 27, California 25.
When the Big Game is all the
team has left, it appears that both
the Cardinal and the Golden
Bears rise up to the occasion. The
combined record for Stanford
going into these four games was
18-19-2 while Cal's was 19-19-1.
"We've played our best games
when neither of us were having
great years," said Stanford head
coach Bill Walsh.
"Judging from our records,
this year's Big Game should be
one of the best ever."

Despite a 61-yard Guy Benjamin touch
down pass to Tony Hill that gave the Cardi
nal the lead, future Atlanta Falcons' quar
terback Steve Bartowski put Cal in front
with a TD pass to Steve Rivera with 33 sec
onds left in the game to make the score 20-
19.
The Golden Bears kicked off and left
Stanford most of the field to move down
with 23 seconds remaining. Two passes
later, however, Benjamin gave the Cardinal
its final chance.
The football sat on the Cal 33-yard line.
At this point the field goal would be a diffi
cult 50-yarder.

No problem.
Stanford place kicker Mike Langford had
already put two previous attempts through
the goal posts. He did not disappoint on his
third test.
Final score Stanford 22, California 20.
Number 3 — His knee touched the
ground! His knee touched the ground!
Year 1982
Title — "The Play"
Everyone knows what happened. Dwight
Garner was tackled. His knee touched the
ground. The game was over. Everyone could
see what had hapenned — except the offi
cials.
John Elway engineered one of his patent
ed drives. Stanford led 19-17 after a Mark
Harmon 35-yard field goal with four sec
onds left to play. Four seconds.
Four seconds for Cal to wreck the heart
of every Cardinal fan and one trombone.
After a 15-yard unsportsmanlike con
duct penalty was assessed to Stanford for
excessive celebration, the Cardinal kicked
off from the 25-yard line. What took place
next has become one of the most well known

football plays in history.
The Harmon squib kick ended up in the
arms of Kevin Moen at the 43-yard line.
Moen then pitched to Richard Rodgers who
then was immediately hit. Rodgers some
how managed to toss the ball before he was
down. The ball ended up with Dwight Gar
ner who then ran a few yards before being
tackled. Only the officials did not agree.
While the Stanford Band began their 15
minutes of fame by moving into the end
zone, the play continued. Garner then
pitched the ball, while down, back to
Rodgers. Rodgers then ran down field until
caught up to by members of the Cardinal
team and tossed it to Marion Ford. Ford
sprinted to the 20-yard line, saw that he was
about to be smothered and threw it over his
head.
The next moves seemed like d6j& vu hap
pened as Moen caught the blind pass and
then proceeded to flatten trombone player
Gary Tyrell, thus ending the most infamous
day in Stanford's storied history.
Stanford 20, Cal 19 (a.k.a. 25).
Number 4 — "Please clear the field.

The game's not over."
Eight years after "the Play", Stanford fi
nally got its revenge.
Cal led 25-18. With just minutes left in
the game and Stanford quarterback Jason
Palumbis took control.
Palumbis capped a drive that lasted 1:54
minutes with a touchdown pass to Ed Mc-
Caffrey bringing the Cardinal within one
point.
Stanford went for the win.
On the two-point conversion, Palumbis
looked to pass and did so, completing a short
pass to John Hardy. The only problem was
that Hardy was a Cal cornerback. With 12
seconds remaining, the Cal boosters ran
onto the field cheering the Bears' apparent
victory.
However, the game still had a few plot
twists remaining. After moving the kickoff
15 yards forward because of a penalty on the
Cal cheering section, Stanford lined up for
the kickoff.
The onside kick was executed perfectly
by kicker John Hopkins. The ball bounced

away from the paws of Cal run
ning back Russell White into the
hands of Stanford's Kevin Scott.
The Cardinal gained the ball on
Cal's 37-yard line and had anoth
er chance to score. The first pass
by Palumbis fell incomplete but
Cal's John Belli was flagged for
roughing the passer. The 15-yard
penalty moved the ball to the 22-
yard line. Palumbis threw anoth
er incomplete pass but Stanford
had time for one last play.
In came Hopkins. Hopkins had
connected on four prior field goals
and was presented with a chance
for a fifth. The 39-yard attempt
went between the goalposts and
the Stanford fans ran onto the
field, victors by the final score of
Stanford 27, California 25.
When the Big Game is all the
team has left, it appears that both
the Cardinal and the Golden
Bears rise up to the occasion. The
combined record for Stanford
going into these four games was
18-19-2 while Cal's was 19-19-1.
"We've played our best games
when neither of us were having
great years," said Stanford head
coach Bill Walsh.
"Judging from our records,
this year's Big Game should be
one of the best ever."

Big Game is what it is because it epito
mizes the greatness in college football. Two
universities in a struggle for the supremacy
of the Bay Area. A rivalry with over one
hundred years of history.
Over the duration of the titanic Stan
ford-Cal struggles, a few odd things are to be
expected. And those odd things have hap
pened. Four times teams snatched victories
from the grasp of certain defeat, four times
leaving the vanquished to ponder what
could have been. Here are the details of
those four games:
Number 1 — Big Game 1972
At halftime, things appeared fine for
Stanford.
The Cardinal led 14-3 on the strength of
Gordv Riegel's 71-yard interception return
for a touchdown. Bears' quarterback Vince
Ferragamo — a future L.A. Ham — had
been intercepted four times and looked
shaky.
Cal coach Mike White kept faith in Fer
ragamo and let him remain in the game. It
proved to be a wise decision.
Ferragamo led a comeback and put Cal in
a position to win. With only minutes to go in
the game, the Golden Bears were down 21-
18 but had the ball and were making a drive.
Cal moved the ball down field and found
themselves on the Cardinal six-yard line.
Three plays later Cal faced fourth down
with just seconds to go. Take the field goal
and the tie, right?
White made his second wise decision of
the game. He went for the win.
Through the mud, tension and confu
sion, Ferragamo found wide receiver Steve
Sweeney wide open in the corner of the end
zone and tossed the football in his general
direction. Defensive back Jim Ferguson in
tended to cover him but slipped and fell,
leaving Sweeney open. As time ran out and
the fans poured onto the field, Sweeney
dove and caught the pass to capture the vic
tory for Cal. The Bears never attempted the
PAT and the final score read Cal 24, Stan
ford 21.
