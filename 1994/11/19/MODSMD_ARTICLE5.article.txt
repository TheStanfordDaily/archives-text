# Bears struggle through season of frustration
## California looks to retain Axe, salvage injury-plagued season with Big Game win 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
Saying that Big Game will be a
contest between two very even
teams, two very similar squads
fighting for the same postseason
honors is a little misleading.
Sporting a 2-5 record in the Pa
cific 10 Conference and a 3-7
record overall, California has suf
fered as many bad breaks this sea
son as the Bad News Cardinal.
Beginning with a two game los
ing streak against perennial foot
ball powers San Diego State and
Hawaii, the Golden Bears' season
had nowhere to go but even fur
ther down. Cal will enter its sea

son finale against Stanford this
Saturday on the tails of a miser
able five-game losing streak — its
longest dry spell since 1986.
In its first contest of the season,
the Bears suffered an embarrass
ing loss to San Diego State as
Aztec kicker Peter Holt sliced in a
33-yard field goal with zero ticks
left on the clock. To add insult
upon injury, that slim 22-20 victo
ry marked the first time in 18
tries, dating back to 1985, that the
Aztecs had defeated a Pac-10
team.
"Obviously we've got a lot of
work to do," said senior quarter
back Dave Barr after the game. "I
tell you, that hurts — the life is

sucked out of me right now."
However, no amount of hard
work could resuscitate the Bears
against Hawaii the following week
as the mighty Rainbows handed
Cal a 21-7 loss at Memorial Stadi
um.
"The only positive thing is that
nobody died," Barr said.
Other than that minor bright
spot, the game was clouded with
two blocked punts, two missed
field goals and Cal's inability to
score when they were in the red
zone.
To emphasize its frustration,
the Golden Bears were stuck at
fourth-and-46 while on their own
2,6.

"Losing to two WAC [Western
Athletic Conference] teams in the
public eye, that's pretty poor,"
Barr said.
Using those lackluster perfor
mances against the WAC schools
as a wake-up call, Cal then pro
ceeded to string oft three consecu
tive victories against Arizona
State, San Jose State and UCLA,
before becoming mired in their
present five-game losing streak.
Playing at home against the
Sun Devils in their third game, the
Bears came back from a 10-point
deficit to squeeze by ASU 25-21.
Barr led the way with a 27-of-34
performance, accounting for most
of Cal's 424 yards of offense that
afternoon.
Those impressive offensive sta
tistics also poured over into the
following week's 55-0 rout over
San Jose State.
The Bears welcomed the Spar
tans into Memorial Stadium with
three consecutive touchdowns be
fore the game was even six min
utes old. On offense, Cal steam
rolled for 523 yards (San Jose
State managed 147) including 317
yards on the ground for an average
of 7.1 yards per play. The Bears
also held a 26 to 9 advantage in
first downs.
After that, the next matchup
against UCLA was to be Cal's last
hurrah. Closing a four-game
homestand up north, the Golden
Bears delighted their fans by
romping the favored Bruins on na
tional television, 26-7.
On October 15, however, the
Bears began to slide. The Univer
sity of Oregon Ducks taxed Cal's
offense for 400 yards up in Eu
gene, Ore., before handing the
weary Bears a 23-7 defeat. Playing
without injured quarterback Barr
(broken collar bone), Cal managed
only nine first downs under the
guidance of Kerry McGonigal.
"There was just no consistency
to our offense and our tackling
was horrible," McGonigal said
after the game.
Relying on a young defensive
core, Cal showed its youth early
and often during the match. Miss
ing tackle after tackle, the error
prone defense allowed touchdown
drives of 75 and 69 yards after tak
ing a slim 7-0 lead on the first drive
of the game.
However, that loss to Oregon
might be seen in a more positive
light when compared to Cal's 61-0

shellacking at the hands of the
Trojans on Oct. 23. Once again the
culprit could have been either
youth, inexperience or the absence
of Barr at the command post.
Whatever the trouble source, Cal
made no excuses after the game.
"I'll tell you, whether you're a
freshman, sophomore or senior,
you've got to make the plays, and
we didn't make the plays. Sixty
one points? That's pitiful," said
safety Ricky Spears.
It got so bad in the fourth quar
ter that head coach Keith Gilbert
son pulled McGonigal and insert
ed sophomore quarterback
prospect Pat Barnes into finish off
the game. Up until that point, this
highly touted prospect had been
redshirting in order to preserve
his three years of eligibility.
"If I didn't [try everything pos
sible], I'm sending a message that
we're calling the season over, and I
don't want to do that," Gilbertson
said. "We're not canceling the sea
son because of this loss."
Despite Gilbertson's last ditch
efforts at salvaging the season, Cal
continued to slide against Wash
ington State the next week. Bor
rowing a play from Stanford's sea
son of misfortune, kicker Ryan
Longwell missed a 57-yard field
goal with eight seconds left, and
the Bears had to settle for a 26-23
loss.
In addition to that, Cal lost Mc-
Gonigal for the season with a sep
arated left shoulder suffered dur
ing the opening drive in the second
half. Barnes was unavailable be
cause of a bruised nerve he agitat
ed in the Trojan contest. So in
came Ziv Gottlieb, the wide receiv
er, to finish off the game.
But things kept going from bad
to worse. A 13-7 loss to Arizona on
Nov. 5 made it four straight weeks
without either a victory or a legiti
mate quarterback.
And finally last week, the Bears
self-destructed for a 31-19 defeat
against Washington. As a symbol
of its frustrating season, a 79-yard
interception return and a 38-yard
fumble return for a touchdown
helped the Huskies to a 17-0 lead,
without the benefit of a single first
down. To make matters even more
unbearable, the Golden Bears out
gained Washington on offense 108
yards to six during that time.
In the opening quarter alone,

Washington forced Cal to commit
six turnovers, intercepted Barnes
twice and converted on four of the
turnovers for a 20-0 lead.
Overall, Cal outgained Wash
ington 469 to 279 yards and had
24 first downs to the Huskies 15.
Frustration is definitely the
name of the game this Saturday as
two down-on-their-luck teams
duke it out at Memorial Stadium.
Both teams will be featuring their
lineups of the future, as sopho
mores Barnes and Scott Frost for
the Cardinal initiate a quarter
back rivalry which will last for at
least another two years.
Thus far, Stanford holds a 47-
38-11 lead in the series, and over
the last 10 years the Cardinal has
maintained a healthy 7-2-1 ad
vantage despite losing the Axe last
season.
