#12 Oregon (8-3) at Oregon State (4-6) 12:30 ABC
With a win over the Beavers in today's Civil War, the Oregon
Ducks will earn their first trip to the Rose Bowl since 1958. The
Ducks come off their most impressive game of the year — a 55-21
mauling of Stanford — but must contend with a strong Beaver
squad. Oregon State upset Washington State 21-3 last week and is
looking to derail the Rose Bowl hopes of their biggest rival. The
Ducks lead the series 47-40-10.
#18 Washington (7-3) at Washington State (6-4) 3:30 Prime
The Cougars play host to the Huskies in the Apple Cup in Pull
man, Wash. While the Huskies are inelligible for post-season play,
a Washington State win today would put them in good position for
a bowl game. Washington coach Jim Lambright and Washington
State coach Mike Price both hail from Everett, Wash. The Huskies
lead the series between the two schools 55-25-6 but the Cougars
have won two of the last three meetings at Martin Stadium.
#13 Southern Cal (7-2) at UCLA (4-6) 12:30 ABC
The Trojans share the lead in the Pacific 10 Conference after
outgunning Arizona last week in Los Angeles. A win today over
UCLA, coupled with an Oregon loss to Oregon State, would put
USC into the Rose Bowl. Last year USC and UCLA met at the L.A.
Coliseum with a Rose Bowl birth on the line and played a thriller.
The Bruins held a 17-0 advantage at the half but saw the Trojans
cut the lead to 27-21 with 2:30 to play. At third and goal from the
UCLA 2 yard line, Rob Johnson's potential game winning throw
was intercepted by the Bruins' Marvin Goodwin in the end zone
and UCLA advanced to the Rose Bowl.
Arizona State (3-7) at #19 Arizona (7-3) Fri. Nov 25,3:00A8C
Arizona State has won two of the last three meetings between
the Sun Devils and Wildcats, but Arizona owns a 38-28-1 series
lead. The game has important ramifications for the Wildcats, who
look to finish the year at 8-3 and advance to a New Years' Day bowl
game. The Sun Devils, however, are merely playing for pride and a
chance to upset their biggest rival on the road.
