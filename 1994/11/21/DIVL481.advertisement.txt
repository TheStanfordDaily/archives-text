Invitation to Nominate Candidates for
The James W. Lyons
Award for Service
The James W. Lyons Award for Service was
established to recognize and honor students of
the Stanford community for service contributions
made by students from a variety of schools,
departments, teams, clubs, residences, and
community projects. All enrolled students are eligible
to receive the award.
elections are made on the basis of nominations
from members of the Stanford community:
faculty, staff, and students. Nominations can be made
in the form of a letter addressed to Michael Jackson,
Dean of Students, 323 Old Union, Mail Code (3010).
The award ceremony and dinner will be held during
winter quarter 1994-95. The deadline for submitting
nominations for fall/winter quarter awards is:
Friday, December 16, 1994
The Service Award program is a nice way to
express appreciation to some of the amazing
student-citizens in our community. I hope you will
think of this program when you encounter such
. students.
