Now, we're focusing on expansion in six
key areas: digital video/audio, microcon
trollers, data communications,
RF/wireless communications, and fixed
function logic and PLDs. In many of
these areas, we already have significant
technological expertise. For example,
Philips Electronics has vast experience
in consumer and industrial products
such as color televisions; audio compo
nents; and standard, cordless and
cellular telephones. This broad knowl
edge gives us an unmatched foundation
on which to develop advanced semicon
ductor solutions in these fields.
