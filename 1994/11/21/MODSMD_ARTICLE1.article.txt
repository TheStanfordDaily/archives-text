# USC bound
## Jackson, Akiyama to resign 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson will leave Stanford in
late March to accept the position
of vice president for student af
fairs at the University of South
ern California in Los Angeles.
Jackson's wife, Assoc. Dean of
Memorial Church Diana Akiya
ma, will also leave Stanford in
March to pursue a doctorate and
serve as a lecturer at the 24,000-
student institution.
Jackson — who became dean
of students in 1991 after serving
in various other University posi
tions since 1980 — said he signed
a contract Wednesday with USC.
The resignations were an
nounced Friday.
Akiyama has served as a dean
at Memorial Church since 1988.
She said that she has not yet de
termined the exact field in which
she will study and teach, but that
it will likely be a "mix of anthro
pology, religion and feminist
studies."
Akiyama added that she will
consult with the president of
USC regarding the future of the
school's chaplaincy, which is
presently going through a transi
tionary period.
Jackson said he became aware
of the open position at USC less
than a month ago, when officials
contacted him to find out if he
was interested in the post.
USC officials had conducted a
national search for the position
without finding a suitable candi
date, he added.
They had heard about Jack
son's work at Stanford, however,
and contacted him about the job,
even though he never submitted
an application, he said.
As vice president for student
affairs at USC, Jackson will over
see 28 administrative units — in
cluding residential life, learning
services, the student health cen
ter and ethnic support services.
He will be responsible for a $20
million annual budget and a pro
fessional staff of 200, plus about
300 student employees.
Jackson — who grew up near
USC — said it will be a challenge
to serve a student body that is
twice as large as Stanford's and
"still keep a place like USC per
sonal." Nevertheless, he said he
is looking forward to the chal
lenge.
"It's a definite step up for
Michael," said Vice Provost and
