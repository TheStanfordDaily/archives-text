# USC bound
## Jackson, Akiyama to resign 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson will leave Stanford in
late March to accept the position
of vice president for student af
fairs at the University of South
ern California in Los Angeles.
Jackson's wife, Assoc. Dean of
Memorial Church Diana Akiya
ma, will also leave Stanford in
March to pursue a doctorate and
serve as a lecturer at the 24,000-
student institution.
Jackson — who became dean
of students in 1991 after serving
in various other University posi
tions since 1980 — said he signed
a contract Wednesday with USC.
The resignations were an
nounced Friday.
Akiyama has served as a dean
at Memorial Church since 1988.
She said that she has not yet de
termined the exact field in which
she will study and teach, but that
it will likely be a "mix of anthro
pology, religion and feminist
studies."
Akiyama added that she will
consult with the president of
USC regarding the future of the
school's chaplaincy, which is
presently going through a transi
tionary period.
Jackson said he became aware
of the open position at USC less
than a month ago, when officials
contacted him to find out if he
was interested in the post.
USC officials had conducted a
national search for the position
without finding a suitable candi
date, he added.
They had heard about Jack
son's work at Stanford, however,
and contacted him about the job,
even though he never submitted
an application, he said.
As vice president for student
affairs at USC, Jackson will over
see 28 administrative units — in
cluding residential life, learning
services, the student health cen
ter and ethnic support services.
He will be responsible for a $20
million annual budget and a pro
fessional staff of 200, plus about
300 student employees.
Jackson — who grew up near
USC — said it will be a challenge
to serve a student body that is
twice as large as Stanford's and
"still keep a place like USC per
sonal." Nevertheless, he said he
is looking forward to the chal
lenge.
"It's a definite step up for
Michael," said Vice Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds. "It's been his dream
for a long time to be a vice presi
dent for student affairs. We're
really very proud of both him and
Diana and will miss them both."
University President Gerhard
Casper also praised Jackson for
his "experience and hard work."
"Michael Jackson has done a
splendid job in one of the most
challenging positions at the Uni
versity," Casper said. "Michael has
tackled his various assignments
with high energy and good
humor."
Edmonds said it is too early to
know who will replace Jackson.
She added that she will "analyze"

Jackson's posi
tion before she
makes any deci
sions.
An interim
dean of students
may be appoint
ed until a perma
nent replace
ment can be
found, she said.

Edmonds said she has especial
ly appreciated the "fair and sensi
tive way" in which Jackson has
handled students going through
the University's judicial system.
Director of the Office of Stu
dent Activities Nanci Howe said
one of Jackson's greatest contri
butions to Stanford is "building
up the ethnic centers and commu
nities on campus. . . . He's helped
provide greater services for those
communities."

Howe — who
has served on the
Women's Center
Advisory Board
with Akiyama —
also praised
Akiyama for her
extensive work
with the women's
community on
campus.

Akiyama has been one of the
most supportive staff members
for female students on campus,
Howe said.
"She's taken a lot of initiative to
bring women's issues to the fore
front and she's been a good role
model and inspiration to many
female students," Howe said.
Akiyama also said she consid
ers her work with female students
to be one of her best Stanford
experiences.

"One of the things that will stay
with me is my work with female
students .. . from support groups
to discussion groups about vio
lence against women and women
and spirituality," Akiyama said.
"There's not another Diana
Akiyama out there. She's been
spectacularly effective in her
work at Stanford," said Dean of
the Chapel Robert Gregg.
"To be around her is to have
your life enriched," Gregg added.
"She's a person of genuine depth
who is deeply human and wonder
ful as a counselor to people."
Gregg said the University will
conduct a nationwide search for
Akiyama's replacement. "In the
best possible circumstances, the
position will be filled by next fall,"
he said. "We may try to find some
interim help through the late
spring and summer."
