# GOP leader asserts Clinton is capable commander in chief
## Dole disputes Helms' claim 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Republican
leader Bob Dole joined the nation's top mil
itary officer yesterday in disputing Sen.
Jesse Helms' claim that President Clinton
is not capable of leading the U.S. armed
forces.
"I had some reservations early on, but I
think he's up to the job now," Dole, the
next Senate majority leader, said on ABC's
"This Week With David Brinkley."
Clinton's ability as commander in chief,
long an issue because of his Vietnam era
anti-war activities, was questioned again
Friday by Helms, a North Carolina Repub
lican, who alleged during a CNN interview
that military leaders share his view that the
president is not "up to the job."
That drew a quick response Saturday
from Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen.

John Shalikashvili, who called The Washing
ton Post and The New York Times to defend
Clinton. "I think it's important to me that
this view not be represented as that of the
military leadership, or for that matter, the
view of the military as a whole," he said.
Shalikashvili said he did not want to
"pick a'fight" with Helms, who is in line to
be the next chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
But Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a
member of the committee, charged that
Helms was "coming close to aiding and
abetting insubordination" of the nation's
chosen commander in chief.
"I think it's very, very reckless. I regret
deeply that he said it and I would hope he
would apologize," Dodd told CBS' "Face the
Nation."
