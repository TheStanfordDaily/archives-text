LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) -
Angola's government and rebels
signed a treaty yesterday ending 19
years of civil war, but their leaders
are not even expected to attend the
ceremony, diplomats said Satur
day.
UNITA rebel leader Jonas Sav
imbi, normally a master of public
relations, designated a deputy to
sign the treaty in Lusaka, the Zam
bian capital, a rebel statement said.
That increased speculation that
Savimbi — who has not been seen
in public for months — was wound
ed or even killed in a recent govern
ment offensive.
Angolan President Jose Eduar
do dos Santos, who arrived in Lusa
ka on Saturday, may also designate
a deputy so that representatives of
equal stature put their names to
the document.
Fighting continued as diplomats
scrambled to pull off an event
already delayed by five days. Gov
ernment artillery boomed north of
Huambo, the fallen UNITA
stronghold. Aid workers trapped in
Uige said fighting continued in
that northern city.
The peace treaty originally was
to have been signed Tuesday, but

the ceremony was pushed back
after a string of government victo
ries on the battlefield. The rebels
had to be coaxed back to negotia
tions.
A truce was called Wednesday,
but UNITA — the National Union
for the Total Independence of
Angola — claimed government
troops broke it within hours. On
Friday, the rebels said all airports
in rebel-controlled areas were
under bombardment, preventing
Savimbi from leaving for Lusaka.
Government Gen. Higino
Carneiro said the army had agreed
to mediators' requests for safe pas
sage for the rebel chief. The rebels
did not take up the offer.
The government also denied any
truce violations. In a statement
Saturday, it gave an "absolute
guarantee" that fighting had
stopped.
Yet there were clear signs of
clashes just 9 miles northeast of
Huambo on the main road to
Kuito, another central city.
Soldiers from a government
patrol said they clashed with a
group of 20 rebels to the northeast.
The soldiers said artillery further
east had been booming for days.
