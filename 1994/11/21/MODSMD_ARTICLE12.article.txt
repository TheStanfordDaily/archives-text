SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) â€” Renegade Muslim forces and
Serbs were attacking government sol
diers yesterday in northwest Bosnia,
apparently trying to capture the region
before the international community
could react.
Senior U.N. officials met in Zagreb,
Croatia, to consider using NATO war
planes to attack Serb forces, but didn't
say whether they would use the expand
ed powers granted Saturday by the U.N.
Security Council.
Government troops in Bihac, in
Bosnia's northwestern corner, were
under attack by rebel Muslim forces and
Serb armor, according to the United
Nations and both sides in the fighting.
Serb artillery in neighboring Croatia was
firing across the border at the govern
ment forces.
Serbs captured the waterworks for

Bihac, a city of 48,000 people, giving
them control of the water supply, said
U.N. sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
The assaults reflected the determina
tion of the Serbs and of Muslims loyal to
warlord Fikret Abdic to cripple the gov
ernment army, which defeated Abdic in
August and broke through Serb lines in
a stunning advance last month.
Serbs have recaptured most of their
lost land, and appear to be hurrying to
finish the job. Abdic is trying to recap
ture the northern town of Velika
Kladusa, his headquarters until his
defeat.
A U.N. official in Zagreb reported
heavy fighting around Velika Kladusa,
where government forces are surround
ed. The official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the Abdic forces
appeared to have the upper hand.

The official HINA news agency of
Croatia reported that the "whole border
between Bosnia and Croatia is on fire...
under joint attack by the Abdic forces
and Bosnian Serb forces."
It said they were supported by
artillery and tanks firing from Serb-held
Croatian territory.
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman,
who recently has become an ally of
Bosnia's Muslim-led government, invit
ed the United Nations on Friday to
bomb rebel Serbs in his country to stop
the cross-border attacks.
In Batnoga, Croatia, just across the
border from Velika Kladusa, refugees
who fled with Abdic in August were
waiting on Saturday to return.
Listening to explosions from the
fighting, one refugee, Minka Hadzic,
said, "Each shell means our return home
is closer."
