AIDS drug
LONDON (AP) — A combina
tion of a new AIDS drug, 3TC, and
AZT helps fight the virus better
than AZT alone, according to two
studies presented at an AIDS
meeting yesterday in Glasgow.
The studies, involving 352
patients, traced blood chemicals in
volunteers. Investigators did not
compare symptoms or death rates,
which provide more definitive
proof.
"These results that we have
today show that people (taking
3TC with AZT) should be living
longer," said Dr. Francesco Bellini,
president and CEO of Bioc'hem
Pharma, the Montreal-based
biotech company that designed the
drug.
AZT, also known Zidovudine, is
the standard drug used to attempt
to control AIDS.
Bellini added there is no evi
dence, yet, that 3TC prolongs life.
"The results are fairly impres
sive. It's clearly a step forward,"
said Dr. Robert Schooley, head of

the immunology committee of the
AIDS Clinical Trials Group at the
National Institutes of Health. He
attended the AIDS meeting in
Scotland.
Speaking in a telephone inter
view, Schooley said "3TC by itself
is not much of a winner because
resistance develops quickly, but
the virus has a tough time main
taining resistance to both (3TC
and AZT)."
Schooley said he is already
treating some patients with both
drugs, but after hearing the recent
results will offer the combination
to more of his patients with HIV.
School prayer
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sena
tors from both parties voiced doubt
yesterday that a constitutional
amendment allowing school
prayer could pass, and indicated
they would prefer to steer away
from such social issues.
"I don't think we ought to get
bogged down" on such divisive
matters, Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., said on ABC's "This

Week With David Brinkley."
"If we're going to bring about
change, we better bring up some
measures we can pass, so the
American people will get the mes
sage that we're serious about it,"
said Dole, who is expected to
become majority leader next year.
House Speaker-to-be Newt Gin
grich has promised a vote on a
school prayer amendment by next
July 4. While most Republicans,
including Dole, support the princi
ple, many say the new majority
party must first concentrate on
economic matters.
Sen. Orrin Hatch, a conserva
tive Republican from Utah, said on
CBS' "Face the Nation" it is more
important to pass constitutional
amendments on a balanced bud
get, unfunded federal mandates on
the states and a line-item veto.
"On school prayer, I really don't
believe the votes are there for a
vocal prayer amendment."
He said that while there was
support for a silent prayer or
reflection amendment, "I would
prefer to solve the economic prob

lems first."
Mexican elections
VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico
(AP) — Mexicans voted yesterday
in a tense state-level test of recent
national reforms meant to give the
opposition a better chance of chal
lenging the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
The PRI, which has ruled Mex
ico for 65 years, was favored to win
the governorship and most of the
17 city councils in the Gulf Coast
state of Tabasco. Officials of the
leftist Democratic Revolution
Party, or PRD, said they were con
fident of making gains.
There were some reports of
irregularities. State policemen
were accused of trying to organize
a multiple-vote scheme, and more
than 1,800 ballots were stolen in
one town.
"Tabasco was considered a labo
ratory for the revolution in the
early part of this century," said
PRI spokesman Jose Alberto
Aguilar. "Now, it is considered a
laboratory for reform."
