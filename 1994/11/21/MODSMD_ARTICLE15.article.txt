## Following the Band 
### 
All students should have
followed Band's example
of spirit, sportsmanship

Last weekend, the
Stanford Band once again
demonstrated brilliance and
creativity as they helped lead the
Big Game crowd in cheering on
the Cardinal football team. Unfor
tunately, their efforts were not
enough to prevent a close Cal vic
tory.
Stanford Band members also
showed admirable restraint when
they decided not to engage in the
violence and confrontation that
have marred too many past Big
Games. They even tried to keep
other Stanford fans under control
in an effort to preserve the friend
ly rivalry that lies at the heart of
Big Game tradition.
Unfortunately, the Band's
efforts failed in that respect as
well. Instead of praising the
Band's conduct and moderating
their own behavior in kind, fans
accused the Band of "selling out"
and launched unprovoked attacks
of their own on the UC-Berkeley
band and security personnel.
Band members complemented
their lively spirit with an equal
degree of composure. They not
only refrained from any violence
or provocation themselves, but
they also actively worked to help
control the conduct of Stanford
student fans. In one instance,
Band Manager Chris Quaintance
helped avert an ugly confronta
tion between the two teams' mas
cots when Oski the Bear taunted
the Tree.
Stanford students, on the other
hand, put on a poor show at Big
Game. The Stanford Band per
formed at halftime without facing
any violent assault from Cal fans.
Nevertheless, when it came time
for the UC-Berkeley band to take
the field, a few Stanford fans saw

fit to go beyond the friendly and
harmless jeering and keychain
jingling of tradition by launching
fruit, bottles, smoke bombs and
other detritus at the Cal Band.
To be sure, only a few students
were directly responsible for actu
ally throwing things at the Cal
band. But a disappointingly vocal
portion of the crowd cheered
those students' attacks and urged
them on further.
This kind of behavior certainly
won't destroy Stanford's reputa
tion as an educational institution,
but it clearly has some negative
impact on how the university is
publicly viewed. More important
ly, though, it reflects badly on a
seemingly immature and poor-los
ing Stanford student body.
Also, some of the Stanford stu
dents' throws hit security person
nel, many of whom were Stanford
police officers who had come to
Big Game in response to com
plaints that in past years UC-
Berkeley security personnel had
not done enough to keep Stanford
students safe. Those police offi
cers were probably not the stu
dents' actual targets; more likely
they were just caught in the cross
fire. Even so, it is dismaying that
the police officers were bombard
ed by objects hurled by the very
students whom they had crossed
the Bay to protect.
Unfortunately, by the time the
game was over, UC-Berkeley fans'
behavior had also exceeded the
boundaries of acceptable behavior
and degenerated into violence.
And as evidenced by two arrests
of UC-Berkeley students and 15
citations for violations of UC
rules, Cal fans' behavior at Big
Game was far from impeccable.
But by making themselves the
first to engage in unsporting con
duct as a group, and by not fol
lowing the civilized example
offered by the Band, Stanford
students made themselves into
the real weenies at this year's Big
Game.
