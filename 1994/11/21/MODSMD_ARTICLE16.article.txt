Stanford doesn't show adequate respect for humanities

THE BROAD DECLINE of human
istic learning, which has well
known long-range causes (e.g. the
growing despiritualization of our demo
cratic order deplored by Vaclav Havel),
has been aggravated at Stanford by sev
eral distinct factors:
The central one is the strong leaning
to science, technology, professional and
business training since the founding.
Leland Stanford, we note wistfully,
thought the students could have no bet
ter preparation for their lives and
careers than the reading of great litera
ture. Tantum ab illo. . . .
After 1968, Stanford became the bell
wether for politicization of universities
and clumsy attempts at social engineer
ing. The humanities, being close to the
human concerns of revolutionaries and
"soft" (though, for that very reason of
suppleness, superior in wisdom and
authority in their higher instances),
were hardest hit by the "Great Leap For
ward," as is always the case historically.
The nonpolitical, disinterested scholars
were spiritually "guillotined," and many
eminent ones retired early or departed.
Some hung on and suffered inordinately.

Standards (in grading and overall)
dropped precipitously, as was almost
universally acknowledged by the nation
al professoriate in surveys. Cynthia
Ozick wrote, "High art is dead" on cam
puses. A host of top intellectuals spoke
of a "tragedy" of apocalyptic propor
tions."
All this was worsened at Stanford by
the administration's persistent refusal to
appoint a humanist dean. A case in point
is the mishandling of foreign languages
and literatures, which, at Stanford as
across the nation, suffered a decline in
enrollment. The politicization was large
ly at fault, as radical new forces such as
women's and black studies attracted
crowds. The "canon," which was natu
rally strong in the older sister cultures,
took a particular beating. Also at fault
was the overtenuring caused by govern
ment intervention, ineptitude and lack
of foresight at the helm. The result was
too many teachers, financial waste and
resentment of colleagues in other fields.
Graduate fellowships were practically
abolished, lowering enrollments even
further. The 40 foreign literature faculty
(many very distinguished) were blamed,

foiced intu humiliating new arrange
ments and publicly insulted.
What can this do other than reinforce
the broad extant feeling in the profession
that Stanford does not take its humani
ties sector very seriously? Former Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy admit
ted as much. No wonder all the top stu
dent scholars go elsewhere now.
Things are beginning to improve
nationwide in some quarters: a new
Association of Literary Scholars and
Critics bids fair to eclipse the grotesque
ly ideologized and degraded Modern Lan
guage Association. At a time when the
American public is turning massively
against politics (and left-wing ideology
and liberalism is eschewed even by
Democrats), to remain mired in the
politicization left from the '60s is singu
larly obtuse and improvident in a way
that threatens the fortunes of our gradu
ates. But the Report of the Commission
on Undergraduate Education shows no
awareness of that: the "incoherence"
(and glut of materials) they deplore in
Cultures, Ideas and Values is insepara
ble from the inane idea of teaching sev
eral cultures mishmashed together (and

ours in a debunking spirit). Rather than
face that abyss of error and noisome
protest, they prefer to put off the whole
business for two more messy years.
This failure of perspective, of clarity
of vision, of expression and of leadership
is the gravamen of Stanford's current
floundering. Even if it represents a
diplomatic maneuvering, it is an intoler
able way to carry on university life, sup
posedly feeding on truth.
It is time to fish or cut bait. Stanford
either should put sensitive, timely,
appropriately experienced and responsi
ble people in charge of the humanities or
else it should drop them and become
Stanford Tech, which, behind the
Potemkin facade, it already predomi
nantly is.
