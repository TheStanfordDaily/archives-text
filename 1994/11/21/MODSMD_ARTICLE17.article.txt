# Presence of Memorial Church poses problems for a secular university
## 
### 
I am prompted to write in response
to Jonathan Huston's column titled
"Taking the long way home." Huston
extols the mosaic on the front of
Memorial Church and concludes that it
is "most fitting for an institute of high
er learning." He thereby brings up the
issue of Memorial Church and its prop
er role at Stanford.
Memorial Church is a problem for
the following reason: It is a Christian

church being run and maintained by an
ostensibly secular university made up
of people of diverse faiths and atheists.
While it may be "nondenominational,"
Memorial Church is definitely a build
ing suitable only for Christian worship,
and accordingly the University-paid
deans who administer services there
are all ordained in either the Episcopal
or Baptist church. Everyone in the
Stanford community ought to ask him
self or herself whether he or she thinks
that the University should be operating
any houses of worship, and if so,
whether that house of worship ought
to be an exclusively Christian monu
ment.
I would argue that it borders on the

offensive to non-Christians tc have
Jesus and a large cross staring down at
them as they walk or bicycle to their
supposedly secular and objective class
es in the Quad. Moreover, the fact that
the University financially supports this
church, and only this church, sends the
message to non-Christians that their
religious structures are somehow not
as deserving of official support. The
best solution is for the University to
discontinue its patronage of any explic
itly religious subinstitution, and hence
to abolish Memorial Church as a Uni
versity-run house of worship. The Uni
versity ought not erect, maintain or
otherwise financially support any reli
gious group because inevitably it will

have to start picking and choosing
which religious groups "deserve" such
funds and which do not.
However, recognizing the aesthetic
value of the building, I propose that
Memorial Church be maintained as a
museum piece of wonderful architec
ture, beautiful mosaics and awe-inspir
ing interior design.
Every religious group should have
the opportunity to gather and worship
however they please, but the Universi
ty should not officially support one
religious group or the other as long as
it claims to be a secular, diverse insti
tution.
