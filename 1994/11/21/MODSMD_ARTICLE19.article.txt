## A 						worthwhile Enterprise 
### 
SPACE, THE FINAL frontier.
These are the words that have
drawn generations of Stanford stu
dents and other earthlings into movie
theaters and in front of television sets
all over the planet, tugging with the
unrelenting pull of a tractor beam. They
have boldly taken us where no man had
gone before, then even where no woman
had gone before, either; they have sent
us to stations hidden in deep space,
through black holes and wormholes, for
ever seeking out new life, new civiliza
tions, new M-class planets, dead Vul
cans, marine mammals, God and at least
back in the good old days of Captain
Kirk, new interspecies mating opportu
nities.
Our fascination with the adventures
of Spock and Co. was not always appre
ciated by our mentors. I remember the
day when my second-grade teacher
finally had had enough and demanded
that we immediately remove and destroy
all the communicators, phasers and pho
ton torpedoes that had been stashed
away under our desks and in the closets
and carefully concealed by cloaking
devices and protected by force fields. My
high school physics teacher would hold
lengthy lectures on the absurdity of
warp-speed travel and energizers, chid
ing us for watching such nonsense. But
we didn't heed his words, enamored as
we were by the adventure and the tech
nology and the pure exhilaration of the

voyages of the starship Enterprise.
Back on Earth in the 20th century,
space travel has been progressing rather
slowly. After an initial flurry of excite
ment caused by the moon landings, a
series of mishaps and tragedies coupled
with budget woes have curtailed the
best-laid plans to send humans to the
planets and beyond. The dictates of prof
itability have restricted the space pro
gram to commercial applications and
research in low Earth orbit, with an
occasional unmanned (and unwomaned)
interplanetary probe thrown in for good
measure. The growing realization that a
host of down-to-earth problems such as
crime, poverty, social disintegration and
war must be solved before venturing
into the galactic unknown has con
tributed to the conviction that $50 bil
lion is better spent on prisons than mis
sions to Mars. While Crusher and Worf
cavort through the universe on the
search for extraterrestrial intelligence,
the closest most of us get to a trans
porter beam is through a cathode-ray
tube.
The objection to spending huge
amounts of money on space exploration
while children go hungry on the streets
is certainly well-founded and valid and
should help keep society's priorities in
perspective. But space travel neverthe
less has an important role to play in the
full development of humanity's poten
tial. It offers an unparalleled challenge

to curious and innovative minds, provid
ing a constructive arena for the broad
ening of human knowledge and ingenu
ity. It tests our ability to balance the
prowess of technology with the need to
accommodate the frailty of human life.
Looking beyond technology, the battle
to survive in a hostile environment for
the sake of discovery and exploration
puts the battles fought on Earth for the
sake of nationalism and hegemony in a
different perspective. Pressing past the
borders of the comfortable haven of our
planet redefines our notion of home,
expanding it to entK)mptttja-.Â»ofc just our
state or ethnicity or nation, but all of
Earth and even beyond.
The endeavor to make human life
worth living is twofold: overcoming the
negative outgrowths of contemporary
society and defining a positive direction
for the development of future society.
Fixing what's broken is a necessary but
not sufficient part of progress. Next
time you see Picard surmounting one
insurmountable challenge after the
other and expressing humanity's inquis
itive nature to the fullest, think what
steps we, too, can take to guide human
enterprise to the stars.

Jonathan Huston will make it so
