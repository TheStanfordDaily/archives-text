# Cal holds on to the Axe for another year
## Stanford falls 24-23 in showdown marred with turnovers, penalties 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
For all those fans expecting
an offensive showdown between
two of the top quarterbacks in
the country, they certainly have
an axe to grind after Saturday's
97th Big Game.
The Stanford-Cal match-up
should have been an aerial battle
between quarterbacks Steve
Stenstrom and Dave Barr. With
injuries ending their seasons,
however, the seniors handed the
reins of two explosive offenses
over to inexperienced sopho
mores.
And the game resembled
what might be expected with
newcomers at the helm. Eight
turnovers and over 200 yards of
penalties between the two teams
marked one of the ugliest Big
Games in recent memory as the
Bears won 24-23.
Jumping out to a 14-0 lead
just one minute, 14 seconds into
the game, Cal (4-7,3-5 in the Pa
cific 10 Conference) held on long
enough to retain the Axe for the
second straight year. Stanford
(3-7-1, 2-6) had a chance to take
a 25-24 lead with two minutes
left, but a two-point conversion
attempt failed when Golden
Bear safety Matt Clizbe knocked
away a Scott Frost pass intended
for Tony Cline in the end zone.
"It was a great Big Game,"
said head coach Bill Walsh. "It
was typical of these kinds of
games. Most often, Stanford
would win those, but we certain
ly didn't win this one."

Cal's defense did little to help
Frost in only his second start,
putting him under relentless
pressure. Throwing intercep
tions on his first and last passes
of the day, Frost was 11-for-29
for 148 yards and a touchdown.
While he did scramble for 39
yards on 18 carries, he also had
difficulty holding on to the ball,
fumbling twice and lateraling a
ball out of bounds.
"I guess I didn't squeeze it
hard enough," Frost said.
"Those are the kind of things
you can't do, so it was a bad play
by me."
Stanford was loose with the
ball for the entire game, fum
bling eight times and losing two.
Along with costly roughing-the
passer and personal foul penal
ties, the Cardinal regularly shot
itself in the collective foot.
Cal experienced a similar in
ability to hold on to the football.
The Bears also posted four
turnovers on the day, including
two fumbles in the final 5:13 of
the game. Barnes' performance
shadowed Frost's, as the Bear
back-up ended the game with
13-for-21 for 127 yards and one
touchdown. Like Frost, he also
threw two interceptions.
With two minutes on the
clock, it looked as if Cal's defense
would have its way with Stan
ford's offense. Clizbe intercepted
Frost on the second play of the
game and Cal running back Ty
rone Edwards rambled 41 yards
for the score on the next play.
