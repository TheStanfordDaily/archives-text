# Cal holds on to the Axe for another year
## Stanford falls 24-23 in showdown marred with turnovers, penalties 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
For all those fans expecting
an offensive showdown between
two of the top quarterbacks in
the country, they certainly have
an axe to grind after Saturday's
97th Big Game.
The Stanford-Cal match-up
should have been an aerial battle
between quarterbacks Steve
Stenstrom and Dave Barr. With
injuries ending their seasons,
however, the seniors handed the
reins of two explosive offenses
over to inexperienced sopho
mores.
And the game resembled
what might be expected with
newcomers at the helm. Eight
turnovers and over 200 yards of
penalties between the two teams
marked one of the ugliest Big
Games in recent memory as the
Bears won 24-23.
Jumping out to a 14-0 lead
just one minute, 14 seconds into
the game, Cal (4-7,3-5 in the Pa
cific 10 Conference) held on long
enough to retain the Axe for the
second straight year. Stanford
(3-7-1, 2-6) had a chance to take
a 25-24 lead with two minutes
left, but a two-point conversion
attempt failed when Golden
Bear safety Matt Clizbe knocked
away a Scott Frost pass intended
for Tony Cline in the end zone.
"It was a great Big Game,"
said head coach Bill Walsh. "It
was typical of these kinds of
games. Most often, Stanford
would win those, but we certain
ly didn't win this one."

Cal's defense did little to help
Frost in only his second start,
putting him under relentless
pressure. Throwing intercep
tions on his first and last passes
of the day, Frost was 11-for-29
for 148 yards and a touchdown.
While he did scramble for 39
yards on 18 carries, he also had
difficulty holding on to the ball,
fumbling twice and lateraling a
ball out of bounds.
"I guess I didn't squeeze it
hard enough," Frost said.
"Those are the kind of things
you can't do, so it was a bad play
by me."
Stanford was loose with the
ball for the entire game, fum
bling eight times and losing two.
Along with costly roughing-the
passer and personal foul penal
ties, the Cardinal regularly shot
itself in the collective foot.
Cal experienced a similar in
ability to hold on to the football.
The Bears also posted four
turnovers on the day, including
two fumbles in the final 5:13 of
the game. Barnes' performance
shadowed Frost's, as the Bear
back-up ended the game with
13-for-21 for 127 yards and one
touchdown. Like Frost, he also
threw two interceptions.
With two minutes on the
clock, it looked as if Cal's defense
would have its way with Stan
ford's offense. Clizbe intercepted
Frost on the second play of the
game and Cal running back Ty
rone Edwards rambled 41 yards
for the score on the next play.

The Cardinal then handed the
ball right back to the Bears with a
fumbled exchange between Frost
and Bookman on the second play of
the next drive. Again, Cal found the
end zone one play later as Barnes
hooked up with Iheanyi Uwaezuoke
for a 16-yard score.
However, Stanford's defense
began to assert itself and held the
Bears to just a field goal for the rest
of the half. After a 30-yard field goal
by senior Aaron Mills, the defense
held and forced Cal to punt out of
their own end zone.
The Cardinal took over on the
Bear 29-yard line and Frost connect
ed with sophomore Brian Manning
across the middle, who knifed past
two Cal defenders for the touch
down. Manning caught four passes
for 86 yards on the afternoon.
After a 38-yard Ryan Longwell
field goal put Cal up 17-10, senior
linebacker Coy Gibbs intercepted
Barnes at the Stanford 30-yard line
and rumbled 69 yards before being

knocked out of bounds inside the
one-yard line. Adam Salina pounded
into the end zone on the next play,
tying the game at 17 at halftime.
"Our defense showed some grit,"
Walsh said. "We haven't played good
defense, let's face it, all year and
today we got ripped pretty good. But
when the pressure was on, our guys
really played hard and got some
fumbles and kept us in the game."
Each team quickly capitalized on

toward staying than
leaving'

key mistakes made by its opponent.
Of the four touchdowns scored in
the first half, three took only one
play and the other took two. These
scoring drives took three, five, seven
and 12 seconds, respectively.
A scoreless third quarter displayed
each team's inability to find an offen
sive rhythm. Stanford drives ended
with a Frost fumble and a punt while
Cal threw another interception and
missed a 45-yard field goa

Barnes' second interception
occurred on the second play of the
half, as senior Mike Hall dropped
back into zone coverage and picked
off a pass across the middle. Taking
over at the Bears' 26-yard line, Stan
ford got down to the 15 before Frost
fumbled on a draw play at the 11.
After an impressive drive late in
the third quarter, Stanford saw a
chance to take the lead by kicking a
26-yard field goal. However, a fake
field goal play on fourth-and-two at
the nine-yard line failed to pick up
the first down. It was the same quar
terback option play Stanford used
against Washington two weeks ago
for a two-point conversion. Howev
er, Frost couldn't break through
Cal's first wave of defense and was
stopped short.
"That's a great play if we make it
and a terrible play if we don't," Frost
said. "[Coach Walsh] had to tell me
three or four times because I wasn't
expecting it. It just took me by sur
prise."
Taking over on the eight-yard
line, the Bears then drove the length
of the field for the go-ahead score.
Edwards capped the 12-play drive
with an eight yard scoring run, cap
ping a huge day for the senior.

Carrying 24 times for 205 yards,
Edwards' ability to pick up eight or
10 yards whenever Cal needed it pro
vided the key to the Bears' nine
minute time of possession advan
tage. Holding the ball for over nine
minutes in both the second and
fourth quarters, Cal forced Stanford
into hurrying its offense rather than
allowing Frost to become comfort
able and work the ball around like
Stenstrom did all year.
"Scott's a great competitor, but
Steve has played for four years and
he's going to make decisions out
there under pressure that new guys
just can't make," senior wide receiv
er Justin Armour said.
Stanford's running game had
trouble finding a consistent alterna
tive to Frost's passing. Rushing 44
times for 118 yards, the Cardinal
managed only 266 yards in total
offense, the lowest total of the sea
son. For the game, Bookman picked
up 58 yards on 18 carries, leading the
Cardinal in rushing for the fifth
straight game. The freshman ended
the season as Stanford's leading
rusher with 577 yards on 129 carries.

But even after all the chances the
Bears had to put the game away,
Stanford only began the fourth

quarter with a 24-17 deficit. After
Cal fumbled for the second time in
the fourth quarter, the Cardinal
took over on the Bears' 22-yard line.
A jumping catch at the one-yard line
bv Armour set up a one-yard leap by
Allen to being Stanford within one
point with two minutes left.
However, when Cal came out

position to come up

GarSe endings that you
remember for all
timds, but we

with,a zone defense against a play
designM to attack man-to-man cov
erage,. Frost's pass on the two-point
conversion was batted down as he
scrambled around the backfield.
'"We put ourselves in a position to

come up with one of those Big Game
endings that you remember for all
times, but we just didn't get it done,"
Armour said. For the day, Stan
ford's all-time leading receiver was
held to two catches for 23 yards.
The Cardinal defense, which
played well after giving up two early
scores, forced Cal to punt with less
than a minute to play. Starting at
the Stanford 20-yard line with no
timeouts, Frost's first pass sailed
over the head of Manning and was
intercepted by safety Dante DePao
la, ending the Cardinal's chance to
record another miracle victory at
Memorial Stadium.
As for Walsh, he remains unde
cided about his future with the Car
dinal program. Amid speculation
that he will step down from the head
coaching position, Walsh tried to
focus his attention on Big Game.
However, now that the season is
over, the entire Stanford community
waits impatiently for Walsh's
announcement, which should come
November 29 at his end-of-the-sea
son press conference.
"Whatever conversations I've had
with the athletic director and
[Provost] Condoleezza Rice have not
necessarily been my leaving," he

said. "I've met with Rice at least
three times during the season to talk
about the athletic program and
where it was going and things that
could be done to make it a better pro
gram.
"I didn't go in suggesting I was
leaving, nor did she have any
thoughts along those lines. We're
looking for what's best at Stanford. I
do not expect to leave the University
— I could very well remain as head
coach. There has certainly been no
decision whatsoever about my leav
ing, and I just want to make sure the
program is going in the right direc
tion.
"I lean a lot more toward staying
than leaving, and I'm certainly
expecting to remain at Stanford either
way and be part of the football pro
gram. There are all kinds of options,
and we're going to explore those.
Right now there's no press to do any
thing other than our recruiting."
One other personnel matter
Walsh and his staff must discuss is a
replacement for offensive line coach
Monte Clark. On the staff since
1993, Clark decided to retire from
Stanford to look for business and
coaching opportunities closer to his
Michigan home.
