Stanford Review tries
to hide its true motives
by feigning ignorance
I can respect The Stanford Review
being a conservative campus paper.
What I can't respect (and can't believe,
for that matter) is The Stanford
Review's editor in chief, Aman Verjee,
defending his paper's right to print a
degrading picture of a Native American
as a logo for one of his paper's columns
with the excuse that "he fails to under
stand the Native-American community's
argument. The protesters view the logo
as demeaning and offensive, but never
explain why."
The problem with The Review's
defense is that, rather than play the
ignorance game, their editor in chief

should simply be honest about his
paper's intentions. The reason The Stan
ford Review is willing to print such a
racist logo is because The Stanford
Review isn't written for Native-Ameri
can students. The Stanford Review is an
exclusive paper.
And just in case Verjee is failing to
understand my argument, let me make it
clear for him. First-class papers are writ
ten for a wide variety of people — men
and women from different classes and
races who want to read interesting and
informative news. Highly-rated journal
ists are those who try to include their
readers rather than exclude them.
Respectable writers are those who are
willing to admit their mistakes when
they realize they're wrong.
If Verjee was being honest when he
said, "We never intended to offend any
one," he would have simply removed the
picture from his paper when he became

aware that it offended Stanford stu
dents. His failure to do so shows not that
he doesn't understand their position but
that he doesn't care if his paper discrim
inates against Native Americans or not.

By destroying copies of
The Review, protesters
hurt rational discourse
I disagree with almost everything
that I read in The Stanford Review,
and like many students on campus I
find The Review's use of the Indian
mascot offensive. But I write to con
demn the recent protest in which
approximately 50 students publicly

tore up "as many issues [of The
Review] as they could find" and asked
"other ethnic groups to also remove
The Stanford Review from its racks"
(Nov. 17).
As a university, Stanford is sup
posed to be a place dominated by ratio
nal discourse, fueled by the energy of
free thought. Those students who
destroyed copies of The Review have
shamefully stunted this process on
both a literal and a symbolic level.
The protesters have advocated the
physical destruction of the most recent
issue of The Review and have thus
attempted to regulate the free flow of
ideas. I say to these students: Who are
you to take away my right to read
whatever I choose? Do you think that I
am not intelligent enough to read The
Review and form my own opinion? By
destroying these newspapers you have
hindered my ability to inform myself,

to think fully about the issues at hand.
You have infringed upon my right to
free thought.
For years, elements of the religious
right have attempted to ban certain
books from school libraries on the
grounds that the books are morally
offensive. Fortunately, these efforts
have been widely condemned as bla
tant ideological censorship. The
actions of the protesters must be con
demned on the same grounds.
I support social activism as a force
of change in society. Members of the
student community have every right to
protest both The Review's use of the
old mascot and President Casper's
inaction on the subject. But the censo
rial, self-righteous methods of the
recent protest have no place in an
institution of higher learning.
