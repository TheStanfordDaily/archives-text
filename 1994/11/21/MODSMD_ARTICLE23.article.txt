# THE
						BIG GAME 1994
## 'Fourth quarter, Stanford — Allen 1 yard run (pass failed) at 2:06' Big Game drama not only on field
						Continued from page 6 
### John Lawson Contributing writer 
For almost 100 years, the Stanford
Cardinal and the California Golden
Bears have vied for the Axe and, with it,
bragging rights to football in the Bay
Area. And each time the game has been
played, an equally exhilarating and color
ful battle has been waged by those who
sit in the stands.
When the Memorial Stadium gates
opened at 11 a.m. Saturday, navy blue
and gold Cal supporters streamed to one
end of the bleachers while the white and
red Stanford faithful congregated in the
another. So eager were fans for the 97th
Big Game to begin that virtually every
one of the 75,662 seats filled 15 minutes
before the opening 12:30 p.m. kickoff.
No Pacific 10 Conference champi
onships and bowl game berths hung in
the balance. The Cardinal (3-6-1, 2-5 in
the Pac-10) and the Bears (3-7, 2-5) were
not in the midst of great (or even decent)
seasons. But these two teams didn't care.
And neither did their fans.
"Look, this is BIG GAME!" said a man
in his 30's who decked himself out in a
cardinal red sweatshirt and an equally
magnificent pair of red sweatpants. "I

went to Stanford and my brother went to
Cal. But today I really can't consider him
my brother." He pointed across the field
to the Cal alumni section. "He's just
another Weenie."
And with that, this rivalry of rivalries,
this game of games, was captured in its
purest form. "All those who say that
Stanford has no school spirit obviously
hasn't been to Big Game, especially over
here [at Cal]," another crazed Cardinal
fan said. "You really get pumped up
when you enter their stadium and yell
for your team."
Not that the Stanford supporters
found themselves vastly outnumbered.
In fact, Cal fans only accounted for 60
percent of the 75,662 total in the stands.
"That's what makes this game so spe
cial," said a Cal rooter caught tailgating
with Stanford fans before the game.
"Both schools get to be seen and heard.
Loudly too."
The verbal fisticuffs between the two
schools began 30 minutes before game
time. The Golden Bear Marching Band
drew hisses and boos from Stanford stu
dents who, in that somewhat quirky tra
dition, rattled their keys as a sign of dis
taste. The Stanford Band next fell victim
to catcalls as Cal students began chant

ing at the top of their lungs, trying to
drown out the sounds of Stanford's non
traditional musicians.
Student excitement continued as the
battle on the field began. Cardinal fans'
consternation over the early 14-0 Bear
lead was replaced by joyous relief as
Stanford evened the score at 17-17 by the
half.
Halftime brought a period of rest and
recovery for the players, but not the
Stanford students, who began throwing
various fruits in the direction of the Cal
band during their performance. Security
personnel who tried to stop the
onslaught of oranges, bananas, pears,
limes and even water balloons had to
stay on guard to make sure they them
selves weren't hit.
After five minutes of dodging fruits
and a few more to clear the food off the
playing surface, the stadium police
thought they had the best of the Stan
ford student body as the teams returned
to the field for the second half. How
many Big Games had these guys been to?
After Stanford succumbed to the
Bears in a nail-biting although mistake
prone 24-23 thriller, Cal fans charged
