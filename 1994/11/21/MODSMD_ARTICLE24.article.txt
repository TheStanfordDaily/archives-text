# 'I thought it was going to be 200-0...’
## Shaky first two minutes dug Cardinal an instant hole 
### Andrew Blachman Editorial staff 
Stanford fans who got stuck in traffic around Memorial
Stadium in Berkeley and arrived a few minutes late to Satur
day's Big Game must have wondered what hit them.
The Cardinal, with consecutive turnovers on its first two
possessions, spotted the Golden Bears a quick 14-0 lead after
just two minutes, 14 seconds had gone by in the first period.
California's first two offensive plays — both good for touch
downs — led most of the 75,662 fans in attendance to prepare
themselves for a rout.
"I thought it was going to be 200-0," said Stanford defen
sive coordinator Fred vonAppen. "We apparently were ner
vous early."
After receiving the opening kickoff at the Cardinal's own
38, running back Anthony Bookman got caught in the back
field on a sweep and was hauled down for a six-yard loss.
Sophomore Scott Frost — making just his second career start
as quarterback — was immediately forced to pass.
Frost looked for Justin Armour over the middle but the
pass was deflected high, landing in the hands of Bears'
defender Matt Clizbe for an interception. It was the second
time in as many games that Frost had his first pass picked
off.
"I think I'm going to start throwing my first pass of the
game underhanded or something," Frost said after the game.
"That way it won't get intercepted by being tipped up."
Just seven seconds after California took over on the Stan
ford 41-yard line, the Bears managed to put seven points on
the board. Tyrone Edwards took the pitch over the right side
of the line and scampered virtually untouched into the end
zone to immediately land the Cardinal in the hole.
The Bears' Ryan Longwell — probably the busiest man on
the field at this point — kicked off, and the Cardinal once
again started with the ball at its own 18.
After Frost's first completion of the game — a five-yard
toss to fullback Ethan Allen — Bookman carried the ball for
his second time of the day. On this play, the true freshman
fumbled and Cal's Andy Jacobs scooped it up and returned
the ball to the Cardinal's 16-yard line.
Through these two series it actually appeared as if the
Stanford running game could post worse numbers than it did
a year ago. In last year's Big Game loss, Cardinal rushers
combined for a loss of five yards on 18 carries. And after two
plays on Saturday, Stanford had -13 yards on the ground.

"At the beginning we just weren't clicking," Bookman
said. "We just had little mental breakdowns that cost us
touchdowns. In this type of game, those little things add up,
and it did — we lost by one point. Those things come back to
haunt you."
California somehow found a way to make its second drive
of the game even shorter than their its one, putting seven
points on the board in just five seconds.
When Cal quarterback Pat Barnes hit wide receiver
Iheanyi Uwaezuoke in the end zone for a 16-yard touchdown,
it appeared as if the 97th version of the Big Game might turn
into a massacre.
But, thanks in large part to two 15-yard penalties against
California, Stanford was able to respond with a scoring drive

of its own and eventually fought
back in a game marred by penal
ties and turnovers.
Stanford and California com
bined for 11 fumbles — eight by
the Cardinal — and four intercep
tions in what became a battle of
blunders. In addition, yellow flags
seemed to be raining from the
sky, as the Cardinal and Bears
combined for over 200 yards in
penalties — many of which helped
sustain opposing drives.
The Cardinal actually had a
chance to win late in the game
and proved to itself and its oppo
nents that it would not wilt under
pressure. But the nightmare of
the first two and a half minutes of
play will not soon be forgotten.
"If we can ever come out of the
chute and quit tripping," Frost
wondered, "maybe we'll win a lot
of games."
