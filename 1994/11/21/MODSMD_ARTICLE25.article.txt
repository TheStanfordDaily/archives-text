# Game adds little to Cardinal resume
## More disappointing stats to fill the record books 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
Over the weekend, the Bears and the
Cardinal combined for 11 fumbles, two
missed field goals, a blown trick play on
another field goal, four interceptions,
two misguided laterals and 21 penalties
for 204 yards.
Stanford rookie quarterback Scott
Frost completed just 11 of 28 attempts
for 148 yards, one touchdown and two
interceptions. Pat Barnes fared no bet
ter for Cal, connecting on only 13 of 21
for 127 yards, one touchdown and two
interceptions.
Despite this highlight reel filled with
fundamental football "don'ts," the
game came down to the wire with yet
another botched play and the Cardinal
shuffled home with a disappointing 24-
23 loss.
With three minutes and 30 seconds

remaining in the fourth quarter, Stan
ford had placed itself in position to win
when Barnes fumbled his second snap
of the day and Cardinal defensive end
Pete Swanson pounced on the loose ball
at the Bears' 22-yard line.
Trailing 24-17 at the time, Frost
hooked up with Justin Armour for a 21-
yard gain, giving the senior 1,092 career
yards as a wide receiver on the Farm.
Senior Ethan Allen then completed the
two-play drive with a one-yard run on
third-and-goal, setting up the ensuing
two-point non-conversion.
Given the order to throw, Frost shot
out of the pocket and rolled right, look
ing for his favorite receiver Armour,
who faced double coverage on the play.
Frost then scrambled left and spot
ted senior tight end Tony Cline deep in
the endzone. He lofted a pass up to
Cline, but Cal's free safety Matt Clizbe
batted the ball away well before it

reached Frost's intended receiver.
"Our quarterback is very, very inex
perienced," said head coach Bill Walsh.
"It's the first time he's run that play in
a game."
On top of that, the Golden Bears had
anticipated the pass play from Stanford
and had switched from man-to-man cov
erage to a zone defense after the snap.
"Cal called the perfect defense on the
two-point conversion," Armour said.
"Of all the defenses you could run, that
was the one we didn't want They just
picked it perfect."
All throughout the game Stanford
was trying to catch the Bears by surprise
with the occasional long pass or the con
secutive passing plays, considering Frost
is known primarily as a scrambler and
an option quarterback. That ploy proved
ineffective as Frost's incompletions

mounted and his completions were
negated by fumbles and intercep
tions.
Critics pointed out that Frost
might have found more success
running the fake point-after play,
where he takes the snap and darts
around left end for the conversion.
However, after a failed fake field
goal earlier in the fourth quarter,
Walsh opted for the pass play and
now regrets calling for the two
point conversion in the first place.
"I'd like to have that last call
back," Walsh said, "but that's
what people say when they lose."
After two consecutive dismal
seasons, the Cardinal has landed
itself in the basement with a 3-7-1
record and has added yet another
last-minute defeat to its unimpres
sive resume.
Even Walsh admitted that
"these are troubled days at Stan
ford."
However, regardless of how dis
mal the situation might seem right
now, that last play will only go
down in the record books as
"Fourth quarter, Stanford — Allen
1 yard run (pass failed) at 2:06."
Nothing more. Tomorrow is a
new season.
