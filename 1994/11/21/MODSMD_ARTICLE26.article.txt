# International linkup
## Stanford, Singapore doctors to be connected through 'telemedicine' 
### Jason Waggoner Staff writer 
Singapore is back in the news
again, but this time the discus
sion centers on healing rather
than punishment.
Stanford Health Service (SHS)
signed an international agree
ment with the Asian island last
month to link Stanford and Sin
gapore physicians through
"telemedicine."
Jim Yee, chief information
officer of SHS, and Dr. Gary
Glazer, professor and department
chair at Stanford's Department
of Radiology signed a "memoran
dum of understanding" with two
top doctors of Singapore's Gener
al Hospital in Singapore on Octo
ber 18.
The accord, which takes effect
in the middle of January, allows
physicians to hold face-to-face
video conferences and would
enable Singapore's physicians to
send high-quality magnetic reso
nance images to Stanford for
analysis.
The images will be transmit
ted through existing trans-Pacific
cable links or through satellite
linkups.
The choice between terrestrial
and satellite lines was the result
of the decision to use a "dial-up"
service. The service, which costs
less than a constant dedicated
line, allows physicians to linkup
by monitors when they choose to.
They dial a carrier and are put on
either a terrestrial or satellite
line.

The international project is
based on a program introduced
recently at Stanford which will
allow patients at three communi
ty health centers — Drew Health
Foundation in East Palo Alto,
Lytton Gardens Health Care
Center in Palo Alto and San Jose
Medical Group — to communi
cate with Stanford physicians
without leaving the doctor's
office.
In the same vein, doctors from
Singapore can communicate with
specialists from Stanford to
improve their quality of care and
to provide for better and earlier
diagnoses.
The linkup between SHS and
Singapore was no coincidence,
administrators said.
"For Singapore, affiliation
with a 'world-renowned' institu
tion such as Stanford is highly
prized," said Jana Katz, SHS
product manager. "Also, many
Pacific Rim countries such as
Singapore look to the United
States as a leader in medical tech
nology."
Katz, who has been involved
with the project since its incep
tion, cited the economic stability,
the relatively good communica
tions infrastructure and the fact
that English is spoken as a
national language as major incen
tives for SHS to develop
"telemedicine" with Singapore.
In addition, Katz said that this
link coincides with Stanford's
desire to increase its visibility in
the Pacific Rim.
