# More than 1,500 attend sculpture unveiling in San Jose
## Controversial statue brings protest 
### Crystal Carreon Contributing writer 
Several Stanford students joined hun
dreds of San Jose citizens on Friday to wit
ness the unveiling of the city's controversial
statue of Quetzalcoatl, the chief Toltec and
Aztec god.
Over 1,500 people — Aztec dancers,
protesters, families and students — packed
into downtown San Jose's Plaza de Cesar
Chavez to see the half-million dollar cast
stone statue.
Senior Luz Herrera said the statue can
be seen as a tool to create awareness,
"There are a lot of people here with the
wisdom and knowledge that you cannot find
at the University," she said.
For over two years, the city has fought
against opposition to Robert Graham's
sculpture, said San Jose Vice Mayor Blanca
Alvarado. Nonetheless it continued to draw
fire from right-wing groups that believed
the Quetzalcoatl sculpture to be "demonic."
Chet Gallagher, the national spokesman
for the World in Warfare Christian group,

organized a two-day vigil of prayer and bib
lical readings to "work through this unveil
ing."
Other concerned citizens picketed the
event because they felt that taxpayers' dol
lars were wasted on the $400,000 sculpture.
"Why don't they build a statue of Cesar
Chavez or other Mexican-Americans
instead of Quetzalcoatl who was associated
with bloodshed and murder," said Ken
Ilouen, one of the protesters. "They should
feed the libraries and homeless instead of
the statue," he added.
Junior Imelda Gonzalez said that many
of those protesting should have taken the
time to learn more about the myth of Quet
zalcoatl.
"Quetzalcoatl is not the blood thirsty
image that they think it is — it's the god of
literature and the arts, and the god who
requested that blood sacrifices cease," she
said. "Do they think that there's going to be
people sacrificing others at the base of the
statue, or what? "
Gonzalez said that the statue is not is not
a religious symbol, but a "cultural icon."

"It serves as a symbol that the Latino
population is not a transitory population,
she said. "The statue ... is a symbol that
this population is here to stay. We're repre
sented in the arts."
"When I saw teachers bringing their
classes of second and third grade children
downtown to see the statue, it helps quite a
bit," Valle said. "It helps in establishing a
foundation which will aid in combating
future ignorance."
Tony Burciaga, former Casa Zapata Res
ident Fellow, said that the meaning behind
the event is significant. The return of Quet
zalcoatl represents a "renaissance" and a
"reclaiming of our culture" — the Mexican,
Chicano and Latino culture, he said.
The depiction of Quetzalcoatl as the
Plumed Serpent symbolizes the harmony of
heaven and earth, according to Anthropolo
gy Department Chair Renato Rosaldo.
Rosaldo, who was asked by the city of San
Jose to speak about Quetzalcoatl before its
unveiling, said that the divinity represents
the simultaneous embodiment of creation,
the arts, authority, public order and justice.
