# A 						bloody great victory
## Daily narrowly beats 'Daily' Cal, 24-19 
### Elise Wolfgram Editor in chief 
With a last-second victory 24-19 over The
Daily Californian in flag football Saturday,
The Stanford Daily continued to impress pro
scouts with its run-and-shoot offense and
man-to-man defense.
"I am so proud of my rough-and-ready
staff," I said after The Daily's second consec
utive victory in the annual match. "We are at
the beginning of an era of domination that
will be almost as impressive as that of the
Chicago Bulls."
Although The Daily started out a little
slowly, biased refereeing from the Daily Cal
General Manager helped the Weenies take an
early lead.
Quarterback Frank "Concubine" Kolor
and Taylor "Nice expression" Meritt, Daily
affiliates extraordinaire, led The Daily to its
first touchdown. Meritt grabbed a Kolor pass
and was downed at the 10-yard line. On the

next play, she took Kolor's handoff and tip
toed into the end zone. The Daily missed the
extra point.
As The Daily Cal continued to put up points,
The Daily stayed in contention by scoring a
touchdown on a pass from Kolor to me, nar
rowing the Weenies' lead at halftime to 19-12.
"It was a bloody close game, though not as
exciting as cricket," said stafT writer Jo "Can't
we just leave the ball on the ground" Mar
shall.
The second half became more of a defen
sive battle. Behind the stellar pass rush of
Colleen "I better get another sack" Krueger
and Sarah "Coordination" Katz, the Daily Cal
quarterback often found himself buried under
feminine flesh.
A fabulous Allyson "Nice legs" Mizoguchi
touchdown catch of a tipped pass brought The
Daily within one point with 10 seconds left.
However, a missed extra point sent the Daily
Cal sidelines into a frenzy at their seemingly
ensured victory.

However, a fumbled snap, recovered by
Kolor, gave The Daily the ball back with 5 sec
onds left. Biz Manager Brad "Don't hate me
because I'm beautiful" Shong ran the ball in
for a last-second touchdown and Daily victory.
"I really think my snazzy sunglasses were
the deciding factor in the victory," Frank
"Terminator" Guinan said. "They couldn't
stop looking at them."
The Daily also benefited from the impres
sive play of Azran "Allyson's ringer" Osman-
Rani, Brian "Studly frosh on Rollerblades"
Singer, Michael "I love to lunge" Noren and
lan "Jo's boyfriend" Davies.
"This victory was so amazing, I'm going to
McDonald's to eat a Big Mac Super Value
meal," Managing Editor Sarah "Nice
boyfriend" Nagae said. "That's after some
heavy boozing to really celebrate this
momentous occasion."

"Coordination" Katz contributed to this
report.
