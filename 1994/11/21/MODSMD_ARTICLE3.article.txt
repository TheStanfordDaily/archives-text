# Three arrested at game
## 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
Despite a history of violence following
previous Big Games, Saturday's on-field
celebration by UC-Berkeley fans yielded
little confrontation.
Only three arrests were made in
Memorial Stadium following Cal's 24-23
victory over the Cardinal, according to
Sgt. Howard Hickman of the UC-Berkeley
Police Department.
Charges are only being considered for
one of those arrests, he said.
Arrested were UC-Berkeley students
Gonsalo Garay and Vanessa Martinez.
Garav was released at the scene probably
because the victim did not want to press
charges, Hickman said.
Garay was cited for a UC rules viola
tion, and is now subject to a student con
duct board, he said.
Martinez, however, was cited for bat

tery and released at the scene, Hickman
said. The victims, two Stanford Band
members, did express interest in pressing
charges, he said.
"She slapped away one band member's
hat and punched her three or four times
hard in the face," said Band Manager
Chris Quaintance. "She also hit another
student." Neither Quaintance nor Hick
man would release the names of the vic
tims.
"There was a significant difference [in
the game] two years ago in that the Stan
ford fans and Cal fans made contact on the
field" in that game, Hickman said. "Secu
rity was successful in keeping those two
groups apart in [this] game."
Contrary to previous years, security
was tight enough to prevent any attacks
on the Stanford Band during its pregame
and halftime shows. Guards, in fact, were

posted in the center of the band's
halftime formations.
"lUC-Berkeley fans] didn't
actually appear to be too abra
sive," Quaintance said. He said,
however, that Stanford students
escalated the UC-Berkeley cele
bration by throwing fruit, among
other items, onto the field.
"The problem from a band
manager's perspective was that
the people on the field were aim
ing directly at the band," he said,

referring to the UC-Berkeley stu
dents' response.
But despite the onslaught of
fruit, no related arrests were
made, Hickman said.
Fifteen other Cal students
were cited for UC rules violations
and released for incidents before
and during the game, Hickman
said. In addition, a non-student
was arrested and charged with
trespassing, refusing to leave and
resisting arrest, he said.
"There were probably some
LotherJ people who were detained,
but I don't think there will be
criminal charges pursued on
these people," he said.
