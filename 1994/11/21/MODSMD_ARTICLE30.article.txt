# Missing EV resident may be bridge jumper
## 
### September Trevi√±o Staff writer 
An Escondido Village resident
is missing and police reports indi
cate that he may have jumped off
of the Golden Gate Bridge about
two weeks ago.
According to Stanford Police
Sergeant John McMullen, two
independent witnesses saw a man
who matched the description of the
missing Escondido resident "vault
ing over the side of the bridge."
While police could confirm that
the descriptions matched, they
could not release the individual's
name.
Although the Coast Guard was
unable to recover the body from
the San Francisco Bay, "the pre
sumption is that the [missing!
person did in fact commit sui
cide," said Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer.
Authorities ran a vehicle check
on the car abandoned by the
jumper and found that it matched
the vehicle description of the
missing resident. "It was his car,"
said Niemeyer.
According to Carrie Holmberg,
an Escondido Resident Assistant,
the missing person does live in
the graduate housing complex but

is not a student.
Stanford authorities were
alerted when his roommate called
the police about two weeks ago
and reported him missing. He
also indicated to police his fear
that his roommate might attempt
to commit suicide by jumping off
the bridge.
Stanford Police in turn noti
fied Golden Gate Bridge authori
ties, Niemeyer said.
According to McMullen, how
ever, this was not the first time
the resident's roommate reported
him missing and possibly suicidal.
McMullen said the alleged
jumper told his roommate about
three weeks ago that he was going
up to the bridge.
"He came back on his own the
first time," said McMullen. When
police deputies later questioned
the alleged jumper about the pos
sible suicide attempt, he denied
allegations, McMullen said.
Although witnesses' reports fit
the missing resident's description,
since the body has not been recov
ered authorities "can't be sure" it
was him, said McMullen. Official
ly the resident is still missing.
The roommate of the missing
person would not comment on the
incident.
