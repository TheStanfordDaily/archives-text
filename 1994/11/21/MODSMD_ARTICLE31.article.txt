Three more games to glory.
For the Stanford men's water
polo team, the season now consists
of three games in Long Beach, Calif.,
where the NCAA Championships
will take place this weekend.
The No. 1 Cardinal (24-1) applied
the finishing touches to a stellar reg
ular-season Saturday by defeating
No. 3 California (19-9) 9-7 in the Big
Splash at Berkeley's Spieker Aquat
ics Complex.
In front of a sold-out crowd and
ESPN cameras, the two teams got
off to a slow start, with very little
action taking place in the first quar
ter.
Aside from two near-misses from
in front of the goal by Stanford hole
man Frank Schneider, the first five
minutes of play proved uneventful.
"At the beginning, we were hav

ing some trouble, because all six of
their guys were counterattacking
really hard," said Stanford senior
Wolf Wigo. "It was also a physical
game, so when we were on offense,
everyone was tired."
California posted the first points,
as senior Matt Maclear scored into a
wide-open net after Cardinal goal
tender Jack Bowen attempted to
steal a pass in front.
Stanford answered with a sweep
shot from the hole by sophomore
Brum Wallin one minute later to tie
the score at 1-1.
While the opening frame was not
exactly a made-for-TV display of the
sport, the two perennial powerhous-

es settled down in the second quar
ter. Golden Bear freshman Brent
Albright fired a backhand from the
hole just 21 seconds into the period
to put Cal ahead 2-1.

That lead, the Bear's last, was
extremely short-lived. Ten seconds
later, Schneider, who managed to
place in the right positions through
out the game, scored a backhander
of his own. Less than a minute later,
junior Jeremy Laster put Stanford
up for the first time by nailing a two
pointer, his 16th of the season.
Cal kept pressure on Bowen
throughout the quarter, scoring
twice more to even the game at 4-4.
An ejection foul against Berkeley's
Nick Kittridge led to the final goal of
the half, as junior Dan Hancock
found Wallin open on the post for an
easy point.
Leading by a count of 5-4 enter
ing the second half, the Cardinal
showed why it has been virtually
unbeatable this year, wearing down
the Golden Bears in the transition
and tightening up the defense in the
third quarter.
The result was Stanford outscor
ing Cal 3-0 in the frame to claim an
8-4 lead.
"This year, the third quarter is
ours," coach Dante Dettamanti said.
"The story of our season is great
third quarters. In about half of our
games, we've put teams away in that
period."
Cal's best scoring opportunities
in the third quarter came on two six
on-five advantage situations, but the
Bears missed shots on both
attempts. On the second, a long
rebound recovered by Hancock set
Wigo off on a breakaway which he
converted to give the Cardinal a
four-goal cushion.
"Eventually, we wore them down
and were able to get counters," Wigo
said. "Two of our three goals in the
third quarter were on counterat
tacks."
The craftiness of Wigo, who
anticipated the rebound and started
to fast break, came as no surprise to
Dettamanti.
"Two things Wolf does very well
are draw kickouts and get break
aways," Dettamanti said. "He's a
veteran, he knows when to go."
Wigo drew a pair of ejections Sat
urday as well, as he was both kicked
and punched in the face above the
water, in the referee's view.
"Wolf makes a living on that,"
Dettamanti said. "He draws those
fouls all the time. He might hold [his
man] underwater, but then other
guys retaliate and get caught. That's
just stupidity on [Cal's] part."

While the Cardinal had little
trouble disposing of the Bears, Det
tamanti anticipates a possible
matchup with Cal at the NCAA
tournament.
"Both teams were tired, so the
game was slow paced and sluggish,"

Dettamanti said. "We'll start resting
now, and the pace at NCAAs will be
faster."
For Schneider and Wigo, their
first Big Splash victory also serves as
a confidence boost entering their
final tournament for Stanford.

"I think this win was good for a
lot of the players on the " W«gr>
said. "Now we know for sure that we
are better than Cal. If we had lost,
people would have been unsure —
now we will have confidence no mat
ter who we play fat NCAAs]."
