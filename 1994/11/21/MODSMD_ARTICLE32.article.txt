As Yogi Berra once said, it's
deja vu all over again.
The second-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team ended
its journey through the Pacific 10
Conference portion of its sched
ule the same way the squad
began it — with two victories
against the Washington schools.
In doing so, it won the title of
Pac-10 champion.
On Friday night in Seattle, the
Cardinal (25-1, 17-1 in the Pac
-10) defeated No. 23 Washington
in four games (15-9, 7-15, 15-7,
15-8). After flying to Spokane
and bussing to Pullman, the
team had an easier time with No.
25 Washington State (16-12, 8-
10), beating the Cougars 15-7,
15-6, 15-9. Stanford became the
first team this season to pull off a
sweep in the state of Washing
ton.
The Huskies, an athletic team
with plenty of height, played well
in front of the home crowd.
Despite losing game one, they
battled ferociously behind Angela
Bransom's six kills, a number
equaled by Stanford's Kristin
Folkl.
Washington fed off its play in
game one to take a 7-3 advantage
in the second. The effort was
helped by some miscommunica
tion on the Stanford side of the
net. Cardinal players missed a
number of sets and there was
some confusion over areas of
responsibility during serve recep
tions.
"Our communications broke
down," Folkl said. "When that
happens, it makes fundamental
things difficult to exercise."
After the break, Stanford
recovered from the momentary
lapse of concentration to jump
out to a 10-3 lead in game three.
Juniors Cary Wendell and
Mamie Triefenbach combined
for a deadly set-and-hit duo on a
number of kills, while senior
Anne Wicks and freshman Lisa
Sharpley led the blocking scheme
as the Cardinal took game three.

"[At the break] Don just said
that he knew that we were capa
ble of doing more than we were,
and that really fired us up," Folk!
said.
The Huskies managed to stay
close in game four behind the
tough serving of Dragana Djorde
vic, the conference leader in ser
vice aces. However, at 5-5 the
Cardinal took the lead and
refused to relinquish it after a
long rally which ended with Folkl
setting Triefenbach for a kill.
Stanford pulled ahead 12-5,
but the Huskies tried one last
time to put the brakes on the
Cardinal drive. Washington
secured its seventh point when a
Wicks attack was called out of
bounds. Annoyed with the call,
the senior went up to bat again
and this time came away with the
kill to regain the Stanford pos
session. A few points later, a
Folkl kill sealed the win.
Folkl led the Stanford attack
with 21 kills and a .333 hitting
percentage. Triefenbach (15) and
Wendell (13) also reached double
digits in kills. Defensively,
Sharpley and Wicks led the way
with six and seven total blocks,
respectively. Bransom and
Kymme Vicknair led Washington
with 16 and 13 kills, respectively.
Vicknair also contributed six
blocks to the Husky effort.
Against the Cougars, the Car
dinal quickly ran out to an 8-1
lead, and although WSU man
aged to slow the red and white
charge later in the game by nar
rowing the score to 8-4, the effort
came too late.
Game two saw a variety of
Cardinal faces on the court, as
Shaw gave his key reserves some
floor time to ready them for tour
nament play. Eileen Murfee
made good use of the opportunity
as she pounded down four kills
and countered with four blocks.
The sophomore middle blocker
gave the Cardinal a 7-1 lead
when she won a battle above the
net with a Cougar and found a
hole in the WSU defense.
