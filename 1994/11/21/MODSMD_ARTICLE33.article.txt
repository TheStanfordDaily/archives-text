In a demonstration of its depth and flexi
bility, the Cardinal wrestling team won eight
of its 10 matches in Friday's 34-6 demolish
ing of UC-Davis, its first dual meet of the
year. Only six of the usual starters were able
to compete, yet those athletes who wrestled
made a definite impact.
"I was a little apprehensive because of
missing four starters, but the 10 athletes
really competed with a lot of intensity which
made up for the handicap," said head coach
Chris Horpel.
Of the four athletes filling in for starters,
three won their matches, including a pin by
freshman heavyweight Mark Neglay over
Aggie Jarod Jasso. The pin served as revenge
for Neglay, as Jasso defeated Neglay and
placed third in the heavyweight division last
week at the California Open at Cal State
Fullerton,
Davis took an early 3-0 lead when Aggie
Matt Santos slipped past sophomore 118-
pounder By Pham. But from then on, the
Cardinal dominated the meet, winning five
bouts in a row to put it up 21-3. In those five
matches, the Stanford wrestlers outscored
Davis's wrestlers by an impressive 45-6 mar
gin.
"We were really tough on top, especially
for a team with injuries," said junior co-cap
tain Jimmy Aguirre, who is sidelined with a

neck injury until January.
The run began when junior Matt Cano
(126 pounds) defeated Todd Wong, 15-11, fol
lowed by Ed Medina's 13-2 victory over
Trevor Quirk in the 134-pound division.
Senior co-captain Jay Jackson (142 lbs)
crushed Aggie Beau Weiner 13-1, and 150-
pounder Jack Art man, filling in for junior
Tod Surmon, continued the Davis rout with
a close 4-2 win over Chad Stewart. Sopho
more 161-pounder Ryan Barnes posted his
first pin of the season against his opponent,
Mike Santos, to keep the Cardinal momen
tum rolling.
"Ryan really wrestled well," said Horpel.
"Everybody was just up. I was really
impressed with the way they wrestled."
Aggie Ed LeCara provided a sole glitch in
the Cardinal streak by defeating sophomore
167-pounder Jeff Grant, 15-8. However, that
would be the last bout Stanford lost as junior
Mark Ryzewicz (177 lbs), 190-pounder
sophomore Bryan Vaniman and Neglay
swept the last three matches. Filling in for
injured sophomore Roger Liu, Ryzewicz
defeated Ryan Hutslesf 4-1. Similarly, Vani
man substituted for junior football player
Scott Whitt and came away with a convincing
victory over Aaron Bock, 15-3.
"For the first meet, we did a great job,"
Barnes said. "With two possible Ail-Ameri
cans (juniors Jimmy Aguirre and Tod Sur-

monj out, you're always a little
worried. Everyone stepped up
when they went, on the mat."

Jackson had similar praise for
the team. "If we wrestle like that
for the rest of the season, we'll do
really well," he said. "Everybody
wrestled with a lot of heart; no
one gave up."
According to Horpel, this win
ning dual meet debut brings an
optimistic outlook to the rest of

the season.
"This was a good tune-up for
our next dual [Cal Polo-SLO on
Dec. 31," said Horpel. "I was
proud of the way the two [ath
letes) that lost wrestled and all
the heart they had. I have abso
lutely nothing bad to say about
the meet."
