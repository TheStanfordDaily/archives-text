# 'We need to move very fast and strike very hard'
## ASSU bill fights new fund 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
In a move designed to challenge the University's
new alumni-giving policy, ASSU senators and stu
dent leaders met last night to create an alternate
funding source for campus groups.
The result was a bill — which senators will in
troduce at tomorrow's ASSU Senate meeting — set
ting up what undergraduate senator Steve Russell
called an "umbrella organization" to create and dis
tribute mailing lists for student groups.
"We need to move very fast and strike very
hard," Russell said.
The bill would inform alumni about the Univer
sity's new policy, create a fund-raising organization
for student groups and "let the administration
know we're serious," he said.
In this way, the ASSU would be "not just replac
ing a service, but creating a service that right now
doesn't exist," said undergraduate senator Smeeta
Ramarathnam.
"The benefits to student groups would be incred
ible," added Jon Oram, treasurer of Stanford-in-
Government.
However, the ASSU proposal may itself violate
the University's new policy — a situation which
Russell said would prove interesting because it

would serve as a "test case" of the
administration's enforcement of
the policy.
The new University policy,
which became effective Sept. 1,
mandates that student groups only
solicit funding from alumni who
contributed to their group within
the five years preceding that date.
As these lists will remain static
while numbers of alumni grow,

student groups will have access to fewer donors
each year.
In place of individual solicitations by organiza
tions, the newly created Stanford Fund — adminis
tered by the Development Office — garners alumni
contributions, distributing the money to student
groups at the discretion of the University president
and provost.
If passed by the senate, the bill discussed last
night will authorize a committee of ASSU leaders to
oversee the new service project which will create a
computerized alumni mailing list using the Stan
ford Alumni Directory published every five years by
the Alumni Association.
The project, which would cost approximately
