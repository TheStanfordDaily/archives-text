# 'We need to move very fast and strike very hard'
## ASSU bill fights new fund 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
In a move designed to challenge the University's
new alumni-giving policy, ASSU senators and stu
dent leaders met last night to create an alternate
funding source for campus groups.
The result was a bill — which senators will in
troduce at tomorrow's ASSU Senate meeting — set
ting up what undergraduate senator Steve Russell
called an "umbrella organization" to create and dis
tribute mailing lists for student groups.
"We need to move very fast and strike very
hard," Russell said.
The bill would inform alumni about the Univer
sity's new policy, create a fund-raising organization
for student groups and "let the administration
know we're serious," he said.
In this way, the ASSU would be "not just replac
ing a service, but creating a service that right now
doesn't exist," said undergraduate senator Smeeta
Ramarathnam.
"The benefits to student groups would be incred
ible," added Jon Oram, treasurer of Stanford-in-
Government.
However, the ASSU proposal may itself violate
the University's new policy — a situation which
Russell said would prove interesting because it

would serve as a "test case" of the
administration's enforcement of
the policy.
The new University policy,
which became effective Sept. 1,
mandates that student groups only
solicit funding from alumni who
contributed to their group within
the five years preceding that date.
As these lists will remain static
while numbers of alumni grow,

student groups will have access to fewer donors
each year.
In place of individual solicitations by organiza
tions, the newly created Stanford Fund — adminis
tered by the Development Office — garners alumni
contributions, distributing the money to student
groups at the discretion of the University president
and provost.
If passed by the senate, the bill discussed last
night will authorize a committee of ASSU leaders to
oversee the new service project which will create a
computerized alumni mailing list using the Stan
ford Alumni Directory published every five years by
the Alumni Association.
The project, which would cost approximately


Russell
$15,000 for start-up capital,
would then send an initial mail
ing to 20,000 alumni containing
details on the project itself along
with a description of the new
University policy and a survey,
Russell said.
Using the results of the survey
— which would include the kinds
of groups each alumnus would
like to support — the ASSU could
sell specific lists to individual
groups.
In this way, a political student
organization, for example, could
buy a mailing list which includes
all alumni interested in campus
political issues.
"This would be a serious fund
raising mechanism," Russell said.
"I'm surprised the ASSU didn't
get involved in fund raising previ
ously. . . . It's something the

ASSU has been talking about for
a long time."
Russell added that the project
could supply information to stu
dent groups about how best to
fund-raise. "The incentive (to
teach groups] just isn't there for
the Development Office," he said.
The bill would also mandate
distribution of a mailing to all
graduating seniors, encouraging
them to specify which student
group they would like their dona
tion to support if they give money
to the University's Development
Office. Even under the new poli
cy, donors can still "restrict"
their own funds in this way.
Russell admitted that the
ASSU may be directly violating
the University's policy by imple
menting the bill if it passes.
However, he said he believes it
will be difficult for the adminis
tration to respond. "I'd love to
see them try to enforce the policy
and bring the senate up on a Fun
damental Standard violation," he

said. "Right now, it's just a cloud
hanging over our heads."
Russell added that he believes
the ASSU can "probably do a bet
ter job right now than the Devel
opment Office."
SIG Chair Susie Thomas
agreed that the project can
replace the University's solicita
tion programs to some extent but
that the ASSU should concen
trate on smaller donations.
"If we own our own list as the
students," the University is in
trouble, she said.
Council of Presidents member
Vanessa Alvarado said at the
meeting that the COP will likely
support measures which oppose
the new University policy.
"We've talked about it quite a bit
in our COP meetings," she said.
Despite support for the bill,
Russell conceded that getting it
past the senate may not be an
easy matter.
"If it doesn't pass it's not
because the senate doesn't sup

port the bill, but because of fear
of ramifications," Russell said,
adding that he believes the senate
to be "more courageous than
that."
In addition, Ramarathnam
said she is unsure about whether
the senate will be willing to spend
such a large sum of money. "Last
week we were arguing about
$800," she said, adding that this
bill might generate much more
controversy.
"I think people could lose sight
of the goal because it is so expen
sive," she said.
However, Russell said that
because the mailing lists would
be such a "powerful investment,"
the senate will likely support the
bill.
"This is one of the best ways in
which students can respond to
the giving policy," he said. "We
have to protect the rights of stu
dent organizations to tap into
sources of funding beyond the
University itself."

in our COP meetings," she said.
Despite support for the bill,
Russell conceded that getting it
past the senate may not be an
easy matter.
"If it doesn't pass it's not
because the senate doesn't sup

port the bill, but because of fear
of ramifications," Russell said,
adding that he believes the senate
to be "more courageous than
that."
In addition, Ramarathnam
said she is unsure about whether
the senate will be willing to spend
such a large sum of money. "Last
week we were arguing about
$800," she said, adding that this
bill might generate much more
controversy.
"I think people could lose sight
of the goal because it is so expen
sive," she said.
However, Russell said that
because the mailing lists would
be such a "powerful investment,"
the senate will likely support the
bill.
"This is one of the best ways in
which students can respond to
the giving policy," he said. "We
have to protect the rights of stu
dent organizations to tap into
sources of funding beyond the
University itself."
In a move designed to challenge the University's
new alumni-giving policy, ASSU senators and stu
dent leaders met last night to create an alternate
funding source for campus groups.
The result was a bill — which senators will in
troduce at tomorrow's ASSU Senate meeting — set
ting up what undergraduate senator Steve Russell
called an "umbrella organization" to create and dis
tribute mailing lists for student groups.
"We need to move very fast and strike very
hard," Russell said.
The bill would inform alumni about the Univer
sity's new policy, create a fund-raising organization
for student groups and "let the administration
know we're serious," he said.
In this way, the ASSU would be "not just replac
ing a service, but creating a service that right now
doesn't exist," said undergraduate senator Smeeta
Ramarathnam.
"The benefits to student groups would be incred
ible," added Jon Oram, treasurer of Stanford-in-
Government.
However, the ASSU proposal may itself violate
the University's new policy — a situation which
Russell said would prove interesting because it

would serve as a "test case" of the
administration's enforcement of
the policy.
The new University policy,
which became effective Sept. 1,
mandates that student groups only
solicit funding from alumni who
contributed to their group within
the five years preceding that date.
As these lists will remain static
while numbers of alumni grow,

student groups will have access to fewer donors
each year.
In place of individual solicitations by organiza
tions, the newly created Stanford Fund — adminis
tered by the Development Office — garners alumni
contributions, distributing the money to student
groups at the discretion of the University president
and provost.
If passed by the senate, the bill discussed last
night will authorize a committee of ASSU leaders to
oversee the new service project which will create a
computerized alumni mailing list using the Stan
ford Alumni Directory published every five years by
the Alumni Association.
The project, which would cost approximately


Russell
$15,000 for start-up capital,
would then send an initial mail
ing to 20,000 alumni containing
details on the project itself along
with a description of the new
University policy and a survey,
Russell said.
Using the results of the survey
— which would include the kinds
of groups each alumnus would
like to support — the ASSU could
sell specific lists to individual
groups.
In this way, a political student
organization, for example, could
buy a mailing list which includes
all alumni interested in campus
political issues.
"This would be a serious fund
raising mechanism," Russell said.
"I'm surprised the ASSU didn't
get involved in fund raising previ
ously. . . . It's something the

ASSU has been talking about for
a long time."
Russell added that the project
could supply information to stu
dent groups about how best to
fund-raise. "The incentive (to
teach groups] just isn't there for
the Development Office," he said.
The bill would also mandate
distribution of a mailing to all
graduating seniors, encouraging
them to specify which student
group they would like their dona
tion to support if they give money
to the University's Development
Office. Even under the new poli
cy, donors can still "restrict"
their own funds in this way.
Russell admitted that the
ASSU may be directly violating
the University's policy by imple
menting the bill if it passes.
However, he said he believes it
will be difficult for the adminis
tration to respond. "I'd love to
see them try to enforce the policy
and bring the senate up on a Fun
damental Standard violation," he

said. "Right now, it's just a cloud
hanging over our heads."
Russell added that he believes
the ASSU can "probably do a bet
ter job right now than the Devel
opment Office."
SIG Chair Susie Thomas
agreed that the project can
replace the University's solicita
tion programs to some extent but
that the ASSU should concen
trate on smaller donations.
"If we own our own list as the
students," the University is in
trouble, she said.
Council of Presidents member
Vanessa Alvarado said at the
meeting that the COP will likely
support measures which oppose
the new University policy.
"We've talked about it quite a bit
in our COP meetings," she said.
Despite support for the bill,
Russell conceded that getting it
past the senate may not be an
easy matter.
"If it doesn't pass it's not
