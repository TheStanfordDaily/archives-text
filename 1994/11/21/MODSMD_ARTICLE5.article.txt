As Stanford battled Cal in the
Big Game on Saturday, hundreds
of protesters — including Stan
ford students — marched into
downtown Palo Alto to fight
Proposition 187.
"We are here, and we're not
leaving, and if you take us out we
will come back," the protesters

chanted in Spanish as they
marched from the Stanford Shop
ping Center, down El Camino Real
and University Avenue to the Palo
Alto City Hall.
The midday march and rally,
organized by Enfoque Latino
(Latino Focus) brought together
approximately 250 activists from
the South Bay area.
The protesters included Stan
ford students, high school stu

dents, teachers and families from
the area, according to Alberto Gar
cia, a local attorney and one of the
protest organizers.
The main speaker at the
protest rally was Tony Burciaga,
Chicano activist, poet and mural
ist. Burciaga is also a former Casa
Zapata resident fellow at Stan
ford.
