# Hundreds protest 187 in Palo Alto
## 
### Soumya V. Raman Hudson Sangree 
As Stanford battled Cal in the
Big Game on Saturday, hundreds
of protesters — including Stan
ford students — marched into
downtown Palo Alto to fight
Proposition 187.
"We are here, and we're not
leaving, and if you take us out we
will come back," the protesters

chanted in Spanish as they
marched from the Stanford Shop
ping Center, down El Camino Real
and University Avenue to the Palo
Alto City Hall.
The midday march and rally,
organized by Enfoque Latino
(Latino Focus) brought together
approximately 250 activists from
the South Bay area.
The protesters included Stan
ford students, high school stu

dents, teachers and families from
the area, according to Alberto Gar
cia, a local attorney and one of the
protest organizers.
The main speaker at the
protest rally was Tony Burciaga,
Chicano activist, poet and mural
ist. Burciaga is also a former Casa
Zapata resident fellow at Stan
ford.
Burciaga read several of his
poems addressing the identity
and rights of Mexican Americans
and the problem that they have
had in finding their place in this
country.
"Proposition 187 is a victory in
an ironic way," said Burciaga. He
said he believes that the proposi
tion is a recognition of the grow
ing power of the Latino communi
ty and the fear that it inspires
among non-Latinos.
Stanford students from
MEChA, a campus Chicano / Lati
no activist group, also participat
ed in the rally. "Students of Stan
ford University are going to work
diligently against Proposition
187," said MEChA Co-Chair

Felipe Barragan, addressing the
crowd in front of city hall.
However, not many Stanford
students attended the rally, possi
bly because of the Big Game, Bar
ragan said.
High school students played a
pivotal role in organizing the
rally, Garcia said. It brought
together student activist groups
from various high schools in the
area, he said.
"It has really politicized high
school students," said Lisa Mal
donado, a protest organizer and
field representative of the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union.
Amador Garcia, a student
organizer and freshman at Menlo-
Atherton High School, agreed
that the measure "is getting to
the younger people and revitaliz
ing us to get together and fix our
government."
"The anti-immigrant atmo

sphere in California is really
heinous," said Eric Steadman, a
Stanford graduate student who
recently moved from Washington,
DC.
Steadman was one of the few
Caucasian protesters.
"We want to let society know
that this is not over," said Quinti
la Pulido, a protester who was
there with seven of her family
members.
Protesters said they believe
there is still reason to fight, even
though the measure has been
approved by California voters. A
major purpose of the protest was
to consolidate the efforts of vari
ous groups from the South Bay
that have been battling Proposi
tion 187, Alberto Garcia said.
Organizers also sought to gar
ner support from outside the Lati
no community, Amador Garcia
said.

Another purpose of this
protest is to unify the communi
ty to act in the event that the
courts uphold all or part of the
proposition, said Juliette Stead
man, a protester and Stanford
Law graduate who works in East
Palo Alto.
The fate of Proposition 187 is
still uncertain as it works its way
through the courts, she said.
Some protesters said they are
certain that it will be over
turned. In the meantime, they
want to show their unity and dis
pleasure with the measure. Oth
ers worry that the courts may
not overturn the measure or
that they will overturn only cer
tain parts such as the denial of
education to children of illegal
immigrants.
Protesters were upset about
the effects of Proposition 187 that
are already visible.

Many felt that 187 tended to
criminalize the Latino communi
ty. "We're not criminals," said
Pulido. "We have the right to
learn, the right to earn a living
and to have a good life."
She said that the Latino com
munity feels that the measure
will subject all Latinos to suspi
cion. "187: Suspicion is unconsti
tutional," read one sign that
protesters carried. "No person is
illegal," said another.
Protesters were concerned
about the negative impact that
Proposition 187 is already having
on students.
"Children feel subhuman now.
They feel that people are taking
away their rights," said Yolanda
Padilla, a secretary in the Red
wood City schools.
"The safety that was once felt
in the school is not there any
more," said Gloria Muldanado,

president of the teacher's union
in Redwood City.
Illegal immigrants are scared
to send their children to school
and do not apply for benefits such
as subsidized school meal pro
grams, Muldanado said.
"Hundreds of years of histo
ry, culture, and language can
not be legislated away," said
Lisa Maldonado, in keeping
with the protest rally's histori
cal theme.
Jose Montoya, a professor of
art at California State University
at Sacramento, also spoke at the
rally. He blamed the federal gov
ernment, especially Ronald Rea
gan and Oliver North, for
oppressing Mexican-Americans.
Juliette Steadman said she
feels that the measure had posi
tive effects. "Ironically, it has
brought the Hispanic community
together," she said.

ty. "We're not criminals," said
Pulido. "We have the right to
learn, the right to earn a living
and to have a good life."
She said that the Latino com
munity feels that the measure
will subject all Latinos to suspi
cion. "187: Suspicion is unconsti
tutional," read one sign that
protesters carried. "No person is
illegal," said another.
Protesters were concerned
about the negative impact that
Proposition 187 is already having
on students.
"Children feel subhuman now.
They feel that people are taking
away their rights," said Yolanda
Padilla, a secretary in the Red
wood City schools.
"The safety that was once felt
in the school is not there any
more," said Gloria Muldanado,

president of the teacher's union
in Redwood City.
Illegal immigrants are scared
to send their children to school
and do not apply for benefits such
as subsidized school meal pro
grams, Muldanado said.
"Hundreds of years of histo
ry, culture, and language can
not be legislated away," said
Lisa Maldonado, in keeping
with the protest rally's histori
cal theme.
Jose Montoya, a professor of
art at California State University
at Sacramento, also spoke at the
rally. He blamed the federal gov
ernment, especially Ronald Rea
gan and Oliver North, for
oppressing Mexican-Americans.
Juliette Steadman said she
feels that the measure had posi
tive effects. "Ironically, it has
brought the Hispanic community
together," she said.
As Stanford battled Cal in the
Big Game on Saturday, hundreds
of protesters — including Stan
ford students — marched into
downtown Palo Alto to fight
Proposition 187.
"We are here, and we're not
leaving, and if you take us out we
will come back," the protesters

chanted in Spanish as they
marched from the Stanford Shop
ping Center, down El Camino Real
and University Avenue to the Palo
Alto City Hall.
The midday march and rally,
organized by Enfoque Latino
(Latino Focus) brought together
approximately 250 activists from
the South Bay area.
The protesters included Stan
ford students, high school stu

dents, teachers and families from
the area, according to Alberto Gar
cia, a local attorney and one of the
protest organizers.
The main speaker at the
protest rally was Tony Burciaga,
Chicano activist, poet and mural
ist. Burciaga is also a former Casa
Zapata resident fellow at Stan
ford.
Burciaga read several of his
poems addressing the identity
and rights of Mexican Americans
and the problem that they have
had in finding their place in this
country.
"Proposition 187 is a victory in
an ironic way," said Burciaga. He
said he believes that the proposi
tion is a recognition of the grow
ing power of the Latino communi
ty and the fear that it inspires
among non-Latinos.
Stanford students from
MEChA, a campus Chicano / Lati
no activist group, also participat
ed in the rally. "Students of Stan
ford University are going to work
diligently against Proposition
187," said MEChA Co-Chair

Felipe Barragan, addressing the
crowd in front of city hall.
However, not many Stanford
students attended the rally, possi
bly because of the Big Game, Bar
ragan said.
High school students played a
pivotal role in organizing the
rally, Garcia said. It brought
together student activist groups
from various high schools in the
area, he said.
"It has really politicized high
school students," said Lisa Mal
donado, a protest organizer and
field representative of the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union.
Amador Garcia, a student
organizer and freshman at Menlo-
Atherton High School, agreed
that the measure "is getting to
the younger people and revitaliz
ing us to get together and fix our
government."
"The anti-immigrant atmo

sphere in California is really
heinous," said Eric Steadman, a
Stanford graduate student who
recently moved from Washington,
DC.
Steadman was one of the few
Caucasian protesters.
"We want to let society know
that this is not over," said Quinti
la Pulido, a protester who was
there with seven of her family
members.
Protesters said they believe
there is still reason to fight, even
though the measure has been
approved by California voters. A
major purpose of the protest was
to consolidate the efforts of vari
ous groups from the South Bay
that have been battling Proposi
tion 187, Alberto Garcia said.
Organizers also sought to gar
ner support from outside the Lati
no community, Amador Garcia
said.

Another purpose of this
protest is to unify the communi
ty to act in the event that the
courts uphold all or part of the
proposition, said Juliette Stead
man, a protester and Stanford
Law graduate who works in East
Palo Alto.
The fate of Proposition 187 is
still uncertain as it works its way
through the courts, she said.
Some protesters said they are
certain that it will be over
turned. In the meantime, they
want to show their unity and dis
pleasure with the measure. Oth
ers worry that the courts may
not overturn the measure or
that they will overturn only cer
tain parts such as the denial of
education to children of illegal
immigrants.
Protesters were upset about
the effects of Proposition 187 that
are already visible.

Many felt that 187 tended to
criminalize the Latino communi
ty. "We're not criminals," said
Pulido. "We have the right to
learn, the right to earn a living
and to have a good life."
She said that the Latino com
munity feels that the measure
will subject all Latinos to suspi
