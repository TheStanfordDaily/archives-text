# Vegetarian author denounces meat

Do you want to save the world?
If your answer is yes, you
should start by listening to what
your conscience tells you and be
coming a vegetarian if you aren't
one already, activist John Robbins
told a crowd of 300 at Kresge Au
ditorium yesterday.
Vegetarianism and reducing
human impact on the environment
were the main themes of an ad
dress given by Robbins, the author

of "Diet for a New America"and
founder of the Earth Save Founda
tion. The event was sponsored by
the Stanford Humanist Society.
In his speech, Robbins tried to
deliver an inspirational message
of hope and a call to action to right
the wrongs humans have done to
the Earth. Robbins also acknowl
edged the shortcomings in mod
ern society.
"The prevailing cultural para
digm defines success — the goal of
life — as the ability to acquire and
consume resources," Robbins

said. "But there is another kind of
success that many of us feel — the
ability to recognize the possibility
of good and beauty and truth in
ourselves and others and bring it
forward."
"All of our life choices repre
sent statements. Do those state
ments represent us well, or are we
living in disharmony with the
forces of our being? " Robbins
asked. "Are we creating the world
we would like to create? "
Those in our society who eat
meat, for example, are making
"food choices which are contrary to
our inner purpose," Robbins said.
"Any sensible person would be
appalled" by the conditions to
which animals are subjected in
"factory farms."
"The view that many of us have
of animals has been corrupted by
industry," Robbins said. He cited a
McDonald's ad shown during Sat
urday morning cartoons depicting
hamburgers growing in hamburg
er patches as an example of a
"deliberate marketing strategy" to
"keep kids from thinking ham
burgers are ground up cows,
because kids have a natural empa
thy for animals."
Even those who are concerned
only with "human problems" and
don't care for animals should
refrain from eating them because
of the numerous health hazards

posed by meat in their diets, Rob
bins said. Hormones and antibi
otics leave residue in animal flesh
which are pai ticularly "poisonous"
to humans, he added.
Vegetarians live eight years
longer than meat-eaters on aver
age and are much less susceptible
to heart disease, cancer, diabetes
and most other degenerative dis
eases, Robbins said.
And perhaps more important
than lengthening one's life,
refraining from eating meat
improves quality of life, Robbins
said. "Those of us who choose
foods honoring our essential
selves" create a positive living
experience for ourselves, he
added.
The risk of heart attacks — the
leading cause of death in America
— can be reduced by eliminating
meat from our diets, Robbins said.
When autopsies are performed
on heart attack victims, doctors
usually find a great deal of fatty
tissue in the coronary artery, he
said. Inevitably the reason for
death is proclaimed tr an excess

of saturated fats and cholesterol in
the victim's diet.
Robbins said that "75 percent of
the saturated fat in our diet comes
from animal fat, and 100 percent
of cholesterol comes from animal
products."
While "something is definitely
occurring that is of paramount
importance," you won't hear about
this trend in the media, which
"serves a corporate agenda," Rob
bins said.
"If you want to see real news, go
on a media fast," he said. "Stop
watching your TV, or get rid of it,
and stop reading the paper. Listen
to your own heart, and to the
hearts and souls of the people in
your circle. That's the real news."
Our food choices can directly
improve the quality of our environ
ment, Robbins said.
It takes 39 times more energy to
produce protein from beef than to
produce the same amount of pro
tein from soybeans, he said.
A Cornell study showed that an
acre of trees is spared for every
American who becomes a vegetari

an. These forests provide "more
habitat for animals, purify the air,
and hold the soil in place." They
are a "necessary part of the func
tioning of the biosphere."
The University of California
agricultural extension conducted a
study which showed that it takes
23 gallons of water to grow a
pound of lettuce, and a pound of
California apples requires 49 gal
lons of water.
But the study also found that it
takes 5,240 gallons of water to pro
duce a single pound of beef, Rob
bins said. "You save more water by
not eating one pound of beef than
by not showering for a year."
Robbins concluded his speech
by telling a story in the second per
son. You first walk into an veal
factory, where you see the calves
"chained at the neck so tight that
they can't turn to lick them
selves." From there you go to a
slaughterhouse, "the assembly
line of death," where you see ani
mals in complete terror. Among
those animals are humans, who
"make their living from killing"

and "you see the wall that they
have built around their hearts.
They embody our culture's
denial."
Next you walk into a hospital,
where patients are being treated
for heart disease, cancer, and dia
betes. From there you go to a rain
forest in Brazil, which is teeming
with life, but you smell the smoke
of burning wood and hear the dis
tant hum of chain saws. Next you
hear a baby crying, and you see a
mother holding her child and
singing to him, but she cannot feed
him for she has no food, and he
dies.
You might look up and say,
"God, what have you done? " If he
could answer he might say, "I have
made you, who cares," said Rob
bins.
"There are others like you," he
said. "Find them, join with them,
become a choir."
"Create truth, create meaning,
join with people who do so also,
and maybe you will be astounded
at what we can accomplish togeth
er."
