Do you want to save the world?
If your answer is yes, you
should start by listening to what
your conscience tells you and be
coming a vegetarian if you aren't
one already, activist John Robbins
told a crowd of 300 at Kresge Au
ditorium yesterday.
Vegetarianism and reducing
human impact on the environment
were the main themes of an ad
dress given by Robbins, the author

of "Diet for a New America"and
founder of the Earth Save Founda
tion. The event was sponsored by
the Stanford Humanist Society.
In his speech, Robbins tried to
deliver an inspirational message
of hope and a call to action to right
the wrongs humans have done to
the Earth. Robbins also acknowl
edged the shortcomings in mod
ern society.
"The prevailing cultural para
digm defines success — the goal of
life — as the ability to acquire and
consume resources," Robbins

said. "But there is another kind of
success that many of us feel — the
ability to recognize the possibility
of good and beauty and truth in
ourselves and others and bring it
forward."
"All of our life choices repre
sent statements. Do those state
ments represent us well, or are we
living in disharmony with the
forces of our being? " Robbins
asked. "Are we creating the world
we would like to create? "
