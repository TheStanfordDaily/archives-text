## Arafat tries to diffuse tensions PLO tries to avoid civil war, militants call for violence against Israel 
### 
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP)-
Trying to ease tensions, PLO lead
er Yasser Arafat released 31 Islam
ic militants from jail yesterday,
and Muslim fundamentalist politi
cal leaders vowed to redirect their
anger at Israeli soldiers and set
tlers.
But one armed group of Muslim
radicals threatened civil war unless
the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion chief expelled top Palestinian
police officials and punished oth
ers.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
responded to the threats by send
ing extra troops to the Gaza Strip
to protect Jewish settlements and
to the West Bank to prevent riots.
There were angry statements
by leaders of both the PLO and the
Islamic fundamentalist groups of
Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The two
sides blame each other for Friday's
bloodshed, when Palestinian police
opened fire on rioting worshipers,
killing 13 people and wounding

more than 150.
Only isolated outbreaks of vio
lence occurred yesterday as a
shaky truce held on the ground.
But Hamas' military wing, Izze
dine al-Qassam, said it would
attack officials of Arafat's govern
ment and start a civil war unless
its conditions were met.
In a leaflet distributed in Gaza,
the group demanded Arafat fire
two senior police officials and Jus
tice Minister Freih Abu Medein. It
demanded the release of jailed
Islamic activists and said those
responsible for Friday's bloodshed
must be tried and executed.
Nabil Shaath, the PLO's top
negotiator, said the rioting was the
outgrowth of anger over Rabin's
banning of Palestinians from jobs
in Israel and the failure of interna
tional donors to make good on aid
pledges.
"This Palestinian land has been
under siege and collective punish
ments by the Israelis for weeks,

preventing our workers from
attending their jobs, preventing
our products from being exported,
preventing our fishermen from
going to sea, and this has resulted
in a catastrophe," he said.
"The donors have given us
nothing but a trickle."
Israel imposed the closure on
Gaza after a wave of suicide bomb
ings and other attacks by Islamic
militants that killed 30 Israelis in
the past two months. Rabin has
warned that Palestinian elections
and the expansion of autonomy
would depend on whether the vio
lence continued.
At a Cabinet meeting yesterday,
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres proposed that, to ease the
economic hardship, Israel advance
the PLO $13 million in tax money
collected from Palestinians work
ing in Israel.
Separately, Shaath and Rabin
said every efTort would be made to
preserve the peace process.
