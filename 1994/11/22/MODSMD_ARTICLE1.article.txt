# Task force's package proposal considers separating graduate requests
## Overhaul may eliminate fee refunds 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
Addressing a variety of problems with the
ASSU special-fee system, the Special Fee Refund
Task Force released a report yesterday advocat
ing a series of changes to overhaul the policy.
"It has never been an organized process be
fore," said Senate Chair Nawwar Kasrawi. "I
think this committee has looked at all issues."
The proposed package, called "The Balanced
Funding Deal," aims to create equity between

graduate and undergraduate students in a sim
ple, effective policy.
Major changes include eliminating fee re
funds, capping groups' budget reserves, prohibit
ing religious or partisan groups from applying for
special fees and allowing graduate and under
graduate student communities to vote separately
on each special-fee request.
The proposal will be discussed at tonight's
ASSU Senate meeting and will be submitted for
approval November 29. If passed by two-thirds of
the senate, the package will be submitted to the

students in a January general election where it
must be ratified by two-thirds of the voters.
Kasrawi formed the task force this quarter to
address long-term problems with the special-fee
system highlighted last spring when nearly half
the requested fees failed in the general election —
largely due to low turnout.
Fair Funding's encore?
To address fundamental differences between
the lives of graduate and undergrad
uate students, the report suggests
reviving one portion of the Fair-
Funding Amendment which failed
to pass in last year's spring election.
The proposal would split special
fee votes between the two commu
nities, allowing each population to
decide separately whether to fund a
group. If one community approves a
fee request, it will pay the full fee; if
both communities approve a
request, the fee will be split propor
tionately.
Last year's graduate student fee
refund drive highlighted the split
between the two communities. Grad
uate students, dissatisfied with pay

ing fees they felt mostly benefited
undergraduates, formed the Gradu
ate Student Tea Party to educate stu
dents about the refund process, dra
matically raising refund rates.
While last year's Fair-Funding
Amendment failed to pass, task
force chair and former head of the
Tea Party Karen Seta said previous
reform attempts failed because they
only addressed individual issues
without looking at the changes'
ramifications. In contrast, Seta
said, the new proposal is compre
hensive.
Previously some special-fee
groups were concerned that popula
tions who do not fund a group
should not benefit from it. While
the proposal does not restrict popu
lations from utilizing services, Kas
rawi said, "basically that is some
thing that can be dealt with [byl the

ASSU [and the group] on a case-by
case basis."
However, both communities will
be considered as one for determin
ing funding levels for the Program
Board, Community Service Board
and Publications Board, which
together make up the general fees.
No more refunds
The task force proposes a num
ber of measures to control the ris
ing special fees. These include elim
inating fee refunds, capping budget
reserves and increasing monitoring
of the special-fee request process.
To account for refunded fees, a
buffer is currently added to every
request to protect groups' budgets.
The task force maintains that this
buffer contributes to the rapid rise
of special fees, and that eliminating
refunds (and thereby the buffer)

would decrease this problem.
Furthermore, the task force con
tends that students would take elec
tions more seriously if they only
had one opportunity to vote for a
special fee. "Incentive is very low [at
present] because you can get your
money back in the fall," Seta said.
"People will take this more serious
ly now."
The ban on refunds also led the
task force to prohibit special fees for
primarily religious and partisan
groups, and to end the use of any
special fee funds for such events
sponsored by relatively apolitical
groups — a provision already in
place for general fees.
However, "we don't want groups
to be restricted from the occasional
political or religious event. They
just won't be able to fund these
with special fees," Seta said.

Council of Presidents member
Anietie Ekanem said the ASSU
would decide which groups and
events would not be funded.
Another result of eliminating
refunds — recognized by the task
force — would be the ability for a
few students to pass a fee to be
funded by the whole community.
The new proposal will therefore
retain the constitutional require
ment that a majority, representing
at least 15 percent of the popula
tion, must approve each fee.
Graduate senator Christopher
Hondl said that at present students
abstain from voting on some groups
because there are too many. One
solution is to increase the amount
of money groups can receive from
general fees — from $6,000 to
$8,000 annually — in the hope that
the fund can serve as an alternative

to the special fee.
Seta said many students have
said they want more accountability
of how special fees are spent. Cur
rently, groups submit budgets to
the senate in order to be placed on
the ballot.
Though groups not approved by
the senate will need to collect signa
tures on petitions as in the past, in
the general student election they
must be approved by a supermajor
ity of 60 percent.
In addition, budget reserves will
be capped at the level of one year of
the group's budget, a move the task
force contends will cut down on
frivolous spending done for the sake
of emptying the group's coffers.
Additional leftover funds will be
placed instead in a new buffer fund
and used to reduce future fee
requests.
