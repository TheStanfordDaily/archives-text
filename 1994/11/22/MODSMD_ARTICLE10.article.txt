No drop in aid assured
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton assured Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin yesterday he would ask
Congress to keep U.S. aid at the $3-billion
level and to approve new funding for an
anti-missile defense system.
"We are going to have a very robust
security relationship," Clinton said after
an 80-minute meeting in the Oval Office
that centered on lagging peace talks
between Israel and Syria.
That view was echoed by Sen. Bob
Dole, the next Senate majority leader. "I
would hope and I would guess that at this
time of great tension in the Middle East
where we're trying to achieve peace there
wouldn't be any effort to reduce the level
of aid," Dole said.
Since anv agreement is bound to

involve an Israeli withdrawal on the
strategic Golan Heights, Clinton empha
size that the United States intended "to
stand behind Israel and its security."
Rethinking term limits
WASHINGTON (AP) - House Repub
licans, committed to a first-ever vote on
congressional term limits, are having sec
ond thoughts about limiting their own
stays in Washington.
The man who will be the new House
majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey of
Texas, suggested that public support for
term limits may wane now that the GOP
will control Congress. If Republicans "can
straighten out the House," he said, Amer
icans may not be so enthusiastic about a
constitutional amendment limiting the
time a person may serve in Congress.
