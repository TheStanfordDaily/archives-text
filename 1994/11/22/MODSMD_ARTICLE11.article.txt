## Biggest NATO airstrike ever retaliation for recent Serb attacks

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — In the biggest NATO attack ever,
warplanes from the United States and
three other nations bombed an airbase
and nearby surface-to-air missile site
used by Serbs to terrorize Bosnia.
The raid on the Udbina airbase in
Serb-held Croatia was NATO's seventh
since war broke out in Bosnia in April
1992. It was by far the largest by North
Atlantic Treaty Organization forces in
the alliance's 45-year history.
Previous NATO air strikes have all
been in Bosnia and all involved a small
number of planes against highly limited
Serb targets, such as a single tank. A
statement from the Brussels headquar
ters of NATO said the air raid on the
Udbina airfield from allied bases in Italy
was conducted at the request of the U.N.
peacekeeping force in Bosnia.

Serb planes from the Udbina airbase
bombarded U.N.-designated safe areas in
Bihac, northwest Bosnia, twice last week,
incurring the wrath of U.N. peacekeep
ers, who called for the air attacks.
Adm. Leighton W. Smith, Naples
based commander of NATO forces in
southern Europe, said about 30 recon
naissance and warplanes from the Unit
ed States, Britain, France and the
Netherlands carried out "good hits" on
Übdina's runways, taxiways and on
planes parked nearby.
There were no reports of losses among
allied aircraft and all returned safely to
their bases, Washington officials said.
The airfield attack came the same day
as Serbs, backed by renegade Muslim
forces, attacked government troops
across northwestern Bosnia and U.N.
peacekeepers were targeted in three sep

arate assaults.
Two of the five other U.N.-designated
safe areas — the Bosnian capital of Sara
jevo and the government-held northeast
ern city of Tuzla — also were attacked
today by Bosnian Serbs.
A U.N. spokesman in Zagreb said gov
ernment troops in and around Velika
Kladusa, north of Bihac, were under
attack this morning by Serbs from neigh
boring Croatia and Muslims loyal to
renegade leader Fikret Abdic.
"We and UNPROFOR (U.N. Protec
tion Forces) are not going to tolerate the
use of that field to threaten either
UNPROFOR troops or the safe areas in
Bosnia-Herzegovina," Smith said.
He said it was too soon to tell how suc
cessful the raid was, but "the pilots have
reported, however, that at least some of
them got hits."
