New alumni solicitation
policy would jeopardize
student groups' welfare

THE UNIVERSITY HAS adopt
ed a new policy on alumni solic
itation that severely restricts
student groups' abilities to raise
funds. At stake for the University are
a few tens of thousands of dollars in
alumni gifts. At stake for students,
however, is the very life-blood of stu
dent groups.
The new policy prohibits student
groups from soliciting donations from
alumni other than those who have
donated within the previous five
years. The Development Office will
instead encourage alumni to donate to
the Stanford Fund, whose funds will
be disbursed among departments and
student groups at the discretion of the
president and provost.
The administration claims the new
policy will help protect alumni from
being bombarded with solicitations,
but common sense tells us that few
alumni have yet torn their phones
from the walls — the number of solic
itations they get each year is probably
closer to the single digits than the "zil
lions" University President Gerhard
Casper hyperbolized at a Nov. 9 press
conference.
What the new policy really does is
let the administration siphon free fuel
from the pipeline of alumni support
some student groups have worked
hard to build over the years.
Alumni solicitation is by no means
the only way student groups can raise
funds, but for many student groups it
has proven a crucial source of much
needed revenue. In some cases, alum
ni donations have even helped build
worthy programs like Stanford in
Government's summer fellowships.
Sadly, the groups the new policy will
harm most are those who have taken
the initiative to seek funding from
sources other than ASSU fees.
Leaving the Stanford Fund at the
discretion of the administration while

forbidding groups from expanding
their own alumni solicitation is a dan
gerous arrangement. Granting the
ASSU discretion over a portion of
those funds, an idea that administra
tors and ASSU leaders have also dis
cussed, would be equally problematic.
Under such an arrangment, the
administration or the ASSU could
punish, or even eliminate, a Stanford
Fund-supported group with whom
they were at odds simply by cutting
off its funding At the same time, they
could reward groups who conformed
to their respective visions of the Uni
versity Therefore, the policy would
give the administration and the ASSU
an undue degree of power.
Also, as groups asking for Stanford
Fund grants would have to justify
themselves to a tight-fisted adminis
tration rather than to a few deep
pocketed alumni, the new policy will
make it difficult for small groups to
expand and will make starting up a
new student group an even more
daunting task.
Student leaders have proposed a
guerrilla effort against the new alum
ni-giving policy Under their plan, the
ASSU would maintain its own alum
ni mailing list and make that list
available to student groups. Though
risky the ASSU's go-for-broke pro
posal seems the best available
response to this ugly administration
gambit.
As the ASSU plan pushes the lim
its of the administration's alumni
giving policy, it would likely force the
University to play its hand by enforc
ing or abandoning the policy, possibly
igniting a heated conflict between the
ASSU and the administration. How
ever, it's not too late for the adminis
tration to avert that conflict and reaf
firm its commitment to student life
by taking a gracious step backward
and removing student groups from
the reach of the new alumni-giving
policy.
The administration deserves praise
for trying to increase unrestricted
alumni giving. But the means by
which it is doing so — gagging and
tying student groups — is plain and
simple highway robbery.
