## Do worry, but be happy too 
### 
A FELLOW FIRST-YEAR medical
student recently complained to me
that people at Stanford are too
happy. Strange thing to complain about, I
thought, but I have come to realize the
validity of his remark. At intellectual cen
ters, and at Stanford especially, there is a
temptation and even a pressure to be con
fident find optimistic in the face of fear. In
spite of the social inequalities law stu
dents constantly expose, the environmen
tal destruction well detailed by those in
earth systems and the horrors of war
made plain by history or political science
majors, a general perkiness pervades.
Somehow, students remain resilient.
Regardless of disturbing trends in crime,
unemployment and education, wide
smiles abound campus-wide. Rather than
being depressed, students in related disci
plines seem to exalt in their mental domi
nation of the issues. They can coherently
outline these problems and debate skill
fully about the pros and cons of each.
They formulate resolutions in the form of
10-page term papers, the quality of which
is judged in proportion to the clarity and
elegance of the argument within. When
the weekend comes, the completion of the
task is celebrated with a beer.
I'd like to share such a talent. Unfortu
nately, the issues only seem to get more
complex as I think them through. "Light
en up," is frequent advice from those who
catch me in mid-ponder. As upbeat as I
think I am, others find my ability to twist

every subject into a gnarled knot some
what unhealthy. As calm as I'd like to
appear, my friends often sense some
urgency in my expression.
I can't hide it; I'm genuinely con
cerned. Asked to talk about what's both
ering me, my brow contorts, and then I'm
flushed; I ramble and soon my comments
no longer make much sense, so the listen
er is more worried still. Usually, they
sympathize and tiy to make me feel bet
ter, assuming that I'm looking for a way
out of the maze of arguments I've led
myself into.
Yet I enjoy worrying. Truthfully, pon
dering life, twisting and turning its multi
ple facets into a sticky mess and then lick
ing this goop off my fingers really turns
me on. The more angst I experience over
a particular debate, the more intense the
confusion, the more alive I feel. Ironically,
I'm nervous and uncomfortable with the
simple and straightforward, which is not
only boring but probably more complicat
ed than it appears.
I used to feel like I was all alone in my
twisted mentality, but recently I found
solace in an unexpected place. In the Med
ical Center, the intellectual facade of the
University breaks down. With psychiatric
patients especially, we see the manifesta
tion of an intimidating world, a stressful
environment which knows no escape in
the semantics of term papers. We see an
end to neat solutions, and we are humbled
by what we don't know. Looking into the

patient's eyes, I see distress, fear and con
cern, yet within the dysfunction of such
patients, I also see an understandable
response to the strange and often brutal
world we live in. I respect that response
and am disturbed by the air of composure
which is forced on fellow students.
My connection with the disturbed
patient reflects my own inner turmoil and
confirms its value. I often feel flooded
with upsetting input which I need to con
front. I feel a necessity to embrace it
rather than to shove it aside, and some
times what I see is not pretty. But I take
comfort in an accurate, though disturb
ing, view. Like the patient who is strange
ly relieved by bad news, only because he
or she now knows what must be faced, I
feel empowered by harsh reality. It's
refreshing to spend time with those who,
like me, just want to see it like it is.
I am fortunate that I am able to keep
the craziness of the world in perspective,
a gift that may narrowly separate me
from some psychiatric patients. I encour
age everyone to look around and embrace
the chaos of the world. It will make you
whole, even if it makes you sick.
