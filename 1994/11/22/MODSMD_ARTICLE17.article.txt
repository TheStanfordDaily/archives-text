'Moral high-ground 9 should only be taken on clearer issues

I WAS ANGERED to read in The
Daily last Wednesday (Nov. 16) of a
protest in which a group of Native
American students showed their dis
pleasure with The Stanford Review's
use of the old Stanford Indian mascot
by gathering all the copies of The
Review they could find and tearing
them up in front of University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper's Office.
The purpose of this letter is not to
discuss the appropriateness of The
Review's Indian caricature. However,
before I proceed, I would like to briefly
mention my feelings on the issue. I do
agree that the use of ethnic mascots is
insensitive to members of the ethnic
groups who appear as mascots, and
therefore should be discontinued. How
ever, having said that, I believe that The
Stanford Review's choice to display the
old Stanford Indian mascot in its weekly
publication ranks rather low on the
hierarchy of injustices and unfairnesses
that surround us all. In a Nov. 17 arti
cle, graduate student Lawrence Tovar
was quoted as saying that "the different
nations that make up the indigenous
peoples of America have been grouped
under one stereotype" by The Review's
caricature, and that this "generates a
false stereotype of the Native American
as someone who carries a Tomahawk

and wears grotesque facial expressions."
I believe that the likelihood of the cari
cature displayed in The Review creating
and/or propagating these ignorant
stereotypes — especially in a multicul
tural and educated community such as
this — is small to nil.
Why did the actions of the protesting
students bother me? First, their protest
basically amounted to stealing, destroy
ing property, and attempting to censor a
publication. Of the three, I believe the
latter, while carrying the smallest finan
cial price, is the most dangerous. I
believe that society as a whole, and espe
cially a university, should encourage
free speech, even speech which is
deemed offensive. Censoring views one
does not agree with does not cause them
to go away, but rather causes them to
fester and produce resentment below
the surface. I believe in the wisdom of
Voltaire when he said "I disapprove of
what you say, but I will defend to the
death your right to say it."
Second, I was bothered by Tovar's
statement, "We are also asking other
ethnic groups to remove The Stanford
Review from its racks." The part which
concerns me is the "other ethnic
groups." This implies that as a member
of another ethnic group you SHOULD
agree with the reasoning of the protest;

as a non-ethnic student, you probably
will not. This discourages individuals —
regardless of ethnicity — from coming
to their own decision and course of
action based on personal analysis and
belief, and instead implies that as a
member of an ethnic group on campus
you SHOULD feel and act a certain way.
This type of thinking can easily create a
sort of "us vs. them," "Anglo vs. non-
Anglo" animosity which I believe is
undesirable, and particularly dangerous
in a multicultural society such as ours.
Third, I find this entire incident to be
but one example of a trend in which eth
nic or gender groups on campus claim
the moral high-ground and protest until
they get their way. In this particular
instance, the president of the University
has already said that, although he is not
keen on The Stanford Review's revival
of the Indian mascot, he will not censor
the paper. In a society, not every deci
sion will go your way.
Yes, I believe there are times when,
after making one's case and having an
opposite decision imposed by an authori
ty, the moral high-ground should be
claimed, the answer "no" should not be
accepted and authority should be chal
lenged. But this should be reserved for
serious issues where there is a clear
moral high-ground. I do not believe that

issues such as whether an Indian mas
cot should be allowed to appear on a
newspaper or how much money should
be channeled to ethnic centers in the
midst of budget cuts qualify as such. Yet
protesters on campus often act as if they
are on the moral high-ground and often
seem unwilling to settle for anything
less than 100 percent appeasement,
resorting to hunger strikes, censorship
and other similar tactics. Again, there is
a place for such actions, but I do not
believe that cases such as The Review's
caricature — where there are excellent
arguments to be made for both sides of
the issue — justify such actions. In
cases such as these, compromises should
be accepted.
In summary, although I agree that
The Stanford Review's use of the Stan
ford Indian mascot is insensitive, I
believe that stealing and tearing up
copies of The Review and encouraging
other ethnic groups to do the same was
inappropriate. These actions are a form
of censorship, they discourage individu
als from coming to their own opinions
independent of their ethnicity, and last
ly they discourage the compromises
necessary for us to function as a soci
ety.

cially a university, should encourage
free speech, even speech which is
deemed offensive. Censoring views one
does not agree with does not cause them
to go away, but rather causes them to
fester and produce resentment below
the surface. I believe in the wisdom of
Voltaire when he said "I disapprove of
what you say, but I will defend to the
death your right to say it."
Second, I was bothered by Tovar's
statement, "We are also asking other
ethnic groups to remove The Stanford
Review from its racks." The part which
concerns me is the "other ethnic
groups." This implies that as a member
of another ethnic group you SHOULD
agree with the reasoning of the protest;

as a non-ethnic student, you probably
will not. This discourages individuals —
regardless of ethnicity — from coming
to their own decision and course of
action based on personal analysis and
belief, and instead implies that as a
member of an ethnic group on campus
you SHOULD feel and act a certain way.
This type of thinking can easily create a
sort of "us vs. them," "Anglo vs. non-
Anglo" animosity which I believe is
undesirable, and particularly dangerous
in a multicultural society such as ours.
Third, I find this entire incident to be
but one example of a trend in which eth
nic or gender groups on campus claim
the moral high-ground and protest until
they get their way. In this particular
instance, the president of the University
has already said that, although he is not
keen on The Stanford Review's revival
of the Indian mascot, he will not censor
the paper. In a society, not every deci
sion will go your way.
Yes, I believe there are times when,
after making one's case and having an
opposite decision imposed by an authori
ty, the moral high-ground should be
claimed, the answer "no" should not be
accepted and authority should be chal
lenged. But this should be reserved for
serious issues where there is a clear
moral high-ground. I do not believe that

issues such as whether an Indian mas
cot should be allowed to appear on a
newspaper or how much money should
be channeled to ethnic centers in the
midst of budget cuts qualify as such. Yet
protesters on campus often act as if they
are on the moral high-ground and often
seem unwilling to settle for anything
less than 100 percent appeasement,
resorting to hunger strikes, censorship
and other similar tactics. Again, there is
a place for such actions, but I do not
believe that cases such as The Review's
caricature — where there are excellent
arguments to be made for both sides of
the issue — justify such actions. In
cases such as these, compromises should
be accepted.
In summary, although I agree that
The Stanford Review's use of the Stan
ford Indian mascot is insensitive, I
believe that stealing and tearing up
copies of The Review and encouraging
other ethnic groups to do the same was
inappropriate. These actions are a form
of censorship, they discourage individu
als from coming to their own opinions
independent of their ethnicity, and last
ly they discourage the compromises
necessary for us to function as a soci
ety.
