## Fresh talent plus experience Bigger, better lady hoopsters look to take it all

Returning four starters and
eight letterwinners, the 1994-
95 version of the Cardinal
women's basketball squad has
the experience necessary to
make a serious run for the
national title.

And with the addition of six
new freshmen and the return of
redshirted freshman Vanessa
Nygaard, the fifth ranked Cardi
nal brings the additional advan
tage of eager, fresh legs to the
hardwood of Maples Pavilion.
The recruits
This year's recruiting class

has been called one of the top
two in the country, carrying
along with it lists of national
awards. All six recruits either
achieved AAU All-American or
Kodak High School All-Ameri
can awards. More importantly,
the "fab six" come to Stanford
not only displaying impressive
individual credentials — they
have led their respective high
school teams to a total of 10
state titles.
"I guess we've gone from
famine to feast," said head
coach Tara VanDerveer,
entering her 10th year at
Stanford. "Now at least we're
in the ball game against a Pur
due, a Tennessee or a
Louisiana Tech."
Size and muscle seemed the
ultimate goal for the coaching
staff this offseason, seeing the
difficulties that the Cardinal
had down low with the other
top teams in the country. Now
with 11 players over six feet
tall, VanDerveer's staff has eas
ily accomplished this goal, and
Vanderveer likes its effective
ness thus far.
Stanford's tallest recruit
and the tallest Cardinal
woman player in history at six
feet, seven-inches, Chandra
Benton was named the top
recruit in the country by Dick
Vitale's magazine. Averaging
18.7 points, 9.2 rebounds, 5.0
blocks and 64 percent from the
field, Benton received AAU-
All-American honors for three
consecutive years at Lakeridge
High School in Lake Oswego,
Ore.
VanDerveer likes what Benton
brings to the table. "Chandra is
adding a dimension we've never
had before — a six-seven dimen
sion . .. One thing is for sure, she
will alter our opponents' shots
when she is on the floor."
While Benton brings the
intimidation factor to the court
for Stanford, highly-touted two
sport athlete Kristin Folkl pack
ages the athleticism. Folkl will
fulfill her basketball scholarship
after her successful volleyball
season ends. Throughout four
seasons in high school, Folkl led
her team at St. Joseph's Acade
my in St. Louis to four consecu
tive state titles and a 72-game
winning streak. Folkl's strength
