## Fresh talent plus experience Bigger, better lady hoopsters look to take it all 
### Courtney Mann Emery Chen 
Returning four starters and
eight letterwinners, the 1994-
95 version of the Cardinal
women's basketball squad has
the experience necessary to
make a serious run for the
national title.

And with the addition of six
new freshmen and the return of
redshirted freshman Vanessa
Nygaard, the fifth ranked Cardi
nal brings the additional advan
tage of eager, fresh legs to the
hardwood of Maples Pavilion.
The recruits
This year's recruiting class

has been called one of the top
two in the country, carrying
along with it lists of national
awards. All six recruits either
achieved AAU All-American or
Kodak High School All-Ameri
can awards. More importantly,
the "fab six" come to Stanford
not only displaying impressive
individual credentials — they
have led their respective high
school teams to a total of 10
state titles.
"I guess we've gone from
famine to feast," said head
coach Tara VanDerveer,
entering her 10th year at
Stanford. "Now at least we're
in the ball game against a Pur
due, a Tennessee or a
Louisiana Tech."
Size and muscle seemed the
ultimate goal for the coaching
staff this offseason, seeing the
difficulties that the Cardinal
had down low with the other
top teams in the country. Now
with 11 players over six feet
tall, VanDerveer's staff has eas
ily accomplished this goal, and
Vanderveer likes its effective
ness thus far.
Stanford's tallest recruit
and the tallest Cardinal
woman player in history at six
feet, seven-inches, Chandra
Benton was named the top
recruit in the country by Dick
Vitale's magazine. Averaging
18.7 points, 9.2 rebounds, 5.0
blocks and 64 percent from the
field, Benton received AAU-
All-American honors for three
consecutive years at Lakeridge
High School in Lake Oswego,
Ore.
VanDerveer likes what Benton
brings to the table. "Chandra is
adding a dimension we've never
had before — a six-seven dimen
sion . .. One thing is for sure, she
will alter our opponents' shots
when she is on the floor."
While Benton brings the
intimidation factor to the court
for Stanford, highly-touted two
sport athlete Kristin Folkl pack
ages the athleticism. Folkl will
fulfill her basketball scholarship
after her successful volleyball
season ends. Throughout four
seasons in high school, Folkl led
her team at St. Joseph's Acade
my in St. Louis to four consecu
tive state titles and a 72-game
winning streak. Folkl's strength

lies in her jumping (and dunking)
superiority. Despite her absence
thus far in the season, Folkl likes
what she sees already.
"I expect our team to hold our
own and work real hard," Folkl
said. "Just because of our work
ethic, we'll win a lot of ball games."
The shortest recruit of the year,
six-foot Regan Freuen appears on
the roster as a guard, mainly due to
her outstanding perimeter shoot
ing. The Spokane, Wash., native
who played for Mead High School
possesses the ability to extend the
zone defense with her deadly long
range jumpers, thus opening up the
inside for the low post players.
"Coming here, I've already
learned so much about the game.
The intensity level is so increased
from high school," Freuen said.
"That [the intensity level] and
everything I've learned make it a lot
of fun."
Also learning more everyday is 6-
3 center Naomi Mulitauaopele. Hail
ing from Seattle, Wash., the AAU
Ail-American first picked up a bas
ketball only four years ago yet
emerged as a player with definite
promise at Chief Sealth High School.
"Being practically a rookie to the
sport still, I'm looking forward to
learning a lot about the game, espe
cially from Tara [VanDerveer];
there's no one better to learn from,"
Mulitauaopele said.
At 6-2, Heather Owen will see
time at the power forward spot.
Leading her Moscow High School to
two consecutive state titles in Idaho,
Owen earned Player of the Year
honors twice and All-American hon
ors in a number of different polls.
She brings the versatility of a big,
strong player who can run the floor.
"We are young, but we have the
potential to do real well if we contin
ue to work hard," she said. Owen
saw significant action in the Cardi
nal's only exhibition game against
Tungsram of Hungary, playing for
27 minutes and scoring 11 points.
Stanford's sixth recruit, 6-2
Olympia Scott from St. Bernard
High School in Los Angeles, has a
game that combines size and
strength with quickness. This
blend allows her to match up defen
sively with nearly any position on
the court, run the break in Stan
ford's upbeat transition game, and
rebound both on the offensive and

defensive boards.
The veterans
The size of this year's recruits
will be needed as last year's starting
forward, All Pac-10 Rachel Hem
mer, is out until at least mid-
December. Hemmer, plagued by leg
problems during her junior cam
paign last year, underwent surgery
in April to implant two screws in
her leg. They were taken out in
October, but the healing process has
been slow.
"It's been difficult for her," Van-
Derveer said. "She's been practicing
some, doing drills, but she won't be
ready until at least a few weeks."
The 13.7 ppg and 7.8 rpg Hem
mer contributes will be missed. The
bulk of the scoring load will fall on
the shoulders of senior center Anita
Kaplan. Kaplan, a Naismith Player
of the Year finalist, is considered
one of the nation's top collegiate low
post players.
"I'd say [Kaplan| is the best low
post scorer in the country," Van-
Derveer said. "She has good size
and can go either to her right or to
her left."
Kaplan came into her own dur
ing the final 12 games of last season,
averaging 19.4 points in victories
over top teams. It seemed that every
time she was in the paint she would
score two points with a baby hook.
During prior seasons, the outside
shooters would pop a three point
shot almost at will. With Jennifer
Azzi, Molly Goodenbour and Christy
Hedgepeth, the trio comprised an
integral part of the Cardinal offense.
This year the honor is bestowed on
Bobby Kelsey and Kate Paye.
"Bobby is a really good outside
shooter," VanDerveer said. "And
Kate Paye really improved her shot.
She might not have gotten noticed
because Christy seemed to be taking
all of the shots."
Paye, a senior, won Stanford's
"Best Defensive Player" award last
year. Her contributions often go
unnoticed as she frequently is
placed opposite the best guard or
small forward on the opposing
team. Paye was slowed in the Pur
due game by a sprained ankle that
has not healed completely. Kelsey, a
redshirt junior, posed a consistent
threat from the outside, shooting
44.5 percent from behind the arc.
She also can slash to the basket and
create scoring opportunities.
The squad's two sophomores,
Kate Starbird and Jamila Wideman,
also constitute a significant threat
as they were both named to the all

frosh team last year. Starbird, a
swing player, has a shooter's touch
from the outside as she made exact
ly half of her field goal attempts. In
addition, Starbird ranked as the
Cardinal's second-best free throw
shooter at 83.1 percent.
Wideman started at point guard
all of last season except for two
games in which she was injured. An
all-eveiything coming out of high
school, Wideman stepped into the
starting lineup and averaged 6.1
ppg and 4.5 apg. However, she has
been hampered by a stress fracture
that has its origins in the sprained
ankle she suffered against Washing
ton last year.
Charmin Smith and Tara Har
rington spent their first years as
role players and will continue to see
action as sophomores. Harrington,
a forward, played in every game,
albeit in a different role than she
expected. Her natural position is
small forward, but due to the excess
numbers of small forwards and
shooting guards on the team last
year, she played power forward.
Smith took a key role in the first
two tournament games last year.
With Wideman out, she took over
the point guard role and helped lead
the team to victories over Wiscon
sin-Green Bay and Montana.
Vanessa Nygaard, a redshirt
freshman forward, supplied some
minutes at power forward last sea
son, and she even started in the
exhibition game against an Aus
tralian National Team. However,
the best-laid plans of mice and men
went awry and she tore her anterior
cruciate ligament in her right knee
and was sidelined for the season.
She has made steady progress both
rehabilitating her knee and becom
ing comfortable with playing bas
ketball again.
Putting it all together
Last Saturday night in Jackson,
Tenn., the Cardinal put all the
aspects of its new team and new sea
son together to produce a stunning
62-52 upset over second-ranked
Purdue in the Hall of Fame Classic.
This actually marked Stanford's
second consecutive game against
the Boilermakers, dating back to
last season when Purdue eliminated
the Cardinal from the NCAA tour
nament.
Purdue ousted Stanford last year
essentially due to their overwhelm
ing size, an aspect which Stanford
has gained during the offseason in
the form of its six freshmen
recruits. Stanford utilized this new

size, feeding the ball into Kaplan for
a game-high 22 points. Kaplan in
addition pulled down seven
rebounds.
"They play a physical game, they
really bang," VanDerveer said of
Purdue. "They gave us a lot of prob
lems [last year] with their size. But
now we have a lot more size, and
that makes a huge difference."
The game was marred by
turnovers throughout, with Pur
due racking up a total of 28 while
Stanford committed 19. Van-
Derveer attributed this to its early
season date: "With all the
turnovers, it sure felt like an early
game," she said.
Poor field goal shooting may
have resulted from first game jit
ters as well. Purdue shot a mere
31.6 percent from the field, 25.7
percent from three point range and
only 60.0 percent from the charity
stripe. Stanford shot just 36.1 per
cent from the floor, but made up for
it behind the three point line, hit
ting three of six from downtown
and sinking 71.4 percent from the
free throw line.
Stanford began to pull away
from Purdue with a little over 12
minutes left in the half on an 18-5
run in which the Cardinal defense
held Purdue scoreless for over
seven minutes. Purdue came back
from a 13 point deficit with a small
run of their own to climb to within
eight, making the score 32-24 at
half-time.
Purdue continued to fight back
in the second half, knotting the Car
dinal up at 41-41 with a little less
than 10 minutes left in the game.
Paye then hit two consecutive three
pointers, one from the top of the key
and one from the left side. Stanford
soon turned it around on the other
side of the court, too, allowing only
11 points in the remainder of the
game. Stanford was able to convert
enough free throws down the
stretch to hold on for the 10 point
final spread.
Kaplan scored from inside and
out of the lane, connecting on nine
of her 17 attempts from the field
and four out of six from the free
throw line. Paye finished with 12
points, hitting two big three point
ers to open up the game. Scott led
the team in rebounding, ripping
down 10 total, six offensive. Wide
man led the team in assists with
five.
Purdue was led by Jannon
Roland and Stacy I»velace, who
contributed 15 and 11 points
respectively in the losing cause.
