# When exercising becomes an obsession
## Many let the gym control their lives 
### Cecilia Balli 
There's a midterm in two
days, a house meeting tonight, a
call to return and a book to read.
On top of that, it's dinner time.
But there are also sit-ups to
do, miles to run, weights to lift
and pounds to lose.
For many students, the acad
emic and social responsibilities
take priority. But for others, ex
ercise controls their lives.
Obsessive exercising — al
though hidden — is an issue
some students confront.
"It's an issue on this campus
and it's a big one," said Aly Feld
man, co-coordinator for Body
Image, Food and Self-Esteem.
"It's not recognized in the sense
that people don't see themselves
having the problem."
Body Image, Food and Self-
Esteem, a student organization
which functions as a support
group, currently helps about
seven students who exercise ob
sessively.
"If you tell me that there are


Meghna Chakrabarti — Daily
only seven or eight women at Stan
ford who have a problem with their
body then you're wrong," Feldman
said, adding that the group is small
because students have a difficult
time admitting their exercising is a
problem.
And for senior Jaime Wolf, real
izing that her exercising was obses
sive was not easy.
Wolfs close ties to the gym
formed the summer before she came
to Stanford, while working as a
receptionist at a health club. A certi
fied fitness trainer at the club told
her she needed to work out at least
twice a day in order to lose weight.
"I kind of thought, 'Gosh, tliis is
something that I should be doing,"'
Wolf said. "'Everybody else is doing
it.'"
Leaving the health club didn't
change her exercise patterns. Con
fronted by thousands of new faces at
Stanford, Wolf found refuge sweat
ing in the gym.
"It was almost easier to go to the
gym and spend time there than to
come to the dorm and not know any

one," she said. "I would go to the
gym first before being with every
body else."
Students who exercise excessive
ly usually fear being out of shape.
Wolf worried about the infamous
"freshman 15," even though she was
not overweight. It gave her all the
more reason to work out two to
three hours every day, she said.
Obsessive exercising can lead to a
number of lifestyle changes, includ
ing isolation and emotional stress,
Feldman said.
"You just focus all your energies
on one area of your life and ignore
everything else," she said. "As peo
ple get deeper into the problem they
isolate themselves from friends.
They're not social anymore."
"Even when they're in class
they're thinking about it," Feldman
added. "As they eat, they calculate
how many calories they're eating."
Wolf experienced mood swings as
a result of her obsession. When the
Stairmasters or the Lifecycles at the
gym were all being used, she said she
became irritated.
"[Exercisingl was the corner
stone of my day," Wolf said. "I'd
get angry if anything interfered
with my workout. I see that now as
a sign of something that should've

stopped me."
Some students suffer academical
ly if they spend too much time in the
gym or jogging around campus.
However, Wolf s determination to be
physically fit went "hand in hand
with perfectionism."
"When you cut out social activity
from your life you still have a lot of
time left (to study)," she said. "I set
really high standards. A 'B' or a
shorter workout kind of ruined my
day."
Excessive exercise can also be
physically damaging.
"There's no benefits for excessive
exercising," said Jerrie Thurman,
coordinator of the exercise classes
for the faculty Health Improvement
Program. "It can only tear down
body tissue. You invariably get
injured."
Aside from muscle tissue dam
age, strenuous exercising can also
cause hairline fractures on bones
and "a myriad of other problems,"
Thurman said.
Exercising becomes excessive
"when you start to notice the signs
of overuse," she added. These
signs include persistent soreness,
reduction or loss of appetite, sleep
lessness and tender knees and
shins.

Excessive exercising may be a big
ger problem at Stanford than on
other college campuses because of its
geographic location.
"I think California is very big on
health and exercise," said wrestler
Chris Seijak, "and the Stanford
campus just reflects that fact. The
people accepted [into Stanford] are
generally well-rounded and athletics
are a big part of that."
Feldman agreed, adding that the
California "tanned, bathing suit"
ideal may place pressure on some
students to fit the image.
But other students who over
exercise do not think working out
causes them problems.
Junior Oscar Dominguez —
whose daily schedule includes a trip
to Arrillaga gym said "obsessed" is
too strong a word to describe the
exercise activity at Stanford, he said.
"[Obsessed| loses some or its
power when you use it like that,"
Dominguez said.
But Wolf, having lived it herself,
does believe in obsessive exercising
and said she is glad she overcame it.
"I don't feel great about that (not
exercising so much anymore) but
I'm accepting it more," she said. "I'd
rather be happy than chained to the
Stairmaster."

Chris Seijak, "and the Stanford
campus just reflects that fact. The
people accepted [into Stanford] are
generally well-rounded and athletics
are a big part of that."
Feldman agreed, adding that the
California "tanned, bathing suit"
ideal may place pressure on some
students to fit the image.
But other students who over
exercise do not think working out
causes them problems.
Junior Oscar Dominguez —
whose daily schedule includes a trip
to Arrillaga gym said "obsessed" is
too strong a word to describe the
exercise activity at Stanford, he said.
"[Obsessed| loses some or its
power when you use it like that,"
Dominguez said.
But Wolf, having lived it herself,
does believe in obsessive exercising
and said she is glad she overcame it.
"I don't feel great about that (not
exercising so much anymore) but
I'm accepting it more," she said. "I'd
rather be happy than chained to the
Stairmaster."
There's a midterm in two
days, a house meeting tonight, a
call to return and a book to read.
On top of that, it's dinner time.
But there are also sit-ups to
do, miles to run, weights to lift
and pounds to lose.
For many students, the acad
emic and social responsibilities
take priority. But for others, ex
ercise controls their lives.
Obsessive exercising — al
though hidden — is an issue
some students confront.
"It's an issue on this campus
and it's a big one," said Aly Feld
man, co-coordinator for Body
Image, Food and Self-Esteem.
"It's not recognized in the sense
that people don't see themselves
having the problem."
Body Image, Food and Self-
Esteem, a student organization
which functions as a support
group, currently helps about
seven students who exercise ob
sessively.
"If you tell me that there are

only seven or eight women at Stan
ford who have a problem with their
body then you're wrong," Feldman
said, adding that the group is small
because students have a difficult
time admitting their exercising is a
problem.
And for senior Jaime Wolf, real
izing that her exercising was obses
sive was not easy.
Wolfs close ties to the gym
formed the summer before she came
to Stanford, while working as a
receptionist at a health club. A certi
fied fitness trainer at the club told
her she needed to work out at least
twice a day in order to lose weight.
"I kind of thought, 'Gosh, tliis is
something that I should be doing,"'
Wolf said. "'Everybody else is doing
it.'"
Leaving the health club didn't
change her exercise patterns. Con
fronted by thousands of new faces at
Stanford, Wolf found refuge sweat
ing in the gym.
"It was almost easier to go to the
gym and spend time there than to
come to the dorm and not know any

one," she said. "I would go to the
gym first before being with every
body else."
Students who exercise excessive
ly usually fear being out of shape.
Wolf worried about the infamous
"freshman 15," even though she was
not overweight. It gave her all the
more reason to work out two to
three hours every day, she said.
Obsessive exercising can lead to a
number of lifestyle changes, includ
ing isolation and emotional stress,
Feldman said.
"You just focus all your energies
on one area of your life and ignore
everything else," she said. "As peo
ple get deeper into the problem they
isolate themselves from friends.
They're not social anymore."
"Even when they're in class
they're thinking about it," Feldman
added. "As they eat, they calculate
how many calories they're eating."
Wolf experienced mood swings as
a result of her obsession. When the
Stairmasters or the Lifecycles at the
gym were all being used, she said she
became irritated.
"[Exercisingl was the corner
stone of my day," Wolf said. "I'd
get angry if anything interfered
with my workout. I see that now as
a sign of something that should've

stopped me."
Some students suffer academical
ly if they spend too much time in the
gym or jogging around campus.
However, Wolf s determination to be
physically fit went "hand in hand
with perfectionism."
"When you cut out social activity
from your life you still have a lot of
time left (to study)," she said. "I set
really high standards. A 'B' or a
shorter workout kind of ruined my
day."
Excessive exercise can also be
physically damaging.
"There's no benefits for excessive
exercising," said Jerrie Thurman,
coordinator of the exercise classes
for the faculty Health Improvement
Program. "It can only tear down
body tissue. You invariably get
injured."
Aside from muscle tissue dam
age, strenuous exercising can also
cause hairline fractures on bones
and "a myriad of other problems,"
Thurman said.
Exercising becomes excessive
"when you start to notice the signs
of overuse," she added. These
signs include persistent soreness,
reduction or loss of appetite, sleep
lessness and tender knees and
shins.

Excessive exercising may be a big
ger problem at Stanford than on
other college campuses because of its
geographic location.
"I think California is very big on
health and exercise," said wrestler
Chris Seijak, "and the Stanford
campus just reflects that fact. The
