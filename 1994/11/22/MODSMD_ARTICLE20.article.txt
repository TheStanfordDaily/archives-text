# Psycho?
## Defending Swinton's right to vent 
### 
Call me psycho.
From some of the things I've heard late
ly, that's exactly what I am — psycho.
What's my basis besides that lousy mug
shot?
Apparently, just one little sports article.
No kidding.
It all started about two weeks ago with
a feature story on sophomore cornerback
Eliel Swinton. The story told of Swinton's
approach to life and football after the trag
ic auto-accident death of his fiance Jessica
Williams. Two quotes from Swinton
struck me — and everyone else — in par
ticular.

"Whoever is playing against me, I look at
it as if they killed my girlfriend," Swinton
said, in reference to his mind set on game
day."I can release all my anger on the field,
and do it legally. I can just go out there and
unload on somebody. Even if I punch some
body, it's only a 15-yard penalty."
Unload? Perhaps more than that, as
suggested when Swinton carried his
speech one step further.
"I'm a little more psychotic on the field
because I really want to hurt somebody
now and it's legal," he said. "I know I can
do it if I put my mind to it. I can really
damage somebody. I'm a bruiser. I'm
going to get in your face, scream in your
face, and I'm going to blow you up. I'm lit
erally going to try to kill you."
Swinton's words hit me with consider
able force. But as I sat there editing that
article, it never once occurred to me that
readers might perceive Swinton as a com
pletely berserk individual. Not until my
colleagues reviewed the story and recom
mended that I "tone down" the article, lest
Swinton become branded for the remain
der of his Stanford days.
"It makes him sound psychotic," said
my managing editor, who personally

knows Swinton as a "kind" and "friendly"
individual. "It's not a very fair portrayal of
him."
I also received similar comments from
several people who read the Swinton story.
"If I were to evaluate his personality
solely on the basis of the article, I would
have him pegged as a seriously deranged
individual," one junior said.
Deranged? Hold on a second there. How
would any of you take it if you suddenly
lost your beloved through some unfath
omable, God-ordained turn of events?
If you possess any sort of ethical code,
like Swinton does, odds are you would look
forward to venting your anger and frustra
tions on the athletic field, where you won't
inflict any permanent harm that lays out
side the bounds of proper sportsmanship
(reminder — hard hitting is part of foot
ball). Who messed my life up to make me
identify with Swinton? Let's just say I also
recently lost the woman I was going to
marry over a turn of events I still question
God about. I hope you'll forgive me if I
don't go into details.
I don't mean to insult Swinton by
claiming that I can relate exactly to how he
feels, but my point is, for those of us who
have suffered — in all appearances —
divinely orchestrated tragedies, a dark side
may develop inside us. Mind you, this
darker half may nonetheless govern itself
morally, just as Swinton limits his outrage
to football. It still allows us to smile and
care for people.
However, in an attempt to express this
darker side of oneself, to me anyway, any
"toning down" would insult that "shadow
personality" tremendously. That side
developed for a reason — a strong reason
— and any effort to "cover up" that
intense pain and anger is, to me, a serious
offense, an unforgivable lack of acknowl
edgment for what caused the anguish in
the first place.
In the end, The Daily published a slight
ly toned down version of the Swinton arti
cle. I don't know how Swinton himself
took the story, but I was very disappointed
to say the least.
I, for one, would much rather have all of
you dub me psychotic than have you
underestimate the tragedy I endured.
Insult me if you will, but don't take my
pain lightly.
