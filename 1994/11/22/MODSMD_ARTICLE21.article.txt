# Cross country teams race to top-10 finishes at NCAAs
## 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
The Stanford cross country program elevated
itself to the height of a national powerhouse on
Monday as the men's and women's teams finished
sixth and seventh, respectively, at the NCAA Cham
pionships in Fayetteville, Ark.
"[Monday] was a historic day for Stanford cross
country," said head coach Vin Lananna. "At the
beginning of the year I said I hoped to put two teams
in the top 10 — we did much better than that. They
were fantastic."
The men were especially fantastic as they exceed
ed their own expectations as well as those of the
media. Ranked 11th going into the race, the Cardi
nal men bettered this estimation by five places, com
ing in behind lowa State, Colorado, Arizona, North
ern Arizona and Wisconsin.

'This race was very inspiring for
us to see where we want to be
next year'

Sophomore Greg Jimrnerson shocked everyone,
including himself, by finishing sixth in the men's
division with a time of 30 minutes, 34 seconds.
"It feels great," said the All-American of his run.
"I did more than I thought I was capable of doing."
Jimrnerson, who has led the Cardinal in all but
one of the races he's been in this year, believes his
mental attitude was the main reason he ran so well.
"I didn't let the course get to me — it was hilly
and muddy," Jimrnerson said. "Other than that I
just kept praying and running."
Finishing behind Jimrnerson for the Stanford
men were sophomores J. J. White and Bryan Zmi
jewski, who captured 64th and 73rd place respec
tively. White clocked a time of 31:48 and Zmijewski
crossed the line in 32:02.
On the women's side, the story for the Cardinal
was the same as it had been for most of the year.
Just as Michigan had the Fab Five in basketball,
Stanford's women's cross country boasts the Terrif
ic Two.
Freshmen phenoms Kortney Dunscombe and
Sarna Ren fro set the pace for the Cardinal as both
were named to the All-America team. Dunscombe,
who ran for 18th place with a time of 17:25, was
elated about her top-20 NCAA placing — and the
fact that she was finished running for a while.
"I'm just excited that the team ran well and that
it's over," Dunscombe said. "I'm very happy with
my performance, too."
Dunscombe added that the race was as much a
learning experience as anything else. "We wanted to
do better," she said, "but since we're so young it's a
good experience — we've already started setting
goals for next year."
Renfro ran one of her best races of late to finish
in 43rd place with a time of 17:54. Though pleased
with her personal performance, Renfro was happiest
about the team's race as a whole.
"No one bombed or freaked out or got scared,"

she said. "This race was very inspiring for us to see
where we want to be next year."
Looking ahead to next year must frighten all
other men's and women's collegiate teams in the
country, considering that only two Cardinal runners
on both teams are not freshmen or sophomores.
"The future looks very good," said Lananna. "I
think the athletes gained great experience [at the
NCAAsJ.
"One of my goals was to make the cross country
program at Stanford a national fixture," Lananna
added. "I think we took a giant step |Monday 1
toward accomplishing that."
