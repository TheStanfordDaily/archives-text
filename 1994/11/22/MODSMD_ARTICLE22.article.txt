# 'Horse' reins in a winning polo career
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
At times, Frank Schneider can
carry the Stanford water polo team on
his back. The man his teammates
affectionately call "Horse" has made
the most of his senior season, leading
the Cardinal (24-1) both in and out of
the water.
Although Schneider has started for
the team since midway through his
freshman campaign, the six-foot, five
inch, 205-pounder has played with
more passion than ever this year.
"Frank came to Stanford as a
young colt and he will leave as a
mature horse," said head coach Dante
Dettamanti. "He has matured in so
many ways — not only in playing abil
ity, but in leadership and personality.
It has been fun to see him progress."
Assistant coach Ben Quittner also
noted the hunger Schneider has
shown this season. "As a senior,
Frank has really picked it up," Quit
tner said. "He has turned it around
100 percent from his freshman year. I
expect that by the NCAAs he will
dominate."
When Stanford travels south to
Long Beach, Calif., for the NCAA
tournament this weekend, Schneider
will indeed look to continue the inside
dominance he has established
throughout the season.
Dubbed by many as the best hole
man in the nation, Schneider has
blossomed into a multi-talented
threat at the center-forward spot. His
exceptional strength allows him the
option to turn his defender and earn
either a shot or a penalty.
This year, Schneider has made a
conscious effort to add finesse to his
game. In doing so, he has developed
into one of the most effective passers
from his position. Against California
on Saturday in the Big Splash,
Schneider scored two goals, and con
stantly kept Cal goaltender Sean
Nolan off-balanced with a host of shot
attempts.
In comparing Schneider to one of
his competitors, Hrovje Cizmic of
USC, Dettamanti noted the difference
in styles.
"Frank is not the same kind of
holeman as Cizmic," Dettamanti said.

"Cizmic is one-dimensional. Frank is
more versatile, more mobile and has
more shots."
Hailing from Saratoga, Calif.,
Schneider entered Stanford as the
nation's top recruit at his position
after earning All-American honors at
Bellarmine Preparatory in San Jose.
Schneider and teammates Wolf Wigo,

a driver, and Jack Bowen, a goal
tender, made Dettamanti's recruiting
class of 1991 the best in the nation.

Senior Frank Schneider is eager to bring another national championship to the
Cardinal this year.
titles. Schneider's decision wasn't
hard once he took a look at both
institutions.
"Basically, a lot of my friends at
Cal seemed to have a lack of focus,"
Schneider said. "They were not
focused on what they wanted to do,
what they wanted to be. They
seemed totally lost — one of my
main concerns was they didn't seem
to be enjoying themselves. It seemed
like it was an abyss."
This year, there is no Lack of focus
on Schneider's part. The wisened
senior has taken over the leadership
role that he has seen other talented
Cardinal stars hold during his first
three years. It's not always easy, but
it's something the team needs.
"It's really a strange position for
me," Schneider said. "I've never
really been a leader out there — I've
been more like a clown figure in the
past."
But the drive toward another
NCAA title is the fire under the
Horse, keeping him and his team
mates on track.
"This year, I find myself respon
sible for seeing that my final year is
successful," Schneider said. "I take
that very seriously. I want to win.
For Wolf and I, this is our turn to
win — if we don't, we can only
blame ourselves."
When thoughts of the NCAA
finals enter Schneider's head, he
experiences mixed feelings of ecstasy
and agony — in two NCAA champi
onship games, he has reached both
extremes. According to Quittner, the
1992 NCAA title match was the
turning point of Schneider's Cardi
nal career. Stanford lost in sudden
death overtime after rallying from a
six-goal deficit in regulation.
Last year, Schneider sealed a Car
dinal victory over USC by powering
home a goal from the hole with less
than a minute remaining to put the
Stanford lead out of reach.
"After (the 1992] game, he decid
ed he wasn't going to lose another
[title match]," Quittner said. "Last
year, he made sure we won. He put
the nail in IUSC'sI cofTin."
There is no doubt in Schneider's
mind that the overtime thriller
turned his attitude around 180
degrees.
"It was absolutely a turning
point for me," Schneider said.
"After that, water polo began to
take on a whole new meaning. It

changed me — it changed my atti
tude when I played and the way I
approach the game.
"At the end, I was physically and
mentally exhausted," Schneider
continued. "I started hyperventilat
ing, I couldn't stand. I couldn't
move for half an hour. It was a good
experience and a bad one too — but
I take that experience with me into
the NCAAs."
Throughout this season, Schnei
der has been the centerpiece of an
explosive Cardinal offense. He is
currently third on the team with 45
points, but has amassed a large
number of assists and drawn
numerous penalties which don't
show up on the stats page.
"He has learned how to control
the game," Dettamanti said. "He
used to shoot the ball no matter
what when he got it. We'd throw the
ball in the hole and didn't know
what was going to happen — it was
turnover city."
With years of collegiate experi
ence, Schneider has adapted to the
style of play and has provided emo
tional spark to the squad as well.
"There have been several games
in which he just had a determined
look on his face," Dettamanti said.
"He inspires the team when he
turns his man in the hole — he's the
main focus of the offense. When he
is angry, he is unstoppable."
Although it doesn't seem wise,
several teams have angered Schnei
der by resorting to physically pound
ing him in the course of a match.
"I broke a tooth from a head-butt
against [University of the] Pacific
and an elbow to the mouth moved
some teeth against USC," Schnei
der recalled. "I play very physically
— part of the attitude is being able
to absorb abuse. I expect cheap
shots; it's not something that both
ers me.
"Of course, I do get my revenge,"
Schneider added. "I know how to
even. There are lots of ways of
hurting people in the water without
getting caught."
Schneider's philosophy of water
polo is simple: "It's getting down and
dirty. It's getting in there and fight
ing for four quarters, and regardless
of the cheap shots and no matter
how many times they hit you —
we'll come out on top at the end."
That message should be heeded
by the teams making up the NCAA
field.
The Cardinal is on the march to
Ijong Beach.
And it's being led by a hungry
Horse.
