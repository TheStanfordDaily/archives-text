# 'Horse' reins in a winning polo career
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
At times, Frank Schneider can
carry the Stanford water polo team on
his back. The man his teammates
affectionately call "Horse" has made
the most of his senior season, leading
the Cardinal (24-1) both in and out of
the water.
Although Schneider has started for
the team since midway through his
freshman campaign, the six-foot, five
inch, 205-pounder has played with
more passion than ever this year.
"Frank came to Stanford as a
young colt and he will leave as a
mature horse," said head coach Dante
Dettamanti. "He has matured in so
many ways — not only in playing abil
ity, but in leadership and personality.
It has been fun to see him progress."
Assistant coach Ben Quittner also
noted the hunger Schneider has
shown this season. "As a senior,
Frank has really picked it up," Quit
tner said. "He has turned it around
100 percent from his freshman year. I
expect that by the NCAAs he will
dominate."
When Stanford travels south to
Long Beach, Calif., for the NCAA
tournament this weekend, Schneider
will indeed look to continue the inside
dominance he has established
throughout the season.
Dubbed by many as the best hole
man in the nation, Schneider has
blossomed into a multi-talented
threat at the center-forward spot. His
exceptional strength allows him the
option to turn his defender and earn
either a shot or a penalty.
This year, Schneider has made a
conscious effort to add finesse to his
game. In doing so, he has developed
into one of the most effective passers
from his position. Against California
on Saturday in the Big Splash,
Schneider scored two goals, and con
stantly kept Cal goaltender Sean
Nolan off-balanced with a host of shot
attempts.
In comparing Schneider to one of
his competitors, Hrovje Cizmic of
USC, Dettamanti noted the difference
in styles.
"Frank is not the same kind of
holeman as Cizmic," Dettamanti said.

"Cizmic is one-dimensional. Frank is
more versatile, more mobile and has
more shots."
Hailing from Saratoga, Calif.,
Schneider entered Stanford as the
nation's top recruit at his position
after earning All-American honors at
Bellarmine Preparatory in San Jose.
Schneider and teammates Wolf Wigo,

a driver, and Jack Bowen, a goal
tender, made Dettamanti's recruiting
class of 1991 the best in the nation.
The coach feels fortunate that
Schneider chose the Cardinal over
the Golden Bears, who had just won
the first of three consecutive national


Teressa Trusty — Daily
Senior Frank Schneider is eager to bring another national championship to the
Cardinal this year.
