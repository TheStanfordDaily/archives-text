Formally titled "A Celebration of the Life of Jessi
ca Williams," yesterday's memorial service was a
time for those closest to the Stanford sophomore who
died last month to reflect on her life and the blessings
she gave to others.
"Jessica brought joy into my life and into the lives
of everyone around her," said sophomore Cristale
Brown during the approximately 45-minute ceremo

all that she gave to all of our lives and all that she con

are not words for that."
Bolding went on to say that Williams' death has
brought her closer to her other friends, and to life it
self, making her realize that every minute of life is
precious.
"I hear her and see her in a lot of different things
that happen. I see her smile everywhere," Bolding
said. "Something that Jessica has taught me is that
