# 'Sassy, bold, brass, beautiful'
## Friends recall Williams' life 
### Tristan Sorah Reyes Contributing writer 
Formally titled "A Celebration of the Life of Jessi
ca Williams," yesterday's memorial service was a
time for those closest to the Stanford sophomore who
died last month to reflect on her life and the blessings
she gave to others.
"Jessica brought joy into my life and into the lives
of everyone around her," said sophomore Cristale
Brown during the approximately 45-minute ceremo
ny in Memorial Church.
While on a short trip with seven other Stanford
students last month, Williams was killed when their
van overturned near Hayward. Police have reported
ly identified the driver who caused the accident, and
the case has been sent to the Fremont District Attor
ney's office.
The service began with a slide show of pictures of
Williams and her friends put together by Brown and
sophomore Teresa Matt, who were two of Williams'
drawmates.
"Sassy, bold, brass, beautiful, intelligent and
strong; these are the things Jessica's friends want us
to remember about her," said Floyd Thompkins, Jr.,
associate dean of Memorial Church. "This should be
a time of celebration, gladness and appreciation for
all that she gave to all of our lives and all that she con
tinues to give."
Two of Williams' friends, senior Keri Bolding and
sophomore Laura Duff, then spoke on "Moments of
Memory."
"I was anxious to share my feelings about Jessica
— what she meant to me, what a great friend and per
son she was," Bolding said. "But I realized that there
was no possible way, whether it be in five minutes or
five hours, to express what she meant to me. There
are not words for that."
Bolding went on to say that Williams' death has
brought her closer to her other friends, and to life it
self, making her realize that every minute of life is
precious.
"I hear her and see her in a lot of different things
that happen. I see her smile everywhere," Bolding
said. "Something that Jessica has taught me is that
even if someone is not physically there, they are there
in spirit. Whether I am here for
eight years or 80 years Jessica will
be with me always. She is not
gone, she will always be here in
spirit."
Duff then spoke about how to
deal with someone being there
one minute and then gone the
next.
"Coping, that is the biggest
problem that myself and others
are having to deal with." Duff
said. "Just think about what she
has given you and take that and
keep it in your heart and remem
ber it and then give it to some
body else. Don't let her spirit die.
Let her live inside of you and
share what she has given to you
so that she can live on in other
people."
The Gospel Choir sang "Steal
Away" and sophomore Jabari
Anderson sang "Everything is
Gonna Be Alright" to honor
Williams.
In closing, Thompkins reflect
ed on the events of the past
month, the strength of Williams'
spirit and her ability to continue
to live through her friends and
family.
"Jessica is an amazing spirit,
she had the ability to bring out
the best in other people, and the
ability to bring a smile to any
one's face," Thompkins said. "I
was driving in a van with a rev
erend from the L.A. area on our

way to the cemetery and the pro
cession got lost on the way, and
the reverend said, 'This must
have been some young lady. She
doesn't want to go.' Jessica is not
going anywhere. She is staying in
spirit in the lives of those she
touched."
