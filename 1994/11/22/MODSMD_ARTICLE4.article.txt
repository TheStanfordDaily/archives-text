# Chappie dispute upsets Pub Board
## Pub Board director faces dismissal for suspending Chappie last week 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
Amid controversy over last Fri
day's suspension of the Stanford
Chaparral humor magazine by
ASSU Publications Board Director
Danny Bressler, the board last night
upheld a measure to reallocate the
Chapparal's space.
The vote followed an announce
ment by the Council of Presidents
that they will propose a motion call
ing for Bressler's dismissal at
tonight's meeting of the ASSU Sen
ate Appropriations Committee, in
compliance with senate bylaws.
The dispute over The Chapar
ral's space began several months
ago when the Pub Board decided to
reallocate space for student publica
tions as directed by senate bylaws.
But the magazine claimed it
maintains a historic right to its
space, leading to disputes over what
Bressler called damage to the maga
zine's allocated rooms and lack of
respect for the board's authority.
"The Chaparral has a histoiy of
acting in violation of Publications
Board bylaws by using its space for
unapproved and damaging activi
ties," said Bressler, a junior.
Bressler eventually suspended
the Chaparral, freezing its ASSU
account and taking away its right to
vote on Pub Board matters.
But COP members claim
Bressler was out of order in sus
pending the magazine, and called
for his resignation with allegations
that he acted in a biased manner.
Last night, however, the Pub
Board voted to sustain the suspen
sion but give the Chaparral voting
and speaking rights on issues of
space allocation.
A possible dismissal
The COP told Bressler during a

Sunday night phone call that he had
until 5 p.m. Monday to resign. He
did not and may be dismissed by the
senate's Appropriations Committee
tonight, said COP member Vanessa
Alvarado, a junior.
But Bressler said he does not
think he acted inappropriately. "I
believe I have been trying very hard
to resolve the issue and to resolve it

fairly," he said.
Undergradu
ate senator Steve
Russell, last year's
Pub Board direc
tor and a member
of this year's
board, expressed
concerns that tl 16
COP's motion for
dismissal was car
ried out unconsti-

tutionally because Bressler had not
been given 48 hours of notice in
writing and the motion could have
been politically motivated, both of
which violate senate bylaws.
But Alvarado said Bressler had
been given proper notice. The COP
handed him a letter about his dis
missal last night, and although the
Appropriations Committee will vote
on the motion tonight, Bressler will
remain director until Wednesday
night — regardless of the outcome
of the vote.
The senate bylaws also state that
the director of the Pub Board "may
not be removed for political rea
sons. " Russell suggested that the re
sponse of Chaparral alumni to the
suspension may have influenced the
COP's decision, making it politically
charged.
Chaparral alumni have sent let
ters on the matter and did attend a
negotiation meeting held last Fri
day. However, COP member Ani


Ekanem
etie Ekanem, a senior, said the
motion for dismissal was the result
of three problems: Bressler's per
sonal involvement in the dispute,
his activities last summer and his
acting in "bad faith."
In the course of the space negoti
ations, there have been "personal
attacks on both sides. It's become a
really bad situation," Ekanem said,
adding he does not believe that
Bressler can make impartial deci
sions because of the level of emo
tion in the controversy.
Last summer, Bressler also
"made some changes" to the space
without University consent, some
of which may have been environ
mentally unsafe, Ekanem said,
though he declined to specify the
activities.
The third action by Bressler that
Ekanem said convinced the COP
involved Bressler's suspension of the
Chaparral after three hours of nego
tiations among the ASSU, the Office
of Student Affairs, the Pub Board,
the Chaparral, their alumni, and
other representatives last Friday.
Bressler was planning to sus
pend the magazine but participated
in the negotiations without making
anyone aware of his plans, Ekanem
said. "I question this," he said.
"That's a glaring example of poor
management."
Ekanem said he is "angry that as
a member of the COP I have to get
involved with this whole affair. The

fact that it could not be resolved on
the Pub Board level shows that
there's... not just a minor problem
but a serious problem."
The COP's only motivation in
moving for Bressler's dismissal "is
to resolve this situation," Ekanem
said.
Allocating space
The new bill, written by mem
bers of the Pub Board's Facilities
and Space Committee, converts one
of four rooms currently used by the
Chaparral into a common room for
all student publications. The Cha
parral maintains rights to two
rooms, and a fourth is divided
between use by The Stanford
Review and by the Pub Board.
Russell said the Chaparral was
suspended because negotiations
over space allocations were going
nowhere.
"For the past year and a half, the
Publications Board has made every
effort to involve the Chaparral in
this decision," Russell said.
"There's a point where the ASSU
and the Publications Board need to
say, 'Enough is enough.' "
Nanci Howe, director of the
Office of Student Activities, ques
tioned the Pub Board's right to sus
pend a student publication for a vio
lation of the bylaws in the first place.
"I think that the University is
the landlord of that space," Howe
said. "If there are problems with
the space, it's the University's
responsibility to deal with those
problems.... It's not the role of
the Publications Board to repri
mand a group."

The Chaparral will keep its busi
ness office and a room used for
planning and writing the magazine,
Bressler said. The room that will be
converted to a common room is
rarely used by the Chaparral, he
maintained.
Sophomore Rudy Delson, the
Chaparral's archivist, said the mag
azine has a historical right to the
space and that the rooms are part of
an important tradition of creative
thought.
When the Storke family donated
money for the building in 1963, the
four student publications in exis
tence at the time — the Chaparral,
the Quad, the Sequoia and The
Stanford Daily — raised money and
were awarded space in the building
according to how much money was
raised, Delson said.
The Chaparral donated $16,000,
he added, under the belief that "the
publications [in the Storke Build
ing] would be housed until they
ceased to be published."
Delson said what worries him Ls
not so much the specific rooms
which the board voted to appropri
ate to other groups, but that the
decision sets a precedent for taking
away more of the Chaparral's space.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds said in a letter
addressing the issue that while the
contributions made by the Chaparral
to the construction of the building are
important, times have changed.
"While it is important to contin
ue our commitment to the four
groups that were involved in the
early Storke Building, it is also
important that we accommodate

the other student publications now
in operation," her letter said.
"When the Storke Building was
built close to 30 years ago, four stu
dent publications existed on cam
pus; now there are close to 20."
Edmonds also said that despite
the Chaparral's history on campus,
its monetary contributions to the
construction of Storke do not mean
"they are... exempt from potential
space reallocation by the ASSU
Publications Board" because as a
registered student organization
they are "subject to University
goals and expectations as well as
ASSU publication policies and
bylaws."
An unenforced law
The controversy has been
caused, in part, because no Pub
Board has ever attempted to reallo
cate space, Bressler said. In 1983,
the Pub Board bylaws were altered
to limit the time for which a space is
assigned to a specific publication to
"not less than two years [and] not
greater than five years." After that
time, space may be reassigned or
left in the hands of the group.
Those time limits apply only to
the Chaparral, the Quad, The Daily
and The Review; other allocations
are reevaluated on a yearly basis,
according to the Pub Board bylaws.
Bressler said he believes the
space issue has not been
approached in the past 11 years
because of a fear of controversy.
"This was supposed to have hap
pened a long time ago," he said.
"It's just that no one has wanted to
deal with it."
