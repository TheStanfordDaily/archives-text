# Chappie dispute upsets Pub Board
## Pub Board director faces dismissal for suspending Chappie last week 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
Amid controversy over last Fri
day's suspension of the Stanford
Chaparral humor magazine by
ASSU Publications Board Director
Danny Bressler, the board last night
upheld a measure to reallocate the
Chapparal's space.
The vote followed an announce
ment by the Council of Presidents
that they will propose a motion call
ing for Bressler's dismissal at
tonight's meeting of the ASSU Sen
ate Appropriations Committee, in
compliance with senate bylaws.
The dispute over The Chapar
ral's space began several months
ago when the Pub Board decided to
reallocate space for student publica
tions as directed by senate bylaws.
But the magazine claimed it
maintains a historic right to its
space, leading to disputes over what
Bressler called damage to the maga
zine's allocated rooms and lack of
respect for the board's authority.
"The Chaparral has a histoiy of
acting in violation of Publications
Board bylaws by using its space for
unapproved and damaging activi
ties," said Bressler, a junior.
Bressler eventually suspended
the Chaparral, freezing its ASSU
account and taking away its right to
vote on Pub Board matters.
But COP members claim
Bressler was out of order in sus
pending the magazine, and called
for his resignation with allegations
that he acted in a biased manner.
Last night, however, the Pub
Board voted to sustain the suspen
sion but give the Chaparral voting
and speaking rights on issues of
space allocation.
A possible dismissal
The COP told Bressler during a

Sunday night phone call that he had
until 5 p.m. Monday to resign. He
did not and may be dismissed by the
senate's Appropriations Committee
tonight, said COP member Vanessa
Alvarado, a junior.
But Bressler said he does not
think he acted inappropriately. "I
believe I have been trying very hard
to resolve the issue and to resolve it

fairly," he said.
Undergradu
ate senator Steve
Russell, last year's
Pub Board direc
tor and a member
of this year's
board, expressed
concerns that tl 16
COP's motion for
dismissal was car
ried out unconsti-

tutionally because Bressler had not
been given 48 hours of notice in
writing and the motion could have
been politically motivated, both of
which violate senate bylaws.
But Alvarado said Bressler had
been given proper notice. The COP
handed him a letter about his dis
missal last night, and although the
Appropriations Committee will vote
on the motion tonight, Bressler will
remain director until Wednesday
night â€” regardless of the outcome
of the vote.
The senate bylaws also state that
the director of the Pub Board "may
not be removed for political rea
sons. " Russell suggested that the re
sponse of Chaparral alumni to the
suspension may have influenced the
COP's decision, making it politically
charged.
Chaparral alumni have sent let
ters on the matter and did attend a
negotiation meeting held last Fri
day. However, COP member Ani
