# ASSU may control some Stanford Fund money
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
Facing ASSU opposition to a policy
that restricts student groups' solicita
tion of alumni, University administra
tors yesterday asked student represen
tatives to consider a plan that would
give the ASSU greater control over a
portion of alumni-generated funds.
But many students opposed to the
policy said the new plan doesn't change
the fact that student groups will no
longer be able to raise money for them
selves.

The restriction, part of the Stanford
Fund — an effort to cut down the num
ber of solicitations and encourage more
alumni to make annual unrestricted
gifts to the University — has drawn
criticism from ASSU senators as a
threat to student groups' autonomy
and their ability to support themselves.
In response, administrators yester
day said that groups could continue to
access their most vital sources of in
come — alumni who are already giving
— and that "block grants" from the
provost to the ASSU would guarantee
groups that comply with the policy a

portion of the donations.
Under the current interpretation of
the policy, which became effective
Sept. 1, groups are allowed to solicit
only those alumni who have donated
within five years of the solicitation.
These potential donors, together
with "an internal allocation process
that has student leadership at the
heart of it," will allow student groups
to benefit from the proposed changes,
said Stephen Peeps, associate vice pres
ident for development.
ASSU Council of Presidents mem
bers Anietie Ekanem and Vanessa Al

varado, who attended the meeting, re
acted to the proposed "clarification" of
the policy with skepticism.
Alvarado said her fundamental ob
jections to the policy weren't addressed
at the meeting. "It shouldn't have got
ten to this point," she said. "I still need
to be convinced from their side."
And while the administrators ad
mitted to "communication errors" in
explaining the new policy, they main
tained the fundamental issues at stake
remained unchanged.
