# ASSU may control some Stanford Fund money
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
Facing ASSU opposition to a policy
that restricts student groups' solicita
tion of alumni, University administra
tors yesterday asked student represen
tatives to consider a plan that would
give the ASSU greater control over a
portion of alumni-generated funds.
But many students opposed to the
policy said the new plan doesn't change
the fact that student groups will no
longer be able to raise money for them
selves.

The restriction, part of the Stanford
Fund — an effort to cut down the num
ber of solicitations and encourage more
alumni to make annual unrestricted
gifts to the University — has drawn
criticism from ASSU senators as a
threat to student groups' autonomy
and their ability to support themselves.
In response, administrators yester
day said that groups could continue to
access their most vital sources of in
come — alumni who are already giving
— and that "block grants" from the
provost to the ASSU would guarantee
groups that comply with the policy a

portion of the donations.
Under the current interpretation of
the policy, which became effective
Sept. 1, groups are allowed to solicit
only those alumni who have donated
within five years of the solicitation.
These potential donors, together
with "an internal allocation process
that has student leadership at the
heart of it," will allow student groups
to benefit from the proposed changes,
said Stephen Peeps, associate vice pres
ident for development.
ASSU Council of Presidents mem
bers Anietie Ekanem and Vanessa Al

varado, who attended the meeting, re
acted to the proposed "clarification" of
the policy with skepticism.
Alvarado said her fundamental ob
jections to the policy weren't addressed
at the meeting. "It shouldn't have got
ten to this point," she said. "I still need
to be convinced from their side."
And while the administrators ad
mitted to "communication errors" in
explaining the new policy, they main
tained the fundamental issues at stake
remained unchanged.
"What the president and
provost aren't willing to do, and
what they oughtn't be willing to
do, is concede their right — and,
in fact, their responsibility — to
make priority judgments on the
core academic and extra-curricu
lar needs that are theirs to decide
over time," Peeps said.
ASSU Undergraduate Senator
Steven Russell, who has led
opposition to the new policy but
did not attend the meeting, said
the clarification essentially
changes nothing. "It's giving a
lot of power to [University Presi
dent Gerhard] Casper and
[Provost] Condoleezza Rice to
determine how much money stu
dent groups need, and giving the
ASSU a lot of power over how
that money will be allocated," he
said.
An ASSU bill written by Rus

sell that would directly challenge
the policy is up for consideration
at today's senate meeting. By
making the ASSU an "umbrella
organization" to create and dis
tribute alumni mailing lists, the
bill would seek to circumvent the
Development Office's restric
tions.
The broader implications of
the bill are unclear. "As long as
the ASSU is together in opposi
tion to oppressive University poli
cies, there's very little the Uni
versity can do," Russell said.
Ekanem, on the other hand,
said the ASSU should first evalu
ate the effect on student groups.
"We do have to safeguard stu
dents' (interests), but we also
have to safeguard the ASSU as
the representative of students,"
he said.
Peeps expressed concern that
the bill could force a test of wills.
"I'm hoping something won't be
adopted that would make it diffi
cult to continue to talk about
this," he said.
