### September Treviño Staff writer 
David Liu, a 23-year-old engineering
graduate student, was shot and killed last
week in Palo Alto while on his way to visit a
friend.
On Nov. 13, around 7 p.m., two black
males jumped Liu near his friend's apart
ment complex just after he stepped out of his
car, said Palo Alto Police Det. Luis Verbera.
The two men subsequently beat, robbed and
shot him in the back, he added.
"It appears the motive was robbery," Ver
bera said.
Paramedics immediately arrived at the
scene — near Highway 101 and Greer Park
in Palo Alto — and attempted to resuscitate
Liu, Verbera said. They transported him to
Stanford Hospital, where he was pro
nounced dead an hour after the shooting.
Two suspects fled from the scene and re
main at large. Palo Alto police said they be
lieve a black male of average height and
heavy build fired the shot that killed Liu.
The Palo Alto Police Department has
posted a $5,000 reward "for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of the
person or persons responsible for the shoot
ing," Verbera said.

While he was pursuing a master's in prod
uct design from the Department of Mechan
ical Engineering, Liu was on an academic
leave of absence to complete the required
work experience component of the program.
Living in San Jose, Liu worked two part
time jobs — one for the Redwood City de
sign firm Studio Red and one for the San
Jose Museum of Technology — to fulfill de
gree requirements.
Liu, a native of Burlington, Vermont,
graduated from Cornell University in 1992
with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engi
neering and dean's list honors.
Liu had a black belt in tae kwon do and
was a member of Stanford's Tae Kwon Do
Club.
"Dave in essence was the person who al
ways had a smile on his face, even after
pulling an all-nighter. He was really patient,
[and] eager to learn with a sincerity very few
people had [and] that all of us admired. He
was very special" said Al Cho, Liu's friend
and classmate in product design.
Liu's parents, Ying and Josephine Liu,
have established a memorial scholarship
fund in his honor. Contributions can be
made through the School of Engineering.
Liu's memorial services will be held today
at 1 p.m. in Memorial Church.
