## Serbs retaliate for NATO attack Fighters shoot at two British jets in response to earlier air strike 
### 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
•AP) — Serb fighters set villages
ablaze and sent civilians fleeing for
their lives yesterday in northwest
Bosnia, their response to a retaliatory
airstrike by NATO warplanes.
Surface-to-air missiles were fired
at two NATO jets flying over Serb
held Banja Luka. The British jets
were not hit.
Senior officials of Croatia, site of
Monday's NATO attack on a Serb-run
airport used to stage bombing runs on
a U.N. safe haven in Bosnia's Bihac
area, said NATO had asked for and
received permission to fly again over
Croatia.
NATO had no immediate com
ment. But a NATO official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said any
such request wouldn't necessarily
signal another airstrike soon.
Instead, he said, it could be forward
planning to be able to respond quick
ly if the U.N. requests another bomb

ing raid.
About 50 allied warplanes and sup
porting aircraft bombed the Udbina
airstrip in Croatia, just across the
border with Bosnia, in NATO's
biggest attack ever. The airfield had
been used three times the past two
weeks by planes attacking the Bihac
area, where there are a cluster of
towns held by Bosnia's Muslim-led
government.
Senior United Nations sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Serbs could overrun the U.N.
safe haven of Bihac by late today.
They said U.N. envoy Yasushi
Akashi would appeal to President Slo
bodan Milosevic of neighboring
greater Serbia today to try to halt the
rebel Serb offensive.
Radovan Karadzic, the leader of
the Bosnian Serbs, said the United
Nations could expect severe retalia
tion for the airstrike.
"We will determine the time and

the target of the revenge ourselves,
but we will definitely make sure that
it is painful for NATO nations,"
Karadzic told Bosnian Serb televi
sion.
The message of allied force
appeared lost on the Serb besiegers of
the Bihac pocket about 90 miles
northwest of Sarajevo.
A U.N. spokesman, Lt. Col. Jan-
Dirk von Merveldt, said yesterday
afternoon there was a "large
increase" in artillery, machine-gun
and small arms fire in areas around
Bihac still held by Bosnian govern
ment forces.
The town of Bihac itself was cut off
on all sides except to the north, said
U.N. officials.
Serb fighters rolled over several
villages in the western part of the
Bihac enclave, near the Croatian bor
der, leaving them destroyed, aban
doned or ablaze and their residents
fleeing toward the town yesterday.
