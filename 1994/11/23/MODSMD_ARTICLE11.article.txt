# 'He'd better have a bodyguard'
## Jesse Helms' remarks about Clinton worry Congressmen 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In 22 combatively con
servative years in the Senate, Jesse Helms has per
fected the art of making political foes uncomfortable.
Now, just as he's about to assume the chairman
ship of a major committee, he's got fellow Republi
can senators squirming over a comment that Presi
dent Clinton is so unpopular on military bases that
"he'd better have a bodyguard" if he travels to North
Carolina.
Helms made the remark Monday in an interview
with the Raleigh News and Observer. By mid-day
yesterday, he had issued a statement declaring that
with his words, he had "made a mistake . . . which I
shall not repeat."
Clinton called Helms' remarks "unwise and inap
propriate."
Asked yesterday if Helms was fit to become chair

man of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee —
as he will in January — Sen. Thad Cochran of Mis
sissippi replied: "Sen. Helms has been an outstand
ing senator."
The man who will lead the Republican majority in
the new Congress trod gingerly, as well. "I didn't see
the entire statement," said Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas.
"My view is that the President of the United States
is welcome to come to any state."
Dole also said, "I think pretty much that Jesse
must have said most of this probably in jest."
He shook his head when asked if there had been
pressure to remove Helms from his soon-to-be chair
manship, and Sen. Arlen Specter, a moderate from
Pennsylvania, said that just as Clinton is rightfully
commander-in-chief, Helms is entitled by seniority
to become chairman.
