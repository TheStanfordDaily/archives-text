Gunman fires at FBI
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
gunman opened fire inside the
District of Columbia's police
headquarters yesterday in a
shooting spree that left two
FBI agents, a city detective
and the gunman himself dead,
police said.
It was not immediately
known how the gunman died
or why the shooting started.
Police Chief Fred Thomas
would say only that three men
walked into a third-floor
squad room and "gunshots
erupted."
Thomas said police officers
dragged the wounded police
detective and one of the FBI
agents from the squad room
shortly after the shooting
erupted about 3:30 p.m. A
civilian also "managed to
crawl from the room despite a
gunshot wound to the leg,"
Thomas said.
About a hour after the ini
tial shots were fired, police

emergency teams broke into
the room and found three
more wounded people — two
other FBI agents and another
civilian. A fourth man was
found unharmed.
Thomas declined to provide
further details.
Authorities had earlier
identified the dead metropoli
tan police officer as Detective
Hank Daly, 51, a 28-year vet
eran with the Metropolitan
Police Department.
