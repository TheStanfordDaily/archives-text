# Republicans pledge power shift

### 
WILLIAMSBURG, VA. (AP)
— Republican congressional lead
ers pledged yesterday to dramati
cally shift power from Washing
ton to the states but bluntly
warned governors that the price
for less federal meddling is less
federal money.
"We will get out of the man
date business but we will also get
out of the money business," Sen.
Bob Packwood of Oregon, in line
to be Senate Finance Committee
chairman, told a Republican Gov
ernors Association meeting.
"If you relieve us of some of
the most onerous mandates, we
will live with that," said New Jer
sey Gov. Christine Todd Whit
man.
The event served as a remark
able illustration of the Republican
Party's resurgence: a handful of
leaders of the first GOP congres
sional majority in 40 years min
gling and exchanging ideas with
many of the 30 Republican gover
nors and governors-elect who rep
resent the party's best statehouse
showing in a quarter-century.
And it was the first time since

the election that incoming House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.,
and incoming Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., have
appeared together at a public
event, speaking back-to-back and
then sitting in on a discussion of
what it would take to balance the
budget by 2002.
There have been tense
moments in their relationship in
the past, and undoubtedly will be
more ahead. But the two were as
chummy as could be yesterday,
showering compliments on each
other and pledging to work as a
team — and to invite Republican
governors to heavily influence
their legislative initiatives.
"There is nothing currently in
writing that is not open to being
better," said Gingrich. "This is all
open to negotiation."
The GOP governors were
beaming at their newfound num
bers and influence, and said their
tax-cutting ways should serve as
an example to Washington.
"It is a partnership we believe
will be not just productive but his
toric," said Utah Gov. Mike Leav

itt, the new RGA chairman.
Not addressed in the Republi
can promises of cooperation was
whether President Clinton would
go along with the promises of the
GOP congressional leaders. The
answer could go a long way in
deciding whether Republicans
can keep the loyalty of the voters,
whom Dole said would be impa
tient for results.
"If we blow it, we may be
denied the opportunity for anoth
er 10, 15 or 20 years," said Dole.
"But we are not going to blow it."
Both Dole and Gingrich said
the Republican rush to shrink the
federal government and balance
the budget would place every fed
eral program except Social Securi
ty under the microscope, and that
many were likely to be eliminated
outright or cut significantly.
Along the way, they promised
states that Washington would
lift many regulations, in areas
from health care to education to
environmental enforcement,
that states complain make pro
grams too expensive and less effi
cient.
