# Haitian security guard sought
## U.S. Embassy searches for suspect in shooting of two employees 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
Haitian army private assigned to
guard the U.S. ambassador in Port
au-Prince is being sought in the
slaying of two U.S. Embassy
employees who were carrying the
embassy payroll, officials said yes
terday.
The State Department is offer
ing a $10,000 reward for informa
tion leading to the arrest of Pvt.
Francois College, who worked as a
bodyguard for Ambassador William
Swing, said Andy Laine,
spokesman for the State Depart
ment's diplomatic security office.
Two Haitians employed by the
embassy's budget office were shot
to death as they drove from the
bank to the embassy with the pay
roll on Nov. 10. A third person, the
driver, was critically wounded and

is hospitalized in Miami.
The gunman escaped with the
payroll.
Investigators said College was
one of the Haitian military mem
bers assigned to protect the ambas
sador when he traveled outside the
embassy grounds. Using local
police or military bodyguards is typ
ical U.S. practice abroad, although
U.S. Marines protect the embassy
grounds.
College had been employed in
his job for some time, including
when military coup leaders were
running the country and were at
odds with the U.S. government,
said Laine.
U.S. officials did not believe that
using Haitian army bodyguards
during those three years presented
any threat to Swing, he said. Amer

icans were then considered among
the safest people in Haiti because
Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and his coup
partners knew that any violence
against the Americans could pro
voke a U.S. military response,
according to U.S. officials.
Under threat of U.S. invasion,
the coup leaders agreed to relin
quish power and permit the return
of democratically elected President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide in October.
In the Nov. 10 case, the gunman
flagged down the three embassy
employees and asked for a ride to
the embassy. They recognized him
and gave him a lift, according to one
official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
He forced them to drive to a res
idential suburb of Port-au-Prince
and shot each of them in the head.
