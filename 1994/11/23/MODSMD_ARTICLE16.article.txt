WHEN NEW STUDENTS
enter Stanford, they are
told that they are adults
and the University will treat them
accordingly. Defining this relation
ship and elaborating ways for both
parties to deal with each other
builds a foundation for efficient
communication and problem-solv
ing.
Similarly, the ASSU and Univer
sity should take the time to define
their relationship as well â€” and
determine whether the body that
represents the students can be just
as independent and responsible as
the students themselves.
Since the beginning of autumn
quarter, the ASSU has operated
without funding from the Univer
sity. This makes the ASSU essen
tially independent from the Uni
versity, since all its money comes
from fees and business revenues.
However, under the ASSU Consti
tution the administration has final
power over the budget, and accord
ing to Dean of Students Michael
Jackson the administration has
final authority over all ASSU mat
ters. Council of Presidents member

Mork Murdock, however, says the
ASSU is not governed by the Uni
versity.
Jackson and other University
officials have shown admirable
restraint in using their administra
tive review power. However, last
week ASSU undergraduate sena
tor Ed Malone asked various top
administrators to look into the
constitutionality of the senate's
resolution supporting Prop. 187.
While the senate may have over
stepped its bounds in passing such
a resolution, disgruntled senators
should not look to the administra
tion to settle internal ASSU issues.
But this incident shows the need
for the ASSU and the administra
tion to work together to clarify
exactly when and how much the
administration, which now has no
financial stake in student govern
ment, should be allowed to inter
vene in ASSU matters. In any
event, the administration's role in
the ASSU should be limited, for if
the University expects the ASSU
to be financially independent, it
needs to allow the ASSU to man
age its own political affairs as well.
