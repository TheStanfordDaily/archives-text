# Leave policy needed
## 
### 
Thanks to the efforts of
the Personal Leave for Gradu
ate Students Committee,
Stanford will soon have a clear poli
cy on maternity and paternity leave
for graduate students.
Although the University's
unwritten practices on leave have
been "humane, liberal and kind,''
according to Assoc. Dean of Gradu
ate Policy George Dekker, develop
ing official guidelines will eliminate
concerns and misunderstandings
some graduate students have had.
Without an official University
policy, many graduate students have
been unsure of the possible conse
quences of spending time away from
research and studies. For example,
the committee learned that some
students assumed wrongly that

they would lose campus housing
upon taking leave. A clear written
policy will give graduate students a
clear understanding of their options
and help eliminate such problems.
Dekker expressed worries that
even with the policy in place, stu
dents who take leave might jeopar
dize long-term research funding. To
combat these potential problems,
the University could build a coun
seling program through which grad
uate students could obtain advice on
how taking leave might affect their
academic work.
Regardless of these concerns, the
new policy will be a welcome addi
tion to graduate student life,
because with University policies, as
with babies, it is often better late
than never.
