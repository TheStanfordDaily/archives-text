## If only Picasso could dunk 
### 
A FEW WEEKS ago I attended my
first pro basketball game.
Though it was early in the sea
son — when no lineups are solid —
the play between the Golden State
Warriors and the Miami Heat was
incredible, something belonging to a
higher order of achievement.
One notices not only the players'
supreme stature — really a different
version of the human physique — but
also the fact that these are extraordi
nary acts transpiring on the court.
Others fall away as Glen Rice author
itatively moves to the hoop, as Keith
Jennings darts between the big men
or as Latrell Sprewell glides down the
court with what the jazz musicians
call swing.
In the presence of such beauty, the
crowd becomes wild. We call out, leap
forward out of our chairs, seeing
grace in each movement of strength
and agility and speed.
On the court I play on at Stanford,
the game leans more toward rough and
scramble. We realize that for us, the
grace of a Tim Hardaway is unattain
able. Jokingly, we sharpen our elbows
before we play, and when on occasion
the trash talk turns into trips to Cow
ell there are no technicals, but we feel
a heightened sense of significance.
Our previous pleasure in pure concen
tration or the slowed-down moment of
a lucky roll suddenly pales in compari

son to the serious rush of physical
injury. Acknowledging the mediocrity
of our skills, we find passion in playing
reckless and hard.
Someone will always say that
sports are a metaphor for life, and
they will always be right in the sense
that the metaphor is experience
intensified. The pain and exhilaration
of physical competition brings us
back to an essential vitality: us
against them, do or die. Sport takes
us higher, to a plane where acts are
exalted in isolation and immediately
rewarded.
I often wonder if such widespread
feelings of appreciation could ever
extend from basketball courts and
baseball stadiums to intellectual are
nas. What would happen if feats of
the mind garnered the same attention
as athletic ones, if the ability to solve
a problem or illuminate an idea
received the same response as a slam
dunk? The two occasions are striking
ly similar. Each requires both talent
and practice, and the intellectual, like
the athlete, must be possessed of
skill, intensity and a risky streak.
Most certainly, gifted thinkers move
in their own Oakland Coliseum,
where mental acts intersect with the
extraordinary. But perhaps there
does not yet exist the larger audience
which can recognize and share the
spontaneous experience of the mind's

grace.
And that recognition is crucial.
Pablo Picasso once said the idea of an
artist working solely for themselves
or for the love of art alone is a "false
idea." Artists, athletes and intellectu
als all need success, not only so that
they may survive, but so that the
work itself can be realized. Picasso
knew the majority often judges with
respect to success, not quality, and so
he set out to "prove that success can
be obtained without compromise,
even in opposition to prevailing doc
trines."
Intellectual success does not
require the flash tfnd commercialism
suffered by professional athletes. But
it does need fans and ardent support
ers. Imagine, just for a moment, a pre
vailing doctrine that marries the vital
urgency of sport with quieter thought,
where we anticipate and pursue intel
lectual questions with the savvy of a
Big Game crowd and the urgency of a
game of sudden death. I would buy a
ticket for that one.

Elizabeth Kelly has no comment as yet
on the Webber-Nelson ordeal; nor will
she take a stand in the Warhol-Wyeth
debate.
