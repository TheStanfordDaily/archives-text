# Keeping the debate over 187 alive
## Student group ponders ways to fight measure 
### Laura Shin Staff writer 
Last night, about 15 former
members of the STOP 187 organi
zation and other interested stu
dents began slowly sifting
through the group's goals and
clarifying its direction.
The group, which remains
nameless, is continuing its efforts
to fight the implementation of the
anti-immigration measure.
Students in the group are cur
rently planning to participate in a
rally on Dec. 10, the Internation
al Day of Action Against 187.
They are still unsure about
whether to attend the rally in San
Francisco or Los Angeles or
whether they should hold one
here at Stanford.
Individual members also may
participate in other meetings and
projects so they can help offer ad
vice and information on the ef
fects of 187.
The group, however, is still de
liberating over its general goals,
as it did at a meeting last week.
Students at that meeting sug
gested a range of new organiza
tional goals, from fighting racism
to fighting for immigrants' rights.
But eventually, the group of about
30 decided to shy away from the
general goal of fighting racism
and focus more on tactics to hin
der the implementation of Propo
sition 187.
Last night, however, the uncer
tainty of the group's future was
voiced again by sophomore Kris
Hayashi, who expressed frustra
tion at the continuing debate
about the group's purpose.

"We've had three meetings ...
where we've been talking about
goals," she said.
Senior Esther Conrad also
questioned how official the orga
nization was in terms of its
longevity and official status with
the University.
Hayashi agreed. "It's true that
we don't know what we are right
now," she said.
The group then discussed the
possibility of meeting specifically
to discuss their future as an orga
nization — separate from the
more administrative matters of
events and projects. However, no
date was set for that meeting.
In areas of more tangible ac
tion, the group has been keeping
in touch with other college cam
puses, such as Harvard and
Swarthmore, that want to begin
working against a federal anti-im
migration law similar to Proposi
tion 187.
In order to help these campus
es begin their work, the post-
STOP 187 organization will try to
create a packet outlining effective
arguments against the proposi
tion. It will also include lessons
they learned from their work prior
to the election.
The group also emphasized the
importance of keeping 187 "in the
media" and letting people know
"it's not a dead issue just because
it passed," sophomore Marianna
Aue said.
At last week's meeting, stu
dents introduced ideas for creat
ing documentaries to use in the
fight against the proposition.
student Mary Wu told the
group that she, along with fellow
law student Lauren Leslie, plans
to find out what illegal immigrants
"actually do with their lives." She
and Leslie will "put together their
stories" in the form of either a

paper or a documentary film.
Jon Blazer, another law stu
dent, suggested that the group
also document the types of abus
es that may occur as a result of
Proposition 187.
To help itself become more
structured and efficient, the
group also created a committee to
collect information on all the vol
unteers and input it into a
