Daily has fallen behind
other area newspapers
in local news coveraye
I have been aware for a while now on
how The Daily has been slow in report
ing news.
The murder of David Liu happened on
Nov. 13, and I read about it in the San
Jose Mercury News when it happened. It
took The Daily nine days to print it.
Really, what is going on? The Daily used
to break news that would end up in
msy'or newspapers, now it seems that you
cannot even check the wire on time.
Come on, Daily reporters! GO out

there and restore The Daily's reputa
tion. It's about time.

Gaieties scene drew a
stereotypical picture of
computer consultants
I noticed a disturbing trend that was
highlighted in this year's Gaieties. In
the LaIR scene, the consultant was a
loser who couldn't get women attracted
to him, and so he retreated to the world

of Cybersex. I would just like to show
how this stereotype, though perpetuated
by people everywhere, is inaccurate.
What the general public doesn't real
ize is that computer people do actually
have real lives (or at least, want them).
People should give us consultants a
chance. Most of us would rather make
love to a person than to a computer,
even if the computer happens to be one
of those studly Power Macs. I have never
seen anyone forgo sex for time logged
into the Internet.
Furthermore, Cybersex doesn't turn
me on. It may excite other consultants,
it may not. I've tried it once, but instead
of screaming in ecstasy, I was rofl (for
you non-computer geeks, rolling on the

floor laughing). Have you ever seen the
sexual material on the Internet? It's the
stuff that excites pubescent, angst-rid
den teenage boys, not intelligent,
mature individuals such as ourselves.
Most consultants are not cold fish
who would rather spend time with a
computer than with a significant other.
Give them a chance; ask them out on a
date. They may say no, but their rejec
tion is rarely due to the fact that they
would rather be e-mailing, reading
newsgroups or mudding.
