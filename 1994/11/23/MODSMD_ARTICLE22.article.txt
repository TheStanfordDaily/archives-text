## Around the world in an eight-day weekend

PARIS, France
I THINK IT was Mark Twain who said
he never let schooling interfere with
his education.
Had the author been a student at Stan
ford in Paris, the quotation might have
turned out a bit differently. Here, it
seems, students don't let their schooling
interfere with their travels across Europe.
Case in point: the All Saints' Day long
weekend in early November, when most of
the program's students fled Paris for des
tinations as exotic as Morocco and
Budapest, many skipping classes before
and after the break to extend their trips.
This exodus (which happens most
weekends on a more limited scale) brings
up an interesting debate. Is traveling
through Europe really educational? Do
the gains outweigh the losses from missed
classes and wasted tuition? And is it worth
neglecting the most interesting city in the
world (Paris) just to spend a day or two
trying to take in all the sights of another?
The answers to these questions are not
simple, but it is helpful to try to meld
them into a broader one: what is the pur

pose of a university overseas program?
The answer to that, of course, depends on
whom you ask.
Anyone can recite the standard line
from their application essays (and overseas
program descriptions) — that studying
abroad gives them a chance to "immerse"
themselves in another culture. Most will
probably add that they want to learn under
a different system of education. Some
might even say that overseas study lets
them pursue academic interests.
All these sound good but belie a com
mon underlying intention: to enjoy a
break from the academic strain of Stan
ford. To put it bluntly, many students are
here to have a good time. Whether you
approve or not, it's hard to blame them
considering the incredible variety of
nonacademic opportunities available. And
the opportunity to travel around Europe
is the hardest one to resist.
Armed with a Eurail pass and a "Let's
Go" guide, you can train to most Old
World cities overnight, find inexpensive
accommodations the next morning and
take in the sights over the weekend. (The

more adventurous might try to skip the
accommodations by taking a night train to
their next destination.) Discovering new
cultures, meeting fellow travelers and
learning to be more independent helps you
build memories for a lifetime — and take
plenty of pictures to keep everyone at
home happy.
Is there anything wrong with this pen
chant for travel? On the surface, no. A
term abroad in college offers the rare
chance to see a new part of the world with
out many of the responsibilities that
might hinder such a trip later. You'd be
foolish to pass up the opportunity.
Or maybe not. A two-day visit is not
the best way to discover a new city, let
alone another country. And with longer
trips, the tradeoff between academics and
traveling comes into play — and the
answer becomes even less clear. Is it
worth skipping a French class to spend an
extra day in Vienna? What about missing
several classes to extend a four-day break
to a week's worth of sightseeing? Judg
ment calls like these are hard to make,
but students here have been voting with

their feet. They are saying yes in large
numbers.
At a program meeting a few weeks ago,
the director of Stanford in Paris tried her
best to dissuade students from extensive
traveling at the expense of academics.
Why not travel over vacations, she asked,
instead of during the quarter, when there
is so much to experience here?
A good question. Here's an answer:
even in a city as diverse and exciting as
Paris, you are going to want to get away
after a while. The program here offers lit
tle in terms of weekend activities (the
fust group trip is not until Nov. 19), so
it's natural to expect students to find
their own means of escape. Missed classes
are simply a side effect — after spending a
dozen hours on a train to get somewhere,
no one is going to want to go back after
just a day or two. And who wants to deal
with coordinating trips over vacations
when it's so easy to find people to travel
with during the quarter?
Traveling, then, seems to be inevitable.
But on the other hand, empty desks on
Monday mornings don't exactly add to the

program's academic atmosphere.
What can be done? First, Overseas
Studies needs to accept that some stu
dent traveling is inevitable and should
try to accommodate that wish without
lowering academic standards. Some sug
gestions: more group weekend trips and
perhaps changes in the academic sched
ule to create an official mid-quarter
break to let students get traveling out of
their system. (It would also make sense
if Paris students had the normal long
weekend over Thanksgiving.)
Strong academics and weekend travel
ing, it seems, can exist together. I'll end
with an example: At the beginning of the
quarter, two of my classes were scheduled
on Friday. After a couple weeks and
requests from students, they had both
been changed to Thursday. Stanford in
Paris seems to be listening.

Matt wishes he had skipped French class
to spend that extra day in Vienna. He
assures Prof. Berman that he is having a
good time in Paris.
