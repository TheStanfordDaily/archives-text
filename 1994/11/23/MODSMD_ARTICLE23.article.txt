Fake e-mail alarms campus women
Bogus electronic mail messages have unnecessarily alarmed many
female staff and students, according to Stanford Police.
The messages warn women of killings, rapes and abductions by
knifepoint at the Valley Fair and Vallco shopping malls in San Jose,
said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer. The fake messages have
appeared recently on the Leland and Forsythe networks causing
alarm among female University staff.
"We are getting swamped with inquires from women who are
taken by this rumor," Niemeyer said.
Christine Fiksdal, administrative assistant in the School of Engi
neering, received the e-mail warning and immediately realized it was
false. "I reported it because it appeared bogus," Fiksdal said.
The lack of names or dates in the messages and the fact that the
attacks described always seemed to happen to "a friend of a friend"
made the messages appear suspicious, she said. In addition, Fiksdal
said the assertion that Valley Fair, the police and the media were try
ing to suppress news of the attacks also bothered her.
Niemeyer initiated an e-mail advisory alerting women of the false
e-mail claims on both the Leland and Forsythe networks last Friday.
Driverless truck changes parking spaces
A parked car speeds down an incline and crashes straight into
another car. While the scenario sounds like something that only hap
pens in the movies, junior Anthony Homan encountered a real ver
sion of it in the Kappa Alpha parking lot.

According to Homan, the owner of the pick-up truck that hit his
car on Saturday, Nov. 12 forgot to set the emergency break when he
parked in the Lambda Nu parking.
The truck "slipped out of gear, out of the Lambda Nu parking lot
. . . and hit my car," Homan said.
Homan said he attempted to find the owner at the party in the
Lambda Nu house to prevent the truck from being impounded but
met with opposition from Lambda Nu residents.
The next day, however, Homan said he noticed "Get â€¢ Life" keyed
into the driver side door of his Ford Probe. He suspects that the same
people who prevented him from finding the owner of the pick-up per
petrated the incident.
Homan said he can only assume they thought he had bad inten
tions when in fact he was trying to prevent the truck from being
impounded.
The evening of the incident, Homan said he even offered the owner
of the truck a ride to get his vehicle when he noticed him frantically
looking around for his missing pick-up.
Full keg found at Oregon game
Police reports indicate that a full keg of beer was found near Gate 12
at Stanford Stadium just before the last home game against Oregon.
Authorities said they suspect people brought it to the stadium the
Friday night before the game and decided not to drink it.
According to the police record, police deputies found it and brought
it to the station "for safekeeping."
No one has filed a claim for the keg, police said.
