## DNA 'bridges' link world's peoples Genetic diversity project gaining momentum despite opposition 
### Dev Nag 
In an effort to determine genetic
variation among the world's differ
ent peoples, Stanford geneticist Luigi
Luca Cavalli-Sforza and Stanford
law professor Henry Greely are pro
moting the Human Genome Diversi
ty Project (HGDP) to examine DNA
samples from populations around
the globe.
Three years ago, Cavalli-Sforza
became increasingly concerned
about the "vanishing opportunity to
preserve a record of our genetic her
itage." In response, the Human
Genome Organization and other gov
ernment agencies agreed to fund a
survey of the genetic diversity among
the world's peoples.
Greely, chair of the project's
North American Ethics Committee,

became involved in the project after
meeting Cavalli-Sforza at a confer
ence two years ago.
Unlike the highly publicized
Human Genome Project, which will
examine the DNA of a few U.S. and
European scientists, the Human
Genome Diversity Project would
study the genetic variance of the
human race as a whole.
Almost immediately, organiza
tions began protesting the HGDP as
racist, elitist, and unethical. Sur
prised by these objections, scientists
have placed the project on hold until
the end of this year, when the pro
ject's International Executive Com
mittee, headed by Cavalli-Sforza, will
release a document presenting a pro
ject outline.
The project will be reviewed again
by organizations such as the Interna

tional Bioethics Committee and the
U.S. National Academy of Sciences.
According to Greely, the purpose
of the HDGP is multifaceted. The
investigation has historical, sociologi
cal and medical significance.
The anthropological angle is the
most exciting to Greely. "You can fig
ure out how closely different popula
tions are related by how similar they
are genetically, on average. That
helps you figure out things about
human history, and how close people
are as cousins," he said.
Greely offered several examples.
"Where Native Americans came
from in Asia, how Polynesians
spread through Polynesia—genetics
offers one more line of evidence to try
to answer those questions," he said.
Some scientists hope that the pro
ject will resolve long-term anthropo

logical questions as well, such as
whether homo sapiens evolved in one
place or in different parts of the
world.
The project also offers the possi
bility of "learning a lot more about
genetically related diseases in popu
lations that haven't been heavily
studied," Greely said. "By having lots
of DNA samples from a variety of dif
ferent populations, we may be able to
find genetic links or cures for disease
that occur more frequently in some
populations than others," he
explained.
HGDP may also even out the
financial inequity of medical genetic
research around the world. Greely
cites cystic fibrosis as the most com
mon fatal genetic disease in America
and Europe, countries with wealthy
scientific resources. "It has been
studied a lot," he said. "There's a lot
of American money and European
money available for studying [cystic
fibrosis]."
Genetic diseases in other countries
have been studied less. "This [project]
makes it easier for people to study the
genetics of diseases in non-European
groups," Greely said.
Vocal minority groups have
argued against the project, express
ing special concern for intellectual
property rights. In Greely's words,
minorities were worried that scien
tists "were going to study other peo
ple's genes in order to make drugs
and make a lot of money."
Another concern Ls that scientists
will be able to create targeted biologi
cal warfare against specific races.
According to Greely, these worries
are unfounded. "There's no gene
that makes someone Irish or Viet
namese or Navajo or anything else,"
he said.
Populations are characterized by
given traits, not by discrete genetic
disparities. "Ethnic groups are social
constructs; they're not biological con
structs," Greely said. "The social con

struct of race or ethnicity or national
ity doesn't have any significant genet
ic connections."
The human genome contains
about 10,000 genes, almost all of
which are identical in all humans.
The average genetic difference
between two randomly selected
humans is about a tenth of a per
cent — one base pair for every
thousand. And among different
peoples, individual variation
greatly outweighs any type of
'racial' differences. For example, a
white European may be a far bet
ter tissue match for an African
American than another African
American.
Greely criticized the idea that the
HGDP would use DNA to "clone peo
ple and turn them into slaves and
warriors. Again, scientifically absurd.
Jurassic Park is not available."
While he said he empathizes with
such considerations and under
stands that people may be suspicious,
concerned, and worried, Greely has
his own concerns that present simi
lar difficulties.
For example, one is the issue of

informed consent "If you go to the
jungles of the Amazon and want a
DNA sample of a population that
doesn't know anything about genes,
doesn't know anything about science,
doesn't speak English, Spanish, or
Portuguese, you're going to have
problems explaining the project," he
admitted.
What disturbs Greely most
strongly is the possibility of racist
misuse. "Genetics doesn't have a
real good track record over the last
centuiy in terms of racist misuse."
He said that while the geneticists
involved in the project are only
hopeful that the project will demon
strate how biologically meaningless
race is, it is still possible that some
body will use information out of
context or inappropriately for racist
purposes.
The project has already begun
gathering DNA samples in Europe
and China. Other committees
around the globe have completed
their planning stages. The North
American Committee hopes to begin
soon after the project receives
approval from examining boards.

logical questions as well, such as
whether homo sapiens evolved in one
place or in different parts of the
world.
The project also offers the possi
bility of "learning a lot more about
genetically related diseases in popu
lations that haven't been heavily
studied," Greely said. "By having lots
of DNA samples from a variety of dif
ferent populations, we may be able to
find genetic links or cures for disease
that occur more frequently in some
populations than others," he
explained.
HGDP may also even out the
financial inequity of medical genetic
research around the world. Greely
cites cystic fibrosis as the most com
mon fatal genetic disease in America
and Europe, countries with wealthy
scientific resources. "It has been
studied a lot," he said. "There's a lot
of American money and European
money available for studying [cystic
fibrosis]."
Genetic diseases in other countries
have been studied less. "This [project]
makes it easier for people to study the
genetics of diseases in non-European
groups," Greely said.
Vocal minority groups have
argued against the project, express
ing special concern for intellectual
property rights. In Greely's words,
minorities were worried that scien
tists "were going to study other peo
ple's genes in order to make drugs
and make a lot of money."
Another concern Ls that scientists
will be able to create targeted biologi
cal warfare against specific races.
According to Greely, these worries
are unfounded. "There's no gene
that makes someone Irish or Viet
namese or Navajo or anything else,"
he said.
Populations are characterized by
given traits, not by discrete genetic
disparities. "Ethnic groups are social
constructs; they're not biological con
structs," Greely said. "The social con

struct of race or ethnicity or national
ity doesn't have any significant genet
ic connections."
The human genome contains
about 10,000 genes, almost all of
which are identical in all humans.
The average genetic difference
between two randomly selected
humans is about a tenth of a per
cent — one base pair for every
thousand. And among different
peoples, individual variation
greatly outweighs any type of
'racial' differences. For example, a
white European may be a far bet
ter tissue match for an African
American than another African
American.
Greely criticized the idea that the
HGDP would use DNA to "clone peo
ple and turn them into slaves and
warriors. Again, scientifically absurd.
Jurassic Park is not available."
While he said he empathizes with
such considerations and under
stands that people may be suspicious,
concerned, and worried, Greely has
his own concerns that present simi
lar difficulties.
For example, one is the issue of

informed consent "If you go to the
jungles of the Amazon and want a
DNA sample of a population that
doesn't know anything about genes,
doesn't know anything about science,
doesn't speak English, Spanish, or
Portuguese, you're going to have
problems explaining the project," he
admitted.
What disturbs Greely most
strongly is the possibility of racist
misuse. "Genetics doesn't have a
real good track record over the last
centuiy in terms of racist misuse."
He said that while the geneticists
involved in the project are only
hopeful that the project will demon
strate how biologically meaningless
race is, it is still possible that some
body will use information out of
context or inappropriately for racist
purposes.
The project has already begun
gathering DNA samples in Europe
and China. Other committees
around the globe have completed
their planning stages. The North
American Committee hopes to begin
soon after the project receives
approval from examining boards.

In an effort to determine genetic
variation among the world's differ
ent peoples, Stanford geneticist Luigi
Luca Cavalli-Sforza and Stanford
law professor Henry Greely are pro
moting the Human Genome Diversi
ty Project (HGDP) to examine DNA
samples from populations around
the globe.
Three years ago, Cavalli-Sforza
became increasingly concerned
about the "vanishing opportunity to
preserve a record of our genetic her
itage." In response, the Human
Genome Organization and other gov
ernment agencies agreed to fund a
survey of the genetic diversity among
the world's peoples.
Greely, chair of the project's
North American Ethics Committee,

became involved in the project after
meeting Cavalli-Sforza at a confer
ence two years ago.
Unlike the highly publicized
Human Genome Project, which will
examine the DNA of a few U.S. and
European scientists, the Human
Genome Diversity Project would
study the genetic variance of the
human race as a whole.
Almost immediately, organiza
tions began protesting the HGDP as
racist, elitist, and unethical. Sur
prised by these objections, scientists
have placed the project on hold until
the end of this year, when the pro
ject's International Executive Com
mittee, headed by Cavalli-Sforza, will
release a document presenting a pro
ject outline.
The project will be reviewed again
by organizations such as the Interna

tional Bioethics Committee and the
U.S. National Academy of Sciences.
According to Greely, the purpose
of the HDGP is multifaceted. The
investigation has historical, sociologi
cal and medical significance.
The anthropological angle is the
most exciting to Greely. "You can fig
ure out how closely different popula
tions are related by how similar they
are genetically, on average. That
helps you figure out things about
human history, and how close people
are as cousins," he said.
Greely offered several examples.
"Where Native Americans came
from in Asia, how Polynesians
spread through Polynesia—genetics
offers one more line of evidence to try
to answer those questions," he said.
Some scientists hope that the pro
ject will resolve long-term anthropo

logical questions as well, such as
whether homo sapiens evolved in one
place or in different parts of the
world.
The project also offers the possi
bility of "learning a lot more about
genetically related diseases in popu
lations that haven't been heavily
studied," Greely said. "By having lots

ferent populations, we may be able to

explained.
