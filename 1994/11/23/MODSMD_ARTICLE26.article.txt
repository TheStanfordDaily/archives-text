â€”burning in Branner
A :What! Have they actually
JLAstarted putting spice in food
service meals? Or did you just over
dose on those little salsa packets at
Taco Bell during your last run for
the border?

Chemically, chili peppers are
one of the most interesting foods
you can find. The substance that
actually makes them hot is known
as capsaicin, an amazingly power-

ful and stable chemicaL If
you put a single drop of
capsaicin in fifty gallons
of water, it would still
burn your mouth badly.
Even in five hundred gal
lons of water, you would
still feel the pain.
While it may light
your tongue on fire, cap
saicin itself has no flavor,
color or odor. The chemi
cal is unaffected by heat
or cold and does not dis
solve in water. This
explains why pounding
water won't help stop the
pain of a chili pepper

burn.
Capsaicin causes burning by
directly triggering pain receptors,
which then release a chemical mes
senger called substance P. (The P
stands for pain. .. isn't that
clever?) Substance P is used by the
nervous system to notify the brain
of any type of pain, whether it is
from an injury, a headache, or just
too many jalapenos.
What is even more interesting
is that capsaicin actually uses all of
the substance Pin the pain recep
tors. After the initial intense burn
ing, chemical amounts in the
receptors diminish and further
pain signals decrease.
Because capsaicin is the only
known chemical that is capable
of depleting substance Pin this
manner, it has been used medi
cally to block pain. Capsaicin is
particularly useful in phantom
limb syndrome. Victims of this
disease experience intense pain
where their amputated limbs
used to be. Because the itch and
pain pathways both use sub
stance P, capsaicin also serves as
an anti-itch medication.
When the body senses pain, it
produces endorphins, a family of

chemicals similar to morphine,
which serve as natural pain-killers
that also induce a general feeling of
well-being. (Endorphins are also
responsible for the 'runner's
high'). Scientists have suggested
that people eat chili peppers to
stimulate the release of endor
phins just as some people run in
order to get the sense of relaxation.
Another study concluded that
people like to eat chili peppers
because it is a 'constrained ride', a

thrill just like bungee jumping or
riding a roller coaster.
Other researchers propose
more interesting conclusions. Dr.
Andrew Weil claimed that chili

pepper eaters "glide
along on the strong
stimulation, experienc
ing it as something
between pleasure and
pain that brings about a
high state of conscious
ness. This technique
might be called 'mouth
surfing'."
In addition to
any supposed psychoac
tive effects, chili pep
pers actually have some
nutritional benefits.
They are very high in
vitamins A and C.
Spanish sailors used to

take chili peppers along on voyages
to prevent scurvy, much like
British sailors who used to take cit
rus fruits, leading to the nickname
'limeys.'
Elating chili peppers can also
cause profuse sweating. It has been
suggested that the cooling caused
by this sweating is the reason chili
peppers are consumed primarily in
tropical regions.
Now say your mouth is burn
ing. What is the best way to reme
dy this fiery situation? Since cap
saicin does not dissolve in water,
dairy products offer the best solu
tion. In a 1989 study, volunteers
chewed a chili pepper for one
minute then tried various cures.
The testers judged that milk
was twice as effective as water,
olive oil, and fruit syrup, and
slightly better than glycerol.
(Thank you, I'll take the milk
rather than the glycerol.) Starchy
foods, such as bread and rice, are
also pretty good at absorbing cap
saicin and relieving the burp.
So you thought chi'i peppers
were just good for spL*a. Little did
you know they "./ould introduce
you to the world of morphine and
mouth surfing.
