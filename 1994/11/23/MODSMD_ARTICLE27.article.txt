# Tiny satellite may gather data in space
## Picosats would measure solar and atmospheric phenomena 
### Jeremy Thibeaux 
Imagine a satellite that gathers informa
tion in the outer reaches of earth's atmo
sphere yet still fits in the palm of your hand.
This vision could become a reality at
Stanford as graduate students in the
Department of Aeronautics .and Astronau
tics are crafting a satellite the size of a silver
dollar as part of a course in miniature space
craft design.
Jet Propulsion Laboratories (JPL) in Los
Angeles has commissioned the project as a
response to NASA's interest in smaller
spacecraft. The growing interest reflects the
space agency's need to downsize in the face
of budget cuts.
"What JPL discovered was that none of
their labs had ever worked on a satellite so
small," said Tom Kenny, assistant professor
of mechanical engineering. "They wanted to
get a fresh perspective," he added.
The design effort, headed by Kenny and
Prof. Robert Twiggs, director of the Satel
lite Systems Development Laboratory,
hinges on the work of several graduate stu
dents. "We have always envisioned the
picosat [miniature satellite] to be shaped
like a hockey puck," explained Jason Such
man, a graduate student working on the
project.
Weighing approximately 20 grams, this
satellite—called a picosat or free flying mag
netometer — will be used to measure mag
netic field intensities at various points in
the magnetosphere, the outer reaches of the
ionosphere where the earth's magnetic field
controls the motion of charged particles.
However, Twiggs said that actual con
struction of the satellites has not started
yet. "We won't start with this class,. . . but
we may be able to build a prototype picosat
in the spring," he explained.
A thousand of these 'baby' silver dollar
satellites will be transported into the atmo
sphere inside the 100 kilogram 'mother'
satellite; the picosats will be released in
groups of 10 at different times during the
carrier satellite's orbit. They will supply a
three-dimensional picture of the earth's
magnetic field to scientists on earth.
Although the mother satellite may be in
orbit for one or two years, the picosats will
only take readings of the magnetic field at
specified times. "At other times, it [the moth
er satellite] will be orbiting, waiting to mea
sure an event like a solar flare," Twiggs said.
The mother satellite remains in highly
elliptical orbit around the earth, receives
data transmissions from the picosats, and
transmits the data back to earth when the
satellite is within range of the planet.
The miniature satellites would travel
tens of kilometers from the 'mother,' and
gather data for 10 hours before burning up
in the earth's atmosphere.
To address the different aspects of satel
lite design, the students divided into sever
al teams studying issues of power, commu
nications, space environment, electronics,
launch dynamics, attitude dynamics, and
materials.

Although they are still being developed,
solid-state, thin-film batteries may be the
optimal power source; they are small with a
relatively high energy density and an
acceptable operating temperature range.
Most of the alternatives are either too
bulky, lack enough output, have too narrow
an operating temperature, or are sensitive
to lack of sunlight.
A one-way communication link will carry
approximately 20 to 200 bytes per second
between the picosat and the mother satel
lite. After researching several possibilities
for the link, the student team selected radio
communication as the best alternative.
The electronics group devised a scheme to
use thin, circular wafers for all of the cir
cuitry. These wafers would be integrated
with the thin-film batteries, which could
also be molded into the circular wafer shape.
Under the current design, the picosat will
be deployed from the mother satellite with a
spinning motion. The picosat will spin away
from the mother satellite with only one face
directed towards the carrier at all times.
The spinning motion gives the picosat a
more stable flight in much the same way a
spinning top stays upright. If the picosat
becomes disoriented by a small particle
floating in space, it may return to face its
original direction due to the torque supplied
by the spin.
Since one face of the picosat is always

directed at the mother satellite, a more
focused radio frequency antenna can reduce
the amount of power required by the trans
mitter.
The research team developed two plau
sible designs for the picosat launching
mechanism. In one method, a turntable
starts the satellite spinning, then the satel
lite is ejected after achieving the desired
rotation speed. The other design uses a
motor and a worm gear, or a threaded
cylindrical rod, to supply a spinning push
to the satellite.
After the picosats are released from the
mother, they must maintain attitude, or
flight stability. The spinning motion
imparted to the miniature satellite during
the launch may be sufficient to keep it sta
ble during flight; the picosat may not be eas
ily manipulated, or its attitude easily con
trolled, after its ejection form the mother.
Kenny, Twiggs, and the students work
ing on the free flying magnetometer project
traveled to Los Angeles last Friday, Novem
ber 18, where the students presented their
ideas to JPL.
"This was an exploratory visit [to JPL],"
Twiggs said. "The students were able to
visit with scientists interested in the project
to get more explicit details on what would be
acceptable data," he added. The students
will head south again on December 9 with
revised plans for the satellite project.

Imagine a satellite that gathers informa
tion in the outer reaches of earth's atmo
sphere yet still fits in the palm of your hand.
This vision could become a reality at
Stanford as graduate students in the
Department of Aeronautics .and Astronau
tics are crafting a satellite the size of a silver
dollar as part of a course in miniature space
craft design.
Jet Propulsion Laboratories (JPL) in Los
Angeles has commissioned the project as a
response to NASA's interest in smaller
spacecraft. The growing interest reflects the
space agency's need to downsize in the face
of budget cuts.
"What JPL discovered was that none of
their labs had ever worked on a satellite so
small," said Tom Kenny, assistant professor
of mechanical engineering. "They wanted to
get a fresh perspective," he added.
The design effort, headed by Kenny and
Prof. Robert Twiggs, director of the Satel
lite Systems Development Laboratory,
hinges on the work of several graduate stu
dents. "We have always envisioned the
picosat [miniature satellite] to be shaped
like a hockey puck," explained Jason Such
man, a graduate student working on the
project.
Weighing approximately 20 grams, this
satellite—called a picosat or free flying mag
netometer — will be used to measure mag
netic field intensities at various points in
the magnetosphere, the outer reaches of the
ionosphere where the earth's magnetic field
controls the motion of charged particles.
However, Twiggs said that actual con
struction of the satellites has not started
yet. "We won't start with this class,. . . but
we may be able to build a prototype picosat
in the spring," he explained.
A thousand of these 'baby' silver dollar
satellites will be transported into the atmo
sphere inside the 100 kilogram 'mother'
satellite; the picosats will be released in
groups of 10 at different times during the
carrier satellite's orbit. They will supply a
three-dimensional picture of the earth's
magnetic field to scientists on earth.
Although the mother satellite may be in
orbit for one or two years, the picosats will
only take readings of the magnetic field at
specified times. "At other times, it [the moth
er satellite] will be orbiting, waiting to mea
sure an event like a solar flare," Twiggs said.
The mother satellite remains in highly
elliptical orbit around the earth, receives
data transmissions from the picosats, and
transmits the data back to earth when the
satellite is within range of the planet.
The miniature satellites would travel
tens of kilometers from the 'mother,' and
gather data for 10 hours before burning up
in the earth's atmosphere.
To address the different aspects of satel
lite design, the students divided into sever
al teams studying issues of power, commu
nications, space environment, electronics,
launch dynamics, attitude dynamics, and
materials.

Although they are still being developed,
solid-state, thin-film batteries may be the
optimal power source; they are small with a
relatively high energy density and an
acceptable operating temperature range.
Most of the alternatives are either too
bulky, lack enough output, have too narrow
an operating temperature, or are sensitive
to lack of sunlight.
A one-way communication link will carry
approximately 20 to 200 bytes per second
between the picosat and the mother satel
lite. After researching several possibilities
for the link, the student team selected radio
communication as the best alternative.
The electronics group devised a scheme to
use thin, circular wafers for all of the cir
cuitry. These wafers would be integrated
with the thin-film batteries, which could
also be molded into the circular wafer shape.
Under the current design, the picosat will
be deployed from the mother satellite with a
spinning motion. The picosat will spin away
from the mother satellite with only one face
directed towards the carrier at all times.
The spinning motion gives the picosat a
more stable flight in much the same way a
spinning top stays upright. If the picosat
becomes disoriented by a small particle
floating in space, it may return to face its
original direction due to the torque supplied
by the spin.
Since one face of the picosat is always

directed at the mother satellite, a more
focused radio frequency antenna can reduce
the amount of power required by the trans
mitter.
The research team developed two plau
sible designs for the picosat launching
mechanism. In one method, a turntable
starts the satellite spinning, then the satel
lite is ejected after achieving the desired
rotation speed. The other design uses a
motor and a worm gear, or a threaded
cylindrical rod, to supply a spinning push
to the satellite.
After the picosats are released from the
mother, they must maintain attitude, or
flight stability. The spinning motion
imparted to the miniature satellite during
the launch may be sufficient to keep it sta
ble during flight; the picosat may not be eas
ily manipulated, or its attitude easily con
trolled, after its ejection form the mother.
