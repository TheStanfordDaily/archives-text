## Water polo to shoot for NCAA title 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
At its final practice before traveling to Long Beach,
Calif., for the 1994 NCAA championship tournament,
the Stanford water polo team was loose and relaxed.
Heading into the season finale, the top-ranked Car
dinal (24-1) has proven that it is the team to beat this
weekend. Two months have passed since the team suf
fered its only loss of the campaign at the hands of Cal
ifornia by a 12-11 count in overtime.
"This team is confident and cocky," coach Dante
Dettamanti said. "So far, it hasn't hurt them. It's pos
itive because we have confidence that we will beat any
one. The negative may be that we could overlook an
opponent."
Stanford, which has remained No. 1 in the coaches'
poll all year, received the tournament's top seeding.
The Cardinal will open play with a first-round game
Friday against eighth-seeded Air Force (18-9).
The match will come as the first meeting between
the two teams this season. Both squads were recipi
ents of automatic bids to the national championships
due to victories at their respective conference tourna
ments — Stanford in the Mountain-Pacific Sports
Federation and Air Force in the Western Water Polo
Association.
Stanford's balanced offensive attack, which has
produced over 12 goals a game, will be difficult for the

Falcons to contain. Senior Wolf
Wigo has enjoyed the greatest
offensive season of his career.
The four-year starter led the
team in scoring with 46 goals as
a freshman and 42 as a sopho
more. Despite an injured back,
Wigo managed 44 points last
year, third best on the team.
This season, the three-time Ail-
American has already amassed
65 points.
Other top scorers for Stan
ford include junior Jeremy
Laster (49 points), senior Frank
Schneider (46) and sophomore
Brian Wallin (44). Defensively,
junior goalkeeper Jack Bowen
has collected 205 saves.
Air Force is led offensively
by Brian Pendergrass and

Jason Rischel, who scored the
game winner in the WWPA
final, a 6-5 victory over UC-San
Diego.
Other first-round matchups
include No. 2 USC (17-6) vs.
No. 7 Navy (25-5), No. 3 Cali
fornia (19-9) vs. No. 6 Mas
sachusetts (30-6) and No. 4
Pepperdine (15-8) vs. No. 5
UCLA (16-12).
If it prevails against Air
Force, the Cardinal will meet
the winner of the Pepperdine-
UCLA match on Saturday
night. The national champi
onship match will take place at
4:30 p.m. Sunday.
According to Dettamanti, the
most critical match of the week
end will be the semi-final Sat
urday. "The semi-final is the
most important game," he said.
"In the finals, you don't have to
worry about getting people
psyched up. In the semis, you

don't want to get caught look
ing ahead."
In last year's tournament,
the Cardinal played evenly with
UC-Irvine in the semi-finals
and USC in the final before
breaking both games open in
the third periods. The team has
continued that trend this year,
outscoring its opponents 83-50
in third quarters this season.
Last Saturday at Berkeley,
the Cardinal used a 3-0 third
period to open up an 8-4 lead en
route to winning the Big Splash
by a score of 9-7. The victory
gave Stanford a 2-1 record over
the Golden Bears and boosted
the confidence of the talented
Cardinal squad.
"Winning the Big Splash like
that at their pool was good for
us," Wigo said. "We want to
carry the momentum of that
victory with us through the
NCAAs."
