### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
At its final practice before traveling to Long Beach,
Calif., for the 1994 NCAA championship tournament,
the Stanford water polo team was loose and relaxed.
Heading into the season finale, the top-ranked Car
dinal (24-1) has proven that it is the team to beat this
weekend. Two months have passed since the team suf
fered its only loss of the campaign at the hands of Cal
ifornia by a 12-11 count in overtime.
"This team is confident and cocky," coach Dante
Dettamanti said. "So far, it hasn't hurt them. It's pos
itive because we have confidence that we will beat any
one. The negative may be that we could overlook an
opponent."
Stanford, which has remained No. 1 in the coaches'
poll all year, received the tournament's top seeding.
The Cardinal will open play with a first-round game
Friday against eighth-seeded Air Force (18-9).
The match will come as the first meeting between
the two teams this season. Both squads were recipi
ents of automatic bids to the national championships
due to victories at their respective conference tourna
ments — Stanford in the Mountain-Pacific Sports
Federation and Air Force in the Western Water Polo
Association.
Stanford's balanced offensive attack, which has
produced over 12 goals a game, will be difficult for the
