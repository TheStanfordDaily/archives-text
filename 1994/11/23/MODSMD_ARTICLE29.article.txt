One look at the disconsolate
Bill Walsh after Big Game on
Saturday and I don't know
whether or not to call his bluff
anymore.

After all, last year's rumor
was diffused within a day.
Walsh came out and said, "No,
I'm not retiring you goobers.
What have you people been
smoking?" Or something like
that.
This year we start with a
very young team, we have
another horrible season, we
lose another Big Game and the
next thing you know, Bill
Walsh is retiring — again.
The frightening thing is that
instead of denying the rumors,
Walsh is being very difficult
this year.
Every day the Genius looks
up another synonym for the
word "maybe" and feeds it to
the blood-thirsty media. That is
some lexiconic feat, considering
the rumor has been steadily

gaining steam for at least a
week and a half.
Mum's the word around the
Athletic Department. Dumb's
the word everywhere else —
including the snooping media.
No one knows what's going on,
and the next press conference
isn't until Tuesday.
In a situation like this, you
must ask not what your foot
ball program can do for you,
but instead grovel your butt off
in hopes that Bill Walsh really
reads your columns.
Desper ate times call for des
perate measures and 'tis the
season for some serious
Thanksgiving groveling.
Hey Bill, how can you possi
bly stomach watching an unde
feated Joe Paterno at the Rose
Bowl this Jan. 2, while you sift
through travel brochures and
contemplate seeing the world
on some Carnival Cruise Line
before investing in a heinous
gas-guzzling Winnebago and
road-tripping across the heart
land of America until you reach
the tourist-friendly state of
Florida?
Next thing you know,
instead of designing post pat
terns, you'll be reduced to writ
ing letters to that big fat Snap
pie lady asking lame questions
like, "If I drink my peach iced
