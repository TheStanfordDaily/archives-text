# Please don't quit, Bill. I beg of you.
## 
### 
One look at the disconsolate
Bill Walsh after Big Game on
Saturday and I don't know
whether or not to call his bluff
anymore.

After all, last year's rumor
was diffused within a day.
Walsh came out and said, "No,
I'm not retiring you goobers.
What have you people been
smoking?" Or something like
that.
This year we start with a
very young team, we have
another horrible season, we
lose another Big Game and the
next thing you know, Bill
Walsh is retiring — again.
The frightening thing is that
instead of denying the rumors,
Walsh is being very difficult
this year.
Every day the Genius looks
up another synonym for the
word "maybe" and feeds it to
the blood-thirsty media. That is
some lexiconic feat, considering
the rumor has been steadily

gaining steam for at least a
week and a half.
Mum's the word around the
Athletic Department. Dumb's
the word everywhere else —
including the snooping media.
No one knows what's going on,
and the next press conference
isn't until Tuesday.
In a situation like this, you
must ask not what your foot
ball program can do for you,
but instead grovel your butt off
in hopes that Bill Walsh really
reads your columns.
Desper ate times call for des
perate measures and 'tis the
season for some serious
Thanksgiving groveling.
Hey Bill, how can you possi
bly stomach watching an unde
feated Joe Paterno at the Rose
Bowl this Jan. 2, while you sift
through travel brochures and
contemplate seeing the world
on some Carnival Cruise Line
before investing in a heinous
gas-guzzling Winnebago and
road-tripping across the heart
land of America until you reach
the tourist-friendly state of
Florida?
Next thing you know,
instead of designing post pat
terns, you'll be reduced to writ
ing letters to that big fat Snap
pie lady asking lame questions
like, "If I drink my peach iced


Kathryn
Yang
tea really, really fast will I still get
that brown gunk on the bottom of
the bottle?"
Two years ago, Stanford crushed
the Lions 24-3 in the Blockbuster
Bowl, but in 1994, Paterno moves
onto greener pastures and Walsh
just puts himself out to pasture.
Hey Bill, if you're still losing
sleep over that two-point non-con
version at Big Game, forget about
it. That was the least memorable
game in the history of college foot
ball. By this time next year, that
play will only be a footnote in the
record books.
"Fourth quarter, Stanford —
Allen 1 run (pass failed) at 2:06."
Truly harmless.
And without getting into that,
"Bill you're the absolute coolest,
damn near Greatest, creme de la

creme football coach ever to grace the
ranks of the NFL and the NCAA" bit
and completely embarrassing
myself, I'll just take it a step further
and really piss off God by heaping
mounds of undisguised spiritual adu
lation and possibly performing
minor animal sacrifices in deifying
you as the greatest ever, period.
Can't you see that I'm groveling
as hard as I can?
But seriously, who am I kidding?
Why would you even take any of my
suggestions into consideration
while you lounge around this long
weekend, digesting the remains of
your Thanksgiving dinner and
picking at the cold turkey carcass in
between commercials — all the
while tiying to decide the fate of
Stanford football?
After all, there will be football
here next year whether or not Bill
Walsh returns.
And following this season's dis
aster, the next coach will probably
be hailed as an instant success if he
can just manage to pull the Cardi

nal above the .500 mark.
But it's different with Bill Walsh
at the helm. People expect more.
If you retire now, you'll still be a
Hall-of-Famer, you'll still have
those three Super Bowl Rings,
you'll still be the Coach of the
Decade during the 1980's, you'll
still be the Genius, but what about
that greatest football coaching chal
lenge yet?
Haven't you ever wondered how
it would be to coach a run-oriented
team to a major bowl game? No Joe
Montana, no Rice, no Steve
Stenstrom, no Justin Armour. Just
Scott Frost, Mike Mitchell, Greg
Cornelia, Anthony Bookman and a
lot of speed between the four of
them.
Betcha you didn't see that one
coming, did you?
Well, that's it. I've tried every
thing — reverse psychology, dizzy
ing logic, threats, pleads. I've grov
eled 'til I can't grovel no more.
Next time you hear that nasty
rumor, Bill, please say it ain't so.

tea really, really fast will I still get
that brown gunk on the bottom of
the bottle?"
Two years ago, Stanford crushed
the Lions 24-3 in the Blockbuster
Bowl, but in 1994, Paterno moves
onto greener pastures and Walsh
just puts himself out to pasture.
Hey Bill, if you're still losing
sleep over that two-point non-con
version at Big Game, forget about
it. That was the least memorable
game in the history of college foot
ball. By this time next year, that
play will only be a footnote in the
record books.
"Fourth quarter, Stanford —
Allen 1 run (pass failed) at 2:06."
Truly harmless.
And without getting into that,
"Bill you're the absolute coolest,
damn near Greatest, creme de la

creme football coach ever to grace the
ranks of the NFL and the NCAA" bit
and completely embarrassing
myself, I'll just take it a step further
and really piss off God by heaping
mounds of undisguised spiritual adu
lation and possibly performing
minor animal sacrifices in deifying
you as the greatest ever, period.
Can't you see that I'm groveling
as hard as I can?
But seriously, who am I kidding?
Why would you even take any of my
suggestions into consideration
while you lounge around this long
weekend, digesting the remains of
your Thanksgiving dinner and
picking at the cold turkey carcass in
between commercials — all the
while tiying to decide the fate of
Stanford football?
After all, there will be football
here next year whether or not Bill
Walsh returns.
And following this season's dis
aster, the next coach will probably
be hailed as an instant success if he
can just manage to pull the Cardi

nal above the .500 mark.
But it's different with Bill Walsh
at the helm. People expect more.
If you retire now, you'll still be a
Hall-of-Famer, you'll still have
those three Super Bowl Rings,
you'll still be the Coach of the
Decade during the 1980's, you'll
still be the Genius, but what about
that greatest football coaching chal
lenge yet?
Haven't you ever wondered how
it would be to coach a run-oriented
team to a major bowl game? No Joe
Montana, no Rice, no Steve
Stenstrom, no Justin Armour. Just
Scott Frost, Mike Mitchell, Greg
Cornelia, Anthony Bookman and a
lot of speed between the four of
them.
Betcha you didn't see that one
coming, did you?
Well, that's it. I've tried every
thing — reverse psychology, dizzy
ing logic, threats, pleads. I've grov
eled 'til I can't grovel no more.
Next time you hear that nasty
rumor, Bill, please say it ain't so.
