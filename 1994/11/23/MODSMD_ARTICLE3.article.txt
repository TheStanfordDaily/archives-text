# Students convince University to back down on giving policy
## 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
After meeting with student leaders yesterday, the adminis
tration agreed to release student organizations from its new
alumni-donation policy until a newly formed committee com
pletes its review of the measure.
The group will complete its review on Feb. 15, according to
Council of Presidents member Vanessa Alvarado.
The Stanford Fund policy, which went into effect Sept. 1,
prohibits University organizations from soliciting funds from
alumni who did not donate to that particular organization in
the previous five years.
Under the announcement, made by Alvarado at last night's
ASSU Senate meeting, the policy continues to apply to non
student organizations.
The move also delayed a scheduled bill by undergraduate
senator Steve Russell which would have set the ASSU up as an
umbrella fund-raising organization for student groups.
Instead, Russell presented a bill which condoned the new
formation of a working group to review the process of alumni
donations.
Alvarado said the ASSU Executive Committee met with
nine administrators yesterday morning in response to Rus-
sell's prospective bill, in which he
proposed creating a master list of
previous benefactors which stu
dent groups could then purchase
from the ASSU.
Administrators agreed that
student concerns had not effec
tively been addressed when the
Stanford Fund was originally rat
ified by the University cabinet.
"The policy was always intend
ed to help students, so if we have
to back off a little to ease the
transition, we don't mind,"
Provost Condoleezza Rice said.
Mork Murdock, a COP mem
ber, said the new policy's effects
on students warranted quick
action.
"We felt it an issue of clear
importance to the student body
and student groups which
demanded immediate attention,"
he said. "The policy gathered a
lot of attention from the adminis
tration and the press, and there
was an opportunity to take action
with the administration and con
vince them a reopening of the
process needed to take place."

Vice Provost and Dean for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds said
the original policy was in part in
response to alumni who com
plained they were being contact
ed for donations too frequently.
Edmonds described the Stan
ford Fund policy as "an attempt
to have a more professional focus
for our alums."
"But if students have an issue,
we need to listen to those issues
and work them through," she
said.
Russell said his scheduled bill
has been tabled until next week
and not withdrawn.
"The University has made an
excellent decision in overturning
[the policy]," he said. "But rest
assured that if it doesn't work
out, [the bill] will be back."
Concerns had been raised over
whether Russell's original bill
violated University policy. "Rus
sell's bill wouldn't have done any
thing to help us," Alvarado said.
The new committee will be
chaired by Alvarado and Associ
ate Vice President for Develop
ment Stephen Peeps. It will con
sist of Deputy Senate Chair
Michael Choo, another COP
member, one senator, Dean of
Students Michael Jackson, Direc

tor of Student Activities Nancy
Howe and Stanford Fund Direc
tor Nanci Wells.
Alvarado said the group's task
is "a fair-minded review and
assessment of various alternative
policies for solicitation of alumni
that would serve the best inter
ests of the University, its stu
dents and student organiza
tions."
"The mission will evolve
around an examination of the pol
icy and alternatives to work
toward a mutually acceptable
conclusion," Wells said. "We want
the student organizations to meet
their own needs, and we want to
meet the needs of the Universi
ty."
"We hope that this process will
bring about a resolution of the
issues that the current policy of
the Stanford Fund has brought
up concerning student organiza
tions," Alvarado said.
She said the original policy
was made without consultation
of student opinion. "[The admin
istration] acknowledged that
they didn't engage us in the pro
cess," she said. "Now they need
to go back and engage us."
Administrators also said that
student concerns had not been

addressed but, Wells said, "not
because we were trying to nega
tively influence student groups."
She said the University did not
examine individual groups, but
rather examined the University
as a whole.
"We heard loud and clear that
the students were not adequately
consulted," she said.
Meanwhile, student groups
cannot use Stanford Fund money
to replace any possible losses in
the past three months. "Frankly
we don't have anything [yet],"
Wells said. "It's very difficult to
allocate money that we don't
have."
Wells said most student
groups have not been adversely
affected because most fundrais
ing drives have not begun. She
added that a decision remains to
be made on whether student
groups could access funds later in
the year.
In the meantime, however,
COP members and senators said
they are happy the original policy
has been suspended and that stu
dent concerns will be considered.
"We feel we have a process
which will strongly involve stu
dents in crafting a final policy,"
Murdock said.
