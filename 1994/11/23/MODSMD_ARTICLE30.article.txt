# Stuffing, no turkey
## Women's volleyball hopes to stuff Tigers over Thanksgiving 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
The average Thanksgiving
weekend menu includes turkey.
That of the second-ranked
Stanford women's volleyball
team has tiger meat on it.
While the rest of America is
devouring leftovers, the Cardinal
spikers will travel to nearby
Stockton to compete in the 16th
Annual Community Bankers
Classic at the University of the
Pacific. Stanford (25-1) will face
the Tigers of Louisiana State (8-
21) Friday at 5:30 p.m.
If the Cardinal prevails against
LSU, it will face the victor of the
No. 20 New Mexico (18-8) versus
No. 8 Pacific (21-5) match in the
tournament's championship bout
Saturday evening at 7 p.m. The
Lobos and the Pacific Tigers face
off Friday after the Stanford-LSU
encounter.
The LSU contest will provide a
breather of sorts for the Cardinal.
The Tigers have fallen on hard
times of late. Just four years ago,
LSU was a Final Four team. Now,
its record stands well below .500.

"They're definitely having a
down year," said Stanford head
coach Don Shaw. "Usually,
they're one of the tougher teams
in the South, but they're having
trouble."
If Stanford beats LSU, its Sat
urday night opponent will most
likely be Pacific. The Tigers are a
tall, athletic team which sports
four three-year starters in out
side hitters Dominique Benton-
Bozman, Desiree Leipham,
Robyn Schmitt and three-time
AIl-American middle blocker
Charlotte Johansson.
"Pacific's got some really good
players, some really experienced
players," Shaw said. "They're a
big team, except for their setter.
She's one of the shorter players
on the team."
That 5-8 setter is sophomore
Sacha Caldermeyer. And despite
her smaller stature, Shaw recog
nizes that she is a dangerous
weapon.
"She's really the key to their
offense," he said. "We have to
make sure that she doesn't get
into a rhythm."
Before Pacific has the opportu
nity to play the Cardinal for the
Classic's title, it must first defeat
the Lobos. This may not prove as
easy a task as the Tigers expect.
"One thing I know about New
Mexico is that if UOP doesn't take
it seriously, Pacific could fmd itself
in the consolation match," Shaw
said. "They are fired up to play us,
but they've got to concentrate on
the Lobos first."
New Mexico is a squad that the
Cardinal knows all too well. Twice
this season the Lobos have played
Stanford and twice the Lobos have
forced the Cardinal into a fourth
game, a situation unusual for this
year's Stanford squad. Before the
team's lone loss to UCLA, senior
Anne Wicks called New Mexico
"the toughest, most solid all
around team we've played all year."
Led by outside hitters Tania Goo
ley and Mindy Hale, the Lobos hope
for another shot at the Cardinal.
"We start out with Pacific and
that will be an interesting match,"
New Mexico head coach Laurel
Brassey Iverson said. "I don't
think the match will hurt [our
NCAA tournament chances] either
way, but we would like a th ; *xl
chance at Stanford."
Regardless of the tourney's out
come, Stanford has wrapped up a
NCAA tournament bid by winning
the Pacific 10 Conference this past
weekend. The Cardinal will also
likely receive a first-round bye and
will probably host a second-round
match at Maples Pavilion on Dec. 3.
