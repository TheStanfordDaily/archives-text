# Stuffing, no turkey
## Women's volleyball hopes to stuff Tigers over Thanksgiving 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
The average Thanksgiving
weekend menu includes turkey.
That of the second-ranked
Stanford women's volleyball
team has tiger meat on it.
While the rest of America is

tall, athletic team which sports
four three-year starters in out
side hitters Dominique Benton-
Bozman, Desiree Leipham,
Robyn Schmitt and three-time
AIl-American middle blocker
Charlotte Johansson.
"Pacific's got some really good
players, some really experienced
players," Shaw said. "They're a
big team, except for their setter.
She's one of the shorter players
on the team."
That 5-8 setter is sophomore
Sacha Caldermeyer. And despite
her smaller stature, Shaw recog
nizes that she is a dangerous
weapon.
"She's really the key to their
offense," he said. "We have to
make sure that she doesn't get
