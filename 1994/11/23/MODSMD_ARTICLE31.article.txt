Cardinal basketball fans will
have plenty to devour this
Thanksgiving weekend as the
Stanford men's team kicks off its
regular season with the third
annual Fry's Invitational, playing
host to Colgate University, Butler
College and St. Peter's College.
After over a full month of prac
tices, Cardinal players and coach
es alike are chomping at the bit to
get the season started.
"I'm excited more than any
thing else," said freshman center
Tim Young. "I just want to get

out there and play."
With 33 practices under their
belt, the coaching staff likewise
wants to see the team put
through the paces of regular-sea
son competition.
"It's hard for the kids to make
a lot of progress at this point in
time," head coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "I'm anxious to play
some games. The challenge of
playing in practice is getting a lit
tle bit old.
"We're anxious to see how
we'll do when it counts, and how
we'll do against different styles,
and different quality of oppo
nents. I think our tournament

will provide a good test for us to
see where we are at this point ih
time."
Stanford's opening-round
matchup against the Red Raiders
is heavy on the glitz and glamour
with two highly-touted freshmen
centers, the Cardinal's Young and
Colgate's Adonal Foyle, making
their collegiate debuts. The
match-up will should prove excit
ing, but for Stanford to advance
in the tourney, it must contain
Red Raider scoring machine
Tucker Neale.
