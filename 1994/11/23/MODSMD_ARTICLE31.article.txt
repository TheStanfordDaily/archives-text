# Hoopsters host Fry's Invite
## 
### Daniel Kao Contributing writer 
Cardinal basketball fans will
have plenty to devour this
Thanksgiving weekend as the
Stanford men's team kicks off its
regular season with the third
annual Fry's Invitational, playing
host to Colgate University, Butler
College and St. Peter's College.
After over a full month of prac
tices, Cardinal players and coach
es alike are chomping at the bit to
get the season started.
"I'm excited more than any
thing else," said freshman center
Tim Young. "I just want to get

out there and play."
With 33 practices under their
belt, the coaching staff likewise
wants to see the team put
through the paces of regular-sea
son competition.
"It's hard for the kids to make
a lot of progress at this point in
time," head coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "I'm anxious to play
some games. The challenge of
playing in practice is getting a lit
tle bit old.
"We're anxious to see how
we'll do when it counts, and how
we'll do against different styles,
and different quality of oppo
nents. I think our tournament

will provide a good test for us to
see where we are at this point ih
time."
Stanford's opening-round
matchup against the Red Raiders
is heavy on the glitz and glamour
with two highly-touted freshmen
centers, the Cardinal's Young and
Colgate's Adonal Foyle, making
their collegiate debuts. The
match-up will should prove excit
ing, but for Stanford to advance
in the tourney, it must contain
Red Raider scoring machine
Tucker Neale.
Neale lit up the Patriot League
last year, averaging 26.6 points
per game, good for fifth in the
nation. Deadly from the perime
ter, Neale canned 95 three-point
ers last season.
"You can't concentrate on one
player," junior guard Dion Cross
said. "If he's a good player, he's
going to score his points. We just
have to contain him."
To do so, the Cardinal must
deny Neale the ball. Meanwhile,
the Red Raiders will run multiple
screens in an attempt to free him
up.
"We're going to try to deny him
the ball as much as we can,"
Montgomery said. "If he has an
inch he'll shoot it, and he can.
He'll shoot it a lot because he's
used to scoring. We're going to
have to make sure he doesn't
touch the ball."
Offensively for Stanford,
sophomore guard Brevin Knight
will need to maintain the stellar
play he exhibited in the Cardinal's
two exhibition games, averaging

25.5 points per game, eight assists
and four steals. Specifically, if
Knight can hit the outside shot as
he's shown he can with his 75 per
cent shooting, he will loosen up
the middle and allow him to pene
trate and create.
"I'm just going to come out and
play like I did in the exhibition
games," Knight said. "I want to
stay within myself. Go to the bas
ket when I need to, and feed to
other people when I don't."
Another important factor will
be Colgate's inexperience. Neale is
the Red Raider's only returning
starter from a team that won 17
games last year. So despite the tal
ent of Foyle and Neale, Colgate's
depth will be severely tested.
The two other tournament
participants, Butler and St.
Peter's, from the Midwestern Col
legiate and the Metro Atlantic
Conferences, respectively, are
somewhat enigmatic.
Last season Butler pulled off
an upset over perennial power
Indiana, defeating the Hoosiers
75-71, but lost two games later to
little-known Valparaiso by 17.
The Bulldogs will hit town with
out last year's leading scorer Jer-

Maine Guice and his 18.2 points
per game, but return a formidable
backcourt of Chris Miskel (13.8
points per game, 4.7 rebounds per
game last season) and Travis
Trice (8.6 points per game, 5.3
rebounds per game). Butler will
also introduce its own intriguing
big man with 7-foot-2" sophomore
Rolf van Rijn.
St. Peter's also suffered ups
and downs last year, winning six
straight to rise to 14-8 but then
dropping its last five. The Pea
cocks key strengths include bal
ance and depth, with a solid back
court of Mike Frensley (10.5
points per game last year) and
Brian Griffith (10.3 points per
game last year).
So while question marks riddle
the field at this year's Fry's
Invite, with a talented but thin
team in Colgate and two Jekyl
and-Hyde teams in Butler and St.
Peter's, one thing remains certain
— expectations and optimism are
high this year for the Cardinal.
"I feel good about us right
now," senior forward Andy Pop
pink said. "We're a better team
now than at the same point last
vear."

"We're anxious to see how
we'll do when it counts, and how
we'll do against different styles,
and different quality of oppo
nents. I think our tournament

will provide a good test for us to
see where we are at this point ih
time."
Stanford's opening-round
matchup against the Red Raiders
is heavy on the glitz and glamour
with two highly-touted freshmen
centers, the Cardinal's Young and
Colgate's Adonal Foyle, making
their collegiate debuts. The
match-up will should prove excit
ing, but for Stanford to advance
in the tourney, it must contain
Red Raider scoring machine
Tucker Neale.
Neale lit up the Patriot League
last year, averaging 26.6 points
per game, good for fifth in the
nation. Deadly from the perime
ter, Neale canned 95 three-point
ers last season.
"You can't concentrate on one
player," junior guard Dion Cross
said. "If he's a good player, he's
going to score his points. We just
have to contain him."
To do so, the Cardinal must
deny Neale the ball. Meanwhile,
the Red Raiders will run multiple
screens in an attempt to free him
up.
"We're going to try to deny him
the ball as much as we can,"
Montgomery said. "If he has an
inch he'll shoot it, and he can.
He'll shoot it a lot because he's
used to scoring. We're going to
have to make sure he doesn't
touch the ball."
Offensively for Stanford,
sophomore guard Brevin Knight
will need to maintain the stellar
play he exhibited in the Cardinal's
two exhibition games, averaging

25.5 points per game, eight assists
and four steals. Specifically, if
Knight can hit the outside shot as
he's shown he can with his 75 per
cent shooting, he will loosen up
the middle and allow him to pene
trate and create.
"I'm just going to come out and
play like I did in the exhibition
games," Knight said. "I want to
stay within myself. Go to the bas
ket when I need to, and feed to
other people when I don't."
Another important factor will
be Colgate's inexperience. Neale is
the Red Raider's only returning
starter from a team that won 17
games last year. So despite the tal
ent of Foyle and Neale, Colgate's
depth will be severely tested.
The two other tournament
participants, Butler and St.
Peter's, from the Midwestern Col
legiate and the Metro Atlantic
Conferences, respectively, are
somewhat enigmatic.
Last season Butler pulled off
an upset over perennial power
Indiana, defeating the Hoosiers
75-71, but lost two games later to
little-known Valparaiso by 17.
The Bulldogs will hit town with
out last year's leading scorer Jer-

Maine Guice and his 18.2 points
per game, but return a formidable
backcourt of Chris Miskel (13.8
points per game, 4.7 rebounds per
game last season) and Travis
Trice (8.6 points per game, 5.3
rebounds per game). Butler will
also introduce its own intriguing
big man with 7-foot-2" sophomore
Rolf van Rijn.
St. Peter's also suffered ups
and downs last year, winning six
straight to rise to 14-8 but then
dropping its last five. The Pea
cocks key strengths include bal
ance and depth, with a solid back
court of Mike Frensley (10.5
points per game last year) and
Brian Griffith (10.3 points per
game last year).
So while question marks riddle
the field at this year's Fry's
Invite, with a talented but thin
team in Colgate and two Jekyl
and-Hyde teams in Butler and St.
Peter's, one thing remains certain
— expectations and optimism are
high this year for the Cardinal.
"I feel good about us right
now," senior forward Andy Pop
pink said. "We're a better team
now than at the same point last
vear."
