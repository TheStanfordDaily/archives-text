# No Davids, just two Goliaths
## Cardinal's Tim Young debuts against Adonal Foyle 
### Daniel Kao Contributing Writer 
It's only the start of what
promises to be an exciting adven
ture for two of college basketball's
most talented freshmen centers,
but the hype has already begun.
Cardinal center Tim Young
and lied Raider pivotman Adonal
Foyle officially set foot on the col
lege hardcourt for the first time
in Friday's opening round
matchup between Stanford and
Colgate in the Fry's Invitational

at Maples Pavilion. However, the
individual square-off between the
two freshmen has already been
billed like a heavyweight champi
onship bout.
Young is quick to defuse the
hype. "I'm not too concerned
about the match-up," he said. "I
just want to look at it from a team
standpoint. I don't really care
about Adonal, I just want us to
play well and win." But there is
little doubt that all eyes will focus
on the two titans in the paint.
The tale of the tape of the

young Goliaths is as follows: in
one corner, the 7-foot-1 Young
comes in as the tallest player ever
to don Stanford cardinal and
white. He's been rated as one of
the top five incoming centers in
the nation after averaging 24.8
points and 11.7 rebounds as a
senior at Harbor High School in
California.
In the opposite corner, 6-
foot-10, 260-pound Foyle has
been touted as the sixth-best
freshman and the best rebound
ing freshman in the nation this
year. After averaging an eye
opening 36.2 points, 20.6
rebounds and seven blocks and
leading Hamilton Central High
School to a California state
title, Foyle turned down schol
arship offers from perennial
NCAA powers like Duke and
Syracuse to play at Colgate,
where his legal guardians, Jay
and Joan Mandle, are profes
sors.
Although both Young and
Foyle now find themselves in
similar roles as big players on
the even bigger stage of college
basketball, the two have taken
very different paths to reach
the same destination.
After attending a summer

basketball camp at the Farm
before eighth grade, Young
already considered Stanford as
one of his top choices. He went
on to spend hours watching
tapes of such hoops legends as
Bill Walton, Bill Russell, Larry
Bird, John Havlicek, and Kevin
McHale in hopes of someday
achieving similar greatness. The
Cardinal coaching staff expects
to bring Young along slowly,
teaching him the nuances of the
Stanford playbook.
"I don't know who our start
ing center's going to be at this
point in time," head coach Mike
Montgomery said. "Regardless
of who starts, both will play a
lot of minutes. I want to get
Tim started on a great career.
On the other hand, [senior Bart
Lammersen'sJ played well
enough to start."
On the other hand, Foyle
hadn't played a game of basket
ball until the age of 15, and

hadn't set foot on an American
basketball court until he was a
sophomore in high school,
brought over from his native
home of Canoun Island by the
Mandles. F'oyle expects to play a
major role this year in Colgate's
bid for a Patriot League title.
Many preseason selections have
already named him as part of
the All-Patriot League team,
the first freshman ever to be
honored in such a fashion.
"By the end of the year,
they'll be saying Adonal Foyle is
the best freshman in the coun
try," Colgate head coach Jack
Bruen said.
In other ways, however,
Young and Foyle seem to mirror
one another. Both are soft-spo
ken and polite. Neither grew up
in what Montgomery views as
"hotbeds of basketball." But
most notably, both are expected
to inflict major damage upon
opposing teams.
