# No Davids, just two Goliaths
## Cardinal's Tim Young debuts against Adonal Foyle 
### Daniel Kao Contributing Writer 
It's only the start of what
promises to be an exciting adven
ture for two of college basketball's
most talented freshmen centers,
but the hype has already begun.
Cardinal center Tim Young
and lied Raider pivotman Adonal
Foyle officially set foot on the col
lege hardcourt for the first time
in Friday's opening round
matchup between Stanford and
Colgate in the Fry's Invitational

at Maples Pavilion. However, the
individual square-off between the
two freshmen has already been
billed like a heavyweight champi
onship bout.
Young is quick to defuse the
hype. "I'm not too concerned
about the match-up," he said. "I
just want to look at it from a team
standpoint. I don't really care
about Adonal, I just want us to
play well and win." But there is
little doubt that all eyes will focus
on the two titans in the paint.
The tale of the tape of the

young Goliaths is as follows: in
one corner, the 7-foot-1 Young
comes in as the tallest player ever
to don Stanford cardinal and
white. He's been rated as one of
the top five incoming centers in
the nation after averaging 24.8
points and 11.7 rebounds as a
senior at Harbor High School in
California.
In the opposite corner, 6-
foot-10, 260-pound Foyle has
been touted as the sixth-best
