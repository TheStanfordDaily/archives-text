# Women's basketball to face Texas Tech
## 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The revenge tour continues.
All six of the teams that second-ranked
Stanford (1-0) lost to last season are on the
Cardinal's schedule this year. Stanford con
quered its first victim, fifth-ranked Purdue,
by a score of 62-52 on national television last
Saturday. Another opportunity will come this
Friday when No. 6 Texas Tech (3-0) invades
Maples Pavilion at 2:00 p.m. in a battle of pos
sible NCAA Final Four participants.
"I don't know where [the victory against
PurdueJ puts us," said Cardinal head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "It just showed that Stan
ford has the talent to beat a very good top five
team."
The media disagreed. The previously No. 5
Cardinal garnered enough votes to climb
three spots to its current ranking. The Lady
Raiders will test the intelligence of the
reporters when they hit town.
"Texas Tech is very potent at scoring
inside," VanDerveer said. "[Connie] Robinson
is a great scorer, and watch out for Michi
Atkins."
Robinson, a senior forward for the Lady
Raiders, averaged 18.7 points per game and
7.6 rebounds per game leading Texas Tech to

a 25-8 record last year. Atkins, a junior center,
chipped in 15.3 points per game and 6.4
rebounds per game. And the team doesn't stop
there.
All five of last year's starters return and
three freshmen joined the team, giving the
Lady Raiders exceptional depth and size to
challenge the Cardinal. In addition, Texas
Tech will have played four games by Friday
compared to the one that Stanford will have
played.
Injuries to three starters from last year's
Cardinal team add to Stanford's troubles.
Senior forward Rachel Hemmer will not be
available until mid to late December due to leg
surgery. The rehabilitation began in October
and Hemmer has been progressing.
"She's been practicing," VanDerveer said.
"She has been taking part in some drills but is
definitely out."
Other injuries include foot and leg prob
lems for guards Kate Paye and Jamila Wide
man. Paye, a senior, twisted her ankle in prac
tice before the Purdue game but was able to
play, scoring 12 points.
"Paye was definitely hampered by her
ankle," VanDerveer said. "She was able to hit
some big shots, however, and help the team."
Wideman, the starting point guard, is suf
fering from a stress fracture. She believes the

fracture resulted from a sprained ankle she
suffered during the final regular season game
against Washington last year.
"fPaye and Wideman] are about 60-70 per
cent," VanDerveer said. "Mobility was a big
problem for both of them during the game
[against Purdue]."
Despite leaving Jackson, Tenn., with a vic
tory, VanDerveer wasn't completely happy
with the team's performance defensively and
offensively.
"We weren't pressuring the ball and mak
ing things happen," VanDerveer said. "Many
of the [17] steals against Purdue were made
by Starbird getting in passing lanes and oth
ers were on deflections that went into our
hands. We need to improve <stir defense and
rebounding."
Also expect the learning process to contin
ue for the freshmen. Three saw action against
Purdue, with two receiving significant playing
time.
"Olympia [Scott] did a great job, especially
on the boards," VanDerveer said. "Heather
[Owen] also played well. We need more from
Naomi [Mulitauaopele] however."
Offensively, only twice last year Stanford
scored less than the 62 points the Cardinal
registered against the Boiler
makers.
"We need to take better care
of the ball," VanDerveer said. "I
was disappointed with the num

ber of turnovers that I felt were
unforced. We weren't passing
the ball well I thought.
"We had some open shots,"
VanDerveer added. "It's a mat
ter of shot selection and finish
ing the plays. Bobby Kelsey and
Kate Starbird are good shoot
ers. They can make their
shots."

The Cardinal did take away
some good things from the Pur
due contest however.
"It was a big win for us,"
VanDerveer said. "It was really
important for our confidence
and it is something we can build
on. I can't complain if we play
our best and get beat. It's early
in the season."
