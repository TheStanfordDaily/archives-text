Greg Jimmerson
One could argue that Greg Jimmerson is a devil of runner due to the
fact that the number six appeared on three important occasions for
the sophomore during his campaign with the Stanford cross country
team this year. The first came at the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships, where he led the Cardinal and placed sixth individually. The
second and third "six" appeared this past Monday at the NCAA Cham
pionships held in Fayetteville, Ark. By capturing sixth place individu
ally and earning All-American honors, Jimmerson helped then-No. 11
Stanford finish sixth as a team.

Anita Kaplan
In basketball, one often hears the term "money" when a deadly accu
rate guard launches a shot from the perimeter. Keeping with this tra
dition of using currency to describe players and their abilities, per
haps the British "pound" best defmes center Anita Kaplan. Last
weekend, the 6-foot-5 senior powered the No. 5 Cardinal women's
basketball team's 62-52 upset of No. 2 Purdue in the Hall of Fame
Classic held in Jackson, Tenn. Stanford pounded the ball inside to
Kaplan, who scored a game-high 22 points while grabbing seven
rebounds.
