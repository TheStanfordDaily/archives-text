# Wrestlers journey to Vegas

The Stanford wrestling team
will find out how well it match
es up with the nation's best this
weekend in the Las Vegas Invi
tational.
"It's a preseason national
tournament," said senior co
captain Jay Jackson. "I love it.
It's a great tournament. I'm
looking forward to having lots
of fun."
Jackson heads a group of
seven Cardinal who will com
pete in the event. The list
includes junior Matt Cano,
sophomores Ryan Barnes and
Bryan Vaniman, and freshman
Jeff Grant.
Junior Sahlan Martin and
sophomore Roger Liu will also
participate in the invite if they
recover from their neck
injuries.
The Cardinal are only taking
seven wrestlers because of bud
getary constraints and the high
quality of the competition at
the tourney. "It's a tough tour
nament," head coach Chris
Horpel said. "It's like having
[the NCAA Championships]
now. Most of the team isn't
ready."

The tournament will expose
the Cardinal to some of the pre
miere wrestlers and teams in
the nation, whom Stanford will
not face in dual meets this year
during the regular season.
"There are positives and neg
atives [in competing in this tour
nament]," Horpel said. "It's the
best way to see [the top teams],
but the competition is too
intense this early in the year."
The seven Stanford athletes
who will wrestle this weekend
are at the skill level where the
tournament will prove benefi
cial, Horpel added.
Last year, Stanford finished
in the top 20 out of the 40
teams that competed. Two Car
dinal placed in the top eight last
year: Jackson captured sixth
place in the 134-pound weight
class and junior co-captain
Jimmy Aguirre took seventh
place in the 142-pound division.
Aguirre will not participate this
weekend because he injured his
neck. He probably will not
wrestle competitively until
early January.
Jackson looks to improve on
last year's finish by two or
three spots, he said. He has not
lost in any one of his five bouts
thus far in the season. He

recorded four of his victories in
winning the California Open on
Nov. 13, and his fifth came last
Friday in a dual meet against
UC Davis.
In addition, Cano has a
strong chance of placing in the
126-pound division. Cano exit
ed the tournament early last
year after losing his first
match.
"I expect to place," Cano
said. "Last year was my first
year starting and I was really
nervous. This year I expect to
do well."
Horpel anticipates that both
Cano and Jackson will perform
well.
"Jay and Matt are the most
ready to step up to win enough
matches to place," the coach
said. "The rest of the team
could place but the expectations
aren't as high."
For the team to finish higher
than it did last time around,
more than two Cardinal will
have to place.
"If this was the end of the
season, we could expect to do
better," Horpel said. "If we
trained hard enough to do well
(right now], we would burn out
[by the time of the NCAA
Championships]."
