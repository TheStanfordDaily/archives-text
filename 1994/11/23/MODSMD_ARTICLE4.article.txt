# SIG seeking compensation for lost alumni solicitations
## 
### Frank Guinan Stair writer 
Despite a change in the alumni giving policy, Stanford
in-Government members say they will continue to ask the
administration to compensate them for the time they lost
in soliciting funds from alumni.
SIG chair Susan Thomas and SIG treasurer Jon Oram
met with Provost Condoleezza Rice yesterday, before the
policy was suspended, in an effort to air their concerns
about the policy and to make their own request for an al
lotment from the Stanford Fund.
The two asked for $7,500 from the fund, a figure which
"our research shows is a fair compensation," Oram said.
In the past, SIG mailed solicitation letters to more than
2,000 alumni, raising close to $10,000 a year. In asking
the Development Office for alumni lists this year, howev-
er, Thomas and Oram said they
were only allowed to ask for dona
tions from 352 alumni.
Money from these donations go
toward funding fellowships for
students over the summer.
Oram said although Rice made
no promises, she told them she
understood their timeline and
would have a decision by the end
of the quarter.
Rice, however, declined to com
ment on the meeting.
Thomas added that the group
already has lost close to three

months in solicitation efforts and
that the change in policy was too
late to have much effect.
"We have already expended
time and energy mailing letters to
alumni under the old policy,"
Thomas said. "We hope the
administration will still consider
[ourj request and give us a short
term allocation."
The meeting came after the
Development Office advised SIG
to edit a letter they intended to
mail to their alumni describing
the effects of the policy on the stu
dent group.
While Oram said that SIG con
tinued to work directly with the
Development Office even after the
new policy was announced, such

obstacles
stymied their
efforts to fund
raise.
The letter —
which also was
aimed at solicit
ing donations
from current
givers — includ
ed an article

from The Daily about the policy.
According to Thomas, mem
bers of the student group asked
the Development Office in early
October to clarify what they could
and could not send out to alumni.
The Development Office told
them at that time that they could
inform their alumni about the

policy.
But when Thomas showed the
letter to development officer
Traslyn Butler last week, she was
informed that they could not mail
the letter if they wished to use the
resources provided by the Devel
opment Office.
"[The Development Office] told
us the letter ran contrary to the
goals of the Stanford Fund,"
Oram said.
Butler admitted that asking
SIG not to mail the letter was a
"judgment call."
"Given the guidelines we have
been working with, I made the
determination that the letter
would not be appropriate," Butler
said.

She added |
that the goals of |
the Stanford
Fund were to
increase alumni
donations and
encourage unre
stricted gift giv
ing, and that the
letter ran con
trary to these goals

Butler said her action was not
meant to censor the group. She
felt, however, that the letter was
"not encouraging unrestricted
giving to the Stanford Fund."
"I interpreted the tone (of the
letter] to be one encouraging gifts
only to SIG," Butler said. "I have
to be concerned what conflicting

messages that sends out."
Although she had not read the
letter personally, Director of the
Stanford Fund Nancy Wells said
that as she understood it, the let
ter falsely implied that the Fund
would harm SIG in the long
range.
"The letter took a more adver
sarial stance. . . . There was a
tone in the letter that the policy
could threaten the group," said
Wells, adding that Butler brought
up a concern "any one of us would
have voiced."
She hastened to add that SIG
has "done a very good job working
with the Development Office"
under its "contractual agree
ment."
