# ASSU Senate questions specifics of proposal to reform special fees
## 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
Several ASSU senators and other
members of the Stanford community
raised questions at last night's senate
meeting over segments of a recent report
that proposes excluding religious and po
litical groups from the ASSU special-fee
process.
Graduate student Karen Seta, chair of
the 11-member Special Fee Reform Task
Force which proposed eliminating the
fee-refund system, also dealt with ques
tions on the group's decision to maintain
a 15 percent minimum on student voting
and the funding uncertainty that would
accompany the suggested changes.
The main recommendations the group
made after a three-month study of the fee
svstem were to eliminate individual re-

funds and split the fee
voting between under
graduates and graduate
students.
The report also pro
hibits religious or parti
san political groups from
applying for a special fee
and keeps groups that
receive special fees from

using that money to fund partisan or de
nominational events.
"We don't want to hinder events that
are primarily intended as culture," Seta
said. "We just want to make sure that spe
cial fee money is not used to lachieve po
litical and religious objectives]."
Several questions last night focused on
the senate's increased role in determining
which student groups are political or reli
gious in purpose and the difficulties in

making such distinctions.
Seta summarized the change in policy
by saying "there will be some means of
prohibiting some groups that are primar
ily political or religious in purpose from a
special fee."
When pressed on what exactly consti
tutes political or religious activity, Seta
said, "If an organization is deemed to be
primarily cultural, it's not encouraging
someone to 'take a stance.' "
She pointed out that groups applying
for funding from the Program Board,
Community Service Board and Publica
tions Board already adhere to the same
funding restriction.
Seta added that the amendment's im
pact would be small. "Only five or six
groups out of 40 in last spring's election"


Seta
would have been affected by the
change in policy, she said, because
only that number included reli
gious or partisan political expendi
tures in their budgets.
Representatives from Stanford
in Government, who were denied
special-fee funding because 15
percent of the student body did
not vote on their request, pressed
Seta on why the minimum vote
rule was not lowered.
Seta noted that by eliminating
the refund process, the task force
intended to give more power to the
special-fee election. She said she is
hopeful that this change will
increase voter turnout.
"We thought that having a
minimum threshold was a good
thing. . . . We want to give more
power to the election process, we
want to get people out to vote, and
under that [framework] we
thought 15 percent was reason
able," she said.
ASSU Senator Charles Katz, a
sophomore, expressed concern
that the proposal would force stu
dents to vote either for or against
a fee request without knowing
how much it would cost them.
If the plan is approved as pro
posed, graduate and undergradu
ate student votes would be consid
ered separate "voting communi
ties" in the spring special-fee elec

tions.
Approval of a fee request by
either voting community would
result in full funding to a specific
student group. If both voting com
munities approved the request,
they would split the cost of the fee
evenly. However, if only one of the
two new "voting communities"
approved the fee request, that bloc
would bear the full burden of the
funding.
Seta said that "simplicity" was
a large consideration in the task
force's deliberations, and that a
more complex funding mechanism
would have been too burdensome.
She added that, when students
vote, they should consider the fact
that they don't know exactly what
portion of the special fee they will
actually have to pay.
The Special Fee Reform Task
Force was composed mostly of
ASSU members, but also included
a few administrators and at-large
students.
The senate will debate the task
force's report next Tuesday and
will vote on it at a special Dec. 6
meeting.
In other senate business,
Financial Manager Gabe Lucas
released the specific results of the
fall quarter refund process.
Although overall refunding
decreased sharply from last year
— to an estimated 17.26 percent
— graduate student refunding
remained relatively high. Over 75
percent of all refunding was done
bv erraduate students.
