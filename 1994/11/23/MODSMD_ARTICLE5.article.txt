# ASSU Senate questions specifics of proposal to reform special fees

### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
Several ASSU senators and other
members of the Stanford community
raised questions at last night's senate
meeting over segments of a recent report
that proposes excluding religious and po
litical groups from the ASSU special-fee
process.
Graduate student Karen Seta, chair of
the 11-member Special Fee Reform Task
Force which proposed eliminating the
fee-refund system, also dealt with ques
tions on the group's decision to maintain
a 15 percent minimum on student voting
and the funding uncertainty that would
accompany the suggested changes.
The main recommendations the group
made after a three-month study of the fee
svstem were to eliminate individual re-

funds and split the fee
voting between under
graduates and graduate
students.
The report also pro
hibits religious or parti
san political groups from
applying for a special fee
and keeps groups that
receive special fees from

using that money to fund partisan or de
nominational events.
"We don't want to hinder events that
are primarily intended as culture," Seta
said. "We just want to make sure that spe
cial fee money is not used to lachieve po
litical and religious objectives]."
Several questions last night focused on
the senate's increased role in determining
which student groups are political or reli
gious in purpose and the difficulties in

making such distinctions.
Seta summarized the change in policy
by saying "there will be some means of
prohibiting some groups that are primar
ily political or religious in purpose from a
special fee."
When pressed on what exactly consti
tutes political or religious activity, Seta
said, "If an organization is deemed to be
primarily cultural, it's not encouraging
someone to 'take a stance.' "
She pointed out that groups applying
for funding from the Program Board,
Community Service Board and Publica
tions Board already adhere to the same
funding restriction.
Seta added that the amendment's im
pact would be small. "Only five or six
groups out of 40 in last spring's election"
