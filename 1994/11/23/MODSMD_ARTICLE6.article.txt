# Pub Board director survives challenge
## COP no longer pursuing motion to remove Bressler from post 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
The Council of Presidents withdrew a mo
tion for the dismissal of ASSU Publications
Board director Danny Bressler, which was
scheduled to go before the ASSU Senate Appro
priations Committee last night.
The motion was withdrawn before the com
mittee meeting began because the COP "real
ized that Danny may have been acting within
the bylaws, and the bylaws were the problem,"
COP member Mork Murdock said.
The COP had called for the dismissal in re
sponse to a controversy over Bressler's suspen

sion of the Stanford Chaparral humor maga
zine last week, Murdock said.
COP member Anietie Ekanem said Monday
that concerns over Bressler's ability to impar
tially handle space reallocations for student
publications led the COP to call for the dis
missal. Bressler was asked to resign and re
fused.
The Pub Board has been working on a plan to
reallocate space in the Storke Student Publica
tions Building in order to better accommodate
the variety of student publications which occu
py the space.
On Monday the Pub Board passed this plan,
recommended by its Facilities and Space Com

mittee.
The Chaparral, however, challenged the
plan, which would convert one of the four
rooms it currently uses into a communal space
for all publications. Another of the Chaparral's
rooms would be used jointly by the Pub Board
and The Stanford Review.
In response, Bressler suspended the Chapar
ral from the Pub Board.
At a meeting on the new allocation plan last
Friday, Bressler had with him a letter that an
nounced the suspension but didn't give it to the
Chaparral until after the meeting, Ekanem said.
