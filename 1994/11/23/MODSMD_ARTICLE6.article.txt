# Pub Board director survives challenge
## COP no longer pursuing motion to remove Bressler from post 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
The Council of Presidents withdrew a mo
tion for the dismissal of ASSU Publications
Board director Danny Bressler, which was
scheduled to go before the ASSU Senate Appro
priations Committee last night.
The motion was withdrawn before the com
mittee meeting began because the COP "real
ized that Danny may have been acting within
the bylaws, and the bylaws were the problem,"
COP member Mork Murdock said.
The COP had called for the dismissal in re
sponse to a controversy over Bressler's suspen

sion of the Stanford Chaparral humor maga
zine last week, Murdock said.
COP member Anietie Ekanem said Monday
that concerns over Bressler's ability to impar
tially handle space reallocations for student
publications led the COP to call for the dis
missal. Bressler was asked to resign and re
fused.
The Pub Board has been working on a plan to
reallocate space in the Storke Student Publica
tions Building in order to better accommodate
the variety of student publications which occu
py the space.
On Monday the Pub Board passed this plan,
recommended by its Facilities and Space Com

mittee.
The Chaparral, however, challenged the
plan, which would convert one of the four
rooms it currently uses into a communal space
for all publications. Another of the Chaparral's
rooms would be used jointly by the Pub Board
and The Stanford Review.
In response, Bressler suspended the Chapar
ral from the Pub Board.
At a meeting on the new allocation plan last
Friday, Bressler had with him a letter that an
nounced the suspension but didn't give it to the
Chaparral until after the meeting, Ekanem said.
Ekanem said that among the
COP's reasons for requesting
Bressler's dismissal was concern
over the appropriateness of the
suspension's timing.
Bressler clarified that he sus
pended the Chaparral based on its
actions at the meeting Friday.
The magazine had been asked
several times during the meeting
if it acknowledged the authority
of the Pub Board and the Univer
sity over space allocations, he
said, and it refused to acknowl
edge that authority.
The Chaparral had violated
Pub Board bylaws several times
in the past and had been notified
of its violations, Bressler added.
Members of several student
publications wrote e-mail to the
COP today in support of Bressler,
said Sarah Porter of A Woman's
Guide to Stanford.
After receiving the messages of
support, the COP "went back and

looked at the bylaws," Murdock
said. Upon reexamination, the
council removed its motion.
"We needed to become more
informed with what was going on
in the Publications Board," said
COP member Vanessa Alvarado.
But she added that she didn't
think the COP had acted too
hastily. "I still think the space
allocations have been dealt with
improperly," she said. "Knowing
what we knew at the time, we
made the appropriate decision."
The COP and ASSU Senate
will now look into a committee to
reexamine the Pub Board bylaws,
Murdock said.
"People should realize that all
along we wanted to talk to Danny
about how he felt about this,"
Murdock said. "We're going to do
our best to work it out with him."
The COP will send Bressler a
formal letter announcing its deci
sion, Alvarado said.
"I'm relieved this is over,"
Bressler said. "I'm looking for
ward to seeing the board continue
to develop. It's important that we
move forward."
