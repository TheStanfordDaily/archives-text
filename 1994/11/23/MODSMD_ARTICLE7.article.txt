# Unconventional lives
## Nontraditional undergrads balance their homework and their home life 
### Mia Sara Bruch 
After an arduous day of class
es, haggling with the folks at Old
Union and braving the perils of
White Plaza roller-bladers, Kitty
Maguire and Tari Vickery can
not simply indulge in the com
fort of Melrose Place.
Upon returning to their
homes, their evenings are devot
ed to making sure both they and
their children finish their home
work and get to bed at a decent
hour.
Maguire and Vickery — both
in their 40s — represent two of
the almost 100 "non-traditional"
students at Stanford who are
over 25.
"We try and recruit gems
from the community college sys

tern, who have completed the
two-year degree program," said
Assistant Director of Admissions
Joan Lippman, "but we also
admit many students who have
taken classes on an ad hoc basis
from their local community col
leges."
Both women are examples of
this unique slice of the Stanford
demographic pie. Both relin
quished established professional
lives to attend Stanford and both
balance their undergraduate
work with the full-time obliga
tion of husbands and school-age
children.
"After coming to Stanford, I
had to forget about making elab

my daughters," Maguire said.
Vickery's decision meant the
domestic task of creating a new
home for her family in Escondido
Village. Unlike most residents,
they knew that the Peninsula
would be a long-term home,
rather than a pit stop en route to
a degree.
"We had completely uprooted
from Oklahoma. I'd brought two
kids, husband, furniture, every
thing," she said. "So I was reset
tling my family — getting my kids
used to new schools, waiting for
my husband to find a job - while
I was in the midst of assimilating
to Stanford."
Although Maguire's family
already lived in nearby Saratoga,
her return to school this fall
required a realignment of' family
responsibilities.
"My husband's been great
about the shopping and laundry,
but I still spend most of my
evening making sure my (wo girls

it's literally a double life."

Both Maguire and Vickery
describe the added frustrations
Stanford holds for older students.
For individuals returning to
school after a .significant stint in
the work force, Stanford's course
requirements can be especially
aggravating.
"I feel like I've lived long
enough to have a clear idea of
what I'm passionate about,"
Vickery said, "I'm not a 17-year
old hell bent on being a pre
med."
All "non-traditional students,"
regardless of age or previous expe
rience, must complete the same
distribution requirements as a
green-horn freshman.
Moreover, both women are
acutely conscious of the genera
tion gap between themselves and
most students.
"I feel that I've been treated
dismissively here by some of the
younger students," Vickery
explained. "I've been blown off by
some of the student computer
consultants, who are presumably
here to help me".
Maguire added, "there's a lot
that you come to know by having
kids, by watching parents grow
old, that most students here can't
understand yet. It makes it diffi

cult to relate."
Both women's pre-Stanford
pursuits include accomplish
ments which "traditional" college
students would consider the
result of a degree.
Maguire — who worked as a
freelance artist and writer before
transforming herself into a full
time student — explained, "I
sometimes feel like I'm living my
life backwards." She left UC—
Berkeley to marry in 1969, in the
middle of her senior year.
Ironically, the compulsion to
attend Stanford as a psychology
major had its roots in a PBS docu
mentary on the brain.
"After I saw it, I developed a
voracious interest in the brain and
behavior," she said. "But I also
realized that I heeded to return to
school so that I wouldn't be limit
ed to what I had in front of me."
Maguire had to weave her way
through the many joys of the
application process — including
the SATs.
After her admission, Magu ire's
parents — who are in their 70s -
received letters from Stanford
regarding alcohol and underage
drinking.
Tari Vickery came to Stanford
via an equally unconventional

route. Growing up in Oklahoma,
Vickery did not think college was
a possibility. After graduating
from high school, Vickery and her
husband ran a successful business
together.
When the business closed in
198H, Vickery and her husband
began doing private consulting for
other companies.
"I began to notice how people
behaved in predictable ways in
certain situations," Vickery said.
Driven by a burgeoning interest
in sociology, she wound her way
through the admissions process
and transferred to Stanford as a
sociology major.
Vickery and Maguire, like most
"non-traditional" undergrads,
come to the academic world from
the practical — the reverse of
most Stanford students.
Their "leaves of absence" have
honed their devotion to their edu
cation to an exceptional degree,
even as they struggle to reconcile
an often incompatible set of iden
tities.
"I'm so glad I got the personal
issues that you deal with when
you're 19 and 20 out of the way
before I came here," Maguire
said. "But that doesn't mean
there are no more curveballs."
