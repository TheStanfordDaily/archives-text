Looks like a
Vivarin night.
The big one's only 12 hours away. You
could have paid more attention in
class, but tonight you've gotta
cram. First, you better keep
those eyes from closing.
Revive with Vivarin.
Safe as coffee, it
helps keep you
awake and mentally
alert for hours.
So when your most
difficult problem to
solve is how to
stay awake...make it
a Vivarin night!
Revive with VIVARIN*
