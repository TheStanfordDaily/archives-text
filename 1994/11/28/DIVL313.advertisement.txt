"It's not like the Red Cross
is asking us to give up our
spending money for the
whole year."
". . . And the Red
Cross can use our
donation to help
people hit by a
disaster "
. . Or to help
save lives by
teaching water
safety and CPR
skills and pro
viding HIV AIDS
education "
. And, hey,
even a small gift
can make a big
difference."
So, please give
to your Red ( ross
chapter.
