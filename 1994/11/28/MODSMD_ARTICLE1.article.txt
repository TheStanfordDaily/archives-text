# Students feel shut out of decision-making process
## Tired of having to fight retroactively, student leaders call for influence from the beginning 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Last week's administrative decision to
suspend Stanford's now fund-raising pol
icy is the second time this fall that student
leaders have successfully influenced Uni
versity policy to make it consistent with
student demands.
But the same leaders contend that
their recent accomplishments have not
been sufficient, citing an increasing igno
rance of students in the initial formation
of policies which they later have to fight to
change.

"It's unfortunate that students have to
fight so hard to get their voices heard,"
said Council of Presidents member Ani
etie Ekanem, a senior. "Considering that
students pay nearly $30,000 per year, it
really confuses me why they don't have
more say in what goes on. In a real sense,
the administration works for us."
Last spring, for example, students
upset with what they perceived to be ad
ministrative ambivalence to the effects of
budget cuts on ethnic communities re
sorted to a hunger strike in the Main
Quad in the hopes of getting their mes
sage across. In the same month, the Fac-

ulty Senate passed a new
grading policy despite
widespread, document
ed student opposition.
And this year, a con
scious decision to ex
clude students from two
Commission on Under
graduate Education de
sign committees was
only reversed after ac
tive COP lobbying.

Though some faculty and administra
tors agree that proactive student involve
ment has waned recently, others argue

that these concerns are a perennial prob
lem which is best solved by working
through the proper channels of student
representation, such as the COP and the
ASSU.
Fund-raising questions
Many students point to the Universi
ty's new fund-raising policy as a perfect
example of inadequate student consulta
tion before critical decisions are made.
The Stanford Fund policy, which went
into effect Sept. 1, is part of an attempt to
centralize the University's fund-raising
efforts. Aimed at reducing the number of

letters and solicitations that are sent to
alumni, the policy was designed to eventu
ally eliminate all alumni solicitation by
student organizations.
But after intense student lobbying, the
administration agreed last week to sus
pend student organizations from the
Stanford Fund policy until a newly
formed committee can review the mea
sure.
Students had previously expressed
concern that the new policy would "strip
away one of the last vestiges of autonomy


Ekanem
that student organizations have,"
said ASSU Senator Steve Russell, a
junior.
Students also charged that the
administration did not consult
them when deciding whether to
develop the new policy and instead
"snuck the policy in during the
summer," Russell said.
But Provost Condoleezza Rice
said student members sat on the
Board of Trustees committee that
recommended the policy last
February.
She added that the Stanford
Fund policy had to be implemented
in September so that there was suf
ficient time to print solicitation
materials.
"There are decisions that have
to be made that the University can
run," she said. "Some things just
can't wait... the University can't
operate on a 10-week quarter sys
tem."
But several student leaders
maintain that problems could have
been avoided if students had been
involved during the initial stages of
decision-making.
"If we had been involved from
the beginning things would have
been different," said junior Vanes
sa Alvarado, a COP member and
co-chair of the new fund commit
tee. "We're placed in a position
where we have to react. That's not
the position that either group
wants to put the other in."
Russell added, "This practice of
reacting, instead of being proac
tive, is a waste of our time."
CUE committees
Student leaders were also suc
cessful when they convinced Rice
to include student members on
Commission on Undergraduate
Education design committees.
In its final report released in
October, the commission recom
mended that two design commit
tees be formed — one to study a
proposed three-quarter science
sequence for non-science majors
and the other to revamp Cultures,
Ideas and Values courses.
The commission recommended
that the design committees be
"composed of faculty members
who are prepared to teach in the
new program."
Several student leaders said the
exclusion of students from the
design committees shows how they

must fight for adequate involve
ment in the decision-making pro
cess.
"It's been an uphill battle to get
student input heard," Ekanem
said.
Rice initially expressed some
concern about allowing students to
serve on the committees, but said
"persuasive" arguments by the
COP convinced her to include stu
dents on the committees.
She added that she was con
cerned that students are a tran
sient population and that curricu
lum decisions are a faculty matter,
not a student one. "There's no stu
dent input on a syllabus," she said.

But Ekanem
disagreed, saying
that undergradu
ates "have a right
to say what's
going on curricu
lum-wise. After
all, we pay nearly
$30,000 a year for
our education."
The commis-

sion had no objections to students
serving on the committees, said
History Prof. James Sheehan, the
commission chair.
Sheehan said it is "not so much
a question of formal representa
tion" on committees, but rather
that student opinion and experi
ence be taken into account when
determining the content of the
cores.
The students on the design com
mittees should serve as "conduits"
of student input, he said. "The
most important thing the students
can do is help the committee get
broader student input about what
students want," he said.
Grading changes
Students also use last spring's
Faculty Senate grading policy
debate as evidence of faculty disre
gard for student opinion during
policy formation.
Under the new policy, which
goes into effect next year, students
will face stricter add / drop dead
lines, failing grades and stringent
rules on retaking courses.
"During the entire debate it
seemed like the Faculty Senate did
not respect students very much,"
said senior David Cohen, who pro
posed an alternate plan during the
debate.
"The debate consistently char
acterized students as bad, irre
sponsible grade-grubbers who
waste faculty resources and have it
too easy and need to be taught

some discipline," Cohen said.
But Civil Engineering Prof. Jef
frey Koseff said most faculty he
spoke with respected students and
did not feel they were "scamming
the system."
The process of gathering stu
dent input was also flawed, Cohen
said. "The policy was presented
during midterms and voted on dur
ing finals," he said.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz, one
of three senators who voted
against the policy, agreed that the
senate discussions and vote were
"badly timed."
"To expect a great deal of stu
dent consultation during finals is
unrealistic," he said.
But other faculty members said
the timing was not an issue.
Two town hall meetings were
held in early May to solicit student
input about the proposed changes,
said Geological and Earth Sciences
Prof. Gail Mahood, chair of the
senate's Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement, which
presented the policy.
"It was the middle of the quar
ter. If that's not a good time, then
when is?" she asked, adding that
she was surprised that so few stu
dents attended the town hall meet
ings.
As for the timing of the final
vote, Mahood said the senate did
not purposely schedule it during
finals week, but alternate propos
als — such as one proposed by Reb
holz — delayed the final vote.
Cohen also argued that C-AAA
presented its proposal and then let
students react to it, instead of get
ting student input before compil
ing its recommendations.
The committee did not solicit
student input before formulating
its proposal because "we already
knew what the student response
was likely to be," Mahood said.
Previous polls by The Daily and C
AAA had provided a good idea
about student sentiment, she said.
Instead, C-AAA chose to survey
faculty members, as there was
insufficient data about faculty sen
timent on current grading meth
ods, Mahood said.
Striking for change
Several student leaders said last
spring's hunger strike illustrates
how far students will go to make
their voices heard.
During the three-day protest in
the Quad last May, members of
Stanford's Chicano / Latino com
munity presented administrators
with a list of four demands — a

community center in East Palo
Alto, a ban on grapes on campus,
increased support for Chicano
Studies and a high-level position
offer for Cecilia Burciaga, the Uni
versity's highest-ranking Chicana
administrator who was laid off last
spring due to budget cuts.
A University employee for 20
years, Burciaga — who was an
associate dean of student affairs
and a resident fellow at Casa Zapa
ta — was a visible role model for
the Chicano / Latino community
and her dismissal hit students
hard.
The hunger strike was an exam
ple of how effective "mobilization
politics" can be, Ekanem said.
"One of the greatest powers
that students have is the power not
to work within the system,"
Ekanem said. "When you don't
have power, your only option is to
mobilize, create action plans and
produce change .... Administra
tors don't like it but unfortunately
that's something that works."
Frustration about lack of
administrative attention to impor
tant issues facing the
Chicano / Latino community,
including budget cuts and the Uni
versity's polity on grapes, prompt
ed the strike, Alvarado said.
Students had tried to go
through the proper channels —
such as holding five community
meetings to air their concerns —
but none of their efforts met with
success, Alvarado said.
This lack of response by the
administration motivated commu
nity members to resort to a hunger
strike, she added.
"When the appropriate chan
nels don't work for you, you have
to do something more drastic," she
said. "People felt boxed in, like
there was nowhere to turn for
help."
A perennial problem
Despite the resurgence of prob
• lems in the last year, former Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy, who served from 1980-
92, characterized student concern
about lack of involvement in the
decision-making process as a
"chronic" condition rather than
an "acute" one.
"From time to time during my
presidency, those kind of concerns
surfaced, and I know that they sur
faced from time to time during
Dick Lyman's presidency before
me," he said. "It always waxes and
wanes .. . and it goes in irregular
cycles."

Kennedy noted that a "charge of
inadequate student input is oflen
the result of dissatisfaction with
the outcome."
"Sometimes students complain
about non-involvement when
their real complaint is that the
outcome isn't what they wanted,"
he said.
Other faculty members agree
that a lack of communication
between students and administra
tors is a perennial problem.
For example, Sheehan said he
remembers feeling ignored when
he was an undergraduate at Stan
ford.
He added that faculty members
also sometimes feel that the
administration isn't listening to
their concerns.
Kennedy agreed that faculty
have oflen felt un involved in the
decision-making process, pointing
to the construction of Rains in
1988 as a good example.
In that incident, faculty mem
bers who lived near the residence
were worried about increased traf
fic and were upset that they had
not been consulted about the origi
nal decision.
But Kennedy said their concern
was unforeseen, as is often the
case.
"You can't always predict

what's going to be
a subject of great
concern," he said.
"It's too much to
expect that on
every issue you're
going to be able to
involve all the
affected people so
there won't be
any controversy

afterward. That's Utopia."
Possible solutions
Faculty, administrators and
students alike offered a variety of
solutions to the communication
problem, ranging from fully utiliz
ing Stanford's committee system
to including a COP member on the
University Cabinet.
The ASSU nominates student
representatives to sit on almost all
University committees, said
Jimmy Ahn, chair of the ASSU
Nominations Commission.
"The ASSU has an important
responsibility to fill those commit
tees with student representatives
who will be effective participants,"
Kennedy said.
Mahood and Koseff agreed that
the existing committee system is
adequate and that student mem

bers must take their responsibility
seriously.
"Students need to take advan
tage of those avenues they have,"
Mahood said, adding that the
ASSU has been "remiss" in choos
ing good student members.
She added that student mem
bers do not always have good
attendance at committee meet
ings. During last spring's grading
policy discussions only one of the
three students on C-AAA regularly
attended meetings, she said.
The COP is in the process of
making sure that committee mem
bers are "doing their jobs" and that
they receive all the necessary infor
mation to be effective committee
members, Ekanem said.
The student member who regu
larly attended C-AAA meetings
had "an enormous impact,"
Mahood added.
But graduate student Sanford
Dickert disagreed, saying that stu
dent committee members are used
as "informational sources" and
"rarely do they affect change."
Ekanem said a COP member
should be allowed to serve on the
University Cabinet — which is
composed of University President
Gerhard Casper, Rice, the deans of
the University's seven schools and
other high-ranking administra
tors.
Rice, however, said the COP can
be its own solution to the problem
by acting as a liaison between the
student body and the administra
tion.
"The COP is a very good mecha
nism for student input," she said.
"When the University has to make
policy, it is just more efficient to go
through student representa
tives. .. . Neither Gerhard
[Casperl nor I can meet with every
student that has a concern."
Rice said the COP does affect
change, citing the success of last
year's COP in getting a budgetary
decision reversed. Administrators
had originally proposed cutting
$50,000 from the Career Planning
and Placement Center's budget,
but COP members convinced
them to leave the center
untouched.
Alvarado agreed that the COP
should play an important role in
getting student opinions heard, but
said that it is not only the students'
responsibility.
Communication "can't just
come from one way," she said. "It's
a two-way process. After all, the
administration is administering a
university for students."

ty's new fund-raising policy as a perfect
example of inadequate student consulta
tion before critical decisions are made.
The Stanford Fund policy, which went
into effect Sept. 1, is part of an attempt to
centralize the University's fund-raising
efforts. Aimed at reducing the number of

letters and solicitations that are sent to
alumni, the policy was designed to eventu
ally eliminate all alumni solicitation by
student organizations.
But after intense student lobbying, the
administration agreed last week to sus
pend student organizations from the
Stanford Fund policy until a newly
formed committee can review the mea
sure.
Students had previously expressed
concern that the new policy would "strip
away one of the last vestiges of autonomy


Ekanem
that student organizations have,"
said ASSU Senator Steve Russell, a
junior.
Students also charged that the
administration did not consult
them when deciding whether to
develop the new policy and instead
"snuck the policy in during the
summer," Russell said.
But Provost Condoleezza Rice
said student members sat on the
Board of Trustees committee that
recommended the policy last
February.
She added that the Stanford
Fund policy had to be implemented
in September so that there was suf
ficient time to print solicitation
materials.
"There are decisions that have
to be made that the University can
run," she said. "Some things just
can't wait... the University can't
operate on a 10-week quarter sys
tem."
But several student leaders
maintain that problems could have
been avoided if students had been
involved during the initial stages of
decision-making.
"If we had been involved from
the beginning things would have
been different," said junior Vanes
sa Alvarado, a COP member and
co-chair of the new fund commit
tee. "We're placed in a position
where we have to react. That's not
the position that either group
wants to put the other in."
Russell added, "This practice of
reacting, instead of being proac
tive, is a waste of our time."
CUE committees
Student leaders were also suc
cessful when they convinced Rice
to include student members on
Commission on Undergraduate
Education design committees.
In its final report released in
October, the commission recom
mended that two design commit
tees be formed — one to study a
proposed three-quarter science
sequence for non-science majors
and the other to revamp Cultures,
Ideas and Values courses.
The commission recommended
that the design committees be
"composed of faculty members
who are prepared to teach in the
new program."
Several student leaders said the
exclusion of students from the
design committees shows how they

must fight for adequate involve
ment in the decision-making pro
cess.
"It's been an uphill battle to get
student input heard," Ekanem
said.
Rice initially expressed some
concern about allowing students to
serve on the committees, but said
"persuasive" arguments by the
COP convinced her to include stu
dents on the committees.
She added that she was con
cerned that students are a tran
sient population and that curricu
lum decisions are a faculty matter,
not a student one. "There's no stu
dent input on a syllabus," she said.

But Ekanem
disagreed, saying
that undergradu
ates "have a right
to say what's
going on curricu
lum-wise. After
all, we pay nearly
$30,000 a year for
our education."
The commis-

sion had no objections to students
serving on the committees, said
History Prof. James Sheehan, the
commission chair.
Sheehan said it is "not so much
a question of formal representa
tion" on committees, but rather
that student opinion and experi
ence be taken into account when
determining the content of the
cores.
The students on the design com
mittees should serve as "conduits"
of student input, he said. "The
most important thing the students
can do is help the committee get
broader student input about what
students want," he said.
Grading changes
Students also use last spring's
Faculty Senate grading policy
debate as evidence of faculty disre
gard for student opinion during
policy formation.
Under the new policy, which
goes into effect next year, students
will face stricter add / drop dead
lines, failing grades and stringent
rules on retaking courses.
"During the entire debate it
seemed like the Faculty Senate did
not respect students very much,"
said senior David Cohen, who pro
posed an alternate plan during the
debate.
"The debate consistently char
acterized students as bad, irre
sponsible grade-grubbers who
waste faculty resources and have it
too easy and need to be taught

some discipline," Cohen said.
But Civil Engineering Prof. Jef
frey Koseff said most faculty he
spoke with respected students and
did not feel they were "scamming
the system."
The process of gathering stu
dent input was also flawed, Cohen
said. "The policy was presented
during midterms and voted on dur
ing finals," he said.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz, one
of three senators who voted
against the policy, agreed that the
senate discussions and vote were
"badly timed."
"To expect a great deal of stu
dent consultation during finals is
unrealistic," he said.
But other faculty members said
the timing was not an issue.
Two town hall meetings were
held in early May to solicit student
input about the proposed changes,
said Geological and Earth Sciences
Prof. Gail Mahood, chair of the
senate's Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement, which
presented the policy.
"It was the middle of the quar
ter. If that's not a good time, then
when is?" she asked, adding that
she was surprised that so few stu
dents attended the town hall meet
ings.
As for the timing of the final
vote, Mahood said the senate did
not purposely schedule it during
finals week, but alternate propos
als — such as one proposed by Reb
holz — delayed the final vote.
Cohen also argued that C-AAA
presented its proposal and then let
students react to it, instead of get
ting student input before compil
ing its recommendations.
The committee did not solicit
student input before formulating
its proposal because "we already
knew what the student response
was likely to be," Mahood said.
Previous polls by The Daily and C
AAA had provided a good idea
about student sentiment, she said.
Instead, C-AAA chose to survey
faculty members, as there was
insufficient data about faculty sen
timent on current grading meth
ods, Mahood said.
Striking for change
Several student leaders said last
spring's hunger strike illustrates
how far students will go to make
their voices heard.
During the three-day protest in
the Quad last May, members of
Stanford's Chicano / Latino com
munity presented administrators
with a list of four demands — a

community center in East Palo
Alto, a ban on grapes on campus,
increased support for Chicano
Studies and a high-level position
offer for Cecilia Burciaga, the Uni
versity's highest-ranking Chicana
administrator who was laid off last
spring due to budget cuts.
A University employee for 20
years, Burciaga — who was an
associate dean of student affairs
and a resident fellow at Casa Zapa
ta — was a visible role model for
the Chicano / Latino community
and her dismissal hit students
hard.
The hunger strike was an exam
ple of how effective "mobilization
politics" can be, Ekanem said.
"One of the greatest powers
that students have is the power not
to work within the system,"
Ekanem said. "When you don't
have power, your only option is to
mobilize, create action plans and
produce change .... Administra
tors don't like it but unfortunately
that's something that works."
Frustration about lack of
administrative attention to impor
tant issues facing the
Chicano / Latino community,
including budget cuts and the Uni
versity's polity on grapes, prompt
ed the strike, Alvarado said.
Students had tried to go
through the proper channels —
such as holding five community
meetings to air their concerns —
but none of their efforts met with
success, Alvarado said.
This lack of response by the
administration motivated commu
nity members to resort to a hunger
strike, she added.
"When the appropriate chan
nels don't work for you, you have
to do something more drastic," she
said. "People felt boxed in, like
there was nowhere to turn for
help."
A perennial problem
Despite the resurgence of prob
• lems in the last year, former Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy, who served from 1980-
92, characterized student concern
about lack of involvement in the
decision-making process as a
"chronic" condition rather than
an "acute" one.
"From time to time during my
presidency, those kind of concerns
surfaced, and I know that they sur
faced from time to time during
Dick Lyman's presidency before
me," he said. "It always waxes and
wanes .. . and it goes in irregular
cycles."

Kennedy noted that a "charge of
inadequate student input is oflen
the result of dissatisfaction with
the outcome."
"Sometimes students complain
about non-involvement when
their real complaint is that the
outcome isn't what they wanted,"
he said.
Other faculty members agree
that a lack of communication
between students and administra
tors is a perennial problem.
For example, Sheehan said he
remembers feeling ignored when
he was an undergraduate at Stan
ford.
He added that faculty members
also sometimes feel that the
administration isn't listening to
their concerns.
Kennedy agreed that faculty
have oflen felt un involved in the
decision-making process, pointing
to the construction of Rains in
1988 as a good example.
In that incident, faculty mem
bers who lived near the residence
were worried about increased traf
fic and were upset that they had
not been consulted about the origi
nal decision.
But Kennedy said their concern
was unforeseen, as is often the
case.
"You can't always predict

what's going to be
a subject of great
concern," he said.
"It's too much to
expect that on
every issue you're
going to be able to
involve all the
affected people so
there won't be
any controversy

afterward. That's Utopia."
Possible solutions
Faculty, administrators and
students alike offered a variety of
solutions to the communication
problem, ranging from fully utiliz
ing Stanford's committee system
to including a COP member on the
University Cabinet.
The ASSU nominates student
representatives to sit on almost all
University committees, said
Jimmy Ahn, chair of the ASSU
Nominations Commission.
"The ASSU has an important
responsibility to fill those commit
tees with student representatives
who will be effective participants,"
Kennedy said.
Mahood and Koseff agreed that
the existing committee system is
adequate and that student mem

bers must take their responsibility
seriously.
"Students need to take advan
tage of those avenues they have,"
Mahood said, adding that the
ASSU has been "remiss" in choos
ing good student members.
She added that student mem
bers do not always have good
attendance at committee meet
ings. During last spring's grading
policy discussions only one of the
three students on C-AAA regularly
attended meetings, she said.
The COP is in the process of
making sure that committee mem
bers are "doing their jobs" and that
they receive all the necessary infor
mation to be effective committee
members, Ekanem said.
The student member who regu
larly attended C-AAA meetings
had "an enormous impact,"
Mahood added.
But graduate student Sanford
Dickert disagreed, saying that stu
dent committee members are used
as "informational sources" and
"rarely do they affect change."
Ekanem said a COP member
should be allowed to serve on the
University Cabinet — which is
composed of University President
Gerhard Casper, Rice, the deans of
the University's seven schools and
other high-ranking administra
tors.
Rice, however, said the COP can
be its own solution to the problem
by acting as a liaison between the
student body and the administra
tion.
"The COP is a very good mecha
nism for student input," she said.
"When the University has to make
policy, it is just more efficient to go
through student representa
tives. .. . Neither Gerhard
[Casperl nor I can meet with every
student that has a concern."
Rice said the COP does affect
change, citing the success of last
year's COP in getting a budgetary
decision reversed. Administrators
had originally proposed cutting
$50,000 from the Career Planning
and Placement Center's budget,
but COP members convinced
them to leave the center
untouched.
Alvarado agreed that the COP
should play an important role in
getting student opinions heard, but
said that it is not only the students'
responsibility.
Communication "can't just
come from one way," she said. "It's
a two-way process. After all, the
administration is administering a
university for students."

Last week's administrative decision to
suspend Stanford's now fund-raising pol
icy is the second time this fall that student
leaders have successfully influenced Uni
versity policy to make it consistent with
student demands.
But the same leaders contend that
their recent accomplishments have not
been sufficient, citing an increasing igno
rance of students in the initial formation
of policies which they later have to fight to
change.

"It's unfortunate that students have to
fight so hard to get their voices heard,"
said Council of Presidents member Ani
etie Ekanem, a senior. "Considering that
students pay nearly $30,000 per year, it
really confuses me why they don't have
more say in what goes on. In a real sense,
the administration works for us."
Last spring, for example, students
upset with what they perceived to be ad
ministrative ambivalence to the effects of
budget cuts on ethnic communities re
sorted to a hunger strike in the Main
Quad in the hopes of getting their mes
sage across. In the same month, the Fac-

ulty Senate passed a new
grading policy despite
widespread, document
ed student opposition.
And this year, a con
scious decision to ex
clude students from two
Commission on Under
graduate Education de
sign committees was
only reversed after ac
tive COP lobbying.

Though some faculty and administra
tors agree that proactive student involve
ment has waned recently, others argue

that these concerns are a perennial prob
lem which is best solved by working
through the proper channels of student
representation, such as the COP and the
ASSU.

tee. "We're placed in a position
where we have to react. That's not
the position that either group
wants to put the other in."
Russell added, "This practice of
reacting, instead of being proac
tive, is a waste of our time."
CUE committees
Student leaders were also suc
cessful when they convinced Rice
to include student members on
Commission on Undergraduate
Education design committees.
In its final report released in
October, the commission recom
mended that two design commit
tees be formed — one to study a
proposed three-quarter science
sequence for non-science majors
and the other to revamp Cultures,
Ideas and Values courses.
The commission recommended
that the design committees be
"composed of faculty members
who are prepared to teach in the
new program."
Several student leaders said the
exclusion of students from the
design committees shows how they

must fight for adequate involve
ment in the decision-making pro
cess.
"It's been an uphill battle to get
student input heard," Ekanem
said.
Rice initially expressed some
concern about allowing students to
serve on the committees, but said
"persuasive" arguments by the
COP convinced her to include stu
dents on the committees.
She added that she was con
cerned that students are a tran
sient population and that curricu
lum decisions are a faculty matter,
not a student one. "There's no stu
dent input on a syllabus," she said.

But Ekanem
disagreed, saying
that undergradu
ates "have a right
to say what's
going on curricu
lum-wise. After
all, we pay nearly
$30,000 a year for
our education."
The commis-

sion had no objections to students
serving on the committees, said
History Prof. James Sheehan, the
commission chair.
Sheehan said it is "not so much
a question of formal representa
tion" on committees, but rather
that student opinion and experi
ence be taken into account when
determining the content of the
cores.
The students on the design com
mittees should serve as "conduits"
of student input, he said. "The
most important thing the students
can do is help the committee get
broader student input about what
students want," he said.
Grading changes
Students also use last spring's
Faculty Senate grading policy
debate as evidence of faculty disre
gard for student opinion during
policy formation.
Under the new policy, which
goes into effect next year, students
will face stricter add / drop dead
lines, failing grades and stringent
rules on retaking courses.
"During the entire debate it
seemed like the Faculty Senate did
not respect students very much,"
said senior David Cohen, who pro
posed an alternate plan during the
debate.
"The debate consistently char
acterized students as bad, irre
sponsible grade-grubbers who
waste faculty resources and have it
too easy and need to be taught

some discipline," Cohen said.
But Civil Engineering Prof. Jef
frey Koseff said most faculty he
spoke with respected students and
did not feel they were "scamming
the system."
The process of gathering stu
dent input was also flawed, Cohen
said. "The policy was presented
during midterms and voted on dur
ing finals," he said.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz, one
of three senators who voted
against the policy, agreed that the
senate discussions and vote were
"badly timed."
"To expect a great deal of stu
dent consultation during finals is
unrealistic," he said.
But other faculty members said
the timing was not an issue.
Two town hall meetings were
held in early May to solicit student
input about the proposed changes,
said Geological and Earth Sciences
Prof. Gail Mahood, chair of the
senate's Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement, which
presented the policy.
"It was the middle of the quar
ter. If that's not a good time, then
when is?" she asked, adding that
she was surprised that so few stu
dents attended the town hall meet
ings.
As for the timing of the final
vote, Mahood said the senate did
not purposely schedule it during
finals week, but alternate propos
als — such as one proposed by Reb
holz — delayed the final vote.
Cohen also argued that C-AAA
presented its proposal and then let
students react to it, instead of get
ting student input before compil
ing its recommendations.
The committee did not solicit
student input before formulating
its proposal because "we already
knew what the student response
was likely to be," Mahood said.
Previous polls by The Daily and C
AAA had provided a good idea
about student sentiment, she said.
Instead, C-AAA chose to survey
faculty members, as there was
insufficient data about faculty sen
timent on current grading meth
ods, Mahood said.
Striking for change
Several student leaders said last
spring's hunger strike illustrates
how far students will go to make
their voices heard.
During the three-day protest in
the Quad last May, members of
Stanford's Chicano / Latino com
munity presented administrators
with a list of four demands — a

community center in East Palo
Alto, a ban on grapes on campus,
increased support for Chicano
Studies and a high-level position
offer for Cecilia Burciaga, the Uni
versity's highest-ranking Chicana
administrator who was laid off last
spring due to budget cuts.
A University employee for 20
years, Burciaga — who was an
associate dean of student affairs
and a resident fellow at Casa Zapa
ta — was a visible role model for
the Chicano / Latino community
and her dismissal hit students
hard.
The hunger strike was an exam
ple of how effective "mobilization
politics" can be, Ekanem said.
"One of the greatest powers
that students have is the power not
to work within the system,"
Ekanem said. "When you don't
have power, your only option is to
mobilize, create action plans and
produce change .... Administra
tors don't like it but unfortunately
that's something that works."
Frustration about lack of
administrative attention to impor
tant issues facing the
Chicano / Latino community,
including budget cuts and the Uni
versity's polity on grapes, prompt
ed the strike, Alvarado said.
Students had tried to go
through the proper channels —
such as holding five community
meetings to air their concerns —
but none of their efforts met with
success, Alvarado said.
This lack of response by the
administration motivated commu
nity members to resort to a hunger
strike, she added.
"When the appropriate chan
nels don't work for you, you have
to do something more drastic," she
said. "People felt boxed in, like
there was nowhere to turn for
help."
A perennial problem
Despite the resurgence of prob
• lems in the last year, former Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy, who served from 1980-
92, characterized student concern
about lack of involvement in the
decision-making process as a
"chronic" condition rather than
an "acute" one.
"From time to time during my
presidency, those kind of concerns
surfaced, and I know that they sur
faced from time to time during
Dick Lyman's presidency before
me," he said. "It always waxes and
wanes .. . and it goes in irregular
cycles."

Kennedy noted that a "charge of
inadequate student input is oflen
the result of dissatisfaction with
the outcome."
"Sometimes students complain
about non-involvement when
their real complaint is that the
outcome isn't what they wanted,"
he said.
Other faculty members agree
that a lack of communication
between students and administra
tors is a perennial problem.
For example, Sheehan said he
remembers feeling ignored when
he was an undergraduate at Stan
ford.
He added that faculty members
also sometimes feel that the
administration isn't listening to
their concerns.
Kennedy agreed that faculty
have oflen felt un involved in the
decision-making process, pointing
to the construction of Rains in
1988 as a good example.
In that incident, faculty mem
bers who lived near the residence
were worried about increased traf
fic and were upset that they had
not been consulted about the origi
nal decision.
But Kennedy said their concern
was unforeseen, as is often the
case.
"You can't always predict

what's going to be
a subject of great
concern," he said.
"It's too much to
expect that on
every issue you're
going to be able to
involve all the
affected people so
there won't be
any controversy

afterward. That's Utopia."
Possible solutions
Faculty, administrators and
students alike offered a variety of
solutions to the communication
problem, ranging from fully utiliz
ing Stanford's committee system
to including a COP member on the
University Cabinet.
The ASSU nominates student
representatives to sit on almost all
University committees, said
Jimmy Ahn, chair of the ASSU
Nominations Commission.
"The ASSU has an important
responsibility to fill those commit
tees with student representatives
who will be effective participants,"
Kennedy said.
Mahood and Koseff agreed that
the existing committee system is
adequate and that student mem

bers must take their responsibility
seriously.
"Students need to take advan
tage of those avenues they have,"
Mahood said, adding that the
ASSU has been "remiss" in choos
ing good student members.
She added that student mem
bers do not always have good
attendance at committee meet
ings. During last spring's grading
policy discussions only one of the
three students on C-AAA regularly
attended meetings, she said.
The COP is in the process of
making sure that committee mem
bers are "doing their jobs" and that
they receive all the necessary infor
mation to be effective committee
members, Ekanem said.
The student member who regu
larly attended C-AAA meetings
had "an enormous impact,"
Mahood added.
But graduate student Sanford
Dickert disagreed, saying that stu
dent committee members are used
as "informational sources" and
"rarely do they affect change."
Ekanem said a COP member
should be allowed to serve on the
University Cabinet — which is
composed of University President
Gerhard Casper, Rice, the deans of
the University's seven schools and
other high-ranking administra
tors.
Rice, however, said the COP can
be its own solution to the problem
by acting as a liaison between the
student body and the administra
tion.
"The COP is a very good mecha
nism for student input," she said.
"When the University has to make
policy, it is just more efficient to go
through student representa
tives. .. . Neither Gerhard
[Casperl nor I can meet with every
student that has a concern."
Rice said the COP does affect
change, citing the success of last
year's COP in getting a budgetary
decision reversed. Administrators
had originally proposed cutting
$50,000 from the Career Planning
and Placement Center's budget,
but COP members convinced
them to leave the center
untouched.
Alvarado agreed that the COP
should play an important role in
getting student opinions heard, but
said that it is not only the students'
responsibility.
Communication "can't just
come from one way," she said. "It's
a two-way process. After all, the
administration is administering a
university for students."

Alvarado
Last week's administrative decision to
suspend Stanford's now fund-raising pol
icy is the second time this fall that student
leaders have successfully influenced Uni
versity policy to make it consistent with
student demands.
But the same leaders contend that
their recent accomplishments have not
been sufficient, citing an increasing igno
rance of students in the initial formation
of policies which they later have to fight to
change.

"It's unfortunate that students have to
fight so hard to get their voices heard,"
said Council of Presidents member Ani
etie Ekanem, a senior. "Considering that
students pay nearly $30,000 per year, it
really confuses me why they don't have
more say in what goes on. In a real sense,
the administration works for us."
Last spring, for example, students
upset with what they perceived to be ad
ministrative ambivalence to the effects of
budget cuts on ethnic communities re
sorted to a hunger strike in the Main
Quad in the hopes of getting their mes
sage across. In the same month, the Fac-

ulty Senate passed a new
grading policy despite
widespread, document
ed student opposition.
And this year, a con
scious decision to ex
clude students from two
Commission on Under
graduate Education de
sign committees was
only reversed after ac
tive COP lobbying.

Though some faculty and administra
tors agree that proactive student involve
ment has waned recently, others argue

that these concerns are a perennial prob
lem which is best solved by working
through the proper channels of student
representation, such as the COP and the
ASSU.
Fund-raising questions
Many students point to the Universi
ty's new fund-raising policy as a perfect
example of inadequate student consulta
tion before critical decisions are made.
The Stanford Fund policy, which went
into effect Sept. 1, is part of an attempt to
centralize the University's fund-raising
efforts. Aimed at reducing the number of

letters and solicitations that are sent to
alumni, the policy was designed to eventu
ally eliminate all alumni solicitation by
student organizations.
But after intense student lobbying, the
administration agreed last week to sus
pend student organizations from the
Stanford Fund policy until a newly
formed committee can review the mea
sure.
Students had previously expressed
concern that the new policy would "strip
away one of the last vestiges of autonomy


Ekanem
that student organizations have,"
said ASSU Senator Steve Russell, a
junior.
Students also charged that the
administration did not consult
them when deciding whether to
develop the new policy and instead
"snuck the policy in during the
summer," Russell said.
But Provost Condoleezza Rice
said student members sat on the
Board of Trustees committee that
recommended the policy last
February.
She added that the Stanford
Fund policy had to be implemented
in September so that there was suf
ficient time to print solicitation
materials.
"There are decisions that have
to be made that the University can
run," she said. "Some things just
can't wait... the University can't
operate on a 10-week quarter sys
tem."
But several student leaders
maintain that problems could have
been avoided if students had been
involved during the initial stages of
decision-making.
"If we had been involved from
the beginning things would have
been different," said junior Vanes
sa Alvarado, a COP member and
co-chair of the new fund commit
tee. "We're placed in a position
where we have to react. That's not

sion had no objections to students
serving on the committees, said
History Prof. James Sheehan, the
commission chair.
Sheehan said it is "not so much
a question of formal representa
tion" on committees, but rather
that student opinion and experi
ence be taken into account when
determining the content of the
cores.
The students on the design com
mittees should serve as "conduits"
of student input, he said. "The
most important thing the students
can do is help the committee get
broader student input about what
students want," he said.
Grading changes
Students also use last spring's
Faculty Senate grading policy
debate as evidence of faculty disre
gard for student opinion during
policy formation.
Under the new policy, which
goes into effect next year, students
will face stricter add / drop dead
lines, failing grades and stringent
rules on retaking courses.
"During the entire debate it
seemed like the Faculty Senate did
not respect students very much,"
said senior David Cohen, who pro
posed an alternate plan during the
debate.
"The debate consistently char
acterized students as bad, irre
sponsible grade-grubbers who
waste faculty resources and have it
too easy and need to be taught

some discipline," Cohen said.
But Civil Engineering Prof. Jef
frey Koseff said most faculty he
spoke with respected students and
did not feel they were "scamming
the system."
The process of gathering stu
dent input was also flawed, Cohen
said. "The policy was presented
during midterms and voted on dur
ing finals," he said.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz, one
of three senators who voted
against the policy, agreed that the
senate discussions and vote were
"badly timed."
"To expect a great deal of stu
dent consultation during finals is
unrealistic," he said.
But other faculty members said
the timing was not an issue.
Two town hall meetings were
held in early May to solicit student
input about the proposed changes,
said Geological and Earth Sciences
Prof. Gail Mahood, chair of the
senate's Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement, which
presented the policy.
"It was the middle of the quar
ter. If that's not a good time, then
when is?" she asked, adding that
she was surprised that so few stu
dents attended the town hall meet
ings.
As for the timing of the final
vote, Mahood said the senate did
not purposely schedule it during
finals week, but alternate propos
als — such as one proposed by Reb
holz — delayed the final vote.
Cohen also argued that C-AAA
presented its proposal and then let
students react to it, instead of get
ting student input before compil
ing its recommendations.
The committee did not solicit
student input before formulating
its proposal because "we already
knew what the student response
was likely to be," Mahood said.
Previous polls by The Daily and C
AAA had provided a good idea
about student sentiment, she said.
Instead, C-AAA chose to survey
faculty members, as there was
insufficient data about faculty sen
timent on current grading meth
ods, Mahood said.
Striking for change
Several student leaders said last
spring's hunger strike illustrates
how far students will go to make
their voices heard.
During the three-day protest in
the Quad last May, members of
Stanford's Chicano / Latino com
munity presented administrators
with a list of four demands — a

community center in East Palo
Alto, a ban on grapes on campus,
increased support for Chicano
Studies and a high-level position
offer for Cecilia Burciaga, the Uni
versity's highest-ranking Chicana
administrator who was laid off last
spring due to budget cuts.
A University employee for 20
years, Burciaga — who was an
associate dean of student affairs
and a resident fellow at Casa Zapa
ta — was a visible role model for
the Chicano / Latino community
and her dismissal hit students
hard.
The hunger strike was an exam
ple of how effective "mobilization
politics" can be, Ekanem said.
"One of the greatest powers
that students have is the power not
to work within the system,"
Ekanem said. "When you don't
have power, your only option is to
mobilize, create action plans and
produce change .... Administra
tors don't like it but unfortunately
that's something that works."
Frustration about lack of
administrative attention to impor
tant issues facing the
Chicano / Latino community,
including budget cuts and the Uni
versity's polity on grapes, prompt
ed the strike, Alvarado said.
Students had tried to go
through the proper channels —
such as holding five community
meetings to air their concerns —
but none of their efforts met with
success, Alvarado said.
This lack of response by the
administration motivated commu
nity members to resort to a hunger
strike, she added.
"When the appropriate chan
nels don't work for you, you have
to do something more drastic," she
said. "People felt boxed in, like
there was nowhere to turn for
help."
A perennial problem
Despite the resurgence of prob
• lems in the last year, former Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy, who served from 1980-
92, characterized student concern
about lack of involvement in the
decision-making process as a
"chronic" condition rather than
an "acute" one.
"From time to time during my
presidency, those kind of concerns
surfaced, and I know that they sur
faced from time to time during
Dick Lyman's presidency before
me," he said. "It always waxes and
wanes .. . and it goes in irregular
cycles."

Kennedy noted that a "charge of
inadequate student input is oflen
the result of dissatisfaction with
the outcome."
"Sometimes students complain
about non-involvement when
their real complaint is that the
outcome isn't what they wanted,"
he said.
Other faculty members agree
that a lack of communication
between students and administra
tors is a perennial problem.
For example, Sheehan said he
remembers feeling ignored when
he was an undergraduate at Stan
ford.
He added that faculty members
also sometimes feel that the
administration isn't listening to
their concerns.
Kennedy agreed that faculty
have oflen felt un involved in the
decision-making process, pointing
to the construction of Rains in
1988 as a good example.
In that incident, faculty mem
bers who lived near the residence
were worried about increased traf
fic and were upset that they had
not been consulted about the origi
nal decision.
But Kennedy said their concern
was unforeseen, as is often the
case.
"You can't always predict

what's going to be
a subject of great
concern," he said.
"It's too much to
expect that on
every issue you're
going to be able to
involve all the
affected people so
there won't be
any controversy

afterward. That's Utopia."
Possible solutions
Faculty, administrators and
students alike offered a variety of
solutions to the communication
problem, ranging from fully utiliz
ing Stanford's committee system
to including a COP member on the
University Cabinet.
The ASSU nominates student
representatives to sit on almost all
University committees, said
Jimmy Ahn, chair of the ASSU
Nominations Commission.
"The ASSU has an important
responsibility to fill those commit
tees with student representatives
who will be effective participants,"
Kennedy said.
Mahood and Koseff agreed that
the existing committee system is
adequate and that student mem

bers must take their responsibility
seriously.
"Students need to take advan
tage of those avenues they have,"
Mahood said, adding that the
ASSU has been "remiss" in choos
ing good student members.
She added that student mem
bers do not always have good
attendance at committee meet
ings. During last spring's grading
policy discussions only one of the
three students on C-AAA regularly
attended meetings, she said.
The COP is in the process of
making sure that committee mem
bers are "doing their jobs" and that
they receive all the necessary infor
mation to be effective committee
members, Ekanem said.
The student member who regu
larly attended C-AAA meetings
had "an enormous impact,"
Mahood added.
But graduate student Sanford
Dickert disagreed, saying that stu
dent committee members are used
as "informational sources" and
"rarely do they affect change."
Ekanem said a COP member
should be allowed to serve on the
University Cabinet — which is
composed of University President
Gerhard Casper, Rice, the deans of
the University's seven schools and
other high-ranking administra
tors.
Rice, however, said the COP can
be its own solution to the problem
by acting as a liaison between the
student body and the administra
tion.
"The COP is a very good mecha
nism for student input," she said.
"When the University has to make
policy, it is just more efficient to go
through student representa
tives. .. . Neither Gerhard
[Casperl nor I can meet with every
student that has a concern."
Rice said the COP does affect
change, citing the success of last
year's COP in getting a budgetary
decision reversed. Administrators
had originally proposed cutting
$50,000 from the Career Planning
and Placement Center's budget,
but COP members convinced
them to leave the center
untouched.
Alvarado agreed that the COP
should play an important role in
getting student opinions heard, but
said that it is not only the students'
responsibility.
Communication "can't just
come from one way," she said. "It's
a two-way process. After all, the
administration is administering a
university for students."
