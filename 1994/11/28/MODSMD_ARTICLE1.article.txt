# Students feel shut out of decision-making process
## Tired of having to fight retroactively, student leaders call for influence from the beginning 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Last week's administrative decision to
suspend Stanford's now fund-raising pol
icy is the second time this fall that student
leaders have successfully influenced Uni
versity policy to make it consistent with
student demands.
But the same leaders contend that
their recent accomplishments have not
been sufficient, citing an increasing igno
rance of students in the initial formation
of policies which they later have to fight to
change.

"It's unfortunate that students have to
fight so hard to get their voices heard,"
said Council of Presidents member Ani
etie Ekanem, a senior. "Considering that
students pay nearly $30,000 per year, it
really confuses me why they don't have
more say in what goes on. In a real sense,
the administration works for us."
Last spring, for example, students
upset with what they perceived to be ad
ministrative ambivalence to the effects of
budget cuts on ethnic communities re
sorted to a hunger strike in the Main
Quad in the hopes of getting their mes
sage across. In the same month, the Fac-

ulty Senate passed a new
grading policy despite
widespread, document
ed student opposition.
And this year, a con
scious decision to ex
clude students from two
Commission on Under
graduate Education de
sign committees was
only reversed after ac
tive COP lobbying.

Though some faculty and administra
tors agree that proactive student involve
ment has waned recently, others argue

that these concerns are a perennial prob
lem which is best solved by working
through the proper channels of student
representation, such as the COP and the
ASSU.
Fund-raising questions
Many students point to the Universi
ty's new fund-raising policy as a perfect
example of inadequate student consulta
tion before critical decisions are made.
The Stanford Fund policy, which went
into effect Sept. 1, is part of an attempt to
centralize the University's fund-raising
efforts. Aimed at reducing the number of

letters and solicitations that are sent to
alumni, the policy was designed to eventu
ally eliminate all alumni solicitation by
student organizations.
But after intense student lobbying, the
administration agreed last week to sus
pend student organizations from the
Stanford Fund policy until a newly
formed committee can review the mea
sure.
Students had previously expressed
concern that the new policy would "strip
away one of the last vestiges of autonomy
