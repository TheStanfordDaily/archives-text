Terrorist attack
BEIT HAGAI, West Bank (AP) - A
rabbi was shot to death and an Israeli
policeman wounded in a hail of bullets
fired at their car yesterday as they drove
toward a Jewish settlement. Islamic mili
tants claimed responsibility.
The shooting, on the eve of the Jewish
holiday of Hanukkah, occurred 3 miles
from Hebron, where tensions have been
high since the massacre of 29 Muslim
worshipers by a Jewish settler at a
mosque Feb. 25.
It came a day before Israeli Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres was to meet with
PLO leader Yasser Arafat in Brussels,
Belgium, and as the cycle of violence in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip is pushing
negotiators to speed up the peace process.
Jewish settlers blamed government
peace policies for encouraging Islamic
militants, but members of Prime Minis
ter Yitzhak Rabin's Cabinet pledged to
continue talks with the PLO.
"We must continue the peace process
and do our best so that such sad events
will not occur in the future," said Immi
gration Minister Yair Tsaban.
An anonymous caller claiming to be
from the radical Muslim group Hamas
called Israel radio and claimed responsi
bility for yesterday's shooting. Hamas
had carried out a suicide bombing that
killed 23 people in Tel Aviv last month.

The victim was Rabbi Ami Olami, 35,
the spiritual leader of Otniel, a nearby
settlement with about 50 families. He
was heading back to Otniel from another
Jewish settlement.
Midwestern storms
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - A blusteiy
snowstorm shut down the Minneapolis-
St. Paul International Airport for part of
the afternoon yesterday, one of the busi
est travel days of the year, and canceled
about 100 airline flights.
Thunderstorms along the storm's
southern edge spun off tornadoes in Ten
nessee, killing two people. Three people
were reported missing in a Memphis sub
urb. High wind in Arkansas killed sever
al cattle and pitched their carcasses into
treetops.
The snowstorm ended a relatively
warm, dry autumn in the upper Midwest.
It was the latest date for Minnesota's
first significant snowfall of the season in
about 20 years, according to the National
Weather Service.
The Mackinac Bridge in upper Michi
gan was closed to traffic yesterday
evening because of high winds. People in
the far west Upper Peninsula were
advised to stay off the roads because of
blowing snow and decreasing visibility.
In the middle of the afternoon, visibil
ity in windblown snow was down to just

50 feet at Munro, S.D.
Up to a foot of snow was possible in
parts of Minnesota and northern Wiscon
sin.
About 6 inches of snow fell in two
hours at the airport in the Twin Cities
suburb of Bloomington, reducing visibili
ty to just one-eighth of a mile, according
to airport spokesman John Ostrom.
Smokeless cigarette
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. has developed a
cigarette that eliminates most smoke and
ash by heating instead of burning the
tobacco, the company said.
The cigarette, which may be called
Eclipse, eliminates 90 percent of second
hand smoke, has no lingering odor and
none of the staining associated with other
cigarettes, company spokeswoman
Maura Ellis said.
Although it looks like a regular
cigarette and has tobacco in it, only a
highly purified piece of carbon in the tip is
lit. Warm air is drawn over the tobacco —
which is mixed with glycerine — and the
glycerine vapor carries the nicotine and
tobacco flavor through a standard filter
to the smoker.
"It's not unlike a coffee maker, where
you pour the hot water over the coffee
grounds, and while the grounds don't
burn, the flavor is released," Ellis said.
