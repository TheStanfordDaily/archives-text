## Continue advocacy 
### 
Giving-policy committee
must include members
outside ASSU leadership

After negotiations
with ASSU leaders, the
administration agreed Tues
day to remove student organiza
tions from the reach of the Univer
sity's new alumni-giving policy
pending review by a newly formed
committee.
The new policy prohibited stu
dent organizations from soliciting
funds from alumni who had not
donated within five years. Alumni
would instead be encouraged to
donate to the Stanford Fund, an
unrestricted fund controlled by the
president and provost.
The plan would have let the
administration capitalize unfairly
on student groups' alumni sup
port. Also, forcing alumni-support
ed groups to replace their lost
income with Stanford Fund money
would have given the administra
tion the power to punish student
groups of whom they disapproved
and reward groups they favored.
Luckily, ASSU leaders acted
quickly and effectively to thwart
the outrageous plan and negotiated
with the administration to release
student organizations from the
policy's reach.
ASSU leaders acted admirably,
proving once again that student
government ©an* 4be*an effective
vehicle for student advocacy. The
administration also deserves praise
for graciously backing down once it
realized the new policy might harm
student life.
The policy's effect on student
groups is suspended until Febru
ary, pending review of the policy by
a committee that includes two
members of the Council of Presi
dents, two ASSU senators and sev
eral administrators, according to
COP member Vanessa Alvarado.
What's missing from this com
mittee, however, is representation

from students outside the leader
ship of the ASSU.
Normally, ASSU leaders' inter
est in making the ASSU a powerful
presence on campus runs parallel
to their goal of advancing student
interests. In the case of this alum
ni-giving policy, however, the ASSU
could face a difficult situation
where those goals conflict.
For instance, before the admin
istration suspended the policy,
some administrators proposed giv
ing the ASSU control over some
Stanford Fund money. Such a solu
tion would benefit ASSU leaders by
giving them greater power to shape
campus life. But the arrangement
would still harm student organiza
tions — even if Stanford Fund
money were doled out by the ASSU
rather than the administration,
the policy would still restrict the
right of members of student groups
to mold their own organizations.
During last week's negotiations,
ASSU leaders fortunately resisted
the temptation to accept this pro
posed solution. But the danger
remains that in the ensuing com
mittee discussion ASSU leaders
might not be as adept at balancing
their conflicting interests. That
danger will persist even if the com
mittee does its best to seek input
from students through surveys,
focus groups and similar efforts.
The committee's membership
should be expanded to include at
least one student not affiliated
with the ASSU leadership. This
could be accomplished through a
ruahed; selection process by the
ASSU Nominations Commission
or even by personal solicitation of
members of organizations affected
by the policy, such as Stanford-In-
Government or The Stanford
Review.
Adding a committee member
from outside the ASSU Senate and
COP will help ensure that ASSU
leaders do not compromise the
goals of the student body. It will
also help affirm that the true goals
of the ASSU lie not in power-mon
gering or resume-packing but in
effective student advocacy.
