Increased acceptance of violence a nationwide problem

ON THE EVENING of Nov. 18 I
was walking home after having
been to an Archaeological Insti
tute of America session. While walking
through Escondido Village, I was cross
ing a pedestrian zone when a compact
car whipped around the corner. The
driver stopped and shouted out, "Excuse
me." Quite often people will attract a
stranger's attention so as to get direc
tions for negotiating the tortuous roads
of Stanford. That is not unusual at any
time of the day, and therefore I stopped
to look up and see what the person
wanted. The driver was pointing what
looked like the barrel of a pistol at me
and shouted something about handing
over what money I had on me. The
incongruity of someone stiffing a gradu
ate student was a bit too much. I stared
a moment, decided this was a ghastly
joke, and commenced walking. Laughter

could be heard raucously pouring from
the car as it sped away.
A couple of weeks earlier, I went into
Palo Alto with some friends to catch din
ner before seeing a movie, "Bullets over
Broadway." As my friends were driving
around trying to find a parking space
around 5:30 p.m., we happened across
someone who was about to leave a space.
The driver of the car in front of us had
been inattentive and only saw this per
son starting to leave after having passed
the space. The car in front decided to
back up on a main thoroughfare and
snatch the spot. Other cars were behind
us, and we could not have backed up
even had we so chosen. This individual
nonetheless seemed hell-bent on getting
that spot and threatened to ram us at
about 30 mph. When that did not pro
duce the desired result, that driver got
out of the car and, walking towards us,

started screaming obscenities. Finally,
something snapped and the driver got
back in and drove off. Needless to say,
we bypassed that parking space for fear
of finding razor blades in our tires.
Attentive readers will realize that I
have refrained from identifying the indi
viduals involved as well as I might. The
rationale for this is that I think such iden
tifications (clearly I don't know these peo
ple's names) are unhelpful in approaching
the general problem of which they are
examples. Stereotypes produce simple
answers that are good for politicians but
meaningless for those of us who have to
live in the society they mold.
Black or white, male or female, it
matters not. However convenient the
above two examples may be for my the
sis, they are not fictitious. Unfortunate
ly, they are actual events, and the things
said are accurately represented.

Recourse to violence is today much more
acceptable a means of individual expres
sion that it was 20 years ago, and this is
a general trend within the American
polity.
I have written this public letter
because I think the incidents of much
more importance to you, my readership,
as a collective entity, rather than to me
as an individual. These incidents repre
sent a malaise afflicting America, and
the particular illness is a growing
absence of civil discourse. Before some
thing can be done about it, it must be
identified. I have done what I can; it is
now up to you to work together, to coop
erate in improving the situation. Soci
ety, which veiy much includes you, is
the place where discourse is made or
not, as the case may be.
