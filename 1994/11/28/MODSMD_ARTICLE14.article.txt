# Story on student group opposing Prop. 187 did not tell complete story
## 
### 
I am writing in response to the Nov.
23 article concerning Proposition 187.1
am writing simply as an individual who
attended two student meetings and not
as a representative of any group. This
article contained blatant misrepresenta
tion and misreporting of an anti-Propo
sition 187 student meeting held Nov. 22
Information reported in the article was
incorrect and quotes were often taken
out of context, further distorting the
speakers' intent.

The article stated that the future of
the group was uncertain and that the
group'B purpose was not yet decided.
This is all incorrect and blatantly false,
as the group's purpose is very clear: to
fight Proposition 187 and its aftermath.
Also very clear is that the group com
prises students who have united against
Proposition 187. And the characteriza
tion of the group's future as uncertain
pertains to the uncertainty of the future
of Proposition 187.
It was also stated in the article that
students decided "to shy away from the
general goal of fighting racism." This is
again taken out of context. The senti
ment at the meeting was that fighting
racism was fighting Proposition 187.
There was no statement to "shy" away

from anything; people spoke instead of
the necessity of putting Proposition 187
in a larger framework.
The article portrayed the students as
disorganized, babbling and unsure, but
it appears that much that was reported
as the uncertainty of the group was
actually the uncertainty of The Daily.
