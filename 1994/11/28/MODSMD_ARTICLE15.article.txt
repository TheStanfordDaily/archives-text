# Co-signer of letter on humanities disagreed with some of its views

### 
Through miscommunication my
name appeared with others on a letter

published in the Nov. 21 edition of The
Daily. I share in general outline the con
cerns it expressed over the plight of the
humanities at Stanford, but I differ on
several particulars, especially the unfor
tunate foreshortening, "No wonder all
the top student scholars go elsewhere
now." While I, too, regret that we lose
many good prospects to our competitors,
it would be wrong to infer that lean-and
mean humanities programs like German
Studies are not recruiting excellent peo
ple under the imposed strict rationing
scheme. Calls to rebuild our field should
more clearly express solidarity with
today's students.
