## E pluribus, not yet unum 
### 
THE OTHER DAY at dinner, a
friend asked me my ethnic back
ground.
I must have looked a bit stunned, won
dering briefly if my stay in Japan had
affected me in ways I hadn't yet noticed.
I answered, rather unoriginally, "Well,
white, actually...."
"No, no, no. I mean, what country are
your ancestors from."
"Oh! Mainly Welsh, Irish, English,
French, some German." Trying to think of
something more exotic: "My mom's par
ents were both born in Canada. ..."
It was the first time anyone had
inquired about my ethnicity since a Native
American dinner during Orientation
Week, when an Onondaga asked what my
tribal affiliation was.
When filling out application forms, I
dutifully check off the box marked "Cau
casian," slightly cringing at the designa
tion, derived as it is from the historically
inaccurate theory that white people origi
nated in the Caucasus mountains. In this
era, one would think that a better term
could be found. I once suggested "Euro
pean American" to a (white) acquaintance,
who immediately and vehemently refused
to be called European in any way, citing as
evidence for the inappropriateness of the
label that not all white people are Euro
pean, for example Australians, whereupon
he rested his case and left the room.
A few days afler the dinner table inci
dent, I met a friend of a friend and asked

her where she was from. She answered,
"Oh, my father's parents are Pilipino and
Indian, and my mother is African Ameri
can, but I'm from Chicago." In such cases,
the "Other" box on application forms
comes in handy.
It wasn't until I came to Stanford that I
started thinking of myself as white.
Although born in America, I grew up in
Switzerland, where most of the people
around me were European. The main issue
there was whether one's ancestors were
from the same village. German-speaking
Swiss could distinguish themselves from
French-speaking Swiss, Italian-speaking
Swiss, Romansch-speaking Swiss and
Swiss that spoke with a different accent. I
escaped the whole affair by simply calling
myself American and would lecture my
friends at length on how in America, every
one just thought of themselves as Ameri
can, whether they were white, black, Chi
cano or Asian.
Upon coming here, I realized that reali
ty was a bit different. I found that Ameri
cans of a given ethnic group tended to clus
ter with members of their own ethnicity. I
hadn't expected the ethnic orientation pro
grams, the ethnic organizations, the ethnic
houses, the option to choose a freshman
roommate of one's own ethnicity, the
entire ethnic debate, quite frankly. Native
European American little me.
Then, I started to realize that much of
this was not happening without reason.
Calling oneself simply American might be

a bit difficult if not too many generations
ago, one's ancestors had been decimated by
Americans. Or if Americans had torn one's
ancestors away from their native country
and presumptuously claimed to own them.
Or if one's grandparents had spent years of
their lives in American internment camps.
Even now, a campus newspaper will
(rather pathetically) run an offensive cari
cature of a Native American. Or Sen. Jesse
Helms will threaten to sing "Dixie" to Sen.
Carol Moseley-Braun in an attempt to
make her cry. Some show of American
unity that is.
Nevertheless, I sometimes wonder if the
naive high school student leaving Switzer
land to come to Stanford was all that mis
guided in his ideals. What If Americans,
whether Asian or Caucasian or African-
Indian-Southeast Asian, were to take the
term "American" in its best sense, as
standing for equality, tolerance, individual
freedom, human dignity, social justice and
self-government? What if we called our
selves American as an unqualified person
al promise to strive for unity, rather than
qualify the term in deference to past and
present injustices and self-segregation?
Maybe I'll stop checking the "Cau
casian" box on those application forms
now.

Jonathan also considered omitting his
address from application forms but decid
ed against it.
