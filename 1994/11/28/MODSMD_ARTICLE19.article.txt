## Women's basketball crushes Texas Tech 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
Stanford 79
Texas Tech 60

Crunch time — the pressure-packed
stage of a game where true stars take over.
The zone — the place where an athlete wish
es to be but almost never is. There are only
few examples when a person is in both
places at the same time and location.
Last Friday, Anita Kaplan was one of
them. The senior center and finalist for the
Naismith Player of the Year award scored 29

points and hit crucial shots to lead second
ranked Stanford (2-0) to a 79-60 home victo
ry against sixth-ranked Texas Tech (3-2).
"I thought Kaplan was a big time go-to
player," said Texas Tech coach Marsha
Sharp.
In addition to leading the team in points,
Kaplan pulled down a team-high nine
rebounds. Time and time again, she grabbed
an offensive board and followed up with a
put-back which led to her high shooting per
centage. Kaplan ended the game shooting 12
of 17 from the floor.
"The biggest shot for her was the first
shot in the second half," Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "She got the
ball and went to the left-handed hook. It
really gave her confidence."
In the second half, Kaplan scored 19 of
her points and snared four rebounds. Step

ping up to help the Cardinal, most of her
scoring came when the Lady Raiders cut the
lead down from 14 to six. With 12 minutes,
56 seconds to go in the game, Kaplan
became a major force. She made a lay-up to
put Stanford up 52-44, drained a 15-foot
jumper from the free throw line and scored
again from the paint, all within a three
minute span.
With 9:08 remaining in the second half,
however, Kaplan picked up her fourth foul.
When she returned with 7:56 left in the
game she made a vow to her coaches.
"I promised them I wouldn't foul,"
Kaplan said.
From then on, she proceeded to hit a
jumper, convert a lay-up and left the game
having scored 10 of the 15 Cardinal points
during the next six minutes, all
while on the verge of disqualifi
cation from the game.
"They did a great job of get
ting me the ball," Kaplan said.
Despite sporadic attempts to
distribute the ball, time and
time again Stanford passed it to
Kaplan in the low post.
"If it's working, why bother
going somewhere else," said
sophomore forward Kate Star
bird.
Starbird added 15 points of
her own on several drives to the
basket and also led the team
with six assists. Kaplan and
Starbird were the only Cardinal
players to score in double digits
but they were not the only ones
to help the team.
"Everyone contributed,"
VanDerveer said. "It feels good
that you can go to the bench and
not worry.
"What this game did for me
was to help my confidence in
Naomi [Mulitauaopele]. It
helped my confidence in Vanes
sa [Nygaard]," VanDerveer
added.
The newcomers, Olympia
Scott, Mulitauaopele and red
shirt freshman Nygaard, freed
up Kaplan and allowed her to
concentrate more on putting the
ball in the basket. Scott chipped
in eight points and six boards
before fouling out, Muli
tauaopele added four points and
Nygaard contributed six points.
"We have the best low block
players in the country," senior
guard Kate Paye said.
Scott, Mulitauaopele and
Nygaard all played significant
minutes, in part due to the
injury freshmen forward
Heather Owen suffered early in
the game. Within seconds of
coming into the contest, Owen
and Starbird got tangled up
while defending an inbound
pass. Owen suffered a sprained
ligament in her ankle and did
not return.
Paye also played a major role
in the game. She added eight
points, including a three pointer
to begin the scoring, and had
four assists. However, her main
contribution came when she

was guarding the ball.
"I thought Kate Paye did a
great job [defensively] on (Lady
Raider Tabitha] Truesdale,"
VanDerveer said.
Paye held the senior forward
to only seven points on one-of
eight shooting. She also forced
Truesdale into an astounding 10
turnovers.
Texas Tech also had its prob
lems shooting the ball. The
Lady Raiders made only 43 per
cent from the floor and shot a
dismal 45 percent from the
charity stripe in the first half.
"I thought we would be able
to match [Stanford's] offense in
the first half, but we missed our
shots," Sharp said. "If we made
our free throws, we would have
been closer."
Michi Atkins led Texas Tech
with 19 points and Connie
Robinson chipped in 13 of her
own. Robinson was plagued by
foul problems throughout the
game and only played 20 min
utes, well below her norm.
"[Stanford] did a great job of
getting in your face," Sharp
said.
The game started out slowly,
with points few and far in
between. With 10 minutes gone
in the first half, Stanford and
Texas Tech combined for only
30 points and the Cardinal led
by two, 16-14. Turnovers were
plentiful and both teams missed
their shots.
"We need to do a better job of
moving the ball," VanDerveer
said. "I was disappointed with
some of the decisions that peo
ple made."
In the game, Stanford com
mitted 21 turnovers. The Cardi
nal also fouled the Lady Raiders
25 times.
"We have to quit fouling,"
VanDerveer added. "If everyone
goes in thinking that she can
give her two or three fouls, then
it adds up."
VanDerveer was pleased with
Stanford's play overall, howev
er.
"Two-and-0 against two top
-10 teams is pretty good," she
said. "I'm not saying that this
[game] was a piece of art. We
have a long way to go."

Stanford 79
Texas Tech 60

Crunch time — the pressure-packed
stage of a game where true stars take over.
The zone — the place where an athlete wish
es to be but almost never is. There are only
few examples when a person is in both
places at the same time and location.
Last Friday, Anita Kaplan was one of
them. The senior center and finalist for the
Naismith Player of the Year award scored 29

points and hit crucial shots to lead second
ranked Stanford (2-0) to a 79-60 home victo
ry against sixth-ranked Texas Tech (3-2).
"I thought Kaplan was a big time go-to
player," said Texas Tech coach Marsha
Sharp.
In addition to leading the team in points,
Kaplan pulled down a team-high nine
rebounds. Time and time again, she grabbed
an offensive board and followed up with a
put-back which led to her high shooting per
centage. Kaplan ended the game shooting 12
of 17 from the floor.
"The biggest shot for her was the first
shot in the second half," Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "She got the
ball and went to the left-handed hook. It
really gave her confidence."
In the second half, Kaplan scored 19 of
her points and snared four rebounds. Step

ping up to help the Cardinal, most of her
scoring came when the Lady Raiders cut the
lead down from 14 to six. With 12 minutes,
56 seconds to go in the game, Kaplan
became a major force. She made a lay-up to
put Stanford up 52-44, drained a 15-foot
jumper from the free throw line and scored
again from the paint, all within a three
minute span.
With 9:08 remaining in the second half,
however, Kaplan picked up her fourth foul.
When she returned with 7:56 left in the
game she made a vow to her coaches.
"I promised them I wouldn't foul,"
Kaplan said.
From then on, she proceeded to hit a
jumper, convert a lay-up and left the game
having scored 10 of the 15 Cardinal points
during the next six minutes, all
while on the verge of disqualifi
cation from the game.
"They did a great job of get
ting me the ball," Kaplan said.
Despite sporadic attempts to
distribute the ball, time and
time again Stanford passed it to
Kaplan in the low post.
"If it's working, why bother
going somewhere else," said
sophomore forward Kate Star
bird.
Starbird added 15 points of
her own on several drives to the
basket and also led the team
with six assists. Kaplan and
Starbird were the only Cardinal
players to score in double digits
but they were not the only ones
to help the team.
"Everyone contributed,"
VanDerveer said. "It feels good
that you can go to the bench and
not worry.
"What this game did for me
was to help my confidence in
Naomi [Mulitauaopele]. It
helped my confidence in Vanes
sa [Nygaard]," VanDerveer
added.
The newcomers, Olympia
Scott, Mulitauaopele and red
shirt freshman Nygaard, freed
up Kaplan and allowed her to
concentrate more on putting the
ball in the basket. Scott chipped
in eight points and six boards
before fouling out, Muli
tauaopele added four points and
Nygaard contributed six points.
"We have the best low block
players in the country," senior
guard Kate Paye said.
Scott, Mulitauaopele and
Nygaard all played significant
minutes, in part due to the
injury freshmen forward
Heather Owen suffered early in
the game. Within seconds of
coming into the contest, Owen
and Starbird got tangled up
while defending an inbound
pass. Owen suffered a sprained
ligament in her ankle and did
not return.
Paye also played a major role
in the game. She added eight
points, including a three pointer
to begin the scoring, and had
four assists. However, her main
contribution came when she

was guarding the ball.
"I thought Kate Paye did a
great job [defensively] on (Lady
Raider Tabitha] Truesdale,"
VanDerveer said.
Paye held the senior forward
to only seven points on one-of
eight shooting. She also forced
Truesdale into an astounding 10
turnovers.
Texas Tech also had its prob
lems shooting the ball. The
Lady Raiders made only 43 per
cent from the floor and shot a
dismal 45 percent from the
charity stripe in the first half.
"I thought we would be able
to match [Stanford's] offense in
the first half, but we missed our
shots," Sharp said. "If we made
our free throws, we would have
been closer."
Michi Atkins led Texas Tech
with 19 points and Connie
Robinson chipped in 13 of her
own. Robinson was plagued by
foul problems throughout the
game and only played 20 min
utes, well below her norm.
"[Stanford] did a great job of
getting in your face," Sharp
said.
The game started out slowly,
with points few and far in
between. With 10 minutes gone
in the first half, Stanford and
Texas Tech combined for only
30 points and the Cardinal led
by two, 16-14. Turnovers were
plentiful and both teams missed
their shots.
"We need to do a better job of
moving the ball," VanDerveer
said. "I was disappointed with
some of the decisions that peo
ple made."
In the game, Stanford com
mitted 21 turnovers. The Cardi
nal also fouled the Lady Raiders
25 times.
"We have to quit fouling,"
VanDerveer added. "If everyone
goes in thinking that she can
give her two or three fouls, then
it adds up."
VanDerveer was pleased with
Stanford's play overall, howev
er.
"Two-and-0 against two top
-10 teams is pretty good," she
said. "I'm not saying that this
[game] was a piece of art. We
have a long way to go."
