## Women's basketball crushes Texas Tech

Stanford 79
Texas Tech 60

Crunch time — the pressure-packed
stage of a game where true stars take over.
The zone — the place where an athlete wish
es to be but almost never is. There are only
few examples when a person is in both
places at the same time and location.
Last Friday, Anita Kaplan was one of
them. The senior center and finalist for the
Naismith Player of the Year award scored 29

points and hit crucial shots to lead second
ranked Stanford (2-0) to a 79-60 home victo
ry against sixth-ranked Texas Tech (3-2).
"I thought Kaplan was a big time go-to
player," said Texas Tech coach Marsha
Sharp.
In addition to leading the team in points,
Kaplan pulled down a team-high nine
rebounds. Time and time again, she grabbed
an offensive board and followed up with a
put-back which led to her high shooting per
centage. Kaplan ended the game shooting 12
of 17 from the floor.
"The biggest shot for her was the first
shot in the second half," Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "She got the
ball and went to the left-handed hook. It
really gave her confidence."
In the second half, Kaplan scored 19 of
her points and snared four rebounds. Step

ping up to help the Cardinal, most of her
scoring came when the Lady Raiders cut the
lead down from 14 to six. With 12 minutes,
56 seconds to go in the game, Kaplan
became a major force. She made a lay-up to
put Stanford up 52-44, drained a 15-foot
jumper from the free throw line and scored
again from the paint, all within a three
minute span.
With 9:08 remaining in the second half,
however, Kaplan picked up her fourth foul.
When she returned with 7:56 left in the
game she made a vow to her coaches.
"I promised them I wouldn't foul,"
Kaplan said.
From then on, she proceeded to hit a
jumper, convert a lay-up and left the game
having scored 10 of the 15 Cardinal points
