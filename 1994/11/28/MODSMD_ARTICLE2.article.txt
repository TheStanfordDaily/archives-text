# Water polo repeats as NCAA champs
## USC falls 14-10 to Cardinal 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
For the Stanford men's water
polo team, winning its second
consecutive NCAA title was as
easy as one, two, three.
The Cardinal (27-1) capped off
a tremendous season by romping
through the NCAA tournament
with three victories, defeating
Air Force, No. 5 UCLA and No. 2
use.
The NCAA title is coach Dante
Dettamanti's seventh in 18 years
as Cardinal coach and Stanford's
eighth overall. The victories in
1993 and 1994 mark the third
time Stanford has won back-to
back water polo championships.
The Cardinal accomplished the
feat in 1980-81 and 1985-86. For
junior Jeremy Laster, this year's
victory topped the championship
of' 93.
"This one is sweeter because
we were No. 1 all year and we
were supposed to win," said
Laster. "This year it was ours to
lose."
Laster earned tournament co-
MVP honors along with team
mates Jack Bowen and Frank
Schneider. The three were joined

on the all-tournament first team
by senior Wolf Wigo. Sophomore
Brian Wallin garnered a second
team selection.
Last night at Belmont Plaza
Olympic Pool in Long Beach,
Calif., the Cardinal drowned the
Trojans 14-10 in a rematch of
last year's championship finals.
In beating USC for the sixth con
secutive time this season and
11th straight dating back to last
year, the Cardinal showed why it
was nearly unbeatable through
out the campaign.
Stanford jumped out to a
quick 3-0 lead with two minutes
23 seconds remaining in the
opening period thanks to a two
point goal by Laster and a goal at
the end of a counterattack by ju
nior Josh Leachman.
While many of the fans who
packed Belmont may have
thought the Cardinal was on its
way to a blowout, Trojan junior
Drew Netherton thought other
wise. After a USC timeout,
Netherton responded by netting
a shot out of the hole, then nail
ing a two-pointer to tie the score
with 1:32 remaining in the first
