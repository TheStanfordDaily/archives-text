# Water polo repeats as NCAA champs
## USC falls 14-10 to Cardinal 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
For the Stanford men's water
polo team, winning its second
consecutive NCAA title was as
easy as one, two, three.
The Cardinal (27-1) capped off
a tremendous season by romping
through the NCAA tournament
with three victories, defeating
Air Force, No. 5 UCLA and No. 2
use.
The NCAA title is coach Dante
Dettamanti's seventh in 18 years
as Cardinal coach and Stanford's
eighth overall. The victories in
1993 and 1994 mark the third
time Stanford has won back-to
back water polo championships.
The Cardinal accomplished the
feat in 1980-81 and 1985-86. For
junior Jeremy Laster, this year's
victory topped the championship
of' 93.
"This one is sweeter because
we were No. 1 all year and we
were supposed to win," said
Laster. "This year it was ours to
lose."
Laster earned tournament co-
MVP honors along with team
mates Jack Bowen and Frank
Schneider. The three were joined

on the all-tournament first team
by senior Wolf Wigo. Sophomore
Brian Wallin garnered a second
team selection.
Last night at Belmont Plaza
Olympic Pool in Long Beach,
Calif., the Cardinal drowned the
Trojans 14-10 in a rematch of
last year's championship finals.
In beating USC for the sixth con
secutive time this season and
11th straight dating back to last
year, the Cardinal showed why it
was nearly unbeatable through
out the campaign.
Stanford jumped out to a
quick 3-0 lead with two minutes
23 seconds remaining in the
opening period thanks to a two
point goal by Laster and a goal at
the end of a counterattack by ju
nior Josh Leachman.
While many of the fans who
packed Belmont may have
thought the Cardinal was on its
way to a blowout, Trojan junior
Drew Netherton thought other
wise. After a USC timeout,
Netherton responded by netting
a shot out of the hole, then nail
ing a two-pointer to tie the score
with 1:32 remaining in the first

The Cardinal bombarded its opponents heavily throughout the
NCAA Championships.
quarter.
Stanford ended the scoring in the
opening frame as junior Dan Han
cock fired a goal past USC's Bren
dan Grubbs with the Cardinal play
ing a man-advantage situation.
The second quarter opened with
Schneider doing what he had done
till season long, turning his man in
the hole and drawing a penalty shot
from the referee.
The free shot fired from four
meters out of the cage was taken by
Wigo, the team's leading season
scorer with 71 goals. Wigo shot the
ball immediately on the referee's
whistle, but Grubbs guessed cor
rectly, diving to his lower right to
stuff the attempt.
Instead of falling behind 5-3, the
Trojans tied the score behind the
play of Netherton, who muscled a
shot from the hole past Cardinal
goaltender Bo wen.
The first half ended in a 5-5 dead
lock after Stanford's Daniel
Lehoczky and USC's Ivan Hurtado
traded goals midway through the
period. Bowen kept the Trojans
from grabbing the lead with just less
than two minutes left in the half,
blocking a one-on-one shot to pre
serve the tie.
Entering halftime, Dettamanti

was confident that his squad would
come through, yet he admitted to
feeling uneasy at times throughout
the match.
"We seem to have some magic
thing over [USC]" Dettamanti said.
"At times I thought ... maybe this
is their night."
But as it has on numerous occa
sions this year, the Cardinal owned
the third period of play.
"After halftime we tightened up
our defense," Dettamanti said. "We
have a feeling that the third quarter
is ours. I can think of at least a
dozen games that were close at the
half before we pulled away in the
third."
The statistics certainly support
the claims, as the Cardinal dominat
ed every phase of the game in the
crucial frame. Goals by Wigo and
Schneider put the Cardinal ahead 7-
5 before Wallin beat Grubbs from
two-point range to make the lead 9-
5 with two minutes left in the peri
od. Bowen knotched five of his 11
saves in the third quarter, as the
Trojans failed to score until just 25
seconds remained.
Much like last year, when Wigo
and Laster hit two-pointers to break
the game open, Wallin's outside
shot had a deflating effect on the
challengers.
"I'm definitely comfortable

shooting the bail out there," Wallin
said. "The shot was there all night.
We had to take advantage of their
dropping defense."
The Trojans utilized a swarming,
crashing defense around the hole in
an effort to contain Schneider.
While he was often forced to pass
from the center-forward position,
Schneider tipped in a pair of goals
and several assists in addition to
drawing two penalty shots.
Midway through the final period,
the Cardinal again grabbed a four
goal lead when Leach man scored
from long range in another Stan
ford man-advantage situation. The
shot nailed the right crossbar, hit
Grubbs in the back of the head and
landed in the back of the net.
At that point, the Cardinal held a
seemingly comfortable lead in the
final 3:39, yet the game's flow was
disrupted by several strange events.
On USC's ensuing possession,
the entire Stanford squad, including
Dettamanti, thought USC's Neal
Brockmeier had drawn a foul, which
would result in a free pass for the
Trojans. While the same player who
was fouled cannot shoot a free pass,
Brockmeier fired the ball from
beyond the two-point line.
Bowen ignored the shot, but ref
eree Bret Bernard ruled that a Tro
jan teammate had touched the ball
making the play live, and ruled the
shot good.
"I thought, 'I'd hate to lose the
NCAAs on a play like that'," Detta
manti said. "There were several
things that happened that could
have broken our backs — that two
pointer and [Wigo'sl two missed
penalty shots. But our guys just
went on playing."
After the teams traded unsuc
cessful possessions, Stanford
secured the opportunity it needed to
seal its second consecutive national
title.
With the Trojans looking to
score, USC's Uzi Hadar committed
an offensive foul on a drive. As Han
cock prepared to take the ensuing
free-throw, Hadar administered a
head-butt, resulting in an ejection.
Trojan assistant coach Jovan Vavic
disputed the call loudly, drawing a
warning from referee Bernard.
When Vavic continued his tirade, he
was tossed from the deck and a

bench foul was assessed to USC.
Playing with a six-on-four man
advantage, Hancock found Schnei
der open in front of the net. Schnei
der put the ball and the game away.
The Cardinal gave up a goal with 19
seconds remaining, and the scoring
was completed by Laster in the
same way he started it, hitting a two
pointer with one second on the clock
to make the final score 14-10.
The Cardinal reached the tour
nament finals by coasting through
its opening round match 20-6 over
Air Force, then downing UCLA 9-5
in the semifinals.
USC met Stanford after a semifi
nal rematch of last year, defeating
No. 3 California in a physical slug
fest, 11-6 on Saturday night.
"After [watching USC defeat
Call I was very worried," Dettaman

ti said. "They handled them fairly
easily, winning by five goals and
we've had trouble with Cal this
year."
While Wigo struggled in the final
game, his teammates did all they
could to keep the Ail-American
involved.
"Frank was the team cheerleader
the whole time," Dettamanti said.
"He was always encouraging in the
huddles and before games. He was
the inspirational leader tonight."
Schneider, who described the
feeling of winning his second NCAA
title as "impossible to wrap-up in
words" and"the best feeling I've
ever had," knew he had to keep the
team together throughout the tour
nament.
"I wanted to keep the team
focused," he said. "We didn't want

to lose the team feeling."
Wigo, who scored six goals in the
tournament, pointed out the bal
ance of this Cardinal squad.
"We showed what we've known
all year, that even if one or two of
our players are not having their best
game, we have enough weapons to
keep rolling," he said.
Afler the championship trophy
was securely in his hands, Detta
manti reflected on the history this
team has made.
"I told them if you win one
NCAA tile, you'll go down in history
as a good team that year," Detta
manti said. "But if you want to be
known as a great team, you have to
win back-to-bauk championships."

will go for one, two, three.
