At this weekend's Fry's Invitational tour
nament, Cardinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery learned two important things about
this year's team — how to win with and
without sophomore point guard Brevin
Knight.
Powered by Knight's career-high 31
points against Colgate (0-2) in a 82-70 victo
ry in the first game of the tournament, Stan
ford (2-0) then conquered the St. Peter's
Peacocks (1-1) 79-71 in the championship
game without its playmaker. Knight was
ejected with eight minutes, 42 seconds left in
the second half for arguing fouls and bump
ing a referee.
"It happened in a lull period," Mont
gomery said. "Things were not going partic
ularly well for us at that point and all of a
sudden balls started going in the hole for
them. If nothing else, [the technicals] served
as a wake-up call. We injected some emotion
into the game, we injected some enthusiasm
and some fire, and frankly that was probably
what was missing at that point."
Ahead 56-49 when Knight reached for a steal
against Peacock point guard Michael Frensley,

Stanford then saw both its point guard and siz
able lead disappear. Called for two questionable
fouls in 54 seconds, Knight argued the second
call and received the technical. A short discus
sion ended with a bump to the referee, and
Knight was tossed from the game.
Frensley knocked down both free throws
from the reach-in foul and then four techni
cal foul shots, cutting the Cardinal lead to
one and adding to his game-high total of 32.
However, senior David Harbour took over
for Knight at point and junior Dion Cross
scored nine of his 25 points over the final
eight minutes to secure the win.
Named tournament MVP for the second
straight year, Cross averaged 21.5 points in
two days of play and went 7-for-16 from
three-point range. Senior forward Andy Pop
pink joined Cross on the all-tournament
team with averages of 11.5 points and 9.5
rebounds per game. Frensley, Colgate's
Tucker Neale and Butler's Jon Newhouser
rounded out the all-tournament team.
After falling behind 8-2 with just three
minutes on the clock, Stanford turned up the
pressure on a 23-6 run over the next 10 min
utes. The Cardinal maintained a double-digit
lead for most of the game until Knight was
whistled for the technicals.
However, frfeshman center Tim Young
came through with two free throws and a
blocked shot to help Stanford push back out
to a five-point advantage. Plagued by foul
trouble, St. Peter's 7-foot center Bas de
Voogd only played for nine minutes before
fouling out, giving Young and his 7-foot-1
frame complete dominance in the lane.
"We were trying to get their big guys to
foul out," Cross said. "In the second half,
that's all we called were low post plays."
