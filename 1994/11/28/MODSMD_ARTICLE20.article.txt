St. Peter's 71

At this weekend's Fry's Invitational tour
nament, Cardinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery learned two important things about
this year's team — how to win with and
without sophomore point guard Brevin
Knight.
Powered by Knight's career-high 31
points against Colgate (0-2) in a 82-70 victo
ry in the first game of the tournament, Stan
ford (2-0) then conquered the St. Peter's
Peacocks (1-1) 79-71 in the championship
game without its playmaker. Knight was
ejected with eight minutes, 42 seconds left in
the second half for arguing fouls and bump
ing a referee.
"It happened in a lull period," Mont
gomery said. "Things were not going partic
ularly well for us at that point and all of a
sudden balls started going in the hole for
them. If nothing else, [the technicals] served
as a wake-up call. We injected some emotion
into the game, we injected some enthusiasm
and some fire, and frankly that was probably
what was missing at that point."
Ahead 56-49 when Knight reached for a steal
against Peacock point guard Michael Frensley,

Stanford then saw both its point guard and siz
able lead disappear. Called for two questionable
fouls in 54 seconds, Knight argued the second
call and received the technical. A short discus
sion ended with a bump to the referee, and
Knight was tossed from the game.
Frensley knocked down both free throws
from the reach-in foul and then four techni
cal foul shots, cutting the Cardinal lead to
one and adding to his game-high total of 32.
However, senior David Harbour took over
for Knight at point and junior Dion Cross
scored nine of his 25 points over the final
eight minutes to secure the win.
Named tournament MVP for the second
straight year, Cross averaged 21.5 points in
two days of play and went 7-for-16 from
three-point range. Senior forward Andy Pop
pink joined Cross on the all-tournament
team with averages of 11.5 points and 9.5
rebounds per game. Frensley, Colgate's
Tucker Neale and Butler's Jon Newhouser
rounded out the all-tournament team.
After falling behind 8-2 with just three
minutes on the clock, Stanford turned up the
pressure on a 23-6 run over the next 10 min
utes. The Cardinal maintained a double-digit
lead for most of the game until Knight was
whistled for the technicals.
However, frfeshman center Tim Young
came through with two free throws and a
blocked shot to help Stanford push back out
to a five-point advantage. Plagued by foul
trouble, St. Peter's 7-foot center Bas de
Voogd only played for nine minutes before
fouling out, giving Young and his 7-foot-1
frame complete dominance in the lane.
"We were trying to get their big guys to
foul out," Cross said. "In the second half,
that's all we called were low post plays."

Without Knight, Montgomery
simplified the game plan when Har
bour took over the point. Along with
the low post work of Young and
Poppink, Harbour and Cross
exploited the St. Peter's zone to
knock down a combined 6-for-ll
from the three-point line.
Playing in his first collegiate
games, Young put up impressive
numbers but still remarked on ner
vousness and hesitancy limiting his
game. Against the Peacocks, he
scored nine points, pulled down 12
rebounds and added three blocks. In
the Cardinal's win Friday night
against Colgate, Young managed
eight points, seven rebounds and
two blocks.
"It was a good game because we
pulled together and stuck together
as a team," Young said. "I just have
to relax more when I get the ball."
In Friday's game, the match-up
between Young and the Red
Raiders' freshman phenom Adonal
Foyle took a backseat to the
shootout between Knight and Col
gate's Neale. The second-leading
returning scorer in NCAA Division
I, Neale exploded for 28 against
Stanford and added 29 in the conso
lation game against Butler.
However, it was Knight burying
open jump shots and penetrating at
will which brought the fans to their
feet. Hitting 11-of-17 field goals and
7-of-ll free throws, Knight con
trolled the pace for much of the
game. He also added seven assists
and four steals.
Running out to an 18-4 lead over
the first seven minutes Friday,
Stanford watched its lead dissolve
behind Neale's barrage of jump
shots and offensive put-backs.
However, another run triggered
the beginning of the second half as
the Cardinal outscored the Red
Raiders 29-6 in the first seven-and
a-half minutes to lead 63-41. Col
gate never got within seven for the
rest of the game.
Foyle, one of the top recruits in
the nation, struggled with his offen
sive game as he went only 4-for-13
against Stanford. Defensively, he
knocked away six Cardinal shots
and affected numerous others with
his inside presence.
"It was like 'Welcome to col
lege,"' Foyle said.

Stanford and added 29 in the conso
lation game against Butler.
However, it was Knight burying
open jump shots and penetrating at
will which brought the fans to their
feet. Hitting 11-of-17 field goals and
7-of-ll free throws, Knight con
trolled the pace for much of the
game. He also added seven assists
and four steals.
Running out to an 18-4 lead over
the first seven minutes Friday,
Stanford watched its lead dissolve
behind Neale's barrage of jump
shots and offensive put-backs.
However, another run triggered
the beginning of the second half as
the Cardinal outscored the Red
Raiders 29-6 in the first seven-and
a-half minutes to lead 63-41. Col
gate never got within seven for the
rest of the game.
Foyle, one of the top recruits in
the nation, struggled with his offen
sive game as he went only 4-for-13
against Stanford. Defensively, he
knocked away six Cardinal shots
and affected numerous others with
his inside presence.
"It was like 'Welcome to col
lege,"' Foyle said.

At this weekend's Fry's Invitational tour
nament, Cardinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery learned two important things about
this year's team — how to win with and
without sophomore point guard Brevin
Knight.
Powered by Knight's career-high 31
points against Colgate (0-2) in a 82-70 victo
ry in the first game of the tournament, Stan
ford (2-0) then conquered the St. Peter's
Peacocks (1-1) 79-71 in the championship
game without its playmaker. Knight was
ejected with eight minutes, 42 seconds left in
the second half for arguing fouls and bump
ing a referee.
"It happened in a lull period," Mont
gomery said. "Things were not going partic
ularly well for us at that point and all of a
sudden balls started going in the hole for
them. If nothing else, [the technicals] served
as a wake-up call. We injected some emotion
into the game, we injected some enthusiasm
and some fire, and frankly that was probably
what was missing at that point."
Ahead 56-49 when Knight reached for a steal
against Peacock point guard Michael Frensley,

Stanford then saw both its point guard and siz
able lead disappear. Called for two questionable
fouls in 54 seconds, Knight argued the second
call and received the technical. A short discus
sion ended with a bump to the referee, and
Knight was tossed from the game.
Frensley knocked down both free throws
from the reach-in foul and then four techni
cal foul shots, cutting the Cardinal lead to
one and adding to his game-high total of 32.
However, senior David Harbour took over
for Knight at point and junior Dion Cross
scored nine of his 25 points over the final
eight minutes to secure the win.
Named tournament MVP for the second
straight year, Cross averaged 21.5 points in
two days of play and went 7-for-16 from
three-point range. Senior forward Andy Pop
pink joined Cross on the all-tournament
team with averages of 11.5 points and 9.5
rebounds per game. Frensley, Colgate's
Tucker Neale and Butler's Jon Newhouser
rounded out the all-tournament team.
After falling behind 8-2 with just three
minutes on the clock, Stanford turned up the
pressure on a 23-6 run over the next 10 min
utes. The Cardinal maintained a double-digit
lead for most of the game until Knight was
whistled for the technicals.
However, frfeshman center Tim Young
came through with two free throws and a
blocked shot to help Stanford push back out
to a five-point advantage. Plagued by foul
trouble, St. Peter's 7-foot center Bas de
Voogd only played for nine minutes before
fouling out, giving Young and his 7-foot-1
frame complete dominance in the lane.
"We were trying to get their big guys to
foul out," Cross said. "In the second half,
that's all we called were low post plays."

Senior forward Todd Manley stuffs it home
against St Peter's College last Saturday.
Without Knight, Montgomery
simplified the game plan when Har
bour took over the point. Along with
the low post work of Young and
Poppink, Harbour and Cross
exploited the St. Peter's zone to
knock down a combined 6-for-ll
from the three-point line.
Playing in his first collegiate
games, Young put up impressive
numbers but still remarked on ner
vousness and hesitancy limiting his
game. Against the Peacocks, he
scored nine points, pulled down 12
rebounds and added three blocks. In
the Cardinal's win Friday night
against Colgate, Young managed
eight points, seven rebounds and
two blocks.
"It was a good game because we
pulled together and stuck together
as a team," Young said. "I just have
to relax more when I get the ball."
In Friday's game, the match-up
between Young and the Red
Raiders' freshman phenom Adonal
Foyle took a backseat to the
shootout between Knight and Col
gate's Neale. The second-leading
returning scorer in NCAA Division
I, Neale exploded for 28 against
Stanford and added 29 in the conso
lation game against Butler.
However, it was Knight burying
open jump shots and penetrating at
will which brought the fans to their
feet. Hitting 11-of-17 field goals and
7-of-ll free throws, Knight con
trolled the pace for much of the
game. He also added seven assists
and four steals.
