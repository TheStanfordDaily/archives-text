proved a much tougher battle.
Pacific, also known as the
Tigers, pulled ahead of Stan
ford 8-5 in the first game.
"Pacific came out and played
really well," Shaw said. "And
we weren't playing our best."
Matters looked even more
grim for the Cardinal as the
Tigers scored their ninth point.
Setter-hitter Lisa Sharpley and
Ifejika stumbled into each
other and Sharpley went down.
The freshman re-injured an
ankle and had to leave the
game.
However, the overall talent
of the team pulled Stanford
through. Trailing 10-5, the
combination of sophomore
Catherine Juillard and junior
Maureen McLaren filled in for
Sharpley. The Cardinal went
on a 9-1 run to take a three
point lead.
"When Sharpley went down,
we thought the worst," Shaw
said. "But McLaren and Juil
lard played very well. Our
depth really played a part in the
win."
Cardinal players voiced the
same sentiment.
"It was a prime example of
our depth," senior Anne Wicks
said. "Lisa's a huge part of our
offense. For us to lose her and
come back like that is great. It
was a smooth transition and
really swung the momentum
around to us."
This comeback did not tame
the Tigers yet, however. Pacific
denied Stanford game point
and climbed into a 14-14 dead
lock with the Cardinal. The

Two teams of tigers
attempted to spoil the second
ranked Stanford women's vol
leyball squad's Thanksgiving
weekend. Instead, both found
themselves on the menu in a
Cardinal feast as Stanford cap
tured the 16th Annual Bankers
Classic in Stockton.
On Friday evening, the Car
dinal easily defeated LSU 15-3,
15-4, 15-1 to advance to the
tournament's championship
match. In that contest, Stan
ford downed No. 11 University
of the Pacific 16-14,15-2,15-10
to take the Classic's title.
LSU proved easy meat for
the Stanford women. The Car
dinal won the match in 45 min
utes, holding the Tigers to a
sub-zero hitting percentage of
-.145. In no game did LSU reg
ister a positive mark. Middle
blockers Barbara Ifejika, a
freshman, and Nikki Otto, a
sophomore, had seven and five
blocks, respectively.
Meanwhile, the Stanford
offense found all the holes in
the defense of its out-gunned
opponents. The Cardinal post
ed a .379 hitting average for the
match, led by junior Marnie
Triefenbach's eight kills and
.836 mark. Freshman Kristen
Folkl (10 kills, .471 average)
and Ifejika (6 kills, .400) also
did their own damage.
"[The Tigers] had a tough
time," said Stanford head
coach Don Shaw. "They had
been having a bad year and just
wanted to get it over with."
