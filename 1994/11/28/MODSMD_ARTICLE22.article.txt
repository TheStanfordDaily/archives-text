# Volleyball seeds anounced for NCAA Championships
## Stanford receives top seed in West Region 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
On Sunday, the NCAA announced the
pairings for the Division I Women's Volley
ball Championship tournament. As expect
ed, second-ranked Stanford (27-1) will
enter as the top-seeded team in the West
Region. The other No. 1 seeds include top
ranked Nebraska (29-0) in the Mideast,
third-ranked UCLA (28-3) in the South and
fourth-ranked Ohio State (26-2) in the
Northwest.
Stanford was also named the host of the
West Regionals, which will take place
December 8 and 9, should the team
advance that far.
"This is basically the way we figured it
would turn out," said Stanford head coach
Don Shaw. "So no surprises. We've been at
this a long time."
Although nothing unexpected happened,
the Cardinal players were happy to see how
matters had turned out.
"We're not surprised," senior captain
Anne Wicks said. "But it feels good to know
what's ahead of us."
The Cardinal, NCAA champion in 1992
and one of only five teams to make the
tournament every year in its 14-year histo
ry, will have to fight its way through a
tough West Region in its quest to capture a
second national title.

"As usual, the West is very strong,"
Shaw said. "If you look at the coaches' poll,
one-third of the ranked teams are in the
West bracket. The rest are spread out
through the other three, with the South
probably being the weakest."
The Cardinal, recipient of a first-round
bye, will host the winner of the Washington
(15-12) versus Wyoming (17-12) match. This
second-round match will take place Saturday
Dec. 3 at 1 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
If Stanford takes that contest, likely
opponents in the regionals include familiar
Pacific 10 Conference faces Arizona State
and USC, or possibly Brigham Young. These
are powerful opponents, but the Cardinal
will be playing on its home court. However,
as Shaw says, the location can cut both
ways.
"It's only a home court advantage if we
can get a lot of people to come out and see
us," he said. "It can also be a distraction.
The players will be surrounded by their
friends and it's right between Dead Week
and finals. We'll have to treat the regionals
like an away match to get in the right state
of mind."
The team is fairly confident that it can
handle the situation. After all, it's nothing
new, according to Wicks.
"It's basically the same every season,"
she said. "We have a routine, so it
shouldn't bother us."
