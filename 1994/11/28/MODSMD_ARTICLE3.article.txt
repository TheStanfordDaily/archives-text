# No contest pleas
## Misdemeanor vandalism case settled 
### Justin Pollard Staff writer 
Four Stanford students ac
cused of defacing the "Gay Libera
tion" sculpture last May entered
pleas of "no contest" to their misde
meanor charges of vandalism and
received sentences last Wednesday.
Justice Douglas Southard sen
tenced the defendants — senior
Mark Butterfield, junior Robert
Gardner, junior Jason White, and
former student Brian Dallimore —
to one year of court probation, or
dered them to comply with mone
tary and community-service penal
ties already imposed by Stanford
and required them to either perform
an additional 50 hours of communi
ty service or attend a course on tol
erance of alternative lifestyles.
The decision was handed down
after six previous pre-trial confer
ences.
The University has required
each student to pay a fine of $1,429
to cover the costs of restoration of
the sculpture, an additional puni
tive fine of $500 — reduced from an
original amount of $1,000 — and to

perform 100 hours of volunteer
work, Southard said. In addition,
Stanford has placed two of the stu
dents, Dallimore and Gardner, on
academic suspension for one quar
ter.
The defendants must also com
ply with restrictions on their colle
giate athletic activity and abide by
the conditions of a behavioral con
tract which they have signed with
the University, Southard said.
"Stanford is the owner of the
work of art... [The University has]
imposed a penalty that is very spe
cific," said Haig Harris Jr., Dal
limore's attorney. "The agreement
we have is that [ the defendants] will
comply with all of the conditions al
ready stipulated by Stanford."
The 50 hours of "volunteer work
as imposed by the court may be sus
pended" if the students enroll in an
"extra-credit class dealing with gay
and lesbian lifestyles 0r... the soci
ology of minority groups," Southard
said. The course must be pre-ap
proved by the court, he added.
Dallimore — who is now attend
ing the University of Nevada at Las
Vegas — has already completed a
course approved by Southard enti
tled "The Psychology of Prejudice"
at Foothill College, Southard said.
He added that the course suited his
requirements and recommended it
to the other defendants.
If the defendants elect to per
form the volunteer work it must
"further gay and lesbian relations
with the community" or be some
other activity that "fights prejudice
and misunderstanding," he added.
"It is hard to find a class as nar
row in scope as you specify," said
Robert Burmeister, White's attor
ney. Burmeister asked if "Human
Sexuality," a course offered by the
Human Biology Department,
would be acceptable to the court.

Southard replied that he would
have to review the course materi
als and syllabus before making his
decision.
Southard said the goal of the
service or course requirement was
to force the vandals "to under
stand alternate lifestyles and be
more accepting of them."
The defendants must comply
with all of the terms imposed by the
court by May 31, 1995, at which
point they must present proof that
they have fulfilled the court's
requirements, Southard said.
Attorneys for the defendants
would not comment on whether
they found the sentences imposed
by Southard to be fair.
"This was just a sad and unfor
tunate circumstance, and it's
over," said Robert Carey, Butter
field's attorney.
Diane Doolittle, the deputy dis
trict attorney prosecuting the case,
could not lie reached for comment.
