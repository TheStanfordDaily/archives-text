# Team places second in computer contest
## 
### Hudson Sangree 
While their football teams were
pummeling each other in last
week's Big Game, the Stanford and
UC-Berkeley computer teams also
went head-to-head in the Pacific
Regional Round of the 19th Annual
International Collegiate Program
ming Contest.
As in the football game, Stanford
was barely edged out, taking second
place in the contest held Nov. 19 in
San Francisco.
But the Cardinal computer team
still has an opportunity to take it all
in the Super Bowl of programming.
In March, they will participate in
the contest's final round in Mem
phis, Tenn., where they will com
pete against teams from around the
world and regional champions from
the United States.
Stanford has won the interna
tional round of the competition

more times than any other univer
sity, said team member Benjamin
Wu, a first year graduate student.
UC-Berkeley also won the re
gional competition last year while
Stanford placed seventh, he
added.
In the competition, the teams
were given five hours to solve eight
programming problems. Stanford
and UC-Berkeley tied, both solving
six of the eight problems, Wu said.
The match was decided by penal
ty points, given for incorrect solu
tions and the time it took to solve
the problems.
Stanford was behind for much of
the contest but pulled ahead in the
last half hour, solving one problem
in the last five minutes and another
in the last five seconds, Wu said.
Stanford's second team placed
third in the contest, also solving six
problems, but only the top two
teams in each regional competi
tion advanced to the internation
al round.
Wu, senior Tony Cannon and
sophomore Christian Shelton
made up Stanford's "A-Team."
The "B-team" consisted of senior
Brian Becker, senior Patrick
Kenny and graduate student
Svetlozar Nestorav. All team
members are computer science
mtyors, Wu said.
Stanford team members were
chosen in a University-wide com
petition held Nov. 5. All Stanford
students are eligible to compete
for spots on the team, though
each team is allowed only one
graduate student.
The programming problems
were "tricky," said Wu. For exam
ple, one problem involved pro
gramming the computer to move
a chess piece from one position on
the board to another without
landing on certain spaces.
The teams submitted answers
which they believed were cor
rect, but if they were incorrect,
they had to do them over, he
added.
Stanford won a second place
plaque and two programming
packages from Microsoft, which
sponsored the competition, Wu
said.
