While their football teams were
pummeling each other in last
week's Big Game, the Stanford and
UC-Berkeley computer teams also
went head-to-head in the Pacific
Regional Round of the 19th Annual

As in the football game, Stanford
was barely edged out, taking second
place in the contest held Nov. 19 in

In March, they will participate in
the contest's final round in Mem

world and regional champions from

Stanford has won the interna
tional round of the competition

more times than any other univer

Wu, a first year graduate student.
UC-Berkeley also won the re
gional competition last year while
Stanford placed seventh, he
added.
In the competition, the teams
were given five hours to solve eight
programming problems. Stanford
and UC-Berkeley tied, both solving
six of the eight problems, Wu said.
The match was decided by penal
ty points, given for incorrect solu
tions and the time it took to solve
the problems.
Stanford was behind for much of
the contest but pulled ahead in the
last half hour, solving one problem
in the last five minutes and another
in the last five seconds, Wu said.
Stanford's second team placed
third in the contest, also solving six
