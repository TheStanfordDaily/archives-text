## New student group discusses traditional sex ethics 
### Matt Flores 
Whether people are hanging out at a party
or chatting over lunch, sex — specifically pre
marital sex — always spurs controversy.
Since the explosion of ADDS and teen preg
nancy, society has delivered predominately
one protective message: practice safe sex.
A new group on campus, however, say it
would like to offer another option. Students
for a Traditional Sexual Ethic is dedicated to
preserving the traditional institution of mar
riage and the virtue of chastity, group mem
bers said.
Founded this summer, the group began
meeting last month in order to inform people
of the option of abstinence.
"Basically, we were founded because we
saw the necessity to provide the relatively
under-represented viewpoint that abstinence
before marriage is a very good and real op
tion," said Vincent Mooney, a chemical engi
neering grad student and co-president of the

group.
Mooney believes, as a general rule, society
is more accepting of premarital sex than it is of
chastity.
"Many times there exists an underlying
presupposition that sex outside of marriage is
normal or even expected — we want to say that
it is healthier and better to wait until mar
riage," he said.
"It is not only healthier physically but espe
cially emotionally," said coterminal student
and co-president Melissa Cheok.
Mooney said his personal experience has
shown him why it is emotionally healthier for
people to remain chaste.
"I i-sed to think that sex wasn't only for
marriage but in high school I began to see that
when my friends dated, had sex and eventual
ly broke up, there was always a great deal of
anger and hurt," he said.
Conversely, Mooney found that here-
mained friends with his former girl
friends when chastity was main
tained during the relationship.
Over the years, society has
stressed the idea of safe sex so much
that it seems the alternative of
abstinence has, in a sense, been lost
in the mix, Mooney said. The group
emphasizes the importance of open
mindedness and open dialogue.
"We're very open, very willing,
and very happy to discuss this issue
with anyone — our intent is not to
conflict with or attack anyone as a
person," Mooney said. "I have
friends who disagree with our ideas
and the only way to achieve any
progress is through charitable dis
course. "
"Even though others may not
agree with our views," he explained,

"we hope that they recognize that
our intent is to serve and educate
purely out of concern for them and
their well being."
The new group sees itself not
only as a supportive community
looking to help those interested in
preserving marriage and chastity
but also as a group looking to
spread its beliefs.
"We believe that what we are
doing is good, so naturally we want
to spread the word," Cheok said.
"We would like to get our message
out to the community through
active education."
The group has promoted educa
tion on the topic by sponsoring on
campus lectures by Raymond Den
nehy, chair of the Department of
Philosophy at the University of San
Francisco, concerning chastity and
virtue. It is looking to sponsor simi
lar lectures in the future.
Because it is a new group, reac
tion from the Stanford community

has been minimal. Some individual
opinions have, however, begun to
surface.
"Marriage and chastity have
their places but certainly should
not be the only options," said
sophomore David Orr, a volunteer
for the Safer Sex Shoppe. "People
are going to have sex, and this
group needs to realize that fact."
The group's members, however,
said they do not condemn sex.
"We believe that sex is a wonder
ful and positive thing; so important
in fact that it is a statement of
love," Mooney said. "Therefore, the
authentic expression of that love
occurs after a public statement of
marriage — chastity affirms the
value of sex."
The group demonstrated what
they believe to be the destructive
nature of sex before marriage by
citing an article by Thomas Lick
ona, professor at the State Univer
sity of New York, called "Teaching

Abstinence to Teenagers." In the
article Lickona quotes an anony
mous young husband:
"I would do anything, anything
to forget the sexual experiences I
had before I met my wife. When we
start having intercourse, the pic
tures of the past and the other
women go through my head, and
it's killing any intimacy. The truth
is, I've been married to this won
derful woman for eight years and
I've never been 'alone' in the bed
room with her."
It is this feeling of regret that the
group hopes to avoid through absti
nence.
Cheok also said she believes
many times people enter into sex
unprepared and unaware of the
consequences.
"If you cannot handle marriage,
how can you handle sex?" Cheok
said. "Sex may bring with it a num
ber of things you may not be ready
to deal with, including a child."
