# Finding Stanford a positive challenge, Jews uphold religious traditions
## 'Enhancing the sense of being Jewish' 
### Gia Cobb 
Editor's note: This is the first in a series of
three articles discussing the experiences of
conservative religious students at Stan
ford.

Men and women file into the little li
brary lined with Hebrew texts and sit
among other students. Some — with their
yarmulkes bobby pinned in place — are al
ready reciting Hebrew prayers, greeting
the Sabbath. They sing psalms from a sid
dur, a prayer book, at times falling into si
lence or merely letting the words seep from
their lips in whispers.
So begins the weekly observance of the
Sabbath for the handful of Jewish stu
dents who choose to attend traditional
egalitarian services tailored for more Or
thodox and conservative Jews.
On Friday nights, they gather at Hillel,

a foundation which offers Shabbat ser
vices and programming on campus. Be
cause only about 10 percent of the under
graduate population is Jewish, the more
conservative group is relatively small.
Despite their small number, many reli

gious Jews feel completely at ease on such
a liberal campus — although they ac
knowledge the difficulties Stanford can
pose. They, like most students, are chal
lenged and changed by the new freedoms
and demands of living away from one's
parents and religious community.
"College is a great time of testing," said
Rabbi Ari Cartun of the Hillel Foundation.
"People of all religions test their own com
mitments."
Sophomore Josh Rosenblum, who was
raised as an Orthodox Jew, said he now
considers himself atheist.
"If there is some superior power, why is
it not acting to right some of the wrongs in
the world?" he said. "I don't know if I'll re
turn to the fold because I can't predict reli
gion." Nevertheless, he continues to ob
serve some of his former conservative

practices, such as eating Kosher
foods.
On the other hand, freshman
Alex Rayskin, who graduated from
a Jewish high school in New York,
said his college experience has
strengthened his beliefs.
"Stanford has been enriching
because I've been in the context of
other cultures here. It has
enhanced my sense of being Jew
ish," he said. "Stanford is a micro
cosm. It is a litmus test — if I want
to be Jewish I have that choice. On
the East Coast there is more pres
sure to be part of a Jewish group."
Rayskin added that he is the first
student from his school, Yeshivah
of Flatbush, to attend Stanford.
"California is associated with a
spiritual wasteland among Ortho
dox Jews," he said. "It is not the
place to be for very religious Jews.
For me though, religion is a person
al thing. If you want it, you can
have it anywhere."
Rosenblum questions whether
Stanford has the resources to satis
fy Orthodox Jews, saying that the
few graduate students who are
Orthodox probably prefer to attend
synagogues off campus.
He said Hillel and the Jewish
community tend to promote more
liberal interpretations of the Bible,
correct religious observance and
issues like homosexuality, abortion

and women's roles.
Even Biblical readings assigned
in the required Cultures, Ideas and
Values course could create prob
lems for some Orthodox Jews, he
said.
"The professors would do well to
keep in mind that the Bible is an
important book for a lot of people.
Some of the professors' conclusions
are less than Orthodox," he said,
although Rosenblum, Ray skin, and
sophomore Jew Seth Yoskowitz
said they found their CIV discus
sions insightful.
The struggle some Jewish stu
dents face consists, not necessarily
of choosing to remain religious, but
of deciding how observant to be.
Many fuid themselves being tugged
back and forth along a religious
spectrum that runs from Orthodox
practices at one end to Reform at
the other.
Yoskowitz said his goal is "to
keep as much traditional obser
vance as possible and at the same
time adapt to the modern world."
He said he remains true to the
spirit of Jewish laws, but does not
hesitate to change his observance of
certain practices to adapt to college
life. For example, before coming to
Stanford, he did not go out on Fri
day nights or do any work on the
Sabbath.
The structure of college life can
pose additional problems for Jews
who wish to eat Kosher or eat
according to Jewish dietary laws.
Jews, depending on how Kosher
they are, usually eat only certain

kinds of meat and meat that has
been killed and served properly.
Utensils used for meat and dairy
products are to be kept separate as
well.
"It was shocking when I came
here as a freshman. I went the first
10 weeks without eating meat,"
Yoskowitz said. "But California
makes it easy to find things to eat
because so many people are vegetar
-1 M
ian.
Because many Jewish religious
holidays do not coincide with Stan
ford's breaks, some Jews find it dif
ficult to observe their holidays away
from home for the first time. Yom
Kippur — the Day of Atonement —
fell on Yoskowitz's second day of
freshman orientation.
"It was daunting not knowing
anyone at Hillel, but now it feels
like a family away from family," he
said.
Rayskin said celebrating away
from home means adjusting some
traditions. For Chanukah this year
he won't light a menorah in his
room because of the firo danger it
poses for his roommates. Instead,
he will light the candles at Hillel.
Kayskin added Hillel fills him
with the sense of Jewish communi
ty which he lost after leaving his
Jewish high school.
"Hillel makes up for that bond.
There is a wealth of things offered
here to match any personal taste or
preference," he said. "I don't feel
intimidated. Stanford life has never
interfered with what I want or need
to do as a Jew."

to be Jewish I have that choice. On
the East Coast there is more pres
sure to be part of a Jewish group."
Rayskin added that he is the first
student from his school, Yeshivah
of Flatbush, to attend Stanford.
"California is associated with a
spiritual wasteland among Ortho
dox Jews," he said. "It is not the
place to be for very religious Jews.
For me though, religion is a person
al thing. If you want it, you can
have it anywhere."
Rosenblum questions whether
Stanford has the resources to satis
fy Orthodox Jews, saying that the
few graduate students who are
Orthodox probably prefer to attend
synagogues off campus.
He said Hillel and the Jewish
community tend to promote more
liberal interpretations of the Bible,
correct religious observance and
issues like homosexuality, abortion

and women's roles.
Even Biblical readings assigned
in the required Cultures, Ideas and
Values course could create prob
lems for some Orthodox Jews, he
said.
"The professors would do well to
keep in mind that the Bible is an
important book for a lot of people.
Some of the professors' conclusions
are less than Orthodox," he said,
although Rosenblum, Ray skin, and
sophomore Jew Seth Yoskowitz
said they found their CIV discus
sions insightful.
The struggle some Jewish stu
dents face consists, not necessarily
of choosing to remain religious, but
of deciding how observant to be.
Many fuid themselves being tugged
back and forth along a religious
spectrum that runs from Orthodox
practices at one end to Reform at
the other.
Yoskowitz said his goal is "to
keep as much traditional obser
vance as possible and at the same
time adapt to the modern world."
He said he remains true to the
spirit of Jewish laws, but does not
hesitate to change his observance of
certain practices to adapt to college
life. For example, before coming to
Stanford, he did not go out on Fri
day nights or do any work on the
Sabbath.
The structure of college life can
pose additional problems for Jews
who wish to eat Kosher or eat
according to Jewish dietary laws.
Jews, depending on how Kosher
they are, usually eat only certain

kinds of meat and meat that has
been killed and served properly.
Utensils used for meat and dairy
products are to be kept separate as
well.
"It was shocking when I came
here as a freshman. I went the first
10 weeks without eating meat,"
Yoskowitz said. "But California
makes it easy to find things to eat
because so many people are vegetar

Because many Jewish religious
holidays do not coincide with Stan
ford's breaks, some Jews find it dif
ficult to observe their holidays away
from home for the first time. Yom
Kippur — the Day of Atonement —
fell on Yoskowitz's second day of
freshman orientation.
"It was daunting not knowing
anyone at Hillel, but now it feels
like a family away from family," he
said.
Rayskin said celebrating away
from home means adjusting some
traditions. For Chanukah this year
he won't light a menorah in his
room because of the firo danger it
poses for his roommates. Instead,
he will light the candles at Hillel.
Kayskin added Hillel fills him
with the sense of Jewish communi
ty which he lost after leaving his
Jewish high school.
"Hillel makes up for that bond.
There is a wealth of things offered
here to match any personal taste or
preference," he said. "I don't feel
intimidated. Stanford life has never
interfered with what I want or need
to do as a Jew."

Editor's note: This is the first in a series of
three articles discussing the experiences of
conservative religious students at Stan
ford.

Men and women file into the little li
brary lined with Hebrew texts and sit
among other students. Some — with their
yarmulkes bobby pinned in place — are al
ready reciting Hebrew prayers, greeting
the Sabbath. They sing psalms from a sid
dur, a prayer book, at times falling into si
lence or merely letting the words seep from
their lips in whispers.
So begins the weekly observance of the
Sabbath for the handful of Jewish stu
dents who choose to attend traditional
egalitarian services tailored for more Or
thodox and conservative Jews.
On Friday nights, they gather at Hillel,

a foundation which offers Shabbat ser
vices and programming on campus. Be
cause only about 10 percent of the under
graduate population is Jewish, the more
conservative group is relatively small.
Despite their small number, many reli

gious Jews feel completely at ease on such
a liberal campus — although they ac
knowledge the difficulties Stanford can
pose. They, like most students, are chal
lenged and changed by the new freedoms
and demands of living away from one's
parents and religious community.
"College is a great time of testing," said
Rabbi Ari Cartun of the Hillel Foundation.
"People of all religions test their own com
mitments."
Sophomore Josh Rosenblum, who was
raised as an Orthodox Jew, said he now
considers himself atheist.
"If there is some superior power, why is
it not acting to right some of the wrongs in
the world?" he said. "I don't know if I'll re
turn to the fold because I can't predict reli
gion." Nevertheless, he continues to ob
serve some of his former conservative

practices, such as eating Kosher
foods.
On the other hand, freshman
Alex Rayskin, who graduated from
a Jewish high school in New York,
said his college experience has
strengthened his beliefs.
"Stanford has been enriching
because I've been in the context of
other cultures here. It has
enhanced my sense of being Jew
ish," he said. "Stanford is a micro
cosm. It is a litmus test — if I want
to be Jewish I have that choice. On
the East Coast there is more pres
sure to be part of a Jewish group."
Rayskin added that he is the first
student from his school, Yeshivah
of Flatbush, to attend Stanford.

spiritual wasteland among Ortho
dox Jews," he said. "It is not the
place to be for very religious Jews.
