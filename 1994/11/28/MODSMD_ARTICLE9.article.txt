## Defense Secretary Perry concedes Serbian victory 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Serbs have
effectively won the war in Bosnia and NATO
air power cannot change that course, Defense
Secretary William Perry said yesterday.
"It seems that the Serbs have demonstrat
ed military superiority on the ground," Perry
said on NBC's "Meet the Press." He said he
saw "no prospect" of the Bosnian govern
ment winning back any of the 70 percent of
the country held by Serbian forces.
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole,
appearing on the same show, called the inter
national effort to end the war a "classic fail
ure" and urged that the U.N. peacekeeping
mission there be terminated.
Perry's statement came as Bosnian Serbs
were on the verge of taking control of the
Muslim enclave of Bihac, a U.N. safe area, in
northwest Bosnia.
Even if the U.N. authorized more NATO
air strikes to punish the Serbs for their
aggression, Perry said, "The air strikes can
not determine the outcome of the ground
combat."
Perry also emphasized that U.S. ground
troops would not become involved in hostili
ties in Bosnia, and that the 2,000 Marines on
three U.S. warships off Bosnia's shores
would be used only for "contingen<y" and res
cue operations.
"The possibility of downed aircraft and
pilots needing rescue is not remote," Perry
said.

Dole, R-Kan., a strong critic of the adminis
tration's Bosnia policy, said it "may be time to
get the U.N. protection forces out of there."
U.N. officials, concerned about possible
retaliation against the 24,000 U.N. peace
keepers in Bosnia, have been reluctant to
approve NATO air strikes against Serbian
positions. The U.N. Security Council has
refused to sanction NATO attacks to stop the
latest Serb offensive against Bihac.
"This is a classic failure where NATO has
been tied in knots and they've almost become
irrelevant," Dole said.
Dole, the next Senate majority leader, sup
ports lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia's
Muslims. He said U.N. resolutions creating
safe havens in the war-torn country have
become meaningless.
"Who cares what the U.N. does?" Dole
asked, adding that the new Republican
majority would take a "hard look" at U.S.
financial support for the United Nations.
"The president is going to have to stop relying
on the United Nations and start looking at
whether we are going to be a part of NATO."
Perry acknowledged that NATO is "pow
erless to conduct air strikes to influence the
situation" without U.N. approval, but he said
he opposed unilateral U.S. action to lift the
arms embargo.
It would drive U.N. troops out of Bosnia,
he said, and"it would lead to a widening of
the war. It would lead to more violence."
