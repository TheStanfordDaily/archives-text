HOUSE FOR RENT!!
We have a Barron Park house for rent. It is about six minutes by
bike from Tresidder.
This 3(4) bedroom, 3 bath house can accommodate up to eight
students comfortably, with a hardwood floor dance/party room (about
14 by 24 feet, I think; though I am not sure). It is designed to allow
closing off two of the bedrooms and a bath into a separate, individual
unit, if desired, with a private entrance. You could even have a
refrigerator and microwave in the hallway if it was closed off.
There is PLENTY of parking; only four spaces are off the street
(though we have had two cars in the garage and four in the driveway
with plenty of room).
There is a fenced back yard with a spa and a sauna.
We intend to furnish the utilities, except telephone. We'll take care
of the yard, etc. We could arrange for housekeeping and a cook, if
desired (this would be extra, of course).
To make our finances work, we need $2800.00 per month, with a
$3000.00 deposit. It can be available right away. It has a refrigerator,
dishwasher, disposal, washer, and dryer. We would negotiate
furnishing it, also, but that would be $200.00 extra
per month.
ANYONE INTERESTED?
