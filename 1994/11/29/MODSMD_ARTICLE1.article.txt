# Boycott grapes?
## Students suggest options at meeting 
### Ben Sussman Contributing writer 
Hoping to provide an open
forum for the Stanford commu
nity, the 10-member Grape Pol
icy Committee held its final
public hearing last night with a
sparse audience of about 20 in
Kresge Auditorium.
The hearing marked the
final stage in the committee's
information-gathering efforts,
said Political Science Prof. Luis
Fraga, the committee chair.
Committee members will
now formulate their own con
clusions about the University's
grape policy, and then attempt

to come to a general consensus.
"We still have to argue," Fraga
said.
Several students provided
strong testimony for a ban on
table grapes.
Quoting from the Universi
ty's 1885 charter, sophomore


Nat Pearson â€” Daily
Leticia Madrigal said that Stanford
should " 'exercise an influence in
behalf of humanity and civiliza
tion,' " and called the grape boycott
an issue of "humanity and basic
human rights."
"The University has a responsi
bility to respond to the concerns of
its students," she said.
The committee then turned its
focus to the experiences of Stan
ford students from families of farm
workers.
"It*B really hard to work; the
conditions aren't good," explained

junior Mireya Samaniego, who
worked in California grape fields
for most of her childhood.
Samaniego added that farm
workers "can't do anything
because (they) need the money."
She also said that, unlike herself,
many child farm workers are not
able to escape the fields.
"Even the children who do get
out of the Fields are affected,"
added freshman Cecilia Balli. Her
father, who drove trucks filled with
grape pesticides, died of cancer
when she was 10 years old.
Senior Abdi Soltani, another
speaker, said the "most responsible
decision" that the committee could
make would be to support the boy
cott because "no clear evidence

[exists] that pesticides are not
harmful" to farm workers.
The committee was formed in
response to last year's hunger
strike, in which one of the demands
was a University-wide boycott on
table grapes in concert with a simi
lar action by the United Farm
Workers. That boycott stemmed
from widespread reports of nega
tive health effects suffered as a
result of contact with pesticides
used to cultivate grapes.
Committee members must
decide whether the University
should comply with this boycott
and, if not, what action should be
taken.
"We wanted to be as fully and
comprehensively informed as we

could be," Fraga said.
Those who attended, however,
gave strong testimony in support of
the proposed grape boycott.
Although no speakers at the
hearing openly addressed reasons
not to boycott grapes, Fraga did list
several such issues, including
whether support for the boycott
would unfairly limit student choic
es, and whether it is "appropriate
for the University to take a stand
on an issue of this sort."
The Grape Policy Committee is
scheduled to deliver its final report
on the grape policy to University
officials before the end of the quar
ter. However, many expect the
final report to be delayed, as Fraga
said, "we may get an extension."
