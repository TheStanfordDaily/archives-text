# Boycott grapes?
## Students suggest options at meeting 
### Ben Sussman Contributing writer 
Hoping to provide an open
forum for the Stanford commu
nity, the 10-member Grape Pol
icy Committee held its final
public hearing last night with a
sparse audience of about 20 in
Kresge Auditorium.
The hearing marked the
final stage in the committee's
information-gathering efforts,
said Political Science Prof. Luis
Fraga, the committee chair.
Committee members will
now formulate their own con
clusions about the University's
grape policy, and then attempt

to come to a general consensus.
"We still have to argue," Fraga
said.
Several students provided
strong testimony for a ban on
table grapes.
