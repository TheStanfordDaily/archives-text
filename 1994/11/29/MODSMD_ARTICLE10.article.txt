Serbs have advantage
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — Rebel Serbs were reported in
hand-to-hand combat yesterday with
defenders of the last government
stronghold in northwest Bosnia. West
ern diplomats, stung by the United
Nations' inability to save the "safe
zone," scrambled to broker a cease
fire.
There was little sign that Bosnia's
Serbs would agree to one — except on
their terms. They have seized up to 40
percent of the safe zone in the Bihac
enclave that was declared off-limits to
combat by the United Nations, and
they were intent on forcing the govern
ment garrison there to surrender.
The Serbs' war gains have created a

crisis for the international community.
Three NATO airstrikes on Serb posi
tions last week were ineffective, and
more than 400 U.N. peacekeeping
troops have been detained by the Serbs
to ward off more attacks.
Britain's defense secretary criti
cized remarks by Senate Republican
leader Bob Dole that Britain and
France were partly to blame for the
failure of the U.N. — NATO mission in
Bosnia. Both countries fear NATO
attacks would trigger Serb retaliation
against their peacekeeping troops.
The Serbs launched the war two
and-a-half years ago when they
rebelled against a move by Bosnia's
Croats and Muslims to secede from
Yugoslavia. The war has left 200,000
people dead or missing.

Clinton fights for GATT
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton assembled the economic stars
from eight previous administrations
yesterday to give a final push for con
gressional approval of a 123-nation
trade agreement. "We have to do it
now. We can't wait until next year,"
he declared.
Supporters predicted that the
rewrite of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade would sail through
the House today with perhaps as
many as 60 votes to spare.
But the fate of the trade deal was
far less certain in the 100-member
Senate, where it must win 60 votes on
a procedural question of waiving the
Senate's budget rules.
