# Jeffrey Dahmer killed
## Mass-murderer attacked in maximum-security prison

MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Jeffrey Dah
mer was attacked and killed while cleaning
a prison bathroom yesterday in a grue
some end for the former chocolate-factory
worker who strangled and dismembered
17 boys and men and ate some of them.
Another inmate was being held in Dah
mer's slaying and in the severe beating of
another prisoner at Columbia Correction
al Institution. Authorities wouldn't identi
fy the suspect, who was serving a life sen
tence for murder, or offer a motive.
All three men were working on a clean
ing detail in the recreation area of the
maximum-security prison when the attack
occurred.
A bloody broom handle was found at
the scene, but Corrections Secretary
Michael Sullivan said he didn't know if it
was the murder weapon.

"One could surmise a number of things.
Their heads could have been smashed
against a wall," Sullivan said.
"There was a great deal of blood in the
area of the attack," Corrections Depart
ment spokesman Joe Scislowicz said.
The 34-year-old Dahmer had extensive
head injuries and died at a hospital about
an hour after he was found.
Dahmer, who had been imprisoned
since his crimes came to light in 1991, had
been attacked once before. In July, an
inmate tried to cut his throat during a
chapel service, but the razor blade
attached to a plastic handle fell apart
before it could hurt Dahmer.
At the time, Sullivan said that it appeared
to have been an isolated incident and that
Dahmer, who was serving 16 life sentences,
was not believed to be in imminent danger.
