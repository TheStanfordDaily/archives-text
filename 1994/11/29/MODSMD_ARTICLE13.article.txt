ASSU should add a cap
to special-fee funding
to put limit on expense

IN THE WAKE of last year's
special-fee fiascos — the Gradu
ate Student Tea Party revolt,
the failed Fair-Funding Amend
ment and the large number of
unapproved special fees — the
ASSU set out to fix the broken sys
tem that distributes student
money to student groups.
A committee commissioned by
ASSU Senate Chair Nawwar Kas
rawi at the beginning of the year has
recommended that fee refunds be
eliminated and that funding be split
between undergraduate and gradu
ate students. Therefore, under the
new proposed amendment, a group
that receives support from a majori
ty of undergraduates who vote and a
minority of graduate students who
vote would receive its entire special
fee from undergraduates.
The proposed system addresses
several problems with the current
special-fee system. It will rid student
groups of some of the uncertainty
surrounding how much money they
will receive. It will encourage stu
dents to vote since they will not be
able to refund their fee. And it will
significantly reduce the amount of
money graduate students are paying
to student groups, the majority of
which serve undergraduate inter
ests.
However, the proposed amend
ment completely ignores other
issues and creates more potential
problems. Taking into account past
student voting patterns, undergrad
uates will overwhelmingly vote
against the proposal. Similar
amendments have been voted on
before and all have failed. The rea
son is simple: undergraduates sim
ply don't want to pay a lot for stu
dent groups. Under the new system,
undergraduate fees could run a 6
high as $70 or $80 a quarter, none of
which would be refundable.

The number of student groups
requesting special fees has rapidly
increased over recent years. There is
a higher demand for student money,
but students are a lot less willing to
increase the supply of funds. Under
the new system, students would vote
against student groups in large
numbers not because they don't
support the groups, but rather to
avoid ridiculously high fees. This
would restore uncertainty to the fee
process and would work unfairly
against student groups.
A possible solution would be to
add a cap to the special fee. The cap
should be higher than previous fees
since undergraduates will likely be
funding more groups, but should be
a reasonable amount nonetheless
(say $45). With the cap, students at
the polls would be able to comfort
ably approve groups' fee requests
without having to worry about stick
ing themselves with an $80 unre
fundable tab.
The cap would translate into a
maximum amount of money avail
able to student groups. Therefore if
undergraduates approved $350,000
of special fees (with half of a group's
fee applying to undergraduates for
groups approved by both grads and
undergrads) and there was a maxi
mum of $288,000 available (6,400
undergrads x $45), each group
would receive 82.3 percent
($288,000/$350,000) of its under
graduate funds. However, if
$240,000 of fees were approved by
undergraduates, student groups
would receive all of their undergrad
uate funds. This same scenario
would apply to graduate students.
The addition of a cap would ease
student fears of high fees. In addi
tion, it would in most cases grant
approved groups the vast majority of
their requested fees. In conjunction
with the proposed system, graduates
would no longer be funding under
graduate groups and approved
groups would not have to worry
about large numbers of refunds. The
ASSU Senate should add an amend
ment to the bill proposing the new
system and place the issue before
the students.
