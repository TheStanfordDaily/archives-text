## My deposit at the Cryobank 
### 
Medical students are always
looking for ways to make some
cash. It should have been no sur
prise, therefore, when a friend of mine pro
posed a trip to the California Cryobank.
Skimming through The Daily classified
ads, he was intrigued by the plea for
"healthy men" to donate sperm, with
potential earnings of $120 per week. My
friend asked me if I had a "moral problem"
with such an act, and I quickly responded
that I couldn't think of one. One afternoon
between classes, we decided to drop by the
bank's Welch Road address.
I was the first to arrive and thought I
had mistakenly entered a dentist's office.
There was a standard selection of main
stream magazines and a pleasant, conser
vatively-dressed receptionist to greet me. I
was expecting some sort of high-tech secu
rity system to ward off vagabonds or
protesters, but the atmosphere was dis
tinctly casual. Almost too casual, I remem
ber thinking.
I was quickly given a questionnaire to
fill out, at which point the normality of the
experience dissolved. Required informa
tion included my racial background, up to
and including that of my grandparents;
family health history, including use of
tobacco, alcohol or other drugs; and educa
tional history. That, combined with ques
tions about my own physical characteris
tics, sexual history and religious prefer
ences, was sufficient for me to question
what I was doing.

Waiting for a vacancy in one of the
donation rooms, I asked the reception
ist a little about the program. Only 10
percent of potential donors actually
matriculate. Eor a variety of reasons,
including inadequate sperm count or
sperm mobility, the vast majority of
applicants go home empty-handed. Of
those whose sperm are deemed "wor
thy," distinguishing information is
compiled in a catalogue for clients to
peruse. Having learned this much, I
didn't feel the program was inherently
wrong, just weird.
It only got stranger. My friend had
arrived, but since a donation room had just
been emptied, we had no opportunity to
chat (I had to be at an exam in 15 minutes).
As it turned out, there was no crunch for
time; "adult" magazines and films were
provided to expedite the process. Within 5
minutes, I left the depository and headed
around the corner to the lab, where techni
cians in white coats cordially received my
cup. Leaving as uneventfully as I had
come, I was given a card and told to call in
two days for results.
In those 48 hours, I thought more about
what I had done. Do I have a problem with
making money off my sperm? I could com
fortably say that I didn't. Would it bother
me to see "a little kid that looked just like
me" running down the street? Not really, I
thought, knowing that the ethics of the
issue run much deeper.
The critical question here seems to be

the following: "Is specific sperm selection
desirable for our society?" Comical at first,
it's a serious issue, and the frustrating
answer Ls "maybe." Presently, this pro
gram allows infertile couples to have chil
dren and helps to eliminate genetic disease
as an ancillary benefit. Because there is
still tremendous variability and unpre
dictability in the genetic makeup of donor
sperm and client egg, the beauty of individ
ual diversity is preserved. Another positive
point is the sperm bank's potential for pop
ulation control; men may deposit their own
sperm in advance of a vasectomy, allowing
for future fertilization while eliminating
unwanted pregnancies.
Taken to an extreme, however, this busi
ness is potentially very frightening. Our
knowledge of genetics is expanding expo
nentially. What if we learn to select more
precisely for genetic makeup, creating a
homogeneous group of super-babies? Fur
thermore, only the wealthy have access to
these programs at this point. Will there be
financial assistance to those who can't
afford to purchase sperm themselves, or will
the program simply increase social dispari
ties?
I'm reserving judgment on the cry
obank until these questions are resolved.
As for my sperm, the issue is moot. "They
didn't freeze well," I was told.

Chris Carlsten's sperm will be vacationing
in the Bahamas over winter break.
