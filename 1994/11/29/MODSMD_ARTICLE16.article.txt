Students for a Traditional Sexual Ethic address virtue

YESTERDAY'S ARTICLE TITLED
"You said 'sex'?" referred to four
lectures given in October by Pro
fessor Raymond Dennehy, Mortimer
Fleishhacker Chair of Philosophy at the
University of San Francisco. The lec
tures dealt with contemporary topics
related to virtue, and were sponsored in
part by Students for a Traditional Sexu
al Ethic. We felt that a short synopsis of
Dr. Dennehy's talks could be very bene
ficial in helping to explain some of the
goals and ideas of our new student
group.
In his first talk, "Moral Virtue in a
Pluralistic Society," Dr. Dennehy talked
about how moral virtue presupposes a
notion of the Good for human beings.
Aristotle noticed that while many people
are content with the appearance of
wealth, stature or fame, no one is con
tent with the mere appearance of the
Good. People want the real thing.
However, different people have differ
ent conceptions of the Good; so how does
this notion of moral virtue square with
pluralism, since good and bad necessari
ly imply a notion of right and wrong?
The answer for the United States, Dr.
Dennehy said, lies in the ideas of our
founding fathers: pluralism was highly
regarded within a framework of a few
fundamental truths about the human
being. The Constitution states, "We hold
these truths to be self-evident: that man

is created equal and has a right to the
pursuit of life, liberty and happiness."
Clearly, then, our founders believed in
pluralism, but within a framework of
virtue. Thus, stealing from others,
killing the innocent, adultery and other
such actions were considered harmful
and not a "right" since they detract
from the common good.
In his second talk, "Chastity: The
Much Misunderstood Virtue of Sexual
Behavior," Dr. Dennehy explained that
chastity is much more than mere absti
nence. It is a positive choice for the
Good, which is temperance in this case.
Since this decision flows out of an inner
disposition of a desire for good, it is a
decision made with joy and peace. In
other words, one not only rejects lustful
thoughts and actions — before or during
marriage — but one is happy doing so,
because they flow from the state of one's
character. But why must sex be delayed
until marriage? His premise was that
sex is more than just a physical act; it is
a statement of unconditional love. All
surviving cultures have fostered the
public ceremony of union between a
man and a woman, although they may
differ on how such unions are contract
ed. Thus, if sex is a statement of uncon
ditional, absolute love, then it is only
proper that a public statement of this
love accompany it. Chastity is thus part
of the virtue of temperance; doing the

right thing in the proper way at the
proper time in the appropriate amount.
Dr. Dennehy's third talk explored
natural law and virtue. Natural law is
based on the idea that there are a few
laws of human nature that are evident
in all peoples. Its classical rival is cultur
al relativism, which holds that there are
no unchanging norms of conduct. Dr.
Dennehy related after the talk that in
faculty interviews he often asks prospec
tive philosophy professors if feeding chil
dren to alligators for pleasure is abso
lutely wrong. A typical answer, accord
ing to Dr. Dennehy, is, "Well, I would be
absolutely opposed to it, but I don't
know if I could say it is absolutely
wrong." Dr. Dennehy went on to explain
that although natural law is grounded in
objective knowledge, it requires disci
pline on the part of the individual to
accept and live according to that knowl
edge.
For this reason, in his fourth talk Dr.
Dennehy argued that personal immorali
ty compromises the person, distorts
one's perception of reality and leads to
irrational consequences. For example,
the unvirtuous behavior of adultery
would compromise the person who com
mitted it because he or she now lives in
fear of being found out, possibly leading
to more compromised behavior in order
to cover up the original act and save
one's reputation. One's perception of

reality is distorted because of a disor
dered desire; for example, an alcoholic
often rationalizes his unsatiable need to
drink as reasonable, coming up with var
ious excuses for himself and thus dis
torting reality. Hence, the private moral
ity of our politicians are important, since
they bring with them a set of values that
would inherently color their legislative
decisions.
The overall goal of the newly formed
Students for a Traditional Sexual Ethic
is a positive one: to promote charitable
discourse on issues regarding sexuality.
By engaging each other in discussion in
a way that is respectful and tolerant of
all people — especially with people who
do not agree with us — we hope to foster
an atmosphere of understanding and to
allow students to discuss differing view
points in a mature manner, i.e. without
resorting to name-calling or shouting
matches. The issue of sex and sexuality
has been left to the media for too long,
and we feel that it is time that we, as a
people, took a good look at what it really
means to us and to our future genera
tions.

YESTERDAY'S ARTICLE TITLED
"You said 'sex'?" referred to four
lectures given in October by Pro
fessor Raymond Dennehy, Mortimer
Fleishhacker Chair of Philosophy at the
University of San Francisco. The lec
tures dealt with contemporary topics
related to virtue, and were sponsored in
part by Students for a Traditional Sexu
al Ethic. We felt that a short synopsis of
Dr. Dennehy's talks could be very bene
ficial in helping to explain some of the
goals and ideas of our new student
group.
In his first talk, "Moral Virtue in a
Pluralistic Society," Dr. Dennehy talked
about how moral virtue presupposes a
notion of the Good for human beings.
Aristotle noticed that while many people
are content with the appearance of
wealth, stature or fame, no one is con
tent with the mere appearance of the
Good. People want the real thing.
However, different people have differ
ent conceptions of the Good; so how does
this notion of moral virtue square with
pluralism, since good and bad necessari
ly imply a notion of right and wrong?
The answer for the United States, Dr.
Dennehy said, lies in the ideas of our
founding fathers: pluralism was highly
regarded within a framework of a few
fundamental truths about the human
being. The Constitution states, "We hold
these truths to be self-evident: that man

is created equal and has a right to the
pursuit of life, liberty and happiness."
Clearly, then, our founders believed in
pluralism, but within a framework of
virtue. Thus, stealing from others,
killing the innocent, adultery and other
such actions were considered harmful
and not a "right" since they detract
from the common good.
In his second talk, "Chastity: The
Much Misunderstood Virtue of Sexual
Behavior," Dr. Dennehy explained that
chastity is much more than mere absti
nence. It is a positive choice for the
Good, which is temperance in this case.
Since this decision flows out of an inner
disposition of a desire for good, it is a
decision made with joy and peace. In
other words, one not only rejects lustful
thoughts and actions — before or during
marriage — but one is happy doing so,
because they flow from the state of one's
character. But why must sex be delayed
until marriage? His premise was that
sex is more than just a physical act; it is
a statement of unconditional love. All
surviving cultures have fostered the
public ceremony of union between a
man and a woman, although they may
differ on how such unions are contract
ed. Thus, if sex is a statement of uncon
ditional, absolute love, then it is only
proper that a public statement of this
love accompany it. Chastity is thus part
of the virtue of temperance; doing the

right thing in the proper way at the
proper time in the appropriate amount.
Dr. Dennehy's third talk explored
natural law and virtue. Natural law is
based on the idea that there are a few
laws of human nature that are evident
in all peoples. Its classical rival is cultur
al relativism, which holds that there are
no unchanging norms of conduct. Dr.
Dennehy related after the talk that in
faculty interviews he often asks prospec
tive philosophy professors if feeding chil
dren to alligators for pleasure is abso
lutely wrong. A typical answer, accord
ing to Dr. Dennehy, is, "Well, I would be
absolutely opposed to it, but I don't
know if I could say it is absolutely
wrong." Dr. Dennehy went on to explain
that although natural law is grounded in
objective knowledge, it requires disci
pline on the part of the individual to
accept and live according to that knowl
edge.
For this reason, in his fourth talk Dr.
Dennehy argued that personal immorali
ty compromises the person, distorts
one's perception of reality and leads to
irrational consequences. For example,
the unvirtuous behavior of adultery
would compromise the person who com
mitted it because he or she now lives in
fear of being found out, possibly leading
to more compromised behavior in order
to cover up the original act and save
one's reputation. One's perception of

reality is distorted because of a disor
dered desire; for example, an alcoholic
often rationalizes his unsatiable need to
drink as reasonable, coming up with var
ious excuses for himself and thus dis
torting reality. Hence, the private moral
ity of our politicians are important, since
they bring with them a set of values that
would inherently color their legislative
decisions.
The overall goal of the newly formed
Students for a Traditional Sexual Ethic
is a positive one: to promote charitable
discourse on issues regarding sexuality.
By engaging each other in discussion in
a way that is respectful and tolerant of
all people — especially with people who
do not agree with us — we hope to foster
an atmosphere of understanding and to
allow students to discuss differing view
points in a mature manner, i.e. without
resorting to name-calling or shouting
matches. The issue of sex and sexuality
has been left to the media for too long,
and we feel that it is time that we, as a
people, took a good look at what it really
means to us and to our future genera
tions.
