# Prof studies effects of pesticides on young workers in grape fields
## 
### Pippa Loengard 
Prof. Jim Leckie knows the
life of California's farmers very
well.
As a child, he spent his sum
mers harvesting the crops of
farms throughout the Santa
Clara Valley. Often farmers
would spray pesticides on the
fields the night before he
worked. Sometimes they would
spray as the workers picked the
berries.

Today, as director of the en
vironmental engineering and
science program, Leckie is
working on a project he hopes
will show how even the
youngest children of farm
workers are affected by these
pesticides.
He and six students in the
department have started re
searching how the children in
teract with pesticides and ab
sorb them through their skin. He
said his goal is to educate lawmak
ers about the damaging toxins.
"Until the damaging effects of
the chemicals are exposed," he said,
"policy won't change."
Berause some produce pesti
cides have been linked to cancer
and other diseases in California's
farm workers, the issue has
spurred a campus-wide debate over
whether grapes belong on Stan
ford's dining tables.
Some students argue that farm
workers are the ones who suffer
when pesticides are sprayed to pro
tect fruit. They say the laborers
have no alternative but to farm in
the unsafe fields, risking high lev
els of exposure to toxic chemicals.
In order to find out more about
the effects of these chemicals, Leck
ie's team of researchers is heading
to the fields of California's Salinas
Valley to follow the lives of some of
the state's poorest children.
Leckie said he hopes to record
every contact that children aged 18
months to 4 years have with the
toxins over a period of several years.
By doing this, he said he wants to
track the exposure of those who
don't work in the fields but still
have contact with pesticides.
Leckie added that he chose to
follow the children of workers on
strawberry farms because their
parents work year round and 80
percent of the pesticides used are
for cosmetic reasons, to ward off
insect damage to the fruit.
Servando Molina, one of the stu
dents on the research team, is all
too familiar with the fight against
insects at the expense of the farm
workers.
Like Ijeckie, Molina grew up on
the farms. His mother still works in
the packing factories of the Gilette
Citrus Company in Dinuba, Calif,
in the San Joaquin Valley.
"I'm from a farming communi
ty," he said. "About 70 percent of
the people work in the fields and
packing houses."
"I live between the cities of
McFarland and Fowler. There were
a lot of cancer cases there attribut
ed to pesticides.. .1 know kids who
were born with one arm."
The group plans to follow chil
dren around their homes, their
schools and the fields with video
cameras. Last summer, the team
visited the valley twice to deter
mine the best ways to film the chil
dren with the least interruption to

their daily routine. The researchers
hope to get started on the bulk of
their research next summer.
Currently, though, the project is
progressing slowly as the
researchers search for funds. Seed
money for the initial research was
provided by the Chicano Research
Center, the Dean of Research and
the Stainford Center for Risk Anal
ysis, but it is not enough to carry
the team through the multiyear
project.
The group has applied to the
Environmental Protection Agency
and other foundations for support.
Once the study is funded, it will
begin researching one of today's
most controversial and scientifical
ly complex issues.
Most farmers use an average of
20 different pesticides on every
crop they produce. Leckie said
these chemicals interact with each
other but scientists still do not
understand their effects on
humans.
He said, however, that the same
reaction that kills the bugs also
interferes with a human's bio
chemistry.
Leckie's study will be the first to
use videotape to document the chil
drens' lives and attempt to calcu
late their skin's exposure to the
chemicals.
He acknowledged that no mat
ter what his study finds, it is
unlikely farmers will stop using
pesticides altogether.
"Pesticides are necessary for the
level of productivity that people feel
mandated to produce," he said. He
added there are other ways to con
trol insects such as crop rotation
and the introduction of natural
predators, but "people are ignorant
and not willing to try something
new."
When considering the current
campus dispute over whether
grapes should be served in Stanford
dining halls, Leckie sits back in his
chair and chuckles. After reflecting
for a moment, he says he sympa
thizes with the desire to protest the
chemicals' use.
Stanford could solve the debate
between whether to buy sprayed
grapes or forego the fruit altogeth
er by switching to organic grapes,
Leckie said, adding that this would
undermine farmers who used pesti
cides and promote smaller, organic
farms.
But for many of the students
protesting the use of pesticides,
Leckie says it is not an economic or
political issue but one of family.
"It's a personal issue," he said.
"Many of these students have fam
ily members in the fields."
