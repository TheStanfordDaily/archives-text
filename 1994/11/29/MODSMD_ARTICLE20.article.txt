## Women's swimming charges ahead Three-time defending NCAA champs will be tough to beat 
### Ezra Baylin 
The threetime defending
NCAA champion Cardinal
women's swimming and diving
team charges into the 1994-95
season as the squad to beat,
returning 14 All-Americans from
last year's championship effort.
Ranked first in the College Swim
ming Coaches Association's pre
season poll, and returning 19-
time All-American Jenny Thomp
son, the Cardinal eagerly looks to
another NCAA title.
However, head coach Richard
Quick is not concerned with
national titles or rankings.
"My goal is not to have a string
of championships, but to have
each team and person within that
team perform to their full poten
tial," he said. "If that doesn't hap
pen, and we win a national cham
pionship title, then we have not
reached our goal."
Quick, who holds four NCAA
titles, six Pacific 10 Conference
crowns and a perfect 43-0 dual
meet record in his previous six
years on the Farm, also admits
that "a pre-season number-one
ranking can be the kiss of death in
a lot of ways."
However, Quick believes the
team will overcome pressure.
"The attitude has been exception
al, and the commitment to an
excellent level of performance is
as good as I have ever seen it,"he
said. "The leadership from the
seniors has been inspiring."
Senior captains Becky Crowe
and Kendra Thayer, two of only
six seniors on the squad this year,
provide the leadership and direc
tion that Quick feels will drive
Stanford to another successful
season.
"On a personal level, we recog
nize what we need to do as a team,
but this year is going to be the
toughest it has ever been, and we
are stepping it up for NCAAs,"
Crowe said.
Thayer agreed, stating the
need to keep things in perspec
tive. "We have what it takes to
win a fourth national title, but we
cannot take anything for grant
ed," Thayer said.
Other key seniors on the Car

dinal roster include Thompson
and Eileen Richetelli. Thompson,
winner of two gold medals and a
silver at the 1992 Olympics in
Barcelona and current American
record holder in the 100-meter
freestyle, is expected to place in
the top three nationally in the
sprint free events this season.
Thompson wants to see per
sonal and team achievement.
"ll'd like to 1 win all my events at
NCAAs and bring home a
fourpeat for Stanford," she said.
Quick describes Richetelli, the
Cardinal's top diver, as "an awe
some athlete. The bigger the
meet, the tougher she gets."
Though she sat out last season
due to a back injury, Richetelli
won the three meter and platform

competitions at the NCAA cham
pionships in 1992 and 1993.
"My main goal is to focus on
winning NCAAs, because interna
tional competition is a long-term
target," said Richetelli. If she can
stay healthy, the Cardinal should
have one of the top diving squads
in the country.
New freshmen and transfer
talent will also strengthen the
Cardinal. Sophomore Claudia
Franco, a transfer from the Uni
versity of Florida, is a six-time
All-American, a member of the
1992 Spanish Olympic team and
the Spanish National record hold
er in the 100 free.
"Claudia will make an immedi
ate and tremendous impact on
our team," said Quick.

The Cardinal also expect a lot
from their top sprint free
recruits, Becky Bicknell and Lind
say Gassner. Bicknell, a freshman
from Denver, Colo., was a finalist
in the 50 and 100 free at junior
nationals last April in Seattle.
The sprint free attack is complete
with the addition of Gassner, who
placed 22nd at the 1992 U.S.
Olympic trials in the 50 free.
Stanford's new recruits should
giv° the Cardinal the most potent
sprint free team in the country,
but freshmen Amy Oberhelman
and Michelle Collins bring fresh
talent in the butterfly events.
Collins is the U.S. Olympic festi
val champion in the 100 fly, and

Senior captain Becky Crowe powers to the finish in a race last year, and will strive for similar success
this season.
