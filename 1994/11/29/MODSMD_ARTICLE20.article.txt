## Women's swimming charges ahead Three-time defending NCAA champs will be tough to beat 
### Ezra Baylin 
The threetime defending
NCAA champion Cardinal
women's swimming and diving
team charges into the 1994-95
season as the squad to beat,
returning 14 All-Americans from
last year's championship effort.
Ranked first in the College Swim
ming Coaches Association's pre
season poll, and returning 19-
time All-American Jenny Thomp
son, the Cardinal eagerly looks to
another NCAA title.
However, head coach Richard
Quick is not concerned with
national titles or rankings.
"My goal is not to have a string
of championships, but to have
each team and person within that
team perform to their full poten
tial," he said. "If that doesn't hap
pen, and we win a national cham
pionship title, then we have not
reached our goal."
Quick, who holds four NCAA
titles, six Pacific 10 Conference
crowns and a perfect 43-0 dual
meet record in his previous six
years on the Farm, also admits
that "a pre-season number-one
ranking can be the kiss of death in
a lot of ways."
However, Quick believes the
team will overcome pressure.
"The attitude has been exception
al, and the commitment to an
excellent level of performance is
as good as I have ever seen it,"he
said. "The leadership from the
seniors has been inspiring."
Senior captains Becky Crowe
and Kendra Thayer, two of only
six seniors on the squad this year,
provide the leadership and direc
tion that Quick feels will drive
Stanford to another successful
season.
"On a personal level, we recog
nize what we need to do as a team,
but this year is going to be the
toughest it has ever been, and we
are stepping it up for NCAAs,"
Crowe said.
Thayer agreed, stating the
need to keep things in perspec
tive. "We have what it takes to
win a fourth national title, but we
cannot take anything for grant
ed," Thayer said.
Other key seniors on the Car

dinal roster include Thompson
and Eileen Richetelli. Thompson,
winner of two gold medals and a
silver at the 1992 Olympics in
Barcelona and current American
record holder in the 100-meter
freestyle, is expected to place in
the top three nationally in the
sprint free events this season.
Thompson wants to see per
sonal and team achievement.
"ll'd like to 1 win all my events at
NCAAs and bring home a
fourpeat for Stanford," she said.
Quick describes Richetelli, the
Cardinal's top diver, as "an awe
some athlete. The bigger the
meet, the tougher she gets."
Though she sat out last season
due to a back injury, Richetelli
won the three meter and platform

competitions at the NCAA cham
pionships in 1992 and 1993.
"My main goal is to focus on
winning NCAAs, because interna
tional competition is a long-term
target," said Richetelli. If she can
stay healthy, the Cardinal should
have one of the top diving squads
in the country.
New freshmen and transfer
talent will also strengthen the
Cardinal. Sophomore Claudia
Franco, a transfer from the Uni
versity of Florida, is a six-time
All-American, a member of the
1992 Spanish Olympic team and
the Spanish National record hold
er in the 100 free.
"Claudia will make an immedi
ate and tremendous impact on
our team," said Quick.

The Cardinal also expect a lot
from their top sprint free
recruits, Becky Bicknell and Lind
say Gassner. Bicknell, a freshman
from Denver, Colo., was a finalist
in the 50 and 100 free at junior
nationals last April in Seattle.
The sprint free attack is complete
with the addition of Gassner, who
placed 22nd at the 1992 U.S.
Olympic trials in the 50 free.
Stanford's new recruits should
giv° the Cardinal the most potent
sprint free team in the country,
but freshmen Amy Oberhelman
and Michelle Collins bring fresh
talent in the butterfly events.
Collins is the U.S. Olympic festi
val champion in the 100 fly, and

Senior captain Becky Crowe powers to the finish in a race last year, and will strive for similar success
this season.
Oberhelman is a 13-time high
school Ail-American.
These additions will strengthen
the already potent butterfly squad.
Thompson garnered the NCAA
title last year in the 100 fly and
Crowe took second in the 200 yard
fly. Sophomore Sarah Anderson
also posted surprisingly fast times
at the World Championships in
Rome, and she should help the Car
dinal in the 100 and 200 fly.
The only possible weak spot in
Stanford's lineup is the breast
stroke, according to Quick. Howev
er, Thayer, senior Mary Ellen Blan
chard and junior Allison Higson
have the potential to provide a
potent attack for the Cardinal.
Blanchard is the current U.S.
record holder in the 100 breast and
Thayer is a seven time All-Ameri
can, but all of this success came two
years ago, when the two were
sophomores. Higson, the former
world record holder in the 200
meter breast, also did not con
tribute last season because of a
nagging back injury. If the Cardi
nal can regain even part of its for
mer success in the breast stroke,
Stanford could post some surpris
ingly strong finishes at the NCAA
championships this year.
Though Stanford is the favorite
to win the NCAA and Pac-10 titles,
Quick warns that there may be a
changing of the guard in women's
swimming. Traditionally, the Uni
versity of Texas at Austin and the
University of Florida have been
Stanford's main rivals, but the
team to beat this year is USC.
The Trojans have put together a
strong squad that will give Stan
ford competition for the Pac-10
title — a crown that the Cardinal
has won since the conference was
formed eight years ago.
However, Stanford's biggest
challenge comes from abroad this
year. "The primary goal of this pro
gram is to prepare for internation
al competition; NCAAs tend to take
care of themselves," Quick said.
Stanford's swimmers not only

have to worry about other schools
— they have to deal with the cur
rent controversy wracking the
international swimming world. In
particular, the worldwide percep
tion that the Chinese National
team is using drugs or steroids to
enhance their performance puts an
interesting twist on competition.
Many Stanford swimmers who
work toward the World Champi
onships and the Olympics, as well
as the NCAA championships, felt
the implications of the allegations
this summer at the World Champi
onships. Chinese swimmers
crushed many of the current world
records, and swept most of the
events.
"There is no doubt that the Chi
nese are cheating," said Quick, the
1992 U.S. Olympic Coach. "They'll
sacrifice one, two or even 10 ath
letes for Olympic glory. Their histo

ry of human rights violations is
horrible and it permeates in sport
as well."
Yesterday, the situation came to
a head when eight Chinese swim
mers were caught at the Asian
Games. The international govern
ing body for swimming caught the
Chinese in a surprise inspection,
and the Chinese will lose eight key
athletes from their program. In
addition, it is uncertain whether
the records from the World Cham
pionships in Rome will stand.
"It is fantastic that this is hap
pening, but the only reason we
caught them was because it was a
complete surprise," Quick said.
"This is an important step because
it gives the International Olympic
Committee more grounds to do
surprise testing."
These test results will take some
pressure off the Stanford team

because the current situation
makes it difficult for Stanford
swimmers to compete on equal
ground internationally, and it has
the potential to disrupt their train
ing. Quick told his team that they
could either accept this new chal
lenge or shy away from it.
"Jenny Thompson, in particu
lar, has decided to accept the chal
lenge and her attitude is on a high
er level than it has ever been,"
Quick said.
Thompson added, "The Chinese
situation makes us more deter
mined. They are certainly beat
able."
Quick trusts that his team has
accepted the challenge, and the
leadership provided by the seniors
has taken the training and prepara
tion to a height that will allow them
to perform to their fullest poten
tial.
