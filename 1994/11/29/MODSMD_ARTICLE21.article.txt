# Walsh departure leaves team with mixed emotions
## 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
In a season full of controversy
and hard times, the biggest blow
to the Stanford football program
fell yesterday as Bill Walsh
announced his resignation as
head coach.
Informed of Walsh's decision
to resign during a team meeting
an hour before his press confer
ence yesterday, the Stanford foot
ball players were supportive of the
change but not all for the same
reasons.
Most players cited his resigna
tion as unfortunate to the pro
gram overall and yet remained
respectful of Walsh's decision.
However, some said it might be a
good step in getting the program
back on track.
"I think everybody feels very
fortunate to have been able to
work with Coach [Walsh]," senior
quarterback Steve Stenstrom
said. "I'm excited that he's still
going to be involved in Stanford
and still be a part of the program.
I think it will really benefit Stan
ford altogether, and it sounds like
he'll be happy."
Walsh leaves behind a pro
gram with two distinctive parts —
those players recruited by former
head coach Denny Green and
those recruited by Walsh. Recent
ly, some divisions have emerged
from those two camps.
While most players are hesi
tant to comment on such a divi
sion, senior nose tackle John
Hebert identified a key problem
over the past three years.
"We had a great team and then
[Walsh] did some things his own
way, and it really messed things
up, as our record indicates,"
Hebert said, referring to the 7-14-
1 record the team assembled over
the past two years. "He took a
great program and ran it into the

ground. I'm ready to turn it
around and get things back to
Denny Green."
Senior wide receiver Justin
Armour ackowledged the tension,
but took a different stance on the
issue. "I'm in immediate defense
of Walsh," said Armour. "I'm
sure it's frustrating to him, and
it's sad that his ending has been
surrounded by so much crap. We
didn't lose because of Walsh, or
any coach for that matter — it
always comes down to the play
ers."
Stenstrom and freshman run
ning back Anthony Bookman said
they were not aware of such divi
sions.
"We've been able to stay unit
ed through all the hard times,"
Stenstrom said. "The fact that
we've lost some really close games
is tough on a football team. You
get some things that surface
because of that tough season, but
we had great continuity on this
team that had really kept us
together for the whole year."
Bookman commented that
while some unrest may exist,
there are larger aspects of concern
for the team.
"I haven't experienced it, but I
did hear that it was present —
more last year than this," Book
man said. "I hope that won't be
the situation witii us. It would be
unfortunate with the talent we
have. We have much bigger goals
to work for."
Armour voiced similar senti
ments, backing Walsh's decision
while commenting on future
prospects. "The program can take
off from here.. .but it's going to
have to come from guys recom
mitting themselves to the game."
Turning largely to this
year's freshmen and sopho
mores for playing time, Walsh
has openly criticized Green's
final recruiting classes as sub
par. Over half of the total starts
on defense were made by Walsh
recruits, implying Walsh's
increased confidence in the
younger players.
Senior nose tackle Jason
Fisk, a key player on both
Walsh's and Green's teams,
respected Walsh's decision and

said it would be hard to tell
what the effect will be on the
team.
"Some new life can be
breathed into the program," he
said. "Change is sometimes
good. He's positive about the
decision and we should be too."
David Carder, a senior defen
sive end who started all 11
games in 1993 but only one this
year, said that most of the play
ers respected his decision but
now the team may be "able to
get a new focus with a new
coach."
