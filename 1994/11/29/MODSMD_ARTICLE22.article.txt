# Bullies and braves
## We don't need another hero 
### 
The boy held a baseball in one hand and a pen in the
other, and eagerly leaned over the railing at Oakland
Coliseum to catch a glimpse of his sports hero Jose
Canseco.
"Can-thako," he called out. "Ho-thay Can-thako."
Canseco, standing just beneath the kid by the dugout,
didn't move a muscle or even make eye contact. He kept
his gaze on the field.
"Can-thako. Ho-thay Can-thako. Pleath, Mr. Can
thako. Pleath."
Finally Canseco responded to the innocent pleas — by
ducking under his cap and walking back into the dugout.
"What an idiot," Canseco said, chuckling at the kid with
a speech impediment. "The kid can't even talk."
Told by Jeff Savage, a former sports writer in San
Diego for the Union-Tribune, this story grabbed my
attention several days ago as I read about Savage's
behind-the-scenes experiences with the athletes he

wrote about. I don't know if the story is
true (and we all know we shouldn't
believe everything we read), but it defi
nitely casts at least a partial shadow on
Canseco and the entire world of sports
figures. Perhaps you already knew that
Canseco is not the most charitable
human ever to don an A's uniform. Still,
you say, the man is a god with the bat
and ball. There's no denying that. Yet it
absolutely resounds with irony that the

man young boys look up to is a bully.
Athletic prowess aside, Canseco and others of his
unkind nature should not be idolized. But kids — and
adults too — often don't know the difference between
what are athletic attributes and what are not. Admira-

tion for a home run-hitter quickly spreads to encompass
the whole person, not just the musdes that hit the ball.
He's more than someone who can hit the ball, throw the
touchdown, shoot the trey. He's someone I want to
shake hands with, take pictures of, and shell out too
much money to watch play.
I'm guilty of reckless sports hero worshipping. If
someone told me that Tony Gwynn made fun of children
with speech impediments, I'd defend him to my dying
day. If I found out that Joe Montana sold crack, Kevin
Johnson bought crack, or Martina Navratilova smoked
crack, I'd never believe it.
Yet these things happen. My hero Steve Garvey had
an affair. My hero Magic Johnson has AIDS. And my
hero Alan Wiggins died of a drug overdose.
They're human, is the general response when some
thing like that happens, and sometimes it's a shocking
realization. The life beyond the field or court doesn't

always mimic the charmed life led on
it, and it hurts us to find out. Slowly
we understand that the face on the
television screen and the newspapers
is only the tip of the iceberg. There's
so much we can't see; there's so much
we probably shouldn't see.
The truth is, Charles
Barkley was wrong when he said he's
not a role model. He can't simply
absolve himself of that responsibility

because it's not that easy. He and the
countless other talented sports geniuses who we idolize
unremittingly are role models whether they like it or

not, and they should accept that
and live accordingly. After all,
fame has its costs and privi
leges. A cost is being on stage
all the time. Money, power and
getting away with treating
young fans disrespectfully
might be considered privileges.
As a sports fan, I have the
equally challenging responsibil
ity to recognize athletic talent
for what it is. I need to allow my
sports heroes to lose, make mis
takes, and live a life apart from
Sports Channel. I'll look up to
the way Michael Jordan can
shoot, and not the way he han
dles his personal life. I'll admire
John McEnroe's backhand, but
not his temper. I'll appreciate
the athleticism of my sports

heroes without judging the
whole person.
Reading about Canseco
shook me up, angered me, and
degenerated the respect I held
for him. I guess it wasn't as sur
prising as it was disappointing
to find that he""s not the role
model he could be for kids.
Maybe he hates the spotlight —
I don't know.
What I do know is that there
are two sides to every story and
at least two million ways in
which to judge a person. In the
world of sports, few care about
what Canseco does off the field.
But in the real world — the
world where home runs don't
spell life or death — we should
care.

Although Allyson's real world
has become the sports world,
she'll try to maintain perspec
tive.
