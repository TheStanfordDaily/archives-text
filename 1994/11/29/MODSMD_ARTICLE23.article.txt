# Cardinal sails at Goodwill Regatta

While many of us enjoyed
turkey dinners, two members of
the Stanford sailing team were
practicing a little diplomacy.
Junior Adam Lowry and
freshman Mara Holian repre
sented Stanford this weekend in
the sixth annual United States-
Japan Goodwill Regatta held in
Newport Beach, Calif.
The U.S. dominated the
regatta, capturing the top 10
places. Lowry and Holian, one of
only three West Coast tandems,
finished seventh out of 33
teams, despite some unfortunate
circumstances. Windy condi
tions on Saturday appeared to
give an advantage to the Cardi
nal team. However, in the first
race that afternoon, the boom of
their boat split in two, forcing

them to withdraw.
In the third race, the pair was
leading the field when the jib
halyard (front sail wire)
snapped. Since it could not fin
ish, the team was forced to take
the average of their scores for
each of the two races. Neverthe
less, the team remained upbeat
regarding their performance.
"The score may not have
reflected that we sailed a pretty
good regatta," Lowry said. "But
I would say that the way we

sailed was fairly encouraging."
"We were competing against
some of the best teams in the
country," Holian said. "I
thought we did really well. I
have only been sailing a couple
of months, so it was a good expe
rience and I learned a lot."
Ryan Cox and Erica Museler
of the Naval Academy finished
first. Standout sailors from UC-
Irvine, California, Tufts and
Charleston were also among the
U.S. entrants.
The event alternates sites
between Japan and the U.S. and
represents the best sailors from
each of the two countries. Spon
sored by the Nikken Rentacom
Corporation of Japan, the regat
ta gives sailors the opportunity
to share certain aspects of their
respective cultures in the midst
of healthy competition.
Former All-American Scott
Sellers, who coached Stanford's
squad this weekend and has
also participated in this event
as a sailor, found that the week
end definitely served its pur
pose.
"It was a very worthwhile
experience, interacting with the
Japanese and sharing our cul

ture," Sellers said. "All the
social activities were made to
get the U.S. and Japanese
teams interacting, and this
♦heme was present throughout
the regatta." Sailors from each
country came away with a sense
of respect and appreciation of
their foreign competitors.
"One thing I learned about
the Japanese is that they
always give 100 percent and sail
with all their hearts," Holian
said. "They were also so nice
and gracious, and truly made
an effort to talk with us, despite
the language barrier."
