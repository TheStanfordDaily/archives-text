# Wrestlers pin 23rd at top invite
## Jackson, Vaniman place among country's best 
### Ratha Harntha Contributing writer 
Not everyone in Las Vegas this weekend was
on vacation. In fact, 30 of the nation's top colle
giate wrestling programs were competing in the
Las Vegas Invitational last Friday and Saturday,
where the Stanford wrestling team placed 23rd.
"Our conditioning and technique isn't where it
needs to be to be competitive in a tournament
like this," said head coach Chris Horpel. "We did
like I expected. No one was really ready to place
in the top three."
Only two Cardinal athletes, senior 134-
pounder Jay Jackson and sophomore 190-
pounder Bryan Vaniman, placed in the invita
tional. Both finished ninth in their respective
weight classes by winning two of their matches.
No other Cardinal won the required two matches
to place in the invitational.
"Some of our guys had good tournaments,"
said junior Matt Cano. "Some of us didn't have
our best days."
Cano lost one of the tougher matches in the
tournament to the eventual second place finisher
in the 126-pound class. Leading by two points
late in the match, Cano allowed his opponent to

take him down and take the contest into sudden
death overtime, where Cano eventually lost.
"I mentally made a mistake at the end of the
match," Cano said. "I let him take me down. I
didn't wrestle very well this weekend."
"[The tournament] was a valuable experience,"
Horpel said. "Our weaknesses were exposed."
The seven Cardinal wrestlers who participated
not only gained match experience but also had
the opportunity to watch some of the best
wrestlers in the country, according to Horpel. In
its dual meet against UC-Davis on Nov. 18, some
of the weaknesses in the Cardinal's technique did
not show up.
"It takes a good wrestler to show you what you
don't know," Horpel added.
Last year, the Cardinal placed higher, with
two wrestlers, Jackson and junior 134-pounder
Jimmy Aguirre, finishing sixth and seventh,
respectively. This year, injuries kept Aguirre,
junior 150-pounder Tod Surmon and junior 167-
pounder Sahlan Martin out of the invitational.
Surmon and Aguirre are ranked second and
third, respectively, in their weight classes in the
Pacific 10 Conference. This year, Stanford only
took a partial team of seven wrestlers to the invi
tational.
