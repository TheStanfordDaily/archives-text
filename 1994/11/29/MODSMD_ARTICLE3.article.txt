# Walsh resigns as football coach
## Will fill new post in Athletic Dept. 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Citing a general exhaustion re
sulting from coaching, Bill Walsh
announced his resignation as
Stanford head football coach yes
terday. He will stay at Stanford to
assume a newly created position of
Assistant to the Athletic Director
for Special Projects.
Assuming the head coaching
position in January 1992, Walsh
assembled a record of 17-17-1 over
the past three years. Along with
his two-year stint on the Farm as
head coach in 1977-1978, his five
year record stands at 34-24-1.
The Athletic Department will
now begin a national search, ac
cording to Athletic Director Ted
Leland.
"This was an appropriate time
to move on to another phase of my
life," said Walsh, who will turn 63
on Wednesday. "I thoroughly en
joyed my three years at Stanford.
It's been a lot of fun and a mar
velous experience, and I expect it
to continue. Being part of a schol
ar-athlete environment is ideally
suited to me and for what I need at
this point in my life."
Walsh's new position will main
ly deal with fund raising, accord
ing to Leland. The Athletic De
partment is currently involved in
Campaign 2000, a fundraising ef
fort aimed at raising $60 million
by December 1995. According to
Leland, $10 million remains to be
raised.
"He will be a fund raiser for us,"
Leland said. "Bill will play an inte
gral role in helping us raise the

rest of those funds."
Walsh will also help initiate
coaching development programs
involving both Stanford coaches
and those outside the University
that are similar to the minority
coaching school he ran last
spring. Leland also cited a new
program — which is just entering
the planning stages — called the
Stanford Sports Institute, which
would focus on the research and
training of athletics and sports
medicine.

"It's just a dream right now,
we're just getting it on paper," Le
land said. "To make it a reality, we
think Bill is uniquely qualified to
play a role in doing that."
The search for a new head
coach will begin immediately, ac
cording to Leland. He said the Ath
letic Department is committed to a
national search to keep the "na

tional prominence" of Stanford's
football program.
"We will have a university-wide
Screening and evaluation of the
various candidates, but in the end
I'll make a recommendation to the
provost and the president of the
University," Leland said.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said
there will be no formal search
committee set up and no timetable
as to when a new coach will be

named, but the University feels
that it should be done "as soon
as possible."
According to Walsh, the
change was a natural progres
sion in his time at Stanford.
Since returning as head coach in
1992, he said he and Leland
have considered what positions
he could move into after coach
ing.
"Ted and I had discussed this
with others prior to my assum
ing this position — how long I
would be here, what the time
schedule might be," Walsh said.
"As the season passed, we had
some discussions, but I'd say in
the last four to five weeks this
has been a consideration."
Walsh said that this year's 3-
7-1 record was disappointing,
but was not the main factor in
his choice to move on. "I had
hoped to do better this year, any
coach would," he said. "But I
learned in my experience to live
with those things. I'll tell you
this, I never worked harder in
my life than my time here."
If the team had gone to a
bowl game this year, Walsh said
he would still have resigned but
would have waited until after
the season had ended to
announce his decision. The
main concern now for the pro
gram, according to Walsh, is to
concentrate on recruiting as the
program has "around 25" schol
arships available (according to
Leland) and recruiting visits
start in early December.
As far as Walsh's new duties,
he was vatrue about specifics

and what role he will have in the
football program in particular.
"It's important to me now to
associate with the athletes and
continue to act as counsel and
be a real assistance to the new
coach as he is named, and par
ticipate to the extent that the
new coach would desire my ser
vices," he said.
"I mentioned in my assuming
this position that this would be
my bliss and it is, but to be hon
est with you, more to that
extent now than before. Now I
can effectively interact with fac
ulty and students themselves
without the trappings and for
mality of the head coaching
position."
Addressing the issue of who
would be considered in the
coaching search, Leland noted
that he expects offensive coordi
nator Terry Shea to be on the
list but they will still look
around the country for a succes
sor.
"We're committed to finding
the best coach we can find, no
matter what size, shape or color
that comes in," Leland said.
Despite the disappointing
last two seasons, Walsh's influ
ence on the program is clearly
evident. Two nationally ranked
recruiting classes, a preseason
top-25 ranking this year and
heightened television exposure
have increased the national
standing of the program.
Leland also noted that the
Athletic Department received
$26 million in cash donations
over the last 12 months and
"that couldn't have been done
without Bill's help," he said.
Also, national television income
has doubled since the year
before Walsh became head
coach.
