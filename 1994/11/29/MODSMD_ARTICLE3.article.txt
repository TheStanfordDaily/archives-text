# Walsh resigns as football coach
## Will fill new post in Athletic Dept. 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Citing a general exhaustion re
sulting from coaching, Bill Walsh
announced his resignation as
Stanford head football coach yes
terday. He will stay at Stanford to
assume a newly created position of
Assistant to the Athletic Director
for Special Projects.
Assuming the head coaching
position in January 1992, Walsh
assembled a record of 17-17-1 over
the past three years. Along with
his two-year stint on the Farm as
head coach in 1977-1978, his five
year record stands at 34-24-1.
The Athletic Department will
now begin a national search, ac
cording to Athletic Director Ted
Leland.
"This was an appropriate time
to move on to another phase of my
life," said Walsh, who will turn 63
on Wednesday. "I thoroughly en
joyed my three years at Stanford.
It's been a lot of fun and a mar
velous experience, and I expect it
to continue. Being part of a schol
ar-athlete environment is ideally
suited to me and for what I need at
this point in my life."
Walsh's new position will main
ly deal with fund raising, accord
ing to Leland. The Athletic De
partment is currently involved in
Campaign 2000, a fundraising ef
fort aimed at raising $60 million
by December 1995. According to
Leland, $10 million remains to be
raised.
"He will be a fund raiser for us,"
Leland said. "Bill will play an inte
gral role in helping us raise the

rest of those funds."
Walsh will also help initiate
coaching development programs
involving both Stanford coaches
and those outside the University
that are similar to the minority
coaching school he ran last
spring. Leland also cited a new
program — which is just entering
the planning stages — called the
Stanford Sports Institute, which
would focus on the research and
training of athletics and sports
medicine.

"It's just a dream right now,
we're just getting it on paper," Le
land said. "To make it a reality, we
think Bill is uniquely qualified to
play a role in doing that."
The search for a new head
coach will begin immediately, ac
cording to Leland. He said the Ath
letic Department is committed to a
national search to keep the "na

tional prominence" of Stanford's
football program.
"We will have a university-wide
Screening and evaluation of the
various candidates, but in the end
I'll make a recommendation to the
provost and the president of the
University," Leland said.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said
there will be no formal search
committee set up and no timetable
as to when a new coach will be
