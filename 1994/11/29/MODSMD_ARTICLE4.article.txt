# Campus Mormons seek higher education
## Students find creative alternatives to alcohol, sex, other temptations of college

Editor's Note: This is the second in a series of
three articles discussing the experiences of Stan
ford students with conservative religious beliefs.

For freshman r ryler Croft, the restrictions
placed on him by his Mormon religion aren't re
ally restrictions at all. Croft makes the analogy of
a kite and its string. If one were to cut a kite's
string, the kite would fall to the ground. Though
the string looks as if it keeps the kite down, in re
ality, it holds the kite up.
This is how Croft chooses to look at his reli
gion, which may seem quite strict to others.
"I don't look at it as being restricting. The
scriptures are holding me up," he said."l feel bet
ter about myself knowing that I can live by high
er standards."

Such guidelines — which include avoiding al
cohol, dating outside the faith and pre-marital
sex — can be big temptations on any college cam
pus, but are an integral part of life as a member
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
Saints (LDS) or Mormon religion.
Sophomore Emma Petty said she considers
Mormonism a major part of her life. She said she
has trouble understanding the attraction of
drinking to so many students here on campus.
"I'm bummed that so much of campus life is
centered around drinking," she said. "I don't un
derstand why there is so much drinking among
so many intelligent people.
"I went to two parties and got enough beer
spilled on me that I realized it wasn't good for
me."
