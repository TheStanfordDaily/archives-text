# Campus Mormons seek higher education
## Students find creative alternatives to alcohol, sex, other temptations of college

Editor's Note: This is the second in a series of
three articles discussing the experiences of Stan
ford students with conservative religious beliefs.

For freshman r ryler Croft, the restrictions
placed on him by his Mormon religion aren't re
ally restrictions at all. Croft makes the analogy of
a kite and its string. If one were to cut a kite's
string, the kite would fall to the ground. Though
the string looks as if it keeps the kite down, in re
ality, it holds the kite up.
This is how Croft chooses to look at his reli
gion, which may seem quite strict to others.
"I don't look at it as being restricting. The
scriptures are holding me up," he said."l feel bet
ter about myself knowing that I can live by high
er standards."

Such guidelines — which include avoiding al
cohol, dating outside the faith and pre-marital
sex — can be big temptations on any college cam
pus, but are an integral part of life as a member
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
Saints (LDS) or Mormon religion.
Sophomore Emma Petty said she considers
Mormonism a major part of her life. She said she
has trouble understanding the attraction of
drinking to so many students here on campus.
"I'm bummed that so much of campus life is
centered around drinking," she said. "I don't un
derstand why there is so much drinking among
so many intelligent people.
"I went to two parties and got enough beer
spilled on me that I realized it wasn't good for
me."

church choir.
Petty prefers to find alternative
social activities. "I hang out with
friends, go to the Stanford theater
to see old movies, even bake brown
ies."
The 100 to 150 LDS students on
campus are a close-knit group who
choose to spend a lot of time
together.
Since dating is not allowed until
the age of 16, serious dating gener
ally begins in college. Mormons are
encouraged to date and marry
members of their religion.
"The overall reason for dating is
to find someone to marry,"
explained Croft. "In fact my par
ents dated since the eighth grade."
There are some married LDS
couples at Stanford. Seniors Jolie
and Mark Griffin were married last
August and are presently living off
campus. Jolie Griffin knows of
three other undergraduate Mor
mon married couples.
Sex is not permitted under the
Mormon religion until marriage.

Consequently, the amount of safe
sex promotion on campus causes
some concern for several Mormons.
Although Jolie Griffin thinks
that safe sex is important for the
control of diseases, she is con
cerned about the repercussions of
such widespread promotion on
campus.
"There is too much of an
emphasis on safe sex," she said. "It
puts an emphasis on sex and seems
to leave no option for not having
sex at all."
With the presence of condom
machines in bathrooms and adver
tisements for free contraceptives at
the Cowell Student Health Center,
Petty is concerned about the mes
sage that is being sent to students.
"I wonder if the fact that it is so
out in the open makes sex seem
more acceptable," she said.
Croft agreed, saying that absti
nence is often ignored as an option.
"I have to chuckle when I see
the promotion of safe sex around
campus," he said. "I've got the
safest form of sex there is. I'm
never going to have to worry about
STDs, teenage pregnancy, ruined
relationships or date rape."

Though LDS students as a
whole feel Stanford is accepting of
their beliefs, some of the campus's
liberal tendencies seem foreign to
some members of the religion.
For example, some Mormons
question the recent public accep
tances of homosexuality by some
campus ministry leaders.
There is no doctrine in the Mor
mon religion which speaks directly
about homosexuality, but the prac
tice is not approved of by most
members of the religion, said
sophomore Jamie Stewart.
"In our religion, we believe that
man and woman were made to
complement each other," she said.
"It is a divine privilege to create
kids."
Croft added that although Mor
monism disagrees with the homo
sexual lifestyle, it does not con
demn homosexuals.
"It is quite clear through the
scriptures that homosexuality was
not part of God's plan," Croft com
mented. "We love the sinner, but
hate the sin."
Though their beliefs may not
always match those of the campus
mainstream, these beliefs are not

hard for the Mormon students to
maintain. The LDS programs
offered at Stanford help reinforce
these values.
The students belong to a group
called Latter Day Saints Students
of America and participate in a pro
gram called "Institute" which
meets for classes every Tuesday
and Friday. This year's focus of
study is on the doctrines of the
gospel and the prophets of the
church, Griffin said.
There are three wards (LDS
churches) in the Stanford area.
Undergraduate students attend
the first ward, married students
attend the second ward and older
single students attend the third
ward.
In the end, despite what may
appear to be a restricting lifestyle
to outsiders, many of the Mormon
students share the belief that Stan
ford has strengthened their reli
gious values.
"My beliefs have evolved since I
have been here," Petty said. "Many
people here are both intellectual
and spiritual; it has helped me face
the many decisions that I have had
to make while being here."
