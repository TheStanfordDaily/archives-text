### Megan Himan Staff writer 
For the first time at Stanford, representa
tives of about 20 campus women's groups
met last night to discuss their work and com
mon goals. The meeting centered on how to
increase publicity and funding, and focused
on the development of closer ties between the
groups.
Felicia Lee, half-time coordinator of the
Women's Center, organized the meeting to
bring together campus women's groups and
form a network to continue communica
tions.
"I think a lot of us are working toward the
same goals," Lee said. "We need to talk about
the ways in which we can support one anoth
er and the way that we can work best togeth
gf.
Publicity was mentioned repeatedly as the
largest area in which women's groups could
use help. Brooke Ackerly, coordinator of the
Graduate Women's Network, discussed the
problems of reaching women on campus.
"My frustration is that it is very hard to
reach all of the people that we want to reach,"
Ackerly said. "I have found it impossible to
find one way to spread information," she
said, adding that "e-mail helps."
Lee discussed the implementation of an e

mail distribution list to connect the various
women's groups on campus. "We need to be
utilizing each other as resources," Lee said.
"E-mail lists are a perfect avenue to recruit
support."
Lack of funding was the second issue of
concern voiced by many women's group or
ganizers at the meeting. Several women dis
cussed the impact of their groups' losses of
ASSU special fees in last year's election.
Lee proposed ASSU special-fee reform as
a possible issue around which women's
groups could organize. "The Women's Cen
ter could take a stand on this issue," Lee said,
adding that it could be something for which
groups could form a coalition.
Coordination of women's activities was a
goal expressed by many at the meeting. "It
seems ridiculous that we don't do more work
together," said one woman.
Lee said she thought the meeting was a
good forum for groups to learn about each
other. "It's helpful to realize that each of these
groups are going through the same issues of
publicity and funding," Lee said. "We are
looking for continued communication among
women's group this year and in the future."
Co-sponsorship of campus events was dis
cussed by many women as an avenue to pur
sue in the future. A woman on the Women's
