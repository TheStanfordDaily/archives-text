George Takei's success story begins
long before Star IVek fame. Born in
Los Angeles, he and his
family together with
more than 120,000
other Japanese
Americans were placed in American internment camps
at the outbreak of World War 11. This actor, writer, and
businessman offers fascinating insight into his early
years as an actor, his first meeting with a vision
ary named Gene Roddenberry, and a behind
the-scenes look at what really happened on
the Starship Enterprise, lb the Stars is a
compelling look at both the Star TVek phe
nomenon and one man's triumph over adversity.
This event will be held at the Bookstore on campus.
