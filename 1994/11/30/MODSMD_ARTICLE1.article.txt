# Special delivery
## Potential frosh bikes application to Admissions 
### Anne Dubinsky 
As the December deadline
nears, high school seniors
across the country are looking
for that extra edge that will
push their application to the top
of the pile in the Stanford Un
dergraduate Admissions office.
One tactic students have
used in the past is personal hand
delivery of their applications.
But no one has ever made the
trip Adam Burns did last week.
Burns, of Pacific Palisades
High School, hiked 425 miles up
the hilly California coast —
stopping only to eat, sleep, and
write the main essay for his
Stanford Undergraduate Appli
cation — to make the delivery.
Burns left Los Angeles on
Nov. 22, and yesterday put his
application into the hands of
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions James Montoya, thus
ending his week- long journey
on California Highways 1 and
9.
During the trip, Burns wrote
his main essay, reflecting dur
ing his eight hour days and
adding and revising each night.
The topic: "Attach a photo and
talk about it." The picture is of
Burns and his bike, preparing to
embark on the trek, in front of
his high school. He said that one
of the hardest things was neatly
handwriting the final draft for
Montoya.
He was accompanied by his
father, who biked the first three
days of the journey with him,

and his mother and baby brother in
a support vehicle bearing changes
of clothes, food, an extra bike and
the all-important essay.
Although his family joined
Burns to provide encouragement
and emergency help, he ended up
rescuing them twice. While biking
with Burns, his father injured his
knee. Burns had to ride ahead to
meet his mother so that she would
double back to pick him up.
A few days later, just south of
Monterey, the support vehicle
itself broke down. Burns had to
ride and call AAA to come rescue
the stranded car. The family then
rented a car in Monterey for the
rest of the journey.
Burns called the trip "tiring,
cold, and wet." The worst part, he
said, was near Monterey, where
the rain came down in sheets and

there was no shoulder on the road.
When biking away from the coast,
the trip seemed lonely.
Once, however, when Burns
started up Highway 1, hugging
the Pacific Coast, it was "picture
perfect." Yesterday morning when
he came over the top of the last
mountain and could see Stanford
in the distance, he realized that
the trip had indeed been worth it.
The family stopped at the top for a
picnic.
Yesterday Burns met with
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions James Montoya for a pre
arranged appointment to person
ally deliver the application.
His immediate concern? "I'm
afraid that I might fall asleep on
his desk," a nervous and weapr
Burns admitted, who was still
wearing a biking jersey and tights,
and carrying his helmet.
"My main goal," Burns said, "is
to show that I'm committed, that
this is where I want to go. I'm just
taking it to an extreme." Stanford

is his first choice; he is unsure
about any other college options
but knows he wants to stay in Cal
ifornia.
But while impressive, the trip
does not guarantee Burns a place
in the class of 1999, according to
Montoya.
Though the admissions office
wants "to show Stanford as the
kind of place where achievements
are recognized," Montoya said, it
is "not as concerned with the actu
al ride as with his reflections upon
it that created the essay."
Even if he doesn't get an accep
tance letter in the spring, Burns
said he will still be glad he made
the trip. Called crazy by friends,
parents and teachers, he looked at
the trip as an opportunity to get
away from school pressures for a
week.
His high-school friend, Stan
ford freshman Mary Colvig, said
she "didn't think he was the kind
of person to do something like
this," but that she supports him

all the way.
Some of his high school teach
ers, though, are not letting him
make up tests missed due to his
absence. Burns hasn't let this
intimidate him. He planned to
drive back to Los Angeles yester
day if the car (still in Monterey
being fixed) is ready, or to take the
bus if necessary.
Burns is the president of Pal
isades Outreach, a community
service club at Palisades High
School which organizes such
activities as a Halloween party for
homeless people. He asked mem
bers of his high school to give a
penny for each mile of his trip; the
money will go to support Pal
isades Outreach activities.
Burns said he has been bicy
cling "since [he] learned to walk"
and has been doing long-distance
cycling since he was about 9 years
old. He trained for about a month
before the trip, focusing on long
weekend rides and sprints on the
beach.
