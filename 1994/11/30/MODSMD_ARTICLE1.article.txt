# Special delivery
## Potential frosh bikes application to Admissions 
### Anne Dubinsky 
As the December deadline
nears, high school seniors
across the country are looking
for that extra edge that will
push their application to the top
of the pile in the Stanford Un
dergraduate Admissions office.
One tactic students have
used in the past is personal hand
delivery of their applications.
But no one has ever made the
trip Adam Burns did last week.
Burns, of Pacific Palisades
High School, hiked 425 miles up
the hilly California coast —
stopping only to eat, sleep, and
write the main essay for his
Stanford Undergraduate Appli
cation — to make the delivery.
Burns left Los Angeles on
Nov. 22, and yesterday put his
application into the hands of
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions James Montoya, thus
ending his week- long journey
on California Highways 1 and
9.
During the trip, Burns wrote
his main essay, reflecting dur
ing his eight hour days and
adding and revising each night.
The topic: "Attach a photo and
talk about it." The picture is of
Burns and his bike, preparing to
embark on the trek, in front of
his high school. He said that one
of the hardest things was neatly
handwriting the final draft for
Montoya.
He was accompanied by his
father, who biked the first three
days of the journey with him,
