Court skeptical on term limits
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme
Court, gingerly handling a political hot
potato, seemed equally skeptical yesterday
of arguments for and against state efforts
to limit the time anyone serves in
Congress.
"It's very close," Justice Antonin Scalia
said in discussing his view of the constitu
tionality of House and Senate term limits,
imposed in various forms since 1990 by 22
states.
None of Scalia's eight colleagues con
tradicted his assessment.
The court will take its initial, private
vote in an Arkansas term-limits case Fri
day and announce its decision by late
June.
No matter how the court may rule,

Republicans in Congress plan to vote next
year on a constitutional amendment to
limit congressional terms.
Mediators propose peace plan
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)
— Mediators began a diplomatic blitz yes
terday in hopes of persuading the Bosnian
government to accept a peace plan that
could include a federation between
Bosnia's Serbs and Yugoslavia.
While fighting around the U.N. pro
tected town of Bihac picked up yesterday,
U.S., Russian, British, French and Ger
man mediators from the so-called contact
group met with government leaders in
hopes of salvaging a negotiated end to the
war, not an outright military victory for
Serbs.
