# House passes rewrite of GATT
## In need of 60 votes, measure now heads to less-supportive Senate 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House,
brushing off critics who protested the
legitimacy of a vote by a lame-duck
Congress, passed a sweeping world trade
agreement yesterday. President Clinton
hailed it as a "historic vote for American
workers, farmers and families."
The House voted 288-146 for the
rewrite of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, sending the measure
to the Senate, where supporters were
still searching for the votes needed for
passage.
The four hours of debate were
brought to a close by House Speaker
Thomas Foley, who in his final speech in
the chamber where he had served for 30
years urged his colleagues to pass the
measure.
"It is impossible to imagine a single

act of this Congress that can do more to
contribute to our economic growth," said
Foley, who was defeated in the Novem
ber elections in a Republican sweep that
gave control of both the House and the
Senate to the GOP for the first time in 40
years.
The GATT accord would cut tariffs by
38 percent worldwide, expand the rules
of world trade to new areas such as agri
culture and services and create a new,
more powerful World Trade Organiza
tion to referee disputes.
The administration estimated that
the reduced tariffs equate to a $744 bil
lion global tax cut over a decade. For
Americans, it would represent a $70 bil
lion cut in border taxes on imported
goods and services over 10 years.
Foley and other supporters argued

that a defeat of the trade agreement
would be disastrous for America's stand
ing in the world. But opponents pleaded
with equal fervor that the 124-nation
GATT accord was too complex to be set
tled "on the 11th hour" by many law
makers who had been voted out of office.
The 142-vote margin of passage repre
sented a victory for President Clinton,
who had worked the telephones through
out the day talking to undecided law
makers.
It was the first post-election test of
whether the White House and Republi
cans who will control Capitol Hill come
January could work together.
Clinton said the House vote "demon
strates to the American people that
Democrats and Republicans can work
together in the national interest."
