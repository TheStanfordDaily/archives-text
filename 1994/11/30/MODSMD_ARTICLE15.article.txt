## Course Guide redux 
### 
TO MOST FRESHMEN, the
"Courses, Degrees and
Information" guide is an
intimidating way to select courses.
Rather than leafing haphazardly
through its 846 pages, they often
rely on the insight and guidance of
upperclassmen to help narrow
their decisions. Those living in all
freshman dorms often turn
instead to AAs and faculty advisors.
But some students may require
more information than these
sources can supply. Advisors can
only provide limited information
about courses and how students
feel about them.
One solution to this dilemma
would be to bring back the ASSU
Course Guide. The guide, which
until 1992 was produced as an
ASSU business project, was based
on comments students wrote on
course evaluation forms. The
ASSU would publish and sell a
compilation of the comments.
Such a service is bound to be

both appreciated and supported by
the student body. Most students
would be more than willing to pur
chase a copy of the guide to help
ease course decisions.
With a committed staff, the
Course Guide could potentially be
as successful as ASSU Lecture
Notes. Through questions on the
course evaluation forms, the staff
could survey a good cross-section of
the class and acquire the truth
about courses from those who
know them best. The project could
be funded through an
entrepreneurial grant of the sort
that recently spawned the Disc-
Connection compact-disc exchange.
A new, high-quality version of
the ASSU Course Guide would
undoubtedly generate profits.
When students are paying over
$27,000 a year for their education,
they will certainly be willing to part
with an extra $5 to make sure that
they are receiving the best educa
tion they can.
