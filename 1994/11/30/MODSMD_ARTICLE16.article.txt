Everyone knows that
Stanford houses some of the
world's top scholars. But
many undergraduates may not
realize that Stanford's brilliance
extends beyond the Quad. The
Hoover Institution, the Graduate
School of Business, the School of
Medicine, the Law School and
Stanford's various centers and
institutes house minds whose expe
rience and expertise matches and
sometimes exceeds that found in
Stanford's undergraduate schools.
But although they live and work at
Stanford, the titans of Stanford's
professional schools and institu
tions are virtually unseen in under
graduate classrooms.
Without a doubt, some of these
people have absolutely no interest
in teaching undergraduates. Oth
ers, like Law Prof. Lawrence Fried
man and Business School and
Political Science Prof. David Brady,
already teach undergraduate class

es to wide acclaim.
Between these two extremes lie
hundreds of people who may never
even have considered teaching
undergraduates. With a little
encouragement, some of them
could undoubtedly be convinced to
try their hand at undergraduate
teaching by offering a small semi
nar or serving as a guest lecturer in
one or two classes. At the very
least, both the newly recruited
teachers and their students would
find the experience unique. Some
might find the experience reward
ing — and worth repeating.
A public statement from some
one like University President Ger
hard Casper or personal lobbying
by students, administrators and
professors would probably be
enough to convince many of these
scholars to give undergraduate
teaching a try. With the potential
rewards as great as they are, the
effort would be well worth it.
