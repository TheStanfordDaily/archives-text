Student group 's stand on sex relies on sloppy reasoning

I AM WRITING in regard to the arti
cle and letter concerning the new
group Students for a Traditional Sex
ual Ethic. I respect the group's position,
their willingness to voice their opinions
and particularly their apparent eager
ness to discuss these matters with those
who disagree. However, I have several
problems with what I have read.
First, I am concerned with the philo
sophical sloppiness of the arguments
made in Raymond Dennehy's lectures,
as those lectures were presented in
Melissa Cheok and Vincent Mooney's
letter. Since Dennehy is the chair of phi
losophy at the University of San Fran
cisco, and to avoid boring everyone with
philosophical detail, I will give Dennehy
the benefit of the doubt, assume that he

has a coherent position and attribute the
sloppiness to probable confusion on the
part of Cheok and Mooney.
Still, I wonder if the group agrees with
Dr. Dennehy's rejection of "lustful
thoughts and actions — before or during
marriage." Lust is defined as longing,
desire, sexual appetite or craving. Inside
or outside of marriage, the absence of
lust translates to a formula for very bad
sex. Such lustless sex would indeed make
abstinence a more appealing alternative.
My next concern is the suggestion
that the "viewpoint that abstinence
before marriage is a very good and real
option" is somehow "underrepresented."
Please, give us a break. The religious
right talks about little else, and if there
is such a thing as an overrepresented

minority in this country, it's the reli
gious right. Doesn't it seem a bit redun
dant to be telling Stanford students not
to be having sex, anyway?
I am troubled by the intent to educate
others "purely out of concern for them
and their well-being." It would be nice if
fewer people seemed to be so sure about
knowing how everyone else should live.
Telling intelligent people who are obvi
ously aware of how abstinence works
that your assessment of the risks and
rewards of sex is better than theirs
strikes me as pious, arrogant and some
what ironic. If the members of the group
have practiced what they preached and
remained abstinent, then they are less
informed about the joys of premarital
sex than the people who they intend to

educate; perhaps this ignorance is what
leads them to advocate abstinence in the
first place.
Also, I wonder why the group ques
tions the "presupposition that sex out
side of marriagj is normal"; do they
then consider engaging in premarital sex
to be abnormal, and if so do they have
empirical facts to back up their asser
tion? Doesn't this position also jeopar
dize their goal "not to conflict with or
attack anyone as a person"?
To conclude, I would suggest that,
rather than demanding "If you cannot
handle marriage, how can you handle sex?"
the group should ask "If you cannot handle
sex, how can you handle marriage?"
