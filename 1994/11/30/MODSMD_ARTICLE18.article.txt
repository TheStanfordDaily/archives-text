# Article about proposed reforms to special-fee system was incorrect
## 
### 
I would like to take this opportunity
to correct an error that appeared in last
Wednesday's article on the ASSU Sen
ate's discussion of the amendment to
reform special fees.
In that article, the writer stated that
"five or six groups" would have been
affected by the provision that prohibits
political or religious groups from receiv
ing special fees. This is incorrect. No
groups would have been affected by this
policy. None of the groups that applied
for special fees last year would have
been considered "partisan political" or

"religious."
In fact, no group that has applied in
recent memory has fallen under that
classification. The "five or six groups"
which the article mentioned actually
referred to the number of groups that
would have been affected by the proposal
to raise the amount of general fees an
organization can receive.
I would like to further clarify this
provision, as there seems to be a great
deal of confusion surrounding it. The
policy states that organizations that are
primarily of a partisan political or reli
gious nature may not apply for special
fees. None of the organizations on last
year's ballot was primarily political or
religious in nature.
The second part of the provision
states that groups that receive special
fees may not use that money to fund

events that are political or religious in
nature. In practice, this provision will
have little or no effect on the way orga
nizations are funded. The provision is
merely a formal statement in the ASSU
Constitution of policies that are already
in practice.
