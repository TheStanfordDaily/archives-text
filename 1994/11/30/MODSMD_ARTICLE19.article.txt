# Student's death should not have been reported as a footnote to politics
## 
### 
I read about the murder of David Liu
with sadness. It appears that nobody is

safe anymore.
I felt that The Daily did not cover this
event properly. Why did the paper rele
gate it to such a minor place on the front
page? Why were, instead, three of the
four top stories on the front page about
the ASSU?
As a postdoctoral fellow working in
the Stanford community, I neither know
nor care about the ASSU. I am, howev
er, vitally concerned about the physical
well-being of myself and my co-workers.
The Daily should try to represent the
concerns of all members of the Stanford
community — not just those of a small
group of outspoken undergraduates. It is
sad to see the murder of a graduate stu
dent reported almost as a footnote to
undergraduate politics.
