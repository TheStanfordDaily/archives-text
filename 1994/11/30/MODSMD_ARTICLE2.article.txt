## Robert Brown dies 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Robert Minge Brown, a former
president of the Board of
Trustees, died Sunday of heart
failure while visiting family in
New Mexico.
Brown, who former University
President Donald Kennedy de
scribed as a "truly remarkable
trustee in every way," was 83.
"It's a terrible loss," Kennedy
said. "He was on the board and a
very active member of it when I
first became president of the Uni

versity."
Brown was born in Mobile,
Ala., and moved to San Francisco
at the age of 9. He was invited to
attend Stanford at the age of 13,
but "I refused because I had a cer
tain amount of common sense,"
he said in 1986.
Recruited by Stanford psy
chologist Lewis Terman from
that early age, Brown finally en
rolled at Stanford when he was
15.
He was active in school athlet
ics and politics, winning three let
ters in track and serving as class
president and student body presi
dent.
In 1931, Brown earned a bache

lor's degree with great distinction
in history, and on a Rhodes Schol
arship he graduated from Oxford
in 1934 with a bachelor of civil law
degree with highest honors.
He was named president of the
Board of Trustees in 1971 and
stepped down 10 years later at age
70. Brown also served for 10 years
as a trustee of Mills College in

Oakland.
Kennedy described Brown as
"the kind of man people always
knew they could go to for help with
questions they couldn't answer."
"He had simply marvelous
judgment," Kennedy said. "Faced
with difficult circumstances, he
could be kind and tough at the
same time."

Brown was also a lawyer at
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and
Enersen in San Francisco. He is
survived by two sons, four grand
children, and several nieces and
nephews.
A memorial service is scheduled
to take place Friday at 11:30 a.m.
at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in
Burlingame.
