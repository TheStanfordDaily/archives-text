In "Little Wing" we put the guitar
through the Leslie speaker of an organ,

A FEW WEEKS ago, Microsoft Cor
poration began running magazine
advertisements to promote a series
of interactive computer programs,
including such titles as Multimedia
Mozart and Cinemania. One of these ads
features a bearded, leather-clad biker
who growls through the copy with lines
like "If there's two things I knows, it's I
knows how to deck somebody and I
knows my Schubert." He claims he owes
his knowledge of "Schubertian style" to
his Microsoft Multimedia Schubert,
which teaches him "all about Schubert
while being accompanied by his loving
and ingratiating music."
There are many things wrong with both
the ad and the general premise of arty com
puter programs, but the most obvious
question here is why, in a document about
Schubert, is the music merely an accompa
niment? Rather than learning to evaluate
and appreciate Schubert's art through the
experience of listening to his sonatas, the
pitchman arms himself with glossaries of
musical terms and commentaries on Schu
bert's personality and style, with the spuri
ous goal of intellectual intimidation.
Microsoft's companion ad for Cinema
nia showcases a nine-year old boy uttering
such relative absurdities as "Federico
[Fellini]'s cautionary images of depravity
are no match for Cecil B. [De Millel's juicy

vision of Nero as a voluptuous connoisseur
of agonies." The boy's proud father rightly
questions his precocious announcements,
but instead of inquiring about Fellini'sfilm
he asks his son who taught him to talk like
that. The boy attributes it all to critic
Pauline Kael, who is "now residing in his
personal computer." At least Kael actually
watched the films she wrote about.
Today, this emphasis on the secondary
— on technicalities and criticism over the
spirit of the work itself — is sickening to
those of us who actually read the books
rather than the book reviews. Yet in the
world of computerized data banks, even
primary processes of suggestion and stim
uli become automated. Microsoft advertis
es a program for in-depth learning through
interaction, yet beyond the scope of fact
collecting one suspects few opportunities
to really experience the music.
Learning is a function of how people
examine and modify their own behavior.
Computer programs, however, demand no
creative or emotional reactions, only a
mechanical response — and usually the
computer will tell you how to do it. There is
no purely human behavior to consider, and
no real learning is achieved. Every interac
tion remains external, simply another dis
play to be consumed.
Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft,
is one man whose checkbook can feed an
insatiable hunger for such interaction.
One of his high-tech playmates is the Jimi
Hendrix Museum, which will present sim
ulated live-concert performances, multi

media voyages through Hendrix's life and
an "electric library" of HendrLx data.
Undeniably, the technology is awesome in
its sheer complexity and scale, but it fails
to consider to its full extent the essential
element of art; it must be shared among
us.
The experience of a Schubert sonata, a
Hendrix song or any other work of art is a
concentrated interaction between the
observed and the imagined, the artist and
the audience. Hendrix describes the song
"Little Wing" as the simple form of a girl,
or a "very small little matchbox" into
which he put all these things he'd seen and
then let "fly away," joined midair by an
audience that can reimagine and expand
that simple form.
That primary experience of art is mov
ing, visceral, an experience whose touch
cannot be programmed into a personal
computer. And so I fear the day when,
like the biker, all we know about Schu
bert or Fellini or Hendrix is what we got
from our Microsoft Multimedia, when
what touches us becomes limited to the
feel of our fingers on the computer key
board.

Elizabeth Kelly has nightmares about how
Bill Gates would sing "The Wind Cries
Mary."
