## DNA repair flaws linked to cancer Some colon and skin cancers caused by genetic mutations 
### Sara Bhargava Contributing writer 
Recent breakthroughs in DNA research have
exposed a link between mutations in specific
genes and certain types of cancer.
Gene repair mechanisms serve a crucial func
tion by correcting genetic mutations that occur
randomly or from environmental factors such as
ultraviolet (UV) light.
These mutations are significant, because they
could lead to abnormal gene expression and sub
sequently cause cancer. "Mutation will perturb
the expression of some genes. Derangement of
gene expression causes cancer," explained Dr.
Roger Kornberg at the School of Medicine.
Two major repair mechanisms that the cell
employs are mismatch repair and nucleotide exci
sion repair, or NER.
Mismatch repair involves recognition of the
error, nicking and removing the damaged DNA,
and then filling the subsequent gap with the cor
rect base pair sequences. The main function of
mismatch repair is to detect nucleotide sequence
changes which lead to improper base pairing.
The NER mechanism is relatively more com
plex and involves a greater number of proteins
than mismatch repair. NER recognizes distor
tions such as "something stuck to the DNA like a
piece of protein or a chemical carcinogen," said
Dr. Philip Hanawalt of the Stanford biology
department.
Since Hanawalt helped discover the NER pro
cess 30 years ago, researchers have found that
people who are deficient in repair mechanisms
are predisposed to cancer.
Mutations in genes for these repair processes
have been found to cause hereditary cancers like
hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC)
and xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), which is a
predisposition to skin cancer.
"The first step [in the transformation to a can
cer cell] puts damage in the DNA, damage that
interferes with replication and transcription.
When replication and transcription are blocked,
DNA is opened up and is accessible to recombina
tion events," Hanawalt said
Blocked transcription and replication also pre
vents the cell's chromosomes from separating
properly and can lead to gene amplification. "All
of these things have the effect of distorting the
expression of genes ... [both] the number of
genes expressed and the way in which they are
expressed," Hanawalt said.
HNPCC is caused by defective mismatch
repair. Mutations in these repair genes are wit
nessed in a condition called microsatellite insta
bility.
Each individual has a specific series of base
pairs which is repeated throughout their gene

code. This genetic sequence, called microsatellite
DNA, is identical throughout the individual's
genome. Finding varying microsatellite
sequences in one person's DNA indicates a repair
mechanism disorder.
HNPCC tumor cells contain these defective
microsatellite sequences and therefore have
mutated mismatch repair genes.
NER usually prevents disorders like XP. Cells
from XP patients can not repair genetic damage
inflicted by UV light or other external agents, and
therefore are susceptible to skin cancer.
It has been found by various research teams,
including one led by Kornberg, that certain NER
proteins essential for transcription by RNA poly
merase II are also essential for NER.
Transcription is the process by which
enzymes read the genetic code and then create
RNA by matching base pairs complementary to
those found in the DNA template. These RNA

transcripts are then translated into proteins.
According to Hanawalt, RNA polymerase II —
a major player in the transcription pathway —
acts like an 'antenna' to attract repair enzymes to
the damaged site and correct the error. The
mechanism for this action is not yet known; it is
possible that special coupling factors recognize
both the blocked RNA polymerase and the repair
enzymes and bring them together, he said.
If the repair genes themselves are damaged,
then the corresponding repair proteins do not
function properly, and transcription can not
effectively continue.
Much of the evidence for the link between
transcription and repair genes comes from the
observation that repair occurs in higher frequen
cies in coding areas of the DNA DNA which is
never transcribed is rarely repaired, signifying
that the repair mechanism may occur during
some part of transcription.
