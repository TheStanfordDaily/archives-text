Q:"Why do you get sleepy
after a big meal?"
— Stuffed like a turkey

A: There are several effects
that contribute to the
soporific power of a fine meal.
One of the primary causes is

that when all that food
hits the digestive sys
tem, the body needs to
send a lot of blood
down to help with the
digestive process.
The extra blood sup
plies oxygen and energy
to the cells that are pro
pelling the food
through your gut and
also absorbs the nutri
ents that are being
extracted from the
food. Since all that
blood is rushing to your
paunch, less blood

flows to the brain, and you start
to feel a little hazy or tired.
We all are aware of the volun
tary nervous system —this is
what is in action when you tell
your muscles to pick up a ball or
to walk. But what makes you
blush? What controls your heart
rate and digestive activity?
There's actually a two part
system, the autonomic nervous
system, that controls all of these
involuntary actions.
The sympathetic system con
trols all the activities associated
with arousal and activity. So if
you get scared or stressed, your
sympathetic nervous system pre
pares your body for action.
The parasympathetic system,
on the other hand, is associated
with mellow, vegetative behavior.
So when you're sitting in front of
the TV, rather than getting ready
to run for your life, your
parasympathetic system slows
your heart down, starts your
digestive system to work, and
does everything else that is phys

iologically associated with being a
couch potato.
So, after you've pigged out on
Thanksgiving, your parasympa
thetic system is going to kick in,
releasing digestive juices, turning
on the peristaltic muscles that
push the food along and relaxing
the sphincters that control pas
sage of food.
The parasympathetic system

does all the other physi
ologically calming
things. This provides
the body with some
much-needed 'down
time* to work on digest
ing the food.
There's another effect
specific to Thanksgiving
that helps make the
post-prandial daze even
more powerful that
directly relates to the
k area of the brain that
' induces sleep.
The current theory of
sleep claims that sleepi-

ness is the result of interaction
between two brain centers: one
that tries to keep you awake (the
ARAS), and one that tries to put
you to sleep (the Raphe center). If
the ARAS wins, you stay awake,
and if the Raphe center wins, you
fall asleep.
The messenger that the
Raphe center uses to send mes
sages is known as serotonin,
which is made by the body using
an amino acid called tryptophan.
(Tryptophan was actually used in
sleeping pills at one time). If you
eat a lot of tryptophan, you'll
have more serotonin, and you
help activate the Raphe center.
It turns out that turkey con
tains large amounts of trypto
phan, so if your Thanksgiving
feast featured such a bird, you
may have ended up even sleepier
than you would have after any
other big meal.
