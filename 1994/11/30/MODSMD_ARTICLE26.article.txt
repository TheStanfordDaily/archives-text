# Superconductor work wins award

Stanford professor Dr. Zhi-
Xun Shen received the Depart
ment of Energy's award for Out
standing Scientific Accomplish
ment in Solid State Physics in
early November.
Shen — assistant professor of
applied physics — and his col
leagues are researching the phys
ical properties of high-tempera
ture superconductors by isolating
electrons from the metal atoms.
The investigation of the elec
tronic structure, or the interac
tion between electrons and how
they move in the metal, of super
conductors is occurring at the
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory (SSRL).
William Spicer, professor
emeritus of electrical engineer
ing, Dr. Daniel Dessau, physicist
at SSRL, and Aharon Kapitulnik,
professor of applied physics, are
contributing to Shen's research
efforts.
The team is studying high
temperature superconductors to
determine how their electronic
structure differs from conven
tional superconductors.
Shen indicated that high-tem
perature superconductors have a
remarkably high critical temper
ature at which the compound
makes the transition to super
conductivity.
"Now the highest critical tem
perature ranges somewhere near
156K under pressure," Shen
said. He contrasted this to con
ventional superconductors that
have maximum critical tempera
tures below 30K.
Scientists in Holland discov
ered superconductivity in 1911; a
1957 paper later presented the
BCS theory which revolutionized
the field.
"That theory tried to under
stand superconductivity by a
kind of collective motion of both
the electrons and the atoms, or
lattice, in the material," Shen
explained. "It made a significant
improvement in our understand
ing of superconductivity," he
added.
After the formulation of the
BCS theory, the critical (transi
tion) temperature remained

extremely low, causing supercon
ductors to be inconvenient and
expensive.
"That's why when high-tem
perature superconductors were
discovered in 1986, it caught the
imagination of the [scientific]
community," Shen said.
High temperature supercon
ductors were discovered in a
group of oxide metals — transi
tion metal oxides — usually con
sidered to be poor conductors.
"Understanding conduction in
these oxides has been a long
standing problem since the for
mulation of quantum mechanics
... [it is] one of the fundamental
problems in physics," Shen said.
A model of conduction of elec
trons in metal, known as band
theory, offers a starting point for
discussing physics in solids. The
theory explains the behavior of
semiconductors, silicon, and gal
lium arsenide, but has problems
explaining the high-temperature
superconducting behavior of the
oxides.
To investigate electron behav
ior in the oxides, Shen used a
photon to displace, or 'kick out',
an electron from the transition
metal oxide. The ejection is a sud
den event, so the electron still
carries information about its
behavior inside the atomic frame
work.
Analyzing the electron pro

vides information about electron
interaction and the charged par
ticles' tendencies to move differ
ently from electrons in conven
tional superconductors.
Removing an electron from
the atomic lattice also provides
crucial information about elec
tron pairing. "A superconductor,
even a high-temperature super
conductor ... is the consequence
of electrons forming a pair called
a Cooper pair," Shen said.
In a conventional supercon
ductor, a Cooper pair consists of
two electrons spinning and mov
ing in opposite directions. Cooper
pairs are the key to the BCS the
ory. However, according to Shen,
"there's a consensus that Cooper
pairs are also involved in the
high-temperature superconduc
tors, but the mechanism of their
(the electrons') pairing is still
unclear."
Making the transition from
superconductivity to normal
state requires breaking the Coop
er pair. The maximum energy
necessary to take one of the elec
tron partners out of the pair is
called the energy gap.
In high-temperature super
conductors, the Cooper pairs
overall have a larger maximum
energy gap that is highly angular
dependent. In contrast, most con


Andrew Martinez-Fonts — Dail
ventional superconductors have
Cooper pairs with very weakly
angular dependent energy gaps.
Energy required to break the
Cooper pair can be determined by
measuring the energy of the photon
that displaces one of the electron
partners. "Since I can do that (mea
sure the displacement energy) as a
function of angle, that's a unique
capability," Shen said. His discovery
of angular dependence in high-tem

perature superconductor energy
gaps offers a more comprehensive
understanding of these materials.
Shen notes possible future uses
for high-temperature superconduc
tors in magnetic resonance imaging
and telecommunications. These
ideas are not yet reality, and Shen
cautions that applications like these
are still in the future.
"For me," Shen explains, "it's
the intellectual problem of under
standing the wide range of prob
lems [of superconductivity] . . .
transition metal oxides have chal
lenged our understanding of nature
for 50 years."

156K under pressure," Shen
said. He contrasted this to con
ventional superconductors that
have maximum critical tempera
tures below 30K.
Scientists in Holland discov
ered superconductivity in 1911; a
1957 paper later presented the
BCS theory which revolutionized
the field.
"That theory tried to under
stand superconductivity by a
kind of collective motion of both
the electrons and the atoms, or
lattice, in the material," Shen
explained. "It made a significant
improvement in our understand
ing of superconductivity," he
added.
After the formulation of the
BCS theory, the critical (transi
tion) temperature remained

extremely low, causing supercon
ductors to be inconvenient and
expensive.
"That's why when high-tem
perature superconductors were
discovered in 1986, it caught the
imagination of the [scientific]
community," Shen said.
High temperature supercon
ductors were discovered in a
group of oxide metals — transi
tion metal oxides — usually con
sidered to be poor conductors.
"Understanding conduction in
these oxides has been a long
standing problem since the for
mulation of quantum mechanics
... [it is] one of the fundamental
problems in physics," Shen said.
A model of conduction of elec
trons in metal, known as band
theory, offers a starting point for
discussing physics in solids. The
theory explains the behavior of
semiconductors, silicon, and gal
lium arsenide, but has problems
explaining the high-temperature
superconducting behavior of the
oxides.
To investigate electron behav
ior in the oxides, Shen used a
photon to displace, or 'kick out',
an electron from the transition
metal oxide. The ejection is a sud
den event, so the electron still
carries information about its
behavior inside the atomic frame
work.
Analyzing the electron pro

vides information about electron
interaction and the charged par
ticles' tendencies to move differ
ently from electrons in conven
tional superconductors.
Removing an electron from
the atomic lattice also provides
crucial information about elec
tron pairing. "A superconductor,
even a high-temperature super
conductor ... is the consequence
of electrons forming a pair called
a Cooper pair," Shen said.
In a conventional supercon
ductor, a Cooper pair consists of
two electrons spinning and mov
ing in opposite directions. Cooper
pairs are the key to the BCS the
ory. However, according to Shen,
"there's a consensus that Cooper
pairs are also involved in the
high-temperature superconduc
tors, but the mechanism of their
(the electrons') pairing is still
unclear."
Making the transition from
superconductivity to normal
state requires breaking the Coop
er pair. The maximum energy
necessary to take one of the elec
tron partners out of the pair is
called the energy gap.
In high-temperature super
conductors, the Cooper pairs
overall have a larger maximum
energy gap that is highly angular
dependent. In contrast, most con


Andrew Martinez-Fonts — Dail
ventional superconductors have
Cooper pairs with very weakly
angular dependent energy gaps.
Energy required to break the
Cooper pair can be determined by
measuring the energy of the photon
that displaces one of the electron
partners. "Since I can do that (mea
sure the displacement energy) as a
function of angle, that's a unique
capability," Shen said. His discovery
of angular dependence in high-tem

perature superconductor energy
gaps offers a more comprehensive
understanding of these materials.
Shen notes possible future uses
for high-temperature superconduc
tors in magnetic resonance imaging
and telecommunications. These
ideas are not yet reality, and Shen
cautions that applications like these
are still in the future.
"For me," Shen explains, "it's
the intellectual problem of under
standing the wide range of prob
lems [of superconductivity] . . .
transition metal oxides have chal
lenged our understanding of nature
for 50 years."
