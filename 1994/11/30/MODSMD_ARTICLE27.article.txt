# Gene therapy helps vein grafts
## Engineering technique may aid bypass surgery

A group of Stanford researchers have found that
they are able to extend the longevity of vein grafts by
genetically altering them; the altered grafts have a
greater chance of staying healthy than unaltered
grafts.
Dr. Michael Mann, a Stanford surgery resident, pre
sented the group's results at the November 14 meeting
of the American Heart Association in Dallas. The
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute partially
funded the Stanford investigation.
If the genetic engineering technique works as well in
humans as it did in tests using rabbits, it could prevent
the thickening of vein grafts used to replace coronary
arteries and thus increase the overall success of bypass
surgery.
"The initial goal of the research group was to devel
op a genetic engineering strategy that would yield vein
grafts immune to a condition known as atherosclerosis,
the development of fatty plaque within the blood vein,"
Mann said.
Roughly fifty percent of vein grafts become partially
blocked by atherosclerotic plaque within ten years of
bypass surgery. During bypass surgery, doctors often
use vein segments, known as vein grafts, from the
patient's leg to act as coronary arteries. The vein seg
ment thus helps to provide the heart with oxygen-rich
blood.
However, the walls of vein grafts are too thin to han
dle the high pressures of their new location. The inner
wall of the vein graft, which is normally thin, begins to
thicken, thus making the vein susceptible to atheroscle
rosis.
Despite these problems, if more than one bypass is
needed, doctors continue to use grafts from leg veins
because of their overall suitability for the procedure.
Mann and his colleagues — Dr. Victor Dzau, pro
fessor of cardiovascular medicine, Dr. Gary Gibbons,
assistant professor of cardiovascular medicine, and
senior research scientist Robert Kernoff — hypoth
esized that they could alter the genetic program
ming of the vein cells to decrease the vein's tenden
cy to thicken under certain conditions. This would
prevent atherosclerosis.
The researchers used the technology of gene transfer
to create vein grafts that acted more like arteries. They
used small segments of DNA, called antisense oligonu
cleotides, to block two separate genes — responsible for
cell division and replication — within the cells of the
vein graft itself, Mann said.
To test if the gene transfer would be successful in
preventing the thickening of the vein grafts' inner
walls, the researchers used the genetically altered grafts
in rabbits. Mann and his colleagues performed bypass
surgery on 18 rabbits.
After checking a third of the rabbits at each of
three intervals of two, six, and 10 weeks, the scien
tists found that the inner layer of the genetically
altered vein grafts had not thickened. However, the
inner layer of vein grafts treated with inactive DNA
had thickened. Also, in the experimental vein grafts,
although the inner wall did not thicken, the middle
layer did harden. The researchers believe this change

helps the vein to act as a healthy artery and thus
withstand the high levels of pressure forced upon the
vein by the blood.
In a second experiment, the scientists compared the
altered and unaltered vein grafts of rabbits fed on a
high-cholesterol diet. Once again, the genetically
altered vein grafts showed no signs of disease, as
opposed to the unaltered veins, whose walls had thick
ened noticeably.
Dr. Mann sees the effects of the groups research as
three-fold. He applauds the effort as the first applica
tion of gene therapy —a type of genetic engineering —
on an existing surgical method, in this case bypass
surgery. "Our findings demonstrate, without a doubt,
that gene transfer, and genetic engineering in general,
can be used to improve the quality and success rate of
existing surgical and medical methods," Mann
affirmed.
The findings of the research could also drastically
improve the effectiveness of bypass surgery, and have a
huge impact on the procedure's success rate. Lastly,
Mann described his group's findings as opening the
door on a new avenue for understanding atherosclero
sis.
The research conducted by the Stanford group also
has the potential to be used to treat other diseases, such
as cancer. "The technology of gene transfer can be used
not only in the blocking of genes, but also in the adding
and activation of genes as well," he said.
The next step in the project will be performing labo
ratory tests on gene-altered human vein grafts.
