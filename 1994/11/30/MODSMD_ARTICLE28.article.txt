## A
						glimpse at a shooting star The
						career of water polo gunman Wolf Wigo 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
During the Stanford water polo
team's workout on the morning of the
NCAA championship game, Wolf Wigo,
the Cardinal's leading scorer was taking
shots.
Not from the field, where the senior
scored a career-high 71 goals this year —
Wigo was in the goal, blocking shots
taken by his teammates. In his 11 years
of playing water polo, Wigo has always
had the ability to score. But in the past
three years, an injury to his back has
limited the Stanford star.
After leading the Cardinal in scoring
with 46 goals as a freshman in 1991,
Wigo suffered three degenerative discs in
his lower back during his sophomore
campaign.
Although there were days when he
could not walk or make it out of bed,
Wigo went through limited practices and
once again led the team with 42 goals. In
the 1992 NCAA tournament, Wigo suited
up for the finals against California, a
game the Cardinal lost in triple overtime.
For the native of New York City, par
ticipating in that championship game
remains a highlight of his Stanford
career. A fierce competitor, Wigo
returned last year with pain in his back,
but winning a championship on his mind.
"Wolf is what you call a gamer," said
Cardinal coach Dante Dettamanti. "He
gets up for games, he lives for games.
Since he hurt his back, he's slowed
down, but it's amazing what he has been
able to accomplish."
Throughout his junior season, Wigo
saw limited play. He often was unable to
scrimmage or shoot at workouts and
even sat out several games. But when
the Cardinal needed him, Wigo was
there, amassing 44 goals, third best on
the team.

was a spark for Stanford, netting crucial
goals in the semi-finals against UC-
Irvine and in the championship match
against USC. A two-pointer by Wigo at
the end of a counterattack started a 5-0
run in the third quarter which put the
Trojans away and sealed Wigo's first
NCAA title.

beat my guy. I want to put
the other guy in his place.'

This year, in his final season, Wigo was
practically unstoppable. Despite practic
ing at half-speed while nursing his back,
Wigo poured in 71 points on the year.
The senior bettered his previous high
of five goals in a game twice this season,
scoring six, then seven points in a match.
Both times, Stanford's opponent was
USC.
"To score that many goals against the
No. 2 team in the country is incredible,
but that's the type of player Wolf is,"
said teammate and fellow senior Frank
Schneider. "You always want to have
Wolf playing for you."
At last weekend's NCAA tournament,
Stanford entered as a heavy favorite and
Wigo and company did not disappoint.
Wigo chipped in three goals in less than
two quarters of play against an out
matched Air Force squad, then scored
twice in the Cardinal's 9-5 semi-final vic
tory over UCLA.
His second goal against the Bruins
exemplified Wigo's superior offensive
skills and ball-handling ability. After
drawing a foul in the hole, Schneider
passed the ball to Wigo on the right wing.
Wigo caught the pass and spun to his
outside, getting by his defender. The
right-handed shooter then switched the

ball to his left-hand and beat goaltender
Matt Swanson down low with a defender
draped on his back.
"Wolf makes that move which is not
common in water polo, beating his man
when he has the ball," Dettamanti said.
"It's more of a soccer move, beating the
defender one-on-one."
In the finals, despite missing two
penalty shots, it was Wigo who scored to
break a 5-5 tie in the third quarter,
putting the Cardinal up to stay. Stanford
went on to a 14-10 victory.
The second national championship
was a relief for Wigo and his teammates.
"There was a lot of pressure to win," he
said. "Last year was a little better
because it was our first time, but this
was a great feeling. The whole season,
we were ready to be NCAA champs."
When he is in the water, Wigo sees
both his offensive and defensive assign
ments as intense personal battles.
"Whenever we're on offense, I want to
make sure to beat my guy, to show him I
can beat him one-on-one," Wigo said. "I
want to put the other guy in his place."
While he has always been known as a
scorer, Wigo is as tough a defender as
there is in the NCAA, a fact that Stanford
goaltender Jack Bowen can attest to.
"There are times when I look at Wolf
and I see it in his eyes that he's not going
to let his man score," Bowen said. "That
makes my job much easier, knowing I
don't have to worry about that player."
"Defensively, I try to shut guys
down," Wigo said. "I want to make them
feel that they shouldn't even try to make
a move. I like to mess with them, to get
them away from what they should be
thinking about."
In most cases, Wigo messes with his
man until his frustrated opponents
retaliate.
"Wolf knows what he can get away

Senior Wolf Wigo should become only the seventh player in Stanford history to earn
All-America honors all four years in college.
