America could never be a one
sport country.
As of now, a consistent football
intake is marginally healthy, con
sidering a solid 12 hours on the
weekend isn't too damaging to
either the waist line or study habits.

However, a solid 12 hours of
football on Saturday and Sunday
plus another two or three hours on
Monday night isn't the most bal
anced of sports diets. What ever
happened to Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday nights?

Baseball and hockey used to bail
out those who hungered for week
day sports. Just turning on the radio
or the television and listening to the
drone of a game can help you find
that inner peace necessary to tackle
almost any problem set.
Even for those who argue that
baseball isn't a real sport and those
who think hockey is too much like
soccer or too hard to follow, the
omnipresence of sports is a com
forting feeling. Just knowing the
score of the game and rooting for
some team against some other
team in a most nonchalant,
detached way is enough to keep
those serious sports fans going.
Football is great, but you can't
pay anyone to play 162 games a year
with brutal 17-game road trips and
those wonderful weekend double
headers. And with the baseball and
hockey strikes, America has pretty
much become a one-sport nation
this season â€” insane amounts of
