# Looking for life beyond football
## Invest some eggs in those 10-foot baskets 
### 
America could never be a one
sport country.
As of now, a consistent football
intake is marginally healthy, con
sidering a solid 12 hours on the
weekend isn't too damaging to
either the waist line or study habits.

However, a solid 12 hours of
football on Saturday and Sunday
plus another two or three hours on
Monday night isn't the most bal
anced of sports diets. What ever
happened to Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday nights?

Baseball and hockey used to bail
out those who hungered for week
day sports. Just turning on the radio
or the television and listening to the
drone of a game can help you find
that inner peace necessary to tackle
almost any problem set.
Even for those who argue that
baseball isn't a real sport and those
who think hockey is too much like
soccer or too hard to follow, the
omnipresence of sports is a com
forting feeling. Just knowing the
score of the game and rooting for
some team against some other
team in a most nonchalant,
detached way is enough to keep
those serious sports fans going.
Football is great, but you can't
pay anyone to play 162 games a year
with brutal 17-game road trips and
those wonderful weekend double
headers. And with the baseball and
hockey strikes, America has pretty
much become a one-sport nation
this season — insane amounts of


Kathryn

football on the weekends and Pavlo
vian anticipation on the weekdays
for the next week's football games.
After suffering through months
of week-night paralysis, begging for
quick sports fixes between Melrose
and the Late Show, too cheap to pay
for ESPN and too lazy to do some
thing constructive, the ultimate
sports junkie can finally seek solace
in the basketball season.

Living in the Bay Area, basket
ball fans are treated to two of the
worst teams in the NBA this season.
Golden State, whose manage
ment is probably kicking them
selves for not holding onto Anfernee
Hardaway when they had the
chance and Sacramento, whose bas
ketball team should just l>e taken
out into a field and shot, are some of
the lowlights in the league.
For those from back east, the
Bulls and the Knicks might have
some competition this year with the
Orlando Magic. Shaq is back, and
seemingly bigger than ever.
Die-hard fans might think the

game is not the same with Michael
Jordan in the Arizona Instructional
League flailing away at backdoor
curveballs, but rookies like Grant
Hill are doing just fine, thank you.
And then there are those other
bonus babies gracing the NBA with
their presence this year. Million-dol
lar men signing million-dollar shoe
contracts marketing millions of dol
lars worth of sports drinks, pranc
ing around the hardwood floor in
their baggy shorts and million-dol
lar attitudes playing a roughhouse,
blacktop-style basketball game.
Isn't basketball grand.
Still experiencing a little of that

nasty post-weekend f(X)tball after
taste in your mouth? Wean yourself
back onto 24-hour sports, seven
days a week. Basketball is just start
ing, there might be breaks in the
hockey talks, and baseball is not
dead yet. If that's not enough, there
always Australian rugby, pedigree
dog-shows and monster truck ral
lies on cable.
The world doesn't have to
revolve around football — except on
Saturdays and Sundays.

be found in front of the boob-tube if
