# ASSU prepares special-fee plan for final passage
## Senate hears flurry of amendments 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
Despite a storm of about 20 pro
posed amendments, the recommen
dations of the Special Fee Reform
Task Force emerged largely un
changed from debate by the ASSU
Senate at its meeting last night.
The most contested amend
ments — some of which failed very
narrowly — aimed to provide un
dergraduate voters a higher degree
of certainty in terms of how much
they would have to pay to fund cer
tain groups.
While all the "unfriendly"

amendments were voted down, a se
ries of less significant amendments
viewed by the task force as "friend
ly" were automatically incorporated
into the proposal, which the task
force first presented to the senate at
its meeting last week.
Among the most significant as
pects of the task force's report are
proposals to separate undergradu
ate and graduate students into two
distinct "voting communities" and
to eliminate the special-fee refund
system.
A bloc of senators — including
undergraduates Charles Katz,
Stephen Russell and Andre
Vanier — proposed a series of
related amendments that would
have allowed voters to decide
what portion of a group's budget
request they wished to fund.
Their major point of con
tention with the task force's pro
posal was the provision creating
the two voting communities.
According to the provision, if a
group's fee request were approved
by either undergraduates or grad
uate students and not approved
by the other group, the voting
community that approved the
request would have to foot the
entire bill.
The senators argued that since
undergraduates more often
approve fee requests, they are in

danger of paying higher overall
refunds without the opportunity
of getting a refund.
Their amendments varied in
form, but generally tried to pro
vide voters more options. One of
the amendments would have had
students designate whether they
wished to provide either 50 per
cent or 100 percent of a group's
request in the case that the other
voting community denied the fee
request outright.
"This will allow students to
have some say, some amount of
flexibility and some amount of
power," Katz argued before the
senate.
Advocates of these amend
ments warned that a failure to
assuage the concerns of the
undergraduate voting community
would lead to the report's down
fall.
Senate approval of the report
requires a two-thirds vote, and
the vote will likely come at next

week's meeting. If approved by
the senate, the recommendations
would be put before by student
body in a special election, which
would likely be scheduled during
winter quarter.
The major objections to the
amendments were that they
would complicate the process —
voiding many of the positive steps
taken by the task force — and
that they would have a negative
impact on student groups.
"It seems to me that student
groups are going to be devastat
ed," said Council of Presidents
member Vanessa Alvarado.
Deputy Senate Chair Michael
Choo added that under the
amendments, undergraduates
would have had an incentive to
only fund at the 50 percent level.
"I think what this . . . does is
increase uncertainty. ... I think
that this effort will stomp on stu
dent groups," he said.
Others argued that any system

in which student groups could be
provided different portions of
their funding requests would lead
these groups to inflate their bud
gets.
All of the changes that were
incorporated into the recommen
dations were viewed as "friendly"
by the task force. One provides a
refund option for students who
conscientiously object to a stu
dent group's specific fee request.
Another puts a cap on the total
amount of funding the senate can
request from students each year.
The cap would be set at $860,000
for this spring's election and
would thereafter be based on the
previous year's request total plus
inflation.
Despite the heated debate last
night, Senate Chair Nawwar Kas
rawi remains optimistic that the
report will be approved next week.
"I think it probably has a good
chance of passing given the debate
tonight," he said.
