# Fencers to face Banana Slugs, Spartans

Relying on depth and steady leadership, the
Stanford varsity fencing teams will lunge at two
Northern California opponents on Saturday as
their regular seasons unfold.
UC-Santa Cruz and San Jose State promise
stilT competition. Featuring U.S. Pan-American
Team candidate Tasha Martin in foil, the
Banana Slugs boast the only other high-caliber
team of varsity status in Northern California
besides Stanford. Meets in the past against Car
dinal have been tight for both the men and
women.
Santa Cruz's one downfall, however, could
provide Stanford with the winning edge: the
Ladv Banana Slugs have no epee squad, as this is

the first year of women's epee competition and
they have failed to put together a team. Out of
the 32 bouts in each match, therefore, the Santa
Cruz women will automatically forfeit half to
give the Cardinal an instant 16-0.
However, while one team's weakness usually
lends its opponent an advantage, the Cardinal
may not be able to capitalize on the situation.
Stanford's strongest women fencers — the
epeeists — will not be able to put points on the
board, leaving the burden to an inexperienced
foil squad.
Despite this drawback, women's coach Sherry
Posthumus believes the young team will take the
meet. "I think our foil team will pull out the
bouts necessary to win," she said.
The Banana Slugs' men's team will not be as
strong of a contender, although in the past it has

sported some of the most talented athletes on
the West Coast. While Santa Cruz features some
depth, the Cardinal looks for a win at the hands
of senior Geoff Donaker or freshman Sasha
Zucker. Unfortunately for Stanford, freshman
standout Sean McClain won't be able to com
pete, as he is in Germany at the World Fencing
Cup.
While Santa Cruz may provide the Cardinal
with a challenge, San Jose State maintains only
club team standing. However, the Spartans have
the history to make a run for the win: in the
1980s, the Spartans ranked among the nation's
elite. Posthumus even trained at San Jose State
when Olympians used the Spartan facilities.
"Ten years ago, San Jose State would come
