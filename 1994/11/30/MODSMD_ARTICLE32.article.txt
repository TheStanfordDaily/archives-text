result in victories. Indeed, the junior played a pivotal role during last
weekend's NCAA tournament. Against the Falcons, he registered five
saves in addition to a blocked penalty shot in the first half, allowing
freshman Chris Aquilera to play the rest of the match. In the semi-finals
against the Bruins, Bowen chalked up 10 saves to go along with seven
steals. Finally, in the finals against the Trojans, he notched 11 saves, five
in a crucial third quarter. Bowen's performance earned him co-MVP
