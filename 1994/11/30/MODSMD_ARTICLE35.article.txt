# Strap into snowboarding
## Shredding is more than just a skiing alternative 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
Even to the most established skiers,
phrases like "sliding rails" and "backside
360s indy grabbed" are nonsensical gibber
ish. Yet, it is likely that this winter, due to
the increasing popularity of snowboarding,
such terms will be heard more frequently.
Popularized in the last decade, the sport
has hit resorts across the nation with force
and has completely changed the face of the
slopes. Rooted in the thrasher mentality of
skateboarding and surfing, snowboarding
brings with it a youthful crowd and flavor.
While the sport has expanded far beyond its
beginnings as a clone of such pasttimes, its
participants remain typically teenagers
and college-age adults.
For the beginning snowboarder, howev
er, the sport will hold many similarities
with the experience of skiing. Most novices
will invariably find themselves riding
"alpine" down the slope, carving down the
mountain without jumping or spinning.
Sharing the same trails, the boarders will
face much of the same difficulties as the

skier.
As far as cost is concerned, money spent
by a snowboarder is also similar to that of a
skier. The rental of a board and boots
ranges anywhere from $20 to $45 per day
and the cost of a lift ticket remains un
changed from the normal skiing rate.
If one wishes to buy rather than rent
his/her equipment, the cost, again similar
to that of skiing, would fall somewhere be
tween $600 and $700. Besides the board
and the boots, the beginning snowboarder
needs no other specialized gear besides the
typical winter attire of any winter sports
participant.
For more advanced boarders, they may
ride half-pipe, where they perform jumps
and spins in a half-cylindrical shaped run.
Experts may also find themselves riding
race, through a course with gates, or ex
treme, through deep powder and steep
chutes.
Expert snowboarders may display their
repertoire of tricks which include, besides
the "sliding rails" and "backside 360 indy

grabbed" mentioned in earlier,
more dramatic sidecuts (the man
ner in which one turns), freeriding
over obstacles (jibbing), and jump
ing and landing on top of obstacles
(bonking).
The vastly different mentality
of the snowboarder from the skier

may be assumed to clash with that
of the skier, but most experienced
boarders, skiers, and resort work
ers would disagree.
One instructor at a nearby re
sort said, "Most of the time,
everybody just looks out for
everybody else, regardless of
what they are riding. No matter
what, you have to be responsible
for following the rules of the
slope and staying out of other
people's way."
