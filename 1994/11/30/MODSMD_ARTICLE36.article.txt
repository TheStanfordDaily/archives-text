# Skiers 'Code' benefits experts and beginners alike
## 
### Sarah Nagae Editorial staff 
Just as any sport comes with its
own set of rules, skiing and snow
boarding are no exceptions. There is
a definite slope etiquette — both
spoken and unspoken — which one
should follow while cruising down
the hills as well as riding up above
them.
Skiing most important, al
though not always abided by, regu
lations are spelled out in the Skier
Responsibility Code (this also ap
plies to snowboarders). Large signs
displaying this code are often tacked
to the chairlift support poles for rid
ers to read, ponder and many times
affix stickers to. Here are the Code's
highlights, and their interpreta
tions:
1. Ski under control and in such a
manner that you can stop or avoid
other skiers or objects. (While you
may get a huge adrenaline rush
from going Mach 10 down the hill,
don't get going so fast that you can't
stop. This rule is actually for your
own bodily protection as running
into that tree that suddenly came
into view could put a serious crimp
in future skiing plans.)
2. When skiing downhill or overtak
ing another skier, you must avoid
the skier below you. (In other
words, when some poor, innocent
beginner snowplows in front of you,
make every effort not to smash into
them. In other words TURN!)
3. You must not stop where you ob
struct a trail or are not visible from
above. (Although this seems like a
logical, easy-to-follow stipulation,
it's incredible how many people
simply plop down whenever they
happen to get tired, or wherever
they happen to fall. This can cause
serious problems when the afore
mentioned speedster barrels over a
ridge, only to see the poor, innocent,

fallen beginner after its too late ...
Better to sit on the side of the trail.)
4. When entering a trail or starting
downhill, yield to other skiers. (This
doesn't involve warning the entire
hill of your approach by bellowing
"Hey, you in the red jacket, you bet
ter move out the way or I'm going to
plow you over." Instead, try the de
fensive-skiing approach. Look to
see if anyone is coming when you're
about to cruise down the slope or
onto the run from an adjoining trail.
If there is someone coming, just let
them pass before completing that
awesome jump you've been waiting
to try. This way, they will be clear of
your path and won't be there to see
you wipe-out when you attempt a
landing.)
5. All skiers shall use devices to help
prevent run-away skis. (Almost all
skies made today have built in brak
ing devices which stop them from
sliding down the hill after they've
released. Snowboards don't have
such fancy gadgets and should al
ways be worn with a safety leash
which wraps around the rider's
ankle.)
6. You shall keep off closed trails
and posted areas and observe all
posted signs. (Yes, there's probably
a reason why that rope or bright
pink flag has been placed where it
has. Respect these boundaries,
they're set up for skiers' safety as
they often mark areas where rocks,
roots or dirt are sticking above the
snow or designate avalanche dan
ger zones. While the powder always
looks deeper on the other side of the
rope, play it safe and stay on the
right side.)
While these six points make up
the "official" skier code of conduct,
there are also informal guidelines
which govern skiers' actions when
not actually going down the hill.
Starting in the parking lot, don't

lean your skis or snowboard on any
one else's car — for obvious rea
sons. Also, when carrying your skis
on your shoulder, be aware of whose
face they might wack when you
turn around unexpectedly. They

can be a mode of recreation, but are
also very sharp and can turn into
dangerous weapons even when you
don't mean them to be.
The proper adhesion of the lift
ticket can cause problems for the

first timer (or even those who have
been skiing for years but have never
quite gotten the hang of the whole
peel-and-stick concept). The best

way to go about it is to fold the tick
et in half before removing the wax
paper. Decide where you want to
hook it (it's best to attach it to your
coat or pants, something that
you're sure to be wearing all day)
and peel off the backing. Carefully
stick the tag together and you're set
to go.
Although they do get to hang out
on the slopes all day, the life of a lift
chair operator isn't actually all that
glamorous so try to express some
appreciation for their help.
"Thanks" or a smile will do. Once on
the chair, make sure not to bounce
or rock unnecessarily as the lift's
sheer height tends to spook many
people and the additional turbu
lence might really freak them out.
Some quite interesting conver
sations are struck up while you

and fellow riders are shivering in
numbness together or enjoying the
same, breathtaking view. Granted
it may be tempting to yell down to
the hotshot who just crashed while
attempting the double black dia
mond below you, but tiy to re
strain yourself. Finally, when get
ting off the lift, try your best to
stay out other people's pathways
and certainly don't push or hang
on them.
Skiing derives much of its
uniqueness from the freedom it
grants its participants. Whether ex
ploring freshly snowed-on trails,
traversing the pristine, back-coun
try slopes or simply trying to make
it down the bunny hill without end
ing up on your face, the opportuni
ties for exploration can seem virtu
ally endless. By just following these
simple, logical rules you can not
only experience the adventure of
skiing, it's more likely that you'll
arrive back at the lodge at the end of
the day in one piece.
