## Discovering the serenity and pace of the 'other' skiing

I must be getting old.
As much as I love the exhilaration of speed
ing downhill and weaving in and out of more
advanced skiers in my perilous attempts to
reach the bottom of slopes, I've discovered
that cross country skiing is more my speed.
I tried the sport for the first time last win
ter at Tahoe Donner Cross Country Resort in
North Shore Lake Tahoe. Believing that the
sport was for the less youthful, slower winter
sports aficionado, I approached the experi
ence reluctantly. But my apprehensions dis
appeared into the frosty air as soon as I
clipped into the skis.
The first thing I noticed is how inexpensive
the endeavor turned out to be. Equipment is
very reasonably priced, averaging around $ 15
for an entire package, and a day pass is only
$18 — a bargain when compared with sky
rocketing prices for downhill equipment and
mountain privileges.
I found the sport challenging enough to be
exciting but relaxing enough to be enjoyable.
My five friends and I first tested out the
equipment, slipping and sliding over the snow
until we got into the rhythm. Once we gath

ered momentum and managed to force our
arms in sync with our legs, we began to glide
easily along the paths.
Without having to concentrate on my
every movement, I was able to thoroughly
enjoy the scenery. That has always been a
hangup I've had with downhill skiing — the
beautiful surroundings almost go to waste as
I zip (or tumble) down the slopes. Minus the
speed, the trees are more beautiful, the snow
is whiter and the air is fresher. Most impres
sive of all are the dazzling views of Lake
Tahoe.
After the first 20 minutes of skiing, I real
ized that the sport is not for the faint of heart
— it requires endurance to push and pull one
self through the snow. Every so often a hill
would offer a small respite, but the majority
of the journey was on an uphill incline or
along a lengthy, flat stretch. My lungs and
legs were definitely feeling the effects, just in
time for a mid-morning snack of high-energy
trail mix.
Skiing without bundles of woolen
sweaters, down jackets and long undies added
more enjoyment to the experience. I bravely
faced the elements clad only in a turtleneck,
sweatshirt and ski pants. Anything more
would have been too hot. The constant move

ment, plus the absence of long ski lifts that in
evitably freeze even the die-hard downhillers,
made the cold actually pleasant.
It's true that the sport offers less thrill-a
moment action, and those who are seeking
life-threatening stunts may not be complete-

ly fulfilled after a day of cross country skiing.
However, I did have my share of hair-raising
adventures. Once the wind picked up and the
visibility decreased, our group had to descend
a hill to reach safer ground. This meant hot
dogging our way down several steep slopes —
and with my heels detached from the skis, it
was definitely an acrobatic test.
Perhaps I am getting old, or maybe my
taste of adventure is simply changing. Re

gardless, my day at Tahoe Donner was peace
ful, fun and exciting. It requires an agreeable
blend of athleticism and a deep appreciation
for the outdoors. It also necessitates patience,
as getting from Point A to Point B will take a
little longer than it would according to down
hill rules.
Cross country skiing offers great exercise
and a chance to be with good friends — and ac
tually chat with them instead of watch their
backends as they ski down the slopes. The si
lence in the winter shouldn't always be
spoiled by the sounds of creaky ski lifts,
swarming kids and kamikaze downhill
screams. It should be appreciated every now
and then in the country.
Tahoe Donner is just one of many cross
country resorts in the Lake Tahoe area. Royal
Gorge, Kirkwood, Squaw Valley and Spooner
Lake are among the most frequently recom
mended. Royal Gorge boasts miles of lovely
cross country paths, while Spooner Lake is on
the simpler, quieter side. Squaw Valley is re
putedly very flat but offers paths around the
entire lake. It's also recommended that skiers
rent the equipment at their destination, as
good deals can be found at most resorts and
the weather often changes the pathway con
ditions.
