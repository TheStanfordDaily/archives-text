# So many possibilities...
## ...Skiing at Tahoe and beyond

Winter sports enthusiasts can reach ideal skiing and snowboarding destinations just hours from campus

California. The Golden State.
The land of sandy beaches and
ocean breezes. A destination
known for its guaranteed temper
ate climate, palm trees and ... its
amazing skiing?
When most people think of the
country's best skiing they think of
states such as Colorado, Utah and
Washington. But right here in Cal
ifornia, in Stanford's own back
yard in fact, are found some of the
finest skiing and winter recreation
resorts on the West Coast and, ar
guably, the country. Skiing, cross

country skiing and snowboarding
opportunities abound as slopes
suited for any skill-level or "guts"
level of winter adventurer can be
reached after a three to five-hour
car ride from campus.
For years, Lake Tahoe has
proven the most popular destina
tion of Stanford students heading
to the mountains, whether on a Fi
nals blow-off fling with their
friends or on that infamous dorm
ski trip. Boasting such mega-re
sorts as Squaw Valley, Northstar
and Heavenly as well as many
smaller, less crowded areas, Tahoe
serves as Northern California's
snow haven.
And while they don't carry the

same name recognition as the
Tahoe resorts, the slopes at Mt.
Shasta, Bear Valley and Mammoth
just add to the acres of possibilities
accessible within a morning's drive
from Stanford, often at a cheaper
price.
No matter how you envision the
ideal ski vacation — anything from
a weekend spent learning to snow
board on the bunny hills to 10 days
of extreme skiing — that outing is
surely possible given the host of
nearby resorts, slopes and trails.
Here's a rundown of the area's
finest:
North Lake Tahoe
Housing the largest number of
ski areas within the smallest geo
graphical area of anywhere in the
Tahoe area, and, perhaps, all of
California, the north side of the
lake is any skier's mecca of oppor
tunity. Its two best known and
most popular destinations are
Squaw Valley USA and Northstar
at-Tahoe, both which combine
world class runs with up-scale ac
commodations, restaurants and
non-skiing recreational opportuni
ties.
Host of the 1960 Winter
Olympic Games, Squaw ranks as
Tahoe's largest skiing operation
with over 4,000 acres of runs span
ning six Sierra peaks. Squaw's base
lodge contains rental shops,
restaurants serving anything from
hamburgers to lattes to sushi and
retail stores where the latest in
cold-weather fashion can be pur
chased. The base, at 6,200 feet, is
the origin of Squaw's chair lift sys
tem which encompasses 32 lifts, in
cluding a Super Gondola which
sweeps skiers up to its 8,200 foot
drop-off point.
Squaw truly offers terrain for
everyone from the first-timer to
the hotshot who was born with skis
pre-attached. One quarter of the
runs are devoted to beginners as
wide-open, gently sloping hills
make it a good place to learn the ba
sics of skiing or snowboarding.
Since the easiest slopes at Squaw
are not clustered at the bottom of
the mountain but can also be found
close to the top, the views provide
learners with an added perk.
Forty-five percent of Squaw is
designated as "blue-square" skiing
for those of intermediate ability
while the remaining 30 percent is
only for the experienced, or the
particularly adventurous. Those
looking for the ultimate, "extreme
skiing" experience will likely find it
among Squaw's back-country
runs, both remote and risky.
Squaw's extensive variety and
lush amenities come with a heavier
price tag than many other resorts
— $43 per day. Via Interstate 80,
Squaw Valley USA is 196 miles
from San Francisco, and lies just
two miles off Highway 89.
Although not as elaborate as
Squaw Valley, Northstar pledges
to keep smaller crowds than its
nearby counterpart. By limiting
the amount of tickets sold on popu
lar weekends, the slopes of North
star are never clogged with skiers.

Located just south of Truckee
and east of the Truckee River off
Highway 267, Northstar offers
1,800 acres of slopes and a vertical
drop of 2,200 feet. All-day tickets
sport a $42 price tag, but Northstar
skiers do not have to share the
slopes with as many others.
While not tailored for the dare
devil, Northstar appeals especial
ly to the intermediate skier. Half
the mountain's runs are labeled
with blue squares, and novices
and experts split the remaining
courses.
Although many so-called inter
mediate skiers take a stab at some
of Northstar's difficult slopes, the
Backside Express leads to eight
other runs for die-hards. With ti
tles such as Burn Out and Rapids,
even the consummate adventurer
faces a challenge.
Boreal is located atop Donner
Summit and is also just off Inter
state 80. Stressing a family atmos
phere, Boreal still comes with a $33
per person all-day charge. Howev
er, all-day admission provides 12
hours of skiing from 9 a.m. to 9
p.m.
Boreal offers 36 different runs
for all levels, and the Quicksilver
Quad leads to five south-facing
runs for those seeking a challenge
or a change of pace. Beginners can
purchase a lift ticket, two hour
group lesson and equipment rental
for a total of $40.
Both downhill and cross-coun
try skiers can find suitable slopes
at Tahoe Donner. Intermediate
downhillers choose from four runs
down the Face of Eagle Rock, and
advanced skiers can take either
Skip's Plunge or the Racecourse.
Beginners also can get in the act,
with the Mile Run and the Snow
bird Run.
Cross-country skiers have 33
scenic trails to keep them enter
tained. 4,800 acres and 70 kilome
ters of terrain are available for
only $15 a day, with Saturday
night skiing from 5-8 p.m. also an
option.
Packages are also available for
first-time and early intermediate
skiers, and professional instruc
tors offer 90-minute training ses
sions for reasonable fees.
Tahoe Donner, in Truckee, is
just five miles from Donner State
Park. Take the Northwoods Blvd.
exit off Interstate 80. With all-day
tickets costing only $26, Tahoe
Donner also pleases the pocket
book.
The Donner Ski Ranch, located
outside the congested Lake Tahoe
Basin, is a 175-mile trip east of San
Francisco on 1-80. With 45 runs, a
$20 daily cost (only $10 on most
weekdays) and evening skiing, the
Donner Ski Ranch provides an eco
nomical, scenic alternative to
other, more elaborate resorts.
Portions of the 400 skiable acres
are located in Tahoe National For
est. A triple chair and five double
chair lifts transport customers up
and down the mountain, and skiers
have 45 runs to choose from, even
ly distributed for skiers of all abili
ties.

This summer, Sugar Bowl
kicked off its seven-year, $24 mil
lion upgrade and expansion.
Mount Judah, a new addition to
Sugar Bowl's four other peaks, in
creases the trail count to 58.
With 1,110 skiable acres, a ver
tical drop of 1,500 feet and an up
hill capacity of 11,300 skiers per
hour, Sugar Bowl scarcely needs
the upgrade. Experienced skiers
will enjoy Sugar Bowl the most, as
45 percent of the trails boast a
black diamond rating. Only 15 per
cent receive the easier green circle.
The advanced skier will find the
$37 price tag easier to swallow, al
though Sugar Bowl is open only
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sugar Bowl
claims to be the easiest resort to ac
cess from the Bay Area, and is lo
cated off the Soda Springs exit of I
-80.
Nordic skiing buffs may flock to
Royal Gorge, which specializes in
cross-country. A $20 bill grants ac
cess to North America's most
scenic and extensive network of
cross-country trails — 88, to be
exact, including 9,172 acres and 10
warming huts.
Beginners also will take delight
in the 28 novice trails, and average
skiers have 44 options. Routes vary
in length and extend as long as 22
kilometers for the Interconnect
Trail.
Royal Gorge is also located on
the Donner Summit and, like
Sugar Bowl, is off the Soda Springs
exit on 1-80.
West Lake Tahoe
Homewood and Alpine Mead
ows stand alone among major re
sorts on Tahoe's West Side.
Though only five miles south of
Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows
often is significantly warmer.
Homewood is found slightly fur
ther south and offers breathtaking
scenery.
Alpine Meadows, with a $43 all
day price tag, guarantees a calmer
environment than nearby Squaw.
Though offering only 2,000 acres,
the trails cater to skiers of every
level, especially intermediates. A
total of 11 lifts, including two ex
press quads, transport skiers over
the 1,600 foot vertical span.
Homewood offers fewer acres
(1,260), a similar vertical drop and
only a $32 cost. For those wishing
to take a friend skiing over vaca
tion, Homewood's "two-for-one"
Wednesdays will ease the financial
burden.
Snowboarders will enjoy the
focus on their activity at Home
wood. They are granted access to
all slopes and can select either gen
tle runs or expert trails.
Those who would rather stick to
skiing have a vast array of 57 trails
to whet their appetite. Beginners
will be better of elsewhere, with
only five routes available. Howev
er, the skiing veteran will find the
wide selection appealing.
South Lake Tahoe
The south side of the lake, while
not as cluttered as the north, offers
additional high-quality resorts.


Curtis Song — Daily
Peering over the side of a dangerous-looking cliff, skiers should use
caution on such terrain.
The largest spot, Heavenly, lies in
both California and Nevada.
As its name implies, Heavenly
rivals Squaw Valley with its deluxe
facilities. With a peak elevation of
just over 10,000 feet and a 3,500
foot vertical drop, Heavenly's
breathtaking views are just one of
its advantages.
Sixteen chairlifts move skiers
from the parking lot to the summit.
Once there, skiers find a massive
4,800 acres of terrain to sample.
Novices can tackle the fundamen
tals on 20 percent of the runs,
while 35 percent are designated
with black diamonds.
This skiers' paradise is a direct
trip along Highway 50 from Sacra
mento, and $42 allows skiers to
enter the Heavenly kingdom.
Intermediate skiers can also
partake in Sierra-at-Tahoe's 22
routes for their level. The other
half of Sierra's trails are evenly di
vided between the other two abili
ties.
With 2,000 acres and a drop of
2,212 feet, Sierra-at-Tahoe calls it
self the third-largest resort in
Tahoe. For $37 a day and a 83-mile
trek down Highway 50 from Sacra
mento, skiers can absorb its at
tractive alpine environment.
Kirkwood has the best cross
country trails of any place south of
Tahoe. With 80 kilometers of
groomed track and a focus on inter
mediate routes (60 percent), the
$14 price of admission provides a
full day of action.

For alpine skiers, Kirkwood of
fers over 60 trails, 2,300 acres of
terrain and a 2,000 foot drop. Rates
are also reasonable — $40 for the
day but $10 less for those 13-24
years of age.
Central Sierra
Moving away from Lake Tahoe
up north, Mt. Shasta is an easy 250
mile drive north of San Francisco.
Further, most of the driving is easy
along Interstate 5, and the park lies
just 10 miles east of 1-5 via High
way 89.
One of the tallest peaks in the
contiguous U.S. at 14,162 feet, Mt.
Shasta's scenery is second to none.
From Wednesday to Saturday
nights, skiers can fly down the
lighted slopes. A full day's skiing
costs $32 (9 a.m. to 10 p.m.), but
the night-only package is $17 (4-10
p.m.) and the day package costs
$26.
Cross-country skiing is also
available, on a scaled-down basis.
Only 25 kilometers of power-tilled
track are available, but the price,
$8, is unbeatable.
Affordable prices make Bear
Valley, two hours northeast of
Stockton along Highway 4, a vi
able alternative to Tahoe for
some. For a low $28, Bear Valley's
1,280 acres allow every skier
ample opportunity to find an ap
propriate course. The upper
slopes are suitable for those look
ing to get their feet wet, and the
steeper lower portion of the hill

will stimulate the skiing stud.
For $14, cross-country skiing,
especially for rookies, rivals that in
North Tahoe. Only 7 of the 32
trails are black diamonds, includ
ing the 1.5 kilometer Grin and
Bear It, called "the most difficult
and challenging trail in the West."
Eastern Sierra
Mammoth, a huge ski resort in
the Inyo Forest, provides enter
tainment prior to skiing — the
scenic drive. Take either Interstate
580 to Highway 120 or 1-80 to
Highway 50, which will join with
Highway 395. Going south will
lead to the Mammoth Lakes
tumoff, Highway 203.
After the lengthy drive, 31
lifts will ensure that transporta
tion is no longer a chore. Mam
moth Mountain lives up to its
title, with a 3,100 foot vertical
drop, 3,500 skiable acres and a
whopping 150 trails. The world's
largest snowcat fleet also grooms
more acreage than any ski area in
the nation. Unfortunately, all of
Mammoth's amenities come with
a mammoth price tag — at least
$40 a head.
For the alpine and cross-coun
try buff alike, skiers of all levels of
talent should have little difficulty
finding a satisfying resort. With
skiing options scattered through
out a wide area, Californians can
find fun in the snow as well as fun
in the sun.

of Lake Tahoe.

Shasta, Bear Valley and Mammoth
just add to the acres of possibilities
accessible within a morning's drive
from Stanford, often at a cheaper
price.
No matter how you envision the
ideal ski vacation — anything from
a weekend spent learning to snow
board on the bunny hills to 10 days
of extreme skiing — that outing is
surely possible given the host of
nearby resorts, slopes and trails.
Here's a rundown of the area's
finest:
North Lake Tahoe
Housing the largest number of
ski areas within the smallest geo
graphical area of anywhere in the
Tahoe area, and, perhaps, all of
California, the north side of the
lake is any skier's mecca of oppor
tunity. Its two best known and
most popular destinations are
Squaw Valley USA and Northstar
at-Tahoe, both which combine
world class runs with up-scale ac
commodations, restaurants and
non-skiing recreational opportuni
ties.
Host of the 1960 Winter
Olympic Games, Squaw ranks as
Tahoe's largest skiing operation
with over 4,000 acres of runs span
ning six Sierra peaks. Squaw's base
lodge contains rental shops,
restaurants serving anything from
hamburgers to lattes to sushi and
retail stores where the latest in
cold-weather fashion can be pur
chased. The base, at 6,200 feet, is
the origin of Squaw's chair lift sys
tem which encompasses 32 lifts, in
cluding a Super Gondola which
sweeps skiers up to its 8,200 foot
drop-off point.
Squaw truly offers terrain for
everyone from the first-timer to
the hotshot who was born with skis
pre-attached. One quarter of the
runs are devoted to beginners as
wide-open, gently sloping hills
make it a good place to learn the ba
sics of skiing or snowboarding.
Since the easiest slopes at Squaw
are not clustered at the bottom of
the mountain but can also be found
close to the top, the views provide
learners with an added perk.
Forty-five percent of Squaw is
designated as "blue-square" skiing
for those of intermediate ability
while the remaining 30 percent is
only for the experienced, or the
particularly adventurous. Those
looking for the ultimate, "extreme
skiing" experience will likely find it
among Squaw's back-country
runs, both remote and risky.
Squaw's extensive variety and
lush amenities come with a heavier
price tag than many other resorts
— $43 per day. Via Interstate 80,
Squaw Valley USA is 196 miles
from San Francisco, and lies just
two miles off Highway 89.
Although not as elaborate as
Squaw Valley, Northstar pledges
to keep smaller crowds than its
nearby counterpart. By limiting
the amount of tickets sold on popu
lar weekends, the slopes of North
star are never clogged with skiers.

Located just south of Truckee
and east of the Truckee River off
Highway 267, Northstar offers
1,800 acres of slopes and a vertical
drop of 2,200 feet. All-day tickets
sport a $42 price tag, but Northstar
skiers do not have to share the
slopes with as many others.
While not tailored for the dare
devil, Northstar appeals especial
ly to the intermediate skier. Half
the mountain's runs are labeled
with blue squares, and novices
and experts split the remaining
courses.
Although many so-called inter
mediate skiers take a stab at some
of Northstar's difficult slopes, the
Backside Express leads to eight
other runs for die-hards. With ti
tles such as Burn Out and Rapids,
even the consummate adventurer
faces a challenge.
Boreal is located atop Donner
Summit and is also just off Inter
state 80. Stressing a family atmos
phere, Boreal still comes with a $33
per person all-day charge. Howev
er, all-day admission provides 12
hours of skiing from 9 a.m. to 9
p.m.
Boreal offers 36 different runs
for all levels, and the Quicksilver
Quad leads to five south-facing
runs for those seeking a challenge
or a change of pace. Beginners can
purchase a lift ticket, two hour
group lesson and equipment rental
for a total of $40.
Both downhill and cross-coun
try skiers can find suitable slopes
at Tahoe Donner. Intermediate
downhillers choose from four runs
down the Face of Eagle Rock, and
advanced skiers can take either
Skip's Plunge or the Racecourse.
Beginners also can get in the act,
with the Mile Run and the Snow
bird Run.
Cross-country skiers have 33
scenic trails to keep them enter
tained. 4,800 acres and 70 kilome
ters of terrain are available for
only $15 a day, with Saturday
night skiing from 5-8 p.m. also an
option.
Packages are also available for
first-time and early intermediate
skiers, and professional instruc
tors offer 90-minute training ses
sions for reasonable fees.
Tahoe Donner, in Truckee, is
just five miles from Donner State
Park. Take the Northwoods Blvd.
exit off Interstate 80. With all-day
tickets costing only $26, Tahoe
Donner also pleases the pocket
book.
The Donner Ski Ranch, located
outside the congested Lake Tahoe
Basin, is a 175-mile trip east of San
Francisco on 1-80. With 45 runs, a
$20 daily cost (only $10 on most
weekdays) and evening skiing, the
Donner Ski Ranch provides an eco
nomical, scenic alternative to
other, more elaborate resorts.
Portions of the 400 skiable acres
are located in Tahoe National For
est. A triple chair and five double
chair lifts transport customers up
and down the mountain, and skiers
have 45 runs to choose from, even
ly distributed for skiers of all abili
ties.

This summer, Sugar Bowl
kicked off its seven-year, $24 mil
lion upgrade and expansion.
Mount Judah, a new addition to
Sugar Bowl's four other peaks, in
creases the trail count to 58.
With 1,110 skiable acres, a ver
tical drop of 1,500 feet and an up
hill capacity of 11,300 skiers per
hour, Sugar Bowl scarcely needs
the upgrade. Experienced skiers
will enjoy Sugar Bowl the most, as
45 percent of the trails boast a
black diamond rating. Only 15 per
cent receive the easier green circle.
The advanced skier will find the
$37 price tag easier to swallow, al
though Sugar Bowl is open only
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sugar Bowl
claims to be the easiest resort to ac
cess from the Bay Area, and is lo
cated off the Soda Springs exit of I
-80.
Nordic skiing buffs may flock to
Royal Gorge, which specializes in
cross-country. A $20 bill grants ac
cess to North America's most
scenic and extensive network of
cross-country trails — 88, to be
exact, including 9,172 acres and 10
warming huts.
Beginners also will take delight
in the 28 novice trails, and average
skiers have 44 options. Routes vary
in length and extend as long as 22
kilometers for the Interconnect
Trail.
Royal Gorge is also located on
the Donner Summit and, like
Sugar Bowl, is off the Soda Springs
exit on 1-80.
West Lake Tahoe
Homewood and Alpine Mead
ows stand alone among major re
sorts on Tahoe's West Side.
Though only five miles south of
Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows
often is significantly warmer.
Homewood is found slightly fur
ther south and offers breathtaking
scenery.
Alpine Meadows, with a $43 all
day price tag, guarantees a calmer
environment than nearby Squaw.
Though offering only 2,000 acres,
the trails cater to skiers of every
level, especially intermediates. A
total of 11 lifts, including two ex
press quads, transport skiers over
the 1,600 foot vertical span.
Homewood offers fewer acres
(1,260), a similar vertical drop and
only a $32 cost. For those wishing
to take a friend skiing over vaca
tion, Homewood's "two-for-one"
Wednesdays will ease the financial
burden.
Snowboarders will enjoy the
focus on their activity at Home
wood. They are granted access to
all slopes and can select either gen
tle runs or expert trails.
Those who would rather stick to
skiing have a vast array of 57 trails
to whet their appetite. Beginners
will be better of elsewhere, with
only five routes available. Howev
er, the skiing veteran will find the
wide selection appealing.
South Lake Tahoe
The south side of the lake, while
not as cluttered as the north, offers
additional high-quality resorts.


Curtis Song — Daily
Peering over the side of a dangerous-looking cliff, skiers should use
caution on such terrain.
The largest spot, Heavenly, lies in
both California and Nevada.
As its name implies, Heavenly
rivals Squaw Valley with its deluxe
facilities. With a peak elevation of
just over 10,000 feet and a 3,500
foot vertical drop, Heavenly's
breathtaking views are just one of
its advantages.
Sixteen chairlifts move skiers
from the parking lot to the summit.
Once there, skiers find a massive
4,800 acres of terrain to sample.
Novices can tackle the fundamen
tals on 20 percent of the runs,
while 35 percent are designated
with black diamonds.
This skiers' paradise is a direct
trip along Highway 50 from Sacra
mento, and $42 allows skiers to
enter the Heavenly kingdom.
Intermediate skiers can also
partake in Sierra-at-Tahoe's 22
routes for their level. The other
half of Sierra's trails are evenly di
vided between the other two abili
ties.
With 2,000 acres and a drop of
2,212 feet, Sierra-at-Tahoe calls it
self the third-largest resort in
Tahoe. For $37 a day and a 83-mile
trek down Highway 50 from Sacra
mento, skiers can absorb its at
tractive alpine environment.
Kirkwood has the best cross
country trails of any place south of
Tahoe. With 80 kilometers of
groomed track and a focus on inter
mediate routes (60 percent), the
$14 price of admission provides a
full day of action.

For alpine skiers, Kirkwood of
fers over 60 trails, 2,300 acres of
terrain and a 2,000 foot drop. Rates
are also reasonable — $40 for the
day but $10 less for those 13-24
years of age.
Central Sierra
Moving away from Lake Tahoe
up north, Mt. Shasta is an easy 250
mile drive north of San Francisco.
Further, most of the driving is easy
along Interstate 5, and the park lies
just 10 miles east of 1-5 via High
way 89.
One of the tallest peaks in the
contiguous U.S. at 14,162 feet, Mt.
Shasta's scenery is second to none.
From Wednesday to Saturday
nights, skiers can fly down the
lighted slopes. A full day's skiing
costs $32 (9 a.m. to 10 p.m.), but
the night-only package is $17 (4-10
p.m.) and the day package costs
$26.
Cross-country skiing is also
available, on a scaled-down basis.
Only 25 kilometers of power-tilled
track are available, but the price,
$8, is unbeatable.
Affordable prices make Bear
Valley, two hours northeast of
Stockton along Highway 4, a vi
able alternative to Tahoe for
some. For a low $28, Bear Valley's
1,280 acres allow every skier
ample opportunity to find an ap
propriate course. The upper
slopes are suitable for those look
ing to get their feet wet, and the
steeper lower portion of the hill

will stimulate the skiing stud.
For $14, cross-country skiing,
especially for rookies, rivals that in
North Tahoe. Only 7 of the 32
trails are black diamonds, includ
ing the 1.5 kilometer Grin and
Bear It, called "the most difficult
and challenging trail in the West."
Eastern Sierra
Mammoth, a huge ski resort in
the Inyo Forest, provides enter
tainment prior to skiing — the
scenic drive. Take either Interstate
580 to Highway 120 or 1-80 to
Highway 50, which will join with
Highway 395. Going south will
lead to the Mammoth Lakes
tumoff, Highway 203.
After the lengthy drive, 31
lifts will ensure that transporta
tion is no longer a chore. Mam
moth Mountain lives up to its
title, with a 3,100 foot vertical
drop, 3,500 skiable acres and a
whopping 150 trails. The world's
largest snowcat fleet also grooms
more acreage than any ski area in
the nation. Unfortunately, all of
Mammoth's amenities come with
a mammoth price tag — at least
$40 a head.
For the alpine and cross-coun
try buff alike, skiers of all levels of
talent should have little difficulty
finding a satisfying resort. With
skiing options scattered through
out a wide area, Californians can
find fun in the snow as well as fun
in the sun.

Snowboarders can find plenty of opportunities to carve up the slopes on the north, west and south sides
of Lake Tahoe.

Winter sports enthusiasts can reach ideal skiing and snowboarding destinations just hours from campus

California. The Golden State.
The land of sandy beaches and
ocean breezes. A destination
known for its guaranteed temper
ate climate, palm trees and ... its
amazing skiing?
When most people think of the
country's best skiing they think of
states such as Colorado, Utah and
Washington. But right here in Cal
ifornia, in Stanford's own back
yard in fact, are found some of the
finest skiing and winter recreation
resorts on the West Coast and, ar
guably, the country. Skiing, cross

country skiing and snowboarding
opportunities abound as slopes
suited for any skill-level or "guts"
level of winter adventurer can be
reached after a three to five-hour
car ride from campus.
For years, Lake Tahoe has
proven the most popular destina
tion of Stanford students heading
to the mountains, whether on a Fi
nals blow-off fling with their
friends or on that infamous dorm
ski trip. Boasting such mega-re
sorts as Squaw Valley, Northstar
and Heavenly as well as many
smaller, less crowded areas, Tahoe
serves as Northern California's
snow haven.

chased. The base, at 6,200 feet, is
the origin of Squaw's chair lift sys
tem which encompasses 32 lifts, in
cluding a Super Gondola which
sweeps skiers up to its 8,200 foot
drop-off point.
Squaw truly offers terrain for
everyone from the first-timer to
the hotshot who was born with skis
pre-attached. One quarter of the
runs are devoted to beginners as
wide-open, gently sloping hills
make it a good place to learn the ba
sics of skiing or snowboarding.
Since the easiest slopes at Squaw
are not clustered at the bottom of
the mountain but can also be found
close to the top, the views provide
learners with an added perk.
Forty-five percent of Squaw is
designated as "blue-square" skiing
for those of intermediate ability
while the remaining 30 percent is
only for the experienced, or the
particularly adventurous. Those
looking for the ultimate, "extreme
skiing" experience will likely find it
among Squaw's back-country
runs, both remote and risky.
Squaw's extensive variety and
lush amenities come with a heavier
price tag than many other resorts
— $43 per day. Via Interstate 80,
Squaw Valley USA is 196 miles
from San Francisco, and lies just
two miles off Highway 89.
Although not as elaborate as
Squaw Valley, Northstar pledges
to keep smaller crowds than its
nearby counterpart. By limiting
the amount of tickets sold on popu
lar weekends, the slopes of North
star are never clogged with skiers.

Located just south of Truckee
and east of the Truckee River off
Highway 267, Northstar offers
1,800 acres of slopes and a vertical
drop of 2,200 feet. All-day tickets
sport a $42 price tag, but Northstar
skiers do not have to share the
slopes with as many others.
While not tailored for the dare
devil, Northstar appeals especial
ly to the intermediate skier. Half
the mountain's runs are labeled
with blue squares, and novices
and experts split the remaining
courses.
Although many so-called inter
mediate skiers take a stab at some
of Northstar's difficult slopes, the
Backside Express leads to eight
other runs for die-hards. With ti
tles such as Burn Out and Rapids,
even the consummate adventurer
faces a challenge.
Boreal is located atop Donner
Summit and is also just off Inter
state 80. Stressing a family atmos
phere, Boreal still comes with a $33
per person all-day charge. Howev
er, all-day admission provides 12
hours of skiing from 9 a.m. to 9
p.m.
Boreal offers 36 different runs
for all levels, and the Quicksilver
Quad leads to five south-facing
runs for those seeking a challenge
or a change of pace. Beginners can
purchase a lift ticket, two hour
group lesson and equipment rental
for a total of $40.
Both downhill and cross-coun
try skiers can find suitable slopes
at Tahoe Donner. Intermediate
downhillers choose from four runs
down the Face of Eagle Rock, and
advanced skiers can take either
Skip's Plunge or the Racecourse.
Beginners also can get in the act,
with the Mile Run and the Snow
bird Run.
Cross-country skiers have 33
scenic trails to keep them enter
tained. 4,800 acres and 70 kilome
ters of terrain are available for
only $15 a day, with Saturday
night skiing from 5-8 p.m. also an
option.
Packages are also available for
first-time and early intermediate
skiers, and professional instruc
tors offer 90-minute training ses
sions for reasonable fees.
Tahoe Donner, in Truckee, is
just five miles from Donner State
Park. Take the Northwoods Blvd.
exit off Interstate 80. With all-day
tickets costing only $26, Tahoe
Donner also pleases the pocket
book.
The Donner Ski Ranch, located
outside the congested Lake Tahoe
Basin, is a 175-mile trip east of San
Francisco on 1-80. With 45 runs, a
$20 daily cost (only $10 on most
weekdays) and evening skiing, the
Donner Ski Ranch provides an eco
nomical, scenic alternative to
other, more elaborate resorts.
Portions of the 400 skiable acres
are located in Tahoe National For
est. A triple chair and five double
chair lifts transport customers up
and down the mountain, and skiers
have 45 runs to choose from, even
ly distributed for skiers of all abili
ties.

This summer, Sugar Bowl
kicked off its seven-year, $24 mil
lion upgrade and expansion.
Mount Judah, a new addition to
Sugar Bowl's four other peaks, in
creases the trail count to 58.
With 1,110 skiable acres, a ver
tical drop of 1,500 feet and an up
hill capacity of 11,300 skiers per
hour, Sugar Bowl scarcely needs
the upgrade. Experienced skiers
will enjoy Sugar Bowl the most, as
45 percent of the trails boast a
black diamond rating. Only 15 per
cent receive the easier green circle.
The advanced skier will find the
$37 price tag easier to swallow, al
though Sugar Bowl is open only
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sugar Bowl
claims to be the easiest resort to ac
cess from the Bay Area, and is lo
cated off the Soda Springs exit of I
-80.
Nordic skiing buffs may flock to
Royal Gorge, which specializes in
cross-country. A $20 bill grants ac
cess to North America's most
scenic and extensive network of
cross-country trails — 88, to be
exact, including 9,172 acres and 10
warming huts.
Beginners also will take delight
in the 28 novice trails, and average
skiers have 44 options. Routes vary
in length and extend as long as 22
kilometers for the Interconnect
Trail.
Royal Gorge is also located on
the Donner Summit and, like
Sugar Bowl, is off the Soda Springs
exit on 1-80.
West Lake Tahoe
Homewood and Alpine Mead
ows stand alone among major re
sorts on Tahoe's West Side.
Though only five miles south of
Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows
often is significantly warmer.
Homewood is found slightly fur
ther south and offers breathtaking
scenery.
Alpine Meadows, with a $43 all
day price tag, guarantees a calmer
environment than nearby Squaw.
Though offering only 2,000 acres,
the trails cater to skiers of every
level, especially intermediates. A
total of 11 lifts, including two ex
press quads, transport skiers over
the 1,600 foot vertical span.
Homewood offers fewer acres
(1,260), a similar vertical drop and
only a $32 cost. For those wishing
to take a friend skiing over vaca
tion, Homewood's "two-for-one"
Wednesdays will ease the financial
burden.
Snowboarders will enjoy the
focus on their activity at Home
wood. They are granted access to
all slopes and can select either gen
tle runs or expert trails.
Those who would rather stick to
skiing have a vast array of 57 trails
to whet their appetite. Beginners
will be better of elsewhere, with
only five routes available. Howev
er, the skiing veteran will find the
wide selection appealing.
South Lake Tahoe
The south side of the lake, while
not as cluttered as the north, offers
additional high-quality resorts.


Curtis Song — Daily
Peering over the side of a dangerous-looking cliff, skiers should use
caution on such terrain.
The largest spot, Heavenly, lies in
both California and Nevada.
As its name implies, Heavenly
rivals Squaw Valley with its deluxe
facilities. With a peak elevation of
just over 10,000 feet and a 3,500
foot vertical drop, Heavenly's
breathtaking views are just one of
its advantages.
Sixteen chairlifts move skiers
from the parking lot to the summit.
Once there, skiers find a massive
4,800 acres of terrain to sample.
Novices can tackle the fundamen
tals on 20 percent of the runs,
while 35 percent are designated
with black diamonds.
This skiers' paradise is a direct
trip along Highway 50 from Sacra
mento, and $42 allows skiers to
enter the Heavenly kingdom.
Intermediate skiers can also
partake in Sierra-at-Tahoe's 22
routes for their level. The other
half of Sierra's trails are evenly di
vided between the other two abili
ties.
With 2,000 acres and a drop of
2,212 feet, Sierra-at-Tahoe calls it
self the third-largest resort in
Tahoe. For $37 a day and a 83-mile
trek down Highway 50 from Sacra
mento, skiers can absorb its at
tractive alpine environment.
Kirkwood has the best cross
country trails of any place south of
Tahoe. With 80 kilometers of
groomed track and a focus on inter
mediate routes (60 percent), the
$14 price of admission provides a
full day of action.

For alpine skiers, Kirkwood of
fers over 60 trails, 2,300 acres of
terrain and a 2,000 foot drop. Rates
are also reasonable — $40 for the
day but $10 less for those 13-24
years of age.
Central Sierra
Moving away from Lake Tahoe
up north, Mt. Shasta is an easy 250
mile drive north of San Francisco.
Further, most of the driving is easy
along Interstate 5, and the park lies
just 10 miles east of 1-5 via High
way 89.
One of the tallest peaks in the
contiguous U.S. at 14,162 feet, Mt.
Shasta's scenery is second to none.
From Wednesday to Saturday
nights, skiers can fly down the
lighted slopes. A full day's skiing
costs $32 (9 a.m. to 10 p.m.), but
the night-only package is $17 (4-10
p.m.) and the day package costs
$26.
Cross-country skiing is also
available, on a scaled-down basis.
Only 25 kilometers of power-tilled
track are available, but the price,
$8, is unbeatable.
Affordable prices make Bear
Valley, two hours northeast of
Stockton along Highway 4, a vi
able alternative to Tahoe for
some. For a low $28, Bear Valley's
1,280 acres allow every skier
ample opportunity to find an ap
propriate course. The upper
slopes are suitable for those look
ing to get their feet wet, and the
steeper lower portion of the hill

will stimulate the skiing stud.
For $14, cross-country skiing,
especially for rookies, rivals that in
North Tahoe. Only 7 of the 32
trails are black diamonds, includ
ing the 1.5 kilometer Grin and
Bear It, called "the most difficult
and challenging trail in the West."
Eastern Sierra
Mammoth, a huge ski resort in
the Inyo Forest, provides enter
tainment prior to skiing — the
scenic drive. Take either Interstate
580 to Highway 120 or 1-80 to
Highway 50, which will join with
Highway 395. Going south will
lead to the Mammoth Lakes
tumoff, Highway 203.
After the lengthy drive, 31
lifts will ensure that transporta
tion is no longer a chore. Mam
moth Mountain lives up to its
title, with a 3,100 foot vertical
drop, 3,500 skiable acres and a
whopping 150 trails. The world's
largest snowcat fleet also grooms
more acreage than any ski area in
the nation. Unfortunately, all of
Mammoth's amenities come with
a mammoth price tag — at least
$40 a head.
For the alpine and cross-coun
try buff alike, skiers of all levels of
talent should have little difficulty
finding a satisfying resort. With
skiing options scattered through
out a wide area, Californians can
find fun in the snow as well as fun
in the sun.

Winter sports enthusiasts can reach ideal skiing and snowboarding destinations just hours from campus

California. The Golden State.
The land of sandy beaches and
ocean breezes. A destination
known for its guaranteed temper
ate climate, palm trees and ... its
amazing skiing?
When most people think of the
country's best skiing they think of
states such as Colorado, Utah and
Washington. But right here in Cal
ifornia, in Stanford's own back
yard in fact, are found some of the
finest skiing and winter recreation
resorts on the West Coast and, ar
guably, the country. Skiing, cross

country skiing and snowboarding
opportunities abound as slopes
suited for any skill-level or "guts"
level of winter adventurer can be
reached after a three to five-hour
car ride from campus.
For years, Lake Tahoe has
proven the most popular destina
tion of Stanford students heading
to the mountains, whether on a Fi
nals blow-off fling with their
friends or on that infamous dorm
ski trip. Boasting such mega-re
sorts as Squaw Valley, Northstar
and Heavenly as well as many
smaller, less crowded areas, Tahoe
serves as Northern California's
snow haven.
And while they don't carry the

same name recognition as the
Tahoe resorts, the slopes at Mt.
Shasta, Bear Valley and Mammoth
just add to the acres of possibilities
accessible within a morning's drive
from Stanford, often at a cheaper
price.
No matter how you envision the
ideal ski vacation — anything from
a weekend spent learning to snow
board on the bunny hills to 10 days
of extreme skiing — that outing is
surely possible given the host of
nearby resorts, slopes and trails.
Here's a rundown of the area's
finest:
North Lake Tahoe
Housing the largest number of
ski areas within the smallest geo
graphical area of anywhere in the
Tahoe area, and, perhaps, all of
California, the north side of the
lake is any skier's mecca of oppor
tunity. Its two best known and
most popular destinations are
Squaw Valley USA and Northstar
at-Tahoe, both which combine
world class runs with up-scale ac
commodations, restaurants and
non-skiing recreational opportuni
ties.
Host of the 1960 Winter
Olympic Games, Squaw ranks as
Tahoe's largest skiing operation
with over 4,000 acres of runs span
ning six Sierra peaks. Squaw's base
lodge contains rental shops,
restaurants serving anything from
hamburgers to lattes to sushi and
retail stores where the latest in
cold-weather fashion can be pur
chased. The base, at 6,200 feet, is

two miles off Highway 89.
Although not as elaborate as
Squaw Valley, Northstar pledges
to keep smaller crowds than its
nearby counterpart. By limiting
the amount of tickets sold on popu
lar weekends, the slopes of North
star are never clogged with skiers.

Located just south of Truckee
and east of the Truckee River off
Highway 267, Northstar offers
1,800 acres of slopes and a vertical
drop of 2,200 feet. All-day tickets
sport a $42 price tag, but Northstar
skiers do not have to share the
slopes with as many others.
While not tailored for the dare
devil, Northstar appeals especial
ly to the intermediate skier. Half
the mountain's runs are labeled
with blue squares, and novices
and experts split the remaining
courses.
Although many so-called inter
mediate skiers take a stab at some
of Northstar's difficult slopes, the
Backside Express leads to eight
other runs for die-hards. With ti
tles such as Burn Out and Rapids,
even the consummate adventurer
faces a challenge.
Boreal is located atop Donner
Summit and is also just off Inter
state 80. Stressing a family atmos
phere, Boreal still comes with a $33
per person all-day charge. Howev
er, all-day admission provides 12
hours of skiing from 9 a.m. to 9
p.m.
Boreal offers 36 different runs
for all levels, and the Quicksilver
Quad leads to five south-facing
runs for those seeking a challenge
or a change of pace. Beginners can
purchase a lift ticket, two hour
group lesson and equipment rental
for a total of $40.
Both downhill and cross-coun
try skiers can find suitable slopes
at Tahoe Donner. Intermediate
downhillers choose from four runs
down the Face of Eagle Rock, and
advanced skiers can take either
Skip's Plunge or the Racecourse.
Beginners also can get in the act,
with the Mile Run and the Snow
bird Run.
Cross-country skiers have 33
scenic trails to keep them enter
tained. 4,800 acres and 70 kilome
ters of terrain are available for
only $15 a day, with Saturday
night skiing from 5-8 p.m. also an
option.
Packages are also available for
first-time and early intermediate
skiers, and professional instruc
tors offer 90-minute training ses
sions for reasonable fees.
Tahoe Donner, in Truckee, is
just five miles from Donner State
Park. Take the Northwoods Blvd.
exit off Interstate 80. With all-day
tickets costing only $26, Tahoe
Donner also pleases the pocket
book.
The Donner Ski Ranch, located
outside the congested Lake Tahoe
Basin, is a 175-mile trip east of San
Francisco on 1-80. With 45 runs, a
$20 daily cost (only $10 on most
weekdays) and evening skiing, the
Donner Ski Ranch provides an eco
nomical, scenic alternative to
other, more elaborate resorts.
Portions of the 400 skiable acres
are located in Tahoe National For
est. A triple chair and five double
chair lifts transport customers up
and down the mountain, and skiers
have 45 runs to choose from, even
ly distributed for skiers of all abili
ties.

This summer, Sugar Bowl
kicked off its seven-year, $24 mil
lion upgrade and expansion.
Mount Judah, a new addition to
Sugar Bowl's four other peaks, in
creases the trail count to 58.
With 1,110 skiable acres, a ver
tical drop of 1,500 feet and an up
hill capacity of 11,300 skiers per
hour, Sugar Bowl scarcely needs
the upgrade. Experienced skiers
will enjoy Sugar Bowl the most, as
45 percent of the trails boast a
black diamond rating. Only 15 per
cent receive the easier green circle.
The advanced skier will find the
$37 price tag easier to swallow, al
though Sugar Bowl is open only
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sugar Bowl
claims to be the easiest resort to ac
cess from the Bay Area, and is lo
cated off the Soda Springs exit of I
-80.
Nordic skiing buffs may flock to
Royal Gorge, which specializes in
cross-country. A $20 bill grants ac
cess to North America's most
scenic and extensive network of
cross-country trails — 88, to be
exact, including 9,172 acres and 10
warming huts.
Beginners also will take delight
in the 28 novice trails, and average
skiers have 44 options. Routes vary
in length and extend as long as 22
kilometers for the Interconnect
Trail.
Royal Gorge is also located on
the Donner Summit and, like
Sugar Bowl, is off the Soda Springs
exit on 1-80.
West Lake Tahoe
Homewood and Alpine Mead
ows stand alone among major re
sorts on Tahoe's West Side.
Though only five miles south of
Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows
often is significantly warmer.
Homewood is found slightly fur
ther south and offers breathtaking
scenery.
Alpine Meadows, with a $43 all
day price tag, guarantees a calmer
environment than nearby Squaw.
Though offering only 2,000 acres,
the trails cater to skiers of every
level, especially intermediates. A
total of 11 lifts, including two ex
press quads, transport skiers over
the 1,600 foot vertical span.
Homewood offers fewer acres
(1,260), a similar vertical drop and
only a $32 cost. For those wishing
to take a friend skiing over vaca
tion, Homewood's "two-for-one"
Wednesdays will ease the financial
burden.
Snowboarders will enjoy the
focus on their activity at Home
wood. They are granted access to
all slopes and can select either gen
tle runs or expert trails.
Those who would rather stick to
skiing have a vast array of 57 trails
to whet their appetite. Beginners
will be better of elsewhere, with
only five routes available. Howev
er, the skiing veteran will find the
wide selection appealing.
South Lake Tahoe
The south side of the lake, while
not as cluttered as the north, offers
additional high-quality resorts.

Peering over the side of a dangerous-looking cliff, skiers should use
caution on such terrain.
The largest spot, Heavenly, lies in
both California and Nevada.
As its name implies, Heavenly
rivals Squaw Valley with its deluxe
facilities. With a peak elevation of
just over 10,000 feet and a 3,500
foot vertical drop, Heavenly's
breathtaking views are just one of
its advantages.
Sixteen chairlifts move skiers
from the parking lot to the summit.
Once there, skiers find a massive
4,800 acres of terrain to sample.
Novices can tackle the fundamen
tals on 20 percent of the runs,
while 35 percent are designated
with black diamonds.
This skiers' paradise is a direct
trip along Highway 50 from Sacra
mento, and $42 allows skiers to
enter the Heavenly kingdom.
Intermediate skiers can also
partake in Sierra-at-Tahoe's 22
routes for their level. The other
half of Sierra's trails are evenly di
vided between the other two abili
ties.
With 2,000 acres and a drop of
2,212 feet, Sierra-at-Tahoe calls it
self the third-largest resort in
Tahoe. For $37 a day and a 83-mile
trek down Highway 50 from Sacra
mento, skiers can absorb its at
tractive alpine environment.
Kirkwood has the best cross
country trails of any place south of
Tahoe. With 80 kilometers of
groomed track and a focus on inter
mediate routes (60 percent), the
$14 price of admission provides a
full day of action.

For alpine skiers, Kirkwood of
fers over 60 trails, 2,300 acres of
terrain and a 2,000 foot drop. Rates
are also reasonable — $40 for the
day but $10 less for those 13-24
years of age.
Central Sierra
Moving away from Lake Tahoe
up north, Mt. Shasta is an easy 250
mile drive north of San Francisco.
Further, most of the driving is easy
along Interstate 5, and the park lies
just 10 miles east of 1-5 via High
way 89.
One of the tallest peaks in the
contiguous U.S. at 14,162 feet, Mt.
Shasta's scenery is second to none.
From Wednesday to Saturday
nights, skiers can fly down the
lighted slopes. A full day's skiing
costs $32 (9 a.m. to 10 p.m.), but
the night-only package is $17 (4-10
p.m.) and the day package costs
$26.
Cross-country skiing is also
available, on a scaled-down basis.
Only 25 kilometers of power-tilled
track are available, but the price,
$8, is unbeatable.
Affordable prices make Bear
Valley, two hours northeast of
Stockton along Highway 4, a vi
able alternative to Tahoe for
some. For a low $28, Bear Valley's
1,280 acres allow every skier
ample opportunity to find an ap
propriate course. The upper
slopes are suitable for those look
ing to get their feet wet, and the
steeper lower portion of the hill

will stimulate the skiing stud.
For $14, cross-country skiing,
especially for rookies, rivals that in
North Tahoe. Only 7 of the 32
trails are black diamonds, includ
ing the 1.5 kilometer Grin and
Bear It, called "the most difficult
and challenging trail in the West."
Eastern Sierra
Mammoth, a huge ski resort in
the Inyo Forest, provides enter
tainment prior to skiing — the
scenic drive. Take either Interstate
580 to Highway 120 or 1-80 to
Highway 50, which will join with
Highway 395. Going south will
lead to the Mammoth Lakes
tumoff, Highway 203.
After the lengthy drive, 31
lifts will ensure that transporta
tion is no longer a chore. Mam
moth Mountain lives up to its
title, with a 3,100 foot vertical
drop, 3,500 skiable acres and a
whopping 150 trails. The world's
largest snowcat fleet also grooms
more acreage than any ski area in
the nation. Unfortunately, all of
Mammoth's amenities come with
a mammoth price tag — at least
$40 a head.
For the alpine and cross-coun
try buff alike, skiers of all levels of
talent should have little difficulty
finding a satisfying resort. With
skiing options scattered through
out a wide area, Californians can
find fun in the snow as well as fun
in the sun.

Snowboarders can find plenty of opportunities to carve up the slopes on the north, west and south sides
of Lake Tahoe.
