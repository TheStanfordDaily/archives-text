# Time selects Rice as a 'promising leader'
## 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
At 40, Provost Condoleezza
Rice just barely made the age cut
off for Time magazine's recent
roster of "America's most promis
ing leaders age 40 and under."
Of course, her accomplish
ments — which include being
Stanford's provost as well as a for
mer member of the National Secu
rity Council — also made a differ
ence, landing her a space among
national names like John F.
Kennedy, Jr. and Microsoft co
founder Bill Gates.
"I'm a little surprised," Rice said
about being named. "When Time
called, I assumed they were inter
viewing hundreds of people.... I

don't know what criteria they used."
For its Dec. 5 issue, Time se
lected 50 men and women, aged 40
and under, from across the coun
try who the magazine felt had "the
requisite ambition, vision and
community spirit to help guide us
in the new millennium."
Time first printed a list of
young leaders in 1974 and then
again in 1979. According to this
year's article, the magazine used
the "1979 standard of 'civic and
social impact' " in selecting the 50
leaders, whose selection was "in
tended to be representative rather
than inclusive."
The magazine also mentioned
that "the cutoff age of 40 repre
sents an attempt to balance
accomplishment with future
promise."
Rice is the youngest, the first
black and the first female provost
at Stanford, a fact which the mag
azine cited in its description of her.
The provost position, Time added,
is a position "widely regarded as a
stepping-stone to the presidency
of a major American university."
Rice started her duties as
provost last fall, and in her first

year, sliced $6 million from the
University's budget. She has been
at Stanford for 14 years and also
served as a top aide to President
Bush's National Security Council
during the fall of the Soviet Union
and other communist countries.
Rice said she was flattered by
her selection, but was skeptical
about the magazine's ability to
predict future leaders. "Who
knows what any of us will be
doing in 30 years?"
Others picked as the nation's
future leaders include Stanford
alumnus and Yale Law Prof.
Stephen Carter — who spoke at
last year's commencement cere

monies — and talk-show host
Oprah Winfrey.
"It's a pretty illustrious group,"
Rice said, adding that the people
selected were "eclectic" and came
from many different fields.
Rice said she especially was
happy that economist Jeffrey
Sachs was also selected.
"I knew Jeff Sachs personally
and worked with him on the Pol
ish economy," Rice said. "I'm
glad to see he was recognized for
his accomplishments."
Previous young leaders select
ed by Time in 1974 and 1979 were
President Bill Clinton and news
anchor Dan Rather.
