# Ski club combines racing and fun
## Members head to Tahoe on weekends for serious (and social) skiing 
### John Fabian 
Whether you're talking about the competi
tive racing team or the recreational ski bums,
the Stanford Ski Club is where it's at.
Taking to Roble Field every Tuesday and
Thursday for dry training during the fall,
members will be more than ready to hit the
slopes this winter. While maintaining its com
petitiveness with thorough training and seri
ous ski racers, a club atmosphere is also felt
due to the presence of many intermediate
skiers who join the group just to ski and have a
good time.
The competitive racing team

forms the core of the group

that prac
tices dur
ing the
fall in

prepa
ration
for

the winter racing schedule. The ski team com
petes at Lake Tahoe against about eight other
schools over a period of six weekends. The team
is coached by former U.S. ski team member,
Cliff Wheatley, who lives in Tahoe. Wheatley
helps direct the Christmas Camp, which will be
held from December 27th to January Bth. Here
the team completes its training and holds time
trials to determine who will qualify to be on the
actual racing team, which consists of seven
men and seven women.
The ski club in total provides much more of
a social atmosphere. While 300 people signed
up for information, about 50 members will end
up paying and become official members. The

dues, along with money the team makes during
stadium cleanup, helps to pay for the social fee

and the cabin that
they rent from
December until

March.
While the ski
team members

travel up to
Tahoe every
weekend, and

have
their lift
tickets
paid for

through racing, the club members range from
hardcore skiers who will take a trip up to Tahoe
during the middle of the week because there's
been a good snow, to much more laid back
skiers who join the club more than anything for
the social benefits.
These social perks are comprised of numer
ous parties at the cabin during the winter as
well as barhopping in Tahoe. The club is plan
ning social functions to get the clubmembers
acquainted, and will hold a big party at the
cabin on New Year's Eve during the Christmas
training camp.
According to team captain Doug McDonald,
Tahoe is a much better college town than Palo
Alto and its environs because there are a lot of
college-aged people, who are much more wel
come in the bars and restaurants there than
they are around campus.
McDonald described Tahoe as basically "ski
bu ms and hot tubs." This certainly must sound
appealing to those of us Stanford students who
find ourselves cramped up on campus through
out most of the year.
The slopes of Tahoe provide a great escape
from the suffocation of campus to all the mem
bers of the ski club, whether it's they are the
ones who travel there for the competition, or
the clubmembers who enjoy getting off campus
and relaxing on the slopes.
McDonald says it helps him to get a "clear
perspective." Certainly the small town atmos
phere of Tahoe provides a nice contrast to the
Palo Alto surroundings. Maybe we should all
wonder why we're not up there with them, es
caping campus and enjoying the slopes.
