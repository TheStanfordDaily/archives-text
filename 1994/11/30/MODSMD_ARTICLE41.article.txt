# Skinny skis? Collapsible poles?
## Manufacturers cater technology to skiers' needs 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
Every day you learn something new,
or so the ski equipment manufactures
currently say.
Many of the innovations in this sea
son's ski gear were designed in response
to the demands of skiers. The trends in
the past few years have led to shorter
and thinner skis which were intended to
be more responsive and help new skiers
learn quickly. While the skies did serve
this purpose, people complained that the
smaller styles have caused them to lose
their directional ability and thus, the
manufacturers are evolving to meet
their desires.
"Most companies are now coming out
with a mid-length ski, or already have
one," said Brian Heikemen, an employee
at Pacific Mountaineer, an outdoor
sporting goods store in Palo Alto.
He also stated that the various differ
ences in performance between the two
types of skis is mainly brought about by
the added length.
"Fisher and Rossignol are going to
the mid length skis," said Heikemen.
"They're around 160 to 175 centimeters
in length, while the smaller skis are 127
centimeters long. They are more stable
and provide better directional ability . ..
while they are also easier to ski on than
traditional skis."
Other changes in ski equipment in
clude the marketing of wide-bodied skis

which are similar to those used in Alpine
skiing. Technological advances are not
limited to skis, however. The manufac
turer Leki designed and now produces a
collapsible ski pole.

'[Mid-length skis] are
more stable and pro
vide better directional
ability... while they
are also easier to ski
on than traditional
skis.'

Mike, a sales representative at The
North Face, advocates the new poles
which are around one foot in length
when folded.
"They're good for me because I'm a
snowboarder," he said. "I can fold them
and tie them to my backpack. In case I
fall down, then I can reach back and use
them to propel myself back up.
"You loosen the screws and they col
lapse to about one foot," Mike added.
A major innovation has also occurred
in the high end boots line, which, unfor
tunately, are a tad bit expensive for the

average underpaid college reporter.
"Salomon came out with the 9.1 skate
boot or more accurately, the 9.1 Race
Skate," Heikemen said. "They're replac
ing the 9.11. The changes are a step up in
the hinge system in the boot."
The new boots use that hinge system
to reduce the amount of effort that a
skier uses in each movement.
"The boots helps to position the foot,"
Heikemen said. "This makes it easier to
retrieve the skis at the end of each stride
which in turn reduces the energy ex
pended."
Minor improvements in other boots
include upgrades to the Black Diamond
Terminator and Terminator II styles.
These boots now accommodate sizes bet
ter and are also more flexible. Many
skiers complained that it was difficult to
find boot models in the right size and
that boots also tended to be somewhat
stiff.
If you have some money left over
from those loan checks you don't intend
to pay off, if you've found an incredibly
well-payingjob, or if you're a normal col
lege student whose last name just hap
pens to be Rockefeller, you owe it to
yourself to check out the new equip
ment.
Even if you don't fit into the above
criteria or have never skied before, take
a look at the new skis, memorize the
specifications, and pretend to your ski
ing buddies that you know more than
they do.
