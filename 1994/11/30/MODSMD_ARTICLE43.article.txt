# How to plan (and survive) the dorm ski trip
## From poker chips to cheap vittles, the nuts and bolts of enjoying a blissful mountain holiday

So, it happened to you: you didn't attend your last
house meeting and the dorm — in a rousing vote of
confidence and lazy delegation — chose you to plan
the house ski trip.
Even if you aren't the lucky citizen entrusted
with fulfilling the dorm's winter wonderland
dreams, the prospect of a trip planned and executed
by those guys on the third floor (who can't even plan
a trip to Safeway to buy their own shampoo) may
leave you a bit skeptical.
But planning and attending a dorm ski trip can be
one of your best Stanford experiences if a few simple
guidelines are followed.
Dorm snow job
The first (and perhaps most difficult) job a ski trip
planner needs to get started on immediately is to
gauge dorm interest. As always, many people think
the idea of a weekend in the snow sounds great ini
tially, but — as the date gets closer — a healthy per
centage of those gung ho supporters will flake.
The tricky part is anticipating how many will
drop out, while planning for an adequate number of
participants. Idle threats (like nonexistent dead
lines and ruthless money collection) can be extreme
ly helpful in keeping the flakes to a minimum.
Now it's time to research available accommoda
tions and dates. Balancing these two with dorm in
terest can also be tricky; it's helpful to come up with
several possibilities to present to the always finicky
dorm. It helps to ask what residents have done in
past years.
Your best bet is probably a condominium in the

Tahoe area (which includes
dozens of individual hills). Travel
or reservation agents are happy to
help supply lists of possible con
dos.
A hint: most groups don't ex
actly use a 1:1 occupancy ratio
when correlating available condos
with interested people. Fitting
somewhere closer to 32 or 48 peo
ple in your 16-person condo is
more the norm and contributes to
Res Ed's bonding goals nicely.
So after a typically contentious
debate, your group has settled on a
date and lodging. Now's your
chance to schmooze with the dorm
treasurer and talk finance. Draft
an accurate budget which includes
not only lodging and food, but also
transportation (don't forget about
tire chains), and any deposits,
taxes or surcharges.
Resist the temptation to cut
corners; things have a way of cost
ing more than even your highest
estimate. Legitimate ways to cut
down the cost include dorm subsi
dies, and working with Food Ser
vice for supplies. Also, when
you're selling the trip to the dorm,
make it clear that the price does
not include ski tickets or equip
ment rentals.
Long before the great day ap
proaches, start collecting money
from residents and figuring out
who can (or will) drive. To avoid

confusion, have people assign
themselves to cars so that they can
leave when and with whom they
choose to travel. Before people
choose departure times, make it
clear that rooms and beds are re
served on a "first come, first
serve" basis — you might want to
establish guidelines for reserving
beds for late-comers.
One final note: don't forget to
plan for clean-up early in the
weekend. Make it clear that no one
should leave before clean-up is fin
ished, or at least well underway.
With those dorm penny-pinchers,
it always helps to point out that
any damage charges will be as
sessed to the dorm.
Packing and preparing
Even if your dorm planners fol
low these rules perfectly, packing
and preparing for the trip can
make all the difference for partici
pants. First and foremost, pay at
tention to your planners' instruc
tions, and make sure you under
stand all the relevant information
before heading for the hills.
Don't overpack, but at the same
time remember that the tempera
ture in the mountains during Jan
uary and February is bound to
hover around freezing. Even if you
don't plan to ski, wool sweaters,
fleece garments, long underwear
and plenty of warm, dry socks and
underwear are a must. Also, think
about foot gear for wandering
about in the snow.
Because you probably won't be
one of the lucky people to get one

of four beds in your cabin, it is im
portant to bring a warm sleeping
bag. If you can't find one, the
Tresidder Recreation Center
rents outdoor gear to interested
students for reasonable rates.
Bring plenty of money for ski
tickets and snacks — even if you
brought plenty of food from cam
pus, a fleet of hungry skiers can
deplete the supply almost instant
ly-
Remember that many condos
in Tahoe are reasonably close to
gambling facilities, so you may be
tempted to try your luck on the ta
bles. Everyone is pretty much free
to gamble, but only those 21 or
older are allowed to win; casinos
seem to start carding once you
start winning. Also, casinos can
mean abundant, cheap food and
drinks.
If gambling isn't your taste,
you might want to provide for
your own nighttime entertain
ment. If dormcest isn't your taste,
cards, books and games can pro
vide something of a substitute on
those cold winter nights.
Don't plan to get a whole lot of
studying done or catch up on
sleep; you'll have a better time if
you resign yourself to a wasted
weekend.
Finally, no dorm ski trip has
ever come off perfectly — that's
part of the fun. So when you spend
two days eating kippered snacks,
blow your dorm funds on damage
deposits and get three dorm mem
bers arrested, just think of the
memories you're building.
