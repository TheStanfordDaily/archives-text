# Traditional Christians seek safe havens
## Feel isolation in the predominantly secular Stanford atmosphere 
### Emily Bazar Karen Heywood Staff writers 
Editor's Note: This is the third in a series of three
articles discussing the experiences of students
with conservative religious beliefs at Stanford.

Like Jesus' proverbial "sheep among
wolves," many of Stanford's more traditional
Christians feel isolated from the campus's pre
dominantly secular, liberal leanings.
As a result, many Christians feel the need to
seek outlets for worship and support on a large
ly unsympathetic campus.
For junior Aaron Thomas, Baptist Student

Ministries offers him a safe-haven in a commu
nity which questions — both socially and intel
lectually — his most heartfelt, personal beliefs.
"Stanford tends to deny the need for a God, or
that there is one, in things like Cultures, Ideas
and Values and in general," he said. "I was shak
en when I first came here.. .because I have need
ed help and guidance."
His initial exposure to other students coupled
with experiences in CIV led Thomas to believe
the general consensus among students is to dis
count the power of God.
"When we were reading the Bible in class,
some people implied that it was kind of silly to de-

pend on a God rather than depend
ing on themselves," he said.
This phenomenon led Thomas
to think of the Stanford communi
ty — one in which people tend to
rely upon themselves more than on
any spiritual power — as "in a way
arrogant and selfish."
Thomas said he believes the
campus' secular mindset conflicts
with some of his other religious
beliefs concerning subjects such as
premarital sex and homosexuality.
When leaders of some campus
ministries recently came out in
support of homosexuality, Thomas
said he was "rather disappointed."
Thomas said he does not con
done homosexuality. He added that
he felt the leaders were "giving in
in a way. . .that they're just trying
to appease the homosexuals."
In such an atmosphere, where
traditional religious beliefs are con
stantly challenged, Thomas said he
turns to the BSM for support.
"BSM concentrates on relation
ships," he said. "First and primari
ly with God, second with each other

and third to branch out into the
Stanford campus; to let others
know you're Christian by how you
live your life."
While Thomas admits he has
experienced some taunting by dor
m mates and peers because of his
faith, he said the campus's attitude
is often more one of teasing than
true negativity.
"People aren't harsh, they just
don't want to hear that God wants
a personal relationship with them,"
he said.
Although junior Cherie
Courseault said she feels Stanford
is generally "humanistic, even in
religion," she said she finds it hard
to come home to her residence to
"anti-religion fliers, vulgar music,
etc."
She said that personal faith as
well as her membership in Stan
ford's ReJOYce in Jesus Campus
Fellowship helps "renew my
mind."
Courseault, a two-year member
of ReJOYce, said she looks to her
group for its emphasis on "meeting
the needs of students with a gospel
focus on student life."
For example, she said, the group
offers "weekend alternatives" to
secular parties every other week

end, including Christian-oriented
games and music.
Thomas echoed the sentiment
that Stanford's social life — which
he said consists of parties where
"all you can do is drink and dance"
— is more restrictive than any reli
gious beliefs that may prevent him
from taking part in the campus'
social scene.
Consequently, he prefers social
izing with his friends, either
ing out or going to the movies."
For many traditional Chris
tians, evangelical efforts to spread
the Gospel and educate other mem
bers of the community have met
with indifference.
"It's hard because people on the
campus have very diverse beliefs,"
said senior Jennifer Brooks, a
member of BSM.
She said "efforts to help other
people know the same love and sal
vation" she knows is hampered by
the campus's emphasis on multi
culturalism and diversity of beliefs.
She said ultimately, students
tend to treat Christianity as "just
another of those beliefs we have to
accept... it's difficult getting peo
ple to hear and apply these beliefs
in the sense of examining their own
lives."
