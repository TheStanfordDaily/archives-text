Because of his attorney's absence, for
mer student Todd Laßocca's sentencing
in the "Gay Liberation" sculpture van
dalism case was postponed yesterday
morning.
Attorney Thomas Orvis, speaking for
Laßocca's lawyer Tony Giacalone, asked
Santa Clara County Superior Court
Judge Diana Northway for a continuance
because Giacalone was involved in a trial
in another court.
Northway granted the continuance
and scheduled a new hearing for Dec. 6.

At his preliminary hearing on Sept. 29,
when Laßocca pled "no contest" to the
charges of felony vandalism, the presid
ing judge, Rise Jones Pichon of the Palo
Alto Municipal Court, advised Laßocca of
his probable sentence.
Pichon said Laßocca's sentence would
likely entail graffiti clean-up, 100 hours
of community service and up to one year
of probation. Laßocca may also be re
quired to attend educational classes, pay
between $200 and $10,000 in fines and
perhaps be liable for losses due to the
damage.
This sentence would be in lieu of
Laßocca's serving time in prison. The

maximum punishment for a felony van
dalism charge is five years of probation or
three years jail time.
Laßocca is one of the six defendants
accused of vandalizing George Segal's
"Gay Liberation" sculpture last May.
He and senior Thomas Irwin were
charged with felonies, while the remain
ing four — senior Mark Butterfield, ju
nior Robert Gardner, junior Jason
White and former student Brian Dal
limore — were charged with misde
meanors.
Those four pleaded "no contest" to
their charges and were sentenced last
Wednesday.
