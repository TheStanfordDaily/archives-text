# 'Service learning' sets some classes apart
## 
### Sonny Harpavat 
While some freshmen dread writingyet
another academic essay, freshman
Heather Varughese is excited about her
English paper. She is planning, writing
and publishing a volunteer handbook for
"Families In Transition," an organization
helping single-moms in East Palo Alto.
Yet, Varughese's project doesn't follow

the lines of traditional volunteer activity.
Instead, it is product of "Community Ser
vice Writing," an option in freshman writ
ing classes.
This effort by the University to inte
grate volunteerism and academics reflects
a growing trend of service-based learning
on college campuses around the nation.
Anne Colby — visiting faculty fellow at
the Haas Center for Public Service and au

thor of three books including "Some Do
Care: Contemporary Lives of Moral Com
mitment"— attributes the trend to broad
er social problems.
"It comes from a national movement to
engage people in social problems of pover
ty, racism and environmental issues,"
Colby said. "Along the course of educa-
tion, then, people are gaining a
sense of personal responsibility."
Stanford played its part in
spreading this educational trend
through the establishment of the $3
million Haas Center for Public Ser
vice. There, aides in Clearinghouse
room help students pick from more
than 50 classes with curricula
requiring public service.
Dai Pham, a Clearinghouse peer
advisor, helps "put students in
classes or sets them up with profes
sors in individual research pro
jects."
Pham also shows students how
to use a huge database that net
works Stanford to volunteer activi
ties.
Student reaction to these classes
has been positive.
Varughese finds creating the vol
unteer handbook "like writing an
essay but now we're writing for an
agency that will use what we write
for the next 10 years."
She also praises the project for
introducing her to techniques she
never needed before.
"Formatting and creating logos
[for the brochure] are definitely dif
ferent from anything before," she
said.
Varughese also likes doing ser
vice and class work together,
describing it as "convenient."
Past students reflect this same
enthusiasm.
In her freshman writing class,
senior Karen Lin interviewed Stan
ford students about their sexual
behaviors and attitudes for a 30-
page report published by Planned
Parenthood.
She remembers enjoying the
class because it helped her writing
and exposed her to a new facet of
her community.
"There's so much out there
which many of us haven't came into
contact with," Lin said. "The classes
put us right into these environ
ments.
"The class works well because it
works on broadening a lot of our
pre-professional attitudes," she
added, "along with supplying neces
sary person-power for volunteer
projects."
Janet Luce — the Service Learn
ing Coordinator at Haas, who
describes her job as the "broker"
between Stanford classes and the
outside community — thinks the
range of service-learning classes

represents a "diverse spectrum," as
some are more volunteer-intensive
than others.
"There's many courses to choose
from," Luce said, "from the fresh
man 'Community Service Writing*
which uses service to enforce aca
demic writing goals" to "the history
class 'Poverty and the Homeless'
which requires spending 12 hours a
week in a homeless shelter."
Furthermore, Luce sees learning
and service as complementary,
transforming the class into a "field
study."
"We don't want to force the stu
dents to perform service," Luce
said, "but to let them think about
causes and links found academics."
Some opponents accuse service
learning of forcing people to become
volunteers through mandatory
class requirements.
Tim Stanton, director of the
Haas Center acknowledges that "if
it's required it's not voluntary, and
that's what makes the activity spe
cial."
However, Stanton, who will also
be teaching the classes "The Pro
cess and Practice of Community
Service" and "Policy Making and
Problem-Solving at the Local and
Regional Level," said the Haas Cen
ter has an educational mission and
is much more than an organizer.
"The YMCA can do that," he said.
But opponents doubt whether
students enter these public service
classes with the welfare of others in
mind.
Stanton calls the attitudes of stu
dents who take these classes to help
themselves — either through writ
ing or through grades and credits —
"enlightened self-interest."
"After all, the ultimate reason to
make the world better is to make
the world better for yourself," he
said.
Colby sees the controversy in a
different light, pointing to her
research which shows self-interest
ed "goals for entering an activity
often change."
Most students, however, really
see no controversy.
"Most of the students who enroll
do so wanting to volunteer," Lin
said.
Senior Molly Parker — who has
participated in service-learning
courses through the psychology
department — thinks that it is all
right for a student to enroll in a
class expecting something in return.
"There's a fine line between
learning and helping," she com
ments. "The volunteers will learn a
lot while they give their service."
