Office of Student Activities Di
rector Nanci Howe has delayed
implementation of an ASSU Pub
lications Board proposal to reallo
cate office space in Storke Publi
cations Building, claiming juris
diction over the building.
Howe froze the Pub Board's re
distribution of space among cam
pus publications in the Building
in order to give the Stanford
Chaparral time to appeal the deci
sion.
The reallocation bill — which
passed at the Pub Board's Nov. 21
meeting — would have taken two
of the four rooms currently used
by the Chaparral away from the
magazine. One would be used
jointly by the Pub Board and the
Stanford Review, and the second
would be turned into communal
space available to all student pub
lications.
In a letter to Pub Board Direc
tor Danny Bressler, dated Nov.
29, Howe wrote, "I am concerned
that any prompt implementation
of the recent Pub Board decision
to reallocate a portion of the Stan
ford Chaparral space to other
campus publications would not
allow sufficient time for the Stan
ford Chaparral to appeal this deci
sion."
"It's a question of the historical
commitment to the four publications
(the Chaparral, The Daily, the Quad
and the Sequoii\) that helped fund
the building," Howe said later.
