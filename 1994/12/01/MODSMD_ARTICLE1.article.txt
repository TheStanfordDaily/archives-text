# OSA head overrides Pub Board allocations

### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
Office of Student Activities Di
rector Nanci Howe has delayed
implementation of an ASSU Pub
lications Board proposal to reallo
cate office space in Storke Publi
cations Building, claiming juris
diction over the building.
Howe froze the Pub Board's re
distribution of space among cam
pus publications in the Building
in order to give the Stanford
Chaparral time to appeal the deci
sion.
The reallocation bill — which
passed at the Pub Board's Nov. 21
meeting — would have taken two
of the four rooms currently used
by the Chaparral away from the
magazine. One would be used
jointly by the Pub Board and the
Stanford Review, and the second
would be turned into communal
space available to all student pub
lications.
In a letter to Pub Board Direc
tor Danny Bressler, dated Nov.
29, Howe wrote, "I am concerned
that any prompt implementation
of the recent Pub Board decision
to reallocate a portion of the Stan
ford Chaparral space to other
campus publications would not
allow sufficient time for the Stan
ford Chaparral to appeal this deci
sion."
"It's a question of the historical
commitment to the four publications
(the Chaparral, The Daily, the Quad
and the Sequoii\) that helped fund
the building," Howe said later.
Because the Chaparral donat
ed more than $10,000 to the con
struction of the Storke Publica
tions Building and"it has been
in its space for close to 30 years,"
Howe said she felt the magazine
was entitled to time for an
appeal.
"I think that the Chaparral
should have the ability to appeal
any decision of the board,"
Bressler said.
But regardless of a move on
the University's part, "the Cha
parral could have appealed any
way," he said.
The appeal would go before
the ASSU Senate and "if the
senate had enacted a different
allocation, that allocation would
stand," he said.
But Howe said her action will
ensure that the magazine can

appeal before any rearranging of
space is done.
The decision "is the responsi
bility of my office as landlord of
the building," she added.
A few weeks ago, Bressler, a
junior, suspended the Chaparral
on the grounds of disrespect for
both the building and the
authority of the Pub Board.
The Council of Presidents
subsequently submitted a
motion to have Bressler removed
from his post on a charge of bias.
The motion was withdrawn by
the COP before it was presented
to the Senate Appropriations
Committee.
Since Chaparral alumni
protesting the suspension held a
closed meeting with Howe and
other officials, some Pub Board
supporters claim that Chaparral
alumni have been exerting pres
sure on the administration to
override Bressler's decisions.
Although the Pub Board
voted at its Nov. 21 meeting to

sustain the Chaparral's suspen
sion — which took away the
magazine's vote on the Pub
Board — except in relation to
space allocations, Bressler said
he took the Chaparral off sus
pension Tuesday after receiving
a letter from editor Chris Onstad
that he said convinced him that
the magazine would "participate
in good faith."
"I'm happy to hear that Nanci
Howe has decided to stay by her
word to give the Chaparral time
to resolve this issue fairly," said
Chaparral archivist Rudy Del
son, a sophomore.
The ASSU Senate will proba
bly form a committee to look into
both the space allocations and
the Pub Board bylaws, which
some say are the root of the
problems, Onstad said.
Now that the Chaparral's sus
pension has been overturned,
"I'm looking forward to settling
the rest of the matters in a civi
lized way," Onstad said.
