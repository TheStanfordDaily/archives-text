Student threatened on walk
A student who was taking a walk on campus
Monday night was accosted by four teenage
males driving a car on Mayfield Avenue.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
described the car as a light gray four-door
sedan with the body of a late 1980s Toyota
Camry with a white California license plate.
"I have no idea what those kids were up to.
They were trying to intimidate and they were
cruising for trouble," Niemeyer said after
reviewing the police report.
Niemeyer reminded students walking
around campus to "be aware of your sur
roundings."
Immediately after the incident, the student
telephoned the police and filed a report.
The student, who did not wish to be identi
fied, first noticed the group of teenagern driv
ing recklessly. "They ran the stop sign, spun
out, dragging a large pile of debris underneath
the car," he said. "There was a loud, scraping
noise and sparks coming out from beneath
their car."
According to the student, the car continued
following him down Mayfield Ave away from
campus. "I wanted to try to show them that I
wasn't concerned," he said. "But they kept
hanging around. After about 30 seconds I
turned around to head toward campus."
During the exchange the car remained about
two to three feet to the side of the student.
When the student attempted "15 or so
times" to cross Channing Street the car con
tinually blocked his escape attempts. He said

he finally escaped and ran towards campus.
A prank in CIV
Students in Humanities Cultures, Ideas
and Values got a special show on Nov. 18 when
six people pretending to be students and main
tenance workers staged a fight in the middle of
lecture, according to a teaching assistant.
"It was some kind of prank or something,"
said J.B. Shank, a doctoral candidate in history.
Six unidentified males, two pretending to be
a facilities maintenance crew and the other four
moonlighting as students, staged the phony
fight in Cubberley Auditorium, Shank said.
The four "students"straggled into lecture
late and took seats in the crowd. The other two
came in later dressed as a maintenance crew
equipped with flashlights and clipboards as if
prepared to inspect the building, Shank said.
They even went up on stage flashing the
light around, and writing on the clipboard.
At that point, "the professor stops. They
turn around and say they're really sony but
the classroom is full of asbestos and that they
have to move the class," Shank said. Then
those pretending to be students stood up and
told the crews to "get out!"
Then, Shank said, the fake students and
maintenance crew got into a staged argument
and pretended to fight each other
in the side aisle of the auditorium. "After
about 30 seconds, they run out of the room,"
he said.
According to Shank, the crowd wasn't buy
ing it.

"They weren't very good actors," he said.
Thief strikes El Centro
Money was reported stolen Nov. 18 from a
cash can set up for laser printing and photo
copying at El Centro Chicano.
A student who had spent the night at El
Centro heard the burglar making noise, said
Victor Madrigal, one of El Centro's Project
Motivation Coordinators.
"When she heard the noise, she saw him
and confronted him," he said.
According to Madrigal, the thief told the
witness that he needed the money to go home.
Despite the confrontation, the burglar ulti
mately ran off with the cash.
Although police have a description of the
suspect, they admit its "really not much to go
on," said Stanford Police Capt. Marvin Moore.
According to police reports, a 25- to 30-year
old white male perpetrated the crime. Accord
ing to police, the suspect has a medium build
and light brown hair.
"We had the can there for a while and had
no problems before. This guy knew what he
was coming for," Madrigal said.
Although he could not make any definite
estimates on how much money was stolen, he
did say that "it was probably a good amount."
According to Madrigal, many people use the
printing and copying services. At the time of
the robbery, the cash can held about a week's
collection.
