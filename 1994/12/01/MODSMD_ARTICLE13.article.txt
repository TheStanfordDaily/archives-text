## Cruise ship goes down in flames 
### 
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — The Achille
Lauro's history of misfortune ended in
flames yesterday on the Indian Ocean,
where nearly 1,000 passengers and crew
fled in lifeboats as the listing cruise ship
burned.
At least one death was reported. The
ship burned into the night, tilting 40
degrees over to its port side off the coast
of Somalia. The captain of a ship that
went to the rescue said it was in danger of
sinking.
The Achille Lauro gained notoriety
when Palestinian hijackers killed an
American passenger in 1985. But its
troubled past includes the death of an
Italian fisherman whose boat was
rammed in 1971 and two passengers who
drowned trying to escape a 1981 fire.
After fighting the blaze, the last 60
crewmembers abandoned the vessel and
boarded merchant ships helping in the
rescue. The 23,478-ton ship was burning
and listing badly 130 miles south of the

Horn of Africa.
Late yesterday night, Italian Coast
Guard officials said everyone aboard was
accounted for. Eight people were injured
in the fire.
"The whole aft half of the ship is fully
engulfed" by flames, said U.S. Navy Lt.
Paul Frost, who flew over the site in the
afternoon. "Flames have progressed far
forward in the ship."
The ship's owner, Genoa-based Star
lauro, said the blaze apparently broke out
in the passenger area, but the cause was
unknown.
But Dmitrios Skapinkais, the Greek
captain of the Treasure Island, said the
liner's captain, who came aboard to use
his ship's radiotelephone, said the fire
started in the engine room.
By late evening, the liner was listing
40 degrees to port, Skapinkais said.
"I did not see the vessel sinking, but
maybe in the next 12 hours, if any explo
sions come from the fuel tanks ... the

vessel is going to be sinking," he said.
Associated Press reporters who flew
over the ship after nightfall saw it burn
ing, flanked by five other ships. The ship
was initially reported to be 15 miles off
Somalia, but the pilot of the reporters'
plane said it was more than 100 miles off
shore.
The ship was carrying 581 passengers
and 404 crew, said Capt. Ferdinando
Lolli, a port official in Rome. Most of the
crew was Italian, and the passengers
mainly South African, German, Dutch
and British. Ten Americans were on
board — eight crew and a couple that
boarded in Genoa. All were reported safe.
The Panamanian oil ship Hawaiian
King was one of the first ships to arrive at
the scene and took on about 800 people,
said a coast guard official in Rome, Adm.
Eugenio Sicurezza. The Liberian-regis
tered Bar Du was picking up passengers
and would take them to Djibouti, coast
guard officials said.
