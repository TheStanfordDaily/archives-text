Russians to intervene
GROZNY, Russia (AP) - The
streets of Chechnya's capital
were filled with fleeing residents
and the roar of raiding jets yes
terday and neither side in the
republic's civil war gave any sign
of heeding Russia's threat to
intervene.
Russian transport planes were
bringing troops and weapons to
the border of the small, mostly
Muslim republic in the Caucasus
Mountains, the independent
Russian network NTV reported.
They would be in position to
enforce President Boris Yeltsin's
ultimatum for the Chechens to
stop fighting by today or face
Russian intervention.
The fighting pits forces loyal
to Chechen President Dzhokar
Dudayev, who has declared
Chechnya independent from
Russia, against rebels whom

Dudayev says are armed and led
by Moscow.
Stamp prices to increase
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
cost of mailing a letter is going
up after the holidays — from 29
cents to 32.
The independent Postal Rate
Commission approved the
Postal Service request for the
January increase yesterday.
But the commission turned
thumbs down on a plan to raise
nearly all postage rates by the
same percentage — instead set
ting larger increases for mailing
printed matter, advertising and
parcels and holding down the
increase for heavier first-class
items.
The package is expected to
bring the Postal Service $4.7
billion in added income in 1995,
said Rate Commission Chair

man Edward J. Gleiman. The
post office lost $1.3 billion in the
just-completed fiscal year and
$1.7 billion the year before.
