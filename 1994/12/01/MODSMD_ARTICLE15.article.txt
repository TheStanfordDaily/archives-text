# U.N. Secretary-General admits possibility of Bosnian pullout

### 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — Snubbed
by Serbs and unable to arrange a cease-fire, U.N. Sec
retary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said yesterday it
may be time to send peacekeepers home.
Unless the Bosnian Serbs and Muslim-led govern
ment agree to talk peace and cooperate with the Unit
ed Nations, "it will become impossible" to persuade the
Security Council to keep peacekeepers in Bosnia, he
said after a six-hour visit to Sarajevo.
But he said he will not recommend a pullout "for the
time being."
Boutros-Ghali's remarks were the first time he has
threatened a withdrawal. They reflect a growing frus
tration as the Serbs continue their assault on Bihac,
the Muslim-led government refuses new concessions,
U.N. peacekeepers are being held hostage and the
Western alliance is divided about how to respond.
A decision to withdraw the 24,000 peacekeepers
would come from the Security Council, where there is
"absolutely no evidence" of support for a withdrawal,
said Colin Keating, New Zealand's U.N. ambassador.
French U.N. Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee
said "there is no question" of a withdrawal, "but if the
situation continues to deteriorate, it will be more diffi
cult to keep the troops there."

A withdrawal would likely lead to a bloodier conflict
and could draw peacekeepers into battle as both Bosni
an Serbs and government forces rush U.N. camps to
seize equipment before it can be destroyed.
More than 200,000 are dead or missing in the 31-
month conflict launched by Serbs who rebelled against
a Muslim-Croat vote to declare independence from
Serb-led Yugoslavia.
Serbs have rejected a peace plan that would reduce
their holdings in Bosnia to 49 percent from about 70
percent.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic told Boutros-
Ghali that Bosnia would negotiate only if Serbs accept
the plan. He said the government has proposed a three
month cease-fire, but the Serbs want something more
permanent.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic refused even
to meet Boutros-Ghali. The U.N. chief said Karadzic
"has done his people a great disservice."
The Bosnian Serbs wouldn't mind seeing the Unit
ed Nations leave Bosnia, believing it would allow them
to force the government to settle on Serb terms.
Boutros-Ghali's visit followed admissions from top
U.S. and NATO officials that they can't force a solution
to the conflict without a huge ground force.
