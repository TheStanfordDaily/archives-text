Stanford Admit Weekend
won't give students true
taste of life on the Farm

Tampering with tradition
is advisable when long-stand
ing policies have become inef
fective or out of date. But the
Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions' recent announcement that it
has abandoned Prospective Fresh
man Week in favor of a new pro
gram called Stanford Admit Week
end doesn't fit either bill.
Stanford Admit Weekend will
bring Stanford's prospective stu
dents together during a three-day
time period, with the aim of coordi
nating the recruiting process more
effectively. It will also replace the
separate recruiting efforts of the
African-American, Native-Ameri
can and Chicano/Latino communi
ties, so that the respective minority
recruiting programs are conducted
in a uniform manner.
According to Elise Maar, Associ
ate Director of Admissions, the new
program was not motivated by the
goal of increasing Stanford's yield
rate, but rather by the need to
streamline Pro Fro Week and make
it more representative of the Uni
versity's strengths.
The central problem with the
Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions' decision, however, is that
Stanford Admit Weekend will not
provide prospective freshmen with
as useful a picture of the Universi
ty as Pro Fro Week did.
Most students come to Stanford
to receive an education suited to
their needs and expectations. How
ever, Stanford Admit Weekend —
which will begin on a Friday and
end on a Sunday — will not offer
students adequate opportunity to
attend classes and get a realistic
taste of academic life on the Farm.
According to Maar, special
efforts will probably be made to
"recruit faculty members to give

special lectures" on the Friday, so
that students at least get some
sense of what attending a Stanford
class might be like.
But such watered-down experi
ences will be totally insufficient for
forming an opinion on the Stanford
education. The predictable genre of
"special" lecture — a light, user
friendly speech regarding the inno
vative work being done by some
prominent Stanford professor —
will do nothing for students hoping
to make an informed judgment on
the quality of Stanford classes.
Because prospective students
will not be here during the week,
Stanford Admit Weekend will
inevitably be dominated by generic
recruiting events, parties, IMs and
the like. While it is certainly true
that Stanford should put on a
friendly face when the prospective
students arrive, it is equally impor
tant that students get exposure to
the everyday workings of the Uni
versity. Students shouldn't be com
ing to Stanford because they liked
the free beer at a party.
It is ironic that in a time when
concerns about Stanford's yield
rate are making front-page head
lines, the University would elimi
nate a well-established tradition
such as Pro Fro Week and take the
emphasis off what should be Stan
ford's main recruiting resource —
academics. To many, Stanford
already suffers from an image that
it is the least intellectual of the
nation's top schools, and Stanford
Admit Weekend will only exacer
bate this belief.
If the admissions office has prob
lems with Pro Fro W r eek, they
should make the necessary changes
without eliminating its basic struc
ture. If minority groups need to
coordinate divergent recruiting
policies, they should do so within
the present context. If Pro Fro
Week is taxing on the University's
resources, changes should be made
that don't limit prospective stu
dents' academic experience of Stan
ford. Why tamper with a good
thing?
