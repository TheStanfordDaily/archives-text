## And to all a good fight 
### 
THE GRINCH NEVER tried to steal
Hannukah. That used to bother
me. Now I recognize what a bless
ing it is never to have had my holidays
animated.
Could you imagine: Maccabee, The
Animated Series.
But Shell stations handing out copies
of "It's Christmas Time Again Charlie
Brown" is just a symptom of the
blitzkreig commercialism which has
stripped so much of the Christ from
Christmas. The ruining of the religious
holiday of Christmas is a much more
widespread disease, one socially
ingrained and one intent on spoiling as
many cultures as possible.
You don't need to hear it from me.
We've all seen how Christmas commer
cials begin 20 minutes after Uncle Cletus
makes the first incision into the Thanks
giving turkey; how it's infinitely more
about malls, Jingle Bells, bad color
schemes (as if anyone but M&M's looks
good in green and red), re-released
movies and distant relatives who wear
big jewelry, than it is about midnight
mass, Gospels, spiritualism and a
remembrance of Christ.
And not only is the loss of the original
meaning of Xmas sad, it's dangerous.
Every year there are hundreds of tradi
tion-related deaths: Dads dressed in
Santa suits trapped in a chimney; car
accidents because of people distracted by
window decorations; tree fires (those
things light up like Napalm); lonely sui

cides; fruit-cake asphyxiations ....
Just what Jesus would have wanted,
right?
All the more reason to be spiteful is
that for once in our consumers' lives we
are actually able to name the THEY
responsible. Hallmark, Macy's, Disney
and Kodak — everything culturally asso
ciated with Christmas came from them
(or pagan residue).
Macy's invented the bioluminescent
reindeer. Hallmark propagated the "Spir
it of Christmas." Because of Kodak you
have to sit in an itchy sweater on your
aunt's lap for half an hour until grampa
gets the family photo just perfect. Disney
defined holiday imagery such that getting
the gushy "I love my world and my fami
ly" lump in your throat is simply a matter
of renting the right movie.
Even as a Jew I can't claim not to have
been effected by all this. I got my one-a
-day-count-'em-eight-C/itmizAa/i presents
when I was short. We decorated the den.
But back then I didn't recognize that it
all had nothing to do with the holiday
itself. Like the Hanookah bush, it is only
transculturation gone loopy.
Hanukka commemorates the victory of
a small band of Jewish rebels against Hel
lenistic imperial conquest, and the reded
ication of the temple in Jerusalem in 164
BCE. That's all. The must-give-eight pre
sents clause is merely an overcompensa
tion that happened when parents like
mine saw "Miracle on 34th Street."
Not that I minded getting all the Auto

bot front line in one swoop, but it less
ened the religious effect and dissolved all
the culture. Hanuqua should be about
nationalism and reaffirmation; about
freedom from religious oppression and
eating fried food.
Just because no one knows how to
spell it... .
So I'm not buying crap this year. Light
ing candles, spinning dreidels and upping
my cholesterol — that's it. And if Christ
mas isn't a religious holiday for you, con
sider keeping out of the mall yourself.
Because when you say, "Yeah, we cele
brate Christmas, but it's got nothing to
do with religion; it's a family thing," it
just might be an admission of guilt and
the internalization of commercially con
cocted obligation. Know that needing a
day on the calendar as an excuse to buy
mommy a new fishing rod is as bad as
needing a day in February to send roses
to the one you love. Any non-religious
attachment you might have to Dec. 25 is
a Hallmark attachment.
But if you must celebrate secularly and
you must buy presents, at least try to think
for a minute when you're on line at Nord
stroms about what Linus said to Lucy
before the Christmas pageant: "To you is
born this day in the city of David a Savior,
who is Christ, the Lord" (Luke 2:11).
It's easier than converting.

Michael invites you to Hanoka candle
lighting tonight at 11:00, Kimball Hall.
