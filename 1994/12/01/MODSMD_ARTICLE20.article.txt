Movie 6 True Lies' presented a warped picture of Islam

THE ACTION MOVIE "True
Lies," which elicited protests
from Arab Americans through
out the country, was shown at Sunday
night Flicks on Nov. 20. The Islamic
Society at Stanford, in an effort to
raise awareness on campus, issued
fliers before the movie started stating
that the film's portrayal of
Arabs/Muslims was not representative
of those who follow the teachings of
Islam, and that Arabs/Muslims should
not be judged as such. The Islamic
Society was not protesting against the
film being shown at Stanford, but
wanted to point out that the one
dimensional, stereotypical characters
in the movie are not reflective of
either Islam or Arabs.
The main problem with the film
was that it played on the fears and
ignorance of people's views of Islam.
Toward the end of the movie, when
Jamie Lee Curtis discovers that her
husband is a spy, she asks him, "Have
you ever killed anyone?" He answers,
"Yes, but they were all bad."
Throughout the movie, we get to
know who these "bad" Arabs are. The
very first scene where we see an Arab

speak, he slaps an Asian-American
woman working for him and calls her
a "stupid undisciplined bitch" and
scolds her for "flirting like a whore."
This scene plays on the false images
many people hold of Arabs/Muslims'
lack of respect for and abuse of
women, and the erroneous belief that
women must be "disciplined" by the
Arab men.
The movie built on physical stereo
types of Arabs with very Semitic fea
tures, such as bushy eyebrows, black
beards and hooked noses. This was
also criticized in the Disney movie
"Aladdin," as Jafar and the evil char
acters had dark skin and stereotypical
Arab features, while Princess Jasmine
and Aladdin bore white, Aryan traits.
Aside from being rich enough to
throw elaborate parties in Europe, as
well as dangerously violent, the Arabs
in "True Lies" were also portrayed as
stupid. The group consisted of stupid
men who cowered from their stupid
leader. In the scene where the leader
is demonstrating the "nuclear power
of the Crimson Jihad" the other Arab
who was videotaping the leader of the
group runs out of batteries but is too

afraid to tell the leader. This is on one
level showing the stupidity of their
not being prepared, and on another
level showing the irony of their hav
ing nuclear power, but not enough
"power" to have a fully charged video
camera.
The leader of the group tells the
Americans through the camera, "You
have killed our women and children,
like cowards bombed our cities from
afar, and you dare to call us terror
ists?" Whether he is referring to
Libya, Israel/Gaza strip, Lebanon or
the Perisan Gulf, the concern of
women and children killed in the Arab
world is almost a joke coming from
this character who is simultaneously
fondling his nuclear missile.
The most jabbing misrepresenta
tion of this film is the use of the term
"jihad" and the insinuation of terror
ist activities done in the name of
Islam. In Islamic theology, "jihad"
means "effort," usually to overcome a
struggle, and the best way to achieve
this is through peace. However,
through film and the media, the word
"jihad" has come to be associated with
violent, warlike and terrorist activi-

ties.
A lot of movies misrepresent cer
tain groups, and throughout the years
many minorities have spoken out in
protest. However, targeted groups
such as African Americans or Latinos
also have positive representation to
counteract the negative stereotypes,
while any kind of positive representa
tion is lacking within the Arab Ameri
can and Muslim American communi
ties. While many African Americans
are portrayed as criminals and Lati
nos as drug dealers, there are also
characters such as Bill Cosby playing
the loving father and physician, the
astute talk show host Oprah Winfrey
or Jimmy Smits as the Latino lawyer
in L.A. Law, who can stand against
these stereotypes. These faces are
missing among Arabs/Muslims to
counteract movies such as "Not With
out My Daughter" and "True Lies,"
and it is thus important for the
Arab/Islamic community to voice its
concern.
