# COP made uninformed decision by demanding that Bressler step down
## 
### 
It is ironic that the Council of Pres
idents has made claims of "poor man
agement" and "acting in bad faith"
against ASSU Publications Board
Director Danny Bressler, especially in
light of the recent actions by the COP.
The COP made an uninformed and
rash decision when they requested
Bressier's dismissal.

COP member Vanessa Alvarado is
quoted as saying, "knowing what we
knew at the time, we made the appro
priate decision." I do not think that
ignorance is a good excuse for making
a bad decision. It takes about 10 min
utes to read the Publications Board
Bylaws and if any of the COP mem
bers had done this beforehand, they
would have realized that Bressler was
acting within the bylaws the whole
time that the space reallocation pro
cess was taking place. Realizing their
mistake, COP member Mork Murdock
stated that the COP "realized that
Danny may have been acting within
the bylaws, and the bylaws were the

problem." These are the very same
bylaws that were drafted and passed
by the organization they purport to
lead.
I am not even sure what Murdock
meant when he stated there was a
problem with the bylaws — just
because the Chaparral was not happy
with the space reallocation does not
mean that the bylaws are not effec
tive. There were plenty of opportuni
ties during the Facilities and Space
Committee meetings for the Chaparral
to make its case for keeping the space,
but ultimately the committee decided
against the Chaparral, and the Publi
cations Board members overwhelm-

ingly voted in favor of the committee's
recommendation. I think that the
main reason the COP asked for
Bressler's resignation was due to the
pressure that the Chaparral and its
alumni exerted on the COP members
— pressure that the COP caved in to.
COP member Anietie Ekanem said
that he did not believe that Bressler
can make impartial decisions. Funny,
I was wondering the same thing about
the members of the COP.
