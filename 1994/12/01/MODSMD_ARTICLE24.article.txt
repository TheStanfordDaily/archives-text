# SEAS focuses to reduce waste

Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford will use this aca
demic year to conduct a campaign
encouraging the University to alter
its procurement procedures and
become more environmentally
responsible.
"We are adopting a new
approach this year," said sopho
more Aaron Padilla, the group's co
coordinator, after a three-and-a
half hour marathon meeting Tues
day night.
"There was no unified theme
before. We have been an umbrella
organization with different groups
working for different things," he
said. "This year we want to have all
the effort and action focused on one
thing."
In the past, the work of other
organizations has set the agenda
for SEAS, but this central cam
paign allows the group to set its
own agenda, said senior Maijorie
Lucks, co-coordinator.
SEAS will be focusing specifical
ly on the University's buying policy
for paper, office supplies, comput
ers and other products, Lucks said.

According to materials handed
out at the meeting, major purchas
es on campus are now handled by
the University's Procurement
Department. In addition, individual
departments make smaller pur
chases on their own. SEAS would
work to establish a post-consumer
recycled policy for purchases on
campus.
"We will not just talk to the
departments but try to influence
the University to advocate environ
mental responsibility in buying
supplies," Lucks said. "We want to
show you that environment respon
sibility is economically viable."
The University buys so many
supplies that there are plenty of
opportunities to act in an environ
mentally responsible manner,
Padilla said.
"We will do our planning before
we break for Christmas," he said.
Once the organization comes up
with its "strategies and tactics,"
members will divide themselves
into smaller groups to tackle the
different tasks, Padilla added.
The 22 members at the meeting
debated 11 different proposals
before deciding on the procurement

issue. The campaign for the year
was decided upon on the basis of six
criteria
The main criteria was to achieve
tangible results by June 1995. "We
want to have something very defi
nite established by then," Lucks
said. Timeliness, relevance, coali
tion building, impact and interest
generated by the project were the
others.
Some of the other campaign
ideas included planned University
growth along Sand Hill Road, the
Stanford West development, toxic
waste dumping and settlement,
recycling and monitoring Dining
Services.
All projects were assessed by a
research team, Padilla said. SEAS
conducted extensive interviews
with faculty, students, administra
tive staff and community environ
ment leaders to find out what
issues to focus on, he said.
In the past, SEAS was funded
through the ASSU special fee sys
tem, but the group's fee was not
approved during last year's spring
election. "It will be a low-budget
operation," Padilla said. "We will be
working on saved-up funds."
