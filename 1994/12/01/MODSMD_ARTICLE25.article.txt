## No. 2 women's basketball heads east to take on No. 1 Tennessee 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
This year marks the sixth time Ten
nessee has gone into the annual
women's basketball game against
Stanford ranked either first or second.
During the six previous annual incar
nations of this battle, five times the
victor emerged, at the end of the sea
son, as the national champion.
This year promises to be no differ
ent.
"[The contest] is the hardest game I
can remember playing in," said senior
center Anita Kaplan. "My sophomore
year, when we were playing there, it
was impossible (to play]."
The Lady Volunteers (1-0) are cur
rently ranked No. 1 in the country and
also will have the added advantage of
playing on their home court in front of
over 10,000 orange and white-clad
fans.
On the other hand, the Cardinal (2-
0) enters Knoxville as the No. 2 team
in the nation. It is also riding an emo
tional high after beating then-No. 2
Purdue and sixth-ranked Texas Tech,
both in convincing fashion.
"Tennessee is not unbeatable," said
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "We've
played against exceptional competition
and we should be very confident.
"We're going to have to start out

the game with good concentration,"
she added. "It's going to be very tough.
Both of our teams are national title
contenders and we both can gain a lot
from this game."
Stanford grabbed the nation's
attention when it pounded out victo
ries by going inside and out-muscling
some of the strongest basketball
teams. Kaplan and the rest of the front
court will see how far they have pro
gressed today, as Tennessee makes its
living playing that same style of game.
"Tennessee really has a strong
power game and they go inside a lot,"
VanDerveer said. "We have to get in
front of their post players and front
them."

'We've played against
exceptional competition
and we should be very
confident.'

The Lady Volunteers feature a bevy
of front court players, led by potential
Ail-American forward Nikki McCray.
McCray averaged 16.3 points per game
and 7.0 rebounds per game last year as
a junior. Senior center Dana Johnson
will help out McCray along with fresh
man phenom Tiffani Johnson. John
son chipped in 13.8 points per game
and 7.3 rebounds per game during
Tennessee's 31-2 1993-1994 cam
paign.
"We've been playing very good
defense," VanDerveer said. "But we
need to rebound and box out in order
to prevent second shots."
Kaplan and sophomore forward Kate
Starbird lead Stanford in scoring thus
far in the season. They have been the
only Cardinal players to score in double
digits in each of the first two games.
"As long as they're going to let
Anita score, then we're going inside to

her," VanDerveer said.
However, VanDerveer also stated
that Stanford needed to spread the
scoring around. The loss of senior for
ward Rachel Hemmer to leg surgery
has affected the team the most in this
respect.
"[Senior guard] Kate Paye did come
off the bench and score some big bas
kets against Purdue, but we need [red
shirt junior] Bobby [Kelsey] to step
up," VanDerveer added. "We need our
four [position] players to step up and
score more.
"The teams has to be thinking offen
sively and take it to the basket. We're
going to try to run some different set
plays to shake it up," she said.
Numerous injuries, have hurt the
Cardinal this year. Paye has been hob
bled by a sprained ankle while sopho
more Jamila Wideman is still suffering
from the after-effects of an ankle
injury she incurred against Washing
ton at the end of last season.
Freshman forward Heather Owen
remains day-to-day after injuring her
ankle during last Friday's game
against Texas Tech. Just seconds after
entering the game, Owen and Starbird
got tangled up defending an inbound
pass.
"Heather has not been progressing
that well," VanDerveer said. "She's
still limping."
Tennessee has won seven of the
nine contests between the two teams
and is riding a three-game winning
streak in the series. So far, the Lady
Volunteers have prevailed in every
game which has been played in
Knoxville or on a neutral court.
"No Stanford team has beaten
them there so it would be a big accom
plishment for the team to win,"
Kaplan said.
While the No. 1 ranking is at stake
in this major early-season clash, the
polls do not hold much weight for
Stanford.
"It's the end of the year that
counts," VanDerveer said.
