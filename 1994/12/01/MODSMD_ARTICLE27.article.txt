## A
						revealing look at guard Kamba Tshionyi 
### Daniel Kao Contributing writer 
You wouldn't know it by
looking at him. He doesn't smile
much, at least not in many
media photos. He carries a seri
ous countenance. At best, one
would call it pensive, at worst
cold. But after listening to Car-

dinal freshman guard Kamba
Tshionyi talk, you begin to see
differently.
That should come as no sur
prise. After all, "Kamba," in his
father's native Zaire tongue,
means "spokesman," so it is
extremely fitting that only when
the polite, soft-spoken Tshionyi

speaks, does one truly get an
idea of who he is.
"I'm not a social animal,"
said Tshionyi, in a moment of
self-re flection. "In fact I'm not
too social at all, and to people I
don't know well, I can come off
as cold."
But ironically, the frigid
demeanor is rather unrepresen-

tative of Tshionyi's true self. In
fact, the 6-foot-2, 172-pound
Tshionyi is more of a Johnny
Carson than a Harry Carson.
"My sense of humor is my
strongest trait," Tshionyi said.
"It's gotten me through a lot,
like my calculus midterm for
instance. I don't just see every

thing with such finality as
everyone else."
That is when you know that
whether it be a chemistry final
or a Damon Stoudamire jumper
— both perhaps equally as
lethal in Tshionyi's eyes — he
will take it all in stride.
Certainly, however, the dif
ferences and difficulties which
arise in the transition game of
high school to college have not
gone unnoticed by the native of
Eugene, Ore.
"It's tough, but it's fun,"
Tshionyi said. "I like being on
my own, but it's a lot of work.
It's a lot more intense and fast
paced. Time management is the
hardest part, finding enough
time to do everything.
"As far as basketball, the
jump from high school is a
night-and-day contrast. If I
went back and watched a high
school game, it would be like in
slow motion. Everything is so
much faster [in college]. Every
body is strong. It really takes
awhile to get adjusted to it."
There's no reason why it
won't happen, however. With an
enthusiastic coaching staff and
four veteran guards to learn
under, Tshionyi has no where to
go but up.
"He needs to be stronger and
more physical," head coach
Mike Montgomery said. "He's a
very bright kid and picks things
up quickly. He doesn't make
mistakes. The pace of the game
and strength involved has been
a factor for him. With four vet
eran guards who have been
around and understand
nuances, it's difficult for him as
far as playing time, but he's
made good progress in terms of
