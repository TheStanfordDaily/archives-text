# Words louder than action
## A 						revealing look at guard Kamba Tshionyi 
### Daniel Kao Contributing writer 
You wouldn't know it by
looking at him. He doesn't smile
much, at least not in many
media photos. He carries a seri
ous countenance. At best, one
would call it pensive, at worst
cold. But after listening to Car-

dinal freshman guard Kamba
Tshionyi talk, you begin to see
differently.
That should come as no sur
prise. After all, "Kamba," in his
father's native Zaire tongue,
means "spokesman," so it is
extremely fitting that only when
the polite, soft-spoken Tshionyi

speaks, does one truly get an
idea of who he is.
"I'm not a social animal,"
said Tshionyi, in a moment of
self-re flection. "In fact I'm not
too social at all, and to people I
don't know well, I can come off
as cold."
But ironically, the frigid
demeanor is rather unrepresen-

tative of Tshionyi's true self. In
fact, the 6-foot-2, 172-pound
Tshionyi is more of a Johnny
Carson than a Harry Carson.
"My sense of humor is my
strongest trait," Tshionyi said.
"It's gotten me through a lot,
like my calculus midterm for
instance. I don't just see every

thing with such finality as
everyone else."
That is when you know that
whether it be a chemistry final
or a Damon Stoudamire jumper
— both perhaps equally as
lethal in Tshionyi's eyes — he
will take it all in stride.
Certainly, however, the dif
ferences and difficulties which
arise in the transition game of
high school to college have not
gone unnoticed by the native of
Eugene, Ore.
"It's tough, but it's fun,"
Tshionyi said. "I like being on
my own, but it's a lot of work.
It's a lot more intense and fast
paced. Time management is the
hardest part, finding enough
time to do everything.
"As far as basketball, the
jump from high school is a
night-and-day contrast. If I
went back and watched a high
school game, it would be like in
slow motion. Everything is so
much faster [in college]. Every
body is strong. It really takes
awhile to get adjusted to it."
There's no reason why it
won't happen, however. With an
enthusiastic coaching staff and
four veteran guards to learn
under, Tshionyi has no where to
go but up.
"He needs to be stronger and
more physical," head coach
Mike Montgomery said. "He's a
very bright kid and picks things
up quickly. He doesn't make
mistakes. The pace of the game
and strength involved has been
a factor for him. With four vet
eran guards who have been
around and understand
nuances, it's difficult for him as
far as playing time, but he's
made good progress in terms of

stepping up and running the club.
It's very encouraging from our
standpoint.
"He spent a lot of his life play
ing soccer and had not spent 12
months a year playing basket
ball," the coach added. "I think
when he does that and combines
a lifting program, you'll see real
rapid progress."
It was not until the end of his
junior year in high school, when
he was named to an Oregon All-
Star team that toured in Arizona,
that Tshionyi decided to focus his
energies on the hardcourt. Suc
cess followed soon after, as he
averaged 15 points, six assists,
four rebounds, and four steals his
senior year. Honors and awards
soon followed as well, including
league MVP and third team all
state selections.
Of course, a little luck never
hurts when it comes to recruit
ing, and Tshionyi definitely had
some. He played the game of his
life against rival South Eugene
High School when Cardinal
scouts were watching. He nearly
recorded a triple-double with 12
points, 11 assists, and eight
rebounds, along with four steals.
But more dramatically, Tshionyi
had a game-breaking dunk.
The only dunk in his life as a
matter of fact.
"After the dunk, we went on a
29-4 run, and it was game over,"
Tshionyi said with a sparkle in
his eye. "It was the only time I
dunked — very fortuitous. The
Stanford football team just hap
pened to be playing the Oregon
Ducks. My face just happened to
be on the cover of the local sports
page. One of Stanford's football
coaches just happened to be
watching one of my teammates.
Lucky breaks."

While breaks never hurt,
Tshionyi probably won't need
many at Stanford. Discounting
the inevitable setbacks all fresh
men face, Tshionyi appears capa
ble to handle whatever happens
here at the Farm.
"One thing that is good is that
he is able to handle the aca
demics, so it hasn't been a major
factor for him," Montgomery
said. "Some kids come in and the
change in academics is so drastic
that it overwhelms them and
takes them a long time to get over
that funk. In Kamba's case, there
was an adjustment, but it was
quick."
That too comes as little sur
prise. Tshionyi is seriously con
sidering medical school and by no
means is the value of academics
lost upon him.
"So much of the emphasis you
see these days, especially with the
youth, is sports, sports, sports,"
Tshionyi said. "But by working
hard in school and doing well in
sports there are so many more
options."
As for medicine, Tshionyi sees
his time as limited on the hard
wood, but he wants to remain
connected with sports. Therefore
orthopedic surgery seems a viable
career choice.
"I know that basketball is
going to be over in four years or
at most, if I become really good,
10," Tshionyi said. "But I still
have 50 years to live. In the grand
scheme of things, it's just a part
of life. It's helped me be a more
well-rounded individual, and
that's important no matter if it's
jogging or playing on the football
team. Basketball has also facili
tated me in life in terms of getting
places. It helped me gain access to
this institution, and I'm really
enjoying it here. This environ
ment is just great. They have
everything. Everything in the
world."
Looking into the crystal

roundball, Tshionyi hopes that
his role on the team will increase
with time. He realizes his posi
tion now as a back-up to starting
guards Brevin Knight and Dion
Cross. He provides needed depth
in the backcourt with his ability
to fit in at either guard position,
contributing solid ball-handling
skills and knowledge.
"Kamba is definitely a combi
nation guard," Montgomery said.
"He's learning the point and just
needs to learn where everyone
else is. He can create opportuni
ties for others to score. And in the
off-guard position, he can shoot
the open shot. He handles both
positions well. He just needs to be
more assertive."
Knight speaks highly of his
understudy. "Tshionyi can run
the team," he said. "He's got good
ball-handling skills and can also
do it on defense."
Tshionyi is keeping things in
perspective and taking every
thing as only he can, with per
spective and a chuckle. He knows
the potential the team has this
year to reach the NCAA tourna
ment, and is looking to do all he
can to help.
"I just have to contribute
whatever way possible," Tshionyi
said. "If that means cheering the
guys on, I have to do that. Just
doing whatever coach tells me. If
that means subbing for 10 min
utes, that's what I'll do. If that
means starting, that's what I'll
do. Whatever the team needs,
that's what I'll do."
Of course, he'll continue to
work on his weaknesses, such as
need for greater physical strength
and aggressiveness. Eventually at
Stanford, he hopes to emerge as a
starter. But there's also some
thing else he's looking for here.
As spokesman, he'll need a mes
sage he has yet to discover.
"I'm in the process of finding
it," Tshionyi said. "When I find
it, I'll let everyone know."

his eye. "It was the only time I
dunked — very fortuitous. The
Stanford football team just hap
pened to be playing the Oregon
Ducks. My face just happened to
be on the cover of the local sports
page. One of Stanford's football
coaches just happened to be
watching one of my teammates.
Lucky breaks."

While breaks never hurt,
Tshionyi probably won't need
many at Stanford. Discounting
the inevitable setbacks all fresh
men face, Tshionyi appears capa
ble to handle whatever happens
here at the Farm.
"One thing that is good is that
he is able to handle the aca
demics, so it hasn't been a major
factor for him," Montgomery
said. "Some kids come in and the
change in academics is so drastic
that it overwhelms them and
takes them a long time to get over
that funk. In Kamba's case, there
was an adjustment, but it was
quick."
That too comes as little sur
prise. Tshionyi is seriously con
sidering medical school and by no
means is the value of academics
lost upon him.
"So much of the emphasis you
see these days, especially with the
youth, is sports, sports, sports,"
Tshionyi said. "But by working
hard in school and doing well in
sports there are so many more
options."
As for medicine, Tshionyi sees
his time as limited on the hard
wood, but he wants to remain
connected with sports. Therefore
orthopedic surgery seems a viable
career choice.
"I know that basketball is
going to be over in four years or
at most, if I become really good,
10," Tshionyi said. "But I still
have 50 years to live. In the grand
scheme of things, it's just a part
of life. It's helped me be a more
well-rounded individual, and
that's important no matter if it's
jogging or playing on the football
team. Basketball has also facili
tated me in life in terms of getting
places. It helped me gain access to
this institution, and I'm really
enjoying it here. This environ
ment is just great. They have
everything. Everything in the
world."
Looking into the crystal

roundball, Tshionyi hopes that
his role on the team will increase
with time. He realizes his posi
tion now as a back-up to starting
guards Brevin Knight and Dion
Cross. He provides needed depth
in the backcourt with his ability
to fit in at either guard position,
contributing solid ball-handling
skills and knowledge.
"Kamba is definitely a combi
nation guard," Montgomery said.
"He's learning the point and just
needs to learn where everyone
else is. He can create opportuni
ties for others to score. And in the
off-guard position, he can shoot
the open shot. He handles both
positions well. He just needs to be
more assertive."
Knight speaks highly of his
understudy. "Tshionyi can run
the team," he said. "He's got good
ball-handling skills and can also
do it on defense."
Tshionyi is keeping things in
perspective and taking every
thing as only he can, with per
spective and a chuckle. He knows
the potential the team has this
year to reach the NCAA tourna
ment, and is looking to do all he
can to help.
"I just have to contribute
whatever way possible," Tshionyi
said. "If that means cheering the
guys on, I have to do that. Just
doing whatever coach tells me. If
that means subbing for 10 min
utes, that's what I'll do. If that
means starting, that's what I'll
do. Whatever the team needs,
that's what I'll do."
Of course, he'll continue to
work on his weaknesses, such as
need for greater physical strength
and aggressiveness. Eventually at
Stanford, he hopes to emerge as a
starter. But there's also some
thing else he's looking for here.
As spokesman, he'll need a mes
sage he has yet to discover.
"I'm in the process of finding
it," Tshionyi said. "When I find
it, I'll let everyone know."

The men's swimming team hopes to return to its winning ways this weekend at the Speedo Cup Invi
tational.
You wouldn't know it by
looking at him. He doesn't smile
much, at least not in many
media photos. He carries a seri
ous countenance. At best, one
would call it pensive, at worst
cold. But after listening to Car-

dinal freshman guard Kamba
Tshionyi talk, you begin to see
differently.
That should come as no sur
prise. After all, "Kamba," in his
father's native Zaire tongue,
means "spokesman," so it is
extremely fitting that only when
the polite, soft-spoken Tshionyi

speaks, does one truly get an
idea of who he is.
"I'm not a social animal,"
said Tshionyi, in a moment of
self-re flection. "In fact I'm not
too social at all, and to people I
don't know well, I can come off
as cold."
But ironically, the frigid
demeanor is rather unrepresen-

tative of Tshionyi's true self. In
fact, the 6-foot-2, 172-pound
Tshionyi is more of a Johnny
Carson than a Harry Carson.
"My sense of humor is my
strongest trait," Tshionyi said.
"It's gotten me through a lot,
like my calculus midterm for
instance. I don't just see every

thing with such finality as
everyone else."
That is when you know that
whether it be a chemistry final
or a Damon Stoudamire jumper
— both perhaps equally as
lethal in Tshionyi's eyes — he
will take it all in stride.
Certainly, however, the dif
ferences and difficulties which
arise in the transition game of
high school to college have not
gone unnoticed by the native of
Eugene, Ore.
"It's tough, but it's fun,"
Tshionyi said. "I like being on
my own, but it's a lot of work.
It's a lot more intense and fast
paced. Time management is the
hardest part, finding enough
time to do everything.
"As far as basketball, the
jump from high school is a
night-and-day contrast. If I
went back and watched a high
school game, it would be like in
slow motion. Everything is so
much faster [in college]. Every
body is strong. It really takes
awhile to get adjusted to it."
There's no reason why it
won't happen, however. With an
enthusiastic coaching staff and
four veteran guards to learn
under, Tshionyi has no where to
go but up.
"He needs to be stronger and
more physical," head coach
Mike Montgomery said. "He's a
very bright kid and picks things
up quickly. He doesn't make
mistakes. The pace of the game
and strength involved has been
a factor for him. With four vet
eran guards who have been
around and understand
nuances, it's difficult for him as
far as playing time, but he's
made good progress in terms of

stepping up and running the club.
It's very encouraging from our
standpoint.
"He spent a lot of his life play
ing soccer and had not spent 12
months a year playing basket
ball," the coach added. "I think
when he does that and combines
a lifting program, you'll see real
rapid progress."
It was not until the end of his
junior year in high school, when
he was named to an Oregon All-
Star team that toured in Arizona,
that Tshionyi decided to focus his
energies on the hardcourt. Suc
cess followed soon after, as he
averaged 15 points, six assists,
four rebounds, and four steals his
senior year. Honors and awards
soon followed as well, including
league MVP and third team all
state selections.
Of course, a little luck never
hurts when it comes to recruit
ing, and Tshionyi definitely had
some. He played the game of his
life against rival South Eugene
High School when Cardinal
scouts were watching. He nearly
recorded a triple-double with 12
points, 11 assists, and eight
rebounds, along with four steals.
But more dramatically, Tshionyi
had a game-breaking dunk.
The only dunk in his life as a
matter of fact.
"After the dunk, we went on a
29-4 run, and it was game over,"
Tshionyi said with a sparkle in
his eye. "It was the only time I
dunked — very fortuitous. The
