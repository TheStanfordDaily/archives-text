# Cardinal men to try on Speedo
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's swim
ming team is not used to losing.
After the three-time defend
ing NCAA champions suffered
an early-season loss at the hands
of rival Texas in Austin, the
swimmers will head south to
Long Beach, Calif., today for the
Speedo Cup Invitational to get
back on the winning track.
Unlike dual meets, the Speedo
Cup will feature a championship
style format, which will serve as
a dress rehearsal for the Pacific
10 Conference championships
and the NCAA championships.
The difference between the
two meet formats is crucial to

the team's success later in the
year.
"A dual meet usually takes
about two and a half hours,
whereas this meet will be swum
over three days," said senior
Clay Tippins. "There is a big
emotional difference â€” in a dual
meet, you can let it all hang out,
but in the three-day format, you
need to watch your emotional
reserves. It's more strategic and
requires more preparation."
While swimmers are limited
in the number of races they may
enter in dual competition, the
Stanford swimmers will each
compete in a handful of races
over the longer meet. In addi
tion, preliminary heats will qual
ify swimmers for the finals, and

thus another chance to race.
"It will be good to get some
experience and get lots of racing
in," said freestyler Dan Kanner,
also a senior. "These early-sea
son meets give you a benchmark
of where you are at this point."
Because the Cardinal athletes
are at different points in their
training, the results they seek
are not all the same. The spec
trum ranges from freshmen get
ting used to collegiate competi
tion to upperclassmen who will
be aiming to qualify for the
NCAA championships unshaved.
"At this point, it helps to com
pare my swims to last year at this
time, to see how my training is
