# Cardinal men to try on Speedo
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's swim
ming team is not used to losing.
After the three-time defend
ing NCAA champions suffered
an early-season loss at the hands
of rival Texas in Austin, the
swimmers will head south to
Long Beach, Calif., today for the
Speedo Cup Invitational to get
back on the winning track.
Unlike dual meets, the Speedo
Cup will feature a championship
style format, which will serve as
a dress rehearsal for the Pacific
10 Conference championships
and the NCAA championships.
The difference between the
two meet formats is crucial to

the team's success later in the
year.
"A dual meet usually takes
about two and a half hours,
whereas this meet will be swum
over three days," said senior
Clay Tippins. "There is a big
emotional difference â€” in a dual
meet, you can let it all hang out,
but in the three-day format, you
need to watch your emotional
reserves. It's more strategic and
requires more preparation."
While swimmers are limited
in the number of races they may
enter in dual competition, the
Stanford swimmers will each
compete in a handful of races
over the longer meet. In addi
tion, preliminary heats will qual
ify swimmers for the finals, and

thus another chance to race.
"It will be good to get some
experience and get lots of racing
in," said freestyler Dan Kanner,
also a senior. "These early-sea
son meets give you a benchmark
of where you are at this point."
Because the Cardinal athletes
are at different points in their
training, the results they seek
are not all the same. The spec
trum ranges from freshmen get
ting used to collegiate competi
tion to upperclassmen who will
be aiming to qualify for the
NCAA championships unshaved.
"At this point, it helps to com
pare my swims to last year at this
time, to see how my training is
going," Kanner said. "It's a
chance to work on things we talk
about in workouts, like turns
and pace."
While the Cardinal is unsure
of what type of opposition it will
face, as several top rivals will be
competing at the Speedo Cup, it
is ready to compete.
"The main competition may
be us against ourselves," Tip
pins said. "Some swimmers from

other teams may be shaved
which can give our athletes bet
ter races, but that shouldn't be
our focus this weekend."
Tippins, who missed the
Texas dual due to sickness, is
eager to get his first swims of
the year under his belt.
"This is my first meet, so I'd
like to post some good fast
times," he said. "It's generally
true that from where you start a
season, you get faster. I'd like to
start out very fast."
The racing experience will
also prepare the Cardinal for the
tough dual meet schedule which

lies ahead. Stanford will host
No. 1 Michigan after winter
break.
"It's nice to concentrate on
certain events without the pres
sure to win," Kanner said. "I
don't know how critical times
will be, but it's a chance to tune
up and go into races to work on
strategy."
This early tune up will be
only a preview of what the Car
dinal plans to accomplish by the
end of the year. On the minds of
Stanford swimmers will be
preparation, intensity and no
thoughts of losing.
