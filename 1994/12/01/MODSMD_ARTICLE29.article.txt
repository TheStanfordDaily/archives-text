# Battling to become the lone star
## Women swimmers to face nation's best in Texas Invite 
### Ezra Baylin 
The No. 1 Stanford women's
swimming and diving team heads to
Austin, Texas, today to test its mettle
against other top teams in
the country at the Texas Invitational.
Second-ranked Texas, third
ranked USC, fourth-ranked Michi
gan and fifth-ranked Auburn will
also participate, making the meet
an early showcase for the top swim
mers in the country.
The Cardinal looks strong going
into the meet, particularly with the
return of senior Eileen Richetelli,
the team's top diver who sat out
last season due to a back injury.
"Eileen Richetelli is probably
the best collegiate diver in the Unit
ed States," said head coach Richard
Quick. "She possesses both
the physical strength and the ath
letic agility to do all the
tricks."
The addition of Claudia Franco,
a transfer from Florida, also

strengthened the already potent
sprint freestyle attack. Franco
gives Stanford the fastest sprint
freestyle squad in the country on
paper, but the Texas Invite will
provide Quick with his first
opportunity to see Franco, senior

Jenny Thompson, junior Jessica
Tong and freshmen Becky Bick
nell and Lindsay Gassner com
pete together.
The only serious problems
Stanford may face in Austin stem
from preseason injuries. Most
notably, senior Mary Ellen Blan
chard will sit out this meet
because of knee surgery. Blan
chard is one of the top 200-meter
Individual Medley performers in

the country, and she holds the
American and U.S. Open records
for the 200-meter breast stroke.
Although injuries may handi
cap Stanford in the invite, the
event is essentially a preseason
warm-up and an opportunity for
the Cardinal to judge its
strength.
"The main team goal at this
point is to focus on the NCAAs,"
said senior captain Becky Crowe.
