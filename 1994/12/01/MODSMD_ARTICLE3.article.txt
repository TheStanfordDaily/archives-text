# Task force looks at gay curricula
## 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
Although a variety of student groups
are asking the University for new curric
ula — such as Chicano Studies, Asian-
American Studies and Native American
Studies — the Lesbian and Gay Studies
Planning Group is following a somewhat
different path toward academic recogni

tion.
Though the group hasn't ruled out
asking for an independent program, its
main focus has been promoting gay and
lesbian issues within already-established
departments.
"It's a difficult area in that there are a
lot of people working in lesbian and gay
studies, but under other, more tradition
al disciplines, like English and drama,"

said group member John Reuling, vice
president and dean of networking at the
medical center. "There isn't much com
munication between groups."
"We really act as a forum for people to
exchange ideas. It's not clear to us that
demanding a program from the Univer
sity will help our goals," he said. The
committee "hasn't come to a
consensus to create a program
for lesbian and gay studies."
The group — which is made
up of about six people and has a
mailing list of about 30 — has
been meeting twice each month
since last spring quarter to dis
cuss cultivation of lesbian and
gay issues within the Stanford
community.
Recently, the group has been
fundraising with other lesbian,
gay and bisexual groups — such
as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
and Out at Stanford— to sup
port a popular faculty seminar
headed by History Prof. Estelle
Freedman, feminist studies
chair. Funds will provide course
development grants to help fac
ulty revise their curricula to
include lesbian and gay issues.
"We hope to maybe get two or
three new courses out of the
seminar," Stocker said.
The group is also planning

academic programs such as a lec
ture series and an on-campus
conference regarding lesbian and
gay issues in curricula. Both
events are tentatively planned
for spring quarter.
The lesbian and gay studies
focus of last year's Jing Lyman
Lecture Series — sponsored by
the Institute for Research on
Women and Gender — was one
catalyst for the group's forma
tion, Reuling said.
He said the group's primary
concern is to encourage commu
nication and scholarship in the
area of lesbian and gay issues,
and, in doing so, promote aware
ness of these topics in the gener
al Stanford community.
Although others agree that
examining and adding to Stan
ford's curricula is not the
group's sole objective, some said
they believe that focusing on les
bian and gay issues in academia
is still a vital concern of the
group.
"It's not our immediate goal
to create classes or curricula, but
to revamp current courses to
include lesbian and gay con

tent," said Overseas Studies
administrative assistant Scott
Stocker, another group member.
Stocker added, however, that
a possible long-term goal of the
group is to create a lesbian and
gay studies program at Stanford,
similar to the current program
in Feminist Studies.
"It's a very interesting aca
demic field, if you set politics
aside," Stocker said. "There's
cutting-edge research to be done
in literature and the social sci
ences, especially dealing with
sexuality. It's an issue that's
been ignored by academia for so
long. It's kind of a wide-open
field."
Stocker added that it is
important for Stanford to focus
on lesbian and gay studies in its
curricula to maintain its compet
itive position with top universi
ties.
"It's a valid area of intellectu
ally rigorous academics. If Stan
ford ignores it, it will lag behind
other universities traditionally
considered its competitors, such
as Harvard and Yale," Reuling
said.
