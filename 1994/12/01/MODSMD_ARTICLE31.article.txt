# ASSU cleans up its voting process
## 
### Nicole Harry Contributing writer 
In an effort to encourage stu
dents to complete the voting pro
cess, the ASSU plans to imple
ment a more graphics-oriented
voting system this year that it
hopes will be less time-consum
ing than last year's text-heavy
program.
The change stems from prob
lems the ASSU had getting vot
ers to read through and then
vote on the special-fee requests, a
process which took up to an
hour. As a result, a large number
of students abstained from vot
ing for special-fee requests.
The abstentions particularly
hurt student groups because of
rules mandating that in order for
a group to receive its special-fee
request, it must have a majority
voting in its favor, and that
majority must constitute 15 per
cent of the population.
Last year, 36 groups asked for
requests, and 19 failed to get

them. Ten of those groups had a
majority, but did not meet the 15
percent of the population
requirement — a problem at
least partially due to the absten
tions.
"We believe that one reason
why so many people abstained
was because the system was just
too confusing and it took too
much time to vote," said Senate
Chair Nawwar Kasrawi, a co-ter
minal student.
Using the World-Wide Web
system, the new program will
have graphics and less text, a
marked difference from last
year's on-line system which used
only text and required extensive
amounts of reading, especially in
the special-fee request section,
Kasrawi said.
The ASSU used a graphical
system two years ago, but the
system was not on-line and
required poll workers to go
around to every computer and
compile the votes on one disk.
Last year's system eliminated

the need for poll watchers, as the
votes were tallied electronically
and stored in the database. But
because of difficulties in combin
ing the graphical and electroni
cally stored systems through
HyperCard, last year's system
was strictly text-based.
Thanks to developments by
the election commissioner and a
technical consultant, the two sys
tems will be combined this year.
"The major asset of this
World-Wide Web system," Kas
rawi said, "is that we will be able
to maintain the advance of hav
ing gone to a network system,
and at the same time, bring in
the benefits of the graphical sys
tem."
While Kasrawi said that
improvements in the system hope
fully will increase voting, he and
others acknowledged that compli
cations in the computer system
were only one reason why half the
groups that requested special fees
didn't get funded last year.
"Though problems in the vot

ing procedures did have a nega
tive effect, I feel one of the bigger
issues dealt with the grad school
students," said Jaasi Munanka,
chair of the Black Student
Union.
To help address problems that
arose through graduate stu
dents' voting, the ASSU is look
ing into several options. One
pending proposal is the Fair-
Funding Amendment, which
would split special-fee votes
between undergraduates and
graduates.
The proposal's purpose is to
help alleviate some graduate stu
dents' concerns about funding
groups which primarily serve the
undergraduate community by
allowing each community to
decide separately whether or not
to fund a group.
Another option focuses more
on resolving logistical problems
by recommending the use of
paper ballots in areas such as the
Law and Medical Schools, which
had difficulty logging on last year.
