# Stanford Fleet Street singer bound for 'Miss Saigon' national tour Michael Lee
## 
### Victor Wishna 
n his psychology seminar this
m m quarter, senior Michael Lee was
asked to share something interest
ing about himself during the requisite round
of introductions. When his turn came, he
calmly mentioned that he had recently been
asked to join a group of traveling performers.
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Lee's "group of traveling performers" is
actually the national touring company of the
smash Broadway musical "Miss Saigon." And
the modest Lee wasn't just asked to join — he
was selected for a leading role from among
hundreds of talented young actors, after an
arduous year of auditions that took him
across the country and back again.
But you will never hear Lee bragging
about his accomplishment, if you happen to
hear him mention it at all.
"Of course he was really excited to get the
part," said his roommate Jonathan Green, a
senior who also sings with Lee in Fleet Street.
"But he doesn't go around telling people
about it."
In private, however, Lee talks earnestly
about his new opportunity.
"I'm really excited about playingThuy," he
said of his character in "Miss Saigon," a mod
ern adaptation of Puccini's "Madame Butter
fly" set in the aftermath of the Vietnam War.
"He's the villain of the story. But for me, 1 can
understand where he's coming from a lot.
When his betrothed girlfriend falls in love
with an American G.I. — that's a huge blow
to his ego.
"The Americans represent everything bad
that happened to their country. I can see his
pain and 1 can see his jealousy. To me, he's re
ally a sympathetic character."
Born in Brooklyn, Lee grew up as the
youngest member of the only Asian-Ameri
can family in Salamanca, N.Y., a small town
an hour south of Buffalo. As a third-grader,
he had his first theatrical experience in a pro
duction of "The King and I."
His part?
"1 played a princess," he recalled. "When I
was small, I was never really the actor. I was
sort of a musician — 1 played piano and vio
lin like every other Asian kid."
For the rest of his childhood, his involve
ment in theater was limited to playing in or
chestra pits and attending his older brother's
plays.
Then, in high school, Lee summoned his
courage and stepped out of the pit onto the
stage. As a senior, he won the lead in his high
school's production of "Joseph and the
Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat." The col
orful poster from the show hangs proudly as
the centerpiece of his dorm room wall —
even overshadowing the "Miss Saigon" plac
ard next to it.
"That was a huge experience for me," he
said. "The sensation of performing on the
stage — being able to express yourself
through the songs — was something that I
just immediately fell in love with. I can't real
ly describe it in words."
So Lee came to Stanford the following year
knowing that he loved musical theater — but
thinking he could never pursue it as a career,
he opted to go pre-med. He spent the sum
mer after his freshman year researching at the
City of Hope cancer institute in Los Angeles,
a positive experience except for one detail.
"It was so boring," he said. "It was

painstakingly boring and I found that my
only escape would be to come home ... and
1 would just play the piano and sing."
Lee returned to school that fall with a new
desire to sing and perform. At the suggestion
of some friends, he auditioned for Fleet
Street. Now a member for three years, he de
scribed the group as "one of the best things
that could have happened to me at Stanford."
was a friend from Fleet Street that
i Wconvinced Lee to go back to l.os An
geles the following summer — this
time to explore the entertainment industry.
He interned as a film production assistant —
"a lackey" — where he met actors and direc
tors and "got a feel for life in Hollywood."
In his spare time, he took a class sponsored
by the Fast West Players, the oldest Asian-
American theater group in the country. This
was Lee's first ever formal training in musical

theater.
Through the class, Lee met actress Sabrina
Lu, the person who encouraged him to try
out for "Miss Saigon."
In a phone interview from Los Angeles, Lu
recalled, "When I heard him sing, I asked if
he'd ever thought about doing (the part of]
Thuy. 1 le was just so perfect for it, vocally and
physically."
At the time, the only auditions were being
held in New York. Lee, who was headed home
anyway, decided to go for it — but he didn't
get the part. He came in second.
Encouraged, he tried again last winter
when the auditions swung through San Fran
cisco. They remembered him, but never
called him back.
In August, Lee was in Los Angeles again,
when "Miss Saigon" showed up — this time
to cast for its second national tour.
Lee gave it one more shot.

After surviving the first call backs, Lee was
summoned to New York to appear before the
"big wigs," including producer Cameron
Macintosh and composer Claude-Michel
Schonberg. The final audition, which lasted
all of three minutes, left Lee disheartened.
"Did they keep me in there for so short be
cause they knew 1 didn't fit the part, or my
voice wasn't fitting the part, or what?," he had
wondered.
Lee returned to Stanford and within a few
days the casting director called with the good
news.
"1 was ecstatic and I just ran out of my
room. I couldn't stand still and so I just ran."
January, Lee will leave tor re
i m hearsals in New York before the
tour opens in Seattle on March 26.
That makes this quarter his last at Stanford,
and while he expects to meet his psychology
major and distribution requirements, he'll
still be a few units shy of graduating.
Lee said that earning a Stanford degree is
definitely a part of his future plans. 1 le spec
ulated that he may be able to complete trans
fer units from the University of Pennsylvania
during the show's 18-week Philadelphia run.
However, Lee emphasized that, more so
than just the quest for a degree, he has always
seen "education out of the classroom — the
people you meet, the relationships, the expe
rience" as the most important part of his time
at Stanford.
Those who know Lee agree that he always
puts people first. "He really listens," Green
said. "Friends are definitely the most impor
tant thing to him."
Perhaps that's why Lee's friends are more
excited than he appears to be about what
sophomore Karen Brecher called his new
"celebrity status."
"I've started answering the phone as Mike's
roommate," Green joked, noting that they had
to tone down their answering machine mes
sage "because of all the agents calling."
When asked about his friends' enthusi
asm, Lee just shakes his head.
He knows that behind the excitement, an
actor's life is hard, and points out that an
Asian-American actor's life is even harder.
Nonetheless, Lee, who hopes someday to get
into film and television, believes it is the life
for him.
"This is my career," he said. "This is what
I'm going to try to sustain myself doing."
But Lee aims to do more than make a liv
ing— he hopes to make a difference, by con
tinuing his efforts to promote the Asian
American presence in the arts. Last year, Let
directed a show for the Asian-American The
ater Project at Stanford.
"I do strongly feel that Asian-American*
are under-represented on stage, in television,
and people (need to] become more publicly
aware that we are indeed here and we are in
deed Americans," he said. "Anything I can d»
to help promote that, I will — by showing m\
face, by doing roles that establish Asian-
American identity."
For now, he plans to pursue his career and
his goals one step at a time. Next summer, a
Broadway revival of'The King and I" is being
cast and Lee says he would love to be part ol
that show once again.
This time, maybe as more than a
princess. ■
