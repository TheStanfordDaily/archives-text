# George Winston, Tori Amos, NIN ... a pianist of eclectic influences, Michael Halaas strives to turn his music into self-expression

### Sangeetha Ramanujam 
Jn the liner notes of his new album, "Face
to Face," Michael Halaas writes, "People
facing themselves timidly and apologeti
cally and hoping someone else will say what's
got to be said. 1 wonder if at the time of their last
blink they will have realized the atrocity of their
apathy."
Here then is one man's attempt to say what's
got to be said — through music. There are
things that are important to him that must be
expressed through his playing, Halaas says.
Through his three albums released in as many
years and his performances on campus and in
the Bay Area, Halaas uses his extraordinary
musical talent to make his voice heard.
Hunched over the piano at a Stanford per
formance earlier this quarter, with perspiration
running down his face, 1 lalaas seems complete
ly lost in his music. When he does look up, he
seems almost ill-at-ease. 1 le's not exactly shy or
reserved but doesn't push himself forward ei
ther — perhaps because everything he wants to
say has already been said in his music. But his

smile is so friendly and open that, after a while,
any inhibitions go unnoticed.
When asked, he discusses himself frankly.
And he presents himself as a man so against all
things fake that it's easy to admire him — back
ing away from posing for photographs that
seem too phony, decrying nature music as not
his style because it's all been done before.
Although Halaas first began piano lessons at
the age of five and has undergone more than his
share of training in classical music, he claims he
is "not about technique." He's more interested
in using his art as a mode of personal expression
than adhering to any set of rules.
"The only reason I dig this stuff is because 1
want people to take it and make something of
their own, to provide others with an experi
ence," he says.
Listening to Halaas' music, it is evident that
he's succeeding. He's transformed sounds into
a powerful art form, capable of forcing listeners
to look deeply into themselves.
"1 like to make emotional connections,
4 u : ii..i

something that
people can share,"
he said. "I've gone
to Nine Inch Nails
concerts and seen
people stripped of
everything but
emotion." Halaas,
rather than playing
a particular type of
music, uses what
comes naturally to
express his emo
tions and evoke
them in others.
His talent
has been
i n 112 1 u -
enced by a variety of
artists such as
Metallica, Tori
Amos, Nine Inch
Nails, Indigo Girls,
George Winston,
Ani DiFranco and
Liz Story. Drawing
on these favorite
musicians, Halaas
has created a style
all of his own, al
though he's reluc
tant to classify his
music: "Sometimes
it's very hard and
driving like rock
and roll and at other
times, it's melodic
and slow. I'm more
about attitude than
style." After playing

the piano for much
of his childhood,
Halaas quit in high
school to become a
drummer in a heavy
metal band called
"Living Hell," yet
another addition to
his stream of eclectic
influences. He at
tributes his sense of
rhythm and playing
technique that often
involves banging on
the keys to this stint
as a drummer.

It wasn't until he
came to Stanford, however, that he took up the
piano again "because it was there." It was here
that he began to compose his own music. Al
though he also plays the guitar, Halaas prefers
the piano because "there's so much you can do
with it. Pianos respond. It's a very expressive in
strument." It is also here that, as a sophomore,
he first began to perform, attempting to bal
ance music and pre-med requirements.
After graduating from Stanford a year and a
half ago, 24-year-old Halaas now successfully
juggles his job at the Stanford Hospital along
with giving performances in the area and mak
ing records.
I lalaas views his music as a "semi-controlled
release of control. It's fun to expand it, to see
where it takes you." And by helping him chart
his own path in life, it seems to have taken him
very far.
"It means a lot to me. I'm generally sort of
pessimistic about myselfand music has defined
what it is that I want to do and has let me trust
myself more," he says."I feel strong about
where I want to go. And it's nice to have tangi
ble evidence of my own development."
Music, he says, is like a gift — a gift that he's
definitely sharing. There are times when he's
been playing that he's looked out into the audi
ence and seen people crying. "Once when I
played at a hospital, this blind woman came up
to me later and said that for the first time in
three years, she forgot that she couldn't see."
Moments like these mean the most to Halaas.
Fart of the reason he enjoys performing is be
cause it allows him to evoke such intense feelings
in others. Also encouraging, he says, is when
"people who I respect respect me back ... Ani
DiFranco telling me that she likes my music, the
tact that my manager who also worked with Liz
Story thinks my art is worth developing," he says.
"In the future, I want to keep writing and
pushing myself artistically, to go out and find
audiences. I want to really dig into myself."
The names of guitarist-singer DiFranco
and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails
once again come to his lips when he

speaks of his own aspirations. "They have such
clear direction. They take everything and
channel it into what they do," Halaas says. He
wants "to twist and turn in new directions," to
allow his art to lead him into different paths.
Although Halaas admits that some of the
pieces he writes will never be performed be
cause they were written for himself, he stress
es the importance of sharing with others. "You
have to be secure enough to give yourself," he
says. When listening to his music, it is appar
ent that he at least has found the strength and
security to express himself with few restraints.
Halaas' lack of limits has led to an intensely
personal collection of music. For instance, the
title track in his most recent album "Face to
Face" — released earlier this year — was his
own assertion of self-acceptance. "You never
really know how much noise there is in your
head until it's quiet," Halaas comments.
"When you're fighting with yourself, there is
no peace."
Written after a period of intense personal
turmoil in his own life, it's the result of Halaas
facing himself and coming to terms with the
aspects of himself that he likes and doesn't like.
"This piece doesn't bring about inner peace
for me but is intended to remind me that state
does exist, that it's all worth it."
The album contains another song "Self-
Portrait," which also expresses the process of
self-exploration. "It goes a lot of places," Ha
laas explains. "It's about me running towards
things, running away from things, and some
times just running ... scared. It's about me
fighting myself. I argue a lot with myself about
what I think 1 should be." Arising from these
two songs, as well as all of his others, is a por
trait of a man who is still discovering himself.
And while Halaas deals with his own self
discovery, he forces the rest of us to explore as
well, to face life and come to terms with it. As
his album art alludes to, it's the craft of a man
who "at the time of his last blink" will have said
something and who at least will have made an
attempt to shake us from our "atrocious apa
thy." ■
