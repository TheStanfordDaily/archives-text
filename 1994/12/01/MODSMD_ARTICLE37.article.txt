The Advocate
Dead White European (French,
15th-century) Male seeks exotic,
erotic, moralizing gypsy woman
whose pig's honor needs defend
ing. Bad British accent a plus, must
be willing to accept improbable plot
lines and threat of the Bubonic
Plague.
Sound like something you'd find in
the personals of The Daily Californ
ian? Try again. "The Advocate," writ
ten and directed by Leslie Megahey,
unites medieval France and cine
matography in a danse macabre.
Bullets Over Broadway
Woody Allen's latest film, "Bullets

over Broadway," manages to hit its
target, but fails to strike the bull's
eye. While the cast delivers genuine
and captivating performances,
Allen's heavy-handed writing seems
to cast a shadow over the whole
production.
The film is set in New York during
the 1920s and centers around the
world of gangsters and, believe it or
not, the theater. John Cusack ("Say
Anything," "Better Off Dead") stars
as struggling playwright David
Shayne, who has the uncanny abili
ty to write intensely deep plays that
flop.
The movie overall delivers a good bit
of humor backed up by excellent
casting and sincere dialogue. The
acting, however, gets bogged down
by extra subplots and Allen's over
written script. If slightly more charac
ter-driven rather than plot-based,
"Bullets" could have right on the
mark.
Clerks
In the no-budget, guerrilla-indepen
dent tradition of "She's Gotta Have
It"and the more recent "El Mari
achi," Kevin Smith's "Clerks" hands
out another slap in the face to studio
executives who prefer the conve
nience of judging talent by its price
tag.
Made for less money than the cater
ing bill for most major Hollywood
productions — $27,575 to be exact
— this black-and-white-shot venture
looks cheap, talks fast and plays
tough. Vile, remorseless and engag
ing all at once, "Clerks" is quite sim
ply the most audacious American

comedy to hit the screens thus far
this year.
Frankenstein
"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" is di
rector Kenneth Branagh's recent
monster creation. Branagh, the bril
liant director and thespian of "Henry
V" and "Much Ado About Nothing,"
brings yet another literary classic
alive on the silver screen. Branagh's
direction is stellar and electric. He
captures immense energy in his
film, using just the right combination
of special effects and melodrama.
"Frankenstein" is a Gothic tale of
blood, gore and romance, guaran
teed "to curdle the blood and quick
en the beatings of the heart."
Branagh himself stars in the lead
role of Victor Frankenstein, the intel
ligent yet slightly off-kilter scientist,
who experiments with electricity and
amniotic fluid to create a monster.
I Don't Wanna Talk About It
Most of "I Don't Want To Talk About
It" emanates a deceptively charming
glow as 67-year-old writer-director
Maria Luisa Bemberg unveils the
film's mildly unusual premise, set in
provincial 1940s Argentina. But, al
though the director is clearly after
the effect of magical realism to lift
her unlikely tale into extraordinary
realms, she relies too heavily on
aesthetic artifice and stops short of
weaving a genuinely mythical spell
over her creation.
Interview with a Vampire
Tom Cruise wanted to be taken seri
ously. Neil Jordan wanted to prove

he could compete on Hollywood's
home ground. Anne Rice wanted to
confound all involved by first pub
licly disowning the project, then
heartily endorsing it.
A case of too many personal egos at
stake and too little substance to hold
them together — "Interview With the
Vampire" ends up constipated on a
diet rich in pyrotechnical novelty,
but painfully lacking an emotional
center.
Oleanna
"Oleanna," directed and written by
David Mamet, is a screen adaptation
of the play which has caused con
troversy since its opening in 1992.
The movie, starring William H. Macy
as the professor, John, and Debra
Eisenstadt as the student, Carol, is
exceedingly loyal to the theatrical
version. John and Carol are the only
two characters with speaking roles,
and the changes between scenes
and acts are clearly delineated with
brief fillers (such as scenes of stu
dents walking down halls).
"Oleanna" is not an easy movie to
watch or think about. There is no
hero, no whirlwind plot. Yet, one be
comes fully engaged in the intrica
cies of the movie. "Oleanna" pos
sesses subtlety and assumes the in
telligence of its viewer. It forces the
viewer to make difficult judgments
about the characters and the issues
it raises. "Oleanna" is notorious for
leaving its viewers arguing about the
abstract concepts it embraces.
Pulp Fiction
It's good.

Road to Wellville
The sad thing is that I love movies.
Really. I can't think of a single movie
I've hated. But as I sat through "The
Road to Wellville" last week, the only
thing that kept me from walking out
of the theater was my job.
The film, directed by Alan Parker,
has an absurd non-plot centered
around creator-of-the-cornflake
John Kellogg (played by Anthony
Hopkins) and a controversial health
spa he developed around the turn of
the century. The primary teaching at
the Battlecreek Sanitarium is that
you can live forever by taking good
care of your digestive track. This
produces two hours worth of defe
cation jokes, like the sign hanging in
the spa's dining hall which reads,
"Clean bowels make for clean
thoughts." Though this course of
humor is plenty nauseating, its real
offense is that it just isn't funny. At
all.
The War
"The War" is a highly engineered vi
sual Hallmark® card tailored to
make mommies coo, cause your
mascara to run and melt your Junior
Mints.
Starring Kevin Costner and Elijah
Wood, this film does not show the
subtlety that underlies the actual
moral development these charac
ters supposedly go through.
Rather, it assaults you with a morali
ty lesson like an ABC After School
Special.
The Advocate

Rather, it assaults you with a morali
ty lesson like an ABC After School
Special.
The Advocate
Dead White European (French,
15th-century) Male seeks exotic,
erotic, moralizing gypsy woman
whose pig's honor needs defend
ing. Bad British accent a plus, must
be willing to accept improbable plot
lines and threat of the Bubonic
Plague.
Sound like something you'd find in
the personals of The Daily Californ
ian? Try again. "The Advocate," writ
ten and directed by Leslie Megahey,
unites medieval France and cine
matography in a danse macabre.
Bullets Over Broadway
Woody Allen's latest film, "Bullets

over Broadway," manages to hit its
target, but fails to strike the bull's
eye. While the cast delivers genuine
and captivating performances,
Allen's heavy-handed writing seems
to cast a shadow over the whole
production.
The film is set in New York during
the 1920s and centers around the
world of gangsters and, believe it or
not, the theater. John Cusack ("Say
Anything," "Better Off Dead") stars
as struggling playwright David
Shayne, who has the uncanny abili
ty to write intensely deep plays that
flop.
The movie overall delivers a good bit
of humor backed up by excellent
casting and sincere dialogue. The
acting, however, gets bogged down
by extra subplots and Allen's over
written script. If slightly more charac
ter-driven rather than plot-based,
"Bullets" could have right on the
mark.
Clerks
In the no-budget, guerrilla-indepen
dent tradition of "She's Gotta Have
It"and the more recent "El Mari
achi," Kevin Smith's "Clerks" hands
out another slap in the face to studio
executives who prefer the conve
nience of judging talent by its price
tag.
Made for less money than the cater
ing bill for most major Hollywood
productions — $27,575 to be exact
— this black-and-white-shot venture
looks cheap, talks fast and plays
tough. Vile, remorseless and engag
ing all at once, "Clerks" is quite sim
ply the most audacious American

comedy to hit the screens thus far
this year.
Frankenstein
"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" is di
rector Kenneth Branagh's recent
monster creation. Branagh, the bril
liant director and thespian of "Henry
V" and "Much Ado About Nothing,"
brings yet another literary classic
alive on the silver screen. Branagh's
direction is stellar and electric. He
captures immense energy in his
film, using just the right combination
of special effects and melodrama.
"Frankenstein" is a Gothic tale of
blood, gore and romance, guaran
teed "to curdle the blood and quick
en the beatings of the heart."
Branagh himself stars in the lead
role of Victor Frankenstein, the intel
ligent yet slightly off-kilter scientist,
who experiments with electricity and
amniotic fluid to create a monster.
I Don't Wanna Talk About It
Most of "I Don't Want To Talk About
It" emanates a deceptively charming
glow as 67-year-old writer-director
Maria Luisa Bemberg unveils the
film's mildly unusual premise, set in
provincial 1940s Argentina. But, al
though the director is clearly after
the effect of magical realism to lift
her unlikely tale into extraordinary
realms, she relies too heavily on
aesthetic artifice and stops short of
weaving a genuinely mythical spell
over her creation.
Interview with a Vampire
Tom Cruise wanted to be taken seri
ously. Neil Jordan wanted to prove

he could compete on Hollywood's
home ground. Anne Rice wanted to
confound all involved by first pub
licly disowning the project, then
heartily endorsing it.
A case of too many personal egos at
stake and too little substance to hold
them together — "Interview With the
Vampire" ends up constipated on a
diet rich in pyrotechnical novelty,
but painfully lacking an emotional
center.
Oleanna
"Oleanna," directed and written by
David Mamet, is a screen adaptation
of the play which has caused con
troversy since its opening in 1992.
The movie, starring William H. Macy
as the professor, John, and Debra
Eisenstadt as the student, Carol, is
exceedingly loyal to the theatrical
version. John and Carol are the only
two characters with speaking roles,
and the changes between scenes
and acts are clearly delineated with
brief fillers (such as scenes of stu
dents walking down halls).
"Oleanna" is not an easy movie to
watch or think about. There is no
hero, no whirlwind plot. Yet, one be
comes fully engaged in the intrica
cies of the movie. "Oleanna" pos
sesses subtlety and assumes the in
telligence of its viewer. It forces the
viewer to make difficult judgments
about the characters and the issues
it raises. "Oleanna" is notorious for
leaving its viewers arguing about the
abstract concepts it embraces.
Pulp Fiction
It's good.

Damn good.
See it.
Road to Wellville
The sad thing is that I love movies.
Really. I can't think of a single movie
I've hated. But as I sat through "The
Road to Wellville" last week, the only
thing that kept me from walking out
of the theater was my job.
The film, directed by Alan Parker,
has an absurd non-plot centered
around creator-of-the-cornflake
John Kellogg (played by Anthony
Hopkins) and a controversial health
spa he developed around the turn of
the century. The primary teaching at
the Battlecreek Sanitarium is that
you can live forever by taking good
care of your digestive track. This
produces two hours worth of defe
cation jokes, like the sign hanging in
the spa's dining hall which reads,
"Clean bowels make for clean
thoughts." Though this course of
humor is plenty nauseating, its real
offense is that it just isn't funny. At
all.
The War
"The War" is a highly engineered vi
sual Hallmark® card tailored to
make mommies coo, cause your
mascara to run and melt your Junior
Mints.
Starring Kevin Costner and Elijah
Wood, this film does not show the
subtlety that underlies the actual
moral development these charac
ters supposedly go through.
Rather, it assaults you with a morali
ty lesson like an ABC After School
Special.
