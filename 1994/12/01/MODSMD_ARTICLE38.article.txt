# from jazz to revolution
## Hip-hop pioneers digable planets 
### Story by Aïda Croal Graphic by Peter Lagerquist 
t was all very incidental. A guy
1 named Ish met up with another guy
called Knowledge who had been
kicking it with a tly girl who went by the
title of Mecca for sometime. It was quite
awhile later before the three donned the
code-names Butterfly, Doodlebug and
Ladybug and broke out with a hit hip
hop group.
It was really just like any old meeting,
Butterfly, the unofficial leader, will tell
you. At a college like, say ... Stanford,
you could meet someone over a delec
table dorm dinner, start hanging on the
basis of some randomly shared interests
and then go on to form a singing duo
that ends up smoking the charts, he tells
me. I ponder this one for the entire inter
view.
As for their name, it popped up as or
ganically as their original connection
did. "1 just wanted a different name," says
Ish after finally admitting to having put
the group together. "Dig-able. You know
the word dig, things that you can get into
easily like the old jazz shit. And then
Planets. At the time, I was listening to all
this '70s funk. And everybody was like,
on another planet, so that was it. 1 )igable
Planets. You know, like a jazz and funk
kind of thing.
History having been made howev-

er, every little detail is rele
vant. Anything that
could give a clue as to
how the trio accom
plished their meteoric
ascent into hip-hop hall
of fame...

ferreting out into the vastly unchart
ed territory of jazz-influenced hip
hop, 1993 saw Digable Planets hook
millions on a cool, symbol-laden yet
laid-back style of rapping that has since
become their trademark. "Reachin,"
their debut album, blew minds as breezy
horns instead of hard bass lines took cen
terstage as their musical vehicles of
choice. Here were two brothers and a sis
ter, definitely rappers, but they weren't..
. well, visibly angry.
They could get political — they did
name certain Supreme Court justices by
name as distinct menaces to society —
but the heavy symbolism combined with
their use of the Cool jazz, style made for
an intellectual, more than a neck-nod

ding experience. "The Rebirth ot Slick,
their horn-laced anthem, went gold and
catapulted the young group into insta
fame.
"Blowout Comb," their recently re
leased sophomore album is likely to es
tablish the trio solidly as hip-hop pio
neers. Collaborating with artists like
Guru and Jeru the Damaja, and making
use of all live instruments from the
stand-up bass to the xylophone, the
Planets have returned to the hip-hop
scene large and very much in charge.
Where "Reachin," was ephemeral
with its many interplanetary references,
"Blowout Comb" grounds itself in
Brooklyn, holding everything from
block parties and jam sessions to politi
cal rallies. Afro pick in one hand and mi
crophone in the other, the crew steps into
their new environment confidently. And
while critics might wonder at their deci
sion to switch gears, the Planets stand
their ground unwaveringly.
"It's not really a decision," says Ish
calmly. "Art is a direct interpretation of
life. People go through things. I mean,
Stevie Wonder's first song was called
'fingertips.' Then he went on to do songs
about legalizing Martin Luther King's
birthday. Marvin Gaye's first song, was

you know, he
was 'Hearing Ru
mors Through the Grapevine.' (sic) And
he went on to make one of the first polit
ical concept albums ever with 'What's
Going On?' Nobody goes up to him and
asks what happened. Everybody knows
what happened. It was the war that trig
gered him. And it's life that triggers us.
"No matter what we came out with, if
it would've been just like 'Reachin,'
everybody would've been disappointed,
they'd say it's all the same. If we'd've
come out with some gangster shit, it'd be
like 'Oh now they think they hard.' I
mean what can you do? Who cares?
These people arc wallowing with in
significance. It's just stupid. What good
would it do for us to do this? It's not like

everyone's going to love us all of a

sudden because we're revolu
tionaries now. That's stu-

pid."
Is it a strategic thing
though, the kinds of

messages you put
out in the first

album versus the
ones you put forth
now that you're es
tablished?

"Of course. It's a
total infiltration
of a record com
pany. The things

r / - c»
that we said on
this album
wouldn't have
been allowed

to be said on
the last one.
Without the
power of mak
ing some

record sales and
being popular,
they have no
choice but to release

a next album on you
no matter what you say

"People that sit around, people criti
cizing are reactionaries. I'm an Actionary.
1 make the action. Then they can sit
around and listen to things that we did
and talk about it. But so what? They still
ain't doing nothing. I'm still doing things.
The juxtaposition is heavily weighted on
the actionary side, no matter who it is."
do the Planets see themselves as rev
olutionary artists? Hell yes. But
isn't there a tension between art
and popular culture? I ask. Since,
whether you like it or not, popularity is
key in any kind of movement you'd get
involved with. Ish himself is still trying to
figure out how this actually works.

"It's hard to say," he begins.
"Cause Mao Tse Tung, in his
book on revolution and art,
said the job of the revolution
ary artist is to popularize as
well as raise the standards. Si
multaneously. I mean my art is
important to me, but we also
deal with messages in our
music. We deal with eleva
tion, we deal with issues
that concern the destruc
tion of the power of civi
lization and the power
structure and whiteness

and white supremacy here in
America. So, without that being

popular and heard you
know, what good is it?
Its like a hand-in-hand
kind of thing."
So it's basically about
strategy.
"Basically. 'Cause the

government and all the
things that are offsprings

of it like the industries
whether it be the tomato in-

dustry or the record industry,
they deal with subversion, they
deal with propaganda, so
that's what you're gonna

deal with when you tight
with them."
Ish is all about exam
ples and allusions. Ref
erences are his tools of
choice when trying to
communicate some
thing complex. When
I ask him about the

i connection between revolution and the
? kind of music he tries to create, this is his
I first tactic.
"I'm feeling like Huey Newton, at the
t prime of his revolutionary life, was an
improvisationist, like George Jackson
said. The revolution involves improvisa
tion. You have to know a situation, un
> derstand it, then you can attack it. As far
, as communication is concerned, rap
music is the only form of communica
tion to the greater majority of the mass
' es. Society has taught people not to read,
> not to seek information, to believe any
i thing they do read or happen to see on
t TV. This medium is so powerful that we
feel like operation inside of it is a must."
I was talking to Ice-T the other day ami
I he feels that his job is to get people ready for
> a time like revolution because he doesn't
think we're ready yet.
i "1 agree with that. To take action, you
have to have a mentality. You have to un-
J 4 J .L. t . > l_ .

derstand that you re about
to make a major sacri-

ficc, which might be
the ultimate sacrifice
which is your life.
Now you're not gonna
get the average moth-

crfucka these days to
do that. Whether

it's a college
student, a
drug dealer,
or some
body work-

ing at a deli on the corner, nobody
wants to stop living. Regardless of
whether they recognize the situa-

tion or not.
"More so than nega
tivity and positivity,
'cause I don't deal
with either of the two

cause one
doesn't
exist

without the other. I just try to deal with
reality. If you paint a desperate enough
picture, just like if you corner up a rat,
the rat knows that he can't go right or
left, he's gonna come at you now. And
we're just trying to get brothers and sis
ters to understand that we are in this cor
ner. On the walls it might be painted real
pretty, it may seem like we got places to
go but we're not makin' any progress."
What were the main influences in your
life that brought you to this point? Politi
cally anil musically.
"1 have to give it up to my mother and
father for being conscious people who
had hands on involvement with the civil
rights movement. As members of the
Black Panther Party, and being in alle
giance with the Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee and things of
that nature. So 1 grew up submerged in
blackness and struggle, and understand
ing that things weren't as they should
be."
• 112 you really get him talking, lslVll also
Itell you about the influence that au
thors like Bessie Head and Jorge Luis
Borges have had on him. In terms of
music, however, you don't have to go too
far.
"For Funk, I'd go with Parliament,"
says Ish without hesitation. "They're real
cool in terms of mixing other music.
Rap, I would probably have to say Slick
Rick. And jazz ... that's a rough one. I
like Sonny Rollins a lot, just as far as
lifestyle is concerned. His art always took

precedence over popularization. I mean,
I love a lot of cats, but... I like Sonny.
When did you decide that music was
the way that you wanted to go?
"It just grabbed me like that. And
after awhile, it was like, there wasn't any
thing else to do. I was definitely in that
stage where I wanted to be a rapper and
that's what I was gonna do."
How old were you?
"I would say I was about 18 when I
forsook all other things for the sake of a
rap career. And I didn't have the under

standing about politics and stuff that I
do now. Not saying that I have a good
understanding of it because it's so com
plicated and I have so much to learn, but
at that time, I wasn't on any political shit.
1 was definitely loving Public Enemy, but
there wasn't any form to my function."
What types of things did you do?
"I worked in the mail room, listened
to demo tapes, going to the clubs, getting
people coffee. I was just bursting, you
know, just checking out the whole scene."
What kind of dues do you think you've
paid to get as far as you have in this indus
try?
"I can't really look at it in terms of
paying dues. If you make a decision to try
to do something, then whatever you do
to accomplish that is your choice. And if
you don't accomplish it, that is also your
choice.
"1 hear a lot of people out there now
talking about who did or didn't pay their
dues. Well, you might be out there hus
tling and trying to get a deal and never get
signed hut just because you paid your
dues... maybe you're just not as good as
the next motherfucka who got signed.
This is a choice you make. Nobody asks
college students what kind of dues they
paid to get their Masters degree."
Besides the promotion of your new
album, what other projects are you all
working on?
"My man Knowledge just got a couple of
groups that he's working on. I'm work
ing on a couple groups. A rap group, and
a singer. So we're just doing shit like that,
producing. Trying to stay
busy."

this trio has come a long way. Back
from the far reaches of outer space,
Digable Planets has grounded their
operations in Brooklyn, where the just
the right combination of the crookish
and the communal converge, generating
an outlandish vibe that the crew dare not
disappoint. With a hectic year of growth
and productivity behind him, Ish stands
fiercely proud of the strides that he and
rest of the group's members have made.
"Like fingers on a hand," says Ish final
ly,"I represent for the whole crew." ■
