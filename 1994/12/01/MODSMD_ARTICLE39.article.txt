# Gothic 'Creatures' overly indulgent

The movie "Heavenly Creatures" opens
with a sequence of archival newsreel footage
which lovingly introduces various attributes
of pristine Christchurch, New Zealand. Then,
without warning, the scene jump-cuts to a
frenzied traveling shot of two teenage girls
stumbling through a patch of woods, their
blood-streaked faces quickly coming into
view.
With a brick wrapped in a stocking,
Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme have just
bludgeoned Pauline's mother to death.
In 1954, New Zealand's infamous matri
cide case shocked an entire nation. Director
Peter Jackson has decided that it is time to re
open closets and let the skeletons run free. Re
grettably though, Jackson also loses control in
the process.
Both having weathered disease-stricken

Heavenly Creatures

childhoods by the time they had met at the age
of 14, schoolmates Pauline (Melanie Lynskey)
ami Juliet (Kate Winslet) were powerfully
drawn to each other by their common pen
chant for fiction-writing, clay modeling and
bodily scars. Before long, they had created
their very own "Fourth World" in their heads,
where mythical unicorns roamed, gallant
princes ruled and favorite tenor Mario Lanza
would be saint.
The "Fourth World" constituted a desper
ate spiritual escape from existential misery
imposed by Juliet's negligent parents and

Pauline's tawdry working-class environment.
Yet, the state of shared bliss turns out to be
tragically short-lived: Juliet's tuberculosis and
her parents' imminent divorce conspired to
separate the two.
Finally, subject to the analyst chair by her
anxious mother (Sarah Peirse), Pauline was
pronounced to be harboring the condition of
"ho mo sex ua lity." The death knell to a re
markable friendship had been sounded.
Using a voice-over reading from Pauline's
actual diary entries, "Heavenly Creatures"
adroitly recreates a gothic realm of paternalis
tic repression and the transformation of quiet
victimry into violent furor. Both Lynskey and
Winslet ably lend a curious blend of winsome
charisma and twisted morality in fleshing out
their roles as tormented bosom pals.
Carrying over rather excessively from his

high-concept splatter
movies (e.g. "Dead
Alive"), writer-director
Jackson errs on the side

of over-indulgence in his attempts at bringing
the imaginary world of Juliet and Pauline to
life. While his characterization of grown-up
authority is often wickedly incisive, Jackson
has so much fun with the effects-laden Fourth
World Technicolor sequences that he forgets
to pull the plug before their tediousness begins
to grate on the viewer's nerves.
More troubling is Jackson's uncritical take
on Pauline's apparent scorn for her family's
working-class vulgarity and identification
with the 1 lulmes' gracious refinement. "Heav
enly Creatures" mostly fascinates as a fairy tale
turned sour â€” social credibility is all hut rele
gated to a paltry afterthought.
