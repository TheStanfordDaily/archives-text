# GSB grad in court to fight Navy's gay ban
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer with AP wire reports 
Encouraged by a recent ruling
that reinstated a gay man into the
Navy, former Stanford student Zoe
Dunning will enter the third day of a
trial before a military tribunal
today, hoping to prevent the same
institution from discharging her as
a lesbian.
The Navy began proceedings to
discharge the 31-year-old Dunning

— a 1993 graduate of the Graduate
School of Business — after she came
out at a rally in January 1993. Ac
cording to military policy at the
time, declaration of homosexuality
was grounds for discharge.
The new "don't ask, don't tell"
policy states that service personnel
can be homosexual but cannot en
gage in homosexual activity while in
the service. Dunning must prove in
court that she will not engage in
such activity.
Greg Bonfiglio, Dunning's

lawyer, argued yesterday in court
that making the statement, "I am a
lesbian" is not an indicator of con
duct.
