# GSB grad in court to fight Navy's gay ban
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer with AP wire reports 
Encouraged by a recent ruling
that reinstated a gay man into the
Navy, former Stanford student Zoe
Dunning will enter the third day of a
trial before a military tribunal
today, hoping to prevent the same
institution from discharging her as
a lesbian.
The Navy began proceedings to
discharge the 31-year-old Dunning

— a 1993 graduate of the Graduate
School of Business — after she came
out at a rally in January 1993. Ac
cording to military policy at the
time, declaration of homosexuality
was grounds for discharge.
The new "don't ask, don't tell"
policy states that service personnel
can be homosexual but cannot en
gage in homosexual activity while in
the service. Dunning must prove in
court that she will not engage in
such activity.
Greg Bonfiglio, Dunning's

lawyer, argued yesterday in court
that making the statement, "I am a
lesbian" is not an indicator of con
duct.


Zoe Dunning
Her lawyers plan to use another
recent development in the Navy's
policy on homosexuals to their
client's advantage.
Sonar operator Keith Meinhold
— who was discharged from the
Navy in 1992 after coming out on
national television — was recently
reinstated when the 9th U.S. Cir
cuit Court of Appeals upheld his
appeal. The Clinton administra
tion announced Monday that it
would not ask the Supreme Court
to overturn the reinstatement.
Meinhold said the deadline for
such a request passed last night, so
even though the government
already indicated that it would not
fde a request to get the measure
overturned, it no longer has that
option open anyway.
"I'm very encouraged by that,"
Dunning said. "I think it helps our
case."
Dunning's legal team has said
that the development in the Mein
hold case supports her side by
establishing a precedent in which
someone who "told" was reinstat
ed.
Lt. Cmdr. Jacquie Yost, San
Francisco Naval Base Public
Affairs officer, said a decision is
expected today after closing
remarks.
In opening statements, Bon

figlio presented a series of Dun
ning's evaluations to the tribunal.
The evaluations, including one
written after Dunning's public dis
closure of her homosexuality, were
all positive.
Witness Lt. Melna Jones, one of
Dunning's co-workers, told the tri
bunal that the unit supports Dun
ning.
"If anything, the evidence will
show that her public announce
ment has actually drawn her unit
together," Bonfiglio said at the
trial.
Another development the legal
team mentioned is that in the time
since Dunning came out, she has
been promoted to lieutenant com
mander, a move by the Navy that
"shows the insanity of the policy,"
she said.
"I suspect she'll win," Meinhold
said of the Dunning case, "not only
because of the specifics of the case
but also because of the specific
merits of Lt. Dunning's character."
He said the fact that "as an
openly lesbian Naval officer she
was promoted" is an indication of
"the job she's been doing all along,"
Though Meinhold was not sure
if his case would affect the current
trial, he and Dunning agreed that
recent events have set an impor
tant precedent.
Dunning called the outcome of
the Meinhold case "a ruling that
says that a statement alone is not
enough to discharge someone from
the Navy."
