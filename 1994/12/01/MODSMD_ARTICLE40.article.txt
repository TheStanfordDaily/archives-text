# Trekfest a technological feast for mind and eyes

Star Irek rocks.
Of course, one can take this reviewer's
word for it. Or one can read on.
For those doubting Thomases that still
haven't experienced the latest Trekfest, "Star
Trek: Generations," here's a plot summary:
As the latest in a series of seven trekkie
flicks, "Generations" unites three original
cast old timers with the new crew from the

T.V. series,
"Star Trek:
The Next
Gene r a -
tion." This
time re
tired Gapt.
lames Kirk

(William Shatner) and now-Capt. Jean-Luc
Picard (Patrick Stewart) must join forces and
battle mano-a-mano with Dr. Tolian Soran
(Malcolm McDowell), a talented scientist
gone bad.
Soran, whose family died at the hands of
the Borg (a part man, part machine race),
once again experiences disturbed peace
when the Enterprise (with Kirk at the helm
by default) transports him on board during a
rescue mission. Unbeknownst to the crew,
Soran has been unwillingly "rescued" from
the Nexus, an energy ribbon / doorway from
this universe.
Once inside the Nexus, beings are said to
never want to leave — beings create and live
their own joys, their own paradises. They can
relive the past or join the future. For these
reasons, Soran longs to return to the Nexus.
Naturally, there's a hitch. No one can sur
vive by traveling to the Nexus, the Nexus
must come to him or her. So Soran spends
the next 78 years perfecting a method that
can alter the path of the Nexus — he does,
but at the potential expense of millions of life

forms. It's up to Picard to stop the madness in
Soran's method.
Stunning graphics and killer action se
quences liven the silver screen, titillating the
audience to levels reached by the best adven
ture llicks. The Enterprise's wicked crash
landing alone is reason enough to check out
"Star Trek: Generations." Kven the stellar car
tography room sustains viewer interest,
thanks to 3-D computer graphics.
About the only weak link in the "Genera
tions" chain, is the subplot involving Lt.
Commander Data (Brent Spiner). When
Data decides to test-drive his emotion chip,
the ensuing sappy dialogue runs the cheese
factor right off the Velveeta counter.
Yet sap and silliness hardly detract from
the mind-bending questions posed by "Gen
erations," such as how could former Nexus

inhabitant Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) oc
cupy space both in the Enterprise and in the
Nexus? And how does Capt. Kirk imagine
and, thus, enter a future he's never seen?
Such is the nature of Star Trek — good fur
and great brain-teasing.
