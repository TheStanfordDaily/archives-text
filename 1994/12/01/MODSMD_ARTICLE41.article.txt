# Murder and sexually precocious 12-year-olds — 'Professional' a slick hit
## 
### Kristic Lü Stout 
The latest from French filmmaker Luc
Besson is slick. It's slicker than a turtle-waxed
Jaguar. It's slicker than a vat of lubricant. It's
slicker than rollerhlading clown a Jell-O slide.
Viewing Besson's "The Professional," like
slipping down a chute of lime flavored
gelatin, is a hyper-kinetic joy ride.
The film follows the story of Leon (Jean
Reno), an Italian "cleaner," or professional hit

man. The stoic Leon ex
ists simply to clean his
guns, clean the leaves of
his beloved plant and
clean away traces of cer
tain human targets.
Donning his pair of bad
ass John Lennon shades,
Leon hunts his prey and
executes his kills with
surgical precision.
Now, before you catego
rize "The Professional"
as just another point

screens

The Professional

and-shoot action flick, Besson adds a compli
cating factor.
Leon's solitary and highly-structured exis
tence is suddenly overturned when a 12-year
old girl slips under his dead-bolt lock and into
his life. With no one else to turn to, Mathilda
(Nathalie Portman) is forced to take refuge in
Leon's apartment after a corrupt PEA boss
(Gary Oldman) murders her family. Leon,
who has never had a reason to care for anything
other than his plant, awkwardly begins to pro
vide for Mathilda and a makeshift father
daughter bond begins to form.
Before any connections to "Punky Brew
ster" are made, I'll assure you that Besson
does not force any sentimentality into the re
lationship that develops between the orphan

girl and Leon. Actually, he does something al
together different.
Besson outfits Mathilda with a seductive
Louise Brooks haircut and a revealing tank top
(without a training bra). Not only do we see her
next to Leon admiring his gunmanship, we see
her next to Leon declaring her passionate love
for him. Also, at one point in the movie, the
young girl dresses up in black lingerie and im
personates Madonna in front of her protector.
This portrayal of the young orphan adds a
peculiar dimension to the relationship between
Mathilda and Leon, a dimension that, strange-

ly enough, makes the strength
of their quickly-formed at
tachment less contrived.
Although the director ob
viously strives for realism as
he illustrates the bond be
tween the hitman and the
young girl, Besson inten
tionally suspends reality
with his version of a nasty

antagonist. Playing the iiber-bad guy, Old
man melodramatically delivers bombastic
monologues comparing shoot-outs to
Beethoven's symphonies. As the gun-waving
1 )KA agent gone bonkers, Oldman delightful
ly comes across as a movie version of that cult
sitcom idiot from "Sledgehammer."
A certain illicit seductiveness pervades
"The Professional." Oozing with black
humor, taboo sexuality and highly-engi
neered stalking scenes, Luc Besson's latest ac
tion tlick is an intoxicating cocktail.
