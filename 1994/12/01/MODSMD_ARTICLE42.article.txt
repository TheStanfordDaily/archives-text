# JBL and Sha-key break into rap scene
## Aida Croal

I lip Hop rush at the Intermission office. We
got Spearhead, we got l.i'l I lalf Dead, Sha-key,
PM, and Jaz B. Lat'n. Being one of the lone rap
aficionados representing for the paper, life will
be rough this week.
A slew ot adolescent voices rush forth from
the speakers fast and furious. Tightly engi
neered music, a sprinkling of live rhythm in
struments and solid rhymes lay the primary
foundation for this groove. Who are these cats?
I figure I'd better focus on the young upstarts:
Sha-key and this Jaz B. Lat'n crew.
Jaz B. Lat'n (JBL) is a trio of hiply dressed,
smooth-faced young guys, or, as the self-de
scription goes, "Street Gamins." Their first
album is short but sweet introduction to their
budding musical prowess.
"Set it Off," kicks things offwith a hypnotiz
ing chant, set to some minimal piano chords
and percussion. This beat-replete anthem

"Street Gamins'
Jaz B. Lat'n

breaks down their vibe, while shaking their
thang. "I got soul and you can't have it/1 clock
you clock we clock (is/ abstract as a sycamore
tree/ JBL that's who we be/ you sniff blow?/ hell
no not me!"
Hell no not them. The three Ws, "Weed,
Whiskey and Women," form the tight core of
JBL's Spiritual Advisory Board. No blow to be
found.
"Boombatta," however, is tar and away the
best track on the album. Using a live bass to
thump out a funky bass line, live drums, and
sampled horns, this JBL manages to create

"Doompasaga"
Sha-key

their own spec ial brand of hip hop swing.
The production of "Street Gamins" is dead
on. With their musically adventurous nature
no song sounds like the next — there's no
telling where they'll end up.
Sha-key is on a completely different level.
She is a poet with a voice like Me' Shell Nde
geOcello and the sensibility to match. Her
rhymes reflect the harsh circumstances of
ghetto life, but a feral spirit and driving impro
visational energy separate her from the boys.
While Jaz B. Lat'n's tight musical production
seems not to have been controlled by the trio

themselves, there is an
obvious organic con
nection Sha-key's po- ■
etry and the music
upon which it rides.
The stuff is absolute
ly fierce.
"Doompasaga," a
perfect example of this
sistas capability to in
novate, begins with the
starkly ominous sound
of a lullaby. Whispers of
"get up get up get ...
wake up wake up wake
up .. " and a lonely sax

spins

r /
soon interrupt the reverie. Then a trumpet, live
percussion snatch the song into the jazzy be-



bop groove where it eventually settles.
In Soulsville, Sha kicks the reality tip.
"Its a sense of relief when you step on
your hlock/ but on your block you got the
gunshots/ first a quiet calm/ then like Viet
nam/ my sister killed 'cause her window
wasn't thick enough/ this is a nation Janet
lackson don't know jack about/ young girls
giving birth to a woman's world."
I his young sista will definitely be back.
