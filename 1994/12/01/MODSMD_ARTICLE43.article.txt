# Reviving old times
## Eagles classics outshine new tracks 
### 
"Hell Freezes Over," The Eagles' first release
alter what frontman 1 Jon Henley termed a " 14-
year vacation," will initially disappoint true fans
of the band — the first four new studio record
ed songs are so bad that you may tempted to
stop listening altogether.
Fortunately, however, the rest of the album
contains the hits that made them famous from
1972-1979, recorded live from their 1994 tour.
The band's successfully revived chemistry in
these classics manages to cancel out their pa
thetic attempts at new songs.
The four new tracks on "Hell Freezes Over"
fail to remain true to The Eagles' original sound
we all know and love. "The Ciirl From Yester
day," drones on like a country-western song on
a broken jukebox in a dirty bar.
"She doesn't count the teardrops/ That she's
cried while he's away/ Because she knows deep
in her heart/ That he'll be back someday" —
with lyrics like these, it should be put out of its
misery. So why does guy leaves the "girl from
yesterday"? Maybe because the song was so bad.
However, the re-recorded live version of
"Hotel California" begins with a beautifully
complex guitar solo followed by an addictive
backbeat that highlights the isolation and de
pression of the song. The live version is much
more intense than the original recorded version,
and proves beyond any doubt that the Eagles are
seriously talented.
Other songs like "New York Minute" with its
"Hell Freezes Over," The Eagles' first release
alter what frontman 1 Jon Henley termed a " 14-
year vacation," will initially disappoint true fans
of the band — the first four new studio record
ed songs are so bad that you may tempted to
