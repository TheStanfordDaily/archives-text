Singing, "Shove your features in the mud/
l et go of some of that precious blood," Chris
Knox could be describing the Tall Dwarfs'glam
our-tree approach to music-making.
Stripping pop down to its basics, the I )warfs'
new "3 EPs" collection delivers 18 warmly unre
fined melodies, combining simple, raw ele

of relationships, loss and identity. But the fall
Dwarfs see things through their own bent and
colorful lens, avoiding the one-dimensional
pessimism of many alternative acts, and pre
senting a uniquely warped satisfaction in the
face of bleakness.
The Tall I )warfs' knack for finding the bright

singer's own brain: "So it's fond goodbye/ To
neural paths I've walked for years/ To the cells

Luckily, throughout "3 EPs," the Tall Dwarfs'
synapses are in perfectly twisted working order,
as they holler, hum and whisper their way
through their own peacefully rocky emotional
landscape.
