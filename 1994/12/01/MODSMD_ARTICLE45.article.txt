# Strait dishes up plenty of heartbreak
## 
### 
With his latest release, "Lead On," country
music star George Strait maintains the sound
that brought him a lucky 13 years of success,
but also nourishes the popular conception
that the traditional country music tends to
center around overriding themes of rocky re
lationships and lost loves.
The album's title applies to Straight quite
well, as he continues to stand out as a leader
among country western artists. However,
being a leader involves both setting new trends
and perpetuating old stereotypes.
In "Lead On," Strait accomplishes the lat

George Strait

ter. Six out of 10 songs directly address the
issue of ruined relationships, while at least two
of the remaining four songs contain allusions
to love in turmoil. As a result, Strait comes
across as complacent, singing the words but
not truly feeling the sentiments behind them.
While his lyrics about love and sorrow carry
surface emotion, their sheer number detracts
from their ability to affect the listener at any
great depth.
1 iowever, for all the sap and stereotype, the
album has enough positive features to redeem
itself. Despite the fact that most of the tracks
address the usually depressing subject of end
ing a romantic relationship, "Nobody Has to
Ciet Hurt" takes a refreshingly optimistic
point of view, suggesting that although the
pain of breaking up is inevitable, suffering is
optional.
both "Adalida" — with its gently energetic
cajun beat — and "What am 1 Waiting For?"
— with its more classic country spice of wild
guitar twangs at the end of each chorus — are
fast, fun foot-stompers.
If forced to choose a favorite from among
only the mushier ballads, Strait's opening
"You Can't Make a Heart Love Somebody"
would win hands down. The song describes a
situation that is practically inherent to the
human condition and that only a fortunate
few never experience.
The true gem of the album, "The Big One,"
is well-suited to Californians, as it compares
falling in love toa Richter-bustingearthquake.
The metaphor holds true to life as the swingy,
upbeat song portrays love as a grand, uncon
trollable mystery without the colored judg
ment of one who has recently loved and lost.
There is no doubt that "Lead On," though
not shockingly excellent, is a good, solid
album. The only remaining question is
whether it is good enough to match its sib
lings, maintaining the artist's record of 18
"Strait" albums gone gold.
