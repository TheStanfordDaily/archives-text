"Dreaming in Color"
Songcatchers

Together, Lara Lavi, Arlie Neskahi, Mark
Cardenas and Charles Neville — the Song
catchers — join the ever-growing group of
musicians that endeavor to break down the
walls between music that reflect the societal
boundaries between people.
Their new album, "Dreaming in Color,"
juxtaposes Native American spiritual chants
and the many shades of African-American
music. At times the album becomes unfamil
iar, but several notable songs successfully
harmonize African and Native American
feels to produce highly spiritual music.
At their best, the Songcatchers hypnoti

tally lure the mind into the world of spirit,
and relax the body into a state of peace.
While this album could fit into the New Age
category, it tries to expand rather than close
down music consciousness with its cross
cultural style. Sometimes the Songcatchers
delve too deep into a pop-music sound in an
effort fit together different musical influ
ences, but this stretch can be attributed to
inexperience.
While the album at times sounds like two
completely separate music styles pieced to
gether, the group has potential to mate their
influences in a creation of a truly unique
sound.
In the song "Neon Sky," wispy saxo
phones, chime-like harmonics and modern
instruments underlie the fiery spirit of Na
tive American chants. The addition of Lavi's
lead vocals produces a mystical anachro
nism.

The album's second song speaks
of spiritual inheritance and the
moving on to higher places
through death with fusion jazz ac
companying ever-conscious-rais
ing Native American chants and
Lavi's vocals.
Two celestial gems, "Children's
Song" and "Dreaming in Color"
demonstrate the Songcatchers'
ability to transport and elevate the
listener to a state of peace within.
Perhaps the Songcatchers placed
"Dreaming in Color" last to indi
cate things to come, for the group
to yet unfold. Hopefully, the next
revealing will carry their fresh
ideas into a more refined album
with just as much spirit.

"Hash"
Hash

Intense musical collectives link with lis
teners, inspiring them to wig out, freak out,
mellow out or just chill out. Creativity is the
game, and the aim is to inspire.
The rest of the mediocre musical collec
tives who try to sell their music come and go
as quickly as a passing thought. While the
members of the trio Hash possess musician
ship, their musical talents unfortunately do
not take them past the point of being merely
another mediocre cock-rock band.
After listening to Hash's self-titled debut,
it becomes apparent that it is not merely a
pre-pubescent grind in the spirit of Beavis
and Butt-head, but a spirited effort that
reaches at least adolescence. "Hash" goes past
brainless, garage-angst songs, but does not
quite make it to thoughtful, interesting angst
songs. Their songs, driven by some solid bass
and guitar consist of random kindergarten
poetry on psychedelic meetings with mari
juana and mundane, nondescript experi
ences.
If Hash had a sound of their own, perhaps
the less-than-inspiring lyrics could be over
looked, but the group's musical identity cri
sis is amazingly annoying. Like a radio acci
dentally left on "scan," Hash cannot seem to
settle on one style and often ends up sound
ing like two different bands playing together.
In "American Chorus," Hash comes off
like a pre-school amalgam of Jane's Addic-

tion, Pantera and Metallica. "Mr. Hello"
showcases their musical ability to juxtapose
reggae, funk and grunge. Unfortunately, this
song sounds like a deliberate attempt at
genre mixing.
Half-hearted conceitedness does not a hit
song make. "Operation Herve" accents the
bass player like mustard on spaghetti while
the vocalist passes the time by singing, "In
deed the days were longer then/ Northward
bound from the garbage can/ Ori the outside,
looking in ... "
In addition to the short-term memory

loss, spatial disorientation and

misperception of time that

"Hash" causes, the

a I hum can also

cause one to lose

the motivation

to listen.

While it can

be fun once
in a while
for recre-

ation, the
CD will
likely end
4 I

up at the ]
bottom of a
dusty junk

drawer. If
you have a

Karaoke ma
chine with the

"vocal off" function

and have nothing better

to do, give this one a spin.

"Mighty Joe Moon"
Grant Lee Buffalo

Combine Pearl Jam, the Samples, and
Neil Young, and you get Grant Lee Buffalo.
The group's latest album, "Mighty Joe
Moon," encompasses everything from hard
rock with a classical twist to the mellower
sounds of acoustical folk rock.
1 Reminiscent of R.E.M.'s "Out of Time,"
the group incorporates a wide variety of in
strumentation from banjo to cello into its
songs.
The lyrics and acoustical guitar solos are
mesmerizing — perfect for those long
nighttime drives when you want to lose
yourself in your thoughts. The effect calls
forth the vast, lonely landscapes of the
Southwest and its multitude of isolated
one-stop towns.
The reflective aspect of Grant Lee buffa
lo's lyrics are truly poetic, especially in the
third track entitled "It's the Life." "You re
sent all of your trophies/ They belittle
human spirit like a timepiece/ That is tick
ing in your breast pocket/ And so you long
to reach in and stop it."

"Honey Don't Think," the 1 1th track on
this eclectic album, leads off with a moving
guitar solo followed hy lyrics that conjure
images of love along with differences that
become inconsequential with time.
Lead singer Grant Lee Phillips laments,
"Something wrong my stars/ Could you
look at my chart and help me heal these
scars/ Could you learn to read minds/ In the
case of mine do you read in the dark/ Honey
don't think you've laid up too long now/
Honey don't think you'll ever figure me
out."
The first track, "Lone Star Song," opens
with a complex electric guitar solo similar
to those made famous by Jimi Hendrix. The
rhythm invokes feelings of isolation, regret
and the open Texas prairies.
Even the lyrics sound regretful. "And the
angels are descending/ Like the wretched
said they would before too long/ Sing our
Lone Star song."
This album is representative of a talent
ed singer/songwriter who truly is able to
write and convey meaningful lyrics.
"Mighty Joe Moon" provides a refresh
ing departure from the superficial, synthe
sized, Top 40 mall music so often played
today. This CI) is certainly worth some of
your treasured college spending money.

"Stoner Witch"
Melvins

Like Big Star, Velvet Underground or the
Pixies, the Melvins are one of those bands
whose influence outstraps their audience.
Other groups who cite them as major influ
ences obtain massive popularity, but some
how that success never seems to make its way
back to the originators.
Everybody has heard of the Melvins. But
how many people have actually heard them?
For the Melvins, it's largely been a matter of
being in the right place at the wrong time.
They left their hometown of Aberdeen, Wash.,
for San Francisco in 1988, just about the same
time that the "Seattle scene" that would cata
pult Melvins protege and friend Kurt Cobain
to superstardom began to flourish.

And now that the melodic,
happy power-pop of bands
like Green Dav has

drawn the major
label feeding-

frenzy to the
Bay area, the

Melv i n s
bring us

their latest
release,
"Sto n e r
Witch,"
which is

about as far
from
1 J •

melodic
power-pop as

you can get.
With its

sludgy guitars,
heavy drumline

and tortured vocals,
"Stoner Witch" seems to

embody much of the Seattle

sound that the Melvins inspired (the real
Seattle sound, mind you, not this Candlebox
nonsense). If grunge was ever more than a
fashion trend, it was this — distorted, Sab
bath-y guitar licks, slow tempos and a plod
ding, sinister bass.
The tracks range from up-tempo, riff
heavy rockers to quiet, almost contemplative
tunes that suddenly erupt into noisy, distort
ed rage — call it "grungedelia." The Melvins's
influence on the rest of the Seattle scene is
readily apparent: a lot of the faster tracks are
reminiscent of early Soundgarden, before
they decided they were the I.ed Zeppelin of
the '90s. And the heavy basslines and sudden
jumps from soft to loud and back again
sound much like Nirvana, especially during
their "Bleach" era. These similarities may just
as well represent the Melvins emulating their
more successful friends, however.
Now that the fickle eyes of the music in
dustry have moved on and the most famous of
the Seattle bands have either changed their
sound or tragically ceased to exist, the Melvins
may once again find mainstream success elu
sive. Most of these tracks would certainly seem
out of place on commercial radio. But then,
judging by the fate of the other well-known
band from Aberdeen, maybe they should con
sider themselves lucky.

"Mighty Joe Moon"
Grant Lee Buffalo

Combine Pearl Jam, the Samples, and
Neil Young, and you get Grant Lee Buffalo.
The group's latest album, "Mighty Joe
Moon," encompasses everything from hard
rock with a classical twist to the mellower
sounds of acoustical folk rock.
1 Reminiscent of R.E.M.'s "Out of Time,"
the group incorporates a wide variety of in
strumentation from banjo to cello into its
songs.
The lyrics and acoustical guitar solos are
mesmerizing — perfect for those long
nighttime drives when you want to lose
yourself in your thoughts. The effect calls
forth the vast, lonely landscapes of the
Southwest and its multitude of isolated
one-stop towns.
The reflective aspect of Grant Lee buffa
lo's lyrics are truly poetic, especially in the
third track entitled "It's the Life." "You re
sent all of your trophies/ They belittle
human spirit like a timepiece/ That is tick
ing in your breast pocket/ And so you long
to reach in and stop it."

"Honey Don't Think," the 1 1th track on
this eclectic album, leads off with a moving
guitar solo followed hy lyrics that conjure
images of love along with differences that
become inconsequential with time.
Lead singer Grant Lee Phillips laments,
"Something wrong my stars/ Could you
look at my chart and help me heal these
scars/ Could you learn to read minds/ In the
case of mine do you read in the dark/ Honey
don't think you've laid up too long now/
Honey don't think you'll ever figure me
out."
The first track, "Lone Star Song," opens
with a complex electric guitar solo similar
to those made famous by Jimi Hendrix. The
rhythm invokes feelings of isolation, regret
and the open Texas prairies.
Even the lyrics sound regretful. "And the
angels are descending/ Like the wretched
said they would before too long/ Sing our
Lone Star song."
This album is representative of a talent
ed singer/songwriter who truly is able to
write and convey meaningful lyrics.
"Mighty Joe Moon" provides a refresh
ing departure from the superficial, synthe
sized, Top 40 mall music so often played
today. This CI) is certainly worth some of
your treasured college spending money.

"Stoner Witch"
Melvins

Like Big Star, Velvet Underground or the
Pixies, the Melvins are one of those bands
whose influence outstraps their audience.
Other groups who cite them as major influ
ences obtain massive popularity, but some
how that success never seems to make its way
back to the originators.
Everybody has heard of the Melvins. But
how many people have actually heard them?
For the Melvins, it's largely been a matter of
being in the right place at the wrong time.
They left their hometown of Aberdeen, Wash.,
for San Francisco in 1988, just about the same
time that the "Seattle scene" that would cata
pult Melvins protege and friend Kurt Cobain
to superstardom began to flourish.

And now that the melodic,
happy power-pop of bands
like Green Dav has

drawn the major
label feeding-

frenzy to the
Bay area, the

Melv i n s
bring us

their latest
release,
"Sto n e r
Witch,"
which is

about as far
from
1 J •

melodic
power-pop as

you can get.
With its

sludgy guitars,
heavy drumline

and tortured vocals,
"Stoner Witch" seems to

embody much of the Seattle

sound that the Melvins inspired (the real
Seattle sound, mind you, not this Candlebox
nonsense). If grunge was ever more than a
fashion trend, it was this — distorted, Sab
bath-y guitar licks, slow tempos and a plod
ding, sinister bass.
The tracks range from up-tempo, riff
heavy rockers to quiet, almost contemplative
tunes that suddenly erupt into noisy, distort
ed rage — call it "grungedelia." The Melvins's
influence on the rest of the Seattle scene is
readily apparent: a lot of the faster tracks are
reminiscent of early Soundgarden, before
they decided they were the I.ed Zeppelin of
the '90s. And the heavy basslines and sudden
jumps from soft to loud and back again
sound much like Nirvana, especially during
their "Bleach" era. These similarities may just
as well represent the Melvins emulating their
more successful friends, however.
Now that the fickle eyes of the music in
dustry have moved on and the most famous of
the Seattle bands have either changed their
sound or tragically ceased to exist, the Melvins
may once again find mainstream success elu
sive. Most of these tracks would certainly seem
out of place on commercial radio. But then,
judging by the fate of the other well-known
band from Aberdeen, maybe they should con
sider themselves lucky.

"Dreaming in Color"
Songcatchers

Together, Lara Lavi, Arlie Neskahi, Mark
Cardenas and Charles Neville — the Song
catchers — join the ever-growing group of
musicians that endeavor to break down the
walls between music that reflect the societal
boundaries between people.
Their new album, "Dreaming in Color,"
juxtaposes Native American spiritual chants
and the many shades of African-American
music. At times the album becomes unfamil
iar, but several notable songs successfully
harmonize African and Native American
feels to produce highly spiritual music.
At their best, the Songcatchers hypnoti

tally lure the mind into the world of spirit,
and relax the body into a state of peace.
While this album could fit into the New Age
category, it tries to expand rather than close
down music consciousness with its cross
cultural style. Sometimes the Songcatchers
delve too deep into a pop-music sound in an
effort fit together different musical influ
ences, but this stretch can be attributed to
inexperience.
While the album at times sounds like two
completely separate music styles pieced to
gether, the group has potential to mate their
influences in a creation of a truly unique
sound.
In the song "Neon Sky," wispy saxo
phones, chime-like harmonics and modern
instruments underlie the fiery spirit of Na
tive American chants. The addition of Lavi's
lead vocals produces a mystical anachro
nism.

The album's second song speaks
of spiritual inheritance and the
moving on to higher places
through death with fusion jazz ac
companying ever-conscious-rais
ing Native American chants and
Lavi's vocals.
Two celestial gems, "Children's
Song" and "Dreaming in Color"
demonstrate the Songcatchers'
ability to transport and elevate the
listener to a state of peace within.
Perhaps the Songcatchers placed
"Dreaming in Color" last to indi
cate things to come, for the group
to yet unfold. Hopefully, the next
revealing will carry their fresh
ideas into a more refined album
with just as much spirit.

"Hash"
Hash

Intense musical collectives link with lis
teners, inspiring them to wig out, freak out,
mellow out or just chill out. Creativity is the
game, and the aim is to inspire.
The rest of the mediocre musical collec
tives who try to sell their music come and go
as quickly as a passing thought. While the
members of the trio Hash possess musician
ship, their musical talents unfortunately do
not take them past the point of being merely
another mediocre cock-rock band.
After listening to Hash's self-titled debut,
it becomes apparent that it is not merely a
pre-pubescent grind in the spirit of Beavis
and Butt-head, but a spirited effort that
reaches at least adolescence. "Hash" goes past
brainless, garage-angst songs, but does not
quite make it to thoughtful, interesting angst
songs. Their songs, driven by some solid bass
and guitar consist of random kindergarten
poetry on psychedelic meetings with mari
juana and mundane, nondescript experi
ences.
If Hash had a sound of their own, perhaps
the less-than-inspiring lyrics could be over
looked, but the group's musical identity cri
sis is amazingly annoying. Like a radio acci
dentally left on "scan," Hash cannot seem to
settle on one style and often ends up sound
ing like two different bands playing together.
In "American Chorus," Hash comes off
like a pre-school amalgam of Jane's Addic-

tion, Pantera and Metallica. "Mr. Hello"
showcases their musical ability to juxtapose
reggae, funk and grunge. Unfortunately, this
song sounds like a deliberate attempt at
genre mixing.
Half-hearted conceitedness does not a hit
song make. "Operation Herve" accents the
bass player like mustard on spaghetti while

how many people have actually heard them?
For the Melvins, it's largely been a matter of
being in the right place at the wrong time.
They left their hometown of Aberdeen, Wash.,
for San Francisco in 1988, just about the same
time that the "Seattle scene" that would cata
pult Melvins protege and friend Kurt Cobain
to superstardom began to flourish.

And now that the melodic,
happy power-pop of bands
like Green Dav has

drawn the major
label feeding-

frenzy to the
Bay area, the

Melv i n s
bring us

their latest
release,
"Sto n e r
Witch,"
which is

about as far
from
1 J •

melodic
power-pop as

you can get.
With its

sludgy guitars,
heavy drumline

and tortured vocals,
"Stoner Witch" seems to

embody much of the Seattle

sound that the Melvins inspired (the real
Seattle sound, mind you, not this Candlebox
nonsense). If grunge was ever more than a
fashion trend, it was this — distorted, Sab
bath-y guitar licks, slow tempos and a plod
ding, sinister bass.
The tracks range from up-tempo, riff
heavy rockers to quiet, almost contemplative
tunes that suddenly erupt into noisy, distort
ed rage — call it "grungedelia." The Melvins's
influence on the rest of the Seattle scene is
readily apparent: a lot of the faster tracks are
reminiscent of early Soundgarden, before
they decided they were the I.ed Zeppelin of
the '90s. And the heavy basslines and sudden
jumps from soft to loud and back again
sound much like Nirvana, especially during
their "Bleach" era. These similarities may just
as well represent the Melvins emulating their
more successful friends, however.
Now that the fickle eyes of the music in
dustry have moved on and the most famous of
the Seattle bands have either changed their
sound or tragically ceased to exist, the Melvins
may once again find mainstream success elu
sive. Most of these tracks would certainly seem
out of place on commercial radio. But then,
judging by the fate of the other well-known
band from Aberdeen, maybe they should con
sider themselves lucky.
