## MATTHEWS BAND 
### JUSTIN POLLARD 
Who says you need a major label
and high-rolling promoters to
make it big? Not the Dave
Matthews Hand, which has made a huge
splash in the music scene thanks to a lot of

hard work, plent
of live shows
and thousands
of die-hard
fans.
Once upon a
time, every band

started out at the grass-roots level, gaining
fame and notoriety only after enlisting a loyal
local following. These days, the entertain
ment industry usually works from the top
down — promoting new artists nationwide
almost overnight through radio, MTV and
concert tours. But does the overwhelming
success of bands like the Grateful Dead,
I'hish and now the Dave Matthews Band sig
nify a return to a less commercialized tradi
tion of live music?
If the Dave Matthews Band's rapid rise to
fame is any indication, the answer is a re
sounding "yes." Having developed its own
unique sound and taken it on the road, the
group sold over 100,000 copies ot its self-re
leased debut, "Remember Two Things.'' After
signing with RO\, the band s second album
"Under the Table and 1 )reaming," debuted at
number 34 in Billboard magazine and is con
tinuing to sell rapidly.
Perhaps the Dave Matthews Band was not

promoted through traditional channels be
cause its innovative style defies labels. The
group's music contains elements of rock,
jazz, alternative, folk and R & B blended to
form an entirely new and enjoyable listening
experience.
According to Matthews, the band
"kind of grew out of a music scene in
a bar that I worked in. That was kind
of a central place for everyone. I.eroi
(Moore), who plays sax, and Carter (Beau
ford), who plays drums, used to play down
there once in a while when they weren't oil
touring around or playing in other bands.''
Bassist Stefan Lessard, who was in high
school at the time, used to perform at the bar
as well, Matthews said. Having learned on an
acoustic bass, he had not been playing elec
tric for long when the band first got together.
"[Violinist] Boyd (Tinsley] was down
there once in a while too," Matthews said, but
he "was not as much into jazz, which was the
kind of music they played there mainly."

Matthews said

he first ap
proached
Moore, Beau
ford and
Lessard and
"asked them if
they were interesi

ed in working on some kind of project with
me, and they were all like, 'yeah,' I don't think
necessarily with any idea of where we were
going or what we were going to sound like.
"A few months later when Boyd started up,
we hammered out some songs and got famil
iar with each other. And then [the hand] sort
of stumbled and fumbled, with all of us with
a certain amount of devotion to it, until we

had to give up our other projects after about
a year, a year and a half. Then we took it on
the road as much as we could and played as
often as we could," Matthews said.
One reason that the Dave Matthews Band

has such a unique
) style is that i t*
members repre
sent a wide spec
trum of musical
histories. "We
come from com-

pletely different backgrounds," Matthews
said, with roots in jazz, classical, folk, new age
and African and Latin music.
"I think we all have a very varied taste and
almost every type of music is represented in
the group — at least in our histories, not nec
essarily in the music," he said.
Matthews attributes his band's un
precedented grass-roots success
to "just playing all the time."
"Forcing ourselves on people, that's prob
ably the biggest part," lie said. "We initially
had a strong enough sound that we wouldn't
get booed off any stage that we were on
that helped." From there it was just a matter
of "taking that advantage and putting it in
front of as many people as (they) could," and
experimenting with their sound, "playing
anything, anywhere."
Bootleg taping at shows and spreading the
music around also contributed to the band's

success, Matthews said. He said it does not
bother him at all when people record his
band's music.
In contrast to his own style, mainstream
popular music "tends to be homogenized,
tends to be a very safe kind of music,"
Matthews said. "I think in a lot of ways it's
controlled by big business, not that that's
right or wrong." But "there's not a whole lot
of variety — there could be a lot more," he
added.
"Money has a lot to do with many of the
problems," in the music industry, and often
prevents people from "being able to see the
clear picture, the whole picture," Matthews
said.
"You don't see a lot of strange folk music
from other countries, and one doesn't get ex-

posed to a lot of

he twisted
music that's
available any
where, even
here,"
Matthews

said. A lot ot

music, "because it doesn't fit into any of the
big categories," such as hard rock, funk, or
easy listening, "can't expose itself to a large
public," he added. "Really, a lot of the music
that's not exposed to a large public doesn't
want to be," but because mainstream music is
"so accessible, people miss out on a lot of
music that they really would get off on, if they
had the chance to hear it."

But this happens everywhere with
money, mostly in America," Matthews said.
"It happens everywhere in the world, but its
down to a fine art here," especially in politics
and business. "In politics, certainly, we're not
going to he hearing about the Labour Party
or the Social Democrats — even though they
might be running lor President, you'll never
hear about them because they don't have ten
billion dollars to get their face on the TV to
tell you how terrible the opposition is."
"In today's pop culture," in terms of both
music and politics, "if you just sit in your
room, as opposed to going out and searching
for alternatives ... your choices will be the
ones that have big business and money be
hind them," Matthews said. "But then who
knows, maybe our next album will be a really
cheesy, lame, seventies rock album."
Matthews said that the producers
from RCA did not change the
band's sound at all in the studio,
and were "completely uninvolved, which
was cool." At first "they came in and said one
or two things, and then we barked at them.
Bark! Go our way!" after which they no
longer meddled.
While there may not be an overt political
message in Matthews' songs, his subtle lyrics
and tone still convey a very powerful state
ment.
"I write what I think, and often it makes
no sense, which is when I'm most happy be-

cause then I don't have to say anything about
it," Matthews said.
In other cases, "I try to be serious but at
the same time avoid being judgmental — I
don't want to be preachy. So I guess in some
ways 'live and let live' might be a sort of un
derlying message of what I'm talking about,
but I wouldn't mind investing in a little bit of
anger, and seeing if I can find some more
frustration to be brought out," he said.
"I think about what I might think is in
justice, or I think about what I might think
is wrong, and 1 talk about what 1 think
could be improved — 1 guess if I think
about those things quite a bit ot the time
that they will rear their ugly heads in my
songs too, so 1 guess there must be some
kind of presence there, which I am not op-

posed to, he said.
"I'm a little bit opposed to being too judg
mental, but I have started to think I could
squeeze a little more angry, directed, 'who
are you' songs into my repertoire."
With a band as talented as Matthews', an
angry message could very well produce some
changes. ■
