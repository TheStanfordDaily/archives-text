to cheer about.

at The Marsh, 1062
Valencia St.in S.F.

Bay" and "Mommsen's Block/ Ben
jamin's Angel". This double-bill of one-act

ory in which an octogenarian and a younger
woman attempt to reconstruct the gap in time
between them. "Mommsen's Block" is an ab
stract, non-traditional drama which is de
scribed as "despair mixed with mordant

sings the chorus part In a performance of

fifteen minutes in the spotlight and according

swell," but the money for your ticket also ben
efits the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.

in S.F. Tickets range in price from $15 to $40
and are available through the Symphony Box

WED/7
■ For a look at the final and most
poignant work of artist Keith Haring,
check out "The Altar Piece." The bronze
and gold leaf altar possesses an electric and
almost transcendental quality as it combines
Haring's post-graffiti style with the ancient reli
gious art of altar carving. Various traditional
Christian images are reinterpreted by the artist
in this marvelous pictorial work. The exhibit will
be on display at the Palo Alto Cultural Center,
located at 1313 Newell Road, until February 5.

"Seasonal Help"
Is a collection of
comic pieces
that features

at The Marsh, 1062
Valencia St.in S.F.

available at the door and through Tresidder
Ticket Office: 725-ARTS.

group. They'll be playing with a special guest at

Messiah," In which the audience of 3,000
sings the chorus part In a performance of
Handel's Messiah. Not only do you get your
fifteen minutes in the spotlight and according
to the SF Examiner, feel your "atrophied heart
swell," but the money for your ticket also ben
efits the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.
The sing-along begins at 8 p.m. at Davies

and are available through the Symphony Box

■ For a look at the final and most
poignant work of artist Keith Haring,
check out "The Altar Piece." The bronze
and gold leaf altar possesses an electric and
almost transcendental quality as it combines
Haring's post-graffiti style with the ancient reli
gious art of altar carving. Various traditional
Christian images are reinterpreted by the artist
in this marvelous pictorial work. The exhibit will
be on display at the Palo Alto Cultural Center,
located at 1313 Newell Road, until February 5.
