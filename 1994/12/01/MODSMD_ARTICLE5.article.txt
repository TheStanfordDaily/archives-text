# Food Fight
## Roble residents find the food bad enough to boycott

Tired of oily Food Service eggrolls and stale Chee

Nearly two-thirds of Roble Hall diners are so fed
up with the quality of the dorm's food that they
protested yesterday by boycotting Roble Food Ser
vice and eating lunch and dinner elsewhere.
The walkout resulted in a meeting between the
boycott leaders and Roble Food Service manager
Chris Carr to address their complaints.
Usually, 200 people attend lunch and 225 people
attend dinner at Roble, according to Roble Hall Din
ing Services. Yesterday, however, hashers estimated

that about 70 people ate lunch and 80 to 100 people
ate dinner in the Roble dining commons.
Calling the boycott successful, sophomores Don
Coleman and Paul Manning — who organized the
protest the night before by distributing fliers to resi
dents urging them to eat at Florence Moore Hall —
met with Carr in the afternoon to discuss their spe
cific concerns.
In addition to generally bad-tasting food, some of
the 15 grievances listed on Manning and Coleman's
flier included: low quality meat, overcooked pasta
and vegetables, a shortage of staples like bread and
rice, and a meager supply of salad bar and yogurt se
lections.
