## Roble residents find the food bad enough to boycott

Nearly two-thirds of Roble Hall diners are so fed
up with the quality of the dorm's food that they
protested yesterday by boycotting Roble Food Ser
vice and eating lunch and dinner elsewhere.
The walkout resulted in a meeting between the
boycott leaders and Roble Food Service manager
Chris Carr to address their complaints.
Usually, 200 people attend lunch and 225 people
attend dinner at Roble, according to Roble Hall Din
ing Services. Yesterday, however, hashers estimated

that about 70 people ate lunch and 80 to 100 people
ate dinner in the Roble dining commons.
Calling the boycott successful, sophomores Don
Coleman and Paul Manning — who organized the
protest the night before by distributing fliers to resi
dents urging them to eat at Florence Moore Hall —
met with Carr in the afternoon to discuss their spe
cific concerns.
In addition to generally bad-tasting food, some of
the 15 grievances listed on Manning and Coleman's
flier included: low quality meat, overcooked pasta
and vegetables, a shortage of staples like bread and
rice, and a meager supply of salad bar and yogurt se
lections.
During the meeting, Carr said
he could redress some of their
complaints — such as the broken
toaster and the shortage of glasses
— immediately. He said that he
would talk to the cooks about the
other problems, such as the over
cooked fish and pasta.
"The only thing that I don't
like about this is the way Paul and
Don went about doing it," Carr
said. "If they had taken the time
to approach me then they would
have found that I am approach
able. I talked to them today and
their issues were addressed."
Coleman was pleased with the
quick response to the boycott, say
ing he expects to see some
improvement soon.
In addition, student food ser
vice representatives met later in
the day with Roble Food Service
management and Melanie Jones-
Carter, the Food Service supervi
sor for Housing and Dining Ser
vices. At the meeting, which was
scheduled before the boycott, rep
resentatives discussed many of
the same issues brought up by
Manning and Coleman
"It is no big secret that the food

at Roble i£ not as good as else
where on campus," Coleman said.
"We see how good the food is at
Flo Mo on the weekends and we
want the same quality that they
have."
Roble hasher Mary Colbig
agreed, saying that "Flo Mo has a
nicer salad bar and they have a
grill. They have a lot of choice that
Roble doesn't have."
Although many residents insist
that Roble has the worst food on
campus, Carr said that the com
plaints are exaggerated.
"The students perception of
the quality of food that we have is
not justified. All dining services on
campus buy from the same ven
dors," he said.
Previously, Carr has attempted
to address the specific concerns of
Roble residents by distributing
surveys at meal times and meet
ing with the food service represen
tatives from each wing. "It is not
possible to satisfy everyone's
demands," Carr said. "But we do
make an effort."
For example, he said, students
frequently request a wider variety
of breakfast cereals and salad
dressings, and in response to
these requests, Roble Dining Ser
vices now provides students with
eight types of salad dressing and
15 types of cereal.

But some students feel that the
improvements that have been
made are not enough, choosing to
eat their meals at Flo Mo on a
daily basis.
"I normally eat at Flo Mo for

lunch or dinner anyway," said
freshman Sof Elisofon. "I don't
know if the boycott is the best
thing to do. But the food here is
very bad and I thought that a
protest would make a change. I

was surprised to see so many peo
ple eating at Roble. I guess we
didn't make much of a point."
Yet many of the residents who
ate at Roble did not feel that the
food was bad enough to justify a

boycott.
"I think the food service does
an admirable job of meeting the
diversity of dietary needs," said
senior Joy Weinberg, "And the
hashers are friendly too."
Senior Jeff Meador agreed.
"You have to keep in mind that
food service is cooking for 300
people and they have to meet the
demands of 300 different tastes."
he said. "I don't dread going to
eat at Roble like some people d 0
Sure, the food here isn't great.
But I haven't eaten anywhere on
campus that makes me orgasm."
Other residents did not join
the boycott because they did not
feel that food service was to
blame. "I think that Roble food is
below the standards of the rest of
campus.
However, food service at
Roble is trying to make improve
ments," said junior Genevieve
Burch. "I think if we attack any
one it should be the University
itself because it seems that Roble
doesn't have the same facilities
that some dorms do."
Carr also felt that he was being
attacked over some issues that are
out of his control. "It came down
hard on me," he said. "We aren't
new like Flo Mo, so they might
have a little more variety but the
quality of the food is the same."
