# Fac Sen set to debate CUE report specifics
## Writing, language requirements up for discussion 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Almost two months after the Commission
on Undergraduate Education released its re
port, the Faculty Senate will ponder expand
ing the University's foreign language and
writing requirements today.
Under a recommendation by the senate's
committee on undergraduate studies, Stan
ford's writing requirement will be extended
so that students will have to take at least one
writing-intensive course in their major, in
addition to the current freshman English re
quirement.
The committee also proposes expanding
Stanford's foreign language requirement, so
that beginning with the entering class of
1996-97, students will be required to com
plete one year of college language instruction
or to pass a proficiency examination.
Currently, students can fulfill the foreign
language requirement by completing three
years of high school instruction. Last year,
only 137 first-year students had to take addi
tional language courses at Stanford.
Senators will not vote on the proposals at

today's meeting, but will instead have a gen
eral discussion about possible impacts of the
augmented requirements, said Biology Prof.
Robert Simoni, senate chair.
The senate steering committee — which
sets the senate's agenda — thought it would
help to discuss the proposals before voting on
them, Simoni said.
"We thought that these subjects need
some reflection," Simoni said. "We were con
cerned that if they came to the senate for a
vote without any prior discussion then some
people would feel uninformed."
The steering committee recommends that
a vote be held at a subsequent senate meeting
in January, Simoni said, and senators will de
cide whether to accept that recommendation
today.
Though senators probably won't have
"too many" concerns about the writing re
quirement proposal, the language require
ment recommendation may cause wider anx
iety among faculty members, Simoni said.
The new writing requirement in the
major should not be a problem because "it's
already pretty well imbedded in
our curriculum," said History Prof.
Nancy Kollmann, who chaired a
committee last year that reviewed
Stanford's writing requirement.
Students in many departments
already take writing-intensive
courses, she said.
The University's Writing Across
the Curriculum program (WAC)
presently supports more than half
the majors in the School of
Humanities and Sciences, Koll
mann said.
The new proposal would just
"enhance the WAC principle across
the University," she said.
She added that the increased
requirement would not place an
added "burden" on students
because departments would incor
porate a writing-intensive focus
into existing courses required for
the major.
History Prof. James Sheehan,
chair of the commission, said that
the language proposal may raise
some controversy because some

faculty members "are against more
requirements of any sort."
In addition, other faculty may
feel that "one year of language
instruction is not enough and only
a token amount," Sheehan said.
He said the financial impact of
increasing the language require
ment may also be a cause for facul
ty concern.
The cost of the augmented lan
guage requirement is "tough to cal
culate," he said, because it is
unclear how many students would
actually have to take language
courses at Stanford.
"The object of the recommenda
tion is to improve language profi
ciency, not to force students into
taking Stanford language courses,"
he said.
The commission's recommen
dation stemmed from the belief
among some that Stanford has one
of the weaker language require
ments among its peer institutions,
according to Spanish Prof.
Guadalupe Vald6s, chair of the
commission's subcommittee on the
language requirement.
"We're the only major institu
tion that doesn't have this require
ment," Vald6s said.
