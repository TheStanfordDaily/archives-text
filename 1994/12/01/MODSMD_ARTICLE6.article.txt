# Fac Sen set to debate CUE report specifics
## Writing, language requirements up for discussion

Almost two months after the Commission
on Undergraduate Education released its re

writing requirements today.
Under a recommendation by the senate's
committee on undergraduate studies, Stan

help to discuss the proposals before voting on
them, Simoni said.
"We thought that these subjects need
some reflection," Simoni said. "We were con

vote without any prior discussion then some
people would feel uninformed."
The steering committee recommends that
a vote be held at a subsequent senate meeting
in January, Simoni said, and senators will de
cide whether to accept that recommendation
today.
Though senators probably won't have
"too many" concerns about the writing re
quirement proposal, the language require

major should not be a problem because "it's
