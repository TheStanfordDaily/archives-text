## 
### Neha Gupta Contributing writer 
Meeting for the first time yesterday, the
newly formed committee to review the con
troversial Stanford Fund policy decided to
hold weekly meetings beginning Jan. 11 to
discuss the policy and possible alternatives.
The group, composed of students and
administrators, has until Feb. 15 to submit
a recommendation to the University presi
dent and provost, the University Cabinet
and the ASSU Senate for approval.
Unless the group's recommendation is
approved by all three groups, the new Stan
ford Fund policy — which is temporarily
suspended — will go into effect once again.
"Our challenge is to find a policy that
hurts no one and helps all whom are con
cerned," said committee co-chair Stephen
Peeps, associate vice president for develop
ment.
Yet Peeps added that the committee is
"not a policy-setting group. We don't have
any authority to create any policies. We're
just trying to review alternatives."

"I hope we'll give this
process a chance," said
Council of Presidents
member Vanessa Alvara
do, the other co-chair.
The committee mem
bers decided that until a
new policy has been set
tled upon, it would be fair
to return to the old policy.
"This meeting was

spent trying to understand the existing pol
icy. We weren't sure if everyone under
stood it," Peeps said.
According to Peeps, the next few meet
ings will still be "fact finding" and the
group will not know where it is heading
until January.
"There was no discussion of other alter
natives at this meeting," Peeps said.
As for the outcome, Peeps said, "Any
thing is possible at this point. We have all
agreed to be open-minded."
"We are all hopeful that we will come to
a quick agreement on the best course,"
