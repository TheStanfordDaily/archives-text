# Trekking with George Takei
## Star Trek's Mr. Sulu signs autobiography at the Bookstore 
### Pam Phan 
The story of one man's trek
through time, space and stardom
drew a crowd of about 200 people
to the Bookstore yesterday after
noon.
While actor George Takei of
"Star Trek" discussed his new au
tobiography, "To The Stars," fans
and admirers anxiously awaited
the opportunity to meet and speak
with the Starship Enterprise's
one-and-only Mr. Sulu.
Takei, a Japanese-American
who was placed in American in
ternment camps at the onset of
World War 11, addressed topics
ranging from his life as an Asian-
American actor to his experiences
with the other actors on the "Star
Trek" cast.
The '30s and '40s contain "chill
ing parallels with our times today,"
Takei said. California was swept
with a "get-rid-of-Japs move
ment," and now, he sees the same
racist mentality in Proposition
187, a measure passed during the
recent state elections which denies
social services to illegal immi
grants.
The World War II movement
against Japanese-Americans had a
profound affect on Takei's life.
"[lnternment campsl were a har
rowing experience for my par
ents," Takei said.

questionnaire and were labeled as
"disloyals" by the American gov
ernment, Takei's family was trans
ferred from Camp Rohwer in
Arkansas to Tule Lake in Northern
California, a camp heavily guarded
with tanks and machine guns.
Takei's mother renounced her
United States citizenship after the
government began a policy of denat
uralizing all those of "enemy ances
try." It was after this that his fami
ly was threatened with deportation.
"At a time when things looked
very dark, there was one person
who came to the aid of renun
ciants," Takei said. A San Francis
co attorney, Wayne Collins, helped
keep Takei's family off the depor
tation boat. "He gave me an under
standing of idealism and
strength," he said.

Takei identifies four "idealists"
in his life, three of them being
Collins, his mother and his father.
The fourth idealist was Gene Rod
denberry, creator of the "Star
Trek" series. In 1965, the "Star
Trek" pilot first came out, and
Takei landed the role of Mr. Sulu.
Takei said he saw the Starship
Enterprise as a symbol for the
"Starship Earth." The show
proved that if "we can tap into our
pluralism ... and be confident of
our own creativity," we can con
quer those unknown territories,
Tflkoi said
"Up until Star Trek," he added,
"Asians were cast in roles as comic
buffoons, servile menials, and 'the
villain.' "
Takei said he experienced no
discrimination on the set of "Star
Trek." Everyone was just con
cerned with "enhancing their own
roles," he said. There was "keen
competition" among all the actors,
and occasionally William Shatner's

"driving insecurity" led to "diffi
cult moments."
As an Asian-American actor,
Takei is confident. While Asian-
American entertainers have had a
long struggle, "I think we're get
ting there," he said.
"Up until now, our roles have
been defined for us Our stories
have been told for us," Takei
added. "[Now], we're starting to
tell our own stories in our own
voices."
Kenton Fong, a junior and
admirer of Takei, called him "an
Asian-American hero. He has tried
out new grounds in terms of Asian-
American opportunities in the
media and on the big screen."
So how does Takei feel about
the newest "Star Trek" movie,
"Star Trek: Generations"?
"There has always been a lure
about odd-numbered Star Trek
movies," he said. "This was an odd
numbered one. That's all I have to
say."
