### Pam Phan 
The story of one man's trek
through time, space and stardom
drew a crowd of about 200 people
to the Bookstore yesterday after
noon.
While actor George Takei of
"Star Trek" discussed his new au
tobiography, "To The Stars," fans
and admirers anxiously awaited
the opportunity to meet and speak
with the Starship Enterprise's
one-and-only Mr. Sulu.
Takei, a Japanese-American
who was placed in American in
ternment camps at the onset of
World War 11, addressed topics
ranging from his life as an Asian-
American actor to his experiences
with the other actors on the "Star
Trek" cast.
The '30s and '40s contain "chill
ing parallels with our times today,"
Takei said. California was swept
with a "get-rid-of-Japs move
ment," and now, he sees the same
racist mentality in Proposition
187, a measure passed during the
recent state elections which denies
social services to illegal immi
grants.
The World War II movement
against Japanese-Americans had a
profound affect on Takei's life.
"[lnternment campsl were a har
rowing experience for my par
ents," Takei said.
