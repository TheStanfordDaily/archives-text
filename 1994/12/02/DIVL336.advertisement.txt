differential equations, statistics ... and the
list goes on.
Mathematica isn't just fast—it's easy.
You'll start getting answers the moment you
type your first equation on the screen. And
Mathematica: The Student Bonk is included to
help you quickly through the basics of the
. -lOff®,
K°Z^"
program and beyond. It shows you
how to use Mathematica to solve equa
tions, make spectacular 2D and 3D
plots and graphs, and write reports
that will impress even your
toughest professors.
Students everywhere
approach math with a
whole new attitude when
they use Mathematica. So
treat yo rself to this Holi
