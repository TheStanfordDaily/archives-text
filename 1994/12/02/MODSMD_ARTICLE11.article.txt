# Sororities spread awareness of issues in women's health
## 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
Seven of Stanford's sororities joined forces yester
day to hold the first Women's Health Day in White
Plaza, where they provided passers-by with literature
and advice on a variety of women's health issues.
"We wanted to do something that would benefit
the entire women's community at Stanford," said
senior Lauren Pressman, president of the Intersoror
ity Council.
Sponsored by the ISC and the Office of Student
Activities, the new event is aimed at providing women
with a one-stop location, where they can learn about
specific women's health issues and the campus
resources available to them, Pressman said.
"We feel that Stanford has the resources but people
don't necessarily know about them," she said. "We
chose to do it here (White Plaza] because women pass
ing by would get a chance to stop by."
Each sorority chose a different aspect of women's
health for its booth. Issues included breast cancer
awareness, sexual health and healthy eating.
Breast cancer awareness is particularly important
because it is an "unaddressed issue for women of our
age," even though the best time for prevention is
between the ages of 20 and 40, said Melissa Paoloni,
president of Kappa Kappa Gamma.
In addition to informative literature on sexual
health and contraception, Tri Delta member Jackie
O'Leary was prepared to demonstrate how to use con
doms.
"This is kind of an attention grabber," she said
pointing to the prop she used for the demonstration.
"Are you stressed?" junior Melanie Charles asked

people approaching Sigma Gamma Rho's booth on
stress management. "Breathe deeply," she suggested.
The sororities spent the past two months obtaining
literature from different campus resources such as
Coweli Student Health Center, Counseling and Psy
chological Services and The Bridge.
Charles said people should use these resources as
well as the Center for Teaching and Learning, which
has quarterly classes on stress management.
The sorority members all agree the event is impor
tant because it brings attention to women's issues.
But they were also pleased to see the Greek system
working together.
"It's very beneficial to the Greek community in
that we are doing something positive," Charles said.
Pressman said she wants to make "Women's
Health Day" an annual event and possibly expand it to
include a speaker, a blood drive and cholesterol testing.
"I think there's a lot of potential for this event,"
she said.
Delta Gamma — which discussed sexual assault
and self defense at its booth — is already planning a
three-hour self-defense workshop for next quarter,
said senior Julie Hill.
Although the Women's Center did not participate
in this event, Felicia Lee, half-time coordinator of the
center, said the center would like to help them with
any similar future events.
"I think it's great to promote women's health," she
said.
With the recent drive to increase communication
between Stanford women's groups — following a
meeting of about 20 groups on Monday — Lee also
said she hoped that more groups might be involved in
a future Women's Health Day.
