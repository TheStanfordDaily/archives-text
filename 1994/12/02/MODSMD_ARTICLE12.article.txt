## GATT clears Senate hurdle 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A sweeping rewrite of world
trade rules cleared a key procedural hurdle in the Senate
last night that seemed to assure final congressional pas
sage of the agreement.
The Senate voted 68-32 to waive its own budget rules
that had required replacing lost tariff revenues over a
decade. Supporters of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade needed 60 votes to overcome the procedural
barrier to passing the 124-nation accord.
After the procedural vote, the Senate moved immedi
ately to consideration of final passage of the legislation.
President Clinton, badly in need of a congressional
victoiy to lift his battered fortunes following the Novem
ber elections, had worked throughout the day to con
vince wavering lawmakers to support the deal.
Retiring Democratic Leader George Mitchell noted
that the vote was the last one to be taken by the 103 rd
Congress and the last he would ever take in the Senate.
He said he was proud that his last vote as a senator was
"on a matter that will have significance for generations
to come."
Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole said his office
was still getting up to 2,000 calls a day protesting the
agreement. Dole said he had decided to support agree
ment, even with its flaws, because the alternative of

defeat would be far worse.
"The bottom line is we just can't isolate ourselves
from the rest of the world," Dole said before the Senate
began voting.
The 124-nation trade agreement cuts tariffs by an
average of 38 percent worldwide, and for the first time
extends GATT rules to such new areas as reduction of
trade-distorting agriculture subsidies, lowering trade
barriers in service industries, such as banking and
clamping down on copyright piracy.
It also creates a more powerful World Trade Organi
zation to referee trade disputes and eliminates the one
country veto that a losing nation could use to block an
adverse ruling.
Supporters said the agreement, by cutting the border
taxes Americans have to pay while at the same time low
ering barriers U.S. businesses and farmers face over
seas, would provide a tremendous boost to the U.S. econ
omy.
The Clinton administration estimated this would cre
ate a half-million new jobs and mean an annual increase
of $150 billion in U.S. economic growth a decade from
now, when the deal is fully implemented. That extra
growth would put $1,700 more a year in the pockets of
the average family, the administration said.
