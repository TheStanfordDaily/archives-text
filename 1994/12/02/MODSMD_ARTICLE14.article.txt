# Smoking linked to impotence
## 
### 
ATLANTA (AP) — Smokers are 50 per
cent more likely to suffer from impotence
than nonsmokers, the government said yes
terday.
Researchers at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention said the rate may be
even slightly higher, because their study
was based on men willing to acknowledge
the sexual disorder.
"It's more bad news for smokers," said
Dr. David Mannino of the CDC's National
Center for Environmental Health.
Researchers estimate that up to 10 mil
lion U.S. men are impotent and that half of
those cases are caused by such factors as
diet, diabetes, aging, alcohol and medica
tion. Smoking had long been suspected.
The study was based on a survey of 4,462
U.S. Army Vietnam veterans between the
ages of 31 and 49. Of that number, 1,162
said they never smoked; 1,292 said they

were former smokers; and 2,008 said they
smoked.
Among nonsmokers, 2.2 percent said
they suffered persistent impotence, com
pared to 2 percent of former smokers and
3.7 percent of current smokers. Researchers
said the difference in the rate of impotence
reported by nonsmokers and former smok
ers was statistically insignificant.
There would be a 68 percent difference in
the rate of impotence reported by smokers
and nonsmokers except that Mannino said
the risk dropped to 50 percent when other
factors such as drug abuse, race, age and
vascular disease were taken into account.
The report, published in the December
issue of the American Journal of Epidemiol
ogy, is the first to show that smoking alone
is a risk factor for impotence, said Dr.
Robert J. Krane, head of Boston University
Medical Center's urology department.
