Illegal aliens
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Illegal
immigrants must declare their status
when applying for emergency medical
services and pregnancy care through
Medi-Cal, under a ruling left intact
yesterday by the state Supreme Court.
Only Justice Armand Arabian
voted to review a lower-court decision,
which held the requirement was
authorized by state law and did not
conflict with federal law.
Four votes were needed for review
by the seven-member court. Justice
Kathryn Mickle Werdegar did not take
part in the vote, for undisclosed rea
sons.

The case arose before last month's
passage of Proposition 187, which
included a provision denying all non
emergency public medical services to
illegal immigrants.
In response to that measure, Gov.
Pete Wilson has ordered the cutoff of
prenatal care and the phaseout of long
term care for illegal residents, the two
state-funded non-emergency medical
programs for which they were eligible
before the initiative passed. But those
orders and most of the rest of Proposi
tion 187 have been blocked by a feder
al judge until a hearing Dec. 14.
Ferry sinks
MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A ferry

carrying close to 500 people collided
with a freighter and sank before dawn
today in Manila Bay, news reports and
the Philippine coast guard reported.
Some passengers were rescued by
the freighter, radio station DZRH
reported. A reporter in a plane over
the site said there were rubber rafts in
the water but said it wasn't clear
whether anyone was in them.
The vessels collided at 4:10 a.m.
(3:10 p.m. EST yesterday) near the
town of Maragondon, about 35 miles
southwest of Manila in Cavite
province near the mouth of Manila
Bay, radio reports said.
The ferry MV Cebu City sank 30
minutes later, the reports said.
