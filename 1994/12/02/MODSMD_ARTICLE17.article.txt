Administration still has
upper hand in decision
on alumni-giving policy

Anew alumni-giving
policy implemented by the
administration this fall
would have forbidden student
groups from soliciting funds from
alumni other than recent donors.
To benefit from alumni gifts, stu
dent groups would instead have
had to appeal to the Stanford Fund,
an unrestricted fund controlled by
the president and provost.
The policy unfairly harmed stu
dent groups who have built foun
dations of alumni support over the
years and gave the administration
a powerful carrot and stick with
which it could mold student groups
to conform to their own views.
Under pressure from student
leaders, the University last week
suspended the policy's effect on
student groups so a joint commit
tee of administrators and student
leaders can re-examine the policy
as it affects student groups.
But the administration and the
students who agreed to the
arrangement have adopted funda
mentally different approaches to
the committee's work. Students
view the committee as a way to
open dialogue and negotiate a fair
er policy. The administration,
however, has treated the commit
tee as a way to smooth rather than
question the policy's implementa
tion.
Before it can take effect, any
proposal the committee puts forth
will have to be approved by Presi
dent Gerhard Casper, Provost Con
doleezza Rice, the University Cabi
net and the ASSU Senate. If the
recommendation is rejected by any
of those groups, or if the commit
tee produces no proposal by Feb.
15, the Stanford Fund policy will
simply go back into effect.
In a power play worthy of
Machiavelli, the administration
has engineered an arrangement

that virtually guarantees the poli
cy's return.
If the committee drafts a plan
unacceptable to student groups,
the ASSU Senate could reject it,
but the Stanford Fund policy
would go back into effect and stu
dent groups would be in the same
straits as before.
The University will likely reject
any plan that compromises the
overall goal of the Stanford Fund,
which an administration memo
states is to "generate more discre
tionary funds for the use of the
president, the provost and the
deans" "where they determine the
needs and opportunities to be the
greatest." In other words, the
Stanford Fund aims to broaden
and extend the reach of the admin
istration's power to shape all
aspects of University life.
Any plan that preserves the
autonomy of student organizations
would necessarily run contrary to
that goal. So even if the review
committee manages to create a
proposal that is fair to student
groups, the administration will
likely nix such a plan.
But it may not even get that far
— it is unlikely that the committee
will come up with any plan at all
before the Feb. 15 deadline. Co
chair Stephen Peeps, who is associ
ate vice president for development,
said the committee will spend its
next few meetings "fact-finding."
By the time all the facts have been
found, no doubt, Groundhog Day
will have passed and the Stanford
Fund policy will he as good as back.
It seems that the Stanford Fund
policy or a close equivalent is a
foregone conclusion. Score one for
the University, zero for the stu
dents — but it's a shame they were
ever on opposing sides. If adminis
trators want to keep on playing
games, they can continue to stuff
the committee's straw man. But if
they truly want to deal fairly with
students, they should pledge to
permanently remove student
groups from the reach of the Stan
ford Fund policy if the committee
reaches no acceptable conclusion.
