## James J. Sheehan The
						two cultures at Stanford University 
### 
I TAKE MY title from
C.P.Snow's famous
lecture of 1959, in
which he discussed the
two cultures of scientists
and literary intellectuals,
into which he believed
"the intellectual life of
western society" was now
divided. I will use the
terms somewhat more

broadly than Snow does, to mean, on the
one hand, the culture of science and tech
nology, and on the other, of the social sci
ences and the humanities. Most readers of
The Stanford Daily will recognize at once
what I have in mind: it is the cultures of the
techies and the fuzzies.
Of course such a division is arbitrary and
inexact, more like the region between two
climate zones than the sharp boundary
between two states. Moreover, neither cul
ture is itself homogeneous. Nevertheless, I
-think that once all the~necessary qualifica
tions and exceptions have been noted, the
fact remains that much of the University's
intellectual life is divided by powerful
methodological, epistemological and, I
would argue, cultural differences between
the Sciences and Engineering on the one
side, and the Humanities and most of the
Social Sciences on the other. These differ
ences add up to two ways of teaching and
learning, two different academic cultures.
These differences are so self-evident and
apparently durable that we can easily forget
how recently they appeared. In fact it was
not until the 1830 sand 1840s that the
English word "science" was used to mean
knowledge about the natural world rather
than systematic knowledge of any sort.
Most other European languages preserve

this wider usage: the German word, "wis
senschaft," for example, includes history
and philosophy as well as chemistry and
physics. Throughout the nineteenth centu
ry, even as the differences between the dif
ferent disciplines became more apparent,
scientists and non-scientists shared a fairly
broad basis of common knowledge and a
good deal of mutual understanding.
The change came in the twentieth centu
ry: its cause was the increasing expansion
and complexity of scientific knowledge that
is so characteristic of contemporary society.
As the great physicist J. Robert Oppen
heimer wrote in 1954, this specialization of
science "is an inevitable accompaniment of
progress — yet it is full of dangers and it is
cruelly wasteful since so much that is beau
tiful and enlightening is cut off from most of
the world." Specialization is, of course, a
characteristic of all systematic knowledge; it
makes the communication across all disci
plinary boundaries more difficult. But spe
cialization has-a particular meaning for the
relationship between the two cultures since
it makes a great deal of what happens in the
culture of science inaccessible to those
unwilling or unable to commit themselves to
its full-time study. Scientists can — and do
— cross into the culture of the humanities
and social sciences; few humanists or social
scientists can or do move the other way.
The results of this are altogether unfor
tunate. Without some understanding of sci
ence, many of us are excluded from under
standing some centrally important things
about the world in which we live. It is diffi
cult for us to make informed decisions about
our own interests or about public policies. In
his Jefferson Lectures of 1972, Lionel
Trilling, a humanist of great distinction,
noted that in addition to these practical

problems, the lack of scientific knowledge
has other, no less lamentable effects. "This
exclusion of most of us from...the charac
teristic achievement of the modern age is
bound to be experienced as a wound given to
our intellectual self-esteem. About this
humiliation we all agree to be silent, but can
we doubt that it has its consequences, that
it introduces into the life of the mind a sig
nificant element of dubiety and alienation..
. ?" Am I wrong in suspecting that we hear
an echo of Trilling's point in the word
"fuzzy"?
The Commission on Undergraduate
Education has recommended the creation of
a new core course designed to introduce
non-scientists to the way scientists think
and work. This will be an ambitious and dif
ficult project, which will require a consider
able commitment of time and resources. If
done correctly, however, it would be an
important step toward helping those of us
outside the culture of science and technolo
gy understand its achievement and limita
tions.
In the meantime, we should all try to
cross the line between the two cultures as
often as possible. From these journeys into
the other culture, we can learn what alert
travelers always learn: new ways of looking
at the world, exotic facts, strange habits, dif
ferent attitudes towards life. But these
encounters with others will also make us
more aware of our own culture. If the
encounter with strangers is the traveler's
most immediate thrill, this deeper knowl
edge of the familiar is often travel's most
enduring benefit.
