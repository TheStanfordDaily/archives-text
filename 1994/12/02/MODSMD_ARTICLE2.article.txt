A Stanford freshman was robbed at
knife-point late Wednesday night in the
Stern Hall parking lot.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herring
ton said yesterday that the student es
caped the incident without injury. The
suspect "got him from behind and pushed
him to the ground and that was it," Her
rington said.
While Herrington said the police
would not release the student's name, he
did say that the victim was a male resi
dent at Stern.

The suspect first held a knife to the
student's throat and then absconded with
a watch and a neck chain after knocking
the student to the pavement, Herrington
said. The incident occurred at about
11:10 p.m.
The police have no suspects in the case
yet, Herrington said.
However, Herrington said that the vic
tim was able to provide a partial descrip
tion of the suspect. He was described as a
male about 5 feet 9 inches, 180 pounds
with a muscular build, wearing dark
clothing and white athletic shoes.
"We just think it was a random hit
where the individual just came in and . ..

was just waiting for the [student]," Her
rington said. He added that the suspect
may have been drawn to Stern because of
a party there at the time.
The student, however was returning
from off campus, Herrington said.
This type of crime is unusual on cam
pus, he said. "Usually we see only one or
two of these cases each year."
Even so, Herrington stressed that stu
dents should be aware that such crimes
do occur on campus.
"People need to be a little more cau
tious," he said. "Even if the lots are well
lighted, if there's nobody out there,
you're alone."
