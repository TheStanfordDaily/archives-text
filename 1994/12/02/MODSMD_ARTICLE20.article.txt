Daily article on Mormons misrepresented quotes

lAM WRITING in reference to the arti
cle titled "Campus Mormons Seek
Higher Education," which ran on the
front page of the Nov. 29 Daily. I looked
forward to reading this article because of
the pleasant interview I had enjoyed the
previous week. I was very happy with the
process by which it was conducted and felt
that many of my statements accurately
represented my beliefs as a Latter Day
Saint. Therefore, when I actually read the
article and my so-called quotes, all I could
do was laugh — it was so completely
ridiculous.
As I read through what I supposedly
said, I was embarrassed to learn that The
Daily's readership would be getting a
weird, sketchy picture of what I am as a
Mormon student at Stanford. Though I
did use many of the specific phrases as
quoted, they were merged into new sen
tences and put in such an inaccurate con
text that they were no longer my words
and therefore no longer represented me
and my beliefs.
For example, I was quoted as saying
that "I went to two [fraternity] parties
and got enough beer spilled on me, that I
realized it wasn't good for me." This quote
was truncated, leaving out the proposi
tions I received from drunken guys and

the general discomfort I felt when I was
there. As quoted, it sounds like the "evil"
temptation or presence of beer drove me
away. Rather, it was the fact that I don't
drink and therefore don't enjoy being
around large groups of drunk strangers.
It's not that I feel that these people are
evil or immoral because they drink.
Passing judgment on someone in that
manner is in direct conflict with my per
sonal philosophy. This quote is just one
example of a series of quotes that I feel
completely misrepresented my beliefs as a
Mormon. I was very confused when I read
them, considering my interview was so
positive; I thought that I had clearly stat
ed many things that were manipulated
later as they went through editorial chan
nels.
But, as I read through the article a sec
ond time, I saw the title of the series,
"Conservative Religious Students at Stan
ford," and everything began to come
together. I was interviewed with the
premise that I was a conservative religious
student, and therefore everything I said
was either taken directly as such or
manipulated to fit into that context. If I
had known that my interview was for this
specific series, I most likely would have
declined the opportunity, since I would

never put myself in that category. It is one
thing to speak of traditionally conserva
tive religions — though I question the use
of that word, with its attached political
connotations — but it is an entirely differ
ent issue to write about conservative reli
gious students, especially when they are
not told about this premise.
In addition, considering the questions
I was asked concerning homosexuality
and safe sex promotion, I felt that the
basis for writing the article was, "we need
to write about conservative Mormons, so
we'll ask them these questions and get
some good quotes to back up what we
want to say." Homosexuality, safe sex
and the so-called restrictions placed upon
us were portrayed as central issues to our
religion and to us as Mormons. Though
they do surface more often here at col
lege, they are in no way central to my
Mormonism.
Instead, my religious beliefs are com
pletely focused on Christ, his teachings,
his life and trying to direct my life in
accordance with these ideals. Religion is
not made up of blanket statements about
issues that, in this case, aren't even
prominent in its central message. Though
I understand that the article was not writ
ten with the intention of giving a doctrinal

outline of what we believe, it's goals were
not made clear to me when I was inter
viewed and this, combined with biased
editing, painted a very odd picture.
In conclusion, I like would to say that
my thoughts here are those of one Mor
mon Stanford student and do not repre
sent the Mormon religion or any Mormon
group on campus. I have no right to speak
for anyone but myself in this context. But
my thoughts are also those of a human
being who is now disillusioned with a
newspaper she once thought accurately
represented students and student life. I
am discouraged to learn that I must now
take everything I read in The Daily as sus
picious and wonder if other people are as
misrepresented as I was. I really hope this
is not the case, or if it is, that there is a
desire for change and a forum to work
within.
I am not writing this letter because I
am an outraged Mormon or because I
wish to point fingers and condemn anyone
— for I am more concerned and even
amused than mad — but because I am an
individual with desires to be heard and
understood. I would like to think that we
all have these same desires.
