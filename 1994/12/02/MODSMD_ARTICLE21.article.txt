# Mormonism is about emulting Jesus' life, not just abstinence

"Oh, you're Mormon. You're the ones
that don't drink alcohol. How strange!"
This is a typical comment I get when
people learn what church I attend. Many
students are curious about the Mormon
religion, which seems to have such strict
standards. Admittedly, it is our "odd"
customs rather than our beliefs that
make us stick out on a college campus.

Thus, it is understandable why The
Daily chose to focus on these issues in
the recent article on Mormons. Frankly,
however, I was disappointed that The
Daily allowed these unique practices to
be the sole theme of the article. Although
the views expressed were correct, The
Daily focused on a minor part of our reli
gion while ignoring the larger principles.
Those who take the time to learn more
will find reasons behind the actions.
It is not abstinence from pre-marital
sex and alcohol that makes us Mormon;
rather, it is our strong desire to be more
like Jesus Christ as we strive to emulate
His life and help those around us. The
Mormon religion, officially known as the

Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
Saints, has 13 Articles of Faith which
contain its main tenets. Our religion is
based on these statements.
Although we may stand out because
of our beliefs, Mormons recognize that
diversity among individuals is one of the
greatest blessings in this world. Our
beliefs may vary; our practices may dif
fer. The Mormon students here, howev
er, appreciate and ei\joy the friendships
and acquaintances we have made in the
Stanford community. So, the next time
you see a Mormon at a party, hand him
a 7-up and say, "So, you're Mormon."
