## Fighting the 'battel' but losing the war 
### 
OXFORD, ENGLAND
THE MOST COMMON sight this
week has not been of bleary-eyed
Oxford students stumbling out of the
library at midnight, searching desperately
for a double latt6 — even though it is the
last week of the term. At Oxford, the final
days of the fall quarter mean Christmas
dinners and drinks parties. So while there's
plenty of stumbling at midnight here, it is
caused by vodka, not Voltaire, and the
undergrads are decked out in prom-night
best, not sweatpants. This place has more
tuxedos than an Italian wedding.
Ah, the holidays. You would hardly
guess, from such scenes of merriment and
good cheer, that there is actually something
rotten in the city of Oxford — besides bad
egg nog. Across the university, students and
administrators are locked in nasty disputes
over "battels" — the fees each college
charges its residents for room and board.
The colleges say they have no money; as a
result, many of them have raised their fees.
The students say they have no money; as a
result, many of them aren't paying.
Most recently, matters reached the
breaking point at Pembroke College, one of
Oxford's poorest schools. Two weeks ago,
Pembroke students overwhelmingly voted
to withhold rent payments, until at least
next term, in protest of the college's raising

of battel rates. In a positively Dickensesque
turn, college administrators hiked beer
prices at the college bar, charged students
$50 for new meal cards, and canceled the
college's Christmas dinner. God bless us,
everyone.
But nowhere have the two sides collided
with more acrimony and bitter childishness
than at Somerville, the small, newly coed
college — and alma mater of the fallen Lady
Margaret Thatcher — on the university's
outskirts. The problems started out early in
the term, when the college withdrew an ini
tial proposal to increase battels by 2.8 per
cent over last year, then decided to charge
students 18 percent more. Student repre
sentatives negotiated that outrage down to
11 percent, then decided not to give the col
lege their money.
The subsequent sniping was both down
right foolish and spectacularly vicious.
Eighty-nine percent of Somerville students
voted to support a rent strike. They draped
their windows with protest banners —
including one hung by the college's 45 new
male students reading, "Men at Somerville:
But can they afford to stay?" which, paren
thetically, is as close to gender-role reversal
as one finds at Oxford.
Somerville officials struck back by refus
ing to deliver mail to students who failed to
at the very least pay their electric bills. In a
gesture of conciliation, student leaders pro

posed that the matter be settled by a duel at
dawn between the college and student body
presidents, or alternatively, a game of Laser
Tag. Though they declined that challenge,
the college's administrators — who also
happen to be its professors — finally gave in
to student demands in mid-November.
But things promise to pick up again in
the new year. One of Oxford's most storied
and wealthy colleges, Magdelen, has floated
the idea of a gargantuan 25 percent hike
next term At opulent St. John's college,
which makes the Manzanita dorms look
like, well, the Manzanita trailers, plans are
for a nine percent battel increase come Jan
uary. That's hardly good news for members
of other colleges, since St. John's, with its
$300 million and change in assets, ranks as
the richest school at Oxford.
The ruckus at Oxford coincides with gov
ernment plans to privatize the Student
Loans Company, which would turn jurisdic
tion over student aid to private banks, who,
perish the thought, might even charge
interest. Meanwhile, the government has
slashed paymentrfree student grant alloca
tions by 30 percent over the last three
years. It is little wonder that such grim rev
elations, coupled with rent rises at Oxford
and other schools, prompted 6,000 universi
ty students to protest through London two
weeks ago.
Or is it? True, strapped colleges at

Oxford are raising their battels at rather
steep rates. So what? With grants and
awards covering tuition, the battels are all
Oxford students have to pay the university,
and they still only amount to, on average,
about $500 per term. That also takes care
of paying for "scouts," the kind souls who
clean students' rooms and make their beds
every day. Besides, Oxford undergrads
seem to have endless resources of cash
available for "getting pissed" nightly at the
college bar. Listening to their complaints
about being a couple grand in debt inspires
about as much sympathy as, say, The Daily
does come special-fee time.
Then again, we Americans are more
wont to hear about the latest tuition
increases, sigh, send the bill to our parents
and then go rent "Reality Bites" and bitch
about how badly the Baby Boomers have
screwed up. Five hundred bucks a term has
Oxford students sacrificing their beloved
library time and taking to the streets, while
$25,000 has Stanford undergrads complain
ing pathetically about the prohibitive cost of
Snapple peach iced tea at Stern.
If we had any kind of mettle, we
wouldn't be complaining. We would be rais
ing bloody hell. Last year, when the Board
of Trustees approved the latest increase in
student tuition, they proudly patted them
selves on their multimillionaire backs for
limiting the hike to 2.5 percent above infla

tion. The Council of Presidents subsequent
ly patted themselves on their resume-pack
ing backs for earlier suggesting — in the
name of students, of course — a raise of
exactly that "moderate" size. When it was
discovered that the COP may have had
prior knowledge of the Board's intentions
and had effectively fibbed about their fore
sight, no one, from the ASSU Senate to The
Stanford Review, batted a lash.
I wonder how all the impoverished
Oxford students here would have reacted.
At a recent debate, members of the Oxford
Union discussed the merits of loans versus
grants. Midway through, an American
graduate student raised his voice. "Why
should I care about your debt," he asked,
with an undeniably Princeton-bred arro
gance, "when I have $60,000 in loans to pay
off back home?" To which one observer
responded, to uproarious applause, "Who
cares about you?"
The answer, of course, is that no one
does — not Stanford's administrative bud
get-cutting monolith, not America's fearless
new Republican do-nothings, and not even,
tragically, ourselves. Oxford may be fight
ing the battel, but we are drawing ever clos
er to losing the war.
