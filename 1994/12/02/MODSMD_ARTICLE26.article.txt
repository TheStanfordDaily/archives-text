						dance begins Spikers to battle Dawgs in NCAAs 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
The time has come.
Tomorrow afternoon at 1
p.m. in Maples Pavilion, the
second-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball begins
what it hopes will be a champi
onship journey through the
1994 NCAA tournament. The
Cardinal (27-1), top seed in the
West Region and recipient of a
first-round bye, will face No.
22 Washington (16-12).
The Huskies defeated
unranked Wyoming in four
games (7-15, 15-9, 15-4, 15-13)
to advance to Saturday's con
test. Washington, one of seven
Pacific 10 Conference teams to
receive a bid to the post-season
dance, is a team the Cardinal
has seen many times in the
past. Perhaps too many times,
according to Stanford head
coach Don Shaw.
"They're way too familiar,"
he said. "I can't stand to play
all these Pac-10 teams for a
third time."
The Huskies are a young
team that starts only one

senior. They are also a tall
team with five starters over 6-
foot-1. This group includes 6-4
sophomore outside hitter
Angela Bransom, the squad's
leader in kills and an All-Pac
-10 team selection. Junior out
side hitter Dragana Djordjevic
is the conference leader in ser
vice aces while freshman
Makare Desilets ranks third in
blocking.
"They're a tough team,"
Shaw said. "They can create all
sorts of problems â€” especially
with their serving and block
ing. They're a tough second
round opponent."
Washington opened its reg
ular-season conference sched
ule on the road at Maples
against Stanford back in mid-
September. That Friday, the
Cardinal swept the Huskies
15-8, 15-3, 15-6.
At home, Washington was
much tougher. On Nov. 18 in
Seattle, the Huskies, who had
beaten No. 3 UCLA at home
just two weeks earlier, forced
Stanford into a fourth game
