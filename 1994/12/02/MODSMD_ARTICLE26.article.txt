## The 						dance begins Spikers to battle Dawgs in NCAAs 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
The time has come.
Tomorrow afternoon at 1
p.m. in Maples Pavilion, the
second-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball begins
what it hopes will be a champi
onship journey through the
1994 NCAA tournament. The
Cardinal (27-1), top seed in the
West Region and recipient of a
first-round bye, will face No.
22 Washington (16-12).
The Huskies defeated
unranked Wyoming in four
games (7-15, 15-9, 15-4, 15-13)
to advance to Saturday's con
test. Washington, one of seven
Pacific 10 Conference teams to
receive a bid to the post-season
dance, is a team the Cardinal
has seen many times in the
past. Perhaps too many times,
according to Stanford head
coach Don Shaw.
"They're way too familiar,"
he said. "I can't stand to play
all these Pac-10 teams for a
third time."
The Huskies are a young
team that starts only one

senior. They are also a tall
team with five starters over 6-
foot-1. This group includes 6-4
sophomore outside hitter
Angela Bransom, the squad's
leader in kills and an All-Pac
-10 team selection. Junior out
side hitter Dragana Djordjevic
is the conference leader in ser
vice aces while freshman
Makare Desilets ranks third in
blocking.
"They're a tough team,"
Shaw said. "They can create all
sorts of problems — especially
with their serving and block
ing. They're a tough second
round opponent."
Washington opened its reg
ular-season conference sched
ule on the road at Maples
against Stanford back in mid-
September. That Friday, the
Cardinal swept the Huskies
15-8, 15-3, 15-6.
At home, Washington was
much tougher. On Nov. 18 in
Seattle, the Huskies, who had
beaten No. 3 UCLA at home
just two weeks earlier, forced
Stanford into a fourth game
before capitulating 15-9, 7-15,
15-8, 15-7.
"They didn't just take a game

from us," Shaw said. "They
played us tough the whole night.
They made us work for the win."
The Cardinal's home-court
advantage could turn out to be a
big plus against a team like the
Huskies. However, according to
Shaw, the fans have to make it

that way.
"We'll play hard no matter
what," he said. "But the fans can
give us that extra boost if they
come out to watch us."
The team is definitely eager to
play. After all, this tournament is
what it has been waiting for the
entire season.
"We worked all year long to
have a good record and to be the
top seed," said freshman hitter
Kristen Folkl. "Now that we're
here, we've picked up the intensi
ty and we're ready to go."
Shaw knows that this is exact
ly the type of competition his
squad wants.
"The players look forward to
these matches," Shaw said. "We
run a big-time program here and
these are big-time players.
They've played at the champi
onship level at all stages of their
game. The reason they play is to
win games and tournaments like
these."
Shaw believes that the desire
of the team will translate into a
solid performance on the court.
"Hopefully, our level of play
will reflect this," he continued.
The excellent record of play
that the Cardinal has put
together has already garnered
honors for some players. Folkl,
hailed by many volleyball publi
cations as "the recruit of the
decade," was the unanimous
choice for the Pac-10 Freshman
of the Year. While she was
happy to have her individual
accomplishments recognized by
the Pac-10 coaches, Folkl keeps
the emphasis on the team and
its quest for a national champi
onship.
"I'm very excited and very
honored that they would give me
this award," she said. "But in the
grand scheme of things, it means
less than some other things."
Folkl was also an All-Pac-10
selection, joining junior team
mates Cary Wendell and Marnie
Triefenbach. This is the third
time that Wendell, a second-team
All-American last year, has been
named to the Pac-10 team, and is
the second time for Triefenbach.
Stanford players also domi
nated the conference's All-Fresh
man team. In addition to Folkl,
setter-hitter Lisa Sharpley and
middle blocker Barbara Ifejika
were also selected.

round opponent."
Washington opened its reg
ular-season conference sched
ule on the road at Maples
against Stanford back in mid-
September. That Friday, the
Cardinal swept the Huskies
15-8, 15-3, 15-6.
At home, Washington was
much tougher. On Nov. 18 in
Seattle, the Huskies, who had
beaten No. 3 UCLA at home
just two weeks earlier, forced
Stanford into a fourth game
before capitulating 15-9, 7-15,
15-8, 15-7.
"They didn't just take a game

from us," Shaw said. "They
played us tough the whole night.
They made us work for the win."
The Cardinal's home-court
advantage could turn out to be a
big plus against a team like the
Huskies. However, according to
Shaw, the fans have to make it

that way.
"We'll play hard no matter
what," he said. "But the fans can
give us that extra boost if they
come out to watch us."
The team is definitely eager to
play. After all, this tournament is
what it has been waiting for the
entire season.
"We worked all year long to
have a good record and to be the
top seed," said freshman hitter
Kristen Folkl. "Now that we're
here, we've picked up the intensi
ty and we're ready to go."
Shaw knows that this is exact
ly the type of competition his
squad wants.
"The players look forward to
these matches," Shaw said. "We
run a big-time program here and
these are big-time players.
They've played at the champi
onship level at all stages of their
game. The reason they play is to
win games and tournaments like
these."
Shaw believes that the desire
of the team will translate into a
solid performance on the court.
"Hopefully, our level of play
will reflect this," he continued.
The excellent record of play
that the Cardinal has put
together has already garnered
honors for some players. Folkl,
hailed by many volleyball publi
cations as "the recruit of the
decade," was the unanimous
choice for the Pac-10 Freshman
of the Year. While she was
happy to have her individual
accomplishments recognized by
the Pac-10 coaches, Folkl keeps
the emphasis on the team and
its quest for a national champi
onship.
"I'm very excited and very
honored that they would give me
this award," she said. "But in the
grand scheme of things, it means
less than some other things."
Folkl was also an All-Pac-10
selection, joining junior team
mates Cary Wendell and Marnie
Triefenbach. This is the third
time that Wendell, a second-team
All-American last year, has been
named to the Pac-10 team, and is
the second time for Triefenbach.
Stanford players also domi
nated the conference's All-Fresh
man team. In addition to Folkl,
setter-hitter Lisa Sharpley and
middle blocker Barbara Ifejika
were also selected.
