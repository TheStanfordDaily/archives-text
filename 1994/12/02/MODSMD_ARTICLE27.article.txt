### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
Last Sunday, the Stanford men's
water polo team wrapped up its best
season since 1986 by defeating USC
in the NCAA championship final,
14-10 in Long Beach, Calif. The
NCAA title was the second consecu
tive for coach Dante Dettamanti
and his squad.
The Cardinal finished the season
at 27-1, with its lone loss of the year
a 12-11 overtime affair at the hands
of California. Stanford finished the
campaign by winning its final 21

matches. Included in the streak was
a victory at the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation tournament, a
success at Berkeley in the Big
Splash and the NCAA tournament
win.
Based on these achievements,
the league's coaches honored Cardi
nal senior Wolf Wigo by selecting
him as MPSF Player of the Year and
Dettamanti as MPSF Coach of the
Year.
For the first time since 1986,
when the Cardinal also won back
to-back NCAA titles by going 36-0,
Stanford was also league cham
pion. Prior to 1992, Stanford
competed in the Pacific 10 Con
ference.
Stanford amassed the best
record of the nine teams in the
MPSF, going 7-1 in designated
league matches. By virtue of its
record and its No. 1 national
ranking, the Cardinal was
named the top seed at the MPSF
tournament.
Unlike last year, when Stan
ford entered the league tourna
ment as the top seed before los
ing twice and being eliminated
from the championship round,
the Cardinal proved worthy of
its ranking, easily winning the
MPSF crown.
"It was really nice to have a
strong showing at the league
tournament," Wigo said. "We
wanted to prove ourselves and
show those teams that thev

weren't going to be able to beat
us at the NCAAs."
In the MPSF finals, Stanford
routed No. 2 USC, 17-7. Wigo,
who tallied 71 points in the year,
tossed in a career-best seven
points in that match.
The Cardinal met the Trojans
once more in the NCAA tourna
ment finals, and its dominance
over USC continued.
"I think [our strategy]
worked," Wigo said. "We didn't
have one of our great games, but
we were able to win."
Dettamanti, who has been
named Pac-10 Coach of the Year
eight times and NCAA Coach of
the Year four times, including in
1993, won his first MPSF hon
ors in the third year of the
league's existence.
"It's an honor to win it," Det
tamanti said. "This is the by far
the top league in the country."
For water polo, the MPSF
consists of Stanford, USC, Cali
fornia, UCLA, Pepperdine, UC-
Santa Barbara, University of the
Pacific, UC-Irvine and Lone

Beach St.
Since the NCAA began hold
ing a championship tournament,
MPSF teams have won all 26
national titles. The 1994 nation
al championship was Dettaman
ti's seventh and Stanford's
eighth overall.
"We had three goals at the
end of the season — to win the
league tournament, the Big
Splash and the NCAAs," Detta
manti said. "Winning the MPSF
tournament was the first big
step."
Wigo, who will likely become
Stanford's seventh four-time
All-American, is still a candidate
for National Player of the Year
honors. The first-team All-
NCAA tournament pick makes
him the first Cardinal to be
named MPSF Player of the Year.
The native of New York was
joined on the MPSF first-team
by senior Frank Schneider and
juniors Jeremy Laster and goal
tender Jack Bowen. Sophomore
Brian Wallin was named to the
All-MPSF second-team.
