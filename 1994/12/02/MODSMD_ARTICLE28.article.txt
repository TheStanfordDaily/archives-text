## Kaplan joins injured ranks; team can't surpass Tennessee defense 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
Stanford 69
Tennessee 105

There can be no doubt as to
which women's basketball team
should be ranked number one in the
country.

"We were outplayed in basically
every phase of the game," Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer said after
Tennessee thrashed the Cardinal by
a score of 105-69 last night.
The top-ranked Lady Volunteers
(3-0) dominated second-ranked
Stanford (2-1) in every statistical
category except for team fouls,
where the Cardinal tallied 33 as
compared to Tennessee's 27. Worse
for Stanford, senior center Anita
Kaplan played only 21 minutes
before leaving the game with a
lower back injury. The extent of the
iiyuiy is not yet known.
Even before the loss of Kaplan,
Tennessee controlled the inside
game. The Lady Vols out-rebound
ed the Cardinal by 21, 48-27. Ten
nessee even snared more offensive
boards than Stanford did defensive
ly, 19-12.
"Tennessee stresses rebound
ing," VanDerveer said. "They take
pride in rebounding. They were on
the offensive glass every time a shot
went up ... and they were getting
second and third shots."
Offensively, sophomore forward
Kate Starbird led the Cardinal in
scoring with 17 points while senior
guard Kate Paye chipped in 15. The
team, however, only shot 35 percent
from the floor and was sputtering
most of the time.
"Obviously, we're very disap
pointed with [how] our team
played," VanDerveer said. "Ten
nessee's defense was stifling. They
were pressuring people."
Another sign of Stanford's inept
ness offensively was the number of
assists the Cardinal garnered. Four
Stanford players recorded a team
high one assist.
It was easy for Lady Vols head
coach Pat Summitt to be pleased
with her team's play defensively.
"I'm obviously very proud of this
basketball team," Summitt said.
"We set the tempo early with our
defensive effort. [Front court play
ers! Dana Johnson, Pashen Thomp
son and Tiffani Johnson contribut
ed to our being able to play pressure
defense, preventing easy shots."
Tennessee had no problems
offensively, either. The Lady Volun
teers made an astounding 63 per
cent of their shots and over 70 per
cent from behind the three point
line. Senior All-American forward
candidate Nikki McCray led the
team with 21 points despite an
injured wrist. Tennessee saw five

additional players score in double
digits, including Tiffani Johnson.
Johnson, a freshman, recorded a
double double by garnering 12
rebounds to go with her 17 points.
"Rebounding, they were head
and shoulders above us. Defensive
ly, they were head and shoulders
above us. On offensive execution,
they were head and shoulders above"
us," VanDerveer said. "I'm not sure
what is going on out there."
The Cardinal freshmen are still
learning. Forward Olympia Scott
fouled out for the second consecu
tive game after posting five points
on l-for-6 shooting from the floor.
Scott led the team with six
rebounds. Heather Owen, slowed by
the ankle injury she suffered
against the Lady Raiders, scored,
eight points and grabbed two
rebounds while forward Naomi
Mulitauaopele scored seven points
but also committed four fouls in
only 11 minutes of play.
Bobbie Kelsey played most of the
game scoring seven points on 3-for
-8 shooting, including 1 of 2 from
behind the arc.
"It's an early game," said Van-
Derveer. "Hopefully, we'll learn a
lot from it. We're a young team and
we can improve a lot."
The game was never very close.
After Tennessee scored the opening
basket, Stanford only managed to
tie the game twice, tiie latter with
17 minutes, 48 seconds to go in the
first half when the score was 4-4.
The Lady Vols built a sue point lead
by the first TV timeout and
increased the margin to a high of 22
in the first half. At halftime, the
lights flashed Tennessee 51, Stan
ford 31.
In the second half, the Lady Vol
unteers continued to roll. The clos
est the Cardinal got to Tennessee
was 18 with 9:45 to go in the game.
From then on, the Lady Vols
outscored Stanford 34-16 to record
the largest lead of the game at the
conclusion
The Cardinal next travels to
Raleigh, N.C., to take on North Car
olina State. The Wolfpack features
senior guard Tammy Gibson who
averaged 17.2 points per game last
year in leading NC State to a 13-14
record. Gibson also recorded 9.4
rebounds per game despite being
only 5 foot 8. The Wolfpack returns
most of its starters from last year
including three others that aver
aged over 10 points.

coach Tara VanDerveer said after
Tennessee thrashed the Cardinal by
a score of 105-69 last night.
The top-ranked Lady Volunteers
(3-0) dominated second-ranked
Stanford (2-1) in every statistical
category except for team fouls,
where the Cardinal tallied 33 as
compared to Tennessee's 27. Worse
for Stanford, senior center Anita
Kaplan played only 21 minutes
before leaving the game with a
lower back injury. The extent of the
iiyuiy is not yet known.
Even before the loss of Kaplan,
Tennessee controlled the inside
game. The Lady Vols out-rebound
ed the Cardinal by 21, 48-27. Ten
nessee even snared more offensive
boards than Stanford did defensive
ly, 19-12.
"Tennessee stresses rebound
ing," VanDerveer said. "They take
pride in rebounding. They were on
the offensive glass every time a shot
went up ... and they were getting
second and third shots."
Offensively, sophomore forward
Kate Starbird led the Cardinal in
scoring with 17 points while senior
guard Kate Paye chipped in 15. The
team, however, only shot 35 percent
from the floor and was sputtering
most of the time.
"Obviously, we're very disap
pointed with [how] our team
played," VanDerveer said. "Ten
nessee's defense was stifling. They
were pressuring people."
Another sign of Stanford's inept
ness offensively was the number of
assists the Cardinal garnered. Four
Stanford players recorded a team
high one assist.
It was easy for Lady Vols head
coach Pat Summitt to be pleased
with her team's play defensively.
"I'm obviously very proud of this
basketball team," Summitt said.
"We set the tempo early with our
defensive effort. [Front court play
ers! Dana Johnson, Pashen Thomp
son and Tiffani Johnson contribut
ed to our being able to play pressure
defense, preventing easy shots."
Tennessee had no problems
offensively, either. The Lady Volun
teers made an astounding 63 per
cent of their shots and over 70 per
cent from behind the three point
line. Senior All-American forward
candidate Nikki McCray led the
team with 21 points despite an
injured wrist. Tennessee saw five

additional players score in double
digits, including Tiffani Johnson.
Johnson, a freshman, recorded a
double double by garnering 12
rebounds to go with her 17 points.
"Rebounding, they were head
and shoulders above us. Defensive
ly, they were head and shoulders
above us. On offensive execution,
they were head and shoulders above"
us," VanDerveer said. "I'm not sure
what is going on out there."
The Cardinal freshmen are still
learning. Forward Olympia Scott
fouled out for the second consecu
tive game after posting five points
on l-for-6 shooting from the floor.
Scott led the team with six
rebounds. Heather Owen, slowed by
the ankle injury she suffered
against the Lady Raiders, scored,
eight points and grabbed two
rebounds while forward Naomi
Mulitauaopele scored seven points
but also committed four fouls in
only 11 minutes of play.
Bobbie Kelsey played most of the
game scoring seven points on 3-for
-8 shooting, including 1 of 2 from
behind the arc.
"It's an early game," said Van-
Derveer. "Hopefully, we'll learn a
lot from it. We're a young team and
we can improve a lot."
The game was never very close.
After Tennessee scored the opening
basket, Stanford only managed to
tie the game twice, tiie latter with
17 minutes, 48 seconds to go in the
first half when the score was 4-4.
The Lady Vols built a sue point lead
by the first TV timeout and
increased the margin to a high of 22
in the first half. At halftime, the
lights flashed Tennessee 51, Stan
ford 31.
In the second half, the Lady Vol
unteers continued to roll. The clos
est the Cardinal got to Tennessee
was 18 with 9:45 to go in the game.
From then on, the Lady Vols
outscored Stanford 34-16 to record
the largest lead of the game at the
conclusion
The Cardinal next travels to
Raleigh, N.C., to take on North Car
olina State. The Wolfpack features
senior guard Tammy Gibson who
averaged 17.2 points per game last
year in leading NC State to a 13-14
record. Gibson also recorded 9.4
rebounds per game despite being
only 5 foot 8. The Wolfpack returns
most of its starters from last year
including three others that aver
aged over 10 points.
