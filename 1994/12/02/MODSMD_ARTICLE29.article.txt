## Wrestlers tangle with Cal Poly 
### Ratha Harntha Contributing writer 
Injuries are not simply a major factor when
two athletes get hurt right after another one
returns from an injury — they become a nui
sance.
That's the case for the Stanford wrestling
team as it heads into its first home dual meet of
the year against Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo this
Saturday.
Last weekend at the Las Vegas Invitational,
sophomore 177-pounder Roger Liu returned after
a neck injury to wrestle in his first bout of the
year. But during the invitational, sophomore
Ryan Barnes (158 pounds) hurt his knee. Sopho
more 118-pounder By Pham, who also injured his
knee, joined the injured list which already
includes juniors Jimmy Aguirre, Tod Surmon and
Sahlan Martin. Standouts Aguirre and Surmon
are both ranked in their respective weight classes
in the Pacific 10 Conference.
All of these injuries mean that half the team
that wrestles against Cal Poly will be substitutes.
"They really have to step up," said senior co
captain Jay Jackson. "It's the key to the match. If
they win their matches, it'll inspire the whole

team."
Making things tougher for the Cardinal, who
crushed UC-Davis in its first meet of the year on
Nov. 18, is the strength of the Cal Poly team.
"Davis was a good start," Liu said, "but Cal
Poly is a much tougher team."
"They match up really well with us," Jackson
added. "Everyone will have a tough match."
Junior Brian McBeth and freshman Jeff Grant
will replace Pham and Barnes, respectively, in
the line-up. Junior 134-pounder Ed Medina,
junior 150-pounder Jack Artman and freshman
Van Young at 167 pounds, who all filled in for
starters against UC-Davis, will also wrestle in the
place of starters. Junior 126-pounder Matt Cano,
Jackson, Liu. sophomore Bryan Vaniman (190
lbs.) and heavyweight Mark Neglay round out the
10 who will wrestle this Saturday.
The key to the meet will be Vaniman's and
Neglay's bouts. They both lost close matches to
their Cal Poly opponents at the California Open
on Nov. 13.
"If we win those matches, that will be the dual
meet for us," Barnes said. "This will be a battle."
"[Cal Poly] is one of the dominant teams [in

the conference]," said head coach
Chris Horpel. According to Hor
pel, the Cardinal is stronger in
the lightweights, but with the
injuries, Cal Poly has the advan

tage in the heavier weights.
"[The lightweights] are going
to wrestle better than we have all
year," Cano said. "The injuries
are definitely going to hurt us."
In the Cardinal's favor is the
home court advantage. The last
time Stanford defeated Cal
Poly, which was in 1991,
numerous fans showed up to

support the team. "The home
court really helped us a lot [in
1991]," Horpel said.
But it will definitely take
more than just the home court
to pull this victory out for the
Cardinal. "I think this meet is
winnable," Liu said, "but every
one has to wrestle perfect
matches with lots of heart."
