# CUE language ideas spark Fac Sen debate
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
Gearing up for its first real chance to take
action on the proposals of the Commission
on Undergraduate Education, the Faculty
Senate yesterday debated strengthening the
University's writing and foreign language re
quirements.
The language proposal drew the heaviest
criticism, while the commission's suggestion
to require a "writing-intensive" course in
every nuyor sparked relatively little con
tention. A vote on both proposals is expected
during the senate's next two meetings.
The commission's language proposal,
modified by the senate's Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies, would require students
to pass a language-proficiency test in order to
graduate.
To pass, students would have to demon
strate either a high level of reading compre
hension or a lesser degree of competence in
two separate "modalities" (reading, writing,
speaking and listening), Spanish and Por
tuguese Prof. Mary Pratt said.
