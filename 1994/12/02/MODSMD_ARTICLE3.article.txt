# CUE language ideas spark Fac Sen debate
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
Gearing up for its first real chance to take
action on the proposals of the Commission
on Undergraduate Education, the Faculty
Senate yesterday debated strengthening the
University's writing and foreign language re
quirements.
The language proposal drew the heaviest
criticism, while the commission's suggestion
to require a "writing-intensive" course in
every nuyor sparked relatively little con
tention. A vote on both proposals is expected
during the senate's next two meetings.
The commission's language proposal,
modified by the senate's Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies, would require students
to pass a language-proficiency test in order to
graduate.
To pass, students would have to demon
strate either a high level of reading compre
hension or a lesser degree of competence in
two separate "modalities" (reading, writing,
speaking and listening), Spanish and Por
tuguese Prof. Mary Pratt said.
Criticism came both from pro
fessors in technical fields who
were concerned with students'
workloads and from those who
feared the requirement would
divert attention and University
resources from broader priori
ties.
Statistics Prof. Brad Efron
complained that the proposal
would be "very expensive, espe
cially in terms of students' time."
He also contested the merit of
the requirement, which he said
would detract from students'
ability to pursue other intellectu
al interests.
"The real value of education is
not what you study but what you
think about," he said.
Chemistry Prof. Steven Boxer
objected to the lack of data on
how many students would have
to take foreign language classes
in order to pass the test.
"Shouldn't we at least find that
out before we vote on anything?"
he asked.
Proponents of the changes
responded to such charges by say
ing that the study of language is
fundamental to a "liberal educa
tion."
The resource strain would be
manageable, Pratt said. "We [lan

guage department facultyl see
[the proposal] as a challenge to
our departments, a shift in
emphasis and in our capabilities,
but one whose goals we share,"
she said.
Because it provides insight
into other cultures and into lan
guage itself, language study is
"as important a requirement as
any we could possibly imple
ment," Provost Condoleezza Rice
said.
The commission had recom
mended that either taking a year
of college-level study or passing a
proficiency test should be suffi
cient to satisfy the language
requirement.
Nevertheless, History Prof.
James Sheehan, who authored
the commission's report, praised
the modified proposal.
"Any kind of requirement we
could introduce does not bring
mastery of language" to students,
he said. Instead, it will make lan
guage study "a more central part
of undergraduate education for as
many undergraduates as possi
ble."
The current requirement,
which can be fulfilled through
three years of high school study,
sends students the wrong mes
sage because of its "scandalous
weakness," he said.
Sheehan also praised as "rea
sonable, sensible, modest and ...
uncontroversial" the proposal to

extend the University's writing
requirement, developed by a sen
ate subcommittee and adopted by
the commission.
History Prof. Nancy Koll
mann, who chaired the subcom
mittee, said the group approved of
current freshman English classes
as an "entry-level" introduction
to writing.
But, she said, the process of
feedback and revision in such
courses needs to be extended into
areas where students have a
greater intellectual commitment
— their major.
"We think that this is a doable
program," she said. "It's already
very widespread" in the School of
Humanities and Sciences, she
said, and existing required cours
es "could be redesigned rather
easily" in other areas of the Uni
versity.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll
complained about the commit
tee's lack of emphasis on evaluat
ing the "product" of freshman
English classes — students' writ
ing — but praised the program
for a "dramatic improvement" in
the quality of writing he has
seen.
In other business, the senate
heard a report from its committee
on libraries. Committee Chair
Carl Gotsch called for more facul
ty involvement in selecting the
journals to which the Universi
ty's libraries should subscribe.
