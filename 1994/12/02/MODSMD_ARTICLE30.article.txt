# Cagers to face Spartan youth
##

The more things change, the more they stay the
same. Saturday night's match-up between the
Stanford men's basketball team (2-0) and San Jose
State (0-1) should be a living testament to that.
Seeking to end the Cardinal's two-game winning
streak, the Spartans come to Maples Pavilion very
young and green, showing little resemblance to last
year's 15-12 team. San Jose State will feature a cast
of fresh faces, as it has only five returning players
from last year's squad that fell to the Cardinal 69-
58.
"We have a bunch of first-year players," said
Spartan head coach Stan Morrison. "I don't know
what to expect. We don't have any playing time
among our top four guards."
While Morrison may have little idea of what to
expect, there are a few things that the Cardinal
coaching staff knows will be the same.
"Stan will run a similar system to what he's
always done," said head coach Mike Montgomery.
"He'll play a certain style of basketball. They will
have good speed and quickness. They will be very,
very athletic. We had to play really well to win last
year. They will play really hard and be very tough
— and that's never going to change with Stan's
teams."
A key to last year's Cardinal victory was sopho
more point guard Brevin Knight's play. Ironically,
that was one of Knight's earlier games where he too
had much to learn, similar to what the Spartan
guards face this year. Knight may not have shone
statistically, but he did a masterful job in contain
ing and defusing some of that Spartan athleticism.
"That was one of the games where Brevin's
influence became obvious," Montgomery said.
"They had three senior point guards. Guys who
were very quick. Brevin really did a nice job in that
game of containing and controlling the tempo."
Joining Knight in the backcourt will be junior
sharpshooter Dion Cross, who through the first two
contests is averaging 21.5 points per game. Cross
will seek another encore tomorrow after having
been the Cardinal high-point man last year against
the Spartans with 21 points. The two will seek to
exploit a very young Spartan backcourt that will
rotate Tito Addison, Jahi Bacon, Brad Quinet and
Marmet Williams, all new players to the game of
college basketball.
"We can't let them get off to a start where they
think they can compete with us," Knight said. "I'll
probably put a little pressure on them just to see
how they can handle it. I'm not going to worry so
much about getting them out of their playing style
that I won't play like I usually play, but I'm going
to go out and pressure them and see what they can
do."
The Spartan's growing pains were readily appar

ent in their season-opener against Loyola Mary
mount, losing 79-59 with the Lions forcing 19
turnovers.

senior center Bart Lammerson
will seek to shackle the Spartan's
leader, center Mike Brotherton,
one of two returning starters. The
loss of forward Roy Hammonds to
a season-ending knee injury great
ly cripples the rest of San Jose's
frontline, which Loyola Mary
mount out-rebounded 42-32. The
rest of the Cardinal big men, espe

cially forward Andy Poppink who
is averaging 9.5 caroms a game,
should have a field day cleaning
the glass.
"It doesn't look like they have
many big guys," Poppink said. "I
would imagine that we could get a
good advantage on the boards.
From my position, I don't think
they have a very big three man, so
I hope I'll be able to get in and get
a lot of boards."
So while this Bay Area show
down may become another painful
step in the Spartan's learning pro

cess, it would surprise few to see a
probable cakewalk turn into a dog
fight. Knight, fittingly, is quick to
point out the vigor and ambition
that youth will bring.
"Their young guards are going
to come out and try to do the same
thing I did last year," Knight said.
"Everyone wants to make a name
for themselves, and the way to
make a name for yourself is to go
up against somebody who has
established himself already. I'll be
ready for them to come at me
hard, for everyone to come at me."
