Meeting for the first time Wednesday, the
newly formed committee to review the contro
versial Stanford Fund policy decided to hold
weekly meetings beginning Jan. 11 to discuss
the policy and possible alternatives.
The group, composed of students and
administrators, has until Feb. 15 to submit a
recommendation to the University president
and provost, the University Cabinet and the
ASSU Senate for approval.
Unless the group's recommendation is
approved by all three groups, the new Stan
ford Fund policy — which is temporarily sus
pended — will go into effect once pgain.
"Our challenge is to find a policy that hurts
no one and helps all whom are concerned,"
said committee co-chair Stephen Peeps, asso
ciate vice president for development.

Yet Peeps added that the committee is "not
a policy-setting group. We don't have any
authority to create any policies. We're just try
ing to review alternatives."
"I hope we'll give this process a chance,"
said Council of Presidents member Vanessa
Alvarado, the other co-chair.
The committee members decided that until
a new policy has been settled upon, it would be
fair to return to the old policy.
"This meeting was spent trying to under
stand the existing policy. We weren't sure if
everyone understood it," Peeps said.
According to Peeps, the next few meetings
will still be "fact Finding" and the group will
not know where it is heading until January.
"There was no discussion of other alterna
tives at this meeting," Peeps said.
As for the outcome, Peeps said, "Anything
is possible at this point. We have all agreed to
be open-minded."
"We are all hopeful that we will come to a
quick agreement on the best course," Peeps
added.
The policy, which went into effect Sept. 1,
limits student organizations to soliciting

donations only from alumni who have con
tributed at least once to that group in the past
five years. The policy's eventual goal is to have
student-group fundraising solicited through
the Development Office.
Unrestricted donations will be put into the
new Stanford Fund, from which funds would
be disbursed at the University president and
provost's discretion.
Student organizations complained, though,
that the new policy would limit their control of
their own budgets and give the University too
much power in determining the future of stu
dent groups.
In response, ASSU Senator Stephen Rus
sell proposed a bill which would set the ASSU
up as an umbrella fund-raising organization
for the student groups.
At this point, the administration agreed to
create a committee to review the measure.
Committee members include Peeps,
Alvarado, Russell, Deputy ASSU Senate Chair
Michael Choo, COP member Lisa Lee, Dean of
Students Michael Jackson, Director of Stu
dent Activities Nanci Howe and Stanford
Fund Director Nancy Wells.
