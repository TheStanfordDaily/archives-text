### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
In his report to the Faculty Senate
yesterday, University President Ger
hard Casper spoke about the recent
controversy surrounding the new
Stanford Fund polky.
The policy, which went into effect
Sept. 1, is part of an attempt to central
ize the University's fund-raising ef
forts. Approved by the Board of
Trustees in February, the poliqy is de
signed to minimize alumni solicitation
by student organizations by placing do
nations to student groups in a central
fund to be administered at the discre
tion of the University president and
provost.
