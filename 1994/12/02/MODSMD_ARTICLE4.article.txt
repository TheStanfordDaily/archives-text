# Casper addresses Fund Policy debate
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
In his report to the Faculty Senate
yesterday, University President Ger
hard Casper spoke about the recent
controversy surrounding the new
Stanford Fund polky.
The policy, which went into effect
Sept. 1, is part of an attempt to central
ize the University's fund-raising ef
forts. Approved by the Board of
Trustees in February, the poliqy is de
signed to minimize alumni solicitation
by student organizations by placing do
nations to student groups in a central
fund to be administered at the discre
tion of the University president and
provost.
But student organizations were
temporarily released from the
measure last week after several
groups spoke out against it.
The Development Office's find
ing that "alumni are getting too
many fund appeals from too many
sources at Stanford" was part of
the rationale for the policy, Casper
said.
The problem is that many
alumni who are "asked to give
everything .. . often in confusion
and frustration, end up giving
nothing," Casper said.
However, in recent weeks, a
number of student groups —
including The Stanford Review
and Stanford-in-Government —
have expressed concern that the

policy was implemented without
sufficient student consultation.
In response to intense student
lobbying, the administration
agreed last week to suspend stu
dent groups from the policy until a
newly formed committee can
review the measure.
Student concerns about inade
quate consultation stem from the
fact that the Development Office
"did not focus on the implications
that the Stanford Fund had on stu
dent organizations," Casper said.
"That was a regrettable over
sight of the kind that happens
from time to time in any complex
institution," he added.
But Casper maintained that
student input was considered, as
students serve on the trustee's
committee that examined the
Stanford Fund proposal last
spring.
When members of the Council

of Presidents told him about stu
dents' concerns during their first
quarterly meeting, Casper said he
encouraged them to take up the
matter with the Development
Office.
But when that process was
unsuccessful in resolving the prob
lem, Casper said the administra
tion "saw to it that discussions got
underway, which I hope will help
resolve this mess."
"In this [instance], as in gener
al, we look to the Council of Presi
dents and the ASSU as the chan
nel through which we trust stu
dents will work," he said.
He added, however, that he
wants "to be very clear that a per
son .. . who sets foot on the Stan
ford campus does not thereby
acquire the God-given right to
solicit alumni under the Stanford
name regardless of the institution
al priorities."
