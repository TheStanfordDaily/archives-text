# GSB grad Zoe Dunning triumphs in Navy trial
## Lesbian officer avoids discharge despite ban 
### Staff wire reports 
Despite Zoe Dunning's public declaration
that she is a lesbian, a Navy tribunal decided
not to discharge the former Graduate School
of Business student in an unexpected ruling
yesterday.
The board of inquiry decided unanimously
to retain the 31-year-old Dunning, a 1993
graduate of the GSB, because she proved that
she wouldn't engage in homosexual activity
while in the service.
Under its new "don'task, don't tell" policy,
the Navy allows service members to be homo
sexual as long as they don't engage in homo
sexual acts while in the service.
The case now moves on to Naval authori

ties and will eventually go to the Secretary of
the Navy.
Dunning was elated with the decision.
"I feel fantastic," she said. "This is won
derful news. This says you can make the
statement that you are gay and stand a
chance of staying in the service."
A Navy spokeswoman declined to com
ment on the board of inquiry's decision.
Despite the triumph yesterday, Dunning's
attorney Greg Bonfiglio was unsure whether
the decision would stand.
Bonfiglio said that he thought a mfgor fac
tor in the board's decision was Dunning's out
standing record. Colleagues testified during
the proceedings to her excellent performance
and how detrimental her discharge
would be to the Navy.
The Navy also promoted her to
lieutenant commander recently,

even after she had announced that
she was a lesbian. This, Dunning
said, "shows the insanity of the pol
icy."
"The message is you can be gay
or lesbian in the military and if you
do a good job, you'll be able to keep
your job," Bonfiglio said.
I Regardless of Dunning's excep

tional conduct, Navy prosecutors
said that they had to bring the dis
charge proceedings against her.
"We're not saying that Lt. Dun
ning is a bad person or an evil per
son because she made a personal
decision ... but the fact is it's not
acceptable within the Armed
Forces," Lt. Ingrid Turner said.

Prosecutors said that they were
not satisfied that Dunning had
shown that she wouldn't engage in
homosexual activity while in the
service.
This ruling along with another
recent decision sets the precedent
for determining how to interpret
the "don't ask, don't tell" policy.
