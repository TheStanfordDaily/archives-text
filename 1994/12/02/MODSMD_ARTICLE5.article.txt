# GSB grad Zoe Dunning triumphs in Navy trial
## Lesbian officer avoids discharge despite ban 
### Staff wire reports 
Despite Zoe Dunning's public declaration
that she is a lesbian, a Navy tribunal decided
not to discharge the former Graduate School
of Business student in an unexpected ruling
yesterday.
The board of inquiry decided unanimously
to retain the 31-year-old Dunning, a 1993
graduate of the GSB, because she proved that
she wouldn't engage in homosexual activity
while in the service.
Under its new "don'task, don't tell" policy,
the Navy allows service members to be homo
sexual as long as they don't engage in homo
sexual acts while in the service.
The case now moves on to Naval authori

ties and will eventually go to the Secretary of
the Navy.
Dunning was elated with the decision.
"I feel fantastic," she said. "This is won
derful news. This says you can make the
statement that you are gay and stand a
chance of staying in the service."
A Navy spokeswoman declined to com
ment on the board of inquiry's decision.
Despite the triumph yesterday, Dunning's
attorney Greg Bonfiglio was unsure whether
the decision would stand.
Bonfiglio said that he thought a mfgor fac
tor in the board's decision was Dunning's out
standing record. Colleagues testified during
the proceedings to her excellent performance
