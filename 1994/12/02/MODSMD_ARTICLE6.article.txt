## Undecided policy committee to hold public forum 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
After spending the last few months studying the
scientific, political and social effects of pesticides, the
Grape Policy Committee hopes to present its recom
mendations to the University president and provost
by the end of the quarter, said committee chair Luis
Fraga.
The committee — which has not yet reached a de
cision on whether the University should boycott Cal
ifornia table grapes — will hold a public forum this
Monday to gauge public sentiment and gather infor
mation, he said. Another forum, held last Monday,
had low turnout.
"It's a complex issue. We're making a good-faith
effort to examine the broad range of evidence," said
Fraga, director of the Center for Chicano Research
and a political science professor. "We want to make
recommendations that make sense ... and be in
formed University citizens rather than advocates of
either side."
The committee was formed last spring in response

to a hunger strike by Chicano / Latino students, who
demanded, among other things, a University-wide
ban on Calif ornia table grapes because of the pesti
cides' effects on farm workers.
Since the beginning of the school year, the com
mittee has met on a weekly basis to gather informa
tion by looking at the scientific literature on pesti
cides and talking with experts on the subject.
As part of the information-gathering process, the
committee has met with representatives from the
Grape Workers and Farmers Coalition and the Unit
ed Farm Workers as well as experts from the Califor
nia Environmental Protection Agency and the Stan
ford Medical School.
"There is a hard science dealing with pesticides
and pesticide use," Fraga said. "In order not to mis
understand the data, we've spoken to experts....
They help us work through what seems ambiguous."
Fraga said the committee has found a definite
lack of clarity in the scientific evidence.
"Pesticides are very heavily regulated.... The test-
ing is more rigorous here in Cali
fornia than anywhere in the coun
try," Fraga said.
"There is no question that pesti
cides, when abused. . .can have
detrimental health consequences. .
.but there is no evidence that,
when used properly and according
to regulations, pesticides have any
harmful effects," he added.
In addition, the committee
found that because farmers tend to
move from one farm to another
and to cultivate different kinds of
food, it is hard to track and moni

tor their health and to gauge the
cumulative effect of pesticides.
"The good science just hasn't
been done," Fraga said, adding
that the effects of pesticides on
children who live near the fields
are unclear since their biochem
istry is different.
"Based on just the scientific evi
dence, we face a dilemma," he
added. "We can't make a decision,
so what other evidence can we look
at?"
In answering that question,
Fraga said the committee looked at
the politics, opinions and social
dimensions behind the issue.
For example, Fraga said the
committee heard plenty of testimo
ny on the low standard of living for

grape workers.
He added, however, that there is
evidence that growers "are doing
the best they can" for the workers
and that many workers do not even
pay rent on the farms.
Another issue facing the com
mittee is whether the University
should take a stand on a public
issue.
"There is a very strong segment
of the student population who has
said the issue is important to them.
The University can't avoid dealing
with it,"he said.
Fraga added, however, that
regardless of which policy the Uni
versity chooses, it is still support
ing a position. "If the University
doesn't change its policies, it is tak

ing a stand. ... It is supporting the
status quo."
The current University policy
on purchasing grapes, which was
established in 1988, states that a
majority of students under a par
ticular University dining service
may vote not to be served grapes.
But Fraga said this policy is
ambiguous because it does not say
who is responsible for informing
the general student public about
the issues, or how often votes are
to be held.
The committee also has looked
at grape policies at other campuses,
like UCLA, UC-Santa Barbara and
Michigan State University, none of
which are currently boycotting
grapes for a variety of reasons.
