# Visiting physicists collaborate on SLAC research program plan
## 
### Marc Lee Staff writer 
Two hundred physicists from all
over the world began a series of
meetings at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center this week to
hammer out the technical design
for Baßar, a vital component of the
developing B factory.
In October of last year, Presi
dent Clinton announced that the
Department of Energy had recom
mended Stanford as the site for the
international $240 million asym
metric B factory.
The project will allow scientists

to study the relationship between
matter and antimatter, yielding in
sight into how the universe was
formed from the Big Bang.
Scientists decided on the general
idea for the detector over a year ago,
said Helen Quinn, a theoretical
physicist at SLAC. But the Baßar
Detector Collaboration meeting,
which will conclude tomorrow, is
focusing on "detailed design and
engineering," she said.
"It's exciting to get to see the
whole thing coming together,"
Quinn added.
Scientists voted to name the de
tector after the particles produced

in the collision: Band "B bar" (the
name of the symbol for the anti
particle). Because Babar is also the
name of a French cartoon elephant,
they had to request permission
from the trademark holder to use
the name.
The factory will consist of two
rings circling in opposite directions,
one containing electrons and the
other anti-particles called
positrons, which will be arranged
so that collisions occur in the center
of the detector. The B factory is
unique in its asymmetry, allowing
the electronß to travel at energies
three times greater than the
positrons.
The collisions will produce B
and anti-B mesons moving fast
enough so that scientists can
determine the time at which they
decay from their decay position.
The detector will allow physicists
to measure that decay.
The international collabora
tion's deputy spokesperson, Roy
Alekson of France, said that sci
entists have jointly worked on
the detector in the past year
through meetings here and
abroad that have all been "very
fruitful."
This meeting, in particular, is
characterized by a "lot of conver
gences," he said.
The detector will have five
main layers, each for measuring

a different characteristic of the
collision. Bringing their research
from universities and labs in
countries including Italy, Eng
land, Germany, China, Canada,
France and Russia, the physi
cists are discussing "optimiza
tion of the five different layers
and how they fit together,"
Quinn said. There are "safety,
performance and cost issues that
must be folded together to make
a design that will be satisfacto
ry"
While deciding how to build
the various components, the
physicists must also determine
where to build them.
Alekflon said that this detector
will be constructed completely
"from scratch" in various loca
tions around the world. The
detector will be the first in the
United States for particle physics
to be built through such broad
international collaboration.
"It seems to be working well,"
he added.

With this meeting, the
researchers are getting closer to
writing the actual technical
design report for the detector.
Subgroups must each prepare a
different "chapter," and the final
draft will be submitted by the end
of February to an advisory com
mittee that reports to SLAC's
director.
The report must also be
reviewed by the Department of
Energy, which is providing half
the funds for the approximately
$70 million detector.
In addition, scientists from
foreign countries must have the
completed report to present to
their respective governments,
which will cover the remaining
costs.
Looking ahead, Quinn said
that all the pieces for the detector
will be completed and assembled
at SLAC by October 1998.
"The goal is to have the first
data taken with the detector in
spring '99," Alekson said.
