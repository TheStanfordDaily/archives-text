# Visiting physicists collaborate on SLAC research program plan

Two hundred physicists from all
over the world began a series of
meetings at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center this week to
hammer out the technical design
for Baßar, a vital component of the
developing B factory.
In October of last year, Presi
dent Clinton announced that the
Department of Energy had recom
mended Stanford as the site for the
international $240 million asym
metric B factory.
The project will allow scientists

to study the relationship between
matter and antimatter, yielding in
sight into how the universe was
formed from the Big Bang.
Scientists decided on the general
idea for the detector over a year ago,
said Helen Quinn, a theoretical
physicist at SLAC. But the Baßar
Detector Collaboration meeting,
which will conclude tomorrow, is
focusing on "detailed design and
engineering," she said.
"It's exciting to get to see the
whole thing coming together,"
Quinn added.
Scientists voted to name the de
tector after the particles produced

in the collision: Band "B bar" (the
name of the symbol for the anti
particle). Because Babar is also the
name of a French cartoon elephant,
they had to request permission
from the trademark holder to use
the name.
The factory will consist of two
rings circling in opposite directions,
one containing electrons and the
other anti-particles called
positrons, which will be arranged
so that collisions occur in the center
of the detector. The B factory is
unique in its asymmetry, allowing
