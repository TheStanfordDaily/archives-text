# A 						special classroom set apart
## Hospital school teaches lessons of life and death

A poster of a purple dinosaur
with a wicked smile greets you at
the door. "Welcome to School," it
says. A framed quilt hangs on one
wall, a smorgasbord of patches
childishly designed. Underneath,
a small brass plate gives credit to
its artists — "By Students of the
Hospital SchooL"
Not all of them are alive today.
For students at Stanford's Lu
cile Packard Children's Hospital
School, homework is a welcome
relief from the cold prodding of
stethoscopes. Funded by the Palo
Alto Unified School District's
special education program, the
school serves the educational
needs of over 300 school-aged pa
tients annually.
Students come dressed in pa
jamas and furry slippers. Some
walk in dragging IV machines.
Others roll in with customized
wheelchairs. All have ward-iden
tifying plastic wrist-tags.

susceptible to virus [from the lat
ter]."
The three teachers, one for each
of the primary, intermediate and
high school classrooms, maintain
frequent contacts with the home
schools of their students. Such
interaction helps students "phase
back" into their home classes more
easily once they are discharged
from the hospital.
"Sometimes I'm unstable so I
can't go to school," said "Lone," a
patient in the psychiatric ward, as
she types out an essay on human
rights violations. "Everything here
is self-paced [and] that's good."
Explaining the logic of algebra
or learning the literary import of
British literature, however, are not
the primary educational goals of
either the teachers or the students.
"The reality is that kids want to
maintain regularity," said head
teacher Camme Sunde. "Going
back to school represents normal
cy. So they want to go back. It gives
them hope."
On any given day at the Hospi
tal School, there is a scattering of
students with varying medical
needs. This helps the children
emotionally because they learn
from each other, Fullerton said.
"[A bulemic student J looks at an
oncology patient vomiting after
chemotherapy and realizes, 'he
can't stop vomiting and here I am,
trying to throw up.' "
Students quickly realize that
they are not the only ones with
problems, she said. "They're very
supportive of one another."
Fullerton recalls the cama
raderie that sprang from a mental
ly-ill student's quiet protest
against therapy.
"He wouldn't eat, wouldn't talk,"
she said. "He was fed through a nose
tube — he was a passive fighter."
One day, the boy lay down on the
classroom floor refusing to budge.
After a futile wrestling bout
with the student, "the physical
therapist finally gave up, and said,
'I don't know if you're moaning
from pain or pleasure,' " Fullerton

remembered.
"The kid laughed and the other
kids laughed along," she said.
However, classroom congeniali
ty is at times clouded by a topic too
mature for its listeners.
Talking to students about death
is necessary, Fullerton said. "They
know that others can die — they
don't know they can."
A young girl from East Palo
Alto refused to acknowledge that
she had leukemia.
"She just kept saying, 'I hate
this. I hate this. I hate this,' "
Fullerton said. Having survived
cancer herself, Fullerton finds it
easier to establish rapport with the
children.
"Once she was rushed to the
hospital vomiting blood, and I
asked her, 'did you bring your
homework?' " Fullerton said. "She
really appreciated the humor."
The humor can be difficult to
maintain sometimes, and the trau
ma of teaching in a classroom
where more than one student dies
each year affects even 12-year vet
erans like Sunde.
"We tell ourselves not to get too
close to the kids," she said, "but
we always do."
Sunde tells of a family which had
to make a decision of whether or not
to have an amputation. "They let
[their son] decide. He wanted to."
He died six years later. He was 12.
"He hated being hospitalized, but
as long as he was here, he ran the
place," she said, holding a picture of
the boy in her hands. "Before he
died, he got a volunteer to teach him
how to drive because he knew he
would never get his driver's license."
Despite such emotional difficul
ties, teachers and aides — both affil
iated with the Palo Alto Unified
School District — rarely get burned
out. Only two teachers in the past
12 years have left the school.
"These kids are sick anyhow, and
we can help them feel and get bet
ter," Sunde said. "If you feel you're
getting better, you sometimes do."
Hope is pervasive in the class
rooms. Despite uncertainty over
their prospects, many students
eagerly talk of going to college.
"I want to go to Stanford,"
Megan said. "Is it hard to ge*,
into?"
