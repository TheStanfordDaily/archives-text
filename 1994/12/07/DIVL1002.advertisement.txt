Presents
The Tenth Annual
George A. Feigen Memorial Lecture
"Cellular Signaling by Tyrosine Phosphorylation"
Dr. Schlessinger has been at the forefront of research into the mechanisms by which membrane
receptors transmit signals from hormones and growth factors. The title of his lecture will be
"Cellular Signaling by Tyrosine Phosphorylation". The tyrosine kinase class of receptors has
been shown to include receptors for insulin and numerous growth factors that determine the
development and function of nearly every cell type. Mutations in these genes have been linked
to the development of tumors. Dr. Schlessinger's contributions were crucial to the initial
molecular characterizations were crucial to the initial molecular characterization of these
receptors and he has subsequently been instrumental in elucidating the fundamental and
complex intracellular pathways that are activated by these receptors. Recent work has also
advanced our understanding of tyrosine phosphatases and their interactions with these
pathways.
