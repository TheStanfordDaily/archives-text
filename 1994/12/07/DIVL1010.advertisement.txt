Two weeks ago the Center for Teaching and Learning
mailed out surveys to current TAs, asking for
information on support and training for
teaching—as well as for suggestions
for improving training at the university.
Please take a few moments to fill out the survey and
return it to us as soon as possible.
If you are TAing but didn't receive a copy of the
survey, please call us and we'll get one to you.
If you've already returned the survey, many thanks!
