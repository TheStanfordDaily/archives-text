Year's end is a great time to buy a new car. Especially this year! In addition to dealer clearance sales - to make
room for the '95s - you can lock in SFCU's current low rates.
The Federal Reserve has just increased
interest rates, and that will affect all
lending institutions. So you'll save big
over the life of your auto loan by buying
(or refinancing**) now - at these current
low rates and payments:
You can finance for 72 months if your loan is over $20,000, or choose a fixed rate as low as 6.75% APR* with a
term of 36 months or less! SFCU also offers competitive low variable rates.
