At a time when instruments unerringly
cope with Math 1 flight data,
continued improvements to the
mechanical chronograph simply
underscore that there's more to
time than technology. A
movement's intricate
beauty or a hand-polished
case's lustrous gleam do
put technological
progress in a broader
perspective. like the
(jmcmi, the world's first
but surely not last supersonic
transport, Chkonomais draw time
and space ever closer with aesthetic
excellence as well as outstanding
technical performance.
