Looks like a
Vivarin night.
It's 10 PM. You've crammed for finals
all week. Took two today. And
now you've got to pack an entire
semester's worth of Philosophy into
one take-home exam, in one night.
But how do you stay awake when
you're totally wiped? Revive
with Vivarin. Safe as coffee,
Vivarin helps keep you awake
and mentally alert for hours.
So when you have pen in
hand, but sleep on the brain,
make it a Vivarin night!
