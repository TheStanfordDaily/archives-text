This book examines, from a historical and cultural perspective, the
rich outpouring of art in Great Britain during the war years. Two
central themes are explored: The way in which massive suffer
ing and destruction could become the raw material and inspira
tion for art; and the role of the state in providing direct sup
port for individual artistic expression in
wartime —partly for reasons of propaganda and
public morale, and partly as a cultural
response to the menace of fascism.
