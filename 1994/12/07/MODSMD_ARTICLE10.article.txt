## Rubin replaces Bentsen New Treasury secretary takes over spotlight 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Pres
ident Clinton selected Robert
Rubin, who amassed a multimil
lion-dollar fortune on Wall
Street before joining the admin
istration, to succeed Lloyd
Bentsen as Treasury secretary
yesterday.
Bentsen's departure will
deprive the administration of the
Cabinet officer with the most
experience and respect on Capitol
Hill just as Republicans are tak
ing control of Congress for the
first time in 40 years.
But the change is expected to
have little impact on policy since
both men are pro-business
Democrats.
Rubin, who took a $26 million
pay cut to leave the investment
banking firm of Goldman Sachs
& Co. to join the administration,
won widespread praise as a self
effacing coordinator who made
sure a coherent economic strate
gy was developed for a president
often criticized for an inability to
reach timely decisions.
But it was unclear how

smoothly Rubin would be able to
make the transition from his
behind-the-scenes role to chief
economic policy spokesman for
the administration, where he will
have to serve as the point man in
dealing with a Republican
Congress intent on shrinking the
size of government and cutting
taxes.
In a Rose Garden ceremony
announcing the change, Clinton
thanked Bentsen for his contri
butions and said, "I'm really
going to miss you."
Bentsen, who had spent 22
years in the Senate before joining
the administration, said he told
the president back in September
of his desire to return to his
native Texas and was not swayed
even though Clinton tried on sev
eral occasions to talk him out of
it.
"It's been a great time to be
Treasury secretary and it's a
great time to be bowing out as
Treasury secretary," said
Bentsen, who later told reporters
that the Republican takeover of

Congress had not influenced his
decision.
Rubin's position as director of
the president's National Econom
ic Council is expected to be filled
by Erskine Bowles, currently the
deputy White House chief of
staff.
An administration source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that Bowies' selection was
not announced yesterday because
the White House had not decided
on Bowles' replacement.
While Bentsen was the first
top economic policy-maker to
leave the administration, there
were already rumors of other
departures. Commerce Secretary
Ron Brown is among those being
considered to run the president's
re-election campaign and could
depart early next year.
Clinton praised Rubin as the
"consummate honest broker"
who had helped the White House
"do something that had never
been done before, to have an eco
nomic team that really works
together as a team."
