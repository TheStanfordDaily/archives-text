SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) - Its
investment fund hit by huge losses,
Orange County may seek
protection to keep investors from with
drawing their money and making things
worse, a congressman said yesterday.
Losses in the fund already have cost
County Treasurer Robert L. Citron his
job. Federal regulators and the major
bond rating services are scrutinizing the
finances of the suburban county, home
to Disneyland and 2.5 million people.
About 185 cities, school districts and
other government agencies have money
in the fund, which holds securities
whose market value has fallen from $20

billion to $18.5 billion this year. The
fund previously had paid high returns,
and Citron was much praised for his
canny investments.
If investors demand to withdraw
their money now, the fund will have to
sell securities at depressed prices, turn
ing what so Car have been paper losses
into real ones.
U.S. - Mideast dealings
JERUSALEM (AP) — Secretary of
State Warren Christopher served notice
on PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat yester
day that he must put a stop to Islamic
militants' attacks on Israelis if he
expects to spread Palestinian self-rule

across the West Bank.
Christopher also reassured Israel's
hard-pressed government that the Clin
ton administration considers Arafat's
security pledges "absolutely fundamen
tal" to peacemaking. The government is
in the throes of deciding whether to pull
Israel's army out of Arab towns on the
West Bank in the midst of a long siege of
attacks on Israel soldiers and civilians.
In the same vein, Christopher urged
Syrian President Hafez Assad in a four
and-a-half hour meeting in Damascus
to make a public declaration denounc
ing murder of innocent civilians, a
senior U.S. official said. Assad said he
would consider it, the official told
reporters.
