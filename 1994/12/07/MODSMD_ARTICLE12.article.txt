## Hill to face electric chair for slaying abortion doctor 
### 
PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — His usual
bemused smile wiped off his face, Paul
Hill listened with a bored look yesterday
as a judge sentenced him to the electric
chair for killing an abortion doctor and his
bodyguard.
"May God have mercy on your soul,"
Circuit Judge Frank Bell intoned.
Moments later, an abortion foe shouted
that Hill's blood would be on the hands of
the judge, the jury and the people of Flori
da.
Shackled at his feet, the 40-year-old
Hill stood impassively in his drab green
jail jumpsuit as Bell explained to the for
mer minister why he had rejected the only
other sentencing option, life in prison
without parole. Last month a jury unani

mously recommended that Hill be execut
ed.
Bell recounted the July 29 ambush out-,
side a Pensacola abortion clinic, the sec
ond anti-abortion slaying in the Florida
Panhandle city. He said Hill paused
briefly in the parking lot of the Ladies
Center to contemplate the carnage before
throwing down his shotgun and calmly
walking off.
"The defendant was looking at what he
had accomplished with pride and satisfac
tion," the judge said.
Hill, who represented himself with a
smile in the state case and a related feder
al trial but offered no evidence and cross
examined no witnesses, declined to speak
at his sentencing.
