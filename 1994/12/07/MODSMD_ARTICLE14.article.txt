## A
						Dead Week exam 
### 
Food Service must give
some credible answers
to student questions

WHY DOES A bottle of Snap
pie cost $1.65 at Food Ser
vice when it costs only 85
cents at Safeway? This is not a brain
teaser for Dead Week.
The answer, though, is enough to
stress anyone out. That's because
there isn't one — yet. If there's one
thing that never changes, it's the
list of complaints, or rather puz
zling questions, about University
food service.
Why are dining plans in self-oper
ative residences about half the price
of a dorm meal plan? (Can your own
cooking and cleaning explain away
the other half?)
Why aren't unused points
refunded?
Why are students forced to buy
$40 cases of Snapple in order not to
forfeit their points?
Isn't something strange at work
when Food Service is able to antici
pate this surplus and sets out bulk
order forms weeks in advance?
Why is a point worth less than a
dollar, anyway — doesn't that mean
a Snapple costs even more than the
scandalous $1.65?
And the big question: Where does
all the money go?
As far as students know, there is,
in fact, a simple answer to all of
these questions. Is it inefficiency?
Possibly. Rut students only eat
there day in and day out; they are no
authority when it comes to budgets
and can only make an educated
guess at where their money goes.
What can be done about the $1.65
Snapples? Or the students scroung
ing for points at the end of the quar
ter? (The answer here may not be to
buy more points — after all, Safe
way and probably several other
places nearby are cheaper.) And
what can be done about the serving

areas turned stockrooms during
Dead Week — for the ones who have
to bring in a dolly to use up all their
points?
Students deserve a clear explana
tion for the prices they pay — an
explanation that is rational enough
that they can accept it without feel
ing like they're being manipulated
or somehow shortchanged.
If there aren't any reasonable
answers, then Food Service should
do what the rest of the University
has been required to do: take a good
look at what it is doing and deter
mine what can be done better and
more efficiently.
The potential result is an enlight
ened and content student body, if all
the prices and pricing across resi
dences are truly justified and
explained clearly.
Certainly not everything at Food
Service is unreasonably priced, and
some items on the menu are well
worth it. And surveys and focus
groups are a good indication that
Food Service does care about what
students think.
But even if the yogurt flavors
changed every day and there was
low-fat everything, some fundamen
tal questions and problems would
still remain.
For a different reason than unrea
sonable prices, students at Roble
Hall last week staged a walkout dur
ing lunch and dinner to let Food Ser
vice know of their dissatisfaction.
It worked. Not only did they gripe
about their soggy pasta and over
cooked vegetables, they got to let
Food Service know who their main
"customers" are.
Hopefully, Food Service will not
forget this too quickly. Students
should not ask to dictate everything
about their dining halls. But some
times enough is enough.
In a time of University-wide cost
cutting and innovative re-examina
tion, Food Service may soon become
the last bastion of inefficiency left at
Stanford. The last question: Why
should this be?
Food Service is certainly worth a
closer look.
