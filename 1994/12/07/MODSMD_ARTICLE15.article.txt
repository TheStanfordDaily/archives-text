Election Board thanks students for taking time to vote

THE PRECINCT 2550 Election
Board (at Kimball Hall) would like
to sincerely thank all 120 voters for
casting votes on Nov. 8. Our working day
began at 6 a.m. and ended about 9:15
p.m. The inspector receives $95 ($6 an
hour), and clerks are paid $60 ($4 an
hour). The voters we process make up for
a long day and low pay. We appreciate
your making time in your day to vote.
A letter in The Daily questioned the
posting of precinct lists with party affilia
tions. Yes, this is done at each precinct.
Each hour, voter names must be crossed
off, which allows poll watchers to get out
the vote! I didn't notice such activity this

time, but in presidential elections this can
be lively! The poll watchers cannot come
in and bother the election board, so the
lists posted are essential. My belief is that
the registrar of voters responded to a
request that this information be avail
able. How else to shake up those nonvot
ing Republicans, Democrats, Libertarians
etc.?
So far as the editorial "Inform voters
of rules," months will pass until the next
election, and the "rules" will have to be
put forth once again. Confusion reigns on
campus every election and it is The Daily
which can provide the most help. Stu
dents change addresses yearly, sometimes

within their precincts, and as long as they
can prove to the election board that they
have had continuous residence in the
precinct and we fmd these names are on
our roster, they may vote. We must also
fmd the name on the precinct list, which
is organized by residence. May we give an
example: Jane Doe lived in Branner Hall
when she registered. Then she moved to
Kimball. That is a move within the
precinct. Her name will be on the roster
(which is in alphabetical order), and then
comes the search for her on the precinct
list — we will find her at Branner. We ask
her to sign the roster using Branner as
her address, and we remind her to rereg

ister before the next election.
Last, the pink envelopes. They are
great! We can allow votes which before we
could not. We believe you when you say
you registered to vote. We do not like to
turn you away.
I guess that's it, until the next time we
all get hyped up politically — will that be
in the primary? For California, this
comes in March 1996 (changed from
June). Or will you wait until the big one
in November 1996? Will you even be
here?
Again, thanks for voting.
Dorothy Black
Inspector, Precinct 2550 Election Board
