I deserves a standing ovation! And con
! gratulations to The Daily for printing
jit! Having gone to school in Switzer
• land for Bth through 12th grade at a
! small international school represent
; ing 38 nationalities, I experienced the
; same coldness from the Swiss and
; warmth from my fellow internation
■ als. When coming to Stanford, I too
. was shocked by Stanford's minority
! policy. Why is it that we can not
| accept each other as equals? Why
; must we label ourselves "Asian Ameri
• can", "African American", or "Chi
! cano"? Aren't we all American? Why
! polarize our society with the use of
; names, institutions and labels?
J As part of the most highly educated
• section in society and as Stanford stu
! dents, we should realize the futility
land vindictiveness labels impose upon
'society. Isn't this the problem in
Bosnia? Wasn't this what fueled the

Holocaust? I believe strongly in fol
lowing one's cultural background and
having a cultural identity, but exclu
sionary principles, which are aided by
the theme houses and the minority
sibling programs, are not ethical by
any standard.
As a white, female, Catholic, Euro
pean American, I am subjected to
racism from the majority of "minori
ty" groups. I am excluded from their
functions, I am not pampered by a
"sib" and I do not receive the benefit
of the doubt in any matter pertaining
to culture. When coming to Stanford,
we have all met a standard of excel
lence; we all are supposedly "equal."
Isn't it about time we learned to
accept one another as we are and ben
efit from our diversity rather than
letting it divide us forever?
I know that if we all stepped back
for a moment and realized the situa
tion for what it was, we would let our
boundaries fall and bask in the nov
elty of understanding and unity.
Education is the reason we are all
here; let's educate each other by
teaching others about our own cul
tures, as well as learn about as many
other cultures as we can while we are
here. By and large, we might surprise

each other. Think about the possibil
ities.
