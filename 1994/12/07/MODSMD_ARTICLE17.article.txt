# Buying organic grapes is a sound alternative to proposed grape ban
## 
### 
I am writing in response to the Great
Grape Debate which has been reported
in The Daily over the last week. I was
somewhat surprised that nobody had
considered alternatives to an outright
ban on grapes.
Instead of completely boycotting
them, why not buy locally grown organ
ic grapes? This has several benefits. We
would be buying grapes that are not
treated with pesticides and thus do not
pose a possible health risk to consumers
or to growers and harvesters. We would
also be supporting a much more envi
ronmentally sound method of agricul
ture. Instead of using pesticides and
fertilizers, which taint and eventually
deplete the soil, organic farming uses
compost and natural pest deterrents
which are not harmful and renew the
soil. This is especially important at a

time when two-thirds of the world's
arable topsoil, including that of the
Midwestern breadbasket, is being lost
to erosion and conventional farming
techniques.
We would also be supporting local
small farmers, thereby helping to
increase demand for organic produce.
While I recognize that organic produce is
more expensive, we could buy fewer
organic grapes for the same amount that
was spent on conventionally grown
grapes and at least have some good
grapes, which is better than no grapes at
all.
