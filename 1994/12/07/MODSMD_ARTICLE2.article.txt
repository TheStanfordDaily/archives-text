# Review staff, Native Americans meet
## 
### Ben Sussman Contributing writer 
Trying to reach an agreement over The
Stanford Review's use of an Indian caricature,
representatives from several campus Native
American groups met with members of the
conservative magazine's editorial staff last
Friday.
The Review began using the mascot this fall
as a part of its "Smoke Signals" feature, pro
voking anger and protest among many campus
Native American organizations.
Though the 90-minute meeting gave both
sides an opportunity to express its views on the
caricature, no decision was reached on the

issue.
The Native American groups have protested
the use of the caricature for months, but the
meeting marked the first meeting between the
two sides.
Native American students wrote a letter to
University President Gerhard Casper in Octo
ber asking him to censor The Review. Casper
replied that, while he found the cartoon to be
personally offensive, he did not have the power
to censor the newspaper.
In response to Casper's statement, cam
pus Native American groups staged a
protest, ripping up copies of The Review and
depositing them on the doorstep of Casper's
office.

Review editor in chief Aman Veijee — who
had criticized the protest as infringing on the
magazine's free speech rights — said Friday
that the reaction prompted The Review's edito
rial board to take another look at using the
mascot.
Verjee also wrote an editorial last month in
which he claimed full responsibility for the de
cision to run the mascot, but has since revised
his position on that matter.
"The decision is a staff decision," he said.
"I'm not going to overrule the editorial
board."
According to Veijee, the Review editorial
board will determine "how to con
sider the offense. If it is deter
mined to be derogatory, we will
pull the logo."
Throughout the meeting,
Native American representatives
maintained that the mascot is
offensive because it promotes a
negative stereotypical image of
Native Americans, a view which
could be harmful to their commu
nity.
"These stereotypes present
Native Americans as savages [who
are] violent and less than
human," said coterminal student
Reyna Ramirez. "Once estab
lished, [stereotypes] are very per
sistent."
Verjee then offered a compro
mise — replacing the current cari
cature with "one that is more dis
tinguished" — which was rejected.
"Regardless of what the logo
looks like, it's a stereotype," med
ical student Sara Jumping Eagle
said.
Ramirez also disputed Ver
jee's assertion that in order to
discontinue use of the Indian,
the Review's editorial board had
to find that the use of the cari
cature was "a legitimate
offense."
"We're telling you that this
image is disrespectful," she said.
"We should not have to tell you

why."
However, some Review
staffers said they feel that the
caricature does not promote
racism.
"The use of the logo may be
insensitive, but it's not racist
[because] we are not advocating
the position that one group of
people is superior to another,"
said Review news editor Ed
Malone, who added he would
vote to discontinue use of the
mascot.
Other Native Americans at the
meeting expressed concern over
the continuing movement to
bring the Indian — Stanford's
athletic mascot until 1972 — back
to campus.
Verjee replied that the mascot
choice was made to provide The
Review with "some kind of visual
symbol that is appealing and gives
us literary flexibility."
But law student Wilson
Pipestem remained skeptical.
"Can you honestly say that
there wasn't a larger political
agenda [in the mascot]?" he asked,
calling the caricature "a blatant
opportunity for The Review to
incite the students."
As the meeting progressed,
Native American representatives
said they saw little chance for fur
ther agreement and ended the
meeting.
"I don't feel that we're pro
gressing," Ramirez said as the
meeting adjourned. "We're not
going to let this go."
