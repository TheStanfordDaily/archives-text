## The
						Year of the Boyfriend 
### 
Nineteen ninety-three was hailed
as The Year of the Fleece. You
know, all those warm, super
fuzzball pullovers that everyone had.
Just wrap one of L.L. Bean's cozy mon
sters around those lonely shoulders and
you'd be safe and staticy for the whole of
winter.
In 1994 the women of this campus
simply threw off their fleeces and
replaced them with relationships.
Accordingly I dub 1994 The Year of the
Boyfriend.
It's pervasive. Every girl I meet has a
boy tucked away somewhere — not nec
essarily even in this state (which
explains why there are so many more
girlfriends scurrying about Stanford
than there are boyfriends). All but two of
the women I've even considered asking
out in the last year have had one — and
those two just didn't seem to like me.
I try to understand the trend. Maybe
it's all a part of our age group — pseudo
maturity prompting a consolidation of
relationships. Or maybe it's a paranoid,
perfection-sacrificing settlement accept
ed to keep the night safe from the creepy
crawly viral beasties that, with kiss,
can nullify nookie forever.
More likely it's the security of the
passive. After all, while a body in motion
stays in motion, a body at rest gets nook
ie regularly.
I'm not saying that all girlfriends are
in it only for fear of solitude. And I'm
not saying that every boyfriend is the
product of timing rather than quality.
Just most of them.

All this becomes a problem for those
(of us) who remain unpookied and have
the unhealthy habit of developing
unhealthy attachments to women com
placently lost in unhealthy relation
ships. And because no one wears but
tons that say Don't bother, I'm attached!
the only way to find out if she's got a
leash is to ask and risk being told, "Well
I don't think Dave would really like it if
we went to Flicks together" just one
more time.
There's a mantra I keep handy for
whenever carpe diem gets me dissed:
Rejection is where Desire and Circum
stance meet for coffee.
Meditating on it reminds me what is
so hard to believe at those times — that
there is nothing wrong with rejection of
any kind. Rather, rejection is a tribute
to your lack of submission to "adequate"
and its comforts. It is proof that you
have more to do in this world before you
nap and that you do not fear the prickle
bush and smoke screen of chance.
Rejection means that you tried. Be
proud.
This holds for more than just dating.
It holds for job applications, grad schools,
classes listed over 200 — any challenge
selected where control of success is out of
your own hands. (Ask me how many tries
it took to get this column.)
Because it's in those fragrant
moments of sitcom despair — when you
feel like someone just gave your heart a
wedgie — that you should feel most
loved. For the world to fall apart on you
so symmetrically, for all the pieces to

land on the same soft spot on your head
(so what if it's bleeding?) denotes pur
pose.
I'm not even guessing whose.
Forget boyfriends, the last four
women for whom I displayed Crush
Intensity level 7 or better have either
left or disclosed their plans to leave the
country within 24 hours of my working
up the nerve to say something. (No joke:
two to Africa, one to India, and one to
San Diego which is just like another
country anyway.)
So I turn to another axiom: Getting
one's ass kicked by the cosmos is actual
ly quite flattering.
I see it as a tribute to your charm if
everything you touch turns to blue goo.
Because someone, somewhere wants to
see the priceless face you make when,
once again, you hear blade of "No"
swooshing e'er closer to your ego's
heart.
There are 14 reasons why finding out
she's already seeing someone is a com
pliment; that things only work out for
the incessantly boring is just one of
them.
On New Year's Eve, I'll think back a
year's worth of joyous rejections lightly
speckled with success and — you know
what? — I'll still think that The Year of
the Boyfriend was a damn good year.
Even for those who weren't one of them.
