# OPINIONS SPECIAL FEATURE
## The 						U.S. war on illegal drugs: necessity or calamity? 
### 
AS A SOCIETY, the United States has
drawn a distinct line between the
plethora of drugs which are used
within its borders everyday. On the one
side lie tobacco, alcohol and other legal
drugs; on the other lie marijuana, cocaine
and other illegal drugs.
This special feature addresses the drugs
which have fallen on the wrong side of the
fence, so to speak. What makes them dif
ferent from alcohol and tobacco? Do they
pose a greater risk to society than their
widely accepted counterparts?

Proponents of the current system and
proponents of a revamped system — be it
legalization or decriminalization — agree
that the drug war has not yet been suc
cessful in eradicating the use and effect of
illegal substances. The question raised by
the following four articles, therefore, is
what path the U.S. should follow in the
future.
Hoover Fellow Joseph D. McNamara
argues for an end to the war on drugs.
Drawing upon his experience as a police
officer in Harlem, NY., he defends the posi

tion that the sale and use of illegal drugs
have become impossible to deter. Dr.
McNamara concludes that the societal cost
of punishing drug users has become high
enough to warrant decriminalization.
Conversely, Michael Heald, a public
information officer with the Drug Enforce
ment Administration, argues that there
exists no realistic alternative to the present
system. According to Mr. Heald, legalizing
or decriminalizing drugs would not reach
the goals — such as decreasing criminal
activity — that it sets out to achieve.

Stewart Richardson, a senior at Stan
ford who is presently completing an honors
thesis on the drug war, takes up the issue
from an individual's standpoint. He pre
sents the drug war as an assault on critical
thinking and personal freedoms, which has
had harmful ramifications such as pre
venting marijuana to be smoked for medi
cal purposes.
Finally, Richard B. Seymour, author of
10 books and some 40 published articles on
drug abuse, argues that psychoactive
drugs serve a superfluous purpose which

can be better fulfilled by the human brain.
To legalize drugs, he maintains, would be
to further engender the destructive disease
we know as addiction.
Given the societal stigma attached to
illegal drug use, arguments against the
drug war are often marginalized or dis
missed as extreme. Regardless of whether
legalization or decriminalization would in
fact be realistic solutions to the drug epi
demic, relevant issues must at least be
brought into an open forum to facilitate
discussion, debate and potential action.
