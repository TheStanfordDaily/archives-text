# The
						war on drugs must be terminated

### Joseph D. McNamara 
WAGING A WAR of criminal law enforce
ment against the use of certain drugs has
not prevented drug abuse, but rather has
caused enormous harm to our country. The Unit
ed States criminalized drug use in 1914 and since
then a huge criminal enterprise has flourished
(one congressional estimate is that it is a $ 100 bil
lion per year business, which would make it the
largest in the world), violence has increased and
corruption has grown to a magnitude unequaled
in our history. The reason the government has
failed to prevent foreign production of illegal
drugs and their shipment into the U.S. is simple:
the illegality of these substances means that $500
worth of drugs in a source nation will bring
$100,000 on the streets of a U.S. city. The
demand for drugs by millions of Americans,
despite their illegality, creates a huge profit mar
gin triggering market forces that all the cops,
armies and prisons in the world will not deter.
As a policeman in Harlem, I saw the enormous
damage that some drugs caused. Youngsters died
of overdoses, hundreds of people under the influ
ence of heroin nodded like zombies on street cor
ners and many drug users turned into habitual
petty thieves to support their addictions. Howev
er, I also saw that dramatic increases in police
arrests failed to stem the epidemic of drug use.
People turned back to drugs as soon as they were

released from confinement. And because of the
profit margin, a new dealer surfaced before the
cell doors closed on the old dealer.
The threat of arrest was an ineffective deter
rence, as I discovered one day when my patrol
partner and I arrested an addict for possession of
a hypodermic needle and a trace of heroin. The
addict promised to lead us to a pusher in return
for his release, so we followed him down a street
with hundreds of people on it. He talked to sever
al men and within 10 minutes had arranged a
buy. We ended up arresting the pusher, while the
addict "escaped." But what amazed me was that
our prisoner had conversed about buying drugs
within a few feet of a marked police car and two
uniformed policemen. The first people he spoke
to were not deterred by our presence, they were
simply out of drugs. If we had not known what he
was doing we might have imagined he was talk
ing about sports or the weather. This is an impor
tant fact to remember. Unlike murder, assault,
robbery and other crimes, drug crimes take place
among willing accomplices who treasure their
privacy. No victim comes to the police for redress.
My guesstimate is that millions of drug crimes
occur every day without police knowledge and
with minuscule possibilities of arrest.
In graduate school, I pondered how a federal
government that experienced such difficulty in
the mundane tasks of delivering mail and admin
istering social security benefits had the arrogance

to think that it could control what citizens put
into their bloodstreams in private. Equally inter
esting was why the government saw this behav
ior as something that needed to be labeled a
crime. It turned out that religious groups around
the turn of the century persuaded Congress that
use of certain drugs called for punishment under
criminal law. Thus, even today, we find religious
terminology used by drug war hawks. It is an
"evil." We need to "ci-usade" against drugs, and,
although alcohol and tobacco are more dangerous
to life than illegal drugs, illegal drugs are said to
cause the loss not just of life but of one's "soul."
Putting aside the lack of empirical evidence for
the last conclusion, we fall into the obvious dilem
ma of deciding which individual's morals will be
made the law of the land when public policy is
reduced to an argument about the moral basis of
ingesting certain chemical substances as opposed
to others. The First Amendment guarantees our
right to believe in a religion whatever the majori
ty of people think about its logic; consequently,
citizens have a Constitutional right to vote on a
moral basis. However, it is also true that an
enduring theme of the First Amendment is that
the government shall not impose religious tenets
upon the citizenry. It seems to me that drug war
hawks fail to demonstrate that they are not moti
vated by a religious bias seeking to promulgate a
