# The 						war on drugs must be terminated
## 
### Joseph D. McNamara 
WAGING A WAR of criminal law enforce
ment against the use of certain drugs has
not prevented drug abuse, but rather has
caused enormous harm to our country. The Unit
ed States criminalized drug use in 1914 and since
then a huge criminal enterprise has flourished
(one congressional estimate is that it is a $ 100 bil
lion per year business, which would make it the
largest in the world), violence has increased and
corruption has grown to a magnitude unequaled
in our history. The reason the government has
failed to prevent foreign production of illegal
drugs and their shipment into the U.S. is simple:
the illegality of these substances means that $500
worth of drugs in a source nation will bring
$100,000 on the streets of a U.S. city. The
demand for drugs by millions of Americans,
despite their illegality, creates a huge profit mar
gin triggering market forces that all the cops,
armies and prisons in the world will not deter.
As a policeman in Harlem, I saw the enormous
damage that some drugs caused. Youngsters died
of overdoses, hundreds of people under the influ
ence of heroin nodded like zombies on street cor
ners and many drug users turned into habitual
petty thieves to support their addictions. Howev
er, I also saw that dramatic increases in police
arrests failed to stem the epidemic of drug use.
People turned back to drugs as soon as they were

released from confinement. And because of the
profit margin, a new dealer surfaced before the
cell doors closed on the old dealer.
The threat of arrest was an ineffective deter
rence, as I discovered one day when my patrol
partner and I arrested an addict for possession of
a hypodermic needle and a trace of heroin. The
addict promised to lead us to a pusher in return
for his release, so we followed him down a street
with hundreds of people on it. He talked to sever
al men and within 10 minutes had arranged a
buy. We ended up arresting the pusher, while the
addict "escaped." But what amazed me was that
our prisoner had conversed about buying drugs
within a few feet of a marked police car and two
uniformed policemen. The first people he spoke
to were not deterred by our presence, they were
simply out of drugs. If we had not known what he
was doing we might have imagined he was talk
ing about sports or the weather. This is an impor
tant fact to remember. Unlike murder, assault,
robbery and other crimes, drug crimes take place
among willing accomplices who treasure their
privacy. No victim comes to the police for redress.
My guesstimate is that millions of drug crimes
occur every day without police knowledge and
with minuscule possibilities of arrest.
In graduate school, I pondered how a federal
government that experienced such difficulty in
the mundane tasks of delivering mail and admin
istering social security benefits had the arrogance

to think that it could control what citizens put
into their bloodstreams in private. Equally inter
esting was why the government saw this behav
ior as something that needed to be labeled a
crime. It turned out that religious groups around
the turn of the century persuaded Congress that
use of certain drugs called for punishment under
criminal law. Thus, even today, we find religious
terminology used by drug war hawks. It is an
"evil." We need to "ci-usade" against drugs, and,
although alcohol and tobacco are more dangerous
to life than illegal drugs, illegal drugs are said to
cause the loss not just of life but of one's "soul."
Putting aside the lack of empirical evidence for
the last conclusion, we fall into the obvious dilem
ma of deciding which individual's morals will be
made the law of the land when public policy is
reduced to an argument about the moral basis of
ingesting certain chemical substances as opposed
to others. The First Amendment guarantees our
right to believe in a religion whatever the majori
ty of people think about its logic; consequently,
citizens have a Constitutional right to vote on a
moral basis. However, it is also true that an
enduring theme of the First Amendment is that
the government shall not impose religious tenets
upon the citizenry. It seems to me that drug war
hawks fail to demonstrate that they are not moti
vated by a religious bias seeking to promulgate a
"proper" behavior for Americans.
The old adage that the first casu
alty in any war is truth certainly
applies to the drug war. The vast pro
paganda machine of the federal gov
ernment says that we are winning
the war, but neglects to discuss the
cost of the war in lives lost through
violence flowing from the illegal mar
ket, as well as from the absence of
quality control over drugs manufac
tured in secret. Equally missing from
the multitude of government bul
letins is any discussion of corruption
and damage the drug war is doing to
race relations, foreign policy and the
integrity of American due process.
Perhaps the best indication of a
federal "spin" on how drug informa
tion is processed can be seen in a
recent speech delivered at Harvard
University by Dr. Lee Brown, Presi
dent Clinton's drug czar. The year
before he became drug czar, Lee
Brown, as New York Police Commis
sioner, told the Harvard Business
Review that only Washington
bureaucrats were saying we were

winning the drug war. (A year earli
er in my own research — polling
police officers, police chiefs, judges,
prosecutors and public defenders — I
also found few who believed the drug
war was being won.) The following
year, speaking as drug czar at Har
vard, Brown criticized those who say
we are not winning the drug war.
Also, Brown, following the example
of the first drug czar, William Ben
nett, questioned the motivation of
those advocating an examination of
government policies with a view
toward reducing the harm caused
by drugs and government policies.
Nevertheless, many Americans
retain a healthy skepticism about
the drug war and feel that the suc
cess or failure of government poli
cies must be balanced with the cost
in both financial and human terms.
In 1991, I was part of an ad hoc
group of 20 individuals who met at
the Hoover Institution. The group
was racially, politically and occupa
tionally diverse. We produced a reso
lution calling for an end to the drug
war and the appointment by
Congress and the President of an
impartial commission to study alter
native methods of preventing drug
abuse. Nobel Laureate Milton Fried

man and Former Secretary of State
George Shultz were original signers.
Word of this resolution spread and
thousands of people signed, includ
ing federal judges, mayors, police
chiefs and people from every walk of
life.
Some of the concerns center on
the fact that the drug war has
become a race war. Although esti
mates are that 80 percent of drug
crimes are committed by whites,
three out of four arrests for drug
crimes are of non-whites. There are
no video cameras present when cops
(most of them white) confront inner
city youngsters as part of the drug
war. If you saw what happened to
Rodney King, imagine what might
happen to an African-American kid
on a dark street when he protests an
illegal police drug search. Criminolo
gist Alfred Blumstein has character
ized police drug war tactics as an
assault on the African-American
community that would not be toler
ated in white, middle-class commu
nities. As someone who headed two
of the nation's largest police forces
for 18 years, I agree. If the police pur
sued drugs on Stanford or other uni
versity campuses the way they do in
poor minority neighborhoods, we

would see student demonstrations
reminiscent of Vietnam war
protests.
Drug war tactics nourish a thriv
ing criminal industry in inner cities
(as well as in white suburbs and rural
areas) where it is difficult to motivate
kids to stay in school and to compete
for the few jobs available. The appeal
of easy money and easy firearms
lures kids in their teens into criminal
careers. Ironically, the draconian
mandatory sentences for drug
crimes lead the industry to recruit
legions of teenagers who can only be
charged with juvenile delinquency.
Milton Friedman, comparing the
drug war to Prohibition, estimates
that an additional 10,000 homicides
occur each year because of govern
ment policies. Alfred Blumstein
believes the drug trade and the easy
availability of firearms are responsi
ble for doubling the rate of juvenile
homicides by firearms since 1985.
News stories of drug-related cor
ruption in Mexico, Colombia, Italy
and other foreign countries cloud the
enormous corruption in our own
country. From IjOs Angeles to New
York, police officers have been found
guilty of committing armed rob
beries of drug dealers while on duty

and in uniform. A number of police
chiefs are in prison because of drug
corruption. The drug enforcement
agent who arrested Panamanian
General Manuel Noriega is now in
prison for stealing $700,000 in laun
dered drug money. In Loe Angeles,
an FBI agent was arrested for
attempting to sell tens of millions of
dollars of stolen drug evidence back
to street dealers. Alas, our armed
forces have also been corrupted since
President George Bush persuaded
Congress to authorize using the mil
itary in the drug war.
A lack of space prevents a full dis
cussion of the hidden costs of the
drug war, but the Drug Policy Foun
dation in Washington, D.C. esti
mates that $150 billion was spent
from 1982 to 1993 and that the next
$150 billion will be spent in just
three years. The recently passed
Crime Bill continues to subsidize
inefficient and counterproductive
law enforcement. At a time when
the public rightfully demands that
dangerous, violent criminals be
locked up, criminal justice agencies
are giving top priority to non-violent
drug crime. Surgeon General
Joceyln Elders' son was sentenced to
10 years for a $275 sale of cocaine.

Hundreds of thousands of arrests
are made each year for maryuana
and roughly 60 percent of Federal
prison inmates are incarcerated for
long sentences for non-violent
crime. The number of people incar
cerated has quadrupled, and, of
course, this policy falls most heavily
on non-whites. To keep pace with
existing sentencing guidelines we
need to build a new federal prison
every month until the year 2,000!
Last year, the mayors and
police chiefs of San Francisco,
San Jose and Oakland signed a
resolution calling for an end to
the drug war and the establish
ment of a commission to search
for better ways to deal with the
drug problem. It turned out to be
good politics. It is necessary for
voters to convince politicians in
Washington that it is not political
suicide to call for an end to the
drug war and for an impartial
study of alternatives, including
the possibility of decriminaliza
tion.
