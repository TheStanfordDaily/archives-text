# Moving toward a responsible drug policy
## 
### Richard B. Seymour 
I AM OPPOSED to the legaliza
tion of all psychoactive drugs
for two basic reasons. The first
is that full legalization eliminates
any means of dealing with drug
related public health risks. At pre
sent we as a society have given our
selves permission to use several
drugs. Of these, alcohol and tobac
co are either directly or indirectly
responsible for needless deaths, ill
ness, injury and financial loss.
Legalizing such drugs as cocaine
and heroin could open a Pandora's
box of misdirection and exploita
tion, greatly increasing the current
public health risks posed by the
compulsive use of psychoactive
drugs.
The second reason is that there
is no non-medical reason for any
one to take psychoactive drugs. In
recent years, much has been
learned about the nature of drugs
and their effects on the human
brain. Although there is still much
to be learned, we do know that psy
choactive drugs affect our feelings,
perceptions and behavior by inter
acting with the brain's neurotrans
mitter systems. These intricate
systems are the means by which
the brain receives data, inteiprets
it and communicates with itself,
creating thoughts and actions in
response to the data. Psychoactive
drugs produce their effects by stim

ulating or inhibiting the release of
various neurotransmitters, or by
replacing them in receptor sites
and mimicking their actions. What
this means is that the positive
effects people seek from drugs are
available within our own brains
and bodies if we know how to use
them. Furthermore, learning to
access our own neurotransmitter
systems provides a far greater
range of benefits than any combi
nation of drugs is capable of pro
viding.
The brain is like a finely tuned
concert piano. Correctly utilized
interaction between mind, brain
and body is like a trained pianist
playing a fine, intricate piece of
music on a well-tuned concert
grand. The action of psychoactive
drugs, however, is like someone
wearing boxing gloves banging on
the keys. Sound is produced, but
there is a world of difference and
the piano may well be damaged in
the process.
The 22-plus years that I have
spent working in the chemical
dependency treatment field at San
Francisco's Haight Ashbury Free
Clinics has convinced me that
addiction is a disease characterized
by compulsion, loss of control and
continued use in spite of adverse
consequences. Addiction, therefore,
is a medical problem. At the same
time as drug use is demystified,
dtglamorized and destigmatized by

being recognized as a disease, real
istic prevention efforts that provide
early training on how to develop
rewarding lives and growth-pro
moting challenges need to be initi
ated. Young people need to be
engaged and enfranchised in our
communities. These are the efforts
that will eventually make the use of
psychoactive drugs obsolete.
While addiction itself is a public
health issue, knowingly supplying
drugs to addicts is a criminal mat
ter that would not be solved by
legalizing all psychoactive drugs.
The disease would still be there,
and if anything access to drugs
would actually increase, fueled by a
sense that their use had gained
approval.
While maintaining pressure on
those who profit from drugs, the
social and criminal justice issues
involved in drug trafficking are
complex; it is difficult to know just
where to draw the line between
addictive behavior, ignorance and
criminality. Ie the heroin addict
who sells small quantities to other
addicts in order to support his or
her habit in the same league with
the high-rolling members of a
cocaine cartel?
In the late 19705, with the
abuse of prescription drugs mul
tiplying, drug enforcement agen
cies decided that the primary cul
prits were "script docs," physi
cians who sold prescriptions for

psychoactive drugs. It turned out
that only a small percentage of
physicians were selling such pre
scriptions. Law enforcement and
the medical profession worked
together to see that these individ
uals were prosecuted. By far the
greater problem turned out to be
ignorance of the nature of these
drugs within the medical profes
sion. The solution, therefore, was
education leading to better pre
scribing, and aid in helping physi
cians deal with "scammers" who
con prescriptions for non-exis
tent ailments.
Drug use in this country —
and throughout the world for
that matter — is out of control,
but blanket legalization is not
the answer. No epidemic has ever
been legislated out of existence.
What is needed to bring the
world's drug epidemic under con
trol is education, effective pre
vention that truly engages young
people, recognition that addic
tion is a disease with treatment
available to all who need it, and
the pressure of realistic law
enforcement, each undertaken in
cooperation with public health
efforts.

dependency treatment field at San
Francisco's Haight Ashbury Free
Clinics has convinced me that
addiction is a disease characterized
by compulsion, loss of control and
continued use in spite of adverse
consequences. Addiction, therefore,
is a medical problem. At the same
time as drug use is demystified,
dtglamorized and destigmatized by

being recognized as a disease, real
istic prevention efforts that provide
early training on how to develop
rewarding lives and growth-pro
moting challenges need to be initi
ated. Young people need to be
engaged and enfranchised in our
communities. These are the efforts
that will eventually make the use of
psychoactive drugs obsolete.
While addiction itself is a public
health issue, knowingly supplying
drugs to addicts is a criminal mat
ter that would not be solved by
legalizing all psychoactive drugs.
The disease would still be there,
and if anything access to drugs
would actually increase, fueled by a
sense that their use had gained
approval.
While maintaining pressure on
those who profit from drugs, the
social and criminal justice issues
involved in drug trafficking are
complex; it is difficult to know just
where to draw the line between
addictive behavior, ignorance and
criminality. Ie the heroin addict
who sells small quantities to other
addicts in order to support his or
her habit in the same league with
the high-rolling members of a
cocaine cartel?
In the late 19705, with the
abuse of prescription drugs mul
tiplying, drug enforcement agen
cies decided that the primary cul
prits were "script docs," physi
cians who sold prescriptions for

psychoactive drugs. It turned out
that only a small percentage of
physicians were selling such pre
scriptions. Law enforcement and
the medical profession worked
together to see that these individ
uals were prosecuted. By far the
greater problem turned out to be
ignorance of the nature of these
drugs within the medical profes
sion. The solution, therefore, was
education leading to better pre
scribing, and aid in helping physi
cians deal with "scammers" who
con prescriptions for non-exis
tent ailments.
Drug use in this country —
and throughout the world for
that matter — is out of control,
but blanket legalization is not
the answer. No epidemic has ever
been legislated out of existence.
What is needed to bring the
world's drug epidemic under con
trol is education, effective pre
vention that truly engages young
people, recognition that addic
tion is a disease with treatment
available to all who need it, and
the pressure of realistic law
enforcement, each undertaken in
cooperation with public health
efforts.
