# Legalization theories are flawed, illogical
## 
### Michael Heald 
THE ABUSE OF drugs in the
United States has been
likened by some to the Black
Plague of our time. We watch and
read news accounts of the social
destruction caused by this
"plague." We grow frustrated,
angry and may become receptive to
those who argue that "Anything is
better than what we are doing
now!"
The most extreme example of
this attitude comes from those
who argue that drugs should be
legalized or decriminalized. Such
alternatives have a certain emo
tional appeal to those who want a
quick fix to an extremely complex
problem. However, for anyone who
has experienced the heartbreak of
losing a friend or loved one to
drugs, for law enforcement person
nel who are tasked with maintain
ing social order, for most doctors
and clinicians who try to put
destroyed lives back together,
legalization or decriminalization
are untenable.
Legalization and decriminaliza
tion proponents bring forth a num
ber of arguments to support their
vision of a brave new world. These
arguments don't stand up to any
sort of informed examination; not
only are they flawed, they are also
fragmented. Arguments for legal
ization, when analyzed, become
nothing more than criticisms of
particular aspects of the present
drug policy. Those who propose
that the legalization of drugs is the
magic bullet to solve the woes of
society have yet to provide a com
prehensive strategy to implement
their ideas. The reason that legal
ization advocates have this problem
is that they usually view the issue
from their own individual perspec
tive, and in some cases, from ivoiy
towers. They are much like the

blind Brahmin who feels different
parts of the elephant and gives
descriptions of it that are logical but
wrong.
Space constraints do not allow
for a comprehensive argument
against the legalization or decrimi
nalization of drugs. However, a few
examples of legalization arguments
will show that such positions are
flawed and lacking upon careful
deliberation.
Current legalization arguments
fall into two general categories —
economic and reduced crime. The
first proposes that making drugs
legal would lower the cost of drugs
and permit taxes to be levied on
them to raise revenue for social ser
vices.
This economic argument has no
basis in fact. Historical evidence,
scholarly opinion and common
sense suggest that if drugs are pro
vided to the public in large amounts
with little or no sanctions, drug
usage will go up. If usage goes up, in
all likelihood addiction will rise.
Those who work with drug-depen
dent people will tell you that addic
tion is a chronic, relapsing disorder
which requires specialized treat
ment and provision for aftercare.
It is intuitively obvious that this
treatment is extremely costly. In
addition to treating individuals for
addiction, the cost to society in
terms of health care, social services,
lost work and crime would be astro
nomical. While treatment is an
important, necessaiy and integral
part of any drug reduction strategy,
the idea that we will provide drugs
to users and then treat our way out
of this problem is economically
unfeasible and defiant of logic. The
effective treatment of drug addicts
relies on these persons recognizing
their problem and being willing to
take steps (often drastic steps) to
overcome addiction. These condi
tions do not exist for most drug
users today.
Furthermore, the idea that plac
ing a tax on drugs would raise rev
enue falls apart when subject to real
world economics. It is highly unlike
ly that any legitimate enterprise
could produce drugs at a lower cast
to the user than the present black

market. Legitimate manufacturers
and distributors would be required
(it is assumed) to have some sort of
production standards; to pay
employers' salaries, to pay for facili
ties, etc. The bureaucracy involved
in the legitimate distribution of
drugs would cost larger sums of
money. An attempt to add a tax to
these drugs would drive up the cost
of the drug further. At that point a
black market would form to provide
a less costly product to the con
sumer.
It is clear, therefore, that the eco
nomic argument — like most other

legalization arguments — is not
practical in a real world situation.
The second area in which legal
ization proponents make their most
fervent argument is that of reform
ing the criminal justice system. The
contention is that if drugs were
legalized or decriminalized, there
would be less crime. These argu
ments again are simplistic and have
little in common with criminal theo
ry. They assume that most crime is
committed by drug users to raise
money to support their habits. While
it is certainly true that some people
fall into this category, it is also true

that criminals of all types take
drugs. This is a subtle but significant
fact. The assumption that readily
available drugs will stop criminals
from committing crimes neglects
the fact that people also engage in
crime because they need money to
buy food, shelter, transportation
and other necessities of life — fac
tors which would still exist even if
drugs were legal. Furthermore,
those who would legalize drugs
ignore the fact that persons under
the influence of drugs often com
mit violent crimes as a result of
being under the influence of

drugs.
These examples illustrate the
fact that legalization proponents
base their arguments on incom
plete, simplistic theories and fail
to provide a comprehensive strat
egy to reduce drug abuse or the
social maladies stemming from
drug abuse. These examples by no
means cover all the arguments
which can be made against the
legalization of drugs. They simply
point out that, although drug
legalization may sound like it has
merit, the arguments put forth
must be examined closely and the

ramifications of these theories
must be fully considered.
Legalization theory appeals
for the most part to a sense of
frustration and fear. While these
are justified feelings and society
must be willing to try new strate
gies in dealing with the drug
abuse problem, clearly legaliza
tion and decriminalization are
not acceptable solutions.
