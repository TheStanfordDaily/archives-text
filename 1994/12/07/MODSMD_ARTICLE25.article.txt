# Legalization theories are flawed, illogical
## 
### Michael Heald 
THE ABUSE OF drugs in the
United States has been
likened by some to the Black
Plague of our time. We watch and
read news accounts of the social
destruction caused by this
"plague." We grow frustrated,
angry and may become receptive to
those who argue that "Anything is
better than what we are doing
now!"
The most extreme example of
this attitude comes from those
who argue that drugs should be
legalized or decriminalized. Such
alternatives have a certain emo
tional appeal to those who want a
quick fix to an extremely complex
problem. However, for anyone who
has experienced the heartbreak of
losing a friend or loved one to
drugs, for law enforcement person
nel who are tasked with maintain
ing social order, for most doctors
and clinicians who try to put
destroyed lives back together,
legalization or decriminalization
are untenable.
Legalization and decriminaliza
tion proponents bring forth a num
ber of arguments to support their
vision of a brave new world. These
arguments don't stand up to any
sort of informed examination; not
only are they flawed, they are also
fragmented. Arguments for legal
ization, when analyzed, become
nothing more than criticisms of
particular aspects of the present
drug policy. Those who propose
that the legalization of drugs is the
magic bullet to solve the woes of
society have yet to provide a com
prehensive strategy to implement
their ideas. The reason that legal
ization advocates have this problem
is that they usually view the issue
from their own individual perspec
tive, and in some cases, from ivoiy
towers. They are much like the

blind Brahmin who feels different
parts of the elephant and gives
descriptions of it that are logical but
wrong.
Space constraints do not allow
for a comprehensive argument
against the legalization or decrimi
nalization of drugs. However, a few
examples of legalization arguments
will show that such positions are
flawed and lacking upon careful
deliberation.
Current legalization arguments
fall into two general categories â€”
economic and reduced crime. The
first proposes that making drugs
legal would lower the cost of drugs
and permit taxes to be levied on
them to raise revenue for social ser
vices.
This economic argument has no
basis in fact. Historical evidence,
scholarly opinion and common
sense suggest that if drugs are pro
vided to the public in large amounts
with little or no sanctions, drug
usage will go up. If usage goes up, in
all likelihood addiction will rise.
Those who work with drug-depen
dent people will tell you that addic
tion is a chronic, relapsing disorder
which requires specialized treat
ment and provision for aftercare.
It is intuitively obvious that this
treatment is extremely costly. In
addition to treating individuals for
addiction, the cost to society in
terms of health care, social services,
lost work and crime would be astro
nomical. While treatment is an
important, necessaiy and integral
part of any drug reduction strategy,
the idea that we will provide drugs
to users and then treat our way out
of this problem is economically
unfeasible and defiant of logic. The
effective treatment of drug addicts
relies on these persons recognizing
their problem and being willing to
