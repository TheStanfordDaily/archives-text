# Drug war assualts individual thinking
## 
### Stewart Richardson 
I FIRST EXPERIMENTED
with illegal drugs when I was
a sophomore in high school. I
learned that a friend in my dor
mitory had psychedelic mush
rooms to sell, and I was intrigued.
A school science magazine had
recently published an issue on
drugs, and I had been amazed at
how little risk seemed to be
involved with the use of mush
rooms. Now that experimenta
tion was a real possibility, I visit
ed the library. I read everything I
could find relating to mushrooms
and, again, was surprised at how
minor the actual risks seemed in
comparison with the societal stig
ma attached to drug use.
I ate mushrooms over Spring
Break, on a cloudy day in New
York's Central Park. My experi
ence was amazing, far beyond
anything I could begin to describe
here. I cannot deny that it was
good simply for the sake of pro
moting a supposedly useful goal
— the eradication of drug use. I
did not do drugs because I felt
pressured, or to "fit in." I made a
reasoned decision to use a partic
ular drug, and it turned out to be
the right decision.
For several years afterwards I
was not bothered by the goals or
tactics of the drug war. It seemed
that they were meant to apply to
someone else; I had done nothing
wrong or dishonorable. Then,
during my freshman year at
Stanford, two events altered my
perspective. First, I heard a radio
advertisement which concluded,
"If you smoke maryuana, you're
a dope." By this time I had
smoked maryuana; I was not and
am not a "dope." I remembered
other drug war slogans: "Just
Say No," and "Users are losers."
For the first time, they struck me

as profoundly wrong. The fact
that someone uses or has used
drugs tells us very little about
that person; it certainly does not
tell us that they are a "dope" or a
"loser." Few people would sug
gest otherwise. Why, then, do we
support this message?
In order to win the drug war, I
realized, our government must
teach citizens not to think criti
cally. My experience with mush
rooms is disallowed. It is not per
missible to consider particular
drugs as possibly beneficial and
possibly harmful, depending on
the manner of usage. Those
drugs which are prohibited must
be treated as simply "bad" or
"evil." We must label drug users
as "losers" despite the fact that
they constitute a good percentage
of our population. We must pre
tend that it is impossible to use
illegal drugs responsibly, even
though most of us know other
wise. We must pretend that drug
users deserve long jail sentences,
even though we may not believe
what they did was at all wrong.
We must sacrifice our own judge
ment in order to "Just Say No."
Why? Because we are not asked
to look at facts and form opin
ions; we are required by law to
accept the opinion given to us. If
there is a difference between the
anti-drug campaigns we feed our
youth and brainwashing, I have
yet to discover it.
The second event which
altered my perspective on the
drug war occurred the following
summer, when my father was
bed-ridden with terminal cancer.
Maryuana is an effective drug in
dealing with the terrible side
effects of chemotherapy because
it simultaneously alleviates pain
and nausea and stimulates
appetite. Taking Marinol — a syn
thetic prescription drug containing
maryuana — is less effective than
smoking maryuana for various doc
umented reasons. Thirty-three
states recognize marijuana's thera
peutic benefits, as did Francis

Young, the Administrative Law
Judge appointed by the Drug
Enforcement Administration to
investigate the issue. Regardless, the
DEA still does not recognize these
benefits. Although he knew it could
make his last days more tolerable,
my father refused to smoke marijua
na for several horrible weeks
because he did not want to break the
law. Marijuana may not work for
everyone, but it assuredly does work

for many or most people, and my
father might have been among those
people.
In 1991 James Mason, chief of
the Public Health Service, suggested
that "If it is perceived that the Pub
lic Health Service is going around
giving maryuana to folks, there
would be a perception that this stuff
can't be so bad. It gives a bad signal."
A radio talk show considered this
subject, and I listened to a caller

argue that "Anyone who thinks that
maryuana can do any good is crazy."
The drug war defines drugs, mari
juana included, as unconditionally
bad. Many individuals in the DEA
and other agencies know otherwise,
but support the myth because they
think it is useful. A radio caller swal
lows the myth whole; drugs are bad,
maryuana is bad, nothing good can
come of them. How many citizens
think this way? How much money

do we spend to propagate this line of
"reasoning," and how much did my
father suffer because of it? How
many other patients suffer just as
my father did?
My first realization was that the
drug war is incompatible with per
sonal freedoms and critical thinking.
My second was that it leads to cruel
beliefs by those who do not know
better (or don't accept what they
know) because they have been

taught not to think. The drug war
used to be a social policy aimed at
others. Now it is something which I
passionately hate: an insult to my
autonomy as a person and to the
memory of my father.
