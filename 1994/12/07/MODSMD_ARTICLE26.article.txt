# Drug war assualts individual thinking
## 
### Stewart Richardson 
I FIRST EXPERIMENTED
with illegal drugs when I was
a sophomore in high school. I
learned that a friend in my dor
mitory had psychedelic mush
rooms to sell, and I was intrigued.
A school science magazine had
recently published an issue on
drugs, and I had been amazed at
how little risk seemed to be
involved with the use of mush
rooms. Now that experimenta
tion was a real possibility, I visit
ed the library. I read everything I
could find relating to mushrooms
and, again, was surprised at how
minor the actual risks seemed in
comparison with the societal stig
ma attached to drug use.
I ate mushrooms over Spring
Break, on a cloudy day in New
York's Central Park. My experi
ence was amazing, far beyond
anything I could begin to describe
here. I cannot deny that it was
good simply for the sake of pro
moting a supposedly useful goal
â€” the eradication of drug use. I
did not do drugs because I felt
pressured, or to "fit in." I made a
reasoned decision to use a partic
ular drug, and it turned out to be
the right decision.
For several years afterwards I
was not bothered by the goals or
tactics of the drug war. It seemed
that they were meant to apply to
someone else; I had done nothing
wrong or dishonorable. Then,
during my freshman year at
Stanford, two events altered my
perspective. First, I heard a radio
advertisement which concluded,
"If you smoke maryuana, you're
a dope." By this time I had
smoked maryuana; I was not and
am not a "dope." I remembered
other drug war slogans: "Just
Say No," and "Users are losers."
For the first time, they struck me

as profoundly wrong. The fact
that someone uses or has used
drugs tells us very little about
that person; it certainly does not
tell us that they are a "dope" or a
"loser." Few people would sug
gest otherwise. Why, then, do we
support this message?
In order to win the drug war, I
realized, our government must
teach citizens not to think criti
cally. My experience with mush
rooms is disallowed. It is not per
missible to consider particular
drugs as possibly beneficial and
possibly harmful, depending on
the manner of usage. Those
drugs which are prohibited must
be treated as simply "bad" or
"evil." We must label drug users
as "losers" despite the fact that
they constitute a good percentage
of our population. We must pre
tend that it is impossible to use
illegal drugs responsibly, even
though most of us know other
wise. We must pretend that drug
users deserve long jail sentences,
even though we may not believe
what they did was at all wrong.
We must sacrifice our own judge
ment in order to "Just Say No."
Why? Because we are not asked
to look at facts and form opin
ions; we are required by law to
accept the opinion given to us. If
there is a difference between the
anti-drug campaigns we feed our
youth and brainwashing, I have
yet to discover it.
The second event which
altered my perspective on the
drug war occurred the following
summer, when my father was
bed-ridden with terminal cancer.
Maryuana is an effective drug in
dealing with the terrible side
effects of chemotherapy because
it simultaneously alleviates pain
and nausea and stimulates
