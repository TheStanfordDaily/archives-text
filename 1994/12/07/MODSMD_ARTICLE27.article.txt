## No more sleepytime blues Researchers help sleepers breathe easy 
### Nancy Farghalli 
The average person will sleep a
total of 220,000 hours in their life
time, but over 40 million Ameri
cans experience difficulties sleep
ing.
Medical research at Stanford,
however, is trying to help shrink
these numbers by educating the
sleeping public about reducing the
effects of sleep disorders.
Some sleep disorders include
snoring, sleep fragmentation and
daytime sleepiness. One of the
most common sleeping problems,
sleep apnea, is characterized by a
partial or complete cessation of
breathing during slumber.
When a person goes to sleep,
they travel in and out of five levels
of sleep. Four levels constitute non

rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,
while the deepest level is known as
REM sleep.
When a person enters REM
sleep, their body enters a stage of
deep relaxation. As the throat mus
cles relax, they fall against the air
way and reduce its opening. For
most people, this creates no prob
lem.
However, people with apnea
experience complete blockage of
the airway when the throat relaxes.
The brain suffers from the lack of
oxygen and rouses the sleeper
enough to breathe without fully
waking.
The lack of air returns the
sleeper into one of the four lighter
levels of slumber. Thus, the throat
regains its muscular tone and the
airway is able to open, letting oxy

gen pass through. This condition
hampers a person from getting any
real sleep.
For a person afflicted with
obstructive sleep apnea, the cycle of
sleeping and nearly waking can
occur 20 to 100 times in one hour.
Dr. Nelson Powell, clinical assis
tant professor of psychiatry at
Stanford, says the person will wake
up after 12 hours asleep "feeling as
if they never went to sleep or just
as tired as they were when they
went to sleep."
Additionally, sleep apnea can
cause sleep deprivation, memory
loss, daytime sleepiness, and
depression. The preferred medical
treatment for curbing sleep apnea
is a device called continuous posi
tive air pressure, or CPAP, a nose
mask that provides a continuous
air stream into the nostrils. The
mask is slightly uncomfortable to
wear, but it does prevent apnea
from happening during the course
of the night, Powell said.
Dr. David Terris, a laser special
ist in the Stanford Medical School,
also treats patients for sleep distur
bances such as chronic snoring. He
advocates a laser surgery technique
that originated in France that
seems to inhibit snoring.
The Laser Assisted Uvulo-
Palatoplasty (LAUP) technique
was developed in 1990 and is per
formed under local anesthesia as
outpatient surgery.
The surgery tries to inhibit
snoring by cutting trenches in the
soft palate—the roof of the
mouth—and reshaping the tissue.
The laser surgery is ideal for people
who snore, Terris said.
While advocating surgery, he
still acknowledges the value of the
non-surgical CPAP procedure as a
way to prevent sleep apnea. "The
procedure is excellent for treating
sleep apnea and provides safety in
the night for the sleeper, but it is
after the fact. If taken off, the
sleeper will begin to suffer the par
tial or complete blockage of the air
way," Terris said.
Most people who receive the
surgery have had problems with
snoring for a long time. Roger
Sperry, a sixth grade teacher,

heard about the surgery performed
by Dr. Terris and elected to experi
ence the 15 minute procedure.
"My snoring does not really par
ticularly bother me, but it does both
er my wife and other family mem
bers in other rooms," Sperry said.
The success rate for the LAUP
in curing snoring is high. About 85
percent of the patients are com
pletely cured of snoring while 10
percent experience a great
improvement in their condition.
However, most people need the
laser procedure two times before
any definite change occurs.
Many researchers, including
Terris, are now looking at the laser
procedure feasibility for helping
sleep apnea. However, not all peo
ple who snore experience sleep
apnea; in fact, only two to four per
cent of adults suffer the disease.
Terris is now studying the
laser's safety in helping mild
apnea. "The question is whether it
is safe to do the laser surgery pro
cedure with sleep apnea patients

and then send them home the same
day,"he said.
Some sleep researchers, includ
ing Powell, are hesitant about the
laser surgery. "The problem is that
this is a relatively new area of
medicine and not all physicians
understand the complex nature of
obstructive sleep apnea and its
relationship to snoring," he said.
"If patients are treated to elimi
nate snoring without a full evalua
tion [of their problem!, they may
lose the very symptom that signals
their obstructive breathing disor
der without the underlying prob
lem ever being diagnosed," he
explained.
At Stanford, especially during
Dead Week, students don't really
need to worry about sleep apnea or
laser procedure to reduce snoring
problems. "For the diagnosis of
sleep apnea, we are really consider
ing the population who are above
30 to 40 years old," Powell said .
The problem at Stanford is not
snoring which may lead to sleep

apnea; instead most students here
are likely suffering from sleep
deprivation. The demands of
studying, socializing, athletics, or
work can easily harm a student's
ability to sleep well. Sleep depriva
tion or lack of restful sleep can eas
ily lead to a decrease of cognitive
ability skills such as reasoning.
"A student may have been far
better off if he or she decided to
close the book and go to sleep,"
Powell said. Although he is cur
rently working on a device that will
enable people to find out if they
face a sleep debt, Powell still
believes that the most important
device in solving sleep disorders
and problems is education.
By realizing the importance of
sleep, people can then begin to
understand and create helpful
treatment programs. At the college
level, students need to learn that
sleep is not something that should
be forgone. "Sleepy students don't
learn, and they don't do well in
class," Powell warned.

Before and after shots of the laser assisted uvulo-palatoplasty
surgery technique show the changes in the uvula that help solve the
problem of snoring. Before surgery, the uvula retains its normal
hanging shape, but after the operation the flap is almost gone.
