# Source of calcium wave propagation recently discovered in brain

Something strange happened in the laboratory
one day: Stephen Smith, now professor in the
Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology
at Stanford, witnessed brain cells called astro
cytes lighting up in the petri dish.
Conducting an experiment on neurons, his lab
oratory group at Yale was using fluorescent
probes to detect the propagation of calcium
waves, one of the prime indicators of neural activ
ity, in a culture of nerve cells.
Intermingled in the neurons, however, were
astrocytes, kept there to nourish the neurons.
Apparently, the astrocytes were also generating
calcium waves, causing them to glow with each
passing wave.
This accidental encounter is changing the way
scientists think about glial cells.
The brain is composed approximately equally
of two types of cells, neurons and neuroglia, which
form elaborate intertwined networks. Neurons
thought to be the powerhouses of the brain with
their ability to generate electrical impulses—have
been the primary focus of past research.
Neuroglia, with no visible or chemical traits
that would support their ability to communicate
with other cells, were dismissed as merely being
the 'glue' that supported the neurons of the brain.
Glial cells can be separated into Schwann cells
in the body and oligodendrocytes and astrocytes
in the brain. Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes
myelinate, or insulate, the axons of nerve cells,
allowing electrical impulses to transmit quickly.
Past research has revealed that astrocytes help
nourish neurons, acting as a liaison between the
blood vessels and the neurons themselves. They
also insure the proper functioning of neurons by
wrapping themselves around synapses, absorbing
excess neurotransmitter that would impede neu
ronal function, and buffering against excess
potassium discharged when neurons fire action
potentials.
Scientists' initial perceptions of glial cells were
derived from these 'housekeeping' abilities. How
ever, this view is changing due to laboratory work
in the area performed by Smith and Barbara Bar
res, assistant professor of neurobiology at the
Stanford Medical School.
"The traditional view is that the neurons ...
are the crucial players in information processing
and ... the glial cells are just coating them, being
passive support cells," Barres said. Its possible
that [glial cells] could be playing more active roles
in the function of the central nervous system in
information processing and signaling," she said.
A recent discovery has been made about glial
cells, particularly astrocytes: these cells also have
receptors for such primary neurotransmitters as
glutamate. This factor is crucial to Smith s
research, which focuses on studying calcium wave
generation by astrocytes.
Smith indicated that calcium waves are übiq
uitous regulatory cell signals in cell biology; they

control the activity of specific cells according to
the cells' designated functions. For example, calci
um waves control how much muscle cells con
tract. In nerve cells, calcium induces neurotrans
mitter secretion and regulates neuron excitabili
ty, allowing neurons to process information.
The glutamate released by synapses in the con
duction of action potentials stimulates the release
of calcium in the astrocytes. The calcium can be
observed as it moves through the cells in waves
through the use of fluorescent calcium indicators.
The calcium waves may function in astrocytes
in the same way that action potentials function in
neurons. "Here's this unexpected phenomenon
suggestive of a signaling role for a kind of brain
cell that wasn't supposed to play a signaling role,"
Smith said.
Other ground-breaking research has revealed
that astrocytes may actually provide 'feedback,'
playing a role in influencing neurons. In response
to the calcium waves of astrocytes, neurons create
their own calcium signals. While various hypothe
ses may explain this, the specific mechanisms
remain unknown.
While neural networks process short-term
information, Smith suggests that astrocytic net
works may process longer-term information,
because calcium waves propagate much more

slowly than action potentials. Astrocytes may con
trol long-term functions such as mood, motiva
tional state, attention, memory and learning and
the circadian rhythm of the brain.
However, scientists specify that there are limi
tations, because experimentation has been done
only in vitro involving cultured neuroglia and
neurons.
"When you take a specific cell type out of an
organism and put it into culture, you'll get a mix
ture of normal responses of the cell and others
that just happen to come about as artifacts in cell
culture," Smith said. Smith's lab has been focus
ing on experiments to generate the same calcium
waves in brain slice preparations from rats.
"In every case we've looked, we've seen astro
cytic calcium waves and we've seen those astro
cytic calcium waves can be triggered by neural
activity, particularly by the activity of neurons
that we know release glutamate," Smith said.
Future experiments to determine the specific
roles of glial cells may use genetic engineering. By
creating mice which lack certain types of glial cells
or protein receptors in the astrocytes, researchers
can observe how this affects the mice. Possibilities
may also exist to actually look inside the brain of
a live animal to observe calcium wave propagation
occurring.
