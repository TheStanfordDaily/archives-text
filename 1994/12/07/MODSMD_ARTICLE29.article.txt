# Deadheads: Head pain chronic in dead week
## 
### Julie Sauer Editorial staff 
Now that Dead Week is
M M here, I am walking
vJT around with a (large) cup
of coffee in one hand and a bottle
of aspirin in the other, but my
headaches still persist. Why can't
I get rid of these annoying visi
tors?
—having head pains
A: I am walking around with
a larger cup of coffee and a
bigger bottle of aspirin, but
other than that, I know right
where you're coming from.
After weeks of exhaustive
research deep in Lane Medical
Library, I found the answer to
the problem in the American
Medical Association's (AMA)
Encyclopedia of Medicine.
Headaches are caused by ten
sion and stretching in the
meninges — membranes around
the brain — and in the blood ves
sels and muscles of the scalp.
However, the medical reasons
for headaches are far less impor
tant than the environmental
conditions that stimulate their
development. The external envi-

ronment is responsible
for the frequency and
duration of headaches in
Stanford students.
The AMA's Encyclo
pedia indicates that
"common causes of
headache include hang
over, irregular meals,
prolonged travel, poor
posture, a noisy or stuffy
work environment,
excitement and excessive
sleep."
Let's think about this
for a minute. Except for
the excessive sleep part

(which never happens), this
exactly describes Stanford life.
Assume that the first reason,
hangover, may be responsible for
an occasional weekend headache,
but not these persistent ones
that you're complaining about,
especially during Dead Week.
(Maybe after finals, but not

before).
This still leaves us with the
perfect explanation for your head
pains and mine. If I'm not mis
taken, you set your alarm for
8:50 a.m. to get ready for 9:00
a.m. class, lie in bed for 15 min
utes dreading the thought of get
ting out of bed, and then force
one leg after the other out of the
covers.
This is a great accomplish
ment in and of itself. While
you're still congratulating your
self for being only 10 minutes
late for class, you can't even
begin to think about breakfast,
except for the requisite caffeine
in the form of coffee or diet
coke.
After the first morning class,
the others are OK, if you can
withstand the prolonged stress
of navigating the chaotic 10 am.
bike traffic in the Quad. You
should be safe as long as you
don't make eye contact with
oncoming traffic.
You spend a few hours in a
stuffy classroom, often without
windows, where the person at the
next desk is close enough to drool
on you when they fall asleep. The
only way to stay awake is to
slouch way down in the desk and

concentrate really
hard on forcing your
eyelids open.
Next it's on to
Green Library for a
few hours of intense
studying or sleeping;
in either case you'll be
slouched over with
your face in the book
or in the rough fuzz of
the low Green 'read
ing' chairs.
You can be
sound asleep enough
to pass for dead, but
your sixth sense tells

you when its 6:00 p.m. and time
to rush to dinner.
Add it all up, and you have the
perfect prescription for a pro
longed headache that lasts all
Dead Week. Nothing can help,
except maybe primal scream,
which may cause others pain but
will make you feel a lot better.
