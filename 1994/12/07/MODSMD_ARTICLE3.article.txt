# New party policy enacted for fraternity; SAE awaits decision on its future
## Theta Delta Chi avoids social probation 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
While Sigma Alpha Epsilon awaits a Univer
sity decision this week about its housing status
for next year, the Office of Student Activities
decided last week not to put the Theta Delta
Chi fraternity on social probation.
The Interfraternity Council's judicial board
looked into the Theta Delts after a student was
head-butted at one of the fraternity's parties in
mid-October. After the incident, questions
arose about the fraternity's regulation of alco
hol and its regard for student safety at the
party.
"[The University] felt that the Theta Delts
should better handle its parties," said senior
Cyd Zeigler, the Theta Delt president. "They're

giving us time to rework our
party policy."
Members of the fraternity
submitted a new "party plan"
to the Office of Student Activi
ties Monday.
The plan was basically "a
comprehensive restating of
the University's policies," Zei
gler said.
The Theta Delts have not

held any social events since the board began its
review, but that restriction will be lifted next
quarter, according to Zeigler.
"They went through the standard Greek ju
dicial process," said Fraternal Affairs Advisor
Heather Dunn. "They worked really hard all
year long as a fraternity. Overall, they're doing

a greatjob."
The future of the SAEs, on the other hand, is
less certain. The IFC judicial board gave recom
mendations for disciplinary actions against the
fraternity to the Dean of Students Office near
ly two weeks ago, and a decision is expected to
be handed down sometime this week, according
to Diana Conklin, associate director for Resi
dential Education.
Dunn refused to comment on the board's
recommendations, saying only that they "were
nothing drastic."
"Nothing has been finalized, but [the SAEs]
are not being kicked off campus or anything,"
she said.
