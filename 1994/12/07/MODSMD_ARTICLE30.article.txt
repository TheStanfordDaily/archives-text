Trespasser zapped
Residents in Stern Hall and ZAP were alarmed
recently when a suspicious-looking man tres
passed on the premises.
Stanford Police arrested 49-year-old Alfred
Williamson Nov. 23, and booked him on charges of
trespassing and failure to pay outstanding traffic
warrants totaling $1,145.
A Stern resident alerted police that someone
"acting strangely" was spotted on the first floor
and in the second floor bathrooms of Twain
North, said Stanford Police Sergeant John
McMullen. The witness called immediately
because of recent thefts in the area, he added.
According to McMullen, police also received
reports of a suspicious trespasser in ZAP the same
day.
Working from the witness' description, police
located Williamson two hours later in the Cowell
Cluster parking lot where a community service
officer spotted a man matching Williamson's
description and contacted the police dispatcher.
Once police apprehended Williamson, they
searched his car for stolen goods and recovered
two wallets containing cash, but no identifica
tions. One was a woman's wallet, the other, a
man's.
Police were able to arrest Williamson after they
brought in a witness to identify him.
The stolen wallets remain in police custody and
McMullen urges anyone who has recently report-

Ed a stolen wallet to contact the station.
Woods identified as victim
U.S. Amateur Golf champion Tiger Woods
identified himself as the Stanford freshman
mugged at knife-point last week in the Stern Hall
parking lot.
"People get mugged everyday and mine was
just an isolated incident," he said. "I just want to
move on from this, bury this in the past."
On his way back from an outing late last
Wednesday night, Woods, 18, was suddenly
attacked from behind, said Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington. His attacker first held a knife
to his throat and then knocked him to the ground
with the knife's handle, ultimately fleeing the
scene with Woods' watch and gold chain.
"We just think it was a random hit," Herring
ton said.
Woods was able to provide a partial description
of the thief. The suspect was described as a male
about 5 feet 9 inches tall, 180 pounds, with a mus
cular build.
"I just want to get through my finals, enjoy a
great Christmas and then come back," Woods said.
Over the last three years, Herrington said there
has been an average of one to two robberies like
this per year.
Herrington stressed, however, that students
"need to be a little more cautious" and should be
aware that such crimes do occur on campus.
