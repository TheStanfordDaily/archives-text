# Grape Committee holds last forum
## After final set of meetings, report to be submitted to Rice 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
This spring, table grapes may not be
included in campus fruit baskets.
On Monday night the Grape Policy
Committee and 35 students gathered
together in Cedro lounge to discuss the
possibility of a campus-wide grape boy
cott.
Though another open forum held last
week in Kresge Auditorium was supposed
to be the committee's last, that meeting
format was criticized because it was too
formal and not properly publicized,
resulting in low turnout.
In response to this criticism, Political
Science Prof. Luis Fraga, the committee
chair, organized this week's more infor
mal meeting.
Fraga said the meeting allowed the
committee — which was formed in
response to student protesters' demands
during a hunger strike last spring — to
gain new perspectives on student opinion.
"It is always good to hear from individuals
who have strong opinions about an issue,"
he said.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid
James Montoya, who sits on the commit
tee, said the meeting was effective. "This

was the one opportunity that [gave] the
broader community ... a chance to
express its opinion," he said. "Tonight's
discussion provided for a healthy
exchange."
During the discussion, many students
voiced a firm commitment to the grape
boycott. "It is not just about the pesticides
but it is also a social issue," said sopho
more Linda Prieto. "We have to think
about the poor farmers and the bad quali
ty of housing and working conditions."
Though the majority of students pre
sent favored the boycott, some were
unclear about why the committee's atten
tion was focused on grapes when pesti
cides are used to grow many other types of
fruits and vegetables.
In response to these questions, Fraga
said, "Since 1984, the United Farm Work
ers have made a specific strategic decision
to boycott grapes. They have focused on
grapes because it used to be that grape
pesticides were very severe."
Fraga explained that in the last 10
years the use of pesticides has declined.
However, substantial amounts of chemi
cals are still used to grow numerous crops,
including grapes.
Lupita Montoya, a graduate student in
environmental engineering, said another

reason to target grapes for a boycott is
because they are one of the largest crops
produced in California.
"Grapevines are comparable to people
in size," she said. "Because of this, and
because grapes require the most tending,
grape workers are the laborers most
exposed to pesticides."
Throughout the quarter, the commit
tee has been busy gathering information
from various sources in order to make a
responsible recommendation to Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper.
"There is no question that we have
more than enough information to make a
strong report," said Fraga. "We have
gathered information from scientific
resources, and we have heard from the
two major sides on this issue."
The committee has heard from several
groups opposed to a grape boycott. Fraga
said the group has been contacted by a
representative from the Grape Workers
and Farmers Coalition and has spent time
interviewing a worker from a pesticide
monitoring group.
"These groups agree that there is a
misinformation campaign being waged by
the United Farm Workers," he said. "We

have talked to many religious orga
nizations and others who for vari
ous reasons have decided not to
support the boycott."
Now that the committee has fin
ished gathering information, they

must meet together to develop a
viable recommendation.
"We will try to come to a mean
ingful and inclusive understanding
by the end of the quarter," Fraga
said. "However, if we need an
extension we will ask the provost."
Fraga added he expects that the
committee's final set of meetings
will be a time for it to "fight, argue,
discuss and cry if necessary."
