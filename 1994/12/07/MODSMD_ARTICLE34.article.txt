# Stanford likely in compliance with clean air objectives, survey says
## 
### Jennifer Brody 
Preliminary reports indicate that
Stanford is in compliance with the Bay
Area Air Quality Management District's
clean air objectives through 1999, accord
ing to the University's Transportation
Programs Office.
The clean air objectives, which were
established in 1992 as the local response
to the federal Clean Air Act, required all
Bay Area businesses with 100 or more
employees to turn in surveys by Nov. 30
about their employees' transportation
habits. Businesses exceeding a certain
ratio of employees to vehicles — as calcu
lated by the district — would be required
to establish a program to reduce the
number of drivers.
Though official word on the survey
results won't be available from the dis
trict until early 1995, Stanford will prob
ably meet those standards, said Jeffrey
Tumlin, projects manager of the Trans
portation Programs Office.
Without government-assisted fund
ing, small businesses are scrambling to

start these programs from scratch. But
Stanford and its 14,000 employees
already have an entire transportation
office to deal with the new regulation.
"It's been relatively easy for us
because we already have a full trans
portation planning staff," said Tumlin,
who graduated from Stanford with a
degree in Urban Studies in 1991.
Tumlin expects Stanford to pass the
district's stringent requirements with
flying colors because of its already-estab
lished commuter' alternative incentives,
such as the 1992 Guaranteed Ride Home
program and the 1994 Clean Air Credit
project.
Most businesses will also have to con
tinue conducting the surveys every two
years to meet the district's increasing
standards. Tumlin said the results from
Stanford's survey indicate, though, that
Stanford will be in compliance for the
next five years — the duration of the reg
ulation.
But if the district determines that not
enough people take advantage of the
options Stanford offers, it will have to file

an employee trip-reduction plan. Tumlin
said that would be easy, also, because
Stanford's already existing projects
would satisfy this requirement.
"We already have a plan if we don't
pass," said Tumlin. "Stanford is sitting
better than just about any other business
in the Bay Area."
The challenge in the process was
determining who are Stanford's employ
ees.
"I think it would be impossible for us
to count the total number of employees,"
said Tumlin. "We're not just an employ
er, we're a city.
"Besides the full-time staff, we think
[our employees] include most of our grad
uate students on fellowships, some of the
employees at [Stanford Linear Accelera
tor] and Stanford Hospital personnel," he
said. "It was too difficult to locate individ
uals, so we did an electronic mail survey."
But Stanford was at the forefront of
commuter travel long before the age of e
mail and government mandates. Accord
ing to Julia Fremon, Transportation Pro
grams manager, Stanford has been pro

moting transportation alternatives since
1985 and has had a shuttle service since
the University's inception in 1891.
"There's always been some kind of
campus shuttle," said Fremon. "The
Marguerite shuttle evolved from a taxi."
With Stanford using up its land, the
transportation office was created to man
age an increasingly complex parking sys
tem. While 23 percent of Stanford's
employees ride bicycles to work, Tumlin
said, 60 percent drive. Stanford is among
the few private employers in Santo Clara
County to charge its employees for parking.
Although Tumlin said there are no
new expenses associated with the govern
ment regulations, the office currently
spends $1,000 a year per parking space,
$500,000 a year for the Marguerite shut
tle and $230,000 for the remaining com
muter programs.
"We don't want to raise the price of
parking permits," said Tumlin. "It's
cheaper to pay people not to drive than it
is to build more parking structures."
So for the last two years, Tumlin said
the office worked on a program that sub

sidizes people instead of parking
"We weren't providing much to people
who don't drive," said Tumlin. "No
amount of free T-shirts, raffles and nice
stories in the company newsletter are
going to get people out of their cars. You
have to provide real incentves that
reflect the costs associated wth trans
portation."
The result was the 1994 Clean Air
Credit program. Although Stanford had
offered earpools, vanpools, discount tran
sit passes, route selection seivices and
the shuttle for many years, it's only now
that commuters can earn $701 worth of
credits per year to spend on transporta
tion-related products and services.
"It's all the people in the margin we're
trying to capture, and here al Stanford
there are a lot of them," said Tjmlin.
Over the next two years tie depart
ment will concentrate on pro
grams in an effort to reduce htzards for
pedestrians caused by the tnmendous
number of cyclists on campis. Thou
sands of bicycle racks will also be
installed over the next few morths.
