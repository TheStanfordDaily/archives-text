Students in the Stanford Sym
phony Orchestra will act as "musi
cal ambassadors" to China next
summer in a tour that coincides
with University President Gerhard
Casper's efforts to build links
between Stanford and the Pacific
Rim.
Casper, who is very involved in
the tour, has agreed to be an hon
orary chair of the tour committee
and offered $20,000 to support the
trip, said Jean Fetter, assistant to
the president.
Fetter added that Casper has
also invited the Chinese Ambas
sador to the United States to be an
honorary co-chair of the tour,

though the ambassador has not
officially responded yet.
"This is the first invitation of
this kind that I have seen Casper
extend," she said.
Although the original idea for
the China tour came from the stu
dents themselves, Casper has iden
tified the orchestra's tour as a way
to raise Stanford's profile in the
Pacific Rim, said Elisa Ong, chair of
the tour committee.
"This is a great opportunity to
showcase what the University is
like. The symphony orchestra is
made up of all backgrounds, iruy'ors
and degree levels," Ong said. "It
represents a broad cross-section of
the University."
The orchestra has received sup
port for past tours from the Uni

versity, but it has "never had so
much support from the President's
Office before," Ong said. "Not just
in supporting the tour financially,
but Casper has offered great sup
port and publicity as honorary
chairman of the tour."
The Student Committee of the
Symphony Orchestra began plan
ning the tour last year, choosing
the People's Republic of China and
Hong Kong as its destinations. The
group chose China "almost unani
mously" as the destination for the
tour, said graduate student Matt
Springer, publicity chair for the
tour group. The tour will last from
June 22 through July 8.
"We tiy to give each tour special
meaning," Ong said. "China is very
important for our group if you look

at Stanford interests. And as a
country it is changing so rapidly,
it's an exciting time to be there
right now."
Although the tour was planned
before Casper's October announce
ment to begin an Asia / Pacific
Scholars Program at Stanford — a
scholarship program similar to the
Rhodes scholarships at Oxford Uni
versity — Springer called the
orchestra's plans to tour China
"good timing."
"The tour seems to be some
thing that the University is taking
notice of and incorporating as part
of their campaign to build bridges
between China, the United States
and Stanford," said Elisabeth
