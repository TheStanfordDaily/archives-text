Students in the Stanford Sym
phony Orchestra will act as "musi
cal ambassadors" to China next
summer in a tour that coincides
with University President Gerhard
Casper's efforts to build links
between Stanford and the Pacific
Rim.
Casper, who is very involved in
the tour, has agreed to be an hon
orary chair of the tour committee
and offered $20,000 to support the
trip, said Jean Fetter, assistant to
the president.
Fetter added that Casper has
also invited the Chinese Ambas
sador to the United States to be an
honorary co-chair of the tour,

though the ambassador has not
officially responded yet.
"This is the first invitation of
this kind that I have seen Casper
extend," she said.
Although the original idea for
the China tour came from the stu
dents themselves, Casper has iden
tified the orchestra's tour as a way
to raise Stanford's profile in the
Pacific Rim, said Elisa Ong, chair of
the tour committee.
"This is a great opportunity to
showcase what the University is
like. The symphony orchestra is
made up of all backgrounds, iruy'ors
and degree levels," Ong said. "It
represents a broad cross-section of
the University."
The orchestra has received sup
port for past tours from the Uni

versity, but it has "never had so
much support from the President's
Office before," Ong said. "Not just
in supporting the tour financially,
but Casper has offered great sup
port and publicity as honorary
chairman of the tour."
The Student Committee of the
Symphony Orchestra began plan
ning the tour last year, choosing
the People's Republic of China and
Hong Kong as its destinations. The
group chose China "almost unani
mously" as the destination for the
tour, said graduate student Matt
Springer, publicity chair for the
tour group. The tour will last from
June 22 through July 8.
"We tiy to give each tour special
meaning," Ong said. "China is very
important for our group if you look

at Stanford interests. And as a
country it is changing so rapidly,
it's an exciting time to be there
right now."
Although the tour was planned
before Casper's October announce
ment to begin an Asia / Pacific
Scholars Program at Stanford — a
scholarship program similar to the
Rhodes scholarships at Oxford Uni
versity — Springer called the
orchestra's plans to tour China
"good timing."
"The tour seems to be some
thing that the University is taking
notice of and incorporating as part
of their campaign to build bridges
between China, the United States
and Stanford," said Elisabeth
Christensen, president of the
orchestra's student committee.
The tour's goals include educat
ing the Stanford community about
Chinese culture both in the United
States and overseas. The symphony
orchestra is offering a Chinese per

formance and lecture series, as well
as numerous concerts at Stanford
and in San Francisco, before they
embark on the trip.
"In this tour more than ever we
are trying to involve the communi
ty in the tour effort, and give them
the opportunity to learn about Chi
nese culture," Springer said.
The orchestra is recognizing the
heritage of early Chinese settlers as
part of their educational goals,

including those Chinese immi
grants who helped build Stanford,
Ong said.
The tour group will give a recital
in Sze Yup, a region of southern
China which was the home of many
of the original Chinese immigrants
to the United States, Springer said.
China holds a special signifi
cance for the orchestra's members
because many of them come from
Chinese-American backgrounds or

directly from Singapore or Hong
Kong, Springer said.
This will be the third tour the
Stanford Symphony Orchestra has
made in the last 10 years. The
orchestra performed in Japan, Sin
gapore and South Korea in 1988,
and traveled to Eastern Europe in
1991. Both previous tours were
included as part of the Stanford
Centennial celebration, Springer
said.
