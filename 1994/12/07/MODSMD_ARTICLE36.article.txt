As they plan for the next phase of renova
tions, housing officials said they were pleased to
learn that recently renovated campus resi
dences received high marks from students in a
Housing Facilities and Services survey on last
summer's housing improvements.
In order to find out how they are doing on
their 10-year Capital Improvement Program
(CIP), officials distributed surveys in October to
gauge students' satisfaction with renovations in
Florence Moore Hall, Phi Sig, 553 Mayfield,
Hammarskjold House and Escondido Village.
On a five-point scale, Flo Mo received a 4.1,
Phi Sig a 4.7, 553 Mayfield a 4.1 and Ham
marskjold a 4.2 (higher is better). Escondido
received a 6.2 on a 7 point scale.
Students were asked to rank student rooms,
lounges and common areas, the exteriors and

the overall dining and kitchen areas.
This year's results were "basically very stable
and remarkably similar" to last year's results,
said Rodger Whitney, director of Housing Facil
ities and the improvement program organizer.
Last year, Wilbur Hall and the Beta house
received a 4.2, while Muwekma-Tah-Ruk
received a 4.1.
Housing officials are currently using the sur
veys as suggestions for this summer's renova
tion plans for Stern Hall, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
Escondido Village, Slavianskii Dom, Haus Mit
teleuropa, Grove Mayfield and the infrastruc
ture of Grove Lasuen.
"We want to be sure to repeat the things
we're doing right," Whitney said. "As we plan
for Stern we want to make sure we're on the
right track."
The housing renovation plan is a $110 mil
lion project targeted at making all Row houses,
older dorms and Escondido Village more con

temporary by adding new furniture, computer
wiring, upgraded dining facilities and other
improvements.
"We want to bring the buildings up to the
'90s and beyond," Whitney said.
One of the dorms students are most anxious
to see renovated this summer is Stern Hall.
Housing Facilities and Services started plan
ning Stern's renovations more than a year ago
and is almost finished with this process. Con
struction will begin this June.
"Stern should be a very fine project," Whit
ney said. "It's the one dorm that everyone ques
tioned what they could do with it. But there are
big opportunities with nice courtyards and large
lounges."
"The most dramatic change will be moving
the computer clusters out of the basement onto
the first floor," said Burbank Resident Fellow
