Where's Mac Arthur when you need
him?
There wasn't much Washington
coach Bill Neville could do except hope
for the return of the legendary general
as his Huskies saw their NCAA life
extinguished by second-ranked Stan
ford Saturday afternoon in Maples
Pavilion. The Cardinal (28-1) swept No.
22 Washington (16-13) , 15-5, 15-11,
15-3, in the second round of the NCAA
women's volleyball tournament.

Korean War," Neville said. "They just
keep coming at you in waves. They give
their opponents no breaks."
While the loss meant the end of the
road for his Huskies, Neville implied
that it couldn't have happened against
a better qualified squad.
"Stanford is an outstanding team,"
he said. "You could make the argument
that they are the best collection of colle
giate volleyball players ever assembled.
"I love playing against Stanford, not
because I'm a masochist but because
they make you improve your game," he
continued. "They are tactically sound
and make all the necessary adjust

ments. They force you to adjust.
actually good for our team in the long
run."
The Huskies took an early 2-0 lead in
the first game, capitalizing on a couple
of Stanford hitting errors. Then those
waves that Neville referred to crashed
into Washington's front lines.
Junior outside hitter Marnie
Triefenbach stepped back to serve and
when her tour of duty was done, the
Cardinal had taken a 7-2 advantage.
Her powerful jump serve caused prob
lems for the Huskies, resulting in two
aces and a number of mispassed balls. ,
Stanford had punched out four more
points before Washington got on the board
again, and by then the initial battle was all
but won. While the Huskies succeeded in
denying the Cardinal game point sevqn

ton's side of the court.
The Huskies put up a much
tougher fight in the second game.
Led by All-Pacific 10 Conference
team selection sophomore Angela
Bransom, Washington managed to
keep the score close until Stanford's
junior setter Caiy Wendell dug out
one of Bransom's wicked attacks,
allowing freshman Lisa Sharpley to
set Folkl for the winning kill.
The Cardinal ran out to a 13-1
lead in the third game. Senior Anne
Wicks ended the contest by knock
ing down an over-passed Husky
serve reception, catapulting Stan
ford into the round of 16.
"I'm pretty pleased with the way
we played," Stanford head coach
Don Shaw said. "We did it with our
offense and some pretty good

defense. We passed well and when
this team passes the ball well, we
have a lot of weapons to go to.
"We're rejuvenated now that
we're in the playoffs," he continued.
"The team has definitely picked up
the intensity and energy level."
Bransom was the Huskies' lead
ing attacker with 15 kills and a .481
hitting percentage. Junior Dragana
Djordevic added 11 kills, while
freshman Makare Desilets regis
tered seven.
"We didn't really manage to stop
Bransom," Shaw said. "But they
didn't really stop us either."
The Cardinal registered a .449
team average, the fifth-highest sin
gle* match percentage in the Pac-10
this season and well above Stan
ford's .300 average on the year.
The high score was largely due to
outside hitters Folkl and Triefen
bach. Folkl hammered home 20
kills and hit .536 while Triefenbach
had 17 and hit .500.
