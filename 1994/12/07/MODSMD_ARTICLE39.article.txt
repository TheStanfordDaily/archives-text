# Familiar faces on path to Austin

Divine intervention? Abduction by
alien beings?
Is that what it's going to take to stop
the No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball
team in this year's NCAA women's vol
leyball tournament?
Either that or something just as
unusual, according to Washington head
coach Bill Neville.
"It is going to take a celestial outfit
to beat [Stanford] during the course of
this championship," he said moments
after the Cardinal swept his Huskies in
a second-round match at Maples Pavil
ion on Saturday.
The win means that Stanford will
host the West Regionals Thursday and
Friday. Stanford faces No. 15 Arizona
State at 6 p.m. tomorrow evening. The
other regional semifinal match features
a battle between No. 10 USC and No. 16
Arizona. The winners will face off on
Friday evening to determine the West
bracket's representative to the Final
Four in Austin, Texas, Dec. 15 and 17.
While it remains to be seen whether

any of these squads are "celestial"
enough to defeat the Cardinal, one
thing is for certain — they definitely are
familiar. Stanford has played and beat
en each of them twice already this sea
son. So in what has been only half-jok
ingly referred to as "the Pacific 10 Con
ference Tournament," the Cardinal will
not face a non-conference foe unless it
reaches Austin.
"It's definitely easier to play a known
quantity," senior captain Anne Wicks
said. "We know what they do and we
know that we can beat them."
If the Cardinal's division rivals want
the Regionals' results to differ from
those of matches played earlier in the
year, they will have to defeat Stanford
at home in Maples Pavilion, where the
team has only lost two games and no
matches this season. But while being at
home will help the Cardinal, it can cut
the opposite way as well.
"Sometimes it's easier to be on the
road — it seems like you have more
time," Wicks explained. "With Dead
Week and finals, it can get kind of hec
tic. But it's good to play here in front of
a lot of fans. And as a senior, I want to

play as many matches at home as I
can." j
Should Stanford survive the trial by
fire that the West Regional usually is
and get past the Northwest bracket's
champion, it may have the chance tio
play another conference opponent if\
third-ranked UCLA, the top seed in the
South region and the lone squad to
blemish the Cardinal's record in 1994.'
If these two Pac-10 giants collide, tfye
Cardinal's depth could give it an advan
tage. i
"UCI-A's starting lineup is just as
good as any other in the nation,"
Neville said. "But Stanford also
great depth. That doesn't just show up
on the court, but also in practice. Their
practices have to be something."
Stanford players and coaches attest
ed to this fact.
"We use a lot of players," Stanford
head coach Don Shaw said. "We're rest
ed in good shape. We're not wearing
down as the season goes along."
According to junior Marnie Triefen
bach, the team's overall talent helps her
