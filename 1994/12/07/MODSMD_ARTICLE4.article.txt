# Board plan
## Students give input about structure of Tresidder board 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Students charged with defining a new role for
the Tresidder Advisory Board — which oversees
the student union's operations — met with Dean of
Students Michael Jackson yesterday to make their
recommendations regarding the board's composi
tion and reporting structure.
The five students who sit on the board also
echoed the proposals submitted last year by the
Tresidder Task Force concerning new services
which could be brought into the student union.
Among the proposals were a copy center, a fast food
restaurant — possibly Taco Bell — open until 2
a.m. and an expanded Tresidder Express with "af
fordable groceries."
"[Jackson] said most of the ideas were feasible
and were being looked into," said sophomore Kevin
Barenblat, co-chair of the board.
Last year, the Tresidder Task Force, which was
composed of students, faculty and staff, was asked
to study Tresidder and develop a way for it to oper
ate without the University's $700,000 subsidy.
Based on the task force's findings, the Universi
ty brought in the Stanford Management Company
— which manages the Stanford Shopping Center
— to take over Tresidder's retail services in hopes
of eliminating its need for the University subsidy
over the next three years.
Jackson formed the advisory board this year to
oversee Tresidder's operations and asked the
board's student members to look at its role and
make-up. Yesterday, the group recommended to
Jackson that the board consist of eight members,
including four students, a COP
member, the dean of students,
one faculty and one staff mem
ber.
"This year's board will stay
together for the rest of the year . .
. so if the recommendations go
into effect, they won't happen
until next year," Barenblat said.

'If the recommenda
tions go into effect,
they won't happen
until next year.'

The students also recommend
ed that the board meet once or
twice per quarter to discuss
Tresidder affairs but that the
student co-chair meet more fre
quently with Jackson and David
Longbine, manager of the Shop
ping Center, to talk about the
union's day-to-day business
activities.
"We recommended the chair
meet with [Longbine] and the
dean of students to discuss what
companies are coming in [and]
how to do maintenance," Baren
blat said.
According to the proposals, the
board will have two main goals in
the immediate future. First, it
will help the Stanford Manage
ment Company gauge student
interest in an attempt to increase
business at Tresidder. In addi
tion, the board also will serve as
the students' voice during the
changes.
"[Last year's Tresidder Task
Force report] is a good model of
how decisions should be made
in the University," Barenblat
said at a student meeting last
week.
Although no changes to the
retail services have yet been
made, the Stanford Federal Cred
it Union is expected to move into
Tresidder early next quarter.
Other additions recommended by
the task force last year included
an alternative mail service, more
bike racks and small study
rooms.
