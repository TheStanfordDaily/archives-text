Cardinal 68
San Jose Stale 52

Big, small, pretty, messy.
Wins come in all shapes and
sizes, and while the Cardinal
men's basketball team's 68-52
victory last Saturday night over
San Jose State would probably fit
in the category of sloppy and
ugly, a "W" is still a "W." Stan
ford now finds itself streaking
early on in the season with three
"W"s and no "L"'s.
"It was a tough ball game," said
Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "Statistically, you look at
it, and it wasn't really pretty for
either team. From a statistical
standpoint there are things that

you are obviously not very satis
fied with. We've got lots of work to
do. We'll take the wins, and just
try to learn from our mistakes."
The statistics referred to
included: 18 turnovers and 34
percent field-goal shooting. Hard
ly a clinic, but the Spartans had
an even tougher time, registering
20 turnovers, 37.7 percent shoot
ing and a somewhat terrifying 27
personal fouls.
"We had spurts where we
played well, but we got a little
sloppy in our execution," Mont
gomery said. "We need to see
improvement.
"Our execution was not any
where close to where we need it
to be. We obviously didn't play
as well as we're capable of play
ing. We didn't play as well as
I'd like to see us play on a con
sistent basis." The Cardinal
took the inexperienced San
Jose team to school amassing

an early 18-4 lead in the first half.
The Spartans mounted a mid
quarter charge closing the gap to
22-16, but that would be as close
as they would get in the entire
game, in which the Cardinal never
trailed.
The youthful Spartan back
court was victimized throughout
the contest, penalized for travel
ing, in-bounding violations, defen
sive fouls and offensive fouls as
well.
But amidst the chaos generated
by loose balls and flying bodies,
senior Stanford guard David Har
bour thrived. Harbour came off
the bench to lead the Cardinal in
scoring with 16 points and also
added four rebounds.
"Usually I get my game going
by playing defense or throwing my
body around a little bit," Harbour
said. "When the ball's loose, that
gives me a lot of easy opportuni
ties."
The Cardinal hopes to teach
another inexperienced team a
thing or two about basketball this
Saturday as it matches up against
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo. In fact,
this will be Cal Poly's first year in
Division I action, and thus far, the
0-4 Mustangs have taken their
licks against the big boys, posting
a most recent loss to Louisiana
Tech, 63-45.
Stanford will continue its bat
tles against Bay Area opponents
with a showdown December 16
against the University of San
Francisco. Then the team will
take its show on the road against
American University in Washing
ton D.C. and the nationally
ranked Virginia Cavaliers.
"From that point on [against
USFJ I think we'll really get test
ed," Montgomery said. "The ath
leticism and talent really picks up.
USF and American will be big for
us. USF is a talented team, and
American might be in the category
of a road game that might be a
must for us in terms of getting
wins. American is the first game
on that trip. It'll be a big game on
the road."
Virginia and the ensuing game
at home against Wisconsin will
provide a chance for the Cardinal
to gain prominence.
A victory against either won't
be easy at all, although Stanford
did come out with wins against

both teams last year. Virginia wel
comes back All-Atlantic Coast
Conference point guard Corey
Alexander from an ankle injury he
suffered last season. Alexander
teams up with returning stars in
forward Junior Burrough (15
points per game, 7 rebounds last
season), guard Harold Deane (12.3
ppg), and swingman Jason Willi
ford (9.8 ppg, 6.1 rpg) to form a
potent attack, especially from the
perimeter, and if head coach Jeff
Jones allows, on the fast break.
Add Cavalier fab frosh guard Cur
tis Staples (23.6 ppg) to the mix,
and the Cardinal will have its
hands full.
"Winning at Virginia's going to
take a great effort," Montgomery
said. "They have all those guys
back. They're really good defen
sively. They're really athletic and
get really physical. Now with
Corey Alexander back, they're
that much better offensively."
It won't get any easier against
the Badgers, who feature consen
sus pre-season Ail-American
Michael Finley (20.4 ppg, 6.7 rpg)
who has been touted as perhaps
the best small forward in the
nation. Finley also has monstrous

support in the paint with 6-foot
-11, 265-pound center Rashard
Griffith (13.9 ppg, 8.5 rpg), the
Big-10 Conference's top big man.
The Cardinal escaped Madison
last year with an 83-80 victory
and hope to repeat this season at
home.
"Wisconsin's loaded," Mont
gomery said. "We had a great
game there last year. Everybody's
back essentially. That'll be a real
big test for us. Those two, Vir
ginia and Wisconsin, from a name
standpoint will be the ones that
stand out."
A short respite appears on the
schedule when Cornell comes
into town, but after that the
Pacific 10 Conference season
kicks into gear with the Cardinal
opening the league season Jan. 5
against the Washington Huskies
in Seattle.
"Winning on the road is harder
than winning at home," Mont
gomery said. "Although, if you're
going to be a good basketball
team, if you're going to move up
and be a NCAA-type basketball
team, you have to learn to win on
the road and develop that type of
mental toughness."
