Cardinal 68
San Jose Stale 52

Big, small, pretty, messy.
Wins come in all shapes and
sizes, and while the Cardinal
men's basketball team's 68-52
victory last Saturday night over
San Jose State would probably fit
in the category of sloppy and
ugly, a "W" is still a "W." Stan
ford now finds itself streaking
early on in the season with three
"W"s and no "L"'s.
"It was a tough ball game," said
Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "Statistically, you look at
it, and it wasn't really pretty for
either team. From a statistical
standpoint there are things that

you are obviously not very satis
fied with. We've got lots of work to
do. We'll take the wins, and just
try to learn from our mistakes."
The statistics referred to
included: 18 turnovers and 34
percent field-goal shooting. Hard
ly a clinic, but the Spartans had
an even tougher time, registering
20 turnovers, 37.7 percent shoot
ing and a somewhat terrifying 27
personal fouls.
"We had spurts where we
played well, but we got a little
sloppy in our execution," Mont
gomery said. "We need to see
improvement.
"Our execution was not any
where close to where we need it
to be. We obviously didn't play
as well as we're capable of play
ing. We didn't play as well as
I'd like to see us play on a con
sistent basis." The Cardinal
took the inexperienced San
Jose team to school amassing
