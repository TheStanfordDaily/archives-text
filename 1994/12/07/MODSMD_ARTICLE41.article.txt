# Four candidates head list as replacement for Walsh
## 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
With recruiting season kicking into high
gear over the next few weeks, the search for
Bill Walsh's replacement as head football
coach has heated up as well.
Four names familiar with Stanford foot
ball have dominated the list of prospects
since Walsh's retirement Nov. 28. Current
assistants Terry Shea and Fred vonAppen
and former assistants Ron Turner and
Tyrone Willingham have all either been
interviewed or have interviews scheduled
tills week-
A main concern has been the likelihood
that the new coach would remain at Stan
ford for a prolonged period of time, working
to build a program rather than use his time
at Stanford as a springboard to the profes
sional head coaching ranks.
Athletic director Ted Leland said that the
, revolving door of coaches can potentially <lia~

appoint many student-athletes. "Denny
fGreen} was here for just three years, and
then Bill was here for three and those
changes can cause a lot of dislocation," he
said.
Since John Ralston's departure in 1971
after nine years as head coach, no Stanford
head coach has been at the Farm for longer
than five years.
With 18 official recruiting visits sched
uled for this weekend and 25 scholarships
available, anything less than a quick
announcement of a new head coach could
dissuade some students from attending
Stanford. National letter-of-intent signing
day is Feb. 1.
Shea, the current offensive coordinator,
has maintained for some time a great deal of
interest in a promotion to head coach of the
Cardinal. Growing up in the Bay Area, he
said that he has dreamed of coaching at
Stanford since he was young.
Before joining Walsh's staff in
1992, Shea was the head coach at
San Jose State, compiling a two
year record of 15-6-2, including a
win over a Green-coached Stanford
team in 1990.
In a moderate surprise, vonAp
pen also tossed his hat into the ring
to be considered as head coach.
VonAppen began his fourth stint as
a member of the Stanford coaching
staff in 1992 when he assumed the
defensive coordinator position.
Previously at Stanford, he
served as defensive coordinator
under Green in 1989 and as defen
sive line coach for Walsh in 1977-78
and in 1982 under Paul Wiggin.
Outside the program, Leland
has interviewed Turner, the offen
sive coordinator for the Chicago
Bears, and Willingham, running
back coach for the Minnesota
Vikings.
