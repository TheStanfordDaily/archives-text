# Grapplers take a tough loss from San Luis Obispo

### Ratha Harntha Contributing writer 
Last Saturday did not turn out to be one of the
Stanford wrestling team's most memorable
nights, as Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo pummeled the
Cardinal, 34-7, in their first Pacific 10 Conference
meet of the season at Burnham Pavilion.
"Cal Poly out-manned us," said Cardinal head
coach Chris Horpel. "Cal Poly was just better than
we were."
The Mustangs jumped out to a big lead, win
ning the first three matches. Cal Poly sophomore
Tyson Rondeau pinned junior 118-pounder Brian
Mcßeth in 6 minutes, 24 seconds to begin the
meet, and juniors Matt Cano (126 pounds) and Ed
Medina (134 pounds) lost their bouts, 11-6 and 5-
2 respectively, to put the Mustangs up 12-0.
Senior Jay Jackson, wrestling at 142 pounds,
stopped Cal Poly's streak by dominating the Mus
tang's junior Matt Cowan, 10-2. But that was not
enough for the Cardinal, as Cal Poly
captured five of the last six bouts
and dropped the Cardinal to 1-1 in
the Pac-10.
The two individual victories, at
least, provided bright spots, accord
ing to Horpel. "I was really pleased
to see [sophomore] Bryan Vaniman
beat his opponent," he said. "Jay
wrestled well and [freshman] Jeff
Grant looked good. I was a little dis
appointed in some of the other
matches."
The 190-pound Vaniman scored
a 9-5 victory over Cal Poly junior
Dan Lashley, who had beaten Vani
man twice earlier this season.
"I overcame previous errors and
came off with a win," Vaniman said.
"I'm pleased with the way things
went."
In the closest contest of the
night, Mustang senior Clark
Conover slipped past Grant in the
158-pound weight division. With
less than 30 seconds remaining in
the bout, Grant escaped from the
grasp of Conover, closing the Mus
tang's lead to 3-4, but that proved to
be the last point scored in the
match.
"Evervone made mistakes,"

Vaniman said. "They took advan
tage of our errors and one error
turns close matches."
Injuries also played a part in the
dual meet, with five Cardinal
starters out of the lineup. Also,
177-pound sophomore Roger Liu
wrestled with a nagging neck
injury that allowed Cal Poly sopho
more Jeremiah Miller to pin him in
2:56.
"There were a lot of close match
es," said freshman heavyweight
Mark Neglay. "We had bad luck in a
couple of matches. A lot of us felt
like we could have beaten the guys
we wrestled."
The Cardinal now has over a
month before its next dual meet to
rest and heal.
"This is coming at a good time,"
Horpel said. "We've been going hard
since the first week of school. We
can recover from injuries."
Stanford has three weeks to pre
pare for its next competition, the
Oregon Classic on Dec. 29 in Cor
vallis, Ore. The Cardinal will only
take a partial team of six or seven
wrestlers because of budget con
straints and the health of the ath
letes on the team.
"We have lots of time to correct
our mistakes," Vaniman said. "All
of us realize that we have stuff to
work on. We am concentrate on the
technique part of wrestling."
