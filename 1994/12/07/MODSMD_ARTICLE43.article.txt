Cardinal 78
NC State 63

The Stanford women's bas
ketball team bounced back from
its worst defeat under head coach
Tara VanDerveer with a 78-63
victory over the North Carolina

State Wolfpack last Saturday
night in Raleigh, N.C.
After the already infamous
debacle at Tennessee, the Cardi
nal utilized veteran leadership
and front-court depth in order to
overcome a 10-point deficit in the
first half on the way to its third
victory of the young, nonconfer
ence season.
VanDerveer paid significant
attention to the game, coming off
the loss last week. "I wish we
didn't have to bounce back so far,

but it was real important for us to
keep our composure," she said.
Senior point guard Kate Paye led
Stanford with 17 points and 11
rebounds. Senior center Anita
Kaplan, starting slowly as she recov
ers from Lost game's back injury,
helped the Cardinal pull away in the
second half with 14 points, fill com
ing after the intermission.
VanDerveer's squad struggled in
the game's incipient stages, as the
Wolfpack shot well early. Multiple
three-point goals by N.C. State's

Tammy Gibson allowed the under
dog to break out to a 25-15 lead with
11 minutes lefl in the half.
The Cardinal then fought back
with a 9-0 run of its own, keyed by
reserve guard Charmin Smith's
three pointer. The game entered
halftime with the Wolfpack leading
by one point with scoring by Vanessa
Nygaard, Heather Owen, and Naomi
Mulitauaopele to help the Cardinal
stay even until halftime.
A different Stanford squad came
out of the locker room for the second
half, looking to crash the boards and
take advantage of its size. "We had to
work harder defensively, especially
on Gibson and Howard," said Van-
Derveer. "We emphasized [at half

time] getting some more offensive
boards."
VanDerveer's squad held the hot
shooting N.C. State guards to one
point in the second half compared to
14 in the first. They also hit the glass
hard, pulling down 11 offensive
boards in the second half alone.
The Stanford defense allowed for
only 32 percent field goal shooting by
the Wolfpack, which inspired it to an
18-6 run that left N.C. State down
12 with less than three minutes to
play.
"The key to this victory was our
depth," VanDerveer said. "I thought
Charmin Smith had the best game of
her career. We also got good scoring
inside from the bench. We're very

competitive within the team right
now, which is good."
The team now prepares for a
heavy holiday stretch with a poten
tial six games before the opening of
the Pacific 10 Conference season on
Jan. 5 against Washington. The Car
dinal begins a home stand this Sat
urday night against Cal State-
Fullerton before the Ninth Annual
Fry's Cardinal Classic on Dec. 17.
Stanford then hosts Providence
and the University of San Diego
before heading to Santa Clara for the
final nonconference match-up of the
season. After their game against the
Huskies, Pac-10 competition contin
ues against Washington State, also
at home.
