# Women swimmers serve notice
## Cardinal dominates numerous events in Texas Invite

« Over the weekend, the Stan
ford women's swimming and div-
Jing team hit the water competi
tively for the first time this sea
son at the Texas Invitational and
Imade their waves felt by every
Iswim team throughout the
Anchored by the superb perfor
mances of seniors Jenny Thomp
son and Eileen Richetelli, the Car
dinal issued a strong warning to
[all those who dare to challenge
'Stanford for the NCAA title this
lyear by outracing its opponents in
numerous events.
"We had an outstanding team
effort," said senior co-captain
Becky Crowe. "We were tired and
had been over-training, and we
really didn't expect to do this well
at this point of the season. I was
delighted that we proved our
selves wrong."
Held Thursday through Satur
day at the University of Texas at
Austin, the Invitational was not
scored like a regular dual or
championship meet. Only individ
ual and relay times were kept and
therefore there were no team
place-finishes.
But with seven out of the 10
attending teams ranked in the top
25, including No. 2 Texas, No. 3
USC and No. 9 Arizona, Stanford
did not want to look at this meet
as just another time trial. And
Thompson and Richetelli made

sure of that.
Thompson faired the best indi
vidually in Texas. A finalist for
the AAU Sullivan Award last year
(honoring the nation's top ama
teur athlete) and a holder of 13
NCAA titles and 19 All-American
honors, Thompson won the 50-
yard and 100-yard freestyles as
well as the 100-yard butterfly.
She also guided the 400- and 800-
yard free relay teams to first
place finishes.
"The fantastic thing about
Jenny Thompson is not only that
she is a great competitor, but she
competes every day in practice in

depth throughout our
lineup'

order to do well," said head coach
Richard Quick. "She is an
extremely hard worker who
brings a great spirit to the team.
[She] is also highly motivated
with extremely high goals."
Richetelli, a two-time NCAA
Diver of the Year and a four-time
NCAA champion, placed second
in the one-meter and platform
events and third in the three
meter. "I was very pleased with
Eileen's results," said head diving
coach Rick Schavone. "She was
leading most of her events for a

majority of the competition. She
just missed a little bit here and
there to not come away with the
victories."
Schavone was eager to see his
prize pupil perform again after
Richetelli sat out last year with a
back injury. Schavone said she
answered all questions as to
whether she had recovered from
her injury by hitting many of her
dives "better than she ever has
before."
"At a meet like this one [with
no team standings], everyone is
competing for themselves, basi
cally," Richetelli said. "With this
in mind, I was able to really focus
on my dives. It was helpful since I
often have dives with high
degrees of difficulty that are
sometimes hard to nail."
Schavone was also impressed
with Megan Gardner and Britt
Mattern, two sophomore divers
who came to the team as walk-ons
last year. Gardner placed seventh
in the one-meter and 12th in the
platform, while Mattern finished
fourth in the one-meter and 12th
in the three-meter.
"These girls, especially Megan,
have improved so much over last
year that it's really just amazing,"
Schavone said. "With a strong
back-up diver to Eileen, the team
should really be a force come
NCAAs. I'm very happy, in gener
al, because the whole team is div
