# Men swimmers run off with Speedo
## Cardinal captures second straight Speedo Grand Prix 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
Stanford aquatic teams love Long Beach's Bel
mont Plaza Olympic Pool. In the same pool that the
men's water polo team captured its second consecu
tive NCAA championship two weeks ago, the men's
swim team repeated last year's victory at the Speedo
Grand Prix this past weekend.
Showing depth and versatility, the Cardinal men
amassed 847 points to win the invitational. UC-
Santa Barbara finished second with a total of 378.
Stanford secured 11 of the 18 events in the meet,
including all five relays. Senior Brian Retterer led
the way for the Cardinal, beating the field in both
the 100- and 200-yard backstrokes.
While Retterer was unable to meet his pre-com
petition goal of qualifying for the NCAA champi
onships, he was pleased with the team effort.
"I had a couple of good swims and a couple disap
pointing ones," said Retterer. "I didn't do what I
wanted to do, but we've been training really hard, so
I didn't know how I'd be able to swim."
On the first day of competition, Stanford asserted
its dominance by winning four of five races. The
Cardinal opened the meet capturing the 200-yard
freestyle relay in a time of 1 minute, 22.54 seconds.
In the first individual race, junior Eric Diehl won
the 500 free in 4:30.63. Teammates Joe Hudepohl,
Scott Gagner and Casey Harmon finished second,
fifth and sixth respectively.
The 200-yard individual medley provided a

glimpse of the future for the Cardinal, as freshman
Tom Wilkens won the event in 1:50.11. Classmate
Sabir Muhammed finished fourth while Bryan
Addleman was sixth.
Stanford capped off the first night by winning the
400-yard medley relay in 3:17.22.
The second night featured more of the same, as
the Cardinal captured four of seven events. Once
again, a relay team got Stanford off and running as
the 200-yard medley relay placed first with a time of
1:28.88.
The 400 IM saw Wilkens post a time of 3:56.99,
good for second place, while sophomore Matt
Thompson was third.
In the 100 butterfly, Muhammed stroked to a
time of 48.63. Senior Clay Tippins finished third.
The biggest event of the night for the Cardinal
was the 200 free, in which Stanford placed four
swimmers in the six-man final. Hudepohl led the
squad, finishing second in 1:37.13. Scott Gagner,
Scott Jones and Scott Claypool touched third, fourth
and sixth respectively.
Senior Kurt Grote swam a 55.68 to finish second
in the 100-yard breaststroke. The time was an
unshaved, untapered lifetime best for Grote.
"We had a really good session Friday night,"
Grote said. "We got the ball rolling early on. It was
one of the best sessions I've ever seen — everyone
was feeding off other people's performances."
Stanford wrapped up the night with Retterer and
Muhammed finishing 1-2 in the 100-yard back-

stroke and the 800-yard freestyle
relay, claiming victory in 6:41.36.
On the final night of swim
ming, the Cardinal did not let up.
Sophomore Kevin Radvany, a
finalist in the 1650-yard freestyle
at last year's NCAAs, won the
fevent in a time of 15:20.45. In the
200-yard back, Retterer led
another 1-2 Stanford finish, as
Matt Martin touched second.
In the 100-yard free, Hudepohl
finished second to University of
the Pacific's Brad Shumacher,
who swept the 50-, 100- and 200-
yard frees.
The 200-yard breast stroke saw
Grote edged by Mark Anderson of
UCSB. Grote, the defending NCAA
champion in the event, was timed
at 2:01.72. In the final individual
race of the meet, Tippins touched
third in the 200-yard fly at 1:50.35.
Stanford wrapped up the week

end competition by easily out-dis
tancing the field in the 400-yard
free relay, finishing in 3:00.40.
"Everyone swam really well,"
Retterer said. "Everyone had at
least one good swim. It was a real
ly good meet."
Retterer, who has helped
secure three NCAA titles while at
Stanford, pointed out that the
1995 title is the goal of this squad.
"We're at the point in training
where we're pointing to NCAAs,"
he said. "That's the real focus of
this team. We are pointed and
dedicated to March [when nation
als will take place]."
The Cardinal is aware that the
competition will prove stiff, but
the team plans to peak at the right
time to bring home another
NCAA crown.
"There may not be the great
[in-season] swims like we've seen
in the past, but this team will save
up for the NCAAs," Retterer said.
"There was nothing brilliant this
weekend, but the brilliance has
been in workouts."
