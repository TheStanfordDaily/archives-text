# A 						bleak future for men's gymnastics
## Committee may wipe sport from slate of NCAA athletics 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
This year may provide the
Stanford men's gymnastics team
with its final shot at the NCAA
title. Finishing as the runner-up
last season, the Cardinal, like
every other team in the nation,
faces an uncertain future beyond
the upcoming season.
Due to a dangerous down
ward trend in the number of col
legiate men's gymnastics
squads, the sport could soon be
wiped off the slate of NCAA
sanctioned sports.
Of the 906 member schools in
the NCAA, only 31 field a men's
gymnastics team. Already, the
sport is operating under the
mandated 40 teams and com

petes this year only as the result
of a measure passed in 1993 pro
viding men's gymnastics with a
two-year moratorium from elim
ination.
Next January, delegates to
the NCAA will be called upon
yet again to provide shelter for
the sport. In the past, the sport's
popularity, coupled with the
absence of drug and academic
problems found in many other
sports, have compelled the dele
gates to keep gymnastics alive.
However, the legislative body,
comprised of a single representa
tive from each member school,
has already voted once to main
tain the 40-team minimum.
"The coaches and officials are
going to fight this action," said
Stanford head coach Sadao

Hamada. "One of the NCAA's
primary directives is to 'initiate,
stimulate, and improve' athlet
ics and we don't feel that cutting
men's gymnastics would reflect
this ideal."
At the meeting, Hamada,
along with several other head
coaches, will propose a bill seek
ing an extension on the morato
rium through the 1996-97 sea
son. The group seeks to provide
the NCAA with more time to
consider its decision.
The interest in next month's
meeting lies far beyond the sup
porters of men's gymnastics.
Sports such as water polo, which
includes 41 competing squads,
and wrestling also hold ominous
ly low numbers of participating
teams. The decision of the

NCAA meeting will likely set a
precedent for future measures
concerning such athletics.
The decision holds strong
implications on the future of the
U.S. Olympic team as well.
According to USA Gymnastics,
over 90 percent of all Olympic
gymnasts come out of collegiate
programs. The revocation of the
NCAA's 56-year sanction on the
sport would result in a loss of
funding for most of such existing
programs.
"It's unfair to impose an arbi
trary minimum number on us,"
Hamada said. "It would be
understandable if the sport was
below NCAA standards, but we
turn out quality competition
every year. Hopefully, we will be
able to continue doing so."
