# 'Tis the season for wasting big bucks
## 
### 
Have we forgotten the true
meaning of the holidays?
That goodwill toward others,
that peace on earth, that let's put
down our guns and not kill anyone
during these busiest shopping days
of the year agreement, that capacity
for love, that joy to the world feel
ing?
Yep, it's dead.
Mom, can I have that cool Gortex
ski jacket with the five removable
layers and thinsulate lining to go
with the new 0.5 pounds? Nike Air
Pegasus running shoes and the offi
cial Dodgers baseball jersey that you
forgot to get me last year?
Even at the risk of hearing that

old "money doesn't grow on trees,
blah blah, hard earned dollars, blah
blah, Stanford tuition hikes, blah
blah, spoiled rotten, blah blah" line
again, people everywhere are
responding to the media advertising
blitz.
All your favorite sports heroes
are out in full force peddling over
priced and over-stocked parapher
nalia. New Air Jordans are hitting
the market this holiday season with
His Majesty's career stats on the
rubber soles and a new Velcro play
thing holding the shoe together.
That is, of course, if you're not
already planning to blow hundreds
of dollars on the Shaquille O'Neal,
Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley
or David Robinson style basketball
shoes.
'Tis the season to be sporty. New
year's resolutions and a little extra
stuffing under those waist lines
serve as rationalizations for acquir
ing sports gear which will never be
used to its full extent.
Mom, can I get those new Reebok
cross-trainers in hot pink, those
excruciatingly-painful-looking

thong leotards everyone in the whole
world is wearing and a matching
membership to the health club?
Determination is inversely pro
portional to motivation, as wit
nessed by those who actually break
out the gold card and shell out the
Ben Franklins for the Soloflexes,
stationary bikes, treadmills and
Nordic Tracks — most of which will
serve as dust collectors (nouveau
cup holders) or garage sale items by
March, at the latest.
For the equally-ambitious but
insufficiently-funded college folk,
there are the traditional sporty
stocking stuffers on sale at Any-
Store, USA.
"Abs of Steel," "Buns of Steel,"
"Thighs of Steel," "Sweating to the
Oldies (and other Richard Simmons
atrocities — collect all eight!),"
"Cindy 'Don't-you-wish-you-had-a
body-like-me' Crawford Aerobics"
or the blue light special featuring
early '80's Jane Fonda workout
tapes for the low, low price of $9.99.
Thank you, mom. But more
importantly, thank you Thigh Ma
ster.
Exercise, or the potential for
exercise might justify breaking the
bank this holiday season, but what
about those $24.99 Sideout or Club
Sports T-shirts? Don't we all want to
look like Karch Kiraly with Speedo
stamped across our butts, Killer
Loop sunglasses gracing our visage
and a little pink hat to top off the
ensemble?
Or how about that Nancy Kerrig
an warm-up suit with matching
tiara and inflated ego? Planet
Reebok is just beyond the horizon
and there are no nasty little Jeff"
Giloolys with lead pipes waiting to
end your athletic careers there.
Mom, 1 want a "Free 0.J." T
shirt, Joe Montana sweat bands, the
Oakleys Jose Canseco wears, Sarah
Rafenelli's Reeboks and Steffi Grafs
scrunchy.
And this is just the tip of the ice
berg, the end of the beginning — I
have not yet began to write.
Tired of those obnoxious holiday
colors? Trying to coordinate that
gansta rapper look this season?
Amaze your friends and own every


Kathryn
Yang
piece of Raider silver-and-black on
the market.
For the East Coast gansta rap
per, invert the cap of your favorite
team, pull your shorts down to your
knees, throw an over-sized Char
lotte Hornets' basketball jersey on
over a white T-shirt and finish with
a New York Giants warm-up jacket.
Midwest gansta rappers, on the
other hand, might have to settle
with that classic Minnesota Timber
wolves look and Green Ray Packer
accessories.
Mom, I want black Adidas high
tops with no shoe laces, an Oakland
Raiders tattoo, No. 32 shaved into
the back of my head and size XXL
Knicks basketball shorts.
Looking to spread a little holiday
cheer, trying to avoid that rampant
materialism which defines our
meaningless existence, looking to
celebrate the spiritual rather than
the corporeal, refusing to blas
pheme alongside of your other last
minute Christmas Eve shoppers?
Good luck.

Canon color copies Bill Walsh

"Abs of Steel," "Buns of Steel,"
"Thighs of Steel," "Sweating to the
Oldies (and other Richard Simmons
atrocities — collect all eight!),"
"Cindy 'Don't-you-wish-you-had-a
body-like-me' Crawford Aerobics"
or the blue light special featuring
early '80's Jane Fonda workout
tapes for the low, low price of $9.99.
Thank you, mom. But more
importantly, thank you Thigh Ma
ster.
Exercise, or the potential for
exercise might justify breaking the
bank this holiday season, but what
about those $24.99 Sideout or Club
Sports T-shirts? Don't we all want to
look like Karch Kiraly with Speedo
stamped across our butts, Killer
Loop sunglasses gracing our visage
and a little pink hat to top off the
ensemble?
Or how about that Nancy Kerrig
an warm-up suit with matching
tiara and inflated ego? Planet
Reebok is just beyond the horizon
and there are no nasty little Jeff"
Giloolys with lead pipes waiting to
end your athletic careers there.
Mom, 1 want a "Free 0.J." T
shirt, Joe Montana sweat bands, the
Oakleys Jose Canseco wears, Sarah
Rafenelli's Reeboks and Steffi Grafs
scrunchy.
And this is just the tip of the ice
berg, the end of the beginning — I
have not yet began to write.
Tired of those obnoxious holiday
colors? Trying to coordinate that
gansta rapper look this season?
Amaze your friends and own every

piece of Raider silver-and-black on
the market.
For the East Coast gansta rap
per, invert the cap of your favorite
team, pull your shorts down to your
knees, throw an over-sized Char
lotte Hornets' basketball jersey on
over a white T-shirt and finish with
a New York Giants warm-up jacket.
Midwest gansta rappers, on the
other hand, might have to settle
with that classic Minnesota Timber
wolves look and Green Ray Packer
accessories.
Mom, I want black Adidas high
tops with no shoe laces, an Oakland
Raiders tattoo, No. 32 shaved into
the back of my head and size XXL
Knicks basketball shorts.
Looking to spread a little holiday
cheer, trying to avoid that rampant
materialism which defines our
meaningless existence, looking to
celebrate the spiritual rather than
the corporeal, refusing to blas
pheme alongside of your other last
minute Christmas Eve shoppers?
Good luck.

Kathryn wants one of those huge
Canon color copies Bill Walsh
advertises.
