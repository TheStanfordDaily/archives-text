# Thanks for all the memories

It's been the best of times
and the worst of times, to
use an appropriately Dick
ensian phrase in this time of
holiday cheer.
Fall quarter Cardinal ath
letics filled the sports pages
with highs and lows, wins and
losses and even a periodic res
ignation. We happily wit
nessed a water polo NCAA
championship, top-10 nation
al finishes by both men's and
women's cross country and a
phenomenal women's volley
ball season that continues to
impress.

We also suffered through a
first-round NCAA defeat of
the third-ranked women's
soccer team, a disappointing
football season culminated by
a 24-23 Big Game heartbreak
and a men's soccer team that
chose the football squad as a
role model.
Reporting losses is one of
the harder parts of our job,
along with learning how to
identify water polo athletes in
photos and sifting through
the mountains of faxes that
storm the office every day.
Learning the tactics of field
hockey proved another chal
lenge, as did grasping the dif
ference between a laser and a
dinghy (not to mention finally
learning how to spell
"sailor").
And then there's the col
umn quandary — the difficul
ty of finding something
worthwhile to write about

intelligently, knowing that
13,500 lucky individuals will
see our not-so-pretty mugs
every week. From Swinton
responses to pickup hoops,
from the Padres to superpow
ers, we tried our hardest.
But despite all of our
gripes, editing definitely does
have its moments. For fans
who insist on being involved
in athletics even if they can't
play, being a sports editor
brings fulfillment to a certain
degree. It's more than a job;
it's an adventure.
To close our stint for the
quarter, we offer Sam and
Allyson's Top Ten "Reasons
Why Being Sports Editor
Beats Having a Social Life"
List to you, our faithful read
ers.
10. You get all sorts of free
things — except for free time,
that is.
9. You get to shake Fred Sav
age's hand.
8. You find out how many
Stanford students it takes to
notice that there's a "5:00
p.m. deadline" sign in the
sports office. Twenty-six, and
still counting.
7. You learn how to fail grace
fully at organizing your life.
Well, forget gracefully.
6. You get to vote for the Heis
man trophy candidate of your
choice. Not.
5. You get to gaze at pictures
of water polo athletes.
(Applies to Allyson only.)
4. You eat dinner out of Tup
perware.
3. You live vicariously
through the athletes you
write about.
2. You learn what a "sloop" is.
1. You beat Cal. (Cal Daily:
19, Stanford Daily: 24)
Forty-nine issues later,
Allyson is still smiling and
Sam wants your life.
Happy holidays. #@x!*
