Due to a change in travel
plans and a broken-down van,
the Cardinal water polo team
traveled from the San Francis
co International Airport back
to Stanford campus in a U-
Haul truck in early September
following a tournament.
Head coach Dante Detta
manti admits that he made a
mistake in allowing his team to
be transported in the vehicle. "I
showed poor judgment, I'm
sure," he said. "It was a mis
take, and it's something I
wouldn't do again."
According to Dettamanti,

the U-Haul was provided by the
team's travel coordinator,
Sharon Lehane, who was using
it to move.
Gary Migdol, a spokesman
for the Athletic Department,
said that Dettamanti will not
be disciplined for the incident.
"It was a mistake in judgment
on his part," said Migdol. Det
tamanti has been head coach of
the water polo team for 18
years.
U-Hauls have no interior
lights, no seatbelts and no
indoor locks. According to
Janet Cooper, public relations
manager for U-Haul Interna
tional, the company's vehicles
post warnings against carrying
people or animals.
