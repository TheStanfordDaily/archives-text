# 'It's a warm feeling to have everything available to me.'
## Ex-prof's office is 'messiest'

When former Stanford professor
Clive Miller heard that "Home Of
fice Computing" magazine was
searching for the messiest home of
fice in America, he thought he had
the contest in the bag.
There was only one problem.
"I called the magazine and they
sent me a copy of the rules that ex
plained the contest," he said. "But of
course I put it in my office some
where and couldn't find it for a
while."
Eventually Miller found the con
test guidelines which required en
tering several photos and a 200-
word essay. The rest is history.

rent office in Claremont, Calif.
"My office was very organized
back then," Miller said. "I just
didn't have the time to accumu
late the things I have now. And I
wrote everything by hand — I
didn't have video tapes or cas
settes to pile up on my shelves."
Those who have daringly set
foot into Miller's current office
have described it as the inextrica
ble remains at the end of a
destructive wind tunnel.
The floor is hidden beneath
towering piles of old bank state
ments and manuscripts, leaving
little room for movement. Myriad
records, pamphlets and books
(with leaflets of paper stashed
between the pages) are strewn

over every inch of surface space.
"Miller has all kinds of equip
ment in addition to his computer
and printer, and even those are
never seen," said Albert Guerard,
Miller's former professor and
mentor at Harvard University.
"His problem is that he never
throws anything away — he val
ues every scrap of paper and arti
cle, thinking that they'll be useful
someday."
In the past, Miller hired sever
al secretaries to organize his
office. But all attempts at organi
zation failed.
He claims one woman entered
his office everyday and over
turned all the drawers, convinced
it was the only way to sort
through the material. Her true
motive, as Miller later discovered,
was to steal his valuables.
In another case, Miller discov
ered the woman he hired did not

scrap of paper and

"coherently understand the sec
ond half of the alphabet." She
unintentionally jumbled up all of
his corporate reports, investment
advisory letters and other impor
tant documents.
Even Miller's wife has had a
hand at trying to create some kind
of order in the midst of her hus
band's chaos.
"My wife Sophia periodically
tries to organize certain areas in

my office when I'm not around,"
Miller said. "But when I come back,
I never know where anything is, so
she usually tries to keep out of my
space, what little of it there Is."
Spending most of his earlier
years at boarding school and
sleep-away camps, Miller led an
independent life isolated from
many societal norms.
"I led a very lonely life when I
was younger, owning no toys and
very few personal possessions,"
he said. "That's part of why I let
things accumulate in my office.
It's a warm feeling to have every
thing available to me."
While at Harvard, Miller
encountered many other discover
ies, the most important being
women.
"When I got to college, I spot
ted these unfamiliar creatures
walking around Harvard Square,"
he said. "I approached one of

them and asked, 'What are you?'
She responded, 'A girl.' I spent
most of my time at school staring
at these creatures."
It just so happens that the
prize for Miller's messy office dis
tinction includes a woman. And
not just any woman, but a clutter
control expert who will spend four
days assisting him in organizing
his office. '
"I must admit that I feel a bit
of trepidation in this award,"
Miller confided. "I have no idea
how we're going to clear every
thing out. It will be nice to feel
comfortable in my office in an
area other than the tiny space
that's now accessible. I don't
want to spend the rest of my life
sorting through my mess."
In addition, Miller received a
compact computer and a Logitech
scanner to reduce paper work.
"My first reaction to this award

was a combination of elation and
shame," Miller admitted. "I think I
can relate to the Menendez broth
ers, especially with the fear of hav
ing to clean up after myself."
The shame, however, quickly
disappeared, because "there's no
such thing as bad press in Holly
wood."
Miller reveals that in the near
future his picture will be featured
on the cover of "Globe" magazine
adjacent to Princess Diana.
Though Miller's friends and
acquaintances may have grown
accustomed to his office, it cer
tainly is a shocking revelation for
the rest of America.
"The initial reaction of some
one entering my office for the first
time is usually amusement,"
Miller said. "Then the reaction
turns to one of repugnance. The
person usually doesn't talk to me
for the rest of the dav."

very few personal possessions,"
he said. "That's part of why I let
things accumulate in my office.
It's a warm feeling to have every
thing available to me."
While at Harvard, Miller
encountered many other discover
ies, the most important being
women.
"When I got to college, I spot
ted these unfamiliar creatures
walking around Harvard Square,"
he said. "I approached one of

them and asked, 'What are you?'
She responded, 'A girl.' I spent
most of my time at school staring
at these creatures."
It just so happens that the
prize for Miller's messy office dis
tinction includes a woman. And
not just any woman, but a clutter
control expert who will spend four
days assisting him in organizing
his office. '
"I must admit that I feel a bit
of trepidation in this award,"
Miller confided. "I have no idea
how we're going to clear every
thing out. It will be nice to feel
comfortable in my office in an
area other than the tiny space
that's now accessible. I don't
want to spend the rest of my life
sorting through my mess."
In addition, Miller received a
compact computer and a Logitech
scanner to reduce paper work.
"My first reaction to this award

was a combination of elation and
shame," Miller admitted. "I think I
can relate to the Menendez broth
ers, especially with the fear of hav
ing to clean up after myself."
The shame, however, quickly
disappeared, because "there's no
such thing as bad press in Holly
wood."
Miller reveals that in the near
future his picture will be featured
on the cover of "Globe" magazine
adjacent to Princess Diana.
Though Miller's friends and
acquaintances may have grown
accustomed to his office, it cer
tainly is a shocking revelation for
the rest of America.
"The initial reaction of some
one entering my office for the first
time is usually amusement,"
Miller said. "Then the reaction
turns to one of repugnance. The
person usually doesn't talk to me
for the rest of the dav."
When former Stanford professor
Clive Miller heard that "Home Of
fice Computing" magazine was
searching for the messiest home of
fice in America, he thought he had
the contest in the bag.
There was only one problem.
"I called the magazine and they
sent me a copy of the rules that ex
plained the contest," he said. "But of
course I put it in my office some
where and couldn't find it for a
while."
Eventually Miller found the con
test guidelines which required en
tering several photos and a 200-
word essay. The rest is history.

"My office was very organized
back then," Miller said. "I just
didn't have the time to accumu
late the things I have now. And I
wrote everything by hand — I
didn't have video tapes or cas
settes to pile up on my shelves."
Those who have daringly set
foot into Miller's current office
have described it as the inextrica
ble remains at the end of a
destructive wind tunnel.
The floor is hidden beneath
towering piles of old bank state
ments and manuscripts, leaving
little room for movement. Myriad
records, pamphlets and books
(with leaflets of paper stashed
between the pages) are strewn

over every inch of surface space.
"Miller has all kinds of equip
ment in addition to his computer
and printer, and even those are
never seen," said Albert Guerard,
Miller's former professor and
mentor at Harvard University.
"His problem is that he never
throws anything away — he val
ues every scrap of paper and arti
cle, thinking that they'll be useful
someday."
In the past, Miller hired sever
al secretaries to organize his
office. But all attempts at organi
zation failed.
He claims one woman entered
his office everyday and over
turned all the drawers, convinced
it was the only way to sort
through the material. Her true
motive, as Miller later discovered,
was to steal his valuables.
In another case, Miller discov

"coherently understand the sec
ond half of the alphabet." She
unintentionally jumbled up all of
his corporate reports, investment
advisory letters and other impor
tant documents.
Even Miller's wife has had a
hand at trying to create some kind
of order in the midst of her hus
band's chaos.
"My wife Sophia periodically
tries to organize certain areas in

my office when I'm not around,"
Miller said. "But when I come back,
I never know where anything is, so
she usually tries to keep out of my
space, what little of it there Is."
Spending most of his earlier
years at boarding school and
sleep-away camps, Miller led an
independent life isolated from
many societal norms.
"I led a very lonely life when I
was younger, owning no toys and
very few personal possessions,"
he said. "That's part of why I let
things accumulate in my office.
It's a warm feeling to have every
