# Riders take regional lead but lose horse
## 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
The emotions of the Stanford
equestrian team came full circle last
weekend. Just hours after the
English squad vaulted five spots to
first place overall in the region, the
squad learned that Cowboy, a top
horse in the program for three
years, had to be destroyed after suf
fering from intestinal colics.
"We had a very good and very
bad weekend, both," said senior
Quito Perlman, co-president of the
team. "We were extremely happy
until we got home."
Cowboy's death placed a cloud
over an otherwise sterling weekend
for the Cardinal, who return only
five performers from last year. With
solid finishes at both USC and Cal
Poly-Pomona, both the English and
Western squads remain solid con
tenders for the Zone 8, Region 1
title.
Saturday in Los Angeles, five
blue-ribbon and four red-ribbon fin
ishes guided Stanford to the high
point finish (first overall) among
English squads and third of 10
Western teams. The English team,
which had garnered only 33 points
combined in two previous competi
tions, managed 36 to hold off UC-
Davis by four points. With fewer
events, the Western team notched
18 points and finished third, six
points behind first-place Fresno
State and only two off the Broncos.
Freshman Amanda Hoche, one
of many talented Cardinal newcom
ers, stole the show, earning individ
ual high-point honors for the best

overall score of the day. Hoche
placed first in the open flat class and
third in open fences. Stanford also
dominated the walk-trot and walk
trot-canter classes, as freshmen
Katherine Williams and Victoria
Pettibone posted victories. Four
others earned red ribbons by plac
ing second in various classes. Even
coach Gwyn Gordon got in the act
by taking the alumni fence class.
The newer Western squad,
which was tied for second in the
region entering the day's action,
also kept pace with the leaders
behind Whitney Schott's victory in
the beginning stock seat class.
Though a sophomore, Schott was
not with the team last year, adding
to the stockpile of blue ribbons for
Stanford rookies.
Although the Western group did
not perform as well as their English
counterparts, Perlman pointed out
the relative newness of the Western
program.
"We had limited Western inter
est in the past, but it became bigger
this year," Perlman said. "A bunch
of people really wanted to do it, so
we found a coach [Karine Bau
douin], and we took five people with
us." In all, 18 of the 27 members of
the Cardinal squad made the trip
down south.
The same 10 schools squared off
the next day in Pomona, with simi
lar results. This time, both Stanford
teams earned the reserve high
point, or placed second, to further
establish themselves as a force in
the region.
With 26 points, the Cardinal fell
four points shy of champion UC-

Davis for the English crown. The
Bulldogs, which had led the region
before the weekend, finished third
with 23 points.
Once again, Hoche dominated
her trademark events, earning indi
vidual high-point honors for the
second consecutive day. She
improved one place from Saturday
to finish second in open fences, and
captured the open flat class. Junior
Emily Jones matched Hoche's per
formance by rebounding from
fourth-place finishes the day
before. She triumphed in the novice

fences and was runner-up in the
intermediate flat to freshman
teammate Julie Baker, who also
placed second in intermediate
fences.
Freshman Jill Meyers and Gor
don rounded out the blue ribbons
for the Cardinal English squad.
Meyers specializes in the walk-trot,
and Gordon breezed to a win in the
alumni fences category.
