# A
						look at the IM football championships
## 
### John Fabian 
Sunday afternoon on the frigid,
muddy tundra known as the intra
mural athletic fields, the intramu
ral football season reached a con
clusion with its championship
games.
Upon their arrival, the teams
noticed a flurry of activity among
the referees.
"The refs were scrambling
around trying to figure out the
lines [on the field]," said the head
official. "They've been relined for
rugby."
Only in IM football. However
disorganized the scene appeared,
the organization of the IM football
league is improving and the cham
pionships were exciting. Plus,
everyone had a lot of fun — which
is what it's all about.
This year, hundreds of Stanford
undergrads, graduate students
and even the Palo Alto fire station
fielded intramural football teams.
Some came to compete seriously,
others to vent academic frustra
tion, some just to get together with
friends — but all intended to have
fun. players got to reclaim past glo
ries from younger days, others to
create glories that never were.
Everyone got to relax a little.
Some participants went a little

overboard in this relaxation. In one
game, with his squad winning by a
large margin, MBA-2 team mem
ber Chris Dowling played defen
sive back while eating an apple. He
dropped back, covered the receiver
and made a one-handed intercep
tion with the apple still in hand;
after running it back a long dis
tance, he pitched to a teammate
who ran it in for a touchdown.
Only in IM football. It just goes to
show that you can't get too serious.
The first championship game
was in the coed division, pitting the
Merry Pranksters against MBA-2.
The Pranksters are a group of pre
sent and former Whitman House
students, mostly seniors, while the
MBA-2 team is composed of sec
ond-year MBA students. Both
teams came in with perfect
records, having won all five of their
regular season contests and their
two previous playoffs games. Their
history made it even more interest
ing — the Pranksters got whipped
38-0 by an MBA-2 team last year,
so they were looking for revenge.
And revenge they got.
The weather conditions were
not complementary to the athleti
cism of the MBA-2 team, which
had two former college basketball
players, one hockey player and a
football player. The cold and wet

conditions were conducive to a
more organized attack, which the
Pranksters offered. The game
went down to the wire, but the
Pranksters prevailed 13-12 after
they held the MBA-2 team on
downs in the final minute.
Pablo Garcia, the Pranksters'
captain, said, "Coed's a lot differ
ent because you get women
involved. At first they're sort of
timid, but then they get really
excited about it. It was exciting to
get a lot of people together who
weren't necessarily ringers and
compete and win."
In the second game, the MBA-2
men turned around to compete
again, this time against Rains, a
group of mostly engineering and
business Ph.D. students. Again the
MBA-2 team was more athletic,
featuring several college athletes,
including former Hobie Baker
Award (college's outstanding hock
ey player) winner Lane Mac Do
nald. But for a second time, the
more organized of the two pre
vailed, as the Rains team, led by
"IM legend" John Middlekauff,
rolled to a 26-0 victory.
The final play of the game epit
omized the day for the MBA stu
dents. Jim Bloom, the MBA-2 cap
tain, decided to stir up a little fun,
and came off the sidelines to try to

make an interception. However he
only managed to tip the ball, which
bounced off the intended receiver's
forehead and into the arms of
another Rains receiver who
streaked by for the final touch
down. Even with an extra player,
things just didn't go right for
MBA-2.
"This signifies the decline of the
MBA empire. The last three years
Rains has shut them down. The
Ph.D.s proved brains over brawn,"
MiddlekaufT said. The MBAs had
previously dominated IM football,
but MiddlekaufT and his mates
have put a stop to that.
Of IM football and its evolution
since he's been here, MiddlekaufT
said, "It's a well-run organization.
The rules have evolved so that
there's enough contact that it still
resembles football, but is under
control. The referees have done a
good job. It's a lot of fun."
MBA-2 captain Bloom added,
"We're just out there to have fun
and show some good school spir
it. We just sort of threw the team
together this year. It was the
first loss for both of our teams,
so we were successful. It's a
good, healthy, competitive way
to get out and have fun with
friends of all ages and sizes on
campus."
