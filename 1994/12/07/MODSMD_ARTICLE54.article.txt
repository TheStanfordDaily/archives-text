# The 						consummate performer,

### 
Ice-T is the consummate performer.
While most of us are familiar with his
rap career, and many have caught him
in movies like "New Jack City" and "Tres
pass," only a few are aware his public
speaking prowess. Far more skilled than
any debate-club crony, Ice-T has straight
housed the science of public speaking,
combining it with the authority, the flare
and the sheer outlandishness of the rapper
that he is. He knows exactly how to work a
crowd, any crowd, how to tap into its vibe
and ride it.
Two years ago, amid controversies over
his "Cop Killer" album and raging First
Amendment debates that seemed to have
rap music as their target, the ASSU invited
Ice to campus to drop the science from a
hip-hop perspective.
But quicker than you could say "Ice-T,"
The Daily ran an editorial denouncing his

visit, saying that Stanford
students deserved to hear
someone more learned,
more articulate, more ...
well, more qualified to talk
about the issues than a rap
per. And they suggested
Tipper Gore.
But as Ice so poetically
put it when he got here,
"Who the hell is Tipper
Gore?"
For those of us who saw
him speak at Kresge, these
concerns were completely
unfounded. Ice's repertoire

expanded well beyond rap music and the
perils of the music industry to encompass
virtually every question that our well edu
cated minds could throw at him.

party seems to be "As Grungy As U Wanna
Be." Bay Area journalists turn up the
drabbest, most beat-up clothing in their
wardrobes. Ahh, the City-aesthetic. Unmis
takable.
I walk in as Ice is warming up on a guy who
figures his life story is just as important to us
as the performers we've all come to see.
"I grew up in Oakland," the man says,"and
a lot of my friends were black. I listened to
heavy metal and they were listening to a whole
different style. Now, I've got quite a few black
friends that play fuckin ... guitar like Jimi
Hendrix and shit y'know. Here I am listenin to
rap, and here they are, nothin but heavy metal."
What the hell?
Ice-T responds to him anyway.
The crowd has gotten going and is now
laughing like this is a stand up act.
"I love the aggression," states Ice, direct
about why he's into metal. "The real reason I
wanted to do it... I used to go to Europe and
do rap and watch motherfuckas mosh off of
Colors. So then we'd just speed the record up,
we'd play Public Enemy and they would
stage-dive. And I said 'I'LL BE BACK.' So I get
off on the impact on the fans. I'm a mosh-pit
fiend. This sit down shit is wacL I want to see
motherfuckas bleed really, that's my shit."
The crowd erupts into laughter and
cheers. He's good. Oh yes, he's really good.
"Another thing is guys," he continues,
"there's gonna be a whole lot more Speed
Metal bands comin' out of the hood. And I
know 10 of them. I always get up on stage and
tell people, so you wonder how these people
got it? We had the riots, and robbed all the

music
stores, and
we all
learned how
to play gui
tars in a year
and it's goin'
down."
Th e
crowd starts
leaning to
wards the
floor.
"Basical
ly, I think
there's been

a lot of closet heavy-metal black kids," says
Ice. This time he's not kidding. "They've
been wantin' to get off but they never really
had it, you know, they never really had that

You took my past/1
want your future/ you
took my parents/ we
want your children/
Masters of revenge/
masters of payback/in
citers of chaos/ mes
sengers of rage!
In another song,
Ice-T shouts:
Little white kid
with a Kool-Aid smile/
trainin' wheels on his
bike but he called me a
nigger/ pushed the lit
tle bastard into traffic
it was graphic/ he was
holdin his bike tight/
he was a victim of
fucked up explainin'
an American example
of fucked up trainin/
when the fuckin bus
connected he flew like
Knevil/ It was just nec
essary evil!
White kids mosh
to this? If these jour
nalists have already
listened to the lyrics,
they sure don't let on.
Instead, another
bright one steps up to
bat. He gives his ac
tivist credentials —
he works with San
Francisco Liberation
Radio — before pro
ceeding with the
question.
"In the 19605," the
reporter begins, "the
Black Panther Party
armed themselves,
not for offensive pur
poses as the white,
corporate-owned
media at the time
tried to paint the pic
ture but for — if you
read Huey Newton's

autobiography — certainly for purposes of
self-defense. Now we're seeing so many inci
dences today, like the beating of Rodney
King, which a lot of people would agree, was
not an isolated incident, but happens every
day, are we in an era now where people in

poor and minority
communities
should start to think
about arming them
selves for self-de
fense?"

that are being deported, that are
going to jail for the rest of their lives
for stealing a fuckin' beer from 7-11?
Straight from the heart, these Bay
Area types. But Ice actually thrives
on this type of barrage. Pow! Pow!
Pow! He picks them off one by one.
"If you look at the situation that
they're trying to push us into with
the New World Order, then you need
to just read your constitution cor
rectly. The right to bear arms just
means that it's your last defense
against tyranny. It's not to hunt"
Of course, this statement is met by
clapping and loud hoots. The crowd
is just so down.
"So when they tell you, 'well, an

automatic weapon you can't use that
to kill deer...' A deer isn't a tyrant.
We need an automatic weapon to kill
police!"
Ahh ... hmm ... well? Don't
know quite what to do with that one.
But Ice doesn't flinch. "They're
movin' in Gestapo movements all
through Los Angeles," he says blunt
ly. "You got the proposition 187,
that's some Gestapo shit. Just come
in here, pull people's cards, throw
em back... what the fuck?"
On voting; "I think if God had
wanted us to vote he would have

given us candidates. Picking the lesser of two
evils is bullshit It's like asking, do you want me
to stab you or shoot you? Or I got a bat over
here, running independent."
On the link between his music and direct
action he explained: "My main objective with
my music is not to totally educate people
about every fuckin' problem that's goin on.
My main objective is to try to get the sides
straight"
On changing the laws: "By the time all these
laws trickle down to me and the reality I live
on, it's basically, 'you're black, go to jail.' Fuck
all the laws. You're black, go to jail, that's the
law. You're white, you're poor, go to jail. Peri
od. They're never gonna change that law."
"You gotta change it man!" yells a white
woman from the audience.
"Naw, you gotta change it!" Ice counters.
"We gotta change it." ■

any debate-club crony, Ice-T has straight
housed the science of public speaking,
combining it with the authority, the flare
and the sheer outlandishness of the rapper
that he is. He knows exactly how to work a
crowd, any crowd, how to tap into its vibe
and ride it.
Two years ago, amid controversies over
his "Cop Killer" album and raging First
Amendment debates that seemed to have
rap music as their target, the ASSU invited
Ice to campus to drop the science from a
hip-hop perspective.
But quicker than you could say "Ice-T,"
The Daily ran an editorial denouncing his

visit, saying that Stanford
students deserved to hear
someone more learned,
more articulate, more ...
well, more qualified to talk
about the issues than a rap
per. And they suggested
Tipper Gore.
But as Ice so poetically
put it when he got here,
"Who the hell is Tipper
Gore?"
For those of us who saw
him speak at Kresge, these
concerns were completely
unfounded. Ice's repertoire

expanded well beyond rap music and the
perils of the music industry to encompass
virtually every question that our well edu
cated minds could throw at him.

party seems to be "As Grungy As U Wanna
Be." Bay Area journalists turn up the
drabbest, most beat-up clothing in their
wardrobes. Ahh, the City-aesthetic. Unmis
takable.
I walk in as Ice is warming up on a guy who
figures his life story is just as important to us
as the performers we've all come to see.
"I grew up in Oakland," the man says,"and
a lot of my friends were black. I listened to
heavy metal and they were listening to a whole
different style. Now, I've got quite a few black
friends that play fuckin ... guitar like Jimi
Hendrix and shit y'know. Here I am listenin to
rap, and here they are, nothin but heavy metal."
What the hell?
Ice-T responds to him anyway.
The crowd has gotten going and is now
laughing like this is a stand up act.
"I love the aggression," states Ice, direct
about why he's into metal. "The real reason I
wanted to do it... I used to go to Europe and
do rap and watch motherfuckas mosh off of
Colors. So then we'd just speed the record up,
we'd play Public Enemy and they would
stage-dive. And I said 'I'LL BE BACK.' So I get
off on the impact on the fans. I'm a mosh-pit
fiend. This sit down shit is wacL I want to see
motherfuckas bleed really, that's my shit."
The crowd erupts into laughter and
cheers. He's good. Oh yes, he's really good.
"Another thing is guys," he continues,
"there's gonna be a whole lot more Speed
Metal bands comin' out of the hood. And I
know 10 of them. I always get up on stage and
tell people, so you wonder how these people
got it? We had the riots, and robbed all the

music
stores, and
we all
learned how
to play gui
tars in a year
and it's goin'
down."
Th e
crowd starts
leaning to
wards the
floor.
"Basical
ly, I think
there's been

a lot of closet heavy-metal black kids," says
Ice. This time he's not kidding. "They've
been wantin' to get off but they never really
had it, you know, they never really had that

You took my past/1
want your future/ you
took my parents/ we
want your children/
Masters of revenge/
masters of payback/in
citers of chaos/ mes
sengers of rage!
In another song,
Ice-T shouts:
Little white kid
with a Kool-Aid smile/
trainin' wheels on his
bike but he called me a
nigger/ pushed the lit
tle bastard into traffic
it was graphic/ he was
holdin his bike tight/
he was a victim of
fucked up explainin'
an American example
of fucked up trainin/
when the fuckin bus
connected he flew like
Knevil/ It was just nec
essary evil!
White kids mosh
to this? If these jour
nalists have already
listened to the lyrics,
they sure don't let on.
Instead, another
bright one steps up to
bat. He gives his ac
tivist credentials —
he works with San
Francisco Liberation
Radio — before pro
ceeding with the
question.
"In the 19605," the
reporter begins, "the
Black Panther Party
armed themselves,
not for offensive pur
poses as the white,
corporate-owned
media at the time
tried to paint the pic
ture but for — if you
read Huey Newton's

autobiography — certainly for purposes of
self-defense. Now we're seeing so many inci
dences today, like the beating of Rodney
King, which a lot of people would agree, was
not an isolated incident, but happens every
day, are we in an era now where people in

poor and minority
communities
should start to think
about arming them
selves for self-de
fense?"

that are being deported, that are
going to jail for the rest of their lives
for stealing a fuckin' beer from 7-11?
Straight from the heart, these Bay
Area types. But Ice actually thrives
on this type of barrage. Pow! Pow!
Pow! He picks them off one by one.
"If you look at the situation that
they're trying to push us into with
the New World Order, then you need
to just read your constitution cor
rectly. The right to bear arms just
means that it's your last defense
against tyranny. It's not to hunt"
Of course, this statement is met by
clapping and loud hoots. The crowd
is just so down.
"So when they tell you, 'well, an

automatic weapon you can't use that
to kill deer...' A deer isn't a tyrant.
We need an automatic weapon to kill
police!"
Ahh ... hmm ... well? Don't
know quite what to do with that one.
But Ice doesn't flinch. "They're
movin' in Gestapo movements all
through Los Angeles," he says blunt
ly. "You got the proposition 187,
that's some Gestapo shit. Just come
in here, pull people's cards, throw
em back... what the fuck?"
On voting; "I think if God had
wanted us to vote he would have

given us candidates. Picking the lesser of two
evils is bullshit It's like asking, do you want me
to stab you or shoot you? Or I got a bat over
here, running independent."
On the link between his music and direct
action he explained: "My main objective with
my music is not to totally educate people
about every fuckin' problem that's goin on.
My main objective is to try to get the sides
straight"
On changing the laws: "By the time all these
laws trickle down to me and the reality I live
on, it's basically, 'you're black, go to jail.' Fuck
all the laws. You're black, go to jail, that's the
law. You're white, you're poor, go to jail. Peri
od. They're never gonna change that law."
"You gotta change it man!" yells a white
woman from the audience.
"Naw, you gotta change it!" Ice counters.
"We gotta change it." ■
