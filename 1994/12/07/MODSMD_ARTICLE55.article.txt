# works the crowd at Slim's
## 
### 
The script read no differently last Tues
day night at Slim's nightclub in San
Francisco. Ice-T and two members of
Body Count, his new speed-metal band, held
an hour-long conference-style interview to
promote the band and their latest album,
"Born Dead."
Picture it: Ice-T sitting on stage flanked by
two darkly-clad brothers from the band. Ice-
T, however, wears a white track outfit. The
band's instruments form the scenic back
ground. Before them are at least 60 journal
ists from the area. Peons. The theme of this

initiative. Maybe they see someone like
'Spade Ghetto' get on stage and they say fuck
dat! I'm comin out."
It's becoming clear that Ice-T and Body
Count are on a mission to spread the
word about black metal bands. I begin to
wonder how many in this crowd of predomi
nantly white reporters have actually listened
to the lyrics of Body Count's music.
In one song off their latest album, "Born
Dead," called "Masters of Revenge," the lyrics
are as follows:

Whew! I thought. But that was only the
beginning of the revolution-oriented ques
tions.
Did you vote? How do you feel about
direct action, mass organizing, is it
time for a revolution? What's your
message for the people out of the ghettos
