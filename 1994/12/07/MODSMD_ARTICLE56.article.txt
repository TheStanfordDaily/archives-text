The Phoenix Hotel, centered amidst San
Francisco's gray and white colonnaded
governmental buildings, seems strange
ly incongruous. Its outside walls are covered
with swirly rainbow-esque murals and quotes
such as "music heals"; the hotel's interior is
pink, adorned with many large leafy plants. Its
courtyard features an imitation Hockney pool:
large blue arcs dancing under light blue water.
On this sunny, late-fall day, the courtyard
also briefly contained Cranes. Not the large el
egant birds, mind you, but two members of the
ethereal-sounding band which started in a
small English town (Portsmouth) in the late
1980s, and have since toured all over the world
(including a time with The Cure), and just re
leased their third album, "Loved." The Cranes'
name is derived from the large industrial
cranes filling the dock yards of their home
town, as well as the long-legged bird.
Cranes' main members are James and Alli
son Shaw, siblings separated by two years. Vi
sual appearances would not clearly indicate
the familial connection of the two Cranes.
James, in a long-sleeved black shirt under
neath a short-sleeved green one, has dyed
black hair and curious blue eyes — he seemed
to regard his surroundings with detached
amusement, smirking to himself while he
sipped his beer. To his right sat Allison — with
a large woolly sweater, pigtails piled on the top
of her head and brown eyes, her demeanor
was anything but threatening. However,
watching James and Allison alternate answer
ing questions, banter, joke and occasionally
interrupt each other, their shared lineage be
came clear.
The tone of the interview was reflected
quite well in the Cranes' perceptions of them
f elves. "People do expect us to be gloomy, but
I kind of think we're quite funny sometimes,"
spouted James. "Its not like we're not serious
about what we're doing..."
"... Actually, we're quite serious about
music," countinued Allison.
"Its not like we try to be nice people, we're
just normal people," finished James.
James' and Allison's rapport as brother and
sister could be considered an allegory for the
Cranes' musical style. When first listening to
Cranes, the contrast between the often-dark
music (written by James) and Allison's child
like, innocent voice, which she describes as "a
strength that can come from fragility," is as
tonishing.
Further immersion into Cranes' music
yields different results. The voice becomes an
instrument in itself, adding a softness to the
melody, the music and words seem to finally
merge into one. As Allison said, "We [James
and Allison] have been working together for a
long, long time."
Cranes consider their musical influences as
"everything since we could first perceive
sound," to "people who mean what they are
doing," (such as Cop Shoot Cop, live), to
Young Gods, Jim Fairwell, Nick Cave, Belly,
Frank Sinatra and classical music.

Lately, Cranes have been expanding on
their established style. "Things are leaning to
wards a brighter atmosphere, more colorful
songs, more enthusiasm," said Allison. "It [the
new album, 'Loved'] felt like quite the sense of
movement. On the one hand, the songs for
'Loved' were in that vein, although when it
comes down to it, they're still quite melan
choly."
"Loved" was recorded without much for
mal preparation. "It often happens that when
we've been touring nine months or 12 months,
you build up things that you want to try out,"

Allison said. "By the time we started, I wasn't
really that enthusiastic because we didn't have
any demos or anything, but Jim really was.
"But once we got into the studio, we got
into a mode. The first things we tried, I didn't
really like and I thought, 'We shouldn't really
be here at the moment,' " Allison said. "But
then you hit on something that feels really dif
ferent, you just find something that interests
you and sparks your ideas off and you get to
tally into it"
"When we first got in there, we couldn't
think of anything to sing about. But it kind of
just pushed itself along after a while," James
confirmed.
Loved" was entirely produced by Cranes.
"We use production as a recording tool.
I always think you shouldn't have a
proper producer who will change the songs. If
a band can produce themselves then they
should because you get more of the band,"
James said.
"I wasn't looking for some sort of theme for
the album, but some sort of feeling or emo
tion," James said. "When I'm thinking of
music, its usually because of something that
happened to me or something I've seen,
whether it be good or bad, which has influ
enced me. Once you hone in on that for a cou

pie of songs for an album, once you've got that,
it generates a sound."
"Loved" is Cranes' third album, a fact re
flected both in their musical and person lives.
"You gradually change over a period of time,"
Allison said. "We feel that we've been very
lucky over the past couple of years, and that in
fluences the music. If you compare what our
general life is now to four or five years ago,
we're here ... isn't it wonderful that we're in
San Francisco. We've been able to travel in Eu
rope."
James' outlook wasn't quite so optimistic:

"People would come up to us in England the
year after our first album. We were being writ
ten about quite a lot. Its kind of sinking in now
that we're not being written about quite so
much, or rather its more drawn out, the atti
tude towards us has changed."
A diatribe about the dangers of journalists
and journalism followed, ending with a brief,
"Sorry."
Many critics of "Loved" accuse Cranes of
"selling out," because of its lighter, brighter
tone. According to James, Cranes wouldn't
mind moving more into the mainstream, both
to find a wider audience and for "financial in
centives."
However, there was no intent of changing
audiences when making the album, "We never
intentionally have a purpose when we start
something. We always do it back to front; we
start something and see how it goes. We don't
get and idea and then try to follow it through.
We dive in," Allison said.
"Its not like we couldn't write songs to
order," James said, "but we don't feel true
about it if we do. We have a lot more musical
intelligence (without being pigheaded) if we
ever wanted to sell out, we could, but we
wouldn't do it by doing 'Loved.' "
Cranes did, however, spend seven months
touring as the opening band for The Cure.

James described the experience of being re
cruited: "There was one night when he [ Robert
Smith], just walked into the dressing room and
said something along the lines of 'Are you
doing Europe with us, or what then?' I actual
ly said, 'No,' because I had to wash my hair or
something. He didn't get the joke immediate
ly."
"We thought, 'Life will never be the
same,'" said Allison.
Cranes described touring as a monumental
experience. "We met quite a lot of people on
that tour for the first time. It probably would
have taken us years to play in those towns by
ourselves," said Allison.
James said The Cure is exemplary of a band
maintaining a human attitude after attaining
fame.
"We hate people who think they're some
thing special just because they're in a band, be
cause they're not. If they think they are because
they are in a band, then to my mind, that
makes them a complete dickhead.
"Conclusive evidence [that a band doesn't
have to adopt that attitude] is The Cure, be
cause they are as normal as they could possi
bly be. They are down-to-earth people and
nice and I think that has a lot to do with why
we got on with them. We still sort of keep in
touch."
In the course of making "Loved," James
also started writing music that was much
more "orchestral." James and Allison took
three weeks off to concentrate on this new
music because they felt its style did not fit that
of the album.
"It was intense and weird, with a clarinet on
it and some strange other instuments," Allison
said. "I didn't know what to do with it vocally,
because it didn't seem like a thing I would sing
in the normal way.
"I just remembered this play I had read
when I was learning French, which was 'The
Flies,' by Jean-Paul Sartre. I spoke over the
music with this fine from the piece over and
over, and it just seemed to fit the music."
Eventually, the whole play was adapted to
eight pieces of music; "Probably the best thing
we've ever done, even though its kind of a side
thing," James said.
Unfortunately, "It doesn't fall into any par
ticular format, such as a dance format, a play
format, or a film format, we really don't know
what to do with it. Certainly, we couldn't play
it live," James said.
It may, however, be turned into a ballet, as
it naturally lends itself to dramatic interpreta
tion (the play is based on a Greek tragedy).
The Sartre Estate has given permission to per
form the piece.
Recently, Cranes finished working on a
soundtrack for a student film based on a
Tenessee Williams play, and are presently
touring the United States.
With the start of the new year, as San Fran
cisco gradually becomes ensconced with fog
and coid, expect to encounter Cranes again. ■
