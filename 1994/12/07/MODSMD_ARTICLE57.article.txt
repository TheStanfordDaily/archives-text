# BEYOND 'FUCK ARMAGEDDON'
## GUITARIST BRIAN BAKER JOINS PUNK LEGEND BAD RELIGION IN ITS MATURITY 
### 
Less than five months ago, Brian Baker
was a Bad Religion fan working at a re
hearsal studio, setting up microphone
stands for $6.50 an hour. Today he's in the
middle of an extensive and very successful
world tour as Bad Religion's new guitarist.
For the last 14 years. Baker has seen Los An
geles' Bad Religion — GregGraffin, Brett "Mr.
Brett" (iurewitz, lay Bentley, (ireg Hetson and
Bobby Schayer — evolve into one of the most
influential punk bands in the world, develop
ing the hardcore-pop sound that would rede
fine popular radio and lead punk music out
from the underground.
Early this September, just as the band
reached the height of its popularity with the
release of their eighth album "Stranger Than
Fiction," original Bad Religion guitarist and
songwriter Brett (iurewitz decided to quit the
group to concentrate on running the Kpitaph
record label, leaving Bad Religion without a
guitarist just weeks before their scheduled
tour.
Brian Baker, who had known members of
the band for several years, was then asked to
step in and fill the hole left by Gurewitz's de
parture. Baker accepted the offer and had just
a few weeks to learn how to play 112 Bad Reli
gion songs. Now, three months into the tour,
the band is razor-sharp and better than ever,
he says.
On tour, Baker replaces Gurewitz's guitar
work and backing vocals; but after the tour, he
will begin taking over Gurewitz's songwriting
as well, ( iurewitz shared the band's songwrit
ing duties with lead singer Graffin, and was
the writer responsible for such hits as
"Stranger Than Fiction," "Infected" and "21st
Gentury (Digital Boy)."
"I don't have a fucking clue as to what I'm
going to do, to be quite honest," says Baker
about taking Gurewitz's place. " The only
thing 1 know I'm going to do is not try to write
like Brett or (ireg. It would be very easy for me
to go and write a bunch of stuff that sounds
like it should be on a Bad Religion record, but
1 don't really think that's the angle I'd like to
take."
Brian Baker is a new addition to Bad Re
ligion, but he is no stranger to the punk
music scene. Originally learning "the
gymnastic of playing the guitar" from watch
ing the Damned, Baker has played in Minor
Threat, Dag Nasty, the Meatmen, Bash & Pop,
(iovernment Issue and others. A longtime cre
ator and fan of punk music, Baker describes
punk as "simply what I've been doing for my
entire life."
"It represents independent thought and
definitely a search for one's own mores and at
titudes rather than simply following dogma of
any kind," he says. "That runs all the way from
spray-painting 'Circle Jerks' on a brick wall to
wearing a strange-colored tie at the office."
Bad Religion has been instrumental in
bringing this punk spirit to wider audiences,
mixing rawness and intensity with accessible
hooks and melody, setting the stage for the
hueelv popular punk-pop acts like Green Dav

and the Offspring that have dominated altei
native radio for much of the last year.
"I just think the widespread success of
those bands has made it a little easier for peo
ple to investigate this kind of music without
being harassed by their friends and family,"
Baker says.
"When I was in Minor Threat 14 years ago,
punk music was completely inaccessible, it
was dangerous, and it was not something that
people would do in order to be popular," he
continues. "It was what people who were un
popular did because they had no choice. Punk
music now is a commodity that is heavily ad
vertised and available to anyone in any strip
mall anywhere in the country."
But this isn't a bad thine, Baker maintains.

As the punk scene has developed, Bad
Religion has done the same, slowly ma
turing into one of the world's most in
telligently vital punk bands. "Early Bad Reli
gion wasn't really concerned about musician
ship," he says."It was much more about the
outpouring of energy in any way possible."
"'Fuck Armageddon This Is Hell' is a state
ment that is certainly valid, but it's presented

in a much more schoolboy way because it was
written by someone who was 16 years old,"
Baker says, describing early Bad Religion
songwriting.
"1 think the songwriting has grown up, but
it still retains a lot of the qualities that made
me a Bad Religion fan back in the early days.
As you grow older you have the advantage of
basically honing your craft and being able to
make succinct statements in ways that are a lit
tle more clever, maybe a little more delicate."
Bad Religion has certainly matured, but
they're far from delicate. Their latest album
delivers 15 straight-ahead assaults of roaring
insight, throwing layers of surging, pounding
guitar on top of Bobby Schayer's furious
drumming. Only one of the songs ventures
past the three-minute mark — Bad Religion
specializes in the short and urgent.
The band's lyrics are equally intense. Baker
avoids calling Bad Religion a political band,
but he recognizes the group's tendency to
focus on various personal aijd social issues,
ranging from the war in Bosnia to the influ
ence of the mass media.
"The intent is to promote awareness of nu
merous topics which seem to get skated over
in the normal rock and roll let's-get-a-beer
and-get-some-women type of music that
most people are inundated with," he says."It
definitely occupies its own little niche, which
is why its been going so well for so many
years."
Bad Religion has maintained its brutally
intellectual momentum for nearly a
decade and a half, and during that time,
three of the band members have started fami
lies, and lead singer Greg Graffin will soon re
ceive his Ph.D. in biology from Cornell.
"He's taking a break oft of school for this
touring cycle," Baker says ol (iraffin's academ
ic pursuits, "But once we're done with the
tour, he'll be right back to the computer. And
he has one with him on the tour, so who
knows what he's doing in his hotel room after
shows?"
But none of this has gotten in the way of the
band's ability to create stunning bursts of en
ergy that both draw you in and knock you
down. It is this energy that has kept Bad Reli
gion sounding fresh and invigorated for so
long, and it's this energy that has opened the
door for a new wave of melodic punkers that
have come to dominate MTV's "Buzz Bin.
And with new creative input from punk
rock veteran Brian Baker, Bad Religion seems
ready to put a new spin on their usual rage,
and thrive in the genre that they spent their
last 14 years working to invent. ■

"I would vastly prefer a nation of people lis
tening to (ireen 1 )ay than listening to the Scor
pions," he says. "It's an excellent development,
but it's important to recognize that there are
some major differences between that and the
formative years, especially for American
punk."
