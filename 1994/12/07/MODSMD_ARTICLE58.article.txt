## Local punkers discuss major labels, the dangers of (Green Day's) success 
### Phil Leckman 
You all probably already know that in the
wake of Green Days phenomenal suc
cess, the major labels have pegged the
Bay Area as the "next Seattle" and sent in their
legions of A&R reps, inciting a (lurry of con
tract-signing and bidding wars, spurring previ
ously unknown bands into the limelight with
seven-figure record deals.
While Samiam hasn't caunht unite the buzz

that Green I )ay did, they were one of the
first "punk" bands from the SF area to go
the major-label route, with "Clumsy,"
their Atlantic debut, released earlier this
year. Last week, I chatted on the phone
with guitarist James Brogan about suc
cess, selling out, burritos and the future
of punk rock.
Samiam was on tour with Bad Reli
gion, and they had just had a night off,
tree time which Brogan claims the
bands spent changing guitar strings and
doing laundry. Whatever your personal
opinion about punk's sudden main
stream success, this isn't the kind of be
havior you'd expect from typical "rock
stars" — I can't really imagine Axl Rose
spending his off hours washing his box
ers. If it's accomplished anything at all,
the explosion of "alternative" has al
tered what it means to be successful in
popular music. Green Day is supposed
ly touring with only three roadies — I
bet it takes that many people to do Rod
Stewart's hair.
Brogan and most of the other band
members grew up in the Bay Area — he
can remember listening to punk on
KZSU and Berkeley's KALX as a kid. The
band members did time in various local
punk acts before Samiam started in 1988.
They honed their melodic sound on sev
eral albums for San Francisco indie New
Red Archives, gaining a considerable
local following and becoming a fixture of
the Bay Area punk scene, living and
working in Berkeley and San Francisco.
** Brogan still maintains Pancho Villa's
in the City has the best burritos any
where.
A few years ago, Samiam even

played Stanford's very own
"Wednesday Night Live," a weekly
program on KZSU featuring live
local music. Brogan remembers that
experience. "It was fun," he says, "we
brought all our friends down and
had a great time. Right when we

were about to start, someone dropped some
thing over the mike and there was this huge
noise. We all thought we blew an amp or some
thing."
Brogan says he's happy with life on a
major label. "It steps up things," he as
serts, "you do interviews, meet market
ing people. There's a bunch of people working
for you to try to make you successful." This
would have never happened on Samiam's old
label, he says, which was essentially "one guy
who pretty much just produced (the] records
and then just sort of threw it to people," with
out much effort put into publicity or promo
tion.
Atlantic is much better organized: with

I them, things are
happening that
could never have
. happened before
— publicists all
over the country
are working to
gether to push
their album. He

claims he's not put off to be working for a huge
corporation — in fact he says he usually doesn't
notice it unless he visits Atlantic headquarters,
when it's always kind of a shock to realize he's
part of the "gigantic" organization inside that
huge building.
Of course part of what punk was always sup
posed to be about was opposition to precisely

this: signing to a major was paramount to buy
ing into the capitalist commercial mentality,
flying directly in the face of the "do-it-your
self" ethic so central to punk. So with major
label success come the inevitable cries of "sell
out," the accusations that a band has somehow
tailored its message or compromised its vision
in order to appeal to a larger audience.
To hear Brogan tell it, his band's major label
success is more a story of the market coming to
Samiam than Samiam coming to the market.
"We could have signed right after our third
album came out," he counters, "but we waited
till the time was right for us." Brogan says
Samiam is still the same band they always were,
that their major label status hasn't affected the
kind of music they play or the kind of people

they are.
According to him, the majors came knock
ing and Samiam finally just decided to take a
chance. Brogan feels he and his bandmates de
serve their success. "You have to give up every
thing to be in a band. 111 end up making some
dough I think 1 deserve it. I've been in bands for
years and it's hard work".
Another thing Brogan says people don't un
derstand is that the huge figures that get tossed
around when a band is getting signed doesn't
go straight into the bandmember's pockets.
That "big money" represents recording bud
gets and advances for multiple albums over a
couple of years.
"It's not like you just get handed a big wad of
money," he says. "You have to sort of pay it back

over a few years." That's not to say that Samiam
didn't reap any financial benefits from signing
— all the band members were able to quit their
jobs and devote themselves to music full-time.
More money also means the ability to do more
from recording, spending more time in the stu
dio.
Brogan isn't sure Samiam is really looking
for the same kind of success that his fellow
Berkeley-ites in Green Day have achieved, ei
ther. Green Day has gotten so huge now, he
says, that people chase them in airports. F.ven
their bookmobile, the tour vehicle that they
cited in many early interviews as proof of their
continuing punk credibility, has been sold. It
was too well-known, and people were follow
ing them on the freeway.

Brogan finds Green Day's runaway success
exciting but also a little scary. "It's a big rush for
them. But they've gotten too mega-huge now
— they're like the Beatles or something. They
can never change their minds and go back to
playing the Berkeley Square again. We're not
trying to be huge — we're looking for a more
gradual process."
At any rate, Samiam is playing bigger
gigs now, opening for Bad Religion on
a tour that brings them to the Warfield
this month. According to Brogan, opening for
a respected act like BR on a medium-sized tour
like this is part of the "gradual process" that
Samiam is looking for. "It's a good thing," he
says, "to play bigger shows and sell more

records, but we're doing it with
out compromising ourselves."
By taking it slow, Samiam hopes
success will come to them on
their own terms.
I'm guarded in my opinions
about punk's newfound popular
ity. Clearly its status as a subcul
ture, a group of people in opposi
tion to the mainstream, has
changed drastically. It's much
harder to reject mainstream val
ues and fads if you're part of the
mainstream. Punk's commercial
success entails a massive soul
searching on the part of the peo
ple and bands who consider
themselves "punk" to determine
what, if anything, that label
means now.
To Brogan, punk isn't a de
finable thing — "it's whatever
anyone wants it to be." But what
Atlantic Records wants punk to
be is probably very different from
what the 14-year-olds putting on
shows in a basement or a garage
want.
Whether or not punk is ca
pable of encompassing both the
DIY ethic and bands like Samiam
and Green Day remains to be
seen, and it's a question whose
answer will say much about the
face of punk and music in gener
al in years to come. Is there a place
for punk and its traditionally
anti-mainstream attitude at the
table with other, more media
friendly musical genres? Is the
underground punk scene strong
enough to weather M TV star
dom?
Some would say no, that the
genre's new popularity means
that, as I heard recently, "punk
as we know it is not long for this
world." But for most of the peo
ple who care, the answers to

these questions are still up in the air, and the
way Samiam and similar bands handle whatev
er success they find will do much to provide an
answer. ■

over a few years." That's not to say that Samiam
didn't reap any financial benefits from signing
— all the band members were able to quit their
jobs and devote themselves to music full-time.
More money also means the ability to do more
from recording, spending more time in the stu
dio.
Brogan isn't sure Samiam is really looking
for the same kind of success that his fellow
Berkeley-ites in Green Day have achieved, ei
ther. Green Day has gotten so huge now, he
says, that people chase them in airports. F.ven
their bookmobile, the tour vehicle that they
cited in many early interviews as proof of their
continuing punk credibility, has been sold. It
was too well-known, and people were follow
ing them on the freeway.

Brogan finds Green Day's runaway success
exciting but also a little scary. "It's a big rush for
them. But they've gotten too mega-huge now
— they're like the Beatles or something. They
can never change their minds and go back to
playing the Berkeley Square again. We're not
trying to be huge — we're looking for a more
gradual process."
At any rate, Samiam is playing bigger
gigs now, opening for Bad Religion on
a tour that brings them to the Warfield
this month. According to Brogan, opening for
a respected act like BR on a medium-sized tour
like this is part of the "gradual process" that
Samiam is looking for. "It's a good thing," he
says, "to play bigger shows and sell more

records, but we're doing it with
out compromising ourselves."
By taking it slow, Samiam hopes
success will come to them on
their own terms.
I'm guarded in my opinions
about punk's newfound popular
ity. Clearly its status as a subcul
ture, a group of people in opposi
tion to the mainstream, has
changed drastically. It's much
harder to reject mainstream val
ues and fads if you're part of the
mainstream. Punk's commercial
success entails a massive soul
searching on the part of the peo
ple and bands who consider
themselves "punk" to determine
what, if anything, that label
means now.
To Brogan, punk isn't a de
finable thing — "it's whatever
anyone wants it to be." But what
Atlantic Records wants punk to
be is probably very different from
what the 14-year-olds putting on
shows in a basement or a garage
want.
Whether or not punk is ca
pable of encompassing both the
DIY ethic and bands like Samiam
and Green Day remains to be
seen, and it's a question whose
answer will say much about the
face of punk and music in gener
al in years to come. Is there a place
for punk and its traditionally
anti-mainstream attitude at the
table with other, more media
friendly musical genres? Is the
underground punk scene strong
enough to weather M TV star
dom?
Some would say no, that the
genre's new popularity means
that, as I heard recently, "punk
as we know it is not long for this
world." But for most of the peo
ple who care, the answers to

these questions are still up in the air, and the
way Samiam and similar bands handle whatev
er success they find will do much to provide an
answer. ■

You all probably already know that in the
wake of Green Days phenomenal suc
cess, the major labels have pegged the
Bay Area as the "next Seattle" and sent in their
legions of A&R reps, inciting a (lurry of con
tract-signing and bidding wars, spurring previ
ously unknown bands into the limelight with
seven-figure record deals.
While Samiam hasn't caunht unite the buzz

that Green I )ay did, they were one of the
first "punk" bands from the SF area to go
the major-label route, with "Clumsy,"
their Atlantic debut, released earlier this
year. Last week, I chatted on the phone
with guitarist James Brogan about suc
cess, selling out, burritos and the future
of punk rock.
Samiam was on tour with Bad Reli
gion, and they had just had a night off,
tree time which Brogan claims the
bands spent changing guitar strings and
doing laundry. Whatever your personal
opinion about punk's sudden main
stream success, this isn't the kind of be
havior you'd expect from typical "rock
stars" — I can't really imagine Axl Rose
spending his off hours washing his box
ers. If it's accomplished anything at all,
the explosion of "alternative" has al
tered what it means to be successful in
popular music. Green Day is supposed
ly touring with only three roadies — I
bet it takes that many people to do Rod
Stewart's hair.
Brogan and most of the other band
members grew up in the Bay Area — he
can remember listening to punk on
KZSU and Berkeley's KALX as a kid. The
band members did time in various local
punk acts before Samiam started in 1988.
They honed their melodic sound on sev
eral albums for San Francisco indie New
Red Archives, gaining a considerable
local following and becoming a fixture of
the Bay Area punk scene, living and
working in Berkeley and San Francisco.
** Brogan still maintains Pancho Villa's
in the City has the best burritos any
where.
A few years ago, Samiam even

played Stanford's very own
"Wednesday Night Live," a weekly
program on KZSU featuring live
local music. Brogan remembers that
experience. "It was fun," he says, "we
brought all our friends down and
had a great time. Right when we

were about to start, someone dropped some
thing over the mike and there was this huge
noise. We all thought we blew an amp or some
thing."
Brogan says he's happy with life on a
major label. "It steps up things," he as
serts, "you do interviews, meet market
ing people. There's a bunch of people working
for you to try to make you successful." This
would have never happened on Samiam's old
label, he says, which was essentially "one guy
who pretty much just produced (the] records
and then just sort of threw it to people," with
out much effort put into publicity or promo
tion.
Atlantic is much better organized: with

I them, things are
happening that
could never have
. happened before
— publicists all
over the country
are working to
gether to push
their album. He

claims he's not put off to be working for a huge
corporation — in fact he says he usually doesn't
notice it unless he visits Atlantic headquarters,
when it's always kind of a shock to realize he's
part of the "gigantic" organization inside that
huge building.
Of course part of what punk was always sup
posed to be about was opposition to precisely

this: signing to a major was paramount to buy
ing into the capitalist commercial mentality,
flying directly in the face of the "do-it-your
self" ethic so central to punk. So with major
label success come the inevitable cries of "sell
out," the accusations that a band has somehow
tailored its message or compromised its vision
in order to appeal to a larger audience.
To hear Brogan tell it, his band's major label
success is more a story of the market coming to
Samiam than Samiam coming to the market.
"We could have signed right after our third
album came out," he counters, "but we waited
till the time was right for us." Brogan says
Samiam is still the same band they always were,
that their major label status hasn't affected the
kind of music they play or the kind of people

they are.
According to him, the majors came knock
ing and Samiam finally just decided to take a
chance. Brogan feels he and his bandmates de
serve their success. "You have to give up every
thing to be in a band. 111 end up making some
dough I think 1 deserve it. I've been in bands for
years and it's hard work".
Another thing Brogan says people don't un
derstand is that the huge figures that get tossed
around when a band is getting signed doesn't
go straight into the bandmember's pockets.
That "big money" represents recording bud
gets and advances for multiple albums over a
couple of years.
"It's not like you just get handed a big wad of
money," he says. "You have to sort of pay it back

over a few years." That's not to say that Samiam
didn't reap any financial benefits from signing
— all the band members were able to quit their
jobs and devote themselves to music full-time.
More money also means the ability to do more
from recording, spending more time in the stu
