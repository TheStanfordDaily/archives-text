# OFFSPRING
## From the punk scene into whirlwind of sudden fame, bassist Greg K. resists analysis, labeling, movements — and our interviewer's queries 
### Taylor Antrim 
Raj Sandhu — Daily

It's a Friday afternoon and I'm on the
phone with Greg K., bassist and co
founding father of the pop-punk sensa
tion the Offspring.
"How are you?" I ask him.
"I'm okay."
"Good," I say. "Um, where are you?
"Home."
"Where's home?"
"Cypress, California. Orange county."
Pause. "Is it good to be home?"
"Uhh, yeah. End of the week."
He sounds like he's had a hard day at the
office. Sedate, inexpressive — 1 mean, he
sounds nice and everything, but just color
less. I'm having a hard time moving small
talk forward.
But then again I don't know what I ex
pected. That he'd use lots of expletives, put
me on hold so he could go kick somebody's
ass, smash the receiver on his forehead or
something. But then again, Greg still lives in
his mother's house and Sid Vicious is long
dead. Punk's got a different vibe these days.
I've got the newest Offspring release
"Smash" on in the background. "Bad Habit,"
a song about highway violence, plays quietly.
Dexter Holland, frontman for the band, is
screaming at low volume, "I open the glove
box, reach inside, gonna wreck this fucker's
ride."
Meanwhile I'm wondering how to spruce
this interview up.
So I decide to ask about '90's punk. Why
are these airy, user-friendly blips of ni
hilism and apathy that you keep hear
ing on the radio fast becoming national
youth anthems? The Offspring's own "No
Self Esteem" is an inescapable, crushing trib
ute to counter-culture misanthropy. It's
wonderfully unpretentious and hits so hard
it gives you goosebumps.
"Smash" has sold over a million albums.
Punk's got grunge on the run, and the Off
spring's right there at the head of the pack.
I ask Greg what's behind all his success.
What about his band's thrashing melodious
sound has stirred sweaty adolescent moshers
everywhere into a fever pitch?
He answers with the enthusiasm of an
overworked Jack-in-the-Box employee.
"Yeah well, we've been doing the same
thing that we've always been doing," he says.
"As far as the whole thing with the punk
movement — it's really been two bands: us
and Green Day and they've been doing the
same thing too if you listen to any of their old

albums. It's all the same stuff, so I don't re
ally know if it's anything new, but I guess,
you know, people catch on to certain
things for whatever reason."
Not that I was expecting a drawn-out
iilirnr /-\ 112 fVio nlmonfc r\ C /•nlfiiro

analysis or the ailments or a youth culture
that cries out for a lighter, less heavy-handed
aggression or anything, but there's got to be
more to it than Greg's lottery of random suc
cess. Something's changing, right? Doesn't
slow-grinding thump and crunch feel a bit
pass£ these days?
I push it a little. What happened to
grunge, Greg?
"Nobody's really tired of it. Nirvana put
out a couple really great albums and that

kind of stuff would really
work today. 'Nevermind' is
one of my favorite albums of
all time and it was the same
thing when that came out,
people tried to make a grunge
movement and it was just one
band. It's the same thing now
— they're trying to make a
punk movement with two
bands."
Hmm. At the risk of be
coming part of the problem, I
think to myself that there's
got to be more to it. Remem
ber Candlebox? Three years
ago they might have been
huge. These days they've got
the staying power of week
old egg nog.
I don't say anything
though. The Offspring can
have their success explana
tion-free if they want it.
Greg breaks the lull. "I
think people like our
stuff for the power of
it and the melody that you
can sing along to. I think
that's all it is."
Well, maybe he's right.
Maybe the combination of
chaos and effervescence is
what's irresistible. Occasion
ally they do sound like they're
having a hell of a good time.
"What Happened to You?"

from "Smash" bounces along with a slippery
ska beat so catchy that you can just imagine
the band members in a conga line bunny
hopping through the studio.
And maybe there are no "movements"
anymore. The Offspring's songs have this
catch-me-if-you-can feel to them anyway.
"Come Out and Play" slides around like a
snake charmer, interjecting hip-hop tag

lines, Middle-Eastern-flavored arpeggios
and crushing guitars. "Genocide" blazes like
an animal in heat. Too fast even for foot-tap
ping.
Quite an accomplishment for the ultra
lethargic Greg K. But the elusiveness of the
music complements his don't-peg-me-to
anything non-aura.
Lyrically too, Greg's band eludes pigeon
holing. "Nitro" offers grade-A apathy: "We
might as well just throw it all/ And live like
there's no tomorrow." "Come Out and Play"
contains hopelessness so absolute, it betrays
its musical loopiness.
And "Self-Esteem" dances a two-step be
tween the sexual politics of woman-hating

and self-hating without stepping on any
one's feet: "Lalte at night she knocks on my
door/ Drunk again and looking to score/
Now I know I s;hould say no / But that's kind
of hard when she's ready to go/ I may be
dumb, but I'm not a dweeb/ I'm just a suck
er with no self esteem."
On the lyrics Greg has this to say:
"We don't really care. We're not there to

give any message anyway, so we don't really
care what people think about the lyrics. If
you get something out of them, fine. Fine if
you don't.
"And yeah, that slacker thing keeps com
ing up. As far as we go, people are just gonna
interpret everything any way they want. We
put out what we like to do, and you can take
it any way you want."
So apart from Greg K.'s deadpan, his "I
could care less" tone, he may have a point.
The Offspring just aren't down enough with
anything to be at the forefront of a "move
ment."
They sure can make a hell of a racket,
though.

Orange County, the Greenwich, Con
necticut of the West Coast, seems an
odd place for angry punkers.
But it was local Southern California hard
core bands which inspired Dexter Holland
and Greg K. to form a band of their own.
"We were hanging out one night and
thought we wanted to be in a band," Greg
says."The stuff that we played were the

bands we were listening to like the Adoles
cents, TSOL, Agent Orange. First we learned
how to play the instruments sort of gradual
ly. [Dexter] would pretty much just come
over to my house and we'd be upstairs play
ing every weekend, just screwing around."
Greg was out of high school at this point
and Dexter was finishing up. When Dexter
headed to the USC he'd come home on the
weekends to play. It was more geekiness than
a common need to question any authority
which brought the two friends together.
"I know that for some of the other bands
like Social Distortion and some of the small
er bands it was more of a rebellion thing. But
we came from middle-class families, you

know, we had nice childhoods, so it wasn't
like an angst thing, it was just something
that we liked to do."
Guitarist Noodles and drummer Ron
Welty joined the two soon afterwards, and
the foursome started looking for a label.
"We talked to Epitaph about eight
months before we signed with them and

they said they weren't interested at the time
so we sent our tape to a lot of different peo
ple — Epitaph too, just for the hell of it."
And the rest is history. Brett Gurewitz,
lead singer of Bad Religion and head of Epi
taph Records in Los Angeles signed them in
April of 1992 and now his tiny label has ex
ploded from the success of the Offspring's
two LPs, "Ignition" and "Smash." If anyone
would endorse a punk movement it seems it
would be him.
Greg manages to dredge up some enthu
siasm about his band's experience with Epi
taph.
"It's really good. I mean, there's a percep
tion that you could never do this on an inde-

pendent label. We never thought that you
could even get on the radio. The fact that it
happened and they were able to handle it
has really been great."
How about major label attention?
"They haven't been coming cause we put
out the word that we're not going to sign
with anybody. At first they were on us hard

when the album started hitting but then we
told them that we were not interested."
I ask him what he thought a switch like
that would represent.
"I don't know if it would change any
thing if we went to a major, and we're not
opposed to doing that, we don't know yet.
We want to keep control, though, and still
be able to do what we want to do.
"Usually you go to majors and you have
to play a major label game no matter what,
but we can always fall back to Epitaph no
matter what, like 'screw you guys we're just
gonna go here,' " he continues.
"But I think Green Day is still doing things
they way they want and they're on Warner,

so it's possible."
Sounds
like the Off
spring will have
to deal with
angry discon
tents who re
member the
band's obscure
beginning in
surf-and-skate
videos. The kids
who'll shout
that cliche of al
ternative snob
bery —
"Sellout."
The
thing is though,
that "Smash"
succeeds by hit
ting hard in all
the right places.
It's no more
palatable than
the Offspring's
earlier sound.
The pre
vious album,
"Ignition," the
one featured on
all the skate-rat
home movies
was, well,
mediocre. I ask
Greg about the
differences be
tween the two al-

bums.
"I think things on 'Smash' just got more
refined," he says,"and we got better playing
and things got a little more diverse. Some
stuff is a little slower, and umm... we've got
a ska song on there. I mean the approach
was the same, the overall attitude of the
thing — energetic, powerful music. It's an

improvement or whatever. That's what you
want to do album to album, just keep get
ting better."
So Greg, I say, searching for an adrena
line-inducing doozie of a question. His
mood is getting me down. I ask him about
any problems with success, any drugged
out decadence, any new Miatas in the front
drive?
"No, it's more this sort 0f... 'cool.' "
Uh-huh.
Okay, last thing. The future of the Off
spring. Nirvana — the one band, ac
cording to Greg, behind the "grunge
movement" — lingered, reinventing them
selves occasionally, finally disappearing be
cause of you-know-what. But the Off
spring's ability to keep hammering at pop
melodies with ferocious abandon seems
limited.
"It depends on what you do." Greg says,
characteristically hedging. "I mean Stone
Temple Pilots came out with their second
album, not to compare us to them, but I
think their second album was really good.
But there are bands that have that one hit
album and then they put out something else
and just go away for ever.
"If we can progress, yeah, and I think
there's a chance to progress," he says.
"I think with Green Day a lot of their
songs are more similar so its gonna be hard
for them to get out of that. For us too, I
guess, I don't really know what we have in
mind. We're not really gonna change a lot
So people might just get sick of it."
If you ask me, the "we don't give a shit"
attitude gets a bit boring after a while.
The irritating thing is that the music
sounds ebullient and exhilarating, nothing
like Greg's Generation-You-Know-What
saturated-in-slack tone.
The phone call ends pleasantly, if
abruptly. I hold off looking back over my
notes for a minute, avoid pondering what
punk is all about, and why it breeds anti
enthusiasm. I hold off thinking about any
thing at all, actually, and just reset "Smash"
on the CD player and turn the volume up
up up.
Finally, I think. All is forgiven. ■
