# Senate approves special-fee plan
## Sweatshirt rule pushes bill over the top; ASSU may take second look in January 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
The ASSU's "sweatshirt rule"
had its first major effect on senate
policy last night, as the senate nar
rowly approved the recommenda
tion of the Special Fee Reform Task
Force — a decision which may be re
versed at the senate's next meeting.
Approval of the proposal, which
required two-thirds of the senate
and paves the way for a student vote
in late January, hinged on the fact
that two graduate senators were not
wearing the senate's sweatshirt uni
form and, as a result, were ruled in
eligible to vote.
The sweatshirt rule, which pro
hibits any senator not wearing the
mandated gray ASSU sweatshirt
from voting, was amended to the
ASSU constitution last spring and
has been in effect since the begin
ning of this senate's session.
Though Senate Chair Nawwar
Kasrawi said the special-fee bill now

stands as passed, last night's disput
ed result does not necessarily mean
the bill's fate is decided. A motion to
reconsider the legislation — pushed
by opponents of the task force's rec
ommendations — was passed before
the meeting adjourned, meaning an
other vote on the bill could occur at
the next senate meeting in January.
If senate approval of the proposal
stands, the student body will have
the opportunity to vote on the task
force's recommendations in a spe
cial election now scheduled for Jan
uary 25-26. Student approval,
which would amend the ASSU Con
stitution, would require a two
thirds vote. The senate also ap
proved $10,000 in funding for the
election.
Among the most significant as
pects of the task force's report are
provisions to split undergraduates
and graduates into two distinct
"voting communities" and to end
the special-fee refund system.
The final vote on the bill was 14
senators in favor and 7 senators
opposed. Kasrawi cast the decid
ing vote in favor of the proposal
after ruling that graduate sena
tors Julie Cantor and Lowell
Hawkins were deemed ineligible
to vote because they were not
wearing their sweatshirts. Both
had voted against the task force's
recommendation.
While bill supporters argued
that the senate should approve the
bill and let the student body decide
whether or not to adopt the rec
ommendations, other senators
criticized Kasrawi's actions, say
ing the senate chair had abused
his power.
Undergraduate senator Smeeta
Ramarathnam changed her vote
from yes to abstention, and then
to no in response to Kasrawi's rul
ing.
"The reason that I changed was
that I fundamentally disagreed
with Nawwar's stripping of Julie's
voting rights after she voted and
was marked as present," she said.
Ramarathnam added that she

believed senators who were not
wearing their sweatshirts at previ
ous meetings hud been counted as
present.
Her switch did not have an
effect on the bill's outcome, how
ever, because undergraduate sen
ator Jason Liu changed his vote
from abstention to yes after prod
ding by Council of Presidents
member Mork Murdock, among
others advocates of the bill.
Cantor said she was surprised
by Kasrawi's ruling. "It's a rule
that hasn't been discussed this
year, and it's just surprising," she
said.
Other opponents of the task
force's proposal expressed more
outrage over Kasrawi's ruling,
calling it "political" and a case of
"selective enforcement."
Kasrawi, however, said he
didn't believe either charge was
true.
Undergraduate senator
Stephen Russell, a junior, called
Kasrawi's ruling "the most colos
sal abuse of senate power in recent
senate history." He charged that
"on at least six occasions ... Kas
rawi ignored senate bylaws in
order to enforce his own personal
vision on a bill he co-authored."
Kasrawi could not be reached
after the meeting for comment on

'The point is that we
believe this should be
put to the student body.'

the issue.
Graduate senator Sandeep
Singhal, who led the debate
against the task force's proposal,
said, "I support the enforcement
of the [ASSU] constitution. I do
not support selective enforcement
of the constitution when it's con
venient."
After a few attempts to over
turn Kasrawi's ruling that Cantor
and Hawkins be denied voting
privileges, undergraduate senator
Ed Malone made a motion to
remove Kasrawi as senate chair.
With only one vote of support, the
motion failed.
Malone accused Kasrawi and
others of "cheating" in order to
get the result they wanted.
Supporters of the bill said that
those who voted against the bill
were missing the main point —
which they said was simply to give
the student body the right to vote
on the plan.

"The point is that we believe
this should be put to the student
body," Murdock said. "And that's
what this does. Period."
Graduate student Karen Seta,
who chaired the task force that
wrote the proposal, said, "I really
feel strongly that this amendment
should be put to the student body
for a vote."
Seta added that she was
"amused" by the machinations of
the Senate and "disappointed" by
the senators who opposed the bill.
"They seem to be opposed to the
idea of putting it on the ballot,"
she said.
And undergraduate senator
Elvira Prieto, a junior, said, "It's
very arrogant for any one senator
or group of senators to determine
what is good for the entire student
body."
Undergraduate senator Andre
Vanier, a sophomore, said he
thinks there will be enough votes
at the next senate meeting in Jan
uary to defeat the legislation. If
the bill does go down to defeat, he
said, he is looking to introduce a
bill that would preserve the spe
cial-fee refund process.

half-hour timed debate in which
senators argued the merits of the

force's recommendations in a spe
cial election now scheduled for Jan
uary 25-26. Student approval,
which would amend the ASSU Con
stitution, would require a two
thirds vote. The senate also ap
proved $10,000 in funding for the
election.
Among the most significant as
pects of the task force's report are
provisions to split undergraduates
and graduates into two distinct
"voting communities" and to end
the special-fee refund system.
The final vote on the bill was 14
senators in favor and 7 senators
opposed. Kasrawi cast the decid
ing vote in favor of the proposal
after ruling that graduate sena
tors Julie Cantor and Lowell
Hawkins were deemed ineligible
to vote because they were not
wearing their sweatshirts. Both
had voted against the task force's
recommendation.
While bill supporters argued
that the senate should approve the
bill and let the student body decide
whether or not to adopt the rec
ommendations, other senators
criticized Kasrawi's actions, say
ing the senate chair had abused
his power.
Undergraduate senator Smeeta
Ramarathnam changed her vote
from yes to abstention, and then
to no in response to Kasrawi's rul
ing.
"The reason that I changed was
that I fundamentally disagreed
with Nawwar's stripping of Julie's
voting rights after she voted and
was marked as present," she said.
Ramarathnam added that she

believed senators who were not
wearing their sweatshirts at previ
ous meetings hud been counted as
present.
Her switch did not have an
effect on the bill's outcome, how
ever, because undergraduate sen
ator Jason Liu changed his vote
from abstention to yes after prod
ding by Council of Presidents
member Mork Murdock, among
others advocates of the bill.
Cantor said she was surprised
by Kasrawi's ruling. "It's a rule
that hasn't been discussed this
year, and it's just surprising," she
said.
Other opponents of the task
force's proposal expressed more
outrage over Kasrawi's ruling,
calling it "political" and a case of
"selective enforcement."
Kasrawi, however, said he
didn't believe either charge was
true.
Undergraduate senator
Stephen Russell, a junior, called
Kasrawi's ruling "the most colos
sal abuse of senate power in recent
senate history." He charged that
"on at least six occasions ... Kas
rawi ignored senate bylaws in
order to enforce his own personal
vision on a bill he co-authored."
Kasrawi could not be reached
after the meeting for comment on

'The point is that we
believe this should be
put to the student body.'

the issue.
Graduate senator Sandeep
Singhal, who led the debate
against the task force's proposal,
said, "I support the enforcement
of the [ASSU] constitution. I do
not support selective enforcement
of the constitution when it's con
venient."
After a few attempts to over
turn Kasrawi's ruling that Cantor
and Hawkins be denied voting
privileges, undergraduate senator
Ed Malone made a motion to
remove Kasrawi as senate chair.
With only one vote of support, the
motion failed.
Malone accused Kasrawi and
others of "cheating" in order to
get the result they wanted.
Supporters of the bill said that
those who voted against the bill
were missing the main point —
which they said was simply to give
the student body the right to vote
on the plan.

"The point is that we believe
this should be put to the student
body," Murdock said. "And that's
what this does. Period."
Graduate student Karen Seta,
who chaired the task force that
wrote the proposal, said, "I really
feel strongly that this amendment
should be put to the student body
for a vote."
Seta added that she was
"amused" by the machinations of
the Senate and "disappointed" by
the senators who opposed the bill.
"They seem to be opposed to the
idea of putting it on the ballot,"
she said.
And undergraduate senator
Elvira Prieto, a junior, said, "It's
very arrogant for any one senator
or group of senators to determine
what is good for the entire student
body."
Undergraduate senator Andre
Vanier, a sophomore, said he
thinks there will be enough votes
at the next senate meeting in Jan
uary to defeat the legislation. If
the bill does go down to defeat, he
said, he is looking to introduce a
bill that would preserve the spe
cial-fee refund process.
The senate's vote followed a
half-hour timed debate in which
senators argued the merits of the
proposal.
The ASSU's "sweatshirt rule"
had its first major effect on senate
policy last night, as the senate nar
rowly approved the recommenda
tion of the Special Fee Reform Task
Force — a decision which may be re
versed at the senate's next meeting.
Approval of the proposal, which
required two-thirds of the senate
and paves the way for a student vote
in late January, hinged on the fact
that two graduate senators were not
wearing the senate's sweatshirt uni
form and, as a result, were ruled in
eligible to vote.
The sweatshirt rule, which pro
hibits any senator not wearing the
mandated gray ASSU sweatshirt
from voting, was amended to the
ASSU constitution last spring and
has been in effect since the begin
ning of this senate's session.
Though Senate Chair Nawwar
Kasrawi said the special-fee bill now

stands as passed, last night's disput
ed result does not necessarily mean
the bill's fate is decided. A motion to
reconsider the legislation — pushed
by opponents of the task force's rec
ommendations — was passed before
the meeting adjourned, meaning an
other vote on the bill could occur at
the next senate meeting in January.
If senate approval of the proposal
stands, the student body will have
the opportunity to vote on the task
force's recommendations in a spe
cial election now scheduled for Jan
uary 25-26. Student approval,
which would amend the ASSU Con
stitution, would require a two
