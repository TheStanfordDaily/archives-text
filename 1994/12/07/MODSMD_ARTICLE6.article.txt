# Senate approves special-fee plan
## Sweatshirt rule pushes bill over the top; ASSU may take second look in January 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
The ASSU's "sweatshirt rule"
had its first major effect on senate
policy last night, as the senate nar
rowly approved the recommenda
tion of the Special Fee Reform Task
Force — a decision which may be re
versed at the senate's next meeting.
Approval of the proposal, which
required two-thirds of the senate
and paves the way for a student vote
in late January, hinged on the fact
that two graduate senators were not
wearing the senate's sweatshirt uni
form and, as a result, were ruled in
eligible to vote.
The sweatshirt rule, which pro
hibits any senator not wearing the
mandated gray ASSU sweatshirt
from voting, was amended to the
ASSU constitution last spring and
has been in effect since the begin
ning of this senate's session.
Though Senate Chair Nawwar
Kasrawi said the special-fee bill now

stands as passed, last night's disput
ed result does not necessarily mean
the bill's fate is decided. A motion to
reconsider the legislation — pushed
by opponents of the task force's rec
ommendations — was passed before
the meeting adjourned, meaning an
other vote on the bill could occur at
the next senate meeting in January.
If senate approval of the proposal
stands, the student body will have
the opportunity to vote on the task
force's recommendations in a spe
cial election now scheduled for Jan
uary 25-26. Student approval,
which would amend the ASSU Con
stitution, would require a two
thirds vote. The senate also ap
proved $10,000 in funding for the
election.
Among the most significant as
pects of the task force's report are
provisions to split undergraduates
and graduates into two distinct
"voting communities" and to end
