# Much rather be 'Home Alone'

Before you knew it, it was over.
In a rather abrupt odyssey, little Richard
conquers his fears. For those of you who are
mortally afraid of your forthcoming finals,
"Pagemaster" might provide a few tips on how
to handle your readings — drown in them and
dream on.
Richard Tyler (Macaulay Culkin) is a he
spectacled wimp who spouts statistics and per
centages of accidents within the confines of his
home. When his dad forces him out on a dan
gerous errand to buy nails, Richards life will
never be the same.
A storm forces Richard to take refuge in an
empty library from where he takes off on an
animated adventure by the Pagemaster, keeper
of the books and guardian of the written word.
Richaid is transformed from a human
being to an illustration. Three timeless literary
themes Horror (Frank Welker), Adventure
(Patrick Stewart) and Fantasy (Whoopi (iold
berg) join a cartoon Richard on his journey to
becoming a hero.
The quartet become fast friends. They sail
the seven seas, tly on a magic carpet and per
form many other typical cartoon character
feats. In a medley of uninteresting, disjointed
adventures, the group meets literary greats
Captain Ahab, Moby Dick, Long John Silver,

Mr. Hyde and others. Throughout the film,
Richard predictably rescues himself and his
friends from the clutches of death many a time
and leads them to freedom.
For those of who can't stand the sight of
Culkin, don't worry, you'll only have to put up
with him only for a few minutes. You won't see

The Pagemaster

much of Christopher Lloyd, who plays the
Pagemaster, either.
Ultimately, Richard's heroics don't do
enough to save the movie. Filled with unspec
tacular animation and an interesting, yet
piecemeal theme, "Pagemaster" comes up
short on laughs and even fails to convince on
the basis of its voice-overs, which are simply
unengaging.
So for now, think of Horror as reading for
your finals, Adventure as taking them and Fan
tasy as good grades. Frankly, staying home as
studying for your finals may be more engaging,
and rewarding, than watching this movie.
