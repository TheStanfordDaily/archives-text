Here's the innovative new approach for Andre Gregory's film "Vanya
on 42nd Street" — a century-old script and nine actors.
Sounds pretty basic? It is. This movie takes the original idea behind the
ater and turns it into a play-within-a-movie with both vitality and force.
There are no costumes, no sets, no special effects, not even a stage. De
spite brief interruptions from the director and glimpses of an audience,
the modern-day clothing and props are really the only reminder that
these people are meant to be actors, and not the actual characters.
The play they perform involves an older professor (George Gaynes)
who returns to his country estate after a long absence with a beautiful new

wife Yelena (Julianne
Moore from"The Hand
that Rocks the Cradle"). Ye
lena proceeds to charm
both her husband's broth
er-in-law Vanya (Wallace

Shawn of "The Princess Bride" fame) and the family doctor Astrov (Larry
Pine) into falling in love with her. As Astrov increases his house visits, Ye
lena flirts with both men, while her homely new stepdaughter Sonya
pines away for the attention of the handsome doctor.
With no other distractions, the acting in "Vanya" has to be extraordi
nary. Luckily, it is. This troupe has been working together since 1989 and
their resulting chemistry creates a genuinely moving experience.
