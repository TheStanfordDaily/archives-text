## 'Blue,' 'White,'... 'Red' caps off amazing trilogy 
### 
Rare is the filmmaker today, able to make
a plain statement about the world we live in
without shrouding it with layers of oh-so
clever parody, or drowning it in depths of
fashionable pastiche.
Thankfully, the Polish writer-director

Red

Krzyzstof Kieslowski is one artist who
prefers to wear his philosophies on his
sleeve, and the payoff is handsome; his
"Three Colors" trilogy is heart-rending
("Blue"), provocative ("White") and ulti
mately uplifting ("Red"). Kieslowski's per
sonal take on the mechanics of life and des
tiny filters through an intricately-crafted
web of human inter-relatedness, and im
plies the heartening notion that no one is re
ally alone.
Being the director's probable swan-song
— he announced his retirement plans at
Cannes — "Red" is clearly more Kies
lowskian than anything that came before it.
Made up of characters drawn to each other
by seemingly inexplicate dealings of fate, the
captivating film also delicately suggests that
metaphysical forces may not be beyond
tampering by human will.
In fact, the character of Joseph (a superb
Jean-Louis Trintignant) — an enigmatic ex -
judge who oversees his neighbors' moral
transgressions by tapping their phone lines
— is perhaps none other than Kieslowski's
alter-ego. Alluding to the filmmaker's
power of playing God to fictional beings on
celluloid, Kieslowski creates a self-reflexive
icon in Joseph, who similarly appears able
to maneuver lives on a grand scheme.

As a perfect counterpoint to Joseph's
wisened cynicism, the innocence of Valen
tine (ravishing Irene Jacob), a young lash
ion model, is beautifully rendered. Having
knocked down Joseph's dog with her car,
Valentine stumbles across the old man's
voyeuristic past-time and indignantly ut
ters: "Everybody deserves a private life."
Soon, she comes to comprehend Joseph's
bitterness and self-imposed solitude as his
frosty demeanour begins to thaw, and two
strike up an unlikely friendship.
A remarkable series of events ensues. Au
guste (Jean-Pierre Lorit) is a law student
whose apartment happens to be just across
the street from Valentine's, but their paths
have never crossed. By eavesdropping on
Auguste's phone conversations, Joseph dis
covers that the younger man is presently liv
ing out his own tragic past, and proceeds to
devise a plan to bring him and Valentine to
gether.
Unlike the similarly-themed "The Dou
ble Life of Veronique," "Red" finds Kies
lowski in a far more optimistic mood, and
the unexpected warmth is palpable
throughout. Even the high technology of
telecommunications receives a benevolent
treatment from the director: after all, the
telephone line and television screen are the
primary instruments for engineering and
manifesting Joseph's gesture of supreme
generosity in his love for Valentine.
In the final moments of"Red," Kieslows
ki recalls the primary elements of "Blue"
and "White" in a fantastic and fitting reso
lution to the questions on liberty, equality
and fraternity posed by the trilogy. Freedom
and fairness may exact a hefty toll on life's
happiness, but no one should suffer in cold
isolation — for at every corner, there is a
kindred soul.
