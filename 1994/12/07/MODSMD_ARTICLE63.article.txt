# Steve Martin's new comedy 'Mixed Nuts' does nothing better than bark lame Christmas carols
## 
### 
"Mixed Nuts," a new Christmas romantic comedy star
ing Steve Martin, is neither romantic nor very comic. This
story about the suicide prevention hotline L.ifesavers is a
hodge-podge of ringing telephones, flying fruitcakes (and

even dancing ones), a looming Sea
side Strangler and rollerbladers
bearing Christmas trees.
Although Philip (Steve Martin)
and his hotline workers Catherine
O'Shaughnessey (Rita Wilson) and

Mixed Nuts

Blanche Munchnik (Medallion Kahn) purport to be saving
desperate souls from suicide, they obviously are the ones
who need help, especially on this Christmas Eve night.
Philip, usually a do-gooder, is turned temporarily into a
Scrooge because his fiancee dumps him and his landlord
threatens to evict his business from the building. Catherine,
his sappy and teary-eyed secret admirer, and Mrs. Munch
nik, a hard-nosed widow married just long enough to be
come bitter about the opposite sex, attempt to maintain
order amidst the chaos created by an obscene caller, a lonely
transvestite (Liev Schreiber), a quarreling couple (Juliette
I.ewis and Anthony LaPaglia), and a bothersome ukulele

player (Adam Sandler).
The underdeveloped characters fail to develop the sym
pathy Jimmy Stewart does in "It's a Wonderful Life." The
movie is too fast-paced to allow the audience to reflect on the

disturbing truth of some of its lines.
"Mixed Nuts" is too predictable
to cause genuine laughter. Both the
"jokes" and the "insights" — terms I

use loosely here
— are shoveled

out as one-liners and slapstick visuals.
The movie is complete with a good
dose of Christmas songs, including a
particularly cool version of "We Wish
You a Merry Christmas" composed
exclusively of dogs' barks, cats' meows
and other animal noises. Seeing
"Mixed Nuts" is a great way to mental
ly brace yourself for the relatives and fi
ascoes that inevitably come every holi
day season.
