# The
						best of the overlooked in 1994
## Arnold Pan 
### 
At the end of the year, it's almost too
tempting to compile a list of "the year's best,"
to compare and rank bands and their albums
like they were college football teams. But any
thing short of a playoff system or the Village
Voice's Fa/7. & lop poll isn't gonna solve a
thing or change any minds — after all, the
canon according to Spin is only good for a
chuckle and a groan.
Rather, let's cap 1994 off like those darned
course evaluations do, where there's excellent
and good, not best and better. Here are a few

tour tree yet some
what obscured stars in
the galaxy of the year's
fine recordings:
• Bedhead, "What Fu
n
Like Luna and Yo
La Tengo, Bedhead only
takes its Velvet Under
ground influence liter
ally and spins its own
distinctive guitar-dri
nven trance. "What Fu

spins

Life Was" hypnotizes with intensity, stirring
and powerful without ever overdoing it. Yet
the band never holds anything back: Bedhead
beguiles with its fastball because it has a
change-up.
"I lavwire" is an intricate weave of guitars,
where the chugging blasts at the surface build
up with energy by following the lead of a
thread of melody beneath. "Bedside Table"
starts off peacefully then progresses with an
urgent patience only to explode thrillingly in
an off-kilter crescendo that continues grow.
What's remarkable is that both songs, as well
as the entire album, maintain a stately repose,
a dignity in pushing past limits rather than
crashing and burning into them.
• Blake Babies, "Nicely, Nicely"
Though it's a seven-year-old recording by
a band that's only a fond memory, this reissue
ol the Blake Babies' rare I )IY, vinyl-only debut
rock n-rollicks with a freshness and vibrance
that belies its old age. With its messy guitar
hooks, simple-yet-catchy rhythms and
squeaky-sweet Juliana Hatfield vocals, "Nice
ly, Nicely" is quirk pop at its most delightful.

"Wipe It Up" kicks
the album oft with frantic melody, setting a
speedy tone which runs energetically through
the tunes to follow. The next track, "Her," is a
jumping ditty, punctuated by Hatfield's and
John Strohm s furious strumming. And take
your pick of classic Juliana-isms, the best of
which is, "1 don't wanna be a cocaine slut."
"Nicely, Nicely" puts these Babies to sleep, uh,
nicely, giving a final glimpse that looks back to
the start.
• Ivy, "Lately"
The band's cover of the Orange Juice tune
"I Ciuess I'm Just a Little Too Sensitive" says
everything about Ivy and its charming five
song offering — what sounds like flimsy art
crap on first listen turns out to be crisp, pris
tine pop which wins over with gentle nudges.
Originals like "1 I late 1 )ecember" and "Can't
Kven Fake It" skip along with a moody calm
which makes peace with the nightmares and
broken relationships that are the subjects of
the songs. The elements of chimy guitars,
plump rhythms and the accented cool of
singer Dominique Durand's frenchy voice

come together and
strike a pleasant bal
ance, one that's fragile
without being frail.

• Versus, "The Stars Are Insane"
Fidgety and cool at the same time, "The
Stars Are Insane" is an album where those
whose so-called lives have turned into so-so
lives can find a little comfort. On top, Versus
soothes and startles with a wash of wistful
rhythm and guitars that almost veil the vul
nerable words. Still, the band's instrumental
prowess can't quite cover the gawky guy-'n
girl vocals which stick out endearingly.
While "Deseret" marches from start toend
with a bounding pace and delivers (inly one
verse, boy singer Richard Baluyut's agitated
"All right?" 's echo long after the song fades
out. When Baluyut calls out from the twin
kling soundscape of "Blade of Grass" that
"first time, next time" is more like "first time,
last time," he seems to say that grown up and
growing up are pretty much the same. And
that he knows it makes all the difference.
