# Rick raps from 'Behind Bars'
## 
### 
After three years in lock-up, who wouldn't
be curious what Slick Kick "The Ruler" had to
say? His account of "Razor City" as he calls it,
is one you won't easily forget.
His first single, "Behind Bars" skillfully re
counts the world through a prisoner's eyes. Pic
tures of jail rape, riots, robberies and vendettas
all comprise the type of shit Rick maintains hap
pens everyday. The Dum Ditty Dum remix of
this cut, which ironically contains samples from
Les McCann's "Sometimes I ("ry," flows due to
the addition of the lyrical sounds of Warren (.1.
So how does The Ruler see his kingdom

from inside the slammer? Seems that prison life gave the old-school rapper
insight into pressing situations such as single motherhood, street lite, man
hood and unemployment.
Arguably the best cut on the album, "All Alone" recounts the life of Dawn,
an innocent teenager that gets roped in by love, then single-handedly raises
the resultant child. The dominant message in this song is exhibited in there-

curring phrase "she did it all with
out no man who she once thought
she couldn't live without." Wait a
minute, what is this, Slick Rick cel
ebrating a woman's strength?
Maybe, maybe not. In cuts like
"Sittin' in My Car," "A l ove That 's
I rue" and "I'm Captive, he talks

"Behind Bars"
Slick Rick

about women in the same old demoralizing way. I hey re still liars, hos, gold
diggers and drug addicts. 1 uckily, there are other cuts on the album that give
serious messages such as"(let a Job" and"It s a Boy. 1 hese songs address the
lack of motivation among Rick's friends to seek employment and the re
sponsibility of raising a child.
Kick's lyrical skills and slammin' beats allow him to get his messages across.
But before you suggest that jail has turned him into a walking, talking PSA re
call that the Ruler hasoften had something valuable to say, like in past cuts like
"Children's Story. Its a welcome change to see more of that in one album.
