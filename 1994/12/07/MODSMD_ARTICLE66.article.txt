# Crowes tempt with Southern treats

### 
"Amorica"
Black Crowes

Appearing to hail from two distinct locations on the
time-space map, both the deep South and the late '60s, The
Black Crowes are back with a third platter of southern-fried
boogie. Forged in six months, "Amorica" addresses the ma
ture themes of sexuality, drug use, anger, fear and liberty.
Lead by the vocal prowess of the throaty Chris Robin-

son and songwriting brother and guitar player
Rich, The Crowes' new thematic material tends
to leave behind the magical-realism of south
ern mythology (a la "Remedy" from the
"Southern Harmony and Melody Compan
ion") while continuing to blend the powerful
and rich musical patchwork that the South
claims as heritage.
Influences like Aretha Franklin, Booker I
and the \1( is, Robert Johnson, the celestial side
ol The Beatles and the bluesy side of Led Zep
plin are obvious throughout the work. Laced
with the vintage sounds of gritty dobro play
ing, fu/zv guitars and Hammond organs, the
album especially shines on songs like the beau
tiful, rollinu "Ballad in Urgency" with comple
mentary pedal steel and electric piano solos,
sounds that most '90s pop artists would rather
leave in the dusty garage of the musical past.
The disc also juxtaposes an urgent driving
side as in the throbbing, bluesy "H 25 London,"
with a number of slower tracks like the
poignant "Nonfiction" and "Descending," the
album's emotional closer.

However, the acoustic rag-blues "Downtown Money
Waster" is demeaned by the sloppy, imitative lyrics unfor
tunately laid down by Robinson.
As The Black Crowes continue to learn and draw from
their southern parentage, there is a simultaneous rejection
of the themes that made the Black Crowes the success they
are today. To pull off addressing such mature themes, Chris
Robinson and crew still have some work to do, as the lyri
cal content of this album is definitely its weak point.
Still, the CI) shows a significant amount of musical
growth, and "Amorica" shines with the creative force of
one of todays most rocking and rolling bands.
