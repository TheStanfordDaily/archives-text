# Brand Nubian's new release is a blast
## 
### 
Brand Nubian is unafraid. Audacious. Unflinching. Wit
ness how they embrace musical evolution instead of turning
their cheeks. Observe how they seek success without hesita
tion. Marvel at how they tackle tough societal issues with
aplomb.
Listen to "Everything is Everything" and understand con
fidence. This impressive effort exhibits everything that a rap

group should be — bold and smooth, interesting and con
troversial.
From the beginning of "Everything is Everything," a wake
up call is issued to all rap fans that have fallen asleep on this
trio's style. "Word Is Bond," using a sample of The Average
White Band's "I'm the One," is an appropriate refresher to
the group's musical motif. The sample con
tains mellow bass that is sweetly compli
mented by '70s funk guitar, vintage organ,
and melodic horns. The voices of Brand Nu-

"Everything is Everything"
Brand Nubian

bian, Sadat X and Lord Jamar celebrate the
group's return with a party-like feel
"Word is bond, we got itgoingon/ Brand Nu
bian will rock till the break of dawn."
And just like good hosts, Brand Nubian
knows that a celebration can't end after one
jam. "Straight off Da Head," another early
track, is .1 laid-back and free-flowing banter
followed by a short comedy interlude. This
playful sentiment continues in "Nubian
jam," a feel-good, undertempo R&B track
in which Sadat X touts: "Brand Nubian —

the name alone stands/ Overseas fans be
shouting it in different accents." And just as
any good party has its well-known celebri
ties, "Alladat" features the explosive rapper
Busta Rhymes from The Leaders of the New
School. All of it makes for a festive occa
sion.
But as the clock strikes twelve on this
party, so does the mood of "Everything is
Everything." "Sweatin Bullets" and
"Claimin' I'm a Criminal" segue the lyrical
focus into ghetto violence and frustration.
The musical aspect takes a more serious turn
as well — once upbeat and funky instrumen
tal arrangements now shift into the macabre
and eerie. "l ick Pern Muthap@!?kas" uses a
muffled trumpet and slow, sinister beats to
form the underpinning for Lord Jamar's new
no-more-Mr.-Nice-Ciuy attitude: "So when
you see me coming — run."
Although Brand Nubian's more serious
side may alienate some, there is plenty else to
like about this ensemble. The veteran rap
ping skills and production by Lord )amar are
simply top-notch, displaying an ability to
create the cutting edge without losing touch
with the vintage Brand Nubian style.
