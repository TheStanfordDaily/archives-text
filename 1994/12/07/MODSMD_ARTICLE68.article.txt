"Letters Never Sent"
Carly Simon

An interesting story hides behind the title of
('arly Simon's latest album, "Letters Never
Sent." The lyrics and themes of all the songs
were inspired by actual letters written by the
Oscar-winning film-score composer herself
and hidden away in her closet, literally letters
never sent. The result of their compilation in
musical form is, in Simon's own words, "a
highly personal album. Her words could not
be more accurate, for the subject matter ranges
from childhood crushes to her mother's death.
I he unique structure of the album also re
flects a definite personal style, as it includes 10
primary songs interspersed with brief inter
ludes, all sandwiched between a guitar-violin
combo piece. Each song is quite different from
every other, contributing to an overall stream
of-consciousness effect such as that which
often characterizes written letters. Conse
quently, it seems that the only common thread
that weaves all the songs together is precisely
this lack of continuity.
Although the funky title track is not partic
ularly outstanding, it serves to explain where
the rest of the songs are derived. A well-placed
sax solo adds mood, but it dissolves any possi
bility of a thematic link to the song which fol
lows. "Lost m Your Love," with its odd blend of
Spanish and Moroccan flavor, sounds as if it
could have been generated by an entirely differ
ent artist.
"Like a River," written shortly after the
death of Simon's mother, trulv moves listeners

through its touching lyrics. It might even evoke
tears from one who knows the pain of such a
loss. However, the last stanza is sung by three
people, none of whom is Simon, in an operatic
style completely distinct from the melody and
tone of the rest of the song. Somehow, this fi
nale is so ill-fitting that is destroys the song's
original power as it only succeeds in catching
the listener off-guard and causing confusion.
The indistinguishable genre of the album
cannot correctly be called rock, but one rock
ballad, "Touched by the Sun," inspiringly ex
presses the importance of challenging oneself
to live life fully rather than to simply exist. The
hopeful tone of this piece provides a much
needed contrast to the moodiness of many ot
the other songs, lor example, "I'd Rather It
Was You" has an almost whiny quality, while
"Born To Break My Heart" — with lyrics like
"But here I am cursed, to seek love again/ From
yet another cold heart" — is downright bitter.
The only genuinely appealing song is
"Halfway 'Round the World," as it manages to
convey an upbeat sarcasm though its descrip
tion of a relationship wrought with animosity
and hints of the significant similarities between
love and hate.
A talented artist, Simon has a naturally
beautiful voice. Her crucial mistake lies in try
ing to musically capture the intrigue and mys
tery associated with her intensely personal
records. Unfortunately, the music distracts the
listener from the riveting lyrics to such a degree
that the album is ultimately more annoying
than pleasing to the ear. Still, after a week of lis
tening to the CI), it might actually grow on you
— assuming you could listen to it for a week
without going crazy.
