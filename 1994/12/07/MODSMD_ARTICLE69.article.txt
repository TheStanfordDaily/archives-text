"Out in LA."
Red Hot Chili Peppers

With the Red Hot Chili Peppers' latest re
lease, "Out In LA.," you get two albums for the
price of one.
In one corner, you have the raw and un
tamed Chili Peppers, a group of heady, young
Los Angeles boys with wild frontman Anthony
Kiedisat the helm. In the other corner, you have
the new-and-improved Chili Peppers, a mel
lower version of Kiedis and company, prepared
to offer you dance mixes of all their popular fa
vorites.
The result is neither sterling nor terribly dis
appointing. A potpourri of mixes, demos, live
tracks and unreleased material, "Out in LA."
will tune in the listener to the full essence of the

Red Hot Chili Peppers — the good, the bad,
and the ugly.
"Out In LA." chronicles the history of the
Chili Peppers, beginning with the days when
Kiedis, Flea and friends were starting to make a
name for themselves in the L.A. scene under the
name of Tony Flow and the Miraculously Ma
jestic Masters of Mayhem. Six demo versions of
songs originally appearing on the albums, "The
Red Hot Chili Peppers" and "Freaky Styley"
highlight the hyper, high-wired days of the
band.
The greatest contrast between the old and
the new is Kiedis. The demos here are com
pletely devoid of actual singing; instead, these
short songs feature Kiedis engaging in staccato
rap, ranting off incomprehensible lyrics at a
speedy clip.
All the demos bear a striking resemblance to
one another. Still, "Green Heaven," a track that
appeared on the Red Hot Chili Peppers' first

album, captures the quintessential flavor of the
early Pepper days with a twisted opening and
an even-paced, bouncing backbeat comple
menting Kiedis in rare, sedated form.
The first four tracks on "Out In LA." show
case a completely different side of the Red 1 lot
Cluli Peppers. Classics such as "Hollywood,"
sound like Anthony Kiedis and friends meet
Miami Sound Machine. "If You Want Me To
Stay," employs a lon Secada-esque rhythm
throughout its seven-minute playing time,
making it a definite throwaway. Still, those who
enjoy the original versions of"! ligherC i round"
and "Behind The Sun" shouldn't fret. The
songs may get a bit long-winded, but are not
mined by their souped-up, remixed counter
parts.
"Out m LA.'s" most refreshing moments are
provided by the three live tracks sandwiched
between the mayhem. Although clearly not as
good as the Jimi Hendrix original, the Chili

Peppers' cover of "(Castles Made of Sand"
strikes a delicate balance between instruments
and vocals and flows at a steady, allegro pace. A
short interlude of a sampled Thelonious Monk
tune, entitled "F.U." captures the Chili Peppers'
crudeness without pretensions.
Unfortunately, the last track on the album,
"Deck The Halls" attempts to be overly face
tious. Originally billed as "a funkafied rendi
tion of the traditional Christmas carol," this
song is a one-minute, unpolished ditty featur
ing four bad vocalists bumbling through verses
such as "something, something, Yuletide
carol." Don't plan on roasting chestnuts with
this song playing in the background.
Granted, listeners will probably not enjoy all
19 tracks on "Out In LA." You may not even
enjoy half of them. Still, the album offers a rare
glimpse of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, brash as
they were and always will be.
