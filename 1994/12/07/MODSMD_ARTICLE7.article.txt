## Superior Court reduces charge to misdemeanor

Liberation" sculpture was reduced
from a felony to a misdemeanor at
his sentencing hearing yesterday.
Santa Clara County Superior
Court Judge Diane Northway re
duced Laßocca's sentence to one
year of probation and ordered him
to pay $1,700 in fines, attend edu

lifestyles" and complete 100 hours
each of community service and
graffiti clean-up.

been advised at his preliminary

hearing about what his sentence

with Laßocca's probation report

charge be reduced to a misde
meanor.

gained tremendous insight making
him a more sensitive person. ... J
believe it is appropriate to reduce
the sentence," Northway said.
