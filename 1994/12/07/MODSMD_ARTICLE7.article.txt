## Superior Court reduces charge to misdemeanor 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
Due partly to a favorable proba
tion report, the charge against for
mer Stanford student Todd Laßoc
ca for the vandalism of the "Gay
Liberation" sculpture was reduced
from a felony to a misdemeanor at
his sentencing hearing yesterday.
Santa Clara County Superior
Court Judge Diane Northway re
duced Laßocca's sentence to one
year of probation and ordered him
to pay $1,700 in fines, attend edu
cational classes on "alternative
lifestyles" and complete 100 hours
each of community service and
graffiti clean-up.
Because Laßocca had already
been advised at his preliminary

hearing about what his sentence
would likely entail, he had already
fulfilled all of these requirements,
except for his probation, which
began yesterday.
With this in mind — and be
cause she was "very impressed"
with Laßocca's probation report
— Northway ruled that the felony
charge be reduced to a misde
meanor.
"Mr. Laßocca has changed, and
gained tremendous insight making
him a more sensitive person. ... J
believe it is appropriate to reduce
the sentence," Northway said.
Out of the eight students ar
rested for pouring black paint on
and wedging a park bench in the
George Segal sculpture last May,
Laßocca and senior Thomas
Irwin were the only two students
charged with felonies in the case.
Four others were charged with
misdemeanors, and two were exon
erated.
Laßocca pled "no contest" to
charges of felony vandalism at his
preliminary hearing on Sept. 29.
Northway said she was especial
ly convinced by the commenda
tions Laßocca received from San
Jose State University Sociology
Prof. Wiggsy Sivertsen, who teach
es a class on homosexuality that
Laßocca has been attending as part
of the court's requirements.
In her letter to the judge, Sivert
sen said, "There is no question that
his actions hurt a number of people
in my community." But she went
on to say that "Todd has been will
ing to look at his behavior and feels
totally contrite about his actions
... I know the lesbian and gay com
munity have gained a friend and
life-time supporter."
Before the sentence was passed,
however, District Attorney
Breyer said he was "opposed to the
request" to reduce the crime to a
misdemeanor because of the "seri
ous nature of the crime." He urged
the court to maintain the offense as
a felony.
"A case of this degree of serious
ness should be treated as a felony,
but I can understand why the judge
made the ruling," Breyer said afler
the ruling, adding that he respect
ed Sivertsen's opinion highly.
"Our office felt it should remain
as a felony... . However, the judge
was persuaded that was not neces
sary — partly from a persuasive
letter [from Sivertsen]," he said.
Speaking nervously before the
sentence was passed, Laßocca said
he was "really regretful and
remorseful about the incident" and
has since developed "friendships in
their (the gay and lesbian) commu
nity."
"I am relieved the judicial pro
cess has come to a close and I would
like to express my deep regrets to
the entire Stanford community,"
he said in a statement alter the
hearing. "I personally learned a
great deal from the experience and
hope the Stanford community at
large has increased its awareness of
the issues brought forth by the
incident."

Defense attorney Anthony
Giacalone said he had requested
the sentence be reduced to a misde
meanor on the grounds that
Laßocca had gone to every extent
to rectify any hurt to Stanford's
gay and lesbian community,
including meeting with them ii
June.
"He felt that what he did was
reprehensible and he wanted to
make amends," Giacalone said.
Laßocca chose to fulfill his pro
bation requirements before sen
tencing because he was "anxious to
start making amends as soon as
possible," he explained.
"Todd was less interested in
what would happen to him and
more concerned about the people
he had hurt," Giacalone said. "I
think that came through and the
court was impressed."
In an interview yesterday,
Sivertsen said she hopes Stanford's
lesbian and gay community will
forgive Laßocca for his actions. *
"He got tanked up with booze
and got out of line. I think he real
izes that and understands what he
did wrong," she said, adding that
she hopes the other students
involved in the incident have
learned as much as Laßocca has.
"This is to me what hate crimes
are about — egging each other on
and not caring about the conse
quences. Todd realizes now that
this type of behavior is unaccept
able," she said.
Breyer said he doesn't think the
court's decision to reduce Laßoc
ca's sentence will affect Irwin's
case, because the ruling was based
on Laßocca's probation reports
and "does not address the state of
mind or the attitudes of the other
young men." Irwin's next prelimi
nary hearing is scheduled for Dec.
13.
The remaining four students —
senior Mark Butterfield, junior
Robert Gardner, junior Jason
White and former student Brian
Dallimore — were sentenced on
Sept. 23 to one year of court proba
tion. They were also ordered to
comply with monetary and com
munity service penalties already
imposed by Stanford, and to either
perform an additional 50 hours of
community service or to attend a
course on tolerance of alternative
lifestyles.
District Attorney Valerie
Marchant, the prosecutor who usu
ally heads the case, was absent
today due to involvement in anoth
er case.
