"Shared Vision: The Songs of the Beatles"
represents yet another marketing scheme in
which great tunes originally sung by the Beat
les are transformed into pitiful remakes. The
singers who contributed to "Shared Vision"
don't appear to have shared any vision at all.
The result is a jumble of songs in which the
artists strive only to outdo each other by high
lighting their own style.
One of the reasons "Shared Vision" fails as
an album is because the musical styles of its
artists are too diverse. The album contains
songs by artists such as Extreme, P.M. Dawn,
Robert Palmer and kathy Mattea.
In addition, the songs were often altered so
much from their original versions that they
were hardly recognizable. Especially disap
pointing is Salt 'N' Pepa's rap rendition of

low, however, when the singers broke into con

Rod Stewart's version of "Clet Back" was also
a letdown. It begins with a strange tribute to
"My Country "l is of Thee" and then proceeds
to resemble a classic '70s disco song. Stewart
shrieks his way through the song, adding an oc

its abrupt shift to a banjo and piano duet remi

of classic rock that everyone should listen to.
Also of interest is Richie 1 lavens' folk-rock ver

"Starlite Walker"

Arnold Schwarzenegger pregnant — knowing the
film's controlling concept, is it really worth it to go to
the theater and see "Junior"? Surprisingly, the answer
is yes.
Schwarzenegger plays I )r. Alex 11 esse, a fertility re
searcher who has invented a new drug which will help
to curb infertility and miscarriage. The drug does not
have I I )A approval for human testing, so Dr. Hesse,
along with his partner, Dr. Larry Arbogast (Danny
I )eVito), decides to secretly test the drug on himself.
Using his own sperm, and a stolen egg from the pro
ject of Dr. Diana Redd in (Emma Thompson), Arnold
is impregnated. The rest of the movie follows the
course of Arnold's impending "maternity," and the
physical and emotional changes that he goes through.
The movie works because it deals with the emo
tional growth of Dr. Hesse from a sheltered scientist to
a loving father. In the course of his pregnancy, Alex
goes through morning sickness, mood swings and
hormonal changes. Arnold allows the film to make
fun of his masculine image, placing him in the most
feminine of roles — pregnancy, that is. Instead of just
using the sight gag of Arnold in drag when he goes to
a spa for expectant mothers, he is depicted explaining

"Law of the Jungle" is the first U.S. release of
what the U.K. boasts as its first exclusively black
style. Originally only played on London's pirate
radio stations, lungle has made its way into the
U.K. mainstream and threatens to enter the U.S.
The music is marked by banging, synthesized
rhythm patterns and sped-up back-beats which
change mid-song into hard core vocals, reggae,
regga, soul, jazz and emcee chatter. The most
successful track, Shy FX and U.K. Apache's
"()nginal Nutta," went top-40 in U.K. with high
ly addictive vocals and pounding back-beats.
Although in the U.K., fans of both techno
and reggae embrace this style, this may not be
the case in the U.S. It is the background beats

In the past, Silver lews' recordings have
come highly recommended, though always
with a hint of caution. While their releases have
contained consistently appealing music, the
production quality has been so poor that only
the most dedicated and tolerant listeners have
been able to enjoy them.
While many fans consider this "homemade"
sound (their previous release was recorded in a
living room) to be an essential part of the Silver
lews' charm, others will be glad to hear that for
their new album, the band has gone into the
studio and used better equipment.
The result is "Starlite Walker," a downright
clean collection of songs which blend the com
fortably loose rock of Pavement with an intelli
gently-soothing, Southern feel.
The Pavement comparison should come as
no surprise as the Silver Jews are, basically,
Pavement, minus a few members and with a

and basic bass lines that provide the rhythms
for dancing. This combination creates a totally
different, experimental sound which may not
lie accepted by lovers of pure reggae since the
distinctive background style of reggae is re
placed by hanging drums. Devotees of the
London underground style will find this sound
very familiar with the drum rhythms overlayed
by reggae, soul and jazz vocals. This dance style
marks Britain's first with exclusively black roots.

different singer. But fans should not expect
"Starlite Walker" to be another Pavement
album. Pavement frontman Steve Malkmus is
primarily a guitarist for the Silver Jews, leaving
the lead vocals and songwriting to Dave
Berman, who lends the album his own distinct
brand of wisdom and blues.
From the tender distress of "New Orleans"
to the more upbeat "Living Waters," Berman
constructs moods that are pleasantly complex,
provoking an ambiguous yet convincing emo
tional effect.
"Advice to the Graduate" is a beautifully
disappointed Berman classic, as it ponders op
timism in a time of hopelessness. With delicate
sarcasm, Malkmus delivers the chorus: "Oh, I
know you got a lot of hope tor the new men."
The 11 songs on "Starlite Walker" explore
an intriguing variety of moods, styles and sub
jects, yet they maintain a satisfying cohesive
ness as the band's casually intimate character
personalizes every song.
The Silver Jews have assembled another
batch of humble rock gems, and this time, with

Schwarzenegger is good in this role, but lacks the

or "Twins," which were also directed by Ivan Reitman.
DcVito plays a stereotypical slimeball with a heart.
While he does deliver laughs in his role, he has little to
work with since Schwarzenegger gets most oi the

Kmma Thompson shows that she is capable of
slapstick humor in a departure from her more serious
roles of late. Even though you wouldn't expect her to
play klutzy scientist Reddin who falls for
Schwarzenegger, Thompson is winning in her por
trayal. When Reddin tries to make a dramatic en
trance at a pharmaceutical convention, she only man
ages to knock a plate out of a waiter's hand — seeing
the same actress who played the very proper Margaret
Schlegel of "Howard's End" try to get toilet paper off
her shoe while dancing makes the convention se
quence all the more funny.
The concept of a pregnant man is interesting, but
not necessarily one that can hold the attention of the
audience by itself for two hours. But in the case of "Ju

enough to help Schwarzenegger deliver.

"Shared Vision: The Songs of the Beatles"
represents yet another marketing scheme in
which great tunes originally sung by the Beat

singers who contributed to "Shared Vision"
don't appear to have shared any vision at all.
The result is a jumble of songs in which the
artists strive only to outdo each other by high

One of the reasons "Shared Vision" fails as
an album is because the musical styles of its
artists are too diverse. The album contains
songs by artists such as Extreme, P.M. Dawn,
Robert Palmer and kathy Mattea.
In addition, the songs were often altered so

Arnold Schwarzenegger pregnant — knowing the
film's controlling concept, is it really worth it to go to
the theater and see "Junior"? Surprisingly, the answer
is yes.
Schwarzenegger plays I )r. Alex 11 esse, a fertility re
searcher who has invented a new drug which will help
to curb infertility and miscarriage. The drug does not
have I I )A approval for human testing, so Dr. Hesse,
along with his partner, Dr. Larry Arbogast (Danny
I )eVito), decides to secretly test the drug on himself.
Using his own sperm, and a stolen egg from the pro
ject of Dr. Diana Redd in (Emma Thompson), Arnold
is impregnated. The rest of the movie follows the
course of Arnold's impending "maternity," and the
physical and emotional changes that he goes through.
The movie works because it deals with the emo
tional growth of Dr. Hesse from a sheltered scientist to
a loving father. In the course of his pregnancy, Alex
goes through morning sickness, mood swings and
hormonal changes. Arnold allows the film to make
fun of his masculine image, placing him in the most
feminine of roles — pregnancy, that is. Instead of just
using the sight gag of Arnold in drag when he goes to
a spa for expectant mothers, he is depicted explaining

"Law of the Jungle" is the first U.S. release of
what the U.K. boasts as its first exclusively black
style. Originally only played on London's pirate
radio stations, lungle has made its way into the
U.K. mainstream and threatens to enter the U.S.
The music is marked by banging, synthesized
rhythm patterns and sped-up back-beats which
change mid-song into hard core vocals, reggae,
regga, soul, jazz and emcee chatter. The most
successful track, Shy FX and U.K. Apache's
"()nginal Nutta," went top-40 in U.K. with high
ly addictive vocals and pounding back-beats.
Although in the U.K., fans of both techno
and reggae embrace this style, this may not be
the case in the U.S. It is the background beats

In the past, Silver lews' recordings have
come highly recommended, though always
with a hint of caution. While their releases have
contained consistently appealing music, the
production quality has been so poor that only
the most dedicated and tolerant listeners have
been able to enjoy them.
While many fans consider this "homemade"
sound (their previous release was recorded in a
living room) to be an essential part of the Silver
lews' charm, others will be glad to hear that for
their new album, the band has gone into the
studio and used better equipment.
The result is "Starlite Walker," a downright
clean collection of songs which blend the com
fortably loose rock of Pavement with an intelli
gently-soothing, Southern feel.
The Pavement comparison should come as
no surprise as the Silver Jews are, basically,
Pavement, minus a few members and with a

very familiar with the drum rhythms overlayed
by reggae, soul and jazz vocals. This dance style
marks Britain's first with exclusively black roots.
