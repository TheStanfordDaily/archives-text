Focus on:

The Oasis If you're on-the
prowl and looking for cheap place
to hang out, eat, socialize and
scope, this is the place for you. The
Oasis is probably the closest that
Palo Alto ever gets to seedy, but the
atmosphere is great and the beer
selection is extensive. If you're out
to avoid pcach stucco and musak,
The Oasis might be a good choice.

Watch out if you're
under 21, as you will be
relegated to the out
door patio. Food here is
quite inexpensive, as
most of it is from the
pizza and burger food
group. Located at 241
El Camino Real, Menlo
Park, The Oasis is open
seven days a week from
11 a.m. to 2 a.m. 326-
8896.
Rudy's Plush yet
dank, Rudy's offers an
ecletic crowd and a
good selection of beers
on tap. If you're out for

the pick-up scene, you've come to
the wrong place. Rudy's attracts a
crowd that tends to chat within
their own groups and smoke lots of
cigarettes. This is also a pretty good
place to play darts without a crowd
to bother you. There's pretty much
no food offered at Rudy's, which is
okay considering drinks tend to be
relatively expensive. Located at the

intersection of University Ave. and
Alma St.in Palo Alto, Rudy's is
open from Sat to Mon. from 4
p.m. to 1:15 a.m. and Tues.
through Fri. from 2 p.m. to 1:15
a.m. 321-6161.
Mlyake Where else can you do
multiple sake bombs within
Greater Palo Alto area? Miyake of
fers that unique and supportive en
vironment, complete with waiters
who are ready to sake bomb along
with you. The countdown in
Japanese is sketchy at best, but such
are the sacrifices that must be
made. Miyake tends to be pretty in
expensive all around, even if you're
going for sushi instead. Most sushi
meals cost about $8, and sake
bombs run about $7 each. Miyake
is pleasantly located at 261 Univer
sity Ave., and is open daily 11:30
a.m. to 10 p.m. 323-9449.
Gordon Biersch Brewing
Company Ooh, the smell of
freshly brewed beer in the air. Yep,
this cafe and bar is extremely pop

ular on weekends, and the reason
is clear as you encounter the fresh
beer and classy ambiance. This
place is frequented by the young
professionals who are looking to
mingle. The fare here is a combi
nation of typical beer hall and Cal
ifornia cuisine, but your best bet is
to stick with the burgers and fries.
Definitely upscale from the usual
beer hall, Gordon Biersch will
probably cost you $6 to $12 for a
meal. Located 640 Emerson St.in
Palo Alto, Gordon Biersch Brew
ing Company is open Sun.
through Thurs. from 11 a.m. to 10
p.m., Fri. and Sat. 11 a.m. to 11
p.m. The bar is open even later.
323-7723.
O'Connell's Hearty is the word
that comes to mind when ponder
ing both the eating and the drink
ing at O'Connell's. This Irish-style
pub is chock full of good beers on
tap and a selection of alcohol that
is sure to please most Anglophiles.
This bar and restaurant features a
graphic meat counter and an ap

pealing open atmosphere, made
even more appealing by live Irish
folk music on weekends. O'Con
nell's has drinks and food that are
moderately priced and definitively
filling. This bar and restaurant is
located at 518 Bryant St in Palo
Alto, and is open Thurs. through
Mon. from 10 a.m. to 1:30 a.m.,
and I\ies. and Wed. from 10 a.m.
to 1 a.m. 326-2000.
Blue Chalk Cafe If you're 21
and you aren't fortunate enough to
live in a place with a pool table, be
sure to check out Blue Chalk Cafe.
They're pretty strict in carding at
the door after 10 p.m., so if you
don't have a "real" ID, don't even
try. The atmosphere is yuppie and
the crowds can get out of control
sometimes, but if you want to play
pool, there aren't many options in
Palo Alto. The food and drinks
here are good, but the price tag is
definitely Palo Alto. Blue Chalk
Cafe is located at 630 Ramona St.
in Palo Alto, and is open daily
11:30 a.m. to 1 a.m. 326-1020.

Mlyake Where else can you do
multiple sake bombs within
Greater Palo Alto area? Miyake of
fers that unique and supportive en
vironment, complete with waiters
who are ready to sake bomb along
with you. The countdown in
Japanese is sketchy at best, but such
are the sacrifices that must be
made. Miyake tends to be pretty in
expensive all around, even if you're
going for sushi instead. Most sushi
meals cost about $8, and sake
bombs run about $7 each. Miyake
is pleasantly located at 261 Univer
sity Ave., and is open daily 11:30
a.m. to 10 p.m. 323-9449.

meal. Located 640 Emerson St.in

Blue Chalk Cafe If you're 21
and you aren't fortunate enough to
live in a place with a pool table, be
sure to check out Blue Chalk Cafe.
They're pretty strict in carding at
the door after 10 p.m., so if you
don't have a "real" ID, don't even
try. The atmosphere is yuppie and
the crowds can get out of control
sometimes, but if you want to play
pool, there aren't many options in
Palo Alto. The food and drinks
here are good, but the price tag is
definitely Palo Alto. Blue Chalk
Cafe is located at 630 Ramona St.
in Palo Alto, and is open daily
11:30 a.m. to 1 a.m. 326-1020.
