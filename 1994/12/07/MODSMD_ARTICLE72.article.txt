Clerks
In the no-budget, guerrilla-indepen
dent tradition of "She's Gotta Have
It"and the more recent "El Mariachi,"
Kevin Smith's "Clerks" hands out an
other slap in the face to studio exec
utives who prefer the convenience of
judging talent by its price tag.
Made for less money than the cater
ing bill for most major Hollywood

productions — $27,575 to be exact
— this black-and-white-shot venture
looks cheap, talks fast and plays
tough. Vile, remorseless and engag
ing, "Clerks" is quite simply the
most audacious American comedy
to hit the screen this year.
Frankenstein
"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" is di
rector Kenneth Branagh's recent
monster creation. Branagh, the bril
liant director and thespian of "Henry
V" and "Much Ado About Nothing,"
brings yet another literary classic
alive on the silver screen. Branagh's
direction is stellar and electric. He
captures immense energy in his
film, using just the right combination
of special effects and melodrama.
"Frankenstein" is a Gothic tale of
blood, gore and romance, guaran
teed "to curdle the blood and quick
en the beatings of the heart."
Branagh himself stars in the lead
role of Victor Frankenstein, the intel
ligent yet slightly off-kilter scientist,
who experiments with electricity and
amniotic fluid to create a monster.
Heavenly Creatures
In 1954, New Zealand's infamous ma
tricide case shocked an entire nation.
Director Peter Jackson has decided
that it is time to reopen closets and let
the skeletons run free, addressing the

controversial real-life matricide case
of two adolescent girlfriends / lovers.
Regrettably though, Jackson also
loses control in the process.
More troubling is Jackson's uncritical
take on Pauline's apparent scorn for
her family's working-class vulgarity
and identification with the Hulmes'
gracious refinement. "Heavenly Crea
tures" mostly fascinates as a fairy tale
turned sour — social credibility is all
but relegated to a paltry afterthought.
Interview with a Vampire
Tom Cruise wanted to be taken seri
ously. Neil Jordan wanted to prove
he could compete on Hollywood's
home ground. Anne Rice wanted to
confound all involved by first pub
licly disowning the project, then
heartily endorsing it.
A case of too many personal egos at
stake and too little substance to hold
them together — "Interview With the
Vampire" ends up constipated on a
diet rich in pyrotechnical novelty, but
painfully lacking an emotional center.
Oleanna
"Oleanna," directed and written by
David Mamet, is a screen adaptation
of the play which has caused con
troversy since its opening in 1992.
The movie, starring William H. Macy
as the professor, John, and Debra

Eisenstadt as the student, Carol, is
exceedingly loyal to the theatrical
version. John and Carol are the only
two characters with speaking roles,
and the changes between scenes
and acts are clearly delineated with
brief fillers (such as scenes of stu
dents walking down halls).
"Oleanna" is not an easy movie to
watch or think about. There is no
hero, no whirlwind plot. Yet, one be
comes fully engaged in the intrica
cies of the movie. "Oleanna" pos
sesses subtlety and assumes the in
telligence of its viewer. It forces the
viewer to make difficult judgments
about the characters and the issues
it raises. "Oleanna" is notorious for
leaving its viewers arguing about the
abstract concepts it embraces.
Pulp Fiction
It's good.
See it.
Road to Wellville
The sad thing is that I love movies. I
can't think of a single movie I've
hated. But as I sat through "The
Road to Wellville" last week, the
only thing that kept me from walk
ing out of the theater was my job.
The film, directed by Alan Parker, has
an absurd non-plot centered around
creator-of-the-cornflake John Kellogg

(played by Anthony Hopkins) and a
controversial health spa he developed
around the turn of the century. The pri
mary teaching at the Battlecreek Sani
tarium is that you can live forever by
taking good care of your digestive
track. This produces two hours worth
of defecation jokes, like the sign hang
ing in the spa's dining hall which
reads, "Clean bowels make for clean
thoughts." Though this course of
humor is plenty nauseating, its real of
fense is that it just isn't funny. At all.
Star Trek: Generations
As the latest in a series of seven
trekkie flicks, "Generations" unites
three original-cast old timers with the
new crew from the T.V. series, "Star
Trek: The Next Generation." This
time retired Capt. James Kirk (William
Shatner) and now-Capt. Jean-Luc Pi
card (Patrick Stewart) must join
forces and battle mano-a-mano with
Dr. Tolian Soran (Malcolm McDow
ell), a talented scientist gone bad.
Stunning graphics and killer action
sequences liven the silver screen,
titillating the audience to levels
reached by the best adventure
flicks. The Enterprise's wicked crash
landing alone is reason enough to
check out "Star Trek: Generations."
Even the stellar cartography room
sustains viewer interest, thanks to 3-
D computer graphics.
