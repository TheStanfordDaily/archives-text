# Board talks of few issues, hits Stanford Fund

### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
After two days of listening to reports and
updates, the Board of Trustees concluded its
meeting yesterday without taking action on
any issues of "major concern," said board chair
John Freidenrich.
One of the many reports — whose topics
ranged from the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education to the recent resignation of
head football coach Bill Walsh — centered on
student protest over the controversial Stan
ford Fund, a new alumni-giving policy which
went into effect Sept. 1.
Approved by the trustees in February in an
attempt to centralize the University's fund
raising efforts, the policy was designed to min
imize alumni solicitation from student organi
zations by placing donations to student groups
in a central fund to be administered by the
University president and provost.
Student organizations were temporarily
released from the policy two weeks ago, how
ever, after several groups spoke out against it,
protesting that it would give the University
too much control over their budgets.
