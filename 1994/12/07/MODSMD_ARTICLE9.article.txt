# Board talks of few issues, hits Stanford Fund
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
After two days of listening to reports and
updates, the Board of Trustees concluded its
meeting yesterday without taking action on
any issues of "major concern," said board chair
John Freidenrich.
One of the many reports — whose topics
ranged from the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education to the recent resignation of
head football coach Bill Walsh — centered on
student protest over the controversial Stan
ford Fund, a new alumni-giving policy which
went into effect Sept. 1.
Approved by the trustees in February in an
attempt to centralize the University's fund
raising efforts, the policy was designed to min
imize alumni solicitation from student organi
zations by placing donations to student groups
in a central fund to be administered by the
University president and provost.
Student organizations were temporarily
released from the policy two weeks ago, how
ever, after several groups spoke out against it,
protesting that it would give the University
too much control over their budgets.
Administrators also appointed a
review committee made up of stu
dent leaders and administrators to
examine the policy's impact on stu
dent organizations. The committee
is expected to complete its review
by mid-February.
Freidenrich said the trustees
were confident that student con

cerns about the Stanford Fund will
be resolved.
"The administration has met
with students," he said. "I think
that the situation will be worked
out."
In addition to yesterday's meet
ing, the Board of Trustees' eight
standing committees convened on
Monday.
The Committee on Academic
Policy, Planning and Management
heard a report about the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Educa

tion's progress, said senior Anietie
Ekanem, a student member of the
committee.
In a joint session of three com
mittees, Development Office repre
sentatives presented the prelimi
naiy results of the Alumni-Giving
Survey, which will be released offi
cially next week, said John Ford,
vice president for development.
About a year ago, the Develop
ment Office began a "thoughtful
assessment of the factors influenc
ing alumni giving," said Stephen

Peeps, associate vice president for
the Development Office.
The office sent a survey to alum
ni asking about a wide variety of
topics, including their satisfaction
with their education, their impres
sions of Stanford since graduation
and their sources of information
about the University, Ford said.
Peeps said Monday's discussion
was about "the broad issue of
alumni giving," and "was not about
the current issue of the Stanford
Fund policy."
