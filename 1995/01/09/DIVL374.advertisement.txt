Consider a Linguistics Course this Winter!
Linguistics tries to understand the miracle oflanguagc. Why can a child
of four, who can't even add six and eight, still perform extraordinarily
complex operations in spcech that the most sophisticated computers
can't? Why is it that all human languages have certain structural
properties in common? What role does language play in differentiating
people by social class, ethnicity, and sex? What are the systematic
differences between dialects and other dialects and
other varieties of a language?
Here are some reasons why students find linguistics exciting:
•Students in introductory courses can be trained to do
original research
•The data for linguistic investigation is all around you in daily life: in
cafeterias and restaurants, on TV, in party conversations, etc.
•Linguistics courses are intellectually stimulating and FUN
