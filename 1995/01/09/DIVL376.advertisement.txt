The Design of Interactive Devices
In this two-quarter course students working in small, interdisciplinary teams will
observe and analyze people in work or play situations and then design physical
objects whose functionality is significantly determined by their embedded software.
Each group will develop a prototype to be submitted to an international design
competition sponsored by Apple Computer.
Course material will focus on computer interfaces, interaction, and design asthetics
as well as some of the underpinnings of successful design: a reflective, iterative
design process, group dynamics of effective multidisciplinary teamwork, and
working with users.
Students from Computer Science, the Design Division, the Social Sciences, and the
professional schools, including Business, Medicine and Education, are encouraged
to join the class.
TTh 4:15-5:30 Green Earth Sciences Bldg.
room 134
Pre-requisites: Because the course is based on multi-disciplinary teams students
should have depth of knowledge in one of the relevant disciplines but there is no
general pre-requisite. Enrollment will be limited and priority will be given to those
who won't be able to take the course in the future and by needs to balance the
teams.
Faculty: Terry Winograd (CS), David Kelly (ME), Brad Hartfield
