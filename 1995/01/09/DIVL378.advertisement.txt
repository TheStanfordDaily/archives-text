This seminar course, limited to about 25 advanced undergraduates, will examine the scientific and
policy considerations underlying the regulation of chronic, low-level risks to the environment and public
health. Among the topics considered in lectures: epidemiological evaluation; exposure assessment
toxicology testing and extrapolation from animal studies; the statues governing regulation; setting
regulatory priorities; managing risks.
Students will be expected to pursue an independent case study on some particular issue, e.g. asbestos
in buildings, EMF, lead, chlorination of drinking water supplies, nuclear waste, food additives, etc.
The course will be offered on Tuesdays and Thursdays, 3:15-4:30 in Herrin T-l 85. A scientific
background equivalent to completion of the Biology core is ordinarily required, but some exceptions
may be made for students with extensive experience in another relevant field, e.g. Economics, Public
Policy. Eligibility will be considered on a case-by-case basis; students who are doubtful or have
particular questions may contact Kennedy at 5-2745 or by E-Mail (HK.DXK@forsythe.stanford.edu). Or
just show up for the first meeting!
