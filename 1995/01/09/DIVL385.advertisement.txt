D. E. Shaw & Co. is not located on Wall Street. We're a small (around

advanced quantitative techniques to the securities business. We hire
only the best, and are prepared to compensate exceptionally gifted
individuals at a level exceeding that of the market. Financial experi
ence is not required. And we don't wear suits and ties.
We'll be recruiting at the Stanford Park Hotel on February 9, 1995.

accountant - or if you're not sure what you want to be, but think you
might enjoy a rather unorthodox Wall Street career - let us hear from
