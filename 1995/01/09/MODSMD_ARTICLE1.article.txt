# Willingham takes reins
## 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
For Tyrone Willingham, Christmas came early.
Named Stanford's new head football coach on Dec.
9 by Athletic Director Ted Leland, Willingham as
sumes the reins of the football program after three
turbulent years under Bill Walsh, who resigned Nov.
28.
Before coming to Stanford, Willingham was work
ing under former Cardinal coach Denny Green at
Minnesota as the running backs coach. He held a sim
ilar position under Green at Stanford from 1989-91.
"When the position became available, Tyrone was
a person I contacted immediately," said Leland.

"After conducting a national search and speaking to
many people about the needs of the Stanford football
program, it became very apparent to me and others
that Tyrone was the man to lead our program."
Despite never having held a coordinator or head
coaching position, Willingham, 41, was given a five
year contract.
"It had little to do with his resume," Leland said.
"It had more to do with the eight months I worked
with Tyrone. I became convinced at that time that if
I could work with Tyrone again, I would do it.
"All you have to do is look at him for 10 minutes
working with a student athlete and you'll know why
he's our selection."


Tyrone Willingham
Willingham, a 1977 graduate
of Michigan State University,
has coached at Michigan State,
Central Michigan, North Car
olina State and Rice Universi
ty. At these various stops, he
has coached both offensive and
defensive positions.
While at Stanford, he helped
develop two of the Cardinal's
top running backs in the histo
ry of the school. Tommy
Vardell set school records for
yards (1,084) and touchdowns
(20) in 1991 and Glyn Milburn
set a school record for all-pur
pose running in 1990 with
2,222 yards. Vardell currently
plays for the Cleveland Browns
and Milburn is with the Denver
Broncos.
"[WillinghamJ has a stan
dard of perfection that he sets
for himself and his players and
he doesn't allow either to
waver," Vardell said. "The
standard has to do with effort
and principle, and I think those
are the two factors that Stan
ford needs to win."
Willingham is one of the
first coaches from the second
generation of Bill Walsh prodi
gies. Whereas Green learned
under the tutelage of Walsh,
Willingham traces much of
what he learned to Green, both
with the Cardinal and with the
Vikings.
Described as energetic and a
disciplinarian, Willingham said
he looks for a strong work ethic
to be the mark of his Stanford
teams.
Responding to the question
concerning the rift between the
older and younger athletes on
this year's team, Willingham

replied in what is his trade
mark no-nonsense manner.
"My approach is simple," he
said. "As I understand it,
there's one head coach. Second
of all, the players are listed as
Stanford student-athletes.
That means there's one team."
Unable to be anything much
more than an advisor for the
Stanford program until the
Vikings were eliminated from
the playoffs by the Chicago
Bears, Willingham has now
taken an active hand in mold
ing his staff. He named Dana
Bible offensive coordinator two
weeks ago and has assembled
four other assistants. Bible was
offensive coordinator and quar
terbacks coach at the Universi
ty of Cincinnati in 1994.
Mike Wilson and Dave Tip
ton, coaches under Bill Walsh
for the past three years, have
been retained. Wilson remains
the wide receivers coach and
Tipton will move from defen
sive line to inside linebackers,
the position he held under
Green from 1989-91.
Don Treadwell, formerly the
wide receivers coach for the
Bearcats along with Bible, will
coach the running backs.
Meanwhile Pat Morris will
coach the offensive line and
tight ends. Previously, Morris
was offensive line coach at
Michigan State since 1987.
As for Walsh, his name con
tinues to be passed around the
NFL circles as a possible choice
for general manager or consul
tant for the Seattle Seahawks.
Walsh has said he would prefer
to run the team from his home
in California rather than move
to the Pacific Northwest. How
ever, University of Miami head
coach Dennis Erickson appears
to be the Seahawks' first
choice.
