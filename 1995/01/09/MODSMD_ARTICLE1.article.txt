# Willingham takes reins
## 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
For Tyrone Willingham, Christmas came early.
Named Stanford's new head football coach on Dec.
9 by Athletic Director Ted Leland, Willingham as
sumes the reins of the football program after three
turbulent years under Bill Walsh, who resigned Nov.
28.
Before coming to Stanford, Willingham was work
ing under former Cardinal coach Denny Green at
Minnesota as the running backs coach. He held a sim
ilar position under Green at Stanford from 1989-91.
"When the position became available, Tyrone was
a person I contacted immediately," said Leland.

"After conducting a national search and speaking to
many people about the needs of the Stanford football
program, it became very apparent to me and others
that Tyrone was the man to lead our program."
Despite never having held a coordinator or head
coaching position, Willingham, 41, was given a five
year contract.
"It had little to do with his resume," Leland said.
"It had more to do with the eight months I worked
with Tyrone. I became convinced at that time that if
I could work with Tyrone again, I would do it.
"All you have to do is look at him for 10 minutes
working with a student athlete and you'll know why
he's our selection."
