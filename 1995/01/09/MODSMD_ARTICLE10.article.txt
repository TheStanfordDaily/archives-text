Democrats want facts
WASHINGTON (AP) - Dem
ocrats, saying all they've heard so
far is "fairy-tale economics," chal
lenged the Republicans yesterday to
produce hard facts on how they are
going to balance the budget in seven
years.
"They're flipping around like fish
on a deck right now, not willing to
be specific with regard to how
they're going to do it," said Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-
S.D.
Republicans countered that
Democrats were trying to obstruct
passage of a constitutional amend
ment to balance the budget by 2002.
"That's trolling with red herring,

and I ain't taking the bait," said
House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas, appearing with Daschle on
NBC's "Meet the Press."
'Publicity attempt' for OJ.
LOS ANGELES (AP) - O.J. Simp
son's upcoming book probably won't
contain any startling revelations and
may be just an attempt to gain good
publicity and much-needed cash, legal
analysts said yesterday.
"I can't believe defense lawyers
didn't go over this with a fine-toothed
comb to find out if there's anything
that could hurt them," said Loyola
University law professor Stanley Gold
man. "If there is, they would have cut
it out."
