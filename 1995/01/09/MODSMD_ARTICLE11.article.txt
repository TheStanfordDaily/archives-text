# Russian forces pound Chechnya
## Rocket and mortar fire aimed at capital to scatter defenders of palace 
### 
GROZNY, Russia (AP) — Trying new
tactics in their assault on Chechnya's
capital, Russian forces yesterday
unleashed systematic rocket and mortar
fire pounding the city with up to a dozen
shells a minute.
They were trying to scatter Chechen
fighters defending the presidential palace
and prepare the way for Russian ground
troops to move in.
But the strategy seemed only partially
successful against outgunned but spirited
defenders, who have been able to sneak
around to counterattack from behind.
"We have no problem destroying any
armored vehicles they send into the city,"
said 29-year-old fighter Lyomo Sayatov,
taking a rest in a bomb shelter. "We have
enough ammunition to fight to the end!"
Under the constant drumming of

explosions, small truckloads of rebels
raced toward central Grozny carrying
rebels who shouted, "Allah Akbar" —
God is Great. Every 10 minutes or so, a
truck would return with the wounded.
The past two days of fighting evidently
had taken their toll on the hardy Chechen
fighters — there was no singing and
dancing as before and there were few
smiles. But the fighters insisted nothing
could pry them from Grozny.
Yesterday was the ninth day of the
Russian ground attack on Grozny, capital
of the breakaway southern republic. Sev
eral thousand people have been killed and
wounded since Russian troops went into
Chechnya on Dec. 11, and the Red Cross
estimates 350,000 people are refugees.
The vicious pounding continued two
days after President Boris Yeltsin

demanded to know why the city was being
bombed despite his orders to halt. Gov
ernment statements in Moscow have dif
fered sharply from reality in Chechnya,
leaving the impression that Russia's com
mander-in-chief is not fully in control.
Yeltsin sent tens of thousands of
troops into Chechnya, a mostly Muslim
region of 1.2 million people, in a bid to
reassert Moscow's control.
Russian reinforcements continued to
arrive yesterday. About 10 light tanks
accompanied by more than 30 trucks car
rying troops and ammunition rumbled in
from the southwest.
Russian forces also launched sporadic
air attacks on outlying villages and
ridges, where Chechen fighters have
deployed in recent weeks to conduct a
guerrilla war.
