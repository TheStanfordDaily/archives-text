Editorials represent a majority of the editorial board. The board consists o( five Daily editors, two at-large
staff members and two at-large editorial writers selected from the community by the Daily staff.

ASSU LEADERS HAVE
announced that they will
implement a new computer
ized voting system based on the
World Wide Web system that is the
current rage at Stanford and
beyond.
The UNIX voting system used
last year was more efficient than
the old HyperCard voting system
and allowed students to vote at
any time rather than only during
certain hours. Yet it proved less
accessible and more cumbersome
than the HyperCard program,
especially for those with little com
puter experience.
Some even blamed the UNIX vot
ing system for an unusually high
rate of abstentions on special-fee
votes. Because each vote required
three keystrokes rather than just
one mouse click, critics said, many
voters simply skipped over the spe
cial-fee votes. So several groups'
fees were approved by a majority of
voters but did not receive fees
because the yes votes did not consti

tute 15 percent of the registered
student population, as required by
the ASSU Constitution.
The World Wide Web voting sys
tem in the works promises to com
bine the efficiency of the UNIX sys
tem with the user-friendliness of
the old HyperCard system. An easy
to-use, graphically oriented pro
gram will surely help improve voter
turnout and will increase involve
ment in student government.
ASSU officials must keep a few
things in mind while building the
new system, however. They must
take care to ensure that the system
is secure on both sides â€” they must
take steps both to prevent voter
fraud and to keep voters' comput
ing accounts safe from tampering.
And most importantly, ASSU
elections officials must remember
that even the easiest computer vot
ing system will fail unless all
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents are informed of all voting
requirements well before the elec
tion.
