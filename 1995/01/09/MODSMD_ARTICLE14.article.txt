# Tresidder proposals

### 
THE FIVE STUDENT mem
bers of the Tresidder Adviso
ry Board — the group
charged with overseeing Tresidder
Union's daily operations — are
doing us all a favor by voicing stu
dent support for proposals to
improve the student union's ser
vices.
That Tresidder Express might
actually be capable of selling gro
ceries at reasonable prices is indeed
good news for Stanford students.
And the possibility that Tresidder
Union might be revitalized by
adding self-sufficient business pro
jects such as a copy center and a
fast-food restaurant would be equal
ly beneficial to the community.
These proposals — originally
submitted last year by the Tresid
der Task Force — are not revolu
tionary. However, they are certainly
necessary if Tresidder is to be taken
seriously as a student union.

The mark of a successful student
union must be its ability to satisfy
everyday student needs. Given the
considerable student demand that
would arise if Tresidder Express
were a reasonable place to buy gro
ceries and other products, the bene
fit of lowering prices would certain
ly outweigh the costs.
In much the same way, business
projects like a copy center and a
fast-food restaurant would fill a
void on campus and bring tremen
dous benefits to both students and
business owners. For example, it is
not difficult to forecast the
inevitable success of an establish
ment that serves inexpensive food
late at night to book-weary stu
dents needing a study break.
Kudos to the students on the
Tresidder Advisory Board who are
ensuring that the revitalization of
the student union begins on the
right course.
