## Humanity is not for sale 
### 
AS WE ENTER the second half of
the last decade of the 20th century,
ethnic and national conflicts con
tinue to rage around the globe. The cen
tury that began with the war to end all
wars and then quickly followed up with a
sequel which gruesomely proved that
label a misnomer is still haunted by the
specter of expansionism, nationalism and
genocide. Temporarily tranquil Europe is
impotently witnessing a war that gives
Balkanization an ugly new meaning,
while the machetes wielded in East Africa
are still red from their recent exercise in
violent intolerance. The republics of the
former Soviet Union are struggling to
defend their artificial integrity from
secessionist rebels, and Asia, while out
wardly showing a serene veneer, hides a
cauldron of unresolved tensions in Kam
puchea, Tibet and East Timor, to name
but a few.
And as the United States heads
towards its 220 th year, it is beginning to
show signs of age. Once a brash young
nation eager to rush to the ends of the
world to defend democracy and uphold
human rights (as well as to protect the
interests of its stockholders, investment
bankers and telecommunications compa
nies), fighting the Communists on the
left and the Nazis on the right, it is now
cowering behind a wall of self-interest
anc complacency. Humbled and shocked
by the sight of a generation of young men
perishing in a misguided crusade in the

southeast Asian jungle, and seduced by a
decade of Tinseltown rule into believing
that democracy and personal freedom are
synonymous with economic success and
commercialistic self-indulgence, America
has chosen to look inward, putting itself
first and electing a government more
interested in prayer and masturbation in
schools than blood in Bosnia.
American foreign policy has degener
ated into a game of trade agreements and
voluntary export restrictions, where
countries are assessed by their actual or
potential purchasing power and labor
costs. When military might is used, it is
inextricably linked to the bottom line. A
mad tyrant threatening the world's oil
supplies will precipitate the largest
American military operation since World
War 11, while the slaughter of over half a
million people in resource-poor Rwanda
and the ethnic cleansing of tens of thou
sands of economically irrelevant Bosni
ans merit little more than a formal letter
of protest. Crises aside, the battles Amer
icans are most likely to fight are not on
foreign shores but in corporate board
rooms and at international conference
tables.
The positive side of these develop
ments is, of course, the realization that
killing one's opponents is probably not
the best way to win them over in the long
run. War is beginning to be seen as a
rather primitive and largely self-defeat
ing way to approach problems, advisable

only as a last resort. By all accounts, it
would seem much more humane to set
one's commerce secretaries and trade
negotiators at each other's throats than
one's generals and soldiers.
But lost is the conviction that foreign
policy is not simply economic policy. And
only feebly understood is the fact that in
a shrinking world, the line between for
eign policy and domestic policy becomes
increasingly blurred. What happens in a
seemingly distant corner of the earth is in
reality no different from what happens
around the corner. If a young couple is
shot to death on a bridge near Sarajevo,
that is us. If a teenage girl is raped and
knifed outside Kigali, that is us.
As a nation of unparalleled wealth and
influence, it is our responsibility to
rethink our passivity toward the perpe
tration of genocide and oppression world
wide. This must happen both on a per
sonal level, through active participation
in efforts to stem the tide of violence, and
on the government level, through proac
tive and courageous policies that are
aimed at the resolution of conflict and the
defense of individual rights, both here
and abroad.

Jonathan Huston wants to teach Jimmy
Carter's Sunday school class.
