Don't count out abstinence when discussing sex issues

lAM WRITING in response to Stewart
Richardson's letter criticizing the arti
cle and letter concerning the new
group Students for a Traditional Sexual
Ethic. Richardson's arguments are well
posed, and I applaud his courage and will
ingness to discuss the issues surrounding
sex. However, I believe that some of his
reasoning is based on subtle misunder
standings of the issue.
Richardson argues that "if the mem
bers of the group have ... remained absti
nent, then they are less informed about
the joys of premarital sex than the people
who they intend to educate." This logic
seems to imply that one can make an
informed decision on an issue only after
having had personal experience. However,
I would contend that there are many other
ways of assessing the overall impact of a

particular behavior, including clinical data,
psychological studies, and the shared expe
riences of friends or relatives who have
incurred emotional effects that are posi
tive, negative, or both. For example,
although someone may have never experi
mented with crack cocaine, does this fact
render that person incapable of making an
informed decision on the issue of drug
use? Certainly in this case, it is much safer
and healthier to render a judgment in the
absence of firsthand experience.
Second, the statements that "the rel
atively underrepresented viewpoint that
abstinence before marriage is a very
good and real option" and "there exists
an underlying presupposition that sex
outside of marriage is normal or even
expected" probably refer to the seeming
emphasis on premarital and extramari

tal sex in our culture, particularly in
movies and television. One recent media
study found that there were an average
of 1,100 sex scenes per month on prime
time television in the United States, and
on average, 96 percent of those were
between characters who were unmar
ried. Clearly, the overwhelming mes
sages that TV and Hollywood send soci
ety are ones that embrace premarital
and extramarital sex as norms of behav
ior. Along with the widespread availabil
ity of free contraceptives for unmarried
students on campus, what might be the
compound effect of these messages upon
a student pondering abstinence? Indeed,
students who have decided that they
would prefer to wait until marriage may
begin to feel that they are somehow odd,
abnormal or in the least, hopelessly

prude.
Though often ignored, abstinence is
the only method of birth control that is
guaranteed to be 100 percent effective.
Even if two students decide to engage in
"safe" sex , but are not ready to deal with
the possible consequences of a pregnancy,
then perhaps it is time for them to reeval
uate the risks they are taking by their
actions.
To conclude. I would suggest that all of
us make a conscious effort to consider seri
ously and think critically about the issues
surrounding sex. Regardless of what each
individual eventually decides, through
both group discussion and personal reflec
tion, a great deal of possible future emo
tional trauma and regret may be averted.
