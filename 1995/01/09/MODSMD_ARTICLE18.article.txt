# Dean of Students says Review's criticism was based on inaccuracies
## 
### 
Once again The Stanford Review has
overstepped the boundary of respectable
journalism in its Nov. 28 "Beat It" edito
rial about me and Diana Akiyama leav
ing the University. I won't bother com
menting on the satirical tone of the edi
torial. The readers of the editorial may
judge it for themselves. I would, howev
er, like to correct several unsubstantiat
ed allegations and misrepresentations.
I have never kept files on conserva
tive students or any other students just
because they are politically active. This
is a totally false assertion. This is not
the way that an open university such as
Stanford works.
I did not take a private complaint
against a conservative student and
spearhead an effort to get letters written
to that student's potential employers.
The record about the incident in ques-

tion (which is, I assume, the Rabois inci
dent) demonstrates that the student's
actions were quite public and warranted
an appropriate public response.
Regarding Aman Verjee's "personal
letter," it should be noted that this "per
sonal letter" was sent to one of my col
leagues who then showed it to me before
I even received the letter from Aman. In
order to respond to Aman's request that
an open dialogue be created between he,
Native American students and others
protesting the use of the American Indi
an caricature in The Review, I shared
his letter with my staff to foster said dia
logue.
The Stanford community benefits
from reading student publications
expressing different opinions. The effec
tiveness of such publications, however,
is dependent on the quality of the con
tributors: they need to be accurate, bal
anced and fair, and they need to resist
personal attacks on individuals and
groups.
Stanford Review, please take more
time to get your facts straight. How do

you expect to play a vital role in improv
ing Stanford and enhancing your credi
bility when the standards of your publi
cation often fail to meet good journalis
tic practices?
