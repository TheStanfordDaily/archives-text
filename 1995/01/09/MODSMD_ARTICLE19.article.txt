# Rewards are greater if virtue is rooted not in coercion but in choice
## 
### 
Referring to the Nov. 29 article about
campus Mormons, the restrictions
imposed on Tyler Croft and his fellow
Mormons by their patriarchal leaders
are examples of coerced virtue. An alter
native to coercion is provided by the
Christians' exercise of personal freedom.
Christians, through the internal convic
tion of their hearts and minds, seek an
inner disposition that results in virtuous
behavior. The choice between Mormons
and Christians is between imposed law

and condemnation or the responsible
exercise of freedom. Christian freedom
liberates us from the bondage of legal
ism and the bondage of moral anarchy.
Would you rather avoid sex because it
is a legal requirement (with associated
penalties by the lawgivers) or because
you have made a voluntary choice in the
service of virtue?
Which would you rather be: tethered
and controlled by the kite flyer and his
string or soaring in a glider?
Love is a more potent incentive to vir
tuous behavior than legal regulation and
fear of judgment could ever be.
