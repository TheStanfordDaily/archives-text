# Women spikers win NCAA crown
## 
### Sarah Nagae Editorial staff 
It didn't take horses, lassos or
six-shooters for the Stanford
women's volleyball team to clean
up the town of Austin, Texas.
When the guns fell silent on
the night of Dec. 17, the second

ranked Cardinal downed UCLA
in front of 8,312 spectators in the
Frank Erwin Center to complete
what it set out to do five months
ago — round up the National
Championship.
The Cardinal outplayed the
No. 3 Bruins 15-10, 5-15, 16-14,
15-13, yet by no means did either

team dominate the match. Un
usually low hitting percentages
and a high number of hitting er
rors marked four hard-fought,
tight games. After a second con
test in which UCLA's offense
turned on the heat, Stanford
came out on top in game three to
swing momentum its way. It rode

that high through game four and
to a second Stanford NCAA title
in three years.
"I'm still not sure how we did
it. Basically we just fought like
crazy, even through we weren't
at our best," said head coach Don
Shaw. "We struggled at times,
but this is a tough group. It's a
real credit to them that they kept
grappling. Suddenly, someone
just told me it was over — I had
no idea."
And grapple Stanford did, for
every side out and every point.
After handling Ohio State in
three games in the semifinals on
Thursday night, the Cardinal en
tered game one of the final match
energized to confront its archri
val and take revenge against the
only team which managed to best
Stanford in regular-season play.
While UCLA lit up the score
board first, Stanford's first three
plays set the tone for the rest of
the night. After junior Cary Wen
dell pounded down the Cardinal's
initial kill, junior MarnieTriefen
bach slammed the ball over the
heads of the Bruin front row
whilefreshman Kristen Folkl fol
lowed the trend with a slam from
the backcourt. Bruin senior An
nett Buckner found her share of
holes in the Stanford backcourt,
but the Cardinal offense soon set
tled into a comfortable pattern,
one that hinged on Folkl's un
touchable kills. She tallied a ca
reer-high 25 on the night.
"I got us into some holes, so I
felt obligated to get us out," Folkl
said. "I'm just glad the setters
had confidence in me — I basical
ly put it away because I didn't
want to lose."
Stanford stayed a couple of
points in front of the Bruins for
most of game one, and from a
score of 8-6, Triefenbach and
freshman Barbara Ifejika both
registered kills to boost Stanford

to 10-8. While Bruin Jenny John
son's consistently tough hitting
slowed the Cardinal run a hit, Folkl
delivered the final blow which ended
the game at 15-10.
"Folkl is a pretty powerful player
and we couldn't turn it around when
we needed to," said UCLA coach
Andy Banachowski. "We were pretty
fired up at the start but we wore out
a little bit and maybe got a little
tired. I don't think anyone wants to
go out and play another game right
now."
The Bruins didn't look at all
fatigued in the second contest as

Stanford capitalized on its
energy from game three to
establish dominance quickly in
the fourth outing. Relying on a
sure-fire method for point
scoring, the Cardinal repeated
ly fed Folkl the ball, and, in
doing so, pulled out to a 5-0
lead. Buckner and freshman
Kara Milling kept the Bruins
in the game, however, as they
each pounded down kills to the
Cardinal backcourt while
Johnson confounded Stanford
with a solo block followed by a
pair of kills to even the score at
8-8.
"I felt game three slipped
away when Stanford started
scoring, that was our mis
take," Johnson said. "In game
four we were fired up but
didn't execute on the court. We
picked it up but it was just too
little too late."
For the remainder of the
nail-biting match, Stanford
managed to stay one step
ahead of the Bruins thanks to
a crucial Sharpley-Murfee dou-

Johnson, Buckner and senior
Ally son Randick led their squad to a
.347 hitting percentage and held
Stanford to a mere .122. A well
placed dump by Randick broke a 3-2
stan l-off and UCLA went on to gain
a 10-3 advantage after Stanford bob
hied a play and failed to return a
serve. Neither a series of kills by
Triefenbach and Wendell, nor the
substitutions of sophomores Cather
ine Julliard and Eileen Murfee or
senior Denise Rotert were enough to
keep the Bruins from an eventual
15-5 win.
"We were a little pumped up,
jumping a little too high and reach
ing too high," Shaw said. "The balls
were going through the block, not
over or around it. We just needed to
adjust our blocking a little."

ble block at 10-11 followed by
kills from Triefenbach and Ife
jika. As was characteristic of
the match, however, it was
Folkl who came through for
three kills in a row to guaran
tee the victory for Stanford.
With Ifejika serving at 14-13,
Murfee then made the dream a
reality when she reached for
the match-winning block.
"I knew we were going to
have to fight for every point —
one at a time," Triefenbach
said. "Then at 14-14 we think,
hey, we can win this game."
The statistics prove Triefen
bach's point, as the two teams
ended with very similar num
bers. Stanford registered a
mere .175 hitting percentage
with 86 kills off of 229 total
attacks. The team only hit
lower than this mark once dur
ing the season, in its Novem
ber loss to the Bruins in Los
Angeles when it managed only
173. UCLA finished with 81
kills off of 232 total attacks for
a mark of .172.

while Ifojika provided the Cardinal

down two kills of her own off the
Bruin front line. Engaged in a tug

remained nec . and neck all the way

a little less tangible and a little
more hasic.

"I think tonight showed
what our team could do based
on talent alone," she said. "We
showed how much we wanted
it. We came out hard in the
first game, then played the sec
ond a little tentatively but
pulled through in the third
and the fourth."
Sharpley and her fellow

side outs were accumulated between
the scores of 11-14 and 16-14, eight
of which Stanford claimed. A double
block by Wicks and Folkl finally cap
tured the match and with it, the bal
ance of power for an activated Cardi
nal squad.
"We really had to play this game
in the here and now," Shaw said.
"There's always time to win. It's a
matter of figuring out what it takes
to win this play.
"We've won a lot of tight games
this year. Tonight, it was the cir
cumstances together with the oppor
tunity. We didn't get too flustered,
and we threw in a few new things out
there. At times we lost our commu
nication lines but managed to get
settled down enough to win the
match."

freshmen demonstrated that it
doesn't necessarily take NCAA
tournament experience to feel
comfortable in, or, in their
case, dominate the Final Four.
In addition to Folkl's 25 kills,
Ifejika tallied a career-high 17
digs while Sharpley racked up
career highs of 52 assists, 21
digs and eight block assists.
Triefenbach swung for 23 kills
while Wendell bolstered the
offense with 17 kills and 26
assists.
While she didn't post the
night's most impressive num
bers, Stanford players
attributed much of their psy
chological motivation to team
co-captain Wicks.
"In the huddle, Slick
(Wicks) told us, 'You guys, this
is the moment, there's no
other time to do it,"' Triefen
bach said. "I played off of what
she said and realized that this
is for fun. I tried to smile and
not take it for granted."
What exactly did Wicks say
to inspire her team?

"We worked hard for every
thing tonight," Wicks said.
"On Thursday we were ner
vous and tight until the end
when we started to have more
fun. I wanted to be able to do
that again. In the huddle, I
was just trying to get them to
loosen up, to be glad we were
where we were, glad we could
do what we were doing."
The Cardinal may not have
been quite as relaxed during
its semifinal match, but judg
ing by the 15-11, 15-9, 15-7
score, a case of jittery nerves
didn't effect the level of its
play. From a 3-3 mark in game
one, Stanford jumped ahead
and remained there for the
rest of the contest. Although
Buckeye setter Laura Davis
and outside hitter Gabriele
Jobst mustered a strong effort,
the Cardinal settled into an
offensive groove quickly, one
in which it remained
entrenched for the rest of the
night.
"At NCAAB, we expected a

tough match, especially from Ohio
State which is a real tough team,"
Shaw said. "I wasn't sure how well
we were going to play tonight, con
sidering the circumstances. They
came through like real troopers,
though, and did a great job."
Those "circumstances" included
hotel-room final exams and a 5
a.m. fire-alarm awakening and
building evacuation, followed by a
second alarm two hours later. So
while Stanford didn't play the
cleanest match of its season, it did
cruise through games two and
three managing to find the Buck
eye's weak spots.
We knew going in we would have
to be in system 80 percent of the time
— that didn't happen," said Ohio
State head coach Jim Stone. "Our
inability to side out consistently was
our undoing. It's not so much what
they did, it's what we didn't do."
When put to the test, Ohio State
couldn't muster the strength to
respond to the Cardinal's offensive
onslaught which Folkl led with 15
kills for a .423 hitting percentage.
Helped by Triefenbach's laser
beam jump serve and a strong
Wendell-Wicks quick-attack combi
nation, Stanford kept the Buckeyes
to a season-low .079 hitting per
centage. The Cardinal ended with
an offensive mark of . 181.
For their contributions against
both Ohio State and the Bruins,
Wendell, Triefenbach and Folkl
were named to the all-tournament
team together with Bucknor, John

son and Penn State's Salima
Davidson.
The Cardinal earned its way to
Austin by defeating Arizona State
15-8, 15-3, 15-6 in the first round
of the Western Regionals on Dec. 8,
followed by a 15-13, 15-13, 15-6
shellacking of USC the next night.
In reflecting on her experiences
as part of two national champi
onship teams in three years,
Triefenbach felt a heavier load
resting on her shoulders this time
than in 1992, when she played
much more of a support role. She

the beginning of the
season how will I keep
everyone happy. Well, I
think this moment is

attributed the dynamics of an
extremely close-knit team as the
main difference between the two
seasons, and also the most impor
tant aspect of the Cardinal's suc
cess this season.
"I had a more important part to
play in this championship," she
said. "It's 15 best friends together
on one team, sharing a national

championship, that doesn't come
along very often. This is a very
unselfish group."
Part of the unselfishness is
knowing what's best for the team
overall, even if it means lending
support in practice and from the
sidelines rather than as a starter. "I
credit the people who don't play,
some who started last year and
don't this year," Shaw said. "That
takes a lot of character to suck it up.
"People asked me at the begin
ning of the season how will I keep
everyone happy. Well, I think this
moment is the answer."
As this championship marks the
second time in Shaw's career that
Stanford has faced Pac-10 rival
UCLA in the final match, a second
victory over Banachowski (who has
led the Bruins to three titles) is an
especially sweet one.
"It's a great honor to win a
national championship, to beat one
of the greatest programs in the
country," Shaw said. "I think this
was a classic Stanford-UCLA
match, anytime these two teams
meet, it's going to be a battle, and
not pretty statistically. We made a
few careless errors and had close to
identical stats. The only stat that
counts though, the only one that
matters is who scored the last
point."
And by scoring that final point,
it was Stanford alone who
remained standing after the smoke
had cleared in the capital of the
Lone Star state.

women's volleyball team to clean
up the town of Austin, Texas.
When the guns fell silent on
the night of Dec. 17, the second

ranked Cardinal downed UCLA
in front of 8,312 spectators in the
Frank Erwin Center to complete
what it set out to do five months
ago — round up the National
Championship.
The Cardinal outplayed the
No. 3 Bruins 15-10, 5-15, 16-14,
15-13, yet by no means did either

team dominate the match. Un
usually low hitting percentages
and a high number of hitting er
rors marked four hard-fought,
tight games. After a second con
test in which UCLA's offense
turned on the heat, Stanford
came out on top in game three to
swing momentum its way. It rode

that high through game four and
to a second Stanford NCAA title
in three years.
"I'm still not sure how we did
it. Basically we just fought like
crazy, even through we weren't
at our best," said head coach Don
Shaw. "We struggled at times,
but this is a tough group. It's a
real credit to them that they kept
grappling. Suddenly, someone
just told me it was over — I had
no idea."
And grapple Stanford did, for
every side out and every point.
After handling Ohio State in
three games in the semifinals on
Thursday night, the Cardinal en
tered game one of the final match
energized to confront its archri
val and take revenge against the
only team which managed to best
Stanford in regular-season play.
While UCLA lit up the score
board first, Stanford's first three
plays set the tone for the rest of
the night. After junior Cary Wen
dell pounded down the Cardinal's
initial kill, junior MarnieTriefen
bach slammed the ball over the
heads of the Bruin front row
whilefreshman Kristen Folkl fol
lowed the trend with a slam from
the backcourt. Bruin senior An
nett Buckner found her share of
holes in the Stanford backcourt,
but the Cardinal offense soon set
tled into a comfortable pattern,
one that hinged on Folkl's un
touchable kills. She tallied a ca
reer-high 25 on the night.
"I got us into some holes, so I
felt obligated to get us out," Folkl
said. "I'm just glad the setters
had confidence in me — I basical
ly put it away because I didn't
want to lose."
Stanford stayed a couple of
points in front of the Bruins for
most of game one, and from a
score of 8-6, Triefenbach and
freshman Barbara Ifejika both
registered kills to boost Stanford

to 10-8. While Bruin Jenny John
son's consistently tough hitting
slowed the Cardinal run a hit, Folkl
delivered the final blow which ended
the game at 15-10.
"Folkl is a pretty powerful player
and we couldn't turn it around when
we needed to," said UCLA coach
Andy Banachowski. "We were pretty
fired up at the start but we wore out
a little bit and maybe got a little
tired. I don't think anyone wants to
go out and play another game right
now."
The Bruins didn't look at all
fatigued in the second contest as

Stanford capitalized on its
energy from game three to
establish dominance quickly in
the fourth outing. Relying on a
sure-fire method for point
scoring, the Cardinal repeated
ly fed Folkl the ball, and, in
doing so, pulled out to a 5-0
lead. Buckner and freshman
Kara Milling kept the Bruins
in the game, however, as they
each pounded down kills to the
Cardinal backcourt while
Johnson confounded Stanford
with a solo block followed by a
pair of kills to even the score at
8-8.
"I felt game three slipped
away when Stanford started
scoring, that was our mis
take," Johnson said. "In game
four we were fired up but
didn't execute on the court. We
picked it up but it was just too
little too late."
For the remainder of the
nail-biting match, Stanford
managed to stay one step
ahead of the Bruins thanks to
a crucial Sharpley-Murfee dou-

Johnson, Buckner and senior
Ally son Randick led their squad to a
.347 hitting percentage and held
Stanford to a mere .122. A well
placed dump by Randick broke a 3-2
stan l-off and UCLA went on to gain
a 10-3 advantage after Stanford bob
hied a play and failed to return a
serve. Neither a series of kills by
Triefenbach and Wendell, nor the
substitutions of sophomores Cather
ine Julliard and Eileen Murfee or
senior Denise Rotert were enough to
keep the Bruins from an eventual
15-5 win.
"We were a little pumped up,
jumping a little too high and reach
ing too high," Shaw said. "The balls
were going through the block, not
over or around it. We just needed to
adjust our blocking a little."

ble block at 10-11 followed by
kills from Triefenbach and Ife
jika. As was characteristic of
the match, however, it was
Folkl who came through for
three kills in a row to guaran
tee the victory for Stanford.
With Ifejika serving at 14-13,
Murfee then made the dream a
reality when she reached for
the match-winning block.
"I knew we were going to
have to fight for every point —
one at a time," Triefenbach
said. "Then at 14-14 we think,
hey, we can win this game."
The statistics prove Triefen
bach's point, as the two teams
ended with very similar num
bers. Stanford registered a
mere .175 hitting percentage
with 86 kills off of 229 total
attacks. The team only hit
lower than this mark once dur
ing the season, in its Novem
ber loss to the Bruins in Los
Angeles when it managed only
173. UCLA finished with 81
kills off of 232 total attacks for
a mark of .172.

"I think tonight showed
what our team could do based
on talent alone," she said. "We
showed how much we wanted
it. We came out hard in the
first game, then played the sec
ond a little tentatively but
pulled through in the third
and the fourth."
Sharpley and her fellow

side outs were accumulated between
the scores of 11-14 and 16-14, eight
of which Stanford claimed. A double
block by Wicks and Folkl finally cap
tured the match and with it, the bal
ance of power for an activated Cardi
nal squad.
"We really had to play this game
in the here and now," Shaw said.
"There's always time to win. It's a
matter of figuring out what it takes
to win this play.
"We've won a lot of tight games
this year. Tonight, it was the cir
cumstances together with the oppor
tunity. We didn't get too flustered,
and we threw in a few new things out
there. At times we lost our commu
nication lines but managed to get
settled down enough to win the
match."

freshmen demonstrated that it
doesn't necessarily take NCAA
tournament experience to feel
comfortable in, or, in their
case, dominate the Final Four.
In addition to Folkl's 25 kills,
Ifejika tallied a career-high 17
digs while Sharpley racked up
career highs of 52 assists, 21
digs and eight block assists.
Triefenbach swung for 23 kills
while Wendell bolstered the
offense with 17 kills and 26
assists.
While she didn't post the
night's most impressive num
bers, Stanford players
attributed much of their psy
chological motivation to team
co-captain Wicks.
"In the huddle, Slick
(Wicks) told us, 'You guys, this
is the moment, there's no
other time to do it,"' Triefen
bach said. "I played off of what
she said and realized that this
is for fun. I tried to smile and
not take it for granted."
What exactly did Wicks say
to inspire her team?

"We worked hard for every
thing tonight," Wicks said.
"On Thursday we were ner
vous and tight until the end
when we started to have more
fun. I wanted to be able to do
that again. In the huddle, I
was just trying to get them to
loosen up, to be glad we were
where we were, glad we could
do what we were doing."
The Cardinal may not have
been quite as relaxed during
its semifinal match, but judg
ing by the 15-11, 15-9, 15-7
score, a case of jittery nerves
didn't effect the level of its
play. From a 3-3 mark in game
one, Stanford jumped ahead
and remained there for the
rest of the contest. Although
Buckeye setter Laura Davis
and outside hitter Gabriele
Jobst mustered a strong effort,
the Cardinal settled into an
offensive groove quickly, one
in which it remained
entrenched for the rest of the
night.
"At NCAAB, we expected a

tough match, especially from Ohio
State which is a real tough team,"
Shaw said. "I wasn't sure how well
we were going to play tonight, con
sidering the circumstances. They
came through like real troopers,
though, and did a great job."
Those "circumstances" included
hotel-room final exams and a 5
a.m. fire-alarm awakening and
building evacuation, followed by a
second alarm two hours later. So
while Stanford didn't play the
cleanest match of its season, it did
cruise through games two and
three managing to find the Buck
eye's weak spots.
We knew going in we would have
to be in system 80 percent of the time
— that didn't happen," said Ohio
State head coach Jim Stone. "Our
inability to side out consistently was
our undoing. It's not so much what
they did, it's what we didn't do."
When put to the test, Ohio State
couldn't muster the strength to
respond to the Cardinal's offensive
onslaught which Folkl led with 15
kills for a .423 hitting percentage.
Helped by Triefenbach's laser
beam jump serve and a strong
Wendell-Wicks quick-attack combi
nation, Stanford kept the Buckeyes
to a season-low .079 hitting per
centage. The Cardinal ended with
an offensive mark of . 181.
For their contributions against
both Ohio State and the Bruins,
Wendell, Triefenbach and Folkl
were named to the all-tournament
team together with Bucknor, John

son and Penn State's Salima
Davidson.
The Cardinal earned its way to
Austin by defeating Arizona State
15-8, 15-3, 15-6 in the first round
of the Western Regionals on Dec. 8,
followed by a 15-13, 15-13, 15-6
shellacking of USC the next night.
In reflecting on her experiences
as part of two national champi
onship teams in three years,
Triefenbach felt a heavier load
resting on her shoulders this time
than in 1992, when she played
much more of a support role. She

People asked me at
the beginning of the
season how will I keep
everyone happy. Well, I

attributed the dynamics of an
extremely close-knit team as the
main difference between the two
seasons, and also the most impor
tant aspect of the Cardinal's suc
cess this season.
"I had a more important part to
play in this championship," she
said. "It's 15 best friends together
on one team, sharing a national

championship, that doesn't come
along very often. This is a very
unselfish group."
Part of the unselfishness is
knowing what's best for the team
overall, even if it means lending
support in practice and from the
sidelines rather than as a starter. "I
credit the people who don't play,
some who started last year and
don't this year," Shaw said. "That
takes a lot of character to suck it up.
"People asked me at the begin
ning of the season how will I keep
everyone happy. Well, I think this
moment is the answer."
As this championship marks the
second time in Shaw's career that
Stanford has faced Pac-10 rival
UCLA in the final match, a second
victory over Banachowski (who has
led the Bruins to three titles) is an
especially sweet one.
"It's a great honor to win a
national championship, to beat one
of the greatest programs in the
country," Shaw said. "I think this
was a classic Stanford-UCLA
match, anytime these two teams
meet, it's going to be a battle, and
not pretty statistically. We made a
few careless errors and had close to
identical stats. The only stat that
counts though, the only one that
matters is who scored the last
point."
And by scoring that final point,
it was Stanford alone who
remained standing after the smoke
had cleared in the capital of the
Lone Star state.

the night of Dec. 17, the second

ranked Cardinal downed UCLA
in front of 8,312 spectators in the
Frank Erwin Center to complete
what it set out to do five months
ago — round up the National
Championship.
The Cardinal outplayed the
No. 3 Bruins 15-10, 5-15, 16-14,
15-13, yet by no means did either

team dominate the match. Un
usually low hitting percentages
and a high number of hitting er
rors marked four hard-fought,
tight games. After a second con
test in which UCLA's offense
turned on the heat, Stanford
came out on top in game three to
swing momentum its way. It rode

that high through game four and
to a second Stanford NCAA title
in three years.
"I'm still not sure how we did
it. Basically we just fought like
crazy, even through we weren't
at our best," said head coach Don
Shaw. "We struggled at times,
but this is a tough group. It's a
real credit to them that they kept
grappling. Suddenly, someone
just told me it was over — I had
no idea."
And grapple Stanford did, for
every side out and every point.
After handling Ohio State in
three games in the semifinals on
Thursday night, the Cardinal en
tered game one of the final match
energized to confront its archri
val and take revenge against the
only team which managed to best
Stanford in regular-season play.
While UCLA lit up the score
board first, Stanford's first three
plays set the tone for the rest of
the night. After junior Cary Wen
dell pounded down the Cardinal's
initial kill, junior MarnieTriefen
bach slammed the ball over the
heads of the Bruin front row
whilefreshman Kristen Folkl fol
lowed the trend with a slam from
the backcourt. Bruin senior An
nett Buckner found her share of
holes in the Stanford backcourt,
but the Cardinal offense soon set
tled into a comfortable pattern,
one that hinged on Folkl's un
touchable kills. She tallied a ca
reer-high 25 on the night.
"I got us into some holes, so I
felt obligated to get us out," Folkl
said. "I'm just glad the setters
had confidence in me — I basical
ly put it away because I didn't
want to lose."
Stanford stayed a couple of
points in front of the Bruins for
most of game one, and from a
score of 8-6, Triefenbach and
freshman Barbara Ifejika both
registered kills to boost Stanford

to 10-8. While Bruin Jenny John
son's consistently tough hitting
slowed the Cardinal run a hit, Folkl
delivered the final blow which ended
the game at 15-10.
"Folkl is a pretty powerful player
and we couldn't turn it around when
we needed to," said UCLA coach
Andy Banachowski. "We were pretty
fired up at the start but we wore out
a little bit and maybe got a little
tired. I don't think anyone wants to
go out and play another game right
now."
The Bruins didn't look at all
fatigued in the second contest as

Stanford capitalized on its
energy from game three to
establish dominance quickly in
the fourth outing. Relying on a
sure-fire method for point
scoring, the Cardinal repeated
ly fed Folkl the ball, and, in
doing so, pulled out to a 5-0
lead. Buckner and freshman
Kara Milling kept the Bruins
in the game, however, as they
each pounded down kills to the
Cardinal backcourt while
Johnson confounded Stanford
with a solo block followed by a
pair of kills to even the score at
8-8.
"I felt game three slipped
away when Stanford started
scoring, that was our mis
take," Johnson said. "In game
four we were fired up but
didn't execute on the court. We
picked it up but it was just too
little too late."
For the remainder of the
nail-biting match, Stanford
managed to stay one step
ahead of the Bruins thanks to
a crucial Sharpley-Murfee dou-

Johnson, Buckner and senior
Ally son Randick led their squad to a
.347 hitting percentage and held
Stanford to a mere .122. A well
placed dump by Randick broke a 3-2
stan l-off and UCLA went on to gain
a 10-3 advantage after Stanford bob
hied a play and failed to return a
serve. Neither a series of kills by
Triefenbach and Wendell, nor the
substitutions of sophomores Cather
ine Julliard and Eileen Murfee or
senior Denise Rotert were enough to
keep the Bruins from an eventual
15-5 win.
"We were a little pumped up,
jumping a little too high and reach
ing too high," Shaw said. "The balls
were going through the block, not
over or around it. We just needed to
adjust our blocking a little."

ble block at 10-11 followed by
kills from Triefenbach and Ife
jika. As was characteristic of
the match, however, it was
Folkl who came through for
three kills in a row to guaran
tee the victory for Stanford.
With Ifejika serving at 14-13,
Murfee then made the dream a
reality when she reached for
the match-winning block.
"I knew we were going to
have to fight for every point —
one at a time," Triefenbach
said. "Then at 14-14 we think,
hey, we can win this game."
The statistics prove Triefen
bach's point, as the two teams
ended with very similar num
bers. Stanford registered a
mere .175 hitting percentage
with 86 kills off of 229 total
attacks. The team only hit
lower than this mark once dur
ing the season, in its Novem
ber loss to the Bruins in Los
Angeles when it managed only
173. UCLA finished with 81
kills off of 232 total attacks for
a mark of .172.

"I think tonight showed
what our team could do based
on talent alone," she said. "We
showed how much we wanted
it. We came out hard in the
first game, then played the sec
ond a little tentatively but
pulled through in the third
and the fourth."
Sharpley and her fellow

side outs were accumulated between
the scores of 11-14 and 16-14, eight
of which Stanford claimed. A double
block by Wicks and Folkl finally cap
tured the match and with it, the bal
ance of power for an activated Cardi
nal squad.
"We really had to play this game
in the here and now," Shaw said.
"There's always time to win. It's a
matter of figuring out what it takes
to win this play.
"We've won a lot of tight games
this year. Tonight, it was the cir
cumstances together with the oppor
tunity. We didn't get too flustered,
and we threw in a few new things out
there. At times we lost our commu
nication lines but managed to get
settled down enough to win the
match."

freshmen demonstrated that it
doesn't necessarily take NCAA
tournament experience to feel
comfortable in, or, in their
case, dominate the Final Four.
In addition to Folkl's 25 kills,
Ifejika tallied a career-high 17
digs while Sharpley racked up
career highs of 52 assists, 21
digs and eight block assists.
Triefenbach swung for 23 kills
while Wendell bolstered the
offense with 17 kills and 26
assists.
While she didn't post the
night's most impressive num
bers, Stanford players
attributed much of their psy
chological motivation to team
co-captain Wicks.
"In the huddle, Slick
(Wicks) told us, 'You guys, this
is the moment, there's no
other time to do it,"' Triefen
bach said. "I played off of what
she said and realized that this
is for fun. I tried to smile and
not take it for granted."
What exactly did Wicks say
to inspire her team?

"We worked hard for every
thing tonight," Wicks said.
"On Thursday we were ner
vous and tight until the end
when we started to have more
fun. I wanted to be able to do
that again. In the huddle, I
was just trying to get them to
loosen up, to be glad we were
where we were, glad we could
do what we were doing."
The Cardinal may not have
been quite as relaxed during
its semifinal match, but judg
ing by the 15-11, 15-9, 15-7
score, a case of jittery nerves
didn't effect the level of its
play. From a 3-3 mark in game
one, Stanford jumped ahead
and remained there for the
rest of the contest. Although
Buckeye setter Laura Davis
and outside hitter Gabriele
Jobst mustered a strong effort,
the Cardinal settled into an
offensive groove quickly, one
in which it remained
entrenched for the rest of the
night.
"At NCAAB, we expected a

tough match, especially from Ohio
State which is a real tough team,"
Shaw said. "I wasn't sure how well
we were going to play tonight, con
sidering the circumstances. They
came through like real troopers,
though, and did a great job."
Those "circumstances" included
hotel-room final exams and a 5
a.m. fire-alarm awakening and
building evacuation, followed by a
second alarm two hours later. So
while Stanford didn't play the
cleanest match of its season, it did
cruise through games two and
three managing to find the Buck
eye's weak spots.
We knew going in we would have
to be in system 80 percent of the time
— that didn't happen," said Ohio
State head coach Jim Stone. "Our
inability to side out consistently was
our undoing. It's not so much what
they did, it's what we didn't do."
When put to the test, Ohio State
couldn't muster the strength to
respond to the Cardinal's offensive
onslaught which Folkl led with 15
kills for a .423 hitting percentage.
Helped by Triefenbach's laser
beam jump serve and a strong
Wendell-Wicks quick-attack combi
nation, Stanford kept the Buckeyes
to a season-low .079 hitting per
centage. The Cardinal ended with
an offensive mark of . 181.
For their contributions against
both Ohio State and the Bruins,
Wendell, Triefenbach and Folkl
were named to the all-tournament
team together with Bucknor, John

son and Penn State's Salima
Davidson.
The Cardinal earned its way to
Austin by defeating Arizona State
15-8, 15-3, 15-6 in the first round
of the Western Regionals on Dec. 8,
followed by a 15-13, 15-13, 15-6
shellacking of USC the next night.
In reflecting on her experiences
as part of two national champi
onship teams in three years,
Triefenbach felt a heavier load
resting on her shoulders this time
than in 1992, when she played
much more of a support role. She

People asked me at
the beginning of the
season how will I keep
everyone happy. Well, I

attributed the dynamics of an
extremely close-knit team as the
main difference between the two
seasons, and also the most impor
tant aspect of the Cardinal's suc
cess this season.
"I had a more important part to
play in this championship," she
said. "It's 15 best friends together
on one team, sharing a national

championship, that doesn't come
along very often. This is a very
unselfish group."
Part of the unselfishness is
knowing what's best for the team
overall, even if it means lending
support in practice and from the
sidelines rather than as a starter. "I
credit the people who don't play,
some who started last year and
don't this year," Shaw said. "That
takes a lot of character to suck it up.
"People asked me at the begin
ning of the season how will I keep
everyone happy. Well, I think this
moment is the answer."
As this championship marks the
second time in Shaw's career that
Stanford has faced Pac-10 rival
UCLA in the final match, a second
victory over Banachowski (who has
led the Bruins to three titles) is an
especially sweet one.
"It's a great honor to win a
national championship, to beat one
of the greatest programs in the
country," Shaw said. "I think this
was a classic Stanford-UCLA
match, anytime these two teams
meet, it's going to be a battle, and
not pretty statistically. We made a
few careless errors and had close to
identical stats. The only stat that
counts though, the only one that
matters is who scored the last
point."
And by scoring that final point,
it was Stanford alone who
remained standing after the smoke
had cleared in the capital of the
Lone Star state.
