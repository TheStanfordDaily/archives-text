# Women spikers win NCAA crown

It didn't take horses, lassos or
six-shooters for the Stanford
women's volleyball team to clean
up the town of Austin, Texas.
When the guns fell silent on
the night of Dec. 17, the second

ranked Cardinal downed UCLA
in front of 8,312 spectators in the
Frank Erwin Center to complete
what it set out to do five months
ago — round up the National
Championship.
The Cardinal outplayed the
No. 3 Bruins 15-10, 5-15, 16-14,
15-13, yet by no means did either

team dominate the match. Un
usually low hitting percentages
and a high number of hitting er
rors marked four hard-fought,
tight games. After a second con
test in which UCLA's offense
turned on the heat, Stanford
came out on top in game three to
swing momentum its way. It rode

that high through game four and
to a second Stanford NCAA title
in three years.
"I'm still not sure how we did
it. Basically we just fought like
crazy, even through we weren't
at our best," said head coach Don
Shaw. "We struggled at times,
but this is a tough group. It's a
real credit to them that they kept
grappling. Suddenly, someone
just told me it was over — I had
no idea."
And grapple Stanford did, for
every side out and every point.
After handling Ohio State in
three games in the semifinals on
Thursday night, the Cardinal en
tered game one of the final match
energized to confront its archri
val and take revenge against the
only team which managed to best
Stanford in regular-season play.
While UCLA lit up the score
board first, Stanford's first three
plays set the tone for the rest of
the night. After junior Cary Wen
dell pounded down the Cardinal's
initial kill, junior MarnieTriefen
bach slammed the ball over the
heads of the Bruin front row
whilefreshman Kristen Folkl fol
lowed the trend with a slam from
the backcourt. Bruin senior An
nett Buckner found her share of
holes in the Stanford backcourt,
but the Cardinal offense soon set
tled into a comfortable pattern,
one that hinged on Folkl's un
touchable kills. She tallied a ca
reer-high 25 on the night.
"I got us into some holes, so I
felt obligated to get us out," Folkl
said. "I'm just glad the setters
had confidence in me — I basical
ly put it away because I didn't
want to lose."
Stanford stayed a couple of
points in front of the Bruins for
most of game one, and from a
score of 8-6, Triefenbach and
freshman Barbara Ifejika both
registered kills to boost Stanford
