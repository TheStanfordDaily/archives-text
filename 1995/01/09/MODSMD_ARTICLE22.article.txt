# Two alums win prestigious awards

As if becoming only the first
person from Stanford in the last
10 years to win both the Rhodes
and Marshall Scholarships isn't
distinctive enough, 1994 gradu
ate Rachel Maddow's celebratory
act of dying her hair blue certain
ly established the radical lesbian
activist as a true standout.
As a "symbolic gesture" to
show friends she "hadn't sold out
to the establishment," the cere
monial head-shaving and dye job
says a great deal about Maddow's
determination to break the mold
of academically stodgy and politi
cally ambitious Rhodes awardees,
the most famous perhaps being
President Clinton.
"I was very clear to the judges
that I'm not going to be a politi
cian or a lawyer or working for
the government," Maddow said
yesterday."I want to keep doing
the work I'm doing, helping peo
ple with AIDS and branching out
into other social justice issues."
The public policy and ethics in

society major, who has been
active in AIDS / HIV issues since
high school, is currently in the
second half of her year as a John
Gardner Public Service Fellow,
working as a policy assistant with
the San Francisco AIDS Legal
Referral Panel.
As far as she knows, Maddow
is the first American Rhodes
Scholar to be "out" to the judging
panel throughout the selection
process, she said.
Likening the pressure to follow
more lucrative paths after the
Rhodes to being at Stanford,
Maddow expressed skepticism
that she would ever succumb to
such temptations.
"At Stanford, everyone was
lobbied to work for McKinsey, so
you have all these people who
want to do really exciting things
succumbing to consulting or law
school," she said. "I'm still as
repulsed by that as I ever was . . .
It's not what I'm about."
One of a record 18 women to be
named 1995 Rhodes Scholars,
Maddow turned down the Mar
shall scholarship in favor of the

Rhodes and plans to pursue a
master's in politics at Oxford
University.
Maddow was one of 32 Ameri
cans chosen from a Held of 1,253
applicants. The Rhodes scholar
ship provides fees and living
expenses for two years of Oxford
graduate study.
Joining Maddow as a Stanford
Marshall honoree is Julie Novy, a
1993 graduate who studied
human biology and African stud
ies.
After establishing an impres
sive record of research at Stan
ford which included travel to
Tahiti, Moorea, France and Tan
zania, Novy spent a year in Mada
gascar as a Fulbright Scholar
researching alternatives to defor
estation and slash-and-burn agri
culture. Fluent in five languages,
Novy also plays semi-professional
basketball and competes in
triathlons.
Stanford's 49th Marshall
Scholar, Novy will receive fees
and living expenses for two years
of graduate study at any British
university.
