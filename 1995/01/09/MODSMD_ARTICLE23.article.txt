Riding the crest of a scintillat
ing 10-0 start to the season, the
23rd-ranked Cardinal men's bas
ketball team hoped to change its
fortune in Pullman, Washington,
which is historically as ugly as
the barren wastelands surround
ing the school. No such luck,
however, as Washington State (6-
3 overall, 2-0 Pacific Conference
10) bit away the Cardinal's hope
of remaining unbeaten, handing
Stanford (10-1 overall, 1-1 Pac
-10) a 77-63 defeat last Saturday.
The Cardinal had come away
winless on its last four trips to
Friel Court, including last year's
defeat towards the end of the sea
son, which, for all intents and
purposes, eliminated Stanford
from gaining an NCAA tourna
ment berth. So although the
Stanford run was bound to end
sooner or later, it was bitter irony
that these very same Cougars
emerged to extinguish the red
hot Cardinal.
"I never thought we were
going to go undefeated through
the season," said Cardinal head
coach Mike Montgomery. "You
just would like a little more com
petitive situation. You'd like to
feel you had a shot. We didn't
have a shot."
The Cardinal didn't have much

of a shot because of the electric
Cougar shooting. WSU came out
of the starting blocks with all bar
rels blazing. Stanford found itself
down by as many as nine within
the first 10 minutes of the ball
game, victimized by WSU guard
Shamon Antrum's three-point
marksmanship. Antrum was
four-of-four from downtown and
scored 15 points .. . and that was
in the first ten minutes of play.
"My teammates were just find
ing the open man," Antrum said.
"I was just hitting the open
jumper. The shots were good
shots, open shots, and they were
just falling."
Fellow Cougar guard Isaac
Fontaine was also torrid from
three-point range, nailing three
of-four. There appeared little the
Cardinal could do to slow down
either of the two sharpshooters.
"They were more open then
they should have been," Mont
gomery said. "You'd like to have a
better defensive effort getting to
people, but they shot the ball
extremely well. They just did a
great job."
And offensively, there
appeared little that Stanford
could do to match them. Shooting
a frigid three-of-14 from outside
the paint in the first half, Stan
ford managed most of its point
production by pounding the ball
down low to its big men. Fresh
man center Tim Young led all
Cardinal first-half scorers with
11 points. Senior forward Andy
Poppink started off strong, scor
ing five points in the first four
minutes of the game but then got
into foul trouble, picking up two
quick fouls.
Furthermore, Stanford's
standout guard Brevin Knight,
who has been nursing a "hot

spot" — a precursor to a possible
stress fracture — in his leg, had
played sparingly, saving for a run in
the second half. A run that never
materialized.
"I banked minutes to try to play
the second-half straight up normal
(with Knight)," Montgomery said.
"I didn't see a lot of life from any
body though. We had some more
minutes available for him, but it
didn't seem as if that was going to
make a whole lot of a difference."
Knight or no Knight, the
Cougars continued to extend their
seven-point halftime lead, lighting
up a Stanford defense that had
come into the game ranked first in
the Pac-10 in field-goal percentage
allowed, yielding just 39.4 percent.
It was Cougar guard Donminic Elli
son's turn in the second half to
bomb from long range, as he fired
two three-pointers, the second of
which gave WSU a commanding 19
point lead with 9:06 left to play in
the game. Ellison wasn't just hit
ting from long-range, however. He
was making baskets falling down

and on the floor, and he also found
time to dish out nine assists.
Ultimately, the Cougars left the
Cardinal defense shell-shocked,
shooting 59.6 percent from the
field. Through it all, the Cardinal
just appeared slower and less active
than the scrambling, rambling
Cougars, who got their fair share of
fast-break buckets in the second
half to go along with their jumpers.
"They out-hustled us," Mont
gomery said. "There's no excuse.
We just didn't play as hard, we
didn't play with as much poise, as
they did.
"We had a bad case of the stand
arounds both offensively and defen
sively. There was no fire, no move
ment there."
A frustrated and disappointed
Knight recorded a career-low four
points in just 21 minutes, eight
minutes below his season average.
"I didn't play long enough,"
Knight said. "They played defense
well. That's going to happen. I'm
not going to score every time or get
to the basket every time."
The big question in the big pic
ture then, is how Knight's hot spot
will afTed, the team. Up until the
"snafu at Wazzu," Stanford was off
and running to a 10-0 start, its best

in 40 years. And it hasn't only faced
lower echelon teams either. Two of
those wins were against ranked
squads and another came against a
Pac-10 team on the road, never an
easy task. In all three of those wins,
Knight played a huge role.
Two days prior to the loss to the
Cougars, the Cardinal defeated
Washington at Hec Edmundson
Pavilion 65-51 in its Pac-10 opener.
Although both teams played a slop
py game with 23 turnovers each,
the Stanford defense did hold the
Huskies to 33.3 percent field-goal
shooting.
"Washington did a good job of
taking us out of some things,"
Montgomery said. "But once we got
into a little bit of a groove defensive
ly, we did a good job. Every time you
defend you have a chance."
Knight played an integral role in
the low-scoring slugfest, registering
10 points in the second half to
secure the Stanford victory. But in
the first half, Knight showed some
signs of rustiness, having been kept
out of full-speed practice, some
thing that may also have contribut
ed to his sub-par performance
against the Cougars.
"Once I get adjusted to my tim
ing, I'll be able to adjust to the situ

ation," Knight said. "Right now, it'll
probably take me a little while to get
myself into the flow of the game."
The contest against the Huskies
marked a return for Knight, who
had sat out the previous game on
Dec. 29 against Cornell to rest his
leg. While the Cardinal did record a
67-55 victory, by no means did it
look like the 32-point favorite it was
suppose to be. Knight-less, the Car
dinal displayed a slow and plodding
tempo and played right into the
hands of the Big Red, who stayed in
the game by making 10 of 15 three
pointers.
Poppink fueled the Stanford vic
tory with a 17-point, 10-rebound
effort. Young also chipped in with
12 points to go along with his game
high 11 boards, and guard Dion
Cross fired in 18 points of his own.
Still, it was evident that the Cardi
nal was nowhere near as good as it
had been when it defeated two of
the nation's top teams in the prior
weeks.
Against then-No. 19 Wisconsin
on Dec. 27, amongst a constellation
of stars including Badger forward
Michael Finley and center lias hard
Griffith, Knight shone brightest as
he sliced and dished his way to 26
points and nine assists in the 95-78

Cardinal win.
"Knight is so quick with the
ball," said Wisconsin head coach
Stan Gundy. "He literally penetrat
ed every time he wanted to. He
dominated the game more than I've
ever seen a point guard dominate a
game."
Dominant he most certainly did
in Stanford's Dec. 22 clash against
then-No. 23 Virginia on the road, as
Knight again came through big.
This time he spearheaded a late
game surge in the crunch, scoring
eight points in the last four minutes
to seal the Cardinal triumph. That
was the first step taken on the Car
dinal's road to respectability this
season.
"This was a legitimate win for
us," Knight said. "The win means a
whole lot because people now know
who we are. It is no longer that
Stanford is just 'all right.' We came
in to get respect and that's what we
got."
Internally though, Cardinal
players got more than that. They
not only proved to others that they
could play, but they also proved to
themselves that they could go to
battle with the best.
"To win against a top-20 team on
the road is a real good win for us,"

Montgomery said. "People are
starting to take notice. The kids got
some confidence out of it. Next time
we're against a team that has a rep
utation, we'll be able to say, 'Hey,
we can play with these guys,' and go
out and play the game."
No doubt, with Knight firing at
all cylinders, the Cardinal can play
with anyone. But without him or
with him not fully healthy and prac
ticing, Stanford does not appear to
be the same — a half-step slower
and out of sync.
"It's really been difficult for
Brevin not ever getting to practice,"
Montgomery said. "It's pretty
tough to have any good feel. He's
going out there trying to just do it
without having practiced and run
and getting a rhythm. That's not
fair, but we have to have others pick
up the slack."
On certain occasions, others
have stepped up, like Cross, Pop
pink, and Young against Cornell.
But other times, like against
WSU, no one took on the respon
sibility.
But without players picking up
the slack, the difference between a
team with Knight and one without
may prove to be as stark a contrast
as Knight and day.

utation, we'll be able to say, 'Hey,
we can play with these guys,' and go
out and play the game."
No doubt, with Knight firing at
all cylinders, the Cardinal can play
with anyone. But without him or
with him not fully healthy and prac
ticing, Stanford does not appear to
be the same — a half-step slower
and out of sync.
"It's really been difficult for
Brevin not ever getting to practice,"
Montgomery said. "It's pretty
tough to have any good feel. He's
going out there trying to just do it
without having practiced and run
and getting a rhythm. That's not
fair, but we have to have others pick
up the slack."
On certain occasions, others
have stepped up, like Cross, Pop
pink, and Young against Cornell.
But other times, like against
WSU, no one took on the respon
sibility.
But without players picking up
the slack, the difference between a
team with Knight and one without
may prove to be as stark a contrast
as Knight and day.

Cardinal 65
Washington 51

Riding the crest of a scintillat
ing 10-0 start to the season, the
23rd-ranked Cardinal men's bas
ketball team hoped to change its
fortune in Pullman, Washington,
which is historically as ugly as
the barren wastelands surround
ing the school. No such luck,
however, as Washington State (6-
3 overall, 2-0 Pacific Conference
10) bit away the Cardinal's hope
of remaining unbeaten, handing
Stanford (10-1 overall, 1-1 Pac
-10) a 77-63 defeat last Saturday.
The Cardinal had come away
winless on its last four trips to
Friel Court, including last year's
defeat towards the end of the sea
son, which, for all intents and
purposes, eliminated Stanford
from gaining an NCAA tourna
ment berth. So although the
Stanford run was bound to end
sooner or later, it was bitter irony
that these very same Cougars
emerged to extinguish the red
hot Cardinal.
"I never thought we were
going to go undefeated through
the season," said Cardinal head
coach Mike Montgomery. "You
just would like a little more com
petitive situation. You'd like to
feel you had a shot. We didn't
have a shot."
The Cardinal didn't have much

of a shot because of the electric
Cougar shooting. WSU came out
of the starting blocks with all bar
rels blazing. Stanford found itself
down by as many as nine within
the first 10 minutes of the ball
game, victimized by WSU guard
Shamon Antrum's three-point
marksmanship. Antrum was
four-of-four from downtown and
scored 15 points .. . and that was
in the first ten minutes of play.
"My teammates were just find
ing the open man," Antrum said.
"I was just hitting the open
jumper. The shots were good
shots, open shots, and they were
just falling."
Fellow Cougar guard Isaac
Fontaine was also torrid from
three-point range, nailing three
of-four. There appeared little the
Cardinal could do to slow down
either of the two sharpshooters.
"They were more open then
they should have been," Mont
gomery said. "You'd like to have a
better defensive effort getting to
people, but they shot the ball
extremely well. They just did a
great job."
And offensively, there
appeared little that Stanford
could do to match them. Shooting
a frigid three-of-14 from outside
the paint in the first half, Stan
ford managed most of its point
production by pounding the ball
down low to its big men. Fresh
man center Tim Young led all
Cardinal first-half scorers with
11 points. Senior forward Andy
Poppink started off strong, scor
ing five points in the first four
minutes of the game but then got
into foul trouble, picking up two
quick fouls.
Furthermore, Stanford's
standout guard Brevin Knight,
who has been nursing a "hot

spot" — a precursor to a possible
stress fracture — in his leg, had
played sparingly, saving for a run in
the second half. A run that never
materialized.
"I banked minutes to try to play
the second-half straight up normal
(with Knight)," Montgomery said.
"I didn't see a lot of life from any
body though. We had some more
minutes available for him, but it
didn't seem as if that was going to
make a whole lot of a difference."
Knight or no Knight, the
Cougars continued to extend their
seven-point halftime lead, lighting
up a Stanford defense that had
come into the game ranked first in
the Pac-10 in field-goal percentage
allowed, yielding just 39.4 percent.
It was Cougar guard Donminic Elli
son's turn in the second half to
bomb from long range, as he fired
two three-pointers, the second of
which gave WSU a commanding 19
point lead with 9:06 left to play in
the game. Ellison wasn't just hit
ting from long-range, however. He
was making baskets falling down

and on the floor, and he also found
time to dish out nine assists.
Ultimately, the Cougars left the
Cardinal defense shell-shocked,
shooting 59.6 percent from the
field. Through it all, the Cardinal
just appeared slower and less active
than the scrambling, rambling
Cougars, who got their fair share of
fast-break buckets in the second
half to go along with their jumpers.
"They out-hustled us," Mont
gomery said. "There's no excuse.
We just didn't play as hard, we
didn't play with as much poise, as
they did.
"We had a bad case of the stand
arounds both offensively and defen
sively. There was no fire, no move
ment there."
A frustrated and disappointed
Knight recorded a career-low four
points in just 21 minutes, eight
minutes below his season average.
"I didn't play long enough,"
Knight said. "They played defense
well. That's going to happen. I'm
not going to score every time or get
to the basket every time."
The big question in the big pic
ture then, is how Knight's hot spot
will afTed, the team. Up until the
"snafu at Wazzu," Stanford was off
and running to a 10-0 start, its best

in 40 years. And it hasn't only faced
lower echelon teams either. Two of
those wins were against ranked
squads and another came against a
Pac-10 team on the road, never an
easy task. In all three of those wins,
Knight played a huge role.
Two days prior to the loss to the
Cougars, the Cardinal defeated
Washington at Hec Edmundson
Pavilion 65-51 in its Pac-10 opener.
Although both teams played a slop
py game with 23 turnovers each,
the Stanford defense did hold the
Huskies to 33.3 percent field-goal
shooting.
"Washington did a good job of
taking us out of some things,"
Montgomery said. "But once we got
into a little bit of a groove defensive
ly, we did a good job. Every time you
defend you have a chance."
Knight played an integral role in
the low-scoring slugfest, registering
10 points in the second half to
secure the Stanford victory. But in
the first half, Knight showed some
signs of rustiness, having been kept
out of full-speed practice, some
thing that may also have contribut
ed to his sub-par performance
against the Cougars.
"Once I get adjusted to my tim
ing, I'll be able to adjust to the situ

ation," Knight said. "Right now, it'll
probably take me a little while to get
myself into the flow of the game."
The contest against the Huskies
marked a return for Knight, who
had sat out the previous game on
Dec. 29 against Cornell to rest his
leg. While the Cardinal did record a
67-55 victory, by no means did it
look like the 32-point favorite it was
suppose to be. Knight-less, the Car
dinal displayed a slow and plodding
tempo and played right into the
hands of the Big Red, who stayed in
the game by making 10 of 15 three
pointers.
Poppink fueled the Stanford vic
tory with a 17-point, 10-rebound
effort. Young also chipped in with
12 points to go along with his game
high 11 boards, and guard Dion
Cross fired in 18 points of his own.
Still, it was evident that the Cardi
nal was nowhere near as good as it
had been when it defeated two of
the nation's top teams in the prior
weeks.
Against then-No. 19 Wisconsin
on Dec. 27, amongst a constellation
of stars including Badger forward
Michael Finley and center lias hard
Griffith, Knight shone brightest as
he sliced and dished his way to 26
points and nine assists in the 95-78

Cardinal win.
"Knight is so quick with the
ball," said Wisconsin head coach
Stan Gundy. "He literally penetrat
ed every time he wanted to. He
dominated the game more than I've
ever seen a point guard dominate a
game."
Dominant he most certainly did
in Stanford's Dec. 22 clash against
then-No. 23 Virginia on the road, as
Knight again came through big.
This time he spearheaded a late
game surge in the crunch, scoring
eight points in the last four minutes
to seal the Cardinal triumph. That
was the first step taken on the Car
dinal's road to respectability this
season.
"This was a legitimate win for
us," Knight said. "The win means a
whole lot because people now know
who we are. It is no longer that
Stanford is just 'all right.' We came
in to get respect and that's what we
got."
Internally though, Cardinal
players got more than that. They
not only proved to others that they
could play, but they also proved to
themselves that they could go to
battle with the best.
"To win against a top-20 team on
the road is a real good win for us,"

Montgomery said. "People are
starting to take notice. The kids got
some confidence out of it. Next time
we're against a team that has a rep
utation, we'll be able to say, 'Hey,
we can play with these guys,' and go
out and play the game."

Knight again came through big.
This time he spearheaded a late
game surge in the crunch, scoring
eight points in the last four minutes
to seal the Cardinal triumph. That
was the first step taken on the Car
dinal's road to respectability this
season.
"This was a legitimate win for
us," Knight said. "The win means a
whole lot because people now know
who we are. It is no longer that
Stanford is just 'all right.' We came
in to get respect and that's what we
got."
Internally though, Cardinal
players got more than that. They
not only proved to others that they
could play, but they also proved to
themselves that they could go to
battle with the best.
"To win against a top-20 team on
the road is a real good win for us,"

Montgomery said. "People are
starting to take notice. The kids got
some confidence out of it. Next time
we're against a team that has a rep
utation, we'll be able to say, 'Hey,
we can play with these guys,' and go
out and play the game."
No doubt, with Knight firing at
all cylinders, the Cardinal can play
with anyone. But without him or
with him not fully healthy and prac
ticing, Stanford does not appear to
be the same — a half-step slower
and out of sync.
"It's really been difficult for
Brevin not ever getting to practice,"
Montgomery said. "It's pretty
tough to have any good feel. He's
going out there trying to just do it
without having practiced and run
and getting a rhythm. That's not
fair, but we have to have others pick
up the slack."
On certain occasions, others
have stepped up, like Cross, Pop
pink, and Young against Cornell.
But other times, like against
WSU, no one took on the respon
sibility.
But without players picking up
the slack, the difference between a
team with Knight and one without
may prove to be as stark a contrast
as Knight and day.
