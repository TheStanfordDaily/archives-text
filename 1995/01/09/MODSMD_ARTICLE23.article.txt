Riding the crest of a scintillat
ing 10-0 start to the season, the
23rd-ranked Cardinal men's bas
ketball team hoped to change its
fortune in Pullman, Washington,
which is historically as ugly as
the barren wastelands surround
ing the school. No such luck,
however, as Washington State (6-
3 overall, 2-0 Pacific Conference
10) bit away the Cardinal's hope
of remaining unbeaten, handing
Stanford (10-1 overall, 1-1 Pac
-10) a 77-63 defeat last Saturday.
The Cardinal had come away
winless on its last four trips to
Friel Court, including last year's
defeat towards the end of the sea
son, which, for all intents and
purposes, eliminated Stanford
from gaining an NCAA tourna
ment berth. So although the
Stanford run was bound to end
sooner or later, it was bitter irony
that these very same Cougars
emerged to extinguish the red
hot Cardinal.
"I never thought we were
going to go undefeated through
the season," said Cardinal head
coach Mike Montgomery. "You
just would like a little more com
petitive situation. You'd like to
feel you had a shot. We didn't
have a shot."
The Cardinal didn't have much

of a shot because of the electric
Cougar shooting. WSU came out
of the starting blocks with all bar
rels blazing. Stanford found itself
down by as many as nine within
the first 10 minutes of the ball
game, victimized by WSU guard
Shamon Antrum's three-point
marksmanship. Antrum was
four-of-four from downtown and
scored 15 points .. . and that was
in the first ten minutes of play.
"My teammates were just find
ing the open man," Antrum said.
"I was just hitting the open
jumper. The shots were good
shots, open shots, and they were
just falling."
Fellow Cougar guard Isaac
Fontaine was also torrid from
three-point range, nailing three
of-four. There appeared little the
Cardinal could do to slow down
either of the two sharpshooters.
"They were more open then
they should have been," Mont
gomery said. "You'd like to have a
better defensive effort getting to
people, but they shot the ball
extremely well. They just did a
great job."
And offensively, there
appeared little that Stanford
could do to match them. Shooting
a frigid three-of-14 from outside
the paint in the first half, Stan
ford managed most of its point
production by pounding the ball
down low to its big men. Fresh
man center Tim Young led all
Cardinal first-half scorers with
11 points. Senior forward Andy
Poppink started off strong, scor
ing five points in the first four
minutes of the game but then got
into foul trouble, picking up two
quick fouls.
Furthermore, Stanford's
standout guard Brevin Knight,
