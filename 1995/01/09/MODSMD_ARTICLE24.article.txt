Cardinal 94
Washington St. 59
Cardinal 68
Washington 54

With the first week of games complet
ed in the Pacific 10 Conference, the Stan
ford women's basketball team (11-1, 2-0
in Pac-10) solidified its position atop the
standings.
Over winter break, the fifth-ranked
Cardinal ran amok over non-conference
foes and emerged victorious in both
league games against Washington and
Washington State. With possibly the
deepest team in women's basketball, sig
nified by the 11 players averaging double
figures in minutes played, Stanford
matured into the championship-contend
ing team that the preseason polls predict
ed.
The Cardinal started its vacation by
tying a school record when it exploded for
122 points on Dec. 10 against Cal State-
Fullerton. Redshirt junior Bobbie Kelsey
led the way with 21 points as she broke
out of her earlier slump. Freshman
Olympia Scott added a double-double,
scoring 18 points and grabbing 10
rebounds. The margin of 42 represented
the largest Cardinal victory at the time.
With momentum, Stanford then head
ed into the 9th Annual Fry's/Cardinal
Classic. The first round match-up proved
easy for the Cardinal, as it defeated St.
Mary's by 34, 83-49. Sophomore Kate
Starbird registered 20 points and Scott
continued playing well, contributing 13
points and eight rebounds.
In the earlier game, lowa failed to
advance as expected, leaving Northwest
ern State to challenge Stanford for the
tournament crown. The Cardinal went on
to break the century mark for the second
time in the season, defeating the Lady
Demons 102-62. Starbird led the team for
the second straight game with 22 points
and senior Anita Kaplan backed her up

with 19 points and eight
rebounds.
In addition to being named
tournament MVP, the Pac-10
honored Starbird by crowning her
Player of the Week. During the
Fry's/Cardinal event, she aver
aged 21 points, 5 assists and three
steals.

The Lady Friars of Providence
crusaded into town on Dec. 28 —
and promptly left after being
thrashed by 44 points. Stanford
tallied 107 points, led by Star
bird's 24 and senior Kate Paye's
22. Freshman Kristen Folkl, who
had just helped the Stanford
women's volleyball team capture
the NCAA title, made her basket
ball debut with four points, while
senior Rachel Hemmer, who had
been sidelined by injuries, played
eight minutes and added six
points.

Two days later, the University
of San Diego entered Maples
Pavilion. As 4,111 watched, the
Cardinal cruised to a 42-point vic
tory. Three players scored in dou
ble figures as Stanford fell four
points shy of reaching 100 points
for the third consecutive time. A
familiar face led the charge, as
Starbird scored 17 points in only
14 minutes while Kelsey added 15
and Folkl chipped in 10 points
and six rebounds. Every Cardinal
who played scored.
Last Monday, the Cardinal

traveled to Santa Clara to take on
the Broncos. The low-scoring
game ended with Stanford on top
by 29, 70-41. Paye led the team
with 13 as Starbird added 11
points and 5 rebounds.
The Pac-10 season began last
Thursday as then-No. 14 Wash
ington provided the first real chal
lenge since the game against Ten
nessee. The Cardinal battled to a
six-point halftime lead and
stretched it to 14 as Stanford
defeated the Huskies by a final of
68-54. Starbird, the only Cardinal

who scored double digits, set a
career high with 27 points.
Kaplan added nine points while
freshman Naomi Mulitauaopele
scored eight. In the dubious
honor section, Paye had possibly
her worst shooting game ever, fin
ishing with six points on a one
for-16 performance from the
floor. Until that game, Paye had
been shooting over 45 percent,
including an astounding 53.7 per
cent behind the stripe.
On Saturday, Stanford did the
customary switch when it took on

Washington State. The Cardinal
improved its shooting from 36
percent against the Huskies to 53
percent versus the Cougars as
Stanford won 94-59. Starbird
once again led the team with 16
points while Scott added 15.
Kelsey and Kaplan both scored 10
and Hemmcr, in limited minutes,
contributed nine points and six
rebounds. The game proved easi
er than the previous, as the Car
dinal led 48-32 at the half and was
never seriously threatened after
wards.
