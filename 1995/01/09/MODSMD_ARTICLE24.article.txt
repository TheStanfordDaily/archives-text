With the first week of games complet
ed in the Pacific 10 Conference, the Stan
ford women's basketball team (11-1, 2-0
in Pac-10) solidified its position atop the
standings.
Over winter break, the fifth-ranked
Cardinal ran amok over non-conference
foes and emerged victorious in both
league games against Washington and
Washington State. With possibly the
deepest team in women's basketball, sig
nified by the 11 players averaging double
figures in minutes played, Stanford
matured into the championship-contend
ing team that the preseason polls predict
ed.
The Cardinal started its vacation by
tying a school record when it exploded for
122 points on Dec. 10 against Cal State-
Fullerton. Redshirt junior Bobbie Kelsey
led the way with 21 points as she broke
out of her earlier slump. Freshman
Olympia Scott added a double-double,
scoring 18 points and grabbing 10
rebounds. The margin of 42 represented
the largest Cardinal victory at the time.
With momentum, Stanford then head
ed into the 9th Annual Fry's/Cardinal
Classic. The first round match-up proved
easy for the Cardinal, as it defeated St.
Mary's by 34, 83-49. Sophomore Kate
Starbird registered 20 points and Scott
continued playing well, contributing 13
points and eight rebounds.
In the earlier game, lowa failed to
advance as expected, leaving Northwest
ern State to challenge Stanford for the
tournament crown. The Cardinal went on
to break the century mark for the second
time in the season, defeating the Lady
Demons 102-62. Starbird led the team for
the second straight game with 22 points
and senior Anita Kaplan backed her up
