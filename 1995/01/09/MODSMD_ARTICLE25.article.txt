# A
						look at women's basketball in the conference Preview of Pac-10 women's hoops

### Emery Chen Staff writer 
When it comes to women's basket
ball, two things are certain in the
Pacific 10 Conference — it will be a
dogfight, and Stanford will finish
near the top. In five of the previous
six seasons the Cardinal kus won the
conference, and last year the team
finished second by one game. This
year should prove no different,
although Stanford is the odds-on
favorite to win. The predicted order
of finish:
1. Stanford (second in the Pac-10
last year with a 15-3 record) —
Despite the continued absence of for
ward Rachel Hemmer, nagging
injuries to key players such as center
Anita Kaplan and guard Kate Paye
and difficulties of playing inexperi
enced freshmen and sophomores, it
would be a major upset if the Cardi
nal fails to finish first. With only a
loss to No. 1 Tennessee and victories
over two Final-Four contenders so
far, Stanford has proven that it's in
the running for the national title. In
contrast to previous seasons, howev
er, scoring has been a problem and
will most likely continue as such
unless some of the youngsters, other
than forward Kate Starbird, step up.
Stanford should continue to improve
throughout the year and can be
expected to dominate the second half
of the Pac-10 schedule.
2. Washington (fourth in Pac-10,
12-6) — The Huskies lose All Pac-10
forward/guard Tara Davis, but the
pain is tempered by the return of
another all Pac-10 player, center
Rhonda Smith. Smith, who scored
18.4 ppg last year and snared 7.8 rpg,
will be surrounded by three other
starters from the squad that went
21-8 the previous season.
Forward/center Laura Gonsalves, a
major contributor last year off the
bench, most likely will step into the
starting lineup. Washington regis
tered an impressive victory at Texas
Tech and could contend for the divi
sion championship.
3. USC (first in the Pac-10, 16-2)
— The sun is not shining as brightly
as it did last season in La-La land.
The Trojans lost four of its five
starters to graduation, including All-
American forward Lisa Leslie, who
averaged 21.9 points per game and
12.3 rebounds per game. However,
USC does retain forward Tina

Thompson, whose impressive 1994
campaign earned her Pac-10 Fresh
man of the Year honors. Her 14.2
ppg and 10.5 rpg will help the Tro
jans, who have added three newcom
ers into the mix. USC should emerge
as a top seed in the NCAA tourna
ment but will likely not improve on
its 26-4 record from last year unless
coach Cheryl Miller, the best player
on the Trojan roster, is declared eli
gible.
4. Oregon State (sixth in Pac-10,
9-9) — The Beavers could surprise
its conference foes. All five starters
return to guide five recruits. For
ward All Pac-10 player Tanja Kostic,
who averaged 20.6 ppg and 9.4 rpg,
can expect frequent passes from
point guard Boky Vidic. Vidic led the
conference in assists with 176
despite playing only 21 games (for an
average of 8.4 assists per game). For
ward Anette Mollerstrom looks to

improve on her 14.7 ppg, while guard
Anjanette Dionne can also handle
point guard duties. The one ingredi
ent that the Beavers might lack this
year, however, is rebounding.
5. Oregon (third in Pac-10, 13-5)
— The Ducks join the spate of teams
that lost their best player. Forward
Debbie Sporcich, last year's team
leader and an All Pac-10 performer,
completed her four seasons and
leaves the honors to guard/forward
Jessica Schutt. Schutt averaged 10.8
ppg and will get help from guard
Karen Healea. Coach Jody Runge
begins her second season with Ore
gon as the returning Pac-10 Coach of
the Year, but will have to work her
magic with a short and young team,
as six newcomers will fill out the
Ducks' roster.
6. UCLA (fifth in Pac-10, 10-8) —
