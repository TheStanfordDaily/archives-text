### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
While visiting Washington, D.C. during
their East Coast road trip, members of the
men's basketball team witnessed last
month's fatal shooting of a man who threat
ened a police officer with a knife in front of
the White House.
The man, Marcelino Corniel, 33, was
shot twice by the police on Dec. 20 after al
legedly chasing Officer Stephen J. O'Neill
with a knife. Corniel died the following

night at George Washington University
hospital.
Some of the homeless people who live in
the square suggested that the incident may
have been the result of increased tension be
tween the residents and O'Neill, a park offi
cer.
Corniel allegedly chased O'Neill from
Lafayette Square to the sidewalk in front of
the White House, where the basketball
team had just finished a tour.
