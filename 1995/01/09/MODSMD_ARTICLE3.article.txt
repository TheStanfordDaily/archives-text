## Men's hoops team witnesses White House shooting 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
While visiting Washington, D.C. during
their East Coast road trip, members of the
men's basketball team witnessed last
month's fatal shooting of a man who threat
ened a police officer with a knife in front of
the White House.
The man, Marcelino Corniel, 33, was
shot twice by the police on Dec. 20 after al
legedly chasing Officer Stephen J. O'Neill
with a knife. Corniel died the following

night at George Washington University
hospital.
Some of the homeless people who live in
the square suggested that the incident may
have been the result of increased tension be
tween the residents and O'Neill, a park offi
cer.
Corniel allegedly chased O'Neill from
Lafayette Square to the sidewalk in front of
the White House, where the basketball
team had just finished a tour.
"A guard kept yelling 'Stop! '
We didn't understand what was
going on," said asst. basketball
coach Keith Larsen.
Larsen said more police offi
cers came and surrounded
Corniel, walking him back to the
middle of the sidewalk.
The police officers asked
Corniel to drop the knife at least
twice, but he did nothing.
"The next thing we heard was
two gunshots," Larsen said,
adding that he heard junior Dar
ren Allaway tell head coach Mike
Montgomery that the police "just
shot that man dead."
Corniel was shot once in the
chest and once in the leg after

being surrounded by four police
officers. He reportedly was only
six to 12 feet from the officers
when they shot him.
The team was on the driveway
behind the White House gates
during the shooting. Senior Bart
Lammersen estimated that they
were about 100 yards away from
the incident.
"It was like a scene from a
movie," Lammersen said. "The
whole thing looked fake. The
guard had his gun drawn and was
the one running away Ifrom
Corniel]."
Both Larsen and senior David
Harbour said that the team was
never in any real danger,
although they were told to lay
on the ground after the shoot
ing.
"I was numb to everything at
first," Harbour said. "I've never

been in a situation like thai
before. ... It wasn't really £
scared feeling. I just didn't know
how to react."
Larsen said members of the
team were on the ground betweei
two and five minutes as officials
secured the area. "We were kinc
of shocked. ... It was an interest
ing situation."
The shooting was one in
series of violent incidents at the
White House at the end of last
year.
Questions arose, however, over
whether the shooting was war
ranted after footage of the inci
dent showed Corniel standing
still just before being shot.
Corniel had been missing from
his Anaheim residence since Aug.
3 and was living in Lafayette
Square across the street from the
White House.
