to charges stemming from last spring's
vandalism of George Segal's "Gay Libera

Irwin was charged with felony vandal
ism, along with former student Todd Laßoc
ca who plead "no contest" to the charge in
September.

Jones Pichon set Irwin's sentencing hear
ing, which will be held in Santa Clara Coun
ty Superior Court, for Feb. 28 despite
protests by Irwin's attorney John Hack
man n that the hearing should be delayed
until March.
Hackmann argued that Irwin should
have as much opportunity as possible to per
form community service before his hearing
in Superior Court to encourage a decreased
sentence.
This path has already succeeded for
Laßocca whose charge was dimin
ished from felony to misde
meanor status by Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge
Diane Northway, who said she
was "very impressed" with
Laßocca's probation report.
Although Pichon did not
reschedule Irwin's sentencing
hearing, she said she is "sure that
Judge Northway will take into
account any efforts by Mr. Irwin
. . . as long as they are sincere."

However, Pichon warned
Irwin that the Superior Court
would not be required to decrease
his charge to a misdemeanor as it
did for Laßocca.
"It is at the discretion of
Judge Northway to decrease the
sentence," she said, adding that
currently Irwin's "no contest"
plea is legally tantamount to
pleading guilty to the felony
charge.
In addition to Irwin and
Laßocca, senior Mark Butter
field, junior Robert Gardner,
junior Jason White and former
student Brian Dallimore plead
"no contest" to counts of misde

meanor vandalism in November.
They were sentenced to one
year of court probation, required
to honor monetary and communi
ty-service penalties imposed by
Stanford, and ordered to either
perform an additional 50 hours of
community service or attend a
course on tolerance of alternative
lifestyles.
Likewise, Laßocca received
one year of probation and was
ordered to pay $1,700 in fines,
attend educational classes on
alternative lifestyles and com
plete 100 hours each of both com
munity service and graffiti clean
up.
