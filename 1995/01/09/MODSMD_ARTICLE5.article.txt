# COP gearing up for future tasks
## One quarter down, student leaders reflect, plan for upcoming months 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
Taking office after two years of
student government marked
largely by apathy, members of this
year's Council of Presidents be
lieve they have brought a new life
to the ASSU.
As they worked fall quarter on
issues including the Stanford
Fund and the special-fee process,
members said the group — made
up of four students of diverse
backgrounds — worked well to
gether and for the student body.
"I think it was a very produc
tive quarter," said senior Mork
Murdock, who, along with seniors
Anietie Ekanem and Lisa Lee, and
junior Vanessa Alvarado, forms
the COP.
COP members count among
their successes this year the Bus
Back the Axe initiative and placing
students on Commission on Un
dergraduate Education commit
tees.
But COP members said they
have only begun the work they
plan to accomplish this year.
What has been accomplished
this quarter goes a long way to
ward the goals for the rest of the
year, Murdock said. "Whatever we

do from here is based on how well
we set [fall] quarter up. It may not
be extremely visible as far as how
effective [fall] quarter was, but I
think [winter] quarter it will real
ly show."
"We set our goals really, really
high, and it's good that we accom
plished most of them," said
Ekanem. "But [this] quarter we're
going to be coming out even
stronger."
A 'comprehensive solution*
COP members said they have
had several successes this year al
ready.
For example, the Stanford
Fund policy, which would keep
student groups from soliciting
funding from alumni who con
tributed more than five years ago,
has been temporarily suspended
after it was challenged by students
and the COP.
Murdock said the suspension of
the policy after it was approved by
the administration is significant.
"I know of no precedent for that to
happen," he said.
A committee has been charged
with coming up with an alternate
plan to the Stanford Fund by Feb.
15. The plan itself "has some
potential," Ekanem said, "but we
don't feel comfortable putting our
full support behind it without all
the facts."
This quarter, the COP needs to
ensure that "student groups have
full access to presenting to the
working group their proposals or
concerns regarding the fund rais
ing policy," Murdock said.
The formatic* 1 of a committee
which proposed amending the
special-fee process for allocating
money to student groups was an
even greater success, Murdock
said.
The amendment — which
splits graduate and undergradu
ate voting on special-fee issues,
abolishes the fee refund and caps
the total special fee, among other
things — passed the ASSU senate
last quarter, though it may be
reconsidered at the senate's next
meeting.
"I feel like we've done what no
other COP has done in this
regard, which was pulling togeth
er a group of students — gradu
ates and undergrads — to take a
long look at the whole system and
come up with a comprehensive
solution."
This quarter will be used to
inform students of the commit
tee's proposal, Murdock said.
"We hope to be in a situation

where we put the question of
reforming the special fee system
and put the full facts on that out
to the student body and ask the
student body to vote on whether

they want a sys
tem that is more
balanced and
stable and fair
than the current
system," he
said.
Also last
quarter, the
COP won stu
dent representa
tion on a Com-

mission on Undergraduate Edu
cation committee, which was not
initially going to include student
members.
"Before the COP talked with
the provost and the president,
there were not students sitting on
these committees," Lee explained.
"Those students have a lot of
great perspectives to bring to that
committee."
'Rebuilding the office'
COP members said that even
though the group has come a
long way, largely because of the
ASSU's disarray coming into
this year, there remains much to
do.
"We're still rebuilding the
office of the COP," Alvarado said.
"It really hurt us a lot not to have
a good structure in place."
This poor structure has its
history in the disappearance of
the ASSU's executive body two

years ago when a slate titled "I
Prefer Not to have a COP" won
election and promptly abolished
itself.
"This quarter we haven't done
a lot of publicity-geared things,"
she said. "It's been reorganizing
and trying to make it more effi
cient, stuff that needs to be
done."
Now that the behind-the
scenes work has been accom
plished, the COP will be more
issue-oriented, she said.
The COP will be forming
action plans this quarter based on
surveys of student concerns,
Ekanem said, but they already
have a good idea of several issues
that need to be worked on.
In addition, they are looking at
bringing back the course evalua
tion book, Lee said. "This used to
be an ASSU project and it some
how fizzled . . . Students stopped
seeing it as a resource."
The course evaluations will be
more important now that the
University has implemented a
stricter grading policy, she said,
adding that a committee is look
ing into the issue.
Ekanem said he wants to work
on "reevaluating the whole
Tresidder structure" this quarter.
Student demands for services
within Tresidder have not been
met, he said.
These and other ideas are
included in a proposal presented
fall quarter to Dean of Students
Michael Jackson by a group of
students on the Tresidder Adviso

ry Board, of which Ekanem is a
member.
These two items and other
issues that students are interest
ed in will be investigated in part
by COP interns, a program start
ing this quarter that Ekanem said
has already drawn 30 interested
applicants.
With the possibility of more
changes in tuition and more bud
get cuts, Ekanem said he will
work to "make sure they're fair to
all." Services need to "be provided
to the level that they should be,"
he said.
In his work with graduate stu
dents, Murdock said this quarter
will be focused first on education
about the special-fee process,
after which graduate students
will have the opportunity to lobby
for issues of more specific inter
est.
One new service for graduate
students is a Graduate Student's
Guide to the ASSU, that Murdock
said will be distributed early this
quarter and that he hopes can be
distributed earlier in the future.
Defining their role
Overall, members of the COP
said they hope students see them
as a valuable resource.
F'kanem said he looks at him
self as "an advocate for what peo
ple need. I see my role on a very
personal basis as really being one
of the watchdogs."
"I think I'm really straight to
the point about things that are
really important and that are

important to the students," he
said.
While the students need a
strong voice, both parties need a
facilitator, Murdock said. He said

he sees himself
as "a person who
tries to bring the
ASSU and stu
dent interests
and needs closer
in line and also
makes it such
that the Univer
sity and student
concerns more
explicitly over
lap."

"I believe that they do,' he
added, "but people aren't seeing
the connections."
His past experience as an
ASSU senator has helped him in
the facilitator role, Murdock said.
"It gave me a good familiarity
with how the senate works."
He put that experience into use
at the last senate meeting of fall
quarter when working to pass the
controversial special-fee proposal
over stiff opposition so that the
issue could be voted on by stu
dents in a January election.
"We can't expect everything to
go extremely smoothly," said
Murdock, who campaigned for the
measure at the volatile meeting.
"That's politics."
Other COP members have had
negative experiences with the
administration, but they said that
relations between the two groups
are good this year.

Alvurado, who was heavily
involved with last year's hunger
strike by Chicano students, said
that "hasn't really affected the
way they've treated me or they
way I've viewed them."
Ekanem spoke out against the
new grading policy last year, often
putting himself at odds with the
administration.
Because of that, he said, "if
there is [tension] everyone has to
balance it with professionalism at
all times. You always run into
people with different characteris
tics that you might not agree
with, but you have to know that
in the end you have to work with
these people."
The COP members' involve
ment as student rights advocates
last year has strengthened their
position this year, Ekanem added.
The administration "knows that
the COP is willing to fight for
what the students believe is right,
and I think that was demonstrat
ed by ... our involvement with
the grading policy last year," he
said.
Alvarado and Murdock said
they would like to get more feed
back from students. "We've tried
to make ourselves as available as
possible," Murdock said.
But Ekanem said he has
received some input — and that
input has been positive. "If you
can just walk somewhere and
have people stop you and tell you
that you're doing a good job, that
really tells you something," he
said.

The formatic* 1 of a committee
which proposed amending the
special-fee process for allocating
money to student groups was an
even greater success, Murdock
said.
The amendment — which
splits graduate and undergradu
ate voting on special-fee issues,
abolishes the fee refund and caps
the total special fee, among other
things — passed the ASSU senate
last quarter, though it may be
reconsidered at the senate's next
meeting.
"I feel like we've done what no
other COP has done in this
regard, which was pulling togeth
er a group of students — gradu
ates and undergrads — to take a
long look at the whole system and
come up with a comprehensive
solution."
This quarter will be used to
inform students of the commit
tee's proposal, Murdock said.
"We hope to be in a situation

where we put the question of
reforming the special fee system
and put the full facts on that out
to the student body and ask the
student body to vote on whether

they want a sys
tem that is more
balanced and
stable and fair
than the current
system," he
said.
Also last
quarter, the
COP won stu
dent representa
tion on a Com-

mission on Undergraduate Edu
cation committee, which was not
initially going to include student
members.
"Before the COP talked with
the provost and the president,
there were not students sitting on
these committees," Lee explained.
"Those students have a lot of
great perspectives to bring to that
committee."
'Rebuilding the office'
COP members said that even
though the group has come a
long way, largely because of the
ASSU's disarray coming into
this year, there remains much to
do.
"We're still rebuilding the
office of the COP," Alvarado said.
"It really hurt us a lot not to have
a good structure in place."
This poor structure has its
history in the disappearance of
the ASSU's executive body two

years ago when a slate titled "I
Prefer Not to have a COP" won
election and promptly abolished
itself.
"This quarter we haven't done
a lot of publicity-geared things,"
she said. "It's been reorganizing
and trying to make it more effi
cient, stuff that needs to be
done."
Now that the behind-the
scenes work has been accom
plished, the COP will be more
issue-oriented, she said.
The COP will be forming
action plans this quarter based on
surveys of student concerns,
Ekanem said, but they already
have a good idea of several issues
that need to be worked on.
In addition, they are looking at
bringing back the course evalua
tion book, Lee said. "This used to
be an ASSU project and it some
how fizzled . . . Students stopped
seeing it as a resource."
The course evaluations will be
more important now that the
University has implemented a
stricter grading policy, she said,
adding that a committee is look
ing into the issue.
Ekanem said he wants to work
on "reevaluating the whole
Tresidder structure" this quarter.
Student demands for services
within Tresidder have not been
met, he said.
These and other ideas are
included in a proposal presented
fall quarter to Dean of Students
Michael Jackson by a group of
students on the Tresidder Adviso

ry Board, of which Ekanem is a
member.
These two items and other
issues that students are interest
ed in will be investigated in part
by COP interns, a program start
ing this quarter that Ekanem said
has already drawn 30 interested
applicants.
With the possibility of more
changes in tuition and more bud
get cuts, Ekanem said he will
work to "make sure they're fair to
all." Services need to "be provided
to the level that they should be,"
he said.
In his work with graduate stu
dents, Murdock said this quarter
will be focused first on education
about the special-fee process,
after which graduate students
will have the opportunity to lobby
for issues of more specific inter
est.
One new service for graduate
students is a Graduate Student's
Guide to the ASSU, that Murdock
said will be distributed early this
quarter and that he hopes can be
distributed earlier in the future.
Defining their role
Overall, members of the COP
said they hope students see them
as a valuable resource.
F'kanem said he looks at him
self as "an advocate for what peo
ple need. I see my role on a very
personal basis as really being one
of the watchdogs."
"I think I'm really straight to
the point about things that are
really important and that are

important to the students," he
said.
While the students need a
strong voice, both parties need a
facilitator, Murdock said. He said

he sees himself
as "a person who
tries to bring the
ASSU and stu
dent interests
and needs closer
in line and also
makes it such
that the Univer
sity and student
concerns more
explicitly over
lap."

"I believe that they do,' he
added, "but people aren't seeing
the connections."
His past experience as an
ASSU senator has helped him in
the facilitator role, Murdock said.
"It gave me a good familiarity
with how the senate works."
He put that experience into use
at the last senate meeting of fall
quarter when working to pass the
controversial special-fee proposal
over stiff opposition so that the
issue could be voted on by stu
dents in a January election.
"We can't expect everything to
go extremely smoothly," said
Murdock, who campaigned for the
measure at the volatile meeting.
"That's politics."
Other COP members have had
negative experiences with the
administration, but they said that
relations between the two groups
are good this year.

Alvurado, who was heavily
involved with last year's hunger
strike by Chicano students, said
that "hasn't really affected the
way they've treated me or they
way I've viewed them."
Ekanem spoke out against the
new grading policy last year, often
putting himself at odds with the
administration.
Because of that, he said, "if
there is [tension] everyone has to
balance it with professionalism at
all times. You always run into
people with different characteris
tics that you might not agree
with, but you have to know that
in the end you have to work with
these people."
The COP members' involve
ment as student rights advocates
last year has strengthened their
position this year, Ekanem added.
The administration "knows that
the COP is willing to fight for
what the students believe is right,
and I think that was demonstrat
ed by ... our involvement with
the grading policy last year," he
said.
Alvarado and Murdock said
they would like to get more feed
back from students. "We've tried
to make ourselves as available as
possible," Murdock said.
But Ekanem said he has
received some input — and that
input has been positive. "If you
can just walk somewhere and
have people stop you and tell you
that you're doing a good job, that
really tells you something," he
said.


Alvarado


Ekanem
Taking office after two years of
student government marked
largely by apathy, members of this
year's Council of Presidents be
lieve they have brought a new life
to the ASSU.
As they worked fall quarter on
issues including the Stanford
Fund and the special-fee process,
members said the group — made
up of four students of diverse
backgrounds — worked well to
gether and for the student body.
"I think it was a very produc
tive quarter," said senior Mork
Murdock, who, along with seniors
Anietie Ekanem and Lisa Lee, and
junior Vanessa Alvarado, forms
the COP.
COP members count among
their successes this year the Bus
Back the Axe initiative and placing
students on Commission on Un
dergraduate Education commit
tees.
But COP members said they
have only begun the work they
plan to accomplish this year.
What has been accomplished
this quarter goes a long way to
ward the goals for the rest of the
year, Murdock said. "Whatever we

do from here is based on how well
we set [fall] quarter up. It may not
be extremely visible as far as how
effective [fall] quarter was, but I
think [winter] quarter it will real
ly show."
"We set our goals really, really
high, and it's good that we accom
plished most of them," said
Ekanem. "But [this] quarter we're
going to be coming out even
stronger."
A 'comprehensive solution*
COP members said they have
had several successes this year al
ready.
For example, the Stanford
Fund policy, which would keep
student groups from soliciting
funding from alumni who con
tributed more than five years ago,
has been temporarily suspended
after it was challenged by students
and the COP.
Murdock said the suspension of
the policy after it was approved by
the administration is significant.
"I know of no precedent for that to
happen," he said.
A committee has been charged
with coming up with an alternate
plan to the Stanford Fund by Feb.
15. The plan itself "has some
potential," Ekanem said, "but we
don't feel comfortable putting our
full support behind it without all
the facts."
This quarter, the COP needs to
ensure that "student groups have
full access to presenting to the
working group their proposals or
concerns regarding the fund rais
ing policy," Murdock said.
The formatic* 1 of a committee
which proposed amending the
special-fee process for allocating
money to student groups was an
even greater success, Murdock
said.
The amendment — which
splits graduate and undergradu
ate voting on special-fee issues,
abolishes the fee refund and caps
