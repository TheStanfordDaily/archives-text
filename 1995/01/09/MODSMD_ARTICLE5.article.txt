# COP gearing up for future tasks
## One quarter down, student leaders reflect, plan for upcoming months 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
Taking office after two years of
student government marked
largely by apathy, members of this
year's Council of Presidents be
lieve they have brought a new life
to the ASSU.
As they worked fall quarter on
issues including the Stanford
Fund and the special-fee process,
members said the group — made
up of four students of diverse
backgrounds — worked well to
gether and for the student body.
"I think it was a very produc
tive quarter," said senior Mork
Murdock, who, along with seniors
Anietie Ekanem and Lisa Lee, and
junior Vanessa Alvarado, forms
the COP.
COP members count among
their successes this year the Bus
Back the Axe initiative and placing
students on Commission on Un
dergraduate Education commit
tees.
But COP members said they
have only begun the work they
plan to accomplish this year.
What has been accomplished
this quarter goes a long way to
ward the goals for the rest of the
year, Murdock said. "Whatever we

do from here is based on how well
we set [fall] quarter up. It may not
be extremely visible as far as how
effective [fall] quarter was, but I
think [winter] quarter it will real
ly show."
"We set our goals really, really
high, and it's good that we accom
plished most of them," said
Ekanem. "But [this] quarter we're
going to be coming out even
stronger."
A 'comprehensive solution*
COP members said they have
had several successes this year al
ready.
For example, the Stanford
Fund policy, which would keep
student groups from soliciting
funding from alumni who con
tributed more than five years ago,
has been temporarily suspended
after it was challenged by students
and the COP.
Murdock said the suspension of
the policy after it was approved by
the administration is significant.
"I know of no precedent for that to
happen," he said.
A committee has been charged
with coming up with an alternate
plan to the Stanford Fund by Feb.
