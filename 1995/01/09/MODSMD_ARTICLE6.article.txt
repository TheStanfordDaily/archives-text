# Ex-officials to pay $1M to Bookstore
## Settlement ends 2-year corruption suit 
### Burt Herman Staff writer 
Ending a two-year legal strug
gle between the California Attor
ney General's office and three for
mer Bookstore employees accused
of mismanaging funds, the Stan
ford Bookstore was awarded al
most $ 1 million from the three de
fendants in a settlement reached
last week.
Former Bookstore managers
Philip Chiaramonte and Eldon
Speed and former controller
Patrick McDonald settled a com
plaint made by the state that
charged the three with failing to
protect the Bookstore's money in
violation of the state corporations
code and its internal procedures.
An estimated $1.7 million plus in
terest was lost in the stock market
on McDonald's risky investments

under the management of Chiara
monte and Speed.
The defendants' insurance pol
icy, which has a limit of$l million,
will cover some of the Bookstore's
losses, after the state deducts
$83,000 to pay for its investigation
costs.
This represents the second and
apparently the last settlement
stemming from abuses of the non
profit organization's money. Both
suits arose from corruption
charges against the Bookstore
which originally surfaced in Feb
ruary 1992, after disclosures that
its upper-management had access
to the use of a motor home, late
model luxury cars and a vacation
home in central California.
Speed and Chiaramonte had al
ready settled the previous suit
from the state by agreeing to sell
the vacation home and give the
almost $400,000 in profits to the
Bookstore. They also gave up
retirement benefits totaling about
$100,000.
"The legal problems of the
Stanford Bookstore are now
over," said Law School Prof.
Robert Weisberg, chair of the
Bookstore's board of directors.
However, a separate civil com
plaint against McDonald remains
to be resolved. He is accused of
diverting the non-profit corpora
tion's money for personal use in a
suit involving more than $20,000.
In addition, Deputy Attorney
General James Schwartz told the

San Jose Mercury News that the
Santa Clara County District
Attorney's Office is investigating
possible criminal violations at the
Bookstore.
Schwartz could not he reached
for comment yesterday.
While the million-dollar settle
ment would seem an apparent
windfall for the embattled Book
store, the funds will be used to
replenish both the $1.7 million
stock loss and $2 million in legal
and accounting costs spent on
dealing with the legal onslaught,
Weisberg said.
"(The process] involved doing a
great deal of detective work on a
lot of complicated transactions,"
he said.
The Bookstore was able to
recover much of the loss from the
perquisite scandal by selling the

vacation home, hut the stock loss
es have been far costlier. Because
the defendants' insurance policy
had a maximum limit of $1 mil
lion, the Bookstore's manage
ment realized that recovering the
total $1.7 million loss from the
three employees' personal
finances was not feasible, Weis
berg said, adding that it was the
"best we could hope for."
As a result of controversy, the
Bookstore's internal structures
have been changed, along with
new articles and by-laws for inter
nal management in order to com
ply with the state attorney gener
al's requirements and hopefully
to prevent future trouble, Weis
berg said.
"This is now the squeakiest,
cleanest non-profit corporation in
California," he said.
