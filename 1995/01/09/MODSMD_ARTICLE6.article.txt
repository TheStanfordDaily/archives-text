# Ex-officials to pay $1M to Bookstore
## Settlement ends 2-year corruption suit 
### Burt Herman Staff writer 
Ending a two-year legal strug
gle between the California Attor
ney General's office and three for
mer Bookstore employees accused
of mismanaging funds, the Stan
ford Bookstore was awarded al
most $ 1 million from the three de
fendants in a settlement reached
last week.
Former Bookstore managers
Philip Chiaramonte and Eldon
Speed and former controller
Patrick McDonald settled a com
plaint made by the state that
charged the three with failing to
protect the Bookstore's money in
violation of the state corporations
code and its internal procedures.
An estimated $1.7 million plus in
terest was lost in the stock market
on McDonald's risky investments

under the management of Chiara
monte and Speed.
The defendants' insurance pol
icy, which has a limit of$l million,
will cover some of the Bookstore's
losses, after the state deducts
$83,000 to pay for its investigation
costs.
This represents the second and
apparently the last settlement
stemming from abuses of the non
profit organization's money. Both
suits arose from corruption
charges against the Bookstore
which originally surfaced in Feb
ruary 1992, after disclosures that
its upper-management had access
to the use of a motor home, late
model luxury cars and a vacation
home in central California.
Speed and Chiaramonte had al
ready settled the previous suit
from the state by agreeing to sell
