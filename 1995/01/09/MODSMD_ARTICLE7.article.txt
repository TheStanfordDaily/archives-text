# Diverse RAs 'shed a different light' on the subject of ethnic theme dorms
## A 						call to learn, challenge stereotypes 
### Carol Riegelman 
Other than unlocking doors in the mid
dle of the night, designing p.ograms and
counseling residents, resident assistants
in ethnic theme dorms such as Ujamaa,
Casa Zapata and Okada have to work on
building a specific ethnic community.
And those RAs and theme associates
who are not the same ethnicity as the
theme offer the community a different
perspective and set of experiences,
adding to dorm discussion and educa
tion.
Beatrice Hastings-Spaine — who orig
inally comes from Swaziland — is an RA
in Okada, the Asian-American theme
house. She said she has never felt out of
place in Okada, since she lived there her
freshman and sophomore years.
Hastings-Spaine describes Okada as a
very diverse dorm, which inherently has
a high percentage of first- and second
generation Americans.
An immigrant herself, she said she
feels she can relate to some of the resi
dents' struggles with their American
identity as their parents hold on to cul-

tural differences.
But for some of these RAs,
working in theme dorms is more
about a desire to spark debate and
touch on issues often ignored on
campus. Robert Gitin chose to
work in Ujamaa because he want
ed to become a catalyst for discus
sion.
Gitin, a white, Jewish RAin
the African-American theme
house, wanted to "facilitate con
versation" and "learn as well as
teach."
"I don't like the race relations
on campus," he said, adding that
he feels there is "a weird air of tol
erance."
Gitin described the politically
correct atmosphere pervading
Stanford and campuses across the
country as leading people away
from discussing their differences.

"Because of political correct
ness, people are not as open
about their views if their views
differ from what is accepted," he
said.
Gitin decided to work in the
African-American theme house
because he wanted to take a
proactive stance on the issue,
instead of a passive one.
He pointed out that ideas do
not go away if they are silenced,
and that he would rather have
everything out in the open.
"Racism's biggest problems
are ignorance and lack of discus
sion," Gitin said, adding that "so
many of the problems that exist
are in perception."
Sally Matlin — a white theme
associate in Casa Zapata, the Chi
cano/Latino theme house — is
helping break down such false
perceptions.
As a theme associate, she is
responsible for creating pro
grams exploring the theme of
the dorm. She said she chose to

work at Zapata because she loves
being where people are so enthu
siastic about their lives and tra
ditions.
Matlin said she thinks "Zapa-

ta is both a dorm and a learning
environment." She commented
on how frequently residents dis
cuss Chicano studies classes, cul
tural identity, multi-racial rela
tionships and issues that may
not be brought up in other
dorms.
Matlin tries to make Zapata an
open environment r or everybody,
including non-ethnic and gay res
idents whose views may some

times be lost in the masses.
"I enjoy making people think,"
she said, adding that she thinks
that, although she does fit in,
there are times when she tries not

to in order to raise a question or
an opinion that nobody else has
thought of.
Residents agree that non-eth
nic staff members bring diversi
ty to the dorm. Sometimes the
RAs "shed a different light on
the subject, but so do all the stu
dents who aren't of color," said
freshman Crystal McCreary, a
resident of Ujamaa. She said
that when that happens "it's a

positive thing always, an educa
tional thing."
This diversity is expressed in
the ethnic theme houses' image of
inclusiveness, said Zapata Resi
dent Fellow Arcadio Morales. He
mentioned that 50 percent of
dorm residents are of different
ethnicities, and it is the dorm's
responsibility to make everybody
feel welcome.
Morales emphasized that the
entire staff works to educate
other communities about the eth
nic themes and create a warm,
familial environment for their
residents.
But some staff members agree
that this image of theme houses
does not necessarily exist for the
rest of campus.
"There are some real miscon
ceptions about ethnic theme
houses. . .that they are separatist
and unwelcoming," Matlin said.
"But I think those are from peo
ple who have never spent time
here."

According to Hastings-Spaine,
living in an ethnic dorm automat
ically breaks down stereotypes.
"When you live in a theme house,
you get to see that [Asian-Ameri
cans] are very different types of
people and you can't stereotype
them," she said.
Gitin said his time in Ujamaa
has taught him more about the
black community at Stanford and
everything that it is going
through.
He has witnessed the African-
American community's reaction
to the recent death of sophomore
Jessica Williams, and seen many
members establish a new empha
sis on cherishing life and happi
ness.
But learning is not all about
other people and cultures. Daniel
Baldonado, a Chicano RAin Uja
maa, has learned a great deal
about himself.
"I love this dorm," he said.
"And I love doing what I'm
doing."

ta is both a dorm and a learning
environment." She commented
on how frequently residents dis
cuss Chicano studies classes, cul
tural identity, multi-racial rela
tionships and issues that may
not be brought up in other
dorms.
Matlin tries to make Zapata an
open environment r or everybody,
including non-ethnic and gay res
idents whose views may some

times be lost in the masses.
"I enjoy making people think,"
she said, adding that she thinks
that, although she does fit in,
there are times when she tries not

to in order to raise a question or
an opinion that nobody else has
thought of.
Residents agree that non-eth
nic staff members bring diversi
ty to the dorm. Sometimes the
RAs "shed a different light on
the subject, but so do all the stu
dents who aren't of color," said
freshman Crystal McCreary, a
resident of Ujamaa. She said
that when that happens "it's a

positive thing always, an educa
tional thing."
This diversity is expressed in
the ethnic theme houses' image of
inclusiveness, said Zapata Resi
dent Fellow Arcadio Morales. He
mentioned that 50 percent of
dorm residents are of different
ethnicities, and it is the dorm's
responsibility to make everybody
feel welcome.
Morales emphasized that the
entire staff works to educate
other communities about the eth
nic themes and create a warm,
familial environment for their
residents.
But some staff members agree
that this image of theme houses
does not necessarily exist for the
rest of campus.
"There are some real miscon
ceptions about ethnic theme
houses. . .that they are separatist
and unwelcoming," Matlin said.
"But I think those are from peo
ple who have never spent time
here."

According to Hastings-Spaine,
living in an ethnic dorm automat
ically breaks down stereotypes.
"When you live in a theme house,
you get to see that [Asian-Ameri
cans] are very different types of
people and you can't stereotype
them," she said.
Gitin said his time in Ujamaa
has taught him more about the
black community at Stanford and
everything that it is going
through.
He has witnessed the African-
American community's reaction
to the recent death of sophomore
Jessica Williams, and seen many
members establish a new empha
sis on cherishing life and happi
ness.
But learning is not all about
other people and cultures. Daniel
Baldonado, a Chicano RAin Uja
maa, has learned a great deal
about himself.
"I love this dorm," he said.
"And I love doing what I'm
doing."
