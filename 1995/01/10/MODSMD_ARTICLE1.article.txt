Stanford did not escape unscathed
from the general chaos throughout the
Bay Area resulting from this week's tor
rential downpour.
Flooding in several campus buildings
kept Stanford Police and facilities work
ers on their toes yesterday evening with
problems ranging from smoking trans
formers to a report of a person stuck for
more than an hour in a Gilbert Biological
Sciences Building elevator.
According to facilities worker John
Quesada, the University received calls
reporting smoking transformers both in
Escondido Village and in Gilbert last
night.
"They said water was pouring down
on them," he said, adding that the water
posed enough of a threat that fire crews
cordoned off the area around the Gilbert
loading dock for a time.
While inspecting the basement of
Gilbert after the water had subsided, fa
cilities worker Rick Anderson said that

earlier he had seen rooms where the rain
was "like a waterfall."
"It looked like the water was coming
out of a hose," he said.
According to Stanford Police Officer
Rich Tipton, high voltage workers have
now installed alarms on some of the
equipment in the rain-drenched build
ings to notify the police in the event of
any dangerous voltage spikes.
In addition to buildings flooded by the
rains, Tipton said that some campus
roadways filled with more than two feet
of water before crews were able to clear
out backed up storm drains.
"There were several cars people had
abandoned in the roadways after the
deep water made them stall," he said.
Fallen trees blocked a number of road
ways, such as Stanford Ave., until crews
could remove them, Tipton said, adding
that flooding also forced closure of part of
Galvez St.for a time.
While Palo Alto experienced great dif
ficulty with power outages, Tipton said
that Stanford escaped relatively un
scathed.
