# Trial starts for alleged bombers
## 100 potential jurors questioned about their feelings toward Arabs 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - The trial of a blind
Egyptian cleric and 11 other Muslims
accused of plotting bombings and assassina
tions in a "war of urban terrorism" got
under way in a heavily guarded courthouse
yesterday with prospective jurors asked
about race, religion and their feelings about
Arabs.
U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey
outlined the case to 100 potential jurors who
were crammed into the courtroom so tight
ly that 11 had to stand. At least a dozen mar
shals lined the courtroom and nearby hall
ways, and a bomb-sniffing dog with its own
photo ID checked the courtroom.
The defendants, charged with seditious
conspiracy, are accused of plotting the 1993
World Trade Center blast as well as plan
ning to bomb the United Nations and two
tunnels and a bridge connecting New York

City to New Jersey.
They also are accused of plotting to assas
sinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and kidnap or kill American politicians or
judges.
If convicted the defendants face life in
prison.
The Trade Center bombing was the only
act of terrorism actually carried out; the
alleged plot was broken up with the help of
an informant. Four men were convicted last
year in the Trade Center blast, which killed
six people and injured more than 1,000.
Prosecutors allege Sheik Omar Abdel-
Rahman was the mastermind of what they
call "a war of urban terrorism against the
United States." The 56-year-old blind cleric
turned toward the would-be jurors and
smiled when introduced.
The potential jurors were not permitted

to see handcuffs on the defendants, all of
whom were wearing suits.
The judge summarized the indictment as
describing a conspiracy to commit violent
acta "as a way of opposing the United States
and United States policy in the Middle
East."
Prosecutors have videotapes and secretly
recorded conversations obtained with the
help of an informant.
The defense maintains the men on trial
were unwittingly enlisted to perform seem
ingly innocent tasks that contributed to
alleged crimes, or were entrapped by an
overzealous informant.
Potential jurors were given 19 pages of
questions designed to weed out bias in the
search for 12 jurors and six alternates, who
will remain anonymous through what is
expected to be a six- to nine-month trial.
