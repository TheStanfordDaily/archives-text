GROZNY, Russia (AP) — Rus
sian tanks and artillery hammered
the city's heart with hundreds of
shells and rockets yesterday as out
numbered Chechen rebels fought
to hold the presidential palace and
other key installations.
Russia's human-rights commis
sioner said his government was
prepared to declare a 48-hour
cease-fire in the secessionist repub
lic, but other officials in Moscow
could not immediately confirm the
report.
Chechnya's president, whose
whereabouts have been unclear for
days, appeared on television yester
day night to comment about the
war. Technical problems muted his
message.
Russian troops pushed into
Chechen positions from several
directions on a chilly, overcast day,
and the independent news agency
Interfax said they controlled two
thirds of the capital.

Chechen fighters armed with
rocket grenades ducked in and out
of shattered buildings, trying to
knock out Russian tanks blasting
their positions. Artilleiy shells and
rockets slammed into buildings
around the palace as huge plumes
of black smoke towered over
Grozny.
There were strong indications of
preparations for another major
assault.
Several armored Russian battal
ions with dozens of tanks and
armored personnel carriers moved
toward Grozny. Others dug in at
new locations around the city.
Large transport planes carrying
Russian troops and supplies landed
every half-hour at two nearby Rus
sian air bases, apparently ferrying
in more reinforcements for the
offensive, which began Dec. 11.
The Russian government
claimed its troops had advanced to
within a few hundred yards of the

palace on two sides by midafter
noon and had the building — the
center of Chechen government —
"completely blocked." It claimed
500 Chechen fighters had been
killed by Russian troops in the pre
vious 24 hours.
Russia sent tens of thousands of
troops 1,000 miles south of Moscow
to restore Kremlin control. Several
thousand people have been killed or
wounded, and the Red Cross esti
mates 350,000 are refugees —
nearly one in four Chechen resi
dents.
With international cries for a
halt to the bloodshed growing,
Prime Minister Viktor Cher
nomyrdin reportedly said Russian
leaders were set to order a two-day
cease-fire.
"This is only the beginning of
the negotiation process," Cher
nomyrdin was quoted as saying by
Russia's human rights commis
sioner, Sergei Kovalyov.
