## Rethinking refunds 
### 
Senate's special-fee plan
is not yet satisfactory;
further change needed

THE ASSU SENATE tonight
will vote again on a proposal
to reform the special-fee sys
tem. If the proposal gains the
approval of two-thirds of the Sen
ate, a general election will be held
and the issue will be placed in the
hands of the students.
The reform proposal contains
many promising ideas for improv
ing the special-fee system. But as
the proposal stands now, it still con
tains several serious flaws that
must be addressed before the sen
ate passes it on to the students.
The proposal would amend the
ASSU Constitution to eliminate the
fee-refund process and separate the
fee voting and collection processes
into graduate and undergraduate
divisions.
The proposed amendment would
also set a limit on the total amount
of fees the senate can place on the
ballot. The special-fee ballot cap
would be annually adjusted for
inflation and could be increased or
decreased by a three-fourths vote of
the senate.
If the total amount of fee
requests exceeds the special-fee bal
lot cap, the senate would have dis
cretion to exclude some groups
from the ballot and / or decrease
the amounts of some or all of the
groups' requests.
An organization could get itself
placed on the ballot by collecting
petitions, thus bypassing this dan
ger. However, a notation would be
made on the ballot warning that the
group bypassed the senate approval
process. In addition, to receive .its
requested fee, the group would need
to be approved by 60 percent of vot
ers instead of by a majority.
The special-fee ballot cap helps
insulate students from the danger
of steadily increasing fees. But it

also introduces several new prob
lems.
First, the ballot cap would be
largely ineffectual. The level of the
cap would be generous; it would
prevent astronomical fees. But the
real danger, and students' real fear,
arises in the merely high fees that
result when a large number of
groups on the ballot are approved.
Given that fee refunds would no
longer be available, students would
be likely to vote very conservatively,
and fewer groups would get funds.
Setting a lower amount for the
special-fee ballot cap would allevi
ate this problem, but it would place
too much control over the disburse
ment of fees in the hands of the sen
ate and its appropriations commit
tee. While it is indeed important for
the senate to judge whether groups'
requests are valid, the proposal
would give the senate an inordinate
amount of power over allocating
resources among the deserving
groups. The senate would have
wide latitude in adjusting individu
al groups' fee requests. Groups that
chose to bypass the senate would
face a more difficult approval pro
cess in the election.
The proposal would be less prob
lematic if a cap were applied to the
fees actually levied rather than to
the fees placed on the ballot. Then
all groups, whether placed on the
ballot by senate approval or by peti
tion, could be treated equally in the
election. If the total amount of fee
requests approved exceeded this
cap, all approved fees could be
decreased proportionally until the
total amount of fees matched the
cap. Students could vote with confi
dence and still be assured that they
would not pay unreasonably high
fees.
In its current form, the proposal
would likely be rejected by voters
who fear paying high, nonrefund
able fees. The senate owes it to its
constituents to modify the proposed
amendment to eliminate the diffi
culties of the ballot cap. Then vot
ers can pass the special-fee reform
with confidence.
