## The 						need for spirituality 
### 
Distribution requirements
have never been very popular at
Stanford. Nonetheless, I would like
to see another discipline added to the list of
supposedly essentud subjects: spirituality.
We seem to be learning more and more
about narrow theoretical topics, and in the
process we are forgetting about our reality
as human beings. As I view the climate of
Stanford and the world in general, I see we
have become more and more extroverted,
at great expense. We are now struggling
with the general discomfort which results
as we neglect our spiritual side in favor of a
more superficial relationship with self and
others.
Before I detail the danger I perceive in
such a trend, I must admit that claiming a
spiritual crisis is not something that I do
with a wealth of empirical data backing me
up. Admittedly, much of my concern stems
from a personal sentiment that comes more
from my limited experiences and observa
tions than from any scientific research.
Ironically, this is just my point, for the typ
ical research paradigm is ineffective in ana
lyzing spirituality. Our connection with our
spiritual dimension is deeply rooted, mak
ing access to it extremely complicated for
the outsider. In an era where "proof' takes
precedence over "faith," the challenge to
reinfuse spirituality is great.
I fear that Stanford suffers from an
overly academic temperament. Increased
understanding of self is something that is
assumed to be a by-product of the liberal

Stanford education. The process of living
and taking classes with other students has
always fostered reflection and discussion
beyond a purely academic plane. Modern
society threatens this dynamic process,
however. High technology and harsh mar
ket economics dictate that students special
ize to an unprecedented degree. For exam
ple, in reaction to this trend, the adminis
tration has considered a three-year under
graduate cirriculum, which would leave 25
percent leas time for the introspection and
spiritual growth I consider essential. Stu
dents aren't protesting; they generally
want to "move on" quickly.
Meanwhile, crime rates, suicide rates
and divorce rates continue at frighteningly
high levels. Prozac is the drug of the '90s,
and people escape further through video
games and heavy metal music rather than
through reading or writing, both of which
promote connection with our spiritual
dimension. As with many social trends,
there is only a correlation, rather than a
clear cause and effect, between spirituality
and community stability and happiness. As
future leaders, students are obligated to
assess the strength of that correlation. I
find it extremely persuasive.
Encouragingly, many people have recog
nized the gap in our knowledge about our
selves and our relationship to others; they
have begun to narrow that gap by exploring
various forms of spiritual exercise such as
meditation, psychic readings and astrology.
Unfortunately, such "New Age" activities

are considered out of the mainstream.
Someone who does yoga is often only an
interesting anomaly for those who have
neglected their spiritual side. Practicing
Buddhism may be "cool," but often isn't
taken seriously. None of this fits into our
fast-paced, competitive culture, nor does it
find a clear niche among the traditional
course offerings at Stanford.
It is amazing for me to discover how lit
tle Stanford students understand about
each other's studies. My friends took class
es whose title alone confused me. They
couldn't even begin to explain the basic
premises of the course. At the same time,
my specific studies within human biology
were often completed foreign to my friends.
This is still the greatest disappointment of
my undergraduate experience.
An infusion of spirituality is essential in
order to repair the rift which is developing
and to create some common ground among
increasingly isolated disciplines. Of course,
it could never be implemented in the formal
sense of a distribution requirement.
Instead, every member of the Stanford
community needs to consider spirituality,
and its ability to enhance the already strong
sense of family which exists here.
