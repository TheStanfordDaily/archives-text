# SAE fraternity retains its house
## Placed on probation until 1998, SAEs will appeal disciplinary actions 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
While a recent University deci
sion allows Sigma Alpha Epsilon
to keep its house, members of the
fraternity say they may appeal
the University disciplinary ac
tions which keep the group on so
cial probation this academic year
and its housing status in jeopardy
through 1998.
"The communication between
the University and SAE through
all this has been horrendous,"
said SAP] president Geoff Haft.
The actions "have been mainly ar
bitrary."
After hearing recommenda
tions from a committee formed
last quarter to examine the frater

nity as a student group, Dean of
Students Michael Jackson and
Assoc. Dir. of Residential Educa
tion Diana Conklin sent a letter to
the fraternity last month, notify
ing its members of the chosen dis
ciplinary actions.
In addition to leaving SAE on
social probation for the rest of the
academic year, the letter states
that if any SAE member is con
victed of a non-academic offense
by the University or the Greek ju
dicial board from now until July
1, 1998, the University may "re
move recognition of the fraterni
ty" and may "ask its members to
vacate" their house.
"We want to stress the collec
tive responsibility concept. This
has been difficult with this
group," Conklin said. "We want
to get it through to them that
they need to exercise responsibil
ity for all its members."
The fraternity was originally
placed on social probation fall quar
ter as a result of a bonfire held by
graduating seniors in the house's
backyard, at 521 Campus Drive,
last spring — an activity held after
a specific prohibition by University
officials.
The bonfire, in addition to other
behavioral problems by SAE mem
bers, led to the formation fall quar
ter of a committee charged with
looking into the fraternity as a stu
dent organization.
The letter which the SAEs
received from Conklin and Jackson
included several reasons for the dis
ciplinary actions, stating, "the
chapter must learn that collective
responsibility means that every
member is obligated to act to deter
irresponsible behavior and that
every member will bear the conse
quences of the misconduct of any
member."
Haft, however, is displeased
with the University's decision.
"[The 1998 clause] is ridiculous in
my mind and will have to be looked
at. Collective responsibility is poor
ly defined. ... They had no prece
dent or guidelines [for the deci
sion]."
Haft added that SAE members
plan to appeal the disciplinary
actions.
In addition to the "1998
clause" and the social probation,
the fraternity will need to hold
four educational programs each
year through 1998 which all mem
bers will be required to attend.
The programs will cover hazing,
drug and alcohol abuse, gender
topics — such as date rape — and
the issue of collective responsibili
ty.
SAE members will also be

required to attend three meetings
this month — one with alumni,
another with representative staff
and the dean of students and the
final one with representatives from
the national SAE chapter. Partici
pants at these meetings will go over
the reasons for the disciplinary
actions.
Conklin stressed that having all
members present at these meeting
was crucial. "The officers are doing
their best ... but they can't do it
alone," she said. "Every member
has to take responsibility and also
look out for their brothers."
Written reports are also
required after each meeting and
will have to be turned into the
Office of the Dean of Students.
"These are meetings we do anyway.
We're just putting in writing what
we already do," Haft said.
The University has also man
dated that SAE revise its chapter
and pledge education handbooks to
stress the idea of collective respon
sibility and to include a history of
the events which led to the present
situation.
"The group needs to have an
ongoing memory of what happened
so that they don't fall into the same
trap over and over again," Conklin
said.
Behavioral incidents cited by the
University over the past three
years included Rush violations in
spring of 1993 and the citation of
five SAE members found intoxicat
ed in the fall of 1992. Three of the
five members were under the legal
drinking age at the time.
"These are problems we dealt
with years ago," Haft said. "The
University was happy with our
progress .. . and now they dig it all
up again."
Conklin said she hopes the
actions will strengthen the frater
nity. "This is a strong group with a
long and positive history. It's only
been in the last few years that prob
lems have arisen."
In spite of the actions, Haft said
he was confident the fraternity will
"work through it. |The members]
love this place. The traditions
speak for themselves."
