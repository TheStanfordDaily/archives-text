Argument against chastity used improper definition

IN HIS Nov. 30 LETTER to the editor
stating concern about perceived
"philosophical sloppiness of the argu
ments" for chastity, Stewart Richardson
gave a definition of lust that is not what
Professor Raymond Dennehy of the Uni
versity of San Francisco used in his lec
tures concerning virtue last quarter.
According to Websters Dictionary, lust
in sexual matters is "sexual desire of a
violent or self-indulgent character." Thus
Prof. Dennehy said that lust is a disor
dered desire of the will, a vice which pro
duces moral blindness, the inability to see
the other person as a person. For exam
ple, a businessman who lusts for money
and is trying to sell you something will see
you as a source of money, not as a person.
The definition Stewart Richardson gave,
"longing, desire, sexual appetite, or crav
ing," is simply the normal desire or
appetite for sex, which of course in of

itself is very good. This is not the defini
tion of lust we referred to. Therefore,
Richardson's conclusion about sloppiness
of reasoning does not follow.
The argument "if the members of the
group had practiced what they preached
...focuses attention on our personal
lives rather than the discussion about pre
marital sex. This is a classical fallacy in
logic called an ad hominem argument, one
that does not deal with the issue at hand
but rather distracts from the issue itself.
For example, a person could defend
apartheid in South Africa by saying that
the person arguing against it is "pious
and arrogant." This of course has nothing
to do with the argument about whether or
not apartheid is immoral. And so in our
case, the philosophy of virtues is not
something we have invented through our
personal experiences; it is a philosophy
that has been developed and tested

through the centuries of human experi
ence of people of many different back
grounds, personal lives, cultures and
faiths.
The main point of Prof. Dennehy's lec
tures on virtue was that we are free and
responsible beings. We can choose good or
evil in our thoughts and our actions. Tem
perance with regard to sexual matters
builds up one's character and helps one be
a better person, we believe. With the vast
majority of issues that we face, there are
no clear-cut answers; however, there may
be better ways of living in a small subset
of issues, such as respecting life by not
killing the innocent or respecting other
people's property by not stealing. When it
comes to premarital sex, we believe that
sex is more than just a physical act; it is a
statement of unconditiond love. Yes, cer
tain conclusions follow from this; yet we
are willing to stand by the premise.

The most important virtue is charity.
Love for one's fellow neighbor can be
maintained in charitable discourse with
out personal attacks. Thus we can dis
agree with each other's ideas yet engage
in fruitful conversation while respecting
each other as people, as human beings
with an inherent dignity and worth. Clari
fying misunderstandings as to what we
meant by lust and how it relates to virtue
is exactly why we felt the need for our
group to exist.
