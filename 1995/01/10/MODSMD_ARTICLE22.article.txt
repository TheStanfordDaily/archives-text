# Frosh less politically minded, survey says
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
Though a recent national survey says univer
sity freshmen are less interested in politics than
ever, some resident fellows and others in contact
with freshmen at Stanford say politics are as hot
a topic as ever.
Others, however, say politics have never been
big at Stanford and that hasn't changed.
"I was kind of stunned [the reports | were say
ing they were that apathetic," said Branner res
ident fellow Kennell Jackson.
The survey, conducted by the Higher Educa
tion Research Institute at UCLA, reported that
today's freshmen are less interested in politics
than ever before in the survey's 29-year history.
After polling 333,703 students at 670 Ameri
can two- and four-year colleges and universities,
the survey found that less than one-third of col
lege freshmen place keeping up with politics as a
priority.
Only 16 percent of students who entered col
lege in the fall of 1994 said that they discuss pol
itics frequently.
1968, the year of a presidential election dur
ing the Vietnam warm, was the point at which

the percentage of students who had frequent
political debates was highest.
But Jackson called any comparison to the
1960s "a ludicrous kind of analogy."
The 1990s are bringing out a "different
expression of politics," he said. "I think people
are engaged in politics."
Ania Loomba and Suvir Kaul, RFs at Tran
cos, disagreed.
Loomba said that while she cannot compare
Stanford's freshmen from several years ago to
today's, "with my experience with students
elsewhere, I would say, yes, they are less inter
ested."
To her, Stanford students seem "not particu
larly globally informed," Loomba said.
She said she has talked to faculty members
who have been at Stanford longer than her, and
they see less political action now than two or
three decades ago.
According to Jackson, however, "the political
system never lets up."
Calling Stanford a "politically conscious"
campus rather than a "politically active" one,
Jackson explained that "an awful lot of informa
tion comes into Stanford. There are a lot of very
intelligent people here . .. You're bound to find
