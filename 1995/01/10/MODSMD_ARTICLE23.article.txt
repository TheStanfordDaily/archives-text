# Fixing a hole where the rain comes in?
## Rained out of her Zapata room, student moves to converted lounge 
### Tristan Sorah Reyes Contributing writer 
Senior Grace Lee came back from winter
break to a surprising sight. On the door of her
Casa Zapata room was a letter from her resi
dent fellow saying Facilities had deemed her
room "uninhabitable."
Lee discovered Sunday that the leak which
she considered minor when she left school in
December had grown so large that the Univer
sity could no longer allow her to inhabit her
room.
"Now, instead of a little pan catching the
water there is a three-foot high bucket," said
Ijee.
Richard Daniels, project coordinator for
Housing and Dining Maintenance Services,
said, "The room is condemned but no one is in
danger, there is no threat whatsoever of any
thing falling down or caving in."

Now Lee and all of her belongings — as well
as a new roommate who was planning to move
into the now-condemned room — have new
lodgings in what was formerly Zapata's third
floor lounge.
According to her possessions were not
harmed by the water. "They put some walls up
and a door around the lounge and built my
roommate and me a new room there," said I x'e.
According to Daniels, water is leaking from
Zapata's roof, coming down a copper pipe in t he
air ventilation and heating system, and ending
up in room. Housing and Facilities work
ers opened a wall so they could monitor the sit -
uation daily.
Daniels said Lee was moved to new living
quarters because the University felt the leak
and the constant presence of workmen would
inconvenience her.
