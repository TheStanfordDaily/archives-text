Making its second appointment of the aca
demic year, the Board of Trustees elected elec
tronics entrepreneur Winston H. Chen to a
five-year term last month.
"I think it's a great honor," he said. Stan
ford "is a great institution. I hope I can con
tribute in the future."
As a nine-year chief executive officer of
Solectron Corp., the second-largest electron
ics contract manufacturer in North Ameri
ca, Chen advanced sales to $1.45 billion
while also winning the Malcolm Balarige
National Quality Award in 1991 and the Cal
ifornia Golden State Quality Award. In addi
tion, the Milipitas-based company grew from
30 to 7,000 employees during his tenure, he
said.
At Stanford, Chen serves on both the
Humanities and Sciences Council and the
board of the Center for Economic Policy

Research.
Chen is currently a member of both the
Board of Trustees of Santa Clara University
and of the National Science Foundation's
Engineering Advisory Board.
In a new era of collegiate competition,
Chen said he hopes to promote international
issues and globalization of the University.
"Universities compete for good students,
funding and faculty. In general, my observa
tion is that the funding is getting tougher and
tougher" to find, he said.
He said the University should also examine
the amount of money it receives from the fed
eral government.
"In case the government and budget
declines, what is going to happen to Stan
ford?" he asked.
Chen, 53, earned his civil engineering
degree at National Cheng Kung University in
Taiwan before attending Harvard University,
where he earned his master's degree and doc
torate in applied mechanics and mathematics

respectively.
Chen now chairs the Paramitas Founda
tion, a Santa Clara philanthropic organiza
tion. He is also a director of Intel Corp.
He said his contributions will be both from
"a minority Asian-American standpoint as
well as for the overall long-term strategy for
Stanford in the future."
While Chen said he believes major focuses
must be on "budgeting, maintaining vitality
and new blood, and continuous excellence in
the faculty," he added that it will take time
before he establishes specific programs.
"I am the new kid on the block," he said.
"I'm trying to pick up my speed. It will take
me awhile."
Chen is the second board member to be
elected during this academic year. Isaac Stein
was elected in September.
The Board also reelected George Hume to
a second five-year term. Hume is president
and chief executive officer of Basic American
Inc.
