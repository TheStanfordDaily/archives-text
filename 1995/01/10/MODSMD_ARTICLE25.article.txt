## High hopes for gymnasts Talented women's team ranked No. 9 
### Ben Hur Contributing writer 
This winter, Stanford women's
gymnastics coach Breck Green
wood has a unique problem. He
may have too much talent.
Despite the absence of
Olympian Dominique Dawes
from the Stanford roster, the
1995 squad could be the best the
Farm has ever seen. Led by
seniors Jene Elzie, Katie Clancy,
Meegan Lannin and Tina Snow
den, along with a standout fresh
man class, the Cardinal squad has
been ranked ninth in the nation.
Gymnastics is a sport of preci
sion and accuracy, requiring
nerves of steel and a desire for
perfection. Unlike in most sports,
the chief opponent is not the
other team.
"Our opponents are the vault,
the beam and the bars," Green
wood said. "What the squad we're
competing against does has little
effect on us. Of course some
schools tend to get us especially
fired up, but we don't even scout.
No school really does."
Six gymnasts compete in each
of four events — the vault,
uneven bars, the balance beam
and the floor exercise, with the
top five scores in each counting
towards the overall team score. A
gymnast who competes in all four
events is considered an all
arounder.
Plagued by a lack of depth and
inconsistent vault performances
last year, Stanford finished 26th
in the country last season, a dis
appointment for a team that had
finished 10th just two years
before.
So what did Greenwood and
his staff do following the 1994
season? They simply signed some
of the best recruits in the nation:
Christie Jones, Keri Monahan,
Misty Moore and Amy Neil, four
all-arounders who are prepared to
make a major impact on the Car
dinal program. The addition of
sophomore vault specialist Amy
Paris to the roster also improved
Stanford's outlook.
The highly touted freshmen
join a team already loaded with
talent and experience. Co-captain
Elzie, the team's most powerful
gymnast and best all-arounder,
holds several school records and
was named an All-American as a
freshmen.

"This is the most excited I've
ever been," Elzie said. "It's just
amazing to be in the gym with so
much talent and energy."

Clancy, returning from a knee
injury that forced her to miss all
of last season, is almost fully

recovered and excited to compete.
"We're heading toward having
the best year since I've been
here," Clancy said. "As freshmen,
we went to nationals and finished
10th in the nation. As seniors, we
want to finish even stronger."
Sophomore Katie Jennings,

who suffered from chronic <
injuries during the 1994 cam- .!
paign, could potentially be one of
the best all-arounders in the ;
country this year.
"I think we've got her injuries
under control this year," Green
wood said. "She isn't 100 percent,
but despite her injuries, she per- ;
formed extremely well last sea
son. She can compete hurt."
Despite the surplus of talent
for the few spots available, the
Cardinal squad appears to be a
close-knit group focused on suc
cess.
"Everyone has a good attitude,
and there is a winning feeling on
this team," said Jennings. "We
will be a force in the Pac-10 and at 1
nationals." *

Perhaps the team's strongest all-arounder, senior co-captain Jene Elzie is one reason the Cardinal

probably has the advantage, since
the Pac-10 Championships are
being held there."
In order to accomplish its goal
of competing in the NCAA
National Championships, the
Cardinal women will have to
establish themselves as one of the
best teams in the conference and
must place among the top 12
teams in the U.S.
"That is exactly what we're
going to do," Greenwood said.
Both coach and athletes are
poised to make their presence felt
on the rest of the gymnastics
world. "We all want to show
everyone what we're made of,"
Clancy said.
