# Back on track
## Wrestlers excel at tourneys

Members of the Stanford wrestling
team had more on their minds over the
holidays than just mistletoe and eggnog.
Competing in the Oregon Classic and the
Midlands Championship on Dec. 29, and
the Country Classic Open on Sunday, the
Cardinal began the new year with two
strong showings.
"[Winter break] went well," said head
coach Chris Horpel. "It gave us time to
heal but our conditioning has slipped.
We're not in as good a shape as when we
left."
Junior co-captain Jimmy Aguirre and
junior Tod Surmon, who were previously
injured, competed for the first time this
year at the Cal State Bakersfield Country
Classic. The 134-pound Aguirre and Sur
mon (150 lbs.), who both placed 13th at

the NCAA Championships last year, fin
ished second and fourth, respectively, in
their weight classes.
"Things looked pretty good," Horpel
said. "Aguirre and Surmon are ready for
competition but aren't at 100 percent."
The Cardinal now has nine of its 10
starters back. The only injured starter,
junior 167-pounder Sahlan Martin with a
neck injury, may return for this Satur
day's Aggie Open at UC-Davis.
The team's health was not the only pos
itive for Stanford over the vacation. Senior
co-captain Jay Jackson and junior Matt
Cano shone in their matches, Horpel said.
Jackson placed first at the Country
Classic and second at the Oregon Classic
in the 134 lbs. division, and Cano took
first and third at 126 lbs. Cano had sweet
revenge with pins over Cal State Bakers-
