# Tennis teams take a swing at Classic
## Individuals shine, but whole team lacks usual dominance 
### Courtney Mann Contributing writer 
The Cardinal put forth an impres
sive showing at the National Collegiate
Tennis Classic in Mission Hills, Calif,
last weekend, boasting both a women's
singles and a men's doubles champi
onship. Katie Schlukebir continued her
strong play of the young season as she
defeated top seeded Keri Phebus of
UCLA in the finals 0-6, 7-6, 6-3.
The freshman tandem of Scott
Humphries and Paul Goldstein earned
their second consecutive doubles cham
pionship, emerging from the final with
a 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (1) win over Mississippi
State University's Joe Simmons and
Matt Pledger.
Down 0-6 and 2-5 in the second set,
Schlukebir staged a tremendous come
back in the championship match as she
physically wore Phebus out, winning
five straight games and the tiebreaker
to take the second set. With momentum
on her side, Schlukebir took advantage
of a tired Phebus, capitalizing for a 6-3
set, match and tournament victory.
After a first round bye, Humphries
and Goldstein, fresh off a Rolex doubles
championship, cruised to the final
round, playing the minimum four
matches. They dropped only one set in
the entire tournament, a 5-7 loss in the
championship match.
"It was nice to see our two freshman
win our first title there since 1977,"
said men's head coach Dick Gould.
However, Stanford's performance
outside of Schlukebir, Humphries and
Goldstein lacked its usually übiquitous
dominance. The top three Cardinal
seeds in the men's singles bracket,
senior Jeff Salzenstein (2), Humphries
(6) and Goldstein (7), failed to advance
past the second round.
"I think all teams went in a little
cold," Gould said. "We hadn't played in
a month and a half, but we wanted to
get back in the swing of things and it
really got everyone in the right frame of
mind."
Junior Jim Thomas proved to be
Stanford's giant killer, however, shock
ing top seed Chad Clark of the Univer
sity of Texas in the second round by a

score of 7-5, 4-6, 6-4. Thomas then con
tinued to make a name for himself by
effectively upsetting fifth-seeded
Robert Janecek from UCLA in the next
round.
"Jim just played outstanding. His
style of play was exceptional," Gould

said.
Stanford went no further than the
quarterfinals in this bracket. Compara
tively, the Cardinal placed three players
into the semi-finals of its previous tour-
