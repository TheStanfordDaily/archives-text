# Osborne has what it takes
## 'Husker leader an exemplar coach, person 
### 
For Tom Osborne, head coach of the Nebras
ka Cornhuskers, life must be pretty good
right now. Approaching the new year
blessed with hometown heroism, widespread
respect and blissful memories of an undefeated
season, Osborne is the likely envy of college foot
ball coaches far and wide.
And now that he's led his team to an improba
ble victory over Miami in the 1994 Orange Bowl,
legitimately captured the postseason No. 1 rank
ings and won the hearts of old and new 'Husker

fans, what does Osborne plan to do?
Spend some time with the family, grant a few
interviews and get on with it. No keggers, autobi
ography sells or gloating from this man — far
from it.
For Osborne is not just a coach of good charac
ter, but a man of the same. He preserves the very
basic ideals of sports and competition, mid holds
sacred the sometimes forgotten concepts of
integrity and sportsmanship. This is a man who
lectures his team on the importance of doing well
in school. This is a man who doesn't allow his
players to rejoice in the endzone. This is a man
who passed up offers to coach the pros even dur
ing the toughest times.
He coaches with a firm hand, extensive knowl
edge and even some heart. This is a man who prac
tices what he preaches.
Of course he makes his mistakes. Juggling his
quarterbacks, making sketchy decisions and per
haps relying too much on his favorite players may
have made the Orange Bowl a less-than-perfect
outing for the 'Huskers. His other major fault —
not cracking a grin until the bowl victoiy celebra
tions were well underway — seems to be the norm
among big-time coaches these days.
Osborne takes his public victories in stride, but
we don't see the private challenges that coaching
brings. It can't be an easy task. Although I've

never tried it, I imagine that balancing the wants
of the players with the needs of the team would
make the job a constant battle of compromises
and principles. Do I play the starting five the
entire way through, or do I play the whole team so
it's a collaborative effort? Do I call for the punt or
go for it? Do I use our mile runner in the relay or
save her for the sure win?
logistical decisions would be the least of it. The
biggest challenge would come in the querying looks
on the faces of my team as they ask in the big
crunch: "So now what, Coach?" Consult the clip
board, take a deep breath, perhaps make a quick
plea for divine intervention and then act on instinct.
Like Osborne, I'd win some, lose some, and (if
I'm lucky) unveil others' athletic potential and
pride in the process. Unlike Osborne, I would
probably boast of the wins and whine at the loss
es. So much of my personal success rides on what
I'm able to do for others. That's a lesson Osborne
probably learned a long time ago.
I remember now the many coaches who I've
had in my nefarious past. There was Stan, the
expectorating Spanish teacher who doubled as a
basketball coach in my JV days; Mark, the neigh
borhood's good guy who hosted weekly hot-dog
roast/pool parties for my recreational soccer team;
Coach Thorne, who ran with us in our track drills;
and of course Coach Baumann, my high school
hoops guru, whose vocabulary included words
such as "verticality" and "tenacity." You don't
hear many coaches shout inspirational gems like
that at their players anymore.
Coaches are teachers, guidance counselors,
parents, mentors and cheerleaders wrapped up
into a neat package. They're disciplinarians and
role models, whistle-toting ringleaders and play
calling captains. They're also friends, and in the
worst case, authoritarians. Every coach I've had,
from the age of four to 18, taught me something,
gave me something. It's an enormous responsibil
ity to self and to others, and perhaps that's the
biggest challenge of all.
Like his players' parents and teachers, and
maybe even to a greater degree in some cases,
Osborne believes in his team and has a very per
sonal stake in it. Maybe he's seen the querying
looks a million times, but he's intent on victory.
And not just the scoreboard kind, either.

Osborne may be able to coach, but not even the best
could beat the Chargers. Kinda like the 'Huskers
— it's about time ....
