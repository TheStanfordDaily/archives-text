For his tremendous collegiate career as the Cardinal's record-setting quarterback, senior Steve Sten
strom was recently named the 1994 Pop Warner Award winner. The award represents Stenstrom's des
ignation as the top senior football player on the West Coast. Stenstrom's efforts landed him seventh on
the all-time NCAA passing chart, with 10,531 career yards passing. Stenstrom, who set 11 school and
seven Pacific 10 Conference records, will be honored in early February by the award's sponsor, the
PALO Club, a non-profit organization which benefits youth sports in the San Francisco Bay Area. The
same awards ceremony will also honor the 1994 Morris Trophy winners: Chad Eaton of Washington
State and Tony Boselli of USC.
