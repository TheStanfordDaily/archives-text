# ASSU will revisit special-fee issue
## No 'sweatshirt distractions' at revote 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
After a meeting last month
dominated by questions of sweat
shirts and vote-changing, the
ASSU Senate prepares to address
the recommendations of the Spe
cial Fee Reform Task Force for a
second time at its meeting
tonight.
Though the bill narrowly
passed the senate with two-thirds
approval during last quarter's
Dead Week meeting, the propos
al's passage hinged on the fact
that two graduate senators were
disqualified from voting because
they were not wearing the sen
ate's sweatshirt uniform.
In the confusion that followed,
a motion to reconsider the legisla

tion was passed just before the
meeting adjourned. As a result, a
second vote on the measure will be
taken today.
Senators were reluctant to pre
dict the outcome of tonight's deci
sion, but all agree it will be a close
vote. Last meeting, the bill passed
only after Senate Chair Nawwar
Kasrawi cast the deciding vote.
"It seemed it reached a point
where it wasn't even about the bill
anymore, it was about your side
winning," said graduate student
Karen Seta, who chaired the task
force that wrote the proposal. "I
hope it doesn't come down to a
personal level, but I'm afraid it
will."
Many added t hat tonight's vote
will not be characterized by the
same distractions as last time.
"What happened last time was
sketchy, but I think that won't
happen," said undergraduate sen
ator Smeeta Ramarathnam, who
changed her last vote from yes to
abstention, and then to no in
response to Kasrawi's ruling that
graduate senators Julie Cantor
and Lowell Hawkins were ineligi
ble to vote because they were not

wearing their
sweatshirts.
"I don't think
the bill would
have passed last
time if it hadn't
been for the
sweatshirts,"
said undergrad
uate senator
Stephen Russell.

"You can bet anyone who forgot
their [sweatshirt] last time won't
do so again."
Senators seemed confused
about whether the senate will
need to pass another motion to
reconsider before uiking a vote.
Undergraduate senator Andre
Vanier said he believes that under
Robert's Rules of Order — which
govern the senate's parliamen
tary procedure — a new motion to
reconsider should be taken

because the old
one was inter
rupted by the
motion to
adjourn.
Though Kas
rawi originally
ruled that
another motion
to reconsider
would be neces-

sary, he noted that he has since
changed his mind, and the senate
will go straight into deliberation
of the bill itself.
"Basically, I was very confused
about what was going on at the
end of that meeting," Kasrawi
said. "Once a motion [to reconsid
er] is passed, it resorts to the
exact moment right before the
vote took place."
Senate parliamentarian
Michelle Gee also noted that, even
though a second vote should be
taken after the motion to recon
sider is passed, adjournment
before the reconsidered vote does
not violate rules.
"It's a 'privileged motion' — if
a majority of people don't want to
be there, they shouldn't have to,"
she said, adding that the senate
will now resume at the place it left
off.
Kasrawi said he is not yet sure
whether to allow debate before a
vote is taken. "I'm leaning
toward having a vote [without
debate], but it's up to the sen
ate," he said.
