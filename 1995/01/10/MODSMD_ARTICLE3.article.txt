# ASSU will revisit special-fee issue
## No 'sweatshirt distractions' at revote 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
After a meeting last month
dominated by questions of sweat
shirts and vote-changing, the
ASSU Senate prepares to address
the recommendations of the Spe
cial Fee Reform Task Force for a
second time at its meeting
tonight.
Though the bill narrowly
passed the senate with two-thirds
approval during last quarter's
Dead Week meeting, the propos
al's passage hinged on the fact
that two graduate senators were
disqualified from voting because
they were not wearing the sen
ate's sweatshirt uniform.
In the confusion that followed,
a motion to reconsider the legisla

tion was passed just before the
meeting adjourned. As a result, a
second vote on the measure will be
taken today.
Senators were reluctant to pre
dict the outcome of tonight's deci
sion, but all agree it will be a close
vote. Last meeting, the bill passed
only after Senate Chair Nawwar
Kasrawi cast the deciding vote.
"It seemed it reached a point
where it wasn't even about the bill
anymore, it was about your side
winning," said graduate student
Karen Seta, who chaired the task
force that wrote the proposal. "I
hope it doesn't come down to a
personal level, but I'm afraid it
will."
