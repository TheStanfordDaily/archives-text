# 'Sandblasting' off
## Sanders hosting MTV show 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
Summer Sanders has moved from the pool to the beach.
The former Stanford student and 1992 Olympic gold
medalist has switched venues to tackle a new challenge —
hosting MTV's new program "Sandblast."
For Sanders, no stranger to either celebrity or televi
sion, "Sandblast" represents a change Ln her television per
sona. No longer the analytical swimming commentator


Summer Sanders
seen on CBS, Sanders is perky
and crazy as she leads teams
through beach events.
"Sandblast is different than
other shows out there because it
has crazy events and raw com
petition," said Sanders, a com
munication major who left Stan
ford after summer quarter.
"The contestants really get into
it and my adrenaline really gets
pumping.
"The difference between work
ing for CBS and MTV was huge.
For M'lV you have to be hyper —
which I have no problem with.
Hut I felt comfortable commen
tating for CBS because I know
more about swimming than I do
about anything else," said
Sanders. "Working for MTV has
definitely been more challenging
than my earlier jobs."
MTV prefers to call "Sand
blast" an athletic competition
and not a game show. Sanders
said she believes she was cast as
host in order to lend athletic
credibility to the program, which
features teams of one woman and
one man.
Sanders said the teams are
"real people," and not super
human types like the competitors
from "American Gladiators."
"The competitors were
extending themselves to their
limits," Sanders said. "They
wanted to win."
During the month of October
Sanders filmed 50 episodes of
"Sandblast" on the beaches of
Orlando, Fla.
"It was a lot of pressure," she
said. "We would wake up at 6:30

a.m. and we wouldn't leave the
set until about 6 p.m."
In order to take advantage of
the daylight, the filming schedule
was packed tight. On Wednes
days, Thursdays and Sundays,
Sanders would film two episodes
of "Sandblast." On Fridays, three
episodes would be filmed, and on
Saturdays, four.
Although the deadlines were
strict, Sanders choose to look at
the work as a challenge. "We had
to get these things out," she said.
"They had to be done."
Narrating the events and
interviewing the contestants
helped Sanders earn more than a
tan while filming in the Florida
sun.
Because "Sandblast' was
filmed so quickly Sanders often
did not have time to memorize all
of her lines and was forced to ad
lib.
"It was the most pressure I've
had since the Olympics or since I
swam," she said. "It has made me
more comfortable around the
camera."
The lessons Sanders learned
about how to be confident and
relaxed on camera are "nothing
any class at Stanford University
will ever teach you," she said.
With just four units left until
graduation, Sanders plans to
complete her education at UCLA
so she can be near her boyfriend,
former Stanford football player
Jimmy Klein.
While Sanders said that every
thing she learned at Stanford was
useful, she said she would have
benefited from classes that were
more specific to her field.
"I'd like to be a television
sports journalist," she said. "I
love sports and I feel pretty com
fortable in front of the TV."
