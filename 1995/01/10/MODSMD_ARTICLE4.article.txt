## Sanders hosting MTV show 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
Summer Sanders has moved from the pool to the beach.
The former Stanford student and 1992 Olympic gold
medalist has switched venues to tackle a new challenge â€”
hosting MTV's new program "Sandblast."
For Sanders, no stranger to either celebrity or televi
sion, "Sandblast" represents a change Ln her television per
sona. No longer the analytical swimming commentator
