# Shoven reviews ethnic studies reports
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
After more than seven months of re
search and discussion, the Asian-Ameri
can Studies and Chicano Studies commit
tees have turned in their final reports on
schedule to Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven.
Shoven declined to outline the specifics
of either report, saying that he was in the
process of evaluating the committees' rec
ommendations. He said he plans to pre
sent the reports and his comments to the

Faculty Senate on Jan. 26.
"Right now I'm working on determin
ing what is feasible," he said. "I'm looking
at what offers the most intellectual ex
citement and integrity . . . and what
would be the best for both students and
faculty."
Shoven said he "hopes to give the sen
ate a sense of the direction that I would
like to take this."
The senate will most likely discuss the
Asian-American Studies and Chicano
Studies reports in general terms on Jan.
26, rather than vote on specific recom

mendations. If votes are required, they
will probably come later in the year,
Shoven added.
Whether or not the senate takes action
on any of the recommendations depends
on their nature. For example, if either
committee recommends the formation of
a new interdisciplinary program, the sen
ate must approve the change.
The two committees — formed in the
wake of a hunger strike and other student
protests last spring — did "serious and
dedicated" work throughout the
summer and fall, said Assoc. Dean
of Undergraduate Studies Ram6n
Saldivar, who chaired the Chicano
Studies committee.
"I'm tremendously pleased
with the amount of effort that
went into the reports," Saldivar
said. "The end result is reports
that are reasonable and effective
and will make a good contribution
to Stanford."
However, Saldivar refused to
speculate on the likelihood of the
implementation of the reports'
recommendations. He also
declined to comment on specific
recommendations in either report.
While the two ethnic studies
committees have wrapped up their
work, a third committee is still

putting the finishing touches on
its report.
The Grape Policy Committee
has asked for and received a one
month extension from its original
fall-quarter deadline, said Political
Science Prof Luis Fraga, the com
mittee's chair.
The committee has completed
its research and merely needs to
fine tune its recommendations,
Fraga said. The final report will be
presented to University President
Gerhard Casper at the end of Jan
uary.
The 10-member Grape Policy
Committee also was formed in
response to last spring's student
hunger strike, in which protesters
demanded a University-wide boy
cott on table grapes.
Protesters said they were con
cerned about the negative health
effects that field workers suffered
as a result of contact with pesti
cides used to cultivate grapes.
