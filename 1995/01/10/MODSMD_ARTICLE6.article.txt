# A 						Tallent for Creative Writing
## New program director makes time for the little things in life 
### Valerie Hung 
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Eliza
beth Tallent is not her award-winning fiction, but
the significance of a chain of paper clips dangling
from her office couch.
The chain is the latest creation from Tallent's
part-time interior decorator and 7-year-old son,
Gabriel. It serves as a reminder that the new direc
tor of Stanford's Creative Writing Program is first
and foremost a mother.
Indeed, it is when she speaks of his transforma
tion of 500 pieces of high-quality paper into 500
paper airplanes that she breaks into one of her quiet
smiles.
"He's very thorough," she says.
Linking the roles of writer, director and mother
has proven to be one of Tallent's greatest chal
lenges. More often than not, she has found herself
having to "improvise inside a system that is just
learning to accommodate single mothers."
But it was her reputation as a writer that initial
ly caught the attention of the selection committee.
Headed by former director John L'Heureux, the
committee was already familiar with her three crit
ically acclaimed short story collections and novel.
"Her work is deep and disturbing and engages

the reader on a level of concern that's unusual in
contemporary fiction," L'Heureux said. "The style
is meticulous and clean and sharp. The prose itself
has a gorgeousness to it, a ripeness, that makes it a
delight to read."

Elizabeth Tallent, the new director of the Creative Writing Pro
gram, shares a few moments with her 7-year-old son, Gabriel.
L'Heureux also commended
Tallent's generosity as a critic.
"As a teacher, she was far and
away the most impressive of all
the people we saw," he said. "She
accepts the assumptions of the
story absolutely, so that the ques
tion is always not 'Is this worth
doing?' but 'How has the writer
succeeded in doing it?'"
Tallent comes directly from the
English department at the Uni
versity of California at Davis. Her
bachelor's degree from Illinois
State, however, was not in
English, but in anthropology.
"Love of books" led her to pursue
a career in writing instead of
attending graduate school.
Although she would not call
them autobiographical, her sto
ries are based mainly on personal
experience. Her process of trans

forming these experiences into
words is fairly simple: "Caffeine
has a lot to with it."
Sitting on a subway and read
ing her own work, however, is
incomprehensible to her. "I'd be
reading other writers."
Tallent, in fact, never reads
her published writing. "It would
be like hauling out the family
album and looking at all the pho
tographs of yourself with braces,"
she grimaces.
An intensely visual person,
Tallent's work resounds with
details. Included in the "Best
American Short Stories of
1980," "Ice" begins with a
description of an Abyssinian cat
that refuses to have kittens.
"After each abortion, the cat
eats roses — yellow roses, tea
roses, Seashell roses, white roses
on thornless stems."
Her knack for giving the writ
ten detail a voice perhaps explains
the predominance of the short

story as Tallent's main form for
expression. The short story for
her is an "art form in which the
value of things that are 'insignifi
cant' is really rewritten — little
things have resonance."
While this love for detail in her
writing might lead some to imag
ine a similar attention to minuti
ae in the Creative Writing Pro
gram, Tallent speculates that the
major difference between herself
and her predecessors is simply a
matter of style.
"I think it's partly gender
based," she said. "You get a woman
into a program and things begin to
shuffle the deck a little bit."
Tallent has yet to make any
major administrative changes.
Her caution stems mainly from a
desire for continuity.
"I have a lot of ideas, but I
haven't been here very long and
there's a feeling of 'If it ain't
broke, don't fix it.' "
Tallent — who takes on the

additional responsibilities of
English professor as well as those
of Lane Professor in the Humani
ties — brings a deep love for the
English language to her job.
"It's paradise. It's an incredi
ble, centuries old, communal con
struct. It's inexhaustibly rich."
One of her biggest complaints
is that "it's rarer and rarer to find
someone that's really truly in love
with language, and that used to
be a given. It's very strange; I
don't know if it's the impoverish
ment of the culture overall to pop
ular culture and electronic media
. . . but if even young writers
don't love the language anymore,
then we're in trouble."
In fact, when asked her advice
for young writers today, Tallent
does not hesitate. "Take a ball
peen hammer and smash your
TV."
Why a ball peen hammer?
"It just sounds like a really
good hammer."
