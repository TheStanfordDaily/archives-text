## New program director makes time for the little things in life

Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Eliza
beth Tallent is not her award-winning fiction, but
the significance of a chain of paper clips dangling
from her office couch.
The chain is the latest creation from Tallent's
part-time interior decorator and 7-year-old son,
Gabriel. It serves as a reminder that the new direc
tor of Stanford's Creative Writing Program is first
and foremost a mother.
Indeed, it is when she speaks of his transforma
tion of 500 pieces of high-quality paper into 500
paper airplanes that she breaks into one of her quiet
smiles.
"He's very thorough," she says.
Linking the roles of writer, director and mother
has proven to be one of Tallent's greatest chal
lenges. More often than not, she has found herself
having to "improvise inside a system that is just
learning to accommodate single mothers."
But it was her reputation as a writer that initial
ly caught the attention of the selection committee.
Headed by former director John L'Heureux, the
committee was already familiar with her three crit
ically acclaimed short story collections and novel.
"Her work is deep and disturbing and engages

the reader on a level of concern that's unusual in
contemporary fiction," L'Heureux said. "The style
is meticulous and clean and sharp. The prose itself
has a gorgeousness to it, a ripeness, that makes it a
delight to read."
