# Alum Ortiz named to top Mexican post
## 
### Burt Herman Staff writer 
As the Mexican economy is
thrown into crisis by a massive de
valuation of the peso, the Mexican
government is turning to a Stan
ford-educated economist to help
lead their country back to finan
cial stability.
Guillermo Ortiz, a banking
specialist who earned a doctorate
in economics from Stanford in
1977, was appointed to the post of
finance minister by Mexican Pres
ident Ernesto Zedillo last month.
The peso lost more than 35 per
cent of its value after Zedillo de
cided to lift controls on the cur
rency Dec. 20. Many fear that the
instability of the Mexican econo
my could lead to a disruption of
the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
Ortiz's experience in the United
States will help him steer Mexico
clear of its current financial tur
moil, said Clark Reynolds, an
economist at Stanford's Food
Research Institute who has
worked with Ortiz.
"In Washington, there's a
group of people who want to help
Mexico out of this crisis,"
Reynolds said. "He has very good
contacts."
Other Stanford professors
agreed that Ortiz has the tools to
help Mexico out of its financial
quagmire. "Ortiz is the man for
the job," said Economics Prof.
Ronald McKinnon, Ortiz's former
Stanford advisor.
Ortiz wrote his dissertation on
financing Mexican growth using
U.S. capital — precisely what the
Mexican government now needs to
help control the peso's plunge,
McKinnon said.
"His work at Stanford was
exactly right," he said, adding that
Ortiz is "prepared for this crisis."
Ortiz served as Undersecretary

for Finance in the Mexican govern
ment from 1988 to 1994, and also
as executive director of the Inter
national Monetary Fund from
1984 to 1988.
Economics Prof. Ann Krueger
worked with Ortiz while he was at
the International Monetary Fund.
"[Ortiz] is highly respected
throughout the international
financial community," she said.
"He has a good enough grasp of
the situation to get things solved."
As the threat of a massive
devaluation became apparent,
Ortiz began to make his voice
heard in the Mexican government
months ago, McKinnon said.
When the dramatic fall hap
pened last month, Ortiz's warn
ings turned out to be true, she
added.
In 1982, another year when
Mexico was thrown into a financial
crisis, Ortiz worked in the govern
ment to help resolve the problem,
Reynolds said. "Ortiz has one cri
sis under his belt."
On Jan. 5, Ortiz gave a speech
which provided the beleaguered
peso with its first boost by reassur
ing U.S. investors that reactions to
its fall were exaggerated. The same
day the peso gained value on New
York exchanges.
