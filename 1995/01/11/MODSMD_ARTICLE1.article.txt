# Living with Summer and Tiger
## Certain frosh find fun with celebrity roommates 
### Heather Knight 
For most freshmen, the first ques
tion of a new roommate is something
like "What kind of music do you like?"
or, perhaps, "Did you bring a TV?"
For a few new students, however,
that first query may be more along the
lines of, "Umm. . .Can I have your au
tograph?"
Though freshman Courtney Mann
said he did realize that Fred Savage,
Tiger Woods and "that kid from
'Who's the Boss' " would be in his class
at Stanford, he never seriously consid
ered the fact that one of them could be
sharing a room with him.
Mann was in for a surprise.
As it turns out, he is now rooming
with "that kid from 'Who's the Boss,' "
Danny Pintauro.
Some of that celebrity status seems
to have rubbed off on Mann, at least
for his friends back home.

"My friends think it is the coolest
thing ever. Gossip has gone all the way
around the country."
He received an e-mail message from
a friend in Michigan asking about Ben
Seaver from 'Growing Pains'. "I guess
she had the wrong sitcom," Mann said.
But television stars are not the only
celebrities at Stanford.
Bjorn Johnson was a golfer in high
school, so imagine his surprise to dis
cover his roommate was U.S. National
Amateur Champion Tiger Woods.
"My mom saw an article that he was
coming here and she guessed that he
would be my roommate. I had consid
ered it," explained Johnson.
When he told his family the big
news, they were very excited, to say
the least.
"My aunt and uncle are big golf fa
natics," he said. "When they found out,
they said, 'Maybe we'll come out to
visit Tiger, oh, and say hi to you, too.' "

Karen Suskiewicz, who graduated
from Stanford in June, was also a high
school athlete: a swimmer.
She arrived at Stanford tired and
hot from her plane ride from Washing
ton, D.C. When she finally got to her
room, Suskiewicz said she was met by
her roommate, 1992 Olympic Gold
Medalist Summer Sanders, who said,
"I was wondering if you would ever get
here."
After the initial shock, the reality of
rooming with a famous freshman soon
sets in, several celebrity roommates
said. On his first night here, Mann had
to field some prank calls for Pintauro.
"This guy called saying that he was
Tony Danza. He said he had come to
visit Danny and that he was waiting
downstairs."
Another incident occurred when a
fraternity was on a scavenger hunt

Bjor Johnson hangs out with his famous roommate, U.S. National Amateur Golf Champion Tiger Woods.
and needed a picture of a celebri
ty. They kept hanging around
Mann's room waiting for Pintau
ro to return.
Mann describes his reactions to
these types of situations by say
ing, "If it bothers Dan, it bothers
»»
me.
Johnson describes his first
time out with Woods as being an
interesting experience. In line for
a party, a student recognized
Woods and approached him.
"This guy just freaked out for
like five minutes. When he finally
left, Tiger just chuckled. He han
dled it really well."
And at times, Suskiewicz said
she felt more like a secretary than
a roommate.
"Guys would come by to see
[Summer! all the time, but she
was usually gone," she remem
bered. "They would look in, see
me, and then get disappointed —
I also had to answer a lot of phone
calls for her."
And, since Sanders spent most
of her time in the pool,
Suskiewicz often found herself
alone.
"I felt like I had a lot of space

which was nice. I would have been
nice to have someone to talk to
more, though," she said. "I wish I
would have made more of an
effort to get to know her better."
Having the reputation as a
celebrity's roommate can also be
a little annoying.
Mann commented that being
introduced as, "this is Courtney;
he's Danny Pintauro's room
mate," has become old.
Johnson agreed, adding that
people often jest, "You'll have to
get me [Tiger's] autograph."
Mann, Johnson and Suskiewicz,
however, got along well with their
roommates from the start and
stress the point that these "celebri
ties" are just normal people.
"I respect [Danny] more for
the fact that he is normal. He still
maintained a normal teen-age
life," Mann said.
Carolyn Laub, a member of the
New Undergraduate Student
Information Project — who made
roommate matches over the sum
mer — echoed the sentiment that
celebrities are just like other
Stanford students.
"The celebrities are students
here and are taking classes like
everyone else," she said. "We just
looked for roommates with com
patible interests."
Making celebrity roommate

matches was not any more diffi
cult for Laub than making other
matches.
"There are so many things
that go into a roommate. We
would take their fame into
account as we would take any
other characteristic into
account," she said. "Ultimately it
is up to the roommates to make it
work."
Mann, Johnson, and
Suskiewicz all said they did make
it work.
"I honestly don't think about it
anymore," Mann said. "Although,
I used to watch 'Who's the Boss' a
lot and it will be strange to see it
again."
Suskiewicz had a great time
watching the '92 Olympics on TV.
"I was like 'Oh, there's Summer'.
The big joke was that I would say
to all of my male friends, 'I've
seen her naked.'"
Though the two don't keep in
touch anymore, Suskiewicz will
always have a special momento of
her year spent rooming with
Summer Sanders.
Sanders won the Most Valu
able Player trophy from the U.S.
Open in Texas during her fresh
man year. When Suskiewicz com
mented how pretty it was, she
said Sanders responded, "Keep it,
I have plenty."
