# Living with Summer and Tiger
## Certain frosh find fun with celebrity roommates 
### Heather Knight 
For most freshmen, the first ques
tion of a new roommate is something
like "What kind of music do you like?"
or, perhaps, "Did you bring a TV?"
For a few new students, however,
that first query may be more along the
lines of, "Umm. . .Can I have your au
tograph?"
Though freshman Courtney Mann
said he did realize that Fred Savage,
Tiger Woods and "that kid from
'Who's the Boss' " would be in his class
at Stanford, he never seriously consid
ered the fact that one of them could be
sharing a room with him.
Mann was in for a surprise.
As it turns out, he is now rooming
with "that kid from 'Who's the Boss,' "
Danny Pintauro.
Some of that celebrity status seems
to have rubbed off on Mann, at least
for his friends back home.

"My friends think it is the coolest
thing ever. Gossip has gone all the way
around the country."
He received an e-mail message from
a friend in Michigan asking about Ben
Seaver from 'Growing Pains'. "I guess
she had the wrong sitcom," Mann said.
But television stars are not the only
celebrities at Stanford.
Bjorn Johnson was a golfer in high
school, so imagine his surprise to dis
cover his roommate was U.S. National
Amateur Champion Tiger Woods.
"My mom saw an article that he was
coming here and she guessed that he
would be my roommate. I had consid
ered it," explained Johnson.
When he told his family the big
news, they were very excited, to say
the least.
"My aunt and uncle are big golf fa
natics," he said. "When they found out,
they said, 'Maybe we'll come out to
visit Tiger, oh, and say hi to you, too.' "

Karen Suskiewicz, who graduated
from Stanford in June, was also a high
school athlete: a swimmer.
She arrived at Stanford tired and
hot from her plane ride from Washing
ton, D.C. When she finally got to her
room, Suskiewicz said she was met by
her roommate, 1992 Olympic Gold
Medalist Summer Sanders, who said,
"I was wondering if you would ever get
here."
After the initial shock, the reality of
rooming with a famous freshman soon
sets in, several celebrity roommates
said. On his first night here, Mann had
to field some prank calls for Pintauro.
"This guy called saying that he was
Tony Danza. He said he had come to
visit Danny and that he was waiting
downstairs."
