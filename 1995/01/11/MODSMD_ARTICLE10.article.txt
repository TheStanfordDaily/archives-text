## 
### Justin Pollard Staff writer 
After nearly two years without a per
manent head, the School of Education is
finally gaining a sense of continuity this
quarter as new dean Richard Shavelson
assumes his post and begins work on a
school-wide review.
"It is extremely difficult to promote
your organization without established
leadership," said Maureen McNulty, the
associate dean for external relations. "I
am delighted to have someone in place,
and someone of (Shavelson's] caliber
. . . I think it will make more sense for
people to make an investment in the
school if they know the (permanent)
leadership," she added.
Shavelson, the dean of the graduate
School of Education at UC-Santa Bar
bara for the past six years, began work

on Jan. 1, after finishing his research at
the University of Gottingen as a recipi
ent of Germany's Humboldt Award.
Although Shavelson did not articu
late a particular direction for the school
— we already have "a very strong
school," he said — he said he is "plan
ning to take a good hard look at it" to
make some improvements.
Shavelson said he will issue a review
report from within tfie Education School
and then bring in an external review
team. The findings, he said, "set the
course for the next three to five years."
At the same time, the new dean plans
to be pursuing his own research inter
ests. Research and teaching are "the
kind of fun I have," providing a wel
come break from administrative duties,
Shavelson said.
Currently, his interests center main
ly around methods of testing and

assessment. "We're looking at the
reform of the kind of testing that goes
on in the country, moving away from
multiple choice," he said, and toward
"performance assessment" testing.
In Shavelson's particular area of
expertise — testing knowledge of chem
istry and physics — performance
assessment tests provide students with
laboratories and let them to attempt to
solve hands-on problems. It is especially
important, he said, that adequate
research is performed to guarantee the
standards of reliability and accuracy of
these new testing methods.
Research is needed in "both the cre
ative part [of testing] — how we change
the way we test — and the technical
part," that is, how we measure the
results of those tests and equate them
with results from different years, he
said.

"He is well recognized in the field of
education as well as in the community
outside of education that works in test
ing and measurement," which is his
field of specialty, said Education Prof.
Kenji Hakuta, a member of the search
committee that hired Shavelson.
Shavelson will follow interim dean,
Myra Strober, the school's associate
dean, who took over for Education Prof.
Nel Noddings, formerly an acting dean.
The last permanent dean, Marshall
Smith, left in 1993 when he was
appointed undersecretary of education
by President Clinton.
"I'm delighted [Shavelson's! here
and I'm eager to work with him," said
Vicki Oldberg, associate dean for
administration. "I think he's going to
provide good leadership," she added.
Shavelson has held a number of
prominent national positions, including

the presidency of the American Educa
tional Research Association, the major
educational research society, and cur
rently the vice chairmanship of the
Board on Testing Assessment at the
National Research Council.
Shavelson received his doctorate in
educational psychology from Stanford
in 1971 and served as an assistant pro
fessor of education at Stanford for two
years.
"There's a sense of dej& vu" being on
campus again, he said, even though
Stanford has changed greatly in the
past two decades. There are many more
buildings on campus now, he said, and
some of the buildings he used to work in
have been closed due to earthquake
damage.
"I'm getting settled in,"he said,
"We're still opening boxes and that sort
of thing."
