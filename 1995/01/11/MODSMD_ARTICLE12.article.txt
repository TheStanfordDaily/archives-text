# Major components of the special-fee proposal
## 
### 
If the special-fee proposal gains the approval of two-thirds
of the senate, it will go to the student body for a vote. If
passed, the proposal would, among other changes,
amend the ASSU constitution to:
• eliminate the fee-refund system.
• split undergraduates and graduates into two separate
communities for fee voting and collection.
• cap the total amount of fees that can be placed on the
ballot through senate approval. This number is adjusted
for inflation and can be changed by a three-fourths vote of
the senate, but it gives the senate the discretion to exclude
groups or to decrease the amounts of groups' requests if
the number of requests is excessive.
• decree that, as in the past, organizations can also place
themselves on the ballot through petitions, but will now
need 60 percent of voters to approve their fee rather than
the usual majority.
• prevent fees from going toward religious or political activ
ities.
• direct funds leftover at the end of the fiscal year into a
special funding reserve account for the organization, sub
ject to the ASSU's budgetary supervision.
