## Severe floods ravage state

GUERNEVILLE, Calif. (AP)
â€” Deadly storms lashed North
ern California again yesterday,
flooding more riverside communi
ties, cutting major highways and
crushing two people beneath
falling trees.
Worst hit was northern Sacra
mento County where all 20,000
residents of Rio Linda were
ordered evacuated, with hun
dreds sent to shelters in elemen
tary schools and churches.
"Water is almost to the top of
street signs in some locations,"
said sheriffs spokeswoman
Sharon Telles.
Neighboring Placer County
officials reported "devastation" in
Roseville as waters rose above the
100-year flood plain.
Along the Russian River,
meanwhile, Army National
Guard Chinook helicopters

plucked more residents out of iso
lated Guerneville as waters crest
ed at 17 feet above flood stage.
Brothers Brian and Dave Rid
ley were on one of the first flights
out. They were cold and hungry.
"Our house is gone," Dave
said. "I've been inside my truck
for three days."
Richard Cory made the flight
clutching his terrified dog Shasta.
He said he abandoned his home
after his garage and basement
submerged.
"I got to smelling about as bad
as the dog, and I was out of
water," Cory said.
The rains eased around
Guerneville yesterday, but
storms pounded other areas and
new flooding was reported.
More than a foot of rain has
fallen in some parts of the region
since Friday, accompanied by

wind gusts of up to 78 mph, forc
ing thousands out of their homes.
Two motorists were killed in
separate incidents in Sonoma and
Monterey counties when the
storm knocked trees down on
their vehicles.
More than 100,000 customers
were without power in scattered
communities along the coastline
as the brunt of the storms moved
south toward Central and South
ern California, said Pacific Gas &
Electric Co. officials. Repairs
were difficult, said Diana Gapuz.
"A lot of times they're under
water, and mudslides and land
slides are blocking the way," she
said.
The American Red Cross
housed about 500 people in shel
ters dotting the region Monday
night and expects more, said
spokeswoman Beverly Butler.
