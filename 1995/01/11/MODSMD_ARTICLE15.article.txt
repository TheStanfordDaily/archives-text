# Mexico stocks in downward spiral
## Political crisis contributes to biggest single-day fall in 8 years 
### 
MEXICO CITY (AP) - The Mexican
stock market took a roller-coaster tumble
yesterday, at one point taking its worst sin
gle-day fall since 1987, then regaining
ground to close 6.26 percent lower.
The day was one of the most volatile for
the market since Mexico's financial prob
lems snowballed into a crisis three weeks
ago.
At its worst point, the market dipped
nearly 11 percent, with brokers telling
clients to sell no matter the cost. Later,
bargain hunters snapped up battered
stocks and the state development bank
Nacional Financiera made purchases,
traders said.
The selling spilled into other Latin mar
kets and jolted more U.S. investors, who
have been hanging onto their Mexican
securities despite repeatedly punishing
losses since December.
It was also certain to further fuel the
confidence problem faced by the govern
ment as it seeks to grapple with its growing
economic problems, brought on by steep

losses in the peso and large trade deficits.
After rallying slightly on Monday, the
peso weakened to 5.75, compared with 5.4
Monday. Trading was dismal, as Mexicans
held on to foreign currencies to protect
themselves against coming inflation.
Efforts by the government Monday to
bolster the battered currency by selling dol
lars and buying pesos apparently failed.
"If you look at all the financial markets
in Mexico right now, there's all tremen
dous weakness," said Gene Frieda, a Latin
markets analyst at Nat West Securities in
Washington."The government hasn't
managed to inject any new confidence into
the market."
By early afternoon, the market's main
index had failed 228.7 points or 10.87 per
cent to 1,875.33, well below its weakest
point of 1994. In percentage terms, the
drop was the worst since the global Black
Monday crash of October 19, 1987, when
the Mexican market fell 13 percent.
By the end of the day, the main IPC
index declined 6.26 percent to 1,972.33. A

day earlier, the stock market plunged 6.65
percent in a growing loss of confidence in
President Ernesto Zedillo's administration.
The last times the Mexican market had
seen such large-single day losses was dur
ing global crashes that saw the IPC plunge
8.05 percent on Oct. 16, 1989, and 13.23
percent on Oct. 19, 1987.
So far this year Mexico's once-thriving
stock market has declined more than 21
percent in value, as foreign investors exit
the country to minimize their losses from
the falling value of the peso currency.
Also influencing the market yesterday
were a series of disclosures of steep foreign
exchange losses by major Mexican compa
nies as a result of the more than 40 percent
peso devaluation since the crisis erupted
Dec. 20.
Empresas ICA, a giant construction
company, said yesterday it expects a for
eign exchange loss of about 1 billion pesos,
or $174 million. ICA also said it is being
forced to review all projects under con
struction an development.
