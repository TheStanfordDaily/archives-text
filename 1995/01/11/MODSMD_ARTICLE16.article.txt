Chechen lull temporary
GROZNY, Russia (AP) - Chechen
rebels scrambled yesterday to bury
comrades' white-shrouded corpses
and reinforce their presidential
palace during a cease-fire that col
lapsed in hours, heralding more fight
ing ahead.
The proposed 48-hour truce,
announced by Moscow early yesterday,
was designed to allow both sides to
gather dead and wounded while civil
ians fled Grozny,
But it proved a fleeting pause in the
battle for the Chechen capital, devas
tated by a month-long siege and 11 days
of a Russian ground attack launched to
quell a secessionist uprising.
Sniper fire sounded throughout the
truce, which crumbled after four hours
when salvos of Russian artillery
slammed into the city center. Each side
immediately blamed the other.
Chechen officials, rejecting

Moscow's cease-fire terms as an ultima
tum, again insisted on a Russian with
drawal before they would lay down
their arms.
Serb truce holding
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) â€” Bosnian Serbs promised yester
day to end their blockade of Sarajevo,
lending an upbeat note to a day when
new fighting and diplomatic conflict
threatened a lasting truce.
The Serbs, however, continued to
demand that the government army
vacate key positions overlooking Sara
jevo. The unspoken threat was clear:
Even if the Serbs keep their promise,
they can blockade Sarajevo anew unless
their demands are met.
If the Serbs open roads linking Sara
jevo with other government-held terri
tory, they would be meeting some
terms of a planned four-month truce
signed Dec. 31.
