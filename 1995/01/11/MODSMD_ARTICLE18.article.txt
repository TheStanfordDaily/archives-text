ASSU should amend its
rules to clarify role and
powers of senate chair

Although the discord
at the Dec. 6 ASSU Senate
meeting may have been a sur
prisingly entertaining re-enactment
of real-world politics, the power
struggle which ensued has serious
implications for senate policy.
Problems arose during the sen
ate's original vote on the proposal to
reform the special-fee process. The
proposal — which would eliminate
special-fee refunds but simultane
ously put a limit on the total amount
of fees the senate could place on the
ballot — appeared at first to be head
ed toward narrow defeat.
In a unprecedented turn of
events, however, Senate Chair
Nawwar Kasrawi invoked a seldom
used clause in the ASSU Constitu
tion known as the "sweatshirt rule,"
which mandates that any senator
not wearing the coveted gray ASSU
Senate sweatshirt is ineligible to
vote.
As a result, graduate senators
Julie Cantor and Lowell Hawkins —
attired in mere street clothes —
were prevented from casting their
intended votes against the proposal.
In the end, Kasrawi himself cast the
deciding ballot in favor of the pro
posal.
The issue was further complicat
ed by the fact that Kasrawi was an
author of the proposal and therefore
had particular interest in its pas
sage. Undergraduate senator
Stephen Russell, for example, called
Kasrawi's ruling "the most colossal
abuse of senate power in recent Sen
ate history."
Whatever Kasrawi's true inten
tions were, the episode demon
strates that the role of the Senate
Chair must be more clearly defined
to prevent similar problems in the
future.
If the ASSU believes the senate

chair should wield a great deal of
power and take a strong role in set
ting the ASSU agenda, the chair's
role must be clearly defined as such
in the ASSU Constitution to prevent
misunderstandings and unify expec
tations. Similarly, if the ASSU
believes the chair's role should sim
ply be that of an arbitrator or admin
istrator, then this role should be
equally well-defined in the Constitu
tion.
At present, each senate chair is
allowed great flexibility in determin
ing his or her own role in senate pro
ceedings. Narrowing the flexibility
of this role would go a long way
toward determining an acceptable
position of authority for the senate
chair. Rather than having one chair
who refrains from voting and anoth
er who does not, practices must be
streamlined to create continuity and
predictability from one chair to the
next and from one year to the next.
Obvious issues of importance are
whether the senate chair should
even have the right to vote or to
sponsor bills. While a decision on
such an issue would certainly
require further deliberation, it is
clear that an amendment limiting
the chair's participation would help
prevent power struggles similar to
the events of Dec. 6.
Karen Seta, a graduate student
who chaired the task force that
wrote the special-fee proposal,
remarked that the circus-like atmo
sphere during the Dec. 6 meeting
took the emphasis off the proposal
itself and directed it toward which
side would win the battle. It's pre
cisely this result that must be avoid
ed if senate proceedings are to
regain their validity as a democratic
affair.
Rather than transforming the
ASSU Senate into a playground for
special interests with the chair pos
sessing greatest power, an institu
tionalized understanding of the
chair's proper role — and perhaps a
limited hand in voting and writing
bills — would help prevent a sequel
to the sweatshirt incident and the
bad feelings it evoked.
