# ASSU Senate passes special-fee plan 17-3
## Opponents want funds to match COP campaign 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
The special-fee reforms proposed by an
ASSU task force entered the senate like a
lion last quarter, sparking highly con
tentious debate and controversial rulings.
Last night, however, the reforms left
the senate like a lamb.
After a short, relatively innocuous de
bate, senators voted 17-3 to approve the
bill. Passage of the reforms means that a
special election will be held on Jan. 25 in
which students will vote on the proposal.
Last night's vote came after the bill
passed with great controversy at the pre
vious senate meeting. The reform propos
al had originally passed on a technical rul
ing that two senators who opposed the bill
could not vote because they were not
wearing their sweatshirt uniforms. A mo
tion to reconsider the bill had been passed
by the senate before that meeting ad
journed.

The only bump in the bill's passage last
night was a debate over whether the sen
ate should provide equal funding for the

since the Council
of Presidents will
be funding the
campaign to pass
the bill. That ini-

tiative failed after a preliminary vote pre
vented the reform opponents from intro
ducing such a measure.
The bill's margin of victory last night
was the result of two factors: a strong
turnout by senators in favor of the bill and
a couple of switched votes.
Nine of ten undergraduate senators
voted for the bill, with sophomore Andr6
Vanier as the lone opponent.
Junior Michelle Gee originally voted
against the bill, but said she changed her
mind after talking to other students in her
residence. Gee said she decided it
was important to let the students
decide on the reforms, rather than
dictating it to them.
"But that's working under the
assumption that people will read
[the bill], which I hope they will,"
Gee said after the meeting.

'We will work hard to
make sure the student
body is well-informed
of the numerous flaws
in the amendment.'

Senate Chair Nawwar Kasrawi
stepped down as chair for the vote
on the hill, ostensibly to avoid a
conflict of interest. He had been a
member of the task force that
made the recommendations for
changing the special-fee process.
Kasrawi, who was elected as a
graduate senator, then voted in
favor of the reforms.
After the meeting Kasrawi
said, "I'm pleased the senate
passed the bill. I'm glad the senate
can now move on to new projects."

"I think the students will make
the best decision based on the
information available," he said.
"I'm hoping it passes."
Vanier said his major problem
with the reform proposal is that it
takes away the students' right to a
refund, adding that he and gradu
ate senator Donald Aingworth
would co-author the arguments
against the special-fee reforms in
the election packet.
"We'll spread it by word of
mouth," Vanier said. "We will
work hard to make sure the stu
dent body is well-informed of the
numerous flaws in the amend
ment. ... It will be difficult for
either side to organize a well
orchestrated campaign."
It probably be more difficult,
however, for Vanier's side to get
its message out, since they will not
be funded.
COP member Mork Murdock
said the push for the bill's passage
will be "mainly a grass-roots cam
paign." He said the COP will dis
tribute flyers, stump in under
graduate dorms and graduate
schools, and contact various stu
dent groups to enlist their support
for the bill.
In other business, graduate
senator Sanford Dickert
announced his resignation from
the senate. Dickert, who was on a
leave of absence last quarter,
served for three years in the sen
ate and said that he needed to con
centrate on other interests.
