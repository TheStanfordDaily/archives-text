## Making the most of solitude 
### 
Looking around during these
early days of what has so far been a
wet winter quarter, I am struck by
how empty the sidewalks are. It is cold,
the holidays are over, and once again we
have piled on the units and retreated,
books in tow, to our separate rooms and
labs and library chairs. Thinking alone in
my room I am reminded of a conversation
where I learned that college student popu
lations have among the highest depression
rates of any demographic group. The
statistic doesn't surprise me. Rather, my
years here at Stanford and my knowledge
of others' experience confirm what the
numbers suggest: that there is little real
happiness, while depression and concealed
despair quietly pervade.
My personal feeling is that this depres
sion is in many ways the result of loneli
ness. And yet we wonder how, in an area
where there are so many people with such
endlessly interesting and diverse offer
ings, cuuld one possibly be lonely? We look
around us and see people who appear to
have everything we lack: close relation
ships, passionate interests, a plan. It
seems almost paradoxical to try to share
our feelings of loneliness, for how does one
confide in another that their presence fails
to comfort, and even makes us feel more
alone?
The very task of being a student at
times demands solitude. Within the
workplaces of the mind we are often
alone, many times satisfactorily so, but

we also live in fear of falling too far,
where our experience of a spacious and
productive aloneness threatens to
become unbearable loneliness. And so we
work in silent rooms alone together. We
turn to books, where our relationships
with their authors do not invite compar
ison or suggest inadequacy. Above all, we
bury ourselves in the work, so that those
selves do not feel pain.
Yet the pain of loneliness is an essen
tial part of us, for we need other human
beings to realize our own humanity. And
if our loneliness seems to us a failure,
then it is simply because failure is a nec
essary part of being human. As I see it,
the problem resides not in our feelings of
loneliness, but in our fear of failure. If we
are alone we think it is because we lack or
are incapable of achieving what society
deems — in its deplorably narrow view —
to be at that moment attractive or suc
cessful. The current model of success
given to American youths is one I suspect
those of us at Stanford know all too well
as a projection of decisions made early on,
of strict commitment and focused ambi
tion.
This model does much to promote ordi
nary success, but it also expands the range
of failure enormously. Saddled with pre
mature expectations to make exclusive
and seemingly permanent "life choices," it
is no wonder that our fear of failure is so
strong. We are afraid to imagine other suc
cessful options and if we do, the risk of

changing our life choices seems too great.
Yet the chance of attaining success
under this current model is concomitantly
too small. The fact of so much loneliness
and despair is evidence enough to prove
that the success we now strive for is too
expensive, and inhibits our ability to live
out our lives broadly and without fear. As
I see it, failure under this old system real
ly marks the beginning of change, a move
toward a new kind of success that appreci
ates alternatives not as something foreign,
but as potential opportunities we have not
yet explored.
And so it is with loneliness. Writing
about the subject Clark E. Moustakas sees
loneliness as "neither good nor bad, but a
point of intense and timeless awareness of
the Self, a beginning which initiates total
ly new sensitivities and awarenesses, and
which results in bringing a person deeply
in touch with his own existence and in
touch with others in a fundamental
sense." Alone in winter or in the depths of
Green, I know that sometimes even books
don't fill the emptiness. But every time we
open ourselves to loss, we create a space
where fulfillment can be gained.

Elizabeth Kelly owes some of her ideas to
Catherine Dateson, Ursula LeGuin and
May Sarton.
