Letters on sex issues did not present powerful arguments

I WOULD LIRE to discuss two respons
es to my letter of Nov. 30 criticizing the
arguments of the Students for a Tradi
tional Sexual Ethic. Each response chal
lenged my suggestion that "if the mem
bers of the group have practiced what they
preached and remained abstinent, then
they are less informed about the joys of
premarital sex than the people who they
intend to educate." James KufTner proper
ly notes that there are other ways to eval
uate an experience besides firsthand expe
rience. Such judgments are possible and
sometimes necessary, so in this sense my
statement was too extreme. However, sex
is a personal experience which cannot be
fully conveyed through studies, anecdotes,
etc. There is, then, at least a prima facie
reason for favoring the opinions of those
whose knowledge of the subject is first
hand, and for being skeptical of persons
who claim to have performed an accurate
cost-benefit analysis of premarital sex
without having had sex themselves. While
such persons may be well-informed in
many ways, in one important sense they

literally don't know what they're talking
about. This is the irony which I referred
to.
In the second response Vincent Mooney
and other members suggest that my claim
was inappropriate, an ad hominem argu
ment, because it "focuses attention on our
personal lives rather than the discussion
about premarital sex." This is an odd
claim for Mooney to make, since his per
sonal life was apparently veiy relevant to
the discussion in the first Daily article on
the group, when his experience is not only
described but also cited as demonstrating
to him "why it is emotionally healthier for
people to remain chaste." Also, the name
"Students for a Traditional Sexual Ethic"
implies an intent to promote the members'
judgments and evaluations in addition to
facilitating discussion. This advocacy posi
tion makes their knowledge of the subject
a valid issue. As I have just argued, this
knowledge is necessarily limited in, I
think, an important way if the group's
members have followed their own advice.
KufTner also notes the preponderance

of sex scenes involving unmarried couples
in the media. I welcome empirical facts,
but these statistics did not address my
question: the group challenges the presup
position that sex outside of marriage is
normal; are they implying that it is abnor
mal, and if so, what is their evidence? I'm
not even suggesting that it is normal, I
would simply like to see some of the infor
mation which the group supposedly wishes
to disseminate. For example, do most per
sons remain abstinent until marriage?
Also, I'm not sure that Hollywood should
be blamed for embracing anything as a
norm of behavior. No one asks Hollywood
to accurately reflect Americans' lives; if it
did, the content of movies and television
would be no more interesting than what
was going on around us. We ask Holly
wood to entertain us, and it appears that
sex, along with violence and intrigue, etc.
does that. We could blame Hollywood for
ciamming these things down our throats,
but notice that the Family Channel is not
exactly a ratings titan; most people would
rather watch "Body Heat" or "Natural

Born Killers," and Hollywood responds to
that preference.
Finally, the second response points out
that Dennehy used a different definition of
lust from that found in my copy of Web
ster's Dictionary. I'm happy that the mis
understanding was cleared up. However, it
then suggests that "Therefore, Richard
son's conclusion about sloppiness of rea
soning does not follow." I should hope not!
Lust wasn't even mentioned in my letter
until after that conclusion. It was an
entirely separate point. By sloppiness of
reasoning I was referring to such tactics as
justifying deontological assertions with
teleological arguments. I gave Dennehy
the benefit of the doubt on these matters
because most people, perhaps including
the members of the group, wouldn't be
interested in following a debate about
moral theory. If I am wrong, however, I
would love to hear from the group's mem
bers. My e-mail address is
