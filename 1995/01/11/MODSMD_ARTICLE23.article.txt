## 'Seeing' invisible objects Photons detect matter in the 'dark' 
### Julie Sauer Editorial staff 
Instead of relying on their senses
to gather information about the
physical world, scientists at Stan
ford and the University of Inns
bruck are using a single photon for
interaction-free measurement.
These measurements use quan
tum mechanical properties of a pho
ton to detect an object without ever
'seeing" the object.
The experiments ensure that
there is a single photon in the mea
suring apparatus by directing a
high-energy ultraviolet laser
through a special crystal that con
verts the single ultraviolet photon
into two identical photons that have
lower energy.
"For every photon in you get two
photons out that are carbon copies
of each other," said Mark Kasevich,
assistant professor of physics at
Stanford.
After the conversion of the high
energy photon into the two lower
energy photons, a photon detector
'clicks', thereby signaling the pres
ence of a photon in the apparatus.
Kasevich and his colleagues at
University of Innsbruck have
increased the efficiency of interac
tion-free measurement over that of
previously existing methods.
Avshalom Elitzur and Lev Vaid
man of Tel Aviv University devel
oped the first method of object
detection using a device called a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The
interferometer uses a beam-splitter
—like a half-silvered mirror— to
divide a photon into two different
pathways.
The sets of waves can interfere
constructively and emerge at detec
tor one or interfere destructively at
detector two.
"In keeping with the traditional
interpretation of quantum mechan
ics, the photon bounces off" the mir

ror and hits the beam-splitter. The
same photon is in two places at once,
with a 50 percent probability of find
ing it in each arm," Kasevich said.
"We hope that quantum mechanics
allows us to recover the wave inter
ference pattern, and it does," he
added.
With no object present in the
interferometer, the photon always
emerges at the first detector where
constructive interference occurs.
However, with an object present
there are three possible outcomes of
the experiment. Half of the time the
photon will hit the object and be
absorbed by it, thereby detecting the
object by interacting with it.
Twenty-five percent of the out
comes will show the photon arriving
at detector two, proving that the
object is present in this arm of the
interferometer. The object must be
present to disturb the destructive
interference that would otherwise
prevent the photon from emerging
at the second detector.
The third outcome — that the
photon hits detector one— also
occurs with probability of 25 per
cent. This is the usually expected
outcome if there were no object pre
sent, and it provides no information
on whether the object is present or
absent from the second arm of the
apparatus.
The overall efficiency of this
Elitzer-Vaidman method is only
about 33 percent, and interaction
free measurement is only successful
25 percent of the time.
"It's a nice thought experiment,
because it highlights the possibility
of making a detection without ever
interacting with something . . .
that's what experiments like this
are designed to highlight. It's a
bizarre aspect of quantum mechan
ics, one of the fundamental aspects
of it," Kasevich explained. "Now the
question is can you make the effi
ciency equal one. That's what our

work was," he added.
The Innsbruck-Stanford group's
first experiment included a configu
ration of two mirrors, one on either
side of a beam-splitter mirror. The
beam splitter reflects 99.99 percent
of incident light (photons) and
transmits only .01 percent.
The researchers introduced a
photon into the first compartment
of the measuring apparatus. Each
time the photon hits the beam-split
ting mirror, a small amount of the
photon's path interferes construc
tively with the photon already in the
second compartment.
This is the same quantum
mechanical property that allows the
photon to be in two places at once in
the Elitzer-Vaidman experiment.
When the Stanford-Innsbruck
researchers placed an object in the
first compartment, however, the
photon was absorbed and construc
tive interference failed. As a result,
there is nearly zero chance for the
photon to be transmitted into com
partment two.
"The key thing here is the con
structive interference," Kasevich
said. If there is no object, you have a
resonance effect where the little bit
of probability transmitted by the
beam-splitter interferes construc
tively with the photon already in the
second compartment, he said.
"When the [object] is present,"
he continued, "there is no construc
tive interference." The photon is
absorbed by the object and there is
no chance for it to occur in the sec
ond compartment.
In addition to thus method, Kase
vich and his colleagues are also test
ing a second method of interaction
free measurement that involves
polarizing photons.
Photons can be polarized by
passing them through a series of
plates positioned at a specific angle
that ensures that light is almost
completely transmitted through the

plates. However, each plate deflects
a small amount of the incident light
that is not correctly polarized to
pass through the plates.
A sequence of the plates effec
tively reflects light of the wrong
polarization, so when the photon
emerges it has a different orienta
tion than it had before entering the
stack of plates.
Researchers use a series of polar
ization-sensitive plates that rotate
the plane of photon polarization.
After passing through a series of
these plates, the photon is rotated
by 90 degrees — from vertical to
horizontal — and the horizontal

beam emerges at the first detector.
This method requires photons
that are originally polarized vertical
ly. The photon is rotated, passes
through a beam-splitter, and then is
recombined.
"You can put the light and the
photon back together so it is at
exactly the same polarization state,"
Kasevich said. However, when an
object is inserUn:! in the apparatus,
the polarized photon can no longer
rotate back to its original position.
As a result, the photon emerges
at a different detector. This indi
cates the presence of the object
without ever 'looking' at it.

The team's work is purely theo
retical. "I wouldn't speculate on
applications," Kasevich advised.
"The importance of our work is that
it sharpens our understanding of
basic quantum mechanics."
Interaction-free measurement
"runs completely counter to any
thing we have in our classical
physics experiments," Kasevich
added. "If you want to detect some
thing [in classical experiments], you
look at it. By the nature of looking at
it, you're interacting with it."
Kasevich and his group have sub
mitted a paper on the subject of
their research for publication.

"When the [object] is present,"
he continued, "there is no construc
tive interference." The photon is
absorbed by the object and there is
no chance for it to occur in the sec
ond compartment.
In addition to thus method, Kase
vich and his colleagues are also test
ing a second method of interaction
free measurement that involves
polarizing photons.
Photons can be polarized by
passing them through a series of
plates positioned at a specific angle
that ensures that light is almost
completely transmitted through the

plates. However, each plate deflects
a small amount of the incident light
that is not correctly polarized to
pass through the plates.
A sequence of the plates effec
tively reflects light of the wrong
polarization, so when the photon
emerges it has a different orienta
tion than it had before entering the
stack of plates.
Researchers use a series of polar
ization-sensitive plates that rotate
the plane of photon polarization.
After passing through a series of
these plates, the photon is rotated
by 90 degrees — from vertical to
horizontal — and the horizontal

beam emerges at the first detector.
This method requires photons
that are originally polarized vertical
ly. The photon is rotated, passes
through a beam-splitter, and then is
recombined.
"You can put the light and the
photon back together so it is at
exactly the same polarization state,"
Kasevich said. However, when an
object is inserUn:! in the apparatus,
the polarized photon can no longer
rotate back to its original position.
As a result, the photon emerges
at a different detector. This indi
cates the presence of the object
without ever 'looking' at it.

The team's work is purely theo
retical. "I wouldn't speculate on
applications," Kasevich advised.
"The importance of our work is that
it sharpens our understanding of
basic quantum mechanics."
Interaction-free measurement
"runs completely counter to any
thing we have in our classical
physics experiments," Kasevich
added. "If you want to detect some
thing [in classical experiments], you
look at it. By the nature of looking at
it, you're interacting with it."
Kasevich and his group have sub
mitted a paper on the subject of
their research for publication.

Instead of relying on their senses
to gather information about the
physical world, scientists at Stan
ford and the University of Inns
bruck are using a single photon for
interaction-free measurement.
These measurements use quan
tum mechanical properties of a pho
ton to detect an object without ever
'seeing" the object.
The experiments ensure that
there is a single photon in the mea
suring apparatus by directing a
high-energy ultraviolet laser
through a special crystal that con
verts the single ultraviolet photon
into two identical photons that have
lower energy.
"For every photon in you get two
photons out that are carbon copies
of each other," said Mark Kasevich,
assistant professor of physics at
Stanford.
After the conversion of the high
energy photon into the two lower
energy photons, a photon detector
'clicks', thereby signaling the pres
ence of a photon in the apparatus.
Kasevich and his colleagues at
University of Innsbruck have
increased the efficiency of interac
tion-free measurement over that of
previously existing methods.
Avshalom Elitzur and Lev Vaid
man of Tel Aviv University devel
oped the first method of object
detection using a device called a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The
interferometer uses a beam-splitter
—like a half-silvered mirror— to
divide a photon into two different
pathways.
The sets of waves can interfere
constructively and emerge at detec
tor one or interfere destructively at
detector two.
"In keeping with the traditional
interpretation of quantum mechan
ics, the photon bounces off" the mir

ror and hits the beam-splitter. The
same photon is in two places at once,
with a 50 percent probability of find
ing it in each arm," Kasevich said.
"We hope that quantum mechanics
allows us to recover the wave inter
ference pattern, and it does," he
added.
With no object present in the
interferometer, the photon always
emerges at the first detector where
constructive interference occurs.
However, with an object present
there are three possible outcomes of
the experiment. Half of the time the
photon will hit the object and be
absorbed by it, thereby detecting the
object by interacting with it.
Twenty-five percent of the out
comes will show the photon arriving
at detector two, proving that the
object is present in this arm of the
interferometer. The object must be
present to disturb the destructive
interference that would otherwise
prevent the photon from emerging
at the second detector.
The third outcome — that the
photon hits detector one— also
occurs with probability of 25 per
cent. This is the usually expected
outcome if there were no object pre
sent, and it provides no information
on whether the object is present or
absent from the second arm of the
apparatus.
The overall efficiency of this
Elitzer-Vaidman method is only
about 33 percent, and interaction
free measurement is only successful
25 percent of the time.
"It's a nice thought experiment,
because it highlights the possibility
of making a detection without ever
interacting with something . . .
that's what experiments like this
are designed to highlight. It's a
bizarre aspect of quantum mechan
ics, one of the fundamental aspects
of it," Kasevich explained. "Now the
question is can you make the effi
ciency equal one. That's what our

work was," he added.
The Innsbruck-Stanford group's
first experiment included a configu
ration of two mirrors, one on either
side of a beam-splitter mirror. The
beam splitter reflects 99.99 percent
of incident light (photons) and
transmits only .01 percent.
The researchers introduced a
photon into the first compartment
of the measuring apparatus. Each
time the photon hits the beam-split
ting mirror, a small amount of the
photon's path interferes construc
tively with the photon already in the
second compartment.
This is the same quantum
mechanical property that allows the
photon to be in two places at once in
the Elitzer-Vaidman experiment.
When the Stanford-Innsbruck
researchers placed an object in the
first compartment, however, the
photon was absorbed and construc
tive interference failed. As a result,
there is nearly zero chance for the
photon to be transmitted into com
partment two.
"The key thing here is the con
structive interference," Kasevich
said. If there is no object, you have a
resonance effect where the little bit
of probability transmitted by the
beam-splitter interferes construc
tively with the photon already in the
second compartment, he said.
"When the [object] is present,"
he continued, "there is no construc
tive interference." The photon is
absorbed by the object and there is
no chance for it to occur in the sec
ond compartment.
In addition to thus method, Kase
vich and his colleagues are also test
