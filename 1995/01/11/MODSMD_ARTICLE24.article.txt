# Research team links lupus to gender

A newly released nation-wide marketing
research study indicates that nearly two
million Americans are diagnosed with
lupus, the abbreviated term for systemic
lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune dis
ease which primarily affects women.
The disease is a condition where lympho
cytes — white blood cells — attack specific
antigens, which are small proteins on cell
membranes that allow the body to differen
tiate between self and non-self.
In lupus, the body is unable to make this
differentiation, and thus attacks and elimi
nates its own cells. This results in erup
tions on the skin, painful joints, kidney
problems, alveolitis, enlargement of the
cnlppn onH fpvAr
Dr. James McGuire, Chief of Staff at the
Stanford University Medical Center, heads
a research group studying ways to combat
lupus. The group includes Dr. Ronald Van
Vollenhoven, assistant professor of
medicine, and Dr. Edgar Engleman, profes
sor of medicine and pathology, and head of
the Stanford Blood Bank.
In lupus patients, the antigens and anti
bodies form complexes which lodge onto
organs and are eventually attacked by the
immune system. Exposure to sunlight,
sulphonamide drugs and viruses precipi
tates the disease; however, it has both
genetic and environmental causes.
Through cell lysis, the disease-precipitat
ing factors often expose antigens to anti
bodies. In a lupus patient, antibodies will
attack the antigens on the DNA, form
immunocomplexes and lodge in the kidney.
The body will then begin a full attack on the
kidney. This usually causes failure of the
organ, recognized early on by blood and
protein in the urine.
Although many people compare lupus to
cancer, there is a distinct difference
between the two. According to McGuire,
"cancer occurs when the immune system is
underactive, and lupus occurs when the
immune system is overactive."
Each day the body produces cancers, and
they are eliminated on a regular basis. One
is diagnosed with cancer when the immune
system fails to remove the abnormal cancer
cells in the early stages. In lupus, on the
other hand, the body removes foreign anti
gens but extends this elimination to anti
gens which are part of the body's self.
Hormones are inextricably linked to
lupus. In animal models of lupus-like dis
eases in mice, females generally showed
severe symptoms, while male mice were
affected only mildly. When male mice were
castrated, they experienced severe lupus
similar to their female counterparts.
This model produces the same observa
tion as that found in human populations —
that lupus i3 significantly more common
among women than men. One method that
has been used in the past to alleviate the
effects of lupus is to trick the immune sys
tem into thinking that sufferers are male.
This requires injections of an androgen

like testosterone which according to
McGuire, "must be weak enough that the
body is tricked, but not strong enough to
cause masculine secondary sex characteris
tics."
This method has not proved to be very
effective, because the side effects are too
strong. Testing of testosterone derivatives
caused unsuitable masculinazation in
women. Because the peak ages for lupus are
18-29, such side effects are unacceptable for
young, college-aged women.
A possible solution was to go back fur
ther in the metabolic pathway in the pro
duction of testosterone, which ultimately
begins with cholesterol. The compound pro
duced in the sixth step in the conversion of

cholesterol to testosterone proved effective,
with its weak androgenic effects. However,
it produced undesirable side effects similar
to injecting testosterone.
Both males and females naturally pro
duce androgens. In males they are pro
duced in the testes and adrenal glands, and
in females they are produced in much
smaller quantities in the ovaries and also
in the adrenal glands. These glands, which
lie on top of the kidneys, produce a com
pound called DHEA (dehydroepiandos
terone).
The research team is currently adminis
tering DHEA to lupus patients and finding
that the body converts it into androgens in
a ratio which is balanced so as to produce
only the mildest side effects such as acne.
McGuire emphasizes that early recogni
tion is crucial to effective treatment. In
mild cases administration of DHEA has
been effective. Trials are currently under
way to test the effects in more severe lupus
cases.

DHEA is a good replacement for pred
nisone — a cortisone derivative — which
has produced bad side effects such as osteo
porosis, sugar intolerance and muscle
fatigue. That is why DHEA makes sense,
because it obviates the need for prednisone.
This not only prevents side effects, but
increases desirable male characteristics
such as elevated bone and muscle mass.
The percentage of lupus is higher in
African-American women than in the gen
eral female population. McGuire says that
research shows that there is a genetic basis
for this phenomenon.
When asked if lupus does not get public
attention because it affects women, and
more often African-American women,

McGuire explained that although there are
two million sufferers in the United States,
there are levels of severity.
"Lupus has a large spectrum of serious
ness, from minor rashes all the way up to
kidney failure and brain stroke. Half of the
cases we see are not life threatening," he
said. "If a condition has less than a million
serious sufferers, it doesn't usually get
media play," he added.
McGuire also explained that lupus does
not have a uniform story like juvenile dia
betes or AIDS. Each case is different. For
example, only three percent of cases are
severe and 20-30 percent are mild. The rest
fall somewhere in the middle ground.
Information dissemination is difficult for
all rare diseases. Differences in social back
ground between researchers and lupus suf
ferers make this task particularly challeng
ing. Organizations such as the Lupus Foun
dation of America are creating greater
awareness and access to valuable and often
life-saving information.
