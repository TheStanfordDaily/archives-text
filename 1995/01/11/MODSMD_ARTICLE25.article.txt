"Why does it feel hot
I lout when it is 90
VVdegrees, even though
youWody is at 98 degrees?"

A: Wow, I wish I had been
wherever you spent your
Christmas break. Back in
Massachusetts we spent our

time making sure we
were still feeling our
fingers, rather than
worrying about get
ting an even tan.
But when it comes
to temperature, your
body knows what it
likes. Although 90
degrees is lower than
your body tempera
ture, it's not low
enough to cool you off
properly.
Your body is con
stantly producing
excess heat as a side

effect of all the cellular process
es that are going on. If it's cool
out, the air around you can
absorb this heat fast enough to
cool you down.
Now, according to Fick's
Law, heat flow is proportional
to the difference in tempera
ture. If the air temperature is
approaching the same tempera
ture as your body, it will not
absorb the heat fast enough to
get you cool.
Your brain can tell when it's
getting hot enough to overheat,
and starts sending you warning
messages: "You must chill ...
you must chill!"
It feels even hotter on
humid days, because then it's
harder to cool yourself by
sweating. When its muggy out,
the air already has a lot of
water vapor, so your sweat
doesn't evaporate as quickly.
This all raises the question
of why your body wants to be at
98 degrees anyway. Basically,
over the course of evolution, it
turned out that this tempera
ture was optimal for all the
molecular processes to function
properly.
There are some problems at
higher temperatures; complex
molecules such as proteins
start to unravel and break

down, and it simply takes more
energy to keep the internal fur
naces burning hotter.
But there are also problems
if you get too cold. Most chemi
cal processes happen more
slowly at lower temperatures;
this partially explains why
cold-blooded animals are slow
er when it is cold out. So, as
Aristotle told us all, follow the
middle path, and keep your
bodily thermostat at 98

degrees.
Of course, there is
one time when your
body turns up the
heat — during a fever.
Scientists don't have
this one totally fig
ured out yet, but
they're pretty sure
that a fever isn't
something bad that a
disease does to you;
it's actually your
body's way of fighting
whatever is threaten
ing your system.
There's a pretty

interesting experiment that
has been conducted to support
this observation. Cold-blooded
animals can't regulate their
own temperature; they have
to find a place that is at the
right temperature for them.
Scientists placed several
lizards in a long cage that was
warm at one end, hot at the
other, and the full range of
temperatures in between.
Each lizard moved to the tem
perature where he felt most
comfortable.
When the lizards are
healthy, they hang out around
the reptile version of 98
degrees. However, when they
get sick, the wander up to the
warmer areas of the cage, sug
gesting that there is an inter
nal mechanism that tells them
the body should be warmer to
fight off infection.
Researchers are still not
certain how raising the tem
perature helps. One suggestion
is that there is some process
involved in fighting off the
infection that works better at
higher temperatures. The
other is that the heat does
more harm to the invaders
that it does to your own body,
so you come out ahead after
the fever.
