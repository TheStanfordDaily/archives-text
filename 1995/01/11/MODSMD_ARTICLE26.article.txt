## Men's gymnastics to seek highest honors Athletes will train for international competition while hunting NCAA title 
### Sam Wu Allyson Mizoguchi Editorial staff 
A national championship just might
not be enough for Stanford men's gym
nastics coach Sadao Hamada this season.
"It's difficult to motivate myself and
the team this year," said Hamada. "I need
a new challenge after doing so well in
NCAAs — winning back-to-back national
championships in '92 and '93, and finish
ing second last year. I'm setting my goals
one step beyond NCAAs."
Specifically, Hamada is gearing his
team for competition originating beyond
the friendly confines of the United States.
He's looking towards the hefty challenge
that the 1995 World Championships in
Japan and the 1996 Atlanta Olympics will
offer. Hamada feels that at least four of
his current Cardinal athletes and two
graduates are up to the challenge at the
international level.
Assistant coach Jair Lynch, who gradu
ated two years ago and also competed in
the 1992 Olympics, is one of these likely
competitors. Mark Booth, a 1994 gradu
ate who has also joined the coaching
ranks, similarly has his sights set on earn
ing a place on the U.S. National Team.
Both Lynch and Booth are all-around
competitors.
Sophomores Jamie Ellis and Keith
Wiley, senior Josh Stein and freshman
Tim Dalrymple are the four all-around

"big guns" currently competing in the col
legiate ranks who will concentrate on the
international arena as well. Wiley reigns
as the current U.S. champion in vaulting,
while Stein boasts a first-place all-around
finish in the 1994 Pacific Alliance Meet in
New Zeland.
"Sadao has definitely added a more
international flavor to the team this
year," Wiley said. "All routines are start
ing at a higher level."
Routines at the international level
require a full bonus point to score a perfect
10. However, at the NCAA level, competitors
are granted a base score of 9.5. By including
more difficulty in routines, the Cardinal is
making a concentrated effort to achieve very
high scores at the NCAA level in preparation
for the international competition.
While some teams, like last year's
national champion Nebraska, concentrate
on execution of simpler routines, the Car
dinal traditionally has used different tac
tics. "We can do easy routines and execute
to win, but we're not going to do that,"
Hamada said. "We'll pursue difficulty,
and then execution."
Hamada, in his 23rd year of coaching
at Stanford, feels that training with inter
national quality gymnastics in mind will
make a championship-caliber NCAA per
formance come naturally. However, this
does not mean that the athletes are over-

Although Aaron Kushner and teammates missed the NCAA title last year, this season the men's gym team will take another
shot at the crown
looking collegiate competition.
"This year's a little different
than past years, with six guys going
for the national team," Stein said.
"However, the immediate goal is
definitely to win the NCAAs. I, per
sonally, would like to win."
While the primary focus appears
to be on Cardinal all-arounders in
Japan and Atlanta, the Stanford
team also boasts a strong lineup of
specialists. This year is a unique
one for national competition, as
individual event specialists can
compete for the first time.
"I don't see Sadao leaving any
body (the specialists or purely
NCAA-level athletes) behind,"
Stein said. "He's committed to
feveryonel."
Specializing in the floor routines
will be Ian Bachrach, Jason Cohen,
Clarence Miao, Andrew Manson
and Gabe Edelman. Evan Wells and
Oliver Demree will join Miao, Edel
man, and Cohen on the pommels.
Peter Hegi, Cohen, Manson, and
Bachrach will represent the Cardi
nal on the rings.
The vault will highlight
Bachrach, Cohen and Miao, while
Wells, Cohen, Edelman and Man
son will compete on the parallel
bars. Lastly, the high bar event will
feature Bachrach, Cohen and Miao.
Although the Cardinal lost three
powerhouse athletes, Jing-Wei
Liang, Chris Sey and Mark Booth,
to graduation, it gained four strong
recruits. In addition, Manson, who
saw only limited competition last
season, and Cohen, who sat out all
of 1994 with an injury, will rejoin
the team in force.
Hamada sees strength in every
event, but especially noted promise
in the parallel bars and the rings.
The gymnasts face their first
competition of the season at the
Spartan Open, which begins Eriday

at San Jose State. While the event
is not an important slop on the
Cardinal's way to the NCAA
Championships at Ohio State in
April, the Open will provide Hama
da a first glimpse at his freshmen.
In addition, the tourney is one of
the qualifying meets for the U.S.
Winter Cup, which will take place
Jan. 26-27 in Colorado Springs,

Col.
As for the remainder of the sea
son, Stanford needs only to keep
one thing in mind since this year
the NCAA will count only four
scores in each event rather than five
(of six total performances).
"Depth on each event doesn't
matter as much," Hamada said.
"The big guns just have to hit."
