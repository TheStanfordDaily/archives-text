## Men's gymnastics to seek highest honors Athletes will train for international competition while hunting NCAA title

A national championship just might
not be enough for Stanford men's gym
nastics coach Sadao Hamada this season.
"It's difficult to motivate myself and
the team this year," said Hamada. "I need
a new challenge after doing so well in
NCAAs — winning back-to-back national
championships in '92 and '93, and finish
ing second last year. I'm setting my goals
one step beyond NCAAs."
Specifically, Hamada is gearing his
team for competition originating beyond
the friendly confines of the United States.
He's looking towards the hefty challenge
that the 1995 World Championships in
Japan and the 1996 Atlanta Olympics will
offer. Hamada feels that at least four of
his current Cardinal athletes and two
graduates are up to the challenge at the
international level.
Assistant coach Jair Lynch, who gradu
ated two years ago and also competed in
the 1992 Olympics, is one of these likely
competitors. Mark Booth, a 1994 gradu
ate who has also joined the coaching
ranks, similarly has his sights set on earn
ing a place on the U.S. National Team.
Both Lynch and Booth are all-around
competitors.
Sophomores Jamie Ellis and Keith
Wiley, senior Josh Stein and freshman
Tim Dalrymple are the four all-around

"big guns" currently competing in the col
legiate ranks who will concentrate on the
international arena as well. Wiley reigns
as the current U.S. champion in vaulting,
while Stein boasts a first-place all-around
finish in the 1994 Pacific Alliance Meet in
New Zeland.
"Sadao has definitely added a more
international flavor to the team this
year," Wiley said. "All routines are start
ing at a higher level."
Routines at the international level
require a full bonus point to score a perfect
10. However, at the NCAA level, competitors
are granted a base score of 9.5. By including
more difficulty in routines, the Cardinal is
making a concentrated effort to achieve very
high scores at the NCAA level in preparation
for the international competition.
While some teams, like last year's
national champion Nebraska, concentrate
on execution of simpler routines, the Car
dinal traditionally has used different tac
tics. "We can do easy routines and execute
to win, but we're not going to do that,"
Hamada said. "We'll pursue difficulty,
and then execution."
Hamada, in his 23rd year of coaching
at Stanford, feels that training with inter
national quality gymnastics in mind will
make a championship-caliber NCAA per
formance come naturally. However, this
does not mean that the athletes are over-
