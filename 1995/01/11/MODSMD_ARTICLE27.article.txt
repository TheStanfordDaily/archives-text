## Fencers look to qualify for Pan American Games at San Francisco tourney 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Editorial staff 
The Stanford fencers are
heading down the home stretch
for an all-important chance to
compete in the Pan American
games.
Beginning this Friday, both
the men's and women's teams
will represent the Cardinal in
the Circuit Challenge of the
Americas, held at the Universi
ty of San Francisco through
next Tuesday. Apart from being
a prestigious tournament in its
own right, it also boasts the dis
tinction of being the Final North
American qualifier for the Pan
Am games.
All of the Cardinal male epee
fencers will make an appearance
in San Francisco. Of these,

Sasha Zucker and Geoff Don
aker especially expect to make a
strong impact for the team.
Based upon their seasons thus
far, Zucker and Donaker have a
strong chance of being selected
for the Junior World Team.
Also competing for the Car
dinal will be Chris Connel,
Doug Vanderbilt and Nick
Braven, a former Stanford
fencer who won the tourna
ment last year. Braven's victo
ry a year ago was just one high
light of the team's successful
season, as he garnered national
honors in foil, while his team
mate Sean McClain eventually
took the national champi
onship in epee.
These two Stanford greats
fenced in Fort Lauderdale dur
ing the winter holidays, where

they were reunited not as team
mates but as competitors.
Braven lost to McClain in a
close match-up that seemed to
hover at a tie at nine apiece.
However, McClain managed to
take Braven in the end and went
on to capture third place with a
15-9 upset.
According to men's head
coach Zoran Tulum, Braven's
surprising loss to his former
teammate may be attributed to
his current status as first-year
law student at Columbia.
Braven has not been able to
train for 10 months, and yet he
still placed fourth in Fort Laud
erdale. Tulum says that despite
his sparse training, Braven has
a substantial number of points
that could win him a spot on the
Pan Am team, having placed

first in Montreal earlier this
year without the edge of rigor
ous practice.
Tulum foresees a very suc
cessful performance at this
weekend's tournament, antici
pating a finalist in every
weapon. "I'm looking to see at
least one first place and four
Finalists," he said. "This is a
good opportunity for our
fencers to face strong interna
tional competition in a very
challenging tournament."
The women's team may have
a greater challenge to face than
the men, as the competition
does not grant the women an
opportunity to fence using the
foil. The Cardinal women will
only compete in epee, led by
junior Morgan Hoch and senior
Stephanie Wien. Both Hoch and
Wien will compete in the senior

events, while junior Laura
Smith will fence in the under-20
category.
According to women's head
coach Sherry Posthumous, the
women most likely will not qual
ify for the Pan Am games
because they have not been able
to attend other circuit events.

Such events allow the women to
accumulate points towards qual
ifying for the Pan Am team, but
academic obligations have made
this task difficult. However, the
convenient location of this
weekend's event gives the
women a chance to compete
without much conflict.
