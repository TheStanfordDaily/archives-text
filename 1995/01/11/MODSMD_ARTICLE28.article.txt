proof that numbers aren't everything when she helped her squad to its
second national title in three years over winter break. While the senior

who the Stanford players cited as the team's inspirational force.

the junior 126-pounder proved over winter break. Indeed, Cano cap
tured first place in the Country Classic held at Cal State Bakersfield
