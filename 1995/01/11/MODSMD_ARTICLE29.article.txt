# New Yorker makes his wishes for 1995
## 
### 
When I gave Santa my wish
list for 1995, I didn't
expect much â€” mostly
because I'm Jewish. But the New
Year has already brought me one
important wish: Stefan Marbury
chose not to attend and play bas
ketball at UCLA. This means that
the Felipe Lopez of next season's
freshman crop will not be lighting
it up against future Cardinal
squads, and Brevin Knight will
retain his position as the premier
point guard in the Pacific 10 Con
ference.

Now if only Santa could fulfill
my other humble wishes. I want:
1. A minor car accident involving
myself and Jason Kidd. Ching
ching. (Does anyone think he is
smart enough to protect his mil
lions by hiring a full-time chauf
feur? . .. Nah, what was I think
ing? He is the one who, after sign
ing with the Mavericks, said that
he wanted to "turn the team
around 360 degrees.")
2. Hip-hop music piped in during
warm-ups at Cardinal home bas
ketball games. Big East power
houses such as the Georgetown
Hoyas and the St. John's Red
Storm (by the way, why didn't we

think of that name when the
Indian rode off?) like to rev up
their crowds with "Murderer."
(You know, the song with the
lyrics, "I know what Bo don't
know. Touch them up and go,
'Uh-oh "')
3. A Halftime Sports Bar in every
city.
4. Magic Johnson to sign with the
Knicks, who are getting burned
by other teams' taller guards.
5. Cindy Crawford.
6. Cardinal linebacker Mike Hall
to win the Butkus Award. His
bone-crushing hit on the
Huskies' Napoleon Kaufman
(who benches 400 pounds) was
the high point of the Cardinal
season, for which Hall must be
rewarded.
7. Someone to explain how salsa
can now out-sell ketchup in
America. Doesn't anyone eat
french fries anymore?
8. Someone to explain how polls
show that the same team, the
Dallas Cowboys, are America's
hated and most loved sports fran
chise.
9. Someone to explain why the
best quarterback in New York sat
on the end of the Knicks' bench
during football season. (Rather
than signing Charlie Ward, the
Jets attempted to solve their
problems by hiring as their new
head coach Rich Kotite, loser of
his last six regular-season games
