# Another round of cuts?
## Stanford concerned about possible end to defense-funded research projects 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Posing yet another threat to university
research budgets, two U.S. Senators have
proposed eliminating federal defense fund
ing to higher education research projects in
order to pay for greater readiness, quality of
life and modernization programs in the mil
itary.
Leading research universities such as
Stanford — which gets about a quarter of
its research funding from the federal gov
ernment — are expected to be hardest hit by
any defense cuts Congress makes.
"It would obviously have very serious
consequences for Stanford and other major
universities, such as MIT," University
President Gerhard Casper said.
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen.
John Warner (R-Va.), both members of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, sent a
letter to President Clinton last month ask
ing him to defer $8 billion in fiscal year 1995

defense appropriations "for programs
which are wasteful and which contribute
little, if anything, to our defense posture."
"University research grants" make up
$1.1 billion of that amount.
Casper and Provost Condoleezza Rice
are "consulting broadly" both inside and
outside the University in order to form a
"contingency plan," said Geoffrey Cox, the
vice provost for institutional planning.
The proposed cuts are the latest in a se
ries of threats to universities who depend
on federal moneys to complement their own
research budgets. Last July, the House of
Representatives passed the defense appro
priations bill which cut the original $1.8 bil
lion budget in half, down to $900 million.
In its own defense appropriations bill,
passed later in the summer, the Senate voted
to cut only $82 million. A final conference
committee settled on an amount of about
$200 million, representing about 11 percent
of the original funding to universities
