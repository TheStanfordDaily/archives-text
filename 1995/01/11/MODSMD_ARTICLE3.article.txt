# Another round of cuts?
## Stanford concerned about possible end to defense-funded research projects 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Posing yet another threat to university
research budgets, two U.S. Senators have
proposed eliminating federal defense fund
ing to higher education research projects in
order to pay for greater readiness, quality of
life and modernization programs in the mil
itary.
Leading research universities such as
Stanford — which gets about a quarter of
its research funding from the federal gov
ernment — are expected to be hardest hit by
any defense cuts Congress makes.
"It would obviously have very serious
consequences for Stanford and other major
universities, such as MIT," University
President Gerhard Casper said.
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen.
John Warner (R-Va.), both members of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, sent a
letter to President Clinton last month ask
ing him to defer $8 billion in fiscal year 1995

defense appropriations "for programs
which are wasteful and which contribute
little, if anything, to our defense posture."
"University research grants" make up
$1.1 billion of that amount.
Casper and Provost Condoleezza Rice
are "consulting broadly" both inside and
outside the University in order to form a
"contingency plan," said Geoffrey Cox, the
vice provost for institutional planning.
The proposed cuts are the latest in a se
ries of threats to universities who depend
on federal moneys to complement their own
research budgets. Last July, the House of
Representatives passed the defense appro
priations bill which cut the original $1.8 bil
lion budget in half, down to $900 million.
In its own defense appropriations bill,
passed later in the summer, the Senate voted
to cut only $82 million. A final conference
committee settled on an amount of about
$200 million, representing about 11 percent
of the original funding to universities
While Stanford — which,
according to its 1994-95 budget,
gets $280 million from federal
support for research — is still
reeling from these cuts, faculty
members and administrators
said they only expect things to
get worse.
"The important point is not
whether this will succeed now or
later," Caspei said. "In the
House and Senate, every
research item will come under
very severe questioning."
Cox agreed that "the short
answer is, yes, we do need to be
very concerned about this, and a
lot of other signals coming out
of Washington. In times like
this where there's a lot of politi
cal uncertainty, you can't count
on anything."
Whatever may happen, the
prospective cuts have Stanford
community members worried.
Chemistry Prof. Richard
Zare, who wrote a letter to every
member of the Senate this sum
mer detailing the "devastating"
impact of the cuts, said that he
understands the need to trim
programs in a time like this, but

is opposed to "sudden, drastic
cuts. They hurt so much more
than the people who make them
realize," he said.
While McCain and Warner
have called for the cuts in order
to divert money to what they
feel are more pressing military

'In the House and

issues, such as military readi
ness and modernization, Zare
said that education and
research are just as important
in today's increasingly competi
tive world.
"It's easy to cut science and
education because in some sense
you are cutting your future, and
you don't see that right away,"
he said.
How the University will deal

with any cuts to come is still
unclear. Zare said he believes
Stanford will be hit harder than
most because "it's a leading uni
versity. The actual sites the
Department of Defense has
invested in have been targeted
and narrow."
"At this point, it is a little

early to focus
[on the specific
cuts] . . . you
cannot respond
to every threat
that someone
utters," Casper
said. "As every
body fights over
priorities, mat
ters relating to
science and

technology can be easily
lost. . . . It's enough to cause
sleepless nights."
"We feel the need to be extra
conservatively cautious in bud
geting for the coming year," Cox
said, though he added that there
is "no secret planning" happen
ing.
He also said he believes the
letter from McCain and Warner
should be taken seriously.
"These particular senators are
highly respected and will be in a
position to influence this issue,"
he said.
