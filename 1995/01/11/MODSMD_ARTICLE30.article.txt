# Men's tennis to take on Pac-10 opponents
## 
### Courtney Mann Contributing Writer 
After returning from a rusty
tournament in Southern Califor
nia last weekend, Stanford men's
tennis heads north for the Pacific
10 Indoor Individual Tennis
Championships in Seattle, Wash,
this weekend.
The structure of the singles
tournament requires each team
to send players into three brack
ets; its top two into the first
flight, its next two into the sec
ond, and its last two into the
third.
Upperclassmen Jeff Salzen
stein and Jim Thomas will repre
sent the Cardinal in the top flight.
Thomas earned his advanced
placement with two impressive
victories and a tough quarterfinal
match in last weekend's 1995

National Collegiate Tennis Clas
sic.
"For me, it's a real good oppor
tunity to play some top players,"
Thomas said.
Stanford will then send its
already seasoned freshmen, Scott
Humphries and Paul Goldstein,
into the second flight. Both
Humphries and Goldstein look to
bounce back from early exits in
Palm Springs. Juniors Ricky
Becker and Grant Elliot make
their first appearances of the new
year in the third and final flight.
In the doubles competition,
one team per school will challenge
for the title. Humphries and
Goldstein vie for their third con
secutive championship, as Becker
and Thomas and Salzenstein and
Elliot attempt to complete a Car
dinal sweep in the second and
third flights, respectively.
The tournament marks the
first Pac-10 event of the sea

son, followed by the head-to
head team competitions and a
Pac-10 Individual Outdoor
tournament in April.
"This is the first time to see
all of the Pac-10 competition,"
Thomas said. "Some of the
teams are working in some new
guys, so it's a great chance to
see that as well."

All but Washington State
and Oregon State will be repre
sented in Seattle.
We're looking forward to
it," said head coach Dick
Gould. "We have two great
tournaments coming off the
break. The weather's bad, so
it's nice to get some playing in
indoors."
