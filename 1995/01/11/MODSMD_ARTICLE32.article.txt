## 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
Stanford Police acquired an arrest warrant yes
terday for a parolee who allegedly robbed the
Durand building of computer equipment and soft
ware valued at roughly $21,000.
The Santa Clara County District Attorney's
office brought the case to the Palo Alto Municipal
Court which issued a warrant for the arrest of 31-
year-old Anthony Howard Moore of San Jose, who
has been charged with two counts of burglary and
faces $50,000 bail, according to Stanford Police
Sergeant John McMullen.
Moore is currently on parole from state prison
and has a prior criminal record, McMullen said.
He is accused of stealing a brand new Sun
Microsystems SPARC computer station worth
about $15,000 and a cash box containing $100
from the Department of Aeronautics and Astro
nomies. The burglary occurred sometime during
Jan. 2 or Jan. 3.
Moore was a temporary employee of the depart
ment who possessed a master key to the Durand

building to open the department and to lock up at
night. The key gave Moore access to other offices
within the building.
Police recovered the equipment along with
other stolen goods after they searched Moore's
apartment. The cash box containing the $100 was
never found.
According to McMullen, police found a stolen
Macintosh Powerßook computer, a laser printer
and software reported stolen by the Department
of Applied Mechanics last Friday.
Police also confiscated a second Powerbook 520
and are still trying to locate its owner.
Police were tipped off when they found out that
Moore quit his job immediately after he heard that
the burglary was about to be reported to the
police. An Aeronautics and Astronomies depart
ment administrator thought it was unusual for
Moore to quit so suddenly.
According to McMullen, the department
believed he did "good work" and he was even being
considered for a full-time position.
Stanford Police and other local law enforce
ment agencies are still looking for Moore.
