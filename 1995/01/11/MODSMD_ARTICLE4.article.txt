# No more napping in class
## Popular 'Sleep and Dreams' sees last quarter 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Just a year shy of its silver anniversary, this quar
ter will be the last call for Prof. William Dement's
popular Sleep and Dreams class.
"It's not 100 percent [certain!, but that's where
we're leaning very strongly," Dement said yesterday
afternoon, after delivering the first lecture of the
quarter to 300 students in Kresge Auditorium.
"I'm a senior person," he said, "and [the class]
does require raising funds each year."
Though the Human Biology Program does pro
vide some support for the class, Dement said he joked
with his class yesterday that "what I'd like to do is
stand at the door and collect the $501 figure students
pay in tuition for each class they attend."
"That would be $15,000 a day,"he calculated.
Although Dement said the prospects for the class
being taught in the future are dim, he stressed the

importance of educating undergrad
uate students about sleep disorders.
"Frank Sinatra retired several
times," he said, "and not doing [the

class] is kind of sad. ... I might change my mind."
Dement noted that "right now Stanford is one of
the only universities in the country that has this kind
of course. . . . Relating the need for sleep to sleep debt
and the impact on daytime behavior isn't done any
where."
Though the Sleep and Dreams course will not be
held next year, Dement will continue to work with
students and faculty in the School of Medicine, where
he was one of the few professors to put in the time to
teach undergraduates.
"In the med school, if you're teaching undergrad
uates, it's a favor," he said.
Even so, Dement said that he highly values his ex-


Dement
perience teaching the class since
1971. "It's incredibly important,"
he said. "I'd say every student in
the class has saved a life by know
ing about sleep disorders."
And he plans to leave behind
the tools for others to follow in his
footsteps. "We have a penulti

mate draft for a textbook so peo
ple will have the equipment to do
this elsewhere," he said. "I think
universities can make a big
impact through undergraduate
teaching."
For now, though, Dement said
students will only have one more
chance to take the well-known
class.
"If you really want to take this
course," he said, "you'd better do
it this year."
