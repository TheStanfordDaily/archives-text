# Stanford loses prized art collection
## 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
When the Stanford Museum of
Art finally reopens, it will be
missing one of the most
renowned graphic art collections
in America.
Ownership of the Anderson
Frint Collection — which the mu
seum has housed since 1991 — has
been transferred back to the Harry
W. and Mary Margaret Anderson
Foundation under a re-evaluation
of the agreement that originally
initiated the donation of the collec
tion, according to a statement re
leased by the University.
Museum Director Thomas

Seligman and Hilarie Faberman,
museum curator of modern and
contemporary art, refused to
comment on the transfer of own
ership.
The loss to Stanford of an im
portant resource is tragic because
the collection is "probably with
out equal," said Art History Prof.
Albert Elsen. "It is like the loss of
an important library."
The Andersons, owners of one
of the largest private collections
of contemporary art in the United
States, began their collection in
the mid-19605. They donated 650
prints and monotypes of Ameri
can artists to the University in
December 1991.

The print collection is worth
approximately $5 million and in
cludes the work of such noted
artists as Jennifer Bartlett,
Richard Diebenkorn, Jasper
Johns, Frank Stella and many
others.
"It [is] one of the great Ameri
can print collections," Elsen said,
because it is "so rich, extensive,
and deep in terms of its great
artists."
The Andersons' 1991 dona
tion was accompanied by a
$200,000 contribution toward an
endowment fund of $600,000 es
tablished for the purchase of con
temporary prints to add to the
collection.
Despite the transfer of own
ership, the Anderson Family
Foundation and Collection
intend to continue hosting
annual visits of the Committee
for Art at Stanford. They have

also agreed to make collections
available to the Stanford Art
Department's faculty and stu
dents and will also continue to
recruit Art Department stu
dents as interns.
Dee White, administrative
director of the Anderson Collec
tion, declined to comment, but
suggested that the foundation
may make a statement later this
week.
