# QB Frost leaving for Nebraska
## 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Scott Frost is going home. For
good.
The sophomore, a native of
Wood River, Neb., will transfer to
the University of Nebraska as of
winter quarter. Thrust into the
spotlight as soon as he came to
Stanford in the fall of 1993, Frost
said the decision to leave Stanford
was "a very long story." He de
clined any further comment.
Frost came to the decision to
transfer over winter break, ac
cording to his brother Steve, a se
nior on the Stanford football
team. Scott returned to campus
this week to say goodbye to
friends and pack up his room and
will leave for Nebraska today.
"He hasn't really been happy
since he got here," Steve Frost
said. "Over break he realized how
much he missed home and how
many friends he had at Nebras
ka."
According to his brother, Scott
made the decision only a few days
ago. He approached Nebraska
over winter break and was then
released from his Stanford obliga
tion.
"During this whole process, I
was Stanford's biggest support
er," Steve Frost said. "I stressed
the importance of the degree, but
I felt torn. He has to make the de
cision."
