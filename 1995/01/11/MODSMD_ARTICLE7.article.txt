# QB Frost leaving for Nebraska
## 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Scott Frost is going home. For
good.
The sophomore, a native of
Wood River, Neb., will transfer to
the University of Nebraska as of
winter quarter. Thrust into the
spotlight as soon as he came to
Stanford in the fall of 1993, Frost
said the decision to leave Stanford
was "a very long story." He de
clined any further comment.
Frost came to the decision to
transfer over winter break, ac
cording to his brother Steve, a se
nior on the Stanford football
team. Scott returned to campus
this week to say goodbye to
friends and pack up his room and
will leave for Nebraska today.
"He hasn't really been happy
since he got here," Steve Frost
said. "Over break he realized how
much he missed home and how
many friends he had at Nebras
ka."
According to his brother, Scott
made the decision only a few days
ago. He approached Nebraska
over winter break and was then
released from his Stanford obliga
tion.
"During this whole process, I
was Stanford's biggest support
er," Steve Frost said. "I stressed
the importance of the degree, but
I felt torn. He has to make the de
cision."
Handed the starting quarterback
position after senior Steve Sten
strom broke his finger in the.first
half of the Washington game, Scott
Frost led the team to a 46-28 upset
victory over the Huskies. However,
the next two games were not as suc
cessful, as Stanford fell to Rose
Bowl-bound Oregon 55-21 and Cali
fornia 24-23.
For the season, Frost was 33-for
-77 for 464 yards, two touchdowns
and five interceptions. On the
ground, he finished with a total of
38 carries for a total of 198 yards
and two touchdowns.
In the second game of the season,
Frost was moved to free safety in a
move by then-head coach Bill Walsh
to get "the best players on the field"
for as long of playing time as possi

ble. After the third game, a 34-10
loss to Arizona, Frost was one of
several underclassmen who criti
cized the team for a lack of leader
ship. As a defensive player, Frost
collected 18 tackles and one inter
ception before being moved back to
offense full-time in the seventh
game of the season.
Frost's promotion to the starting
position following Stenstrom's
injury added to the rifts among the
team. Senior quarterback Mark
Butterfield, who has one year of eli
gibility remaining, and sophomore
Tim Carey both discussed transfer
ring if the quarterback position was
not opened up during spring prac
tice.
After Walsh announced his resig
nation Nov. 28 and Tyrone Willing
ham was named his successor two
weeks later, the quarterback posi
tion was not guaranteed to anyone,
according to Willingham.
"I think [Scott's transferringl
didn't have to do with the coaching

change as much as people like to
believe," Steve Frost said.
According to Steve, Scott wanted
another year to mature before try
ing to move on to the NFL. Walsh
and his staff played Scott immedi
ately during his freshman year as
Stenstrom's back-up, all but elimi
nating a redshirt opportunity for
the younger Frost.
"Nebraska is best suited to what
he does well," Steve Frost said.
"And it's a promising situation,
with both ITommiel Frazier and
[Brookl Berringer (Nebraska's two
returning quarterbacks) leaving
after next year."
Frost, an option quarterback in
high school, should fit well in
Nebraska's high-powered running
game. The NCAA mandates a one
year loss of eligibility when transfer
ring from one Division I school to
another. Frost will be able to prac
tice with the team, but will be
unable to play in games until the
1996 season.
