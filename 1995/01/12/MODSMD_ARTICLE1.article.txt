# Passing the bill
## ASSU gears up for fee referendum 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
The special fee amendment
has passed the ASSU Senate
after a long, drawn-out fight, but
some senators and COP mem
bers are already renewing their
campaigns — this time to win
student support for the Jan. 25
general election to enact the bill.
However, those who have pas
sionate opinions about the
amendment, called CA-1, will
likely have to deal with student
apathy. In last year's regularly
scheduled spring election, only
about 40 percent of the total stu
dent body turned out to vote; this
time, many students do not even
realize there is an election.
"I am very unaware of the
ASSU special fee issue," said
Naveen Chopra, a senior com
puter science major. "I am proba
bly not going to vote."
Both sides agreed on the ne
cessity to mobilize and educate
students who are ignorant of the
bill's details or of the election.
The bill, which requires a two
thirds majority vote to pass,
would dramatically alter the cur
rent system of special fees, in
which graduate and undergradu
ate students must pay the same
fee and all students have the op
tion to refund the fee. The pro
posed amendment would, among
other things, create a separate
fee for graduates and undergrad-
uates and largely eliminate fee
refunds.
The chief proponent of the
amendment is the Council of Pres
idents, which will fund the cam
paign. Opponents of the bill
include undergraduate senators
Stephen Russell and Andre Vanier,
and graduate senators Sudarshan
Chawathe and Donald Aingworth.
Russell said that he is prepared
to "go directly to students and put
something under everyone's door
informing them of the colossal dis
appointment that is CA-1."
COP member Mork Murdock
also said he plans to campaign at
undergraduate residences, but
added that the best way to reach
graduate students will be at the
individual academic departments.
"We'll really be trying to get out
the word on what the amendment
actually does," Murdock said. "Will
the system increase fairness,
choice, and control?"
Murdock, who handles graduate
affairs for the COP, said the cur
rent special fee system is unfair to

graduate students, who oflen must
pay for programs but reap none of
the benefits or services.
"It comes down to one recogniz
ing that the current system is
unfair to graduate students. And
that needs to be righted," he said.
"If there is an increase in the
undergrad fee [with the new sys
tem] it is because undergraduates
choose to support these groups."
A necessaiy task for the propo
nents of the amendment will be to
justify to undergraduates the likely
increase in fees coupled with the
removal of the fee refund. Many
students have expressed concerns
over possibly losing their right to
refund their fee.
"Undergrade will most likely see
a small increase in their fees, but
they will be sure"to choose carefully
the groups they want to fund, said
graduate student Karen Seta, the
chairman of the task force which
submitted the special fee revisions.
Graduate students will likely see a
decrease in their fee, she added.
"Everyone will benefit because
this will allow groups to take out
their buffer," she said. Currently,
groups add an extra 30 percent to
the fee to account for the refunds,

Seta said.
Aingworth said that the separa
tion of graduates and undergradu
ates could lead to the denial of ser
vices to one of these two groups —
especially graduates — if a particu
lar special fee passes one election
and not another. He explained that
a fee is more likely to be approved
by undergraduates and rejected by
graduates than vice versa
Aingworth said his main prob
lem with the amendment is the
increased power and bureaucracy
it grants to the ASSU by eliminat
ing the fee refund.
"The fee refund, beyond the fact
that it is a right that people sought
for, is a big check that people have
on the ASSU power," he said. "It is
a way of illustrating how you're
unhappy."
Last spring quarter, 70 percent
of refunds were requested by grad
uate students. Last winter quarter,
graduate students grabbed 71 per
cent of fee refunds.
"The fee refund has primarily
been more for graduate student
rights than undergrad rights,"
Aingworth said. "The ASSU has
made an effort to hide the process
of refunding."
