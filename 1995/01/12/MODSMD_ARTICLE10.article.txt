## Chechnya ready to concede 
### 
GROZNY, Russia (AP) â€” Pale
and weary, Chechnya's president
came out of hiding yesterday and
admitted his forces couldn't beat a
relentless Russian army that has
turned Grozny into a smoking
ruin littered with corpses.
While Dzhokar Dudayev was
summoning reporters to his latest
hideout on the outskirts of the
besieged capital, fighting raged in
the city's shattered center. Rus
sian soldiers and Chechen rebels
blasted each other with guns and
rockets near the presidential
palace, once the center of Chech
nya's drive for independence.
Russian warplanes roared over
head and Chechen fighters dodged
artillery as they scuttled to rein
force positions in and around the
palace.
As in previous appearances,
Dudayev was dressed in military
fatigues, but the once-fierce sepa
ratist leader's message of defiance
was gone.
"We cannot physically confront
such an empire as Russia," he said,
flanked by heavily armed body
guards. "There is no other resolu

tion but a peaceful resolution."
He called for peace talks with
the Kremlin, but did not make
specific proposals. Previously he
had said he would not negotiate
peace unless Russian forces first
withdrew.
In Moscow, the Russian par
liament reconvened after a
three-week break, and a succes
sion of deputies arose to lam
baste the government's decision
to send troops to Chechnya.
"The country is in crisis," said
reformer Boris Fyodorov, calling
for a vote of no confidence. "We
have no executive authority, we
have no army. The army leader
ship has shown the army's total
inability to act."
One lawmaker said Russian
forces appeared en route to a
Pyrrhic victory; another said at
least 1,500 Russian soldiers had
been killed in the month-old
offensive to quash Chechnya's
secession drive.
In Brussels, the NATO allies
urged Moscow to end the violence
and negotiate a peaceful solution.
Dudayev, a former Soviet air

force general who declared
Chechnya's independence from
Russia in 1991, said the Chechen
hunger for independence could
not be destroyed, but "the issue
now is to stop the military action
and stop the senseless casualties
from both sides, senseless casu
alties and senseless destruction."
It was his first in-person
appearance since Russia launched
its ground offensive against
Grozny on Dec. 31.
Dudayev's Cabinet met earlier
yesterday to discuss grim mili
tary realities: Russian troops
closing in on the presidential
palace and other key installa
tions in the center of Grozny.
Dudayev claimed 18,000
Chechen civilians had been killed
in the war, far exceeding all pre
vious figures.
Once again, an informal truce
that brought a lull in the fight
ing in the morning was brief.
"We told them (Russians) to
collect their dead bodies to stop
the dogs from eating them," said
Arsan Ukayev, a colonel in the
Chechen forces.
