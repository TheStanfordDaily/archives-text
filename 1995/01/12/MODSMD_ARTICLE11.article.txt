# End to CA affirmative action?

### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Fresh from
a bitter battle over immigration, Califor
nia is heading into another civil rights
showdown, this time over affirmative
action.
Gov. Fete Wilson has called for an end
to legal preferences for minorities and
women, and conservatives are launching a
1996 ballot initiative to end affirmative
action in California schools and contracts.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson toured the state
yesterday to mount a "Resist and Regis
ter" campaign. The civil rights leader com
pared Wilson to George Wallace and other
Southern governors who fought integra
tion in the 1950s and 19605.
"Fete Wilson of California is liken unto
Wallace of Alabama — he wants to stand
in front of the schoolhouse doors," Jack
son said.
The proposed ballot measure, called the

"California Civil Rights Initiative," fol
lows Proposition 187, which was approved
by voters in November and denies school
ing and medical services to illegal immi
grants. It is not being enforced while the
courts consider whether it is legal.
The proposed affirmative action mea
sure also would meet a court challenge,
Jackson promised.
"But they would succeed in poisoning
the atmosphere and polarizing the state of
California with the continuous suggestion
that white males are being taken advan
tage of," he said of the proposal's support
ers.
The early push to stop the initiative
contrasts with the campaign against
Proposition 187, which geared up only six
months before the vote. Jackson said that
this time civil rights and women's rights
leaders will fight early and often.
