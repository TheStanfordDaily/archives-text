Storm heads south
MALIBU, Calif. (AP) - More
than a week of rain left Southern
California roads under a foot or more
of murky water yesterday, opened
huge sinkholes in freeways and
brought production of some of TV's
glamour shows to a halt.
Eight deaths statewide have been
blamed on nine days of storms that
have dropped more than a foot of
rain in some areas, caused up to $25
million in damage and forced the
evacuation of thousands of people
from the wine country north of San
Francisco to the fire-ravaged hill
sides of Southern California.
Emergency crews and homeown

ers used a brief respite in the weath
er to clear muck and debris, fortify
sandbag barriers and fill sinkholes.
But more rain was expected late yes
terday and today, and forecasters
said a stronger storm was off the
coast, poised to strike over the week
end.
Bomb threats
MANILA, Philippines (AP) —

ment confirmed receiving informa
