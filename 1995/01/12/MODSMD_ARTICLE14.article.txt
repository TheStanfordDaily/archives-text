Student representation
on University Cabinet a
possibility but not a right

WORKING TO HAVE more
student say in the formula
tion and implementation of
University policies, the Council of
Presidents is now pushing to get a
student on the University Cabinet.
The Cabinet — an administrative
body comprised of the President,
Provost, school deans and heads of
the Hoover Institution and SLAC —
meets one or two times a month to
"recommend and review principles,
policies and rules of University-wide
significance," according to a Cabinet
statement. The COP would like to
enter this rather exclusive club and
get a voice in on matters that affect
the students, since many of these
policies do.
The COP has a good point, for if
respected student input were heard
early, this could prevent serious con
flicts over new or drastically altered
policies. An example of post-Cabinet
conflict was the debate over changes
to the Stanford Fund regarding how
and when student groups could
solicit money from alumni. When it
was implemented in September, the
policy — which has since been
revoked due to strong student dis
approval — prohibited organiza
tions from requesting money from
alumni who have not given to that
group in the past five years.
If a student member had been on
the Cabinet, or at least had taken
part in the Cabinet discussions, the
compromise could have been
arranged even before the final policy
was implemented, saving headaches
for all parties involved.
At the same time, however, hav
ing a student on the Cabinet could
prove to be a bigger problem than it
seems.
For one, given that student and
COP turnover occurs more often
than at the administration level, it

would be hard to ensure consistency
of opinion. Also, by observing ASSU
meetings, one can see that there is
no central student opinion, especial
ly between graduates and under
graduates.
Additionally, the Cabinet meets
in the summer, which would require
the student member to come back to
campus three times before school
begins, a potential difficulty for
many working students. While it
might be more convenient if the stu
dent lived near campus, the COP
certainly would not want to pick
their representative based solely on
location.
Third, and probably most impor
tant, much of what the Cabinet dis
cusses does not directly affect stu
dents, and therefore should be con
sidered only among the heads of the
University's various schools. While
student input could be valuable on
discussions regarding "the centrali
ty of academic objectives" (another
mission of the Cabinet), there is
probably not a great deal that they
could add to meetings on faculty
affairs, personnel policy or facilities
strategic planning.
Asking for student input on the
Cabinet is not a new request, but
in this year of increased student
voices on administrative matters
— thanks to frequent COP meet
ings with Building 10, the Com
mission on Undergraduate Educa
tion and President Casper's desire
to talk with students as often as
possible — the administration
should look into implementing this
suggestion, despite its potential
difficulties.
At the same time, the administra
tion also has a right to meet
amongst themselves and maintain
their own forum to discuss Univer
sity goings-on and review Universi
ty rules. Thus, it is when these poli
cies or rules are going to be dramat
ically changed that the Cabinet
should seriously think about work
ing with the COP and inviting a stu
dent representative to discussions
whose final outcome will affect stu
dents in the future.
