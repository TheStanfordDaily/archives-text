Humanities and Social Sciences should not be conflated

AS MEMBERS OF the Humanities
faculty, we heartily endorse Profes
sor Sheehan's eloquent defense of
the proposed science requirement in the
pages of the Daily last quarter. A course of
the kind he envisions would be an invalu
able addition to the current undergraduate
curriculum.
We would like to take issue, however,
with his essentially binary definition of our
educational culture, according to which the
intellectual life of the University "is divided
by powerful methodological, epistemologi
cal and ... cultural differences between the
Sciences and Engineering on the one side,
and the Humanities and most of the Social
Sciences on the other." For by lumping
together the Social Sciences and the
Humanities, Professor Sheehan blurs a set
of distinctions which are no less fundamen
tal than those between what he calls "the
cultures of the techies and the fuzzies."
First, whereas the Social Sciences — as
the designation "social" implies — general
ly focus on group behavior, and conse
quently rely heavily on statistical analysis,
the Humanities are generally concerned
with the products of individual human
minds, and consequently rely heavily on
verbal analysis.
Second, whereas the Social Sciences, by
analyzing political systems, economic
structures, class divisions, and so forth, can

give us a comprehensive picture of a partic
ular society seen from the outside, the
Humanities can offer us a view of that soci
ety seen from the inside, so to speak. From
its philosophy and religion we can fmd out
what kind of world its members thought
they lived in, from its history we can learn
how they acted in that world, and from its
literature, art and music we can discover
what it felt like to believe and act as they
did.
Third, whereas Social Sciences resemble
the Natural Sciences to the extent that
their subject matter consists of a mass of
raw data waiting to be given order and sig
nificance by the ordering mind of the ana
lyst, the Humanities are concerned with
the products of the creative intelligence of
other men and women, the fiction of Jane
Austen, the philosophy of Confucius, the
theology of St. Augustine, the art of Botti
celli. Humanistic subject matter, that is to
say, already has order and significance
built into it, and it is studied not for the
sake of the theories which can be derived
from it but for the insight it can give us
into the human condition.
In recognition of these and other differ
entia, the curriculum at Stanford and most
other universities has for many years been
divided into not two but three areas of
study, the Sciences, the Social Sciences and
the Humanities. Pace C.P. Snow's dualistic

view of human culture, the intellectual
world, like Caesar's Gaul, consists of three
parts.
Professor Sheehan's conflation of the
Social Sciences and the Humanities con
cerns us, however, not only because it mis
represents the structure of our academic
culture but because it forms the basis for
the Commission on Undergraduate Educa
tion's recommendations concerning
"breadth requirements" (section 5 of the
report). After noting that Areas 7 (Litera
ture and the Fine Arts), 8 (Philosophical,
Social and Religious Thought) and 9
(Social and Behavioral Sciences) of the cur
rent distribution requirement system con
tain "too many" courses, the Commission
goes on to propose a single "Humanities
and Social Sciences Core" requirement
that almost all courses in those areas could
be used to satisfy. Quite apart from the evi
dent lapse in logic — if the problem with
Areas 7, 8 and 9 is that "too many" courses
have been certified to fulfill them, the way
to solve the problem is to limit the number
of certified courses, not to expand it still
further — what disturbs us about this pro
posal is its refusal to recognize the Human
ities and Social Sciences as distinct, albeit
complementary, disciplinary categories. If
CUE's recommendations are accepted, stu
dents will merely be "required to take
three courses in the humanities or social

sciences outside of their majors" (p. 21). If
they wish, students will be able to take all
three courses in either the Humanities or
the Social Sciences and ignore the other
area completely. Virtually any three cours
es will do, apparently, as long as they are
not science courses.
In earlier discussions of the Western
Culture requirement, faculty specializing
in African, Asian and South American cul
tures rightly objected to the designation
"Non-Western" as a curricular category.
Although the CUE report does not actually
use the term "Non-Scientific" to describe
the Social Sciences and the Humanities, its
proposal effectively creates just such a cate
gory. We would like to suggest that the
proposed requirement does rather less
than justice to the educational value of
both the Social Sciences and the Humani
ties. Both kinds of knowledge, we believe,
the objective scientia of the Social Sciences
and the subjective experientia of the
Humanities, are necessary if we are to
achieve even an approximate understand
ing of our fellow human beings. The "any
thing but science" requirement proposed
by CUE would be a disservice to our stu
dents and a disgrace to Stanford Universi
