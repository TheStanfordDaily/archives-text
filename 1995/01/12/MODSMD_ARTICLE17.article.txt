## Applications or apocalypse ? 
### 
IF THE APOCALYPSE happened
tomorrow, gotta figure none of us would
have to go to grad school — at all.
Just think: no GREs and no MCATs; no
job applications and no taking Stats 60
again to get the B+ this time. No worrying
about law school or med school or nothing.
Just kick back, put your feet up, revel in the
simple bliss of Eden and watch all the petty
antics of mortality become obsolete.
Most eschatologically minded predic
tions tell us that we've got some time to wait
before any of the fun begins, but graduation
is coming around soon and I'm not sure I've
got all that much time. If we don't get up off
our spiritually maiaised tuchases and make
the Apocalypse happen soon, we're all
gonna be hosed into living the same crappy
old lives that have been making humans
miserable for eons.
Personally, I won't stand for it. So I'm
setting up shop here, and I entreat all to
join. A messianic cult run right in Leland
Stanford's own front yard; a free-for-all of
ecclesiastic hope filled with promises of spir
itual, not academic or monetary, fulfill
ment. We'll say a few prayers, light a few
fires, sacrifice a few garden burgers and get
the Day of Judgment rolling already.
And you don't even have to believe in any
anything to join in, you just have to want
the trend of ambition to end — everybody's
invited.
Now don't go thinking that Uncle Mikey
has gone all megalomaniacal slap happy and
thinks he's gonna have any part in this. I

wouldn't take the responsibility of being
News Editor at the Daily, much less be any
one's savior. I'm nobody's Messiah anytime
soon — I don't even make the height
requirement at the sperm bank.
I just want to run a little PR, bring it all
about and have a room at the Holiday Inn
waiting for when the Messiah gets here.
Light the fireworks and watch the display,
as it were. We can even petition to make it a
3 unit class:
RLGN 666, Undergraduate Colloquium:
The End of Days, an experiential approach
(Graduates enroll in Soc 105).
Not to mention all the extra credit I could
get for Psych of Mind Control.
Now I know full well how many others
have tried just the same thing — some end
up in jail, others in conflagration; some
make the cover of Newsweek, some Play
boy. But the difference between my cult and
all the rest is that mine is going to make it
happen.
You see, I'm not in it for the money or
the mind games; I don't care about the press
coverage or the sex; my only concern is with
bringing the Messiah here to change the
world and make it all a perfect tanning salon
where the daiquiris keep coming and I
won't have to get a job any time soon.
Okay maybe a little sex too.
And oh the magic of it all. Finally bring
an end to the sadistic cycle of birth, life,
graduation and death. Angels and demons
ordering pitchers at the Coffee house. Plato
rising from the grave to tell vour TA, "No, I

never really meant it that way." Everybody
running around with buttons that say:
"Kiss Me, I'm Righteous."
And why not do it here? Everyone affili
ated with Stanford already thinks this cam
pus is the center of the Universe, why not
run the Ultimate Judgment out of Kresge
and make it official. There's more than
enough parking. It'll be like finals, only a lit
tle less stressfull (eternal damnation is easi
er to deal with than getting a C, right?).
And a great perk is that we'll be able to
settle so many of the religious debates we're
constantly shooting each other over. Be it
Muhammed, Jesus, Ben-David or Buddha,
we'll finally fmd out who's been right all
along. Which is fine so long as everyone
promises not to say "I told you so" if their
horse comes in.
Imagine: the four horsemen of the Apoc
alypse — War, Famine, Pestilence, and
Oprah — come riding up a freshly paved
Palm Drive. They ask directions to Fred
Savage's room. Good and Evil wage war like
it was Big Game, except Good makes the
two-point conversion.
We'll watch the heavenly players battle it
out like it was a Vegas show, hoping the
Good guys (whoever that is) win. And we'll
know that it was all our doing.
It's either that or co-term.

Michael Green is pretty serious about all
this. E-mail goodstuf@leland if you want
more info or just want to hear a parable.
