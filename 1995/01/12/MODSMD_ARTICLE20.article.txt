Although a suspicious package received at the
Fairchild Science Building over winter break did
not contain a bomb, it still received an explosive
reaction from its recipients.
According to Stanford Police, the Department
of Microbiology and Immunology received a mani
la envelope on Dec. 28 stuffed with used condoms.
A foul odor emitted by the package prompted a
department administrator to notify the authori
ties, said Stanford Police Sgt. John McMullen.
"Given its suspicious nature, we had a bomb
technician check the package for explosives," said
McMullen.
Instead of a bomb, police discovered several
used condoms and a liquid material authorities
believe is seminal fluid, he said.
This is not the first time a package containing
used condoms has been sent to the Fairchild Sci
ence Building. The first such envelope was
received just six months ago.
The return address on the most recent package

read "R.T.S.; Burbank, CA." Law enforcement
officers are unable to determine whether or not
the package was really sent from Burbank
because the postmark was illegible.
Stanford Police have turned the case over to the
U.S. Postal Inspector for further investigation.
Lost and (quickly) found
A patient at Stanford Hospital was safely
returned last Thursday after police found her
wandering on campus.
The woman was receiving psychiatric treat
ment at the hospital and managed to wander out
of the hospital, McMullen said.
The woman did not get very far. Police spotted
her just minutes from the facility at the intersec
tion of Via Ortega and Campus Drive and prompt
ly returned her to the hospital.
"We have this happen every so often,"
McMullen said, when someone is momentarily left
alone and wanders off.
