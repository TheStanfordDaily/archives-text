### Courtney Mann Contributing writer 
Packing a No. 5 national ranking, an undefeated
Pacific 10 Conference record (2-0) and a nine-game
winning streak, the 11-1 Stanford women's basket
ball team lifted off yesterday on a weekend road trip
that will take it through the deserts of Arizona. The
itinerary consists of a Thursday night visit to Tempe
for a game against the Arizona State Sun Devils fol
lowed by a stop in Tucson Saturday to take on the
Wildcats of the University of Arizona.
After two sound victories against Washington and
Washington State in the opening week of Pac-10

play, the Cardinal looks to continue on the way to its
sixth conference championship in seven years. This
weekend's road games represent Stanford's first
serious threats away from Maples since the Decem
ber trip that conjures up nightmares of the infamous
Tennessee fiasco.
However, the Cardinal has erased any doubts
since that embarrassment by rattling off nine
straight victories, seven at home and two on the
road.
Stanford owes its recent offensive explosion, a
team average of 96 points per game in the last seven
games, largely to the phenomenal play of sophomore
Kate Starbird who has poured in 21 points a game in
her last six games.
The Cardinal looks to extend its streak to eight
Thursday night against an ASU squad that returns
four players (two starters) from last year's team.
Senior guard Tiffany Krahenbul leads the Sun Dev
ils' offensive attack after posting a 15.6 point-per
game average last season. Sophomore Molly Tuter
poses as ASU's inside threat, scoring 12.7 points a
game and cleaning the glass for 7.1 rebounds a game.
"Krahenbul is a tough outside shooter, and they
force a lot of turnovers," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. Such defensive pressure will force Kate
Paye to effectively bring the ball up court and will
make offensive execution a key for the Cardinal.
Stanford thus far has utilized its depth in order to
match up against any style its opponent has thrown
in its face. The Cardinal opened the season by going
