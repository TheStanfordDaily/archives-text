# No. 12 ASU will put on the pressure in Pac-10 home opener
## 
### Daniel Kao Contributing writer 
Despite the cold, wet weather,
things should definitely heat up
when the 12th-ranked Arizona
State Sun Devils (11-2, 1-0 Pacific
10 Conference) come to town to
take on the Cardinal men's basket
ball team (10-1,1-1 Pac-10) tonight
in Stanford's Pac-10 homeopener.
"These games are fun," said
senior forward Andy Poppink.
"They move up and down, and
they're a little bit faster. We're try
ing to win all our games at home.
This is our first home game this
Pac-10 season. There's going to be
a lot of excitement."
The Cardinal is seeking to
rebound from a 63-77 loss at Wash
ington State last weekend and get
back to its winning ways. Mean
while, the Sun Devils have come
back strong from a star-crossed,
injury-racked 1993-94 season and
enter Maples Pavilion as blistering
hot as the Arizona sun, winning
their last six games, which included
a 53-52 victory over then ninth
ranked Pac-10 powerhouse Ari
zona.
Three of ASU's other wins have
also come against opponents
ranked at the time, including
Michigan, Maryland and Okla
homa State. The Sun Devils
thumped Old Dominion 71-52 in
their most recent victory.
"They're playing with a lot of
confidence," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. "You've
got to come out and be prepared to
win at home. That's our job at this
point in time."
The Sun Devils' biggest star is
All-Pac-10 center Mario Bennett.
Bennett has been victimizing oppo
nents for an average of 16.5 points
per game to go along with a field
goal percentage of 58.4 percent, 7.6
rebounds per game and a confer
ence-leading 3.0 blocks per game.
Against Old Dominion, Bennett
tied a school record with eight
rejections.
"There's no question Bennett's
a factor," Montgomery said. "You
don't want to let Bennett in a one
on-one situation for 40 minutes a

game. You need to make sure some
one else is around that can help
when it's possible.
"They've got good inside scoring
with Bennett who's a premier play
er, and they've got real good shoot
ing with both Ron Riley (14.5 ppg)
and Isaac Burton (15.8 ppg), both
exceptional perimeter shooters."
Freshman center Tim Young
has been assigned the task of
shackling Bennett. Arizona,
employing a collapsing defense,
held Bennett to just eight points, so
it is more than likely that Young
will have help too.
"We'll do fine against Bennett,"
Young said. "All we have to do is
play good team defense. I think we
can shut him down."
Bennett might not even be the
Cardinal's biggest problem consid
ering the high-pressure heat of the
Sun Devil man-to-man, run-and
jump defense which leads the con
ference with 11.4 steals per game.
Along with Riley (2.2 steals per
game), Sun Devil floor leader "Ice"
Burton (2.0 steals per game) is
ASU's defensive stopper and the
spark plug for the pressure they
run. The senior guard has consis
tently gone up against the opposi
tions' leading scorer and has kept
them frigid. Arizona's Damon
Stoudamire faced off against Bur
ton averaging 20.7 points, but left
with just five. The onus will now lie
upon Cardinal guard Dion Cross,
Stanford's leading scorer at 17.3
ppg, to melt "Ice."
"Arizona State likes to get up
and down the floor, shoot the ball
from out, and get some mileage off
their pressure," Montgomery said.
"So we need to be prepared to have
good spacing, make good decisions
with the basketball, and make
them pay for the pressure."
Stanford's ability to handle the
pressure will certainly be a key to
the game. Unfortunately, Cardinal
press-breaker extraordinaire guard
Brevin Knight enters the contest
nicked with an injury to his leg.
"Brevin's status has not
changed," Montgomery said.
"Practice has still been limited and
minutes are still going to be limited.
It's a problem we're going to deal
with as best we can."
Another easy way to diffuse the
ASU pressure is just to prevent the

Sun Devils from scoring.
"Their pressure's less of a con
cern when they're not scoring,
which puts a premium on our
defense," Montgomeiy said. "They
pressure from scoring so if we do a
better job defensively, don't let
them score a high-percentage, that
means pressure's less of a factor. It
all goes hand in hand. We've got to

defend. We've got to do a good job
on our end of the floor getting good
shots and getting some board cover
age on the offense, so they're not
running the floor."
That board coverage should tilt
in the Cardinal's favor because of
the smaller ASU lineup. Stanford
will likely go with a taller lineup
now against the speedy Sun Devils

to try to gain that edge.
"We're going to need to play big
ger and try to take advantage of
being a little bit bigger and
stronger," Montgomery said.
Some easy buckets, a scarcity
last weekend up in the great North
west, won't hurt the Cardinal cause
either.
"We just have to go out and play

our game," Knight said. "Go back
to playing good defense, getting
out on the break and scoring easy
baskets. That's something we
didn't do up against Washington
State. Just play and have fun.
There should be motivation for
our team to play ASU because
they're one of the best teams in the
country."

The meltdown at Maples tonight
takes on added importance for the
Cardinal because it's a home game,
and to survive in the topsy-turvy
Pac-10 thus year, where parity is the
buzz word, teams need to win at
home.
"It should be fun," Young said.
"Arizona State is doing really well
now so it should be a tough battle."

State Sun Devils (11-2, 1-0 Pacific

and to survive in the topsy-turvy
Pac-10 thus year, where parity is the
buzz word, teams need to win at
home.
"It should be fun," Young said.
"Arizona State is doing really well
now so it should be a tough battle."
Despite the cold, wet weather,
things should definitely heat up
when the 12th-ranked Arizona
State Sun Devils (11-2, 1-0 Pacific
10 Conference) come to town to
take on the Cardinal men's basket
ball team (10-1,1-1 Pac-10) tonight
in Stanford's Pac-10 homeopener.
"These games are fun," said
senior forward Andy Poppink.
"They move up and down, and
they're a little bit faster. We're try
ing to win all our games at home.
This is our first home game this
Pac-10 season. There's going to be
a lot of excitement."
The Cardinal is seeking to
rebound from a 63-77 loss at Wash
ington State last weekend and get
back to its winning ways. Mean
while, the Sun Devils have come
back strong from a star-crossed,
injury-racked 1993-94 season and
enter Maples Pavilion as blistering
hot as the Arizona sun, winning
their last six games, which included
a 53-52 victory over then ninth
ranked Pac-10 powerhouse Ari
zona.
Three of ASU's other wins have
also come against opponents
ranked at the time, including
Michigan, Maryland and Okla
homa State. The Sun Devils
thumped Old Dominion 71-52 in
their most recent victory.
"They're playing with a lot of
confidence," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. "You've
got to come out and be prepared to
win at home. That's our job at this
point in time."
The Sun Devils' biggest star is
All-Pac-10 center Mario Bennett.
Bennett has been victimizing oppo
nents for an average of 16.5 points
per game to go along with a field
goal percentage of 58.4 percent, 7.6
rebounds per game and a confer
ence-leading 3.0 blocks per game.
Against Old Dominion, Bennett
tied a school record with eight
rejections.
"There's no question Bennett's
a factor," Montgomery said. "You
don't want to let Bennett in a one
on-one situation for 40 minutes a

game. You need to make sure some
one else is around that can help
when it's possible.
"They've got good inside scoring
with Bennett who's a premier play
er, and they've got real good shoot
ing with both Ron Riley (14.5 ppg)
and Isaac Burton (15.8 ppg), both
exceptional perimeter shooters."
Freshman center Tim Young
has been assigned the task of
shackling Bennett. Arizona,
employing a collapsing defense,
held Bennett to just eight points, so
it is more than likely that Young
will have help too.
"We'll do fine against Bennett,"
Young said. "All we have to do is
play good team defense. I think we
can shut him down."
Bennett might not even be the
Cardinal's biggest problem consid
ering the high-pressure heat of the
Sun Devil man-to-man, run-and
jump defense which leads the con
ference with 11.4 steals per game.
Along with Riley (2.2 steals per
game), Sun Devil floor leader "Ice"
Burton (2.0 steals per game) is
ASU's defensive stopper and the
spark plug for the pressure they
run. The senior guard has consis
tently gone up against the opposi
tions' leading scorer and has kept
them frigid. Arizona's Damon
Stoudamire faced off against Bur
ton averaging 20.7 points, but left
with just five. The onus will now lie
upon Cardinal guard Dion Cross,
Stanford's leading scorer at 17.3
ppg, to melt "Ice."
"Arizona State likes to get up
and down the floor, shoot the ball
from out, and get some mileage off
their pressure," Montgomery said.
"So we need to be prepared to have
good spacing, make good decisions
with the basketball, and make
them pay for the pressure."
Stanford's ability to handle the
pressure will certainly be a key to
the game. Unfortunately, Cardinal
press-breaker extraordinaire guard
Brevin Knight enters the contest
nicked with an injury to his leg.
"Brevin's status has not
changed," Montgomery said.
"Practice has still been limited and
minutes are still going to be limited.
It's a problem we're going to deal
with as best we can."
Another easy way to diffuse the
ASU pressure is just to prevent the

Sun Devils from scoring.
"Their pressure's less of a con
cern when they're not scoring,
which puts a premium on our
defense," Montgomeiy said. "They
pressure from scoring so if we do a
better job defensively, don't let
them score a high-percentage, that
means pressure's less of a factor. It
all goes hand in hand. We've got to

defend. We've got to do a good job
on our end of the floor getting good
shots and getting some board cover
age on the offense, so they're not
running the floor."
That board coverage should tilt
in the Cardinal's favor because of
the smaller ASU lineup. Stanford
will likely go with a taller lineup
now against the speedy Sun Devils

to try to gain that edge.
"We're going to need to play big
ger and try to take advantage of
being a little bit bigger and
stronger," Montgomery said.
Some easy buckets, a scarcity
last weekend up in the great North
west, won't hurt the Cardinal cause
either.
"We just have to go out and play

our game," Knight said. "Go back
to playing good defense, getting
out on the break and scoring easy
baskets. That's something we
didn't do up against Washington
State. Just play and have fun.
There should be motivation for
our team to play ASU because
they're one of the best teams in the
country."

The meltdown at Maples tonight
takes on added importance for the
Cardinal because it's a home game,
and to survive in the topsy-turvy
Pac-10 thus year, where parity is the
buzz word, teams need to win at
home.
"It should be fun," Young said.
"Arizona State is doing really well
now so it should be a tough battle."
