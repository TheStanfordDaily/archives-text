## 
### Ratha Harntha Contributing writer 
Time heals all wounds. With
the three week winter break, the
Stanford wrestling team had its
time and now will have a full line
up heading into this Saturday's
Aggie Open at UC-Davis.
The Cardinal was crippled
with injuries early in the year
with up to five starters out at one
time. But at last Sunday's Coun

try Classic Open at Bakersfield,
nine of the 10 starters wrestled,
including the return of junior co
captain Jimmy Aguirre and
junior Tod Surmon, who both
placed in last year's NCAA
Championships.
"Everyone seems to be doing
well," said Surmon, who had
been out with an elbow injury.
"I'm getting better, but I'm not

quite 100 percent."
Aguirre, who has recovered
from a neck injury, has been
slowed by knee problems but will
be ready to compete this week
end. Junior 167-pounder Sahlan
Martin, the only starter who has
not wrestled this year, may also
be in competition form. Even
without Martin, Stanford will
still take 20 to 25 wrestlers. Also,
the open tournament will allow
the redshirt freshmen to com
pete.
"Open tournaments can be
really tough," said the 150-pound
Surmon, who has placed second at
the Aggie Open twice. "I plan to
win it. I know I am good enough to
win it."
Senior co-captain Jay Jackson,
junior Matt Cano and sophomores
Bryan Vaniman and Ryan Barnes
also have strong chances of win
ning the tournament, Jackson
said. Jackson, who has won the
Aggie Open the last three years,
won the 134 lbs. division at the
Country Classic and Cano tri
umphed in the 126 lbs. class.
"I've had a lot of luck in this
tournament," Jackson said.
Aguirre will wrestle in the
same weight division as Jackson
and will be the toughest opponent
Jackson will face, Jackson added.
"The Aggie is small and not as
intense |as the Country Classic],"
said head coach Chris Horpel.
"But the Open can be really
tough."
Anyone can enter an open tour
nament, which means that former
all-Americans will be competing.
"Generally, wrestlers get better
until the age of 30," Horpel added.
The same number of wrestlers
should place in the Aggie Open as
in the Country Classic Open,
where 12 Cardinal finished in the
top eight, according to Aguirre. "A
lot of our guys are pretty consis
tent," he said.
