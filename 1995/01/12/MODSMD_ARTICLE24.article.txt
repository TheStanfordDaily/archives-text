# Men's volleyball opens season in Santa Cruz
## 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
This year Stanford is striving for the clean
sweep in volleyball. The women captured the
NCAA crown a couple of weeks ago and now
it's the men's turn.
With that lofty objective in mind, the Car
dinal spikers will ring in the new season with
a non-league tournament down in Santa Cruz
on Saturday.
Fielding a team of seven freshmen, seven
sophomores and only two upperclassmen
offering more than a year's worth of playing
time, the young No. 2 Stanford squad still fig
ures to Cakewalk through the event.
After posting a 20-9 record and securing
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
League title last year, the Cardinal graduated
only two starters and is expected to return All-

American Mike Lambert and National Fresh
man of the Year Mike Fuerbringer to the
offense this weekend.
Joining them will be swing hitter Aaron
Garcia and middle blockers Michael Hoefer
and Keenan Whitehurst. Rounding out the
starting six is sophomore Stewart Chong, who
will be called upon this season to replace four
time Ail-American Canyon Ceman as the set
ter.
"During this tournament, one of our goals
is to solidify the starting lineup," said head
coach Ruben Nieves. "Right now we have Hoe
fer and Whitehurst as middle blockers, but
since middle blocking is our deepest position,
that's also the position where there is the
most doubt in the coach's mind as to who the
two starters should be."
Competing for net time as a middle blocker
this season will be senior Brian Garrett, who

can offer experience and a solid .432 hitting
percentage up the middle.
Whitehurst, who is slated to start this
weekend, however, has come on as the front
runner for the starting job, despite his status
as a true freshman this year.
"He had a tremendous fall season and was
very consistent on the court," Nieves said.
"We knew he was good when we recruited
him, but he turned out to be even better than
we thought."
With all that firepower in Stanford's arse
nal this weekend, the other tournament teams
don't figure to stand much of a chance. The
Golden Bears of California, Stanford's tradi
tional rival, field only a club team, one which
the Cardinal has consistently upended
through the years.
