# Men's volleyball opens season in Santa Cruz
## 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
This year Stanford is striving for the clean
sweep in volleyball. The women captured the
NCAA crown a couple of weeks ago and now
it's the men's turn.
With that lofty objective in mind, the Car
dinal spikers will ring in the new season with
a non-league tournament down in Santa Cruz
on Saturday.
Fielding a team of seven freshmen, seven
sophomores and only two upperclassmen
offering more than a year's worth of playing
time, the young No. 2 Stanford squad still fig
ures to Cakewalk through the event.
After posting a 20-9 record and securing
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
League title last year, the Cardinal graduated
only two starters and is expected to return All-

American Mike Lambert and National Fresh
man of the Year Mike Fuerbringer to the
offense this weekend.
Joining them will be swing hitter Aaron
Garcia and middle blockers Michael Hoefer
and Keenan Whitehurst. Rounding out the
starting six is sophomore Stewart Chong, who
will be called upon this season to replace four
time Ail-American Canyon Ceman as the set
ter.
"During this tournament, one of our goals
is to solidify the starting lineup," said head
coach Ruben Nieves. "Right now we have Hoe
fer and Whitehurst as middle blockers, but
since middle blocking is our deepest position,
that's also the position where there is the
most doubt in the coach's mind as to who the
two starters should be."
Competing for net time as a middle blocker
this season will be senior Brian Garrett, who

can offer experience and a solid .432 hitting
percentage up the middle.
Whitehurst, who is slated to start this
weekend, however, has come on as the front
runner for the starting job, despite his status
as a true freshman this year.
"He had a tremendous fall season and was
very consistent on the court," Nieves said.
"We knew he was good when we recruited
him, but he turned out to be even better than
we thought."
With all that firepower in Stanford's arse
nal this weekend, the other tournament teams
don't figure to stand much of a chance. The
Golden Bears of California, Stanford's tradi
tional rival, field only a club team, one which
the Cardinal has consistently upended
through the years.
"Cal has won the club champi
onship four out of the last five
years, but we've never lost to
them," Nieves said. "There is
definitely a clear difference in
the level of the two programs."
Likewise, the Division 111
Banana Slugs haven't had any
success against the Cardinal
either, and only the Tigers of
University of the Pacific can
boast of marginal gains (but not
victories) in the last few years.
"UOP might turn out to be a
dangerous team," Nieves said.
"They took us to five games last
season and they are supposed to
be an even better team this
year."
Regardless of the pre-game
speculations, this tournament
will not count toward Stanford's
regular season record because of
its unusual format. All round
robin games are best-two-out-of
three and the Championship
match is a single 15-point con
test. The NCAA only recognizes
best-three-out-of-five matches.
As a result, this weekend's tune
up is not seen as a must-win sit
uation for Stanford.
"Winning is not the most
important thing yet," Nieves
said. "We're going to try and win
the tournament, but it's more
important that no one gets hurt.
We're just trying to get the right
amount of experience because
winning will become very impor
tant on Wednesday."
Stanford will play its first offi
cial game next Wednesday
against Rutgers at Burnham
Pavilion.
One additional note on this
weekend's match-up. If the
storm picks up on Saturday and
Highway 17 to Santa Cruz is
closed, the tournament will be
moved to Stanford. The Cardinal
will then host California and
Pacific at Burnham.
