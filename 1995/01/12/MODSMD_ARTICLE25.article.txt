# Cal to challenge lady gymnasts in home opener
## 
### Ben Hur Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's gym
nastics team has been waiting
nine months for this moment.
The most highly touted
women's gymnastics team in
school history opens its season at
home Friday evening against
arch rival California at Ford Cen
ter.
The 20th-ranked Bears will
offer the No. 9 Stanford gymnasts
a chance to see just how much
they have improved since last
year's disappointing performance
at the NCAA regionals, where
they ended up with a seventh
place finish. The Cardinal fared
poorly against Cal in 1994, losing
three out of four meets to the

Bears. However, this time around
promises to be a different story.
"We will win," said coach
Breck Greenwood.
More depth, talent and rigor
ous preparation have given the
Stanford squad confidence and a
feeling that it may be on the
brink of greatness.
"We expect to dominate," said
freshman Christie Jones. "We are
really well prepared."
"We have some revenge to
give," said sophomore Katie Jen
nings. "We want to send them
home with their tails between
their legs."
Led by all-arounders Jennings,
senior co-captain Jene Elzie and
freshman Keri Monahan, this
team may have the ability to back
up their brashness. The Cardinal

appears strong on all four events,
including the vault, an event
which usually has given it trou
ble. Seniors Meegan Lannin and
Tina Snowden, along with fresh
men Amy Neil, Jones, and Misty
Moore, round out an explosive
line up.
Despite all the excitement and
anxiety that comes with the open
ing of a new season, both coach
and captain realize that starting
out too fast could produce prob
lems down the road.
"We are normally a slow
starter, and part of that is on pur
pose," Greenwood said. "We want
to save our best for the end of the
year."
"It's just the beginning of the
season, and we don't want to
peak too soon," Elzie said. "Part

of what keeps us going through
out the year is the desire to
improve."
Although the gymnasts have
been somewhat fatigued over the
past couple of weeks and are
bothered by a few nagging
injuries, they remain focused on
the task at hand.
"We never have too much
trouble getting ready for Cal,"
Greenwood said.
If all goes as planned, this will
only be the start of a season of
Cardinal domination. "There
isn't a team on our schedule that
we can't beat," Greenwood said.
The anticipation is over, and
despite all the hype, nothing has
yet been proven.
"It's time to put our words
into actions," Lannin said.
