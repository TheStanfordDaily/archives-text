## Fac Sen aims to streamline its procedures 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate's steering committee will con
vene today in its first-ever administrative session to
conduct routine business on behalf of the senate.
The administrative session — which is the result
of a senate vote in October — is aimed at streamlin
ing senate business and allowing for more discussion
time on important academic issues, said Biology
Prof. Bob Simoni, chair of the senate.

Under the new procedure, the
steering committee may choose to
meet in administrative session to
consider non-controversial items
such as reports of senate commit
tees and amended degree lists. The
seven-senator steering committee is
responsible for determining the sen
ate's agenda.
The administrative session will
replace a regular senate meeting, Si-

moni said, adding that there will probably be one
such administrative session each quarter.
The goal of the administrative sessions is "not to
waste valuable faculty time on routine items," Si
moni said.
"The idea was to free up more time for discussion
at other senate meetings," said Political Science
Prof. Stephen Krasner, a member of the steering
committee.
At today's meeting, the steering committee will
hear annual reports from several senate committees,
including the Committee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement and the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.
Simoni pointed out that the steering committee
will only receive reports that do not recommend sen
ate action. In addition, reports may only be heard
from committees which have reported at a regular
senate meeting in the previous academic year.
"We've tried to pick items that are of little contro
versy," Simoni said. "It's important business of the
senate, but it doesn't need to take up every single
senator's time."
About 15 senators have indicated that they will at
tend the administrative session, Simoni said. Al
though senators are free to attend and speak at ad
ministrative sessions, they cannot vote on any items.
However, at a regular senate meeting, five elected
