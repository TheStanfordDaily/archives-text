# The
						1995 Year in Preview
## 
### 
Nineteen ninety-four will be a difficult year to top. liven it you lived in a cave all year,
only to emerge on New Year's Eve to take a gander at the übiquitous year-in-reviews,
you now know that angst and Gen-X slackerdom (nouveau-punk, Nine Inch Nails,
Beck, Kurt Cobains suicide, post-Cobain suicide (Courtney Love / I lole); unconventionally
"simpler" mindsets ("Forrest Clump," "Nell"); and the slightly and very off-beat ("Pulp Fic
tion," Michael and Lisa Marie) were the catch-notions of the year.
But enough of this dwelling on the past — the always forward-looking Intermission staff
has dug into its sources and resources to offer these diverse bits of insight on the year ahead.
It our predictions are right, '95 won't be a revolutionary ye.ir, but rather, we'll see the new
trends of '94 evolve and gain complexity in the hands of newer musicians, filmmakers and
other artists. So fasten your seatbelts, and prepare for another turbulent ride...
HOLLYWOOD: GAY NEW YEAR
Now that "Philadelphia" grossed over $200 million worldwide, it is no wonder that pre
viously homophobic Hollywood has adopted a new slogan: "Gay Pays." Indeed at last
count, at least 60 ideas / movies were in pre-production or actual production in Tinsel
town, not to mention the steady stream of independently-made gay-subject material has
continued to emerge since the last decade.
Of course, it is Steven Spielberg's production of "To Wong Too, Thanks for Everything,
Julie Newmar" that everyone is awaiting for with bated breath. Come Summer '95, the in
triguing thought of Wesley Snipes and Patrick Swayze in full drag glory will face its test at
the box-office.
Other lavender offerings in the pipeline include Larrv Kramer's adaptation of his own
play "The Normal Heart," being developed by Barbra Streisand's production company.
The buzz is that Ralph Fiennes, so siood in "Schindk r's List" and "Quiz Show," may star.
Another theater-to-film adaptation on its way is Paul Rudnick's "Jeffrey," the huge off-
Broadway smash parody of'9os AIDS paranoia.
But why are all these gay characters played bv straight actors? While heterosexual Tom
Hanks has the luxury of doing nasty things with his Oscar statuette, gay actors continue
to suffer the confines of the celluloid closet. Is "gay" just a bankable concept of the mo
ment, or can Hollywood actually spread its fairy wings and come flying out?

EUROTRASH
For whatever reason, America's favorite music
imports have come from the British Isles, in the
form of everything from the Beatles then to your
pick of smarmy glam bands today (Elastica is this
year's model). Yet the continent might be the
place to look tor some new sounds, especially if
Dutch treat Bettie Seveert and Germany's 18th
Dye typify what's going on over on the mainland.
Many an alt-rock fan already knows about
Bettie Seveert and its atomspheric guitar crunch.
The band's 1993 debut, "Palomine," grabbed
great praise for its poignant pictures and pretty
soundscapes. In "Brain-Tag," its best song, the
ominous chorus "have I ever laid my hands on
you before?" emboldened lead singer Carol Van
Dijk's frailness, drove her quavering voice above
airy guitar licks. Her restless, edgy girlishness
pins their '90s psychedelia to the mat. The song
hits like a Mack truck.
The quartet's soon-to-be-released follow up,

"Lamprey," conjures the same feel in a more refined package. The punchier pop songs show
that tinkering makes a good product even better this time around: "Lamprey" hits with
radio-friendly power without compromising the grey tones which carroed "Palomine."
18th Dye whips up sloppy, drony sounds kinda like Yo La Tengo, only a smidgen less
tuneful. On "Done," reissued stateside last year by Matador, the two Danes and a German
move forward with gawky energy and an understated melodicism, threads of which make
their way to the surface of pounding bass and rapid guitar. And while the vocals don't real
ly affect lyrically, they work well as another instrument in the off-balance scheme of things.
Look for something new early this year.

QUENTIN TARANTINO — ACTOR
Of course Premiere-maga/ine-proclaimed "flavor of the decade" Tarantino
couldn't be content just writingand directingbrilliant blockbuster films. Everyone
wants to be a star — in front of the camera. Tarantino will take his turn as a sur
real, fate-altering character named Johnny I )estiny in Jack Baran's "Destiny Turns

on the Radio," alongside Nancy Travis as a torch singer and Dylon McDer
mott as an escaped convict. McDermott invokes the lofty description of

* ——r — — • — - / —i
"'Breathless' on acid." — if "Destiny" makes good on the promise, it
should be quite an event. Nevertheless, the precedent of Tarantino's lack-

luster extended cameo in "Pulp Fiction" — perhaps one of the only
truly weak points of the film — doesn't bode well lor the director /
screenwriter / supercelehrity / Cannes winner / media darling / genius'
budding acting career. Perhaps "actor" is just one more title too many.

CINDY CRAWFORD — ACTRESS?
No, the workout video and MTV's "I louse of Style didn't count — the super
model's acting debut is in the wings as filming for Silver Pictures' "Fair Game."
Crawford unsuccessfully auditioned lor "Singles" and"The Flintstones," but
will finally be eligible for an Academy Award (we hear the nomination com
mittee is waiting with bated breath) as a lawyer, and teamed up with William
Baldwin as a Miami cop. Apparently, Sylvester Stallone was originally supposed
to play the cop, but bailed out — no real reason given, but might one assume

Crawford's lack of acting experience or ability was a factor? Hmm, you have to

wonder when Stallone (no Lawrence Olivier himself) makes that kind ofdecision...

GENERATION X —
IT AIN'T OVER YET
1 ver since Seattle "grunge" took the alterna
tive music scene bv storm in the early '90s, pop
ular radio has become flooded with depression
andangst. From the psycho-sexual rage of Nine
Inch Nails to Green Day's tales of teenage bore
dom, popular alternative acts have perpetuated
countless X" theories and stereo
types that only grew stronger with the suicide of
Kurt Cobain in April.
But the same band that was perhaps most in
fluential in establishing rock's emotional rut
also offers the most hope in 1995. And appar
ently, fans aren't sick of Pearl Jam yet — what
magazine poll didn't feature the grungemeisters
in its top picks?
Judging from Pearl Jams delightfully multi
faceted "Vitalogy," the foret.ithers of the earl/*
nineties depression-rock movement are active
ly expanding the yen rein new ayid different di
rections — towards hope, inspiration and even
so jll e satisfying light-heartedness.
