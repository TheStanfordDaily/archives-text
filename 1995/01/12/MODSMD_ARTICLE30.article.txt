# The 						1995 Year in Preview
## 
### 
Nineteen ninety-four will be a difficult year to top. liven it you lived in a cave all year,
only to emerge on New Year's Eve to take a gander at the übiquitous year-in-reviews,
you now know that angst and Gen-X slackerdom (nouveau-punk, Nine Inch Nails,
Beck, Kurt Cobains suicide, post-Cobain suicide (Courtney Love / I lole); unconventionally
"simpler" mindsets ("Forrest Clump," "Nell"); and the slightly and very off-beat ("Pulp Fic
tion," Michael and Lisa Marie) were the catch-notions of the year.
But enough of this dwelling on the past — the always forward-looking Intermission staff
has dug into its sources and resources to offer these diverse bits of insight on the year ahead.
It our predictions are right, '95 won't be a revolutionary ye.ir, but rather, we'll see the new
trends of '94 evolve and gain complexity in the hands of newer musicians, filmmakers and
other artists. So fasten your seatbelts, and prepare for another turbulent ride...
HOLLYWOOD: GAY NEW YEAR
Now that "Philadelphia" grossed over $200 million worldwide, it is no wonder that pre
viously homophobic Hollywood has adopted a new slogan: "Gay Pays." Indeed at last
count, at least 60 ideas / movies were in pre-production or actual production in Tinsel
town, not to mention the steady stream of independently-made gay-subject material has
continued to emerge since the last decade.
Of course, it is Steven Spielberg's production of "To Wong Too, Thanks for Everything,
Julie Newmar" that everyone is awaiting for with bated breath. Come Summer '95, the in
triguing thought of Wesley Snipes and Patrick Swayze in full drag glory will face its test at
the box-office.
Other lavender offerings in the pipeline include Larrv Kramer's adaptation of his own
play "The Normal Heart," being developed by Barbra Streisand's production company.
The buzz is that Ralph Fiennes, so siood in "Schindk r's List" and "Quiz Show," may star.
Another theater-to-film adaptation on its way is Paul Rudnick's "Jeffrey," the huge off-
Broadway smash parody of'9os AIDS paranoia.
But why are all these gay characters played bv straight actors? While heterosexual Tom
Hanks has the luxury of doing nasty things with his Oscar statuette, gay actors continue
to suffer the confines of the celluloid closet. Is "gay" just a bankable concept of the mo
ment, or can Hollywood actually spread its fairy wings and come flying out?

EUROTRASH
For whatever reason, America's favorite music
imports have come from the British Isles, in the
form of everything from the Beatles then to your
pick of smarmy glam bands today (Elastica is this
year's model). Yet the continent might be the
place to look tor some new sounds, especially if
Dutch treat Bettie Seveert and Germany's 18th
Dye typify what's going on over on the mainland.
Many an alt-rock fan already knows about
Bettie Seveert and its atomspheric guitar crunch.
The band's 1993 debut, "Palomine," grabbed
great praise for its poignant pictures and pretty
soundscapes. In "Brain-Tag," its best song, the
ominous chorus "have I ever laid my hands on
you before?" emboldened lead singer Carol Van
Dijk's frailness, drove her quavering voice above
airy guitar licks. Her restless, edgy girlishness
pins their '90s psychedelia to the mat. The song
hits like a Mack truck.
The quartet's soon-to-be-released follow up,

"Lamprey," conjures the same feel in a more refined package. The punchier pop songs show
that tinkering makes a good product even better this time around: "Lamprey" hits with
radio-friendly power without compromising the grey tones which carroed "Palomine."
18th Dye whips up sloppy, drony sounds kinda like Yo La Tengo, only a smidgen less
tuneful. On "Done," reissued stateside last year by Matador, the two Danes and a German
move forward with gawky energy and an understated melodicism, threads of which make
their way to the surface of pounding bass and rapid guitar. And while the vocals don't real
ly affect lyrically, they work well as another instrument in the off-balance scheme of things.
Look for something new early this year.

QUENTIN TARANTINO — ACTOR
Of course Premiere-maga/ine-proclaimed "flavor of the decade" Tarantino
couldn't be content just writingand directingbrilliant blockbuster films. Everyone
wants to be a star — in front of the camera. Tarantino will take his turn as a sur
real, fate-altering character named Johnny I )estiny in Jack Baran's "Destiny Turns

on the Radio," alongside Nancy Travis as a torch singer and Dylon McDer
mott as an escaped convict. McDermott invokes the lofty description of

* ——r — — • — - / —i
"'Breathless' on acid." — if "Destiny" makes good on the promise, it
should be quite an event. Nevertheless, the precedent of Tarantino's lack-

luster extended cameo in "Pulp Fiction" — perhaps one of the only
truly weak points of the film — doesn't bode well lor the director /
screenwriter / supercelehrity / Cannes winner / media darling / genius'
budding acting career. Perhaps "actor" is just one more title too many.

CINDY CRAWFORD — ACTRESS?
No, the workout video and MTV's "I louse of Style didn't count — the super
model's acting debut is in the wings as filming for Silver Pictures' "Fair Game."
Crawford unsuccessfully auditioned lor "Singles" and"The Flintstones," but
will finally be eligible for an Academy Award (we hear the nomination com
mittee is waiting with bated breath) as a lawyer, and teamed up with William
Baldwin as a Miami cop. Apparently, Sylvester Stallone was originally supposed
to play the cop, but bailed out — no real reason given, but might one assume

Crawford's lack of acting experience or ability was a factor? Hmm, you have to

wonder when Stallone (no Lawrence Olivier himself) makes that kind ofdecision...

GENERATION X —
IT AIN'T OVER YET
1 ver since Seattle "grunge" took the alterna
tive music scene bv storm in the early '90s, pop
ular radio has become flooded with depression
andangst. From the psycho-sexual rage of Nine
Inch Nails to Green Day's tales of teenage bore
dom, popular alternative acts have perpetuated
countless X" theories and stereo
types that only grew stronger with the suicide of
Kurt Cobain in April.
But the same band that was perhaps most in
fluential in establishing rock's emotional rut
also offers the most hope in 1995. And appar
ently, fans aren't sick of Pearl Jam yet — what
magazine poll didn't feature the grungemeisters
in its top picks?
Judging from Pearl Jams delightfully multi
faceted "Vitalogy," the foret.ithers of the earl/*
nineties depression-rock movement are active
ly expanding the yen rein new ayid different di
rections — towards hope, inspiration and even
so jll e satisfying light-heartedness.

AUTEUR FROM HONG KONG
For film-buffs who think Hong Kong cinema is all John
Woo-style operatic violence and Jackie Chan's gongfu stunts,
think again. 1995 promises to be a year when Stanley Kwan,
a leading film artist from Hong Kong, will finally garner the
attention from critics in international circles who have long
hailed his Taiwanese and mainland Chinese brethren.
Already, selection committees from both Berlin and
Cannes have courted Kwan's latest work "Red Rose White
Rose" for competition this year. The director has already de
cided to submit the film in the Berlin Film Festival, where
Maggie Cheung won the Best Actress Silver Bear in 1992
under his direction in "Actress". The 1930s Shanghai-set
"Red Rose White Rose" is a sumptuous example of what the
openly gay, 38-year-old director does best: strong female
characterization, period detail, literate nuances and the clash
between social mores and individualism.
The story is adapted from an Eileen Chang novella about
a mans conflict between his unbridled passion for his lus
cious mistress and his dour responsibility for his mousy wife.
Joan Chen, who plays the former, already won the Golden
Horse award—Taiwan's Oscar equivalent— for Best Actress
in December. Word has it that the film being tipped for sim
ilarly big things in February's Berlin Film Festival. If so,
Warner Asia, the distributor for "Red Rose White Rose," will
try to persuade its Burbank headquarters to release the film
States-wide.

STUDENT-RUN RECORD COMPANIES
Its a typical college-campus scene: a small group of students with a love for music and
a little time on their hands get together — "Hey, let's start a rock hand. But how often does
a similar gathering of lead to "Let's start a record company," and actually culminate a year
later in the release of a first (II)? It gives a whole new spin on the term "1 )o-It-Yourself."
A group of about 20 students at the University of Miami did just that, starting 'Cane
Records without offices, money or even hands to represent. Aggressive fund-raising and a
contract with locally acclaimed I', of Miami hand Treehouse launched an effort that
caught the eye of The Miami 1 lerald and even Billboard magazine.
Given college students' urge for entrepreneurial enterprise the idea will catch on. If it
gains enough momentum, the benefits will be twofold: a whole new brand of independent
record labels will be born, and college bands may not have to wait until post graduation to
pursue that recording contract of their dreams.

PAVEMENT, OTHER INDIES
When Pavement's classic "Slanted and Enchant
ed was released in 1992, there were clear signs that de
spite the band's defiantly "indie" attitude, their appeal
would inevitably extend well into mainstream audi
ences. With last year's similarly impressive follow-up,
"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain," the band's fan base
continued to grow, with increasing MTV and pop
radio airtime and even an appearance on lay Leno's
"Tonight Show." In mid-1995, the hand expects to re
lease another album, and this could be the event that
brings their loose, "underground" character right into
the thick of the mainstream. Alongside Pavement,
other longtime independent favorites like Superchunk,
Sebadoh and Guided By Voices could be unintention
ally making "indie" the trendicst tag since "grunge."

THROWING MUSES
Throwing Muses can't
get no attention: it's
telling that the group's lat
est single, "Bright Yellow
Gun," debuted here on
Live 105's New Music
Challenge, seemingly an
other anonymous tune by
another gone tomorrow,
gone today wonder.
Indeed, the TM's bril
liant body ol work has
been widely ignored by a
popular audience, made
all the more obscure by
former second fiddle

frontwoman Kristin

R.E.M. TOUR
Following a year in
which the hottest con
certs were by bands 20
years past their primes,
there are virtually no
more significant classic
rock bands left to do re
union tours. Instead, the
biggest concert event of
1995 promises to be
R.E.M.'s long-awaited
world tour. Since the 1988
"Green" tour the band
has reinvented themselves
in the studio with each
new release.
In the current "Mon
ster" incarnation, R.E.M.
is a somewhat hard-rock
ing band with a bald
Michael Stipe, a guitarist
with huge sideburns and
a bass player with some
snappy new suits. Tickets
should be hard to get, but
well worth the effort.

ROLLERSKATE SKINNY
Bridging the innovative pop of the 800 Radleys with the 10-fi
drive of the (irifters, Rollerskate Skinny's "Shoulder Voices" —
released in early 1994 — is a much-overlooked classic, quietly
boasting some of the most interesting and ambitious rock to hit
the music scene in some time.
1 ast year the band gained modest exposure, touring with
Pavement and performing on Lollapaloo/a's second stage. In
1995, they seem poised for a major breakthrough, having recent
ly signed with a major label (Sire) and scheduled to release a new
album soon. And it the new release tan match "Shoulder Voices"
in raw elegance or emotional intensity, Rollerskate Skinny
shouldn't he underground for very long.
— Mike Norcn

BUSKER ALLEY
Oh those dancing feet!
I he man with the most famous dancing feet is coming
to San I rancisco stage in a brand-new production. Nine
time Tony Award-winner Tommy Tune turns the Golden
(iate Theatre into "Busker Alley" this April.
Tune, one-time star of "Bye-Bye Birdie" and choreog
rapher of "Grand Hotel," stars in this new musical love
story featuring the colorful world of London street enter
tainers at the beginning of World War 11.
Powered by director and choreographer Jeff Calhoun
(also directing this month's "Grease") and scored by the
team of Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman
i Mary I'oppins ), Busker hits the West Coast on its way
to a Broadway engagement.
And tickets are cheaper when you don't have to factor
in airfare to New York.

SEXUAL MUSIC
Sex pervades almost every con ner niche, so it isn't surprising to find sex
ually oriented recordings popping jpi The records of this new quasi-genre aren't
about people singing about sex tead they supposedly promote, induce and
facilitate sex.
Two years ago, Palo Alto's CD id carried "Private Erotica." Sounding like •
Candid Camera having a field day America's bedrooms, this CD pandered to
voyeurs with track titles like "Stew and Cynthia" and a Richard." At the same time,
Tower Records promoted "Cyborgs srrtf a virtual experience that boasted a bonus
techno mix of heavy breathing, sed trve coos and orgasmic screams.
Recently, Tower put out anothe ind of sex CD, called "Erotiques: Music for ,
Erotic Inta ludesT This one playec ke the background music of some kitschy
porn flick, with its cheesy saxophoi and bumpy jazz.
Whether they're tacky and tastek scams, or great novelty gifts, sex records are
coming out-—more portable than >om tape, more compact than an inflatable
doll.
— Dardy Chang

MUSIC ON THE INTERNET
I he pop-music industry has already built its on-ramps onto the Information Superhighway, eagerly anticipating a
potentially monumental marketing medium. With CD-ROM, multimedia, increased memory in PCs and other well
touted computing innovations, the possibilities are endless. Already existing "virtual reality computer adventures
anil newly released interactive CD-ROM movies suggest a whole new direction for MTV (or should we saw MPC?).
I he first big name on the Internet, Aerosmith, released one of the first on-line singles earlier this year. At the same
time, enterprising students at UC-Santa Crux launched a new network fur promoting unknown bands. While the
major media hyped the threat (if potential bootlegging and illegal copying that would put record companies out of
Ihi si ness, t hose in the computer networking industry say th.it s a long time coming. As it is, even higher- memory com
puters need hours to download mere minutes of CD-quality music. So as usual, technology hasn't quite caught up
with our aspirations, and as of now, electronic bulletin boards and other information-exchange networks iibout the
recording industry are the most user-friendly link between music and the Internet.

SUNNY DAY REAL ESTATE
Now that we're just over the lip
of 1995, do we honestly need a
band like Sunny Day Real Estate?
An all-you-can-eat smorgasboard
of tastyalternatavia. A dash of Pearl
Jam. A scoop of Nirvana. Two help
ings of Smashing Pumpkins.
I )on't get me wrong. Sunny Day
Real Estate is the best tiling I've
heard in a while. Really. But some
thing bothers me. Alternative rock
has been at a full gallop long
enough now that even these instant
masters of the genre seem to be rid
ing a tired horse. Otherwise, as evi
denced on their debut album,
"Diary" is skin-tingly good.,
they're doing everything right. In
telligent, unembarrasing lyrics.
Powerful guitars that crush, punch,
and break things apart just when
you think they should. And they
take themselves seriously. An exhil
arating lack of Green Day-esque
self-abasement.
So is it a problem that they're not
doing anything new? Guess not.
lust hard to believe that something
so derivative could be so good.
— Taylor Antrim

MOVIE SOUNDTRACKS
Movie soundtracks used to be a hodge-podge of random songs that
had little to do with the movies themselves. If 1994 was any indication,
the movie soundtrack is evolving into a work of art, a musical painting
of the film it scores.
One obvious example is "Forrest Gump,"which spans four decades
in an almost-patriotic retrospective of American music. "Pulp Fic
tion" 's '7()'s R&B and twangy rock, as well as "Priscilla, Queen of the
Desert" 's disco anthems and jazz numbers recreate the movies' ram
bunctious and campy feels. And then there's Trent Reznor's schizoid fu
sion of 27 sound fragments for "Natural Born Killers," a headtrip as
equally potent as Oliver Stone's film.
Look for future soundtracks like these, thematic compilations that
purposefully and masterfully capture the movies' images.
— Dardy Cluing

SUZAN LORI-PARKS
W'lio but one of the most original voices in
American theater today would have the inge
nuity to write "Devotees in the (iarden of
I.ove,' the courage and capacity to envision
"The Death of the 1 .ist Black Man in Whole
hntire World,' or the sheer audacity to con
ceive of "The America Play," a historical
satire with a black Abe 1 incoln at its center?
The one-woman powerhouse behind this
madness is 30-vear old playwright Su/an
l.ori Parks.
With seven plays under her belt, several
enjoying national and international produc
tions, a script about the Venus Hottentot in
the works, and a commission to write "(iirl
6," a screenplay for none other than Spike Lee
(which should be completed in lune, with
production following), Parks is on the verge
of becoming one of America s youngest lead
ing talents currently working in the dramatic
medium.
While her strange, linguistically fascinat
ing and larger-than-life style might con
found many an audience, a production of a
Parks play never fails to engage all of the
senses.
A Yale School of I )rama graduate and for
mer Obie Award winner, Parks is an artist in
motion. Don't be surprised if her metaphor
ical language and imagery seeps into main
stream pop culture.
Look, listen, and contemplate. Over and
over again.
— Aiiia Croat

HELIUM
Helium's 1944 debut, "Pirate Prude," stands as the most
supremely powerful alt-rock recording of the past year, a com
pelling piece ot work which inevitably draws its audience to put as
much into a listen as the band has into the music. Mary l imony's
aching vocals haunt with their dispirited tone and subject matter.
"Pat's Trick," a 7" single released late last year, is a tasty teaser of
what's to come on Helium's furthcoming LP, due out this March.
It's a choppy little pop dilty, with an off-kilter crunch of guitar and
Timony's speak/sing voice, delivering cleverly simple yet oh-so
catchy lyrics in almost a dead pan. The song, like the band, insis
tently nudges in its own brilliantly warped way.
— Arnold Pan

VELO-DELUXE
Athens, (Georgia in Bloomington, Indiana? Sure sounds that way. Velo-Deluxe's debut album,
"Superelastic" has got all the markings of a bit; deal in alterna-pop. Just as Georgia-born fab four
immortalized Athens, Velo-Deluxe seems to have a crack at making Bloomington kind of cool.
I ormallv of the Blake Babies and Antenna, frontman John Strohm commandeers a vaired, in
teresting sound. lake Teenage Fanclub minus those annoying accents, piss them off, make them
a little better and then you've got Velo-Deluxe. Melodic perfection chewed up, swallowed and re
gurgitated: a little acidic, a little mushy, a little runny. But basically still there. Since I am forever
wary of bands who write a song with their name in the title, "Velo Deluxe" foretold Big Country
esque mediocrity. Sheer power pop perfection, however, was all to be had.
Only one disappointment. That Velo-Deluxe'V'Desiree" is not a reworking of Neil Diamond's
1977 masterwork of the same title. I guess Bloomington's not that cool after all.
— Taylor Antrim

DAVID GRAY
The void in folk-pop-rock music left by
Tracy Chapman's long silence could very well
be filled by this up-and-comer who was largely
overlooked by Shawn ( olvin fans when he
opened for her tour, which swung into Stanford.

On the surface, the very British, white and male
Gray seems to have few similarities to the very
American, black and female Chapman. But no
one else since (Chapman has been able to approxi-

mate her unique brand of pained, wry, yet emotional
reflection as well as (iray. As many of us reach satura

tion point with overly self-indulgent, self-pitying

grunge / neo-punkstcrs, Gray's understated

style, particularly in his latest album "Flesh,"
may find its niche in the music world.

HECUBA
Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue...
While May is a good month for weddings, this old adage applies just as well to the Amer
ican Conservatory Theaters rendition of "Hecuba" which will play at the Center for the
Arts Theater in the Yerba Buena Gardens April 27 through June 4.
"Old" refers to the play itself, written umpteen zillion years ago by Euripides in Greece:
in a tale of politics and betrayal, Queen Hecuba, enslaved during the Trojan War, fights for
survival and revenge.
"New" refers to the translation and adaptation done by Timberlake Wertenbaker and the
direction by ACT artistic director Carey Perloff (who also directed the company's produc
tion of "Home").
"Borrowed" is Olympia Dukakis, winner of the Academy Award for her role in "Moon
struck" and not a regular ACT player. Dukakis comes west to play the queen.
And "blue" is any theater buff who misses the experience.

EUROPEAN ART CINEMA: WHERE ART THOU?
If 1994 was the year alarms went off about the decline of the continental art-film, 1995 ap
pears headed for a road to certain extinction. Ever since Polish maestro Krzysztof Kieslowski
("Blue," "White," "Red") announced his retirement at Cannes last year, European cinephiles
have been scratching their heads for a possible successor. Sadly, the inevitable conclusion is
clear: there is none.
Yes, the continent that spawned Renoir, Eellini, Truffaut, Fassbinder and Wenders is now re
plete with disappointments from established masters (Wenders' "Far Away, So Close") and rel
atively recently-emerged mavericks (Greenaway's "Baby of Macon") alike.
Indeed, under siege from the "Jurassic Park "sand "Lion King"s, Europeans have resorted to
the "if you can't beat them, join them" mentality that produced unexpectedly low-brow enter
tainment that they once turned up their nose at. The French "Les Visiteurs" and the German
" I he Turbulent Man" both made stellar fortunes in their home countries, and both have aspi
rations to be translated into Hollywood hits.
1 he latter's director, Soenke Wortmann, accused his (ierman predecessors of being uninter
ested in appealing to audiences and trumpets the need for mainstream popularity. Who would
have guessed that soon it may be impossible to tell a European film from a Hollywood flick?

FLAMING LIPS
Oozing all the same feel-good creativity of Blind Melon's "No
Rain" except with a more random twist, the Flaming Lips' "She Don't
Use Jolly" — from the band's 1993 release "Transmissions From the
Satellite Heart" — has just recently become a popular radio mainstay
and an M TV "Buzz Clip," capturing the attention and imagination
(it fans across the country. While new to the mainstream music
scene, the 1 laming I ips have been churning out such spunky pop
gems lor nearly a decade now, breaking new ground with each suc
cessive release.
The l.ips' well-proven knack for high-spirited pop adventures
makes it unlikely that they will fade from the spotlight as another
bunch ot Proclaimer-esque one-hit wonders. Instead, their seeming
ly limitless creative drive makes them top prospects to join Cireen
Day and Weezer as teenage fun-pop favorites — a development sure
to disgust many long-time Flaming Lips followers, but sure to delight
countless new listeners.

MELTING HOPEFULS
This pot-luck Garden State en
semble makes the kind of tunes which
smack of too many hours in the base
ment with a guitar and not much else
to do. On the band's 1994 debut,
"Space Flyer," the straightahead guitar
work and husky vocals of singer Renee
Loßue paint a vividly overcast atmos
phere, one of "doing nothing," of
"hairballs and last week's news."
Still, the sense that none of it's
really as boring as it seems shines
through the clouds only because
they're making the choice to slack. If
there's a message in "Space Flyer," it's
that, even though "today made [you|
pooped there's always tomorrow to
blow off."
Of course, pop losers with four
tracks also have stacks of records and
that's clearly heard in the band's offer
ings: the Hopefuls cite some of alt
rock's Finest sources, from the smoky,
Kristin Hersh hues in Loßue's voice to
the twangy wash of Madder Rose gui
tars to the fuzzy Sonic Youth Finish.
But this band only quotes "yr" heroes,
getting across its own point rather
than paraphrasing an old book. Per
haps Loßue puts the band's method
best when she muses, "I'd be out,
scummy — but me."

BEWARE OF BALD BLACK DIVAS
They sing about revolution, spirituality, boyfriends, girlfriends, hot
combs and that's just the beginning. They employ everything from jazz to
classical music to do their bidding. For record labels, these women present
a promotional nightmare.
I 'm talking about BBD — Bald Black Divas.
Me' Shell NdegeOcello, Dionne Farris and Joi count among the lumi
naries of this emerging musical phenomenon. Me' Shell bursted onto the
scene last year with her debut album "Plantation I ullabies." She has
toured the country, performing with such greats as Prince and John
Cougar Mellencamp in a cover of "Wild Night" that has since earned her
a Grammy Nomination. All the while she has managed to keep audiences
tripping off her solo material, crooning seductive love songs to women on
one hand while declaring that "II That's Your Boyfriend He Wasn't Last
Night."
A little I ess high-profile is Dionne Farris, the incredible voice behind
Arrested Development s hit songs lennessee, and "People Everyday." In
a risky move, Farris left the group to show and prove on her own album,
"Wild Seed Wild flower. Here we see her talent as a singer, songwriter and
musician bloom as she moves effortlessly between rock, R&B and gospel
styles.
Wonderfully varied, Joi's debut album, "Sunshine & The Rain," push
es tonal barriers. In one song, she sings about freedom while distorting
her voice through a guitar amp. Another is a classical song sung com
pletely in I atin. 1 ler erotic lyrics and fierce beats are just enough to send a
girl over the edge.
All three of these women have carved out an original space of rare tal
ent for their art to inhabit. That's just how they do it.
