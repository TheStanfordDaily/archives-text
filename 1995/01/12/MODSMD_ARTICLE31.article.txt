V V Anna Deavere Smith is the type of
professor who demands her students' com
plete attention. And with her success as a
playwright and actress, most recently in last
year's one-woman show "Twilight: Los Ange
les, 1992," it's hard to deny that she deserves
that attention from her students and audi
ences alike.
Smith has been a Stanford drama profes
sor for four years, and she returns to campus
this spring to teach advanced acting and stage
writing courses. She says that while develop
ing and performing "Twilight" has taken up a
great deal of that time, beginning in LA. dur
ing the riots of August 1992 and taking her
not only to Broadway but as far away as Aus
tralia, teaching has always been an important
part of what she does.
"Students are in a way shockingly honest,"
she says of her Stanford experience, "and
they're particularly honest about things they
feel they don't do we 11.... What I try to do is
expand the territory that they think they can
investigate and create things about."
>1 y xpanding that territory is important
■' I— to Smith in part because of her com
/ - 112 mitment to bringing voices that have
not been heard before onto the stage. In
"Twilight" and "Fires in the Mirror," Smith's
1992 play about race riots in Crown Heights,
Brooklyn, she performs verbatim excerpts
from interviews with a variety of people af
fected by the events. Examples among the 50
or so sketches in "Twilight" include beating
victim Reginald Denny, an anonymous USC
student and Twilight Bey, a gang member
who helped organize the Crips-Bloods truce

that followed the riots.
"When I interview people for my play,"
she says,"I have a single goal — to get from
them a fresh and new narrative about an
event that has just happened, and preferably
something they haven't thought a lot about. I
don't want them to understand. It's me trying
to be in the presence of somebody trying to
figure out what just happened in their com
munity. That's my goal because that's where I
think character lives — in that action of
putting it together."
ince 1983, when she began the series
of plays called "On the Road: A Search
for American Character," Smith has
been engaging in this effort. The results,
which have been recognized with two Tony
nominations for "Twilight," would not have
been possible without her work as a teacher,
Smith says.
"The form itself has been accepted," she
says, "That came out of work that I did in the
classroom when I was younger which was
controversial, and which was not that well
received either by colleagues or by students."
In November, Smith received a six
month, $1 ()(),()()() residency at Arena Stage in
Washington, I). C., to complete the next in
stallment in the series, this time dealing with
the relationship between the President and
the press.
The residency will be spread out until
1997, giving Smith time to complete other
projects, such as conducting a series of pub
lic interviews in New York City and writing a
film on the justice system to be distributed
by Columbia Pictures.
This work will continue the search for
character that Smith says is nowhere near

complete. "I'm a drop in the bucket," she ac
knowledges.
One of the problems that Smith would
like to help address is expanding the
audience of regional theater. Theater
"could be a more vital part of the develop
ment of an American imagination," she says.
Attracting a diverse audience is an impor
tant part of that expansion, Smith says. The
performative aspects of race and gender are "a
twentieth-century wooden behavior," similar
to non-psychological models of individual
identity that limited earlier theatrical efforts.
"I'm trying to get that to melt down a lit
tle bit so we can see beyond the boundaries
of race and gender, and we can find some
thing else to attract us to one another, rather
than to find the end of a person at the level of
their height or weight or skin color or what
ever.
"We have to develop an audience that calls
that out," she says. "Americans are now —
every day — a more diverse population, so
that's really the only way to get at the spirit of
the country."
With that goal, Smith says she is excited
about the possibility of working in different
media and reaching a broader audience. She
tells the story of being in an elevator on her
way to the O. J. Simpson trial when someone
complemented her as a wonderful actress. A
woman who was serving as a juror on anoth
er trial then turned to her and asked what
station she was on.
ut the dominance of TV does not nec
i essarily mean there is no room for
theater, Smith says. "There are a
number of ways we can experience one an

other," she says.
She sees the much-lamented production
of the musical "Beauty and the Beast" on
Broadway as a challenge to more traditional
theater interests. "In the end, we have to ap
plaud Disney for figuring out how to market
the thing," she says."In theater, we have a
long way to go to figure that out, and we
don't have as much money. So we have to
find new collaborations."
Smith plans to encourage her students to
think along those same lines. "I'm trying to
construct a way that my students can think
about, 'What community am I in at Stan
ford?' ... and ask them to expand that —
who (they| think (they] will be acting for."
ut Smith acknowledges that stage
I writing is individual, and she recog
nizes her students may have different
desires. "As teachers, our ears have to be big
ger than their voices," she says. "No matter
how loud it is, no matter how wrong it might
sound to our ears, we have to adjust our
hearing aides and not adjust their volume."
And for all the success that she has
achieved, Smith remains extremely commit
ted to continuing her role as a mouthpiece
for others on the stage.
"There is hatred, there is racism," she says.
"But I'm like a fool or a clown, so I aim to
please authority, not to defeat it. There's a
way in which I'm probably psychologically
working to be pleasing in an odd way.
"I don't want to make it sound like I'm
sucking up, because it's not the same thing at
all. The clown knows that he's foolish, the
clown knows that he cannot win. So I'm in
that place of effort, rather than full-out bat
tle." ■
