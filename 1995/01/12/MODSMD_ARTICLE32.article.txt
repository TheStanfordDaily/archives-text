## Excellence of ‘To Live' surpasses 'Concubine,' 'Kite' 
### 
Between 1993 and 1994 the most cele
brated trio of the Fifth-Generation Chinese
filmmakers — Chen Kaige, Tian
Zhuangzhuang and Zhang Yimou — each
made his own statement on the People's Re
public's tumultuous revolutionary history.

To Live 44 4 4

Inevitably, "Farewell My Concubine,"
"The Blue Kite" and "To Live" are all pri
marily set in the period spanning the com
munist liberation in 1949 and the Cultural
Revolution of the sixties, a time when any
one remotely "intellectual" was publicly
derided and sent to labor camps.
Unfortunately, as the last of the three to
be completed, Zhang's masterpiece has
met with resistance from jaded critics sim
ply because it can conveniently be brushed
off as yet another one of those PRC] politi
cal tragedies. In truth, although "To Live"
well surpasses its two predecessors in its af
fecting sense of personal intimacy, the
breadth of its ideological scope is never in
doubt.
Adapted from Yu Hua's original novel
"Lifetimes," the film documents the trials
and tribulations faced by a family of four,
a wealthy household in pre-liberation
China, until the father, Fugui (Ge You),
loses their ancestral property on the gam
bling table and is then reduced to pup
peteering to support his wife and chil
dren.
On the eve of Chairman Mao's
takeover, the elder daughter falls so sick
that she becomes deaf; the fatigued
younger son is killed by a bureaucrat's car
during the nation-wide "Great Leap For

ward" campaign of 1958, when steel pro
duction is awarded priority over the citi
zens' stomachs and health. Finally, Fugui
and lia/hen (Cong Li) could not be spared
from further grief by the Cultural Revolu
tion.
It is thus not hard to see why Zhang's
audacity in linking personal tragedy so ex
plicitly to political misadventures has
drawn ire from Chinese authorities: "To
Live" was banned locally after winning
prizes at Cannes last year and Zhang was
barred from undertaking foreign-backed
co-productions.
In several ways, Zhang's work has
achieved a new level of maturity in "To
Live." If "The Story of Qiu !u" marked the
director's shift from the formal symbolism
of his earlier pieces to a more naturalistic
cinematic mode, "To Live" ventures even
farther to incorporate melodramatic and
comic elements in Zhang's ever-broaden
ing celluloid frame.
Not since "Red Sorghum" has Zhang's
male protagonist been sculpted with as
much flesh and bone as Fugui, whose
transformation from arrogant bourgeoisie
to survivalist comrade is memorably enact
ed by Ge You. While Gong Li has wooed the
world over for some time, Ge's Best Actor
award at Cannes is a belated recognition for
the talent among male Chinese actors.
One of "To Live" 's Cultural Revolution
scenes may have predicted the film's unfor
tunate fate in the PRC: having deemed art
as bourgeois decadence, officials order
Fugui to burn his intricately-crafted
leather puppets. Likewise, for practition
ers of cutting-edge Chinese cinema, "To
Live" is no less than a proud proclamation
of defiance against the artistic persecution
by an incorrigible regime.
