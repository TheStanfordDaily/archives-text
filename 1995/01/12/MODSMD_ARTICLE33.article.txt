# Formulas good for math, not film 'IQ' predictable from begining to end
## 
### 
As old-fashioned as the '40s comedies it
tries to emulate, "IQ" is a standard, by-the
hook romantic comedy. There is no freshness
or originality — it goes through the motions
like an equation being solved by a mathe
matician. There are no surprises or devia
tions, with an inevitable standard finale
wrapping things up.

Light, harmless and sweet, it tries to be as
timeless as an old Hepburn and Cooper clas
sic, but it suffers from a severe lack of star
power. Tim Robbins ("The Player"), you're
no Gary Cooper. Meg Ryan ("When Harry
Met Sally"), you're no Katherine Hepburn.
Robbins plays a lovesick mechanic who,
abetted by the brilliant mind of Albert Kin
stein (Walter Matthau), pretends to be a ge
nius physicist.
All this so he can lasso the heart of Ein
stein's niece (Ryan), a slightly odd, uptight
scholar who wants to marry a man with high
intelligence. Ryan does the Ryan thing: perky,
cute, and adorable. Ryan is not an actress,
she's a Cabbage Patch Doll come to life. She
smiles and siizhs a lot, trvinii to hide the fact

that she has no personality.
Robbins is perfect for Ryan, since he too
has no personality. His face is a blank, a big
drawing board sometimes spelling out confu
sion, sometimes childish pleasure. Like Ryan,
he suffers from severe cuteness disorder.
His weakness is most obvious when his
character does an impression of Marlon
Brando. Brando, passionate and intense, was
from the Method school of acting. Robbins,
nice and cuddly, is from the Teddy Bear
school of acting.
For a movie set in the intellectual world,
"IQ" has surprisingly little to say about acad
emia. However, that doesn't mean "IQ" can't
be a learning experience.
You learn three things from watching

"IQ": Einstein needed to
have a very nasty sense of
humor to set up his niece
with a boring mechanic;
cliches never die, they
just get transported to
different settings in a
new package; and finally,
Princeton has a very cute
campus — so cute, in
fact, that it's perfect for a
movie like this.
