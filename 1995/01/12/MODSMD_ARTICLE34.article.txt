# Style over substance
## 'Disclosure' struggles with sexual stereotypes and lack of plot, dialogue 
### 
Based on Michael Crichton's novel, Barry
Levinson's "Disclosure" brings us a tale of
sexual harassment with a twist. "Sexual ha
rassment is about power" — and in this film,
the traditional male hierarchy is overthrown.
This time the woman is on top.
While the film aspires to be original, it falls
short of being great entertainment. The adap-

Disclosure

tation from Crichton's novel foregoes his flair
for detail for a basic, uninspiring plot. The
characters are stereotypical and flat.
Demi Moore plays Meredith Johnson, the
new vice-president and boss-woman, who
sets out to seduce Tom Sanders (Michael
Douglas). In a steamy scene in her office,
Johnson attacks Sanders, who struggles
against her sexual advances. He escapes with
his virtue intact, and then retaliates with legal
charges. The plot takes various twists and
turns, and it becomes difficult to tell who is
setting up whom.
Douglas seems to be right at home with his

role as the victim of sexual harassment, adding
"Disclosure" to his already considerable list of
films in which he plays the persecuted man
("Falling Down", "Fatal Attraction"). Over
shadowed by Moore, his performance is mere
ly adequate, lacking luster and dramatic power.
Moore fits the hard-as-nails, tough-as-beef
jerky, chic-bitch image to the T. She is sexy,
sassy and bull-dog mean. She's got the "wom
anly wiles" down to a science, playing the se
ductress and the innocent with equal ease.
However, to the film's credit, all of the
women do not fit the viperous, double-deal
ing mold of Johnson. Sander's lawyer Cather
ine Alvarez is a formidable woman, yet unlike
Johnson, she is brutally honest and straight
forward. Sander's wife Susan is another
strong but likable female character. She epit
omizes the modern working woman, manag
ing her own legal career, stalwartly support
ing her husband, and tenderly mothering
their two children.
Overall, "Disclosure" falls into the
mediocre category. Even Moore's strong act
ing suffers from the lack of a well-written
script and interesting dialogue. The plot of

intrigue is predictable and
flickers in intensity.
"Disclosure"'s combina
tion of sex, scandal, power
and money seems a sure
promise of excitement and
suspense, but unfortu
nately the film fails to de
liver.
