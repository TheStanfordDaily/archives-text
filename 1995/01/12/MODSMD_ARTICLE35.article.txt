# Diverse 'Pulp Fiction' soundtrack evocative, worthy of the movie
## 
### 
As with any movie soundtrack, the musi
cal accompaniment to Quentin Tarantino'
"Pulp Fiction" loses some of its appeal in th<
transition from the silver screen to the silve:
disc. However, the selection from "Pulp Fic
tion" is unique — its interesting mix of truh
funky songs captures the movie's unpre
dictability while retaining the power to at
tract listeners even when removed from it:
original visual context.

ture, the soundtrack enhances fond memo
ries and encourages appreciation of music
from the score that might have been over
looked. Even one deprived of the thrill of ac
tually viewing the movie might en joy the CD,
since the diverse mix of songs by different
artists achieves more variety than the average

multi-artist collection,
let alone an album by a
single artist.
On the other
hand, the bits of dia
logue from the movie
incorporated among
the songs — a recent
trend in soundtracks,
particularly linked
with Tarantino flicks
— are likely to puzzle
the unenlightened lis
tener. The shuffled

samples often suggest a less-than-logical
course of events.
About half the songs on the CD are music
only. Unless one is an unconditional fan of
groovy but random instrumentals, these se
lections especially are far more enjoyable if
one can associate the music with the memo
ry of a particular scene. However, when lis
tening to Ihe Tornadoes' "Rustin' Surf
boards," reminiscent of the Beach Boys back
ground tunes, you can literally hear the
breaking waves and feel the sun-warmed
sand.
You Never Can Tell," by Chuck Berry, is
preceded by a brief scene from the movie —
I he Jack Rabbit Slims Twist Contest. This
song, with the flavor of another era, in
evitably evokes the recollection of the on
screen acting. It is as if John Travolta is right
there in the room, on his toes, knees and hips
oscillating in opposite directions.
Songs such as "tiirl You'll Be a Woman
Soon" and "Flowers on the Wall," both make
for good listening, but clearly standing above
the rest is "Son of a Preacher Man," executed
in lounge-singer style by Dusty Springfield.
I his huskily sung melody draws one in like a
breath of southern hospitality, simultane
ously providing excellent lip-synching mate
rial for the performer in all of us. This song is
followed by the motion picture's "Zed's Dead
Baby" scene, a favorite among movie-goers.
While the soundtrack alone supplies great
background noise for dancing, studying or
just staring into space, its most serious flaw is
that people who have not seen the movie are
understandably unlikely to fully appreciate
it. The simple solution? See it.
