## Carrying a big stick 
### 
Say all actions could be broken down
into two basic strategies — that of the car
rot and the stick. With only such crude lan
guage at our disposal, one would have to
say that as an artistic style, Madonna has al
ways favored the stick. A big stick.
"Bedtime Stories," her latest pop album

"Bedtime Stories"
Madonna

contribution, is an entirely different story,
112 rom bittersweet ballads over hazy hip-hop
backbeats to almost-house music, Madon
na allows an organically beautiful narrative
to flow from simple yet powerful lyrics.
This album, though best savored as a
nocturnal listen, will definitely not put you
to sleep. Nibble on the first two songs,
"Survival" and chart-hopping "Secret" and
you're already hungry for more.
The only time the CD falters is during
the next three-song streak. They are not
necessarily bad songs, but they sound so
alike that they damn near put you out.
Struggle against this sensation; the battle is
well worth aural strain. Even during this
relatively boring run, Me' Shell NdegeOcel
lo comes in on vocals and bass in "I'd
Rather Be Your Lover," to convert a poten

tially cheesy pop tune
into a sensually gratifying experience.
Madonna raises the stakes in "Human
Nature" where, between a funky sample of
"What You Need" performed by Main
Source and a seductive whisper urging you
to "express yourself don't repress yourself,"
Madonna sings her defiant anthem.
"And I'm not sorry/ it's human nature/
I'm not sorry/ I'm not your bitch don't
hang your shit on me."
I he song is all Madonna offers by way of
apology or explanation for the provocative,
sometimes abrasive, and most often outra
geous stunts she's pulled during her infa
mous career. "Did I say something wrong?/
Oops, I didn't know 1 couldn't talk about
sex (I musta been crazy)."
What distinguishes this CD from others
is its quiet confidence. Madonna's voice,
this time more velvet than viscose, and the
simple conviction of her lyrics collaborate
with high-profile producers like Babyface
and Dallas Austin in a finely honed musical
production. No gimmicks, no sex-induced
frenzy. Instead of hitting you like a Mack
truck, Madonna allows her intangible yet
ever-present sensuality to envelop the lis
tener like an elusive cloak.
While she still shamelessly borrows
from hip-hop and R&B contemporaries,
this time Madonna manages to put togeth
er a tight album without ever sounding de
rivative. "Bedtime Stories" is easily her
best.
