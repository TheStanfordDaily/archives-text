# Dionne Warwick's 'Aquarela do Brasil' a poor rendition of the original
## 
### 
When Dionne Warwick was asking "Do
you Know the Way to San Jose?" Tom Jobim
was asking if you knew the "Girl from Ipane
ma." When Warwick was ruling the airwaves
in the '60s, the bossa nova was rocking in
Brazil. In Warwick's new album, their paths
have crossed.

"Aquarela do Brazil"
Dionne Warwick
* *

Featuring the work of some of the greatest
names in contemporary Brazilian music,
"Aquarela do Brasil" is titled after the famous
Ary Barroso song. (Remember that song that
kept haunting the hero in Terry Gilliam's cult
favorite "Brazil"?)
Warwick sings that and other Brazilian
standards in English. She even tries a few bars
in Portuguese, and you chuckle at her effort.
Warwick is way out of her league here. No
matter how good her intentions are, having
Warwick sing these Brazilian songs is kinda
like having Zsa Zsa Gabor sing George
Gershwin classics.
The variety of Brazilian composers and
musicians represented in this album is deliri
ous. Almost all Brazilian stars of the MPB
(Musica Popular Brasilcira) had something

to do with the album. Tom Jobim, who died
last month, wrote six of the songs, Chico
Buarque wrote two, and even Dori Caymmi
and Djavan wrote one each.
The songs are a perfect introduction to
Brazilian music, with its simple, poetic lyrics,
and the uncomparable beat of percussion in
struments.

Warwick calls this album a "labor of love."
Her interest seems honest, but doesn't justify
the damage she does to the songs. The inade
quacy of her voice to Brazilian music is most
obvious in her duet with Brazilian singer
Eliana Estevao called "Heart of Brazil." Este
vao's voice simply shines through the lyrics,
whereas Warwick sounds desperate for

something more saccharine and mellow as
she struggles through the song. After years of
performing almost exclusively love ballads,
Warwick seems to have forgotten how to sing
music that is not about love or friendships.
The only time Warwick really connects
with the Brazilian sounds is in "Piano na
Mangueira," a duet with Buarque. There is a
liberating quality to her voice, as if she were
thanking heavens that she's not stuck with
yet another dumb Burt Bacharach ballad.
But in the next song, she returns to
Bacharach, her collaborator since the '60s.
Bacharach's "Captives of the Heart," the only
song in the album with no Brazilian influ
ence, is so artificial and formulaic that it only
helps highlight how free and exciting Brazil
ian music is by comparison.
A mixed bag of goods, "Aquarela do
Brasil" contains remarkable songs written by
Brazilian poets / lyricists / musicians. On the
other hand, there's no getting past the fact
that it's Warwick singing them. That makes
"Aquarela" a wonderful introduction to
Brazilian music to those who've had no pre
vious exposure of it and need an American
like Warwick to make the introductions.
But if you're a habitual listener, you
should just pass on it and wait for the next
album of the late Tom Jobim, which is al
ready out in Brazil but hasn't arrived in
American stores yet.
