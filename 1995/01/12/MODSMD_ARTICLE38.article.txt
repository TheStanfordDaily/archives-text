# Flicks — The Winter Quarter Lineup
## 
### 
From the cult ("Blade Runner") to the
classic ("Casablanca"), the blockbuster
("Forrest Gump") to the eclectic ("The Ad
ventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"),
and the historical ("Quiz Show") to the ani
mated ("The Lion King"), this quarter's
schedule has the variety to tempt even the
most choosy of movie-goers. Remember,
show times are at 7 and 10 p.m., and quarter
passes can be purchased from the Discon
nection, the Cardinal Connection or at
Flicks, located weekly at Memorial Audito
rium. And, for a real thrill, check out Flicks'

Monday, Jan. 16 — Clear and Present Dan
ger
Harrison Ford stars in the latest adaptation of
a Tom Clancy best-seller plagued with bad
screenwriting and worse camera work. Ford,
though, does a capable job and James Earl
Jones is, as always, fun to listen to as the dying
CIA Director. While "Clear and Present" is
slightly more intellectual than most movies
in the ever-growing action-adventure genre,
and is definitely entertaining and exciting to
watch, it certainly doesn't offer much to re
hash afterwards.

Sunday, Jan. 22 — The Lion King
This long-awaited, multi-million dollar pro
ject from Disney features the voices of Jeremy
Irons, Matthew Broderick and Whoopi
Goldberg. As expected, the animation is
amazing, but the movie suffers by compari
son — it's no "Aladdin." But if you feel like
you just can't get enough of the puke-a-li
cious Elton John sapfest "Can You Feel the
Love Tonight?" you may want to drop in on
this one for the soundtrack.
Sunday, Jan. 29 — The Adventures of Priscil
la, Queen of the Desert
Set in Australia, this movie chronicles the
cross-continent travels of three drag queen
friends who each find something unexpect
ed in this eclectic film. A flamboyant musical
romp into the incongruous worlds of drag
cabaret / cross-dressing and the Australian
equivalent of redneck-ville, the film offers
plenty of side-splitting laughs as well as is
sues to think about afterward.
Sunday, Feb. 5 — The River Wild
Meryl Streep's strong performance keeps the
film afloat as she plays Gail, the heroine
mother who paddles her family through the
treacherous rapids in this aquatic thriller.

Like "Speed" in a river raft. Or something like
that.
Sunday, Feb. 12 — Blade Runner — The Di
rector's Cut
Another Harrison Ford film, but one that has
become a classic, at least in sci-fi circles.
"Blade Runner" combines a fascinating plot
with vivid cinematography and explosive ac
tion to pose penetrating questions about hu
manity.
Monday, Feb. 20 — Interview with a Vam
pire
Much hype, but the cinematic version of Ann
Rice's best-seller has little tangible substance
to offer the serious film-goer. There are lots
of cool blood-sucking scenes, though. Tom
Cruise and Brad Pitt fans can come to view
the goods, if they can ignore the on-again,
off-again accents — can anyone say "Robin
Hood"?
Sunday, Feb. 26 — Stargate
Kurt Russell, James Spader and Jaye David
son take a silly script and do nothing with it,
producing a singularly unmemorable sci
ence fiction film, notable only for its imagi
native special effects. In an obvious inci

dence of typecasting, Davidson goes straight
from playing a cross-dressing man ("The
Crying Game") to an androgynous alien-fig
ure.
Sunday, Mar. 5 — Quiz Show
Directed by Robert Redford, "Quiz Show"
chronicles the true story of the infamous
"Twenty-One" scandal in the 19505. John
Turturro and Ralph Fiennes star in a film that
is at once both troubling and reassuring as it
considers the power of mass media. A
thoughtful and gripping tale that will make
you think twice about those television-cor
porate types.
Sunday, Mar. 12 — Forrest Gump
Like you haven't heard about this film. (We're
not even going to rehash any cute quotes
about chocolates or peas and carrots.)
Sunday, Mar. 19 — Casablanca
"Play it again, Sam," "Here's lookin' at you,
kid," "This could be the beginning of a beau
tiful friendship," ... a showing of this, per
haps the greatest of American films, gives the
audience a chance to count the number of
lines which have become standard parlance
in American English.
