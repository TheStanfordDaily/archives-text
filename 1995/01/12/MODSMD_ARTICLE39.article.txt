experience Odwalla beyond the refrigerator

over the Bridge
and see what the

MON/16
■ They're on T.V., they've taken over
the toy stores and now they're com
ing to San Jose. If you're a Mighty
Morphin Power Ranger fan, you won't
want to miss their "concert" appear
ances, Jan. 16-19 and 21-22. We can
only speculate as to what they might be in
store for us, whether the White Ranger will
make an appearance, and why on earth any
one would pay the $9.50-$3O ticket prices for
the shows. Showtimes vary Event Center, San
Jose State University. Call BASS for tickets.

lessly through the air of an aban
doned church. . . . Computer technol
ogy meets the art of photography in
the work of Dan Burkholder, now on
exhibit at San Francisco's Vision
North Gallery. While some purists balk at
the idea of digitizing photographic negatives
and manipulating them via computer pro
grams such as Photo Shop, Burkholder steps
into the twenty-first century of art without reser
vations. He maintains the hands-on feel of the
platinum / palladium print by processing the
finished digitized image by the more conven
tional method. The result is a comfortable
merging of past and present. Vision North
Gallery, 2300 Polk Street at Green, in S.F.

to 7 p.m. Exhibit continues through Jan. 21

novative, if not always completely accessible.
Concert begins at 8 p.m. in the Veterans Build
ing Green Room (401 Van Ness Ave., S.F.).
There will be a pre-concert discussion at 7
p.m., included in the $6 $14 (student discount

■ A placid sea turtle floats weight
lessly through the air of an aban
doned church. . . . Computer technol
ogy meets the art of photography in
the work of Dan Burkholder, now on
exhibit at San Francisco's Vision
North Gallery. While some purists balk at
the idea of digitizing photographic negatives
and manipulating them via computer pro
grams such as Photo Shop, Burkholder steps
into the twenty-first century of art without reser
vations. He maintains the hands-on feel of the
platinum / palladium print by processing the
finished digitized image by the more conven
tional method. The result is a comfortable
merging of past and present. Vision North
Gallery, 2300 Polk Street at Green, in S.F.
Gallery hours are Tues. through Sat., 10 a.m.
to 7 p.m. Exhibit continues through Jan. 21
