# CIV profs criticize CUE report findings
## 40 sign letter of protest overloading core 
### Burt Herman Staff writer 
In the first public outcry against the
Commission on Undergraduate Educa
tion's report, 40 Cultures, Ideas and Values
faculty members have opposed suggested
changes to the CIV requirement.
Professors, lecturers and administra
tors from all nine CIV tracks questioned

the commission's recom
mendations in a letter pub
lished in yesterday's issue
of Campus Report.
The letter said the pro
posed changes will only
force more material into
already overburdened CIV
classes. Individually, CIV
professors also said they
felt they did not have

enough input on the com
mission's recommenda
tions.
"The commission com
ing down from on high
and telling us to do some
thing — that isn't con
structive criticism," said
Philosophy Prof. John
Dupr6, one of the letter's
co-signers.

The commission's report recommends
combining the current world cultures and
American cultures distribution require
ments (Areas 2 and 3) into the Area 1 CIV
track, paring down the number of classes
required from five to three.
Underlying the controversy is a question
which has plagued the CIV program from

its inception — what its mission
should be and how the courses
can be tailored to achieve these
goals.
The 40 faculty members take
issue over the commission's defi
nition of ClV's mission to provide
a shared academic background for
students.
The commission's report
"defines the requisite 'common
intellectual experience' not so
much in terms of providing stu
dents with an 'understanding of
ideas and values drawn from dif
ferent strands of their own cul
ture ... of cultural diversity and
the process of cultural interac
tion,' but rather in terms of mini
mal common readings, vague

common themes, and a common
undefined approach," the letter
said.
The faculty members opposed
to the CIV recommendation say
that the world cultures and
American cultures distribution
requirements were created in
1990 because of the CIV pro
gram's inability to adequately
address those specific academic
areas.
The letter says that CIV class
es already have trouble squeezing
in all the cultural topics they are
supposed to address which can be
a "source of frustration for both
students and faculty."
"Can we add to the criteria
that each track's syllabus must
meet without compounding this
problem?" the letter continues.
History Prof. Paul Seaver,
director of the CIV program and a
co-signer of the letter, said he

fears that following the commis
sion's guidelines will discourage
faculty from wanting to teach CIV
courses.
Some CIV courses were only
designed three or four years ago
— the typical amount of time a
course usually needs to "shake
down" its faults, Seaver said.
"What worries me is demoraliza
tion of faculty," he said. "To be
told you have to scrap [a course]
— it is very discouraging."
"It's unlikely I would carry on
teaching in the track" if the rec
ommendations are adopted, said
Dupr6. "There needs to be some
real discussion as to what is feasi
ble."
Some faculty also feel that
placing the culture requirements
back into the CIV program would
be "turning back the clock,"
Seaver added.
Many CIV professors agree

that changes should be made in
their program, yet are upset over
the process that was used to come
up with the commission's recom
mendations.
CIV faculty members complain
that they were not adequately
consulted during the commis
sion's evaluation, a fact which
commission chair and History
Prof. James Sheehan said was
intentional. Sheehan said the
commission focused instead on
what students feel they take from
CIV.
"We knew what the [CIV] staff
was doing," he said, citing the
fact that course descriptions and
syllabi are readily available. "We
didn't know how the course was
being received by students."
But Dupr6 disagreed, saying
that "just picking up a copy of a
syllabus" is not an accurate way
"to figure out what the faculty is

trying to resolve."
"There hasn't been any kind of
dialogue," Dupre said. "Very few
people involved in teaching were
consulted."
The controversy surrounding
the commission's recommenda
tions was not entirely unexpected
by members of the commission,
Sheehan said.
"We knew CIV was going to be
the most controversial," he said.
"There were not that many sur
prises [in the letter] — people on
CUE brought these things up
before."
The current debate is part of
what the commission originally
hoped to achieve, Sheehan said.
"I'm not scandalized or shocked
by the fact that people didn't
stand up and applaud," he said.
"We can start a dialogue."
"I wouldn't want to believe
that the way we do [CIV] now is

the only way to do it," Sheehan
added. "We have to find ways of
making disagreement produc
tive."
The CIV recommendation will
come up for debate in front of the
Faculty Senate on Feb. 9, said
senate chair and Biology Prof.
Bob Simoni. The issue was origi
nally scheduled for debate later
in the year, but faculty concerns
moved the date earlier.
Simoni said that the earliest a
new CIV program could be imple
mented would be fall quarter of
1996. "It's questionable that
we'll come to a decision by the
end of this academic year," he
said.
Provost Condoleezza Rice will
be appointing a committee to dis
cuss the commission's recommen

"It's unlikely I would carry on
teaching in the track" if the rec
ommendations are adopted, said
Dupr6. "There needs to be some
real discussion as to what is feasi
ble."
Some faculty also feel that
placing the culture requirements
back into the CIV program would
be "turning back the clock,"
Seaver added.
Many CIV professors agree

that changes should be made in
their program, yet are upset over
the process that was used to come
up with the commission's recom
mendations.
CIV faculty members complain
that they were not adequately
consulted during the commis
sion's evaluation, a fact which
commission chair and History
Prof. James Sheehan said was
intentional. Sheehan said the
commission focused instead on
what students feel they take from
CIV.
"We knew what the [CIV] staff
was doing," he said, citing the
fact that course descriptions and
syllabi are readily available. "We
didn't know how the course was
being received by students."
But Dupr6 disagreed, saying
that "just picking up a copy of a
syllabus" is not an accurate way
"to figure out what the faculty is

trying to resolve."
"There hasn't been any kind of
dialogue," Dupre said. "Very few
people involved in teaching were
consulted."
The controversy surrounding
the commission's recommenda
tions was not entirely unexpected
by members of the commission,
Sheehan said.
"We knew CIV was going to be
the most controversial," he said.
"There were not that many sur
prises [in the letter] — people on
CUE brought these things up
before."
The current debate is part of
what the commission originally
hoped to achieve, Sheehan said.
"I'm not scandalized or shocked
by the fact that people didn't
stand up and applaud," he said.
"We can start a dialogue."
"I wouldn't want to believe
that the way we do [CIV] now is

the only way to do it," Sheehan
added. "We have to find ways of
making disagreement produc
tive."
The CIV recommendation will
come up for debate in front of the
Faculty Senate on Feb. 9, said
senate chair and Biology Prof.
Bob Simoni. The issue was origi
nally scheduled for debate later
in the year, but faculty concerns
moved the date earlier.
Simoni said that the earliest a
new CIV program could be imple
mented would be fall quarter of
1996. "It's questionable that
we'll come to a decision by the
end of this academic year," he
said.
Provost Condoleezza Rice will
be appointing a committee to dis
cuss the commission's recommen
dations on CIV and the world and
American cultures requirements
in the next few months.
