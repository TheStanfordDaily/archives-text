# CIV profs criticize CUE report findings
## 40 sign letter of protest overloading core 
### Burt Herman Staff writer 
In the first public outcry against the
Commission on Undergraduate Educa
tion's report, 40 Cultures, Ideas and Values
faculty members have opposed suggested
changes to the CIV requirement.
Professors, lecturers and administra
tors from all nine CIV tracks questioned

the commission's recom
mendations in a letter pub
lished in yesterday's issue
of Campus Report.
The letter said the pro
posed changes will only
force more material into
already overburdened CIV
classes. Individually, CIV
professors also said they
felt they did not have

enough input on the com
mission's recommenda
tions.
"The commission com
ing down from on high
and telling us to do some
thing â€” that isn't con
structive criticism," said
Philosophy Prof. John
Dupr6, one of the letter's
co-signers.

The commission's report recommends
combining the current world cultures and
American cultures distribution require
ments (Areas 2 and 3) into the Area 1 CIV
track, paring down the number of classes
required from five to three.
Underlying the controversy is a question
which has plagued the CIV program from
