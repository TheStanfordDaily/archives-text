# Speech code decision now in judge's hands
## 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Arguing that Stanford's speech code vio
lates statutory law as well as the Constitu
tion, nine plaintiffs who launched a suit
against the code last year recently filed
their final briefs and await a judge's final
decision.
The code, called the Grey Interpretation
of Stanford's Fundamental Standard, was
issued in 1990 and prohibits students from

using "gutter epithets and symbols of big
otry" against an individual or small groups
of people based on race, sex, disability, reli
gion or sexual orientation.
The plaintiffs' final briefs — issued on
Dec. 5 — focus on defending the 1992
Leonard Law, a California law that pro
hibits private universities from restricting
the speech rights that a student would nor
mally have outside of the campus.
The filing of the briefs now paves th 6
way for Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Peter
Stone to make a final decision on
the speech code.
"We must tolerate thought
that we disagree with," said Rob
Corry, spokesperson for the
plaintiffs and a 1994 Law School
graduate. "There is no right in
the First Amendment to not be
offended."
In its own brief to the court,
the University argues that the
Leonard Law restricts Stanford's
speech rights as a private organi
zation and may be itself uncon
stitutional, said Iris Brest, asso
ciate general counsel for the Uni
versity.
"We counter that with several
cases," Corry said. "In my time at
Stanford (Law School), I never
once heard of private property
going over free speech."
Since the lawsuit was filed, the
University has claimed that the
Leonard Law does not apply to
Stanford in the use of the Funda
mental Standard and runs
counter to the express purpose of
the University.
According to Corry, however,
"Stanford exists for the exchange
of ideas, thoughts and reasons,"
and the Grey Interpretation con
flicts with that purpose.
Brest said that the constitu

tionality of the Grey Interpreta
tion as well as the Leonard Law
depends on how one interprets
the two codes.
Corry agreed that it is "not
really a factual dispute" and
therefore there is no need to go to
trial; the judge's decision will
be the final word on the sub
ject.
Among the federal cases the
plaintiffs cite in their brief is
R.A.V. vs. the City of St. Paul, a
1992 dispute which involved a
cross-burning incident on private
property. In the case, the
Supreme Court held in favor of
free speech over private property
rights.
The plaintiffs originally filed
the lawsuit against the Universi
ty last May and later applied for a
temporary injunction on the
speech code until a trial could be
held.
Rather than ruling on whether
to grant the injunction, Stone
postponed action on the case and
requested more information from
both sides before making a final
decision.
Both sides later agreed that a
decision on the injunction would
mean a decision on the case
itself.
Neither party knows when the
judge will make his final deci
sion.
"The litigation took much
longer than we expected," Corry
said. "This whole thing has been
a learning experience."
