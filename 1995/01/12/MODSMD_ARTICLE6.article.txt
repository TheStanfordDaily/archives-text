### Anita Krishnamurthy 
The Stanford University Museum of
Art has appointed Patience Young to
the newly-created position of Curator of
Education, despite the fact that the mu
seum does not have plans to reopen
until 1997.
Young will join the museum staff
next week, starting January 17. Her ar
rival concludes a national search which
brought six candidates to campus for in
terviews.
Although the museum is currently
closed to the general public due to dam
age incurred in the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake, many programs are still
held, such as tours, outdoor art exhibits
and presentations at local schools.
"The museum is still quite active,
reaching approximately 15,000 children
each year," said Mona Duggan, a
spokeswoman for the museum.
Young will help with these programs
as well as develop other community ed

ucation programs and collaborate with
Stanford's academic departments.
A major part of her job will also be her
involvement with other curators in
planning exhibitions, installing perma
nent collections and starting education

programs to enhance the new museum.
"Young will be helping to promote
our educational priorities and refine our
educational mission," said Bernard Bar
ryte, the associate director of the muse
um.
In addition, Young will be involved
with the extensive planning necessary
for the museum reopening scheduled
for mid-1997.
"Right now her job is preparatory,"

said Barryte. "She needs to make sure
everything is in place when the museum
opens."
Young has held various positions at
the Detroit Institute of the Arts over the
past 18 years, working her way up to the

position of head curator of education.
"For 18 years Patience played a criti
cal role in carrying out the DlA's mis
sion of offering the highest quality edu
cation programs for students of all
ages," said Samuel Sachs, the insti
tute's director, in a statement.
At the Detroit Institute of the Arts,
Young supervised visitor / community
services, including many educational
programs, from teacher workshops to

computer software for classrooms.
Prior to working at the institute,
Young taught art history at Drew Uni
versity for three years. Museum officials
expect that her extensive background
will make her well-prepared to improve
the University's education and commu
nity programs.
"We are delighted that Patience has
accepted our offer. She will bring to
Stanford a deep knowledge of the field of
museum education," said Thomas
Seligman, the Director of the Stanford
Museum of Art, in a statement. Selig
man is currently out of town and could
not be reached for further comment.
The museum's goal in hiring Young
is to have more outreach to the commu
nity through educational programs,
Duggan said. In addition, according to
Duggan, "the museum hopes to have
outreach to University students
through both formal education pro
grams and aesthetic-appreciation pro
grams."
