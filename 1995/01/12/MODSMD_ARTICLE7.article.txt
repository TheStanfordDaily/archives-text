# Hanging on to 'Faded Dreams'
## Prof. Carnoy reflects on race, economics in new book 
### Blair Lawson 
For Martin Carnoy, 1966 was the beginning of
his active political involvement. Two years into the
Vietnam War, Carnoy saw an article about children
being napalmed by American planes.
He recalls thinking, "If I were Vietnamese, and
this was happening to my kids, what would I do?. ..
I just saw, and I understood, that we had to get out.
Twenty-eight years and 20-some books later,
Martin Carnoy, professor of economics and educa
tion and author of "Faded Dreams: The Politics and
Economics of Race in America," persists in his at
tempts to show America that "there is a right and
wrong."
"Faded Dreams," Carnoy's newest publication,
tackles the problem of race and economic inequali
ty in America.
He bases the arguments of the book on his in
depth study of fluctuations in African-American

Prof. Martin
Carnoy re
cently wrote
the book
"Faded
Dreams: The
Politics and
Economics of
Race in Amer
ica." Carnoy
asserts that
income dis
parities be
tween
African-Amer
icans, Latinos
and whites
can be mini
mized
through gov
ernment-initi-
ated social
and economic
programs.
and Latino incomes relative to
those of whites in the past half
century.
From this economic analysis,
Carnoy asserts that income dis
parities between these groups
can be minimized through gov
ernment-initiated social and eco
nomic programs.
Reform, according to Carnoy,
must start with a shift in govern
ment ideology. He believes politi
cal leaders must present society
as reformable by a competent
and involved government.
In light of the recent elections,
Carnoy laments that "a gang of
thieves has come along and con
vinced everybody that that can't
be done."
"Faded Dreams" proves
Carnoy's ongoing commitment
to convince America that its situ
ation can, in fact, be improved.
The book is aimed at an audi

ence of people "who are upset by
the fact that the country is going
in the direction that it is." While
Carnoy admits to not presenting
a specific strategy for reform, he
asserts that "at least the intellec
tual basis for going in a particu
lar direction is there."
But Carnoy has not limited
his means of influence to norma
tive politico-economic analyses.
He has been actively involved in
politics since 1968, when he
worked on the Robert Kennedy
campaign in Washington, D.C.
"We were very idealistic at
that time," he said. "We thought
we were going to change the
world .. .We were really going to
make a tremendous difference."
Kennedy's death prompted
Carnoy to take a job in the edu
cation department at Stanford in
1969. "I never intended to stay
all that long, but it's hard to
beat!" he admitted.
Carnoy's situation certainly
does seem hard to beat. He ges
tures towards the view of the
foothills outside his office in the

Advanced Center for Behavioral
Sciences, where he spends time
on sabbatical working on myriad
projects.
"As usual in my life," he
remarked, "I never work on just
one thing at a time."
One of his main projects is a
book about fathering in middle
age. Already the father of two
sons in their late 20s, one of
whom is helping him with this
book, Carnoy— now the father of
a three-year-old daughter — is
writing a "popularly-written
book" about the experiences of
fathers over 45 with young chil
dren.
"Kids are the easiest things in
the world," he said, relating his
experiences as an older and wiser
father. "I just don't get as
upset."
Through his experiences as
Robert Kennedy's campaign
manager in the D.C. primary, a
Democratic candidate for
Congress himself in 1984, and
the author of numerous books on
America's socio-economic prob

lems, Carnoy has actively stood
by his belief that "there has to be
some morality in this world, not
just materialism."
So when did he make the
switch from activist to academic?
"Never," he said vehemently.
Since that first realization dur
ing the Vietnam War, Carnoy has
persistently devoted his energies
to ameliorating America's ills.
"I attach a value to living in a
society in which I think nobody's
harmed if they work and follow
the rules, one in which the differ
ent classes are not in such stark
contrast to each other," Carnoy
said.
He offered an analogy
between inventing new ways to
solve these seemingly insur
mountable problems and teach
ing his daughter to swim:
"You've got to put your head
under the water to learn how to
swim," he said. And, he added, if
you keep grappling with the
problem, you will eventually find
that "there is something that
will work."
