YOU ARE NOT ALONE
AN ADULT CHILDREN OF ALCOHOLICS GROUP at CAPS
Dr. Al Cooper and Dr. Mary Ann Aposhian, both therapists at Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) invite you to an 8 week, semi-structured Adult Children of Alcoholics (A.CA.) group. If you are an
A.C A, you probably have problems with intimacy, co-dependent relationships, intense feelings of loneliness,
control issues, and a tendency to over extend yourself But you are not alone. TWenty-eight million Americans,
(or one out of eight Americans) have at least one alcoholic parent More than 50% of today's alcoholics had an
alcoholic parent A.CA's have a 5 to 8 times greater risk of becoming alcoholics than non-A.CA.'s. A recent
study at UC.S.B found that 11% of the respondents identified themselves as A.CA.'s, related studies at other
universities demonstrate similar findings. In 1987, therapists at CAPS noticed that a large number of the
students who sought services had one or more alcoholic parents. Recognizing the importance of treatment for
A.CA's, as well as the responsiveness of students to brief Interventions, we decided to develop a semi
structured, short-term group program Over the past six years, the group structure has been refined and
improved. If you are an A.CA and would like a rewarding but intensive experience, call ASAP. for pre
screening. Space is limited. "Hie group will meet Fridays, from 3:00 to 4:30, beginning Jan. 20. CAPS offers a
variety of groups each quarter, with groups ranging from topics which have included procrastination, anxiety,
male sexuality and spirituality, sexual identity, ethnic women's issues, (Including an Asian American women's
group and a Middle Eastern women's group), and shyness. Groups can often be an enlivening and intensive
way of creatively healing ourselves. Call CAPS at 723-3785 for more information on the AC A groups, and a
listing of other groups which are currently available..

BORN IN AMERICA OR ABROAD: GROUP SUPPORT
FOR MIDDLE EASTERN WOMEN STUDENTS
There are over 140 Middle Eastern Stanford students who were born in the Middle East how many of these students
are women? How many Middle Eastern students born in America are there at Stanford? Though there are innumerable
ethnic groups and organizations on campus, there appears to be no ethnic organization or group for Middle Eastern
students. Why are there no such groups?
If you are a Middle Eastern woman, do you tend to not identify yourself as one for fear people will preach about the
terrible hostage takings and terrorism of Middle Easterners? Or, if you identify yourself as a Middle Eastern woman, do you
find people assume you should be wearing a veil and are helpless? Do you miss the close women relationships you've had
with other Middle Eastern women in the past'
Dr. Mary Ann Aposhian, from Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is offering a support/discussion group for
Middle Eastern women. The objective of the group is to bring the community together; establish support and pride in
women's Middle Eastern culture, and to discover more about ourselves as Middle Eastern women. If you are interested in an
intensive, supportive experience, please call CAPS at 723-3785, and ask for Mary Ann Aposhian, Ph.D. The group is open to
a limited number of participants and begins Jan. 16, from 4:00-4:15, or Jan. 18, from 3:00-4:30, or 5:00-6:30. Space is
