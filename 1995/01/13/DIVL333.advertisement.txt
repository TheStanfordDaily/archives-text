PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS OF PSYCHOLOGY 199
PSYCHOLOGY OF MIND CONTROL
I am very sorry for the inconvenience for you created by postponing this
course until spring term. Recent shoulder surgery has immobilized my arm
(making the commute to Stanford difficult) ana the pain and medication
makes it difKcult to think or plan lectures.
All pre-registered students will still have their priority in the spring course.
If you signed up but cannot make the sprint term (T,Th 1:15-3:30),
please contact my secretary (/25-2417).
You might want to get a head start by beginning some of the readings,
Cialdini book, section 1, vol. 1 of the reader.
