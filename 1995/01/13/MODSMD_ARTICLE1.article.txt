## Bridge counselors to keep buildings, despite repair costs 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
After months of speculation that they might have
to move, counselors at the Bridge said they may be al
lowed to keep their two buildings despite the costs of
needed repairs.
"Basically, we've been guaranteed the space for
the next four years," said senior Christopher Li, a
live-in counselor. Office of Student Activities Pro
gram Coordinator Troy Gilbert notified him of the
decision on Wednesday, Li said.
Though Gilbert was more reserved, he said that
"prospects look good" for the 24-hour peer counsel
ing center.
"The students have done a great job meeting with
administrators and talking about why their program
is great, and that has benefited them," Gilbert added.
A study conducted by the University last year
found that the Bridge buildings needed significant re
pairs to their foundations and general structures.
Though officials said at the time that students were
in no immediate danger, the University told live-in
counselors they would probably have to move.
Earlier this year, Bridge counselors met with
Diana Conklin, acting co-director of Residential Edu
cation, about the possibility of turning a residence
hall into a counseling theme dorm.
An important issue in the potential closing of the
building has been the counseling center's 24-hour op
erations. Because the Bridge houses four full-time
staffers, the group is able to operate overnight.
"The administration is doing a re-evaluation of all
the buildings that fall under [Vice Provost and Dean
for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds'] jurisdiction," Li
said. "There's been money set aside under the vice
provost to fix the buildings.. .. What I heard is that
hopefully all the inspections will be completed by the
end of winter quarter."
Edmonds could not be reached for comment yes
terday.
Though Gilbert said he is not sure whether the
University will conduct fall inspections of the two
Bridge buildings, he does know that the facilities will
be reviewed.
Li added that he does not know why the Universi
ty funding was made available to the counseling cen
ter. The Bridge makes most of its own money by hold
ing the annual Spring Faire, rather than from ASSU
special fees.
"I guess it was a combination of issues. We re
leased a report with cost estimates for repairs to the
Bridge — short-term and long-term," he said. "They
were very rough estimates but much more specific
than what we had before."
Specifically, Li said it would cost approximately
$10,000 for short-term repairs — which would last
for about five years — and $150,000 to $200,000 to
make longer-term repairs. After inspections are com
plete, the Bridge will figure out how to put the money
toward repairs, he added.
