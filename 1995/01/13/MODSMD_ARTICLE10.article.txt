Chechnya nears collapse
GROZNY, Russia (AP) — Russian
forces bombarded the capital of Chech
nya yesterday with their fiercest
attack yet, showering the disintegrat
ing city with waves of artillery and
rockets as rebel resistance neared col
lapse.
Demoralized bands of haggard
Chechen fighters resisted the fero
cious new onslaught. Incoming Rus
sian troops vowed to take the capital
and end the month-long fighting in the
secessionist republic.
Rebels retreated house by house
from Russian forces closing relentless
ly on the battered presidential palace
in the city's heart. Russian helicopters
sounded overhead for the first time.

Plumes of black smoke spiraled
hundreds of feet over the city while
shells slammed into buildings.
Machine-gun and small-arms fire
echoed as Moscow's troops attacked
from three directions.
Airline crash claims 51
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — A jetlin
er with at least 52 people aboard crashed
into a field after an onboard explosion
near the Caribbean resort of Cartagena,
officials said.
The only known survivor hours after
the crash was a 9-year-old girl who suf
fered a broken arm. Rescuers were still
arriving at the crash site, and radio
reporters there said the nighttime scene
was confused.
