# Malcolm X's daughter charged
## Woman allegedly plotted to slay father's suspected assassin 
### 
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) â€” A daughter
of Malcolm X was charged yesterday
with trying to hire a hitman to kill Louis
Farrakhan, the fiery Nation of Islam
leader who Malcolm's family claims had
a hand in his 1965 assassination.
Qubilah Shabazz, who witnessed her
father's murder as a girl of about 5, was
accused of using the telephone and
crossing state lines in trying to set up
Farrakhan's slaying by an unidentified
government informant.
If convicted, the 34-year-old woman
could get up to 90 years in prison and
$2.25 million in fmes.
Authorities said the plot against Far
rakhan didn't get past the planning
stages, and he was never in any immedi
ate danger.

Details of how he was to be killed
were not disclosed.
Farrakhan, who lives in Chicago,
couldn't immediately be reached for
comment; the Nation of Islam scheduled
a news conference for today.
Shabazz, dressed neatly and wearing
her hair in braided rows pulled back in a
French twist, appeared in court for a
brief hearing yesterday and was released
on $10,000 bail.
Prosecutors refused to give a motive
for the alleged plot against the 61-year
old Farrakhan.
But Qubilah Shabazz's court
appointed lawyer, Scott Tilsen said he
expected the government to argue that
Shabazz believed Farrakhan was
involved in her father's murder.

Members of Malcolm X's family have
long suspected that Farrakhan had a
hand in the assassination of the Black
Muslim in the Audubon Ballroom in
New York City's Harlem. Malcolm was
shot to death on Feb. 21, 1965, as he
gave a speech to followers.
A year after Malcolm X's slaying,
three men were convicted in the murder.
Two were Nation of Islam members.
The three were sentenced to at least 20
years in prison. At least two have since
been paroled.
Malcolm X's widow, Betty Shabazz,
said as recently as last year that she
believes Farrakhan was involved.
Tilsen said Qubilah Shabazz was
entrapped by the man who was supposed
to assassinate Farrakhan.
