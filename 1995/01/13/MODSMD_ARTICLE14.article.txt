## Editorial Streamline sign-ups 
### 
University should have
a designated period for
early course sign-ups

WHILE STANFORD stu
dents appreciate the
intimacy and personal
attention afforded by small
classes, we all know that these
luxuries often have a cost associ
ated with them. Most often this
cost takes the form of early class
sign-up lists which dole out
spots based on a first-come,
first-serve basis, forcing stu
dents to trek across campus in
sometimes futile and perplexing
quests to register.
Some departments have
course sign-ups at the end — or
even before the end — of the pre
vious quarter, posting sign-up
sheets in hallways. Others have
sign-ups which are posted prior
to the first day of the following
quarter (sometimes before many
students have even returned
from vacation). Others have no
sign-ups at all.
Often, the only way students
can learn when and how to sign
up for classes is through cryptic
codes in the Time Schedule or by
word of mouth. This results in
confusion and inconvenience for
students, who concurrently have
to deal with travel arrange
ments, final exams and term
papers.
Many times, though, eager
students flip through their Time
Schedules just before or during
break only to discover that they
cannot take certain courses
because they have already
missed the sign-up dates. For
example, one Anthropology class
— Anthro 161: Conservation and
Community Development in
Latin America — required stu
dents to sign a list beginning last
November for entrance to the
course this quarter! Such a poli

cy can prevent students who do
not know the ins and outs of a
department from taking a class,
since Time Schedules are avail
able only one or two weeks
before break.
The University should insti
tute some consistency through
out the separate departments to
prevent such mishaps. This could
most easily be done by designat
ing three days to be the universal
"course sign-up period" for the
whole school. Each department
should be able to decide how it
wants to conduct registration —
by first-come, first-serve sign
ups, by application process or by
sign-ups with priority for majors
and graduating seniors. Of
course, the department should
also make efforts to see that
every student (and not just that
department's majors) knows
when and how the department
conducts registration.
The History Department has
already brought some order to
class sign-ups for its courses. The
department has set up a short
period during Dead Week to sign
up for classes beginning the fol
lowing quarter. Moreover, a sys
tem of priorities has been insti
tuted for course registration.
Jodi Berardino, undergradu
ate assistant for the History
Department, says that this new
method helps prevent professors
from having erroneous lists and
simultaneously helps cut down
the legwork for students. While
over enrollment still exists, simi
lar methods should be adopted
by other departments.
No matter what changes are
made, it is inevitable that some
students will still be denied
entrance into small classes. Nev
ertheless, with some simple
changes students would at least
have equal opportunity to gain
entrance to classes under great
est demand, while avoiding the
confusion of mass-migrations
across campus in search of the
elusive sign-up list.
