A spirituality DR would not do justice to diversity of beliefs

PROMPTED BY Chris Carlsten's
column this past Tuesday, I was
fairly alarmed by his implied
attempt to blend church and state.
When one speaks of spirituality, one
must naturally be vague in context since
the word "spirit" is itself defined differ
ently according to every individual or
religious group. If such a Distribution
Requirement were to be implemented as
Chris jokingly advocates, what "spiritu
ality" would be taught? Would it be the
Christian-mythos or polytheistic? Mus
lim or Buddhist? Taoist or the New

Wave type? A combination of them all?
That would be a very large require
ment to fulfill to say the least, especially
considering that many people already
have their own belief system set in
stone. Some of humanity does not even
believe in the spirit at all, but at the
same time recognizes and respects the
ambition, courage and feelings of others,
The root of the problem is that one's
spirituality, as many define it, is some
thing that cannot be taught, but is
innately part of the individual human
being. If it is something that is taught,

then does the spirit exist at all? My own
belief system is built on an open-minded
perspective of absorbing the beliefs of all
cultures, ideologies and viewpoints to
arrive at a current (but ever-changing)
understanding of myself; thus, if I do
not agree with what someone says, I will
listen to and completely respect their
right to say it. However, when an insti
tution advocates the "need" for spiritu
ality, it then puts restraints on many
peoples' beliefs (or even lack of beliefs)
that are not accepted by the current
social norm. As a result, the foundation

of why this country has adopted the sep
aration of church and state is once again
threatened if an institution takes the
viewpoint that the spirit does indeed
exist.
I completely respect another's need
for spirituality, but condemn it if it is
forced on others. I have "faith" that an
individual can develop his or her own
belief system without having one
imposed. I vote thumbs down on a new
"Spirituality DR."
