# Objectivity, subjectivity divide arts and sciences Professor Emeritus says
## 
### 
Professors Evans and Rebholz are
commendably trying to keep the social
sciences from being conflated with the
humanities in the new distribution
requirement system proposed by the
Commission on Undergraduate Educa
tion. That would cripple the very back
bone of a liberal education. Even the
pragmatic Leland Stanford thought that
the reading and critiquing of "great lit
erature" was indispensable to any stu
dent here.

Have TV, social engineering and the
growing scientifico-technological bent of
Stanford finally driven out the education
that goes to make a cultured human
being? There are many signs that this is
so, including the published debate over
the language requirement: a department
head lamented having wasted her time
studying a foreign language in high
school! On the other hand, one reads of
students smashing their TVs. All may
not be lost.
With that wistful thought, I suggest
that we would better understand what
we are up against if we saw that the fun
damental distinction between art and
science is (vertical and holistic) subjec
tivity vs. (horizontal and analytic) objec
tivity, in line with Pascal's finesse vs.

geometry, Jakobson's metaphoric
metonymic pair, etc. The humanities lie
generally between and — sometimes
called "the liberal arts" — are the solid
core of what general education has long
been in the Western world. Pure art and
pure science are eccentric, in this sense.
Many studies, such as social science, are
newer hybrids tending toward one or the
other extreme or arm.
There are all sorts of classiftcations,
all fairly arbitrary, including the tripar
tite division of Evans-Rebholz and cer
tainly the crude lumping of humanities
and social science by CUE. Indeed, the
whole situation is a fluid field where spe
cific studies defy easy categorization:
there are specific scientists, and social
scientists, who are more humanistic, and

even artistic, than some humanists one
could name. It is best therefore to con
tend oneself with very general epistemo
logical indications and get to the real
problem which is historic and complexly
specific: the broad and deep assault, at
Stanford and elsewhere, on the human
istic spirit and the very idea of dignified
culture.
Unfortunately, the English Depart
ment, which is part of a pampered palace
guard, along with History, has been slow
to see this or care. As we know from the
experience of the totalitarian orders, it is
only a matter of time until the oxen of
the whole intelligentsia, including the
most collaborationist, are gored.
