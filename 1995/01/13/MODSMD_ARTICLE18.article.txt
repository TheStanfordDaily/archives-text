## Adam Ross The 						United States' drift rightward 
### 
LEST ANYONE BE
misled into think
ing that the Nov. 8
midterm elections, in
which voters granted
Republicans control of
Congress for the first
time in 40 years, signi
fied a rejection of all
incumbents, he need

look at only one statistic: No Republican
incumbent — that's right, not one — at
the House, Senate or Gubernatorial level
lost his seat. Voters in this election sent a
rather decisive message to Democratic
politicians across the country: You're
done.
The magnitude of this result shocked
most observers, myself included. Even
The Stanford Review, an organization
viewed by many on campus as being
somewhere to the right of Mussolini,
grossly underestimated the gains Repub
licans would make in Congress (The win
ner of the newspaper's Congressional
pool predicted gains of only 38 House
seats, more than a dozen short of the
actual figure).
How did Republicans gain so much so
fast? Years from now historians will view
1994 as the year in which Americans
finally repudiated the ideas of big gov
ernment liberalism and social welfare
that now confine themselves to class
rooms of schools like Stanford. Of course

this result is due in no small part to Pres
ident Clinton, who reminded Americans
just how terrifying an activist president
can be.
But to blame Bill Clinton or Ira Maga
ziner — the President's fellow Rhodes
Scholar who crafted the behemothic
blueprint for a government takeover of
our health care system — solely for the
death of liberalism is to ignore the con
temporary political history. Dr.
Schlesinger's fail-id hypothesis notwith
standing (he believed that Bill Clinton's
election in 1992 ushered in a new era of
liberalism), this country has been mov
ing to the right since at least 1964, and
perhaps even as early as 1948.
The former, of course, marked the
beginning of Lyndon B. Johnson's Great
Society and the height of the Civil Rights
Movement. While issues such as welfare
and race have always stirred intense pas
sions on both sides, the Johnson admin
istration was noteworthy in that so much
legislation — from profligate social
spending to the Voting Rights Act of
1965 — actually became law.
During the 19605, many Americans
considered gerrymandered districts and
social welfare programs to be a necessary
remedy for the inequities faced by the
poor and minorities. Today, however,
even liberals are beginning to question
the premises behind these assumptions.
As I write this, the new Congress is

poised to overhaul our welfare system
that, almost everyone now agrees, is an
utter and abject failure. The only real
question is how far they will go.
And more than 30 years after Presi
dent Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act,
the fight over racial preferences is again
moving to the forefront. Just Wednesday
the Wall Street Journal wrote, "Racial
and gender set-aside programs, one of
the civil-rights movement's most con
crete — and controversial — achieve
ments, may prove to be a casualty of the
nation's lurch to the political right." In
1996, California will likely consider a
proposal to prevent the state from allot
ting jobs, promotions or contracts based
on gender or skin color. Look for the
measure to pass by a wide margin.
To characterize the 1994 midterm
elections as the wholesale rejection of the
Great Society, while not inaccurate, over
looks a more important point: The coun
try is far more conservative, particularly
on social issues, than elites in either
party will acknowledge. The challenge
for Republicans, therefore, is to keep
pace with this rightward drift. Whether
they'll follow the lead of Newt Gingrich
and Dick Armey, and become true revo
lutionaries, remains to be seen.
