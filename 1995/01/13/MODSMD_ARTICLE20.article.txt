## Slam dunk! Cardinal pours on the heat to upset No. 12 Sun Devils; scorching now at 11-1 overall 
### Daniel Kao Contributing writer 
Arizona St. 75

The Stanford express was back on
track last night, as the Cardinal men's
basketball team (11-1 overall, 2-1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) bulldozed the
12th-ranked Arizona State Sun Devils
(11-3 overall, 1-1 Pac-10) 91-75.
The Cardinal snapped a short one
game losing streak and at the same time
reaped sweet revenge against a Sun
Devil team that came back from a 19-
point deficit in the second half last year
to edge Stanford 71-69.
"This year," said sophomore guard
Brevin Knight, "I wasn't going to let it
happen."
The superlative Knight definitely
didn't let anything of the sort happen.
Knight showed few symptoms of his
tender leg, finishing with 21 points and
five assists. His main role, though, was
to extinguish the hot and heavy ASU
press, a task that he accomplished with
lethal efficiency.
"I was given the green light to

move up the minutes a little bit," Car
dinal head coach Mike Montgomery
said. "And particularly against Ari
zona State's pressure, I felt that there
was certainly the opportunity to use
him that much. I was going to use him
as much as I was allowed to if I need
ed to and that was the case. It's like a
security blanket to know, that you
have a guy that's good against the
pressure to create a lot of situations
for us. In this game it might have even
been more important for us than it
would have been in some other ball
games."
The heat was on Stanford from the
get go, with the Sun Devils applying
their trademark press. The Cardinal
offense worked methodically to dampen
the press and scored a workmanlike 35
points in the first half.
"I thought ASU was very well pre
pared and they did a really nice job in
taking us out of some things," Mont
gomery said. "Yet we didn't panic
shoot. We worked to find an open guy."
The real fun began in the second half
when Stanford detonated an offensive
H-bomb against the Sun Devils erupt
ing for 56 points and shooting a blister
ing 63 percent from the field.
Cardinal guard Dion Cross certainly
enjoyed his bit of vengeance, scorching
the Sun Devils for a game-high 22
points, 14 in the second half. Cross was
7-of-9 for the field and a sizzling 4-of-4

from three-point land.
"This year, we just tried to be more
calm, more mature, and just play good
ball," Cross said. "I was working on my
jumper because I kind of struggled up in
Washington. I made it a point to prac
tice on my jumper because I knew with
out me hitting it we'd struggle a little
bit. You're going to have nights like
these. You wish you could have them
every night, but that's not the case. I
was very fortunate."
Knight, doing a perfect imperson
ation of a human press-breaker, broke
out for 15 second-half points showcas
ing an impressive repertoire of shots.
There were graceful rainbow lay-ins,
gentle dipsy-do floaters, in-your-face
penetration lay-ups off the glass and
even a trifecta for good measure.
"Cross and Knight were just too
much," said ASU head coach Bill
Frieder. "How many times did we take
them down to under five seconds, and
Brevin Knight makes a big time basket
or a big time play? They're an excellent
pair of guards. You've got a penetrator
and shooter. That's going to cause a lot
of teams problems."
Defensively, the Cardinal did an
effective job turning Sun Devil All-Pac
-10 center Mario Bennett into a virtual
nonfactor. Despite his 17 points and six
rebounds, Bennett did little to change

the outcome of the game.
"I just wanted to try to push
him off the blocks because I know
he's very skilled down there once
he gets the ball," said center Tim
Young. "I just wanted to frustrate
him. I think I did my job when I
was in there."
Stanford essentially did
everything it was hoping to do.

The Cardinal worked through
the press, committing 14
turnovers, the fewest number of
turnovers by a Sun Devil oppo
nent, and also shot a high per
centage, scoring the most points
this season by an ASU foe. Stan
ford also displayed strong board
work, gaining a 35-23 edge on
the glass. And of course its 31-
of-33, 94 percent performance
from the charity stripe didn't
hurt either.
"Anytime you shoot the bail as
well as we did and do a reasonable

job defensively you have a chance
to win," Montgomery said.
"That's about what happened. We
didn't turn it over an inordinate
number of times. Never lost our
poise.
"I didn't think ASU did any
thing wrong really. I thought we
just played extremely well. We
had a lot of enthusiasm, and we
had good contributions off the
bench. Other than some
turnovers that were ill-advised,
avoidable certainly, we did virtu
ally what we set out to do."

everything it was hoping to do.

The Cardinal worked through
the press, committing 14
turnovers, the fewest number of
turnovers by a Sun Devil oppo
nent, and also shot a high per
centage, scoring the most points
this season by an ASU foe. Stan
ford also displayed strong board
work, gaining a 35-23 edge on
the glass. And of course its 31-
of-33, 94 percent performance
from the charity stripe didn't
hurt either.
"Anytime you shoot the bail as
well as we did and do a reasonable

job defensively you have a chance
to win," Montgomery said.
"That's about what happened. We
didn't turn it over an inordinate
number of times. Never lost our
poise.
"I didn't think ASU did any
thing wrong really. I thought we
just played extremely well. We
had a lot of enthusiasm, and we
had good contributions off the
bench. Other than some
turnovers that were ill-advised,
avoidable certainly, we did virtu
ally what we set out to do."
