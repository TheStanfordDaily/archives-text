# Knight and Cross find the gaps
## 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Head coach Mike Montgomery has
been worried about Brevin Knight's
potential stress fracture in his right leg
for the past month. But last night, the
sophomore point guard had a different
kind of break in mind as he fractured
the Arizona State full-court press while
guiding Stanford to an upset win over
the 12th-ranked team in the nation.
Stanford's backcourt duo of Knight
and Dion Cross scorched the Sun Dev
ils, combining for 43 points and only
four turnovers in defeating Arizona
State 91-75.
Knight, limited to 28 minutes due to
a sore right shin, had little trouble get
ting past Arizona State's full-court
pressure. Routinely driving to the buck
et and hitting feathery pull-up jumpers
or heading to the foul line, Knight
scored 15 points in the second half,

including six in a crucial five-minute
stretch in which the Cardinal sealed the
victory.
"We weren't going to let what hap
pened last year happen again," Knight
said, remembering last year's home
game versus the Sun Devils in which
Stanford gave up a 19-point second half
lead before losing 71-69. "Anybody who
was here last year would not let that
happen again."
Facing an Arizona State defense
which forces 22.4 turnovers a game
(tops in the Pacific 10 conference),
Stanford only turned the ball over 13
times, the fewest forced by the Sun Dev
ils this year. Worried about Knight's
fragile leg, Montgomery rested the
point guard for nine minutes in the first
half despite only holding a single-digit
lead.
Because of this rest, Knight was
fresh enough to play 17 minutes in the
second half and handle the Arizona

State press. Ahead 35-29 at halftime,
Stanford exploded for 56 points after
intermission.

"We used Knight as much as we
needed to," Montgomery said. Regard
ing the second half outburst, Mont
gomery cited a si2zling 63 percent field
goal shooting and 18-for-20 free-throw
shooting as keys to the victory.
Cross, a junior sharpshooter who had
heen struggling through a mini-slump
during the Washington road trip,
regained his deadeye outside shot, hit
ting 4-of-4 three-pointers and 7-of-9
overall to pace all scorers with 22 points.
On the season, Cross has hit 34-of-57
beyond the arc, a blazing 59.6 percent.
"They tried to increase their pres
sure as time went on," Montgomery
said. "There's always a little bit of a
gamble there, and I think we did get
some easier shots because of that —
Brevin penetrating and getting
some shots, hitting shots over
pressure inside."
Even with the Sun Devil
guards denying Knight the ball,
Cross and David Harbour were
effective enough in getting the
ball over halfcourt, which was
Montgomery's greatest con
cern.

"You can't just rely on
Brevin to do everything," Mont
gomery said. "Other people did
a good job against the presß,
and as a result of breaking the
press, we got a lot of foul
shots."
Already leading the Pac-10
in free-throw shooting at 73.8
percent, the Cardinal calmly
tossed in 31-of-33 foul shots.
Except for Rich Jackson's 1-for
-3 foul shooting, all other Cardi
nal players were perfect from
the line.
