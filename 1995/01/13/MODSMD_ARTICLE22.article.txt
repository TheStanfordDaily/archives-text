Cardinal 83
Arizona St. 59

The Stanford women's bas
ketball team initiated Thursday

night's Cardinal sweep of Ari
zona State basketball with a 83-
59 victory over a scrappy Sun
Devil squad that stayed close in
the first half. The Cardinal took
advantage of a 29-7 second half
rebounding edge, however, to
coast to its third straight Pacific
10 Conference victory and its
10th win overall.
Trailing by only two points at
half time, ASU outhustled Stan
ford in the first half, hanging

tough with the No. 5-ranked
squad by dominating the boards
with a 23-16 rebounding advan
tage. This lack of rebounding
characterized the Cardinal's
play in its early games against
tough opponents such as Ten
nessee, Texas Tech and North
Carolina State.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
remained dissatisfied after the
game despite the victory. "I was
disappointed with our intensi
ty," VanDerveer said. "I was dis
appointed with our defense in
the first half."
Stanford struggled with the
undermanned Sun Devils in the
first half due to this rebounding
deficiency as well as a lackluster
41.2 percent shooting percent
age.
"I don't think we expected it,
but we didn't come out ready to
play and Arizona State came out
very aggressively," said senior
guard Kate Paye.
However, VanDerveer man
aged to fire up her squad for the
concluding stanza as Stanford
pulled up the shorts defensively,
allowing a meager 26.7 shooting
percentage and merely seven
total second half rebounds.
Down 46-45 at the 14 minute
mark, the Cardinal also buckled
down defensively, allowing only
13 more points for the rest of
the game.
VanDerveer's 12-1 crew also
coasted to victory thanks in
large part to an emergence out
of the shooting doldrums, hit
ting 47.1 percent of its attempts
including 40.0 percent from
behind the three point bonus
stripe.
Paye led the way with 20
points and seven rebounds.

son shooting form, converting a
scorching four three pointers

The Cardinal also got solid
contributions out of its fresh
men as Kristin Folkl turned in
the best performance of her bas
ketball career with 15 points on
5-of-6 shooting from the field
and 5-of-6 shooting from the
line.
Freshman center Naomi
Mulitaoaupele chipped in as well
with 10 points, eight rebounds

and three blocked shots of her
own. Sophomore Molly Tuter
led ASU with 20 points and eight
rebounds, six of them offensive.
The Cardinal now heads over
to Tucson for a Saturday night
duel against the Arizona Wild
cats who return only one starter,
senior guard Jacinda Sweet,
from last year's squad. Sweet
averaged 10.1 points, 3.6
rebounds and 3.2 assists per
game for last season's 15-12 (8-
