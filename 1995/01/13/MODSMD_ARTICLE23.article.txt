# No relief as men face Arizona
## 
### Daniel Kao Contributing writer 
The Pacific 10 Conference has turned into a cham
ber of horrors this season with terrifying Cougars, Sun
Devils, and now Wildcats popping up everywhere. After
routing 12th-ranked Arizona State last night in Maples
Pavilion 91-75, the Stanford men's basketball team
(11-1 overall, 2-1 in the Pac-10) looks forward to facing
13th-ranked Arizona (11-3 overall, 1-1 Pac-10) tomor
row night. The terror never ceases.
"There's not much relief in the league," said Cardi
nal head coach Mike Montgomery. "That's what the
good league's going to do for us. Then you turn around
and you got Cal, then you turn around and you got
UCLA and USC. You're going to have to play well. If
you're not ready to play, you're going to lose. You might
be a pretty good basketball team and still lose. It's a lit
tle bit scary. You got good basketball when you play
almost every night out in the league."
Coming off a 99-86 victory over Cal, the Wildcats,
who have had a vise-like death grip over the Cardinal,
winning 13 straight over Stanford, are seeking to con
vert the Bay Area double play. And despite losing All-

Pac-10 guard Khalid Reeves and his 24.2 points per
game to the NBA Miami Heat, Arizona still rolls into
town with their thunder and lightning combination of
senior forward Ray Owes and returning All-Pac-10
guard and pre-season All-American Damon
Stoudamire.
Owes has contributed heavily to the Wildcats' suc
cess this season. The six-foot-eight, 224-pound forward
is averaging 15.2 ppg and 9.2 rpg.
"I played against Owes last year," said Stanford for
ward Andy Poppink. "We battled the two games. It's a
good matchup for me. He's about the same size. We
play a lot alike. He likes to shoot it outside, but is still a
good inside player. It's going to be a battle." Owes has
big-sized help on the frontline in the forms of centers
Ben Davis (12.8 ppg, 6.4 rpg) and Joseph Blair (11.4
ppg, 5.1 rpg).
"Arizona has good depth, size, and strength," Mont
gomery said. "Blair is the big horse, going at about 260
or 270 pounds. He's a very strong player in the middle.
Owes is a very active fourman with size. Davis is a good
rebounder."
