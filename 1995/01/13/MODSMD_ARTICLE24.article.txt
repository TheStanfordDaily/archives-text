# Willingham, team will move on despite Frost's absence

### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
As the dust settles after the Scott
Frost bombshell, reactions began to
filter out of a Stanford football pro
gram eager to put last year's diffi
cult 3-7-1 season behind it.
Despite the loss of one of the
team's best athletes and most popu
lar players, the new coaching staff is
quick not to dwell on the loss of one
player among many. Specifically, at
quarterback, senior Mark Butter
field and sophomore Tim Carey
remain on the roster as the lone
scholarship quarterbacks following
the transfer of Frost, a sophomore,
to the National Champion Nebras
ka Cornhuskers.
"I am veiy disappointed that
Scott would decide to leave the
Stanford family," new head coach
Tyrone Willingham said in a state
ment released Wednesday. "We are
saddened by his loss and that of any
other player in our program. I hope
that Scott reaches the goals that he

and his family have set. I wish him
well, as we continue to build a
strong Stanford program."
Willingham added that he had
talked to both Frost and his parents
about "the topic of going or staying
at Stanford."
He also said that any time a new
coaching staff comes in, there is a
greater possibility for transfers than
after just a normal year, and that
Frost may not be the only Cardinal
to transfer during the off-season.
"Every time you have a transi
tion with guys that aren't closely
associated with the players, they
have to look at what's best for
them," Willingham said.
Frost's announcement came as a
modest surprise to his former team
mates. Freshman running back
Anthony Bookman said he knew
there was "a possibility" that Frost
would transfer, but that the discus
sions he had with Frost were not
out of the ordinary.
"It was a surprise to me," Book
man said. "He talked about it

throughout the season, but we all do
that sometimes, second-guessing
ourselves. I didn't think he'd act
upon it."
Both Willingham and Bookman
compared the loss of Frost to the
loss of a family member, but Book
man added that the team has to
move on.
"You rally with the family that
you have left," Bookman said. "You
can't worry about him now."
Meeting yesterday with the
entire team for only the second time
since assuming the head coach posi
tion, Willingham said that he has
"not sensed an impact at all"
regarding Frost's departure.
Frost was part of former head
coach Bill Walsh's first of two
recruiting classes in his three-year
stint on the Farm. Running an
option offense at Wood River (Neb.)
High School that was coached by his
father, Larry, Frost assembled stag
gering offensive numbers. In four
years, he accounted for 11,137 total
yards, the third highest total in
high school history, as of 1993.
His senior year, when he was
named one of the top five quarter
backs in the nation, he was 119-of
-219 for 2,142 yards passing and 21
touchdowns. On the ground, he
galloped for 1,585 yards on 164 car
ries, scoring 33 touchdowns.
Frost will have two years of eli
gibility remaining after sitting
out the 1995 season. According to
NCAA rules, any transfer from a
Division I school to another Divi
sion I school cannot play the fol
lowing year. However, a student
has four years of eligibility run
ning across five years of school
and all that is required for a
transfer is a complete year of res
idency at the new school, but not
necessarily the forfeiture of a
year of eligibility. Because Frost
has not used his redshirt year yet,
that will go into effect next year,
giving Frost two more years of
NCAA Division I eligibility after
the 1995-96 school year.
