# Michigan comes to town
## National women's team to make appearance at triangle home meet 
### Ezra Baylin Contributing writer 
The top-ranked Stanford women's
swimming team will get a chance to see
if its grueling 20,000-yard per day
workouts pay off tomorrow when sec
ond-ranked Michigan rolls into Palo
Alto. The Wolverines will post their
strongest team in recent years, one
that trained through Christmas and
New Year's to prepare for the Cardinal.
Stanford will also host seven mem
bers of the U.S. National Team in a
triangular competition.
"There will be some amazing com
petitions tomorrow with swimmers
like Janet Evans competing against
Stanford and Michigan's best," said
assistant coach Ross Gerry.
The national team members will not
influence the score of the meet, but
their presence may inspire Cardinal
swimmers to compete on a new level.
Evans, a one-time Cardinal, and Angie
Wester-Krieg, a former assistant
coach for Stanford, will help the Car
dinal test its mettle against the best
swimmers in the country.
Although the national team will
provide serious competition for the
Cardinal, the Wolverines still com
prise the main opposition. With a deci
sive win over eighth-ranked UCLA in
Los Angeles, Michigan proved that the
Cardinal will need to swim well to win
on Saturday.
"We do not know too much about
Michigan." said junior distance free

swimmer Jane Skillman, "other than that
they are a real up-and-coming team."
However, top-ranked Stanford has a
definite advantage heading into the
meet, as Cardinal swimmers have been
posting slightly faster times than their
Michigan counterparts.
"Michigan looks really tough, but it
will not be our hardest overall dual
meet of the season," said senior co
captain Kendra Thayer.
Injuries are the only serious obsta
cles that may stand in the Cardinal's
way. Senior Mary Ellen Blanchard,
sophomore Kerry O'Hanlon and junior
Allison Higson are all sidelined and will
not compete in the meet. Even head
coach Richard Quick is sick, but his
assistants expect him to coach the meet
with a nagging case of bronchitis.
Michigan may try to take advantage
of the Cardinal injuries by resting
some of its swimmers for the meet —
as opposed to training strenuously up
until tomorrow's competition — but
Stanford has no plans to rest anyone
since it is so early in the season.
"If Michigan rests even a few of
their swimmers, we'll be ready,"
senior Jenny Thompson said. "It's a
home meet and we'll be able to rise to
meet any challenge."
Besides the Olympian Thompson,
another Stanford swimmer to watch
this weekend will be freshman Kristen
Nyweide. As a walk-on member of the
team who only had some brief conver
sations with Quick before she arrived
on campus, Nyweide has emerged as a

pleasant surprise for the Cardinal.
"Kristen may make a real contribu
tion this weekend," Gerry said.
The Wolverine freshman are also

potent, so the showcase of the meet
could be the younger swimmers.
"Michigan has a strong record, and
they were ranked No. 1 in recruiting

last year, so it will be interesting to see
how their freshmen swimmers do
tomorrow," said assistant coach Don
Witzel.
