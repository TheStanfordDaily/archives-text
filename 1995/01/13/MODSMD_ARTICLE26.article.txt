# Michigan looking for revenge in men's biggest meet of season
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
Last spring, the Stanford men's swim
ming and diving team won its third consec
utive NCAA championship in Minneapolis,
Minn. The Cardinal captured the 1994 title
by swimming past second-place Texas and
third-place Michigan.
But while Stanford's record-setting
senior class was racking up team points,
Michigan's younger swimmers were turn
ing heads with fast swims. When the two
traditional collegiate powerhouses meet at 1
p.m. today at deGuerre Pool, the No. 1-
ranked Wolverines will be out to avenge a

Cardinal victory in Ann Arbor last season.
Senior Brian Retterer and his team
mates are looking forward to the challenge.
"We are prewiring in the same ways as
Michigan," he said. "This is the number one
dual meet of the year for us — both teams
will be ready to swim fast."
While the second-ranked Cardinal is
focused on its ultimate goal of a fourth con
secutive national title, team captain Clay
Tippins acknowledged the importance of
today's clash.
"The NCAAs are a bigger goal, but this is
very, very important," Tippins said. "This is
a big step for us. The dual season is begin
ning and we've done the hardest part of

training. It's time to swim fast, especially
head-to-head with Michigan, who will be
our main competition at NCAAs."
The final result of the meet will not Ik 1
all-telling as far as the NCAA title is con
cerned, since the NCAAs use a champi
onship-scoring system. The Cardiniil is tra
ditionally strong in championship format
meets because of its depth and top talent.
"The complexion of the two teams is dif
ferent," Tippins said. "They prefer dual
meets while we prefer championship meets.
There will be a lot of psychological games
being played — who wins is important."
Stanford and Michigan are familiar with
each other's strengths, and both return sev

eral key performers from last year. Races
which may provide the most drama include
the 50- and 100-yard freestyles. In the 50,
the top three returning collegiates, Retter
er, Michigan's Gustavo Borges and Stan
ford's Joe Hudepohl may compete head-to
head. Borges and Hudepohl are two of col
lege swimming's premier sprint freestylers.
Both Retterer and Tippins noted that the
diving competition will be more important
than ever as the teams look to grab points
away from the racing.
The Wolverine squad boasts several
Olympians, including Borges, backstroker
Royce Sharp and Marcel Wouda. Distance
freestvler and world-record holder in the

400-meter individual medley Tom Dolan, a
sophomore, is another Michigan standout.
"This is (Michigan's! best dual meet
team ever," Retterer said. "They're favored,
but we have a real great championship
team. We have people who perform above
expectations."
As the meet figures to be tight the entire
way, Tippins stressed the importance of
emotional swings.
"It will be important to establish
momentum early and carry it," Tippins
said. "We have to control the momentum of
the meet — when Michigan gets (going
emotionally] we need to have someone step
up and stop that momentum."
