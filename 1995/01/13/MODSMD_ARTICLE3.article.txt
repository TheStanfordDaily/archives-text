## Study shows Stanford grads find financial success, happiness 
### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
You still get what you pay for when it comes to a
Stanford education.
That's what a recent study concluded when it
traced the post-college lives of some 300 Stanford
graduates from the Class of 1981.
Stanford Prof. Herant Katchadourian and Emory
University Prof. John Boli found that Stanford grad
uates not only make more money — an average indi
vidual income of $54,000 a year — but experience
greater degrees of personal satisfaction and happi
ness than many of their colleagues.
Many of the alumni have also become upwardly
mobile, occupying either upper or middle manage
ment positions after only 10 years away from The

Farm, the four-year study cites.
"Those of lower than middle-class backgrounds
have already surpassed the socioeconomic status of
their parents," the researchers state in their book ti
tled "Cream of the Crop: The Impact of Elite Educa
tion in the Decade After College."
"Most of those from more affluent backgrounds
have already regained their parents' status," they
continue.
About 90 percent of alumni surveyed are now in
professional fields — mostly in law, business or med
icine. Most of them attended graduate or profession
al schools.
The alumni have found the steps they have taken
so far to be extremely fulfilling, with less than 10 per-
cent expressing serious dissatis
faction with their lives.
In the book, the authors argue
that the socioeconomic success of
the graduates — which, they note,
is surprisingly the same for
minorities and women — would
be the same for graduates of other
elite colleges in the country.
However, as Katchadourian, a
professor of human biology and a
former dean of undergraduate
studies, believes, the purpose of
higher education is twofold: to
train students for a career and
provide them with a broad liberal
arts education.
Although "Stanford is doing an
excellent job of preparing [stu
dents] for careers," Katchadouri
an writes, "there is very little
residue of the liberal education"
left in the Class of 1981.
Many of the alumni surveyed
placed intellectual curiosities at
the top of their priorities, but in
actuality, they have left it on the

back burner, Katchadourian said.
Many of them continue to put off
academic pursuits, and some
established the trend in college.
In the book, Katchadourian
and Boli divided the graduates
into four categories. "Careerists"
mainly used the University to
advance a career goal; "Intellectu
als" studied for the sake of learn
ing; "Strivers" tried to do both;
and the "Unconnected" didn't fit
any category.
Almost all of the graduates,
regardless of their category, became
successful in many varied fields,
showing no particular pattern in
their chosen professions. Howev
er, the Intellectuals "played a very
different game from the
Careerists," Katchadourian said.
They usually pursued a career for
different reasons and did so rarely
for monetary rewards.
The survey, which originally
started as a University-funded
project several years ago, led to a
previous book, "Careerism and
Intellectualism Among College
Students," and will probably not
be continued, said Boli. It is the
only such study of its kind.
