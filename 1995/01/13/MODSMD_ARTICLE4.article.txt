out for charity.
Although the

game will take place tomorrow at
1 p.m. in the Stanford Stadium,
pre-game events began as early as
Tuesday when players visited a
Shriners Hospital. And yester
day's "Meet the Players" Family

Day gave fans a chance to get the
autographs of their favorite play
ers.
This year marks the East-West
game's 70th anniversary. Pro
ceeds from the game benefit the
Shriners Hospitals for Crippled
and Burned Children. Over the
years the game has raised over
$13 million for the 22 Shriners
Hospitals in the U.S., Canada and
Mexico. Thanks to the annual
game and the support of thou
sands of football fans, along with
other fund-raisers, the hospital's
patients receive free medical care,
organizers said.
Just before the game, patients
of the hospital will get a chance to
march around the stadium in col

orful costumes to the music of
more than 35 high school bands.
Saturday's game will feature
some of college football's most
outstanding players and head
coaches, representing over 45 uni
versities across the nation. The
University of Arizona's Dick
Tomey will serve as head coach for
the West along with Associate

Christian Fauria of Colorado who
is out with a back injury.
"We visited the (Shriners) hos
pital this week," Fisk said. "It's
really terrific. They do a lot for
the disabled children."
Although injury will keep
Stanford's record-setting quar
terback Steve Stenstrom off the
field, it has not stopped him from
actively participating in the
game's festivities.

played in the East-West game:
Rbger Staubach, Walter Payton,
Ed "Too Tall" Jones, and Stan
ford's own John Elway.
