# Issue of minority grads flares again

### Scott Van Winkle Beth Berselli Senior staff writers 
An administrative session of
the Faculty Senate yesterday, de
signed to streamline this year's
senate's action, ended up reignit
ing one of the senate's more con
tentious debates: the recruitment
of minority graduate students.
The possibility of targeting
some Asian-American graduate
students for enhanced recruit
ment efforts, raised by English
Prof. George Dekker, met with
some opposition from Political
Science Prof. Stephen Krasner.
"If you have an ethnic group
that's doing well relative to the
national population," Krasner
asked, "Why would you even en
tertain treating this group as a
targeted minority?"
The University currently
makes an effort to recruit African
Americans, Native Americans,
Mexican Americans and Puerto
Ricans to its graduate schools. A
report released by Dekker's com
mittee earlier this year found that

the University had succeeded in
increasing enrollment among

these "targeted"
groups.
But Dekker
said he had in
quired further
into statistics on
Filipino Ameri
cans because of
questions raised
almost two years
ago by the Sen-

ate Steering
Committee that suggested some
minority groups had been left out.
Current graduate students raised
similar concerns in discussions
this year, Dekker said.
Dekker then explained that
while data on educational achieve
ment had been hard to find, statis
tics showed a high level of income
among recent Filipino immi
grants. That data sparked Kras
ner's question.
The scaled-down meeting also
gave Senate Chair Robert Simoni
a chance to express his regret that
