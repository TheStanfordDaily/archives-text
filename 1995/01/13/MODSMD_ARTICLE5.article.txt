# Issue of minority grads flares again
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Beth Berselli Senior staff writers 
An administrative session of
the Faculty Senate yesterday, de
signed to streamline this year's
senate's action, ended up reignit
ing one of the senate's more con
tentious debates: the recruitment
of minority graduate students.
The possibility of targeting
some Asian-American graduate
students for enhanced recruit
ment efforts, raised by English
Prof. George Dekker, met with
some opposition from Political
Science Prof. Stephen Krasner.
"If you have an ethnic group
that's doing well relative to the
national population," Krasner
asked, "Why would you even en
tertain treating this group as a
targeted minority?"
The University currently
makes an effort to recruit African
Americans, Native Americans,
Mexican Americans and Puerto
Ricans to its graduate schools. A
report released by Dekker's com
mittee earlier this year found that

the University had succeeded in
increasing enrollment among

these "targeted"
groups.
But Dekker
said he had in
quired further
into statistics on
Filipino Ameri
cans because of
questions raised
almost two years
ago by the Sen-

ate Steering
Committee that suggested some
minority groups had been left out.
Current graduate students raised
similar concerns in discussions
this year, Dekker said.
Dekker then explained that
while data on educational achieve
ment had been hard to find, statis
tics showed a high level of income
among recent Filipino immi
grants. That data sparked Kras
ner's question.
The scaled-down meeting also
gave Senate Chair Robert Simoni
a chance to express his regret that


Dekker
Dekker's initial report had not
met with enthusiastic approval.
"We moaned about why we
weren't doing better," Simoni said,
when the people who had worked to
improve University efforts should
have received a pat on the back.
Other annual reports from Sen
ate committees met with less con
troversy.
Religious Studies Prof. Van
Harvey, who chairs the Senate's
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, said his commit
tee was moving forward on recom
mendations of the Commission on

Undergraduate Education,
released earlier this year.
Tying up the committee is the
issue of whether to give academic
credit for activities courses, Harvey
said. The commission gave the com
mittee a "strong recommendation"
that credit not be given, Harvey
said, but opposition from the
Department of Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation and
other sources gave the committee
pause.
The committee also continues to
await a subcommittee report on
improving the evaluation of teach
ing, due to come before the com
mittee this quarter.
"This [report] is coming more
slowly than, I think, any of us
expected," Simoni said.

Finally, the senate approved a
one-year extension of the autho
rization for the Science, Technolo
gy and Society program. The exten
sion allows the program to delay for
one year the intensive review ordi
narily required of interdisciplinary
programs every five years.
Assoc. Dean for the School of
Engineering John Bravman, who
explained the request for an exten
sion, said the program had some
"classic problems" of interdisci
plinary efforts, and needed to rem
edy them before undergoing
review.
The program is currently oper
ated by the engineering school
alone, Bravman said, whereas it
should have greater participation
across departments.
