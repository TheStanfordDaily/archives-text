## Senators say COP can't use its money to fund campaign for special-fee bill 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
ASSU senators who are opposed
to the special-fee reform amend
ment say they may have found a
justification for blocking funding to
campaign for the measure.
At Tuesday's meeting, where an
overwhelming majority of senators
voted for the bill, Council of Presi
dents member Mork Murdock an
nounced that the COP would use
some of its discretionary funds to
campaign for the initiative, which
still must pass the student body
with a two-thirds majority to take
effect.
Opposing senators at the meet
ing attempted unsuccessfully to

garner support for a bill which
would have provided them match
ing funds to campaign against the
measure.
If passed, the fee-reform bill
would amend the ASSU Constitu
tion to eliminate fee refunds, split
undergraduates and graduates into
two separate communities for fee
voting and collection, and cap the
total amount of fees that could be
placed on the ballot through 5-enate
approval.
The opposition's argument is
based on a section of the ASSU By
laws which requires that a sponsor
in an election can use ASSU re
sources for campaigning purposes
