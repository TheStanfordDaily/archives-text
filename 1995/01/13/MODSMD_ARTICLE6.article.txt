## Senators say COP can't use its money to fund campaign for special-fee bill 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
ASSU senators who are opposed
to the special-fee reform amend
ment say they may have found a
justification for blocking funding to
campaign for the measure.
At Tuesday's meeting, where an
overwhelming majority of senators
voted for the bill, Council of Presi
dents member Mork Murdock an
nounced that the COP would use
some of its discretionary funds to
campaign for the initiative, which
still must pass the student body
with a two-thirds majority to take
effect.
Opposing senators at the meet
ing attempted unsuccessfully to

garner support for a bill which
would have provided them match
ing funds to campaign against the
measure.
If passed, the fee-reform bill
would amend the ASSU Constitu
tion to eliminate fee refunds, split
undergraduates and graduates into
two separate communities for fee
voting and collection, and cap the
total amount of fees that could be
placed on the ballot through 5-enate
approval.
The opposition's argument is
based on a section of the ASSU By
laws which requires that a sponsor
in an election can use ASSU re
sources for campaigning purposes
only if all sponsors have "equal
access to those resources" and "such
access is announced in the [Cam
paign Practices] Code or by ruling of
the [Elections] Commission."
Undergraduate senator Steve
Russell said he feels the COP plan
to campaign for the measure meets
neither of these qualifications. "It is
absolutely inappropriate [to] use
programming funds to promote a

bill that they co-author," he said.
"That funding should be spent
on legitimate programming for the
students," he said.
Graduate senator Don Aing
worth, who along with Russell
found the provision, said he hopes
the COP will no longer consider
campaigning because of the bylaw.
"The correct way to go about it is
to point it out to them," he said. "I
assume they're not going to cheat
the rules.... My expectation is that
when we tell them they will follow
the bylaws."
The COP campaign would likely

include fliers containing information
about the proposal, Murdock said.
Members of the COP and Senate
Chair Nawwar Kasrawi did not
return phone calls last night.
Because campaigning cannot
begin until one week before the
election — which will be held over
two days starting Jan. 25 — Aing
worth said he wants time to consid
er the implications of the bylaws.
"I'm not planning to do anything
with it until the [election] handbook
goes to press," he said, adding that
he wants to read the statement by
the amendment's proponents

before planning his response.
Russell and Aingworth suggest
ed that a possible solution lies in the
bylaw provision which may allow
both proponents and opponents of
the amendment equal access to
campaign funds.
However, Russell said that if the
COP and opponents split the
money, "it shouldn't be the COP's
programming funding."
In that event, Aingworth said,
the bylaws state that elections com
missioner Jonathan Berent would
"have to give his permission and
decide how to spend the money."
