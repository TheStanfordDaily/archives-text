# Kresge address honors King, begins weekend celebration
## Speaker Dorothy Cotton commemorates life of civil rights leader 
### Crystal Carreon Contributing writer 
In 1963, Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. declared, "I have a
dream." Three decades later,
many are still hoping to keep
that dream alive for the next
generation.
In Kresge Auditorium last
night a panel of four distin
guished civil rights activists
and organizers examined
King's legacy in light of current
events in a program called
"Seizing the Torch: Our Re
sponse to a Dream Deferred."
The event was the first in a
week-long series commemorat
ing King's life and work.
"The name implies that the
dream hasn't been fully real
ized," said Blair Bowman, the
interim director of the Black
Community Services Center,
which sponsored the event.
The allusion to Langston
Hughes' poem "Dream De
ferred" is deliberate, added
BCSC Asst. Director Katrina
Youmans.
"What King was about was
non-violence. Are the youth of
today still engaged in the
dream?" she asked. "This is
what we want to find out —
where are those dreams?"
Since 1990, the BCSC has

sponsored various activities to
commemorate King's birthday.
But this year the themes and ideas
behind King seem especially signif
icant, Bowman said.
"I sense the bitterness and lack
of dialogue between many groups,"
he said. "Stanford isn't insulated
from this."

Tony Massengale, a community
organizer from Los Angeles,
stressed the development of such a
dialogue.
"In this country, we know it's
easier to just do a 'black thing' or
a 'white thing,' " he said. "Organi
zations want to bring these oppo
sites together — because as soon
as you do that, you begin to see
possibilities [for progress]. People
then lose the fear of confronting
others who are not like them
selves."

In an effort to move the dream
forward, noted civil rights activist
Dorothy Cotton, the program's
keynote speaker, spoke out against
"grossly distorting] the fantastic
struggle."
"Dead men make good heroes.
They cannot rise to challenge the
image we give them," said Cotton,
who had worked closely with King
on several civil rights projects.
"Martin was an ordinary person
who did extraordinary things on
our planet. He could amass thou

sands of people and cause them to
act," she said. "He loved people."
The commemoration of King's
birthday continues through next
week. Sunday at 7 p.m. in Memo
rial Church, prominent members
of the Stanford community,
including University President
Gerhard Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice, will participate in
the second annual "Celebration of
the Life and Legacy of Martin
Luther King," a dramatic perfor
mance.
