UW prepares to cut programs
Faced with a legislative mandate to trim $12.4
million from its budget, the University of Wash
ington is currently considering the elimination of
several departments and programs, among them
the UW School of Communications.
Along with the cuts ordered by the state legis
lature, UW is slicing another $6 million from its
own reserve fund, bringing the total cuts to over
$18 million.
In December, UW President William P. Ger
berding announced proposed cuts that included the
elimination of the Slavic Languages and Literature
Department, the Speech Communications Depart
ment and the Institute of Environmental Studies,
in addition to the School of Communications.
Several smaller programs, including applied
mathematics and radiological sciences, were also
named.
The identified programs are currently under
review by university-appointed committees who
are expected to issue reports in less than three
months. Final cuts will be announced on April 1.
Cal introduces vegan option
Estimating that 5 percent of its dorm residents
are vegans, UC-Berkeley introduced animal-free
food options into all campus dining halls Wednes
day. The move is in response to petitioning from
over 1,200 students, many of whom are non-veg

ans, reported Vegan Action, a Berkeley group.
The new meals — which include tofu kebobs
with peanut sauce and roasted eggplant — are
being hailed as an educational opportunity by
Berkeley administrators.
"We're doing it as an educational program so
that we can inform students about what a vegan
meal is," Nancy Jurich, associate director of din
ing services, told the Associated Press. "We're
taking it very seriously."
Controversy at Northwestern
An African-American candidate for a North
western Law School teaching position withdrew
her application last month after students and fac
ulty expressed worry that her legal philosophy
"would present a distorted view of the political
beliefs held by many minorities," reported The
Daily Northwestern.
According to the newspaper, many on campus
were worried that Maria O'Brien Hylton's conser
vative "law and economics" perspective would
offer a skewed perspective of what minorities
believe because two of Northwestern's three
African-American law professors also teach from
this perspective.
After a controversy that was played out on
campus and in Chicago area newspapers, Hylton
withdrew her candidacy. University officials
denied that politics played any role in the issue.
