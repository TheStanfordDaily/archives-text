Your Education?
"Working closely with faculty from the Stanford Business and Law Schools in the 18 months I've been at Cornerstone
has provided me with a very unique perspective. As an analyst, I have utilized the tools and theoretical models
developed by academics and have applied these tools directly to real-world situations, thereby seeing how these concepts
can be used in the business environment. By adding to these experiences the contact I've had with our clients, attorneys
involved in corporate litigation, I have been exposed to three very different career paths: business, law, and academia.
Additionally, by taking an active part in Cornerstone's recruiting and training efforts, I have been able to contribute to
the Firm's future. Because of my exposure to a diverse set of environments at Cornerstone, I have been able to develop a
broad skill set and to answer several questions about my own career plans."
