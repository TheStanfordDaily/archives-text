In the United States, two mtyor parties and
smaller independent groups compete for votes
and public support — a situation accepted as a
necessary part of the political process.
Whether or not the need for political parties ex
tends to student politics at Stanford, however, Is
once again up for debate.
The People's Platform, a student political
party identified with multicultural issues and stu

dent services, claims the allegiance of six of the 10
voting undergraduate seats in the ASSU Senate
as well as this year's Council of Presidents.
Although the remaining four undergraduate
senators and the 10 voting graduate senators are
independent, many question the wisdom of hav
ing one political party dominating debate in the
ASSU.
Yet that has been the situation since 1993,
when the Students First party dissolved and left-
People's Platform as the oldest established party
— active since 1986.

A need for debate
Some involved in the ASSU say the problems
with a senate made up of one political party and
unconnected independent senators have become
evident this year as People's Platform gained a co
hesive quality lacking in past years.
"I do believe that there is a strong need for an
other party, to provide an alternative forum for
developing and advocating new ideas," said un
dergraduate senator Andre Vanier.
