In the United States, two mtyor parties and
smaller independent groups compete for votes
and public support — a situation accepted as a
necessary part of the political process.
Whether or not the need for political parties ex
tends to student politics at Stanford, however, Is
once again up for debate.
The People's Platform, a student political
party identified with multicultural issues and stu

dent services, claims the allegiance of six of the 10
voting undergraduate seats in the ASSU Senate
as well as this year's Council of Presidents.
Although the remaining four undergraduate
senators and the 10 voting graduate senators are
independent, many question the wisdom of hav
ing one political party dominating debate in the
ASSU.
Yet that has been the situation since 1993,
when the Students First party dissolved and left-
People's Platform as the oldest established party
— active since 1986.

A need for debate
Some involved in the ASSU say the problems
with a senate made up of one political party and
unconnected independent senators have become
evident this year as People's Platform gained a co
hesive quality lacking in past years.
"I do believe that there is a strong need for an
other party, to provide an alternative forum for
developing and advocating new ideas," said un
dergraduate senator Andre Vanier.


Murdock
preserve the rights of students to
obtain fee refunds," added
Vanier. "They repeatedly voted
down legislative motions that
would have preserved fee-refund
rights."
The task force recommended
passage of an amendment to the
ASSU constitution which would,
among other things, abolish fee

"There needs to be a new party,
and it needs to start soon," said
Steve Russell, another under
graduate senator, who is consid
ering establishing a second party
for which he is seeking funding.
Those in favor of a new party
said its purpose would be to stir
up debate in the senate.
"Personally, I would like to see
a little more debate on issues,"
Russell said. "It's rare that we
have close votes in the senate. It
seems that either a bill passes vir
tually unanimously or it fails vir
tually unanimously. Is that the
best way to run a government?
Probably not."
The large number of one-sided
votes this year stem from the Peo
ple's Platform coalition, according
to some senators.
For example, some say debate
over the issue of special-fee
reform was limited — a problem
that began as early as the forma
tion of the initial task force, which
was loaded with individuals shar
ing the People's Platform views
on the subject.
"To my knowledge, I don't
know a vote where the People's
Platform broke ranks in voting
with each other," Russell said.
"They voted together for appoint
ing people to the special-fee task
force. ... It would have been nice
if we could have had a little diver
sity of opinion on that task
force."
"The People's Platform acted
in concert to block all efforts to

refunds, place a
cap on the total
amount of any
group's request,
and allow under
graduates and
graduates to
vote as separate
blocks on each
request. The
proposed amend-

ment will be
voted on by the student body next
week.
"The fiasco over special fees
dramatically illustrates the need
for a new party to stand up for the
rights of student, especially
undergraduates," Vanier said.
'For the good of the group'
However, members of the Peo
ple's Platform and other senate
leaders argue that their party's
existence has enhanced the work
ings of student government
rather than eliminated debate.
"There's nothing restricting
anyone else from forming coali
tions or anything else," said COP
member Mork Murdock. "I think
we've had pretty full debate over
the course of the year in the sen
ate."
Senate chair Nawwar Kasrawi,
elected as an independent, said he
sees no problem. "You've got the

People's Platform, which by no
means controls the senate, so you
don't have a party that has con
trol of the senate or ASSU," he
explained.
Despite charges that the Peo
ple's Platform has taken control
beyond what its numbers indi
cate, Kasrawi said, "I don't see
them as getting weaker or really
any stronger.
"What may have happened is
this year you have a far more
active senate and you have a Peo
ple's Platform COP, which has
been working with the senate on a
lot of issues," he continued. "That
gives the impression that there's
increasing power. I think this
year there's a COP and a senate
that are just working better
together."
Deputy senate chair Mike
Choo, a member of People's Plat
form, said the party's commit
ment to particular issues is what
has kept it active for so many
years.
"It's been around for a long
time because it's a party that has
been interested in having respon
sible people in student govern
ment," he said "They're not just a
reactionary party. That's why
other parties have come and gone
over the years.
"The People' Platform doesn't
exist because it's trying to be the
only political party," he said. "The
whole point of the People's Plat
form is to organize common inter
ests and try to be responsible, to
do research mid to govern effec
tively."
"If it seems like the People's
Platform is too powerful, it's just
because we're organized and act

ing for the good of the group."
A history of parties
The ASSU has not always been
a one-party institution. Over the
years, a number of parties —
with different names and aims —
have come and gone.
Most recently, Students First
presented the biggest challenge to

People's Platform. Founded in
1989 in response to what was
then a one-party system, Stu
dents First — charging that the
Platform's multicultural focus
didn't adequately represent the
student body — ended a string of
People's Platform COP victories
in 1991.
In 1990, a third political party
formed because of dissatisfaction
with both of the established par
ties. The Stanford Unity Party
was created as a "common
ground" between the other par
ties, its members said.
And the Stanford Chapparal
has been a consistent contributor
to campus politics, running a usu
ally humorous Hammer and Cof
fin party COP slate almost annu
ally.
But none of the other serious
parties have had the same
longevity as People's Platform.

Students First was "formed as an
opposition party and did not know
how to stay together once they
had control," said graduate sena
tor Marc Oppenheimer. "Stu
dents First died after they
achieved power."
Now, without Students First,
the People's Platform is once
again the lone party represented

'The fiasco over special fees dramatically
illustrates the need for a new party to stand
up for the rights of student, especially under
graduates.'
— Andre Vanier

in the senate.
Working together
Doug Bone, a graduate student
who was an ASSU senator when
both People's Platform and Stu
dents First were active parties,
questioned the wisdom of having
any political parties.
"When I was involved in it,
there was a two-party atmo
sphere," he said. "I don't think
the situation at Stanford before
was particularly healthy for stu
dent government. . . . When I
was in the senate, it was pretty
lopsided, and it was very discour
aging."
"Student politics may very well
be better off without political par
ties," he said, "but once a political
party forms, it's often useful to
have students with different
views coming together. . . . Ideal
ly, you'd want student govern

ment to be non-partisan. If that
model is going to work, it would
be fine, but if that model is going
to stop working, one is probably
better off with competing views
being articulated."
However, many current ASSU
politicians say the see value in
political parties.
"I think it's important to have
political parties because other
wise everyone is just out on their
own, and it's hard to bring major
efforts together," Murdock said.
"If people just come in with their
own individual plans or agendas
... it's hard for one person to
really effect change."
With the current system, Mur
dock said, "People come in with
their own plans and ambitions,
but we try to work together and
support each other."
"A lot of people will come into
student government and they'll
be overwhelmed with the struc
ture," Choo said. "Political par
ties help people unite. They help
people convert their interests into
getting things done."
He added, however, that the
members of the People's Platform
have had to work with other
members of the senate to get their
legislation passed.
"If you look at a lot of bills and
amendments that were passed
this year, they were passed with
super-majorities. The People's
Platform has only six votes out of
20 voting positions," Choo said.
"The platform itself doesn't even
have one-third of the votes to
push through legislation.
"I like to think it's passing
because it's good public policy,"
he added.

The large number of one-sided
votes this year stem from the Peo
ple's Platform coalition, according
to some senators.
For example, some say debate
over the issue of special-fee
reform was limited — a problem
that began as early as the forma
tion of the initial task force, which
was loaded with individuals shar
ing the People's Platform views
on the subject.
"To my knowledge, I don't
know a vote where the People's
Platform broke ranks in voting
with each other," Russell said.
"They voted together for appoint
ing people to the special-fee task
force. ... It would have been nice
if we could have had a little diver
sity of opinion on that task
force."
"The People's Platform acted
in concert to block all efforts to

refunds, place a
cap on the total
amount of any
group's request,
and allow under
graduates and
graduates to
vote as separate
blocks on each
request. The
proposed amend-

ment will be
voted on by the student body next
week.
"The fiasco over special fees
dramatically illustrates the need
for a new party to stand up for the
rights of student, especially
undergraduates," Vanier said.
'For the good of the group'
However, members of the Peo
ple's Platform and other senate
leaders argue that their party's
existence has enhanced the work
ings of student government
rather than eliminated debate.
"There's nothing restricting
anyone else from forming coali
tions or anything else," said COP
member Mork Murdock. "I think
we've had pretty full debate over
the course of the year in the sen
ate."
Senate chair Nawwar Kasrawi,
elected as an independent, said he
sees no problem. "You've got the

People's Platform, which by no
means controls the senate, so you
don't have a party that has con
trol of the senate or ASSU," he
explained.
Despite charges that the Peo
ple's Platform has taken control
beyond what its numbers indi
cate, Kasrawi said, "I don't see
them as getting weaker or really
any stronger.
"What may have happened is
this year you have a far more
active senate and you have a Peo
ple's Platform COP, which has
been working with the senate on a
lot of issues," he continued. "That
gives the impression that there's
increasing power. I think this
year there's a COP and a senate
that are just working better
together."
Deputy senate chair Mike
Choo, a member of People's Plat
form, said the party's commit
ment to particular issues is what
has kept it active for so many
years.
"It's been around for a long
time because it's a party that has
been interested in having respon
sible people in student govern
ment," he said "They're not just a
reactionary party. That's why
other parties have come and gone
over the years.
"The People' Platform doesn't
exist because it's trying to be the
only political party," he said. "The
whole point of the People's Plat
form is to organize common inter
ests and try to be responsible, to
do research mid to govern effec
tively."
"If it seems like the People's
Platform is too powerful, it's just
because we're organized and act

ing for the good of the group."
A history of parties
The ASSU has not always been
a one-party institution. Over the
years, a number of parties —
with different names and aims —
have come and gone.
Most recently, Students First
presented the biggest challenge to

People's Platform. Founded in
1989 in response to what was
then a one-party system, Stu
dents First — charging that the
Platform's multicultural focus
didn't adequately represent the
student body — ended a string of
People's Platform COP victories
in 1991.
In 1990, a third political party
formed because of dissatisfaction
with both of the established par
ties. The Stanford Unity Party
was created as a "common
ground" between the other par
ties, its members said.
And the Stanford Chapparal
has been a consistent contributor
to campus politics, running a usu
ally humorous Hammer and Cof
fin party COP slate almost annu
ally.
But none of the other serious
parties have had the same
longevity as People's Platform.

Students First was "formed as an
opposition party and did not know
how to stay together once they
had control," said graduate sena
tor Marc Oppenheimer. "Stu
dents First died after they
achieved power."
Now, without Students First,
the People's Platform is once
again the lone party represented

'The fiasco over special fees dramatically
illustrates the need for a new party to stand
up for the rights of student, especially under
graduates.'

in the senate.
Working together
Doug Bone, a graduate student
who was an ASSU senator when
both People's Platform and Stu
dents First were active parties,
questioned the wisdom of having
any political parties.
"When I was involved in it,
there was a two-party atmo
sphere," he said. "I don't think
the situation at Stanford before
was particularly healthy for stu
dent government. . . . When I
was in the senate, it was pretty
lopsided, and it was very discour
aging."
"Student politics may very well
be better off without political par
ties," he said, "but once a political
party forms, it's often useful to
have students with different
views coming together. . . . Ideal
ly, you'd want student govern

ment to be non-partisan. If that
model is going to work, it would
be fine, but if that model is going
to stop working, one is probably
better off with competing views
being articulated."
However, many current ASSU
politicians say the see value in
political parties.
"I think it's important to have
political parties because other
wise everyone is just out on their
own, and it's hard to bring major
efforts together," Murdock said.
"If people just come in with their
own individual plans or agendas
... it's hard for one person to
really effect change."
With the current system, Mur
dock said, "People come in with
their own plans and ambitions,
but we try to work together and
support each other."
"A lot of people will come into
student government and they'll
be overwhelmed with the struc
ture," Choo said. "Political par
ties help people unite. They help
people convert their interests into
getting things done."
He added, however, that the
members of the People's Platform
have had to work with other
members of the senate to get their
legislation passed.
"If you look at a lot of bills and
amendments that were passed
this year, they were passed with
super-majorities. The People's
Platform has only six votes out of
20 voting positions," Choo said.
"The platform itself doesn't even
have one-third of the votes to
push through legislation.
"I like to think it's passing
because it's good public policy,"
he added.

In the United States, two mtyor parties and
smaller independent groups compete for votes
and public support — a situation accepted as a
necessary part of the political process.
Whether or not the need for political parties ex
tends to student politics at Stanford, however, Is
once again up for debate.
The People's Platform, a student political
party identified with multicultural issues and stu

dent services, claims the allegiance of six of the 10
voting undergraduate seats in the ASSU Senate
as well as this year's Council of Presidents.
Although the remaining four undergraduate
senators and the 10 voting graduate senators are
independent, many question the wisdom of hav
ing one political party dominating debate in the
ASSU.
Yet that has been the situation since 1993,
when the Students First party dissolved and left-
People's Platform as the oldest established party
— active since 1986.

A need for debate
Some involved in the ASSU say the problems
with a senate made up of one political party and
unconnected independent senators have become
evident this year as People's Platform gained a co
hesive quality lacking in past years.
"I do believe that there is a strong need for an
other party, to provide an alternative forum for
developing and advocating new ideas," said un
dergraduate senator Andre Vanier.


Murdock
preserve the rights of students to
obtain fee refunds," added
Vanier. "They repeatedly voted
down legislative motions that
would have preserved fee-refund
rights."
The task force recommended
passage of an amendment to the
ASSU constitution which would,
among other things, abolish fee

"There needs to be a new party,
and it needs to start soon," said
Steve Russell, another under
graduate senator, who is consid
ering establishing a second party
for which he is seeking funding.
Those in favor of a new party
said its purpose would be to stir
up debate in the senate.
"Personally, I would like to see
a little more debate on issues,"
Russell said. "It's rare that we
have close votes in the senate. It
seems that either a bill passes vir
tually unanimously or it fails vir
tually unanimously. Is that the
best way to run a government?
Probably not."
