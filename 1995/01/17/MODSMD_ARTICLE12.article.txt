Death penalty sought
UNION, S.C. (AP) - In the end,
Susan V. Smith's prosecutor said yester
day, he had to seek the death penalty
against her to assure that people
remembered the two young sons she
drowned were the victims and not her.
Mrs. Smith sobbed and spectators in
the packed courtroom gasped as Solici
tor Tommy Pope said he would seek to
have her electrocuted if she is convicted
of murder. She covered her face and
cried as Pope read aloud the charges
that she rolled her car into John D. Long
Lake with her sons, 3-year-old Michael
and 14-month-old Alex, inside.
Mrs. Smith's lawyer, David Bruck,
said she would not enter a plea. Circuit
Judge Costa Pleicones entered an inno

cent plea on her behalf and scheduled
her trial for April 24.
Stroke deaths rise
SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) - Doc
tors may be losing the battle to control
high blood pressure, as stroke deaths
begin to rise after a 20-year decline, a
study shows.
Dr. Russell Luepker of the University
of Minnesota said the disturbing trend
could be explained by a drop he found in
the use of blood pressure medication.
Luepker tracked three groups of 4,000
to 7,000 people since 1980 and found that
while the national campaign to control
high blood pressure produced a dramatic
drop in deaths during the past two
decades, the curve appears to be turning
upward.
