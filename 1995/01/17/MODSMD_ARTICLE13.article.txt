### 
TOKYO (AP) — A powerful
predawn earthquake slammed west
ern Japan today, reportedly killing at
least 38 people, injuring hundreds and
leaving hundreds more trapped in the
rubble of collapsed buildings.
The earthquake, with a preliminary
magnitude of 7.2, was believed the
most violent to have struck a densely
populated urban area in Japan in at
least two decades.
The quake sparked fires through
out the major port city of Kobe, 280
miles west of Tokyo, where the quake
was barely felt. It was felt strongly in
Osaka, Japan's second-largest city,
about 22 miles east of Kobe.
Japan's public television, NHK,
reported 38 deaths, but the toll was
expected to climb.

Up to 200 people were belived
buried in rubble in the western city of
Ashiya, a posh residential area near
Osaka, NHK reported.
In Kobe, a portion of elevated
expressway collapsed, and a major fire
was raging near the city center in
Kobe. Smoke billowed over large sec
tions of the city.
Deaths were also reported on Awaji
Island, located in the Inland Sea off
Kobe and epicenter of the 5:46 a.m.
(3:46 p.m. EST yesterday) earth
quake.
Japan is one of the world's most
seismically active areas, but this
quake's destructiveness shocked even
Japanese rescue officials.
"I've never felt such a large earth
quake before," said Takeshi Sakamo

to, head of rescue operations on Awaji
Island, where the quake was centered.
The Cabinet was to hold an emer
gency meeting to discuss disaster
measures. Stock trading was suspend
ed for the morning on the exchange in
Osaka, about 22 miles east of Kobe.
More than a dozen aftershocks rat
tled the area in the three hours fol
lowing the quake. More aftershocks
were expected, adding to fire danger
from broken gas mains.
Trains were derailed by the force of
the quake. Power was knocked out in
some areas and underground pipes
burst, sending water gurgling onto
streets.
People huddled in the streets,
wrapped in bedding, some bleeding
from cuts and scrapes.
