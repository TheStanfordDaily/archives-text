## Separation of duties

FOR THE FIRST time last
week, the Faculty Senate
steering committee con
vened in an administrative session
to conduct routine business.
In the past, noncontroversial
matters like committee reports,
graduation lists and department
renewals were discussed before
the full senate. Such tasks could
quickly gobble up valuable senate
time — and the time of senate
members, who, it must be remem
bered, also have to juggle teaching
and research obligations.
Now, however, such matters will
be discussed and voted on only by
the senate's nine-member steering
committee in monthly administra
tive sessions.
This reform should help revital
ize the Faculty Senate and allow
the full senate to concentrate its
efforts on thoughtful discussion of
important issues facing the Uni

versity. While there are no guaran
tees that the senate will instantly
become a model of legislative effi
ciency, this reform can only help.
There is little danger of the
steering committee using adminis
trative sessions to push controver
sial business past the full senate,
thanks to several important safe
guards built into the arrangement.
For instance, at the request of
five elected senators, an item
planned for discussion by the
steering committee can be dis
cussed at a regular senate meeting
instead. And five elected senators
can appeal any decisions made in
administrative session.
Faculty Senate meetings will
undoubtedly run more quickly and
more smoothly under this new
arrangement. With luck, the
increased efficiency might even
motivate some disenchanted sena
tors to become more involved.
