# Rebuilding the Bridge
## 
### 
Although Stanford
boasts a laid-back reputa
tion in comparison with
other top American universities,
anyone who has spent time on
the Farm knows that students
here are not exempt from the
pressures and difficulties associ
ated with the college experience.
It is good news, then, that the
University has permitted the
Bridge — Stanford's 24-hour
peer counseling center — to keep
their two buildings, despite
structural problems which will
require significant repairs in the
future.
After conducting a study earli
er this year, University officials
warned Bridge counselors that
they were considering taking the
damaged buildings under Uni
versity control. The original
thought was that the Bridge
would be repaired with Universi
ty funds and transformed into a
residence hall or a counseling

theme dorm.
However, since then the Uni
versity has correctly recognized
that the Bridge provides an
important service to the Stanford
community — 24-hour help for
those who seek it — which would
be jeopardized by any arrange
ment other than the present one.
Consequently, administrators
have announced that money
which falls under the jurisdiction
of Vice Provost and Dean for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds will
be set aside to aid the Bridge as
repairs begin.
Although Stanford continues
to feel the effects of budget cuts,
this decision is surely a sound
one considering the hundreds of
students who benefit annually
from the Bridge's services. As the
University continues to look into
the potential cost of repairs, stu
dents can rest assured that the
Bridge will not come tumbling
down.
