Welfare a necessary safety net for mothers and children

According to Adam Ross,
"almost everyone now agrees" that
"our welfare system ... is an utter
and abject failure" (Daily, Jan. 13).
Almost everyone? Surely not the Stan
ford student I know who maintains an
outstanding academic record and whose
family could not have survived without
welfare. Nor could Ross have talked to
Lynn Woolsey, member of Congress from
Sonoma, who 25 years ago found herself
a single mother with three young chil
dren and turned to welfare until she
could manage to provide for them her
self. Not everyone is unaware of the fact
that emergencies can happen to any fam
ily and that for some people welfare is
the only available safety net.
Nevertheless, Republican leaders in
recent years have tried to convince us
that those who receive Aid to Families
with Dependent Children (AFDC) are
either "welfare queens" who breed chil
dren in order to collect more money or
black teenagers on crack. In fact, most
welfare recipients are white, stay on wel
fare for relatively short periods and have
no more than two children. More sophis
ticated critics claim that welfare encour
ages dependency. But an average month

ly payment of $336 to a mother of two
children is not much of a lure to remain
on the dole if the recipient has any other
choice.
A far more likely reason for the grow
ing welfare rolls is that with a typical
unemployment rate in this country of at
least six percent, not everyone who seeks
a job can find one. As jobs for relatively
unskilled people disappear, women with
children who are laid off or who get
divorced and don't receive child support
often have nowhere else to turn. The sad
fact is that the main beneficiaries of wel
fare are children. If benefits are cut, they
will go hungry and could even become
homeless.
Our society suffers from a great many
ills: violent crime, poor schools, inade
quate housing, broken families and alien
ated young people. These problems can
be at least partly ascribed to the vast eco
nomic changes that have transformed
the job market in recent years and con
tributed to the growing disparity of
wealth. Since 1979, family income for
the top quintile, the wealthiest 20 per
cent, has increased by 18 percent while
the income of the bottom quintile, the
poorest 20 percent, has decreased by 17

percent. In other words, the problem
isn't welfare, as rightwingers claim, but
the fact that poor people are getting
poorer and our society has done nothing
to stop the trend. Welfare payments are
the one small life preserver — provided
at a cost of 1.1 percent of the federal
budget — that we hold out to women
and children in need.
What we are currently witnessing is
the seeming victory not of conservatism,
as Adam Ross suggests, but of a politics
of selfishness designed to serve the inter
ests of the wealthy and powerful at the
expense of the poor. As Republicans in
Congress act to protect subsidies for cat
tle growers and mining companies while
preparing to cut assistance to severely
disabled children, Governor Wilson urges
tax relief for the rich and cuts in aid to
the elderly blind and disabled. It should
be unnecessary to add that the poor and
disabled aren't likely to vote or con
tribute to election campaigns.
Despite the rightwing's current
euphoria, however, Ross is wrong to
assume that most Americans share their
values. On Dec. 8, the San Francisco
Chronicle reported on a study by the
Center for the Study of Policy Attitudes

that found that 80 percent of those ques
tioned believe society has a "moral obli
gation" to help the poor and that the
government should do something about
poverty. When respondents were asked
how much they think a single mother
with two children receives in welfare
payments, the average answer was $685
a month, nearly twice as much as what
she actually gets.
Welfare is surely not a solution to
poverty. Without provisions for educa
tion, child care and the opportunity to
find a job, it is inadequate even as a
method of providing assistance. But the
real problem in this country is not wel
fare but the lack of desire on the part of
our leaders and those who finance their
elections to make this a more equitable
society. Otherwise we will slowly but
surely come to resemble those Third
World countries where multimillionaires
enjoy their wealth behind high walls
while a majority of the population lives
in squalor. Given the principles on which
our country was founded, true conserva
tives would do everything in their power
to keep this from happening.
