## Confronting career choices 
### 
WALKING AROUND CAMPUS
late one night last week, I met a
woman who warmly introduced
herself as a physician here at Stanford.
Probably because I volunteered that I was
a medical student myself, she felt com
pelled to launch into a rambling condem
nation of the medical profession. Underly
ing her frantic speech was the basic chal
lenge, "Why would anyone in their right
mind go into medicine today?" I occasion
ally attempted to interject my opinion
(clearly less damning than hers), but she
either heard or understood very little of it.
Eventually I pulled myself away and
peeked at my watch, frustrated that I had
endured her diatribe for so long when I
had an extensive list of things to do.
Why would this event weigh so heavily
on my mind that I would ultimately
devote an entire column to it? First, it
symbolized what I see as a disturbing
trend of dissatisfaction among profession
als today, especially among those in
medicine. More importantly, however, it
implied that I entered the medical profes
sion ignorant of this trend, and therefore
have doomed myself to unhappiness. I
resented such a suggestion, however
unintended on her part. I had heard her
critique of the medical establishment —
or some derivative of it — several times
before, and its significance was not
ignored in my decision to follow this
career path. Instead, I had decided that I
would work within the system to follow
my dreams, understanding that great

challenges would present themselves
along the way.
It should be clear that almost any
career option carries certain connota
tions, some good and some bad, relating
to the character and lifestyle of that pro
fession. Lawyers, for example, have often
been stereotyped as fee-driven and uneth
ical. Clearly a generalization, this offends
the upright and hard-working attorney
who doesn't fit this mold. Medicine is
undergoing a revolution which threatens
the respect for its practitioners as well. As
insurance companies tighten budgets and
the doctor-patient relationship is
strained, doctors clearly face a challenge
in upholding their privileged status.
Those who have foreseen it and planned
accordingly will weather the challenge,
and others who cling to the past will be
greatly disappointed.
A poignant example of this need for
foresight is reflected in the trend toward
decreasing physician salaries and increas
ing student loans. It is comical, in a dis
turbing sense, to observe physicians (and
other professionals) who complain about
their "low" (i.e. under $100,000) yearly
income. Believe me, growing up with a
health professional as a father, combined
with my current training, has left me any
thing but naive to the intensity and dedi
cation required for such a career. Instead,
it has made me realize that if I had want
ed to make a lot of money quickly — as
opposed to having the privilege of respon
sibility for someone's health — I would

have gone into investment banking.
Another common complaint is that
insurance companies have become too
intrusive and meddlesome in doctor
patient affairs. That's somewhat true, but
it's also true that health care costs have
been rising astronomically, in part
because doctors have been operating vir
tually unchecked for so many years.
Medicine may not offer the autonomy
that it used to, but it still offers more than
almost any other field.
Of course, those are just two examples
regarding medicine that don't concern the
majority of you. The point, however, is
that a decision to enter the changing
world of medicine, law or whatever field
fuels your passion, need not be a surren
der to the nightmarish stories circulated
therein. Instead, it Ls a free choice that we
should make with open eyes, and having
done so, we should stop complaining as if
we are powerless cogs in a wheel that has
appropriated us unknowingly. It is impor
tant to set one's expectations neither too
high nor too low, and to be prepared for
the changes which any field must undergo
periodically. Just being at Stanford is an
experience which presents opportunities
unknown to most students worldwide. It
is our responsibility to choose wisely
amont; them.
