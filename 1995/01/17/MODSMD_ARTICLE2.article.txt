# Two arrested for murder of grad student
## Motive was robbery, police say 
### Ben Sussman Contributing writer 
After nearly two months of investigation, Palo
Alto police now say that they have arrested two men
in connection with the Nov. 13 robbery and murder of
Stanford graduate student David Liu.
Working as a part of a multi-agency law enforce
ment task force, Palo Alto police arrested Larry
"Moon" Paul, 20, and Eddy Pereles, 22, both of East
Palo Alto, last week.
According to Palo Alto Police Sgt. Dennis Burns,
investigators used information gathered from other
local robberies to focus on the two suspects.
"We had suspected [Paul and Pereles] for some
time, based on several previous robberies," he said.
Robbery, it appeared, was the only motive for the
killing, Burns added.
Paul was charged with robbery and homicide in the
case, while Pereles, whom police believe was Paul's ac
complice, is being held on charges in connection with
four other San Mateo County robberies.
Burns said that both suspects may be linked to
those robberies, and that there is "an outside chance"
that they may have been involved in other Mountain
View robberies.
Despite the arrests, however, other aspects of the
case remain unsolved, specifically locating the murder
weapon.
Burns said that information gathered from the
suspects indicated that they used a .22-caliber rifle,
possibly with a sawed-ofTbarrel and stock. Police have
offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the
rifle.
Liu, 23, graduated with honors from Cornell Uni
versity in 1992 and was pursuing a master's degree in
product design from the Department of Mechanical
Engineering.
At the time of his death, he was
on an academic leave of absence
while completing the work experi
ence requirement for his degree.
On Nov. 13, around 7 p.m., two
assailants attacked Liu as he
stepped out of his car near a
friend's Palo Alto apartment. The
men then beat and robbed Liu
before shooting him in the back.
Shortly afterward, said Burns,
Palo Alto police investigators began
consulting with other local law
enforcement agencies, attempting
to gather information relevant to
the case.

In December, a formal task force
was organized, including detectives
from Palo Alto, East Palo Alto, and
the San Mateo County Sheriff's
department, as well as several state
and federal law enforcement agen
cies.
The combination of assets
apparently allowed police to recog
nize the similarities in this and
other robberies.
"We had assets and personnel
from [several] jurisdictions,"
Burns explained, adding that the
task force was essential in leading
to the arrests.
Liu's parents, Ying and
Josephine Liu, have set up a
memorial fund in their son's
name. Contributions can be made
through the School of Engineer
ing.
