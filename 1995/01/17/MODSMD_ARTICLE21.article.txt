Stanford men's basketball head
coach Mike Montgomery summed up
the night in three words: "Too much
Stoudamire."
Montgomery would be, of course,
referring to Arizona Wildcat guard
Damon Stoudamire who lit up the Car
dinal for a career-high 45 points en
route to a 89-83 overtime Arizona (12-3
overall, 2-1 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) victory Saturday night.
Stoudamire'B 45 set a Maples Pavil
ion record, but entering the game, the
Cardinal (11-2 overall, 2-2 Pac-10) had
a different mark it was trying to break
— Arizona's 13-game consecutive win
streak against Stanford. Unfortunately
this would not be the case.
In front of a capacity crowd of 7,500
screaming fans, Stanford jumped out to
a seven-point 10-3 lead less than four
minutes into the start of the game,
seemingly primed to oust the then
13th-ranked Wildcats.
The Cardinal defense flustered
Stoudamire early on, forcing several
turnovers, but the Wildcat senior
wouldn't let any of that get in the way
of his long-bomb exhibition. Arizona,
living up to their billing, put a 19-6 run
together, fueled by three three-pointers
from Stoudamire including one from
NBA-range, to go up by six .
"I tried to do what I could just to try
to catch him off guard here and there,

but he was just hot," said Cardinal
guard Brevin Knight. "As long as he
was standing two or three steps behind
the line knocking the jumpers, there's
not too much I can do. That's why they
call him the best in the country. He
proved it tonight."
With some gritty defense, Stanford
battled back and took a 40-38 lead at
halftime. Cardinal guard Dion Cross
shot valiantly in the first half with 18
points off of seven-of-eight shooting but
was still behind Stoudamire's 23 first
half points, which included five three
pointers.
There was no let up in the second
half from Stoudamire either. Cardinal
center Bart Lammersen's layup gave
Stanford an 11-point lead with 10 min
utes, 52 seconds remaining, but with
Stoudamire's hot hand that wasn't
enough. He scored nine points and
dished out four assists in a 24-6 Wild
cat run which put Stanford down by
seven.
"He's some kind of player," Mont
gomery said. "Every time they needed a
bucket, they got one for him. I've never
had a player get 45 before. He's some
thing. He just really took it upon him
self to make the plays."
Things appeared grim for the cardi
nal and white, but Knight scored six
points in the last four minutes to tie the
game up with 40 seconds to go.
"A lot of people thought that we
were going to fold when we got down
seven, but we're not going to flow,"
Knight said. "We're going to play
together and we're going to pull out
some games."
The ball was once again in
Stoudamire's hands as the seconds
ticked down. The Wildcat drove down
the lane but had his shot sent back by
Lammersen. With time running out in

regulation, CroBS let loose a three
pointer that clanked off the rim.
"It was off when it went off my
hand," Cross said. "I was hoping it
would curve."
The Cardinal hopes were not dead
yet, as Lammersen grabbed the miss
and attempted the game-winning lay
in. The put-back rolled out though, and
it was into overtime.
"You got your best shooter pretty
much coming on the floor on the move,
and getting a pretty good look," Mont
gomery said. "It's as good an opportu
nity as you're going to get in most
cases. And we even got the blessing of a
second opportunity, a put-back, and
neither went. You don't want to give a
team like Arizona a second chance. We
did, and they took advantage of it."
Playing without starters Knight and
center Tim Young for most of overtime,
Stanford was outscored 7-13.
"The times that it may have seemed
we were beat and really kind of strug
gling, Brevin made some awful big
plays in the second half to get us on
our feet again," Montgomery said.
"The question of losing him is a factor
just in terms of creating opportuni
ties."-
The Damon Stoudamire Show
picked up where it left off as the guard
from Tucson racked up eight more
points in overtime, one more than the
entire Cardinal team.
"I had to do what I had to do,"
Stoudamire said. "I just wanted to be in
attack mode from the start to the fin
ish. A lot of good things happened for
us, and we were lucky to escape with
this victory."
So once again, Stanford was unable
to scale Mount Wildcats, suffering its
