# Stoudamire 'too much' for Cardinal
## 
### Jason Weintraub 
Before Saturday night's game
against the University of Arizona,
Stanford point guard Brevin Knight
was asked what the Cardinal would
have to do in order to defeat the 13 th
ranked Wildcats. "With Arizona,"
Knight responded, "you stop Damon
Stoudamire, you stop Arizona."
During Saturday's game,
Stoudamire scored 45 points. As Knight
predicted, Stanford lost, despite outre
bounding and outhustling the bigger,
more talented Wildcats.
Early in the game, Stanford enjoyed
success with a tight, man-to-man
defense that matched Brevin Knight
against Stoudamire. Knight forced the
Arizona superstar to commit three
turnovers in the game's first five min
utes, while holding him scoreless until
15 minutes, 55 seconds remained in the
first half. At this point, however,

Stoudamire began to take what Stan
ford's defense gave him. Unable to pen
etrate, Stoudamire pulled up and
drained two 23-foot three pointers.
Those shots began a pattern in
which, according to an exasperated
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery,
"every time they needed a basket, he
got them one."
At the halfway point of the first
half, Stoudamire nailed a three-point
er to put Arizona ahead, 22-16. Stan
ford methodically came back behind
the outside shooting of Dion Cross.
No more than 13 seconds after Cross
tied the game with a three-pointer,
however, Stoudamire put the Wild
cats ahead with a trey of his own.
Every time Stanford attempted to
extend a lead, Stoudamire would hit a
jumper to keep his team close, and
Stanford led by just two at the half
thanks to his three-pointer with six
seconds left.

"Our team needed a boost, and I was
feeling it from the offensive end,"
Stoudamire said.
Stanford faced more of the same in
the second half, as it became apparent
that Stoudamire was doing even more
damage than accounting for over half of
his team's offensive production. First,
his ability to drive to the basket put
Stanford in foul trouble throughout the
game. Stanford center Tim Young
fouled out with over three minutes left
in regulation, and Brevin Knight, in a
devastating loss to the Cardinal, fouled
out with 4:13 left in overtime.
Second, Stoudamire's long jumpers
and unrelenting penetration took the
raucous Maples Pavilion crowd out of
the game on several occasions. It
seemed that with each three-pointer,
the Stanford faithful groaned and fell
silent.
Arizona head coach Lute
Olsen, when asked about hit

star's play, simply said, "Damon's
Damon. We know who our guy
is." Olsen also pointed out that
Stoudamire played much of the
second half in pain after aggra
vating an ankle sprain suffered a
couple of weeks ago.

Brevin Knight was more can
did, calling Stoudamire the best
he's ever played against. "There's
nothing you can do," Knight said.
"I'd have my hand in his face, and
he'd shoot over me. Straight up
and straight in."
