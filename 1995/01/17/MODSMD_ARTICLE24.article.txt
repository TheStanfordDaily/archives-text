Anita," said Stanford coach Tara
VanDerveer. "They got her the
ball inside and she did a good job
of finishing."
Kaplan scored her points in
only 24 minutes, making nine of
her 12 shots.
"The team looked inside and I
got a lot of good passes," Kaplan
said. Another key to her high
field goal percentage, however,
was her height. "Arizona really
didn't have anyone as tall as I
am," she added.

The Stanford women's bas
ketball team continues to roll, as
the fifth-ranked Cardinal (13-1,
4-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
dominated Arizona (7-8, 2-1) en
route to a 86-51 thrashing on
Saturday. The margin brought
the number of 20 point victories
to eight and more are certain to
be on the way.
Senior center Anita Kaplan
and sophomore Kate Starbird
led the team with 18 and 17
points respectively.
"The last few games we
son-long tradition of sparking the
team. Arizona pulled to within 12
with 14 minutes, four seconds to go
in the second half when Starbird
began the 17-3 run that put the
Wildcats away for good.
"Kate turned the game around
when she made a steal and hit a cou
ple of threes," said VanDerveer.
Freshmen Kristen Folkl and
Naomi Mulitauaopele aided Star
bird as the three standouts com
bined for 13 of the points that put
the Cardinal ahead 66-40.
Folkl made good use of her limit
ed minutes. After scoring a career
high 15 points against Arizona
State on Thursday, she followed up
by scoring 12 and dishing out four
assists in only 18 minutes.
"Kristen has been playing
great," VanDerveer said. "She's
making a great contribution to the
team despite not practicing very
much."
Freshman Olympia Scott also
proved to be potent in her 15 min
utes of game time. She scored eight
points and led the team with seven
rebounds. Freshman Heather
Owen added 10 points and five
rebounds in 13 minutes.
Stanford rolled to its 17th
straight victory over Arizona by
running out to a 38-22 lead at half
time, making over 45 percent of its
shots.
"Even if we lead at halftime by
15 or 20, we don't rest," said
"Kaplan. "We want to always contin
ue building on the lead."
The second half proved to be bet
ter as the Cardinal outscored the
Wildcats 48-29, making 18-28 from
the floor, a 64.3 percent clip.
Arizona was led by guard Brenda
Pantoja and forward Aida Barnes.
Pantoja scored 21 and assisted
three other times while Pantoja
scored 20 iind grabbed 5 rebounds.
Despite the impressive victories
this season, the team still feels that
it can get better.
"We're practicing well together
but we still have room for improve
ment," Kaplan said. "We were dis-
in our defense in the first
half against Arizona State. [Against
Arizona! everyone on the team
played well."
VanDerveer believes there are
other areas where Stanford needs
work. "People are looking to pass
the biill inside and that's been work

ing," VanDerveer said. "But we need
our perimeter game to step up."
Injuries continue to hamper two
starters from last year's team.
Senior Rachel I lemmer and sopho
more Jamila Wideman have seen
their minutes drastically cut from
last year due to nagging foot and leg
injuries. Hemmer has been averag
ing only 12.7 minutes while Wide
man missed the came due to food

poisoning.
Wideman should recover in time
for the nationally televised game on
Friday. California invades Maples
Pavilion in a game that will be cov
ered by ESPN.
"They have some excellent play
ers from the outside," said Van-
Derveer. "We always have exciting
games against Cal and it should be a
test of our perimeter game."
