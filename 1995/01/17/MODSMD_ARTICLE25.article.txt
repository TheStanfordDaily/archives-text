# Talent isn't the only worry of a scholar-athlete
## 
### 
MIDDLE OF January. By
now, many high school
seniors have completed
their college applications and have
begun the three-month process of
nervously awaiting for replies.
Among these anxious hopefuls
are hosts of scholar-athletes, count
ing on their physical talents to help
them get into some of the country's
highest caliber institutions. They
are all-city, all-state, all-American
and even international level per
formers, and most will weigh their
possibility of admission in relation
to these achievements.
However, it has recently been

brought to my attention that some
applicants, despite establishing
themselves as stars in their respec
tive sports, are concerned with
another factor. In these times of
supposedly higher multicultural

consciousness, it didn't surprise me
to discover that some students fear
racial or cultural stereotype.
How does any stereotype affect
the ability of an athlete to con
tribute to a sport? Although there
exist some rather prevalent and
hurtful ideas — that, for instance,
African Americans shine on the
hard floor while one would want to
feature Caucasians in sports that
are traditionally associated with
wealth — perhaps this is not the
right question to ask.
To give an example, I learned
from an Asian friend of mine that
he was not so much concerned

about his accomplishments as a
member of the U.S. Junior Olympic
Judo Team as he was about how
admissions committees might see
him as just another "typical" Asian
candidate who excels in martial
arts. He appeared to have had solid
grounds for his worries, as he noted
that a good number of his Asian
martial arts friends in the past had
failed to get into schools such as
Stanford, although they seemed to
display the necessary credentials in
terms of interview skills, personal
character, ability to write essays,
