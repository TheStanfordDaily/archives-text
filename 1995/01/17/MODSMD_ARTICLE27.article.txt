# Surprisingly close shave Women swimmers squeak by Michigan
## 
### John Lawson Contributing writer 
The top-ranked Stanford
women's swimming and div
ing team ran its dual meet
winning streak to 45 on Sat
urday at deGuerre Pool with a
victory over the second
ranked Michigan Wolverines,
but not without the biggest
scare in head coach Richard
Quick's seven years on the
Farm.
With the losses of senior
Mary Ellen Blanchard, junior
Allison Higson, and sopho
more Kerry O'Hanlon to
injury, and with the rest of
the team exhausted from gru
eling 20,000-yard per day
workouts, Quick knew that
the team would not be in tip
top form.
But he did not envision the

Cardinal trailing the Wolver
ines 142-137 entering the final
event of the afternoon. Stan
ford, said senior co-captain
Becky Crowe, showed its "true
grit" in the all-important 400-
yard freestyle relay by placing
first and third and squeaking
by with a 150-146 win.
"We knew that it was not
going to be a cakewalk by any
means," Quick said. "Michi
gan matches up well with us
in dual meets, and this year's
Wolverine team swam excep
tionally well. They sure gave
us a scare, and I was happy we
came away with a victory."
Individually for Stanford,
senior Jenny Thompson took
first place in the 100-yard free
and the 100-yard butterfly,
while anchoring two winning
relay teams. Sophomore Clau
dia Franco took top honors in

the 50-yard free.
Despite these Btunning
individual performances, the
team came together as a
whole. "It was a team effort,
plain and simple," Quick said.
"Each swimmer did her part
to achieve the win. I was very
proud of the way the team
came together to pull it out."
Michigan kept the Cardinal
on its toes with outstanding
performances by Alecia
Humphrey, winner of the 100-
yard and 200-yard back
strokes, Lisa Butzlaff, victor
in the 100-yard and 200-yard
breaststrokes and Carrie
Zarse, who out-dueled Stan
ford All-American Eileen
Richetelli to win the one
meter and three-meter diving.
"This was a good wake-up call
for us," Crowe said. "They were a
little bit crisper on the starts and
turns and that's where they
gained on us. It's good that we
found out early in the season that
a few other teams besides Stan
ford [like Texas, USC and Michi
gan] have a legitimate shot at the
NCAA title."
Seven swimmers representing
the United States National team
also swam in Saturday's meet, the
most notable of them being former
Stanford great Janet Evans, who
still holds world records in the
400-meter, 800-meter and 1500-
meter free. Evans swam to easy
victories in the 500-yard and 1000-
yard free.
Another notable National team
member was 1992 Olympian and

former Stanford assistant coach
Angie Wester-Krieg, who won the
200-yard fly and placed second in
the 100-yard fly.
"Although it was nice to see
Janet, Angie and other National
team members, we had to focus on
Michigan," Quick said. "We only
had one goal, and that was to beat
the Wolverines."
The U.S. National team is
training for the National Champi
onships, which are held the same
week as the NCAAs in March.
Stanford begins Pacific 10 Con
ference action this weekend when
it travels to the state of Arizona for
a pair of dual meets. The Cardinal
will swim against Arizona on Fri
day in Tucson before facing Ari
zona State on Saturday in Tempe.
"We use each dual meet as a
stepping stone to the NCAAs,"
Quick said. "This past meet,
although it was a nail-bitter,
just another stone."
