the top-two spots with Diehl win
ning in 1:38.84. Gagner finished
close behind in 1:38.91.
While the score see-sawed
throughout the meet, the Cardinal
was successful in answering all of
the Wolverine's scoring bursts.
Most notably, the Stanford divers
made their mark, as David Johns
and James Edwards finished 1-2 on
both the 1-and 3-meter boards.
Johns was victorious on the 1-meter
with a score of 191.4 while Edwards
claimed the 3-meter competition
with 203.55 points.
Although Michigan won six of
the nine individual swim events,
Stanford swimmers took second
and third places in the 50 free, 200
butterfly and 100 free to keep the
score close.
Afler a strong 2-3-4 Cardinal fin
ish in the 100 free, Retterer won the
200 backstroke in a time of 1:44.47.
With the meet turning in Stanford's
favor, Dan Kanner swam to an
unshaved-personal best time of
4:27.77 in the next event, the 500
free.

"I was having some great work
outs during Christmas training, so I
was looking forward to swimming
the 500," kanner said. "They have
the top corps of 500 swimmers, so
we didn't want to let them go 1-2-3.
People were coming up to me and
telling me to get in there and break
them up."
Kanner did that, finishing
behind the 1993 NCAA champion
in the event, Marcel Wouda, and
just ahead of Michigan's Chris
Rumley. "[Wouda] is a pretty big
guy, so I was dragging off him for
the first 300 yards," Kanner said.
"We were pretty far ahead of every
one else, but [Rumley] was closing
fast, especially on the last 50. The
last 200 was pretty brutal."
After Planner's points were tal
lied, the divers dominated the 3-
meter competition to give the Cardi
nal some breathing room. In the
meet's final individual race, team
captain Grote won the 200 breast
stroke in 2:01.46. Stanford fresh
man Tom Wilkens was second in
2:03.30.
The Cardinal finished off the vic
tory by winning the 400 free relay.
The Stanford 'A' squad of Scott
Claypool, Hudepohl, Muhammad
and Retterer was timed in 2:57.98,

more than two seconds ahead of
Michigan 'A' squad.
"This meet was really exciting —
we figured it would be our biggest
meet and the most telling meet of
the season," Grote said. "Michigan
is a very good team in dual meets,
but we were able to figure out where
they would put their best guys.
Every time they tried to get on a
roll, someone stopped their momen
tum."
Kanner, who along with his fel
low senior classmates has been a
part of three NCAA championship
teams, called this victory "a great
feeling."
"'This is by far the most excited
I've ever seen our team for a dual
meet," Kanner said. "I was a bit
nervous before the meet, but the
nerves changed to positive energy
and good feelings afterwards. It was
great to know the bonding during
training helped — we had much
more team spirit than Michigan."
With the toughest part of its dual
meet season behind, the Cardinal
will look to remain dominant
throughout the Pacific 10 Confer
ence season. The team will build on
this weekend's success as it looks to
win a fourth consecutive NCAA
title in March.
