# Men vault to Open win
## 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
Just two days after the
NCAA's announcement that this
season would not be the last for
men's gymnastics, the fourth
ranked Cardinal began competi
tion by topping California and 13
other teams to win San Jose
State's Spartan Open.
Individually, the gymnasts
turned in impressive perfor
mances. In Saturday morning's
compulsories, Stanford's Josh
Stein ard Keith Wiley finished
second a id third overall, behind
top individual Chainey Umphrey
of UCLA.
The compulsories clearly com
prised the most important por
tion of the competition, serving
as a qualifier for the Winter
Nationals in two weeks. The
highly competitive scores of Stein
and Wiley make their selection
for the event likely, however, the
qualifications have still not been
confirmed.
Late Saturday in the event
finals, the Cardinal continued its
success despite many scratches
by Stanford's gymnasts. Four out
of the six events were won by the
Cardinal. Only the rings, in
which Stanford sent no competi
tors, and the pommel horse, won
by Cal's Chris Toy, were taken by
the competition.
For the Cardinal, Jamie Ellis
led the individual honors with
two first-place finishes. Ellis won
the high bar with a 9.75 and
along with Wiley, Stein and Mark
Booth, helped Stanford to domi
nate the parallel bars and take
four of the top five places in the

event.
Sophomore lan Bachrach
turned in a strong performance
as well, winning both the floor
exercise, in which Ellis finished
third, and the vault, in which
Stein finished runner-up and
freshman Clarence Miao placed
sixth. With high finishes on the
horse, Stein and Booth completed
the impressive round of scores.
While the win was more than
welcome for Stanford, the Gold
en Bears were able to keep it

close, losing the team competi
tion by less than one point.
Injuries proved to be a major
obstacle for the Cardinal, as Tim
Dalrymple, hobbled with an
ankle injury, was unable to com
pete. Former national team
member and Olympian Jair
Lynch, now Stanford's assistant
coach, also could not compete in
the open.

Lynch, who is contending for a
spot on the national team once
again. He will submit a petition to
be included as a competitor in
nationals despite his inability to
participate in the qualifier. If his
request is denied, he will join
teammate Jamie Ellis, also unsure
of his qualification after a border
line performance in the compul
sories, in Houston next weekend
for a final qualifying attempt.
Apart from injuries, many of
the Cardinal's problems could also
be attributed to the difficulty of
the gymnasts' routines. "We try to
prepare our gymnasts for interna
tional competition rather than
simply going for NCAA titles,"
said assistant coach Taka Miya
gawa.
