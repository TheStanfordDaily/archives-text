# Biology Department gets $1.2 million grant
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Faculty members of the Biology Depart
ment got a special New Year's bonus last
week in the form of a $ 1.2 million grant from
the Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust.
The grant — to be administered over the
next three years — will be used to support a
research and training program in molecu
lar, cellular and developmental biology, ac
cording to Biology Department Chair Pat
Jones.
"We are absolutely thrilled to have this
money," Jones said. "Faculty today are hav
ing an increasingly difficult time getting
grant money. We're very honored to be the
recipients of this award."

The funds will allow the
department to train three
or four postdoctoral fel
lows each year, Jones said.

The fellows will work with junior faculty
and assist them with research projects.
"We're very glad that we are able to sup
port our junior faculty, whom we anticipate
will be the leaders in the field in the coming
years," Jones said. "The department is in
vesting in its future."
The Markey Trust grant will also be used
to purchase major equipment for state-of
the-art research facilities, which will be
shared by faculty members in the depart
ment.
"Thanks to the grant, the
department will be able to buy
some exciting new instruments
that will give researchers new
capabilities," Jones said.
Among the department's pur
chases for the next year are a con
focal microscope and a computer
ized molecular modeling system,
Jones said.
The confocal microscope will
allow researchers to look closely
inside cells or tissue, while the
molecular modeling system will
help in predicting the structures
of molecules and in characteriz
ing DNA sequences.
Jones added that additional
equipment will be purchased with
the remaining two years of grant
money.
A portion of the Markey Trust

award will also be used to fund
skilled technicians and service
support for two already-existing
facilities — an electron microscopy
lab and a cell-sorting facility.
Stanford was one of 14 univer
sities and research facilities to
receive funds from the Markey
Trust last week. The trust doled
out a total of $15.8 million in
grant money.
Markey Trust grants are used
to support research for address
ing fundamental questions in
biomedical science, such as cell
biology, genetics and immunolo
gy, said Robert Glaser, director
for medical science of the Markey
Trust, in a statement.
Since its start in 1983, the
Markey Trust has awarded more
than $474 million for the support
and encouragement of basic med
ical research. The latest batch of
grants represents the trust's last
group of m*yor awards.
The School of Medicine previ

ously received a Markey grant to
help establish its Department of
Developmental Biology. Stanford
also has several Markey Scholars,
including three in the Biology
Department — more than any
other department in the nation,
Jones said.
Biology Prof. Michael Simon, a
Markey Scholar, said the grant
money has been "incredibly help
ful." The trust provides seven
years of support for scholars, from
their postdoctoral years to their
time as a junior faculty member.
The Markey Trust funds sup
ply a substantial amount of
money, Simon said. "It accounts
for a large proportion of my Stan
ford salary," he explained.
The Markey Trust was estab
lished by the late Lucille P.
Markey, owner of the Calumet
Farm thoroughbred racing sta
bles. In accordance to Markey's
wishes, the trust will cease opera
tions in June 1997.
