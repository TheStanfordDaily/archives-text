### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Faculty members of the Biology Depart
ment got a special New Year's bonus last
week in the form of a $ 1.2 million grant from
the Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust.
The grant — to be administered over the
next three years — will be used to support a
research and training program in molecu
lar, cellular and developmental biology, ac
cording to Biology Department Chair Pat
Jones.
"We are absolutely thrilled to have this
money," Jones said. "Faculty today are hav
ing an increasingly difficult time getting
grant money. We're very honored to be the
recipients of this award."

The funds will allow the
department to train three
or four postdoctoral fel
lows each year, Jones said.

The fellows will work with junior faculty
and assist them with research projects.
"We're very glad that we are able to sup
port our junior faculty, whom we anticipate
will be the leaders in the field in the coming
years," Jones said. "The department is in
vesting in its future."
The Markey Trust grant will also be used
to purchase major equipment for state-of
the-art research facilities, which will be
shared by faculty members in the depart
ment.
