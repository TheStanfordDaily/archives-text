# Quad tries to stay out of red
## 1994-95 yearbook will see fewer pages, less color 
### Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing writer 
After two companies defaulted on pay
ments to the Stanford yearbook in excess of
$40,000, The Quad now faces financial diffi
culties this year and delays in the production
of its 1993-94 volume.
Although The Quad doesn't receive money
from the University or the Student Publica
tions Board, funding is usually not a problem.
This year, however, two companies — Antho
ny's Advertising and the Yearbook Associates
— failed to make their payments to the year
book.
The yearbook staff contacted multiple
lawyers about suing, but rejected the idea
since the costs of litigation would probably ex

ceed the benefits, said Michael Nichols, last
year's editor.
Though The Quad petitioned the ASSU
for funding this year, it did not qualify since
students must pay for their copies of the year
book.
"We should be eligible for one-time fund
ing," Nichols said, "but instead we'll have to
cut costs."
To compensate for the lost funds, the year
book reduced the number of color pages, cut
48 pages out of this year's yearbook, omitted
4 staff positions, and suspended staff ameni
ties. The cost of the book, however, will still be
$60 per book.
"We'll be fine," said Nichols, "but the
image of the way students view
Stanford will suffer."
Compounding the yearbook's
financial difficulties is the fact that
the 1993-94 yearbook, which was
supposed to be ready by November,
will not be ready until mid-Febru
ary.
Nichols explained that, because
the last set of proofs were lost in the
mail last summer, the yearbook
missed its printing time. Last
year's Quad has been finished for
months but cannot be printed until
the printing company has time.
"We'd appreciate it if students
would understand the difficulties
of producing the book," Nichols
said. "The delay is not our fault
and it shouldn't affect your opin
ion of the book."
Current editor Aaron Bilstrom
said he is also concerned that the
delay will make people question the
quality of the book. But Nichols said
The Quad is still a high quality pro
duction. "We produced what I feel
is the best book," Nichols added.
"It's worth the wait."
