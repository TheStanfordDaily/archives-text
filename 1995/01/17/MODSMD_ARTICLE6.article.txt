# Med School reconsiders tenure plan

Many School of Medicine faculty will have to work
harder and longer to gain tenure if a new plan is ap
proved — and even then they still are not guaranteed a
tenured position.
The proposal, as outlined in a memo from Medical
School administrators, would delay granting tenure to
tenure-line professors in clinical departments — such
as surgery or pediatrics — by up to tive years after their
promotion to associate professor. A rigorous review
would then decide whether to promote the candidate to
professor with tenure.
Currently, tenure is decided at the same time as pro
motion to associate professor.
Furthermore, tenure-line professors could only be
granted tenure if a billet — a funded slot for a tenured
professor — is open. This move comes as the school
aims to trim 93 tenure-line billets from clinical depart
ments as a cost-saving measure.
The plan will be discussed at the Medical School's
Faculty Senate meeting Friday, said senate chair Larry
Mathers, an anatomy professor. Mathers added that
the meeting marks a beginning — not the end — of
work on the issue.
"This proposal is really going to be a springboard fot
discussion.... They might decide to depart from the
recommendations significantly," he said. "I anticipate
there will be a spirited discussion."
Even though the proposal could cause significant
change for the Medical Center's faculty, several profes
sors said last week they were not fully informed about
the plan.
The alterations are outlined in a 1994 memo from
Medical School Dean David Korn and Senior Assoc.
