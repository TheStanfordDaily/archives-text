# Med School reconsiders tenure plan
## 
### Andy Dworkin Burt Herman Staff writers 
Many School of Medicine faculty will have to work
harder and longer to gain tenure if a new plan is ap
proved — and even then they still are not guaranteed a
tenured position.
The proposal, as outlined in a memo from Medical
School administrators, would delay granting tenure to
tenure-line professors in clinical departments — such
as surgery or pediatrics — by up to tive years after their
promotion to associate professor. A rigorous review
would then decide whether to promote the candidate to
professor with tenure.
Currently, tenure is decided at the same time as pro
motion to associate professor.
Furthermore, tenure-line professors could only be
granted tenure if a billet — a funded slot for a tenured
professor — is open. This move comes as the school
aims to trim 93 tenure-line billets from clinical depart
ments as a cost-saving measure.
The plan will be discussed at the Medical School's
Faculty Senate meeting Friday, said senate chair Larry
Mathers, an anatomy professor. Mathers added that
the meeting marks a beginning — not the end — of
work on the issue.
"This proposal is really going to be a springboard fot
discussion.... They might decide to depart from the
recommendations significantly," he said. "I anticipate
there will be a spirited discussion."
Even though the proposal could cause significant
change for the Medical Center's faculty, several profes
sors said last week they were not fully informed about
the plan.
The alterations are outlined in a 1994 memo from
Medical School Dean David Korn and Senior Assoc.
Dean for Faculty Affairs Robert Cutler to Provost Con-
doleezza Rice.
The changes stem from concern
over how the nascent Stanford
Health Services organization will
affect clinical departments, over
declining future income from clini
cal practice and federal research
money, and over the end of manda
tory retirement for university pro
fessors.
Stanford Health Services was
formed a year ago to help the Med
ical Center adjust to today's rapid
ly changing health care environ
ment.

The alterations to the tenure
system, the memo says, will let
associate professors establish "a
firmer track record" before they
apply for tenure and "permit
departments and the School to rec
ommend tenure with much
greater confidence than present
ly"
Those who cannot get tenure
because no billets are open will
have longer to "further their
careers" at Stanford and become
"leading candidates for top aca
demic positions elsewhere" if the
time to tenure is delayed, the docu
ment says.
The memo adds that the delay of
tenure adds another " 'up or out'

rung on the academic ladder," dis
couraging the reappointment of
tenure-line associate professors
who cannot be promoted to profes
sor. The longer time to tenure "will
undoubtedly foster a process of
natural selection," as more senior
associate professors accept posi
tions at other institutions, the doc
ument says.
Faculty members rejected for
tenure and promotion to professor
"would be eligible for a three-year
terminal appointment to assure
program stability and allow a rea
sonable period of time for reloca
tion," the memo states.
In addition to changing the
tenure process for tenure-line pro

fessors, the memo discusses other
categories of Medical School profes
sors as well. Medical Center Line
faculty, for example, would be
appointed as assistant professors
for terms of seven years, not the
current six. Different and more
"comprehensive" assessment
methods would be used for these
professors.
The Medical Center Line,
responsible primarily for clinical
care and teaching, was created in
1989 and now has 103 professors,
60 of whom are assistant profes
sors.
Korn said the recommendations
are the result of "a lengthy deliber
ative process that took place among

the leadership of the school for a
year and a half." According to the
memo, the chairs of the clinical
departments participated in the
plan's creation.
The plan was sent to the Uni
versity president and provost in
May and, Korn said, has been
reviewed by those officials.
Many medical schools nation
wide are re-evaluating their tenure
policies due to the massive changes
underway in the American health
care market, he added.
Korn said he has not yet heard
from any professors upset over the
policy, but added that "changes are
always likely to have people who
don't care for them."

The memo points out that, if the
changes are made, Stanford's
tenure timeline will become similar
to other top medical schools. The
medical schools at Harvard and
Duke, for example, require 11
years before a tenure decision, and
the figure is 10 years at those of
Yale and Princeton.
The changes, however, might
make it harder to get great profes
sors at the Medical School, said
Health Research and Policy and
Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron.
"It's harder to recruit people,"
under such a plan, he said. "You
can't promise someone they'll
receive tenure no matter how good
they are."
