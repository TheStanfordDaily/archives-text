# On a dig with the campus archaeologist
## Jones unearths pre-1891 Farm history 
### 
Most think that Stanford's
history began in 1891. But Laura
Jones knows better than that.
Jones — the campus archaeol
ogist — is well aware of the rich
history that lies beneath the sur
face of the beautiful 8,180-acre
campus.
Among the treasures to be
found on the University's expan
sive grounds are 62 prehistoric
Native American sites, found
mostly in the foothills, Stanford
Research Park, and Stanford
West.
"Our prehistoric archaeologi
cal sites go back at least 4,500
years," Jones said, "and probably
older," since the area had been in
habited by the Ohlone Indians
for at least 10,000 years. In fact,
she said Stanford is considered
Muwekma territory, after which
the Native American theme
house is named.
Hidden sites left by the Native
Americans are exciting finds be
cause they offer clues about the
campus's past.
"There's always little thrills
anytime you discover anything,"
Jones said. "Finding something
where you didn't know there was
something — it's such a sur
prise."
Rare and exciting finds, petro
glyphs — patterns of lines and
circles pecked into bedrock —
might have served as landmarks,
marking boundaries. One of

Jones' most surprising discover
ies was a small petroglyph of four
raked lines.
"I'm walking up in the
foothills and suddenly I see it.
That's probably as thrilled as I've
ever been because they're hard to
find," she said.
More common, village sites
have been discovered on three of
Stanford's six creeks, like the San
Francisquito in Stanford West,
where "dietary remains, such as
shellfish, animal bones, stone
tools and other waste from cook
ing" were dug up, Jones said.
Cemeteries are sometimes
found in the villages as well, with

complete human skeletons, along
with shell ornaments and arrow
heads, buried up to 20 feet under
ground.
"There are hundreds of Native
Americans buried on campus,"
Jones said.
When found, local tribal groups
are notified, and Jones "will dis
cuss with them how they feel about
our studying (the burial] and
whether or not it needs to move."
Permission to study has always
been granted and, unless in danger,
the burial is left in place.
For Jones, "nothing ever feels
quite as important as taking
responsibility and care of a burial,"
she said. "It is an incredible experi
ence to actually look at these people
lying in the ground."
Two more campus sites provide
glimpses into the Native-American
past. Outcrops of Franciscan chert,
a type of rock, are found at several
stone tool sites, and were used to
produce knives, chisels, arrow
heads and scrapers.

In addition to the prehistoric
component of campus, historical
sites exist, reflecting a period of set
tlements afler the Native Ameri
cans were relocated by the
Spaniards to the missions in the
late 1700s. Spanish metals and
ceramics, for example, have been
spotted.
Since "the Stanfords employed
many Asian immigrants, there was
also "a really early Asian-American
presence on campus," Jones said.
On the sites at Webb Ranch, where
a structure still stands, and in the
arboretum, containers of Chinese
medicines, metals with Chinese
writings, Asian ceramics, coins and
rice bowls have been found.
Once both prehistoric and his
toric archaeological sites are identi
fied, they are set aside as academic
resource, Jones said.
"If a student or faculty member
comes up with a research problem
that needs to be tested, that's real
ly what the sites are there for ...
future teaching and research."
Demonstrating the incredible
value the University places on its
teaching and research mission,
Stanford developed an important
policy committed to protecting

archaeological sites from develop
ment in 1986. At that time, the
Board of Trustees voted to protect
all the land in the Stanford West
excavations.
Although it may conflict with
their interests, developers under
stand the University's dedication
to academic research.
"It's always been a very cooper
ative process," Jones said. She
reviews development proposals to
see if they impact sensitive archae
ological areas. If they will, Jones'
"job is to work with them to design
projects around it." Fortunately,
no conflict has required the
provost's mediation yet.
By saving the archaeological
sites, Jones is preserving Stan
ford's history.
"I'd like to think that they're
going to be here in 100 years," she
said. "It'd be fabulous if they were
here in 1,000 years."
Students have opportunities to
get into the history of the campus
as well. "There is a dig coming up
Spring Quarter," Jones said, for
students taking Continuing Stud
ies and Archaeological Field Meth
ods with Assoc. Anthropology Prof.
John Rick.
