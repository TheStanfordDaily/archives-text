# On a dig with the campus archaeologist
## Jones unearths pre-1891 Farm history 
### 
Most think that Stanford's
history began in 1891. But Laura
Jones knows better than that.
Jones — the campus archaeol
ogist — is well aware of the rich
history that lies beneath the sur
face of the beautiful 8,180-acre
campus.
Among the treasures to be
found on the University's expan
sive grounds are 62 prehistoric
Native American sites, found
mostly in the foothills, Stanford
Research Park, and Stanford
West.
"Our prehistoric archaeologi
cal sites go back at least 4,500
years," Jones said, "and probably
older," since the area had been in
habited by the Ohlone Indians
for at least 10,000 years. In fact,
she said Stanford is considered
Muwekma territory, after which
the Native American theme
house is named.
Hidden sites left by the Native
Americans are exciting finds be
cause they offer clues about the
campus's past.
"There's always little thrills
anytime you discover anything,"
Jones said. "Finding something
where you didn't know there was
something — it's such a sur
prise."
Rare and exciting finds, petro
glyphs — patterns of lines and
circles pecked into bedrock —
might have served as landmarks,
marking boundaries. One of

Jones' most surprising discover
ies was a small petroglyph of four
raked lines.
"I'm walking up in the
foothills and suddenly I see it.
That's probably as thrilled as I've
ever been because they're hard to
find," she said.
More common, village sites
have been discovered on three of
Stanford's six creeks, like the San
Francisquito in Stanford West,
where "dietary remains, such as
shellfish, animal bones, stone
tools and other waste from cook
ing" were dug up, Jones said.
Cemeteries are sometimes
found in the villages as well, with
