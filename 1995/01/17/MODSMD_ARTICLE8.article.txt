# In Africa, Peru, anthro profs look for origins of man

Far from Stanford's
classrooms, on opposite
sides of the world, two an
thropology professors have
been conducting archaeo
logical digs to learn more
about prehistoric humans.
Assoc. Anthropology Prof.
John Rick, interested in Latin
America, has worked in the cen
tral highlands of Junin, Peru,
studying "the way early hunter
gatherers lived in frigid-tropical
environments."
From 1973 to 1986, Rick and
his team of Stanford students
excavated a series of Panaulauca
cave sites which humans occupied
as early as 10,000 years ago.
They collected and analyzed
great quantities of stone tools and
animal bones that accumulated in
the caves.
The findings provide "evidence
that early hunters of (thesel areas
apparently had achieved very well
managed relations with their pri
mary prey animal, the vicuna,"
Rick said, "capable of improving
the animal population stability
through hunting rather than
treating the animals as a
reducible resource."
Peru's civil unrest caused Rick
to shift his focus to investigating

the early agricultural villages on
New Mexico's Zuni Reservation.
Yet he has optimistic plans of
returning to Peru this summer
with a new project. "I am aiming
for field work on a major temple
site" at Chavin de Huantar, he
said.
As well as "looking at the tech
nology of the stone construction
to get a sense of how the sites
were built," Rick is interested in
studying the temple's architec
ture in terms of its function.
Reaching the peak of their use
some 3,000 years ago, the "struc
tures are laced with labyrinths
which were built to be used dur
ing initiation ceremonies or rites
in which people were brought into
the cults that Chavin sponsored,"
Rick said.
Meanwhile, across the globe,
Prof. Richard Klein has been
investigating the origin of mod
ern human beings, excavating in
South Africa for the past 25
years.
During the past three years
Klein has been digging in an area
80 miles southeast of Cape Town,
whose archaeological sites are
50,000 to 100,000 years old.

Klein has been testing the
"Out of Africa" hypothesis that
"modern humans originated
exclusively in Africa and spread
from there, replacing the Nean
derthals and other people in
Eurasia."
In his excavations, Klein has
unearthed ancient stone artifacts
and animal bones early humans
left behind. Klein hopes that
human remains are buried at the
site; even though, mainly frag
mented pieces of humans have
been found.
In the meantime, Klein
believes his findings can show
that modern humans were better
hunters and gatherers than the
Neanderthals.
"I can show pretty clearly that
modern humans were able to
spread because they were much
better at using culture to adapt to
environment," he said. Biological
ly different from modern humans
in terms of their brains, Klein can
also demonstrate "that Nean
derthals were behaviorally differ
ent, not so good at hunting and
gathering."
Klein plans to continue his dig
this summer.
