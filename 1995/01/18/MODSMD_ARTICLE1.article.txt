# Keeping 'Smoke Signals'
## Review to keep its Indian image 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
Despite protest from the Native
American community and com
plaints from administrators, The
Stanford Review will continue to
use a Native American chief as the
mascot for one of its features â€” at
least for the next four weeks.
Though the conservative maga
zine's editorial board did not have
a formal vote on the issue at its
meeting last week, Review Editor
in Chief Aman Verjee said a msyor
ity of the board members advised
him in private to keep the mascot
in "Smoke Signals," The Review's
commentary on the University's
high and low points.
Review Senior Editor Michael
Meyer, who will become editor in
chief next month, has yet to make
a decision on the issue.
"I've thought about it a little
bit, but my editorship doesn't start
for a few weeks, so I have more
than enough time to think. I can't
make the decision until I'm edi
tor," he said.
The conflict between The Re
view and protesters against the
mascot became public last quarter,
when The Review first published
its "Smoke Signals" column. Sev
eral Native American students
wrote to University President Ger
hard Casper, asking that he censor
The Review.
After Casper issued a statement
saying that he did not have the
power to censor the magazine,
campus Native American groups
staged a protest by ripping up
copies of The Review and putting
them in front of Casper's office.
The Review staff and the Native
American groups met in the begin
ning of December to discuss the
issue, which Veijee said "didn't
change anyone's mind, not mine
nor the editorial board's."
He argued that since the mascot
is a fictitious Native American
chief, it is not representative of all
Native Americans.
"My own sense was that the
logo does not perpetuate a negative
stereotype the way the Native
American students thought," Ver
jee said. "Their main argument
was (that the mascot has a)
grotesque face and tomahawk. I
understand that these are poten
tially negative images if associated
with a people."
He maintained, though, that
the mascot represents the Native
American chief as an occupation,
not as a people.
"This is an occupation like a
cowboy. Just like a cowboy wears a
10-gallon hat or guns, they look
mean and they look nasty. That
doesn't mean that all white people
have to do that. A chief, in a certain
context, will act in a nasty way," he
said.
Verjee said he suggested at last
month's meeting that the mascot's
features be made more distin
guished, but the Native American
community refused to compromise.
"The compromise I suggested
we thought was pretty reasonable,
but I guess they felt it wasn't good
enough, or it wasn't in good faith.

They want the logo gone entirely,
and that's something we're not
willing to do. Hopefully, they'll
understand," he said.
Lawrence Tovar, a linguistics
graduate student who spoke out
against The Review at the meeting,
said the issue was more about The
Review itself and its leadership.
"They're mimicking national lead
ers in an attempt to be bold," he
said. "They're part of that new con
servative wave."
Tovar said The Review is "get
ting around the issue to preach
their conservative views. They're
trying to make something unjust
seem just."
"I didn't personally expect the
Review's editorial board to have
the courage to admit they were
wrong," said Sara Jumping Eagle,
a second year medical student.
She said that Native American
students are alienated in some way
every year. "We are being made to
feel attacked as if we are not part of
the Stanford community in gener
al," she said.
