### September Treviño Staff writer 
Police Bhut down Campus Drive East last
Saturday night after a car crashed into a fire
hydrant, flooding the southbound section of
the street and backing up game traffic for
more than 40 minutes.
The incident occurred around 10 p.m. Just
before the end of Saturday's men's basketball
game against the Arizona Wildcats. Two cars
collided at the intersection of Campus Drive

East and Serra St. after the driver of a white
Mercury Sable ran a stop sign, said Stanford
Police Sgt. John McMullen.
According to police, the Sable was travel
ing too fast for the rainy road conditions
when it crossed the intersection and hit a
blue Ford Explorer. The impact of the crash
caused the Explorer to flip over and land
upside-down.
After hitting the Explorer, the Sable collid
ed with a fire hydrant, sending 35 to 40 feet of
gushing water into the air, McMullen said.

The water flooded the intersection and forced
authorities to shut down Campus Drive East
and reroute traffic toward Galvez St.
All three people involved in the accident —
two in the Sable and one in the Explorer —
were wearing seatbelts. The passenger in the
Sable complained of minor chest pains, but
declined to go to the Stanford Medical Center.
The two drivers were not injured.
While the Explorer suffered major roof
damage, there was only moderate damage
done to the Sable's front end.
