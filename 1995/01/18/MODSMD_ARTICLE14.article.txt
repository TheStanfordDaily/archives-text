# Survivors of quake survey wreckage
## Tremor affected thousands, obliterated supposedly sturdy buildings

KOBE, Japan (AP) — Survivors wandered
battered streets with blank expressions yester
day in a city that was supposed to stand up to
earthquakes, their faith in technology smashed
by a disaster that killed at least 1,800 people.
Elevated roads and bridges that Japanese
engineers boasted were quake-proof were bro
ken at crazy angles, flung to earth by the force
of nature, crushing whatever was beneath it.
Hardly a block in this industrial port city of
1.4 million people had a house or building
intact. Many streets were reduced to piles of
rubble, leftovers from the strongest quake to
strike an urban area of Japan since 1948.
Osaka, Japan's second-largest city and
across the bay from Kobe, was also heavily
damaged. The wreckage extended 50 miles
northwest of Kobe to the sacred temples and
statues of the ancient city of Kyoto.
While Kobe was by far the hardest hit, both
this city, where tender beer-fed Kobe beef gets
its name, and Osaka burned through the night
from fires fueled by ruptured gas lines.
National police said 1,800 people were
known dead, 966 missing and 6,334 injured.
The toll was expected to rise as communica
tions were restored.

Nearly 4,000 buildings were destroyed, the
"bullet" train was knocked out of service
because of track damage between Hiroshima
and Nagoya, and hundreds of aftershocks con
tinued through the night, forcing many to
sleep outside for fear of further damage to
buildings left standing.
Just outside Kobe, damage seemed almost
arbitrary — a showroom window at an auto
dealership survived undamaged. Next to it,
four wooden houses collapsed. In the city, a
five-story building had fallen on its side, and a
seven-story bank building leaned over the side
walk.
About 100,000 people spent the night in
emergency shelters in Kobe, eating rice balls
handed out by rescue workers and sipping
water trucked in by the fire department
because so many water lines were fractured.
Rikihiro Sumino said he escaped serious
injury because his blankets padded him when a
dresser fell on his bed.
"I never dreamed we'd get hit by a quake like
this here in Kobe," Sumino said. "I figured it
would happen in Tokyo, but I never thought it
would happen to us.'"
He added: "You reallv can't trust those

experts. They all said that this wouldn't hap
pen. They said our highways and buildings
were safe, not like America. But we've proven
them wrong."
Takarazuka, Ashiya and Awtyi Island were
also damaged in the quake, which occurred a
year after a magnitude 6.7 quake killed 61 peo
ple in and around the Northridge area north of
Los Angeles.
The shaking lasted about 20 seconds and
snapped vital lifelines to western Japan, cutting
hundreds of miles of rail service that is the
transport lifeblood of many workers here and
knocking out power and telephones.
Elevated highways collapsed, crushing vehi
cles underneath. A bus sat perched on the edge
of a fallen section of highway.
The devastation shattered Japan's belief
that sophisticated engineering would enable its
newer buildings and roads to withstand a rmyor
quake.
Already, criticism was being voiced about
prevention and rescue efforts.
"I think rescue measures have been very
slow," said Tokyo University professor Osamu
Koide. "I think there was a lack of quake-pre
ventive knowledge."
