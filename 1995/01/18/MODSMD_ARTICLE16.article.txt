Long duration of SAE's
punishment an unfair
decision by University

Tension between housed
fraternities and University
administration has become
increasingly apparent in recent
years. At a school where life in res
idence plays a defining role in the
majority of students' lives, housed
fraternities are often marginalized
as contradictory to the aims of
Stanford's Residential Education
program.
Irrespective of this debate, it is
clear that University administra
tors should treat existing housed
fraternities as they would any
other student organization. How
ever, as the latest disciplinary
action taken against Sigma Alpha
Epsilon demonstrates, this may
not always be the case.
The most recent installment in
the continuing saga of University
fraternity politics began last fall,
when Dean of Students Michael
Jackson put the SAEs on social
probation in response to an illegal
bonfire held in the house's back
yard by graduating members of the
fraternity.
The bonfire, coupled with other
behavioral problems among the
SAEs, lead Jackson and Assoc. Dir.
of Residential Education Diana
Conklin to put the fraternity on
probation for the rest of this aca
demic year. Even more importantly,
Jackson and Conklin stipulated
that if any SAE member is convict
ed of a non-academic offense by the
University or the Greek judicial
board between now and the begin
ning of 1998, the University may
revoke SAE's status as a fraternity
and force its members to vacate the
house.
While SAE undoubtedly
deserves some measure of punish
ment for the offenses cited by
administrators, the University's

final decision is too severe. In par
ticular, the fact that SAE's exis
tence will be called into question
for a full three years to come is a
clear example of misplaced disci
plinary action on the part of the
University.
Conklin has said that the deci
sion was intended to engender a
sense of "collective responsibility"
within the fraternity. However, if
administrators believe they are jus
tified in severely restricting the
activities of SAE, they should do so
for a shorter period of time. It is
ridiculous that the next three class
es of incoming members will have
to live with the consequences of
actions which occurred before they
even joined the fraternity.
Moreover, the long duration of
the punishment calls into question
the University's true intention
regarding the fraternity's future.
Under the present arrangement,
SAE! will likely experience
increased difficulties recruiting
new members for the next three
years, which in turn will jeopardize
their existence as an organization.
If three years of careful scrutiny
doesn't provide the University with
a reason to abolish the house, the
fraternity could conceivably fold on
its own.
It appears, therefore, that the
University may be carrying out a
plan which will unavoidably lead to
the loss of SAE's house. If the Uni
versity's ultimate goal is to get rid
of the fraternity — a hypothesis
which is cqrtamly not beyond the.
realm of possibility — administra
tors should have the integrity to go
about it in an open manner rather
than prolonging the agony.
At the suggestion of the Univer
sity, SAE began making positive
changes earlier this year. Amongst
other things, a judicial committee
was established to deal with behav
ioral issues and a series of commu
nity service projects were initiated.
As long as SAE continues to avoid
future problems, there is no reason
to impose undue difficulties on the
fraternity for a full three vears.
