## The
						hum of journalistic urgency 
### 
A FEW NIGHTS ago I was in a room
talking to a friend when suddenly,
simultaneously, we became aware
of the sound of a television somewhere
else in the house. As we listened we real
ized that it was a news program, with
the tight excited voice of the newscaster
reporting incidents of rioting following
the 49ers playoff victory over Dallas.
The reports seemed terrible. Without
visual evidence, the event sounded to us
like something violent, senseless, not
unlike larger crises experienced through
the voice of the media: the Gulf War, the
riots in Los Angeles, Bosnia.
And so what was I to think the next
morning when I read newspaper head
lines recalling "low-key jubilation"?
The conflicting stories do much to
explain our current relationship with
news and other media. It is a paradoxical
relationship, geared toward connecting
us, yet more often resulting in feelings
of detachment. Whether reported bat
tles and celebrations take place in end
zones or war zones, the situations seem
at the moment of listening or reading to
be of vital consequence. Yet at the same
time we can turn off the television or
fold up the newspaper, and what was
once primal is now yesterday's news.
The feverish pitch of the reporter's
voice the night of the "low-key" football
riots exemplifies what George Steiner
calls a "temporality of equivalent
instantaneity," where each event is of
equal — and maximum — importance.

Yet surrounded by this constant hum of
journalistic urgency it is nearly impossi
ble for us to maintain compassion or
even interest. We become numb to
events that truly are vital as they are
lost in the surrounding mishmash of
entertaining trivia. Or as Steiner
observes, "the utmost beauty and terror
are shredded at close of day. We are
made whole again, and expectant, in
time for the morning edition."
But what exactly are we expecting
when that edition arrives? Certainly
not a life-affirming experience. Each
day at the breakfast table we consume
the paper along with our morning cof
fee, at night we eat our dinners to the
sound of the six o'clock news. The sto
ries simply pass over us as one more
thing to digest, another distraction
from the comparatively boring events
of our own lives.
The problem here is that the strange
amusement we derive from our bound
less consumption of journalistic report
ing cannot succeed in satisfying our
desire for the excitement of vital experi
ences. As a secondary media, reportage
amplifies our sense of detachment. We
watch handsome people on television
speaking words put together by someone
else, describing situations they did not
experience primarily, and we take those
words as the event itself.
But while the encounter lacks a sense
of personal intimacy, it is not the words
themselves that are to blame, but our

lack of investment in them. Like the pri
mary creative and performing arts, the
expressive media we find more fulfilling
than reportage is characterized by its
need for personal involvement. Litera
ture, music and drama all require the
creator to project himself outward
through the art, or for the performer to
project herself into the art through an
executed interpretation. These are not
words to let pass over us, they are words
to ingest.
For people like myself who rely so
heavily upon words to convey to others
who we are and what we share, it is ter
rifying when the words of popular news
media become out of touch, when we
cannot trust them not to distort real
people and events.
Neil Postman says that the "media of
communication available to a culture
are a dominant influence on the forma
tion of the culture's intellectual and
social preoccupations." These few words
are ones to think about. Somehow it is
comforting me that this past weekend
people were so aroused by a football
game that they had to take to the streets
to express their passions. Unfortunate
ly, most of us just heard about it on the
news.

Although Elizabeth Kelly did not take to
the streets last weekend, she is consider
ing doing so if the 49ers win the Super
bowl.
