ASSUSenate's special-fee plan is flawed and coercive

THE ASSU IS once again attempt
ing to take its imitation of big gov
ernment a step further. The sen
ate recently voted to approve a series of
amendments which would separate
undergraduate and graduate students
into distinct voting communities and
eliminate the fee refund system. The
provisions will be voted on by the stu
dent body in a general election to be held
on Jan. 25. The ASSU plans to secure
passage of the bill in the general election
by promising lower ASSU fees to gradu
ate students while attempting to protect
student groups from fluctuations in
refund rates. The proposal, which is
unnecessarily coercive and does not
promise to achieve either of its objec
tives, should be rejected as more suitable
alternatives definitely exist.
The ASSU proposal replaces the cur
rent system of raising voluntary contri
butions for student groups with a sys
tem of institutional taxation. This is
clearly unnecessary since most of the

groups receiving special-fees do not pro
vide basic services essential to the gener
al student body, but are narrowly
focused and represent special interests.
The new system would be unable to
raise adequate funds for organizations
which provide desirable services without
unjustly forcing many students to subsi
dize groups which they find irrelevant.
ASSU fees for undergraduates are also
expected to increase substantially as
graduate students are likely to reject
most fee requests. Stanford undergradu
ates do not need such coercive tax-and
spend legislation from the ASSU.
Secondly, the proposed all-or-none
funding system would require students
to vote on fee requests without knowing
the amount they would actually have to
pay. Undergraduates could end up pay
ing twice the expected amount for a
group if graduate students unexpectedly
deny its fee request, even if it is
approved by 51 percent of undergradu
ates and 49 percent of graduates. Gradu

ate students who want to support the
group would also be excluded from the
funding process. Such exclusion of will
ing donors will decrease revenues for
student groups, as undergraduates are
likely to be reluctant to vote for the non
refundable and potentially higher fees.
Even graduate students intent on reduc
ing their ASSU fees will not benefit, as
none of their fees are mandatory under
the current system.
The special-fee issue can be resolved
much more simply and fairly by limiting
fee refunds for a group to those individ
uals who had voted against the group in
the special-fee election (Alternatively,
individual fee refunds could be directly
determined from the results of the spe
cial-fee election). This would prevent
students from hypocritically voting to
fund a group and then refunding their
own contribution. The fees raised under
such a system would more accurately
reflect the student body's interest in
supporting the various groups, avoiding

the unnecessary complexity, inefficiency
and coerciveness of the ASSU proposal.
As the initial vote was taken at the
end of last quarter when many students
were preoccupied with more academic
concerns, students outside the senate
had few opportunities to publicly debate
the merits of the proposal. In fact, a sim
ilar letter on this subject which I had
drafted at the beginning of December
could not be published in time since only
one Daily issue is published during Dead
Week. To avert a potential scandal con
cerning the details of the original vote, a
second vote was taken on the first day of
classes this quarter. The ASSU Senate's
haste in passing this legislation, along
with their underhanded political tactics,
appear to belie a fear that their proposal
might not enjoy much support in the
general student body once individuals
are aware of the bill's implications and
flaws.
