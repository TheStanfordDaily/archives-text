## 'Social Interface' helps PC users Computer scientists and communicators collaborate at Microsoft 
### Dev Nag 
How many times have you
pounded your keyboard in frustra
tion over an incomprehensible pro
gram that might as well be in bina
ry? How many people are scared of
Unix outside of e-mail? Why are
computers so hard to use? After all,
they were made for people, right?
Wrong, say Stanford Communi
cations professors Clifford Nass and
Byron Reeves. And in response,
they have introduced an entirely
new concept to the world of
computing — the social user inter
face (SUI, pronounced 'soo-wee').
Focusing more on the user than

has any previous interface, the SUI
integrates aspects of social experi
ence into a computer environment.
So promising is this approach to
computer-user interactions that Bill
Gates, CEO of Microsoft, personally
demonstrated on implementation of
the SUI in the form of the much
hailed Bob program at a recent Con
sumer Electronics Show.
Nass describes the threefold evo
lution of SUI interfaces. "It started
with Unix and DOS," he said. These
operating systems are entirely text
based, or command-line interfaces
(CLIs). A prompt was the extent of
user-friendliness, and graphics were
limited to rudimentary ASCII art.

Then, in 1984, the introduction
of the Macintosh was a "revolution
— the graphical user interface
(GUI, pronounced 'gooey') came
along," Nass said. The GUI began a
whole new era of computing, incor
porating both the Macintosh series
of computers and the Windows pro
grams from Microsoft.
With a visual "desktop" and a
mouse to track the position of a cur
sor on the screen, users were treat
ed to a comfortable, picturesque
environment. "And now we have
SUI," Nass said. "This is meant to
be the radical new interface — it's
meant to supplant GUI," he
explained.

Traditionally, computer science
has viewed social interfaces as tools
for the ignorant. For example, some
PC and Unix advocates denigrate
the Macintosh environment, the
platform currently closest to the
SUI, as limited and inferior.
Extensive research conducted by
Nass and Reeves, however, demon
strated that thus view was misguid
ed. "Humans {ire experts at being
social. They're not born to be
experts at computing," Nass said.
"So if a computer program can be
social, people can automatically be
experts."
This idea was so attractive that
Microsoft and other computer com
panies showed an immediate inter
est in applying it to their products.
With the aid of Reeves and Nass,
Microsoft has created its manifesta
tion of SUI, inauspiciously named
Bob.
Bob looks like an ordinary house.
Or a castle. Or even an artsy New
York post-modern apartment,
"which I dislike intensely," Nass
said. The style depends on the pref
erences of the user; there are 12
characters from which to choose a
guide. "You can customize the room
style, character, even personality,"
Nass said.
Incredibly, Bob will have no
menus, no online help, and no
instruction manual ... no instruc
tion manual? "You can't get lost,"
said Nass. "Your character will pro
pose your four or five most common
programs if that happens. And
there's only one person to go to."
The preliminary reaction to Bob
has been very encouraging. "It's
radically different," Nass attested.
"Even Mac users thought it was eas
ier." Few can deny that the intuitive
dasign is certainly more helpful for
novices, and even experts have
praised the environment's novelty
and direct approach.
"When experienced users try out
new applications, our research has
shown that they find SUI more

effective than traditional inter
faces," Nass explained. Such users
become comfortable with SUI pro
grams much faster than with CLI or
GUI programs. "The interface
reflects fundamental social rules fol
lowed in regular daily life," he
added. "The characters behave like
a person would behave."
Microsoft had already discovered
that a character-based environment
would Ix 3 more effective than GUIs
and CLIs, but they had no system
atic understanding of the principles
behind SUIs.
"They had a project going, and
then [the designers] heard Byron
and I speak," Nass said. "They real
ized that we had the theory they
needed behind the product." The
Microsoft designers approached
Nass and Reeves later, and the pro
ject immediately benefited from
their research experience.
And Bill Gates is impressed
enough to take the researcher's
strategy even further than Bob's
development. Rather than introduc
ing Bob as a single program,
Microsoft plans to implement the
SUI philosophy into its Windows
line.
"Microsoft is more interested
than ever in the social interface,"
Nass said — as are a number of
other companies which have teamed
up with Nass and Reeves to form an
SUI consortium. In return for con
sulting with approximately 20 com
panies about the SUI and related
topics, Nass and Reeves "receive
funding for their basic research.
Other technologies that will be
integrated with SUI include inter

active television and database sys
tems. "It's extremely likely that
the Internet will have some [SUI]
front ends. I suspect it's eventual
ly going to appear in all communi
cation technologies," Nass predict
ed.
The evolution of the interfaces
seems to be heading towards a vir
tual reality (VR) type of platform.
"Certainly full-blown SUI would
mean a fully-intelligent, fully
social, fully-natural environment,"
Nass affirmed. "So that would
mean pure VR with the social and
intelligent additions. And I have no
prediction as to when that will be —
probably much later than anyone
thinks."
Nass is surprised by the results
and admits that they are somewhat
bizarre. "We find these experiments
unbelievable," he admitted. "We're
amazed that they work, because
they're so counterintuitive."
One might expect people to treat
computers as machines or house
hold appliances, but the relationship
turns out to be a bit more personal.
"People aren't aware that they do
this," Nass said. "Ask anyone if they
are social with computers, and
they'll say no."
Nass plans to continue working
with Microsoft after the March
release date of Bob.
He has studied various forms of
responses to media for almost a
decade, and computers are only a
subset of his research. "We're inter
ested in communication technolo
gies in general," he said, "not just
computers. They tend to be among
the most interesting, though."

Bob's Social Interface includes characters that converse' with the user and act as guides to the pro
gram. The 'home' environment offers a choice of room styles that can be altered to suit the user's taste.
Other programs and applications can be accessed through the rooms.
