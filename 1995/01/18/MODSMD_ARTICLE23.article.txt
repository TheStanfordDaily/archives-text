# Powder good for skis, harmful to snowballs

/"V* Have you ever tried
KY making a snowball to
hurl at a tempting target, but
the snow was so powdery that
it wouldn't stick together and
your perfect opportunity for
revenge slipped away? Why is
this?

A: Well, I just got back
from our house ski trip,
and believe me, I did plenty of
research on this subject. And
if you believe that, I have
some oceanf'ront property in
Tahoe to sell you. A foot of
fresh powder, eight foot base .
. . ah, the weary life of a sci
entist!

But, back to real
ity. Making a snow
ball is actually
more complicated
than you may think
( and hopefully you
don't really have to
think to do it).
Most people
think it is the
'stickiness' of the
water in the snow
that holds it togeth
er. But instead it's
a little thermody
namical quirk that
only works for

water and a few other sub
stances.
When you heat up most
substances, they expand;
when you cool them, they
contract.
However, water is peculiar
in the sense that when it
freezes, water actually
expands. This is why ice
cubes float, and bottles left in
the freezer explode.
But this relation actually
works in reverse also. By
putting pressure on frozen
water, you can make it
change from solid to liquid
states.
When water melts, it con
tracts. You can see this for
yourself by pressing down on
a piece of ice with a knife
blade; the pressure causes the
ice to melt, and the knife
slices right through the cube.
As you may have heard,
this is the principle behind ice

skating. When the ice under
the blade melts, it contracts
and leaves a little groove of
water for you to glide away on.
However, many people
think that the blade warms
up the ice to melt it, when in
fact it is simply the pressure
of the blade that melts it.
Even if the blade of your
skate were cold enough to
stick to your tongue, the pres
sure could still melt the ice.
And this is how you make a
snowball ( in case you forgot
the basic lessons of Revenge
101X). Take a large handful of
wet, relatively sticky snow,
and, since this is a friendly
battle, don't include any extra
ingredients like ice or rocks.
Then, if you're lucky and
you don't have the nroblem

described in this col
umn, you can press the
snowball into a com
pact sphere.
By pressing together
the snow, you actually
melt some of the
flakes, and when you
take the pressure off,
the snow refreezes. So
the individual flakes
have been melted
together into one giant
snowball.
There is one catch
however: the colder it
is, the more pressure

you need to melt the snow. So
if it's too cold, you're going to
need superhuman strength to
pack that powder into a snow
ball that will stick together.
If you're that strong, you
can probably throw it hard
enough so that it passes
through the atmosphere and
burns up on re-entry.
This is a also a problem for
ice skating. If it's too cold,
your body weight is not suffi
cient to melt the ice , and you
won't have that little groove
of water to slide on.
If it's that cold outside,
however, you're probably bet
ter off sitting inside, drinking
something warm and hoping
that there will be some nice
powder on the slopes.

Despite the rain, the bug is
still waiting for a 'flood' of
