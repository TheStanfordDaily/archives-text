# New surgical graft repair procedure reduces need for open-heart surgery
## 
### Sara Bhargava Contributing writer 
Doctors at Stanford Medical School have
recently developed a procedure which allows cor
rection of life-threatening blood vessel damage
without the pain and complexity of open chest
surgery.
The new procedure is designed to repair
aneurysms in the descending thoracic aorta, the
portion that flows downward through the chest.
By using a new device called a stent-graft, the
surgeon can fix the damage in a non-invasive
way.
"An aneuiysm is simply a weakening which
dilates the walls of a vessel like a balloon,"
explained Dr. Michael Dake. "The thinner walls
can then rupture, causing problems with bleed
ing." Dake, an assistant professor of radiology at
the Stanford School of Medicine, helped to devel
op the new procedure.
Dr. Charles Semba, assistant professor of
radiology, Dr. R. Scott Mitchell, associate profes
sor of cardiothoracic surgery, and Dr. Philip
Walker, a former vascular surgery fellow at Stan
ford, all helped Dake develop the procedure.
Ruptures caused by aneurysm are often fatal.
In fact, only 60 percent of patients with an
aneuiysm survive one year without medical
treatment. The survival rate after five years
drops to 20 percent.
Traditionally an aneurysm is corrected by
opening up the chest, resectioning the damaged
area of the vessel, and replacing it with a Dacron
— or synthetic fil)er — graft.
"What we did was take the same graft materi
al and stretched it over a stent," said Dake, who
co-directs Stanford's Catli/Angio Laboratory. "A
stent is a metallic framework used to buttress, or
keep the graft open."
The femoral artery is exposed through an inci
sion in the groin and"the stent graft is delivered
in a catheter [a tube|, which acts like a raceway or
conduit," Dake explained. The graft is then
secured to more normal vessel wall above and
below the damaged area and the tube is with
drawn.
A key to the device's function is the fact that
the stent is self-expanding. Its average size of 36
mm, or 1.5 inches, can be compressed to a size of
just over half an inch. The graft is custom-made
to fit the patient's damaged vessel area Once the
graft is delivered to the aneurysm site the stent
expands to its full size.
"Because the graft is so snugly secured, blood
can only go through it," Dake said. "The
aneurysm therefore clots ofT and is isolated and
excluded from circulation."
The progress of the stent-graft as it moves
from the femoral artery to the aorta is followed
with X-ray pictures.
Along with the decreased pain and tension
which result from avoiding surgery, the
new procedure offers a much shorter average
recovery time. "You're out of the hospital on the
third day, as a rule," Dake explained. The cost
subsequently decreases as a result of the shorter
hospitalization period.
The aorta is one of the body's rruyor blood ves
sels; it exits from the heart and branches to all

parts of the body. The new procedure is designed
to correct damage in the thoracic descending
aorta Most aneurysms which occur in this region
are due to atherosclerotic weakening of the vessel.
The current surgical method of correcting
aneurysms involves a 12 percent mortality rate
which increases to over 50 percent when the
patient has other problems like congenital heart
failure. There is also a significant risk of other
complications such as a 5 or 6 percent incidence
of paraplegia; this occurs as a result of damage to
vessels of the spinal cord which emanate from the
descending aorta.
The new procedure seems to be as effective as
the current one. "We are hoping for survival
rates equal to or better than [those of] surgery,"
said Dake. In 34 patients who have undergone
the stent-grafl procedure in the past three years,
30 have recovered without complications.
The two procedures, however, are not com
plete substitutes. Most stent-grafl cases were
performed in patients who could not have
surgery due to factors such as heart problems,
previous open heart surgery, bad lungs or
marginal kidney function. Surgery would be too
risky in such cases.

"I had a thoracic aneurysm which I had
known about for a year, and I was not a good can
didate for an open chest procedure ... there was
a good chance of getting the thing fixed without
an invasive procedure," said Frank Bright, one
patient who had a stent-graft repair done in
September of last year.
"It went very well," he attested. "I'm feeling
fine."
When asked about prospective use of the
stent-graft, Dake predicted, "It will be used in the
future for aorta disease, certainly in patients not
amenable to standard surgery ... However, it is
still very early and results are limited," he
warned. "We don't know yet what long term
complications could be... we'll have to see what
the future brings."
It is possible that this type of procedure may
be extended to damage in other areas of the
aorta. What is needed to advance beyond current
limitations is a device that is more flexible, Dake
explained; the flexibility would allow it to round
the curve of the aorta, which Dake likened to a
candy cane.
The stent-graft method follows the trend in
medicine toward less invasive procedures.
