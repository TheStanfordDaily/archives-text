## Out searching for justice Men's volleyball seeks return to Final Four after last year's rebuff by NCAA committee 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
Last year they were robbed.
Second-ranked Stanford men's
volleyball, not to mention the rest
of the nation, was shocked to see an
unranked Ball State team slip away
with the 1994 NCAA Final Four
wild-card selection.
With a cumulative 20-9 record
and a league title under its belt, the
Cardinal squad was the odds-on
favorite to enter the Final Four and
challenge No. 1 UCLA for the title.
Instead, Stanford spikers spent the
last days of spring at home, forced
to wait for another chance at that
elusive national championship.
This year they want to set the
record straight.
"I expect to win the national
championship this year, and if we
don't I'll be disappointed," said
sophomore Matt Fuerbringer. "I
think as a young team it's impor
tant that we learn how to win
championships, and this year we
have the talent to do just that."
"Talent" might be an under
statement when referring to this
team of predominantly sophomore
and freshmen /Ml-American candi
dates.
After graduating most of its vet
eran core last season, Stanford is
left with only three upperclassmen
around whom those first- and sec
ond-year starters will build.
Leading the way will be opposite
hitter Fuerbringer, who is coming
off of an Ail-American performance
last season, in addition to being
named Freshman of the Year by
Volleyball Monthly. Second in the

nation with 7.13 kills per game,
Fuerbringer figures to sustain his
explosive offensive output this year
and to work on refining some other
aspects of his game as well.

'I expect to win the
national champion
ship this year.'
— Matt Fuerbringer

This season Stanford switched
from the three-hitter to the four
hitter offense and Fuerbringer will
be called upon to pass and block
more often when playing at the net.
"There are some things that I
can be 10 times better at," Fuer
bringer said. "I want to become
more consistent in my defense and
passing and just improve my all
around skills."
Joining Fuerbringer on the
offensive front will be junior swing
hitter Mike Lambert, another All-
American honoree from last sea
son.
Second on the team with 679 kills,
which works out to 6.12 per game
(ninth in the nation), Lambert
complements Fuerbringer as the
two biggest offensive threats on the
Cardinal team.
"Mike and I have the job of com
ing up with the big side-outs and
taking advantage of the big scoring
opportunities," Fuerbringer said.
"Being spectacular on the court is
great, but being consistent is a lot
more important on such a young
team."
The youth on this second

ranked Stanford squad is apparent
in rookie swing hitter Aaron Gar
cia, who will be starting his first
home game today against Rutgers.
Used mainly in a defensive capacity
last year, Garcia has made the
change from back-row specialist to
become an important offensive
component this season.
In addition to his hitting duties,
Garcia will assume responsibility
for receiving serve and making
passes to the setter, an offensive
transition Stanford struggled to
keep consistent last season.
Up front, the Cardinal will be
loaded with talent this year. With
the arrival of freshman Keenan
Whitehurst, the middle blocking
position has become the deepest
position on the team.
A U.S. Junior National Team
member for the last three years,
Whitehurst was a highly-touted
recruit for coach Ruben Nieves.
Since then, Whitehurst has
matured from a relatively untested
commodity into a solid defensive
asset, capable of winning a starting
assignment on Stanford's talent
laden squad.
Teaming up with Whitehurst
will be second-year starter Michael
Hoefer. Hoefer finished eighth in
the nation in blocks per game at
1.68 last year. This season, he will
become the fourth man in Stan
ford's new offensive format and add
another threat from behind the 10-
foot line.
"Using four hitters allows us
more options this year," Hoefer
said. "Because we're more power

squad.
ful, we'll create more confusion
for the other teams trying to
defend all our hitters."
And finally, dishing out the
sets and coordinating all four
pistons in this offensive
machine will be rookie setter
Stewart Chong. Playing behind
four-time All-American Canyon
Ceman last season, Chong won
the starting position with an
impressive 275-assist perfor
mance (fifth-best for a career at
Stanford) coming off the bench.
"With all the big guns hitting
I'm just going to try and give
them the swings that they
want," Chong said. "They're
talented hitters and we'll get a
lot done this season if I just feed
the hot hands during the
games."
As the conductor of this
offense, Chong emphasized that
there is still a lot of refining to
do because this team is so
young. "At this point, we're still
getting used to each other and
trying to build that team chem
istry," he said. "The telling sign
is how we play in our first
match. That'll indicate to us
how much we still have to
improve."
Prior to tonight's game
against Rutgers, Stanford has
faced three other opponents
thus far in 1995. At the Santa
Cruz Tournament last week
end, the Cardinal came away
the winner against California
(15-12, 17-15, 15-6), UC-Santa
Cruz (15-11, 15-11, 15-10) and
University of the Pacific (15-4,
15-10, 15-12).
Tonight's match-up against
Rutgers will be the team's first
official game of the season. The
contest will take place at Burn
ham Pavilion beginning at 7
p.m.
"It's important to come out
and set the tone for the season,"
Fuerbringer said. "Last year we
didn't do a great job of putting
away matches against teams we
should have beaten easily, and
we're going to improve on that.
The motivation is definitely
there [tonight], especially with
some of the starters playing in
their first home games ever."

Although veterans like four-time All-American Canyon Ceman are
gone, Stanford still has its sights on a national title.
