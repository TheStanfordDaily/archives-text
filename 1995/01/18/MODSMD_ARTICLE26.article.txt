# Fencers score points at USF tournament
## Two athletes solidify bids for positions on Pan American team 
### Jason Weintraub 
Men's fencing coach Zoran
Tulum acknowledges that
Stanford faces a competitive
disadvantage against other
schools because the University
does not offer scholarships to
fencers coming out of high
school. Nonetheless, Tulum
and women's coach Sherry
Posthumus continue to field
successful teams year after
year, as evidenced by Stan
ford's strong performance in a
United States Fencing Associa
tion circuit event held this past
weekend in San Francisco.
In the women's epee divi
sion, junior Morgan Hoch led
Stanford with a top-32 finish in
a field of over 150. After fenc
ing well enough in six round
robin bouts to advance out of
pool competition, Hoch sur
vived several rounds of single

elimination bouts to reach the
top 32. There the format
changed to double elimination,
and Hoch found herself com
peting against two members of
the United States National
Team. She gave her opponents
a run for their money, however,
losing both bouts by a 15-14
score.
"Morgan fenced extremely
well," Tulum said.
Junior Stephanie Wien and
sophomore Laura Smith also
turned in successful perfor
mances in the epee division.
Both advanced out of pool play
and lost in single-elimination
competition. Tulum noted that
Wien is still recovering from a
knee operation and is perform
ing well despite the injury.
Smith, recruited out of a Stan
ford P.E. fencing class, "fenced
remarkably well considering her
lack of experience," Tulum said.
"Most fencers cannot be success
ful right away, and her perfor
mance is a tribute to her talent."
In the men's epee division,
senior Doug Vanderbilt and
sophomore Chris Connell placed
in the event's top 80 after advanc
ing to the single-elimination
round of competition. Tulum said
that Vanderbilt and Connell, who
are also former P.E. students,
"did an excellent job considering
their lack of 'street-fighting expe
rience.'"
Freshman sensation Sean
McClain took sixth place out of
220 fencers in the men's foil divi
sion. As a result of this and other
recent performances, McClain

ranks third on the national point
list and has qualified for the team
that will represent the United
States at the upcoming Pan
American Games.
Meanwhile, senior Geoff Don
aker finished in the division's top
32. Tulum praised Donaker's per
formance, noting that the team
captain sat out all of last year
while studying in Germany.
Members of the Stanford fenc
ing club also competed in San
Francisco. The club is comprised
of Stanford graduates and stu
dents from other schools who
wish to take advantage of Stan
ford's superior coaching and
brand-new fencing facility in
Roble gym.
In women's foil, Jennifer
Posthumus, daughter of Sherry
Posthumus, advanced to the final
round of eight and took fifth
place. Her performance placed
her sixth on the U.S. point list,

meaning that one more strong
result will put her into the
nation's top four and qualify her
for the Pan American Games.
In men's foil, '94 graduate
Nick Brevin, a three-time NCAA
champion and member of the U.S.
Olympic Team, won the division.
Also finishing in the top four was
club member Josh Stauffer. Near
ly all of the club's members placed
in the top 32 at either the senior
(20 years old and above) or junior
level. In men's epee, Tris Thomp
son finished seventh in a field of
256 competitors that included
fencers from six foreign coun
tries.
With results like these,
Tulum predicts a USFA national
championship for the men's
team this year. After another
year of good recruiting, he
argues, "we can be NCAA
champs in two years."
All this without scholarships.
