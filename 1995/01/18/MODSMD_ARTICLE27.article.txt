Stanford men's tennis
returned to its dominating style
last weekend in Seattle, seizing
four championship titles out of
a possible six in its first confer
ence trial at the 1995 Pacific 10
Conference Men's Indoor Ten
nis Tournament.
Junior Grant Elliott played
a role in two of the four, cap
turing the singles title as he
prevailed over teammate and
last year's champion Ricky
Becker 6-4, 6-4 in the third
flight final. Elliott, again in the
third flight, helped secure the
doubles crown as he and team
captain Jeff Salzenstein
downed Tsolak Govorkian and
Paul Reben of Arizona State by
a final score of 4-6, 6-1, 6-2.
The Cardinal teamed up to
sweep the doubles competition
as it proved its worth in the top
two Hights as well. Freshmen
sensations Scott Humphries
and Paul Goldstein again
reigned as champions, extend

streak to three.
"We feel pretty good playing
with each other," Humphries

said. "Things seem to be click
ing, and we've won some
matches over tough teams."
The young stars eliminated
Bret Hansen and Adam Peter
son of USC in the final match
5-7, 6-4, 6-4.
Head coach Dick Gould took
pride in the Cardinal's doubles
play. "It was a real solid effort
not only to get to all of the dou
bles finals but to win all of
them as well."
Stanford's fourth title came
as a result of the impressive
play of Becker and junior Jim
Thomas in the second flight as
they defeated Loren Peters and
Eric Taino of UCLA. Becker
and Thomas withstood a 4-6
setback in the first set in order
to turn the match around for a
4-6, 6-4, 7-5 victory.
"The thing to me that's
most impressive is the play of
Jimmy Thomas, Ricky Becker
and Grant Elliott," Gould said.
The three juniors won a total
of 16 matches over the week
end. Despite a tough first
round singles exit, Thomas
continued to turn heads as he
did with two upset victories in
