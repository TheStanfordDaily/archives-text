The Stanford wrestling team finished its
open tournament season in style last Satur
day, placing six athletes in the top four at
the Aggie Open at UC-Davis. Riding the
momentum from that finish, the Cardinal
will travel to San Francisco State tonight in
its third dual meet of the year.
"I'm very pleased with how we did," said
head coach Chris Horpel. "Our team perfor
mance moved up a couple of notches. It was
a much tougher tournament this year."
Junior co-captain Jimmy Aguirre, in his
second competition of the season, captured
the 134 lbs. division and junior Matt Cano
prevailed in the 126 lbs. division for his sec
ond consecutive title. Cano won the Coun
try Classic on Jan. 8. at Cal State Bakers

field.
"Ever since the break, I've been
wrestling well . . . and with more energy,"
Cano said.
Junior Tod Surmon, who also wrestled in
his second competition of the year, finished
second at 150 lbs. Sophomore 150-pounder
Ryan Barnes and junior 167-pounder Mark
Ryzewicz both finished third in their
respective divisions.
"Ryzewicz was a pleasant surprise," Hor
pel said. "He wrestled well for the competi
tion."
The redshirt freshmen also looked very
impressive, according to Horpel. Van Young
was one win from placing in the top four in
the 158 lbs. category and 142-pounders
Doug Bardsley and B.J. Sanchez won a cou
ple of bouts.
The only disappointing performances

came from senior co-captain Jay Jackson
and sophomore Bryan Vaniman. Jackson
took fourth at 134 lbs. and Vaniman failed
to place in the 190 lbs. division.
"I had an oil; suid.,." Every
one is going to have them." Jackson was
probably looking ahead to his expected
match with Aguirre, according to Horpel.
Aguirre's victory in the 134 lbs. weight
class means that he will wrestle at that
weight tonight and Jackson will be bumped
up to 142. In addition, as Cano sprained his
knee in the semifinals at the Aggie Open,
118-pound sophomore By Pham may be
forced to wrestle at 126 against the Gators.
The two wrestlers competing at higher
weights will put the Cardinal at a slight dis
advantage, according to Horpel. "Jay
