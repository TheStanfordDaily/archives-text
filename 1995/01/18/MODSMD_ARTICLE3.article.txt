# Administrators earn praise for cleaner EV
## Residents look for long-term commitment 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Long the target of criticism from resident
graduate students and their families, ad
ministrators responsible for overseeing Es
condido Village are starting to hear some
thing new — praise.
The situation in Escondido "has changed
dramatically," said resident Amber McLain,
a member of a committee created in October
to work on solutions to Escondido's mainte
nance and cleanliness problems.
The group of residents and administra
tors, which met once in December, will con
tinue to meet regularly, according to Assoc.
Dir. of Housing and Dining Services Rodger
Whitney, another member.

"I would like to keep the committee con
vened ... in an ongoing, advisory way,"
Whitney said.
In response to suggestions, a number of
apartments in Escondido were cleaned be
tween fall and winter quarters using ex
panded guidelines to improve results.
"We did nearly 100 turnovers over winter
break because we didn't want to wait until
next fall," said Whitney, who called the work
a "dry run"for this summer, when mainte
nance crews will work on several hundred
more apartments.
He explained that the task was divided
into three steps: maintenance repairs, gen
eral cleaning and an "updated standardized
inspection process" which was
"followed religiously."
Whitney added that Housing
and Dining Services is "trying not
to rely on outside contractors,"
but rather to use more in-house
personnel to improve service in
graduate residences. This winter,
cleaning staff from undergradu
ate dorms participated in the
turnovers, he said.
Earlier this quarter, the
"clean-up committee" — officially
known as the Escondido Village
Operations Review Group — was
taken on a tour of some of the
cleaned apartments.
"The apartments that I saw . .
. looked great," McLain said.
"The system that they have
going right now seems to be
working."
"The apartments we looked at
all looked pretty good," agreed
Todd Whitehurst, an Escondido
resident assistant and member of
the review group.
"They created a substantial
checklist of items ... so there's
no ambiguity any more as to
what has to be cleaned. Thev cer

tainly seem committed to keep
up this level of cleanliness," he
said.
But Escondido residents on
the committee were quick to
point out that much remains to
be done.
"I think they're more willing
to listen . . . now," said Kathy
Eisenhut. "I think they have a
long way to go. . . . The true test
is how they do in the long run."
Eisenhut explained that she
felt there were still problems with
communication between adminis
trators concerning what is being
accomplished. "I think Rodger
Whitney is a really great guy [but]
I think now ... he is going to have
to check personally over the
work."
She added that a number of
problems still plague some Escon
dido apartments, including walls
that need repainting and outside
areas that "still look like
garbage."
Still, Eisenhut pointed out
that Escondido is trying to create
a better atmosphere for new resi
dents by leaving a box of choco
lates with a letter about mainte
nance standards in their apart
ments.
"I was really happy with that,"
she said. "It's very welcoming."
