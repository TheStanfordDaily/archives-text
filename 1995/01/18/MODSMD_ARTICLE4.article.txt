The Clinton Administration moved yes
terday to strengthen its foreign policy team
by appointing Political Science Prof. Coit
Blacker to the National Security Council,
effective Feb. 15.
"I'm excited and certainly challenged by
this opportunity," Blacker said. "It's a
tremendously exciting time to be asked to
work on this portfolio."
Blacker, currently the deputy director of
Stanford's Institute for International Stud
ies, will be special assistant to the president
for national security affairs and senior di
rector for Russian, Ukrainian, and

Eurasian affairs.
He will replace Nicholas Burns, who is
moving to the State Department as
spokesman and principal deputy assistant
secretary of state for public affairs.
In his new position, Blacker will be re
sponsible for "assisting the president in
conducting his constitutional responsibility
of foreign policy and coordinating the na
tional security community" on matters re
lating to the former Soviet Union, said
Calvin Mitchell, White House assistant
press secretary for foreign affairs.
"He will advise the president as neces
sary in meetings and correspondence with
foreign leaders," Mitchell said.
Blacker will also travel with
the president during trips to the
former Soviet Union and to meet
ings with leaders from this area,
Mitchell added.
As he looks toward his new job,
Blacker said he hopes to "con
tribute to the continuing positive
development of U.S.-Russian
relations and maintenance of the
cooperative relationship."
Recent developments in Russia
may present some difficulties in
the relationship, however.
"The crisis in Chechnya is a
major challenge to the Yeltsin
government. I hope they succeed
in navigating through [the crisis].
It will certainly affect U.S.-Rus
sian relations," Blacker said. "On
our side there is considerable
unease with and confusion about
policies toward Russia and
Ukraine."
The Republican-controlled
Congress could also pose prob
lems, Blacker said. "I hope that
the U.S. policy toward Russia and
Ukraine doesn't fall victim to par
tisan politics. The administration

has done a good job of developing
policy that is non-partisan, but I
anticipate challenges to the poli
cy. There will be especially close
scrutiny of U.S. foreign aid pro
grams," he said.
But as exciting as his new posi
tion promises to be, Blacker said
he will miss Stanford a great deal.
"I'm unhappy to be leaving Stam
ford. I will miss the intellectual
community, my friends and col
leagues on the faculty, and the
students, both undergraduates
and graduates, who keep me on
my toes, Blacker said. "No other
place [can compare to] Stanford
in creating a sense of intellectual
ism."
"I will also miss the freedom to
allocate my time as I see fit," he
added.
Blacker expects to return to
Stanford after his leave of
absence is over, however, even if
Clinton is re-elected. "I fully
expect to be back on the job with
in two years," he said.
Walter Falcon, director of the
Institute for International Stud
ies, said that Blacker's absence
"will leave a hole in Stanford.
He is a fine teacher and admin
istrator," Falcon said. "The
whole University will miss
him."
