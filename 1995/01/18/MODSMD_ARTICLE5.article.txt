# Raising funds for the amendment election...
## COP to keep discretionary funds out of campaign for special-fee reform bill 
### Justin Pollard Staff writer 
After a week of pressure from several
ASSU senators, the Council of Presidents
has decided not to use its discretionary
funds to campaign for the passage of a spe
cial-fee reform bill which will be put to a stu
dent election next week.
The COP's decision comes after mem
bers of the ASSU Senate discovered a por
tion of the ASSU Bylaws which says that the
COP could only use discretionary funds if
opponents of the bill had "equal access to
those resources," among other provisions.
Instead, the COP will raise its own funds
to support the campaign for the special-fee
reform bill, said COP member Mork Mur
dock.

The bill, which requires
a two-thirds may'ority in the
upcoming election for pas
sage, would amend the
ASSU constitution to elim
inate the fee-refund system
and split undergraduates
and graduates into sepa
rate communities for fee
voting.

It would also cap the
total amount of fees that could be placed on
the ballot, subject to senate approval, and
prevent fees from going toward political or
religious activities.
"We're raising our own private funds
from individual donors who are supportive
of the campaign," Murdock said. "We will
probably end up with around $300 or so," he

said, which will go toward
photocopying enough
fliers to reach the whole
campus. According to the
ASSU Bylaws, campaign
ing for or against the bill
can begin next Wednesday.
"The bylaws definitely
said that if you were going
to use ASSU resources, the
opposition must have ac-

cess" to those resources, Murdock said.
"It was nice to see that the COP stepped
back on this issue," said junior Steve Rus
sell, one of the senators who discovered the
bylaw, "but I've got to cay that myself and a
few other senators are getting sick of
babysitting the COP. It would be nice if it
didn't take four angry senators and a Daily

article to get the COP to follow the rules of a
document they are sworn to uphold."
"I think its a lot more fair" that the COP
not use its discretionary funds on the cam
paign, said computer science graduate stu
dent Donald Aingworth, another senator
who opposed the COP's plans. "I guess they
realized what the constitution says."
Aingworth also said he thought $300
sounded "excessive" for this type of cam
paign. "That's a lot of money to spend on a
campaign," he said. "I don't even know how
they're going to spend that much."
Opponents of the special-fee reform bill
will also be mounting a campaign against
the bill, Aingworth said, although he did not
know where they would get funding, other

than from their own pockets.
"I think it will be a lot harder
for us to fund raise, but it's
probably not going to be a big
deal," Aingworth said. "We'll
have to spend maybe $10 or $20
(on photocopying) and we'll do
the legwork" of posting fliers.

The limit on campaign spend
ing for a COP campaign is $300,
and $60 for senate campaigns,

Aingworth said.
Murdock said the COP decid
ed to endorse the special-fee
reform bill because "we believe
that the current fee system has
had major problems over the
past several years. The proposal
really balances the needs of
undergraduates, graduates, and
student groups."
The bill's opponents, howev
er, maintain that the new sys
tem will create more problems
than it solves. "The main reason
why I oppose the bill is that it
will result in higher fees to stu
dents and reduced services, espe
cially to graduate students,"

Aingworth said.
The bill "increases the power
of the ASSU and the senate and
takes power away from the stu
dents," he added. "This is just a
big power grab by the ASSU."
The official text of the bill,
entitled "The Balanced Funding
Deal," will be provided by the
ASSU Election Commission in
the election handbook, which
should be released next Monday,
Murdock said. The handbook
will also contain arguments for
and against the bill, a summary
of the bill and a financial state
ment from the ASSU financial
manager.
