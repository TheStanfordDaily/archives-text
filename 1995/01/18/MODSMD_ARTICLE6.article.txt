# 'Making them feel special and involved as human beings'
## Volunteers aid elderly patients 
### Dalia Azim 
Though Stanford's United Students for Veter
ans Health network is dedicated to helping a pop
ulation who is no longer able to help themselves,
volunteers agree that they are often the ones
touched most by the program.
About 80 student volunteers provide much
needed social interactions with the patients — el
derly veterans who suffer from Alzheimer's or
other physically debilitating diseases. Sometimes
volunteers just color or toss balloons. At other
times they hold lucid conversations with the pa
tient, depending on their condition, senior Vance
Vanier said.
"It's almost as if we're playing with children,"
said Vanier, the campus' USVH program director.
Vanier founded the Stanford program last
spring, excited about getting volunteers "with a
willingness and desire to help out."
And the response to helping Alzheimer's and
geriatrics patients at two Veterans Affairs hospitals
— one in Menlo Park and one in Palo Alto — has
been "just fantastic," Vanier said.

Senior Vance Vanier volunteers with geriatric patients at a local Veterans Hospital.
He recalls an incident which
reaffirmed his faith in his volun
teerism.
One patient never spoke except
to repeat others. Vanier remem
bered making a breakthrough
when he asked if the patient need
ed any help, and the patient sur
prisingly responded, "Yes, I need
a lot of help."
Patients need the help of vol
unteers to interact with them on
a personal level. VAs are typically
understaffed and have nurses
who can only attend to the
patients' physical needs, Vanier
said.
He added that helping the vet
erans at these wards is a way to
"give back to a group of people
who helped us before we were
born."
"When volunteering, we go in
and socially interact with the
patients, making them feel special
and involved as human beings."
For some students, volunteer
ing has spurred a desire to do
more for Alzheimer's and geri
atrics patients.
"fThe program] opened my
eyes as far as confirming my
belief in that there needs to be
more medical research done in
the field of Alzheimer's," said
freshman Sarah Reseburg, a
prospective pre-med major.
Not only do volunteers help

the patients, but the patients help
the volunteers as well.
Senior Justin Mohatt
explained that "from the interac
tions with the patients I realized
how valuable it was to them and
how much they have to teach,"
adding that the first time he
walked into the geriatrics ward
someone asked him, "What do
you think of Plato's theory of
man's soul?"
"These stories are another rea
son why volunteers come back,"
Vanier said.
Vanier talked about three dif
ferent types of people who volun
teer: the pre-med students look
ing for experience with patients,
community service-oriented peo
ple looking to contribute to veter
ans and the elderly, and those
who are simply curious about the
program.
Vanier said the program looks
for "energetic people with a dedi
cation to go each week" when
selecting volunteers. Most central
is the social support group the
volunteers form with each other.
"Sometimes you walk out of
there with delightful stories to
share with [other volunteers] who
understand," Vanier said.
For example, Mohatt and
senior Liza Rothschild discussed
the debate between two patients,
Bob and Leslie: Bob, who claims
he's "99 percent atheist," and
Leslie, a devout Catholic, often
debate religion for the volun
teers. Talking about these experi
ences with other volunteers

builds strong relationships,
Vanier said.
Students' continued dedica
tion to the program has
impressed Joni Drobeck, head
nurse at the Menlo Park VA.
"It's great to see so many
young people who really care
about giving something back . . .
it really says something about
where our young people today are
going," she said.
Programs like this are spread
ing, Vanier said. This quarter
Vanier and the rest of the Stan
ford group of volunteers have
worked on expanding the pro
gram to other campuses. In Jan
uary there will be similar pro
grams on 10 other campuses,
including Duke University and
UCLA.
"The speed in which we've
been able to get thus together at
other campuses gives us an idea
of how valuable this program is,"
Vanier said.
He added that USVH is con
stantly searching for other
schools interested in doing this
work.
Many of the volunteers
stressed that the most important
thing to understand is that these
patients have very real lives, and
it's easy to forget that they were
young once.
"It's sometimes easy to disas
sociate yourself from a patient
and then think this could be me,"
Vanier said. "It's very striking to
see how people can age and
change."
