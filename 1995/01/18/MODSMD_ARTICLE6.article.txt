## Volunteers aid elderly patients 
### Dalia Azim 
Though Stanford's United Students for Veter
ans Health network is dedicated to helping a pop
ulation who is no longer able to help themselves,
volunteers agree that they are often the ones
touched most by the program.
About 80 student volunteers provide much
needed social interactions with the patients — el
derly veterans who suffer from Alzheimer's or
other physically debilitating diseases. Sometimes
volunteers just color or toss balloons. At other
times they hold lucid conversations with the pa
tient, depending on their condition, senior Vance
Vanier said.
"It's almost as if we're playing with children,"
said Vanier, the campus' USVH program director.
Vanier founded the Stanford program last
spring, excited about getting volunteers "with a
willingness and desire to help out."
And the response to helping Alzheimer's and
geriatrics patients at two Veterans Affairs hospitals
— one in Menlo Park and one in Palo Alto — has
been "just fantastic," Vanier said.
