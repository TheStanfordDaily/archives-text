# The 						war in Chechnya:
## Profs condemn Russian actions 
### Burt Herman Staff writer 
As the death toll in the Russian region of Chechnya
climbs into the thousands, Stanford professors who are
experts in the politics of the area have roundly con
demned the Russian government's use of force, while
hoping it does not mean the end of democracy in the
country.
"I think there's no question (Russian President Boris
N. Yeltsin] made a mistake," said History Prof. Norman
Naimark. "You simply cannot solve problems like that
with force of arms."
Russian troops were sent into the so-called "break
away republic" on Dec. 11 to crush a three-year inde
pendence attempt by Chechnya, a republic in the Russ
ian Caucasus Mountains made up of 1.2 million mostly
Muslim people.
"Once the fighting turned out to be long-term and
bloody, [Yeltsin] should have stopped â€” but he did
not," said Prof. Gregory Freidin, chair of the Slavic De
partment.
Yeltsin has come under criticism by the internation
al community for his use of force in the internal conflict.
Accusations that he is no longer in control of the im
mense Russian military complex have also marred the
country's move towards democracy.
"There's a great deal of disorga
nization and chaos," Naimark said.
"A lot of time, orders do not get
translated into action or get coun
termanded."
The seeming inability of
Western governments to come up
with a quick response in the
Chechen crisis is also an issue of
concern.
"What is disturbing to me is we
continue to support Yeltsin as long
as he moves in the direction of
democratic reforms," said History
Prof. Alexander Dallin. "There
haven't been any democratic
reforms this year."
With the country's second presi
dential election scheduled for 1996,
the Cheychen situation could deter
mine whether Yeltsin will survive
or even choose to run again in the
midst of the current political cli
mate.
"Is it true that (Yeltsin) is the
most unpopular man in Russia
today?" said History Prof. Terence
Emmons. "God only knows what
can happen between now and the
elections."
"Yeltsin's popularity is lower
than it has ever been," Dallin said.
"It is hard to think of a country

which has used this degree of force
against its own citizens."
A possible step toward ending
the crisis was taken yesterday,
though, when Russian Prime Min
ister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin gave
a speech on national television urg
ing cease-fire negotiations. A cease
fire proposed by the Russians earli
er this month ended in gunfire only
a couple hours after it supposedly
began.
Freidin said this move could
make Chernomyrdin a front-run
ner for president in the 1996 elec
tions. "He has proved himself to be
able to talk to everybody" in the
cluttered Russian political climate,
he said, where parties span the ide
ological spectrum from nationalists
to monarchists to democrats.
Regardless of the authoritarian
implication of Yeltsin's aggressive
military policy towards the
Chechen people, professors still
hope that Russia is moving away
from its Stalinist legacy.
"Russia has passed the test of a
new democracy," Freidin said.
Emmons also agreed that
there is still hope for the strug
gling former superpower. "Is it
true that Yeltsin's government
has fallen into the hands of
nationalists? I hope not," he said.
"I don't want to write the death
warrant for the chances of democ
racy in Russia."
