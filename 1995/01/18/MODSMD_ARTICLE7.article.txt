# The
						war in Chechnya:
## Profs condemn Russian actions 
### Burt Herman Staff writer 
As the death toll in the Russian region of Chechnya
climbs into the thousands, Stanford professors who are
experts in the politics of the area have roundly con
demned the Russian government's use of force, while
hoping it does not mean the end of democracy in the
country.
"I think there's no question (Russian President Boris
N. Yeltsin] made a mistake," said History Prof. Norman
Naimark. "You simply cannot solve problems like that
with force of arms."
Russian troops were sent into the so-called "break
away republic" on Dec. 11 to crush a three-year inde
pendence attempt by Chechnya, a republic in the Russ
ian Caucasus Mountains made up of 1.2 million mostly
Muslim people.
"Once the fighting turned out to be long-term and
bloody, [Yeltsin] should have stopped â€” but he did
not," said Prof. Gregory Freidin, chair of the Slavic De
partment.
Yeltsin has come under criticism by the internation
al community for his use of force in the internal conflict.
Accusations that he is no longer in control of the im
mense Russian military complex have also marred the
country's move towards democracy.
