INFINITY:
The
career
you knew
was out there
The entrepreneurial adventure of a lifetime.
At Infinity, you won't be just a cog in the machine. You
won't be maintaining someone else's code. You won't be
in a "training program". You won't sit in front of a Lotus
spreadsheet for two years. And your ideas won't get lost
in a complex bureaucracy.
What you will do is meet major challenges head on.
You'll be a key member of our core development team
building state-of-the-art object-oriented trading systems
for the world's leading financial institutions. You'll have
responsibility for major projects from conception to
completion. You'll have the opportunity to work along
side top developers who will answer your questions and
listen to your ideas. You'll gain international business
experience by helping to capture market share in major
financial centers like New York, London, Tokyo and
Toronto.
AND ... you'll hold an equity position.
