MCAT Success Stories
'
"In order to prepare for the MCAT, I took one of the 'intensive'
review courses. Unfortunately, my scores were very
disappointing. I decided to take the MCAT again, but this time
my friend convinced me to turn to Kaplan for help. Medical
schools told me that it would take a 'miracle' to
increase my science scores by four points with
only two and a half months of studying. With
the help of Kaplan, my scores increased
dramatically. Kaplan has helped me get one
step closer to pursuing my dream of becoming
a doctor. Kaplan is the only way to go. Don't
waste your time with other preparatory
courses." S.S. Hayward, CA
