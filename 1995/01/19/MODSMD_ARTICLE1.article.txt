## Carville takes on politics, the GOP and mass media 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Outside the public eye, James
Carville might not seem the kind
of man who could spearhead a
campaign for the most powerful
elective office in the world.
"This campus is beautiful," he
said quietly last night, walking
outside Memorial Auditorium
after delivering a rousing speech
to more than 1,000 students.
And when questioned about his
bag full of his papers which promi
nently displayed an advertisement
for Cincinnati-style chili, he
smiled and replied matter-of-fact
ly, "I bought it at the airport."
But in the spotlight, Carville
— who masterminded President
Clinton's 1992 campaign — de
livered students a performance
marked by intensely partisan
criticism and his self-styled
"country bumpkin" humor.
"I'm the only college kick-out
that'll ever come here to speak,"
said Carville, who claimed that
the biggest industry in his home
town of Carville, Louisiana, was
jury duty. "Some of you have IQs
bigger than my SAT score."
But humor aside, he showed
himself to be just as confident dis
cussing the new Republican ma
jority in Congress as he is talking
about the politics of one student's
hometown in central Georgia.
In addition, Carville used his
hour-and-a-half to attack the
media for misrepresenting facts,
vehemently defend President
Clinton's record and answer a
salvo of students' questions on
topics ranging from the 1994
elections to conservative talk

show host Rush Limbaugh.
"How many people know that
President Clinton got a haircut
in Los Angeles and held up air
craft," he asked. "Eighteen times
they print it in The Washington
Post. . . what the hell difference
does it make whether it's true or
not?"
Citing this and other examples,
Carville admonished students to
"be careful about how you get
news and how you digest it."

He also criticized the move by
many Republicans in govern
ment to reform or eliminate wel
fare, calling on the audience to
help future generations expand
their opportunities.
"In this country, 44 percent of
the young people . . . earn below
the poverty line," he said, adding
that "60 percent [of people] are
earning less than they did 20

'I don't think you de
fine strength as
beating up on the
weak. I'm not doing
it. I'm going to fight.'

In a rousing talk some listeners found remniscent of a "political revival," political consultant James
Carville entertained a crowd of over 1,000 in Memorial Auditorium last night.
