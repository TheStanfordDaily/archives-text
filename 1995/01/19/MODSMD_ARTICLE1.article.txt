## Carville takes on politics, the GOP and mass media 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Outside the public eye, James
Carville might not seem the kind
of man who could spearhead a
campaign for the most powerful
elective office in the world.
"This campus is beautiful," he
said quietly last night, walking
outside Memorial Auditorium
after delivering a rousing speech
to more than 1,000 students.
And when questioned about his
bag full of his papers which promi
nently displayed an advertisement
for Cincinnati-style chili, he
smiled and replied matter-of-fact
ly, "I bought it at the airport."
But in the spotlight, Carville
— who masterminded President
Clinton's 1992 campaign — de
livered students a performance
marked by intensely partisan
criticism and his self-styled
"country bumpkin" humor.
"I'm the only college kick-out
that'll ever come here to speak,"
said Carville, who claimed that
the biggest industry in his home
town of Carville, Louisiana, was
jury duty. "Some of you have IQs
bigger than my SAT score."
But humor aside, he showed
himself to be just as confident dis
cussing the new Republican ma
jority in Congress as he is talking
about the politics of one student's
hometown in central Georgia.
In addition, Carville used his
hour-and-a-half to attack the
media for misrepresenting facts,
vehemently defend President
Clinton's record and answer a
salvo of students' questions on
topics ranging from the 1994
elections to conservative talk

show host Rush Limbaugh.
"How many people know that
President Clinton got a haircut
in Los Angeles and held up air
craft," he asked. "Eighteen times
they print it in The Washington
Post. . . what the hell difference
does it make whether it's true or
not?"
Citing this and other examples,
Carville admonished students to
"be careful about how you get
news and how you digest it."

He also criticized the move by
many Republicans in govern
ment to reform or eliminate wel
fare, calling on the audience to
help future generations expand
their opportunities.
"In this country, 44 percent of
the young people . . . earn below
the poverty line," he said, adding
that "60 percent [of people] are
earning less than they did 20

years ago.
"People in public policy tell us
the problem is people are on wel
fare," Carville said. "I remember
when we were declaring war on
poverty in this country. Now
we're declaring war on the poor."

1 think there's a pret
ty good chance that
the president's posi
tion will be stronger
going into the elec
tion year.'
—James Carville

He railed against Congression
al Republicans for opposing pro
grams which might aid the poor
while at the same time pursuing
measures he sees as dangerous.
"When the president proposed
[a plan] which would put money
into people's pockets, every
Republican opposed it," Carville
said. "We tried to raise the mini
mum wage to $5 [per hour] and
everyone opposed it."
Pointing to spending cuts in
the state of Virginia where he
currently lives, Carville told the
audience that his $40 tax savings
is not worth the loss of govern
ment programs which go to pur
chase library books and finance
medical services.
"[They're] going to reduce the
number of prescription drugs
available," he said. "That's for

$40.
"I don't think you define
strength as beating up on the
weak," he added. "I'm not doing
it. I'm going to fight."
Carville also chided Republi
cans for pursuing the Balanced
Budget Amendment. "They've
got a majority in the House and
Senate," he said. "[TheyJ
get up there and attack women,
attack gays, attack minorities. . ..
What's the problem? Step up to
the plate. Balance it."
Responding to students' ques
tions about whether the Republi
can majority will manage to enact
sweeping changes, Carville was
skeptical, "fin the election] peo
ple thought they had a quick fix
for the country," he said. "They
don't."
He admitted that the Republi
cans "kicked [the Democrats']
butts," refusing to lay the blame
on such scapegoats as talk radio.
"Rush Limbaugh is a very tal
ented man. . . . He's an incredible
entertainer," Carville said,
though he later referred to
"numerous" factual errors which
he said can been found in Lim
baugh's statements.
Although he conceded that the
Republicans have managed to
gain the upper hand in govern
ment, with his characteristic fer
vor, Carville exhorted the audi
ence not to count Clinton out.
"I think there's a pretty good
chance that the president's posi
tion will be stronger going into
the election year," he said, adding
that he is "just not comfortable
criticizing the president," even
though he no longer works for the
White House.
And as Carville prepared to
close his remarks, he couldn't
resist checking his armpits to
make sure he wasn't sweating too
much. "I get kind of excited," he
admitted.

In a rousing talk some listeners found remniscent of a "political revival," political consultant James
Carville entertained a crowd of over 1,000 in Memorial Auditorium last night.
years ago.
"People in public policy tell us
the problem is people are on wel
fare," Carville said. "I remember
when we were declaring war on
poverty in this country. Now
we're declaring war on the poor."

1 think there's a pret
ty good chance that
the president's posi
tion will be stronger
going into the elec
tion year.'

He railed against Congression
al Republicans for opposing pro
grams which might aid the poor
while at the same time pursuing
measures he sees as dangerous.
"When the president proposed
[a plan] which would put money
into people's pockets, every
Republican opposed it," Carville
said. "We tried to raise the mini
mum wage to $5 [per hour] and
everyone opposed it."
Pointing to spending cuts in
the state of Virginia where he
currently lives, Carville told the
audience that his $40 tax savings
is not worth the loss of govern
ment programs which go to pur
chase library books and finance
medical services.
"[They're] going to reduce the
number of prescription drugs
available," he said. "That's for

$40.
"I don't think you define
strength as beating up on the
weak," he added. "I'm not doing
it. I'm going to fight."
Carville also chided Republi
cans for pursuing the Balanced
Budget Amendment. "They've
got a majority in the House and
Senate," he said. "[TheyJ
get up there and attack women,
attack gays, attack minorities. . ..
What's the problem? Step up to
the plate. Balance it."
Responding to students' ques
tions about whether the Republi
can majority will manage to enact
sweeping changes, Carville was
skeptical, "fin the election] peo
ple thought they had a quick fix
for the country," he said. "They
don't."
He admitted that the Republi
cans "kicked [the Democrats']
butts," refusing to lay the blame
on such scapegoats as talk radio.
"Rush Limbaugh is a very tal
ented man. . . . He's an incredible
entertainer," Carville said,
though he later referred to
"numerous" factual errors which
he said can been found in Lim
baugh's statements.
Although he conceded that the
Republicans have managed to
gain the upper hand in govern
ment, with his characteristic fer
vor, Carville exhorted the audi
ence not to count Clinton out.
"I think there's a pretty good
chance that the president's posi
tion will be stronger going into
the election year," he said, adding
that he is "just not comfortable
criticizing the president," even
though he no longer works for the
White House.
And as Carville prepared to
close his remarks, he couldn't
resist checking his armpits to
make sure he wasn't sweating too
much. "I get kind of excited," he
admitted.
