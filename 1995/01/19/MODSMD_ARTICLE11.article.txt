## Death toll rises in Japan 
### 
KOBE, Japan (AP) â€” Some
hungry survivors got a single
rice ball, a makeshift morgue did
without coffins and hospitals
struggled to find antibiotics.
As the death toll topped 3,000
in Kobe's earthquake disaster,
thousands tried to flee what was
once a sleek and efficient city,
many of them bandaged as they
limped past huge piles of rubble
and collapsed buildings.
Raging fires that erupted
after Tuesday's quake had
mostly died out yesterday, leav
ing a gray pallor that height
ened the sense of dismay in the
city of 1.4 million.
Rescuers, often working with
bare hands, sifted through the
ruins looking for survivors. But
hopes faded with each passing
hour for the 870 people still list
ed as missing.
By early Thursday, Japanese
police reported that 3,021 peo
ple had been killed in the quake.
More than 14,500 were injured
and nearly 20,000 buildings
heavily damaged or destroyed.

Criticism mounted that
Japanese authorities, despite
their long experience with
earthquakes, were clearly
unprepared for a disaster of this
magnitude.
Japanese Self-Defense Forces
sent about 2,000 soldiers and 50
aircraft to the stricken city. But
it took more than four hours
even to begin mobilizing them.
Tokuichiro Tamazawa, chief
of the Defense Agency, blamed
the delay on local officials who
"hadn't thought of what should
be done."
"City officials didn't come
here at all, so we had to do
everything ourselves," com
plained Yukiji Matsui, a volun
teer running an evacuation cen
ter in suburban Nishinomiya,
where about 500 people had
taken shelter.
"We have people who are get
ting weaker and weaker," she
said. "We have sick people here,
but if we call an ambulance, if it
comes at all, it takes at least
four hours."

The flood of misery over
whelmed local hospitals, deplet
ing their supplies. Some of the
hospitals also were without
water and were relying on gen
erators for their electricity.
"Our only treatment now is
painkillers," said Dr. Toshihiko
Oi at a hospital in subruban
Ninomiya.
In Tokyo, the health ministry
said it would start sending
antiobiotics, bandages, blood
and other medical supplies by
helicopter to the area.
With most telephone links
down, authorities outside the
Kobe area were uncertain what
emergency supplies were need
ed. Huge traffic jams delayed
shipments of relief goods.
"You had a situation where
rescue efforts couldn't go for
ward because of traffic jams,"
Professor Hirotada Hirose of
Tokyo Women's University said.
"For example, ambulances
couldn't get through. It was an
unprecedented event, so all the
officials were confused."
