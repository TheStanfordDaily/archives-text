# Israel stalls on settlements

### 
JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Attempting to
defuse a crisis over Jewish settlements,
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin promised
yesterday that all new housing starts in
the occupied West Bank must get full
Cabinet approval.
Rabin made the pledge during a
meeting with his junior coalition part
ner, the liberal Meretz Party, which had
demanded a halt to all settlement con
struction and warned that peace talks
with the Palestinians were in danger.
"From now on, any act of construc
tion will need the approval of the full
Cabinet," Rabin's spokesman, Oded
Ben-Ami, told The Associated Press.
Ben-Ami could not say whether about
4,000 units currently under construc
tion in Jewish settlements in the West
Bank would be completed.
All new construction, including pri
vate building and infrastructure pro
jects, must now be approved by the Cab

inet, Ben-Ami said. In the past, a gov
ernment committee had approved such
building.
Meretz demanded the meeting with
Rabin after government and private
surveys showed more than 5,000 settle
ment housing units were approved for
1994-1995.
New figures also showed the settler
population increased by nearly 5 per
cent to 141,000 in 1994, despite a
November 1992 pledge by the govern
ment to freeze most settlement con
struction.
Meretz legislators complained that
Rabin had deceived them about the
extent of settlement activity, but they
stopped short of threatening to quit the
government. If Meretz's 12 legislators
quit the coalition, Rabin's government
would fall.
The Cabinet is to review settlement
policy on Sunday.
