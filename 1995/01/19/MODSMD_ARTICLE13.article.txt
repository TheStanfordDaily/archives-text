Children shot
ORIANDO, Fla. (AP) - Shot in the
neck and paralyzed, 11-year-old Adam
Fowler managed to roll off the bed â€” and
onto his dead mother. His sister, Jessica,
was able to crawl into the living room
despite a bullet in her neck.
For five days without food or water,
they called out feebly and tried to make
enough noise to attract neighbors' atten
tion. Adam banged on the wall with a
nonworking telephone. Jessica, 13, strug
gled to turn on the television full blast.
When they weren't making noise,
they prayed and encou raged each other
to hang on.
Finally, on Tuesday, they were discov
ered afler a concerned co-worker of the
mother called police.

Investigators determined that Carrie
Lee Rhodes, 38, had shot her children
with a ,357-caliber Magnum in a bed
room of their rented house, then killed
herself with the gun.
Mrs. Rhodes, a nurse, left a note say
ing she was depressed over a failed love
affair and numerous money problems,
Sgt. Mike Holloway, a police spokesman,
said yesterday.
Simpson ruling
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The judge in
the O.J. Simpson case ruled yesterday
that the jury can hear about violence in
Simpson's marriage to Nicole Brown
Simpson, including a 1989 incident in
which he pleaded no contest to wife beat
ing.

Superior Court Judge Lance Ito said
most of the domestic violence evidence
can be presented because it is necessary
to prove motive and intent in the June
slayings of Ms. Simpson and her friend
Ronald Goldman.
Among the evidence he included was a
1989 New Year's Day fight, which led to
criminal charges against Simpson; Ms.
Simpson's 911 emergency call the fall
before she was murdered; and a 1984 or
1985 baseball bat attack on Ms. Simp
son's car.
The decision was a major victory for
prosecutors, who hope to use evidence of
domestic violence during Simpson's rela
tionship with Ms. Simpson to support
their contention that her slaying was the
culmination of years of abuse and degra
dation.
