The ASSU Senate should
ensure that special-fee
plan is well-understood

After months of work
by a special task force,
lengthy debate in the ASSU
Senate and a brouhaha over
alleged abuse of power by the sen
ate chair during a vote last quarter,
the senate last week finally voted
17-3 to place a plan for overhaul
ing the special-fee system on a spe
cial-election ballot later this
month.
The proposal would amend the
ASSU Constitution to eliminate
special-fee refunds and divide
undergraduates and graduates
into two separate communities for
voting and collection. In addition,
the measure would give the senate
power to cap the total amount of
fees placed on the ballot. Moreover,
it would decree that organizations
which petition to be put on the bal
lot would require a 60 percent
approval rather than the usual
majority vote. Finally, the amend
ment would prevent fees from
going toward activities judged as
religious or political.
Although the proposal could
have a profound impact on stu
dents and student groups, many
students are unaware of what the
bill actually says. Public debates
and dorm programs would help
students become more informed of
related issues and would also help
the credibility of the supporters
and opponents of the measure. If
the Council of Presidents and
ASSU leadership truly believe in
the merits of this proposal, they
should demonstrate their convic
tion by organizing open forums for
debate, allowing both supporters
and opponents of the bill to pre
sent their cases and field questions
from students.
Initially, the COP hoped to use
their discretionary funds to help

promote the special-fee amend
ment, which will be voted on by the
student body in a special election
held on Jan. 25. However, when
the amendment's opposition point
ed out that the extra funding
would go against ASSU bylaws —
which stipulate that both sides of a
campaign must have equal access
to such funds — COP members
abandoned their initial plan. Now,
COP members plan to use about
$300 of private funds to campaign
for the fee-reform proposal,
according to COP member Mork
Murdock.
With the funding debate
resolved, the senate should turn to
the subject of informing all stu
dents about the bill. To help
ensure that students are informed
of the consequences of the pro
posed changes, the ASSU could
sponsor some debates in addition
to putting out the election hand
book. In this way, senators who
voted both for and against the
measure can explain their opinions
for the benefit of student voters
who have not had adequate expo
sure to the issue. While their final
vote on the matter showed the sen
ate to be overwhelmingly in favor
of the proposal, senators should
act fairly toward their constituents
and present both sides of the issue,
which in turn will allow students
to vote intelligently.
The COFJ which endorses the
plan, should of course not be
expected to use their private dona
tions to foot the bill for the opposi
tion's campaign, or even to tap into
their discretionary funds to do so.
But perhaps other ASSU funds
could be used to help sponsor
bipartisan debate on this complex
and far-reaching reform proposal.
When students log in to vote on
Jan. 25, they should be well
informed of both the strengths and
flaws of the proposition, and not
just of the senate's standpoint.
Regardless of how the vote turns
out, senators can then feel confi
dent that they have participated in
a truly democratic process.
