## (Another) Stupid column on race 
### 
I'VE AVOIDED THE responsibility
long enough. As an official Stanford
Daily Columnist™ I am obliged to
write at least one column on the subject(s)
of race and ethnicity. It's in the handbook
(gender optional).
My roommate tells me I'll get beaten,
stripped, covered in cream cheese and
hung outside of my window just for bring
ing it up, but I keep showing him the hand
book and saying they'll fire me if I don't. So
today I put up my gratuitous account of
the whole undefmable, gooey mess.
Remember, any a discussion of race
necessitates a presumptuous pomposity
and an unruly belief that you know more
about the indistinguishable than anyone
else. I'll do my best.
Race and ethnicity
If you don't have, one can be bought,
borrowed, learned, leased, adopted or
admired from a slight distance and for a
minor fee. Guatemalan handbags and
urban dialects can be found in any local
WalMart, which is all very convenient for
the identity impaired.
This LES (Latent Ethnicity Syn
drome) is becoming increasingly preva
lent (think I knew how to cut a bagel
before coming to Stanford?). That so
many learn how to identify by ethnicity in
college, not home, is both comical and
unfortunate.
Recently, definition by race has become
a matter of choice — you can futz around
with your levels and venues of identifica
tion like they were presets on your car
stereo. Either way, it changes what you
wear more than what you really are.
Apparently, it is also acceptable to

make up ethnicity as you go along; though
it is considered discourteous to change
your name more than twice. It confuses
your high school friends.
Appreciation
Once the egos are checked at the door,
this is what it's all about — appreciation of
variety and of intricacy in the unfamiliar.
Translation: Everyone's music sucks
to someone else; but you still play every
album loud.
Now sometimes a mixed message is
sent. We are told "I am your equal!" and
"Don't forget that I am different!" in the
same breath. This can lead to terribly
insulting responses like, "Could you
please make up your mind?"
Labels
Categorization into "The Big Five" in
an unfortunate and inaccurate heuristic.
You'd do better to classify people by donut
preference — Sugar Raised, Boston
Cream, Chocolate Frosted, Old Fashioned
or French Cruller — if you really wanted
to learn something about them.
And before you go all expository ballis
tic over the discrimination implied by the
in- or exclusion of a hyphen, recall what a
very small percentage of white people are
actually Anglo.
Yeah, oops.
All labels are tools; they are not meant
to be accurate.
Pointing fingers
Now if Stanford purports not to care
diddly about who looks like what then
how come it still prints those little Check
One boxes on both its Admissions and RA
applications?
And that those boxes are optional
changes everything by way of (dis)advan-

tages. Right?
Individuality?
Given:
a) A group's "opinion" rarely corre
sponds with those of its members.
b) Groups are made up of individuals.
c) Individuals effect change.
Ergo, collective DNA does nothing but
start arguments. Who you are is a matter
of who you are, not of who you belong to.
No one cares what you look like when you
are being a schmuck, only that you are
being a schmuck.
Saving my ass/Conclusions
Now I recognize that as a Caucasian
(Chocolate Frosted, actually) I should be a
target for car bombing for all this.
But get this: in this ludicrous PC world
a selected marginalization of being Jewish
actually compensates for lack of melanin
and makes it somewhat okay for me to
comment on ethnicity, even though
Judaism is at its debatable heart a reli
gion.
That that is so is also both comical and
unfortunate (and exploited).
It shouldn't be all that complicated,
should it? Differences exist and prefer
ences occur. You are what you are and
we're born what we're supposed to be.
Our souls choose bodies that fit — you
might not like it or you might thank the
heavens.
Personally, I am Batman trapped
inside the body of a Jew, but that doesn't
mean I'd change a thing.
