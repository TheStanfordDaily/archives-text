## Justin Pollard Journalistic bias and the quest for accurate reporting 
### 
A MAJOR SOURCE of concern here at
the Daily is the harrage of accusations
ive receive claiming that our paper is
biased against one group or another, or has
maliciously presented incorrect information
in one of our articles. Recently, for example,
a student wrote a letter claiming that a
Daily article had unfairly portrayed a stu
dent group which formed to oppose Proposi
tion 187 as "disorganized, babbling and
unsure." The author of the letter claimed
the reporter had "blatantly" misrepresented
the group's intentions and used quotes out
of context.
An editor once told me that he believed
leaders of student organizations as diverse
as fraternities, ethnic centers and the ASSU
feel that the Daily is biased against them
and represents them poorly. The adminis
tration could also argue that we have it in
for them, since we have run articles and edi
torials recently which openly defied their
proposed changes to the alumni giving poli
cy and the grading policy.
Do people think we're biased in favor of

anyone? Well, if you ask Aman Verjee, edi
tor in chief of The Stanford Review, I'm
sure he'd tell you we're part of the radical
international eco-feminist conspiracy
(Didn't he once write an editorial on that
very subject?). And other students are just
as sure that we coddle the administration,
the fraternities and c-thnic ccnters, etc.
Funny, though — it always seems to be the
other guy.
The truth is that we, like every other
newspaper, are inevitably biased in one
form or another. The bias of which we are
guilty, however, is that of trying to sift
through all the information we encounter
to present the facts and viewpoints which
we consider to be most valid and relevant to
our readers. Our reporters do not intention
ally slant stories, as our critics claim.
Bias comes in many shapes and sizes.
First, we must decide which stories to cover
and which events are not actually newswor
thy. Next, we must rate stories from most to
least important — the number one story
goes on the top of the front page and to the

right, others may not appear until page 10
or 12. Within each story, furthermore,
sources which are considered more articu
late or credible are quoted higher in the arti
cle, and it is not always possible to give
equal amounts of space to the d'fTerent
viewpoints related to the issue.
The question should not be whether it is
fair to be biased, as our critics ask, but if it is
really honest to be completely even-handed
if opposing viewpoints are not equally valid.
When I wrote an article on the proposed
Stanford West development, for example, it
seemed to me that the voices criticizing the
project far overshadowed the few extolling
it. Would it have been fair to have given
equal representation to project proponents
as to critics? I didn't tliink so, and dedicated
more space to those opposed to the project.
If an opinion is held by a small minority
of the student body, should we represent it
as much as a more widely held view? Not
necessarily, but just because a viewpoint is
held by a large majority of those concerned
does not mean it should be given more ere

dence either. Sometimes a small number of
students may hold an opinion which we
deem to be more valid than that of the
majority; consequently we would give it
more space. If an opinion is held by a small
number of people and lacks validity (such as
those expressed in letters we receive from
people claiming the government is reading
their mind) we are under no obligation to
represent it at all.
The Daily staff is doing our very best to
report the news as fairly and accurately as
possible. Sometimes our interpretation of
events conflicts with that of other interested
parties. But hopefully, it corresponds with
the interests and opinions of the mfyority of
our readers. If you disagree with the view
we present, write us a letter, or better yet,
come write for us yourself and you too can
be accused of maliciously presenting biased
information.
