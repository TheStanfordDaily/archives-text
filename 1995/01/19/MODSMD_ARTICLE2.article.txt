# All wet
## Campus rain damage small 
### Soumya V. Raman Contributing writer 
Though many places around the Bay Area have
seen heavy flooding and substantial damage in last
week's rain, University officials said the downpour
caused little harm to Stanford's academic buildings.
"We feel fortunate that there was minimal dam
ages compared to the amount of rainfall," said Alan
Cummings, a Zone Maintenance Division official.
As of yesterday, damage had been reported to
about 15 University buildings.
Torrential rains last Monday caused most of the
damages, he said. Damage was caused not only from
leaking roofs, Cummings said, but also by ponding
water throughout the campus, he said.
"Thanks to the investment of $4 million to repair
and replace roofs over the last two years, the roofs
withstood the rain," he said.
The ponding of water on campus occurred when
the volume of water released in the storm overloaded
the drainage system, Cummings said.
Explaining that there are two kinds of drainage
systems on campus, Cummings said that one set
runs into storm drains and catch basins.
But it was the other set of drains — one that al
lowed the water to soak into the ground — that pre
sented problems last week. The ground was saturat
ed with rain water and simply could not absorb any
more water, he said.
Flooding hit Kresge Auditorium, and cases of
leaks were reported in the Storke Building, Mudd
Chemistry Building, Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Braun
Music Center, 851 Welch Road, the Wilbur Modules
and Meyer Library. The library, however, reported
no damages except for "wet carpets," Cummings
said.
All damages were fixed the very next day, he said,
adding that maintenance personnel were called in to
work immediately. In addition, several contractors
were available on call to fix leaks and flooding, he
added.
Even before the latest wave of rains hit Northern
California, leaky roofs forced at least one student out
of her Casa Zapata residence and into a makeshift
new room in the dorm's third floor lounge.
Last Monday, the intense rains led to flooded
basements and smoking electrical transformers at
various campus locations, including Escondido Vil
lage.
"I have no estimates of costs," Cummings said.
