## Top flight? Gymnasts to clash with Titans, Bruins 
### Ben Hur Contributing writer 
Southern California, here
they come.
This weekend, the Stanford
women's gymnastics team trav
els to Cal State-Fullerton and
UCLA in an attempt to assert
its position as one of the
nation's elite.
Stanford head coach Breck
Greenwood, who graduated
from Fullerton and began his
coaching career there, has a
special incentive to beat the
Titans.
"It's always nice to win
when I go back home . . . it's
always fun to beat people you
know," Greenwood said.
The Cardinal will have its
hands full when the two teams
face off Friday night. Stanford
has beaten the Titans in Fuller
ton only once before.
"They're always a good
vaulting and bars team, and

they are always a good team in
general," Greenwood said.
The Stanford squad travels
to UCLA the following evening
to compete against the fifth
ranked Bruins and UC-Santa
Barbara. The fiercest competi
tion promises to be UCLA, a
school that the Cardinal has yet
to vanquish.
"The second nights are often
better. The past meet is fresh
in their minds, and they can
focus on what they have to do,"
Greenwood said.
An injury to senior co-cap
tain and all arounder Jen 6
Elzie places an added burden
upon the shoulders of her
teammates. Elzie suffered a
slightly sprained knee during
last week's meet against Cal,
which will limit her number of
events this weekend.
"I think I'm only doing
bars," Elzie said. "But I think
our team will be fired up. With the
depth we have this year, we can
afford to have people take a week
off if they have to. Others will just
have to step it up."
With Elzie restricted to bars,
other members of Stanford's tal
ented squad will be given a chance
to compete.
"When one of your big guns is
down, it gives some of the others a
chance to show their stuff,"
Greenwood said.
Sophomore vault specialist
Amy Paris begins her collegiate
career this weekend, performing a
front-handspring vault.
"I'm really excited and pretty
confident," Paris said. "I've never
done this vault in a meet before,
but I think I'm ready."
Senior co-captain Katie Clancy
enters the lineup for the first time
since April of 1993. Clancy tore the
anterior cruciate ligament of her
knee during summer training,
forcing her to redshirt the 1994
campaign.
"I'm definitely ready to com
pete," Clancy said. "Without Jene
at full strength we're really going
to have to pull our performances
together in order to dominate. I
have full confidence that we can do
that."
Freshman Keri Monahan, win
ner of the all around last Friday
against Cal, looks forward to the
trip down south.
"It will definitely be a different
situation," Monahan said. "I'm a
little more nervous going on the
road, but I'm confident that our
team will be able to show its stuff."
Clancy remembers the feeling
of entering the opponents' gym
during her freshman year, and has
a few words to impart on her first
year teammates.
"All we have to do is have fun
with each other and focus within
ourselves," Clancy said.
