# Even an L.A. fan has to admit that those 'Niners have style
## 
### 
I love L.A. From the time I
learned to read, my days
always began with a piece of
toast and the"Day in Sports"
from the L.A. Times.
I'll always bleed Dodger Blue, I
followed the Los Angeles Kings in
the pre-Gretzky era when they
wore purple and gold and I stuck
by the Lakers while Jack Nichol
son eschewed the Fabulous

Forum. And yes, I am even a true
California Angels fan as well as a
backer of the "Save the Rams"
campaign (The St. Louis Rams? It
just doesn't sound right).
I was never too much into any
L.A./Bay Area rivalries. So when I
came to the Stanford four years
ago, I naively thought that I could
adopt the local pro squads as my
"away from home" teams.
Whatever.
In my first quarter here, the
Giants helped the Braves defeat
the Dodgers for the N.L. West
title. The A's couldn't satisfy my
championship desires in 1992.
And professional basketball is
just not the same without Chick
Hearn doing the play-by-play.
