# Even an L.A. fan has to admit that those 'Niners have style
## 
### 
I love L.A. From the time I
learned to read, my days
always began with a piece of
toast and the"Day in Sports"
from the L.A. Times.
I'll always bleed Dodger Blue, I
followed the Los Angeles Kings in
the pre-Gretzky era when they
wore purple and gold and I stuck
by the Lakers while Jack Nichol
son eschewed the Fabulous

Forum. And yes, I am even a true
California Angels fan as well as a
backer of the "Save the Rams"
campaign (The St. Louis Rams? It
just doesn't sound right).
I was never too much into any
L.A./Bay Area rivalries. So when I
came to the Stanford four years
ago, I naively thought that I could
adopt the local pro squads as my
"away from home" teams.
Whatever.
In my first quarter here, the
Giants helped the Braves defeat
the Dodgers for the N.L. West
title. The A's couldn't satisfy my
championship desires in 1992.
And professional basketball is
just not the same without Chick
Hearn doing the play-by-play.

But I do love the San Francis
co 49ers.
Even when the Rams were
good (they defeated Tampa Bay 9-
0 in the NFC title game to
advance to the 1980 Super Bowl)
during the eighties, I admired
Montana and company. Maybe it
was a case of being a fair-weather
fan as the Niners racked up Super
Bowl wins, but now it's a little
different.
The 49ers that cruised
through the 1994 season and
advanced to Super Bowl XXIX by
crushing the two-time NFL
Champion Dallas Cowboys have a
style L.A. fans should recognize.
It's Showtime on the gridiron.
Last Sunday, en route to a 21-
0 lead in the opening seven and a
half minutes of the NFC Champi
onship game, the 49ers forced
their opponent to turn the ball
over. Then they took off on the
fast break and Steve Young and
his offensive juggernaut turned
those mistakes into quick scores
as neatly as a Magic-to-Worthy
no-look pass for an easy two.
The 49ers score often and with
style, with both the offense and
the defense getting in on the
action. It is a team of superstars,
beginning with the league's Most

Valuable Player, Young. Just as
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did in the
NBA, Jerry Rice has left his
name all over the NFL record
book. Rice is the seasoned veter
an who watches over the up-and
coming talent such as rookie full
back William "Bar None" Floyd,
whose enthusiasm on the field
might be compared to a young
Magic Johnson in the 1980 NBA
Finals.
So while I may never complete
ly understand "49er fanaticism"
or the mentality that drives Bay
Area fans in general (what does
"Humm-Baby" mean?), I can
appreciate the show that the San
Francisco 49ers put on every
week during the NFL season.
When the 49ers meet the San
Diego Chargers in Super Blowout
XXIX next week, I'll be pulling for
San Francisco to not only win,
but cover the outrageous spread
(if you jumped on the NFC win
ner at 11 points over the AFC
winner before last weekend, pat
yourself on the back and get
ready to pad your wallet).
And I'll enjoy the feeling of
seeing a championship trophy
brought back to the city of San
Francisco — a feeling we've
missed for too long in L.A.

Kyle and Josh would like to
assure NFL fans that the Rams
will be back — the battle has just
begun.
