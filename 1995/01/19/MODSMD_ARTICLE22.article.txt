# Cardinal ventures into Bear country
## Stanford hoopsters set to tangle with ailing Cal in basketball's Big Game 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Big Game is back. And this time, as the
Stanford men's basketball team travels to face
California, the stakes are more than mere
bragging rights or instruments of agricultural
destruction.
Stanford (11-2 overall, 2-2 in the Pacific 10
Conference) takes its show on the road to
Berkeley's rambunctious Harmon Arena in
hopes of continuing its impressive level of
play. Last week's inspiring performances, a
convincing 91-75 stomping of then 12th
ranked Arizona State and a heartbreaking 83-
89 overtime loss to then 13th-ranked Arizona,
have vaulted Stanford back into the polls at
21. But there is little rest for the weary.

They bring out all of their
maniacs, and the place gets
pretty loud.'

"It's another challenge ahead of us," said
Cardinal head coach Mike Montgomery. "And
of course Harmon is a very difficult place to
play. It's a road game versus a home game, so
we have to now sustain and put forth that
kind of effort on the road that we've had at
home these last two games without the bene
fit of a crowd to help us and the security blan
ket of being at home."
Meanwhile, the Bears (8-4 overall, 1-3 Pac
-10), after an exceptional start including early
season victories over highly-ranked Minnesota
and Cincinnati, have fallen on hard times.
With two straight losses to Arizona and ASU
last week, Cal has dropped four of its last five
and finds itself dreadfully close to the Pac-10
cellar.
Riddled with injuries the last several
weeks, the Bears now appear to be very much
like the proverbial wounded animal in desper
ate need for a win to get back on its feet. Start
ing power forward Alfred Grigsby has been
out since Jan. 7 with an injured hamstring,
and starting center Ryan Jamison has played
just four minutes in the last three days due to
a sprained ankle and the flu. Grigsby is ques
tionable for the game while Jamison is likely
to suit up.
"I think they're going to be really hungry,"
said Cardinal center Tim Young. "Obviously
they're in their own gym, so they're going to
play better."
Young, a freshman, has yet to set foot on
the Harmon hardcourt. But older players who
