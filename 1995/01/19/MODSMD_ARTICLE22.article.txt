# Cardinal ventures into Bear country
## Stanford hoopsters set to tangle with ailing Cal in basketball's Big Game 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Big Game is back. And this time, as the
Stanford men's basketball team travels to face
California, the stakes are more than mere
bragging rights or instruments of agricultural
destruction.
Stanford (11-2 overall, 2-2 in the Pacific 10
Conference) takes its show on the road to
Berkeley's rambunctious Harmon Arena in
hopes of continuing its impressive level of
play. Last week's inspiring performances, a
convincing 91-75 stomping of then 12th
ranked Arizona State and a heartbreaking 83-
89 overtime loss to then 13th-ranked Arizona,
have vaulted Stanford back into the polls at
21. But there is little rest for the weary.

They bring out all of their
maniacs, and the place gets
pretty loud.'

"It's another challenge ahead of us," said
Cardinal head coach Mike Montgomery. "And
of course Harmon is a very difficult place to
play. It's a road game versus a home game, so
we have to now sustain and put forth that
kind of effort on the road that we've had at
home these last two games without the bene
fit of a crowd to help us and the security blan
ket of being at home."
Meanwhile, the Bears (8-4 overall, 1-3 Pac
-10), after an exceptional start including early
season victories over highly-ranked Minnesota
and Cincinnati, have fallen on hard times.
With two straight losses to Arizona and ASU
last week, Cal has dropped four of its last five
and finds itself dreadfully close to the Pac-10
cellar.
Riddled with injuries the last several
weeks, the Bears now appear to be very much
like the proverbial wounded animal in desper
ate need for a win to get back on its feet. Start
ing power forward Alfred Grigsby has been
out since Jan. 7 with an injured hamstring,
and starting center Ryan Jamison has played
just four minutes in the last three days due to
a sprained ankle and the flu. Grigsby is ques
tionable for the game while Jamison is likely
to suit up.
"I think they're going to be really hungry,"
said Cardinal center Tim Young. "Obviously
they're in their own gym, so they're going to
play better."
Young, a freshman, has yet to set foot on
the Harmon hardcourt. But older players who

have, like Stanford senior forward
Andy Poppink, know what it's
like to be a Cardinal in Bear coun
try.
"It's a zoo," Poppink said.
"They bring out all of their
maniacs, all the crazy people
that go to Cal, and the place gets
pretty loud. It should be fun for
us as long as we can stay in the
game. It's a good environment
because there's a lot of excite
ment which will get our players
excited about playing, which is
sometimes difficult when you
play on the road. But with their
crowd so involved in it, it kind of
helps us.
"The key is going to be starting
the game well. If we can come out
strong and quiet that crowd, then
hopefully we'll be in control of the
ball game."
Besides simply the homecourt,
though, Cal brings plenty of
weapons to the table. Although
NBA lottery draft picks Jason
Kidd and Lamond Murray, who
combined for 43 points in the last
meeting, are no longer donning
the blue and gold, the Bears field
a solid team with plenty of young
talent.
"They have a number of differ
ent ways that they can attack you
with small lineups and big line
ups," Montgomery said. "They're
also certainly a very athletic bas
ketball team. They do a lot of
changing defenses and trapping,
so that involves a lot of different
personnel. There are also several
different people that can hurt you
scoring- wise."
One of the primary threats will
come from versatile Cal swing
man Monty Buckley who leads his
team in scoring with an average of
16.1 points per game to go along
with his 6.3 rebounds. Poppink,
coming off an outstanding near
triple-double performance (18
points, 13 rebounds, eight assists)
against the Wildcats last Satur

day, will face Buckley for most of
the game.
"He's a pretty good shooter
and he's pretty active," Poppink
said. "It should be fun for me
because I stay in the games more,
and I'm able to concentrate better
when I'm guarding somebody
that's pretty good."
Cal also has a triumvirate of
quality freshmen talent. Forward
Tony Gonzalez has already start
ed two games. Guard Jelani
Gardner leads the team with 5.6
assists per game, and forward
Tremaine Fowlkes has come off
the bench to lead the team in
rebounds with 6.5 boards per
game to complement his 13.7
ppg. Thus far, it appears as if
Cal's highly-touted freshmen

class has performed as adver
tised.
"I played with Fowlkes on the
Junior National Team," said
Young, Stanford's own fab frosh.
"He's a great player. He's strong,
quick, a great athlete."
Bear shot-blocking specialist
center Michael Stewart, a sopho
more who set a school record of 59
blocks as an AIl-Pac-10 Fresh
man, will only add to the havoc at
Harmon.
"Cal changes so much it's hard
to get a gauge on what they're
doing," Montgomery said. "They
end up with a lot of different com
binations. We're going to have to
be aware of that and not get con
fused getting down the floor and
being able to defend people."

and finds itself dreadfully close to the Pac-10
cellar.
Riddled with injuries the last several
weeks, the Bears now appear to be very much
like the proverbial wounded animal in desper
ate need for a win to get back on its feet. Start
ing power forward Alfred Grigsby has been
out since Jan. 7 with an injured hamstring,
and starting center Ryan Jamison has played
just four minutes in the last three days due to
a sprained ankle and the flu. Grigsby is ques
tionable for the game while Jamison is likely
to suit up.
"I think they're going to be really hungry,"
said Cardinal center Tim Young. "Obviously
they're in their own gym, so they're going to
play better."
Young, a freshman, has yet to set foot on
the Harmon hardcourt. But older players who

have, like Stanford senior forward
Andy Poppink, know what it's
like to be a Cardinal in Bear coun
try.
"It's a zoo," Poppink said.
"They bring out all of their
maniacs, all the crazy people
that go to Cal, and the place gets
pretty loud. It should be fun for
us as long as we can stay in the
game. It's a good environment
because there's a lot of excite
ment which will get our players
excited about playing, which is
sometimes difficult when you
play on the road. But with their
crowd so involved in it, it kind of
helps us.
"The key is going to be starting
the game well. If we can come out
strong and quiet that crowd, then
hopefully we'll be in control of the
ball game."
Besides simply the homecourt,
though, Cal brings plenty of
weapons to the table. Although
NBA lottery draft picks Jason
Kidd and Lamond Murray, who
combined for 43 points in the last
meeting, are no longer donning
the blue and gold, the Bears field
a solid team with plenty of young
talent.
"They have a number of differ
ent ways that they can attack you
with small lineups and big line
ups," Montgomery said. "They're
also certainly a very athletic bas
ketball team. They do a lot of
changing defenses and trapping,
so that involves a lot of different
personnel. There are also several
different people that can hurt you
scoring- wise."
One of the primary threats will
come from versatile Cal swing
man Monty Buckley who leads his
team in scoring with an average of
16.1 points per game to go along
with his 6.3 rebounds. Poppink,
coming off an outstanding near
triple-double performance (18
points, 13 rebounds, eight assists)
against the Wildcats last Satur

day, will face Buckley for most of
the game.
"He's a pretty good shooter
and he's pretty active," Poppink
said. "It should be fun for me
because I stay in the games more,
and I'm able to concentrate better
when I'm guarding somebody
that's pretty good."
Cal also has a triumvirate of
quality freshmen talent. Forward
Tony Gonzalez has already start
ed two games. Guard Jelani
Gardner leads the team with 5.6
assists per game, and forward
Tremaine Fowlkes has come off
the bench to lead the team in
rebounds with 6.5 boards per
game to complement his 13.7
ppg. Thus far, it appears as if
Cal's highly-touted freshmen

class has performed as adver
tised.
"I played with Fowlkes on the
Junior National Team," said
Young, Stanford's own fab frosh.
"He's a great player. He's strong,
quick, a great athlete."
Bear shot-blocking specialist
center Michael Stewart, a sopho
more who set a school record of 59
blocks as an AIl-Pac-10 Fresh
man, will only add to the havoc at
Harmon.
"Cal changes so much it's hard
to get a gauge on what they're
doing," Montgomery said. "They
end up with a lot of different com
binations. We're going to have to
be aware of that and not get con
fused getting down the floor and
being able to defend people."
