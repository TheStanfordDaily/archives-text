Second-ranked Stanford knocked
off an unranked Rutgers team last
night for a handy 15-12, 15-12,15-6
victory in its season home opener.
Fueled by 19 kill performances
from both Mike Lambert and Matt
Fuerbringer, the Cardinal took the
early advantage in game one and
was able to stave off a late drive by
the Raiders.
Middle blockers Michael Hoefer
and Keenan Whitehurst provided
a staunch defense at the net, limit
ing the Raiders to a sub-par .244
hitting percentage in that first
game.
After the side switch, Rutgers
regrouped and came out virtually
flawless in the second game. Both
teams relied upon timely side-outs,
and a stalemate on offense devel
oped for the first 15 rotations of the
game.
Finally, at 3-3 the Raiders broke
loose and capitalized on several
Stanford hitting and passing errors
to build up a 7-3 lead behind the red
hot hitting of All-American Jose

Luis Estrada.
"The passing slipped up at that
point and Aaron [Garcia] had a bad
spell there with the jump serves and
the float serves that were coming
our way," said head coach Ruben
Nieves.
After a couple time outs, Nieves
substituted in freshman Tad Hoff
man for the struggling Garcia and
veteran Brian Garrett for White
hurst, and the Cardinal slowly
turned the game around.
"Garrett has been here for
awhile and he know it takes aggres

Nieves said. "He provided a spark
for us by staying enthusiastic and
making aggressive plays like his
jump float serves."
After hitting a low point at 12-9,
a Hoffman block and two Fuer
bringer kills evened the score at 12
before Garrett stepped up and
served three consecutive winners
for the victory. On point 13, the
Rutgers offense faltered with a hit
ting error, Lambert stuffed Estra
da's kill attempt for the number 14
and Garrett floated an ace deep into
Raiders territory for the game
point.
"We made a few adjustments
during the game and overcame a
tough team," Hoefer said. "It was a
good comeback for us to build on."
"This is a young team, but it's a
