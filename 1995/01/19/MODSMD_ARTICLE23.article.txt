Second-ranked Stanford knocked
off an unranked Rutgers team last
night for a handy 15-12, 15-12,15-6
victory in its season home opener.
Fueled by 19 kill performances
from both Mike Lambert and Matt
Fuerbringer, the Cardinal took the
early advantage in game one and
was able to stave off a late drive by
the Raiders.
Middle blockers Michael Hoefer
and Keenan Whitehurst provided
a staunch defense at the net, limit
ing the Raiders to a sub-par .244
hitting percentage in that first
game.
After the side switch, Rutgers
regrouped and came out virtually
flawless in the second game. Both
teams relied upon timely side-outs,
and a stalemate on offense devel
oped for the first 15 rotations of the
game.
Finally, at 3-3 the Raiders broke
loose and capitalized on several
Stanford hitting and passing errors
to build up a 7-3 lead behind the red
hot hitting of All-American Jose

Luis Estrada.
"The passing slipped up at that
point and Aaron [Garcia] had a bad
spell there with the jump serves and
the float serves that were coming
our way," said head coach Ruben
Nieves.
After a couple time outs, Nieves
substituted in freshman Tad Hoff
man for the struggling Garcia and
veteran Brian Garrett for White
hurst, and the Cardinal slowly
turned the game around.
"Garrett has been here for
awhile and he know it takes aggres
sive plays to get back into a game,"
Nieves said. "He provided a spark
for us by staying enthusiastic and
making aggressive plays like his
jump float serves."
After hitting a low point at 12-9,
a Hoffman block and two Fuer
bringer kills evened the score at 12
before Garrett stepped up and
served three consecutive winners
for the victory. On point 13, the
Rutgers offense faltered with a hit
ting error, Lambert stuffed Estra
da's kill attempt for the number 14
and Garrett floated an ace deep into
Raiders territory for the game
point.
"We made a few adjustments
during the game and overcame a
tough team," Hoefer said. "It was a
good comeback for us to build on."
"This is a young team, but it's a

group that knows how to stay poised
in situations like that," Nieves said.
"And that is very characteristic of all
Stanford teams."
Game two was the best crack
Rutgers had all night at besting the
Cardinal, but Raiders head coach
Ron Larsen admitted that, "Stan
ford just had more guns and is
stronger in every position except for
maybe setter.
"We stayed at 11 [points] for way
too long," Larsen continued. "And
we didn't make the needed adjust
ments to score the quick point and
take the advantage because Stan
ford sided-out really well at the end.
They deserve to be the No. 2 team."
After that prolonged battle, the
Raiders folded in the final game
after the Cardinal jumped to a 7-0
lead behind two consecutive Fuer
bringer blocks followed by two con
secutive Fuerbringer kills.
On the other side of the net, the
Raiders couldn't get anything going,
hitting a dismal .207 compared to
Stanford's .458 in game three.
"That was a good finish for us
and a good start overall," Nieves
said. "We didn't expect such a tough
team and such a tough second game
though. I think Rutgers will sur
prise a lot of teams this year."
As for the Cardinal, Nieves men
tioned defense as an area that can
still stand for a "ton of improve
ment," despite last night's perfor
mance.
"One of the reasons we couldn't
score early on in game two was our
digging," Nieves said. "In addition
to that, our blocking was streaky
throughout the match, and there
were long stretches where we didn't
block a single ball."
Stanford will, however, be afford
ed a chance to establish some
desired consistency on defense over
the weekend at the UC-Santa Bar
bara Collegiate Tournament.
Featuring top teams including
No. 1 UCLA, No. 3 USC and No. 5
Long Beach State, the second
ranked Cardinal will be in good
company. Last year, Stanford
advanced to the finals before falling
to USC in a hard-fought, five-game
match.
Playing with 23 other teams this
year, the Cardinal will start off Fri
day's round robin tournament in
the same group as Cal Poly-
Pomona, UC-San Diego and Rut
gers.
