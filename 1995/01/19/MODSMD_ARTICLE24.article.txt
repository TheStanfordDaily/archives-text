It doesn't get any closer than
the Stanford wrestling team's 19-
16 loss at San Francisco State
last night.
With the score tied at 16,
Gator heavyweight Phil Zimolzak
defeated freshman Mark Neglay,

9-4, to give San Francisco State
the victory. Neglay made a couple
of mistakes early in the match
and Zimolzak built up a large
lead. Neglay began to come back
but ran out of time.
"It was as close as you could
make it," said head coach Chris

team's last home meet against Cal Poly.
Horpel. "I take my hat off to San
Francisco State. We didn't do
anything poorly. They were just
better tonight."
The turning point in the meet
came in the 167 lbs. match with
the score at an even 10-10. Junior
Mark Ryzewicz and Gator senior
Polo Ornelas were tied at the end
of regulation. In the ensuing sud
den death overtime, Ryzewicz,
who had the advantage, was
caught in an awkward position
and Ornelas pinned him.
Ornelas's victory gave San Fran
cisco State a 16-10 lead. What
looked to be three points for the
Cardinal ended up being six
points for San Francisco State, a
nine point swing. Ryzewicz had
upset Ornelas last week, 3-2, at

the Aggie Open at UC-Davis.
"It was a big match," Horpel
said. "[The pin] was heartbreak
ing."
The night began with two
Stanford losses. The Gators' 118-
pound Mark Valledor slipped past
junior Brian Mcßeth, 6-4, and
Gustavo Ceja handled sophomore
By Pham, 13-5, in the 126-pound
division. Pham was replacing
injured starter Matt Cano, who
hurt his knee in winning the
Aggie Open last Saturday.
"Matt's absence was big," said
senior co-captain Jay Jackson. A
victory by Cano would have given
the Cardinal at least three points,
but the loss at 126 gave the
Gators four points, a seven point
swing.
The Cardinal came back, tak
ing the next three bouts. Junior
Jimmy Aguirre, Jackson and
junior Tod Surmon defeated their
Gator opponents by a combined

score of 24-5, giving Stanford a
10-7 lead. Aguirre dominated the
Gators best wrestler, Division II
All-American Francis Aquino, 6-2.
"Aguirre just handled him,"
Horpel said. "Surmon and Jack
son looked solid."
Gator John Giuffre tied the
score with a 5-1 victory over 158-
pound sophomore Ryan Barnes,
setting the stage for Ryzewicz's
battle with Ornelas.
Sophomore Roger Liu, in his
best performance since coming
back from a neck injury, pounded
Gator Jon Perez in the 177-pound
bout. Sophomore 190-pounder
Bryan Vaniman tied the score at
16 with a 4-2 overtime victory
over Lee Lofton heading into the
heavyweight bout.
"Each match was a turning
point," Jackson said. "I thought
they wrestled great, but it's still
tough to lose. I think we would
beat them on any other day."
