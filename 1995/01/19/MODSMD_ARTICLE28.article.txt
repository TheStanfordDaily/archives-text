Clerks
In the no-budget, guerrilla-indepen
dent tradition of "She's Gotta Have It"
and the more recent "El Mariachi,"
Kevin Smith's "Clerks" hands out an
other slap in the face to studio execu
tives who prefer the convenience of
judging talent by its price tag.
Made for less money than the cater
ing bill for most major Hollywood pro
ductions — $27,575 to be exact —
this black-and-white-shot venture
looks cheap, talks fast and plays
tough. Vile, remorseless and engag
ing all at once, "Clerks" is quite sim
ply the most audacious American
comedy to hit the screens thus far
this year.

Disclosure
Based on Michael Crichton's novel,
Barry Levinson's "Disclosure" brings
us a tale of sexual harassment with a
twist. "Sexual harassment is about
power" — and in this film, the tradi
tional male hierarchy is overthrown.
This time the woman is on top.
While the film aspires to be original,
Disclosure falls short of being great
entertainment. The adaptation from
Crichton's novel loses his flair for de
tail and focuses on a basic, uninspir
ing plot. The characters are stereo
typical and flat.
Demi Moore plays Meredith John
son, the new vice-president and
boss-woman, who sets out to seduce
Tom Sanders (Michael Douglas). In a
steamy scene in her office, Johnson
attacks Sanders, who struggles
against her sexual advances. He es
capes with his virtue intact, and then
retaliates with legal charges. The plot
takes various twists and turns, and it
becomes difficult to tell who is setting
up whom.
Overall, Disclosure falls into the
mediocre category. Even Moore's
strong acting suffers from the lack of
a well-written script and interesting
dialogue.
Heavenly Creatures
In 1954, New Zealand's infamous
matricide case shocked an entire na
tion. Director Peter Jackson has de
cided that it is time to reopen closets
and let the skeletons run free. Re
grettably though, Jackson also loses
control in the process.
More troubling is Jackson's uncritical
take on Pauline's apparent scorn for

her family's working-class vulgarity
and identification with the Hulmes'
gracious refinement. "Heavenly
Creatures" mostly fascinates as a
fairy tale turned sour — social credi
bility is all but relegated to a paltry af
terthought.
Interview with a Vampire
Tom Cruise wanted to be taken seri
ously. Neil Jordan wanted to prove
he could compete on Hollywood's
home ground. Anne Rice wanted to
confound all involved by first publicly
disowning the project, then heartily
endorsing it.
A case of too many personal egos at
stake and too little substance to hold
them together — "Interview With the
Vampire" ends up constipated on a
diet rich in pyrotechnical novelty, but
painfully lacking an emotional center.
IQ
As old-fashioned as the '40s come
dies it tries to emulate, "IQ" is a stan
dard, by-the-book romantic comedy.
There is no freshness or originality —
it goes through the motions like an
equation being solved by a mathe
matician.
Light, harmless and sweet, it tries to
be as timeless as an old Hepburn
and Cooper classic, but it suffers
from a severe lack of star power..
Tim Robbins plays a lovesick me
chanic who, abetted by the brilliant
mind of Albert Einstein (Walter
Matthau), pretends to be a genius
physicist. All this so he can lasso the
heart of Einstein's niece (Meg Ryan).
You learn three things from watching
"IQ": Einstein needed to have a very

nasty sense of humor to set up his
niece with a boring mechanic;
cliches never die, they just get trans
ported to different settings in a new
package; and finally, Princeton has a
lovely, very cute campus — so cute,
in fact, that it's perfect for a movie like
this.
Red
Rare is the filmmaker today, able to
make a plain statement about the
world we live in without shrouding it
with layers of oh-so-clever parody, or
drowning it in depths of fashionable
pastiche.
Thankfully, the Polish writer-director
Krzyzstof Kieslowski is one artist who
prefers to wear his philosophies on
his sleeve, and the payoff is hand
some; his "Three Colors" trilogy is
heart-rending ("Blue"), provocative
("White"), and ultimately uplifting
("Red"). Kieslowski's personal take
on the mechanics of life and destiny
filters through an intricately-crafted
web of human inter-relatedness, and
implies the heartening notion that no
one is really alone.
In the final moments of "Red," Kies
lowski recalls the primary elements of
"Blue" and "White" in a fantastic and
fitting resolution to the questions on
liberty, equality and fraternity posed
by the trilogy.
To Live
Adapted from Yu Hua's original novel
"Lifetimes," the "To Live" documents
the trials and tribulations faced by a
family of four, a wealthy household in
pre-liberation China, until the father,
Fugui (Ge You), loses their ancestral

property on the gambling table, and
is then reduced to puppeteering to
support his wife and children.
On the eve of Chairman Mao's
takeover, the elder daughter falls so
sick that she becomes deaf and the
fatigued younger son is killed by a
bureaucrat's car during the nation
wide "Great Leap Forward" cam
paign of 1958. Finally, Fugui and Ji
azhen (Gong Li) could not be sparec
from further grief by the Cultural Rev
olution.
Vanya on 42nd Street
Here's the innovative new approach
for Andre Gregory's film "Vanya on
42nd Street" — a century-old script
and nine actors.
This movie takes the original idea be
hind theater and turns it into a play
within-a-movie with both vitality and
force.
The film begins with a group of peo
ple walking off the streets of New
York into the ancient, deserted New
Amsterdam Theater to rehearse a
modern adaptation of Anton
Chekhov's play "Uncle Vanya."
The play they perform involves an
older professor (George Gaynes)
who returns to his country estate
after a long absence with a beautiful
new wife Yelena (Julianne Moore)
Yelena proceeds to charm both her
husband's brother-in-law Vanya
(Wallace Shawn) and the family doc
tor Astrov (Larry Pine) into falling in
love with her. As Astrov increases hi'
house visits, Yelena flirts with both
men, while her homely new step
daughter Sonya pines away for the
attention of the handsome doctor

Vanya on 42nd Street
Here's the innovative new approach
for Andre Gregory's film "Vanya on
42nd Street" — a century-old script
and nine actors.
This movie takes the original idea be
hind theater and turns it into a play
within-a-movie with both vitality and
force.
The film begins with a group of peo
ple walking off the streets of New
York into the ancient, deserted New
Amsterdam Theater to rehearse a
modern adaptation of Anton
Chekhov's play "Uncle Vanya."
The play they perform involves an
older professor (George Gaynes)
who returns to his country estate
after a long absence with a beautiful
new wife Yelena (Julianne Moore)
Yelena proceeds to charm both her
husband's brother-in-law Vanya
(Wallace Shawn) and the family doc
tor Astrov (Larry Pine) into falling in
love with her. As Astrov increases hi'
house visits, Yelena flirts with both
men, while her homely new step
daughter Sonya pines away for the
attention of the handsome doctor
Clerks
In the no-budget, guerrilla-indepen
dent tradition of "She's Gotta Have It"
and the more recent "El Mariachi,"
Kevin Smith's "Clerks" hands out an
other slap in the face to studio execu
tives who prefer the convenience of
judging talent by its price tag.
Made for less money than the cater
ing bill for most major Hollywood pro
ductions — $27,575 to be exact —
this black-and-white-shot venture
looks cheap, talks fast and plays
tough. Vile, remorseless and engag
ing all at once, "Clerks" is quite sim
ply the most audacious American
comedy to hit the screens thus far
this year.

Disclosure
Based on Michael Crichton's novel,
Barry Levinson's "Disclosure" brings
us a tale of sexual harassment with a
twist. "Sexual harassment is about
power" — and in this film, the tradi
tional male hierarchy is overthrown.
This time the woman is on top.
While the film aspires to be original,
Disclosure falls short of being great
entertainment. The adaptation from
Crichton's novel loses his flair for de
tail and focuses on a basic, uninspir
ing plot. The characters are stereo
typical and flat.
Demi Moore plays Meredith John
son, the new vice-president and
boss-woman, who sets out to seduce
Tom Sanders (Michael Douglas). In a
steamy scene in her office, Johnson
attacks Sanders, who struggles
against her sexual advances. He es
capes with his virtue intact, and then
retaliates with legal charges. The plot
takes various twists and turns, and it
becomes difficult to tell who is setting
up whom.
Overall, Disclosure falls into the
mediocre category. Even Moore's
strong acting suffers from the lack of
a well-written script and interesting
dialogue.
Heavenly Creatures
In 1954, New Zealand's infamous
matricide case shocked an entire na
tion. Director Peter Jackson has de
cided that it is time to reopen closets
and let the skeletons run free. Re
grettably though, Jackson also loses
control in the process.
More troubling is Jackson's uncritical
take on Pauline's apparent scorn for

her family's working-class vulgarity
and identification with the Hulmes'
gracious refinement. "Heavenly
Creatures" mostly fascinates as a
fairy tale turned sour — social credi
bility is all but relegated to a paltry af
terthought.
Interview with a Vampire
Tom Cruise wanted to be taken seri
ously. Neil Jordan wanted to prove
he could compete on Hollywood's
home ground. Anne Rice wanted to
confound all involved by first publicly
disowning the project, then heartily
endorsing it.
A case of too many personal egos at
stake and too little substance to hold
them together — "Interview With the
Vampire" ends up constipated on a
diet rich in pyrotechnical novelty, but
painfully lacking an emotional center.
IQ
As old-fashioned as the '40s come
dies it tries to emulate, "IQ" is a stan
dard, by-the-book romantic comedy.
There is no freshness or originality —
it goes through the motions like an
equation being solved by a mathe
matician.
Light, harmless and sweet, it tries to
be as timeless as an old Hepburn
and Cooper classic, but it suffers
from a severe lack of star power..
Tim Robbins plays a lovesick me
chanic who, abetted by the brilliant
mind of Albert Einstein (Walter
Matthau), pretends to be a genius
physicist. All this so he can lasso the
heart of Einstein's niece (Meg Ryan).
You learn three things from watching
"IQ": Einstein needed to have a very

nasty sense of humor to set up his
niece with a boring mechanic;
cliches never die, they just get trans
ported to different settings in a new
package; and finally, Princeton has a
lovely, very cute campus — so cute,
in fact, that it's perfect for a movie like
this.
Red
Rare is the filmmaker today, able to
make a plain statement about the
world we live in without shrouding it
with layers of oh-so-clever parody, or
drowning it in depths of fashionable
pastiche.
Thankfully, the Polish writer-director
Krzyzstof Kieslowski is one artist who
prefers to wear his philosophies on
his sleeve, and the payoff is hand
some; his "Three Colors" trilogy is
heart-rending ("Blue"), provocative
("White"), and ultimately uplifting
("Red"). Kieslowski's personal take
on the mechanics of life and destiny
filters through an intricately-crafted
web of human inter-relatedness, and
implies the heartening notion that no
one is really alone.
In the final moments of "Red," Kies
lowski recalls the primary elements of
"Blue" and "White" in a fantastic and
fitting resolution to the questions on
liberty, equality and fraternity posed
by the trilogy.
To Live
Adapted from Yu Hua's original novel
"Lifetimes," the "To Live" documents
the trials and tribulations faced by a
family of four, a wealthy household in
pre-liberation China, until the father,
Fugui (Ge You), loses their ancestral

property on the gambling table, and
is then reduced to puppeteering to
support his wife and children.
On the eve of Chairman Mao's
takeover, the elder daughter falls so
sick that she becomes deaf and the
fatigued younger son is killed by a
bureaucrat's car during the nation
wide "Great Leap Forward" cam
paign of 1958. Finally, Fugui and Ji
azhen (Gong Li) could not be sparec
from further grief by the Cultural Rev
