AND MAKING
PEOPLE HAPPY

Talking to Israeli folk singer-guitarist
David Broza inevitably becomes an ex
periment in controlled stream-of
consciousness. Our phone conversation last
week drifted seamlessly from my education
plans to the merits of Enya to his desire to get
arrested. And yet he manages to get his point
across.
Despite what one might assume from
Broza's link with a politically charged region
of the world, he insists that he is not trying to
change people's attitudes through his music,
that he does not want to use music to preach
or to sell his ideas.
"1 try to make people happy, to give
them a few hours of good music," Broza
said. "When they come to see me, they see
a one-man show and they've never seen
anything like it. It's something I love to do
and the way I do it is kind of unique." With
Broza's completely natural personality and
his singular approach to music, it's difficult
to see how any audience could not be en
tertained.
Next Monday, local audiences will have
the opportunity to hear him perform as he
takes a break from a national tour with
Steve Perry to perform solo in Memorial

Auditorium for a Stanford Hillel-spon
sored appearance.
During our phone conversation, Broza
talked casually of being kicked out of
school in Spain and performing with
Sting. When I asked him why he had been
kicked out of school, he answered solemnly,
"1 don't know. Too much music, I guess. I
didn't keep up my grades."
His sense of humor and easy manner im
mediately put me at ease, but he speak in
such a serious tone of voice that it sometimes
takes a minute to realize he's joking. 1 won
dered if in a face-to-face conversation he
would be able to manage to keep his face per
fectly straight, or would he give himself away
with a smile?
Born in Israel, singer and guitarist Broza
received the majority of his schooling in
Spain and Britain, although he now refers to
those years somewhat vaguely as, "Oh, yeah,
that was in the middle." He doesn't deny,
however, the impact those years had. "They
completely changed the way I look at
music."
He admits that being a musician was not
where he had originally wanted to end up. "1
wanted to be an (visual) artist. I used to play
the guitar for inspiration." He signed his first
contract after he was noticed by a record
company executive while playing in an Israeli
coffeehouse. "And I haven't painted since," he
added casually, without any hint of regret in
his voice.
Today, he's well known not only in Israel
but worldwide. He now lives in the United
States, giving over 250 performances a year
throughout the country. He performs pri
marily in English but is equally comfortable
with Hebrew as he finds very few differences
between the two.
His ties to Israel, therefore, are just as
strong as they've always been, as he spends a
week of every month in his native country
and puts out at least one Hebrew album a
year. His performance here at Stanford will
be mostly in Hebrew as well.
He describes his music as "kinda urban,
kinda folky." Drawing on rock 'n' roll folk
music, and jazz, Broza has managed to create
a style of music all his own. "It's hard to de
scribe it if you've never heard it. It's so much
a part of my life. It's what I live."
The uniqueness of his art is strength
ened by his decision to set poetry to
music rather than write his own
lyrics. "1 can't write lyrics," Broza explains.
"I did it for a while and didn't like what I was
doing."
Broza emphasizes that there is no need to
stop working if you can't write lyrics.
"There's written stuff out there already."
"In Israel, it's traditional to set poetry to
music," he continued. "No one does that
here." When he moved to the U.S. 10 years
ago, he decided to continue doing what he
was best at. "That's my thing."
His music in English include songs based
on the works of such poets as Elizabeth Bish
op, Theodore Roethke, Lord Byron, Alberto
Rios and Robert Browning.
He selects his poetry by simply reading
and finding whatever catches his attention
"in a narrative way — a story that I can
identify with. I look for something to be
projected." He then begins the process of

setting the words to music, making sure he
keeps the original meaning of the poem in
tact.
Most of his subjects deal with "relation
ships — love, hate, departures." And almost
all of his selections reflect his experience in
the Israeli military. "There's always a hint of
the way I feel. 1 think most of us don't do
enough to make a difference," he explained.
"We go with the flow. We don't appreciate
what's instilled in us. Mediocrity is the num
ber one enemy of humankind. And it bugs
me."
His two most recent albums, "Second
Street" and "Old Elements of Love" have
been very successful. "Second Street" is in
English and the latter is in Hebrew.
Broza, currently on tour with Journey
ex-frontman Steve Perry, is also working on
two more Hebrew albums and one in Eng
lish.
He also teaches at various universities
throughout the country. "I usually teach cre
ative writing courses — the relationship be
tween poetry and music. That helps me de
velop and mature," Broza explains. "My
music keeps on developing all the time be
cause I'm always on the move."
"I can write an album a week." But Broza
pointed out that the quality wouldn't be very
good. "I don't want to waste people's time.
But I could do it if I had to."

There's little doubt that David Broza can
do anything he wants. When I asked
him where he was going to go from
here, he demonstrated his disgust with the
question by saying calmly, "I plan on walking
backwards from San Francisco to LA." I al
most believed him.
Referring to his sarcasm, I said, "I proba
bly deserved that, didn't I?"
"Yeah," he replied bluntly.
He ended our conversation in what I'm
discovering is a typical Broza fashion. After I
convinced him that it would not be practical
for me to fly to Salt Lake City if I had any last
minute questions, he gave me his permission
to make up whatever I want for the article.
"No one knows me," he pointed out. "And
1 will support whatever you say 100 percent."
He might even have been serious. ■
