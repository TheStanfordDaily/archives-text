# Delt house faces social probation
## Frat becomes second to be reviewed 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Mimicking their actions last
quarter against Sigma Alpha Ep
silon, University officials have
placed the Delta Tau Delta frater
nity on social probation and
formed a committee to review the
Delts' status as a student organi
zation.
Nanci Howe, director of the Of
fice of Student Activities, said the
main reason for the formal review
was "poor house management"
and damage to the Delts' resi
dence. "They had a hard time run
ning their house well and respon
sibly," she said.
The Delts now join the SAEs as
the second fraternity to be put on

social probation this year, forbid
ding members to sponsor any so
cial events on or off campus. How
ever, Fraternal Affairs Advisor
Heather Dunn said that action
against the two fraternities is un
related and does not reflect any
sort of "crackdown" on housed
fraternities.
"SAE's [last] 'straw' was the
second bonfire they held. For the
Delts, it's a sense primarily of on
going damage to their house," cul
minating in a golf cart being dri
ven through a glass window, Dunn
said.
"Those are multi-million dollar
facilities entrusted to stu
dents. . . . It's very sad that they
"This is neither a covert nor an
overt effort to try to eliminate
housed fraternities," Dunn said.
"We try to do everything we can.
We don't go into it on a whim."
Abts praised University offi
cials saying that they "put in a lot
of extra time . . . land] have been
very patient with us. I think
we've shown we are capable of
working with them."
In an effort to change things in
the fraternity, Abts said members
have voted to conduct three edu
cational programs this quarter on
topics such as aggression and col
lective responsibility. The Delts
also plan to have a discussion
with the Lesbian, Gay and Bisex
ual Community Center sometime
in the future.
"I think we'll work out some
thing. We have a lot of things we
need to fix, and the University
will help us do that," Abts said.
He added that the fraternity
has been on campus for almost
102 years. "We can't let recent
negligence ruin that tradition,"
he said.
Members of the committee
reviewing the Delts include stu
dents from the Greek Judicial
Board, faculty, staff and alumni.
Their task will be to look at the
fraternity's recent past and make
recommendations regarding disci
plinary actions to Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson and Diana
Conklin, associate director of Res
idential Education.
Abts said he expects a decision
to be made by the end of this
month or in early February.

have no respect for their own
house," she said. Last year, the
Delts accrued several thousand
dollars in house damage bills,
Dunn added.
"We've been having problems
.. . Ibutl there was no one major
incident" which prompted the
review, said Delt president Doug
Abts, a senior. "We haven't treat
ed the house with the respect it
deserves."
University officials claim they
have already tried several ways to
help the Delts keep their house in
good condition.
"The various sanctions we
have given seemed to have no or
little impact on the behavior of
the organization," Dunn said.
"We do everything we can to give
a group a chance to get their act
together â€” that has not been
what they chose to do."
Although Abts does not believe
the recent actions against SAE
and his fraternity were part of
tougher standards on housed
groups, he did say that the Uni
versity was "stressing collective
responsibility a lot more."
Last month, the University
decided to keep SAE on social pro
bation for the rest of this school
year and keep their housing status
in jeopardy until 1998. The Delts'
residence may also be in danger,
as officials continue to question
both fraternities' housing status.
