# LOCAL ROCK DUO DISPROVES OLD 'POWER-IN-NUMBERS' ADAGE
## 
### EDWIN ONG 
Coyly swaying on a small stage, quietly
tuning his black Rickenbacker in
front of a few dozen of your hip nose
ring / leather jacket types, Kicking Giant's
guitarist Tae Won Yu appeared timid and

out-of-place. With his tiny
frame and short Asian

hair, Tae looked
nothing like the
tierce rock-and
roller you might ex
pect to be headlining
a Haight-Ashbury
club.
Hut when the
music began — with
a monstrous burst of
beautifully overdriv
en guitar crunch that
caught the attention
of everyone in the au
dience (even the mus
cle-shirt-clad bounc
er looked twice) — all
doubts about Kicking
Giant's rock-credibil
ity instantly van
ished.
Calling Kicking
Giant a
"band" seems
unjustified. There are
just too many other
people getting to
gether, making recy
cled noise, and calling
themselves "bands"
for the title to have
any artistic signifi
cance anymore.

Kicking Giant is more like a musical
dialogue between Tae (the guitar guy)
and Rachel Cams (the pretty percussion
princess). They speak in punk, free jazz,
sugar-candy pop and pure poetry.
Imagine the sounds that a collaboration
between the Ramones and Ornette
Coleman may produce — if you can
hear those sounds in your head, you are
already halfway to the sonic landscapes

that Rachel and Tae sculpt.
Art school (Cooper Union)

graduates, Rachel and Tae
formed Kicking Giant in |
New York. Nicer weather '
and the creative atmosphere

of K Records enticed the two to
forsake the Big Apple for Olympia,
Washington in 1991. Rumor have it that
bootleg cassettes of their early projects often

trade hands in Japan and England for a
week's salary.
Their latest K Records release is called
"Alien i-D." No, it is not about green things
that explore the universe in flying saucers
(even though the album often sounds like a
Martian radio broadcast). Rather, it is in
spired by Tae's immigrant experience.
Tae was born in Korea, moved to Japan
when he was three, and came to America at
age seven." 'Alien i-D' is like a reference with
new music, beyond what's so-called 'alterna
tive,' and in a sense it is completely informed
by the experience of being an immigrant,"
Tae uttered in a tender but eloquent voice as
we spoke outside the Haight's Thirsty Swede
after a show.
"Music is a language just as Korean or

English is a language," he said. "I am com
pletely influenced by being a first generation
Asian-American, 1 think my job is merely to
translate that experience into music."

KICKING

CI ANT

Tae may be soft-spoken, but when the
guitar starts screeching and the
drums start pounding (and the
drums really do pound on "Alien i-D"), his
voice mutates into a girlish but ferocious
union of Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan's
emotional howl and Debbie Gibson's penned
cuteness.
From the hard-hitting, identity-searching
title track, in which Tae screams, "You think 1
am introspective but I know I don't exist," be
fore begging to "borrow a part of your life/1
was born but then I fell out" to the pseudo
punk ballad "Appetite" in which he proudly
proclaims the all-too-common-but-still
tragic dilemma "You are my best friend and I
want you" — Tae somehow manages to coat
every layer of his angst-infested vocals with a
sweet, sweet innocence that implores your
deepest sympathy.

Rachel Cams, the other half of Kicking
Giant, plays drums in much the same sweet,
angry way. Eschewing the traditional macho
rock pulse of "bang, bang, baaanng, bang,
bang, baaanng," Rachel adds a decisively lyri
cal approach to her drumming.

Playing like some long-lost punk
niece of virtuoso drummer Max
Roach, Rachel forces you to hear

every different shade and nuance of her com
plicated skin-pounding. The star of Rachel's
drum kit, a kick-drum placed upright (like a
torn or a snare), is often subject to violent hits
by such non-traditional objects as Spanish
maracas and staple guns.
This guitar/drums duet may sound fine
and dandy within the safe confines of a mod
ern studio, where over-dubbing can mask
any barrenness that such a format may create
(although some tracks on "Alien i-

D" were recorded on

a low-fi, low-

budget Tas
cam four
track ma-

chine). 1
was mighty

curious as to how

Kicking Giant would fare live.

The limitation of one guitar and one drum
kit definitely has the potential to make Kick
ing Giant's CD-gorgeous songs sound like
some crapped-out noise shit.
But after one song into their recent Thirsty
Swede set and any intelligent buffoon would
realize that the duet format is in no way re
stricting. Except for one preachy-political

STEPS

spoken piece "The Town Idiot" in which Sue
Fox lends her baby voice to lament about the
"asshole who beats off his own intelligence"
and screams, "I am too ugly to fuck / my
breasts have been sagging / did you know that

internal organs sag also / my heart is sagging
too," Tae and Rachel needed no outside help
to fill Thirsty Swede up with a completely fat
punk V roll sound.

The beauty of Kicking Giant live is
that Tae and Rachel can explore and
improvise without worrying that
their music is going to fall apart. Un
like some fragile band with four or
five members, Tae and Rachel only
need each other's consent before
spontaneously performing some
thing truly interesting — like when
Tae complemented Rachel's already
perfect drumming by picking his
guitar with (of all things) a tam
bourine. This ain't no Sonic-Youth
sc re wdrivers-on-guitar-strings
avant-garde experimentation; even
Kicking Giant's most unorthodox
methods remain musical (at least
most of the time).
Music is not about tech
niques and equip
ment. It's the 'spirit' of
music that is more important," Tae
explained when asked about his
musical philosophy. Much like
jazzers who improvise on old stan
dards, Tae said that "instead of
writing new materials, 1 am trying
to make old songs sound new. It's
like injecting a new spirit into old
music."
"She's Real" — a super-moving
love song released on 7" and re-

made on "Alien i-D" — received such an in
jection live. Instead of gently picking the gui
tar part as he did on the recordings, Tae
danced around his Fender Twin amplifier for
out-of-control feedback that sounded like
the orgasmic moan of some mating beast.
The most incredible thing was that Tae
and Rachel still retained the song's original
sincere passion when they sang, "she's real /
she's real / 1 know my love's real" to the
chaotic harmony of a wild feedback. The
Japanese-American teenage girl standing
next to me (who had traveled all the way
from L.A. to watch the band) almost broke
down in tears as she cried, "This is my fa
vorite KG song."
Kicking Giant composes such creative, al
most visionary music in the midst of today's
mass-produced indie rock that you can't help

but wish them more commercial success.

But when asked about his

desire to reach out to

a bigger audience,

Tae, after a long
pause, calmly
said, "No, I am

satisfied doing what

I am doing."

Perhaps it's the ultimate
punk-rock fear of "selling out" that propelled
Tae's anti-commercial comment. But 1 sin
cerely doubt that Tae and Rachel will have to
worry about compromising all that often.
Kicking Giant's music has such a beautiful,
pure spirit that I think even the nastiest
record companies will have trouble corrupt
ing it. ■
