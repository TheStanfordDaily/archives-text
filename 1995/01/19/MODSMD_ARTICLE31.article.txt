Columnist naen Ping tow
picks the Academy Awards
with an international focus

m * hile 1993 was a year when major
jfawV movies like "Short Cuts,"
"Philadelphia," "The Age of In
nocence" and "Schindler's List" actually
made sense and said something, 1994 saw
Hollywood make a record $5.25 billion at the
domestic box office, but relatively paltry mo
ments of greatness on screen.
Rather, '94 may go down in history as the
year Meryl Streep showed off her whitewater
rafting skills and Tom Cruise sported fangs
and drawn veins. Or it may be remembered
for installing the dream boat pairing of Den
nis Quaid and Kevin Costner in a movie —
"Wyatt Harp" — that somehow managed to
put me to sleep.
Size was certainly not everything last year.
Witness the misogynistic and racist crap by
the innocuous title of "True Lies" that Amer
icans flocked to — Hollywood's gravest trav
esties could not have prepared anyone for

tli is truly
sick ode to
political in
correctness.
Conversely,
the hit
British "class
act" of
"Four Wed
dings and a
Funeral"
was so
harmless
and light
weight that
its deft
charms
swiftly evap
orated with
the end
credits.
Critics
and audi
ences alike
also danced
to the tune
of Holly
wood's cur-

rent pied-piper, Quentin Tarantino. lor all
the hype generated by the too-smart but no
heart "Pulp Fiction," Tarantino is more mas
ter manipulator of pop-cultural artifacts
than transcendental Messiah to deliver
America's celluloid future.
What is more disturbing about America's
worship of Tarantino lies in the sobering re
ality that lately, there are no more gods left
standing on the altar of American cinema.
Robert Alt man and Woody Allen are so com
fortable these days that they appear perfectly
contented with such moderately amusing ex
ercises in self parody as "Pret-a-Porter" and
"Bullets over Broadway."
The perils of success have not spared the
once-infallible Coen brothers — "The 1 lud
sucker Proxy," their most expensive project
to date, was a considerable disappointment.
Neither could enfant terrible John Waters re
capture past glories ("Pink Flamingoes") —
or rather, vintage

indignities —
with the so-so
studio-financed
"Serial Mom." By
the way, does
anyone know
where in the
world David
Lynch ("Wild at
Heart") is now?
In this country
at least, 1994 was
a year when lean
er budgets packed
a far meaner
punch. Several
indepe n d en t s
which received
much-neede d
breaks at Sun
dance wore a dis
tinctive brand of
no-frills honesty
right 011 their
sleeves. Writer
directors David
O. Russell ("Span
king the Mon
key") and Kevin
Smith ("Clerks")
came up with

electrifying debuts, while the stage-trained
Tom Noonan's "What happened was..
could well have been the most haunting piece
of cinema all year.
Being small is certainly no help at the
upcoming Academy Awards though, and
neither is a foreign tongue. So prepare to
cringe as the names of Jodie Foster and
Oliver Stone gel announced at this year's
ceremony — industry-strength message
movies like "Nell' and Natural Born
Killers" tend to get nods from Academy
members despite an unbearable overdose
of earnest didacticism.
Deserving mainstream picks for the Os
cars include Robert Redford's slick but
provocative "Quiz Show" and Tim Burtons
poignant "Fd Wood" though sadly, neither
fared well at the box office. An unexpected,
Oscar-worthy gem is Robert Benton's "No
body's Fool," a keenly-observed slice of
small-town Americana.
Looking beyond the slim Hollywood of
ferings, the picture takes on infinitely richer
hues and textures. Yet, the Oscars remain
deaf to the rumblings of world cinema, elect
ing instead to disqualify "To Live" and "Red"
from the Best Foreign Language Film catego
ry on a much-disputed technicality.
Krzysztof Kieslowski, the sole torch-bearer
of the European film tradition, may have to
retire without ever receiving a single Oscar
nomination for his best work — "The Dou
ble Life ofVeronique," "Blue" and "Red."
Indeed, 1994 marked the decline of inno
vative cinema within traditional bastions like
Furope and America, which took a backseat
to the exciting developments in East Asia.
Last year, Chinese-language films proved
that their 1992-93 sweep of the Venice-
Berlin-Cannes Grand Prix circuit (by "The
Story of Qiu Ju," "The Wedding Banquet"
and "Farewell My Concubine" respectively)
was no fluke.
No previous Chinese-language nominee
has ever been judged worthy enough of the
coveted statuette in the foreign film category;
with Zhang Yimou's "To Live" conveniently
out of the way, the Academy will have an even
easier time denying East Asian filmmakers
their overdue recognition. But the Chinese
are a very patient people.
Here are my picks for the year's best:
'Seat 'Pictccve
Towering over all else in 1994 is the intri
cate politically-charged family drama "To
Live" (China), which barely edges out "Red"
(Switzerland) and "White" (Poland), the
final two installments of the Three Colors
triptych, followed by Hou I Isiaohsien's poet
ic bio-pic "The Puppetmaster" (Taiwan),
"Quiz Show" (USA) and Ray Mueller's re
vealing documentary of a Nazi-collaborating
filmmaker, "The Wonderful, Horrible Life of
Leni Riefenstahl" (Germany).
'Din.ect&i
Krzyzstof Kieslowski ends his career on a
high note with the profoundly humanist con
cerns of "Red." Runners-up are 1 long Kong
art-film maverick Wong Kar-wai ("Chungking
Express," "Ashes of Time"), still-irrepressible
Pedro Almodovar ("Kika"), the undeniably in
ventive Quentin Tarantino ("Pulp Fiction")
and Tom Noonan ("What happened was...")
for showing such intriguing promise.
Seal /Veto*
Transitions between comedy and tragedy

are made to look so effortless by Ge You ( "To
Live"), whose role as Fugui was an absolute
joy to behold. Close behind are Terence
Stamp ("The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen
of the Desert"), Jean-Louis Trintignant
("Red") and Ralph Fiennes ("Quiz Show").
And no matter what the Academy calls him,
Samuel L. Jackson was a devastating laid
actor as "Pulp Fiction"'s evangelical gangster
in my book.
'Seat s4cfrie&±
Five newcomers managed to outshine
safe-playing veterans. Karen Sillas ("What
Happened Was...") tops the list by infusing
uncommon sensitivity in a disturbed charac
ter on the brink of breaking apart. Melanie
Lynskey and Kate Winslet ("Heavenly Crea
tures") were both memorable in "Heavenly
Creatures," as were Alberta Watson ("Spank
ing the Monkey") and Alia ("Ermo") as the
willful protagonist.
'Seat Sufefc&i ti*ty factor
Martin Landau ("Ed Wood"), who brings
Bela Lugosi back to life with tenderness, leads
a field distinguished by Pruitt Taylor Vince
("Nobody's Fool") as Paul Newman's best
friend, Chazz Palminteri ("Bullets Over
Broadway") as the play-writing hood, Paul
Scofield ("Quiz Show") as the dignified Mark
Van Doren and Bruce Willis ("Pulp Fiction )
playing to type.
SufcfuvUitty s4ctne&i
Dianne Wiest's comedic turn is the singu
lar reason to watch "Bullets over Broadway.
Also worthy of mention are feisty Amanda
Plummer ("Pulp Fiction"), prodigious
Kirsten Dunst ("Interview with the Vam
pire"), venerable Luisina Brando ("1 Don't
Want to Talk about It") and the fitting swan
song of the late Jessica Tandy ("Nobody's
Fool"). ■
