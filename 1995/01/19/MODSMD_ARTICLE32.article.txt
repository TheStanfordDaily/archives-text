# Don't look too closely and 'Grease' sizzles
## 
### Linda friedlieb 
I ven old age can't kill the spirit of
"Grease!" In this case, "old" refers
the actors, who probably aver
age closer to middle age than high-school
age (and here we're not counting Sally
Struthers and Davy Jones, whose roles call
for semi-geriatric persona).
But fortunately their age hasn't killed
their energy, and it is sheer energy that
powers this slightly over-the-top produc
tion of the Broadway hit. The cast has so
much energy and enthusiasm, in fact, that
it we sit far enough back or high enough
up in San Francisco's Golden Gate The
atre, we can convince ourselves that the
actors on stage really are hormone-filled
teenagers.
Much like the cast's energy, everything
about this version of "Grease!" is larger
than life — the colors are bright neon
shades, the music is loud, and the sound
of Miss I ynch's (Struthers) whistle is ear
piercing.
But somehow, if we don't analyze it too
closely, it works. We are transformed back
to the 1950s and Rydell High School.
However, disappointment will come to
those who are banking on the same Rydell
they remember from the 1978 John Tra
volta-Olivia Newton-John wonderfilm.
Sandy's last name is Dumbrowski, not
Olson; 1 lopelessly Devoted to You is not
part of the score; "Freddy, My I.ove" is;
and to be frank, Rex Smith is just not as
cute as Travolta used to be.
There's a reason that this production of
"Grease" is part of the Best of liroadway
season. No one ever said it was best of I in
seltown.
Directed and choreographed by
Jeff Calhoun, "Grease" is fast
paced — a roller-coaster ride
through the era of hula hoops, poodle
skirts and the hand jive. The motions are
quick and angular, with overemphasized
pelvic thrusts thrown in here and there to
remind us of the not-so-underlying sexu
al themes.
Trisha M. Gorman, as Sandy, brings the
right combination of wide-eyed inno
cence and youth to her role. In contrast,
Smith lends experience to his, having
made his own Broadway debut in the mu
sical role of Danny Zuko years ago.

lbgether they have the chemistry and
charisma to pull off this classic bad-boy
meets good-girl love affair.
"All in the Family" dit/ Sally Struthers

puts her high, nasal voice to good use as
the English teacher Miss Lynch, as she ac
cuses audience members of chewing gum
and being late for class. Both Struthers

and Davy Jones, as double-talking DJ
Vince Fontaine, reach out to us to literally
pull us away from our '90s sensibilities by
involving us in the drama.
We aren't supposed to be watching Ry
dell High — rather, we're supposed to be
part of the shared memory, old friends at
a reunion.
In his own 30-minute, pre-curtain "radio
show," Jones, dressed ostentatiously in a
black and white suit with distinctively dif
ferent patterns on the jacket and the pants,
seems at times comfortable and other times
uneasy as he tries to warm up the crowd.
Yet somehow our "main flame Vince
I ontainc" still remains a bit of a Monkee.
The rest of the ensemble cast, led by
Angela Pupello as Betty Rizzo and Dou
glas Crawford as Kenickie, uses strong
voices and enthusiasm to overcome the
gap between their own ages and their
characters'.
While "Grease" retains all of the music
from the original Broadway production,
some numbers are altered in production.
"Beauty School Dropout" sung by Teen
Angel (Kevin-Anthony) has become some
thing between a revival show and an off
tile wall, I.as Vegas-style extravaganza.
Overall, the costumes and scenery
make the production more than worth
seeing. Neon microphones pop out of toi
lets and the school cafeteria sports a sign
advertising chipped beef on toast, crossed
out by an enterprising student to reveal
the naked truth about "shit on a shingle."
And the naked truth about this play is
that the sum is more than the parts; indi
vidual flaws can't take away the heat of the
guilty pleasure of watching "Grease Light
ning. ■
