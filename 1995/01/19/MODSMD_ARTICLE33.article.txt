# 'There's no training for being famous'
## Reflections on a career: TOM HANKS 
### Ed Yoon 
It's easy to dislike Tom Hanks. He talks in a
loud voice, for one thing, and he cackles.
I le is also one of those people who can, by
dint of unlearned charm and confidence,
make a room of tired, overworked people
who spend entirely too much time with each
other laugh. And these are people who make
their living working right next to big-name
celebrities. Not like you and me, who feel
strange standing in the presence of a "movie
star."
He is also tall — about ft feet — which
makes him even less likable.
There's always little delays that manage to
halt an entire movie production — a light
needs to be adjusted, a prop's suddenly miss
ing, a mike decides to die, somebody's hair
doesn't look right. This is the time when
everyone stands around, waits and thinks
about how these delays add to a I a.m. wrap
time — and when you can hear I lanks cackle.
He likes to trade barbs with whomever s
available — director, co-star, production as
sistant — it doesn't matter to him. He likes a
struggle too — that way he can dance in cir
cles around you and rip you to little bits with
a series of well-aimed verbal thrusts, especial
ly if you're just an intern hoping to do an in
terview for"The Stanford Fishwrapper"
(Thanks, Tom — eds.).
It isn't surprising to hear that he considers
this sort of hangout time to be the most en
joyable part of filmmaking. It's as if he pos
sesses a store of irrepressible energy that has
to be released now and then before it con
sumes him. But it never gets the better of him,
at least while he's working. He doesn't fall into
a post-manic slump. And when he is quiet, he
enjoys his moments of private reflection.
In his "interview mode," he's serious, at
tentive. No facial gymnastics. But he talks at a
high clip and once you feed him a question, he
will not only answer it but will nimbly move
to your follow-up before you have a chance to
ask. He likes that kind of mental agility.
In his trailer — a silver pill-shaped
Airstreamer equipped with such important
amenities as TV, VCR and a phone — he
makes a latte (he's an inveterate coffee
drinker, as you might have guessed). It has
been a cold winter in Los Angeles, and the
heater in his trailer hums steadily. Sitting be
hind a minuscule wooden table, he snaps his
finger like he wants to rumble — "Ask your
questions, ask your questions, man, come on,
come on!"
W'rcsilitK) with fame
We've been working on "Apollo 13," Ron

Howard's latest directorial effort, which is
due for release this summer, for several
months now. I as the intern, he as the movie
star. As such, Hanks has run the inevitable
media gauntlet that accompanies fame and
seems to have emerged battered, but alive.
Last June's Vanity Fair, for instance, eagerly
probed the tales of his troubled, peripatetic
childhood, his current and prior marriage,
and other bits of coveted gossip that are the
stock and trade of celebrity profiles
"There's not training for being famous,"
he says, taking a swig from his latte. "It can
corrupt you, but only if you're corruptible.

The trade-off pretty much evens out, 1
think, as long as you maintain some
sort of even keel. It takes a while to get
used to, though
"For a while it's glamorous, and for
a while it's fun, and then for a while it's
horrible and it's a trap that you can
never escape. And then it becomes this
thing you crave and despise at the
same time."
I lanks, now 38, has several children
the oldest a teenager, the youngest, a
toddler — so he lives apart from the
1 .A. glamour-boy lifestyle. No trashing
pricey 1..A. hotel rooms. No squabbles
with the law over carrying concealed
handguns. Passing a quiet weekend at
the beach with his wife and kids, maybe
seeing a few close friends, is pleasure
enough. But he realizes that the burden
of stardom presses on all of them.

"The stuff that I get for free — you
wouldn't believe it,"he says, as though it were
still new to him, even though it's been more
than a decade since his first big film, "Splash."
"The free pass, the cuts in line, it's quite
unbelievable — so much that you gotta pro
tect your family. Otherwise life becomes too
easy. But how do you tell somebody, 'Hey,
your life isn't going to be as it is when you're
with me. You're not always going to get cuts in
Disneyland.' "
Setting concrete boundaries seems to help.
For instance, he vows

that no one from
the media will
ever, ever be al
lowed to set foot
in his house. Of
those bits of life
that remain pri
vate, he is fiercely
protective.

"You have to compartmentalize your life,"
he says."I don't want to have to constantly
sneak out of places. I do that, but not all the
time. Then it takes you over, and you can't let
it take you over. You learn when you can be
private and then you protect it. But when
you've given something up as public, there's
no making it private."
Hanks thinks he's had it relatively easy,
however. "I've been lucky," he says. "Because I
had a tiny amount of celebrity that slowly
grew. It's got to be horrifying to somebody to
whom it happens like that — pow. That's
where you see people flip out."

WrestliiKj with fame
I lanks describes his younger days in a
similar tone of modesty. He was energetic,
but hardly the angry and alienated lames-
Dean type.
"I wasn't the anarchist," he says."I was the
gang leader, the guy who'd try to convince
everyone to put their shirts on backwards or
something like that. Helped form a kazoo
band. The high school teachers liked me —
that was the difference.
"i *: •*.. i .M..

'I didn t question authority. 1 was actually
energetic, enthusiastic pretty much about
anything, except chemistry or something like
that."
Hanks tinkered with a few plays in high
school, but even after entering college he
didn't rush right into drama.
"I sort of hated the other people in drama
in college because 1 thought they were pointy
assed people, that were breaking into musical

numbers with high-button shoes," he says.
"I took drama classes because they were
lun and were great places to expend ener
gy. But 1 thought in college you had to be
collegiate somehow and study sociology
or zoology or biology."

Working as a bellboy at an Oakland
hotel while attending Chabot Commu
nity College in Hayward, Hanks didn't
have much time to audition for plays,
which limited his participation in the

drama department.
"My boss — Lou Rice was

his name, he's dead now — he
said, 'Why are you going to

school?' and I said, '1 don't
know.' He said, 'Well, what
are you studying?' aiul 1 said,
I think I'm studying theater
— I think.' He said, 'Are you
in plays and stuff?' And I

said, 'No, because I gotta work on the week
ends.' "
His boss changed his hours. Hanks ther
auditioned for the part of George Gibbs ii
"Our Town," and got the part. In addition t<
this career milestone, certain drama classes a
Chabot College helped pull him into theater.
"I took this class, called 'Drama in Perfor
mance.' "
For that class, 1 lanks read and viewed loca
productions of five major plays: "The Hot 1
Baltimore," "Desire Under the Elms," "Tin\
Alice," "The Good Woman of Szechuan" anc
"The Iceman Cometh."

Hanks had finally been drawn in. "['Apol
lo 13' co-supporting cast member Joe
Spano's] the reason I became an actor," lie
says. "His performance as Rocky the bar
tender (in"The Iceman Cometh") made what
I thought was almost an impossible thing

come to life for over the course of four hours,
and that altered me forever."
The thematic analysis that Hanks learned
in school still remains. "Everything has a the
matic thrust, and it's whether or not the
theme can withstand the scrutiny of the pro
duction," he says. "1 remember seeing 'The
1 lot I. Baltimore' and I asked the director after
the production, 'What is it you're trying to say
with this? and he just said, 'Well, that the
world is screwed up.' I remember thinking,

the world is screwed up — that's it?
End of discussion?"

After spending a year at
Chabot, Hanks decided to
transfer to a larger university.

"I went to the Cal State-Sacra
mento desk because I'd been
there in a one-act play in high

school, and I said, 'I think I'd
like to go to your college be
cause it's the only one I know.' "
Hanks had heard of other

schools in the Bay Area. "I couldn't
get into Stanford," he says, grinning

impishly and waving me off. "I didn't
have the grades, man. Sacramento had

a big, active drama department and not a
lot of people in it, so you could do what you

wanted to do. So when I got into Sacra
mento I said, 'I'd like to run lights.' "

By the time he was 24, after working at
the Cleveland Repertory Theater — per

forming such works as "Juno and the Pea
cock," "King John" and "Two Gentlemen of
Verona" — Hanks landed a lead part in a sit

com called "Bosom Buddies." He moved to
Los Angeles, joining all the other struggling
actors of the world, taped an episode of "The
Love Boat," and moved on to what would be
come a hit show.
"I got the job tor 'Bosom Buddies' proba
bly because I was so pumped up on nervous
adrenaline during the auditions," he says.
"And 1 had high energy comic pieces that I
was doing. I had more energy than possibly
the room could stand because 1 was so
scared."
Working in television brought a new set of
challenges. "TV was hard," he says."I was op-

erating on lOC
percent adrena
line and enthusi
asm, doing any
thing I was told.
The first season,
all I did was yell.
It was hard not to
literally scream
every line. Look
at the early
episodes of
Bosom Buddies.'
I yell every line
because I didn't
know how it
worked."
By the
time the show
had run dry,
Hanks felt ready

to move on. He'd
picked up some important lessons on how to
act for the camera and he'd made good
money, hut now he was trying to break into
the movies, running from audition to audi
tion. Having been turned down already from
"a million" theater companies, Broad-

way plays and off-Broadway plays,
rejections didn't faze him.
"I didn't want to be an out
of-work actor in LA.," he says,
talking about what was a most un-

pleasant life back then, when he
was trying to support a house and

two kids. "That's rough, man. I'm
from the Bay Area and I hated L.A.
anyway."
Eventually, he

made himself known to
the right people.

I was reading for
the movies every

chance I got,"

he says.
"There were
a couple

movies I
was up
i for and
they
broke my
heart be
cause I
didn't get
them. And
then
'Splash'
ca m e
along. In
the casting
circles,
once you
begin to

o - * *
get up and

get close on some movies, well,
then you're a guy whose getting
close on movies, and you can
play that potential off on other
people."

i r —
But "Splash" did come
along — if only be-

cause the studio

couldn't find any
one else to take the
part — and it es
tablished him as
an actor. But he
..... *:n

was still young, and con
scious of his deficiencies.
"You learn the difference
between playing for the back
row in a 1500-seat house and

playing for the video tape
player which is right in front of
you," he says."It took a long
time for me to figure that out. So

much of your twenties is just
putting your head down and try
ing to establish not just a toehold,
but a beach head.
"When I was 25 I knew that I

didn't know a lot. I've never been
one to say, 'I know how to do this.'
I've always been of the school:
'Gee, 1 hope they don't catch me
not knowing how to do this, be
cause then I'll be in big trouble.' j
I knew then that I'd probably
have to get my ass kicked a lot be
fore I'd be able to figure things
out. That's still the case." *

Walkinc) a Minefield
Hanks doesn't get sensitive when asked
about some of the dogs in his career. He men
tions "The Man with One Red Shoe." To him
failures are an inevitable part of the process.
"You only really learn by failure," he says.
"If you do it right, how do you really know
what you did? You're always walking on a
minefield."
By the time he's committed to performing
a scene in a certain way, it's difficult to predict
whether his performance will hold true in the
final cut of the movie. Even after 20 or so
films.
"If I really try and think about it, and try to
dig it up, I could probably find the root of it,"
he says."I could do the same thing with 'For
rest Gump.' I could do the same thing with
'Bonfire of the Vanities.' I could tell you why I
made every one of those choices, probably —
hut you don't know if it's going to work or
not. You have no idea. Something else defines
that. It has to come off in a mix."
"With films you never have the moment
where it's all yours. The director adds music,
he takes it away. He plays it in a close up, he
cuts away from you. You're always involved in
the ensemble, the cumulative effort that you
have no control over whatsoever. In that mix
anything can happen.
Anointed with lavish studio attention, ex
travagant budgets and A list stars, some films
go on to die horrific deaths, while other stroll
off with swarms of ticket buyers and adoring
critics. No one can figure out how this occurs.
So for Hanks, getting it right is often a matter
of faith — especially since there's no back
tracking when the shot's done. No one relies
on reshoots to make the performance work.
"You can't change it — it only is what it is,"
he says, with only a little exaggeration. "The

stuff you thought was great, stinks; the stuff
you thought stinks, is great. It's a horrible,
horrible position to be in. It's always like
that. The movie is a comprehensive whole,
and when it works you bow down to the

'"VII II "VI IVO JV/Cl l/WV* IiVSYVU Hi lilt
great god Pelicula and pay homage
and thanks.
"Bob Zemeckis (director of

"Forest Gump") says movies
are binary — they're either
zero or one. There's nothing
in between. I agree. It either
works, or it doesn't work. And

it it doesn't work, there's no
way you can explain what you
did wrong. And if it does
work, there's no idea you can
recreate it on the next one."

answers. I he uncertainty inherent in ar
guing for a particular vision and mak
ing it come to life is what excites
Hanks. But much of the day-to-day
routine can be tedious. The 14-hour

days, the stifling existence of spending
weeks in a trailer and standing around

sets in the middle of nowhere — but
having always to be ready to perform —

make it less than simple.
When describing acting, he borrows an
analogy gained from a recent evening watch
ing Ken Burns' baseball documentary.
"You're standing in left field and the guy's
throwing a pitch, and you have to be ready to
go in any of 360 decrees in order to make a

111 UIIY vi ./VV V.VD 111 VIUV.I IV 111 cl rvv. a
play, and that requires equipoise — it requires
concentration and relaxation," he says. "That's
what acting is. In the course of making a
movie, you have to have equipoise, you have to
be ready for the knock on the door that says,
'Come on, do the thing.' And then you get up
and do it."
lust keeping up with the constant script
changes and meetings with the director helps
impose an organic wholeness to Hanks' role,
even when the film is shot out of sequence. He
guesses that he will have read a script about 50
times before he even faces a camera.
"You find that when you've read it as many
times as you have, that it all makes sense to you
somehow," he says. "It's not that often that it's
all just lines and words. It's a whole idea that
you've already worked out in your head."
And again, there must he that thematic un
derpinning to support the story. The scripts
that flood Hanks' office .it 20th Century Fox
— named Clavius Base after Kubrick's "2001"
(Hanks' is a sci-fi fan) — are far afield from the
works of O'Neil and Brecht that he once read
as an undergraduate at Chabot. But the same
questions still apply.
"You've gotta have a theme," he says. "It's
got to be about something — it might be one
of the seven stories about the human condi
tion, whatever those are. ... It can't just be a
performance piece; it can't just be a one-man
show.
"I don't know how many movies I've done,
20 or something. But I hope that each one has
revolved around some sort of thematic ele
ment. As I've had a chance to do broader stuff,
its been better, but I hope that everything has
been about some aspect of the human condi
tion."
"IlieOiilij Y(ir( ism kJ( >rSi«(< *.ss'

In Hollywood, everyone talks about the
here-today, gone-tomorrow careers, the one
hit wonders, the kind of stories that make Hol
lywood a place of evanescent dreams. But per
haps just as numerous are those who manage
to survive and continue to work, only to be
worn down into a state of jaded complacency
and cynicism.
Whether by luck or through a kind of kill
ful maneuvering that belies his guy-next- loor
persona, Hanks, after more than 10 years
hanging out in Tinseltown, still seems excited
about his work — a bellboy just glad to be
given the opportunity to put on a show.
"It's the same thing as it was in the begin
ning," he says. "Look, the lights and the pre
miers and the trophies and all that, that stuff's
really great. But it's the reason that you do it.
It's more fun than fun. These jobs where you
get to put on other people's clothes and pre
tend to be somebody is very glamorous; it was
glamorous when I was just trying to do it in
front ot 115 people in college—and you know
not everybody can do it."
As with other aspects of his personal life,
I lanks insists on a sense of clarity, a set of sim
ple rules, about what he believes later years
will bring. As usual, his plainspeaking style
when discussing his goals and ethos seems out
of place with his backslapping, cackling, wise
ass self. But you get the feeling that behind the
gags he's focused, looking beyond his next
joke or put-down, checking carefully to make
sure that he's traveling the course that he's
mapped out for himself.
"Longevity, that's the only yardstick for
success," he says."I said that on the press jun
ket for 'Splash.' Nothing else matters. It mat
ters to be able to work at a certain level and do
a certain kind of work continuously.
"The commercial aspects of it are always
going to come and go, but if what drives you to
make the choices in the first place are constant,
you can never really go wrong. You'll fail,
you'll succeed — probably in the same ratios
as you always have. But the desire is just to do
the same type of work." ■

Ron Howard's "Apollo 13."

forming such works as "Juno and the Pea
cock," "King John" and "Two Gentlemen of
Verona" — Hanks landed a lead part in a sit

com called "Bosom Buddies." He moved to
Los Angeles, joining all the other struggling
actors of the world, taped an episode of "The
Love Boat," and moved on to what would be
come a hit show.
"I got the job tor 'Bosom Buddies' proba
bly because I was so pumped up on nervous
adrenaline during the auditions," he says.
"And 1 had high energy comic pieces that I
was doing. I had more energy than possibly
the room could stand because 1 was so
scared."
Working in television brought a new set of
challenges. "TV was hard," he says."I was op-

erating on lOC
percent adrena
line and enthusi
asm, doing any
thing I was told.
The first season,
all I did was yell.
It was hard not to
literally scream
every line. Look
at the early
episodes of
Bosom Buddies.'
I yell every line
because I didn't
know how it
worked."
By the
time the show
had run dry,
Hanks felt ready

to move on. He'd
picked up some important lessons on how to
act for the camera and he'd made good
money, hut now he was trying to break into
the movies, running from audition to audi
tion. Having been turned down already from
"a million" theater companies, Broad-

way plays and off-Broadway plays,
rejections didn't faze him.
"I didn't want to be an out
of-work actor in LA.," he says,
talking about what was a most un-

pleasant life back then, when he
was trying to support a house and

two kids. "That's rough, man. I'm
from the Bay Area and I hated L.A.
anyway."
Eventually, he

made himself known to
the right people.

I was reading for
the movies every

chance I got,"

he says.
"There were
a couple

movies I
was up
i for and
they
broke my
heart be
cause I
didn't get
them. And
then
'Splash'
ca m e
along. In
the casting
circles,
once you
begin to

o - * *
get up and

get close on some movies, well,
then you're a guy whose getting
close on movies, and you can
play that potential off on other
people."

i r —
But "Splash" did come
along — if only be-

cause the studio

couldn't find any
one else to take the
part — and it es
tablished him as
an actor. But he
..... *:n

was still young, and con
scious of his deficiencies.
"You learn the difference
between playing for the back
row in a 1500-seat house and

playing for the video tape
player which is right in front of
you," he says."It took a long
time for me to figure that out. So

much of your twenties is just
putting your head down and try
ing to establish not just a toehold,
but a beach head.
"When I was 25 I knew that I

didn't know a lot. I've never been
one to say, 'I know how to do this.'
I've always been of the school:
'Gee, 1 hope they don't catch me
not knowing how to do this, be
cause then I'll be in big trouble.' j
I knew then that I'd probably
have to get my ass kicked a lot be
fore I'd be able to figure things
out. That's still the case." *

Walkinc) a Minefield
Hanks doesn't get sensitive when asked
about some of the dogs in his career. He men
tions "The Man with One Red Shoe." To him
failures are an inevitable part of the process.
"You only really learn by failure," he says.
"If you do it right, how do you really know
what you did? You're always walking on a
minefield."
By the time he's committed to performing
a scene in a certain way, it's difficult to predict
whether his performance will hold true in the
final cut of the movie. Even after 20 or so
films.
"If I really try and think about it, and try to
dig it up, I could probably find the root of it,"
he says."I could do the same thing with 'For
rest Gump.' I could do the same thing with
'Bonfire of the Vanities.' I could tell you why I
made every one of those choices, probably —
hut you don't know if it's going to work or
not. You have no idea. Something else defines
that. It has to come off in a mix."
"With films you never have the moment
where it's all yours. The director adds music,
he takes it away. He plays it in a close up, he
cuts away from you. You're always involved in
the ensemble, the cumulative effort that you
have no control over whatsoever. In that mix
anything can happen.
Anointed with lavish studio attention, ex
travagant budgets and A list stars, some films
go on to die horrific deaths, while other stroll
off with swarms of ticket buyers and adoring
critics. No one can figure out how this occurs.
So for Hanks, getting it right is often a matter
of faith — especially since there's no back
tracking when the shot's done. No one relies
on reshoots to make the performance work.
"You can't change it — it only is what it is,"
he says, with only a little exaggeration. "The

stuff you thought was great, stinks; the stuff
you thought stinks, is great. It's a horrible,
horrible position to be in. It's always like
that. The movie is a comprehensive whole,
and when it works you bow down to the

"Bob Zemeckis (director of

did wrong. And if it does

make it less than simple.
When describing acting, he borrows an
analogy gained from a recent evening watch
ing Ken Burns' baseball documentary.
"You're standing in left field and the guy's
throwing a pitch, and you have to be ready to
go in any of 360 decrees in order to make a

111 UIIY vi ./VV V.VD 111 VIUV.I IV 111 cl rvv. a
play, and that requires equipoise — it requires
concentration and relaxation," he says. "That's
what acting is. In the course of making a
movie, you have to have equipoise, you have to
be ready for the knock on the door that says,
'Come on, do the thing.' And then you get up
and do it."
lust keeping up with the constant script
changes and meetings with the director helps
impose an organic wholeness to Hanks' role,
even when the film is shot out of sequence. He
guesses that he will have read a script about 50
times before he even faces a camera.
"You find that when you've read it as many
times as you have, that it all makes sense to you
somehow," he says. "It's not that often that it's
all just lines and words. It's a whole idea that
you've already worked out in your head."
And again, there must he that thematic un
derpinning to support the story. The scripts
that flood Hanks' office .it 20th Century Fox
— named Clavius Base after Kubrick's "2001"
(Hanks' is a sci-fi fan) — are far afield from the
works of O'Neil and Brecht that he once read
as an undergraduate at Chabot. But the same
questions still apply.
"You've gotta have a theme," he says. "It's
got to be about something — it might be one
of the seven stories about the human condi
tion, whatever those are. ... It can't just be a
performance piece; it can't just be a one-man
show.
"I don't know how many movies I've done,
20 or something. But I hope that each one has
revolved around some sort of thematic ele
ment. As I've had a chance to do broader stuff,
its been better, but I hope that everything has
been about some aspect of the human condi
tion."
"IlieOiilij Y(ir( ism kJ( >rSi«(< *.ss'

In Hollywood, everyone talks about the
here-today, gone-tomorrow careers, the one
hit wonders, the kind of stories that make Hol
lywood a place of evanescent dreams. But per
haps just as numerous are those who manage
to survive and continue to work, only to be
worn down into a state of jaded complacency
and cynicism.
Whether by luck or through a kind of kill
ful maneuvering that belies his guy-next- loor
persona, Hanks, after more than 10 years
hanging out in Tinseltown, still seems excited
about his work — a bellboy just glad to be
given the opportunity to put on a show.
"It's the same thing as it was in the begin
ning," he says. "Look, the lights and the pre
miers and the trophies and all that, that stuff's
really great. But it's the reason that you do it.
It's more fun than fun. These jobs where you
get to put on other people's clothes and pre
tend to be somebody is very glamorous; it was
glamorous when I was just trying to do it in
front ot 115 people in college—and you know
not everybody can do it."
As with other aspects of his personal life,
I lanks insists on a sense of clarity, a set of sim
ple rules, about what he believes later years
will bring. As usual, his plainspeaking style
when discussing his goals and ethos seems out
of place with his backslapping, cackling, wise
ass self. But you get the feeling that behind the
gags he's focused, looking beyond his next
joke or put-down, checking carefully to make
sure that he's traveling the course that he's
mapped out for himself.
"Longevity, that's the only yardstick for
success," he says."I said that on the press jun
ket for 'Splash.' Nothing else matters. It mat
ters to be able to work at a certain level and do
a certain kind of work continuously.
"The commercial aspects of it are always
going to come and go, but if what drives you to
make the choices in the first place are constant,
you can never really go wrong. You'll fail,
you'll succeed — probably in the same ratios
as you always have. But the desire is just to do
the same type of work." ■

Ed Yoon, a recent Stanford graduate, worked as
a production intern for Hank's latest project,
Ron Howard's "Apollo 13."

It's easy to dislike Tom Hanks. He talks in a
loud voice, for one thing, and he cackles.
I le is also one of those people who can, by
dint of unlearned charm and confidence,
make a room of tired, overworked people
who spend entirely too much time with each
other laugh. And these are people who make
their living working right next to big-name
celebrities. Not like you and me, who feel
strange standing in the presence of a "movie
star."
He is also tall — about ft feet — which
makes him even less likable.
There's always little delays that manage to
halt an entire movie production — a light
needs to be adjusted, a prop's suddenly miss
ing, a mike decides to die, somebody's hair
doesn't look right. This is the time when
everyone stands around, waits and thinks
about how these delays add to a I a.m. wrap
time — and when you can hear I lanks cackle.
He likes to trade barbs with whomever s
available — director, co-star, production as
sistant — it doesn't matter to him. He likes a
struggle too — that way he can dance in cir
cles around you and rip you to little bits with
a series of well-aimed verbal thrusts, especial
ly if you're just an intern hoping to do an in
terview for"The Stanford Fishwrapper"
(Thanks, Tom — eds.).
It isn't surprising to hear that he considers
this sort of hangout time to be the most en
joyable part of filmmaking. It's as if he pos
sesses a store of irrepressible energy that has
to be released now and then before it con
sumes him. But it never gets the better of him,
at least while he's working. He doesn't fall into
a post-manic slump. And when he is quiet, he
enjoys his moments of private reflection.
In his "interview mode," he's serious, at
tentive. No facial gymnastics. But he talks at a
high clip and once you feed him a question, he
will not only answer it but will nimbly move
to your follow-up before you have a chance to
ask. He likes that kind of mental agility.
In his trailer — a silver pill-shaped
Airstreamer equipped with such important
amenities as TV, VCR and a phone — he
makes a latte (he's an inveterate coffee
drinker, as you might have guessed). It has
been a cold winter in Los Angeles, and the
heater in his trailer hums steadily. Sitting be
hind a minuscule wooden table, he snaps his
finger like he wants to rumble — "Ask your
questions, ask your questions, man, come on,
come on!"
W'rcsilitK) with fame
We've been working on "Apollo 13," Ron

Howard's latest directorial effort, which is
due for release this summer, for several
months now. I as the intern, he as the movie
star. As such, Hanks has run the inevitable
media gauntlet that accompanies fame and
seems to have emerged battered, but alive.
Last June's Vanity Fair, for instance, eagerly
probed the tales of his troubled, peripatetic
childhood, his current and prior marriage,
and other bits of coveted gossip that are the
stock and trade of celebrity profiles
"There's not training for being famous,"
he says, taking a swig from his latte. "It can
corrupt you, but only if you're corruptible.

The trade-off pretty much evens out, 1
think, as long as you maintain some
sort of even keel. It takes a while to get
used to, though
"For a while it's glamorous, and for
a while it's fun, and then for a while it's
horrible and it's a trap that you can
never escape. And then it becomes this
thing you crave and despise at the
same time."
I lanks, now 38, has several children
the oldest a teenager, the youngest, a
toddler — so he lives apart from the
1 .A. glamour-boy lifestyle. No trashing
pricey 1..A. hotel rooms. No squabbles
with the law over carrying concealed
handguns. Passing a quiet weekend at
the beach with his wife and kids, maybe
seeing a few close friends, is pleasure
enough. But he realizes that the burden
of stardom presses on all of them.

"The stuff that I get for free — you
wouldn't believe it,"he says, as though it were
still new to him, even though it's been more
than a decade since his first big film, "Splash."
"The free pass, the cuts in line, it's quite
unbelievable — so much that you gotta pro
tect your family. Otherwise life becomes too
easy. But how do you tell somebody, 'Hey,
your life isn't going to be as it is when you're
with me. You're not always going to get cuts in
Disneyland.' "
Setting concrete boundaries seems to help.
For instance, he vows

that no one from
the media will
ever, ever be al
lowed to set foot
in his house. Of
those bits of life
that remain pri
vate, he is fiercely
protective.

"You have to compartmentalize your life,"
he says."I don't want to have to constantly
sneak out of places. I do that, but not all the
time. Then it takes you over, and you can't let
it take you over. You learn when you can be
private and then you protect it. But when
you've given something up as public, there's
no making it private."
Hanks thinks he's had it relatively easy,
however. "I've been lucky," he says. "Because I
had a tiny amount of celebrity that slowly
grew. It's got to be horrifying to somebody to
whom it happens like that — pow. That's
where you see people flip out."

WrestliiKj with fame
I lanks describes his younger days in a
similar tone of modesty. He was energetic,
but hardly the angry and alienated lames-
Dean type.
"I wasn't the anarchist," he says."I was the
gang leader, the guy who'd try to convince
everyone to put their shirts on backwards or
something like that. Helped form a kazoo
band. The high school teachers liked me —
that was the difference.
"i *: •*.. i .M..

'I didn t question authority. 1 was actually
energetic, enthusiastic pretty much about
anything, except chemistry or something like
that."
Hanks tinkered with a few plays in high
school, but even after entering college he
didn't rush right into drama.
"I sort of hated the other people in drama
in college because 1 thought they were pointy
assed people, that were breaking into musical

numbers with high-button shoes," he says.
"I took drama classes because they were
lun and were great places to expend ener
gy. But 1 thought in college you had to be
collegiate somehow and study sociology
or zoology or biology."

Working as a bellboy at an Oakland
hotel while attending Chabot Commu
nity College in Hayward, Hanks didn't
have much time to audition for plays,
which limited his participation in the

drama department.
"My boss — Lou Rice was

his name, he's dead now — he
said, 'Why are you going to

school?' and I said, '1 don't
know.' He said, 'Well, what
are you studying?' aiul 1 said,
I think I'm studying theater
— I think.' He said, 'Are you
in plays and stuff?' And I

said, 'No, because I gotta work on the week
ends.' "
His boss changed his hours. Hanks ther
auditioned for the part of George Gibbs ii
"Our Town," and got the part. In addition t<
this career milestone, certain drama classes a
Chabot College helped pull him into theater.
"I took this class, called 'Drama in Perfor
mance.' "
For that class, 1 lanks read and viewed loca
productions of five major plays: "The Hot 1
Baltimore," "Desire Under the Elms," "Tin\
Alice," "The Good Woman of Szechuan" anc
"The Iceman Cometh."

Hanks had finally been drawn in. "['Apol
lo 13' co-supporting cast member Joe
Spano's] the reason I became an actor," lie
says. "His performance as Rocky the bar
tender (in"The Iceman Cometh") made what
I thought was almost an impossible thing

come to life for over the course of four hours,
and that altered me forever."
The thematic analysis that Hanks learned
in school still remains. "Everything has a the
matic thrust, and it's whether or not the
theme can withstand the scrutiny of the pro
duction," he says. "1 remember seeing 'The
1 lot I. Baltimore' and I asked the director after
the production, 'What is it you're trying to say
with this? and he just said, 'Well, that the
world is screwed up.' I remember thinking,

the world is screwed up — that's it?
End of discussion?"

After spending a year at
Chabot, Hanks decided to
transfer to a larger university.

"I went to the Cal State-Sacra
mento desk because I'd been
there in a one-act play in high

school, and I said, 'I think I'd
like to go to your college be
cause it's the only one I know.' "
Hanks had heard of other

schools in the Bay Area. "I couldn't
get into Stanford," he says, grinning

impishly and waving me off. "I didn't
have the grades, man. Sacramento had

a big, active drama department and not a
lot of people in it, so you could do what you

wanted to do. So when I got into Sacra
mento I said, 'I'd like to run lights.' "

By the time he was 24, after working at
the Cleveland Repertory Theater — per

forming such works as "Juno and the Pea
cock," "King John" and "Two Gentlemen of
Verona" — Hanks landed a lead part in a sit

com called "Bosom Buddies." He moved to

Whether by luck or through a kind of kill
ful maneuvering that belies his guy-next- loor
persona, Hanks, after more than 10 years
hanging out in Tinseltown, still seems excited
about his work — a bellboy just glad to be
given the opportunity to put on a show.
"It's the same thing as it was in the begin
ning," he says. "Look, the lights and the pre
miers and the trophies and all that, that stuff's
really great. But it's the reason that you do it.
It's more fun than fun. These jobs where you
get to put on other people's clothes and pre
tend to be somebody is very glamorous; it was
glamorous when I was just trying to do it in
front ot 115 people in college—and you know
not everybody can do it."
As with other aspects of his personal life,
I lanks insists on a sense of clarity, a set of sim
ple rules, about what he believes later years
will bring. As usual, his plainspeaking style
when discussing his goals and ethos seems out
of place with his backslapping, cackling, wise
ass self. But you get the feeling that behind the
gags he's focused, looking beyond his next
joke or put-down, checking carefully to make
sure that he's traveling the course that he's
mapped out for himself.
"Longevity, that's the only yardstick for
success," he says."I said that on the press jun
ket for 'Splash.' Nothing else matters. It mat
ters to be able to work at a certain level and do
a certain kind of work continuously.
"The commercial aspects of it are always
going to come and go, but if what drives you to
make the choices in the first place are constant,
you can never really go wrong. You'll fail,
you'll succeed — probably in the same ratios
as you always have. But the desire is just to do
the same type of work." ■

It's easy to dislike Tom Hanks. He talks in a
loud voice, for one thing, and he cackles.
I le is also one of those people who can, by
dint of unlearned charm and confidence,
make a room of tired, overworked people
who spend entirely too much time with each
other laugh. And these are people who make
their living working right next to big-name
celebrities. Not like you and me, who feel
strange standing in the presence of a "movie
star."
He is also tall — about ft feet — which
makes him even less likable.
There's always little delays that manage to
halt an entire movie production — a light
needs to be adjusted, a prop's suddenly miss
ing, a mike decides to die, somebody's hair
doesn't look right. This is the time when
everyone stands around, waits and thinks
about how these delays add to a I a.m. wrap
time — and when you can hear I lanks cackle.
He likes to trade barbs with whomever s
available — director, co-star, production as
sistant — it doesn't matter to him. He likes a
struggle too — that way he can dance in cir
cles around you and rip you to little bits with
a series of well-aimed verbal thrusts, especial
ly if you're just an intern hoping to do an in
terview for"The Stanford Fishwrapper"
(Thanks, Tom — eds.).
It isn't surprising to hear that he considers
this sort of hangout time to be the most en
joyable part of filmmaking. It's as if he pos
sesses a store of irrepressible energy that has
to be released now and then before it con
sumes him. But it never gets the better of him,
at least while he's working. He doesn't fall into
a post-manic slump. And when he is quiet, he
enjoys his moments of private reflection.
In his "interview mode," he's serious, at
tentive. No facial gymnastics. But he talks at a
high clip and once you feed him a question, he
will not only answer it but will nimbly move
to your follow-up before you have a chance to
ask. He likes that kind of mental agility.
In his trailer — a silver pill-shaped
Airstreamer equipped with such important
amenities as TV, VCR and a phone — he
makes a latte (he's an inveterate coffee
drinker, as you might have guessed). It has
been a cold winter in Los Angeles, and the
heater in his trailer hums steadily. Sitting be
hind a minuscule wooden table, he snaps his
finger like he wants to rumble — "Ask your
questions, ask your questions, man, come on,
come on!"
W'rcsilitK) with fame
We've been working on "Apollo 13," Ron

Howard's latest directorial effort, which is
due for release this summer, for several
months now. I as the intern, he as the movie
star. As such, Hanks has run the inevitable
media gauntlet that accompanies fame and
seems to have emerged battered, but alive.
Last June's Vanity Fair, for instance, eagerly
probed the tales of his troubled, peripatetic
childhood, his current and prior marriage,
and other bits of coveted gossip that are the
stock and trade of celebrity profiles
"There's not training for being famous,"
he says, taking a swig from his latte. "It can
corrupt you, but only if you're corruptible.

The trade-off pretty much evens out, 1
think, as long as you maintain some
sort of even keel. It takes a while to get
used to, though
"For a while it's glamorous, and for
a while it's fun, and then for a while it's
horrible and it's a trap that you can
never escape. And then it becomes this
thing you crave and despise at the
same time."
I lanks, now 38, has several children
the oldest a teenager, the youngest, a
toddler — so he lives apart from the
1 .A. glamour-boy lifestyle. No trashing
pricey 1..A. hotel rooms. No squabbles
with the law over carrying concealed
handguns. Passing a quiet weekend at
the beach with his wife and kids, maybe
seeing a few close friends, is pleasure
enough. But he realizes that the burden
of stardom presses on all of them.

"The stuff that I get for free — you
wouldn't believe it,"he says, as though it were
still new to him, even though it's been more
than a decade since his first big film, "Splash."
"The free pass, the cuts in line, it's quite
unbelievable — so much that you gotta pro
tect your family. Otherwise life becomes too
easy. But how do you tell somebody, 'Hey,
your life isn't going to be as it is when you're
with me. You're not always going to get cuts in
Disneyland.' "
Setting concrete boundaries seems to help.
For instance, he vows

that no one from
the media will
ever, ever be al
lowed to set foot
in his house. Of
those bits of life
that remain pri
vate, he is fiercely
protective.

"You have to compartmentalize your life,"
he says."I don't want to have to constantly
sneak out of places. I do that, but not all the
time. Then it takes you over, and you can't let
it take you over. You learn when you can be
private and then you protect it. But when
you've given something up as public, there's
no making it private."
Hanks thinks he's had it relatively easy,
however. "I've been lucky," he says. "Because I
had a tiny amount of celebrity that slowly
grew. It's got to be horrifying to somebody to
whom it happens like that — pow. That's
where you see people flip out."

WrestliiKj with fame
I lanks describes his younger days in a
similar tone of modesty. He was energetic,
but hardly the angry and alienated lames-
Dean type.
"I wasn't the anarchist," he says."I was the
gang leader, the guy who'd try to convince
everyone to put their shirts on backwards or
something like that. Helped form a kazoo
band. The high school teachers liked me —
that was the difference.
"i *: •*.. i .M..

'I didn t question authority. 1 was actually
energetic, enthusiastic pretty much about
anything, except chemistry or something like
that."
Hanks tinkered with a few plays in high
school, but even after entering college he
didn't rush right into drama.
"I sort of hated the other people in drama
in college because 1 thought they were pointy
assed people, that were breaking into musical

numbers with high-button shoes," he says.
"I took drama classes because they were
lun and were great places to expend ener
gy. But 1 thought in college you had to be
collegiate somehow and study sociology
or zoology or biology."

Working as a bellboy at an Oakland
hotel while attending Chabot Commu
nity College in Hayward, Hanks didn't
have much time to audition for plays,
which limited his participation in the

drama department.
"My boss — Lou Rice was

his name, he's dead now — he
said, 'Why are you going to

school?' and I said, '1 don't
know.' He said, 'Well, what
are you studying?' aiul 1 said,
I think I'm studying theater
— I think.' He said, 'Are you
in plays and stuff?' And I

said, 'No, because I gotta work on the week
ends.' "
His boss changed his hours. Hanks ther
auditioned for the part of George Gibbs ii
"Our Town," and got the part. In addition t<
this career milestone, certain drama classes a
Chabot College helped pull him into theater.
"I took this class, called 'Drama in Perfor
mance.' "
For that class, 1 lanks read and viewed loca
productions of five major plays: "The Hot 1
Baltimore," "Desire Under the Elms," "Tin\
Alice," "The Good Woman of Szechuan" anc
"The Iceman Cometh."

Hanks had finally been drawn in. "['Apol
lo 13' co-supporting cast member Joe
Spano's] the reason I became an actor," lie
says. "His performance as Rocky the bar
tender (in"The Iceman Cometh") made what
I thought was almost an impossible thing

come to life for over the course of four hours,
and that altered me forever."
The thematic analysis that Hanks learned
in school still remains. "Everything has a the
matic thrust, and it's whether or not the
theme can withstand the scrutiny of the pro
duction," he says. "1 remember seeing 'The
1 lot I. Baltimore' and I asked the director after
the production, 'What is it you're trying to say
with this? and he just said, 'Well, that the
world is screwed up.' I remember thinking,

the world is screwed up — that's it?
End of discussion?"

After spending a year at
Chabot, Hanks decided to
transfer to a larger university.

"I went to the Cal State-Sacra
mento desk because I'd been
there in a one-act play in high

school, and I said, 'I think I'd
like to go to your college be
cause it's the only one I know.' "
Hanks had heard of other

schools in the Bay Area. "I couldn't
get into Stanford," he says, grinning

impishly and waving me off. "I didn't
have the grades, man. Sacramento had

a big, active drama department and not a
lot of people in it, so you could do what you

wanted to do. So when I got into Sacra
mento I said, 'I'd like to run lights.' "

By the time he was 24, after working at
the Cleveland Repertory Theater — per

forming such works as "Juno and the Pea
cock," "King John" and "Two Gentlemen of
Verona" — Hanks landed a lead part in a sit

com called "Bosom Buddies." He moved to
Los Angeles, joining all the other struggling
actors of the world, taped an episode of "The
Love Boat," and moved on to what would be
come a hit show.
"I got the job tor 'Bosom Buddies' proba
bly because I was so pumped up on nervous
adrenaline during the auditions," he says.
"And 1 had high energy comic pieces that I
was doing. I had more energy than possibly
the room could stand because 1 was so
scared."
Working in television brought a new set of
challenges. "TV was hard," he says."I was op-

erating on lOC
percent adrena
line and enthusi
asm, doing any
thing I was told.
The first season,
all I did was yell.
It was hard not to
literally scream
every line. Look
at the early
episodes of
Bosom Buddies.'
I yell every line
because I didn't
know how it
worked."
By the
time the show
had run dry,
Hanks felt ready

to move on. He'd
picked up some important lessons on how to
act for the camera and he'd made good
money, hut now he was trying to break into
the movies, running from audition to audi
tion. Having been turned down already from
"a million" theater companies, Broad-

way plays and off-Broadway plays,
rejections didn't faze him.
"I didn't want to be an out
of-work actor in LA.," he says,
talking about what was a most un-

pleasant life back then, when he
was trying to support a house and

two kids. "That's rough, man. I'm
from the Bay Area and I hated L.A.
anyway."
Eventually, he

made himself known to
the right people.

I was reading for
the movies every

chance I got,"

he says.
"There were
a couple

movies I
was up
i for and
they
broke my
heart be
cause I
didn't get
them. And
then
'Splash'
ca m e
along. In
the casting
circles,
once you
begin to

o - * *
get up and

get close on some movies, well,
then you're a guy whose getting
close on movies, and you can
play that potential off on other
people."

i r —
But "Splash" did come
along — if only be-

cause the studio

couldn't find any
one else to take the
part — and it es
tablished him as
an actor. But he
..... *:n

was still young, and con
scious of his deficiencies.
"You learn the difference
between playing for the back
row in a 1500-seat house and

playing for the video tape
player which is right in front of
you," he says."It took a long
time for me to figure that out. So

much of your twenties is just
putting your head down and try
ing to establish not just a toehold,
but a beach head.
"When I was 25 I knew that I

didn't know a lot. I've never been
one to say, 'I know how to do this.'
I've always been of the school:
'Gee, 1 hope they don't catch me
not knowing how to do this, be
cause then I'll be in big trouble.' j
I knew then that I'd probably
have to get my ass kicked a lot be
fore I'd be able to figure things
out. That's still the case." *

Walkinc) a Minefield
Hanks doesn't get sensitive when asked
about some of the dogs in his career. He men
tions "The Man with One Red Shoe." To him
failures are an inevitable part of the process.
"You only really learn by failure," he says.
"If you do it right, how do you really know
what you did? You're always walking on a
minefield."
By the time he's committed to performing
a scene in a certain way, it's difficult to predict
whether his performance will hold true in the
final cut of the movie. Even after 20 or so
films.
"If I really try and think about it, and try to
dig it up, I could probably find the root of it,"
he says."I could do the same thing with 'For
rest Gump.' I could do the same thing with
'Bonfire of the Vanities.' I could tell you why I
made every one of those choices, probably —
hut you don't know if it's going to work or
not. You have no idea. Something else defines
that. It has to come off in a mix."
"With films you never have the moment
where it's all yours. The director adds music,
he takes it away. He plays it in a close up, he
cuts away from you. You're always involved in
the ensemble, the cumulative effort that you
have no control over whatsoever. In that mix
anything can happen.
Anointed with lavish studio attention, ex
travagant budgets and A list stars, some films
go on to die horrific deaths, while other stroll
off with swarms of ticket buyers and adoring
critics. No one can figure out how this occurs.
So for Hanks, getting it right is often a matter
of faith — especially since there's no back
tracking when the shot's done. No one relies
on reshoots to make the performance work.
"You can't change it — it only is what it is,"
he says, with only a little exaggeration. "The

stuff you thought was great, stinks; the stuff
you thought stinks, is great. It's a horrible,
horrible position to be in. It's always like
that. The movie is a comprehensive whole,
and when it works you bow down to the

'"VII II "VI IVO JV/Cl l/WV* IiVSYVU Hi lilt
great god Pelicula and pay homage
and thanks.
"Bob Zemeckis (director of

"Forest Gump") says movies
are binary — they're either
zero or one. There's nothing
in between. I agree. It either
works, or it doesn't work. And

it it doesn't work, there's no
way you can explain what you
did wrong. And if it does
work, there's no idea you can
recreate it on the next one."

answers. I he uncertainty inherent in ar
guing for a particular vision and mak
ing it come to life is what excites
Hanks. But much of the day-to-day
routine can be tedious. The 14-hour

days, the stifling existence of spending
weeks in a trailer and standing around

sets in the middle of nowhere — but
having always to be ready to perform —

make it less than simple.
When describing acting, he borrows an
analogy gained from a recent evening watch
ing Ken Burns' baseball documentary.
"You're standing in left field and the guy's
throwing a pitch, and you have to be ready to
go in any of 360 decrees in order to make a

111 UIIY vi ./VV V.VD 111 VIUV.I IV 111 cl rvv. a
play, and that requires equipoise — it requires
concentration and relaxation," he says. "That's
what acting is. In the course of making a
movie, you have to have equipoise, you have to
be ready for the knock on the door that says,
'Come on, do the thing.' And then you get up
and do it."
lust keeping up with the constant script
changes and meetings with the director helps
impose an organic wholeness to Hanks' role,
even when the film is shot out of sequence. He
guesses that he will have read a script about 50
times before he even faces a camera.
"You find that when you've read it as many
times as you have, that it all makes sense to you
somehow," he says. "It's not that often that it's
all just lines and words. It's a whole idea that
you've already worked out in your head."
And again, there must he that thematic un
derpinning to support the story. The scripts
that flood Hanks' office .it 20th Century Fox
— named Clavius Base after Kubrick's "2001"
(Hanks' is a sci-fi fan) — are far afield from the
works of O'Neil and Brecht that he once read
as an undergraduate at Chabot. But the same
questions still apply.
"You've gotta have a theme," he says. "It's
got to be about something — it might be one
of the seven stories about the human condi
tion, whatever those are. ... It can't just be a
performance piece; it can't just be a one-man
show.
"I don't know how many movies I've done,
20 or something. But I hope that each one has
revolved around some sort of thematic ele
ment. As I've had a chance to do broader stuff,
its been better, but I hope that everything has
been about some aspect of the human condi
tion."

In Hollywood, everyone talks about the
here-today, gone-tomorrow careers, the one
hit wonders, the kind of stories that make Hol
lywood a place of evanescent dreams. But per
haps just as numerous are those who manage
to survive and continue to work, only to be
worn down into a state of jaded complacency
and cynicism.
Whether by luck or through a kind of kill

"I took this class, called 'Drama in Perfor
mance.' "
For that class, 1 lanks read and viewed loca
productions of five major plays: "The Hot 1
Baltimore," "Desire Under the Elms," "Tin\
Alice," "The Good Woman of Szechuan" anc
"The Iceman Cometh."

Hanks had finally been drawn in. "['Apol
lo 13' co-supporting cast member Joe
Spano's] the reason I became an actor," lie
says. "His performance as Rocky the bar
tender (in"The Iceman Cometh") made what
I thought was almost an impossible thing

come to life for over the course of four hours,
and that altered me forever."
The thematic analysis that Hanks learned
in school still remains. "Everything has a the
matic thrust, and it's whether or not the
theme can withstand the scrutiny of the pro
duction," he says. "1 remember seeing 'The
1 lot I. Baltimore' and I asked the director after
the production, 'What is it you're trying to say
with this? and he just said, 'Well, that the
world is screwed up.' I remember thinking,

the world is screwed up — that's it?
End of discussion?"

After spending a year at
Chabot, Hanks decided to
transfer to a larger university.

"I went to the Cal State-Sacra
mento desk because I'd been
there in a one-act play in high

school, and I said, 'I think I'd
like to go to your college be
cause it's the only one I know.' "
Hanks had heard of other

schools in the Bay Area. "I couldn't
get into Stanford," he says, grinning

impishly and waving me off. "I didn't
have the grades, man. Sacramento had

a big, active drama department and not a
lot of people in it, so you could do what you

wanted to do. So when I got into Sacra
mento I said, 'I'd like to run lights.' "

By the time he was 24, after working at
the Cleveland Repertory Theater — per

forming such works as "Juno and the Pea
cock," "King John" and "Two Gentlemen of
Verona" — Hanks landed a lead part in a sit

com called "Bosom Buddies." He moved to
Los Angeles, joining all the other struggling
actors of the world, taped an episode of "The
Love Boat," and moved on to what would be
come a hit show.
"I got the job tor 'Bosom Buddies' proba
bly because I was so pumped up on nervous
adrenaline during the auditions," he says.
"And 1 had high energy comic pieces that I
was doing. I had more energy than possibly
the room could stand because 1 was so
scared."
Working in television brought a new set of
challenges. "TV was hard," he says."I was op-

erating on lOC
percent adrena
line and enthusi
asm, doing any
thing I was told.
The first season,
all I did was yell.
It was hard not to
literally scream
every line. Look
at the early
episodes of
Bosom Buddies.'
I yell every line
because I didn't
know how it
worked."
By the
time the show
had run dry,
Hanks felt ready

to move on. He'd
picked up some important lessons on how to
act for the camera and he'd made good
money, hut now he was trying to break into
the movies, running from audition to audi
tion. Having been turned down already from
"a million" theater companies, Broad-

way plays and off-Broadway plays,
rejections didn't faze him.
"I didn't want to be an out
of-work actor in LA.," he says,
talking about what was a most un-

pleasant life back then, when he
was trying to support a house and

two kids. "That's rough, man. I'm
from the Bay Area and I hated L.A.
anyway."
Eventually, he

made himself known to
the right people.

I was reading for
the movies every

chance I got,"

he says.
"There were
a couple

movies I
was up
i for and
they
broke my
heart be
cause I
didn't get
them. And
then
'Splash'
ca m e
along. In
the casting
circles,
once you
begin to

o - * *
get up and

get close on some movies, well,
then you're a guy whose getting
close on movies, and you can
play that potential off on other
people."

i r —
But "Splash" did come
along — if only be-

cause the studio

couldn't find any
one else to take the
part — and it es
tablished him as
an actor. But he
..... *:n

was still young, and con
scious of his deficiencies.
"You learn the difference
between playing for the back
row in a 1500-seat house and

playing for the video tape
player which is right in front of
you," he says."It took a long
time for me to figure that out. So

much of your twenties is just
putting your head down and try
ing to establish not just a toehold,
but a beach head.
"When I was 25 I knew that I

didn't know a lot. I've never been
one to say, 'I know how to do this.'
I've always been of the school:
'Gee, 1 hope they don't catch me
not knowing how to do this, be
cause then I'll be in big trouble.' j
I knew then that I'd probably
have to get my ass kicked a lot be
fore I'd be able to figure things
out. That's still the case." *

Walkinc) a Minefield
Hanks doesn't get sensitive when asked
about some of the dogs in his career. He men
tions "The Man with One Red Shoe." To him
failures are an inevitable part of the process.
"You only really learn by failure," he says.
"If you do it right, how do you really know
what you did? You're always walking on a
minefield."
By the time he's committed to performing
a scene in a certain way, it's difficult to predict
whether his performance will hold true in the
final cut of the movie. Even after 20 or so
films.
"If I really try and think about it, and try to
dig it up, I could probably find the root of it,"
he says."I could do the same thing with 'For
rest Gump.' I could do the same thing with
'Bonfire of the Vanities.' I could tell you why I
made every one of those choices, probably —
hut you don't know if it's going to work or
not. You have no idea. Something else defines
that. It has to come off in a mix."
"With films you never have the moment
where it's all yours. The director adds music,
he takes it away. He plays it in a close up, he
cuts away from you. You're always involved in
the ensemble, the cumulative effort that you
have no control over whatsoever. In that mix
anything can happen.
Anointed with lavish studio attention, ex
travagant budgets and A list stars, some films
go on to die horrific deaths, while other stroll
off with swarms of ticket buyers and adoring
critics. No one can figure out how this occurs.
So for Hanks, getting it right is often a matter
of faith — especially since there's no back
tracking when the shot's done. No one relies
on reshoots to make the performance work.
"You can't change it — it only is what it is,"
he says, with only a little exaggeration. "The

stuff you thought was great, stinks; the stuff
you thought stinks, is great. It's a horrible,
horrible position to be in. It's always like
that. The movie is a comprehensive whole,
and when it works you bow down to the

did wrong. And if it does

answers. I he uncertainty inherent in ar

days, the stifling existence of spending
weeks in a trailer and standing around

sets in the middle of nowhere — but
having always to be ready to perform —

make it less than simple.
When describing acting, he borrows an
analogy gained from a recent evening watch
ing Ken Burns' baseball documentary.
"You're standing in left field and the guy's
throwing a pitch, and you have to be ready to
go in any of 360 decrees in order to make a

111 UIIY vi ./VV V.VD 111 VIUV.I IV 111 cl rvv. a
play, and that requires equipoise — it requires
concentration and relaxation," he says. "That's
what acting is. In the course of making a
movie, you have to have equipoise, you have to
be ready for the knock on the door that says,
'Come on, do the thing.' And then you get up
and do it."
lust keeping up with the constant script
changes and meetings with the director helps
impose an organic wholeness to Hanks' role,
even when the film is shot out of sequence. He
guesses that he will have read a script about 50
times before he even faces a camera.
"You find that when you've read it as many
times as you have, that it all makes sense to you
somehow," he says. "It's not that often that it's
all just lines and words. It's a whole idea that
you've already worked out in your head."
And again, there must he that thematic un
derpinning to support the story. The scripts
that flood Hanks' office .it 20th Century Fox
— named Clavius Base after Kubrick's "2001"
(Hanks' is a sci-fi fan) — are far afield from the
works of O'Neil and Brecht that he once read
as an undergraduate at Chabot. But the same
questions still apply.
"You've gotta have a theme," he says. "It's
got to be about something — it might be one
of the seven stories about the human condi
tion, whatever those are. ... It can't just be a
performance piece; it can't just be a one-man
show.
"I don't know how many movies I've done,
20 or something. But I hope that each one has
revolved around some sort of thematic ele
ment. As I've had a chance to do broader stuff,
its been better, but I hope that everything has
been about some aspect of the human condi
tion."
"IlieOiilij Y(ir( ism kJ( >rSi«(< *.ss'

In Hollywood, everyone talks about the
here-today, gone-tomorrow careers, the one
hit wonders, the kind of stories that make Hol
lywood a place of evanescent dreams. But per
haps just as numerous are those who manage
to survive and continue to work, only to be
worn down into a state of jaded complacency
and cynicism.
Whether by luck or through a kind of kill
ful maneuvering that belies his guy-next- loor
persona, Hanks, after more than 10 years
hanging out in Tinseltown, still seems excited
about his work — a bellboy just glad to be
given the opportunity to put on a show.
"It's the same thing as it was in the begin
ning," he says. "Look, the lights and the pre
miers and the trophies and all that, that stuff's
really great. But it's the reason that you do it.
It's more fun than fun. These jobs where you
get to put on other people's clothes and pre
tend to be somebody is very glamorous; it was
glamorous when I was just trying to do it in
front ot 115 people in college—and you know
not everybody can do it."
As with other aspects of his personal life,
I lanks insists on a sense of clarity, a set of sim
ple rules, about what he believes later years
will bring. As usual, his plainspeaking style
when discussing his goals and ethos seems out
of place with his backslapping, cackling, wise
ass self. But you get the feeling that behind the
gags he's focused, looking beyond his next
joke or put-down, checking carefully to make
sure that he's traveling the course that he's
mapped out for himself.
"Longevity, that's the only yardstick for
success," he says."I said that on the press jun
ket for 'Splash.' Nothing else matters. It mat
ters to be able to work at a certain level and do
a certain kind of work continuously.
"The commercial aspects of it are always
going to come and go, but if what drives you to
make the choices in the first place are constant,
you can never really go wrong. You'll fail,
you'll succeed — probably in the same ratios
as you always have. But the desire is just to do
the same type of work." ■

Ed Yoon, a recent Stanford graduate, worked as
a production intern for Hank's latest project,
Ron Howard's "Apollo 13."

It's easy to dislike Tom Hanks. He talks in a
loud voice, for one thing, and he cackles.
I le is also one of those people who can, by
dint of unlearned charm and confidence,
make a room of tired, overworked people
who spend entirely too much time with each
other laugh. And these are people who make
their living working right next to big-name
celebrities. Not like you and me, who feel
strange standing in the presence of a "movie
star."
He is also tall — about ft feet — which
makes him even less likable.
There's always little delays that manage to
halt an entire movie production — a light
needs to be adjusted, a prop's suddenly miss
ing, a mike decides to die, somebody's hair
doesn't look right. This is the time when
everyone stands around, waits and thinks
about how these delays add to a I a.m. wrap
time — and when you can hear I lanks cackle.
He likes to trade barbs with whomever s
available — director, co-star, production as
sistant — it doesn't matter to him. He likes a
struggle too — that way he can dance in cir
cles around you and rip you to little bits with
a series of well-aimed verbal thrusts, especial
ly if you're just an intern hoping to do an in
terview for"The Stanford Fishwrapper"
(Thanks, Tom — eds.).
It isn't surprising to hear that he considers
this sort of hangout time to be the most en
joyable part of filmmaking. It's as if he pos
sesses a store of irrepressible energy that has
to be released now and then before it con
sumes him. But it never gets the better of him,
at least while he's working. He doesn't fall into
a post-manic slump. And when he is quiet, he
enjoys his moments of private reflection.
In his "interview mode," he's serious, at
tentive. No facial gymnastics. But he talks at a
high clip and once you feed him a question, he
will not only answer it but will nimbly move
to your follow-up before you have a chance to
ask. He likes that kind of mental agility.
In his trailer — a silver pill-shaped
Airstreamer equipped with such important
amenities as TV, VCR and a phone — he
makes a latte (he's an inveterate coffee
drinker, as you might have guessed). It has
been a cold winter in Los Angeles, and the
heater in his trailer hums steadily. Sitting be
hind a minuscule wooden table, he snaps his
finger like he wants to rumble — "Ask your
questions, ask your questions, man, come on,
come on!"
W'rcsilitK) with fame
We've been working on "Apollo 13," Ron

Howard's latest directorial effort, which is
due for release this summer, for several
months now. I as the intern, he as the movie
star. As such, Hanks has run the inevitable
media gauntlet that accompanies fame and
seems to have emerged battered, but alive.
Last June's Vanity Fair, for instance, eagerly
probed the tales of his troubled, peripatetic
childhood, his current and prior marriage,
and other bits of coveted gossip that are the
stock and trade of celebrity profiles
"There's not training for being famous,"
he says, taking a swig from his latte. "It can
corrupt you, but only if you're corruptible.

The trade-off pretty much evens out, 1
think, as long as you maintain some
sort of even keel. It takes a while to get
used to, though
"For a while it's glamorous, and for
a while it's fun, and then for a while it's
horrible and it's a trap that you can
never escape. And then it becomes this
thing you crave and despise at the
same time."
I lanks, now 38, has several children
the oldest a teenager, the youngest, a
toddler — so he lives apart from the
1 .A. glamour-boy lifestyle. No trashing
pricey 1..A. hotel rooms. No squabbles
with the law over carrying concealed
handguns. Passing a quiet weekend at
the beach with his wife and kids, maybe
seeing a few close friends, is pleasure
enough. But he realizes that the burden
of stardom presses on all of them.

"The stuff that I get for free — you
wouldn't believe it,"he says, as though it were
still new to him, even though it's been more
than a decade since his first big film, "Splash."
"The free pass, the cuts in line, it's quite
unbelievable — so much that you gotta pro
tect your family. Otherwise life becomes too
easy. But how do you tell somebody, 'Hey,
your life isn't going to be as it is when you're
with me. You're not always going to get cuts in
Disneyland.' "
Setting concrete boundaries seems to help.
For instance, he vows

that no one from
the media will
ever, ever be al
lowed to set foot
in his house. Of
those bits of life
that remain pri
vate, he is fiercely
protective.

"You have to compartmentalize your life,"
he says."I don't want to have to constantly
sneak out of places. I do that, but not all the
time. Then it takes you over, and you can't let
it take you over. You learn when you can be
private and then you protect it. But when
you've given something up as public, there's
no making it private."
Hanks thinks he's had it relatively easy,
however. "I've been lucky," he says. "Because I
had a tiny amount of celebrity that slowly
grew. It's got to be horrifying to somebody to
whom it happens like that — pow. That's
where you see people flip out."

WrestliiKj with fame
I lanks describes his younger days in a
similar tone of modesty. He was energetic,
but hardly the angry and alienated lames-
Dean type.
"I wasn't the anarchist," he says."I was the
gang leader, the guy who'd try to convince
everyone to put their shirts on backwards or
something like that. Helped form a kazoo
band. The high school teachers liked me —
that was the difference.
"i *: •*.. i .M..

'I didn t question authority. 1 was actually
energetic, enthusiastic pretty much about
anything, except chemistry or something like
that."
Hanks tinkered with a few plays in high
school, but even after entering college he
didn't rush right into drama.
"I sort of hated the other people in drama
in college because 1 thought they were pointy
assed people, that were breaking into musical

numbers with high-button shoes," he says.
"I took drama classes because they were
lun and were great places to expend ener
gy. But 1 thought in college you had to be
collegiate somehow and study sociology
or zoology or biology."

Working as a bellboy at an Oakland
hotel while attending Chabot Commu
nity College in Hayward, Hanks didn't
have much time to audition for plays,
which limited his participation in the

drama department.
"My boss — Lou Rice was

his name, he's dead now — he
said, 'Why are you going to

school?' and I said, '1 don't
know.' He said, 'Well, what
are you studying?' aiul 1 said,
I think I'm studying theater
— I think.' He said, 'Are you
in plays and stuff?' And I

said, 'No, because I gotta work on the week
ends.' "
His boss changed his hours. Hanks ther
auditioned for the part of George Gibbs ii
"Our Town," and got the part. In addition t<
this career milestone, certain drama classes a
Chabot College helped pull him into theater.
"I took this class, called 'Drama in Perfor
mance.' "
For that class, 1 lanks read and viewed loca
productions of five major plays: "The Hot 1
Baltimore," "Desire Under the Elms," "Tin\
Alice," "The Good Woman of Szechuan" anc
"The Iceman Cometh."

Hanks had finally been drawn in. "['Apol
lo 13' co-supporting cast member Joe
Spano's] the reason I became an actor," lie
says. "His performance as Rocky the bar
tender (in"The Iceman Cometh") made what
I thought was almost an impossible thing

and that altered me forever."
The thematic analysis that Hanks learned
in school still remains. "Everything has a the
matic thrust, and it's whether or not the
theme can withstand the scrutiny of the pro
duction," he says. "1 remember seeing 'The
1 lot I. Baltimore' and I asked the director after
the production, 'What is it you're trying to say
with this? and he just said, 'Well, that the
world is screwed up.' I remember thinking,

the world is screwed up — that's it?
End of discussion?"

Chabot, Hanks decided to
transfer to a larger university.

"I went to the Cal State-Sacra

'Come on, do the thing.' And then you get up
and do it."
lust keeping up with the constant script
changes and meetings with the director helps
impose an organic wholeness to Hanks' role,
even when the film is shot out of sequence. He
guesses that he will have read a script about 50
times before he even faces a camera.
"You find that when you've read it as many
times as you have, that it all makes sense to you
somehow," he says. "It's not that often that it's
all just lines and words. It's a whole idea that
you've already worked out in your head."
And again, there must he that thematic un
derpinning to support the story. The scripts
that flood Hanks' office .it 20th Century Fox
— named Clavius Base after Kubrick's "2001"
(Hanks' is a sci-fi fan) — are far afield from the
works of O'Neil and Brecht that he once read
as an undergraduate at Chabot. But the same
questions still apply.
"You've gotta have a theme," he says. "It's
got to be about something — it might be one
of the seven stories about the human condi
tion, whatever those are. ... It can't just be a
performance piece; it can't just be a one-man
show.
"I don't know how many movies I've done,
20 or something. But I hope that each one has
revolved around some sort of thematic ele
ment. As I've had a chance to do broader stuff,
its been better, but I hope that everything has
been about some aspect of the human condi
tion."

In Hollywood, everyone talks about the
here-today, gone-tomorrow careers, the one
hit wonders, the kind of stories that make Hol
lywood a place of evanescent dreams. But per
haps just as numerous are those who manage
to survive and continue to work, only to be
worn down into a state of jaded complacency
and cynicism.
Whether by luck or through a kind of kill
ful maneuvering that belies his guy-next- loor
persona, Hanks, after more than 10 years
hanging out in Tinseltown, still seems excited
about his work — a bellboy just glad to be
given the opportunity to put on a show.
"It's the same thing as it was in the begin
ning," he says. "Look, the lights and the pre
miers and the trophies and all that, that stuff's
really great. But it's the reason that you do it.
It's more fun than fun. These jobs where you
get to put on other people's clothes and pre
tend to be somebody is very glamorous; it was
glamorous when I was just trying to do it in
front ot 115 people in college—and you know
not everybody can do it."
As with other aspects of his personal life,
I lanks insists on a sense of clarity, a set of sim
ple rules, about what he believes later years
will bring. As usual, his plainspeaking style
when discussing his goals and ethos seems out
of place with his backslapping, cackling, wise
ass self. But you get the feeling that behind the
gags he's focused, looking beyond his next
joke or put-down, checking carefully to make
sure that he's traveling the course that he's
mapped out for himself.
"Longevity, that's the only yardstick for
success," he says."I said that on the press jun
ket for 'Splash.' Nothing else matters. It mat
ters to be able to work at a certain level and do
a certain kind of work continuously.
"The commercial aspects of it are always
going to come and go, but if what drives you to
make the choices in the first place are constant,
you can never really go wrong. You'll fail,
you'll succeed — probably in the same ratios
as you always have. But the desire is just to do
the same type of work." ■

a production intern for Hank's latest project,
Ron Howard's "Apollo 13."
