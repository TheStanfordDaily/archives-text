"The Fall and Decline of Heavenly"
Heavenly

derful snapshot of soured love and yearned
for independence. As the song progresses, so
Fletcher gathers the courage to get out of a
tired relationship, her voice as emphatic as it is
unsure. So she wimped out in the first verse,
but the second time she means it when she
says, "You have got to go." Altera skittish little
bridge, Fletcher takes up the chorus again, al
firming her fragile strength.
There's not one weak link in the I leavenly
chain, each ditty as furiously stately as the one
before it. On "Skipjack, Fletcher and Rogers
share the lead, one swirling around the other
like water down a drain; "Sperm Meets 1 gg, So

What?" marches fre
netically and earnestly
as the singers agonize
over the results of a

pregnancy test. I lerc again, Fletcher wears her
worries on her sleeve, from the stutter in the
chorus to the second thoughts echoed by
Rogers from behind.
With the plaintive "She and Me," Heavenly
whispers its way to the close, putting a gentle
punctuation to " The Decline and Fall. The
music goes minimal and Fletcher's voice
grows sad as she pines in admiration and ado
ration of far-flung infatuation. I ike the album
as a whole, the song stands out because it tes
tifies to the 1 icavenly talent of expressing the
most basic feelings and experiences in the
most clever of ways.
