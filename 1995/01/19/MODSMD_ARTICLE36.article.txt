# 'Vitalogy': a new direction
## 
### 
In "l ast I \it, the first track on "Vitalogy,"
I ddie Vedder sings, "Let the sunshine burn
awa\ my mask/ three days, maybe longer/
Shed my skin at last." It's a littmg opening to
Pearl lam's new album, as it marks a new be
ginning for the band one where the sun ac -
tually does shine every now and then.
Pearl Jam's debut "Ten" offered 11 of the

"Vitalogy"
Pearl Jam

greatest
songs to hit
the popular
music scene
in years. But
the general
mood of the

album was
extremely bleak, and it remained so from
start to finish, making for a static and some
times monotonous listen. Their tollow-up
"Vs." made the situation worse. Although
filled with decent songs, the album simply
treaded water in Pearl lam's familiar musi
cal swamp, offering little in the way of mu
sical surprise or emotional variation.
But with their third album, the band
seems ready to shed their straightforward
glumness in favor of a more diverse ap
proach. The songs on "Vitalogy" explore a
variety of moods, styles, structures and
themes, while still delivering the consistent
depth, power and emotion that marked their
previous releases.

*
Pearl Jam manages to create intense musi
cal situations without sulking in depression
and defeat. On songs like "Not l or You" and
"Corduroy, the band tempers its anger with
an almost upbeat persistence, not wallowing
in bitterness, but instead cutting right
through it. In this way, many of the album's k
most tortured moments are curiously uplift
ing.
"Tremor Christ" is powerfully ambigu
ous, as it portrays an eerie loneliness while at
the same time embracing independence. The j
chorus is wrenching but not at all overdone, I
as Vedder remains strongly focused, aggres- '
sive and strangely satisfied.
In addition to Pearl Jam's classic intensi
ty, "Vitalogy offers some refreshing doses
of playful nonsense and experimentation.
"Bugs" is accordion ditty of al
most Daniel Johnston-esque paranoia, and
"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me"
brings the album to a aimlessly staggering |
conclusion. But even the apparent point- !
lessness of these tracks helps to make the
album more intriguing and appealing.
"Vitalogy" is a major split from the
sounds of "Ten" or "Vs." It's Pearl Jam's
most invigorated release to date, offering
fresh, new emotions that haven't yet been
run through Eddie Vedder's emotional
shredder.
