# Obscurity, not quality, reigns on Woodstock CD

### 
A lot of people looked at this summer's
Woodstock reunion concert held in Saugerties,
N.Y., as a poor and commercialized attempt to
relive the sixties. But a lot of the people who went
to the concert say that they're just jealous.
Either way, in what may be the final commer
cial plug for the gathering which promised
"three more days of love and music," A&M
records released a two-CD album of live perfor
mances from Woodstock '94.
Only they forgot to include the good songs.
The album's producers chose to include one
song from each performer —ostensibly because
of space constraints. The product: a random as
sortment of music which jumps from Primus to
Aerosmith to Nine Inch Nails with a few gratu-

itous stage announcements in the interim.
And while the recordings were done much
more clearly and crisply than on an average
bootleg album, the producers failed utterly to
pick the bands' best performances.
For example, for Aerosmith they chose
"Draw The Line / F.1.N.E." This is a good song,
but not on par with "Cryin"' or "Amazing" —
songs which brought the crowd to its feet.

Similarly, Blind Melons "Soup" was included
rather than the vastly more popular "No Rain,"
and "Feelin Alright" by Joe Cocker made its way
instead of "A Little Help From My Friends" — a
song which brought tears to the eyes of many at
the concert itself.
Alongside these selections, the album does
include some strong performances by bands
such as Green Day— "When I Come Around"
and the Rollins Band — " Right Here Too Much"
— and, of course, Metallica whose "For Whom
the Bell Tolls" crackles with energy.
Even with the included cool graphic booklet,
with much of the concert's best music absent,
the album is hardly worth a second glance.
