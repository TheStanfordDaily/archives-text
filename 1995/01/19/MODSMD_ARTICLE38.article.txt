# Petty has little novel to offer

Even as he sings, "Its time to move on, time
to get going," it's apparent that Tom Petty is
happy exactly where he is. After nearly 20 years
of delightfully ragged rock, he's established
himself as a genuine superstar with a rich his
tory, a solid reputation and a loyal following.
With all this, it makes perfect sense that the

"Wildflowers"

straining desperation of "Refugee" and the
heart-felt longing of "The Waiting" are long
gone. Instead, Petty's latest album "Wildflow
ers" delivers over an hour of complacent and
unambitious pop — consistently decent, but
consistently lacking everything that has made
much of his previous work exceptional.
The album's 15 tracks are comfortable and
pleasant, but also rather tiresome, as it seems
that Petty has done all of these songs before.
The story of "To 112 ind A Friend" could be the
Cliffs' Notes of the story of "Into the Great
Wide Open." Similarly, "You Wreck Me"
sounds like a tired re-hashing of "Runnin'
Down A Dream."
"Wildflowers" lacks originality, emotion
and energy. But Tom Petty is an undeniably
talented songwriter, easily mixing warmth,
honesty and humor in ways that somehow ap
peal even in their blandest moments.
So while trulv great songs are scarce on

"Wildflowers," there
really aren't any had
ones either. "Wild
flowers" sticks to
Petty's modest-but
reliahle pop formula,
which is sure to satisfy
fans looking for sim
ple, soft-rock
melodies, but also
likely to disappoint
fans hoping for more.
