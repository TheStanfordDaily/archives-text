# "Endless Summer" Donna Summer
## 
### 
"Endless Summer" is Donna Summer's aptly
titled new compilation of old songs. It really
does seem to go on forever, and its interest is
exclusive to die-hard Summer fans.
But die-hard Summer fans probably al
ready have one of the two previous greatest
hits collections that Summer put out earlier
in her career. That leaves only the curious to
buy her newest, who are likely to be disap
pointed.
Although some of Summer's music de
served to top the hit parade in the late '70s,
there is no explanation for the success of oth
ers. Songs like "Hot Stuff" and"The Wan
derer," just to mention two, lack the sense of
fun and youthful vitality that makes disco
music such a pleasure to listen to.
In other tracks, Summer induces Saturday
night fever with some of the best sounds of
the whole disco era. "Last Dance" and
"Mac Arthur Park" have become disco clas
sics, and understandably so. In songs like that
Summer demonstrates a mastering of the ba
sics of disco — simple, danceable tunes full
of build-up and climax. Unfortunately, those
are only two bright spots almost lost in an
ocean of dullness and repetition.
Summer's voice easily drowns in the sea of
instruments and synthesizers waging battle
in her songs. Not surprisingly, the only song
where we get a hint of her vocal capacity is
"Dim All the Lights," which she wrote by her
self. It's an honest and refreshing ballad,
quite a contrast to the bang-bang, louder
and-louder rhythm of the other songs.
Summer's music really has nothing to say.
There is no intricacy to the lyrics whatsoever.
I wasn't expecting Sondheim, but this is bad
even for disco standards. Clearly all that she
wants is to make her audience get up and
dance.
"Endless Summer" is party music, noth
ing more. Like caffeine that keeps you awake,
the album is a mental stimulant to get your
body moving to a beat. It works reasonably
well in the context of a night where all you
hear is "freak out," "do the hustle" and "shake
your booties." The album doesn't work so
well when it stands alone.

"NATO''
Laibach

With "NATO," Laibach has created the ultimate
war compilation album, featuring an eclectic mix
of existing war songs that have been fed through
their patented musical shredding machine. Those
unfamiliar with Laibach can learn to instantly rec
ognize the band by their dark, ominous textures
and deep sepulchral vocals. Laibach's music has
evolved into more of a techno genre, although
most of their songs sound like dance mixes of the
Red Army's battle hymns.
The album opens with the title track, a heavily
facelifted version of Gustav Hoist's "Mars." Above
the tweeting electronic blurps, Hitting hi-hats and
techno beat, the horn section blares the famous
theme of the warbringer.
The next song, and by far the most danceble, is
"Final Countdown." Seasoned music listeners will
easily recognize this as the 'KO's hit by Europe, but
may be shocked at the changes it underwent.
Laibach's version sounds like the Pet Shop Boys
and the Nazi Party got together in a Balkan castle

and threw everything they had into the pot, in
cluding a hall choir, a mad pipe organist and
Zangeif on lead vocals. The result is a highly
charged remake, both beautiful and hilarious.
Besides pumping each of the cuts through their
Slovenian sieve, Lai bach has also reinterpreted
some of the songs by changing their lyrics. For ex
ample, in the cover of Edwin Starrs "War,"
Laibach addresses the song's question, "What is
war good for?" Their answer: science, religion,
domination, communication and industry.
Laibach then goes on to list a host of companies
that it believes feed off war.
Similarly, Laibach turns "Indian Reservation"
into "National Reservation," altering the lyrics to
describe the Soviet Union's takeover of its satellite
nations. In the oldies hit "In the Year 2525" by
Zager and Hvans, Laibach cleverly changes the
lyrics to prophesize man's apocalyptic demise in
the years 1494-1999.
Part parody, part visionary, this album is a
wonderful glimpse at what Laibach can create with
existing music. Their manipulation can be seen as
both terrific and awful, but no one will argue that
it is indeed a spectacle to behold.
