# SHS works to make $25.3M budget cut
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Stanford Health Services em
barked last week on the sixth year
of its Operations Improvement
program, working to trim $25.3
million from its budget before
next year.
In addition to the cuts, the or
ganization also hopes to make $6
million in revenue enhancement,
for a total of $31.3 million in bud
get improvement.
Although SHS has made great
strides in increasing its cost effi
ciency, Vice President for Opera
tions Malinda Mitchell said that
opportunities for improvement
still exist.

"Considering the circumstance
of dramatic change in health care
in the United States in recent
years, I think we're doing very
well," Mitchell said, adding that
she credits many improvements
in cost efficiency to the Opera
tions Improvement program.
Formed last spring, SHS in
cludes the clinical operations of
Stanford Hospital, the School of
Medicine and closely affiliated
local physicians.
Mitchell said events of the past
year — including the failure of the
Clinton health plan and the possi
bility of reduced federal funds for
teaching activities at medical
ited to the Oklahoma grant level
of $341 instead of the California
grant level of $624 — even though
she had never been on welfare
before and had only lived in Okla
homa for six weeks.
"In Oklahoma, you can find an
apartment for $199 a month,
including utilities," Venturella
said in a statement. Her San
Francisco rent was $700, she said.
Green fled from Louisiana to
Sacramento, where she had previ
ously lived for 12 years, in order
to escape the father of her two
children who had been arrested
several times for beating her.
She applied for AFDC funds
and was limited to the Louisiana
grant level of $190 month, though
she needed over twice as much to
pay rent alone in California.
"It's a great constitutional
issue — the right to travel is one
of the fundamental principles of

the constitution," said Sullivan.
"The right to move and migrate,
like I did in coming to Stanford,
is what makes us a country."
Berthollt, in a similar situation
to Green, moved to California
from Colorado to escape an abu
sive husband. Under the AFDC
her benefits were limited to the
Colorado level of $280 a month
rather than the California benefit
0f5504.
"The law expressly discrimi
nates against people from other
states, and the state can't do that
for a lot of reasons," said Sarah
Kurtz, a lawyer who helped bring
the class-action lawsuit, in a
statement.
"Our argument is welfare
shouldn't be treated differently
from any other benefit," Sullivan
said. "For example, the state can't
tax new immigrants differently."
"This couldn't happen if it
weren't about welfare," Sullivan
added. "Our position is you can
reform welfare however you
want, just not on the backs of new
residents."

The state argues in its briefs,
however, that the law does not
eliminate benefits altogether, so
newcomers would not be any
worse off than if they hadn't
moved to California. The state is
just trying to cut welfare expendi
tures in light of California's bud
get problems, the brief says.
There is a precedent for the
case that was written by Justice
William Brennan in 1969 and
supports Sullivan's defense.
"We're just trying to keep this
precedent alive in a court which
looks very different today," Sulli
van said.
Three things could happen
with the case according to Sulli
van. "The court might get rid of
the case as moot because another
court already struck down a fed
eral waiver necessary for the law
to go into effect... we still win,"
she said.
On the other hand, "the court
could decide with us" or "they could
go against us, deciding that times
have changed," Sullivan added.
In preparing for this trial,

Sullivan was aided by a moot
court session held at the Law
School last Thursday, where five
Stanford professors played jus
tices and many students
watched. The professors asked
Sullivan difficult questions so
that the questions from the
Supreme Court would seem easy
in comparison.
"She handled everything with
remarkable poise," said Stanford
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther, one of
the mock justices.
"She was smashing as always,"
added another "justice," Law
Prof. William Cohen.
"Many of the questions asked
at the real court were asked by
the moot court," Sullivan noted.
"It's a very, very important
case," said Sullivan in a state
ment. "This case could have a
major impact on the state's wel
fare cutting plans and on the con
stitutional limitations on the wel
fare reform plans."
If the court decides to rule on
the case, a decision will not be
made until this summer.
