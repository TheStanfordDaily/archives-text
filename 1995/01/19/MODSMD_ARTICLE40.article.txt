# "Larry Shaw" Larry Shaw
## 
### 
With the best tracks on this self-ti
tled EP, Larry Shaw brings to mind
shades of Hob Dylan and Michael
Penn, with his quick-witted song
writing and modest musical experi
mentation setting him apart from the
folk-pop pack. But at the same time,
Shaw seems to rely a bit much on fa
miliar modern-day cowboy cliches,
too often cheapening his emotion
with tired country beats or trite,
melancholic metaphors.
"Is It the Wind?" and "Turn This
Train Around" use the same wind
and train imagery that countless mu
sicians have used before. Even as
Shaw attacks these country cliches in
"Nashville" ("The people sing five
songs/ Two about women and one
about drinking/ One about the good
lord, and one about your ma and
pa"), he seems reluctant to part with
them. But when he does go beyond
plodding country ballads, flashes of
brilliance result that are both catchy
and intelligent, aggressive yet sooth
ing.
The opening track "Shame and
Regret" is an energetic exploration of
a troubled relationship, with Shaw's
thoughtful, tongue-twisting lyrics
delivered at a comfortably quick
pace. Shaw spins a soft whirlwind of
sound that is thrilling but not over
whelming.
With its bouncing mix of guitar
and organ, "Gatherings" is similarly
enjoyable. Shaw somehow recalls the
grumbling of Warren Zevon, while at
the same time creating his own
unique brand of country-funk.
Judging from the EP's more adven
turesome moments, Shaw has every
thing it takes to make a great album.
More often than not, however, Shaw's
creative talent and energy are watered
down by predictable country conven
tions, too often making for a slow and
unbalanced listen.
