# "Ready to Wear" motion picture soundtrack
## 
### 
While neurological disorders themselves
arc not contagious, the schizophrenia of the
fashion industry captured in Robert Altman's
"Ready to Wear" ("Pret-a-Porter") infects the
movie soundtrack as well.
Altman's characteristic fast-paced move
ment from scene to scene (think "Shortcuts")
risks confusing the viewer, but just as this
structural feature reinforces the fast-paced
movement of fashion trends, the accompany
ing music achieves the same effect. In fact, this
soundtrack is even better than the movie from
which it derives.
Although the songs may seem as haphaz
ard, arbitrary and inexplicable as trends of

style, there is a certain rational grouping of the
songs. Nearly all have a strong beat and pos
sess the same momentum as a supermodel,
decked out in Chanel's latest tolly, strutting
down the runway.

Janet Jackson's "'7os Love

Groove" is the only exception

to the general inclination

towards high-energy

strutting music. Jack

o
son speaks directly to

the listener, seducing

with her sexy voice

alone as she puts a

record on the

turntable. But the tell

tale crackle of a vinyl LP

is the only thing re-

motely '"70s" about this

song — the rest is a mod

ern seduction scene, complete

with orgasmic sighs and moans,

that is almost embarrassing to listen to.
"Jump On Top of Me Baby," by the Rolling
Stones, recalls the passion and primitive desire
of Tim Robbins and Julia Roberts tangled in
the sheets, empty champagne bottle on

the nightstand. This song is exe

cuted in true Stones style with

a contemporary twist. Still

the classic electric guitar

solo and good drum

beat partially explains

this group's long-last

ing appeal. U2 per

forms a remix of

'"Lemon" which is

representative of some

of their better work.

However, like the

Stones, U2's style here is

slightly modern — it has a

synthesized and electronic

feel.

"Pretty," by the Cranberries, is a great song
in and of itself, but if one has memories of the
movie, the accompanying ethereal scene is
unforgettable. Images of nude supermodels
sauntering down the runway in slow motion
to the haunting music will run through the
mind.
Other runway songs are fairly generic, ex
cluding the Euro-pop "Martha," with all-
French lyrics. However, title aside, Terence
Trent D'Arby's "Supermodel Sandwich"
couldn't be more suited to the flick. Its ener
getic guitar playing and the words "fame fame
fame" in the chorus spiral downward as it car
ried away by fame itself.
It doesn't matter if you've seen "Ready to
Wear" — the CD itself stands alone. It's hard
to sit still while listening to this mix. Some
how, it grabs you by the hand, drags you to
your feet, and insists that you follow as it struts
around the room, hips asway.
