'Shame' funny, not believable
In "A Low Down Dirty Shame," Keenan Ivory Wayans
shows that he still has his comedic abilities from"In Living
Color," hut that he is not quite ready for action-hero status.
The movie stars former police officer Andre Shame
who, along with his assistant Peaches Jordan (Jada Pinkett
of "A I different World" fame) solves crimes as a private in
vestigator. The OA hires Shame to find Angela (Salli

Richardson) who will lead them to a drug kingpin. When
Shame realizes that he used to date the woman, Peaches
gets jealous and complications arise.
Pinkett shines in the movie, bringing a refreshing and
outrageous manner to Peaches. Peaches is a soap opera fa
natic and takes the actions of the characters to heart. When
Peaches actually meets an actor from her favorite soap
opera on the street, she knocks him out cold because she
did not like the way his character had been acting lately.
Other funny scenes revolve around Shame. Wayans
brings his sister into the movie when he calls a store pre
tending to award her the prize in a radio contest if she
comes down to the station right away. The salesclerk (Kim
Wayans) goes wild when she wins, throwing customers
out of the store and runs out herself, leaving it open for
Shame to set his trap.
In another scene, when Shame is attacked by dogs, he
follows the advice that Peaches relayed to him out of the
National Enquirer— singing James Brown songs would
pacify the canines.
Unfortunately, the film's act ion sequences arc not as en
tertaining as its comedic scenes. The fight sequences were
just not believable, especially one between Peaches and
Angela. Other examples occur when Shame is in a bar, and
uses a jukebox to smash his victims. Also, in the unbeliev
ably implausible final scene, Shame jumps out of harm's
way when an explosion occurs on the third story of a shop
ping mall. He flings himself off the railing, but is restrained

by a bungec cord, which allows him to come within a few
feet of the ground floor, grab a gun out of someone's
hands, and shoot through a crowd of people.
Although the action scenes flopped, the rest of the
movie was able to sustain interest, especially the scenes
with Jada Pinkett. Keenan Ivory Wayans succeeded with
the humor in "A Low Down Dirty Shame," but it's a shame
he didn't try harder to improve the action.
