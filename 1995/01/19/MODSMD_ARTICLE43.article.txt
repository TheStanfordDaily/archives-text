# To attack or to praise?
## 'Ready' showcases, instead of mocks, the fashion industry 
### 
Australian, British, American
and French "Vogue" have asserted
that it's more fabulous than a mo
hair bikini.
Oui, mon petit chou, the entire
fashion world has gone day-glo for
Robert Altman's latest flick, "Pret
a-Porter" (otherwise known as
"Ready-to-Wear," a dumbed-down
title given to U.S. audiences).
Strangely enough, this flick has
been applauded by the industry
that it tries so desperately to
ridicule. Do Christian, Issey, Sonia

screens

and Jean-Paul
have the pink
angora over
their eyes?
Non, mon
ami, the fash
ion world ain't
that oblivious.
"Pre t - a -
Porter" just
fails what it
had set out to
do — attack
the industry.
It'samaz-

ingthat Altman's highly-engineered
attack fails so miserably. He has the
well-rehearsed strategy: his own
signature cynicism that succeeded
in his attack against Hollywood in
"The Player." As always, he has the
glitzy firepower: Sofia Loren, Kim
Basinger, Tim Robbins, Julia

and even the ever -haute Elsa
Klench of CNN's "Style" aid Altman
in his attempt to villify fashion.
But his attempt is done in vain.
The film's plot is as thin as Linda
Evangelista's upper thigh. Actually,
it's so emaciated I doubt there even
is one. Throughout "Pr£t-d-
Porter," a mess of characters simply

wander in Paris during collection
season. Some characters loiter
around in designer frocks (Danny
Aiello looks particularly ravishing
in a pink Chanel™ suit and heels).
Others wear nothing at all (We see a
pregnant model wearing nothing
but a veil in a nude fashion show).
The characters are not orchestrated
to transmit the director's message.
Rather, they merely act as random
pawns in the fashion hoopla.
Robert Altman tries to inject
some cynicism into his film via use
of symbols. The first shot in the
movie is a closeup of a poster adver
tising "Poison." At the end of the
film, Altman smears the screen with
a closeup of a billboard that simply
states "get real."
He also uses a less blatant form of
symbolism. Altman invokes the fol
lowing equation:
[ encounters with shit = mockery ]
On numerous occasions, he has
various fashion bigwigs slip and
slide in the foul matter. Such use of
