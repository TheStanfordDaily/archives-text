## Unoriginal 'Nell' makes blatant Oscar bid 
### 
These days, two-time Acade
my Award winner Jodie Foster
has the clout in the industry to
jump-start any project she takes
a fancy to — even ones that have
little reason to be made. "Nell" is

holiday season.
Foster plays title character

who spends all her life in a rustic
cabin in the woods, but yet looks
flawlessly ethereal for the cam
era. And as if to substantiate
Nell's claim to the wise, wild
woman who gets to teach every
one around her a lesson or two,
the writers have devised a pri

prettily philosophical mum
blings and toss her head around
in sync with.
Actually, Foster's conception
of the character reeks more of
new-age flower child than the
tormented soul whose only
human contact has been with an
aphasic mother. No doubt the
Academy is bound to consider
Nell a "brave departure" from
anything the star has attempted
before and suitably bestow upon
her another nomination.
Another troubling aspect of
"Nell" is the predictable way it
treats the protagonist's sexuality
— the wanton innocence of a
