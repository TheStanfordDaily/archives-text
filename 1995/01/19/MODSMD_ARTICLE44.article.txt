## Unoriginal 'Nell' makes blatant Oscar bid 
### 
These days, two-time Acade
my Award winner Jodie Foster
has the clout in the industry to
jump-start any project she takes
a fancy to — even ones that have
little reason to be made. "Nell" is
the unfortunate evidence of
how power corrupts talent, and
one wonders if Foster's compa-

should be read as a misspelled
euphemism for Ego.
Believe it or not, the movie's
grand mission is to educate the
general public about how civi
lization begets evil and an icon
of unspoiled nature can touch
the lives of cynical professionals.
One should hesitate to label
"Nell" simplistic; at least not
when it is competing for a gen
eral public who made "Dumber
and Dumber" the smash of the
holiday season.
Foster plays title character

who spends all her life in a rustic
cabin in the woods, but yet looks
flawlessly ethereal for the cam
era. And as if to substantiate
Nell's claim to the wise, wild
woman who gets to teach every
one around her a lesson or two,
the writers have devised a pri
vate language for her to spout
prettily philosophical mum
blings and toss her head around
in sync with.
Actually, Foster's conception
of the character reeks more of
new-age flower child than the
tormented soul whose only
human contact has been with an
aphasic mother. No doubt the
Academy is bound to consider
Nell a "brave departure" from
anything the star has attempted
before and suitably bestow upon
her another nomination.
Another troubling aspect of
"Nell" is the predictable way it
treats the protagonist's sexuality
— the wanton innocence of a

girl's uninitiated adolescence, blended al
luringly with an exhibitionistic sense of her
adult woman's body.
Not only does such a premise set itself
up for the attempted rape by small-town
red-necks in the movie, it serves to raise
the heterosexual male pulse in the audi
ence whenever Nell goes skinny-dipping in
the lake.
Liam Neeson's Dr. Lovell character ar
rives at the scene as the Great White Hope

who saves Nell from the monstrous medical
fraternity and media hounds yapping at her
feet.
The movie's penultimate court-room
scene should he witnessed if only to be con
vinced of the juvenile level of discourse that
even a prestige Hollywood vehicle like this
one inevitably descends to.
Director Michael Apted, who happens
to craft brilliant political documentaries
like "Moving The Mountain," is certainly
capable of much better things. Regrettably,
it will be work like "Nell" that pays the
bills, and clinches the invitations to Oscar
night.
