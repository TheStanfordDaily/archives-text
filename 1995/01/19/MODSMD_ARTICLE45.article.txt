"Speechless"

When Kevin and Julia first meet, they are
in a store reaching for the same bottle of
Nytol. The opening scenes of Ron Under
wood's "Speechless" reveal these rival speech
writers (played by Michael Keaton and
Geena Davis) to be insomniacs who pop
M&Ms, eat carrots dipped in marshmallow
creme, toss a baseball in bed and pretend to
have talking toes in order to wile away those
sleepless night hours.
By the end of this unromantic comedy,
the audience may welcome similar activities
to relieve its own restlessness and boredom.
The plot revolves around Kevin and Julia's
violation of the time-honored political cam
paign maxim "Don't mix with the enemy."
Fortunately for the real presidential cam
paign workers James Carville and Mary
Matalin, this script was written two years be
fore their romance and should not be con
strued as a documentary. (If it were, the
movie would only harbinger doom for their

"Immortal Beloved"

Shortly after Ludwig van Beethoven's
death, a cryptic letter was found among his
possessions. Addressed to a woman —
known only as "Immortal Beloved" — the
letter became the impetus for one of history's
great romantic mysteries. Who, among the
many women Beethoven loved, was his one
true love?
Bernard Rose's "Immortal Beloved" pon
ders this question with its own fictitious sup
position of events. When Beethoven's secre
tary Anton (Jeroen Krabbe) tries to settle his
friend's affairs after his death, he discovers
the letter and Beethoven's last will and testa

love life.)
The tug-of-war sparked by the bottle of
Nytol continues throughout the movie, cre
ating quite a few laughs. But when the gears
shift to romance, the film is unsuccessful in
evoking any sighs. These quirky performers
do better on the hate side of their love-hate
relationship — bickering over broken-down
cars, sabotaging each other's candidate's
speeches, hurling curses about campaign
policy in front of school children, plagiariz
ing speech ideas and getting into a water
fights over political ideology.
When Keaton and Davis turn to love, they
spend most of their time calling each other
on the phone or stuttering marginally emo
tional confessions, as if they are reading a
bad romance script. The two are comic when
they should be romantic and romantic when
they should be comic.
The couple spews out far too many cliches
for the audience to actually believe they are
speech writers — people paid to be innovative
and create election-winning sound bites. Un
fortunately, their very lives turn into compila
tions of nausea-inducing sound bites from all
the bad romantic comedies on the market.

terious "Immortal Beloved." Determined to
honor Beethoven's final wishes, Anton trav
els far and wide, visiting Beethoven's many
love interests. The film's plot unravels as each
woman tells her tale, each revealing a new
side to the mercurial maestro.
Gary Oldman is the consummate Ludwig
van Beethoven with a wunderbar German ac
cent. In a greatcoat and top hat, which only
partially hides his wild mane of hair, he is at
once elegant and untamed. Oldman's
strength is his versatility as an actor. Equally
comfortable with the period piece ("Bram
Stoker's Dracula") and with the contempo
rary ("True Romance," "The Professional"),
he simultaneously evokes the historical and
the modern in his portrayal of Beethoven.
Oldman overshadows most of the cast of
"Immortal Beloved," which includes Johan
na Ter Steege, Valeria Golino and Isabella

"Little Women"

At first, and even second glance, waif-like
Winona Ryder seems an odd choice to play Jo
March, the robust, literary, tomboyish misfit
of Louisa May Alcott's "Little Women."
How can someone that cute feel like an
outcast?
It's a tribute to Ryder's ("Heathers," "Re
ality Bites") skill that she manages to pull
off the charade, making Jo into a kind of
feminist heroine and female artiste. That
performance and the sheer beauty of direc
tor Gillian Armstrong's film make
"Women" into a treat that elicits both tears
and smiles.
Set in Concord, Massachusetts (though
filmed in Vancouver, Canada), "Women"
shows the natural beauty of the changing sea
sons as well as the spiritual beauty which
emerges as women mature.
The performances of all the March
women are strong. Susan Sarandon, as the
superlative role model and mother, and
Rosselini. Rosselini plays Anna Marie, one of
Beethoven's lovers. Her beauty graces the
film, lending her own brand of elegance and
sophistication to the movie. However, in
general, she is more a part of the set and back
ground than a dramatic force. Her character
has a great deal of potential. Unfortunately,
Rosselini did not capitalize on it.
Oldman's bold performance is paralleled
only by the music. Unlike most films in

which the soundtrack is
used as a filler or back
ground, "Immortal
Beloved" brings
Beethoven's music to the
foreground. Director /
writer Rose explains in the
liner notes of the CD
soundtrack: "We made
'Immortal Beloved' be
cause of this music and for

Kirsten Dunst, as young, self-centered Amy,
deserve special notice for their on-the-mark
performances. However, while her acting was
superb, Clare Danes (of televisions "My So-
Called Life") appears a bit too physically
healthy to play sickly Beth.
What's missing from the film is the en
semble feeling. Alcott's "Little Women" was
not just Jo's story, but also that of Meg and
Beth and Amy, and even Marmeeand Laurie.
Armstrong and producer Denise I)i Novi
turn "Women" into "Woman" — a tale about
Jo's search for fulfillment as a writer.
And despite its two-hour length, events
move too fast. After two European encoun
ters, Amy and Laurie are married, apparent
ly without the romantic courtship described
by Alcott (I don't feel bad giving away the
plot when the film's based on a book every
one and her sister has read).
Still, for those who don't have time to im
merse themselves in the details of the several
hundred-page novel, Armstrong's "Little
Women" is an almost-satisfactory substitute.
And, after four cinematic versions of
"Women," maybe it's time for Hollywood to
turn to Alcott's "Little Men."
— Linda Friedlieb
no other reason. The film was written, shot
and edited to the score."
Foregoing much dialogue, the film cou

with Oldman's highly expressive acting for an
overwhelmingly powerful result. Atypical of
Hollywood films, "Immortal Beloved"
proves true the old theatrical adage: actions
speak louder than words.

off the charade, making Jo into a kind of
feminist heroine and female artiste. That
performance and the sheer beauty of direc
tor Gillian Armstrong's film make
"Women" into a treat that elicits both tears
and smiles.
Set in Concord, Massachusetts (though
filmed in Vancouver, Canada), "Women"
shows the natural beauty of the changing sea
sons as well as the spiritual beauty which
emerges as women mature.
The performances of all the March
women are strong. Susan Sarandon, as the
superlative role model and mother, and
Rosselini. Rosselini plays Anna Marie, one of
Beethoven's lovers. Her beauty graces the
film, lending her own brand of elegance and
sophistication to the movie. However, in
general, she is more a part of the set and back
ground than a dramatic force. Her character
has a great deal of potential. Unfortunately,
Rosselini did not capitalize on it.
Oldman's bold performance is paralleled
only by the music. Unlike most films in

which the soundtrack is
used as a filler or back
ground, "Immortal
Beloved" brings
Beethoven's music to the
foreground. Director /
writer Rose explains in the
liner notes of the CD
soundtrack: "We made

Kirsten Dunst, as young, self-centered Amy,

performances. However, while her acting was
superb, Clare Danes (of televisions "My So-
Called Life") appears a bit too physically
healthy to play sickly Beth.
What's missing from the film is the en
semble feeling. Alcott's "Little Women" was
not just Jo's story, but also that of Meg and
Beth and Amy, and even Marmeeand Laurie.
Armstrong and producer Denise I)i Novi
turn "Women" into "Woman" — a tale about
Jo's search for fulfillment as a writer.
And despite its two-hour length, events
move too fast. After two European encoun
ters, Amy and Laurie are married, apparent

by Alcott (I don't feel bad giving away the
plot when the film's based on a book every
one and her sister has read).
Still, for those who don't have time to im
merse themselves in the details of the several
hundred-page novel, Armstrong's "Little
Women" is an almost-satisfactory substitute.
And, after four cinematic versions of
"Women," maybe it's time for Hollywood to
turn to Alcott's "Little Men."

"Speechless"

When Kevin and Julia first meet, they are
in a store reaching for the same bottle of
Nytol. The opening scenes of Ron Under
wood's "Speechless" reveal these rival speech
writers (played by Michael Keaton and
Geena Davis) to be insomniacs who pop
M&Ms, eat carrots dipped in marshmallow
creme, toss a baseball in bed and pretend to
have talking toes in order to wile away those
sleepless night hours.
By the end of this unromantic comedy,
the audience may welcome similar activities
to relieve its own restlessness and boredom.
The plot revolves around Kevin and Julia's
violation of the time-honored political cam
paign maxim "Don't mix with the enemy."
Fortunately for the real presidential cam
paign workers James Carville and Mary
Matalin, this script was written two years be
fore their romance and should not be con
strued as a documentary. (If it were, the
movie would only harbinger doom for their

"Immortal Beloved"

Shortly after Ludwig van Beethoven's
death, a cryptic letter was found among his
possessions. Addressed to a woman —
known only as "Immortal Beloved" — the
letter became the impetus for one of history's
great romantic mysteries. Who, among the
many women Beethoven loved, was his one
true love?
Bernard Rose's "Immortal Beloved" pon
ders this question with its own fictitious sup
position of events. When Beethoven's secre
tary Anton (Jeroen Krabbe) tries to settle his
friend's affairs after his death, he discovers
the letter and Beethoven's last will and testa

love life.)
The tug-of-war sparked by the bottle of
Nytol continues throughout the movie, cre
ating quite a few laughs. But when the gears
shift to romance, the film is unsuccessful in
evoking any sighs. These quirky performers
do better on the hate side of their love-hate
relationship — bickering over broken-down
cars, sabotaging each other's candidate's
speeches, hurling curses about campaign
policy in front of school children, plagiariz
ing speech ideas and getting into a water
fights over political ideology.
When Keaton and Davis turn to love, they
spend most of their time calling each other
on the phone or stuttering marginally emo
tional confessions, as if they are reading a
bad romance script. The two are comic when
they should be romantic and romantic when
they should be comic.
The couple spews out far too many cliches
for the audience to actually believe they are
speech writers — people paid to be innovative
and create election-winning sound bites. Un
fortunately, their very lives turn into compila
tions of nausea-inducing sound bites from all
the bad romantic comedies on the market.

ment, leaving all his possessions to the mys
terious "Immortal Beloved." Determined to
honor Beethoven's final wishes, Anton trav
els far and wide, visiting Beethoven's many
love interests. The film's plot unravels as each
woman tells her tale, each revealing a new
side to the mercurial maestro.
Gary Oldman is the consummate Ludwig
van Beethoven with a wunderbar German ac
cent. In a greatcoat and top hat, which only
partially hides his wild mane of hair, he is at
once elegant and untamed. Oldman's
strength is his versatility as an actor. Equally
comfortable with the period piece ("Bram
Stoker's Dracula") and with the contempo
rary ("True Romance," "The Professional"),
he simultaneously evokes the historical and
the modern in his portrayal of Beethoven.
Oldman overshadows most of the cast of
"Immortal Beloved," which includes Johan
na Ter Steege, Valeria Golino and Isabella

"Little Women"

At first, and even second glance, waif-like
Winona Ryder seems an odd choice to play Jo
March, the robust, literary, tomboyish misfit
of Louisa May Alcott's "Little Women."
How can someone that cute feel like an
outcast?
