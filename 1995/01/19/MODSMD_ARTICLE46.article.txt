Andale Taqueria How to de
scribe this trendy little place? Perhaps
as the LA. version of Mexican food,
complete with neon fixtures and a
people-watching locale. At any rate,
the fare here is pretty tasty and the
helpings are often enormous. Check
out dishes like the Al Pastor Burrito
or the more-than-filling vegetarian
burrito. Watch out such interesting

offerings as margaritas
made with wine instead
of tequila. This place has
a light and casual atmos
phere, which is accom
panied by a light price
tag, as most meals total
up to less than $8. Ixxat
ed at 209 University Ave.
in Palo Alto, Andal£ is
open Mon. through Sat
from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.
and Sun. 11 a.m. to 9
p.m. 323-2939.
La Costena If you're
up for an evening that
includes great take-out
food, this is definitely

the place to come. La Costena is lo
cated at the back of a corner gro
cery store, which offers a variety of
Mexican and American foodstuffs.
On weekends the line for the taque
ria can be intimidating, but the
food is worth the wait. La Costena
makes your burrito to order, and
sometimes they're big enough to
feed two for dinner. All of the food

here is, happily, quite inexpensive.
Located at 2078 Old Middlefield
Way in Mtn. View, La Costena is
open from Mon. to Sat. from 7 a.m.
to 11 p.m. and Sun. from 7 a.m. to
10 p.m. 967-4969.
La Azteca This cafeteria-style
restaurant offers good food in a ca
sual and friendly atmosphere, right
down to the jukebox full of Mexican
tunes and the red-and-white-check
ered plastic table covers. If you don't
know what to order, the daily spe
cials are usually a good bet, and the
coolers are well-stocked with Mexi
can beers. La Azteca tends to be real
ly inexpensive all around, and most
meals total up to less than $5. La
Azteca is located at 1531 Main St.in
Redwood City, and is open Mon.
through Thurs. from 8:30 a.m. to
9:30 p.m. and Fri. to Sun. from 8
a.m. to 10 p.m. 368-3486.
The Taco Trucks You will
rarely see these trucks roaming
around campus, so make the drive
out to Middlefield Rd. and cruise

around for awhile. You'll be re
warded with either El Grullo or El
Tulense taco truck, both of which
offer several interesting taco possi
bilities for an extraordinarily low
price. The guys who work in these
sandwich-van style vehicles will
make recommendations if you
don't know what to try first. The
food is usually tasty, although vege
tarians should definitely look else
where. The ultimate in take-out
food, a meal at the trucks will run
about $2 to $4. Catch the trucks
along Middlefield Rd. or head to El
Tulense at 2391 Spring Rd. in Red
wood City. 367-1944.
Compadres Perhaps not quite
the real thing, Compadres still of
fers a good selection of Californian
Mexican fare. The combination
plates are filling and pretty inex
pensive, which leaves you to spend
money on other tasty offerings or
pitchers of margaritas. The open
air patio is comfortable, fun and a
gathering spot where you can al
ways be sure of running into Stan

ford folks. The food and drinks at
Compadres are served by an effi
cient and friendly staff, and are
moderately priced. This bar and
restaurant is located at 3877 El
Camino Real in Palo Alto and is
open Mon. through Thurs. from 11

Sun. from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. The
bar is open daily until midnight
and sometimes longer. 858-1141.
El Calderon This restaurant of
fers some of the best Salvadorean
and Mexican food on the Peninsula
and provides a traditional and
comfortable atmosphere to boot.
Try some of the Salvadorean spe
cialties, like the pupusas, or check
out the variety of Mexican and Sal
vadorean seafood dishes. The food
and drinks here are extremely
good, and a meal won't run more
than $12 to $15. El Calderon is lo
cated at 699 Calderon Ave. in Mtn.
