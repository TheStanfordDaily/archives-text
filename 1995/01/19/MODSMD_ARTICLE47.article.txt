■ Sit back and unwind, speculate
on the poster art around you and
sample the microbrews to your
heart's (and liver's) content at Gor
don Biersch Brewery Restaurant.

That's the plan if you want to spend
an evening surrounded by "The Art
of Gundiach Bundschu," the dis
tinctive advertising campaign pre
sented by this highly esteemed win
ery. The winemakers take an irreverent look
at themselves and their industry, even caus
ing some controversy along the way by
putting children in their advertisements for al
cohol. The effrontery of it all is mind-boggling
at times. If the art is too much for you, just
turn your back to it and order another beer.
Gordon Biersch is located at 2 Harrison St. at
the Embarcadero in S.F. For more informa
tion, call 243-8246.

groove to They'll perform with the Bogmen

tively broaden your definition of a drum con
cert, as they employ a variety of artistic

losophy of world
communication
and unity through
the acceptance

the taiko drum,
so that "we might

share the earth."

both interesting
and humorous.

high-brow as they celebrate the
opening of Lewis Watts' exhibition
at the Vision North Gallery. Watts'
photography is world-renowned for
its attempt to encapsulate the cul
tural landscape of the Bay Area in
the faces of the people of the
"African Diaspora." Watts' subject mat
ter generally falls into two categories: people
in their environments and the architectural
environments in which the people have man
ifested themselves and their culture. James
Baldwin once commented that Watts' por
traits contain "the ache and glory of what we
call the past." The reception runs from 6 p.m.
to 8 p.m. at the Vision North Gallery, located
at 2300 Polk St.in S.F. The exhibit runs until
March 11th. Call 474-4581 for more informa
tion.
■ A haunting and almost melan
cholic mood is set as a family deals
with the hazy filter separating truth
and memory. Brian Friel's "Dancing
at Lughnasa" presents this com
passionate portrait of an Irish fami
ly in the 1930s dealing with its in
ternal turmoil. The Irish playwright's Tony
Award-winning vision is being brought to life
by the Palo Alto Players at 8 p.m at the Lucie
Stern Theater, located at 1305 Middlefield
Rd. in Palo Alto. Tickets range from $12 to
$14 for students, and are available by calling

lessons to be
both interesting
and humorous.
Come see this
Lively Arts at
Stanford-spon
sored perfor
mance by the

ing and its most interesting recent
gifts and acquisitions by showing
them off to the public in this two
part exhibition. In addition to the new
works on display, check out some important

works from the museum's permanent collec
tion, including pieces by Matisse and
Diebenkorn. So, dress in black, pick up a
pack of Capri cigarettes and head up the new
SFMOMa, located at 151 Third St.in S.F. Call

WED/25
■ Join the trendy, artistic and
high-brow as they celebrate the
opening of Lewis Watts' exhibition
at the Vision North Gallery. Watts'
photography is world-renowned for
its attempt to encapsulate the cul
tural landscape of the Bay Area in
the faces of the people of the
"African Diaspora." Watts' subject mat
ter generally falls into two categories: people
in their environments and the architectural
environments in which the people have man
ifested themselves and their culture. James
Baldwin once commented that Watts' por
traits contain "the ache and glory of what we
call the past." The reception runs from 6 p.m.
to 8 p.m. at the Vision North Gallery, located
at 2300 Polk St.in S.F. The exhibit runs until
March 11th. Call 474-4581 for more informa
tion.
■ A haunting and almost melan
cholic mood is set as a family deals
with the hazy filter separating truth
and memory. Brian Friel's "Dancing
at Lughnasa" presents this com
passionate portrait of an Irish fami
ly in the 1930s dealing with its in
ternal turmoil. The Irish playwright's Tony
Award-winning vision is being brought to life
by the Palo Alto Players at 8 p.m at the Lucie
Stern Theater, located at 1305 Middlefield
Rd. in Palo Alto. Tickets range from $12 to
$14 for students, and are available by calling
329-0891.

THURS/19
■ Sit back and unwind, speculate
on the poster art around you and
sample the microbrews to your
heart's (and liver's) content at Gor
don Biersch Brewery Restaurant.

That's the plan if you want to spend
an evening surrounded by "The Art
of Gundiach Bundschu," the dis
tinctive advertising campaign pre
sented by this highly esteemed win
ery. The winemakers take an irreverent look
at themselves and their industry, even caus
ing some controversy along the way by
putting children in their advertisements for al
cohol. The effrontery of it all is mind-boggling
at times. If the art is too much for you, just
turn your back to it and order another beer.
Gordon Biersch is located at 2 Harrison St. at
the Embarcadero in S.F. For more informa
tion, call 243-8246.
FRI/20
■ If you didn't catch them last
quarter or on their stints on the
Stanford campus, be sure to check
out the Cherry Poppin' Daddies, de
spite their highly questionable
name. Their mixture of hip-hop and R & B
sounds is definitely danceable and good to
groove to They'll perform with the Bogmen
at the DNA Lounge, located at 375 11th St.in
S.F. Doors open at 9 p.m. Call 626-1409 for
more information.
SAT/21
■ Come see the Kodo taiko drum
mers take Stanford by storm. Brought
to you by Stanford Lively Arts, they will defini
tively broaden your definition of a drum con
cert, as they employ a variety of artistic
media in their performance, including dance,
mime and several other instruments like the

gong, bamboo
flute and wooden
clacker. Kodo
embraces a phi
losophy of world
communication
and unity through
the acceptance
and enjoyment of
the taiko drum,
so that "we might
all be reminded
of the fact that we
share the earth."
Decide for your
self at 8 p.m. at
Memorial Audito
rium. Tickets
range from $11 to
$25 for students,
and are available
through the
