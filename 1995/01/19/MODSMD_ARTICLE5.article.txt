### Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing writer 
Stanford Law Prof. Kathleen Sulli
van walked on familiar ground Tues
day when she argued a class-action
lawsuit before the Supreme Court
challenging limitations on newcomers'
welfare benefits.
"The arguments went well for our
side," Sullivan said after the trial.
"Several justices seemed unwilling to
overturn a quarter century of prece

dent holding that a state must treat
new residents and longtime residents
equally."
The 1992 law in question limits Cal
ifornia newcomers' benefits to the level
they received in the state from which
they came.
The case was brought to trial on be
half of Aid to Fami lies with Dependent
Children (AFDC) recipients who have
moved to California within the last
year.
The law is part of the five-year plan

to cut AFDC grants and provide work
incentives for welfare recipients.
According to Sullivan, however,
"the law means newcomers to the state
are homeless just because they're new.
The Supreme Court has said ever since
the Great Depression that a state is not
allowed" to do that.
The three plaintiffs in the case —
Debby Venturella, DeShawn Green
and Diana Berthollt — claim they
moved to California to escape abusive
spouses and seek support from family

members.
The three women sued the state on
behalf of themselves and thousands of
others in similar situations.
Venturella, for instance, escaped
her abusive husband with her one
year-old daughter and encountered the
new state law forcing her to pay high
California rent with Oklahoma-level
welfare benefits.
She was told that she would be lim-
schools — have resulted in new
budget challenges for SHS.
In addition, SHS is seeing
more patients with pre-paid
health care plans and "those
plans are reducing the amounts
they pay," Mitchell said.
But despite the events of the
past year, she added that this
year's target figure was expected
to be — and is in fact — "a little
lower than last year's." The 1993-
94 revenue enhancements were
$7.5 million and cost reductions
came to $26.1 million for a total of
$33.6 million in budget improve
ment.
"We have the right plan,"
Mitchell said. "We knew this was
coming and it turned out to be just
about what we had planned for."
As in past years, nine opera
tional task forces will pinpoint
targets for reduction by Febru
ary, Mitchell said. The target of
$31.3 million in budget improve
ment is divided up equally among
all SHS programs, she added.
Final recommendations of the
task forces are expected to be fin
ished by April so that the findings
can be incorporated in the 1995-
96 fiscal budget which takes effect
Sept. 1, she added.
Of this year's targeted $25.3
million in cost reduction, $4.7
million will come from medical

"utilization improvement," aimed
at guaranteeing that only neces
sary medical services are deliv
ered, Mitchell said.
"We want to ensure efficient
and appropriate care of patients
and see that there are no duplica
tions," she said.
While staff reduction is always
a possibility in the process,
Mitchell said personnel cuts in
past years occurred largely
through attrition and she expects
the same trend to continue.
The task forces — composed of
people from a variety of depart
ments — will start the Operations
Improvement process by brain
storming possible opportunities
to trim expenses. They will also
examine the practicality of each
opportunity.
While most groups have yet to
begin their work, the Revenue
Enhancement Task Force has
already started looking at ways to
generate or identify $6 million in
new revenue, according to its
chair, Claire Mailhot, director of
surgical program development.
Possible sources of new rev
enue could include uncovering a
lost charge or collecting payment
for a previous unpaid service, she
said.
The task force — which focus
es on outpatient operations of
SHS — has its work cut out for it,
Mailhot said. "Every year it gets
more difficult because there are
fewer errors out there for us to
discover and correct," she said.
