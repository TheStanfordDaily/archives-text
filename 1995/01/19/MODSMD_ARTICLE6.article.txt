# Of mice and rain
## Heavy rains cause mice to overrun Lambda Nu 
### Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing writer 
When Stanford is deluged with heavy
rains the mice run wild in Lambda Nu.
Mice have been spotted in the common
areas, halls and almost every room on the
first floor of Lambda Nu, a house situated
close to Lake Lagunita. A few mice have
been spotted on the second floor as well.

For the kind of living Stan
ford should provide, this is
unacceptable — we
shouldn't have to live in a
dorm with mice.'

"Last quarter a girl woke up with a
mouse on her back," said first-floor resident
Atesa Farshian. Farshian said she and her
roommate can barely sleep anymore.
"I can hear them crawling in the walls at
night," said Farshian's roommate, Angela
Hay del.
Facilities has been notified and has set
up traps in the house, but students, who are
still seeing mice, said they want the Univer
sity to do even more. "I would like Facilities
to do something significant. I feel like it's
not fair for the money we pay to live in those
rooms with mice," Farshian said.

Haydel suggested exterminating the
mice or finding out how the mice are getting
into the house to stop the problem there, in
stead of just setting up traps.
"Facilities told us that they won't do any
thing else unless the problem is more wide
spread," Haydel said. "But everyone has had
mice, some more frequently than others."
"Mice are a real critical concern," said
Lisa Conners, a Facilities employee. "Main
tenance should have set up traps yesterday
after I received the report on mice in the
common areas."
Conners said that if students have prob
lems in their individual rooms they should
contact Facilities and the problem will be
addressed on a room-by-room basis. Bait is
only used in areas that are not accessible to
other animals.
But Farshian said the traps in individual
rooms just don't work, though she added
that she is not upset enough to move out.
Haydel said that the general feeling in
the house seems to be one of anger, frustra
tion and annoyance.
"For the kind of living Stanford should
provide, this is unacceptable," Farshian
said. "Stanford should take a significant
position to eradicate the problem — we
shouldn't have to live in a dorm with
mice."
The mouse problem only seems to hap
pen with heavy rains, said Lynn Glick, as
sociate manager of housing.
"No one else has reported anything,"
Glick said. "The mouse problem at Lambda
Nu seems to be an isolated thing."
