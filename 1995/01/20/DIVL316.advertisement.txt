Technical Leadership Program
GE's entry-level Technical Leadership Program (TLP) offers
three specific learning tracks:
• Design/development
• Manufacturing/sourcing
• Sales/service
The key to each track is a unique combination of formal
training and on-the-job experience (in which you rotate
through four responsible, challenging positions) and that
allows you to explore the world of GE.
You will spend about two years sharpening your technical
skills while at the sametime identifying and understand-ing
your own strengths and the wide-ranging strengths of GE.
When you complete the TLP, you will.be ready to take your
place among the world's most highly spirited and"
entrepreneurial work forces.
