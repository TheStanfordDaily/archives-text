Stanford economics professors Victor Fuchs and
Anne Krueger were appointed president and president
elect of the American Economics Association at its an
nual meeting on Jan. 8.
Fuchs, who is currently on leave, will serve for one
year as president of the organization and probably re
tire from Stanford next year, after being here since
1974.
At the age of 71, Fuchs — the Henry J. Kaiser Jr.
Professor of Economics and Health Research and Poli
cy — said his retirement is "not signed in b100d....
[But] is all but done."
According to Fuchs, the position of president-elect is
"very time consuming" and was one of the reasons for
his leave of absence this year.
However, Krueger — a professor of economics who
transferred from Duke in 1993 — will continue to work
at Stanford despite her duties as president-elect.
As president-elect, Krueger's main responsibility
will be to organize the annual meeting in Washington,
D.C., where the association's headquarters are located.
Acr ding to Fuchs, this is the biggest part of thejob,
one which is now behind him as he prepares for his re
sponsibilities, which are primarily to chair the execu
tive committee and appoint members to the organiza
tion.
The association, which is the nation's largest orga
nization of economists, has three principal functions.
It holds annual meetings, which roughly 8,000 econ
omists attend. In addition, it contributes to the eco
nomic job market by pairing economists, most of
whom have just finished doctorates, with jobs.
Finally, the association sponsors three trade jour
nals: American Economic Review, The Journal of
Economic Literature and The Journal of Economic
Perspective.
Both Stanford professors are well known in their
respective fields, Krueger in international economics
and economic development, and Fuchs in health and
medical-care issues.
