## Earthquake toll reaches 4,000 Survivors still being pulled from rubble; new fires break out 
### 
KOBE, Japan (AP) — Swiss res
cue dogs led search teams to more
entombed bodies yesterday as the
earthquake death toll swelled past
4,000, and the bark of a pet dog led
to one woman's rescue after more
than two icy days in the wreckage.
New fires burst out around the
shattered city, and firefighters'
efforts to douse them were stymied
by crushed water mains. With gov
ernment relief efforts falling far
short of victims' needs, thousands
more gave up hope of finding food
and shelter and joined the stream of
residents abandoning the city on
foot.
By early today, confirmed deaths
totaled 4,047, making Tuesday's
7.2-magnitude earthquake the
worst in Japan in more than 70
years.
Another 727 people were still
unaccounted for, and freezing tem
peratures made relatives more des
perate about finding missing
friends or family members alive.
But several rescues yesterday

revived hopes.
In one Kobe neighborhood, a
barking pet dog led rescuers to his
owner, 65-year-old Chiyoko
Amakawa, who had been buried for
53 hours, Kyodo News Service
reported. Doctors said she was
badly bruised but suffered no bro
ken bones.
"It was pitch dark and my leg
hurt so much and I was thirsty, but
I called to 'Pochi' and told him I was
in pain and needed help," Amakawa
told Kyodo. "I just wondered over
and over again when I was going to
die."
Others rescued alive in Kobe
included a 9-year-old boy and a 94-
year-old man.
The shocking extent of the dam
age moved Japan's emperor, who
rarely comments on natural disas
ters, to offer condolences, appeal for
"strong solidarity" and urge more
precautions in the future.
More than 21,600 people were
injured, and more than 30,400
homes and buildings were severely

damaged or destroyed in and
around Kobe, a once-vibrant port of
1.4 million people.
Six U.S. Air Force C-130 trans
port planes flew supplies to nearby
Osaka, including 15,000 blankets
for survivors huddled in emergency
shelters. More flights were planned
today.
Switzerland dispatched a team of
rescuers with trained dogs, which
discovered four dead bodies by last
night.
The death toll surpassed the offi
cial tally of 3,769 in a 1948 quake in
Fukui, but still paled in comparison
with a 1923 quake that killed more
than 100,000 in and around Tokyo.
The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said
two Americans died in Kobe's
quake, a female English teacher
whose name wasn't released and
another teacher — Voni Lynn
Wong, 24, of Los Angeles.
Temporary shelters were
jammed with 270,000 people, many
of whom had fled homes they feared
may yet collapse.
