### 
GROZNY, Russia (AP) — Russian troops
drove Chechen fighters from the presiden
tial palace yesterday and hoisted Russia's
flag over what remained of the rebels'
stronghold and symbol of their defiance.
While the victory in Chechnya's capital
was a rare boost for Russian morale in the
five-week-old war, rebel fighters said it only
signals a new guerrilla phase of their cam
paign to win independence from Moscow.
They abandoned the charred, smoking
skeleton of the palace and also pulled back
from the train station, another base of their
resistance in the center of Grozny.
Until now, the war had been almost
entirely centered on the palace. Now
Chechens deny the palace had much military
significance and promise to defend their cap
ital inch by inch.
"Our new headquarters is set up and the
fighters are in their positions," Chechen
Defense Minister Asian Maskhaev said at a
news conference in Nay.ran, capital of neigh

boring Ingushetia.
"We're ready to continue our fight for
freedom."
The Russians said the loss of the palace
signaled the end for the separatists.
"I would like to inform everyone that the
military phase of restoring the Russian Con
stitution in Chechnya is now practically
over," President Boris Yeltsin said in a state
ment.
"The subsequent mission to restore law,
order and civil rights will he with the Interi
or Ministry," the president said.
If the Chechens carry out their vow to
defend Grozny, Russian commanders will
face a tough choice.
They can oust the rebels from the rest of
Grozny the way they ousted them from the
palace — by destroying from a distance with
their immense firepower — or they can try
to nudge their so-far reluctant ground forces
into taking on the Chechens in house-to
house fighting.
