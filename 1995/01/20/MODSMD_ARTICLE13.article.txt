1.2 billion and growing
BEIJING (AP) — China's vast pop
ulation will reach 1.2 billion people in
mid-February, the official China Daily
newspaper reported Thursday.
Despite a widely criticized policy of
forcibly limiting births, China
acknowledged in the late 1980s that it
couldn't meet its goal of holding the
population under 1.2 billion until the
end of the century.
But family planning policy delayed
reaching the 1.2 billion mark by nine
years, said Yang Kuifu, vice minister
of the State Family Planning Commis
sion.
The official Xinhua News Agency
reported earlier that the population
hit 1.2 billion before Dec. 31. But the

new figures from the State Statistical
Bureau are considered more accurate.
China limits couples of having just
one or two children, and has been
accused of imposing forced steriliza
tions, abortions and use of contracep
tion.
Yang said 300 million births were
averted from 1973 to 1993, but neither
report said how those births were
averted.
Crazed fan
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)- A
stranger approached a group of men
and asked them if they were fans of
the hometown team. When they said
yes, he opened fire, killing one and
seriously wounding another.

Police assume the gunman in the
shooting was a fan of the Dallas Cow
boys, defeated Sunday in the playoff
that sent the San Francisco 49ers to
the Super Bowl, homicide inspector
Napoleon Hendrix said Wednesday.
The assailant walked up to the
group of men standing on the street
and asked if they were for the 49ers,
Hendrix said. They yelled "Yeah!",
and he made an obscene remark and
then began shooting.
A 21-year-old man was shot in the
head and killed. A 29-year-old man
remained in serious condition today
with three gunshot wounds.
The dead man's friends gathered at
the same spot the night after the
killing for a beer-drinking memorial,
Hendrix said.
