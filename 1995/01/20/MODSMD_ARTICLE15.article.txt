Common ground is not
out of reach in conflict
over new plans for CIV

IT'S BACK - ANOTHER debate
on how to teach the all-impor
tant freshman core curriculum
called Cultures, Ideas and Values.
Now that the aftershocks of the con
tentious Western Cultures debate
have subsided, a reform commission
has proposed yet more significant
alterations to which a group of 40
faculty members — the ones who
actually teach the course — have
objected.
Maybe the question of how best
to teach CIV will never go away. And
certainly, improvement should
never be a closed issue. But it is a
good idea to examine when an over
haul is necessary, and when a few
minor adjustments will suffice.
The Commission on Undergradu
ate Education recently recommend
ed that CIV be altered to encompass
the material covered in what is now
split into two distribution require
ments for culture: American and
Non-Western or "World" Cultures.
This proposal has several impli
cations. First, it would be a most
welcome reduction of DRs. In sum,
the commission's proposal reduces
the required number of courses
from 11 to nine and offers more flex
ibility in fulfilling those require
ments, allowing students to take
more classes of their own choosing.
At the same time, however, the
proposal also may be biting off more
than any professor cares to chew.
The already overloaded CIV reading
list would become even longer, and
both students' and CIV instructors'
time could be spread far thinner —
imagine going through all nine cir
cles of Hell in five days, rather than
a week and a half.
Some also worry that the study of
cultures may not be accorded
enough depth within an already
packed curriculum. Incorporating

meaningful aspects of the American
and World Cultures DRs, however,
is not impossible. In fact, CIV tracks
such as Literature and the Arts and
Great Works already include a fine
mixture of American, non-Western
and European readings.
With some cooperative fine-tun
ing, all CIV tracks can come to
encompass these areas. Since this
would likely translate in more work
for students, perhaps it could be
offered for one or two additional
units. This plan would still conserve
units in the long run. Of course, it
must be remembered that instruc
tors' workloads should not be
increased without compensation.
The CIV instructors have raised
the point that the new proposal to
revamp CIV requires less common
ality among the various CIV tracks,
rather than more. It mandates only
two universal readings among CIV
tracks. While CIV tracks might still
choose to study many of the same
books, such a change could ironical
ly reduce the "common freshman
experience" to a much narrower def
inition, consisting of a mere pair of
classic works.
A final but crucial point is that
the faculty who teach CIV are large
ly unhappy with the commission's
proposal and feel they have been left
out of the planning loop. Given this
current displeasure, who would
want to teach the new course?
Examination by non-CIV faculty
lends a necessary new perspective
on an old topic. But close consulta
tion with CIV faculty members
themselves is just as necessary in
order to yield the best — or, indeed,
any — outcome.
All parties agree that CIV can use
a few changes. And given the
course's goals — offering a broad
understanding of both Western and
non-Western civilization and culture
— it seems that we're further along
than many realize in accomplishing
them. What is needed now is some
cooperation to complete the current
evolution of CIV and to ensure that
the final changes are ones everyone
can live with.
