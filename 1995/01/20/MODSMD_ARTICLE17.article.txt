## Mörk Murdock Amendment would fix ailing fee system 
### 
For too long,
the special-fee
system has hurt
students and student
groups alike. The cur
rent system is unfair,
inefficient, confusing
and unstable. After
five years of watching a
bad system get worse,

senators voted 17-3 to call a special elec
tion to finally fix this broken system.
Last year, more than 50 percent of
graduate students refunded their fees
to express their anger at funding groups
their community did not approve. The
current system overcharges students
$400,000 a year in fees to support these
refunds. None of this money ever funds
student group activities. In the spring
election, 12 groups representing a vari
ety of goals and interests were denied
funding despite winning an overwhelm
ing average of 63 percent of the under
graduate vote. In striking contrast to
the undergraduate vote, on average
only 37 percent of graduate students
approved these groups.
In response to the chaos following
the spring 1994 election, a task force
consisting of undergraduates, gradu
ates and administrators and chaired by
a leader of the Graduate Student Tea
Party was created to design a new sys
tem to best serve you. The task force
spent hundreds of hours drafting the
Balanced Funding Deal, and the result
awaits your vote on Wednesday, Jan. 25
and Thursday, Jan. 26.
The BFD is a comprehensive solution
which will restore stability and fairness

to a failing special-fee system. It
addresses all the problems:
• Caps the amount of special fees the
senate can place on the ballot. This will
prevent skyrocketing fees, thereby sav
ing you money.
• Eliminates fee refunds, making the
spring election decisive in determining
the funding of student groups: no sec
ond-guessing for student groups and no
overcharging you.
• Splits the vote between grads and
undergrads. As distinct communities
with very different interests and needs,
each funds the student groups from
which they benefit.
• Allows student groups not
approved by the senate to petition for
placement on the ballot, which then
requires 60 percent approval. The
choice for funding will ultimately be in
your hands.
• Prohibits student fees to be used for
partisan political or religious activities.
Your money will go to activities which
benefit the entire student population.
• Allows students to conscientiously
object to funding specific events based
on personal principle. You fund what
you want funded.
The fees charged to you and the
funding of student groups will be affect
ed in the following manner: Currently,
graduates and undergraduates pay the
same fee of $34 per quarter. This funds
18 student groups.
Under the new system, in the most
likely scenario, the following will occur:
The budgets placed on the ballot by the
senate could all be approved by the stu
dent body. If students choose to do this in

the election, about 30 student groups
would receive funding. Grads will likely
approve a core list of about six groups like
Legal Counseling, Club Sports and the
Speakers Bureau. Undergrads could
choose to approve all groups. In this case,
grad fees would drop to $15 per quarter.
Undergrad fees would rise to $45 per
quarter. But the cost of funding 12 addi
tional student groups would be $11.
The bottom line of the ballot cap is
that undergraduate fees will not effec
tively rise above $49 per quarter. The
size of all fees is determined by an elec
tion in which each community chooses
the groups they feel deserve funding.
All money funded is guaranteed to go to
funding only the activities which groups
promise in their budgets. The spring
election is decisive and fair.
The BFD finally creates a fair and
stable special-fee system. This new fee
system equitably meets the needs of
undergraduates, graduates and student
groups. Reform is long overdue; now is
the time to restore stability to the
financial approval of student activities.
These organizations, vital to not only
students but also communities in and
outside of Stanford, deserve to have
their funding requests met if students
so choose. Students' costs will be con
trolled, and student groups will be
allowed to effectively and efficiently
budget their finances.
This amendment is endorsed by the
Graduate Student Tea Party.
