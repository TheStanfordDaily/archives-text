Seniors, look before you leap into law school's abyss

YOU SENIORS APPLYING to law
school: stop before it's too late!
You're probably making a big
mistake.
Each year, hordes of sensible
seniors, lured by attractive benefits in
the short term and undissuaded by
their ignorance about the long term,
shuffle off toward law school. After
all, it's a very respectable choice
(friends are admiring, relatives are
proud, acquaintances are impressed).
It squeezes immediate value out of the
great credentials you've struggled for.
It seems to promise, off in the vaguely
imagined future, a life of status,
money, influence, intellectual stimula
tion and maybe good works. It avoids
the anxiety-filled "What in the world
am I going to do with my life?" abyss
— and what else can you do, you
might be thinking, if you don't like
numbers, blood or business? (Stanford
itself won't discourage you, of course
— successful law grads make generous
and influential alumni.)
Unfortunately, in taking this step
you're overlooking two crucial facts:
(1) This is a much larger, more fateful
decision than you realize; (2) If you go
to law school, there's a good chance
that yon will not end up very happy.
First: going to law school is a choice
of career, and not simply a way to
defer that choice for a few years. The
long slog through law school will sub
stantially narrow your options. Many
of your talents, interests and inclina
tions will begin to atrophy seriously.
And you'll be forgoing three years of
developing new interests and capaci
ties. Not just any three years, either:
your early 20s are prime years for
learning and growth, a time you'll
soon mis* for its energy, confidence
and freedom from responsibilities.

They're three precious years you can't
have back once they're squandered.
None of this may trouble you. It
may seem now that there's a plentiful
supply of years ahead, and that you'll
have no trouble heading off in a new
direction after law school. Don't be
too sure of yourself. Once you've
invested all the time and money (and
accumulated debt?), have had summer
law jobs and seen the high-paying,
high status ones that law grads get,
have spent three years developing and
narrowing your character (wittingly
or not) toward that of a lawyer and
have perhaps lost some of your
already small stomach for career
uncertainty and for starting from
scratch (especially if you feel ready for
a predictable, stable future with a
partner), the pressures to follow your
classmates into law practice will be
overpowering. Face yourself and your
reasons for applying to law school
honestly: if you find it tough now to
risk plunging into an uncharted
future and to forgo a comfortable
career track, you'll probably find it
impossible later.
Sadly, our society encourages its
young talents in many subtle ways to
embark (without adequate informa
tion) upon career paths that reduce
them to productive intellectual
machines whose energies get extracted
for the sake of nothing they really
care about. Particularly insidious is
how such a career track, once it lures
undergrads aboard, gradually erodes
their senses of freedom and control
over how they are to live out their
lives: people often feel unable to
escape from these careers and some
times lose even the awareness that
escape is possible. This is no joke. You
get only one try at life; you can't do

the safe thing the first time around
and assume that somewhere in the
back of your mind that there will be a
second chance.
So if you want to "keep your
options open," do just that. Get a job,
travel or sign up for a hitch of public
service. Do not go to law (or grad)
school. Don't do anything weaselly,
either, like applying and then defer
ring admission — it'll just suck you in
(as it did me). (If it gives you
strength, remember that you can
always apply later, and you'll be an
even more attractive candidate then.)
Second, about chances of finding
happiness in the law: not even law
students, let alone undergrads, have
any accurate idea what a lawyer's life
is like, and how unpleasant, uninspir
ing, unedifying, arduous and unfulfill
ing it often is. So many vibrant, opti
mistic, multifaceted 21-year-olds
eagerly sign up for careers that, unbe
knownst to them, are likely to end up
cramped, draining and depressing.
Consider a recent survey by the Cali
fornia State Bar (The New York
Times, Nov. 12): "fewer than half of
the lawyers questioned said that most
lawyers have high ethical standards
and nearly a third said they wished
they had chosen another profession."
Whet your appetite? The reality is
undoubtedly even worse, given the
bias against admitting the wrongness
of our choices.
Even if you happen to be someone
who would enjoy the daily lawyerly
routine — and you can't honestly say
you know that at this point, can you?
— a legal career still might be all
wrong. Fulfillment in a job involves
more than just liking the activities
one performs; it requires a good feel
ing about the enterprise — a content-

Ed, if not proud, feeling about how
you're spending your talents, what
kind of people you're affiliated with,
and what you're contributing to the
world. This may now seem very
abstract and overly intellectualized,
but believe me, it will eventually make
a big, concrete day-to-day impact on
how happy you are. And lawyers do
not typically score high on such mea
sures of satisfaction.
Given the understandable ignorance
that undergrads feel about what vari
ous careers are really like and the
ongoing brain drain into certain profes
sions, Stanford owes its students more
information about careers outside law,
medicine, investment banking, consult
ing and other high-status, high-visibili
ty options. Every student ought to be
provided with at least a list of the
entire range of specific occupations in
which Stanford alumni are engaged (a
somewhat detailed job description for
each would be even better). Just think
about what such a simple resource
might do for a student: all kinds of
vocations that are now either
unknown, overlooked in the preoccupa
tion with graduate applications and
upscale on-campus interviews or
wrongly assumed to be unserious fan
tasies could suddenly appear as realis
tic possibilities. (And you could show
Mom and Dad that there are Stanford
grads already making a living at doing
just what you want to do.)
So don't take the easy default law
school option. Struggle to find an
important and satisfying direction for
your life. Have confidence. Be opti
mistic. Don't be afraid to dream a lit
tle!

is like, and how unpleasant, uninspir
ing, unedifying, arduous and unfulfill
ing it often is. So many vibrant, opti
mistic, multifaceted 21-year-olds
eagerly sign up for careers that, unbe
knownst to them, are likely to end up
cramped, draining and depressing.
Consider a recent survey by the Cali
fornia State Bar (The New York
Times, Nov. 12): "fewer than half of
the lawyers questioned said that most
lawyers have high ethical standards
and nearly a third said they wished
they had chosen another profession."
Whet your appetite? The reality is
undoubtedly even worse, given the
bias against admitting the wrongness
of our choices.
Even if you happen to be someone
who would enjoy the daily lawyerly
routine — and you can't honestly say
you know that at this point, can you?
— a legal career still might be all
wrong. Fulfillment in a job involves
more than just liking the activities
one performs; it requires a good feel
ing about the enterprise — a content-

Ed, if not proud, feeling about how
you're spending your talents, what
kind of people you're affiliated with,
and what you're contributing to the
world. This may now seem very
abstract and overly intellectualized,
but believe me, it will eventually make
a big, concrete day-to-day impact on
how happy you are. And lawyers do
not typically score high on such mea
sures of satisfaction.
Given the understandable ignorance
that undergrads feel about what vari
ous careers are really like and the
ongoing brain drain into certain profes
sions, Stanford owes its students more
information about careers outside law,
medicine, investment banking, consult
ing and other high-status, high-visibili
ty options. Every student ought to be
provided with at least a list of the
entire range of specific occupations in
which Stanford alumni are engaged (a
somewhat detailed job description for
each would be even better). Just think
about what such a simple resource
might do for a student: all kinds of
vocations that are now either
unknown, overlooked in the preoccupa
tion with graduate applications and
upscale on-campus interviews or
wrongly assumed to be unserious fan
tasies could suddenly appear as realis
tic possibilities. (And you could show
Mom and Dad that there are Stanford
grads already making a living at doing
just what you want to do.)
So don't take the easy default law
school option. Struggle to find an
important and satisfying direction for
your life. Have confidence. Be opti
mistic. Don't be afraid to dream a lit
tle!

Seniors, look before you leap into law school's abyss

YOU SENIORS APPLYING to law
school: stop before it's too late!
You're probably making a big
mistake.
Each year, hordes of sensible
seniors, lured by attractive benefits in
the short term and undissuaded by
their ignorance about the long term,
shuffle off toward law school. After
all, it's a very respectable choice
(friends are admiring, relatives are
proud, acquaintances are impressed).
It squeezes immediate value out of the
great credentials you've struggled for.
It seems to promise, off in the vaguely
imagined future, a life of status,
money, influence, intellectual stimula
tion and maybe good works. It avoids
the anxiety-filled "What in the world
am I going to do with my life?" abyss
— and what else can you do, you
might be thinking, if you don't like
numbers, blood or business? (Stanford
itself won't discourage you, of course
— successful law grads make generous
and influential alumni.)
Unfortunately, in taking this step
you're overlooking two crucial facts:
(1) This is a much larger, more fateful
decision than you realize; (2) If you go
to law school, there's a good chance
that yon will not end up very happy.
First: going to law school is a choice
of career, and not simply a way to
defer that choice for a few years. The
long slog through law school will sub
stantially narrow your options. Many
of your talents, interests and inclina
tions will begin to atrophy seriously.
And you'll be forgoing three years of
developing new interests and capaci
ties. Not just any three years, either:
your early 20s are prime years for
learning and growth, a time you'll
soon mis* for its energy, confidence
and freedom from responsibilities.

They're three precious years you can't
have back once they're squandered.
None of this may trouble you. It
may seem now that there's a plentiful
supply of years ahead, and that you'll
have no trouble heading off in a new
direction after law school. Don't be
too sure of yourself. Once you've
invested all the time and money (and
accumulated debt?), have had summer
law jobs and seen the high-paying,
high status ones that law grads get,
have spent three years developing and
narrowing your character (wittingly
or not) toward that of a lawyer and
have perhaps lost some of your
already small stomach for career
uncertainty and for starting from
scratch (especially if you feel ready for
a predictable, stable future with a
partner), the pressures to follow your
classmates into law practice will be
overpowering. Face yourself and your
reasons for applying to law school
honestly: if you find it tough now to
risk plunging into an uncharted
future and to forgo a comfortable
career track, you'll probably find it
impossible later.
Sadly, our society encourages its
young talents in many subtle ways to
embark (without adequate informa
tion) upon career paths that reduce
them to productive intellectual
machines whose energies get extracted
for the sake of nothing they really
care about. Particularly insidious is
how such a career track, once it lures
undergrads aboard, gradually erodes
their senses of freedom and control
over how they are to live out their
lives: people often feel unable to
escape from these careers and some
times lose even the awareness that
escape is possible. This is no joke. You
get only one try at life; you can't do

the safe thing the first time around
and assume that somewhere in the
back of your mind that there will be a
second chance.
So if you want to "keep your
options open," do just that. Get a job,
travel or sign up for a hitch of public
service. Do not go to law (or grad)
school. Don't do anything weaselly,
either, like applying and then defer
ring admission — it'll just suck you in
(as it did me). (If it gives you
strength, remember that you can
always apply later, and you'll be an
even more attractive candidate then.)
Second, about chances of finding
happiness in the law: not even law
students, let alone undergrads, have
any accurate idea what a lawyer's life
is like, and how unpleasant, uninspir
ing, unedifying, arduous and unfulfill
ing it often is. So many vibrant, opti
mistic, multifaceted 21-year-olds
eagerly sign up for careers that, unbe
knownst to them, are likely to end up
cramped, draining and depressing.
