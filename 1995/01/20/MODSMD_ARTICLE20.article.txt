## In their face! Stanford deals Cal a 78-73 defeat Cardinal wins battle of the free throws to silence Bear hopes for comeback 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Like two colossal forces
matched in a grueling duel of
honor, Stanford and California
traded shots like heavyweight
behemoths in front of 6,758
crazed Bear fans last night at
Harmon Arena.
While Cal managed to fend
off any one single knockout
punch by the Cardinal, it was
the constant staccato jabs of
Stanford sinking its free throws
that sealed the Bears' doom.
Nailing 19-of-22 shots from the
foul line (including 6-6 in the
final 56.1 seconds of the game),
Stanford held on to wear down
a feisty Cal squad 78-73.
"IFree throws] have been
awfully important," head coach
Mike Montgomery said. "I've
got some calls from some far
away places about shooting free
throws. If we don't make those
on the road, we probably are
not going to win."
Maintaining a lead through
out the second half, Stanford
pushed the spread to 10 at the
9:27 mark. The Cardinal then
saw Cal trim away at that lead
like a punch-drunk fighter bat
tling back from the brink. The
Bears knotted the score at 70
with 2:08 left in the game on a
Jelani Gardner jumpshot.
Unbeknownst to the raving
Bear fans in the stands, that
was exactly how sophomore
point guard Brevin Knight
wanted it.
"We're tired of being the sec
ond school in the Bay Area,"
Knight said. "[At Cal] the fans
are all over you, yelling at you
behind the bench. But the end
of the game is my time, when I
reverse the crowd. At the end,

they couldn't look me in the
eyes â€” that's the way I like it."
A driving baseline lay-in by
junior Dion Cross was
answered by Gardner's
turnaround jumper over Knight
on the right box. Cross then
sunk two free throws, giving
Stanford a valuable two-point
cushion at 74-72 with 49.7 sec
onds left.
After a Cal timeout, the
Bears had the option of trading
two shots for one if they were to
take a quick shot, but Cal coach
Todd Bozeman elected to set up
a good shot to go for the tie.
Dribbling the ball around the
top of the key, Cal couldn't find
an open shot until 25 seconds
had run off the clock. Fresh
man Tony Gonzalez tried a
turnaround jumper from the
baseline that didn't even come
close, and senior Andy Poppink
gathered in the rebound and
was fouled immediately.
"We ran a play to get a shot
and we didn't get it," Bozeman
said.
Poppink's two foul shots
struck like hammer blows to
the Cal faithful, and another
two free throws by Knight fin
ished off the Bears.
"They didn't make the mis
takes at the end of the game to
cost them the game," said Cal
guard Anwar McQueen.
Neither team was able to
take control of the game,
despite several 10-point leads
by Stanford. Whenever it
seemed like a Cross three-point
bomb would bury the Bears, Cal
answered with a trey of their
own.
Even though the Bears man
aged to shoot over 50 percent
