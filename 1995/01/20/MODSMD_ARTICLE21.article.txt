Playing in front of a hostile, rav
ing, maniacal full-house on the road
will never be at the top of the Stan
ford men's basketball team's wish
list. But that's what the 21st
ranked Cardinal (12-2 overall, 3-2
in the Pacific 10 Conference) faced
last night entering raucous Har
mon Arena to take on California (8-
5 overall, 1-4 Pac-10).
Of course with a 78-73 victory
last night, those trips might just be
a little bit sweeter.
"That's a great win for us, no
question about it," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery. "We
haven't won over here for awhile,
and Cal's got an outstanding bas
ketball team, so for us to come over
here and win means a lot."
The victory in the rambunctious
Bear's den threw off some miscon
ceptions and established the Cardi
nal, not the Bears, as the Bay Area's
preeminent basketball team.
"Everybody always told us 'Cal
this, Cal that,' then us," said sopho
more point guard Brevin Knight.
"We feel that it's us. It's big for our
confidence, and it's big for our
school.
"I have a lot of fun playing here.
I love when the fans try to get on
you at the beginning of the game.
Now at the end of the game, it's my
turn to talk. Their feelings were a
little bit hurt by that. As soon as you
reverse it on them, what can they
say?"
But it was no easy task. The two
teams started the game slow,

appearing to feel each other out like
two heavyweights in a champi
onship fight. No doubt to both
teams, that's what it was.
It wasn't until four minutes, 53
seconds into the game that Stanford
center Tim Young sunk the Cardi
nal's first field goal. Fortunately,
the Bears hadn't been scoring much
either. But after that initial period
of acquaintance, the fireworks
began.
Knight sparked the Cardinal
offense, dishing out several crisp
assists to teammates Young, David
Harbour and Bart Lammersen.
Lammersen's lay up with just
under 10 minutes to go in the first
half extended Stanford's lead to
seven.
Cal countered under the shoot
ing of forward Monty Buckley who
scored five straight points to bring
the Bears within two. Cal guard
Anwar McQueen's driving layup
evened the score, and Bears fans
were licking their chops anticipat
ing another win over the Cardinal.
Nothing was easy though, as the
two teams continued to jockey back
and forth to gain control going into
halftime, but with the first half
winding down it was all Knight. To
warm up, Knight nailed a 10-foot
baseline jumper, then dished it off
to his compatriot, sharpshooter
Dion Cross, for a three-pointer with
just under five minutes remaining.
With Cal entering the last three
minutes with a one-point edge,
Knight exploded for eight straight
points in nearly every way imagin
able. There was a 14-foot running
jumper, a penetrating lay-up off the
glass, a free throw, and the coup de
grace, a trey at the buzzer. So
although the Axe was paraded
around Harmon at halftime, it was
the Cardinal who was up 39-32.
