# Women swimmers travel to Arizona, Arizona State
## 
### Ezra Baylin Contributing writer 
After squeaking by second-ranked Michi
gan last Saturday, the top-ranked Stanford
women's swimming team puts its 45-meet
winning streak on the line in Arizona this
weekend as it faces Pacific 10 Conference
rivals Arizona State and Arizona.
Today, the Cardinal faces the eighth
ranked Wildcats, lead by Olympian Ashley
Tappin.
"Arizona is a top-10 team," said head coach
Richard Quick. "[The Wildcats] are going to
have a chance to be a top-five team, and they
are always the type of team that you have to
watch out for."

The scare at deGuerre last Saturday
brought about by the Cardinal's narrow win
over Michigan did not prompt Stanford to rest
up for its dual meets this weekend. Although
resting could enhance performances, the team
prescribes to a long-term training regimen
that it hopes will result in a fourth NCAA
title.
"We have been training real hard this
week," Quick said. "The team has done a lot of
high-intensity, quality workouts and hard,
quality yards."
Although the practices have been difficult,
Quick feels that some of his swimmers are
primed for a great weekend of record-break-

"Freshman Michelle Collins has
had her best week of training and
freshmen Amy Oberhelman has a
chance to have a great meet," he
said. As a high school senior, Collins
pasted NCAA championship-caliber
times.
"This could be as good a meet as
any to qualify for the NCAA Cham
pionships in either the 100 or 200
butterfly events," Collins said.
All in all, however, the Wildcats
are not the type of team that will let
the No. 1 Cardinal intimidate them.
At this point in the season, more

for the NCAA Championships than

son's teammate on the 1992
Olympic Team in Barcelona. They
both swim the sprint free events.
"Ashley will give Jenny Thomp
son or Claudia Franco a great race
in the 50- and 100- yard free
sprints," said senior co-captain
Becky Crowe.
After Arizona, Stanford will set
its sights on 13th-ranked Arizona
State. The Sun Devils also boast
potent talent, particularly in the
breast stroke, thanks to junior
Beata Kaszubda, who won the 100-
yard breast at last year's NCAA
meet and holds the U.S. Open
record in the 200-meter breast.
However, Arizona State does not
feature the depth that Michigan
ana Arizona have demonstrated
this season. According to Quick,
Stanford should beat the Sun Dev
ils even with nagging injuries to key
team members senior Mary Ellen
Blanchard, junior Allison Higson
and sophomore Kerry O'Hanlon.
The only potential problem for
the Cardinal is that it has not seen
the Sun Devils in action thus far
this year. Arizona State did not
compete in the Texas Invitational,
which gathered many of the top
teams in the nation.
"This is the first time we are
swimming ASU this year so we
really have no idea what they can
do," said senior co-captain Kendra
Thaye .
Regardless of how the other
teams look, Stanford will swim its
own meets today and tomorrow.
"We expect to get better every
week," Quick said. "We are getting
ready for March and the NCAA
tournament."
