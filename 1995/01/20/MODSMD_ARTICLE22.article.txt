After squeaking by second-ranked Michi
gan last Saturday, the top-ranked Stanford
women's swimming team puts its 45-meet
winning streak on the line in Arizona this
weekend as it faces Pacific 10 Conference
rivals Arizona State and Arizona.
Today, the Cardinal faces the eighth
ranked Wildcats, lead by Olympian Ashley
Tappin.
"Arizona is a top-10 team," said head coach
Richard Quick. "[The Wildcats] are going to
have a chance to be a top-five team, and they
are always the type of team that you have to
watch out for."

The scare at deGuerre last Saturday
brought about by the Cardinal's narrow win
over Michigan did not prompt Stanford to rest
up for its dual meets this weekend. Although
resting could enhance performances, the team
prescribes to a long-term training regimen
that it hopes will result in a fourth NCAA
title.
"We have been training real hard this
week," Quick said. "The team has done a lot of
high-intensity, quality workouts and hard,
quality yards."
Although the practices have been difficult,
Quick feels that some of his swimmers are
primed for a great weekend of record-break-
