# No time to rest on its laurels
## Stanford men's swimming looks to affirm No. 1 ranking against Wildcats, Sun Devils 
### John Fabian 
The Cardinal men's swimming team
opens its Pacific 10 Conference season with
two dual meets in Arizona this weekend.
Today, it will face off against the Wildcats
in Tucson, and tomorrow it will storm into
Tempe to take on the Sun Devils.
After the big meets against Texas and
Michigan, Stanford swimmers do not
expect the Arizona teams to provide terri
bly intense competition. Although the Car
dinal lost in November to a fired-up
Longhorns squad, it steamed by the then
top-ranked Wolverines last weekend to
take over the No. 1 ranking. This week,
Stanford is prepared to show that it
deserves to sit atop the polls.

"What we're concentrating on is proving
that last week was not an anomaly or aber
ration, but was proof of what kind of team
we are," said senior Clay Tippins. "We
want to raise expectations and keep swim
ming at the level that we swam at last
week."
About the upcoming meets, Tippins
said, "It's not easy. We can't loaf. If we
swim like we should, we'll win. As long as
we don't get caught with our pants down,
and we swim hard, we'll win."
One challenge the Cardinal will confront
is Chad Carvin of Arizona, an American
record setter in the 500-yard freestyle and
an excellent distance swimmer. Carvin will
take part in what look to be some
exciting individual matchups.
However, on a team level,
Stanford does not believe the
Arizona squads will be able to
compete. The Cardinal remains
confident that if each swimmer

concentrates on his individual
performance, the team scores
should favor Stanford.
These individual and relay
performances are a buildup as,
at this point in the season, the
Cardinal swimmers are begin
ning to look ahead to the Pac-10
Championships. Each swimmer
is concentrating on improving
himself and reaching his peak
level in his best events.

"This meet is not as big as a
Michigan or a Texas," senior
Kurt Grote said. "We're concen
trating more on fine tuning now
and focusing on getting each per
son to swim his best. With only
19 swimmers going to the Pac-10
meets, we're focusing on our
best events. We're pretty heavily
favored. As long as we swim
hard, we shouldn't have too
much of a problem."
