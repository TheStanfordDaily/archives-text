# Women's hoops to host California
## 
### Emery Chen Satff writer 
For the fans of the strange and
unusual, tonight proves to be promising,
as the Stanford women's basketball
team (13-1,4-0 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) takes on California (6-7,1-3), con
tinuing the rivalry that consumes the
two Bay Area schools.
The twilight zone— Those who have
faithfully gone to Cardinal basketball
games know that the traditional start
ing time is 7:30 p.m. But tonight, the
world is put on hold as the tip-off com
mences at 9:00 p.m.

Explanations for this phenomenon
range from the bizarre to the macabre,
but the truth is actually quite simple —
Dan and Keith are to blame for the
change.
ESPN will be in town as the appro
priately monikered "total sports net
work™" once again adds women's bas
ketball to its resume. After last night's
coverage of the men's game, the net
work drove across the Bay and parked
on the campus of Stanford University,
giving the Cardinal another nationally
televised game. For the 25th time in the
last six years, Stanford has a chance to
show off its wares in front of the Ameri

can viewing public.
Socialism— During the process of
destroying teams left and right, oppo
nents and fans have marveled at the
number of Cardinal players that took
part in the carnage. Led by sophomore
Kate Starbird, 12 Cardinal currently
average 10 or more minutes.
"The key to the team is the good
depth," coach Tar a VanDerveer said.
"Anytime we have 10,11 or 12 [players]
playing, it's going to be beneficial."
Opposing teams have been worn
down by the constant influx of bodies off
of the Stanford bench, and the
recent point totals have shown it.
Finals of 86-51, 94-59 and 107-63
against Arizona, Washington State
and Providence serve as testimony
to the team's ability.
Senior Anita Kaplan feels that
the Cardinal can only get better.
"We're practicing well together
but we still have room for improve
ment," Kaplan said. "We were dis
appointed in our defense in the first
half against Arizona State."
Multiculturalism— Recruiting
beyond the continent of North
America has pervaded college cam
puses. Cal tried its hand in the
game by signing players from
Poland and the Netherlands,
intending to improve on last year's
dismal 2-16 record in the Pac-10.
By all reports, the Golden Bears
have been successful.
Freshman Elke Snijder, from
Roden, Netherlands, sophomore
Patti Czepiec and junior Eliza
Sokolowska, from Krakow and
Warsaw, Poland, respectively, have
noticeably boosted the team.
"Cal has some excellent guards,"
VanDerveer said. "It will be a test of
our guards and perimeter."
Sokolowska, together with
senior Jackie Lear, who played high
school basketball in Gold Coast,
Australia, comprise the starting
guard tandem. The two lead the
team in assists and points and also
pick opposing players' pockets deft
ly. Lear snares 4.4 steals per game
while Sokolowska chips in with 3.9
per game.
Pret-a-Porter— Throughout the
season, Pizza a Go Go has tossed
free pizza to fans that make the
most noise in the student section.
Now from the makers of the
"Sixth-Man Club" comes the "Cap
Club." Free food and prime
reserved seats are available to those
who purchase a Halftime Sports
Cafe/Stanford Women's Basketball
hat.
The beige chapeaux are avail
able in White Plaza and come in
that übiquitous "one size fits all."
