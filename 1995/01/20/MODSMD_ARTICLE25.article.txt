Rematches are tough when the
first meeting was a blowout.
That's the scenario the Stan
ford wrestling team faces against
UC-Davis tomorrow at Burnham
Pavilion in its third Pacific 10
Conference meet of the year.
On Nov. 18, the Cardinal (1-2,
1-1 in the Pac-10) lost only two
matches in its meet against the
Aggies, cruising to a 34-6 victory.
"We weren't nearly as domi
nant as the score indicated," said
head coach Chris Horpel. "A lot of
our matches could have gone
either way. I look for a tough
match."
In the first meeting, four Car
dinal starters stayed out of the
lineup. Junior co-captain Jimmy
Aguirre was sidelined with a neck
injury and junior Tod Surmon
sat out with elbow problems.
Both have returned to competi
tion since winter break to post
impressive results. Aguirre won
the 134-pound division at the
Aggie Open on Jan. 14 and placed
second at the Country Classic
Open on Jan. 18. Surmon placed
second and fourth in the 150-
pound weight class in the same
events.
The Cardinal wrestlers are still
hindered by injuries, however.
Junior 126-pounder Matt Cano
hurt his knee on his way to win
ning the Aggie Open and is ques
tionable for tomorrow night's
