Rematches are tough when the
first meeting was a blowout.
That's the scenario the Stan
ford wrestling team faces against
UC-Davis tomorrow at Burnham
Pavilion in its third Pacific 10
Conference meet of the year.
On Nov. 18, the Cardinal (1-2,
1-1 in the Pac-10) lost only two
matches in its meet against the
Aggies, cruising to a 34-6 victory.
"We weren't nearly as domi
nant as the score indicated," said
head coach Chris Horpel. "A lot of
our matches could have gone
either way. I look for a tough
match."
In the first meeting, four Car
dinal starters stayed out of the
lineup. Junior co-captain Jimmy
Aguirre was sidelined with a neck
injury and junior Tod Surmon
sat out with elbow problems.
Both have returned to competi
tion since winter break to post
impressive results. Aguirre won
the 134-pound division at the
Aggie Open on Jan. 14 and placed
second at the Country Classic
Open on Jan. 18. Surmon placed
second and fourth in the 150-
pound weight class in the same
events.
The Cardinal wrestlers are still
hindered by injuries, however.
Junior 126-pounder Matt Cano

meet. Cano crushed Aggie Todd
Wong, 15-1, in their First meeting
of the year. If he is unable to
wrestle, By Pham will again move
up from his regular 118 lbs. to the

126-pound division.
Junior Sahlan Martin may get
his first start of this season at 167
lbs. If he is unable to compete,
junior Mark Ryzewicz will contin
ue to fill in for Martin.
Injuries, however, will not be
the only problem Stanford will
face on Saturday. The Aggies are
the only UC school with a

wrestling program and feel that
the winner of this match-up is the
best academic wrestling program
in California, according to Horpel.
"They get up for us," Horpel
said. In order to get more fans to
the game, the team will provide
free pizza and soft drinks for all
those who attend the 7:30 p.m.
contest.
