### Courtney Mann Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's tennis
squad will take the final swings of
its extended preseason this week
end at the Pacific 10 Conference's
Women's Lndoor Tennis Tourna
ment in Seattle, Wash.
Despite the fact that this tourna
ment represents the first confer
ence event of the 1994-95 season,
head coach Frank Brennan did not
hesitate to lessen its significance in
the grand scheme of things.
"This still falls under the catego
ry of preliminary tournament —
preseason," he said. "It's still pretty
early. There's not much pressure on
us — we can only do well up there."
The Cardinal'B attack will fea
ture Ail-American sophomore Katie
Schlukebir and freshman Ania
Bleszynski in the first of three
flights. The two will also pair up in
the top flight of the doubles compe
tition. Stanford will then follow
with sophomore Sandra De Silva
and senior Kim Shasby in the sec
ond flight and senior Amy
Chiminello and freshmen Julie
Scott in the third.
"We're looking to keep improv
ing and to see other teams. It's

going to be tough up there," Bren
nan said. He anticipates a high level
of competition as a result of Stan
ford's lower-than-usual tourna
ment seeding^.
Schlukebir received the second
seed in the top flight, sandwiched
between UCLA representatives
Jane Chi and Keri Phebus at No. 1
and No. 3 respectively.
However, Bleszynski was
snubbed for a seed and a favorable
position in the bracket despite cap
turing the Rolex Northwest Region
Women's Tennis Championships in
November, during which she
upended several top seeds from the
Northern California region. Many
of those players received higher
positions for this weekend.
In the second flight, Shasby
appears at No. 3 while Chiminello
garnered the fourth and final seed in
the third flight. In the doubles com
petition, Cal and UCLA received the
two seeds while Schlukebir and
Bleszynski will face the tough com
petition through the flight.
Scott and Chiminello also went
unseeded in the second flight. How
ever, the tournament nominated
Shasby and sophomore two-sport
athlete Emily Burt the top seed in
the third doubles flight.
