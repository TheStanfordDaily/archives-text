### Marc Lee Staff writer 
Former Casa Zapata Resi
dent Fellow Tony Burciaga re
ports that he is "doing well"
after undergoing surgery at
Stanford University Hospital
to remove a malignant gas
trointestinal tumor.
"I feel a veiy miraculous re
covery â€” that they were able to
get everything ... in time," he
said.

Burciaga, now convalescing
at home, had the operation on Dec. 28 to excise
the 10 pound mass less than two weeks after feel
ing a "hard lump" on his stomach upon awaken

ing one morning. Burciaga said he never experi
enced pain from the tumor, making it difficult to
detect earlier.
He saw a physician immediately, and doctors
decided to operate as soon as possible.
"My wife and I let our friends know because it
was time for divine intervention," he explained.
The anesthesiologist for the operation, Chief
Resident Rick Ronquillo, is a long-time friend of
Burciaga. Ronquillo lived in Casa Zapata as a
Stanford undergraduate and worked with Burci
aga and his wife, Cecilia, on various projects with
the house when they later became RFs. He was
also involved with the dorm during his medical
training as an academic advisor for freshmen.
Ronquillo found out about Burciaga's condition
the day before the operation and asked his boss if
he could be involved in Burciaga's operation.

"I have known Tony and Cecilia from a time
when I was very impressionable and anxious
about my future. .. . They were there to support
me," Ronquillo said, explaining the help he re
ceived during difficult times as a premedica] stu
dent. He said he was happy to be able to use his
skills as a physician to "return the favor."
"For me, it was an opportunity to be involved
at a personal and professional level in the care of
a friend, especially given the severity of the situa
tion," said Ronquillo.
During the operation, the surgeon discovered
that Burciaga's condition was better than expect
ed, and he asked Ronquillo to give the news to Ce
cilia Burciaga.
