# Balancing profit and environment
## University struggles to define responsible investment policy 
### Justin Pollard Staff writer 
Jumping to the front of a na
tionwide trend, Stanford Univer
sity has recently made efforts to
ensure that its investments are
environmentally sound.
Since 1992, the University has
carried out a campaign to discover
how ecologically responsible its
holdings are. And with an endow
ment fund of over $3 billion, the
University is one of the largest in
stitutional investors in the coun
try, and its investment policies
may have significant effects on the
environmental policies of many
corporations.
But with such a large portfolio,
it may not be feasible to limit
Stanford's investment universe to
companies that do no environ
mental harm. Indeed, the Univer
sity owns stock in at least four
major companies with poor envi

ronmental records.
Rather than divesting, some
suggest, Stanford might be better
off trying to change the way corpo
rate America operates from with
in. Proponents of environmental
ly responsible investing argue that
it has the potential to dramatical
ly change the existing corporate
culture.
Simply defining environmen
tally responsible investing, how
ever, is no easy task. And accord
ing to Gary Malone — director of
investment responsibility for the
Stanford Management Company,
the private corporation which
handles the University's invest
ments — implementing green in
vesting is even harder.
While Stanford has taken
major strides toward improving
the environmental responsibility
of its investments, Malone said
the University's good intentions
have been hampered by a lack of
credible information about corpo
rations' environmental perfor
mances.
Investing in 'ecocide?'
An investigation into Stanford's
portfolio shows that the University
holds stock in a number of compa
nies with questionable environ
mental track records. Specifically,
the University has invested $7.1
million in DuPont, $10.1 million in
General Electric, $5.3 million in
Texaco, and $3.4 million in Unocal,
all of which have been the targets
of intense criticism from environ
mentalists.
Every year, the Council on Eco
nomic Priorities, a non-profit orga
nization based in New York, releas
es a list of eight to 12 American cor
porations which it considers the
worst environmental offenders.
Texaco has been on that list for
several years, and DuPont and
GE have also been named in
recent years, said Steve Diet,
research director for the council.
All three companies have had
"serious environmental prob
lems" complying with regulations
and have emitted high levels of
pollution, he added.
Unocal and Texaco are current
ly under attack from environmen
tal and human-rights activists
because of their extensive invest
ment in Burma.
Both corporations are involved
in natural gas exploration and
"constructing pipelines and roads
through a rain forest area of
incredible biological diversity,"
which includes the habitat of the
tiger, an endangered species, said
Carol Richards, co-founder of
Burma Forum, a Santa Monica
based non-profit organization.
"Burma is the South Africa of
the 905," said Simon Billenness, a
senior analyst at Franklin
Research and Development — a
socially responsible investment
fund. The government democrati
cally elected in 1990, and led by

Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San
Suu Kyi, was prevented from
assuming power by the ruling mili
tary junta, the State Law and
Order Restoration Council, which
remains in power to this day.
The Burmese military regime's
"environmental and human rights
violations are among the worst on
the planet," said Atosa Soltani,
director of the Tropical Timber
Campaign at Rainforest Action
Network. Texaco and Unocal com
prise over half of the investment of
U.S. companies in Burma, she
said.
"Texaco is one of the particular
ly egregious" corporations invest
ing in Burma, Billenness said.
"Their business disproportionately
benefits the military junta"
because they have regularly paid
the illegitimate government $6
million to $8 million in "contract
signing bonuses," he added.
Richards said her organization
is sponsoring a boycott to protest
Unocal's investment in Burma as
part of a coalition consisting of
Rainforest Action Network, Green
peace, Human Rights Asia
and the Democratic Burmese Stu
dents Association.
Texaco and Unocal are "two cor
porations that we have found in
many cases to be an enemy of the
environment," Soltani said. "These
are corporations who are destroy
ing the planet and undermining
human rights. They are directly
contributing to ecocide and geno
cide. "
Soltani said that Texaco also
had a substantial negative impact
on the Ecuadorian Amazon,
where it drilled for oil for 20 years.
The corporation not only
destroyed immense tracts of pris
tine tropical forest but also left
behind "a huge number of toxic
waste sites" when it pulled out of
the area, she added.
"This is a great opportunity for
students to let their views be
known. It would be great if stu
dents could campaign for Stanford
to divest" from Unocal and Texaco,
Soltani said. "Higher education
should be leading the way for busi
ness to invest in a sustainable and
ethical future."
DuPont and GE have also been

criticized for their poor environ
mental performance.
"In general my impression is
that DuPont is a less-than-honor
able company environmentally,"
said Dan Farber, research manager
for First Affirmative Financial
Network, an environmental mutu
al fund. "They have definite prob
lems with waste sites, have regula
tory problems and are involved
with production of toxic waste," he
said.
GE has also had a lot of prob
lems in the past with hazardous

waste and has one of the highest
rates of toxic chemical emissions in
the country, Farber said. "We
would not consider them an envi
ronmentally responsible corpora
tion," he said.
"GE is a little less concerned
about the whole arena" of environ
mental protection than most other
corporations, said Joel Thomas,
general counsel for National
Wildlife Federation. The corpora
tion has a very small environmen
tal staff, Thomas added.
It's not easy being green
Even though environmental
groups call into question some of
the University's significant invest
ments, Malone said he believes
that Stanford has been a leader in
the field of investment responsibil
ity for nearly 20 years.
The fact that there are compa
nies with poor environmental
records in Stanford's portfolio is
due to inherent problems with try
ing to be an environmentally
responsible investor, he added.
"Investment responsibility has
been around at Stanford since
1977," Malone said. "Stanford was
the first college to put together an
investment responsibility policy."
For many years the main issue
in investment responsibility was

South Africa, but by 1992 it was
"clear that the next big issue would
be the environment," Malone said.
That year, Malone sent an environ
mental survey to 100 companies in
the portfolio, he said. "Given what
we learned from South Africa, we
wanted to be proactive, not reac
tive."
"When we got the question
naires back, we found problems.
Some companies returned the
questionnaire, and some didn't,"
Malone said.
One problem was that there

were different reporting standards
for companies in different loca
tions, depending on which admin
istrative region of the Environ
mental Protection Agency they
were located in, he added. Even
after Stanford filed Freedom of
Information Act requests for each
EPA region there was "no coheren
cy" in the information the Univer
sity received, Malone said.
"The way EPA runs, they want
enforcement to be done through
the states," Malone said. "In Cali
fornia there are much more strin
gent requirements for oil compa
nies, for example, than in
Louisiana," he added.
The bottom line is that it is very
difficult to find a way to rate the
environmental performance of cor
porations, Malone said. Products
are as important as the manufac
turing process. Diaper companies,
for instance, may have sound man
ufacturing processes, but their
product is very wasteful, he said.
With Stanford's large endow
ment, Malone said that building an
environmentally responsible port
folio is no easy task.
"South Africa was easy — either
a company was in South Africa or
wasn't in South Africa," Malone
said. Every company has some
impact on the environment, how

ever, he added.
Stanford looked into "green
funds," but "some said you
couldn't invest in chemical and
petroleum — that takes care of a
lot of huge companies," Malone
said. "If you have a big portfolio,
you might not be able to live with
those criteria."
It is very difficult to compare
small companies to big companies
or compare companies which are in
different industries, he said. Fur
thermore, he questioned how one
can deal with the so-called "dirty
industries."
"The Investment Responsibility
Resource Center [which evaluates
corporate environmental records)
to this day could not give informa
tion to compare an oil company to a
paper company," Malone said.
Corporations often appear to
have good environmental records
when in fact the opposite is true,
Thomas said. "What we've got is a
beauty contest without rules, and
some people are wearing falsies."
Malone said that if any member
of the Stanford community feels
that a corporation in which the
University held stock is environ
mentally irresponsible, they can
bring their complaints to the com
mittees in charge of investment
responsibility and their claims will
be investigated.
There are two committees at
Stanford which deal with these
issues, Malone said. The Advisory
Panel on Investment Responsibili
ty recommends action to the Board
of Trustees' Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility, which
reports directly to the board for
final action.
Planning for a brighter future
Last year, the University signed
on to the Ceres Principles, a set of
ten rules for environmentally
responsible corporate behavior,
Malone said. The list was written
by a Boston-based organization
called the Coalition on Environ
mentally Responsible Economies
(CERES).
To spread this philosophy, Mal
one said, the University will now
vote at corporations' annual meet
ings for shareholder resolutions

which encourage those corpora
tions to endorse the Ceres Princi
ples as well.
This would allow the University
to push environmentally question
able corporations in which Stan
ford invests in a more positive
direction.
While smaller investors are able
to screen out entire industries
from their portfolios, "institutional
investors are going a different
route," said Mike McCloskey,
chairman of the Sierra Club,
"putting their emphasis on reform
ing companies with bad environ
mental records.
"In general the work of a group
like CERES is to try to enlist com
panies to pledge allegiance to this
broad set of principles to commit to
improving their environmental
records," said McCloskey, who is
also on the board of CERES. "It is
not a club for the best performers
— we want to take companies who
need improvement to get them to
improve."
The principles were originally
named the Valdez Principles, after
the infamous Exxon oil tanker
which collided with a rock in Prince
William Sound, Alaska. The list
used to require companies to have
a vice president on environmental
policy and provide information
related to the environment to the
public, Malone said.
While several smaller compa
nies such as Ben and Jerry's signed
on at first, all of the larger compa
nies rejected them, Malone said.
"Companies did not believe that
investors should tell them how to
run their operations."
Eventually, several changes
were made in the Ceres Principles,
after which General Motors signed
on. Soon thereafter, Malone said,
Stanford began to endorse the
principles as well.
"I guess I would consider it a
slight strategic compromise" to
modify the principles to attract the
support of larger corporations, said
Brad Sperber, the coalition pro
grams manager for CERES. But "if
you want to take corporate Ameri
ca from point A to point Z, with a
company like GM, you have to walk
through point B, and point C," and
so on.
