# Fund group races February deadline
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Contributing writer 
Despite a looming Feb. 15 dead
line, the Stanford Fund Committee
is just beginning to move past the
information gathering stage in its
attempt to craft a new policy gov
erning alumni donations.
The committee was created
after students and alumni protest
ed a policy which would allow stu
dent groups to solicit funds only
from alumni who had contributed
at least once in the last five years to
the group. Eventually all money
would be solicited through the De
velopment Office.
Unrestricted donations would
be put into the Stanford Fund
under the control of the University
president and provost.
The plan caused considerable
debate and protest that students
would lose control over much
needed funds and the University
would gain too much power over
the future of student groups. In re

sponse, administrators created a
committee to draft a compromise
policy.
If no new plan is drafted by the
February deadline, then the origi
nal University policy will go into ef
fect.
Committee co-chair Stephen
Peeps, associate vice president for
the Office of Development, said he
is satisfied, however, with the
progress made so far.
"We've done quite a lot," he
said. "Everyone involved is making
a good effort. I'm optimistic that
we will agree on a policy that works
very well."
"We've moved beyond the infor
mation gathering stage and are
now getting down to the policy that
was proposed and the problems we
see with it as students," said
Vanessa Alvarado, the other com
mittee co-chair and a Council of
Presidents member. "We haven't
begun negotiating yet."
Mike Choo, a committee mem
ber and ASSU Senate deputy chair,
described the challenge of the com
mittee as striking a balance
between the "much-needed money
for undergraduate education"
which the Stanford Fund raises
and "allowing student groups the
right to raise the funds they need
to survive and flourish."
Although time is limited, com
mittee members described the peri
od taken for information collecting
as worthwhile.
"There were a lot of things that
we needed to know in order to
come up with good policy recom
mendations," Alvarado said.
"The issues were more complex
than we first realized," Peeps said.
"It takes time for people who have
not paid attention to appreciate the
implications. I'm not discouraged
at all by [where the committee is]."
The information-gathering pro
cess also allowed the student and
staff members of the committee to
become cognizant of each other's
feelings.

"We had the opportunity to
understand the concerns that stu
dents had about the potential
effects on student organizations,"
Peeps said. "We also had the oppor
tunity to explain what the policy
intends to accomplish so that each
side understands each other bet
ter."
All three committee members
were confident that the new policy
would be drafted before the dead
line.
"I don't see any reason why we
can't come up with something by
Feb. 15," Peeps said.
Alvarado vowed to finish "even
if it takes meeting more than once
a week."
"Student leaders are fully cog
nizant of what will happen [if the
deadline isn't metj," Choo said.
"With that recognition, we have
cut out all extraneous discus
sion."
Alvarado admitted that there
was a possibility that the commit
tee might not meet the deadline.
In that case, she said, she would
ask the ASSU for an extension.
"I'm optimistic that they would
grant it since it's not just the stu
dents who couldn't finish, but also
the administrators," she said.
