# Fund group races February deadline
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Contributing writer 
Despite a looming Feb. 15 dead
line, the Stanford Fund Committee
is just beginning to move past the
information gathering stage in its
attempt to craft a new policy gov
erning alumni donations.
The committee was created
after students and alumni protest
ed a policy which would allow stu
dent groups to solicit funds only
from alumni who had contributed
at least once in the last five years to
the group. Eventually all money
would be solicited through the De
velopment Office.
Unrestricted donations would
be put into the Stanford Fund
under the control of the University
president and provost.
The plan caused considerable
debate and protest that students
would lose control over much
needed funds and the University
would gain too much power over
the future of student groups. In re

sponse, administrators created a
committee to draft a compromise
policy.
If no new plan is drafted by the
February deadline, then the origi
nal University policy will go into ef
fect.
Committee co-chair Stephen
Peeps, associate vice president for
the Office of Development, said he
is satisfied, however, with the
progress made so far.
"We've done quite a lot," he
said. "Everyone involved is making
a good effort. I'm optimistic that
we will agree on a policy that works
very well."
"We've moved beyond the infor
mation gathering stage and are
now getting down to the policy that
was proposed and the problems we
see with it as students," said
Vanessa Alvarado, the other com
mittee co-chair and a Council of
Presidents member. "We haven't
begun negotiating yet."
