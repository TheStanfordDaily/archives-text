# Dropping a bomb
## Stanford history prof sparks WWII debate 
### Hussein Kanji Contributing Writer 
Nearly six years after his re
search on the World War II inva
sion into Japan that never was,
History Prof. Barton Bern
stein's conclusions have led to
highly-publicized confronta
tions between the American Le
gion and the Smithsonian Insti
tution.
The Legion called yesterday for
the cancellation of the public ex
hibit of the Enola Gay — the
American plane that was responsi
ble for dropping the atomic bomb
on Japan in 1945 — claiming that
the exhibit was biased and por
trayed the Americans as aggres
sors.
According to Bernstein, who is
on the board of the Smithsonian,
the museum "initially used
scholarship" to determine the
number of casualties that would
have occurred from such an inva
sion.
Bernstein's research on a
World War II commander's con
temporary diary showed that an
invasion would have caused
about 63,000 casualties, instead
of the 229,000 that was originally
believed. The Smithsonian exhib
it was slated to use the smaller

figure.
After political pressure by the
Legion, however, the Smithsonian
retreated and used a higher num
ber in their scripts, Bernstein said.
The Legion was also able to nego
tiate changes line-by-line in the
500-page script.
These actions came under fire
by anti-bomb groups, and the
Smithsonian once again conceded,
lowering the figure this week.
This sparked yesterday's con
troversy, with the American Le
gion appealing to President Clin
ton to shut the exhibit down.
Legion Commander William
M. Detweiler wrote that officials
of the Smithsonian's National
Air and Space Museum insisted
on including "highly debatable
information which calls into
question the morality and mo
tives of President Truman's deci
sion to end World War II quickly
and decisively by using the atom
ic bomb," the Associated Press re
ported.
Smithsonian officials were not
available for comment yesterday
afternoon.
The exhibit of the B-29, would
commemorate the 50th anniver
sary of the bombing of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, which killed nearly
210,000 people.
