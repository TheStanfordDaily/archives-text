# Project Bosnia gains community support
## 
### Jee-Young Shin 
What started out as a humble
effort by concerned citizen
groups in New England took on
nation-wide momentum, with
some help from the Stanford
community.
Two student organizations —
Students for East European De
velopment and Stanford
Amnesty — working closely with
the Palo Alto chapter of Amnesty
International USA, have, to date,
collected and shipped to war-rav
aged Bosnia over 1.3 tons of med
ical supplies.
"The reason that Project
Bosnia could get so big is because
of the Stanford connection," said
Samson Tu, Amnesty member
and research associate at the
School of Medicine.
"Most of the supplies come
from Stanford Hospital," he said.
The hospital's Central and
Home Pharmacy donated more
than $100,000 worth of medical
supplies last year.
Project Bosnia — founded
two years ago in Boston — seeks
to establish a medical pipeline
through which volunteer per
sonnel and equipment can be
regularly sent to provide emer
gency relief to victims of the civil
war.

In a philanthropic effort titled Project Bosnia, members of Students for Eastern European Development
and Stanford Amnesty boxed medical supplies to send to Bosnia yesterday.
"When (the pharmacy] has sur
plus supplies that they're going to
throw away," Tu said, "they call me
and I go there to pick the things
up."
Since surplus medical supplies
cannot be restocked, Project Bosnia
provides a welcome outlet.
"What's interesting is that if
we're getting them from the Stan
ford hospital, what's being done to
the same supplies at other hospi
tals?" said graduate student John
Randazzo, SEED president.
"They're all being thrown out."
Although Amnesty Group 19
[Palo Alto] provided the critical
start-up funding for Project Bosnia,
its mandate does not cover the col
lection and shipment of medical
supplies except in an emergency sit
uation.
Senior Johanna Lasker of Stan
ford Amnesty therefore enlisted the
help of SEED, which had expressed
interest in taking over this relief
project on a more regular basis.
This year, Randazzo projects one
300 to 900 pound shipment per aca

demic quarter.
Once the donations from the
pharmacy have accumulated,
"SEED and Amnesty organize a
sorting party," Tu said. "Volun
teers and usually one or more
physicians help to sort medicines
into different categories."
The boxed supplies are then sent
to AmeriCares, a major relief agen
cy in New Canaan, Conn., for trans
port to the Public Health Ministry
of Bosnia. From there, the ship
ment is flown to the main hospital
in Sarajevo.
"Because it's gone by ship it's
taken awhile, since it has to go
through borders," said Terri Rodel
lo, Group 19 coordinator.
Once the shipment reaches the
main hospital in Sarajevo, however,
Project Bosnia organizers here in
the United States have no control
over its distribution to other clinics.
"A lot of times, in cities where
there's a definite split between the
Christian community and the Mus
lim community, supplies may go
solely to the Christian hospitals,
and not to the Muslim hospitals,"
Randazzo said.
"So far, in all my dealings,
there's been no distinction, [such
asl 'Oh, it can only go to Christians

or it can only go to Muslims,
Rodello said. "They have the need,
and it's been going, and it's been
going well."
Subsequent to the initial fund
ing provided by Group 19, SEED
and Stanford Amnesty — through
fundraisers and dorm donations —
have covered the costs incurred in
shipping the supplies to project
organizers on the East Coast.
"We do get money from the
ASSU," said senior Scott Zimmer
mann of SEED, "but our ASSU
funds have been cut recently
because we're not directly helping
out the Stanford community."
For the time being, sending med
ical supplies is the primary objective
for SEED, but the group is looking
for other potential avenues of assis
tance.
Since SEED has traditionally
focused on sending books to East
ern Europe, shipping donated med
ical textbooks to Bosnia may be the
next viable option.
"We haven't shipped any books
yet. We are definitely looking to
expand though," Zimmermann
said. "We want to send teachers
there this summer, hut it all
depends on whether we can estab
lish the contacts."
