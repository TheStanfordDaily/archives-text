# Project Bosnia gains community support

What started out as a humble
effort by concerned citizen
groups in New England took on
nation-wide momentum, with
some help from the Stanford
community.
Two student organizations —
Students for East European De
velopment and Stanford
Amnesty — working closely with
the Palo Alto chapter of Amnesty
International USA, have, to date,
collected and shipped to war-rav
aged Bosnia over 1.3 tons of med
ical supplies.
"The reason that Project
Bosnia could get so big is because
of the Stanford connection," said
Samson Tu, Amnesty member
and research associate at the
School of Medicine.
"Most of the supplies come
from Stanford Hospital," he said.
The hospital's Central and
Home Pharmacy donated more
than $100,000 worth of medical
supplies last year.
Project Bosnia — founded
two years ago in Boston — seeks
to establish a medical pipeline
through which volunteer per
sonnel and equipment can be
regularly sent to provide emer
gency relief to victims of the civil
war.
