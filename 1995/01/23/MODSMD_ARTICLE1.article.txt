# No longer one-sided...
## New ASSU party forms 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
In response to what members say is a one
sided and inaccessible ASSU Senate, several
senators have formed a new political party.
Four undergraduate senators and two
graduate senators have joined to create the
party — the Students' Alliance — to broaden
the ASSU, said founding member and under
graduate senator Smeeta Ramarathnam.
With six voting senators in the People's Plat
form, currently the only organized party in the
senate, and six in the new Students' Alliance,
eight ASSU senators remain independent.
According to another founding member,
undergraduate senator Steven Russell, Al
liance's first aim is to defeat CA-1, the senate
bill to reform the special-fee process that goes
to the student body for a vote Jan. 25 and 26.
The proposal would eliminate the fee-re
fund system, split undergraduates and gradu
ates into two separate communities for fee vot
ing and collection, and cap the total amount of
fees that can be placed on the ballot, among
other changes.
"The first plan of the new party is to rally
the opposition in this election," Russell said.

"In a lot of ways, people now are involving
themselves in the Students' Alliance out of ab
solute disgust with what they saw happening
with CA-1."
Ramarathnam, however, emphasized that
the party's goals are much broader than mere
ly opposing any individual measure. She said
the Alliance would now "start gathering new
people interested in the same goals we share —
making the ASSU more accessible to a broad
range of students."
Stressing that the new party was formed as
an "alternative" party — not an opposition
party — to the People's Platform, Ramarath
nam said the Alliance hopes to open the
ASSU's doors to a broader student population.
"Right now, students who want to run as a
party-sponsored candidate have only one op
tion," she said, "They need to fit into the mold.
.. of whatever the People's Platform thinks is
important that year. We're just trying to give
people some options."
Though Ramarathnam did vote to place
CA-1 on a special-election ballot, she said that
"it was the only measure on the table. . . and I
think students have a right to choose for them-
selves." She herself supports nei
ther the bill's supporters nor its
opposition.
Undergraduate senators
Michelle Gee and Andre Vanier
and graduate senators Julie Can
tor and Sudarshan Chawathe
joined Ramarathnam and Russell
to form the party.
Looking beyond the special-fee
election, the new party's mem
bers intend to focus on graduate
concerns and Escondido Village;
the students' right to fee refunds;
student groups' right to raise
their own funds; an end to "the
food service monopoly;" and a
more open ASSU, Russell said.
He said the group also plans to
look at business projects in
Tresidder, including making the
"lecture notes" service "larger
and more legitimate and bringing
back the class review publication
that used to be published by the

ASSU."
In addition to working as an
organized force against what it
sees as a too-powerful coalition of
People's Platform senators,
Vanier said, the Alliance will rep
resent more students.
"We are for the student body
and student, as opposed to serv
ing narrow special interest stu
dent groups," he said.
Ramarathnam said the party's
makeup reflects its focus on the
student body. By forming a coali
tion of undergraduate and gradu
ate senators, "we want to make
the party as representative as
possible," she said. "The ASSU is
not just about undergrads."
Ramarathnam said the
promise of more outreach con
vinced her to join the party.
"When I was a freshman and
working with the senate, it
seemed really inaccessible," she
said.
Now, as part of the Alliance,
she said she hopes to let the rest
of the student body know what
the ASSU is. "There's not really

a good mechanism for explaining
what the ASSU does," she
explained.
"Our interest is in making the
Students' Alliance the strongest
party it can be," Russell said. The
party plans to run a COP slate in
the elections for next year and
build coalitions of senators and
students.
"The bottom line is, whatever
it takes to get students more
involved in and more excited
about the ASSU, that's what
we're going to do," Russell added.
Russell is optimistic about the
new party, which he said spent a
long time in the idea stage before
becoming a reality.
"This is something that people
have been talking about for a
long time," Russell explained.
"CA-1 might just have been the
straw that broke the camel's
back. "
"We're all really excited about
it,"he said. "I think it's going to
be a great success. It may be just
the kind of kick in the rear the
ASSU needs."
