# No longer one-sided...
## New ASSU party forms 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
In response to what members say is a one
sided and inaccessible ASSU Senate, several
senators have formed a new political party.
Four undergraduate senators and two
graduate senators have joined to create the
party — the Students' Alliance — to broaden
the ASSU, said founding member and under
graduate senator Smeeta Ramarathnam.
With six voting senators in the People's Plat
form, currently the only organized party in the
senate, and six in the new Students' Alliance,
eight ASSU senators remain independent.
According to another founding member,
undergraduate senator Steven Russell, Al
liance's first aim is to defeat CA-1, the senate
bill to reform the special-fee process that goes
to the student body for a vote Jan. 25 and 26.
The proposal would eliminate the fee-re
fund system, split undergraduates and gradu
ates into two separate communities for fee vot
ing and collection, and cap the total amount of
fees that can be placed on the ballot, among
other changes.

the opposition in this election," Russell said.

"In a lot of ways, people now are involving
themselves in the Students' Alliance out of ab

Ramarathnam, however, emphasized that
the party's goals are much broader than mere

the Alliance would now "start gathering new
people interested in the same goals we share —
making the ASSU more accessible to a broad
range of students."
Stressing that the new party was formed as
an "alternative" party — not an opposition
party — to the People's Platform, Ramarath
nam said the Alliance hopes to open the
ASSU's doors to a broader student population.
"Right now, students who want to run as a
party-sponsored candidate have only one op
tion," she said, "They need to fit into the mold.
.. of whatever the People's Platform thinks is
important that year. We're just trying to give
people some options."
Though Ramarathnam did vote to place
CA-1 on a special-election ballot, she said that
"it was the only measure on the table. . . and I
think students have a right to choose for them-
