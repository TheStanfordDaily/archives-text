BEIT LID JUNCTION, Israel
(AP) — A suicide mission by Islam
ic militants near a snack bar
mobbed with soldiers killed 19
Israelis and wounded about 60 yes
terday with a gruesome new tactic
— igniting a small blast and
ambushing would-be rescuers with
a second explosion.
The result was a hammer blow to
the Israel-PLO peace treaty, already
reeling from an unprecedented
series of attacks inside Israel.
President Ezer Weizman pro
posed that Israel stop the peace

talks for an extended review before
expanding Palestinian self-rule into
the West Bank. The president has
little power but is looked to as an
indicator of the national mood in
times of crisis.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
convened an emergency Cabinet
session yesterday evening to deter
mine the government's response.
The first step was a complete clo
sure of the occupied territories,
blocking the movement of all Pales
tinians into Israel. It has been the
response after each similar attack

and has kept tens of thousands of
Palestinians away from jobs in
Israel.
The Cabinet also froze any
future release of Palestinian prison
ers and the opening of a passage
between the PLO-ruled areas of
Jericho and Gaza.
Rabin underscored the deepen
ing concern about such carnage by
making his first personal inspection
tour of a suicide bombing site.
"There is no doubt in my mind
that this action now is another
attempt by the extreme Islamic ter

ror groups to achieve their dual goal
of killing Israelis and halting the
peace process," he said.
Hecklers at the scene shouted,
"How much longer?" while Rabin
toured the devastated site sur
rounded by jittery bodyguards.
Hundreds of Israelis demon
strated in Jerusalem and at the site
of the bombing to protest the attack,
shouting "Death to Arabs." About
100 police on horseback used water
cannons to disperse about 200
demonstraters at a shopping mall
near the blast site.
