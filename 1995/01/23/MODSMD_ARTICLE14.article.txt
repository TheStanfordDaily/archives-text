# Stress, frustration engulf Japanese

KOBE, Japan (AP) — Signs of
psychological stress, frustration,
and a breakdown in the social
order for which Japanese society
is renowned emerged yesterday
among the thousands of sur
vivors of Japan's deadliest quake
in over seven decades. The death
toll neared 5,000.
At the Kansai Rosai Hospital
in nearby Amagasaki, doctors
said many patients were having
difficulty breathing at night — a
symptom doctors said is common
among those suffering delayed
stress syndrome.
"The people think we'll have
another big quake," taxi driver

Yoshikazu Morimoto said. "Most
are very afraid another big one
will come. Many people are leav
ing, and many of them have lost
their jobs" because businesses
were destroyed.
For the first time, merchants
are complaining about thefts,
and yesterday many of them
organized a neighborhood watch
system to guard against night
time pilfering from their shops.
Five days after the 7.2-magni
tude quake, Japanese national
police said the death toll had
risen to 4,936 with 171 still miss
ing. Nearly 26,000 have been
injured.
