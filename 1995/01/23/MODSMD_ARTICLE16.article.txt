## Editorials Late notice on vote 
### 
Students will vote this
week on a proposed amend
ment to the ASSU Constitu
tion that, if passed, will have a pro
found impact on students who pay
ASSU fees and the student organi
zations who receive them.
Unfortunately, the ASSU seems
to have waited until the last minute
to publicize details on how to vote.
Only now — just days before the
election — are elections handbooks
being made available. Indeed, for
the past week, the only sign that
there would be an election at all
were a few scattered campaign
signs.
Meanwhile, the ASSU is prepar
ing to inaugurate a new World Wide
Web voting system that, though
perhaps easier to use than last
year's UNIX system, is unfamiliar
to most voters. And last-minute
debates are being held to help
inform students of the issues

involved. But many students, faced
with course work, job searches and
other obligations, will likely turn a
blind eye to these llth-hour
attempts at getting them concerned
and involved.
The ASSU Elections Commis
sion is not at fault for the delay in
organizing the election; due to some
Keystone Kops hi-jinks in the ASSU
Senate, it wasn't even clear that
there would even would be a special
election until Jan. 10. The Elections
Commission has done an admirable
job given this tight schedule.
In the future, however, the ASSU
should make sure there is enough
time before an election to mount
effective publicity and education
efforts. If, as in this case, the pro
cess is tied up by unforeseen compli
cations, the ASSU should suspend
its actions until a later date so every
student has an opportunity to make
an informed decision.
