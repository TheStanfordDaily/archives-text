# No shelter for mice
## 
### 
The recent down
pours have caused every
one on campus to seek
shelter from the wetness —
including mice. While students
can be found cowering under
umbrellas, bundled in water
proof jackets and boots, the
furry creatures who reside in the
usually dry Lagunita lake bed
have taken refuge in Lambda
Nu, a house adjacent to the lake.
Mice have been sighted on both
floors, making some residents
wary of even falling asleep in
fear of waking up face to face
with an unwelcome rodent guest.
Given that students in Lamb
da Nu pay the same amount as
any other dorm resident for
room and board, Facilities has an
obligation to maintain a reason
able level of safety and sanita
tion in each house. This includes
anticipating these kinds of prob
lems in advance instead of look

ing for a quick fix after the dam
age is already done.
In this case, the University
should have anticipated prob
lems with mice entering the
house in a time of heavy rains
and made the repairs necessary
to block their paths. Now, the
mice have already invaded. Facil
ities deserves praise for reacting
quickly to the situation and set
ting traps, b-ut such efforts
woxiid lre v if they
worked to actively prevent such
problems.
A costly inconvenience for the
University and an extra worry
for students, the incident in
Lambda Nu is an example of an
avoidable problem requiring
only a bit of foresight in order to
be fixed at its root. Anticipating
such problems in residences is
definitely worth the thought and
the effort — before students
hear a squeak in the night.
