Proposed reform contradicts ideal of voluntary funding

THE "BALANCED FUNDING
DEAL" is as genuine a title for the
proposed ASSU constitutional
amendment as "Save Our State" was for
Proposition 187. The BFD is simply an
attempt by the student government to
eliminate our fundamental right to allo
cate our money as we see fit. Under the
current proposal, students will be coerced
into financing causes they do not support.
Most of us were against Proposition
187, and many campus groups (including
our student government) vocally opposed
it. That was an engagement in political

action, a right campus groups should
have and will continue to have, if they
are funded voluntarily. If the amend
ment is interpreted strictly, such groups
would be denied that right. If it is inter
preted loosely, we shall quickly slide
down a dangerous slope into the vague
realm of what is political and what is
not: although we may not see what is
wrong with students being forced to fund
action against Proposition 187, what if
certain campus groups came out in favor
of 187?
Apparently there is a "conscientious

objector" clause which permits students
to petition the senate if they morally
object to funding a certain cause, provid
ed that they write an essay for each
group. This petition is then either
approved or denied by the student gov
ernment. Why should the "conscientious
objector" be forced to endure a subjective
test and bureaucratic ordeal in order to
obtain what is rightfully hers in the first
place? Is the student government so
responsible and the student body so irre
sponsible?
The amendment involves two parts:

the abolition of the right to a refund and
the separation of graduate and under
graduate students. These two issues
should be separate, for the current
amendment exploits the separatist senti
ments of graduate students in order to
forcibly extract $135 plus annually from
each undergraduate.
For some of us, $135 is a substantial
amount of money. We should continue to
have the right to decide if and how it is to
be distributed.

Carville address was entertaining but lacked substance

James Carville is nothing if not an
entertaining speaker. Halfway through
his list of ways to know whether you're
a country bumpkin ("when your porch
falls and it kills more than three
dogs"), the guy sitting next to me spec
ulated that David Letterman must
have been his speech writer. He really
was funny.
After a few minutes of joking,
Carville changed his tone to suggest that
the meat of the speech would be forth
coming. The meat turned out to be a
surprisingly Rush Limbaugh-esque
stream of malevolent characterizations
of prominent Republican politicians,
mixed with polemical anticonservative

rhetoric.
According to Carville, the conserva
tive agenda consists of making economic
war on the poor and taking away our
children's library books — all in the
interest of giving the rich a $40 tax
break. Democrats, on the other hand,
care about the downtrodden and fight to
make America a better place for every
one. His political analysis, though deliv
ered with great energy, went little fur
ther than this.
During the question-and-answer peri
od after Carville's speech, people asked
if he would go any further than criticiz
ing Republicans and making jokes.
Would he offer a constructive vision

of how his hopes for America's future
might be realized? To my disappoint
ment, the answer was basically no.
Carville acknowledged that construc
tive ideas are important, but he
explained that his job is just to get peo
ple elected. The way to do that, as his
undeniable successes show, is to sling
mud and spout optimistic platitudes. He
explained that the "seven-second sound
bite," which is the main tool of his trade,
permits nothing deeper.
Some would suggest that I am unrea
sonable to ask anything more from a
political strategist. But I did expect
more. I had presumed that the sound
bite was just the tip of the policy iceberg;

surely our leaders and their advisers
would have more to say if given the
opportunity.
But Wednesday night, Carville had an
opportunity to overcome the mass
media's limitations and back up his
bluster with the reasoning that one
would hope underlies his positions. Yet
all we got was more of the Washington
soundtrack.
Carville either has nothing useful to
say and is merely a charismatic mouth
piece, or he held back and didn't give us
our money's worth.
