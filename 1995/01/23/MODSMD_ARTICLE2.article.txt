# Platform senators say new party not so new

The emergence of a second party in
ASSU politics will not deter the People's
Platform from pursuing its goals, mem
bers stressed.
Though not all Platform senators
have learned of the plans of the newly cre
ated Students' Alliance party, Deputy
Senate Chair Mike Choo said he feels the
new party will have difficulty establish
ing itself as a permanent fixture in the
ASSU Senate.
"I feel that the reason the Platform
has been around such a long time ... is
because it is not reactionary," he said,
adding that others are short-lived be
cause they are responding to a specific
issue.
Even so, undergraduate senator Jerry
Chen said he would like to find out "what
the Alliance is standing for" before mak
ing a judgment about it's goals.
But Choo said he believes the Alliance
is a "coalition opposed to the Balanced
Funding Deal" and "not really a
party."
In addition, he said that the
Alliance will likely have difficulty
coming together to work for the
students.
"There's politics and public pol
icy," Choo said. "The People's Plat
form is not always doing the glam
orous grandstanding â€” it's much
easier to be a minority party that's
grandstanding and obstructing"
than to work for students.
COP member Mork Murdock
said that he will be interested to
see the issues the new party
addresses. "We're already work
ing on so many different student
issues and it's midway through
the year," he said. "If they're

ready to put in the time to benefit
students, I'm interested."
However, Murdock noted that
the group forming the party has
spent much of the year in opposi
tion to proposals put forward by
other senators.
"We've been doing a lot of posi
tive things this year.... They've
been against a lot of positive
things for the student body," he
said. "I think that their struggle
will be to propose things for the
student body."
Though Murdock said it is pos
sible that the Alliance is more than
a reaction to the special-fee reform
bill recently passed by the senate,
Choo said he believes that in order
to really establish itself, a second
party would need to go further.
"The only reason a second
party can have a lasting impact is
if it's a conservative party," he
said.
