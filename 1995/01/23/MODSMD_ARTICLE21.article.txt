## Pølp Fiktion in København 
### 
After spending winter
break in Europe, I decided to
drop by Copenhagen on the way
back to Stanford.
Copenhagen in the winter has many
advantages. It's not very crowded.
There aren't any tourists. One need
not worry about packing sunscreen.
And flights back to the United States
are decidedly less expensive than from
the more southerly regions.
What does one do in Copenhagen,
alone, if one arrives on an overnight
train in the morning and departs the
same day in the evening? A blitz walk
ing tour took me to the City Hall,
through one of the largest pedestrian
shopping zones in Europe, into a mod
ern art museum in a remodeled church
unexpectedly featuring an exhibit of
stuffed Labrador puppies, past the
Changing of the Guards at the Royal
Palace, into the spectacular museum
erected in memory of the local sculptor
Thorvaldsen and filled to the brim
with nude Greek goddesses and more
formally clothed Christian saints, then
finally to the climax of the tour, the
inconspicuous statue of the Little Mer
maid from Hans Christian Andersen's
fairy tale, stripped of the appropriately
placed, ostensibly G-rated seashells of
the Disney version.
By now the barely risen sun had set
and the temperature had plunged to a
level considerably below what Califor
nians would call comfortable. After

nearly depleting my supply of Danish
crowns by indulging in local pastry and
Manhattan pizza, and after witnessing
a shopkeeper screaming "politi!" at the
top of her lungs wrestle with a young
woman who had allegedly stolen a fur
coat from her store, I decided to spend
the remaining hours before my train
left in the warmth of a movie theater.
The Palladio Cinema, tucked away
inside a glitzy shopping mall, offered
an eclectic variety of shows, including
"The Lion King" and "Sirens," both
dubbed in Danish, and "Pulp Fiction,"
showing in the original English version
with Danish subtitles. Skeptical of the
prospect of hearing James Earl Jones
sound like the Swedish chef, and
resisting the temptation of watching
Elle Macpherson prance around nogen
and practice all sorts of other unpro
nounceable things with other people's
wives, I settled on "Pulp Fiction."
Going to a movie in a foreign coun
try is a rather unique sociological expe
rience. Scores of predominantly blond
couples nestled into their comfy,
assigned seats, and then watched in
dumbfounded awe as the towering
Samuel Jackson, of distinctively non-
Scandinavian origin, struck down upon
his enemies with a vengeance. The dis
comfort of the Danes grew visibly
stronger with every scene of violence,
drug abuse and even body-piercing
that flashed across the screen. Neither
did the audience quite seem to appreci

ate the Tarantinan dark humor and
volleys of expletives that laced the orig
inal dialogue but didn't quite make it
into the subtitles.
Only when Bruce Willis and his cute
but empty-headed femme bete engaged
in mundtlig fornojelse did the audience
breathe a heavy collective sigh of relief.
Oh, sex! (A word almost universally
left unchanged.) Yes, sex we can identi
fy with. Another brief moment of titil
lation came when Uma Thurman, in a
dancing tribute to both Raggedy Ann
and Madonna, seductively entreated
John Travolta to make her a woman
soon, but no sooner had this interna
tional theme of seksualitet begun than
it careened into the more typically
American world of drug overdose and
violent crime. The brief resonance the
romantic interludes had found with
the audience had completely died away
by the time the two white pricks raped
the black man. Definitely not this kind
of sex.
This was clearly not a movie about a
couple holding up a restaurant, or a
woman stealing a fur coat, for that
matter. Leaving the theater with the
confused Danes, I realized that
although Manhattan pizza and Cheese
burger Royale had made it around the
world, some things obviously had not.

Jonathan Huston is trying real hard to
be the shepherd.
