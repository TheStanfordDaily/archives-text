## Lady hoops rely on defense, depth to pommel Bears

The Stanford women's basket
ball team can win in so many differ
ent ways.
From the outside, senior Kate
Paye, junior Bobbie Kelsey and
sophomore Kate Starbird can del
uge a team with a storm of threes.
From the inside, the power and
finesse of senior Anita Kaplan and
the posse of freshmen control the
paint. And the defense is especially
stifling, with the Cardinal (14-1, 5-0
in the Pacific 10 Conference) hold
ing its last 10 opponents to 65
points or less.
On Friday, Stanford used a com
bination of all three along with the
one consistent advantage the Cardi
nal has had all year to defeat Cali
fornia (6-8, 1-4) 99-65 in front of a
national television audience.
Depth helped Stanford overcome
a 16-minute lull to outplay the
Golden Bears and increase the Car
dinal's winning streak to 12 games.
"I thought our team played a
very good second half," said coach
Tara VanDerveer. "Again our
depth was a real key. Our defense
really turned it around in the sec
ond half."
Stanford went on a 28-4 run
after the intermission, keyed by a
couple of steals transforming a six
point lead into a certified blowout.
The apex of the streak came when

Starbird made ESPN's highlight
film with driving lay-ups while
assisted by freshman Kristen Folkl.
With 11 minutes and 41 seconds
to go in the game, Folkl tossed a full
court pass to a flying Starbird who
beat the Cal defenders for the easy
basket. Deja vu occurred 28 seconds
later as Folkl brought the crowd to
its feet with an almost exact replica
of the previous play.
"Starbird went between the legs,
behind her back, it was all of her
full-court moves rolled up in one,"
VanDerveer said. "I hope [her] play
gets on Sports Center."
Starbird again led the team with
21 points, 16 of them in the second
half as she took control of the game
and put it out of reach. During the
streak, Starbird made a lay-up off of
freshman Olympia Scott's steal, a
couple of jumpers, a steal and lay
up, the two Folkl touchdown plays
and yet another steal and lay-up.
However, Starbird was not the
night's only star. Scott also lit up
the court while the Stanford bench
helped keep the pressure on Cal.
"We had a lot of contributions
from different people," VanDerveer
said.
Scott was a major force in the
paint, especially on the offensive
glass, blocking three shots and
grabbing a career-high 12
rebounds, seven of them offensive.
"Scott played good defense, got
some rebounds and really got going
in the second half," VanDerveer
said.
She completed the double double
by scoring 13 points, cleaning up
underneath by following up Cardi

nal misses. Other players of note
were senior Rachel Hemmer,
sophomore Jamila Wideman and
freshmen Folkl, Heather Owen
and Naomi Mulitauaopele.
"Heather had a nice second
half," VanDerveer said. "She had

a nice touch on her shots."
Owen came off the bench to
score 10 points, and Hemmer
missed a double double by one
rebound while racking up 10
points. Mulitauaopele chipped in
eight on four-for-five shooting
while Wideman and Folkl added
seven and six points respectively.
"A lot of [Stanford's] points
came from their bench, and
almost all of ours came from our
starters," said Cal guard Jackie

Lear. "That always hurts a
team."
Lear scored 15 points for the
Golden Bears while playing a
game-high 37 minutes. Eliza
Sokolowska led Cal in scoring,
rebounding and assists by scoring
21, although on five-for-15 shoot
ing, grabbing 6 rebounds and
dishing out 5 assists.
The game accentuated Cal's
schizophrenic playing style. The
Bears took an early 4-0 lead

before Stanford went on a 18-0
run to go up by 14 with just under
six minutes gone in the game.
Cal fought back and threat
ened late by shrinking the lead to
three with two minutes to go in
the first half. Stanford brought
the margin back to six at the end
of the half, 40-34, and the rest is
history.
"We gave it a good shot in the
first half," said Cal coach Gooch
Foster. "We're capable of playing

some good basketball but we need
to sustain that level of play."
The Cardinal will attempt to
add to its winning streak on
Thursday when UCLA travels to
Maples Pavilion. Expect to con
tinue seeing minutes being spread
around.
"We have a real special group
of players who are putting the
team first," VanDerveer said.
"That kind of unselfishness can
get the team going."
