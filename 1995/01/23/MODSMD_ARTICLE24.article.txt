## Gymnasts lose first of season; bright spots in vault and bars 
### Ben Hur Contributing writer 
Sprains, strains and traveling
pains took their toll on the Stan
ford women's gymnastics team
this weekend.
Competing in its first meet
away from friendly Burnham
Pavilion, the Cardinal suffered its
first loss of the season Friday
night to Cal State-Fullerton.
Fatigued and banged up, Stan
ford finished second to UCLA but
beat UC-Santa Barbara in Satur

day night's tri-meet.
The Cardinal squad began the
meet against Fullerton poorly and
never quite recovered, losing to
the Titans 191.225 to 186.900.
"We started off with some falls
on bars and we never got any
momentum going," said sopho
more Katie Jennings.
The evening in general proved
to be mediocre. "We were just
kind of average all night," said
coach Breck Greenwood. "We

were pretty flat and uninspired."
However, the Stanford gym
nasts pulled themselves together
on Saturday, hitting their first
few routines and scoring a 47.975
on the vault, only .05 from the
school record. This feat appears
amazing considering that the
squad's top vaulter, senior Jen 6
Elzie, was limited to competing
on the bars due to injury.
"It was maybe some of our best
vaulting ever, even without

Jen£," Greenwood said. "It just
goes to show our depth."
The Cardinal also redeemed
itself on bars, hitting five of six
routines.
"We looked real good (on bars)
— we were competing with a lot
of energy," Greenwood said.
From there, things started to
turn sour. Extremely tight judg
ing on the floor seemed to drain a
little life out of Stanford. Coupled
with the fatigue that comes with
competing two consecutive days
on the road, the Cardinal nearly
collapsed on the beam.
"Everybody was a little ner
vous because of the low score we

got on the floor," said freshman
Keri Monahan. "We were also
pretty worn down by then."
Competing away from home
also seemed to have an effect on
the Stanford squad.
"We definitely miss our home
crowd," Jennings said. "It puts us
at a little disadvantage to compete
on the road, especially because
our team really feeds off it."
This weekend also marked the
first time that Stanford's four
freshmen were faced with oppos
ing fans.
"It is definitely different com
peting in someone else's house,"
said freshman Misty Moore.

While the fans may have
slightly intimidated the Stanford
gymnasts, they expressed overall
satisfaction with their perfor
mance considering the fact that
both Elzie and Jennings saw only
limited action because of injuries.
The vaulting of sophomores
Amy Paris and Ariel Passanisi
definitely provided bright spots
during the weekend as they both
competed on the event for the
first time this season.
"Vaulting has always been our
Achille's heel," Greenwood said.
"But with Ariel, Amy and Jen 6,
we're going to be the vaulting
team we've always wanted to be."
