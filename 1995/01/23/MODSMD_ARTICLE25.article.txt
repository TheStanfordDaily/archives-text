# Olympia's awesome
## Scott has an attitude that turns up the heat and keeps it coming 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
The California women's basket
ball team's backcourt has become
known as the "Robin Hood" back
court, alluding to the guards' ability
to make steals and then give the ball
up for assists.
However, the tandem of Jackie
Lear and Eliza Sokolowska proba
bly was a bit too generous in Fri
day's game against Stanford, as
they personally gave up the ball 10
times to Cardinal defenders in the
99-65 Cardinal win.
Stanford, who shot a sub-par 42
percent from the field in the first
half, relied on the tough, in-your
face defense that has guided it all
year to wear down a feisty Bear
squad. As a team, the Cardinal
forced 21 turnovers, blocked six
shots, held Cal to 38 percent shoot
ing and out-rebounded the Bears by
20. This type of defense is what
head coach Tara VanDerveer
believes will keep the Cardinal
rolling.
"Defense is always something
you can depend on," said Van-
Derveer, "especially when you have
a low shooting percentage."
As good as the Cardinal defense
was, the team seemed to add a new
facet to its game â€” attitude. And
most of that attitude was provided
by freshman Olympia Scott, whose
emotion and intensity seemed to
infect all of the Cardinal defenders.
Scott, who finished with 13
points, 12 rebounds and three
blocked shots, took only four min
utes to announce to everyone at
Maples Pavilion that it was Stan
ford's house and that the lane was
her room.
At the 15-minute mark of the
first half, Sokolowska took the ball
strongly to the hoop to make what
looked like to be an easy runner in

the lane. However, as the ball left
the guard's hands, a screaming
Scott interjected to soundly swat
the ball away.
"Intimidation has a lot to do with
it," said Scott on why she screamed
as she rejected Sokolowska. "I just
want to make [the other team]
think twice about bringing the ball
in the lane. I also want them to
know that when I block their shots,
it's no accident."
Scott seemed to be everywhere in
the first half. The freshman had
two blocks, seven rebounds, and
seemed to cause two or three other
turnovers in the first half alone.
With the Cardinal only ahead by
six points at the half, Scott took it
upon herself to pump her team
mates up again.
Stanford started the second half
with a 13-4 run ignited by the Car
dinal's star offensive player Kate
Starbird. Cal coach Gooch Foster
waited for the television timeout
instead of burning one of her own,
and that's when Scott went in for
the kill.
Right before the timeout, Scott
made another powerful rejection
that woke the crowd up. As the
teams went to their benches, Scott
walked through center court wav
ing her arms and rallying the crowd.
It was clear that Cal had lost any
chance of winning by that point,
and it looked as if Scott wanted to
take them on by herself.
"Olympia is really exciting and
really intense," said Starbird, who
scored a team-high 21 points. "Her
attitude can be contagious and can
bring a lot to the entire team when
she's being vocal and exciting us.
When we get down, her attitude
picks us up."
Scott now recognizes her role on
the team and seems to relish it."I
think I'm the emotional lead
er," she said. "Sometimes in
warmups my teammates will
say 'Come on Olympia, give us
what we need,' and I try to get
them excited and ready to
play."
