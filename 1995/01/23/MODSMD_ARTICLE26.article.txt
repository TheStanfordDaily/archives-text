Stanford 169 vs. All 106
Stanford 160 vs. ASU 83

The Cardinal men's swimming team opened
its Pacific 10 Conference season in the desert this
weekend, traveling to Arizona to take on the
Wildcats in Tucson on Friday and the Sun Devils
in Tempe on Saturday. As they had expected, the
swimmers began their conference season with
two convincing wins despite facing the possibility
of a letdown after a big victory last week.
"Coming off an emotional win last week
against Michigan, our main focus was to see some

consistency in our times," said head coach Skip
Kenney.
And there was certainly no letdown. Swim
ming consistently, third-ranked Stanford dunked
the No. 7 Wildcats 169-106 on Saturday, winning
11 of 15 events.
"At Arizona we had the typical beautiful
weather, which gave us a chance to be a little
more motivated and swim well," Kenney said.
The sun certainly shone on the Cardinal, as
senior Kurt Grote won both the 100- and 200-
yard breaststroke, and Stanford posted a 1-2-3
against the Wildcats in the 200-yard freestyle and
the 200-yard butterfly.
Cardinal individual winners included Grote,
Sabir Muhammad (100-yard fly), Matt Martin
(100-yard backstroke), Scott Gagner (200-yard
free), Joe Hudepohl (50-yard free), Clay Tippins

(200-yard fly), James Edwards (lm diving), Tom
Wilkens (400-yard EM) and Scott Claypool (100-
yard free).
Arizona's sole double event winner was Chad
Carvin (500- and 1000-yard free), an American
record holder in the 500-yard free.
"One thing Stanford is known for across the
nation is that we are an excellent traveling
team," Kenney said. "There is no team that trav
els as well as we do, and we take a lot of pride in
that."
On Saturday the Cardinal continued its apti
tude on the road, leaving the Sun Devils in its
wake 160-83 by virtue of winning 10 of the 13
events. Despite more California-like weather in
Tempe, and the difficulty of a second day in a row
on the road, Stanford showed
why it is among the top teams in
the nation.
"We swam some different
events, and let guys swim some
of their off events, to get a
chance to relax a little and swim
some other things they might
enjoy," Kenney said.
The Cardinal took the top
three honors in the 200-yard
Individual Medley, while indi
vidual winners included Kevin
Radvany (1000-yard free),
Hudepohl (200-yard free),
Wilkens (200-yard IM), Matt
Thomson (200-yard back), Dan
Kanner (500-yard free), Grote
(200-yard breast), Edwards (lm
dive) and David Johns (3m
dive).

"This weekend didn't really
mean a lot as far as the season.
We wanted to go in and swim
hard and come home with the
victory," Tippins said. "Coming
off last week's emotional win,
we just wanted to race and win.
By and large I thought our per
formance was solid, but not
spectacular."
Kenney also noted that a win
does not denote perfection.
"Sixty to 70 percent of our
team performed well by men
tally and physically preparing,"
he said. "A small part of the
team relaxed a little too hard.
But overall we're still swim
ming well. We've gained a lot of
confidence over the last two
weeks, and will hopefully keep
building up for the Pac-lOs in
March."
The Cardinal takes a
breather next weekend and then
will host UCSB and rival USC
Feb. 3 and 4 at deGuerre Pool.
