After dominating just about everyone in the UC-
Santa Barbara Tournament over the weekend, the
No. 2 Stanford men's volleyball team finally suc
cumbed to BYU in the tournament finals, 15-7,15-
12, 3-15,15-13.
Not even ranked in the top five at the beginning
of the season, the Cougars dominated all of the top
rated teams with easy victories over No. 1 UCLA,
No. 3 USC and Pepperdine before facing the Cardi
nal in Saturday's championship match.
Stanford also coursed
through its competition with
convincing victories over host
UCSB, 15-7, 15-4, and No. 5 Cal
State Northridge, 15-12, 15-17,
15-8. After going undefeated in
the second round of play, the
Cardinal clinched its champi
onship match spot with a handy
15-5, 15-2 victory over Sacra
mento State.
"We schooled everybody up
until the finals," said sopho

more middle blocker Michael
Hoefer.
Against BYU, however, the
stakes were raised and the game
format was also changed.
Instead of playing best-two-out
of-three like the rest of the
tournament, the championship
match was best-three-out-of
five and counted as an official
NCAA contest on their respec
tive records.
Powered by the momentum
they gained against UCLA and
USC, the Cougars came out fir
ing in the first two games.
Behind the quick sets of All-
Tournament player Jesse Gant,

BYU jumped to an early lead
and never looked back.
"It was a battle all the way,"
said sophomore opposite hitter
Matt Fuerbringer. "Both teams
played some tremendous volley
ball and I think we were pretty
evenly matched."

It was a battle all
the way'

Despite close scores in the
first two games, however, Stan
ford found itself trying to avoid
the three-game sweep. Coming
out of the second game with a
renewed sense of urgency, the
Cardinal put together a domi
nating game and steamrolled
BYU, 15-3, thus forcing a
fourth game. Hitting above
.700, Stanford controlled every
aspect of that game while BYU
began to falter a little.
Both teams then entered the
fourth, and eventually, decisive
contest at the top of their
games.
"That last game was the best
volleyball I've seen in a while,"
Fuerbringer said. "It was flaw
less on both sides, and I was
really surprised to see it this
early in the season."
With constant lead changes
throughout the contest, no
team gained control of the game
until the score was knotted at
13-all. Fighting back from a 13-
11 deficit earlier, Stanford exe
cuted playbook-perfect volley
ball and denied the Cougars on
14 consecutive side-outs. Dur
ing those 14 rotations, the Car
dinal also inched its way back
into contest by putting two
more points up on the board.
On point 14, both teams sus
tained a long rally until Cardi
nal Stewart Chong set Fuer
bringer for what seemed to be a
side-out kill. On the other side
of the net, however, BYU made
an amazing highlight-reel dig
and barely lofted the ball back
over the net again.
Staring in disbelief at his
rejected kill-attempt, Fuer
bringer went up the ladder
again and this time slammed
the ball out of reach for good.
Side-out, Stanford.
However, while he was hit
ting the ball, Fuerbringer's left
leg grazed the bottom of the net

for a violation. Point, BYU.
"That was definitely a fluke
play," Fuerbringer said. "I've
never seen anything like that
happen before and it was a
tough break for us."
The Cougars then sealed
their victory by blocking Fuer
bringer on match point.
"That was a really close
match overall, and it could have
gone either way," Hoefer said.
"The loss is definitely a disap
pointment, but the good thing
is that we're still going to
improve."
In only the second week of its
season, Stanford has already
established itself as a team that
is chock-full of All-American
talent, as witnessed by the play
of Fuerbringer, Mike Lambert
and Chong in the BYU match.
Hitting an impressive .412 as
a team, Stanford was bolstered
by a 34-kill and .562-hitting
performance by swing hitter
Lambert, who was selected to
the All-Tournament team.
That, coupled with Fuer
bringer's 28 kills, made both
teams virtually indistinguish
able on offense (BYU also fin
ished the match hitting .412).
Rookie setter Chong also
turned some heads this week
end with a 71-assist effort and
10 digs on defense to lead all
players.
Chong was joined on the All-
Tournament squad by his
Cougar counterpart, Gant, who
also netted 71 assists, in addi
tion to six blocks. Kevin Ham
bly and Scott Larkin rounded
out the Cougar selections.
UCLA's Kevin Chong and Santa
Barbara's Donnie Harris were
the other honorees.
"We played at a much higher
level than we did during last
week's win against Rutgers,"
said head coach Ruben Nieves.
"With the talent on this team,
we're going to improve tremen
dously as the season progresses,
but as of now, we're right there
and right in the hunt.
"This tournament basically
told us that (No. 11 UCLA can be
beaten, and even though UCLA
is still favored as the champi
onship team, BYU and Stanford
also fit that description."
Next week, the Cardinal will
host unranked UC-Santa Cruz
on Friday and last year's NCAA
champions Penn State on Sat
urday.
