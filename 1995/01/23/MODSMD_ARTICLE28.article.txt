"Relaxed."
That was the way senior Jenny
Thompson described the Stanford
women's swimming and diving team's
two dual meets this past weekend.
After squeaking by second-ranked
Michigan 150-146 a week earlier at
deGuerre pool, the Cardinal traveled to

the Grand Canyon state to take in the
view as the top-ranked team in the land.
Stanford returned to the Farm with
easy victories over Pacific 10 Confer
ence rivals Arizona and Arizona State.
The No. 8 Wildcats did not provide
the competition that head coach
Richard Quick thought they might in
falling to the Cardinal 183-102 Friday in
Tucson.
"Arizona has a chance to finish in the
top five at the NCAAs this year, but we
stacked up well against them in our dual
meet and didn't allow them much of an
opportunity to put a scare into us,"
Quick said.

Although Arizona's Ashley Tappin, a
teammate of Thompson's in the 1992
Olympics, won the 100- and 200-yard
freestyle and the 100-yard butterfly, the
Wildcats did not have the depth to
match the Cardinal event for event.
While winning nine of the 15 races,
Stanford placed at least two swimmers
in the top four places in every event.
Thompson and fellow senior Eileen
Richetelli lead the Cardinal to the easy
win by recording double victories —
Thompson in the 50-yard free and 100-
yard breaststroke, and Richetelli in the
one-meter and three-meter diving.
Other swimmers to win on Friday
included senior co-captains Kendra
Thayer and Becky Crowe in the
400-yard individual medley and
200-yard fly, respectively, and
juniors Jessica Tong in the 100-
yard backstroke, Tammy Shannon
in the 200-yard back and Jane Skill
man in the 500-yard free.
"The meet result was never real
ly in doubt," Crowe said. "It would
have been easy to focus on getting a
tan down there — it was such beau
tiful weather."
The Cardinal brought its relaxed
attitude to Tempe on Saturday to
tangle with the No. 13 Sun Devils
with a result was almost identical to
Friday's — this one beinga 184-114
victory.
Similar to the Arizona squad,
Arizona State could muster only
one weapon which might harm the
Cardinal in reigning NCAA 100-
yard breaststroke champion Beata
Kaszubda. While Kaszubda cruised
to easy victories in the 100- and
200-yard breast, the Sun Devils did
not possess a team balanced enough
to compete with the three-time
defending NCAA champions.
Besides surprising victories from
-Jennifer Cnota, who upset AlOOll-

American RichetelLi in both the
one-meter and three-meter diving,
and the 400-yard medley relay
team, ASU did not see the victory
stand.
Thompson showed her Olympic
form in winning three events on the
day — the 100-yard back, 100-yard
free and 200-yard IM — while
Crowe (100-yard fly), Tong (200-
yard free), senior Julie Kole (200-
yard fly), junior Maureen McLaren
(200-yard back), sophomores Clau
dia Franco (50-yard free) and Sarah
Anderson (1000-yard free) and
freshman Amy Oberhelman (500-
yard free) were all victorious.
"I am especially ple<ised with the
performances of Julie and Amy,"
Quick said. "They swam tremen
dous races to win their events."
Quick was also impressed with
freshman Lindsay Gassner's 50-
and 100-yard free swims over the
weekend. "Although she didn't win
[she raced against the likes of Tap
pin, Thompson and Franco), she
showed great improvement. I look
forward to her continued growth
this season."
The Cardinal will hit the pool
this week in preparation for UCLA
and USC this coming weekend.
"The Arizona trip was a good one,
said Crowe, "because we got to see
where we are at this point in the
season and what areas we need to
work on. The [third-rankedj Tn>
jans are not going to be easy, to say
the least."
