Dominated. That's what the Stanford
wrestling team did against an undermanned
UC-Davis team Saturday at Burnham Pavil
ion as it crushed the Aggies 40-7 and
improved its record to 2-1 in the Pacific 10
Conference and 2-2 overall.
"We had a good match," said junior Tod
Surmon. "The guys came out and wrestled
well."
Davis jumped out to a quick start, winning
the first two matches. Aggie senior Mike San
tos defeated 118-pound junior Brian Mcßeth,
9-4, in the night's first bout. In the 126-lbs.
match, sophomore By Pham filled in for
injured junior Matt Cano. Although he was
able to fight his way out of a pin in the first

round, Pham eventually lost to Aggie senior
Paul Gilman, 14-5.
"We knew our tough matches were 118
and 126," said junior co-captain Jimmy
Aguirre.
But those matches would be the only
bright spots for Davis. Coming in, the Aggies
were decimated by injuries and had to forfeit
three of their matches, handing the Cardinal
18 points before anyone had broken a sweat.
Then the onslaught began. Freshman
Robert Hatta, who was filling in for senior co
captain Jay Jackson, pummeled Aggie 134-
pounder Matt Dick, 21-6, earning a technical
fall. Hatta was competing in his first dual
meet at Stanford. Jackson irritated his neck
at the end of last week but should be back

this weekend.
"It was good to see Hatta wrestle
and wrestle well," Aguirre said.
In the 142-pound bout, the
Aggies forfeited but Aguirre still
wrestled in an exhibition match. He
crushed his Davis foe, 24-3. Sur
mon followed in the 150-pound divi
sion with another impressive per
formance, pinning Aggie freshman
Mike Santos with eight seconds left
in the second round which gave the
Cardinal a 16-7 lead.

In the 167-pound match, junior
Sahlan Martin shut out his oppo
nent, freshman Jason Mair, 7-0.
This was Martin's second competi
tion of the year and his first dual
meet.
"Martin competed well, consid
ering how much he's wrestled,"
said head coach Chris Horpel. "He's
going to be very good."
The night finished with sopho
more Roger Liu conquering 177-
pound freshman Nick Knight, 16-9,
and heavyweight freshman Mark
Neglay beating Aggie David Yuan,
10-3. Davis forfeited the 158-pound
and 190-pound bouts along with
the 142-pound match.
