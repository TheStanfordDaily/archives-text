# Changes for Berlin option
## Intern program will now aim at two quarter stays 
### Hussein Kanji Contributing Writer 
Despite its enormous success last year, the Krupp
Internship Program will undergo a number of
changes in 1996, said Overseas Studies Director Rus
sell Berman.
The Krupp Internship program, in its 13th year,
places students in jobs in the German industry, public
sector and cultural institutions.
According to Berman, as of next year, the intern
ship program will "begin giving preference to students
who are prepared to commit to two-quarter intern
ships and students who have studied for more than
one quarter in Berlin."
Last year for the first time the program allowed
single-quarter summer internships and experienced
great popularity, placing the highest number of in
terns in the program's history.
Next year, however, requirements will be much
more restrictive.
"While [last year's program] was very good, and
sometimes very successful," there are companies that
dislike summer-only internships,
Berman said.
Many of the companies who
participate in the exchange,
including Mercedes, BMW and
Seamans, have expressed consid
erable interest in having the
interns stay longer.
"Therefore, students should
give serious consideration to com
mitting to two-quarter intern
ships," Berman said.
Although students who are
planning to stay in Berlin will
have a distinct advantage, the
program won't be entirely restric
tive. However, one-quarter or
summer-only internships will
occur "in a limited number nf
cases," Berman said.

There will also be a trend,
Berman said, "to have an awful
lot of internships in former East
Germany." Currently, nearly 40
percent of the Stanford interns
have taken up jobs in that region.
According to Berman, students
working in the former East Ger
many through the Krupp Intern
ship program are some of the first
Americans ever to work there.
In addition to internships cur
rently available in Berlin and
Kyoto, the Department of Over
seas Studies will offer internships
for the first time in Moscow. Stu
dents will be able to take jobs with
both Western and Russian corpo
rations, in either technical or
public sector positions, Berman
said.
The department, however, is
still working on determining the
details of the Moscow internship
program, he said.
