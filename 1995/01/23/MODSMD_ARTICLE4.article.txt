## Police arrest East-West fans 
### September Trevi√±o Staff writer 
Stanford Police arrested four rowdy fans at the East-
West Shrine football game, held Jan. 14 at Stanford Sta
dium, after an attempt to escort the men out of the sta
dium escalated into a brawl with Stanford officers.
"It was a real ugly fight," said Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer.
Two Stanford Deputy Sheriffs and a special events se
curity guard were injured in the scuffle. One deputy was
punched in the jaw, while the other received only a minor
finger cut. The security guard suffered a severely twist
ed knee.
The fight broke out in the concourse area when police
tried to remove the fans from the stadium after receiving
reports that the group was loud, disorderly and violating
the stadium's alcohol-free policy, Niemeyer said.
Stanford Police filed the case with the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's Office toward the end of last
week. The names of the four men cannot be released
since the case is pending review by the district attorney's
office.
While the police only arrested four of the attackers,
there were about 10 to 15 people in the unruly group,
Niemeyer said. During the scuffle, the rowdy fans
grabbed the gun belts and batons of the peace officers.
"They've been known to cause trouble in the past,"
Niemeyer said. Other football fans seated near the group
reportedly thanked police for removing the unruly fans
and said that they have exhibited vociferous behavior in
past years.
Pending review by the district attorney, the four may
face charges of felonious assault and battery of a peace
officer and resisting arrest.
