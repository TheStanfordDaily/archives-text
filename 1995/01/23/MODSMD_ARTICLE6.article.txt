# Little ire raised at Med Fac Sen
## Cost-cutting tenure plan packs meeting 
### Arnold Ceballos Contributing writer 
Proposed changes to the meth
ods of granting tenure to School of
Medicine faculty received their first
public airing as over 50 people
packed into Friday's Medical
School Faculty Senate meeting.
The capacity crowd heard Med
ical School Dean David Korn deliv
er a 45-minute explanation of the
dire need for the changes, which
would delay by up to five years the
granting of a limited number of
tenure slots to some professors in
clinical departments.
With the Medical School recent
ly operating under significant
deficits, Korn said the proposal is
needed "to try to reach some kind of
financial equilibrium."
Korn's proposal met with little
criticism, although some present
expressed concern that such revi
sions may prove a disincentive to
young people wishing to pursue a
career as a physician-scientist.
In addition, Dr. King Li, a
tenure-track radiology professor,
criticized the lack of details in the
proposal, asking if, as it applied to
him, there would be a grandfather
clause for the changes.
Korn replied that there would be
such a clause for any faculty
presently on a tenure-track.
Though reassured, Li also point-

Ed to the cooperation among junior
faculty and warned that the "cli
mate won't be as healthy" in the fu
ture as faculty compete for the lim
ited number of tenured positions.
Even so, Korn stressed the im
portance of the proposal. "We need
to bring expenses into line with
drastically reduced income expecta
tions," he said, adding that the plan
amounts to a "right-sizing of the
faculty."
The school is trying to reduce the
number of billets, or funded posi
tions for tenured professors, in the
face of declining income and a
changed health care environment,
Korn said.
"Historically there was no real
plan for how many billets there
should be," he said. "It was based
on an enormous availability of re
sources. But that's changed. It isn't
like that any more."
Pointing out that some other
prestigious medical schools do not
have tenure at all, or have minimal
tenure bases of $25,000 to $35,000,
Korn said "dozens of hours" of
thought went into the decision re
garding Stanford's proposed re
form.
Arguing that an elimination of
tenure would not be a popular
move, Korn said the proposed solu
tion is "quite respectable ... and
protects the integrity of the
tenure-track positions."
This compromise came at a
price though, which was a limit on
the number of positions that would
be allowed. The result, says Korn,
is a reduction in the number of bil
lets and a cap in each department
on the number of billets.
This will create a pyramidal syß

tem which delays the time to
tenure but still gives faculty the
opportunity to receive tenure,
according to Korn.
The key is that the proposal no
longer allows for unlimited billets,
though Korn added that the Medi
cal School can still bring in tenure
line people in the future if
resources become available.
The plan was submitted to the
University president and provost,
who Korn says are "supportive."
The report will go to the full Facul
ty Senate later this year.
