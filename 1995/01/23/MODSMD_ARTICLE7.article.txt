Opponents of the Balanced
Funding Deal, or CA-1, questioned
the proposed benefits of the amend
ment to the ASSU Constitution last
night in a panel debate at Rains
House.
Speaking before a sparse crowd,
graduate student Sandeep Singhal
said the students could not afford to
second guess the motives of those
who supported the amendment.
"Safeguards will be stripped if
this amendment passes, [the stu
dents'] right to refund their fees
will be eliminated and the process
for requesting a refund on moral
grounds greatly complicated,"
Singhal said.
Graduate student Tom Costello
said the amendment would "benefit
mostly special interest groups" with
loopholes created by the bill, allow
ing groups to procure funding with
out having to justify their budgets.
Supporters of the amendment
defended the benefits the proposed
it would bring. They said the prob
lems of the current system increase

the costs of providing services to
students and do not represent the
diverse interests of the undergradu
ate and graduate student popula
tions.
"The (amendment) would make
the system fairer and more stable
by splitting the votes between the
graduate and undergraduate popu
lation," said Karen Seta, co-chair of
the Graduate Student Tea Party.
Seta said the splitting of votes
into two separate bodies would in
sure that the needs and priorities of
both groups are better served. By
separating the two, services would
be paid for by those who use them
most.
In addition, changes in the way
Stanford groups obtain funding
would save money by eliminating
budget inflation and the refund
buffer, Seta said.
The amendment caps the
amount the senate can place for a
vote on the ballot, counts reserves
and unused funds as part of a
group's next annual budget and
eliminates the fee refund system.
