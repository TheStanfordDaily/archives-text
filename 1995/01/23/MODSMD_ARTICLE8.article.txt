# Prof creates new software ratings

### Kyung Lee 
Now, because of a new computer software rating
system — designed with the help of communication
professor Donald Roberts — the discriminating con
sumer can check the package of "Reader Rabbit" to
make sure that it's not too graphic for his five-year
old daughter.
Since last October, a rating system from the Recre
ational Software Advisory Council has informed com
puter software consumers about the level of violence,
nudity/sex and profanity in a program.
"We interviewed many people to create this sys
tem, and we discovered that violence to one person
isn't violence to another," Roberts said.
Consequently, this five-level rating system pre
sents the meaning of the rating, not just the rating.
"Some people might say that it's much worse to
punch a woman than a man, but the rating system
says that it's equally bad," he said.
Computer packages will display this five-level rat
ing system as a thermometer. A temperature level 1
means that the software contains slightly objection
able material, like language referring to body func-

tions. Level 2 software has exple
tives and non-sexual body refer
ences, and level 3 has obscene lan
guage and gestures. At level 4, the
software has explicit sexual lan
guage and references to inter
course or genitalia, while the high
est level, the "all" level, specifies
that the software is inappropriate
for all audiences.
Information like this allows
computer software publishers to
understand why their software
receives a particular rating. It also
allows consumers to voice their
complaints.
"We made the rating system
public so that if there's a lot of crit
icism, then the committee can
meet again and change it," Roberts
said. "It even has an '800' number
for this reason."
As Karen Crowther, president
of the computer software publisher
Redwood Gaines, said that "the
RSAC is wholly open to the public.
Developed by hundreds of people
and observed by thousands, it's a
public organization.
"Even you could propose a
change to it," she added.
Ratings are not mandatory for

computer software publishers, but
definite economic incentive await
those who have their software
rated.
"Large retailers like Toys 'R' Us
and WalMart are requiring these
ratingß to market software on their
shelves," Roberts said.
To receive ratings, software
publishers fill out standardized
content questionnaires. Honest
answers result in the chance to
market software in large retailers,
and dishonest ones result in signif
icant fines.
The RSAC, consisting of nine
board members, oversees this
monitoring of the questionnaires.
Only four of the board members
can be a part of the software indus
try. The other five members, like
Roberts and a Harvard pediatri
cian, represent the public, not the
industry.
Roberts, who had always been
concerned about the impact of vio
lence on children, said the video
game issue became a "natural
interest."
"There's a catharsis hypothesis
— if you're angry, go punch a
punching bag 10 times, and you'll
feel better," Roberta said. "Some
believe that this applies to video
games, too; press a button to see
someone get punched and feel bet
ter."

"This may be true, but I think
the greater danger is that in video
games, you get rewarded for being
violent — and lots of research
proves that reward for behavior is
later repeated," he added.
With these and other ideas,
Roberts gave a testimony at Con
gressman Tom Lantos's Video
Game Legislation Symposium in
May.
"The video game industry,
though, just wasn't listening,"
Roberts said.
One person who did listen,
though, was Crowther.
"I asked all the congressmen
who I should contact about a rat
ing system, and they all agreed
that Professor Roberts was the
one," Crowther said.
Roberts, believing that the first
meeting was a one-time affair,
showed up. But his depth and
scope of ideas resulted in a long
term one.
"They said, 'Wow, would you
take some time and work with
us?'" Roberts said.
Roberts worked on it during the
summer and introduced it in Octo
ber. He said it is too early to project
sales and much of the consumers'
reactions. He also admitted that
the rating system can't monitor all
computer software publishers.
"For every large computer soft

ware publisher, there are 500 indi
viduals who make computer games
in their bedrooms and send them
through the Internet," Roberts said.
Roberts said that "Doom," a
game notorious for its violence,
started this way. "People got it for
free on the Internet, and then had
the chance to buy the next 17 lev
els," Roberts said.
So far, some have criticized the
lack of an age rating. But as
Crowther pointed out, "The mzyor
ity of consumers are adults, so age
ratings are useless."
Other consumers, like those on
Compuserve and On-Line, also
prefer no age rating.
"We want consumers to read
the labels and determine for them
selves whether the software is
appropriate," Roberts said.
Steven Balkam, executive direc
tor of RSAC, said, "It gives con
sumers objective, non-judgmental,
content-based labels — it's revolu
tionary."
Computer Gaming World maga
zine has already urged all game
publishers to consider the rating
system. And foreign nations like
Canada and Sweden are also dis
covering the system's benefits.
"The rating system has
immense implications for other
media like virtual reality and tele
vision," Balkam said.
