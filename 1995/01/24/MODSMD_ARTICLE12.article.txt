## Trial opens with new evidence 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Murder
defendant O J. Simpson asked yesterday
for a one-minute audience before his
jurors, a stunning twist to a day dominat
ed by attorneys scrapping fiercely over
last-minute evidence the defense dumped
on prosecutors.
Defense attorneys surprised the prose
cution with a list of 34 new witnesses and
a videotape of police walking through
blood at the murder scene. They also
offered evidence of an alibi for the first
time â€” a witness who says she saw Simp
son's white Ford Bronco outside his home
at a time when the prosecution alleges he
was two miles away killing his ex-wife and
her friend.
Simpson's attorneys additionally sug
gested in court papers that police may
have moved the Bronco as well as the
bloody glove that matched one found near

the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and
Ronald Goldman last June.
Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark
called the new evidence "trial by ambush"
and said she was "absolutely shocked" by
the last-minute disclosure. "This is a will
ful desire to deprive the people of a fair
trial," she said.
Her colleague, William Hodgman,
asked for a week's continuance to study
the new evidence and witness list, which
includes actress Tawny Kitaen, local TV
reporter Tracie Savage, Los Angeles
Police Chief Willie Williams and author
Lawrence Schiller, who is writing Simp
son's book.
"The truth, or part of the truth, has
been hidden from us by the defense,"
Hodgman said.
Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr.
responded with equal indignation.

"I am absolutely appalled that the
prosecution comes here and says they are
unprepared," he said. "They see a few
charts from us and become frightened and
want to run away and hide for a week."
Superior Court Judge Lance Ito was
tense during the exchange, interrupting
attorneys at times to say, "You're wasting
my time" and "Do you expect me to
believe that?"
The defense attorneys' new disclosures
showed how vigorously they plan to chal
lenge the prosecution's physical evidence.
A newsreel videotape obtained by the
defense shows police officers walking
through blood while the bodies lie nearby
under sheets.
Defense lawyers say the blood was so
contaminated by the foot traffic that sub
sequent DNA tests on it would be mean
ingless.
