## Islamic extremists' attacks push discussions on defense boundary 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Stunned, embit
tered and enraged, Israel buried more young
soldiers yesterday than it had in any single
day over the past decade.
The government grappled with how best
to deal with 52 deaths the past four months
at the hands of Islamic extremists, including
19 in Sunday's suicide bombing.
In a rare televised address, Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin said clear boundaries must be
drawn between the Jewish state and Pales
tinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
"We want to reach a division between us
and you. We do not want the majority of the

Jewish population, 98 percent of whom live
inside sovereign Israel and united
Jerusalem, to be vulnerable to terrorism," he
said.
"We will divide between us and you and
not according to the basis of the pre-1967
borders," Rabin said.
Television reports said the government
was weighing a security defense border
between Israel and the West Bank, under
Israeli military rule since the 1967 Arab-
Israeli war. Rabin said a frontier heavily
patrolled by soldiers and police could be
established within months.
