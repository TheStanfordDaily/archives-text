# Russians close in
## Victory against Chechen rebels appears imminent 
### 
GROZNY, Russia (AP) -
Ghostly figures in a thick fog,
Russian troops blasted
Chechen rebels with tank and
artillery fire yesterday and
slowly consolidated their grip
on the center of the battered
Chechen capital.
The Russians, stationed on
the western shore of Grozny's
Sunzha River, appeared
increasingly confident, and
sent crews in armored person
nel carriers to dig through the
snow to collect their dead.
A French photographer who
emerged from central Grozny
yesterday reported that some
Russian soldiers stopped fight
ing occasionally to loot, taking
typewriters, clocks, slide pro
jectors and anything else they
could carry.
Chechen rebels, however,
continued to freely roam east
and south of the river, and
claimed to have retaken some
territory. They also control
suburbs in the southwest.
"There are a lot of buildings
in the center that change land
lords every day," said Akhiyad
Izhiyev, a 50-year-old Chechen
battalion commander and a
former lieutenant colonel in
the Soviet army.
Four weeks into the battle
for the capital, neither side

owned central Grozny, and
snipers remained active.
"Nobody controls the cen
ter," said Izhiyev, outfitted in
a white winter camouflage suit
and black knit cap. "The more
troops the Russians send here,
the more corpses they will
leave."
The bodies of dozens, per
haps hundreds, of Russian sol
diers killed over the past
month have lain on the streets
of central Grozny, particularly
around the presidential palace.
Now the Russians are col
lecting the bodies and taking
them to an outdoor morgue at
Lenin Park, said Luc Delahaye,
a photographer for the Mag
num agency. He spent several
days with the Russians before
leaving yesterday.
He said the Russians were
slowly flushing the rebels out
of buildings on the Russian
side of the river.
"The Russian tactic is to
shell heavily and then advance
with infantry," Delahaye said.
"When they get there, the
Chechens are gone."
Russian artillery has been
active outside of Grozny as
well, pounding the towns of
Argun and Gudermes and the
village of Bamut in recent
days.
