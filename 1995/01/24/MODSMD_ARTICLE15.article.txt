# Quake aftermath
## Examination of widespread building damage begins 
### 
KOBE, Japan (AP) — For Yoshihiro
Takeuchi, the shattered landscape hit by
last Tuesday's massive temblor is now a
laboratory that contains specimens of
everything he has studied.
Wooden and concrete buildings lay in
piles of rubble. Others tilt at impossible
angles. Elevated highways and overpasses
collapsed.
Japan thought it was ready for a major
quake. It wasn't ready for this.
"The human brain has a limit, but
nature doesn't," said Takeuchi, chairman
of the Earthquake Damage Investigation
Committee for the Japan Institute of
Architecture.
For Takeuchi, an engineering profes
sor at Osaka Institute of Technology, the
destruction from the magnitude 7.2
earthquake is familiar ground — except

for one phenomenon rarely spotted in his
visits to quake sites in Japan and else
where.
"The characteristic of this quake is the
middle floors of buildings collapsing," he
told The Associated Press on Sunday dur
ing a tour of some of Kobe's worst-hit
areas. "In past quake histoiy, we haven't
seen this before.. .except for a few isolat
ed examples."
The Sakura Bank building lost its
fourth floor; the old city building its sixth.
Part of the fifth floor of Nishishimi Hos
pital, in another neighborhood, collapsed.
In each case, there seemed to be little
other structural damage; it was like a
sandwich from which one slice of meat
disappeared.
Takeuchi theorized that this quake
simultaneously thrust upward and side

ways, hence the wide cracks in sidewalks
and the shift upward or downward of
some buildings by two feet or more.
This motion also may have doomed
some of the highways, which had been
such a source of pride for Japanese engi
neers. After interstates were toppled in
California quakes, they bragged that such
a thing couldn't happen here.
"All the people saying that have
received a shock," Takeuchi said.
Japan has different construction stan
dards for highways and buildings. The
huge pillars supporting raised roads con
sist of concrete cores surrounded by verti
cal steel rods that are then wrapped with
vertical steel hoops and surrounded by
another coat of concrete.
In Kobe, many ruptured, the reinforc
ing rods snapped like matchsticks.
