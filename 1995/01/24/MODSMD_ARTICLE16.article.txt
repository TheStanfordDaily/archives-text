Thousands march
WASHINGTON (AP) - Thousands
of anti-abortion protesters marched
from the White House to the Supreme
Court on Monday, chanting prayers,
shouting slogans and waving white
crosses in an annual protest against the
1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing
abortion.
"Rejoice, rejoice — my mom was not
pro-choice," many shouted as they
walked along downtown Washington
streets on a cloudy, chilly afternoon.
"Abortion is not and never will be
respectable," march organizer Nellie
Gray, president of March for Life Inc.,
said at an hourlong rally in a grassy
park just south of the White House. "No
one has the right to murder with
impunity."
After an hour's walk to the Supreme
Court, hundreds of people knelt on the
court's steps to pray as police in riot
gear looked on. A black-and-white
poster of an aborted fetus was propped
up nearby.
U.S. Park Police estimated the crowd
at 45,000; Gray put the number at
100,000. Last year, about 35,000 people
braved an ice storm to march against
abortion.
Some demonstrators blocked traffic
and later 39 protesters were arrested
after blocking one of the doors of the
Department of Health and Human Ser
vices building to demonstrate against

fetal tissue research.
Political woes continue
MEXICO CITY (AP) - President
Ernesto Zedillo grappled yesterday with
his latest political headache, reshuffling
the Cabinet after forcing the education
secretary to resign for lying about having
a doctoral degree.
Political problems in Mexico's restive
south simmered as well. The opposition in
Tabasco state continued to press for the
removal of the ruling party governor they
claim took office through fraud.
Leaders of the ruling Institutional Rev
olutionary Party in Tabasco said they sup
port a referendum asking voters if they
want new elections. But the opposition
said it would not back the referendum
unless Gov. Roberto Madrazo resigns, say
ing he should play no role in determining
his political future.
"We will accept the plebiscite once
Madrazo is gone,"' said federal Sen.
Auldrico Hernandez Geronimo, a member
of the leftist Democratic Revolution
Party. Hernandez was roughed up last
week by PRI members who blocked high
ways to protest rumors that the central
government would force Madrazo to step
down.
The political problems have aggravated
economic woes. The Mexican peso has lost
almost 40 percent of its value since Dec.
20, and the stock market has been a roller
coaster in recent weeks, going up and
down — mostly down.
