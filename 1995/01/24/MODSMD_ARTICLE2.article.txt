# Planning Black History Month
## Organizers seek more funds, may scale back events 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
Black Liberation Month organizers are strug
gling to raise funds in the wake of the Black Stu
dent Union's loss of its special fee during last
spring's ASSU election.
Traditionally, the majority of the Month's
funding has come from the BSU, but this year or
ganizers are attempting to cover the budget
shortfall by requesting funds from various cam
pus organizations and individuals.
These groups —- including the Black Commu
nity Services Center, the Speakers' Bureau, the

Dean of Students, the Haas Center for Public
Service and the ASSU — have been solicited in
the past for Black Liberation Month.
But this year, many of these organizations
have their own budgetary dilemmas, due to Uni
versity streamlining.
Explaining that the quality of programming is
contingent on the number of dollars available,
Tina Gridiron, one of four student organizers,
said the issue is not whether the groups will do
nate, but how much.
"There's an urgency to see how many in the
community are willing to support Stanford's

ford tradition —

viding financial
support?'

commitment to Black History
Month," said Gridiron, a master's
student in education. "Is this
really part of the Stanford tradi
tion — are people willing to say
this is valuable by providing
financial support?"
The budget for this year's
Black Liberation Month, to be
held in February, is significantly
less at $8,000 rather than the

usual working figure of about
$14,000, said Blair Bowman,
interim director of the BCSC.
So far the Black Liberation
Month committee has secured
about half the amount needed,
and it will solidify the budget
when responses to the funding
requests begin trickling in, hope
fully by the end of this week.
Formerly, student groups
interested in organizing a pro
gram for the Month came to the
BSU for funding, but without
that option fewer student groups
have volunteered to sponsor

events, Gridiron said.
Therefore, programming will
be focused on a handful of tradi
tional events such as the Gospel
Extravaganza, the Soul Food Din
ner and the main program, which
usually features a speaker.
Still, next month's events will
aim to provide a "full and rich"
month for the entire community,
Gridiron said.
The amount of funding will
regulate the quality of program
ming as well. For example, the
main program could merely fea
ture a speaker, or it might include

an additional component such as
a reception, Gridiron said.
Although some events may
have to be scaled down, organiz
ers are not planning to charge for
attendance, Bowman said.
Formalized several years ago
through students' initiative,
Black Liberation Month is Stan
ford's expression for the nation
wide Black History Month, Grid
iron said.
However, she added, a precur
sor to Black Liberation Month
had been celebrated on campus
since 1926.
