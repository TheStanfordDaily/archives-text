## Editorial Not this fee reform 
### 
Voters should reject the
misguided reform of the
Balanced Funding Deal

LATER THIS WEEK, students
will make a decision that could
have profound effects on stu
dent fees and the organizations that
rely on those fees. On Wednesday
and Thursday, students will vote on
the Balanced Funding Deal, a pro
posed amendment to the ASSU
Constitution which would revamp
the entire special-fee system.
The initiative contains three
main elements. It would eliminate
fee refunds, limit the amount of stu
dent group fees the ASSU Senate
could place on the ballot and split
graduates and undergraduates into
two separate voting communities.
Under the plan, students would
be able to get money back from par
ticular events, but only by writing a
letter "conscientiously objecting" to
each event. Religious or partisan
political activities would also be pro
hibited from receiving any funding
through the fee system.
Any proposal for change might
seem alluring given the status quo:
right now, students can — and do —
get their money back from groups
they don't wish to support, gradu
ates and undergraduates pay rough
ly equal amounts for unequal bene
fits and student organizations face
extreme difficulties in gaining
enough support and funding.
The BFD is certainly an
admirable attempt at improving the
special-fee system. It is the only
solution on the table. However, it,
too, contains serious flaws that
make it an unacceptable solution.
Students should vote to reject it in
this week's special election.
The proposed division of the
graduate and undergraduate fee
systems would help free graduate
students from unnecessary and
irrelevant fees, and eliminating
refunds would make it easier for

groups to budget their resources.
But to protect undergraduates from
the skyrocketing fees that would
undoubtedly result from such an
arrangement, the BFD proposes a
cap on the amount of fees the senate
can place on the ballot.
The BFD outlines no plans for
enforcing the cap; such details
would be left to the senate. Most
likely the senate would work with
each individual group to decrease
the amounts of some or all fee
requests in order to bring the total
beneath the cap. In extreme cases,
the senate might even be able to
remove some groups from the bal
lot. Such measures would be
unavoidable if the number of groups
requesting fees ever increases
beyond its current level.
This arrangement would give the
senate the power and responsibility
to set priorities among deserving
groups and within groups' budgets.
Decisions like these are better left
respectively to the voters and to the
groups themselves. But under the
BFD, those most directly affected by
the fund process would be left with
the least say in how the funds are
spent.
Groups could bypass the senate
by collecting petitions, but under
the BFD such a group would need
approval from 60 percent of voters
to receive fees rather than the usual
50 percent. In addition, a notation
would appear on the ballot that that
group bypassed the senate — a scar
let letter that would punish groups
who disapproved of how the senate
meted out the capped funds.
These and other provisions of the
so-called Balanced Funding Deal
must be considered seriously. The
current fee system is in dire need of
replacement, but desperation
shouldn't force us to accept a solu
tion that will simply introduce a
greater set of brand-new problems.
By voting no on the Balanced Fund
ing Deal Wednesday and Thursday,
students can prevent a student
group funding disaster and get their
student government back on track
crafting an acceptable reform plan.
