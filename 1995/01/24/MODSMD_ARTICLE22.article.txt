## The 						not-so-superhighway 
### 
AS I LISTLESSLY flipped through
Lane Library's meager newspaper
selection one afternoon last week, a
terse editorial headline unexpectedly
grabbed my attention. "Power is Infor
mation," the sound bite professed, and
several hundred words of explanation fol
lowed. The basic idea was an unimagina
tive and familiar one: Our society has
been subject to an electronic revolution,
where those who have access to the most
up-to-date and privileged factoids have
one up on the next guy and are more like
ly to succeed. The argument reads as if
we were selecting for a gene for informa
tion-gathering prowess.
What disturbs me most about this line
of reasoning is not so much its painfully
twisted logic as its mass appeal to the cur
rent public. Fact is, the American con
sumer orgy has been expanded to include
information-gorging. We are rarely con
cerned about the reliability, pertinence or
quality of our information, but we are
obsessed with its quantity.
Even if we could select for the fanciful
gene for ultimate information gathering,
it is clear that we have little talent for
information processing to complement
that trait. Volumes of information are
only as good as our ability to filter
through them in order to find the tidbits
that are actually valuable. Regrettably,
we are losing ground in the latter regard;
time spent "zapping" through hundreds
of television channels or "surfing the
Net" does nothing for our analytical abil

ities. We spend more and more time bom
barded with random quotes and images
and less time exploring a single concept
in its entirety. The information revolu
tion has above all promoted a passive
audience whose former quest for knowl
edge has been replaced by a factoid,
sound-bite sponge.
If anything, the information explosion
has decreased power for the majority of
us. We may pat ourselves on the back for
our weekly perusal of quick-fix info such
as Newsweek, but the majority of what
we've read is either money-hungry adver
tisements for something useless or politi
cally motivated stories reflecting the
interests of big-money media. Even if one
is in the minority which is actually com
mitted to good information, for every
decent new publication that has sprouted
up in recent years, there are several
pieces of trash which just confuse us by
distorting and manipulating information.
It is harder and harder to discern reliable
information from hyperbole, and our
energy is wasted sifting through the con
tradictions until we come up with a con
clusion that we hope reflects some mea
sure of reality.
Nonetheless, the idea that informa
tion equals power has surely secured sup
port among today's younger generations.
We are impressed with the number of
periodicals in our library and the number
of megabytes on our hard drives, but we
are too rushed to take in any detail from
the volumes which make us proud. The

more information that floods us, the
more we skim and summarize, missing
the important subtleties. We perform
powerful computer searches and then
eliminate articles from our final "rele
vant list" simply because they didn't con
tain the "key words" we were searching
for. Never mind what articles actually
say. Words typed and read per minute
have become the important indicators of
talent, while words understood per
minute take a back seat.
The information proliferation has
manifested itself in several forms.
From the advent of high-speed color
copiers and CD-ROM to the plethora of
checkout-line tabloids, the 20th centu
ry has undoubtedly provided increased
"information." Much of it is valuable
and a welcome tool for our understand
ing the world in general. But power,
for good or for bad, has always come
from the ability to interpret, mobilize
and present that information for a
focused purpose. Therefore, it should
be one of the priorities of any universi
ty to infuse such a critical ability into
its students. The information super
highway needs a speed limit so that we
can make some of its traffic meaning
ful.
