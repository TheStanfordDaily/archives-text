Proposed amendment would institute unfair fee system

IT WAS WITH great fanfare that the
special-fee amendment was intro
duced in the senate last quarter.
And, therefore, it was with deep disap
pointment that I reacted when the fine
print became known. There are a num
ber of clauses in the amendment that
gave me cause to stop and shudder.
Taken together, these factors provide a
decisive reason to vote no: denial of
refund rights, loss of student privacy,
uncertainty over funding, threat to
struggling student groups, unfairness
to new students.
First, the amendment would strip
students of a right that has been guar
anteed by the ASSU Constitution since
1979. The right to a fee refund was
designed to protect students from being
forced to pay for programs or activities
they either don't support or utilize.
When students refund their money,
they make a conscious decision to dis
entitle themselves from the services or
programming of that particular group.
This means that the expenditures of
that group decrease accordingly. In
sum, refund rights ensure systemic

fairness and equity for all involved par
ties.
Second, the amendment deprives
students of their privacy rights. The
bill would force students who have
philosophical or religious objections to
specific programs to file forms with the
ASSU Financial Manager's office. The
problem here is that the Financial
Manager would hold the sole discre
tionary power to judge the "moral
validity" of the student's objection.
More outrageous is that all the stu
dents filing for such status will have
their names placed on the public
record. Under the current system, stu
dents can privately file for refunds over
the computer. This amendment strips
away that privacy.
The third issue of concern is that the
amendment would create extreme
uncertainty over funding. When stu
dents vote, they will not know how
much money they are approving for
each group. Eveiything will hinge on
what the respective voting communities
do. As a result, the amount assessed
could be double the amount voted on.

Last December, I joined with several
other senators to offer repeated propos
als designed to rectify this unfortunate
situation. Every suggestion was defeat
ed by the People's Platform voting bloc.
The sad result is that this problematic
clause remains unchanged.
The fourth problem is that the
amendment threatens the viability of
struggling student groups. In past elec
tions, a certain portion of the body
voted to approve fees because they were
secure in the knowledge that their
money could be refunded later. This
portion of the electorate provided the
decisive margin of victory for valuable
student groups serving smaller seg
ments of the population. If this amend
ment passed, many students would be
reluctant to grant their assent. The
haunting result would be that worth
while groups would lose access to much
needed funding.
Finally and perhaps most worrisome
is that the amendment is very unfair to
new students. Freshmen, transfers and
new graduate students account for a
large segment of the student body. Yet

these students have absolutely no say
over how much they will be assessed.
Even given the most optimistic forecast
put forth by the proponents, new stu
dents would be faced with the daunting
prospect of paying a mandatory annual
fee of $135. Another troubling issue is
that not a single freshman was included
on the amendment committee. If the
voice of the Class of 1998 had been
heard, it is unlikely that the senate
would now be spending $10,000 of your
money to put on this election.
Ultimately, the decision rests in the
hands of the student body. Changing
the constitution is a matter that should
be taken seriously and solemnly. A con
stitutional amendment should be both
fair and equitable. The unfortunate
reality is that the Balanced Funding
Deal passes neither test. Your vote of
no will send a strong signal to the
ASSU that the game is up. And that, in
turn, will provide a mandate for real
reform.
