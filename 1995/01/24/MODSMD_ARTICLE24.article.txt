# Assault on sound-bite culture came from one who works by its rules
## 
### 
I attended James Carville's engagement
in Memorial Auditorium Jan. 18, and I also
viewed the film "The War Room," which
featured Mr. Carville and the rest of the
Clinton Presidential campaign staff. In
thinking about both experiences, I'm left
with a question I would like to ask him.
At the lecture, Carville provided a smat
tering of statistics and arguments in sup
port of the Democratic agenda under Presi
dent Clinton. In the midst of such an argu
ment, he bemoaned that we live in a coun- *

try of sound bites and the public simply
isn't educated about the real facts facing
the country.
Most of "The War Room," however,
focuses on the pains taken by Carville and
his staff to manipulate and control every
last detail of the media coverage of the
Clinton campaign (they even once worried
about the shape of campaign posters).
They certainly seemed to be fighting their
"war" with weapons of style rather than
substance. When I asked Carville how he
felt about contributing to the very manipu
lation of public perception he cited as prob
lematic, he replied, "If you're accusing me
of trying to win the election, then I'm
guilty!" In other words, the noble end of
getting Clinton elected justified these
means, though, admittedly, they were less
than ideal.

Earlier, someone had asked Carville a
hypothetical question: Would he partici
pate in a cover-up if damaging facts about
his candidate (that Carville knew to be
true) were about to come to light? Carville
answered that he would like to tell us that
he wouldn't participate in a cover-up, but
in reality, he simply didn't know what he
would do.
These responses leave me with the fol
lowing question: Where do you draw the
line, Mr. Carville'? If you agree with a can
didate's political convictions, how far
would you go to get him elected? When
does personal integrity become more
important? When do you begin to violate
the very ideals (truth, education, respect
for the citizens of the country) that you see
embodied in the platform of your candi
date? In a campaign carefully chore-

ographed, directed and censored by self
proclaimed "political professionals" such as
yourself and your wife, who are people
really voting for? The candidate, or the
shadow you've created?
Now maybe it is me who is the bumpkin
and not you, Mr. Carville. I know both par
ties use similar slick campaign tactics (and
have been doing so for many years), and
that a election may be unwinnable
without them, but does that allow you to
go home from a long day's "work" and feel
good about what you've done? If necessity
and integrity are at odds with each other in
a political campaign, can't we at least
admit it? Once society willingly accepts its
own manipulation, can it ever go back?
