## A
						new coach with traditional values Tyrone Willingham hopes to impart work ethic and sense of family to football program

He must have heard the criti
cism by now. "No head coaching
experience ? Anywhere ? "
The constant probing, the ques
tioning of his background and expe
rience. "He's never even been a coor
dinator?"
But for Tyrone Willingham,
these concerns are unimportant. He
knew the promotions would come,
the coaching ladder would be
ascended before his career was over.
He knew this because absolutely no
one works harder at his job than
Willingham.
Now, at 41, he has reached a
mtyor goal in his life — a head
coaching position at Stanford Uni
versity. Capping 17 years of tireless
work coaching a variety of positions
in the college and professional
ranks, Willingham is now the 30th
head coach in Cardinal history.
A graduate of Michigan State
University in 1977, he walked on to
both the football and baseball
teams. Scholarships were waiting at
smaller schools for both sports, but
the challenge of the Big 10 Confer
ence athletics was too big to pass up
for Willingham.
And nothing attracts Willing
ham's attention like a challenge.

"It was an opportunity," Willing
ham said in a deliberate voice, as if
the choosing of each word had to be
perfect. "It was a situation where I
was a midget — I was about 5-6 and
3/4 and 139 pounds and I don't
think that's frightening size to any
body."
After receiving three letters in
each sport and several motivational
and sportsmanship awards, anoth
er choice loomed for the Jack
sonville, N.C. native as graduation
approached. After beating the odds
by playing both sports, he had to
decide on which to concentrate.
Again, the decision rested on Will
ingham's desire to work harder
than ever before.
"The driving factor in motivat
ing you to do something is always to
choose the biggest task, and the
biggest task was football," he said.
And for the 150-pound quarter
back, the logical choice was to pur
sue coaching.
Starting as a graduate assistant
for one year at Michigan State
immediately after graduating (the
"best learning situation" according
to Willingham), he then spent two
years at Central Michigan coaching
the defensive secondary. Moving
back to the Spartans for three more
