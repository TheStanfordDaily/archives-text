## A 						new coach with traditional values Tyrone Willingham hopes to impart work ethic and sense of family to football program 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
He must have heard the criti
cism by now. "No head coaching
experience ? Anywhere ? "
The constant probing, the ques
tioning of his background and expe
rience. "He's never even been a coor
dinator?"
But for Tyrone Willingham,
these concerns are unimportant. He
knew the promotions would come,
the coaching ladder would be
ascended before his career was over.
He knew this because absolutely no
one works harder at his job than
Willingham.
Now, at 41, he has reached a
mtyor goal in his life — a head
coaching position at Stanford Uni
versity. Capping 17 years of tireless
work coaching a variety of positions
in the college and professional
ranks, Willingham is now the 30th
head coach in Cardinal history.
A graduate of Michigan State
University in 1977, he walked on to
both the football and baseball
teams. Scholarships were waiting at
smaller schools for both sports, but
the challenge of the Big 10 Confer
ence athletics was too big to pass up
for Willingham.
And nothing attracts Willing
ham's attention like a challenge.

"It was an opportunity," Willing
ham said in a deliberate voice, as if
the choosing of each word had to be
perfect. "It was a situation where I
was a midget — I was about 5-6 and
3/4 and 139 pounds and I don't
think that's frightening size to any
body."
After receiving three letters in
each sport and several motivational
and sportsmanship awards, anoth
er choice loomed for the Jack
sonville, N.C. native as graduation
approached. After beating the odds
by playing both sports, he had to
decide on which to concentrate.
Again, the decision rested on Will
ingham's desire to work harder
than ever before.
"The driving factor in motivat
ing you to do something is always to
choose the biggest task, and the
biggest task was football," he said.
And for the 150-pound quarter
back, the logical choice was to pur
sue coaching.
Starting as a graduate assistant
for one year at Michigan State
immediately after graduating (the
"best learning situation" according
to Willingham), he then spent two
years at Central Michigan coaching
the defensive secondary. Moving
back to the Spartans for three more

years, he doubled up the sec
ondary coaching duties with spe
cial teams.
In 1983, he headed to North
Carolina State to coach the sec
ondary and special teams. Three
years after that, he moved on to
Rice University to coach receivers
and special teams.
Starting in 1989, Willingham
began a coaching relationship
with Denny Green at Stanford
that helped mold Willingham into
the coach he is today. After three
years on the Farm as Green's run
ning backs coach, Willingham fol
lowed Green to Minnesota and
took on the same coaching
responsibilities with the Vikings.
And now, with nearly two
decades of coaching under his
belt, what does the Stanford head
coaching position mean?
"I think definitely this is my
biggest challenge," he said. "It's
one that will take all of my energy."
Judging by reports of Willing
ham's drive, all of his energy
might just be enough to power
most of the university for the rest
of the year. David Walker, a junior
on this year's squad, was immedi
ately impressed with Willingham
three years ago when the coach
was recruiting Walker to come
here. Both Green and former
Stanford Ail-American running
back Glyn Milburn expressly
noted Willingham's dedication
and motivation as being without
par.
However, such discipline and
principles have a cost. Willingham
demands the same traits from his
players and will accept nothing
less. Meet his goals and you
become a part of his football fam
ily. Fall short and you had better
be ready to redouble your efforts.
The idea of family is vital to
Willingham's past, present and
future. A member of the Stanford
coaching bloodline, Willingham
joins a long list of interconnected
coaches.
"Most of what I learned about
Stanford University I learned
112" Bill 'alsh ' ck in 1977-
1978, when I was fortunate
enough to be on his staff," Green
said. "Most of what Bill Walsh
learned, he learned from John
Ralston. Most of what John Ral
ston learned about Stanford, he

learned from Chuck Taylor. Prob
ably a lot of Tyrone Willingham
learned about Stanford, he
learned from Dennis Green. I
think he is definitely in the family
bloodline."
Continuing the family
metaphor, a primary concern for
Willingham is rebuilding the team
in the shape of an 85-member
household.
"What we really want to devel
op is a tight-knit family and to
stay amongst our football team,"
he said. "They've got to feel that
among the coaches and feel that
among the team. "
"When you and your family sit
down at the dinner table and talk,
you don't walk out of the house
and tell everyone what you dis
cussed at your family dinner.
That's just not good. Even though
we deal in a sport in which the
public wants to know everything
that takes place in the program,
what's said to the family stays in
the family."
Another extension of that fam
ily is his coaching staff, one which
Willingham has quietly assembled
over the past six weeks and char
acterizes his work ethic. Although
the staff is not yet complete (three
defensive coaches remain
unnamed), a quick glance at the
list brings several impressions to
mind. Collecting names at the
various stops along his coaching
career, Willingham has put
together a staff of young but expe
rienced football men.
The names Dana Bible, Dave
Borbely, Pat Morris, Don Tread
well, Mike Wilson and Dave Tip
ton aren't very familiar to most
of the Stanford community, as
few have had the time to carve
out major reputations. But with
an average age of just over 38,
the 1995-96 Stanford coaching
staff typifies its head coach —
young, hungry, driven to succeed
and beneficiaries of hard work.
Beginning his 47th day as
head coach, Willingham has just
returned from a week-long
recruiting trip, jumping from
Texas to Indiana to New York.
He sits in his corner office on the
second floor of the Arrillaga
Family Sports Center, nearly
hidden behind an exj \nsive dosk.
But this office, this building
cannot hold in the spirit and
drive of Willingham as he looks
out over the vast Stanford athlet
ic empire.
The midget is now a giant.
