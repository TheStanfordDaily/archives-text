# Women's tennis dominates opposition in Pac-10 tourney
## 
### Courtney Mann Contributing Writer 
The Stanford women's tennis team
returned from Seattle and the Pacific
10 Conference Women's Indoor Tennis
Tournament toting a lot more luggage
than it originally had. More hardware,
to be specific, as the squad brought
back three championship trophies, two
in singles competition and one in dou
bles.
The Lloyd Nordstrom Tennis Center
crowned senior Kim Shasby twice, ini
tially for her championship play in the

second singles flight. She then received
recognition for her doubles dominance
as she and sophomore Emily Burt ran
over opponents in the third doubles
flight.
Shasby defeated Eva Maria
Schurhoff of the University of Arizona
as she denied a 1-6 upset bid in the
first set by answering with sound 6-3
victories in the second and third sets.
In doubles, Shasby and Burt, the No. 1
seed, did nothing but prove their sta
tus throughout, outscoring opponents
by a total score of 37-13. This included
a 7-5, 6-2 championship, their closest

margin by far, over UCLA's Kelly
Rudolph and Paige Yaroshuk.
The Cardinal's third title came off
the racket of freshman Julie Scott in
the third singles flight. Scott took her
first collegiate crown in dramatic fash
ion, upsetting three of the four seeds,
including teammate and doubles part
ner Amy Chiminello in the finals.
Scott first erased the title hopes of
California's Nicole Elliot, the No. 3
seed, by wiping her out 6-0, 6-1. She
then met the No. 2 seed in the quarter
finals and continued her upset bout by
turning Arizona's Stephanie Sammari

tano 7-5, 6-7, 6-0. Chiminello, the No.
4 seed, fell prey to Scott 6-2, 6-2.
"I think it was a real good tourna
ment, but I know I have a lot of room
for improvement," Scott said.
The rest of the Cardinal singles
squad also played extremely well, as
made evident by Chiminello. She
advanced to her final against Scott
with an upending of her own, a 6-3, 7-
5 victory over the top-seeded Rudolph.
In the second flight, Sandra De Silva
almost mirrored Shasby's champi
onship run, as she reached the quarter
finals. The sophomore highlighted her

tournament with a first round surprise
victory second-seeded Yaroshuk.
Sophomore Katie Schlukebir and
freshman Ania Bleszynski battled
fiercely in a first flight chock full of tal
ent. Schlukebir, at the No. 2 seed,
advanced to the quarterfinals where
she met elimination at the hands of the
third-seeded Keri Phebus from UCLA,
who eventually went on to take the
title. Bleszynski bowed out a round
earlier when she met the much higher
seeded Kori Davidson from Arizona
State.
"We're not as strong up
there as we are in our depth,"
said head coach Frank Bren
nan. "The competition up
there is real tough. I'm not
concerned with [Schlukebir
and Bleszynski], One of them
is coming from the third sin
gles spot and the other is com
ing from high school tennis so
I'm real happy with their
progress."
Excluding the Shasby/Burt
title, Stanford's unseeded dou
bles tandems did not fare as
well as in singles. In the second
flight, Chiminello and Scott
dropped out early as fate
matched them up in the first
round with the No. 2-seeded
Cal squad. Bleszynski and
Schlukebir also had little for
tune with the No. 2 seed in
their top flight, as their 6-2, 6-
7, 6-2 loss in the quarterfinals
allowed UCLA's Phebus and
Susie Starret to advance.
The Cardinal now begins its
regular season, starting Friday
at home against Washington. It
will use this tournament as a
foundation with which to mea
sure its competition.
"Now we know our person
nel and have enough experi
ence to get going," Brennan
said.
