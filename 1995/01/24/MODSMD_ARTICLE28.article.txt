# Special gift from an open-minded father
## 
### 
My dad has no sons, and I'll
bet there are some days
when he'd like at least
one.
He was so patient when it
came to tea parties, stuffed ani
mals and trading stickers. Even
during the more turbulent times
of broken hearts and pubescent
hardships, he put up with "his
women." He probably didn't
understand, but he was under
standing.

It was a lonely battle, being the
only male in a household ruled by
female hormones. I think he
would have been a great dad no
matter what, but thank goodness
for sports. Sports gave us a stur
dier bridge between the genders,
a reason to relate, a common lan
guage.
The typical picture of Ameri
cana features the cute image of a
father playing catch with his son,
and I guess my dad didn't want to
lose that despite the lack of jock
straps in the household. I got a
mitt when I was coordinated
enough to catch a ball. I took up
track after racing my dad on the
school yard. I shot hoops when he
bought a brand new Spalding at
the Price Club. These things we
do because we're loved.
Thinking back now to tee
ball and rec soccer, I realize
that I got involved more for fun
than to fulfill any high-faluting
parental expectations. I also
realize that my dad encouraged
us not because he sought two
surrogate sons in my sister and
me, but because he simply

loved sports. He wanted to
teach us that love. We didn't
need to be sons to toss around
the ball in the backyard — we
could have fun pitching and
hitting too.
He took special pains to pass
along and cultivate this apprecia
tion for sports. I remember him
waking early and cooking break
fast for me before track meets. He
and my mom attended every bas
ketball game, each soccer match
and race. For every blowout,
severe embarrassment and awe
some comeback, they were in the
stands perched on those padded
fold-up seats that die-hard par
ents invest in. To this day my dad
makes his special rice for my sis
ter before her volleyball games.
Gradually I've picked up the
same opinions and habits as my
dad. I root for the Huskies
because that's his school; I hate
the baseball fiasco as much as he
does; I too believe that fishing is a
sport. We both shell peanuts in
the same way at ball games and
fight for the sports section of the
newspaper first. We even share
the same heartfelt — albeit
unpopular — confidence that the
Chargers will pull it off on Sun
day. (No laughing.)
Then again, he gave up on the
Padres long ago but I still hang
on. He loves Jason Kidd and I've
got my personal gripes about the
guy. He thinks Michael Jordan is
a crook and I'll defend him to my
dying day. A little friendly rivalry
never hurt anybody.
The truth is, my dad made me
into a fan. He didn't necessarily
want a tomboy; he just wanted
someone to cheer with. Now that
I'm a politically-correct Stanford
intellectual, I admire him all the
more for going against the grain
and giving me a basketball and
Barbie doll clothes for Christmas.
He allowed me to be his little girl
and his little sports nut at the
same time. I think we struck a


Allyson
Mizoguchi
healthy balance.
Now my dad sits back and watch
es his daughters root hard, play
hard and act like the sports fans we
are. We wear skirts and makeup,
talk trash and eat like horses. He
should be proud of his efforts. Not
only did we learn the love, but we
grew too. I've outgrown my dad by
two inches, and my sister towers
over him from her six-foot frame.
Not bad for the shortest person and
singular male in the household.
Must've been the rice.

Because of her dad, Allyson will
dutifully don the blue and gold
and have the pleasure of watching
history being made on Sunday.
