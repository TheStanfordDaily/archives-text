# Rugby teams cruise over Santa Cruz
## 
### Mike Jensen 
This past weekend, the Stan
ford men's and women's rugby
teams journeyed down the coast
to battle the UC-Santa Cruz
Banana Slugs. Both squads sur
vived a rain-soaked field and
waterlogged ball to post decisive
victories. But although both the
men and women experienced

success, the matches left a dis
tinctly different taste in each
team's mouth.
While the men dominated
their overmatched counterparts
from Santa Cruz, the 34-5 victo
ry seemed incomplete to both
players and coach. The blowout
on the scoreboard was not
indicative of the way Stanford
played as a team. Turnovers

and the lack of offensive connec
tions were two areas that con
tributed to a general lack of
cohesiveness that plagued the
Cardinal throughout the match.
"The team played poorly. We
didn't play together," said
junior captain Jeff Freund.
The squad's play was charac
terized by many individual per
formances, as opposed to one

united team effort hoped for by
coach Franck Boivert. The
team's lack of unity resulted in
a disconnected attack that often
seemed rushed.
"The players meant well by
trying to move quickly," Boivert
said. "Unfortunately they
lacked focus and discipline."
