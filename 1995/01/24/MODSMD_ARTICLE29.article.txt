# Rugby teams cruise over Santa Cruz
## 
### Mike Jensen 
This past weekend, the Stan
ford men's and women's rugby
teams journeyed down the coast
to battle the UC-Santa Cruz
Banana Slugs. Both squads sur
vived a rain-soaked field and
waterlogged ball to post decisive
victories. But although both the
men and women experienced

success, the matches left a dis
tinctly different taste in each
team's mouth.
While the men dominated
their overmatched counterparts
from Santa Cruz, the 34-5 victo
ry seemed incomplete to both
players and coach. The blowout
on the scoreboard was not
indicative of the way Stanford
played as a team. Turnovers

and the lack of offensive connec
tions were two areas that con
tributed to a general lack of
cohesiveness that plagued the
Cardinal throughout the match.
"The team played poorly. We
didn't play together," said
junior captain Jeff Freund.
The squad's play was charac
terized by many individual per
formances, as opposed to one

united team effort hoped for by
coach Franck Boivert. The
team's lack of unity resulted in
a disconnected attack that often
seemed rushed.
"The players meant well by
trying to move quickly," Boivert
said. "Unfortunately they
lacked focus and discipline."

Having defeated Santa Cruz with tremendous individual performances, the men's rugby team now looks to Improve on its team play.
Aside from the rough spots,
Boivert was quick to point out sev
eral highlights from the game.
Newcomer Jared Hopkins made a
spectacular debut coming off the
bench to score two tries. (A try is
the rugby equivalent to a touch
down in football.) Hopkins has been
practicing with the team for only
two weeks.
Another great individual effort
came from junior Bobby Blount.
Blount's amazing 60-yard run
around, past and through the
Banana Slugs ended in a Cardinal
try and established Stanford's supe
riority in the first half
Despite the obstacles and frus
trations encountered this weekend,

Boivert sees no reason to doubt that
his team will come around. "I'm
pretty confident we're going to get
things straightened out," he said.
Like their male counterparts, the
women's team enjoyed a comfort
able victory in cruising to a 20-0
shutout Saturday. Unlike the men's
team, however, the women enjoyed
complete and satisfying success.
Playing with a style Boivert
described as "extremely smart and
brilliant," the women used a
focused team effort to defeat Santa
Cruz.
In only its second year of exis
tence, the Santa Cruz club didn't
pose a formidable threat to the Car
dinal in a game hindered by the
Banarla Slugs' lack of competitive
experience. The slow pace translat
ed into a lot of scrums, (the forma
tion in rugby when both teams are
huddled around the ball trying to

gain possession, looking similar to a
crowd of people trying to find the
same contact lens in a ten foot
radius) which the Cardinal con
trolled throughout the game.
Senior captain Cynthia Pong's
performance proved instrumental
to the team's success in scrums.
Second row player Allyson Ford
was another outstanding per
former on the day. Ford pointed to
good coaching and "aggressive"
play as key reasons for the Stanford
victory.
"The team really pulled togeth
er," she said.
In addition to Ford, Boivert also
commended the performances of
Karen O'Connell and Stephanie
Kwee. Kwee was responsible for two
of the team's four tries.
"I hope the program is revital
ized," Boviert said. "This was a
clean, well-deserved victory."
