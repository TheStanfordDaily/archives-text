### Martin L. Yeung Contributing writer 
After losing both its staff mem
bers, the Sexual Assault Resource
Center has found new leadership
in Sally Baird, who was appointed
in December to fill the position of
Sexual Assault Prevention Coor
dinator.
The half-time position, funded
by the University, has been vacant
since August when Trace Shapiro
completed her term. The full-time
position of Sexual Assault Preven
tion Educator, formerly filled by
Angelina Cheney and funded by
the Coalition Against Sexual As
sault, was eliminated in October

due to lack of funding.
Baird's appointment was ap
proved by Cowell Student Health
Center in conjunction with the
Stanford Sexual Assault Preven
tion Program. Although the ap
pointment was made in Decem
ber, Baird will not assume the
daily duties of her post until early
February.
Baird comes to Stanford with
more than 10 years experience in
rape crisis management and sexu
al assault prevention program
ming. She has worked locally as
the rape crisis program director at
the Palo Alto YMCA since 1991.
