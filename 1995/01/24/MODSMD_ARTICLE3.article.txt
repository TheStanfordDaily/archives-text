# The 						counselor is in
## Sex assault prevention coordinator's post filled 
### Martin L. Yeung Contributing writer 
After losing both its staff mem
bers, the Sexual Assault Resource
Center has found new leadership
in Sally Baird, who was appointed
in December to fill the position of
Sexual Assault Prevention Coor
dinator.
The half-time position, funded
by the University, has been vacant
since August when Trace Shapiro
completed her term. The full-time
position of Sexual Assault Preven
tion Educator, formerly filled by
Angelina Cheney and funded by
the Coalition Against Sexual As
sault, was eliminated in October

due to lack of funding.
Baird's appointment was ap
proved by Cowell Student Health
Center in conjunction with the
Stanford Sexual Assault Preven
tion Program. Although the ap
pointment was made in Decem
ber, Baird will not assume the
daily duties of her post until early
February.
Baird comes to Stanford with
more than 10 years experience in
rape crisis management and sexu
al assault prevention program
ming. She has worked locally as
the rape crisis program director at
the Palo Alto YMCA since 1991.
"She's an absolutely wonderful
asset," said Carole Pertofsky, direc
tor of Co well's Health Promotion
Program which oversees the Sexual
Assault Prevention Program.
"Over the years, she has helped to
train Stanford students to work at
the Palo Alto YMCA to handle the
crisis hotline. She's given presenta
tions on campus to make both men
and women more aware of sexual
assault that occurs [in a college envi
ronment]," Pertofsky said.
Baird has an extensive back
ground dealing in social work bene
fiting the local community. In addi
tion to coordinating rape prevention
and counseling programs at the
YMCA, she has been actively
involved in helping children of abu
sive parents.
Pertofsky said because Baird is a
relative outsider to the rules and pro
cedures of Stanford, she requires
additional time to familiarize herself
with the demands of the position.
"Sally's an outsider, and we are
pleased at the fact," said Pertofsky,
adding that Baird would bring new
input and experience to the program.
"Right now, she's in orientation
and serving on an official University
task force looking into ways to pre
vent sexual assault on the Stanford
campus," Pertofsky said.
She received her bachelor's at the
University of Michigan in 1978 and a
master's in Educational Psychology
from the University of San Francisco
in 1987.
Although the sexual assault pre
vention educator position was elimi
nated after CASA lost its special fee
in the 1994 ASSU election, the Uni
versity has guaranteed funding for
the half-time position for an addi
tional two years.
Baird was out of town and could
not be reached for comment.
