# A 						change in the water: browner, but still safe

More and more Stanford res
idents may be switching to bot
tled water because of a signifi
cant change in the University's
water supply during February
and March.
Officials say that the new
water supply, which has higher
levels of alkalinity, conductivity
and dissolved solids, will remain
safe to drink but could affect
some laboratory experiments
with sensitive equipment.
The San Francisco Water
Department (SFWD) notified
the University's Facilities divi
sion of the change in the water
supply, and notices have been
posted around campus so stu
dents and faculty will be aware.
The SFWD will be shutting
down the Coast Range Tunnel
Feb. 1 for inspection and main
tenance, according to Facilities
Engineer Marti Laporte, so no
water from Stanford's usual
major source of water — the
Hetch Hetchy reservoir — will
be delivered.
Instead, other reservoirs
and sources will be used for the
water supply and as a result the
blend of water has changed for
the whole peninsula, including
San Jose and San Francisco.
"People will probably notice
some difference in taste due to
the increase in salts and dis
solved solids," Laporte said.

The change in the water qual
ity may also affect certain labo
ratory experiments. Most labs,
however, already have distilling
equipment, so few are concerned
with the change in the water
quality, according to Sharon
Brauman, director of the Chem
istry Undergraduate Labs.
"It's doubtful that any
experiments will be affected in
the physics teaching labs," said
James Plummer, teaching
assistant for the undergradu
ate physics labs. However, he
joked that students could be
held responsible for identifying
any effect the different water
has on their experiments.
On the other hand, School of
Medicine researchers may be
greatly affected by changes in
the water quality since experi
ments, such as those with tis
sue cultures, require good qual
ity water.
The School of Medicine, the
Central Energy Facility, and
other places likely to be dispro
portionately affected by the
change were notified as early as
October, Laporte said.
"We tried to notify people
because people don't like to be
surprised," stated Laporte.
The change in water supply
could have another impact —
spots. Laporte said Dining Ser
vices will have an increasingly
difficult time getting their dish
es fully clean because of the
growing deposits of carbonate.
