# Impartial rule enforcer or agent of the majority?
## ASSU grapples with role of senate chair 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
This week, as decisions on special-fee re
form and Publications Board space alloca
tion draw to a close, the year's two hottest
ASSU issues leave behind them questions
about the role played by the senate chair in
ASSU policy-making.

This year's chair, Nawwar
Kasrawi, has had extensive
influence on both issues —
and though the controversial
Balanced Funding Deal is

now left for the student body to decide —
Kasrawi played a mgyor role in expediting
the bill through the senate.
Kasrawi's supporters say positive en
forcement of policy is what a senate chair
should do. Others, however, feel the chair
should remain outside the political fray.
Above all, these detractors say the senate
chair must remain "impartial," outside the

realm of policy-making.
Some cite Kasrawi's ac
tions during debate over
special-fee reforms as an
expression of what they
feel is abuse of the chair's
power in order to set his
own agenda.
In that instance, oppo
nents accused Kasrawi of
overstepping his bounds

by utilizing the controversial "sweatshirt
rule" to disqualify the votes of two senators
not wearing their uniforms — clearing the
way for Senate Bill CA-l's passage just as it
seemed headed for failure.
But Council of Presidents member Mork
Murdock said Kasrawi is just doing his job in
guiding policy. Since the senate elects the
chair, Murdock said, the role of the chair is
to please the majority of the senators.


Kasrawi
"At any point they have the
power to overrule or remove the
senate chair," Murdock said. "To
this point they haven't chosen to
do either."
Kasrawi himself said he sees
his role as "someone who can pro
vide leadership for the senate.
It's the chair's job to effectively
facilitate meetings, encourage
debate and organize meetings."
Unlike previous chairs, Kas
rawi seems to take a more active
view of his role.
"It's also the role of the chair
to help the senate be as effective
as possible," he said. "This
includes helping senators achieve
their goals, advising them on leg
islation, creating task forces to
study pressing issues, and ensur
ing that legislation addressing
students needs is passed."
Musical chairs
Many agree that the role of the
senate chair has varied in the
past three years with each annu
al turnover.
On the whole, many veteran
senators said that chairs in the
recent past have been extremely
impartial, sometimes at the
expense of effective senate policy.
Graduate student Sanford
Dickert, who recently resigned
from the senate after four years
of involvement, said the chairs he
remembers from his first two
years as a senator were very
unbiased.
Kevin Warsh, chair in 1991-
92, "tried to make sure both sides
were heard," Dickert said. "He
did try to be fair."
Since the role of the chair is
"to facilitate debate on issues so
that both sides of the issues are
heard," Dickert said, "the senate

chair in most cases should
remain impartial. I don't believe
the senate chair should execute
his or her own agenda."
Last year's Senate Chair Greg
Waldorf agreed, saying that the
chair should, "above all else, be
impartial. You have to have every
senator believe that you're will
ing to apply the rules fairly to
allow them to move their legisla
tion to the senate."
"Greg Waldorf did his best to
stay above the political fray," said
undergraduate senator Stephen
Russell. "He tried to bring
respect and unbiasness to the
position of the chair."
Yet a senate chair must also
provide guidance to other sena
tors, Dickert said. Waldorf, he
said, "was so impartial that he
was not effective."
Waldorf's lack of knowledge
on student government was not
his fault because he received no
guidance from Ron Brown, the
previous senate chair, Dickert
added.
"This senate chair is very
knowledgeable of the system,"
Dickert said of Kasrawi.
Two years ago, a unique situa
tion arose for Brown as senate
chair. Because students the pre
vious year had elected not to have
a COP, Brown was essentially the
president of the senate.
Murdock described Brown as
"a straight facilitator of meet
ings," a quality which he said
Waldorf lacked.
But Brown suffered from the
same problem of trying to walk
the line between impartiality and
effectiveness, Dickert said. While
Brown was impartial, he "just did
not provide guidance to the sena
tors," Dickert said.
Kasrawi said the various pos
sible interpretations of the job
lead to differences from year to
year.
The chair's duties, as laid out

in ASSU Bylaws, give little guid
ance as to the level of involve
ment a chair is supposed to have.
According to the bylaws, the
role of the chair is to preside over
senate meetings and to serve as
chief executive officer of the sen
ate, as enforcer of the ASSU Con
stitution, bylaws and standing
rules and as senate liaison
between the senate and other
University branches such as the
COP or the administration.
The bylaws also give the chair
the right to "appoint, remove or
replace senators on any body
containing a member of the sen
ate, except as otherwise provided
in the case of the Senate Steer
ing Committee." The rule notes
that the senate itself can reject
any such appointments or
removals.
"The previous two years saw
chairs who were content to facili
tate meetings and were reluctant
to get involved more extensively
in the affairs of the ASSU," Kas
rawi said.
"Looking back at those two
years, it's clear that while the
senates were efficiently orga
nized, they didn't address major
issues of concern to students
because senators found them
selves lacking the experience and
organization needed to address
major problems."
Leadership or abuse?
Yet some feel that, in trying to
provide guidance, Kasrawi has
been too active. This year's chair
had to combat allegations of mis
use of power when he stepped in
to moderate the November
uproar over the status of the
Chapparal humor magazine, Pub
Board space and the COP
removal of the Pub Board's head,
Danny Bressler.
When different publications
were arguing over the distribu
tion of office space in the Storke

Building, Kasrawi said he
attempted to mediate and help
the process.
"Throughout the year up until
this point I have offered and will
continue to offer my help to both
the Chappie and the Pub Board
to help resolve space allocation,"
he said.
But Russell, last year's Pub
Board director, said he felt that
"Nawwar's handling of the Pub
Board issue was rather suspect. I
felt that his intrusion into the
board's affairs and his attempt to
make it a senate chair issue was
inappropriate."
Because the Pub Board issue
will be debated at tonight's sen
ate meeting, Bressler declined
comment on the issue.
Most of the criticism of Kas
rawi's chairmanship, however,
has come from his discretionary
use of the "sweatshirt rule" dur
ing debate of the special-fee
reform bill.
As the issue headed toward
failure during an initial senate
vote last quarter, Kasrawi dis
qualified two senators opposed to
the special-fee reforms from vot
ing because they were not wear
ing the senate's sweatshirt uni
form. His action caused a tie
between the two sides — which
Kasrawi broke by casting a vote
in favor of the reforms.
The move caused an uproar
among the bill's opponents, and
even among some who actually
supported the reforms. Under
graduate Senator Smeeta Rama
rathnam went so far as to change
her vote from yes to abstention
and then to no in protest of Kas
rawi's actions.
Ramarathnam said she
believes the sweatshirt rule had
never been evoked previously in
cases where senators failed to
wear their sweatshirts.
"If [Kasrawi] had been observ
ing the rule from day one, that

would have been perfectly justi
fied. Because he hadn't done it,
that was an abuse of power," she
said.
"My concern at the time was
that [the sweatshirt rule] lent
itself to abuses exactly like this,"
Waldorf added.
But Kasrawi defended his
actions, claiming that because
the senate did not overrule his
decision, no misuse of power
occurred.
"A small minority of senators
are opposed to action of any kind
and try to do anything they can to
prevent action on issues that are
important to students," he said.
Indeed, most of Kasrawi's
opponents are also opponents of
the People's Platform party, of
which both Kasrawi and the COP
are members, and which has
dominated several votes in the
senate.
"The reality of the matter,"
Kasrawi continued, "is that the
senate has the right at any time
to appeal any of my decisions,
and indeed has the right to
remove me by a simple majority. I
have been appealed numerous
times, frequently by the same
group of senators, and my deci
sions have been upheld by the
senate every time."
Deputy Senate Chair Michael
Choo agreed. "It is customary
that the tactics of the minority on
an issue are to question the
power and the impartiality of the
chair," he said.
Murdock added that he
believes the Dec. 7 meeting was
the first time a voting senator did
not wear the sweatshirt uniform.
"It's the first instance that that
occurred. I've never seen anyone
not wearing a sweatshirt," he
said.
Although Murdock said the
rule was "ridiculous," he added
that, because it is in the ASSU
Constitution, it must be obeyed.
This week, as decisions on special-fee re
form and Publications Board space alloca

ASSU issues leave behind them questions

vide leadership for the senate.
It's the chair's job to effectively
facilitate meetings, encourage
debate and organize meetings."
Unlike previous chairs, Kas
rawi seems to take a more active
view of his role.
"It's also the role of the chair
to help the senate be as effective
as possible," he said. "This
includes helping senators achieve
their goals, advising them on leg
islation, creating task forces to
study pressing issues, and ensur
ing that legislation addressing
students needs is passed."
Musical chairs
Many agree that the role of the
senate chair has varied in the
past three years with each annu
al turnover.
On the whole, many veteran
senators said that chairs in the
recent past have been extremely
impartial, sometimes at the
expense of effective senate policy.
Graduate student Sanford
Dickert, who recently resigned
from the senate after four years
of involvement, said the chairs he
remembers from his first two
years as a senator were very
unbiased.
Kevin Warsh, chair in 1991-
92, "tried to make sure both sides
were heard," Dickert said. "He
did try to be fair."
Since the role of the chair is
"to facilitate debate on issues so
that both sides of the issues are
heard," Dickert said, "the senate

chair in most cases should
remain impartial. I don't believe
the senate chair should execute
his or her own agenda."
Last year's Senate Chair Greg
Waldorf agreed, saying that the
chair should, "above all else, be
impartial. You have to have every
senator believe that you're will
ing to apply the rules fairly to
allow them to move their legisla
tion to the senate."
"Greg Waldorf did his best to
stay above the political fray," said
undergraduate senator Stephen
Russell. "He tried to bring
respect and unbiasness to the
position of the chair."
Yet a senate chair must also
provide guidance to other sena
tors, Dickert said. Waldorf, he
said, "was so impartial that he
was not effective."
Waldorf's lack of knowledge
on student government was not
his fault because he received no
guidance from Ron Brown, the
previous senate chair, Dickert
added.
"This senate chair is very
knowledgeable of the system,"
Dickert said of Kasrawi.
Two years ago, a unique situa
tion arose for Brown as senate
chair. Because students the pre
vious year had elected not to have
a COP, Brown was essentially the
president of the senate.
Murdock described Brown as
"a straight facilitator of meet
ings," a quality which he said
Waldorf lacked.
But Brown suffered from the
same problem of trying to walk
the line between impartiality and
effectiveness, Dickert said. While
Brown was impartial, he "just did
not provide guidance to the sena
tors," Dickert said.
Kasrawi said the various pos
sible interpretations of the job
lead to differences from year to
year.
The chair's duties, as laid out

in ASSU Bylaws, give little guid
ance as to the level of involve
ment a chair is supposed to have.
According to the bylaws, the
role of the chair is to preside over
senate meetings and to serve as
chief executive officer of the sen
ate, as enforcer of the ASSU Con
stitution, bylaws and standing
rules and as senate liaison
between the senate and other
University branches such as the
COP or the administration.
The bylaws also give the chair
the right to "appoint, remove or
replace senators on any body
containing a member of the sen
ate, except as otherwise provided
in the case of the Senate Steer
ing Committee." The rule notes
that the senate itself can reject
any such appointments or
removals.
"The previous two years saw
chairs who were content to facili
tate meetings and were reluctant
to get involved more extensively
in the affairs of the ASSU," Kas
rawi said.
"Looking back at those two
years, it's clear that while the
senates were efficiently orga
nized, they didn't address major
issues of concern to students
because senators found them
selves lacking the experience and
organization needed to address
major problems."
Leadership or abuse?
Yet some feel that, in trying to
provide guidance, Kasrawi has
been too active. This year's chair
had to combat allegations of mis
use of power when he stepped in
to moderate the November
uproar over the status of the
Chapparal humor magazine, Pub
Board space and the COP
removal of the Pub Board's head,
Danny Bressler.
When different publications
were arguing over the distribu
tion of office space in the Storke

Building, Kasrawi said he
attempted to mediate and help
the process.
"Throughout the year up until
this point I have offered and will
continue to offer my help to both
the Chappie and the Pub Board
to help resolve space allocation,"
he said.
But Russell, last year's Pub
Board director, said he felt that
"Nawwar's handling of the Pub
Board issue was rather suspect. I
felt that his intrusion into the
board's affairs and his attempt to
make it a senate chair issue was
inappropriate."
Because the Pub Board issue
will be debated at tonight's sen
ate meeting, Bressler declined
comment on the issue.
Most of the criticism of Kas
rawi's chairmanship, however,
has come from his discretionary
use of the "sweatshirt rule" dur
ing debate of the special-fee
reform bill.
As the issue headed toward
failure during an initial senate
vote last quarter, Kasrawi dis
qualified two senators opposed to
the special-fee reforms from vot
ing because they were not wear
ing the senate's sweatshirt uni
form. His action caused a tie
between the two sides — which
Kasrawi broke by casting a vote
in favor of the reforms.
The move caused an uproar
among the bill's opponents, and
even among some who actually
supported the reforms. Under
graduate Senator Smeeta Rama
rathnam went so far as to change
her vote from yes to abstention
and then to no in protest of Kas
rawi's actions.
Ramarathnam said she
believes the sweatshirt rule had
never been evoked previously in
cases where senators failed to
wear their sweatshirts.
"If [Kasrawi] had been observ
ing the rule from day one, that

would have been perfectly justi
fied. Because he hadn't done it,
that was an abuse of power," she
said.
"My concern at the time was
that [the sweatshirt rule] lent
itself to abuses exactly like this,"
Waldorf added.
But Kasrawi defended his
actions, claiming that because
the senate did not overrule his
decision, no misuse of power
occurred.
"A small minority of senators
are opposed to action of any kind
and try to do anything they can to
prevent action on issues that are
important to students," he said.
Indeed, most of Kasrawi's
opponents are also opponents of
the People's Platform party, of
which both Kasrawi and the COP
are members, and which has
dominated several votes in the
senate.
"The reality of the matter,"
Kasrawi continued, "is that the
senate has the right at any time
to appeal any of my decisions,
and indeed has the right to
remove me by a simple majority. I
have been appealed numerous
times, frequently by the same
group of senators, and my deci
sions have been upheld by the
senate every time."
Deputy Senate Chair Michael
Choo agreed. "It is customary
that the tactics of the minority on
an issue are to question the
power and the impartiality of the
chair," he said.
Murdock added that he
believes the Dec. 7 meeting was
the first time a voting senator did
not wear the sweatshirt uniform.
"It's the first instance that that
occurred. I've never seen anyone
not wearing a sweatshirt," he
said.
Although Murdock said the
rule was "ridiculous," he added
that, because it is in the ASSU
Constitution, it must be obeyed.
This week, as decisions on special-fee re
form and Publications Board space alloca
tion draw to a close, the year's two hottest
ASSU issues leave behind them questions
about the role played by the senate chair in
ASSU policy-making.

News
analysis

This year's chair, Nawwar
Kasrawi, has had extensive
influence on both issues —
and though the controversial
Balanced Funding Deal is

now left for the student body to decide —
Kasrawi played a mgyor role in expediting
the bill through the senate.
Kasrawi's supporters say positive en
forcement of policy is what a senate chair
should do. Others, however, feel the chair
should remain outside the political fray.
Above all, these detractors say the senate
chair must remain "impartial," outside the

realm of policy-making.
Some cite Kasrawi's ac
tions during debate over
special-fee reforms as an
expression of what they
feel is abuse of the chair's
power in order to set his
own agenda.
In that instance, oppo
nents accused Kasrawi of
overstepping his bounds

by utilizing the controversial "sweatshirt
rule" to disqualify the votes of two senators
not wearing their uniforms — clearing the
way for Senate Bill CA-l's passage just as it
seemed headed for failure.
But Council of Presidents member Mork
Murdock said Kasrawi is just doing his job in
guiding policy. Since the senate elects the
chair, Murdock said, the role of the chair is
to please the majority of the senators.


Kasrawi
"At any point they have the
power to overrule or remove the
senate chair," Murdock said. "To
this point they haven't chosen to
do either."

facilitate meetings, encourage
