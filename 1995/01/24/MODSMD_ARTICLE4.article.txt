# Impartial rule enforcer or agent of the majority?
## ASSU grapples with role of senate chair 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
This week, as decisions on special-fee re
form and Publications Board space alloca
tion draw to a close, the year's two hottest
ASSU issues leave behind them questions
about the role played by the senate chair in
ASSU policy-making.

This year's chair, Nawwar
Kasrawi, has had extensive
influence on both issues —
and though the controversial
Balanced Funding Deal is

now left for the student body to decide —
Kasrawi played a mgyor role in expediting
the bill through the senate.
Kasrawi's supporters say positive en
forcement of policy is what a senate chair
should do. Others, however, feel the chair
should remain outside the political fray.
Above all, these detractors say the senate
chair must remain "impartial," outside the

realm of policy-making.
Some cite Kasrawi's ac
tions during debate over
special-fee reforms as an
expression of what they
feel is abuse of the chair's
power in order to set his
own agenda.
In that instance, oppo
nents accused Kasrawi of
overstepping his bounds

by utilizing the controversial "sweatshirt
rule" to disqualify the votes of two senators
not wearing their uniforms — clearing the
way for Senate Bill CA-l's passage just as it
seemed headed for failure.
But Council of Presidents member Mork
Murdock said Kasrawi is just doing his job in
guiding policy. Since the senate elects the
chair, Murdock said, the role of the chair is
to please the majority of the senators.
