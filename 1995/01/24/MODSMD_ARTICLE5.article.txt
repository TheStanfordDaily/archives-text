# Shuffle of Pub Board's space on ASSU agenda
## Proposal would split Chappie rooms in Storke 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
After months of controversy, a proposed
reallocation of space for student publica
tions may be debated and voted on at
tonight's ASSU senate meeting.
If the bill passes both the Budget and Fi
nance Committee and the full senate, two
rooms currently occupied by the Stanford
Chaparral will change hands â€” one would
be shared by the Stanford Review and the
ASSU Publications Board and the second
would be used as common space by a variety
of student publications.

Pub Board Director Danny Bressler, a ju
nior, said passage by the ASSU would mere
ly confirm votes already taken by the board
reallocating space in the Storke Student
Publications Building.
The Chaparral humor magazine contest
ed the board's decision, and University ad
ministrators blocked the implementation of
the reallocation to give the Chaparral time
to appeal to the ASSU.
"This will be the chance for the Chapar
ral to appeal," Bressler said.
Chris Onstad, a Chaparral editor, said he
hopes to stop the bill at the committee level.
