# Shuffle of Pub Board's space on ASSU agenda
## Proposal would split Chappie rooms in Storke 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
After months of controversy, a proposed
reallocation of space for student publica
tions may be debated and voted on at
tonight's ASSU senate meeting.
If the bill passes both the Budget and Fi
nance Committee and the full senate, two
rooms currently occupied by the Stanford
Chaparral will change hands — one would
be shared by the Stanford Review and the
ASSU Publications Board and the second
would be used as common space by a variety
of student publications.

Pub Board Director Danny Bressler, a ju
nior, said passage by the ASSU would mere
ly confirm votes already taken by the board
reallocating space in the Storke Student
Publications Building.
The Chaparral humor magazine contest
ed the board's decision, and University ad
ministrators blocked the implementation of
the reallocation to give the Chaparral time
to appeal to the ASSU.
"This will be the chance for the Chapar
ral to appeal," Bressler said.
Chris Onstad, a Chaparral editor, said he
hopes to stop the bill at the committee level.
"We will appeal to the commit
tee to have the bill tabled because
they don't know the full circum
stances behind the thing," he
said.
The bill — authored by
Bressler, graduate senator Marc
Oppenheimer and undergradu
ate senators Smeeta Ramarath
nam and Andre Vanier — calls
for an end to two months of
inaction and a confirmation of
the Pub Board's right to admin
ister space in the Storke Build
ing.
The Chaparral has occupied
four rooms of the Storke Build
ing since the building's construc
tion in 1963. The building then
comfortably held the four stu
dent publications in operation,
Bressler said, but now more than
20 student groups, including The
Review, are publishing out of one
common room.
The Chaparral, which con
tributed some funding to the

construction of the building,
maintains that it has a historic
claim to its rooms. Although it
retains the use of four rooms, the
actual publication of the maga
zine is carried out in the common
room alongside other groups,
Bressler said.
Bressler said the crowding has
only gotten worse since the Nov.
21 vote to reallocate the space.
"More student publications are
using the common space than
ever before," he said.
In a letter to the senate intro
ducing the bill, Bressler said,
"The overwhelming majority of
the student publications are gen
uinely frustrated by what they
perceive to be an attempt to
delay a resolution to this situa
tion, and are being hurt because
the growth of the board has been
put on hold."
Onst.ad said senators have
been led to believe that delays in
the bill are the Chaparral's fault.
The delays have actually
come from the senate's preoccu
pation with tomorrow's Bal
anced Funding Deal election, he
said. Senate chair Nawwar Kas

rawi had promised the magazine
a review committee to look at
the reallocation process, he said,
but because of other concerns,
the committee was never
formed.
Onstad said he is confident his
team of Chaparral editors and
alumni can block the bill. "Ideal
ly we'd see the committee
formed," he said. "That would be
due process, and that's what
we'd like to see."
But Bressler said he believes
the bill would pass both commit
tee and senate, partly because of
increasing frustration.
"Once the senate has the
facts, once they see that this is
something that a number of pub
lications want passed . . . I'm
confident that the senate will
uphold the board's decision," he
said.
"For one thing, this has been
an issue which the board has
been examining and debating
and discussing for a number of
years," Bressler said. "It does
allocate the Chaparral two
rooms, rooms which they in fact
do not use for publishing activi

ties. It will open up some desper
ately needed space for student
publications."
Because of current space
strains, "a lot of [publications]
have to publish out of dorm com
puter clusters or their rooms,"
he added.
Undergraduate senator
Vanier, who helped author the
bill as a member of the senate's
Budget and Finance Committee,
said, "If it clears the Budget and
Finance Committee, I think it
will pass the senate."
Although she said she
couldn't predict the outcome of
tonight's meeting, Ramarath
nam said, "this bill needs to be
passed because the Pub Board is
in a frozen area.
"That's the reason for the
entire bill to be in existence," she
explained. "The Pub Board is in
limbo. Good policy means we
need to move on."
In other business, the Pub
Board will also introduce a bill
which would, if passed, allow the
withdrawal of some reserve
money to buy "some badly need
ed hardware," Bressler said.
