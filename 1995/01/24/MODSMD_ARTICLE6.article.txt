# Food, folks and fun — with a foreign twist
## Sunday suppers keep Bechtel cooking

The Bechtel International
Center abounded with the
sounds of the popular merengue
and salsa singers Juan Luis
Guerra and Ruben Blades. And
while the assembly-hall setting
did not contribute to a Latin-
American flavor, the food and the
chatter of Spanish helped trans
form the atmosphere into one
more distinctly Latin American.
The festive dinner — hosted by
the Latin American Students As
sociation — was just one example
of the little-known Sunday Sup
per series that the I-Center offers.
The suppers give both stu
dents and community members

an opportunity to experience for
eign cultures.
"Being able to eat Latin-
American foods and listen to
Latin-American music reminds
me of a summer I spent in Mexi
co," said freshman Jessica
Berkowitz.
"It's nice that the I-Center
gives people a chance to enjoy
other countries and learn about
them," she said.
Praveen Menon-Johansson, I-
Center resident from England,
coordinates the Sunday suppers.
The Sunday supper is a 4-year
old tradition that seeks to "get
people together to experience
some culture, homemade food
