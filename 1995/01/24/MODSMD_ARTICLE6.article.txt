# Food, folks and fun — with a foreign twist
## Sunday suppers keep Bechtel cooking 
### Moira Chiong 
The Bechtel International
Center abounded with the
sounds of the popular merengue
and salsa singers Juan Luis
Guerra and Ruben Blades. And
while the assembly-hall setting
did not contribute to a Latin-
American flavor, the food and the
chatter of Spanish helped trans
form the atmosphere into one
more distinctly Latin American.
The festive dinner — hosted by
the Latin American Students As
sociation — was just one example
of the little-known Sunday Sup
per series that the I-Center offers.
The suppers give both stu
dents and community members

an opportunity to experience for
eign cultures.
"Being able to eat Latin-
American foods and listen to
Latin-American music reminds
me of a summer I spent in Mexi
co," said freshman Jessica
Berkowitz.
"It's nice that the I-Center
gives people a chance to enjoy
other countries and learn about
them," she said.
Praveen Menon-Johansson, I-
Center resident from England,
coordinates the Sunday suppers.

old tradition that seeks to "get
people together to experience

and a film after," Menon-Johans
son said.
She emphasized that the suppers
are meant to be "non-structured
fun" and a time of sharing in an
informal setting.
Menon-Johansson added that
the I-Center always brings "at
least 30 to 40 people or more" to
the suppers and that a core of
people come regularly.
The I-Center funds the hosting
group's groceries. Groups volun
teering to cook usually find the
experience fun, she said.
LSA President, junior Irene
Yackovlev — who comes from
Venezuela — said she and the
group decided they would love to
cook after the I-Center contacted
them.
Along with Yackovlev, four
board-members and six volun
teers from LSA cooked the supper
in the kitchens of the I-Center.

In order to plan a menu, Yack
ovlev said she called her mother
in Caracas.
"It was a family effort," she
said. "My mother and my sisters
got together to decide the menu."
In preparation for the supper
LSA members woke early to buy
food and brought it to the I-Cen
ter, Yackovlev said.
"For the flan we had to make a
caramel sauce which was stress
ful because it has to be made
exactly right," she said.
"We also started making the
hot chocolate at 1 p.m., and began
to rotate stirring for five and a
half hours. It became our witches
brew."
While cooking, Yackovlev said
there were six pots on the stove at
once while merengue music blast
ed from the stereo.
LSA cooked typical Venezue
lan dishes including "polio llan
era," chicken with a tomato sauce
and "arroz bianco con cebolla,"
white rice with onion. They later
served flan, a custard and "quesil-
Io," hot chocolate.

Sophomore Carie Lemack,
who helped make the supper,
said that it was fun speaking
Spanish and being with people
who understood Latin-American
culture.
"It was a group effort," she
said. "Making a meal for 50 peo
ple, and the fact that they all sat
down and ate it and no one got
sick — it was rewarding," she
said.
The cost to attend a supper is
$5 for Stanford community and
$7 for others. The money from
the supper directly funds the next
supper.
If an organization is particu
larly successful, the excess money
will be given to the association. In
some cases, proceeds go to a char
ity of the hosting group's choice.
The I-Center does not profit from
the dinners, Menon-Johansson
said.
Menon-Johansson noted that
the number of undergraduate
hosting groups has increased this
year, with four in the fall quarter
and three in the winter quarter.
