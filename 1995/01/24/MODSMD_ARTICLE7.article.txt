# Students debate pros, cons of Balanced Funding Deal

### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
In preparation for the upcoming
special elections, Council of Presi
dent's member Mork Murdock and
undergraduate senator Andr6
Vanier clashed over the Balanced
Fund Deal in a debate last night at
Cedro House.
Speaking before 30 undergradu
ates at its height, the two opponents
agreed that a division between the
graduate and undergraduate com
munity was necessary for special-fee
voting, but argued over whether or
not fee refunds should exist.
The amendment will be voted on
by the student population in an elec
tion to be held Wednesday and
Thursday.
If passed, it would divide special
fee votes between undergraduates
and graduate students, abolish fee re
funds, place a cap on the total
amount of money that can be re

quested each year, and make groups
that petition to be on the ballot earn
60 percent approval to receive fund
ing, among other things.
Vanier challenged the rationale
behind removing the special-fee re
fund, which has been part of the
ASSU Constitution since 1979.
Calling the removal of the special
fee refunds "extra baggage" on the
amendment, Vanier argued that the
ASSU must "protect individual stu
dents by giving them the option" of
the refund.
Vanier, a member of the recently
formed Students Alliance party, con
tinued by arguing that the bill would
limit students' privacy rights and
force them to pay higher fees, while
leaving groups unsure if they are to
be "nixed."
Murdock defended the bill, which
he said would lower undesirable costs
that stem from the refund system.
