# Students debate pros, cons of Balanced Funding Deal
## 
### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
In preparation for the upcoming
special elections, Council of Presi
dent's member Mork Murdock and
undergraduate senator Andr6
Vanier clashed over the Balanced
Fund Deal in a debate last night at
Cedro House.
Speaking before 30 undergradu
ates at its height, the two opponents
agreed that a division between the
graduate and undergraduate com
munity was necessary for special-fee
voting, but argued over whether or
not fee refunds should exist.
The amendment will be voted on
by the student population in an elec
tion to be held Wednesday and
Thursday.
If passed, it would divide special
fee votes between undergraduates
and graduate students, abolish fee re
funds, place a cap on the total
amount of money that can be re

quested each year, and make groups
that petition to be on the ballot earn
60 percent approval to receive fund
ing, among other things.
Vanier challenged the rationale
behind removing the special-fee re
fund, which has been part of the
ASSU Constitution since 1979.
Calling the removal of the special
fee refunds "extra baggage" on the
amendment, Vanier argued that the
ASSU must "protect individual stu
dents by giving them the option" of
the refund.
Vanier, a member of the recently
formed Students Alliance party, con
tinued by arguing that the bill would
limit students' privacy rights and
force them to pay higher fees, while
leaving groups unsure if they are to
be "nixed."
Murdock defended the bill, which
he said would lower undesirable costs
that stem from the refund system.

Currently, Murdock said, the
ASSU overcharges students by
nearly $400,000 in special fees
because of inflated budgets. The
ASSU adds a buffer, which for
most groups is around 30 percent
of its total request, to counteract
the effects of students' refund
requests.
By passing the amendment, and
eliminating refunds, Murdock
argued that the extra charges could
be eliminated. Getting rid of the
buffer and eliminating special fee
refunds would allow the ASSU to
stop the overcharging, Murdock
contended.
But Vanier said the proposal to
eliminate special fees was a political

move designed to get the amend
ment through the senate, to "make
it politically viable." He added that
since only 10 percent of the under
graduates ask for the refunds,
there is no logical reason to get rid
of the refund option.
During a question-and-answer
session, senior David Cohen advo
cated the defeat of the bill, arguing
that special-fee groups should cater
to both the graduate and under
graduate communities.
Both Murdock and Vanier dis
agreed, saying that to be fair the
diversity of both communities had
to be preserved by a split. "Neither
group should override the other
group " Murdock said.
Conen also asserted that the
Murdock's monetary figures were
skewed. According to his estimate
of the overcharged fees, the number
should come to $214,081, rather

than $400,000.
Another undergraduate
expressed curiosity over why the
bill, which appears to deal with two
separate issues, was being voted on
as one amendment.
If only one issue was approved,
"we would throw the system off
balance," Murdock said. He point
ed out that the bill was the propos
al of a task force which did a large
amount of research on the issue.
Although Vanier commended
the work that was put in, he said he
hopes they "will write a new bill
that will hopefully garner support,"
and not eliminate the special-fee
refunds.
If the amendment passes, Mur
dock said, the special fees would rise
to $49 a quarter. The higher rise,
argued Murdock, would be justified
by the addition of 12 new groups to
the ballot.
