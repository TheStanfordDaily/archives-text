We're looking for people who
look at this glass and say:
"There's gotta be other
glasses of water."
C 2.
We need people capable of going
beyond half-full or half-empty thinking.
People who see subtleties. Who are
quite frankly bored by easy answers and
off-the-shelf solutions.
People who are constantly
challenging their own thinking and are
thirsty for new ideas and knowledge.
You'll have a degree from a top
school. Getting a job won't really be an
issue. The question is: which job? Which
industry?
You don't want to get locked into
one area and then discover three to five
years from now that you don't like it. By
then you've invested too much.
Andersen Consulting offers you
the chance to work on a variety
of projects—with clients in a wide
range of industries.
We are the leader in helping
organizations apply information
technology to their business advantage.
Every hour of every business day, we
implement a solution to help one of our
more than 5,000 clients worldwide.
What makes that possible is the
quality of our people. And the quality of
our training. We're known for both.
Because business and technology
are ever-changing, we see training
as a continuing process. And our
$123-million Center for Professional
Education in St. Charles, Illinois,
is just one measure of our commitment.
We train you for a career —not just a job.
Are you the kind of person we're
talking about? The kind of person with
an unquenchable desire for challenge
and professional growth?
If so, come talk to us. And
find out more about a career with
Andersen Consulting.
