# 'You must run if you want to be alive.'
## Reporter risks life for truth 
### Heather Knight 
For Natka Buturovic, doing
her job meant risking her life.
As a journalist covering the
war in Sarajevo for seven
months in 1992, she did what
all fighting factions involved
forbade journalists to do. She
told the truth.
Because of her commitment
to report the news objectively
— the ultimate goal for many
journalists — she has been cho
sen as a Knight Fellow and will
be studying at Stanford for the
winter quarter.
The peaceful Main Quad
and palm trees are a very dif
ferent setting from what Bu
turovic has left behind. In a
1993 article written for"The
Index of Censorship," Butur
ovic refered to Sarajevo as "the
last circle of hell. The biggest
concentration camp ever."
Reporting for the first inde
pendent daily in former Yu
goslavia, Borba, Buturovic was
horrified to see the destruction
that had become part of every
day life for her hometown of
Sarajevo.

Knight Fellow Natka Buturovic risked her life to report the truth
about the war in her home city of Sarajevo.
now in shambles.
Buturovic explained the trans
formation of her city as being
"horrible. The town is 500 years
old and it is being destroyed day
after day," she said.
"They are killing that town,"
she said. "The only reason is
that the town is a symbol of how
different nations can live togeth
er."
Saturday will mark the 1000 th
day of siege in Sarajevo. Accord
ing to Buturovic, three armies
completely surround the city: the
Bosnian Serbs, the Bosnian regu
lar army and the United Nations
forces.
With such tight controls there,
reporting the news daily was a
challenge. Even moving through
the city was difficult.
"You must run if you want to
be alive because you are always in
a sniper's view," Buturovic
explained. "I ran all the time. It
was the only way to move through
the city."
Communication technology —
which American journalists take
for granted — is absent in Sara
jevo, making Buturovic's job
even more difficult. Since Borba
is located in Belgrade, another

city in the former Yugoslavia,
Buturovic had to find some way
to relay her information across
the miles.
"All connections with the other
world were cut in Sarajevo. I
found two young men who were
radio amateurs," she said. "They
made connections with Belgrade
and I reported that way."
Reporting the truth any way
she could, Buturovic soon became
the target of threats from all of
the warring armies.
"No one wanted me to be there,
so I was in a very dangerous situ
ation," she said. "I was nearly
jailed or even killed."
After going into hiding, the
only way that she was able to
leave Sarajevo unharmed was to
"promise not to tell." She still will
"not tell" the secrets of the war
because she does not want to put
anyone in Sarajevo in danger.
After leaving Sarajevo, she
made her way back to Belgrade
where she took the safer, though
less fulfilling, job of desk editor
for Borba.
Buturovic described this "pro
motion" with a hint of sadness.
"For me journalism is covering
events. I don't like to be the edi
tor."
Though she has left her job
temporarily and is now thousands
of miles away from Sarajevo, the
memories of the horror remain

with her. She said she especially
misses her family, and remembers
what they and the other citizens
of the city under siege have to live
through daily.
"Can you imagine people who
do not have enough food, who
wait for aid, who have no electric
ity, no water?" she said. "What
does that mean? They must go all
the way across town for water or
to see someone they love."
Buturovic tried to come up
with a word to describe the sen
timent of the innocent people
caught in the center of the war.
She wrestled with several terms:
"pride", "helplessness", "anger".
Unsatisfied, she refered to her
tiny Serbo-Croatian/ English
dictionary and looked up the
word "prkos" Nodding, she set
tled on this term, meaning spite.
Though she said she still holds
great concern for the people
remaining in Sarajevo, Buturovic
is glad to be at Stanford to pursue
studies in ethnic and cultural con
flicts.
Because of her particular area
of interest, Buturovic has been
chosen as the first Egon Scotland
Memorial Fellow, a branch of the
Knight Fellows.
Scotland was a Knight Fellow
at Stanford in 1989-90, and was
killed a year later while covering
the fighting in Croatia. This fel
lowship, established in his memo

ry, is granted to journalists who
wish to study ethnic/nationalis
tic/religious conflicts.
Prof. Jim Bettinger, deputy
director of the Knight Fellow
ships, said he sees Buturovic as
possessing the qualities which
were important to Scotland and
all great journalists.
"She is a brave journalist," he
said. "She has shown that she was
concerned about these issues,
willing to act on her beliefs, expos
ing herself to danger to get the
truth out."
Bettinger said he believes that
Buturovic will gain a lot from her
time here. But perhaps more
importantly, Stanford will gain a
lot from Buturovic, according to
Bettinger.
"Stanford will gain a closer
look at a horrible conflict which
may be halfway around the world,
but which is of great significance
in the post-Cold War world," he
said.
Though the seemingly sense
less war in Sarajevo has certain
ly been a terrible time in
Yugoslavian history, Buturovic
said she has no regrets about
putting herself right in the mid
dle of it.
In fact, she would do it again if
she had the opportunity.
"Maybe tomorrow if it were possi
ble," she said. "I would just be
doing my job."

last circle of hell. The biggest
concentration camp ever."
Reporting for the first inde
pendent daily in former Yu
goslavia, Borba, Buturovic was
horrified to see the destruction
that had become part of every
day life for her hometown of
Sarajevo.

Meghna Chakrabarti — Daily
Knight Fellow Natka Buturovic risked her life to report the truth
about the war in her home city of Sarajevo.
now in shambles.
Buturovic explained the trans
formation of her city as being
"horrible. The town is 500 years
old and it is being destroyed day
after day," she said.
"They are killing that town,"
she said. "The only reason is
that the town is a symbol of how
different nations can live togeth
er."
Saturday will mark the 1000 th
day of siege in Sarajevo. Accord
ing to Buturovic, three armies
completely surround the city: the
Bosnian Serbs, the Bosnian regu
lar army and the United Nations
forces.
With such tight controls there,
reporting the news daily was a
challenge. Even moving through
the city was difficult.
"You must run if you want to
be alive because you are always in
a sniper's view," Buturovic
explained. "I ran all the time. It
was the only way to move through
the city."
Communication technology —
which American journalists take
for granted — is absent in Sara
jevo, making Buturovic's job
even more difficult. Since Borba
is located in Belgrade, another

city in the former Yugoslavia,
Buturovic had to find some way
to relay her information across
the miles.
"All connections with the other
world were cut in Sarajevo. I
found two young men who were
radio amateurs," she said. "They
made connections with Belgrade
and I reported that way."
Reporting the truth any way
she could, Buturovic soon became
the target of threats from all of
the warring armies.
"No one wanted me to be there,
so I was in a very dangerous situ
ation," she said. "I was nearly
jailed or even killed."
After going into hiding, the
only way that she was able to
leave Sarajevo unharmed was to
"promise not to tell." She still will
"not tell" the secrets of the war
because she does not want to put
anyone in Sarajevo in danger.
After leaving Sarajevo, she
made her way back to Belgrade
where she took the safer, though
less fulfilling, job of desk editor
for Borba.
Buturovic described this "pro
motion" with a hint of sadness.
"For me journalism is covering
events. I don't like to be the edi
tor."
Though she has left her job
temporarily and is now thousands
of miles away from Sarajevo, the
memories of the horror remain

with her. She said she especially
misses her family, and remembers
what they and the other citizens
of the city under siege have to live
through daily.
"Can you imagine people who
do not have enough food, who
wait for aid, who have no electric
ity, no water?" she said. "What
does that mean? They must go all
the way across town for water or
to see someone they love."
Buturovic tried to come up
with a word to describe the sen
timent of the innocent people
caught in the center of the war.
She wrestled with several terms:
"pride", "helplessness", "anger".
Unsatisfied, she refered to her
tiny Serbo-Croatian/ English
dictionary and looked up the
word "prkos" Nodding, she set
tled on this term, meaning spite.
Though she said she still holds
great concern for the people
remaining in Sarajevo, Buturovic
is glad to be at Stanford to pursue
studies in ethnic and cultural con
flicts.
Because of her particular area
of interest, Buturovic has been
chosen as the first Egon Scotland
Memorial Fellow, a branch of the
Knight Fellows.
Scotland was a Knight Fellow
at Stanford in 1989-90, and was
killed a year later while covering
the fighting in Croatia. This fel
lowship, established in his memo

ry, is granted to journalists who
wish to study ethnic/nationalis
tic/religious conflicts.
Prof. Jim Bettinger, deputy
director of the Knight Fellow
ships, said he sees Buturovic as
possessing the qualities which
were important to Scotland and
all great journalists.
"She is a brave journalist," he
said. "She has shown that she was
concerned about these issues,
willing to act on her beliefs, expos
ing herself to danger to get the
truth out."
Bettinger said he believes that
Buturovic will gain a lot from her
time here. But perhaps more
importantly, Stanford will gain a
lot from Buturovic, according to
Bettinger.
"Stanford will gain a closer
look at a horrible conflict which
may be halfway around the world,
but which is of great significance
in the post-Cold War world," he
said.
Though the seemingly sense
less war in Sarajevo has certain
ly been a terrible time in
Yugoslavian history, Buturovic
said she has no regrets about
putting herself right in the mid
dle of it.
In fact, she would do it again if
she had the opportunity.
"Maybe tomorrow if it were possi
ble," she said. "I would just be
doing my job."
