# Indiana hick Dorkin elected Daily editor
## 
### Saráh Katz Michael Slemmer Noncontributing writers 
Wee Hoo!
Holding a champagne bottle
after a secretly tallied vote, Andy
Dorkin emerged unscathed from
a hotly contested battle over
soon-to-be-outgoing-editor-in
chief Elise Wolfgang's power
seat.
At any rate, the word on the
street is that the boy from Indi
ana can't get it up. The bottle,
that is. He kept spilling it all
over his moustache.
The Dorkster assumed the
position after a quarter abroad in
Florence. The city, that Ls. He
said he couldn't remember which
fmger to give the cab drivers.
Anyway, Dorkman will be a
strong member of The Daily
next volume. Managing Editor
Colleen Krueger, who was wor
ried because she did receive one

write-in vote, breathed a sigh of
relief at his election. "I don't
think," she said. "He'll have any
problems leading the staff."
Dorkin, who is an official
"Member" — a tan one — and
always keeps a sweater handy
for those special occasions, said
he feels ready to take control of
the publication. "I'm stupid," he
said. "If I say that next volume
won't be a great experience."
On top of that, Dorko said he
looks forward to finding new
sources. "Steve Russell was
great," he said. "But the news
department needs more variety."
Running for editor was "a
sort of climax," Dork said. "I've
had a lengthy career." He
stressed that the length of his
career has increased since his
visit to Dr. Melvyn Rosenstein.
Killing time will not 1m? an
option in Dworkin's volume. "I
want to blow the entire staff,"
he said. "Awav "
