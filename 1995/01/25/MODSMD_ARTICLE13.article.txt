## Clinton gives State of the Union President's words do not strike a chord in a hostile Congress 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a
political drama unseen for 40 years,
President Clinton went before a dis
trusting Republican Congress last
night and appealed for common
ground to make "dramatic change
in our economy, in our government
and in ourselves."
The upheaval wrought by the
Republican election Landslide was
visible throughout the president's
State of the Union address — from
the moment Speaker Newt Gingrich
took the gavel to the striking silence
that often greeted Clinton from the
GOP.
At one point, Republicans even
booed. About 20 of them left as Clin
ton went on and on for an hour and
20 minutes.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
said afterward that while Clinton's
message was important, "the more
important and most powerful mes
sage remains the one the American
people delivered in November."

Drawing his own conclusions
about the last two elections, Clinton
said: "We didn't hear America
singing. We heard America shout
ing.
"Now we must say: We hear you.
We will work together to earn your
trust."
In a speech that offered few new
initiatives, Clinton urged a national
campaign to combat teen pregnan
cy. To cut down on illegal immigra
tion, he proposed creation of a
national data bank to help employ
ers verify the identification of
prospective workers.
Clinton was the first Democrat
since Harry Truman to face a
Republican Congress, and the White
House viewed the address as crucial
in rebuilding his troubled presiden
cy.
'Mr. President, welcome to the
House," said Gingrich, the aggres
sive Republican leader who has
dominated the capital for 11 weeks.

However, Republicans sat on
their hands when Clinton boasted
that the country was stronger than
it was when he took office. The GOP
greeted his call for an increase in the
minimum wage with cold silence.
In his most emphatic statement,
Clinton said he would not permit
Congress to roll back last year's ban
on assault weapons. It was as close
as he came to threatening a veto of
GOP legislation.
Acknowledging the failure of his
health-reform bill last year, Clinton
conceded, *We bit off more than we
could chew." But he refused to
entirely abandon what was once his
top priority.
New Jersey Gov. Christie Whit
man, who has rocketed to political
stardom with a tax-cutting plan,
gave the Republican response. In a
dig at Clinton's lengthy address,
Whitman said, "Before I begin, let
me assure you I am not going to ask
for equal time."
