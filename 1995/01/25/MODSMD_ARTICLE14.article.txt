# Israeli crackdown on militants

EL BIREH, West Bank (AP) â€” Israeli
troops arrested dozens of Palestinian activists
yesterday, ransacked a mosque and welded
shut the offices of Islamic extremists following
a deadly weekend bombing.
Declaring only separation from the Pales
tinians could stop the violence, Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin said his government was work
ing on measures to keep Palestinians out of
Israel, including the possibility of erecting a
fence.
The hawkish opposition dismissed the idea
as impractical and cowardly, and also submit
ted two no-confidence motions over govern
ment plans to curb Jewish settlement con
struction.
Rabin's narrow coalition yesterday defeat
ed the combined motions 61-53 in the 120-seat
parliament. But in an additional blow to the
government's stability, the ultra-religious
Shas Party, which usually abstains or sup
ports Rabin, voted against the coalition.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, mean
while, lashed out at his Islamic militant oppo
nents, saving their attacks on Israelis sabo

taged his efforts to take control of the West
Bank.
"Those who broke the cease-fire now want
ed nothing but to kill the Palestinian dream,"
Arafat told students at Al-Azhar University in
Gaza City.
But, he added, Israel's retaliatory measures
also retarded peace.
Arafat's security forces briefly detained
Sheik Abdallah Shami, spiritual leader of the
Islamic Jihad group responsible for the blast
Sunday in central Israel that killed 19 Israelis,
most of them young soldiers, and two suicide
bombers.
However, Shami's detention fell short of
Israeli demands that Arafat crack down on
Hamas and Islamic Jihad and foil future
attacks launched from the PLO-ruled Gaza
Strip.
In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, troops
carried out arrest raids late yesterday and Yes
terday morning. More than 80 Hamas and
Islamic Jihad members were jailed, most of
them mid-level activists, Palestinian reporters
and Israel radio said.
