Picking up the pieces
KOBE, Japan (AP) — Faced with 307,000 homeless people,
the largest number since World War 11, the government
announced tax breaks yesterday and low interest loans to
relieve suffering from Japan's catastrophic earthquake.
Opposition legislators, nevertheless, denounced the gov
ernment's performance in the wake of the Jan. 17 quake
and called on Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama to
resign.
One week after the quake, the death toll stood at 5,063 and
68 people were missing. Another 26,500 people were injured
and more than 56,400 buildings were damaged or destroyed
in the magnitude 7.2 quake.
Authorities must also care for more than 307,000 people
now homeless in this once vibrant city of 1.4 million. The
homeless are living in tents, makeshift shelters, schools and
government buildings.
Plans call for building pre-fabricated, temporary housing,
but construction will take weeks to complete.
Electricity has been largely restored, but more than
633,000 households still lack water and nearly 856,000 have

no natural gas. Water trucks roam the city, stopping periodi
cally to allow people to fill containers.
Motor Voter
COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A day after the Justice Department
sued three states over the "motor voter" law, South Carolina
filed a pre-emptive lawsuit yesterday to block the government
from forcing it to comply with the 1993 legislation.
California Gov. Pete Wilson, who vetoed compliance legis
lation and ordered state agencies not to obey the law, also has
sued to overturn it.
South Carolina "will not kowtow to threats of intimidation
by the government in Washington," state Attorney General
Charlie Condon, a Republican, said.
On Monday, Attorney General Janet Reno sued Illinois,
California and Pennsylvania to force compliance with the
National Voter Registration Act. Legislatures in Illinois and
Pennsylvania did not act on the law last year.
It requires all states to provide voter registration through
the driver licensing process, through the mail and at state
social service offices.
