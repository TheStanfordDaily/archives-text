## Editorials Model student group 
### 
AT A UNIVERSITY as
diverse as Stanford, it is
difficult to find student
groups from which all students
— undergraduate and graduate
alike — benefit.
However, the ASSU Speakers'
Bureau proves to be an excep
tion to this rule.
The recent speech in Memori
al Auditorium by political guru
James Carville best exemplifies
the success of this group. Stu
dents of every age, color and
background attended the event.
In the past, the group has also
brought such noted speakers as
Ice-T, Spike Lee, Paul Tsongas
and Naomi Wolf to campus — all
people who are well-known, have
wide appeal and are provocative
speakers.
While adding to Stanford's

intellectual awareness, the
Speakers' Bureau realizes the
importance of those who fund
them. Students who refund
their Speakers' Bureau special
fee must pay for tickets to
events organized by the bureau
(tickets are free to all fee-paying
students). In addition, the
Speakers' Bureau also helps
defray costs by charging out
siders for tickets. There are no
free gifts, yet students receive a
very tangible benefit for their
fee.
The Speakers' Bureau deserves
a pat on the back for a job well
done and should be encouraged to
continue bringing a wide variety
of people to campus. Other cam
pus organizations should use the
Speakers' Bureau as an example
of a successful student group.
