# First day to vote 'no'
## 
### 
Today and Thursday,
students will vote on a pro
posed amendment to the
ASSU Constitution aimed at
revamping the ailing special-fee
system.
The so-called Balanced Fund
ing Deal would eliminate fee
refunds, split graduates and
undergraduates into separate
voting communities and limit the
amount of student group fees the
ASSU Senate could place on the
ballot.
Any proposal for reforming the
fee system might seem alluring
at this point, but the Balanced
Funding Deal contains serious
flaws that make it unacceptable.
Students should vote to reject it.
The proposed division of the
graduate and undergraduate fee
systems and the elimination of
the refund process would serve
admirable ends. But to keep fees
under control, the proposed
amendment also places a cap on
the amount of fees the senate can

place on the ballot.
The cap would require the sen
ate to decrease some or all
groups' fee requests — not neces
sarily proportionally — in order
to bring the total beneath the
cap.
The plan would allow the sen
ate responsibility for making pri
ority judgments among deserving
groups and within groups' bud
gets — decisions better left to the
voters and to the groups them
selves. In addition, groups that
chose to bypass the senate by col
lecting petitions would need 60
percent voter approval to receive
fees, rather than just 50 percent.
The ASSU fee system is in dire
need of reform, but we should
not accept a proposal that will
just introduce new problems. By
voting no on the Balanced Fund
ing Deal, students can prevent a
student-group funding disaster
and get the student government
back on track designing an
acceptable reform plan.
