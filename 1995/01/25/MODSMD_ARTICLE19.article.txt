Current special-fee system is not unfair to student groups

ARE YOU DEEPLY concerned about
the terrible injustices perpetrated by
the ASSU special-fee system? No?
Have you got more pressing matters to
worry about? Busy watching the O.J.
Simpson trial? Well, we're going to put on
an election regarding special-fees anyway.
Here's why we're voting, and why you
might want to care enough to vote "no" on
the so-called "BFD."
This started last year, when graduate
students held a widely publicized "tea
party" of fee refunds. Large numbers of
grad students, dissatisfied with student
groups that gave them little service or
attention, simply took their money back.
This caused quite a stir, especially among
student group leaders who suddenly found
their budgets cut. The student groups and
the ASSU, sensing a crisis, responded —
by padding budgets and adding a buffer of
30 percent to all fee requests, just in case
those grad students decided to take their
money back again.
At the same time, the ASSU was trying

out a new, computerized voting system
which, it turned out, wasn't very easy to
use. The result of the ballooning budgets
and the difficult voting system was that
not many students voted, and fewer voted
to fund student groups. So last spring, 18
groups got support from the students and
received their special fee requests; 18 oth
ers did not.
The student group leaders, who saw
that their student funding was no longer a
sure thing, got together with the ASSU
Senate, and a task force was formed to see
what could be done. The result is the bill
the authors named the "BFD" or "Bal
anced Funding Deal."
But what's wrong with the system
we've got now? The voting program has
been totally replaced, so voter turnout and
abstentions shouldn't be problems like
they were last year. Half of the groups
that failed last year had plenty of support,
but not enough people actually voted and
the votes didn't count. That shouldn't
happen again. What else is wrong? Any-

thing? Well, according to the authors of
the BFD, the biggest problem is that the
current system is "unfair." I think the
problem lies elsewhere.
The special-fee system isn't "unfair."
Stanford students vote on student groups'
fee requests — democratic majority rule.
Last I heard, voting was a good thing. And
for those in the minority who feel
oppressed by the "tyranny of the majori
ty," fee refunds provide a way out. This
system isn't broken. In fact, last year it
worked perfectly — and our ASSU leaders
couldn't seem to deal with it.
Two things happened last year. Grad
students took refunds from groups that
were ignoring grad students. And in the
spring, when those groups continued to
ignore grad students, they got voted
down. Graduates didn't vote "no" on
everything, either — groups as diverse as
Spoon Hunger Relief Network, Club
Sports, the Solar Car Project and the
Stanford Symphony got support from
graduate students. But the Axe Commit

tee, the Kayak Club and the REDWOOD
program didn't.
Grad students sent a message to stu
dent groups: give us some attention, or
we're not going to pay for you! This isn't
tough to understand. But BFD supporters
want to have it both ways. They want
groups to have their full funding assured
even if they only serve half of Stanford
students. This is wrong.
Special-fees are supposed to go to
"activities which benefit the entire student
population," as Mork Murdock so elo
quently put it in last Friday's Daily. If stu
dent groups aren't going to support the
whole Stanford community, they can't
expect widespread community support!
The solution for those groups? Either
start casting a wider net, or get money
from things like fundraisers and dues
instead. The fee system works fine — BFD
supporters should stop whining about
injustice and start listening to the voters.
