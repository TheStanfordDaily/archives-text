# Hackers invade SLAC system
## 
### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
Unknown computer hackers broke into the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Project computer system this
weekend, infiltrating a computer and changing sev
eral system files that would have given them free
reign over the lab's network and electronic-mail sys
tems.
The break-in was discovered within a few hours by
a tripwire program, and no damage or sabotage oc
curred except to the one infiltrated computer, ac
cording to Dr. Les Cottrell, assistant director of com

puter services at SLAC.
But in order to prevent further abuses by the
anonymous hackers and to rebuild the hacked com
puter — this time with more stringent security —
outside access to the facility's computers was cut and
not available for a day, Cottrell said.
He said the laboratory, which conducts particle
physics research, is used by several hundred scien
tists who mainly lost their computer connections to
colleagues outside of SLAC as a result of the incident.
The attack on SLAC came only a day before the
government-financed Computer
Emergency Response Team
(CERT) released an Internet advi
sory which warned system opera
tors of a new method of "hijack
ing" computer systems that are
hooked up to the Internet.
Officials of the agency, based at
Carnegie Mellon University, said
computers — even those already
protected by sophisticated securi
ty programs — were vulnerable to
a flaw in the Internet that hack
ers have recently discovered.
The break-in at SLAC, howev
er, is not the result of this flaw,
Cottrell explained, since SLAC
had already taken measures
against it last June.
Intruders have taken advan

tage of this flaw in the design of
the network, which was reported
as theoretically possible by AT&T
researchers almost a decade ago.
The same invaders, by capitaliz
ing on the flaw, could fool router
computers into believing that
messages were coming from a
friendly machine.
Known as "IP spoofing," the
technique is used by hackers to
masquerade as a trusted machine,
accessing computer resources —
such as databases, confidential
information and credit card num
bers — that are generally well
protected from outsiders.
According to CERT, 20 million
home, business and university
computers are vulnerable to the
weakness inherent in the Inter
net.
One of the attacks was
addressed in a talk at a computer
security seminar at the Universi

ty of California in Davis given by
Tsutomo Shimomura, a computer
security expert at the San Diego
Supercomputer Center whose
computer was illegally invaded.
The CERT has released a list of
router computers that can use a
program that prevents "IP spoof
ing" attacks by intruders. The list
also contains a list of router com
puters that are incapable of pro
viding adequate security from the
attacks.
According to Dennis Michaels,
who heads the Leland system at
Stanford, filters that prevent "IP
spoofing" have been installed to
protect the Stanford gateway,
meaning that "the entire campus
is protected."
The University also has plans
for hiring another security expert,
to work in a project to bring added
security to the campus' comput
ers.
