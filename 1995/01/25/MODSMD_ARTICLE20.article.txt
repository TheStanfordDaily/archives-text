# Special-fee proposal is justified since it heeds majority's preferences
## 
### 
I don't know where the idea of fee
refunds came from in the first place.
In the real world, we vote for candi
dates who we think will spend our tax
money well. If we are lucky, we are in
the m£yority and our candidate man
ages to follow through on our prefer
ences. We don't get to claim a refund
for a road built on the other side of
the state just because we will never
use it.
The proposed constitutional amend
ment regarding fee refunds will allow us
to express our preferences in the spring
election. If we are lucky, we will be in
the mcgority, and the ASSU will fund

the organizations we like. If we are
unlucky, we might end up in the minori
ty on certain issues. Then, just like the
real world, we will have to live with the
decisions of the majority.
However, unlike the real world, we
actually get to see many of the benefits
of this small ($135 out of $25,000) tax.
Stanford has a tremendous diversity of
student groups. Some groups provide
direct benefits, while others indirectly
benefit us by provoking our thoughts
and responses. At any rate, I would ven
ture to guess that most students benefit
from some of the majority-approved spe
cial-fee funded groups.
Why should we allow free-riders the
opportunity to receive the benefits of
campus activities and diversity without
paying their fair share? It's the same as
tax evasion, a crime in the real world.
