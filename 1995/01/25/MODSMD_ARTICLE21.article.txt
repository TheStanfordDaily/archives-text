# Atomic bomb was used justifiably, contrary to revisionist perspective
## 
### 
The Jan. 20 article titled "Stanford his
tory prof sparks WWII debate" refers to
the contentious discussion underway
between the American Legion and the
Smithsonian Institution surrounding the
planned exhibition of the Enola Gay â€” the
airplane from which the first atomic bomb
was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.
In focusing on the issue of whether
there would have been only 63,000 Ameri
can casualties in an invasion of Japan,
reported by Stanford historian Barton
Bernstein, or a quarter of a million casual
ties, estimated by others, the Daily's article
misses the key point. That is, the lower
casualty estimate is being used by some to

support their claim that dropping the
bomb was not only unnecessary, but
immoral.
Truman's decision to drop the bomb in
order to end the war quickly was justified
even if an invasion would have resulted in
much lower American casualties than
Bernstein estimates. Should the President
have sacrificed even ten times fewer Amer
ican lives unnecessarily in prosecuting a
war in which U.S. servicemen already paid
too high a price? And would not such an
invasion have been at a terrible toll in
Japanese lives, perhaps greater than were
lost at Hiroshima and Nagasaki? A good
many of our parents and grandparents,
who paid the price in loved ones lost in the
Pacific, must surely view in bewilderment
the ongoing exercise in revisionist history.
