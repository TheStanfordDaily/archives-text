## The 						currency of power

"The false poet speaks of himself,
almost always in the name of others.
The true poet speaks with others by
speaking to himself." — Oetavio Paz
PAULO FREIRE COMES from a
world that I do not know. Grow
ing up in Brazil during the
19205, Freire experienced one of the
most extreme situations of poverty in
the Third World. As a child the strug
gle against hunger was the supreme
fact of his daily life; later it became the
motivation for his life's work.
Today Freire is a radical and world
renowned educator. Yet many would
argue that his experience is still vastly
different from mine; in relation to me,
Freire is "the other." We do not share
gender, race, age or environment. We
come from different economic, social
and political backgrounds. And I doubt
that we even think in the same lan
guage.
Yet despite these differences, Freire
and I are partners in conversation.
Ours is a literary conversation, yes,
but even this kind of relationship may
be difficult for some of our current
leaders to comprehend. In our coun
try's politics of exclusion a Gingrich or
a Limbaugh takes others who are sim
ply different and turns them into oppo
nents, opponents who are often seen as
something less than human and there
fore worthy of only slander and blame.
In fact, their political order depends on
the dehumanization of others — view

ing them as creatures that do not love
or hurt like (we hope) they do — to
defend and maintain what they see as
their rightful position of dominance.
Freire's work makes clear, however,
that this hierarchy can only be main
tained if the subjects of economic,
social, and political domination are
kept submerged in a state of silent pas
sivity. He contends that by teaching
oppressed peoples to read and write —
literally giving voice to the suffering —
we can help them discover an aware
ness of self in relation to their sur
roundings. This awareness is the
beginning of knowledge, Freire states,
and with it comes the definitively
human ability to act upon and trans
form the world.
My summary here is too brief and
incomplete to do his work justice, but
what Freire is talking about is educa
tion as a subversive force. He uses
intellectual work — even in its most
elementary forms — as a way to
humanize rather than to abstract in
typical academic fashion. Knowledge
serves as a force for social change,
words function as a currency of power.
For those of us who deal in this cur
rency every day, it is imperative that
we discover the best and most respon
sible way to utilize the force of our
knowledge. One of the complaints I
hear most often from students here at
Stanford is that their work has no rel
evance beyond themselves, that learn
ing seems an isolated and internalized

pursuit. Sometimes it is, but only if we
act solely as detached observers, or as
passive consumers of information. If
we can find a way to link the life of the
mind to principles of love and responsi
bility toward others, then we can —
through our life and work here in the
academy — become active participants
in spiritual and political struggle.
Freire's life is a fine example.
In her book "The Sovereignty of
Good," British philosopher and fiction
writer Iris Murdoch provides another
model. She imagines the individual as
an object moving among other objects,
part of a continuous flow of intention
into action that brings about recogniz
able change in the world. This human
being is not controlled by difference or
limited to one level of a hierarchical
structure; this human being is of and
for the people as they are all joined in a
wide network of mutual responsibility.
Now more than ever, the women and
men of my generation seem to have a
greater awareness of our relationship
to other men and women all over the
world, from the U.S. to Britain to
Brazil. There remains much work to be
done. But ours could be a more gener
ous and collective order, if we can only
use our words and our acts to create it.

Elizabeth Kelly really has read all the
books she quotes in her columns — or
so she says.
