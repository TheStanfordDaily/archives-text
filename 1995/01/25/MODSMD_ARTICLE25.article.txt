## Stanford Japanese Association gathers funds for Kobe 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
As aid pours into Kobe from all over the world,
members of Stanford's Japanese community are
trying to do their part to help the earthquake
rocked city.
The Stanford Japanese Association — a group
made up of people from all over the Stanford com
munity — is pooling its own resources and reach
ing out to the campus at large for funding to aid
the city, which was badly injured in last week's
earthquake.
"We're hoping to raise several thousand dol
lars," estimated Keisuke Kouyama, a post-doctor
al fellow in the Medical Center.
Kouyama said the group is "acting on behalf of
our Japanese colleagues living in the area," and
plans to send the money directly to on-site organi
zations dealing with issues such as medical assis-

tance or aid to schools, instead of through inter
national aid organizations like the Red Cross.
Later this week, the group plans to publicize
the details of how people can donate money, said
Koichi Wago, a graduate student in applied
physics who is helping to organize the effort.
Although there are Stanford students with
family in the Kobe area, Kouyama said he does
not know what news association members have
had from their relatives.
"I haven't heard anything, but the communica
tion system there is still messed up," he said.
Kouyama added that, while the association
might be interested in working with other groups
on campus — such as residences which want to
donate money on their own — its first concern is
to its own efforts.
"Our first action is to get donations from our
membership and the community as a whole," he
said.
