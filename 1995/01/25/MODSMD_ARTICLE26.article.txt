## Plate movements devastate Japan Stress released within earth causes tension on the surface 
### Dev Nag Contributing writer 
The recent earthquake in
Kobe, Japan, struck with unex
pected speed and violent force,
killing thousands and reducing
much of the city to rubble.
Earthquakes are some of the
most studied natural hazards;
they are still not fully understood
by geologists who attempt to pre
dict future quakes and alleviate
the damages.
Imagine holding a plastic ruler
down on a desktop so that half of
it sticks out into space. Now push
down on that half, at the very
end. Either it snaps back up, slip
ping off your finger, or the ruler
breaks. Why? By pushing down
on the end, you have imparted
energy to the ruler that needs to
be released; you have introduced
an element of strain into the
elastic structure of the ruler.
Now imagine two tectonic
plates moving towards one
another, with one pushing
underneath the other, bending it
down. As the ruler analogy

demonstrated, the strain over
comes the friction between the
plates, and energy is released in
the form of an earthquake.
Last week's earthquake in
Kobe, Japan, was a direct result
of this phenomenon. Japan lies
on the eastern edge of the
Eurasian plate, a tectonic plate
that underlies most of Asia. To
the east of the Eurasian plate lie
two plates — the Pacific plate to
the north and the Philippine Sea
plate to the south. As these two
plates move farther west towards
Japan, they undergo subduction
— pushing underneath the
Eurasian plate at an interface
named the Nankai trough.
"The really big earthquakes
happen at the boundary," said
Stanford geologist Gregory
Beroza. Because the two plates to
the east are constantly pushing
underneath Eurasia, the pres
sure mainly builds up — and is
released — at the Nankai trough.
In the 19405, due to this subduc
tion, there were two magnitude
eight earthquakes offshore from
Kobe.

"In addition to that kind of
earthquake, Japan also has
earthquakes that happen within
the plate," Beroza said. "It's not
a case of one plate going under
neath another; it's a case of hori
zontal deformation." The land to
the northwest of Kobe shifted
northeast, and the land to the
southeast moved southwest.
The epicenter was located
between the island of Awajishi
ma and the main island of Hon
shu. The earthquakes started
just offshore from Kobe, and the
aftershocks erupted right under
neath the city. "We don't fully
understand why you get these
earthquakes within a plate,"
Beroza said. Plate tectonics are
much better understood than
movements within a single plate,
he added.
For example, we can measure
how fast Hawaii is moving west
relative to some point on the
eastern United States. Hawaii,
which is on the Pacific plate, is
moving away from the North
American plate at what seems to
be a constant rate. "Plate tecton

ics assumes that these plates are
completely rigid, and of course,
that's an idealization. They're
not rigid, and this last earth
quake is a dramatic example of
that," Beroza explained. Places
where tremors occur within the
plates include India and the east
ern United States.
Just like in California, there
are numerous faults in Japan.
And because Kobe is so close to a
plate boundary, there are many
faults and a great deal of geologi
cal activity in the general area.
"Typically, the very biggest
earthquakes in Japan occur
between and not within plates,"
Beroza explained.
For example, in 1923, an 8.2-
magnitude earthquake near
Tokyo killed more than 120,000
people. This was due to the activ
ity between the plates. The Kobe
earthquake, however, occurred
when one region of the Eurasian
plate slipped about five feet with
respect to another region.
Corresponding to its distance
from the boundary, the earth
quake wasn't as powerful as
some others have been. On the
unified magnitude scale, a cor
rection of the Richter scale, the
Kobe earthquake rated 6.9. In
1946, an earthquake in Nantaido
released more than 100 times as
much energy as did the Tokyo
earthquake described above. "So
most of the deformation is taken
up between the plates," Beroza
noted.
"They Igeologists] knew about
this fault," Beroza said. "But this
was not a large fault — there
were many larger faults nearby."
Was this earthquake predictable
in any way? "Well, they [geolo
gists] had mapped the fault, so
they knew there was the poten
tial for an earthquake," he con
tinued. "That type of informa
tion is pretty reliable; we can tell
just how fast faults are slipping."

This particular fault had been
moving at a millimeter per year,
and suddenly it slipped by a
meter and a half, thereby gener
ating seismic waves.
One reason that movements
within plates are so complex is
that the mathematics are not as
clean as they are in dealing with
two separate plates. Interior
plate deformation cannot be
measured as easily as the tecton
ic plate movement of Hawaii
described above, for example.
"When you slowly strain an area,
you can kind of see that strain
building up," Beroza said. "But
in places like this, where it's a
millimeter per year, it takes a
long, long time to see that sig
nal."
The subduction at the Nankai
trough strains the Eurasian
plate, and not all of that energy
can be released at the trough
itself. When a boundary earth
quake occurs, the coast actually
snaps up a little bit as the
Eurasian plate bounces back to
its original conformation. But
further inland, the only way to

release that energy is through
activity around faults.
Recall the ruler analogy — if
the ruler has a crack in it some
where, it's likely to break there
to relieve the strain before it can
snap back up. In the same way,
shifting around these faults —
which we experience as earth
quakes — will release some of the
strain that was not released at
the Nankai trough.
Some scientists claim that
Kobe wasn't as well protected as
it could have been, and that the
buildings were not as earthquake
resistant as they should have
been. "Buildings are designed to
withstand vertical loads," Beroza
said. "Buildings are not designed
to withstand horizontal loads.
Unfortunately, in earthquakes
you get both."
For example, in California
much earthquake damage results
from houses shifting on their
foundations. "Probably the most
important thing is to bolt your
house to the foundations," he
warned. "But nothing is earth
quake-proof."

they knew there was the poten
tial for an earthquake," he con
tinued. "That type of informa
tion is pretty reliable; we can tell
just how fast faults are slipping."

This particular fault had been
moving at a millimeter per year,
and suddenly it slipped by a
meter and a half, thereby gener
ating seismic waves.
One reason that movements
within plates are so complex is
that the mathematics are not as
clean as they are in dealing with
two separate plates. Interior
plate deformation cannot be
measured as easily as the tecton
ic plate movement of Hawaii
described above, for example.
"When you slowly strain an area,
you can kind of see that strain
building up," Beroza said. "But
in places like this, where it's a
millimeter per year, it takes a
long, long time to see that sig
nal."
The subduction at the Nankai
trough strains the Eurasian
plate, and not all of that energy
can be released at the trough
itself. When a boundary earth
quake occurs, the coast actually
snaps up a little bit as the
Eurasian plate bounces back to
its original conformation. But
further inland, the only way to

release that energy is through
activity around faults.
Recall the ruler analogy — if
the ruler has a crack in it some
where, it's likely to break there
to relieve the strain before it can
snap back up. In the same way,
shifting around these faults —
which we experience as earth
quakes — will release some of the
strain that was not released at
the Nankai trough.
Some scientists claim that
Kobe wasn't as well protected as
it could have been, and that the
buildings were not as earthquake
resistant as they should have
been. "Buildings are designed to
withstand vertical loads," Beroza
said. "Buildings are not designed
to withstand horizontal loads.
Unfortunately, in earthquakes
you get both."
For example, in California
much earthquake damage results
from houses shifting on their
foundations. "Probably the most
important thing is to bolt your
house to the foundations," he
warned. "But nothing is earth
quake-proof."

The recent earthquake in
Kobe, Japan, struck with unex
pected speed and violent force,
killing thousands and reducing
much of the city to rubble.
Earthquakes are some of the
most studied natural hazards;
they are still not fully understood
by geologists who attempt to pre
dict future quakes and alleviate
the damages.
Imagine holding a plastic ruler
down on a desktop so that half of
it sticks out into space. Now push
down on that half, at the very
end. Either it snaps back up, slip
ping off your finger, or the ruler
breaks. Why? By pushing down
on the end, you have imparted
energy to the ruler that needs to
be released; you have introduced
an element of strain into the
elastic structure of the ruler.
Now imagine two tectonic
plates moving towards one
another, with one pushing
underneath the other, bending it
down. As the ruler analogy

demonstrated, the strain over
comes the friction between the
plates, and energy is released in
the form of an earthquake.
Last week's earthquake in
Kobe, Japan, was a direct result
of this phenomenon. Japan lies
on the eastern edge of the
Eurasian plate, a tectonic plate
that underlies most of Asia. To
the east of the Eurasian plate lie
two plates — the Pacific plate to
the north and the Philippine Sea
plate to the south. As these two
plates move farther west towards
Japan, they undergo subduction
— pushing underneath the
Eurasian plate at an interface
named the Nankai trough.
"The really big earthquakes
happen at the boundary," said
Stanford geologist Gregory
Beroza. Because the two plates to
the east are constantly pushing
underneath Eurasia, the pres
sure mainly builds up — and is
released — at the Nankai trough.
In the 19405, due to this subduc
tion, there were two magnitude
eight earthquakes offshore from
Kobe.

"In addition to that kind of
earthquake, Japan also has
earthquakes that happen within
the plate," Beroza said. "It's not
a case of one plate going under
neath another; it's a case of hori
zontal deformation." The land to
the northwest of Kobe shifted
northeast, and the land to the
southeast moved southwest.
The epicenter was located
between the island of Awajishi
ma and the main island of Hon
shu. The earthquakes started
just offshore from Kobe, and the
aftershocks erupted right under
neath the city. "We don't fully
understand why you get these
earthquakes within a plate,"
Beroza said. Plate tectonics are
much better understood than
movements within a single plate,
he added.
For example, we can measure
how fast Hawaii is moving west
relative to some point on the
eastern United States. Hawaii,
which is on the Pacific plate, is
moving away from the North
American plate at what seems to
be a constant rate. "Plate tecton

ics assumes that these plates are
completely rigid, and of course,
that's an idealization. They're
not rigid, and this last earth
quake is a dramatic example of
that," Beroza explained. Places
where tremors occur within the
plates include India and the east
ern United States.
Just like in California, there
are numerous faults in Japan.
And because Kobe is so close to a
plate boundary, there are many
faults and a great deal of geologi
cal activity in the general area.
"Typically, the very biggest
earthquakes in Japan occur
between and not within plates,"
Beroza explained.
For example, in 1923, an 8.2-
magnitude earthquake near
Tokyo killed more than 120,000
people. This was due to the activ
ity between the plates. The Kobe
earthquake, however, occurred
when one region of the Eurasian
plate slipped about five feet with
respect to another region.
Corresponding to its distance
from the boundary, the earth
quake wasn't as powerful as
some others have been. On the
unified magnitude scale, a cor
rection of the Richter scale, the
Kobe earthquake rated 6.9. In
1946, an earthquake in Nantaido
released more than 100 times as
much energy as did the Tokyo
earthquake described above. "So
most of the deformation is taken
up between the plates," Beroza
noted.
"They Igeologists] knew about
this fault," Beroza said. "But this
was not a large fault — there
were many larger faults nearby."
Was this earthquake predictable
in any way? "Well, they [geolo
gists] had mapped the fault, so
they knew there was the poten
tial for an earthquake," he con
tinued. "That type of informa
tion is pretty reliable; we can tell
just how fast faults are slipping."

This particular fault had been
moving at a millimeter per year,
and suddenly it slipped by a
meter and a half, thereby gener
ating seismic waves.
