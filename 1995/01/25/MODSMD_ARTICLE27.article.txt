Q, "How do you make a wine
glass sing by rubbing
around the edge ? "
— Musically challenged
A : I imagine most of you have
JLAseen this done on late night
TV talk shows at least once in
your life - you know, the guy who
has a table covered with wine
glasses and plays Beethoven's
Ninth.
For those of you who haven't
seen this trick, the stunt behind
converting a wine glass into a
'whine' glass is to wet your finger
and then run it around the edge
of the glass. An eerie moaning
sound that seems to be coming
out of nowhere results from this

motion. Yes kids, you
can tiy this at home
— the one catch is
that you need real
crystal, so chances are
you'll be at some
fancy function and
you can really impress
everyone with your
acoustic prowess.
The trick to this is
that, although it
seems like you're
rubbing your fmger
over a smooth sur
face, the nm of the
glas*" _wi,ually has

millions of sharp bumps and
ridges on the microscopic scale.
As you slide your finger along, it
catches on these irregularities
and provides a slight tug on the
rim. Although each tug is unbe
lievably small, they add up to
the sound you hear.
But it gets even more exciting.
So far, we have oscillations —
longitudinal vibrations — going
along the rim of the glass. How
ever, these oscillations aren't sta
ble given the geometry of the
glass, so they turn into trans
verse oscillations — the walls of
the glass move in and out, instead
of back and forth.
As the walls move in and out,
they have to push around the liq
uid of whatever beverage your
glass contains. The more liquid
there is the longer it takes to
slosh back and forth. This defines
the natural frequency at which
the glass will ring.
Your finger needs to be wet so

that it can slide somewhat
smoothly across the rim. In order
to generate an audible tone, you
have to continuously stimulate
the rim. If the surface isn't lubri
cated, your fmger will stop and
start, damping any vibrations
that may have started.
You also must have good crys
tal, because otherwise the oscilla
tions in the glass will damp more
quickly. If you've ever noticed, if
you tap a good wine glass, it will
ring for a long time.
This happens because the reg
ular arrangement of molecules in
good crystal conducts the vibra
tions well, like a wave traveling
across a smooth pool. However,
glass with impurities and irregu
larities will damp the vibrations,
like a wave traveling across a
cesspool covered with junk.

Since I have a little
spare room, I figured I'd
share a little tidbit I dis
covered in the course of
my research. There real
ly are reasons why dif
ferent drinks Eire served
in different glasses:
champagne in cham
pagne flutes, brandy in
brandy snifters, hard
liquor in brown paper
bags.
Actually, there are
three main reasons. First,
glasses are designed to
enhance the appearance

of the drink. For example, cham
pagne flutes are long to show off
the fancy bubbles.
Another is to accentuate the
bouquet of the drink. Burgundy
glasses are wide at the base and
taper at the top, in order to cap
ture the fruity aroma right above
the surface.
But most important is 'rim
technology.' As you probably
know, your tongue has four
types of taste buds — sweet,
salty, acid, and bitter — central
ized on different portions of the
tongue. Glasses are actually
designed so that the drink lands
on die appropriate part of the
tongue to enhance the desired
taste. For instance, wines that
are meant to be fruity should
land on the tip of the tongue
where the sweet taste will be per
ceived.
Of course, I don't know what
to say if you drink wine that
comes out of a box.
