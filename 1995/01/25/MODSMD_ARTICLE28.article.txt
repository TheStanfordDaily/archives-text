# Stanford land feeds, houses birds of prey

A large, powerful hawk soars
through the sky; it spots a perch
from which to hunt and swoops
down. Almost immediately, a young
ground squirrel darts across the
bird's path — easy prey.
The hawk pounces on the squir
rel and devours it. However, the
squirrel — considered vermin on
many college campuses — has been
poisoned; as a result, the bird may
die as well.
In the event of injury to raptors,
or birds of prey, the Wildlife Rescue
will summon a member of the rap
tor team. On Stanford campus,
Karen Hoyt will likely answer the
call to assist the injured bird.
Hoyt, an accountant in the pedi
atrics department at Stanford Hos
pital, is a volunteer for the Wildlife
Rescue and a seven-year veteran of
the raptor team, which specializes
in treating birds of prey — hawks,
falcons, kites, owls and eagles. After
rehabilitation, the birds are released
on the western edge of Stanford
campus near the stables and golf
course.
The large, open spaces offer
hunting grounds with abundant
prey for the birds, and there is suffi
cient tree cover for roosting, nesting
and protecting them from the ele
ments.

Although much of the area is
developed, raptors have adapted
surprisingly well. For example, a
pair of barn owls often nests in
Hoover Tower, and raptors like red
tailed hawks commonly perch on
light posts along El Camino.
As a result of their natural
behavior, raptors are particularly
vulnerable to injury by humans. "I
would say 98 percent of the injuries
that come in are man-made," Hoyt

estimated. "Guns, poison and cars
primarily," she added.
Raptors have been known to
prey on domestic animals; many
shotgun injuries to raptors are
caused by people who feel their ani
mals are threatened. The birds can
also be harmed by consuming small
rodents and pigeons that have been
poisoned in an attempt to control
their population.
Raptors lose nesting sites when

trees are pruned or cut down. For
example, barn owls driven from
their homes in large oaks have
resorted to nesting between the
fronds of palm trees. When the
chicks hatch and start to move
around, they can easily fall out of
the nest and be orphaned.
Perhaps the most common
threat is the automobile. Hoyt sees

The Stanford golf course offers a home to raptors like barn owls that need a safe environment to recov
er from injury.
