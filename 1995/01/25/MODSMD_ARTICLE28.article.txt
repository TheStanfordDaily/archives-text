# Stanford land feeds, houses birds of prey

A large, powerful hawk soars
through the sky; it spots a perch
from which to hunt and swoops
down. Almost immediately, a young
ground squirrel darts across the
bird's path — easy prey.
The hawk pounces on the squir
rel and devours it. However, the
squirrel — considered vermin on
many college campuses — has been
poisoned; as a result, the bird may
die as well.
In the event of injury to raptors,
or birds of prey, the Wildlife Rescue
will summon a member of the rap
tor team. On Stanford campus,
Karen Hoyt will likely answer the
call to assist the injured bird.
Hoyt, an accountant in the pedi
atrics department at Stanford Hos
pital, is a volunteer for the Wildlife
Rescue and a seven-year veteran of
the raptor team, which specializes
in treating birds of prey — hawks,
falcons, kites, owls and eagles. After
rehabilitation, the birds are released
on the western edge of Stanford
campus near the stables and golf
course.
The large, open spaces offer
hunting grounds with abundant
prey for the birds, and there is suffi
cient tree cover for roosting, nesting
and protecting them from the ele
ments.

Although much of the area is
developed, raptors have adapted
surprisingly well. For example, a
pair of barn owls often nests in
Hoover Tower, and raptors like red
tailed hawks commonly perch on
light posts along El Camino.
As a result of their natural
behavior, raptors are particularly
vulnerable to injury by humans. "I
would say 98 percent of the injuries
that come in are man-made," Hoyt

estimated. "Guns, poison and cars
primarily," she added.
Raptors have been known to
prey on domestic animals; many
shotgun injuries to raptors are
caused by people who feel their ani
mals are threatened. The birds can
also be harmed by consuming small
rodents and pigeons that have been
poisoned in an attempt to control
their population.
Raptors lose nesting sites when

trees are pruned or cut down. For
example, barn owls driven from
their homes in large oaks have
resorted to nesting between the
fronds of palm trees. When the
chicks hatch and start to move
around, they can easily fall out of
the nest and be orphaned.
Perhaps the most common
threat is the automobile. Hoyt sees

The Stanford golf course offers a home to raptors like barn owls that need a safe environment to recov
er from injury.
ncreasing numbers of birds
brought in as a result of collisions
with cars. The grassy margins and
medians of roads and freeways fre
quently provide excellent habitats
for squirrels, mice and gophers, and
consequently make good hunting
grounds for raptors. While hunting,
the birds fly low to the ground
where they may be hit by approach
ing cars.
The main purpose of the raptor

team is to raise, rehabilitate and
release the animals, Hoyt said.
When injured raptors are first
reported to the Wildlife Rescue, the
birds may be taken to the shelter at
4000 Middlefield Road in Palo Alto.
The shelter contains a number of
boxes which temporarily house ani
mals. The facility is mainly a triage
center where injuries are assessed
and the proper treatment deter
mined; the raptors are later placed
in the homes of volunteers.
During the initial stages of recov
eiy, raptors are fed dead animals,
like mice from Stanford laborato
ries. Once a bird has recovered suffi
ciently from its injury, 'dead food' is

gradually decreased, while increas
ing numbers of live mice are intro
duced into the aviary.
If the bird is able to catch live
prey and maintain its weight for two
to three weeks, it may be moved to
an aviary with more room to exer
cise its wings. Raptors' wing mus
cles quickly atrophy in captivity.
During this time, the bird's flight is
carefully monitored to make sure
that it can maintain its balance
without favoring one wing over the
other.
Captives with injured wings may
be taken out to fly using a creance
— a long rope attached to the bird's
legs — in order to strengthen the

injured wing before release. This
may be especially important for
larger raptors who are unable to
exercise adequately in any size of
cage.
In order to determine how the
raptors survive after release, Hoyt
has obtained a special permit to
band the raptors freed by Wildlife
Rescue. Placing a small metal band
around the left leg of each bird
allows her to track the progress of
some birds after they are released.
The tracking requires that the
body of the bird be found and the
band returned, or that the number
on a live bird be observed and
reported. The bands do not trans-

Mit radio waves.
Band returns are usually sparse,
but Hoyt has been fortunate; she
has banded 160 birds in the last five
years and received ten band
returns.
A number of these are success
stories. One of Hoyt's first band
returns was from a red-tailed hawk
released in Palo Alto after recover
ing from poisoning. The bird was
found a year later in Oregon. Anoth
er red-tailed hawk is now living near
Escondido Village and recently
fledged three young.
"We know they're hunting and
reproducing, and that is what
prompted the telemetry project,"

Hoyt said. The project she is refer
ring to would allow her to release
barn owls with radio transmitters
attached to them. The transmitters
would enable Hoyt and other mem
bers of the raptor team to track the
progress of the released birds. "We
want to know what kind of places
these birds choose to roost, what
they do during their active hours
and how far they go," Hoyt added.
It is important that these kinds
of questions be addressed in order
for the raptor team to determine
whether Stanford campus is still a
suitable place to release barn owls
or whether the area is already satu
rated with the birds.
