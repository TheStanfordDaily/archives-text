# Drug may fight parasite in AIDS patients
## Acid inhibits enzyme necessary for parasites' metabolism

Researchers have discovered a chemical
compound that could be used to fight the dis
ease toxoplasmosis — a parasitic infection that
can be fatal to those who suffer from poor
immune systems, including AIDS patients.
Dr. Tag Mansour, professor of molecular
pharmacology at Stanford University School of
Medicine, is part of a team that recently pub
lished these findings in the Journal of Biomed
ical Pharmacology.
Although the protozoan toxoplasma gondii
can be found in 25 to 35 percent of the world's
population, it remains dormant and thus harm
less as long as the patient has a strong immune
system. However, toxoplasmosis severely
attacks the central nervous system and causes
neurological abnormalities in people with
weakened immune systems. Between 3 and 10
percent of AIDS patients in the United States
contract toxoplasmosis, which is transmitted
through raw or under-cooked meats, unwashed
vegetables, soil and cats.
Dru£,3 currently used to treat toxoplasmosis
are ineffective. Because the parasite is
extremely similar to mammalian cells, most
drugs that damage toxoplasma are also detri
mental to human cells, Mansour explained.

While studying how the parasite metabolizes
sugar in order to obtain energy, Mansour and
his fellow research scientists discovered that
the way in which toxoplasma gondii chemically
breaks down sugar differs in an essential step
from the method used by human cells. During
glycolysis, the protozoa uses the enzyme phos
phofructokinase to catalyze the addition of
another phosphate.
This enzyme, Mansour explained, is only
found in the most primitive organisms. The
researchers were astonished to discover its use
by toxoplasma. Human cells use adenosine
triphosphate (ATP); however, toxoplasma
gondii cannot use ATP as the source of phos
phates. "This difference in enzyme is a wonder
ful opportunity," Mansour explained. "It can be
used as a target by which we can get to the par
asite without affecting the patient," he added.
If Mansour and his colleagues could find a
chemical that harmed the enzyme phospho
fructokinase, which is necessary to the para
site's energy production, they would be able
essentially to starve the protozoa. After four
years of research, they have identified a group
of chemical compounds for this purpose.
By using analogs of pyrophosphate — the
chemical compound group of diphosphonates
— Mansour hopes to "fool the enzyme." These

diphosphonates are more toxic to the parasite's
energy production systems than to the host. In
test tube experiments so far, the researchers
have found that carbonyldiphosphonic acid is
most successful in reducing the enzyme's activ
ity.
The team's next step in fighting toxoplasmo
sis is to identify a single compound that best
inhibits the parasite's enzyme phosphofructok
inase. At present, they need to synthesize this
enzyme in mass quantities in order to test var
ious chemical compounds as inhibitors. Accord
ing to Mansour, the most effective way to cre
ate mass quantities is by cloning the enzyme in
bacteria.
Mansour believes there is not enough
awareness or interest in the scientific and aca
demic communities about protozoan infec
tions. He attributes the American govern
ment's interest in his research concerning tox
oplasma gondii to its lethal connection with
AIDS.
Although parasitic infections affect three
billion people worldwide, mostly in developing
countries, Mansour refers to them as the
"neglected diseases." Parasitic infections,
including toxoplasmosis and malaria, are
among the most widespread and dangerous
human illnesses.
