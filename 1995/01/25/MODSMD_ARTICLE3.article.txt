# Applications up 5 percent
## Montoya attributes increase to economic concerns, grad school ambitions, recruiting, improved image

Statistically speaking, getting a
spot in Stanford's next freshman
class will be harder than it has
been in the last six years.
Increasing about 5 percent
from last year to become the high
est total in six years, this year's ap
plications numbered 15,260, com
pared to 14,551 last year, accord
ing to James Montoya, dean of ad
missions and financial aid. Female
applicants also rose from 46.4 per
cent last year to 48.3 percent this
year.
Montoya attributed the rise in
the number of applications to sev
eral factors.
Applicants' concerns about
their future economic well being
— and their belief that a Stanford
degree will help ensure their fi
nancial security — have con
tributed to the increase in applica
tions, he said.
"More students are con
cerned about their futures and
as a result they are doing more

thinking about the quality of
college education," Montoya
said. "One big change is the
number of high school students
who are already looking on to
graduate school.
This stems from the economic
pressures that students have seen

their parents and older siblings'
experience."
Stanford does well with stu
dents who are feeling these pres
sures because it "has a quality of
prestige that is appealing as stu

dents are thinking about maxi
mizing their future," Montoya
said. "Academically talented stu
dents are driven to seek out what
they see as the best and Stanford
fits this description."
Also, strong recruitment
efforts and more positive coverage
of Stanford in the media — as
compared to a few years ago,
when the indirect costs scandal
was at its height — were factors

in the increase of applications,
Montoya said.
Accordingly, the admissions
office was not surprised by this
year's rise in applications.
"We anticipated that we would
have an increased number of
applications because there was
an increased number of
inquirants and a larger number
of students submitting their SAT
scores to Stanford," he said.
"The higher number of [female
applicants] makes sense given
the make-up of students taking
the SAT."
Also, he said, there has been a

rise in the number of students vis
iting campus during the summer.
"Students who visit usually apply,"
Montoya said. "Stanford as an
institution is well-received by visi
tors for its beauty and resources
obvious to students and parents."
Although more women applied
this year than last year, this year's
rise won't necessarily alter the
make-up of next year's freshmen
class, Montoya said.
"Given the fact that the appli
cation pool is so well balanced
and so diverse, we are able to
focus on the qualities students
bring rather than categories," he

said. "Last year women were
admitted at a higher rate, but
this was not a conscious decision;
rather last year the [best] stu
dents who surfaced happened to
be women."
Nationally, Montoya said, a
gap exists between the number of
male and female college students.
Forty-five percent of students are
men, while 55 percent are
women.
Montoya said that he expects
this rift to expand in future years
as 53 percent of SAT takers this
year were women, a figure which
is increasing, he said.
