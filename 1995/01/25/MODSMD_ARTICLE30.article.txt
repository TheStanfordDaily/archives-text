## The 						big man hits the Stanford courts At seven-foot-one, the only thing freshman center Tim Young lacks is a lofty attitude 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Remarkable changes have been happening
in the landscape of Stanford's men's basket
ball. Only two years ago, the land was a barren
desert which reaped a harvest of just seven
wins over an entire season. Then last year, a
young freshman point guard named Brevin
Knight set foot on the Farm and turned the
Pacific 10 Conference on its ear, leading the
Cardinal to 17 wins.
Since then, the sky's been the limit. Today,
the erstwhile desert has been rejuvenated,
transformed into a lush, fertile valley bearing
fruits of a 12-2 record and national ranking of
17. And this year too, a precocious freshman
has led the charge.
With all the big things happening though,
it's not a surprise that a big reason for the big
season is a big player called Big Tim.
There's little else that comes to mind at
first when looking at seven-foot-one freshman
center Tim Young. Simply put, the man is big.
His hands could probably juggle watermel
ons like apples. His size 17 feet make Side-
Show Bob's look like Tinkerbell's. And with
out question, he certainly has the game to go
along with his stature.
Young leads the Cardinal in rebounding
and blocks averaging 8.1 caroms and 1.6 rejec
tions a game. Add to that his 10.8 points per
game, along with the fact that he's a freshman
still learning and maturing, and it's easy to see
why Young is a big piece of the Cardinal's
future.
"He's going to be a great player for us," said
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery. "Tim
is as talented a big man as we've had in a long
time. We don't want to put too much pressure
on him early. Explosion, strength and experi
ence will be assets with continued work."
But Young seems a bit uncomfortable with
such a grandiose label. Big or small, the thing
that's most important in his mind is to con
tribute.
"I don't have to be the leading scorer,"
Young said. "I want to contribute more than
two points per game. I want to have an impact,
but I'm not pressured into being a dominant
player yet even though that's what I want to
become. It's been a gradual process. It's not a
pressured environment, so I'm very comfort
able."
Comfort is important for Young. After all,
like any freshman, he still needs to adjust to
college. It's just that in Young's case, the
freshman in question is also one of the top
five freshmen centers in the nation. But
underneath all that "bigness," he's still just a
small-town kid that prefers biking to driving,
the Beatles to the Beastie Boys, the Boston
Celtics to the Orlando Magic, and Larry Bird
to Larry Johnson. He chose Stanford over
such luminaries as UCLA and Arizona. His
lights are off at 9:30, and his best friend is his
sister.
"The main reason for coming to Stanford
was that it's real close to my home town," said
Young. "I just wanted to stay close to my fam

ily so that my sister and my family can go to
the games.
"I'm really close to my sister. That was one
of the big reasons for coming here. She's the
biggest influence in my life. She's always sup
ported me and has always been there for me
when I haven't been in a good mood or happy.
She's always been there."
The lifelong native of the sleepy, beachside
city of Santa Cruz is a throwback plain and
simple.
"I'm proudest of the person my son is,"
says Greg, Young's father. "He's introspec
tive, real sensitive to other people's feelings.
He writes poetry, listens to Paul Simon and
the Beatles. He's not much into the new
crap."
Young sees a lot of this "new crap" as a gen
eral lack of respect these days by players for

floor you should show

the game of basketball. He would much rather
see the game go back to the days of Chuck Tay
lors and the Big O instead of Air Jordans and
Shaq-Fu, a time when players played and rap
pers rapped.
"Players are obligated to pay their respects
to the game," Young said. "Whenever you step
on the floor you should show respect for the
game and play as hard as you can.
"From my own perspective, players these
days are more concerned about contracts and
negotiations rather than just being on a team
and doing what they can to win a champi
onship. It bothers me. Players in the '40s and
'50s hardly made anything, and you didn't
hear them complaining about much. Our soci
ety's becoming more obsessed with money and
that's how we judge ourselves, by how much
money we earn. It's filtering into sports, which
is kind of sad."
It's that kind of fervent, genuine belief in
the game of basketball that has made Young
into the player he is.
"I hope he never changes," Montgomery
said. "He's got a tremendous work ethic. And
if he makes a mistake, he'll bust his tail. His
answer to frustration is to sprint to the other
end of the floor.
"He gets nervous though sometimes. It's
not bad. He just really puts a lot of pressure on
himself. He wants to do well, and he wants to
make every shot, and that's just not going to
happen. I have to make sure he doesn't get
down on himself."
Young's latest frustrations have been with
his rebounding, just 5.4 over the last five
games, and foul trouble.
"I don't know what's going on with my
rebounding," Young said. "I have to start pur
suing the ball more aggressively, and get into

the frame of mind that every shot
that goes up is going to be my
rebound because the team needs a
good rebounder."
As for the fouls, Montgomery
believes a big reason is pure inexpe
rience.
"He just needs to get some more
experience and learn to know what
to do in certain situations when dif
ferent teams change things up,"
Montgomery said.
Young though, characteristical
ly, won't let it go that easily. He
believes that the responsibility is
still on him.
"I should make a goal to make it
through the first half without get
ting three fouls," Young said. "A lot
of them are really dumb fouls on

my part. I just have to think a little
bit more when I'm out there
instead of getting wrapped up in
playing a glamorous team like Ari
zona or something.
"Before I came to college I saw
these guys on television. You see
them and you don't really see them
as people, but once you're out there
you realize that they're just people
too. They have to put on their uni
forms, tie their shoelaces. Just like
the rest of us. They're not gods or
anything. I'm getting used to it. But
that's part of the fun, playing
against really great players."
That's the beauty of Young. He
still plays for the fun. And little else
can be more fun than battling Cal
at Harmon Arena, a rite of passage
in recent years that has left a bitter
taste in the mouths of many Cardi
nal players. But a victory last week
has left a sugary sweet taste for
Young. His eyes light up like an
exuberant child's when recounting

the triumph over much despised
Cal, a game in which fans heckled
him to death, flashing blown up
copies of a not-so-pretty Young gri
mace. The pictures came from a
media photo of an intense Young
protecting the ball, but that didn't
alleviate any of the hurt from the
caption, "Another Geek Hits the
Floor."
"We beat Cal!" extols Young.
"That was great! Those pictures
they had of me were kind of brutal,
but I got over that. They kind of
motivated me and got me into the
game. It was fun having all those
people yell at me. It felt good to shut
them up."
Like any kid, though, who plays
the game with love and enthusi
asm, Young holds close to his heart
the dream of many young hoop
sters all over the world, to play in
basketball's ultimate forum, the
NBA.
"I'm thinking about the NBA,

but I just want to take it one step at
a time," said Young. "This whole
college experience is enough for me
right now. I'll just worry about the
NBA later, but it's a dream of mine
definitely."
Whether or not the dream will
be realized remains to be seen, but
there's no question about his
potential and his future here. The
Cardinal offense, which has thrived
in recent years on perimeter sharp
shooting, is slowly but surely
adjusting to the inside strength
Young provides.
"I can already tell he's going to
be a great player for this program,
the way Coach has the offense set
up," said Stanford guard David
Harbour. "It's ideal for Tim. I'll tell
you this: it's fun to play with him.
He's got a great attitude right now,
and he just wants to get better. He's
got everything to be great player."
There have been knocks against
Young. Some say he's too much

finesse, not enough explosion. But
despite what many critics say about
Young, keep in mind that a hook
shot still counts as much as a dunk.
"I'm a little bit of both, physical
and finesse," Young said. "I can
adapt to either style. If I have to run
the court and shoot hook shots, I
can do that. Or I can pound the ball
in and take it real strong. I just take
whatever the defense gives. Usually
the defense won't let me charge in
there and go for a dunk so I have to
shoot a hook shot. So if that's called
finesse, then it's whatever it takes
to get the job done. I don't really
care what they say about my game."
Apparently Young hasn't heard
what Virginia head coach Jeff Jones
has been saying. Against Virginia's
big front line, Young pulled down
12 rebounds and created havoc for
the Cavalier offense.
"We missed a lot of shots around
the basket, and I have to credit Tim
Young," Jones said. "He is very

physical down there. We came away
without baskets and without fouls,
and he was the main reason."
With play like that, Young has
gained yet another moniker to add
to his ever growing collection of
aliases. The name of the month is
T-Rex, courtesy of senior forward
Andy Poppink, no doubt referring
to Young's tenacious defense and
all-around ferocity and enthusiasm.
"It really cracked me up," Young
said. "It's nothing I'd like to be
called all the time, but it's funny."
On a recent road trip to the Uni
versity of Washington to face the
Huskies, Young gazed with his big
(what else?), starry eyes at the Seat
tle Kingdom, site of this year's
Final Four, and whispered, "We're
coming back here in April."
So in April, just maybe, Cardinal
basketball will transform the King
dom into their own Jurassic Park,
featuring Stanford's very own T-
Rex.

the dream of many young hoop
sters all over the world, to play in
basketball's ultimate forum, the
NBA.
"I'm thinking about the NBA,

but I just want to take it one step at
a time," said Young. "This whole
college experience is enough for me
right now. I'll just worry about the
NBA later, but it's a dream of mine
definitely."
Whether or not the dream will
be realized remains to be seen, but
there's no question about his
potential and his future here. The
Cardinal offense, which has thrived
in recent years on perimeter sharp
shooting, is slowly but surely
adjusting to the inside strength
Young provides.
"I can already tell he's going to
be a great player for this program,
the way Coach has the offense set
up," said Stanford guard David
Harbour. "It's ideal for Tim. I'll tell
you this: it's fun to play with him.
He's got a great attitude right now,
and he just wants to get better. He's
got everything to be great player."
There have been knocks against
Young. Some say he's too much

finesse, not enough explosion. But
despite what many critics say about
Young, keep in mind that a hook
shot still counts as much as a dunk.
"I'm a little bit of both, physical
and finesse," Young said. "I can
adapt to either style. If I have to run
the court and shoot hook shots, I
can do that. Or I can pound the ball
in and take it real strong. I just take
whatever the defense gives. Usually
the defense won't let me charge in
there and go for a dunk so I have to
shoot a hook shot. So if that's called
finesse, then it's whatever it takes
to get the job done. I don't really
care what they say about my game."
Apparently Young hasn't heard
what Virginia head coach Jeff Jones
has been saying. Against Virginia's
big front line, Young pulled down
12 rebounds and created havoc for
the Cavalier offense.
"We missed a lot of shots around
the basket, and I have to credit Tim
Young," Jones said. "He is very

physical down there. We came away
without baskets and without fouls,
and he was the main reason."
With play like that, Young has
gained yet another moniker to add
to his ever growing collection of
aliases. The name of the month is
T-Rex, courtesy of senior forward
Andy Poppink, no doubt referring
to Young's tenacious defense and
all-around ferocity and enthusiasm.
"It really cracked me up," Young
said. "It's nothing I'd like to be
called all the time, but it's funny."
On a recent road trip to the Uni
versity of Washington to face the
Huskies, Young gazed with his big
(what else?), starry eyes at the Seat
tle Kingdom, site of this year's
Final Four, and whispered, "We're
coming back here in April."
So in April, just maybe, Cardinal
basketball will transform the King
dom into their own Jurassic Park,
featuring Stanford's very own T-
Rex.
Remarkable changes have been happening
in the landscape of Stanford's men's basket
ball. Only two years ago, the land was a barren
desert which reaped a harvest of just seven
wins over an entire season. Then last year, a
young freshman point guard named Brevin
Knight set foot on the Farm and turned the
Pacific 10 Conference on its ear, leading the
Cardinal to 17 wins.
Since then, the sky's been the limit. Today,
the erstwhile desert has been rejuvenated,
transformed into a lush, fertile valley bearing
fruits of a 12-2 record and national ranking of
17. And this year too, a precocious freshman
has led the charge.
With all the big things happening though,
it's not a surprise that a big reason for the big
season is a big player called Big Tim.
There's little else that comes to mind at
first when looking at seven-foot-one freshman
center Tim Young. Simply put, the man is big.
His hands could probably juggle watermel
ons like apples. His size 17 feet make Side-
Show Bob's look like Tinkerbell's. And with
out question, he certainly has the game to go
along with his stature.
Young leads the Cardinal in rebounding
and blocks averaging 8.1 caroms and 1.6 rejec
tions a game. Add to that his 10.8 points per
game, along with the fact that he's a freshman
still learning and maturing, and it's easy to see
why Young is a big piece of the Cardinal's
future.
"He's going to be a great player for us," said
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery. "Tim
is as talented a big man as we've had in a long
time. We don't want to put too much pressure
on him early. Explosion, strength and experi
ence will be assets with continued work."
But Young seems a bit uncomfortable with
such a grandiose label. Big or small, the thing
that's most important in his mind is to con
tribute.
"I don't have to be the leading scorer,"
Young said. "I want to contribute more than
two points per game. I want to have an impact,
but I'm not pressured into being a dominant
player yet even though that's what I want to
become. It's been a gradual process. It's not a
pressured environment, so I'm very comfort
able."
Comfort is important for Young. After all,
like any freshman, he still needs to adjust to
college. It's just that in Young's case, the
freshman in question is also one of the top
five freshmen centers in the nation. But
underneath all that "bigness," he's still just a
small-town kid that prefers biking to driving,
the Beatles to the Beastie Boys, the Boston
Celtics to the Orlando Magic, and Larry Bird
to Larry Johnson. He chose Stanford over
such luminaries as UCLA and Arizona. His
lights are off at 9:30, and his best friend is his
sister.
"The main reason for coming to Stanford
was that it's real close to my home town," said
Young. "I just wanted to stay close to my fam

ily so that my sister and my family can go to
the games.
"I'm really close to my sister. That was one
of the big reasons for coming here. She's the
biggest influence in my life. She's always sup
ported me and has always been there for me
when I haven't been in a good mood or happy.
She's always been there."
The lifelong native of the sleepy, beachside
city of Santa Cruz is a throwback plain and
simple.
"I'm proudest of the person my son is,"
says Greg, Young's father. "He's introspec
tive, real sensitive to other people's feelings.
He writes poetry, listens to Paul Simon and
the Beatles. He's not much into the new
crap."
Young sees a lot of this "new crap" as a gen
eral lack of respect these days by players for

floor you should show

the game of basketball. He would much rather
see the game go back to the days of Chuck Tay
lors and the Big O instead of Air Jordans and
Shaq-Fu, a time when players played and rap
pers rapped.
"Players are obligated to pay their respects
to the game," Young said. "Whenever you step
on the floor you should show respect for the
game and play as hard as you can.
"From my own perspective, players these
days are more concerned about contracts and
negotiations rather than just being on a team
and doing what they can to win a champi
onship. It bothers me. Players in the '40s and
'50s hardly made anything, and you didn't
hear them complaining about much. Our soci
ety's becoming more obsessed with money and
that's how we judge ourselves, by how much
money we earn. It's filtering into sports, which
is kind of sad."
It's that kind of fervent, genuine belief in
the game of basketball that has made Young
into the player he is.
"I hope he never changes," Montgomery
said. "He's got a tremendous work ethic. And
if he makes a mistake, he'll bust his tail. His
answer to frustration is to sprint to the other
end of the floor.
"He gets nervous though sometimes. It's
not bad. He just really puts a lot of pressure on
himself. He wants to do well, and he wants to
make every shot, and that's just not going to
happen. I have to make sure he doesn't get
down on himself."
Young's latest frustrations have been with
his rebounding, just 5.4 over the last five
games, and foul trouble.
"I don't know what's going on with my
rebounding," Young said. "I have to start pur
suing the ball more aggressively, and get into

Freshman Tim Young reaches towards the hoop with ease but remains
firmly down to earth in the way he approaches life.
the frame of mind that every shot
that goes up is going to be my
rebound because the team needs a
good rebounder."
As for the fouls, Montgomery
believes a big reason is pure inexpe
rience.
"He just needs to get some more
experience and learn to know what
to do in certain situations when dif
ferent teams change things up,"
Montgomery said.
Young though, characteristical
ly, won't let it go that easily. He
believes that the responsibility is
still on him.
"I should make a goal to make it
through the first half without get
ting three fouls," Young said. "A lot
of them are really dumb fouls on

my part. I just have to think a little
bit more when I'm out there
instead of getting wrapped up in
playing a glamorous team like Ari
zona or something.
"Before I came to college I saw
these guys on television. You see
them and you don't really see them
as people, but once you're out there
you realize that they're just people
too. They have to put on their uni
forms, tie their shoelaces. Just like
the rest of us. They're not gods or
anything. I'm getting used to it. But
that's part of the fun, playing
against really great players."
That's the beauty of Young. He
still plays for the fun. And little else
can be more fun than battling Cal
at Harmon Arena, a rite of passage
in recent years that has left a bitter
taste in the mouths of many Cardi
nal players. But a victory last week
has left a sugary sweet taste for
Young. His eyes light up like an
exuberant child's when recounting

the triumph over much despised
Cal, a game in which fans heckled
him to death, flashing blown up
copies of a not-so-pretty Young gri
mace. The pictures came from a
media photo of an intense Young
protecting the ball, but that didn't
alleviate any of the hurt from the
caption, "Another Geek Hits the
Floor."
"We beat Cal!" extols Young.
"That was great! Those pictures
they had of me were kind of brutal,
but I got over that. They kind of
motivated me and got me into the
game. It was fun having all those
people yell at me. It felt good to shut
them up."
Like any kid, though, who plays
the game with love and enthusi
asm, Young holds close to his heart
the dream of many young hoop
sters all over the world, to play in
basketball's ultimate forum, the

not bad. He just really puts a lot of pressure on
himself. He wants to do well, and he wants to
make every shot, and that's just not going to
happen. I have to make sure he doesn't get
down on himself."
Young's latest frustrations have been with
his rebounding, just 5.4 over the last five
games, and foul trouble.
"I don't know what's going on with my
rebounding," Young said. "I have to start pur
suing the ball more aggressively, and get into

the frame of mind that every shot
that goes up is going to be my
rebound because the team needs a
good rebounder."
As for the fouls, Montgomery
believes a big reason is pure inexpe
rience.
"He just needs to get some more
experience and learn to know what
to do in certain situations when dif
ferent teams change things up,"
Montgomery said.
Young though, characteristical
ly, won't let it go that easily. He
believes that the responsibility is
still on him.
"I should make a goal to make it
through the first half without get
ting three fouls," Young said. "A lot
of them are really dumb fouls on

my part. I just have to think a little
bit more when I'm out there
instead of getting wrapped up in
playing a glamorous team like Ari
zona or something.
"Before I came to college I saw
these guys on television. You see
them and you don't really see them
as people, but once you're out there
you realize that they're just people
too. They have to put on their uni
forms, tie their shoelaces. Just like
the rest of us. They're not gods or
anything. I'm getting used to it. But
that's part of the fun, playing
against really great players."
That's the beauty of Young. He
still plays for the fun. And little else
can be more fun than battling Cal
at Harmon Arena, a rite of passage
in recent years that has left a bitter
taste in the mouths of many Cardi
nal players. But a victory last week
has left a sugary sweet taste for
Young. His eyes light up like an
exuberant child's when recounting

the triumph over much despised
Cal, a game in which fans heckled
him to death, flashing blown up
copies of a not-so-pretty Young gri
mace. The pictures came from a
media photo of an intense Young
protecting the ball, but that didn't
alleviate any of the hurt from the
caption, "Another Geek Hits the
Floor."
"We beat Cal!" extols Young.
"That was great! Those pictures
they had of me were kind of brutal,
but I got over that. They kind of
motivated me and got me into the
game. It was fun having all those
people yell at me. It felt good to shut
them up."
Like any kid, though, who plays
the game with love and enthusi
asm, Young holds close to his heart
the dream of many young hoop
sters all over the world, to play in
basketball's ultimate forum, the
NBA.
"I'm thinking about the NBA,

but I just want to take it one step at
a time," said Young. "This whole
college experience is enough for me
right now. I'll just worry about the
NBA later, but it's a dream of mine
definitely."
Whether or not the dream will
be realized remains to be seen, but
there's no question about his
potential and his future here. The
Cardinal offense, which has thrived
in recent years on perimeter sharp
shooting, is slowly but surely
adjusting to the inside strength
Young provides.
"I can already tell he's going to
be a great player for this program,
the way Coach has the offense set
up," said Stanford guard David
Harbour. "It's ideal for Tim. I'll tell
you this: it's fun to play with him.
He's got a great attitude right now,
and he just wants to get better. He's
got everything to be great player."
There have been knocks against
Young. Some say he's too much

finesse, not enough explosion. But
despite what many critics say about
Young, keep in mind that a hook
shot still counts as much as a dunk.
"I'm a little bit of both, physical
and finesse," Young said. "I can
adapt to either style. If I have to run
the court and shoot hook shots, I
can do that. Or I can pound the ball
in and take it real strong. I just take
whatever the defense gives. Usually
the defense won't let me charge in
there and go for a dunk so I have to
shoot a hook shot. So if that's called
finesse, then it's whatever it takes
to get the job done. I don't really
care what they say about my game."
Apparently Young hasn't heard
what Virginia head coach Jeff Jones
has been saying. Against Virginia's
big front line, Young pulled down
12 rebounds and created havoc for
the Cavalier offense.
"We missed a lot of shots around
the basket, and I have to credit Tim
Young," Jones said. "He is very

physical down there. We came away
without baskets and without fouls,
and he was the main reason."
With play like that, Young has
gained yet another moniker to add
to his ever growing collection of
aliases. The name of the month is
T-Rex, courtesy of senior forward
Andy Poppink, no doubt referring
to Young's tenacious defense and
all-around ferocity and enthusiasm.
"It really cracked me up," Young
said. "It's nothing I'd like to be
called all the time, but it's funny."
On a recent road trip to the Uni
versity of Washington to face the
Huskies, Young gazed with his big
(what else?), starry eyes at the Seat
tle Kingdom, site of this year's
Final Four, and whispered, "We're
coming back here in April."
So in April, just maybe, Cardinal
basketball will transform the King
dom into their own Jurassic Park,
featuring Stanford's very own T-
Rex.
