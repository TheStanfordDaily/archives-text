## The
						big man hits the Stanford courts At seven-foot-one, the only thing freshman center Tim Young lacks is a lofty attitude 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Remarkable changes have been happening
in the landscape of Stanford's men's basket
ball. Only two years ago, the land was a barren
desert which reaped a harvest of just seven
wins over an entire season. Then last year, a
young freshman point guard named Brevin
Knight set foot on the Farm and turned the
Pacific 10 Conference on its ear, leading the
Cardinal to 17 wins.
Since then, the sky's been the limit. Today,
the erstwhile desert has been rejuvenated,
transformed into a lush, fertile valley bearing
fruits of a 12-2 record and national ranking of
17. And this year too, a precocious freshman
has led the charge.
With all the big things happening though,
it's not a surprise that a big reason for the big
season is a big player called Big Tim.
There's little else that comes to mind at
first when looking at seven-foot-one freshman
center Tim Young. Simply put, the man is big.
His hands could probably juggle watermel
ons like apples. His size 17 feet make Side-
Show Bob's look like Tinkerbell's. And with
out question, he certainly has the game to go
along with his stature.
Young leads the Cardinal in rebounding
and blocks averaging 8.1 caroms and 1.6 rejec
tions a game. Add to that his 10.8 points per
game, along with the fact that he's a freshman
still learning and maturing, and it's easy to see
why Young is a big piece of the Cardinal's
future.
"He's going to be a great player for us," said
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery. "Tim
is as talented a big man as we've had in a long
time. We don't want to put too much pressure
on him early. Explosion, strength and experi
ence will be assets with continued work."
But Young seems a bit uncomfortable with
such a grandiose label. Big or small, the thing
that's most important in his mind is to con
tribute.
"I don't have to be the leading scorer,"
Young said. "I want to contribute more than
two points per game. I want to have an impact,
but I'm not pressured into being a dominant
player yet even though that's what I want to
become. It's been a gradual process. It's not a
pressured environment, so I'm very comfort
able."
Comfort is important for Young. After all,
like any freshman, he still needs to adjust to
college. It's just that in Young's case, the
freshman in question is also one of the top
five freshmen centers in the nation. But
underneath all that "bigness," he's still just a
small-town kid that prefers biking to driving,
the Beatles to the Beastie Boys, the Boston
Celtics to the Orlando Magic, and Larry Bird
to Larry Johnson. He chose Stanford over
such luminaries as UCLA and Arizona. His
lights are off at 9:30, and his best friend is his
sister.
"The main reason for coming to Stanford
was that it's real close to my home town," said
Young. "I just wanted to stay close to my fam

ily so that my sister and my family can go to
the games.
"I'm really close to my sister. That was one
of the big reasons for coming here. She's the
biggest influence in my life. She's always sup
ported me and has always been there for me
when I haven't been in a good mood or happy.
She's always been there."
The lifelong native of the sleepy, beachside
city of Santa Cruz is a throwback plain and
simple.
"I'm proudest of the person my son is,"
says Greg, Young's father. "He's introspec
tive, real sensitive to other people's feelings.
He writes poetry, listens to Paul Simon and
the Beatles. He's not much into the new
crap."
Young sees a lot of this "new crap" as a gen
eral lack of respect these days by players for

the game of basketball. He would much rather
see the game go back to the days of Chuck Tay
lors and the Big O instead of Air Jordans and
Shaq-Fu, a time when players played and rap
pers rapped.
"Players are obligated to pay their respects
to the game," Young said. "Whenever you step
on the floor you should show respect for the
game and play as hard as you can.
"From my own perspective, players these
days are more concerned about contracts and
negotiations rather than just being on a team
and doing what they can to win a champi
onship. It bothers me. Players in the '40s and
'50s hardly made anything, and you didn't
hear them complaining about much. Our soci
ety's becoming more obsessed with money and
that's how we judge ourselves, by how much
money we earn. It's filtering into sports, which
is kind of sad."
It's that kind of fervent, genuine belief in
the game of basketball that has made Young
into the player he is.
"I hope he never changes," Montgomery
said. "He's got a tremendous work ethic. And
if he makes a mistake, he'll bust his tail. His
answer to frustration is to sprint to the other
end of the floor.
"He gets nervous though sometimes. It's
not bad. He just really puts a lot of pressure on
himself. He wants to do well, and he wants to
make every shot, and that's just not going to
happen. I have to make sure he doesn't get
down on himself."
Young's latest frustrations have been with
his rebounding, just 5.4 over the last five
games, and foul trouble.
"I don't know what's going on with my
rebounding," Young said. "I have to start pur
