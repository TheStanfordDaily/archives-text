With a power swing and the valuable combination of leadership
and experience, Lambert garnered All-Tournament honors last
weekend at the UC-Santa Barbara Tournament. Although the
team lost in the finals to the surprise contender BYU, Lambert's
34 kills and .562-hitting performance kept the Cardinal in the run
ning up to the last points.

This self-proclaimed "emotional leader" of the Cardinal women's bas
ketball team had enough energy and attitude to blast the team past
the Bears 99-65 on Saturday night. The 6-2 freshman from Los Ange
les, Calif., chalked a double-double to her name, burying 13 points and
nabbing 12 rebounds. Most spectacular were her blocked shots, how
ever, as she decisively denied Cal offenders in three dramatic stuffs.
