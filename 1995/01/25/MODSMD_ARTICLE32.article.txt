# Gymnasts to have chance at national team
##

Tiger Woods, Kristen Folkl, Brevin
Knight and the resurgent Cardinal bas
ketball team. With the media spotlight
focused so brightly on Stanford athletics
this season, members of the men's gym
nastics team may feel a bit slighted by the
press. But their chance to shine arrives
this weekend as they compete in the U.S.
Winter Nationals.
The meet will prove to be of great
importance for the five Cardinal gym
nasts who qualified in the Spartan Open
at San Jose State. The overall competi
tion will decide the final five spots on the
U.S. national team. The other seven
spots were determined at the Summer
Nationals last year.
Heading the list of Stanford hopefuls
is graduate assistant coach Jair Lynch,
who won sixth place in the parallel bars
at the 1992 Olympic Games. Senior Josh
Stein enters as a strong contender as
well, his honors including a sec
ond place finish in the all-around
at last year's NCAA Champi
onship and a previous berth on
the national team.
Also competing for one of the
coveted spots is sophomore Keith
Wiley, who in his second year
already boasts a win in interna
tional competition. Wiley placed
first overall in the Pacific
Alliance meet in New Zealand
last summer.
"I feel pretty good about the
way things are going right now,"
Wiley said. "I think we all have
the ability to be competitive in
this meet and hopefully we'll all
perform well."
Competing separately from
Lynch, Stein and Wiley are
sophomore Jamie Ellis and grad
uate assistant coach Mark Booth,
who only qualified for the option
al competition. Both gymnasts
traveled to Houston for one last
qualifying attempt last weekend,
but fell short of the mark neces
sary for compulsory competition.
"Inconsistency was a key
problem for both guys," said
head coach Sadao Hamada.
"They had great routines, but
they just weren't hitting them
perfectly in the qualifiers."
As a result, the two will vie for

spots on the optionals only nation
al teams. Ellis will compete in the
19-and-under division while
Booth competes in the over-20.
Injuries will likely be a key
factor for a couple of the gym
nasts. Lynch, who had to petition

to receive a spot in the competi
tion, missed the Spartan Open
qualifier with an injury to his left
shoulder. Ellis may be hampered
as well, as he was unable to com
pete in both portions of the
Houston qualifier.
