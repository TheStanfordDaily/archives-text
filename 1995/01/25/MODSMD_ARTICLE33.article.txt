# Lady gymnasts hope to rebound
## Compete against UCLA, Denver & Cal in tri-meet

Stanford coach Breck Greenwood must feel
like he is running a rehabilitation center.
The Stanford women's gymnastic team
limps across the Bay this Friday to compete
against California, UCLA and the University
of Denver.
The Cardinal squad suffered a loss at the
hands of UCLA last Saturday evening. Team
members cited lack of consistency and key
injuries as the reasons Stanford faltered.
"I think it will be a lot different this time
around," said sophomore Ariel Passanisi. "We
won't be in their gym, so I don't think it will
seem as intimidating."
Having opened the season with a victory
against Cal, Stanford has had the opportunity
to see first hand the caliber of its rivals. How
ever, Greenwood downplays the importance of
knowing the opponent.
"In our sport, who you compete against is
secondary," Greenwood said. "It depends on
how well you've prepared."
This weekend the Cardinal will again be
without two of its big guns, as
senior co-captain Jen 6 Elzie and
sophomore Katie Jennings will
see limited action. According to
Greenwood, how well Stanford
competes always largely
depends on the team's efforts
during the week. Indeed, prepa
ration is the key to this team's
performance.
"We need to insure that prac
tice is good," Greenwood said.
"If we practice well, we compete
well."
The health of the team is a
major concern. Along with Elzie
and Jennings, several other
gymnasts are also hampered by
injuries.
Junior Linda Chun, who suf
fered a strain in her hand and
wrist four weeks ago, will make
her first appearance of the sea
son on Friday.
"It was very frustrating, but
it gave me a different perspec
tive on the team as an observ
er," Chun said. "I thought I
might feel separated, but I still
feel like I'm an important part
of the team. We're a very close
knit group."
Without question, competing
on the road last weekend taught
the Stanford gymnasts a lesson
about teamwork.

"Everyone was competing as
an individual and not as a
team," said senior Meegan Lan
nin. "This week, if someone
misses a routine, she is going to
have to get back into the team
and not mope around."
For support, encouragement
and a lesson in unity, the Stan
ford women can look to their

wounded leader this time
around. Despite her injury,
Elzie is completely devoted to
providing her team with what
she can give.
"I feel there is a lot I can do
in terms of keeping the team
motivated," Elzie said. "The
team is more important than
anything I do."
