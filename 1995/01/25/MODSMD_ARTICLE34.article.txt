# Why it's not gonna be a super blowout
## 
### 
Gambling is the reason pro
football exists, and it's
the only thing that will
make Super Bowl XXIX more
entertaining than Olympic curl
ing, last week's Stanford
Review or a man without facial
hair. So while only a crackhead
would predict that the San
Francisco 49ers will lose on
Super Bowl Sunday, let's just
cut through the bovine scatolo
gy and deal with the more
pressing issue: the point
spread.
Eighteen, 19 and a half, 20,
even 21. Red-blooded men all
over America have been tossing
and turning for the last week
and a half with dreams not of
the most virile years of their
lives, but of how to wager
against a Super Bowl spread
unprecedented in my lifetime.
Listening to your average
Bay Area fan would lead you to
think that the San Diego Charg
ers are a bunch of Canadian
Football League rejects who
pose no match for the more tal
ented 49ers, the champion of
the only "real" league. Think
again. The last time the spread
was this obscene was in 1969,
when the so-called experts gave
Broadway Joe Namath and the
New York Jets less chance than
a fixed jai-alai game of coming
close to the Baltimore Colts, the
champions of that other, more
esteemed league. But my name
sake proved them wrong, mak
ing Super Bowl 111 the stuff
dreams are made of, especially
for those who like to bet on the
underdog.
Let us then put to rest this
AFC-NFC argument. By a
faulty step of logic, many prog
nosticators have not so boldly

stated: "The American Football
Conference has lost the last 10
Super Bowls, and the Chargers
play in that conference. Ergo,
they will lose, and lose big." I'm
no mathematician — in fact, I
am in my junior year and am
proud to say that I have not yet
taken a math or science class at
Stanford — but I know that the

law of regression toward the
mean basically says that the
AFC is due for a victory, or at
least a close game. (Take Psych
186 for further explanation.)
That having been said, you'd
be crazy as hell to think that
the Lightning Bolts will pull an
upset. It is quite conceivable,
however, that this will be a clos
er game than in years past.
Eighteen-21 points is a point
spread more dangerous than a
Dion Cross three-point field
goal, or Texas Senator Phil
Gramm winning the 1996 presi
dential election.
Any of a number of occur
rences can combine to allow the
Chargers to beat the spread. If
the Charger coaching staff is
smart — I think it is — it will
pull a page out of former New
York Giant coach Bill Parcells'
Super Bowl playbook. Against
the Buffalo Bills, he used O.J.


The Real
Deal
Joe
Bialowitz
Anderson's powerful legs to
spearhead a methodical, clock
consuming, ball-control offense
that kept the ball out of Jim
Kelley's hands for most of the
game. San Diego needs to do
likewise by running Natrone
Means consistently, thus avoid

ing the long pass that Stan
Humphries is so fond of. He will
simply not be able to throw on
Merton Hanks, Deion Sanders,
et al.
A strong running game will
need to be buttressed by a con
sistent kicking game, and here
those with money on the Charg
ers could also use some help
from 49er kicker Doug Brien. If
the unexceptional former Wee
nie pulls a Scott Norwood by

missing a couple of field goals,
the 49er margin of victory
might not be so large after all.
Everyone is expecting former
Cardinal Darien Gordon to do
his best impression of Elvis
"Toast" Patterson in the Charg
er secondary. But those of us
who watched him at Stanford
know that he will not be burned
so easily by Jerry Rice and John
Taylor. The real surprise might
come from the hands of another

product of the Stanford football
factory, Ed McCaffrey. The
49ers have benefited in past
games by using McCaffrey as a
secret weapon. However, pass
ing to the dependable but unex
plosive McCaffrey in the Super
Bowl might come at the expense
of the big play, and will in turn
result in a lower scoring game.
Of course, Steve Young could
go down with an injury, in
which case all bets are off, and

Elvis will be sighted across the
country as he runs the 49er
offense.
While I am not going to come
straight out and tell you to put
the house on the Chargers, a
safer bet might be in the other
direction on the second half's
spread, which favors the 49ers
by seven. The one thing you can
be sure of is that the 'Niners
will be a strong team in the sec
ond half.

Regardless of how you bet,
remember to order the subs
early, and stock plenty of Key
stone Ice.
