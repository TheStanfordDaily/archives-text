# ASSU creates committee to look at Pub Board issue
## 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
A decision on how to allocate
Publications Board space was de
layed yet again last night, as the
ASSU Senate voted unanimously
to form a committee to study the
question.
At issue was a long-standing
dispute between the Stanford
Chaparral and the Pub Board over
how to divide office space on the
second floor of Storke Publica
tions Building, which houses vari
ous campus publications.
Members of the senate's Bud
get and Finance Committee voted
5-2 in favor of forming a 12-mem
ber committee to study the issue.
Representatives from the Stan
ford Chaparral and Pub Board Di
rector Danny Bressler were at the
Budget and Finance meeting and

agreed to the
process.
The bill speci
fies that the com
mittee make its
recommenda
tions to the sen
ate by Feb. 21.
Earlier this
year, the Chapar
ral appealed the

decision of the Pub Board to cut
back the magazine's office space.
The senate was expected to vote
last night on whether to uphold or
overrule the Pub Board's recom
mendations.
The Pub Board reallocation bill
— passed at its Nov. 21 meeting —
recommends that two of the
Chaparral's four rooms be taken
away for use by the Pub Board and
other campus publications.
The Chaparral, however, has

claimed a historical right to the
space, which it has held for nearly
30 years, and appealed the Pub
Board's decision.
That debate over the issue —
which was expected to be lengthy
and contentious — never hap
pened. The Budget and Finance
Committee held a meeting just
prior to the senate meeting in
which they decided to form the 12-
member committee.
Budget and Finance Chair
Andrd Vanier said that if the sen
ate had debated the space alloca
tion issue at last night's meeting,
senators wouldn't have been as in
formed on the issue as they should
be.
"This is a heart-tugging
process that has been going on for
years," Vanier said.
