# ASSU creates committee to look at Pub Board issue
## 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
A decision on how to allocate
Publications Board space was de
layed yet again last night, as the
ASSU Senate voted unanimously
to form a committee to study the
question.
At issue was a long-standing
dispute between the Stanford
Chaparral and the Pub Board over
how to divide office space on the
second floor of Storke Publica
tions Building, which houses vari
ous campus publications.
Members of the senate's Bud
get and Finance Committee voted
5-2 in favor of forming a 12-mem
ber committee to study the issue.
Representatives from the Stan
ford Chaparral and Pub Board Di
rector Danny Bressler were at the
Budget and Finance meeting and

agreed to the
process.
The bill speci
fies that the com
mittee make its
recommenda
tions to the sen
ate by Feb. 21.
Earlier this
year, the Chapar
ral appealed the

decision of the Pub Board to cut
back the magazine's office space.
The senate was expected to vote
last night on whether to uphold or
overrule the Pub Board's recom
mendations.
The Pub Board reallocation bill
— passed at its Nov. 21 meeting —
recommends that two of the
Chaparral's four rooms be taken
away for use by the Pub Board and
other campus publications.
The Chaparral, however, has

claimed a historical right to the
space, which it has held for nearly
30 years, and appealed the Pub
Board's decision.
That debate over the issue —
which was expected to be lengthy
and contentious — never hap
pened. The Budget and Finance
Committee held a meeting just
prior to the senate meeting in
which they decided to form the 12-
member committee.
Budget and Finance Chair
Andrd Vanier said that if the sen
ate had debated the space alloca
tion issue at last night's meeting,
senators wouldn't have been as in
formed on the issue as they should
be.
"This is a heart-tugging
process that has been going on for
years," Vanier said.

He went on to say that many
senators had been lobbied heavily
by members of the Chaparral, but
may not have heard from the
other side of the debate.
Budget and Finance member
Steve Russell said he voted to
form the committee despite
regrets about the length of time it
has already taken to resolve the
issue.
Another member of the Budget
and Finance Committee, junior
Ed Malone, criticized the forma
tion of the new committee.

"There'll be people arguing
about the process. There'll be
appeals. We'll be back to ground
zero," Malone said.
The committee will be com
posed of a Chaparral representa
tive, Pub Board Director Bressler,
a Council of Presidents represen
tative, Senate Deputy Chair Mike
Choo, Budget and Finance Chair
Vanier, two Pub Board represen
tatives selected randomly from
interested students, two repre
sentatives from the Stanford
Quad, Sequoia and The Daily, two
Budget and Finance Committee
members, and one at-large senate
member.
Senator Nicole Vazquez was
chosen as the at-large senate

member. In addition, the bill pro
vided that committee meetings
will be abjudicated by a modera
tor.
In other business, the senate
unanimously approved recom
mendations on student appoint
ments to University committees.
Junior Vivek Nasta was
appointed to the Board of
Trustees Committee on Alumni
and External Affairs. Senior Vu
Luu and graduate student
Jonathan Eisen were named to
the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education Science Breadth
Requirement Design Committee.
And senior Jordan Kantor was
appointed to the Outdoor Art
Committee.
