# Quake-studying students describe damage after trip to Japan

### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
When two doctoral students in the
School of Engineering were invited to
Japan for an earthquake-damage reduction
workshop, first-hand exposure to their sub
ject was not an option they expected to
have.
But four hours before the scheduled
workshop, the Hyogoken-Nanbu Earth
quake hit the city of Kobe, registering 7.2

on the Richter Scale. The disaster gave
Stephanie King and Chris Rojahn, 25 miles
away in Osaka, an unexpected opportunity
to examine the structural effects of a large
magnitude earthquake on an urban center.
In a seminar yesterday afternoon in Ter
man Auditorium, the two described their
experience of eight days ago, showing slides
illustrating the extreme damage in the
area.
"It was very weird," King said. "I went to
the Northridge earthquake site and took

pictures of the collapses. I used maybe one
roll of film the whole day. But at this (in
Kobe), I couldn't capture it on film. I could
have used 100 rolls in a day."
The slides King showed depicted the
damage sustained by residential areas in

Kobe, showing blocks of entirely collapsed
wooden houses. The houses were not built
to withstand earthquakes, King said, and
the enormous magnitude of this particular
earthquake completely destroyed many of
the residences on the island.
"It was very sad — you saw collapsed
houses and knew there were people under
there, either dead or who hadn't been res
cued yet," King said. She added that as of
Monday, there were 5,060 reported fatali
ties, but said that "the number will proba

bly go up somewhat as they continue to
search for people."
King also said that an estimated 300,000
people were homeless, either due to the
earthquake itself or to post-earthquake
fires, fueled by the wood of the destroyed
buildings.
"City Hall had to become a shelter for
homeless people," Rojahn said.
Although high-rises and other buildings
