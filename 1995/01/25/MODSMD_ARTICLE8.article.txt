# Habermas describes future of global crises

More than 400 people crowded
into Annenberg Auditorium last
night to hear famed leading Ger
man political philosopher Jiirgen
Habermas' heavily conceptual
analysis of the modern nation
state.
Diverging somewhat from his
lecture's announced topic of "Na
tional Sovereignty and Human
Rights," Habermas began by trac
ing the historical development of
the nation-state in order to lead
into his main topic: the current
European nation-state system in
a state of flux.
Though he never definitively
answered the question of whether
the contemporary nation-state
can survive in the changing world
system, Habermas pointed out

many of the problems that threat
en nation-states.
"The European nation-states
took on non-national overtures
after World War 11, and borders
ceased to be an issue," he said.
"Yet, the problem of the nation is
that it has an ambivalent charac
ter. No normative justification
can be given for what the bound
aries of a nation are. It remains on
the outcome of violent conflict to
see who defines borders."
Habermas contended that con
tinuing globalization has caused
the evolution of the nation-state
to come to a standstill, because of
the new communication and
transportation technologies
which give organizations a supra
national character.
"Globalization signifies a move
ment of boundaries which stands
or falls with its borders," he said.
"The fact is that local happenings
are now shaped by events many
miles away."
"Governments today feel a gap
between the limited scope for
action as a nation-state and feel
imposed by globally networked
actors," Habermas said. "Associa
tions have expanded beyond
national borders to the extent that
nations are no longer able to con
trol them."
"The freedom of the nation is
grasped as both the empowerment
and the inclination to conduct
relations with other states,"
Habermas added. This freedom,
he explained, is being threatened
by the supra-national character of
many global organizations, such
as the World Bank, the United
Nations or the International Mon
etary Fund.
"The globalization process has
nevertheless caused us to an
awareness of the impenetrable
interdependence of chains of
events," continued Habermas.
Nevertheless, Habermas contend
ed that faster communication will
necessarily cause world communi
ty integration, and said it could
actually lead to more world frag
mentation. "There is an indication
of the lack of agencies which can
influence globalization," he said.
Habermas gave two possible
alternatives to the nation-state
crisis: "politics must either
restrict itself to adapting its soci
ety into a world economy or it
must act in a heroic attempt to
transform itself and create politi
cal capabilities at the supra
national level."
Insisting that the modern
nation-state is in peril, he ended
with the question of whether it

would simply dissolve or learn
from itself and thus transform
itself as a viable actor in the com
ing world order.
"What do we do with the nor
mative self-understanding of the
nation-state? Do we identify with
it or do we judge it as a relic?"
Habermas ended to resounding
applause.
Habermas, a professor at J-W

Goethe Universitat in Frankfurt, is
the Marta Sutton Weeks Distin
guished Visitor, an endowment
that brings a distinguished scholar,
artist, or public intellectual to cam
pus each year to stay in residence
to enhance Stanford's intellectual
environment. Other distinguished
visitors have been historian Carlo
Ginzburg and composer John
Cage.
