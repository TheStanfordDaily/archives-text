More than 400 people crowded
into Annenberg Auditorium last
night to hear famed leading Ger
man political philosopher Jiirgen
Habermas' heavily conceptual
analysis of the modern nation
state.
Diverging somewhat from his
lecture's announced topic of "Na
tional Sovereignty and Human
Rights," Habermas began by trac
ing the historical development of
the nation-state in order to lead
into his main topic: the current
European nation-state system in
a state of flux.
Though he never definitively
answered the question of whether
the contemporary nation-state
can survive in the changing world
system, Habermas pointed out

many of the problems that threat
en nation-states.
"The European nation-states
took on non-national overtures
after World War 11, and borders
ceased to be an issue," he said.
"Yet, the problem of the nation is
that it has an ambivalent charac
ter. No normative justification
can be given for what the bound
aries of a nation are. It remains on
the outcome of violent conflict to
see who defines borders."
Habermas contended that con
tinuing globalization has caused
the evolution of the nation-state
to come to a standstill, because of
the new communication and
transportation technologies
which give organizations a supra
national character.
