# Popular lecturer dies at 48
## 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
Francis E. Rinehart — me
chanical engineering lecturer,
teaching specialist and automo
bile aficionado — died Sunday of
lung cancer. He was 48.
Rinehart, known as "Fritz" to
the Stanford community, began
teaching at the University in
1981 and helped develop the
Stanford Internal Combustion
Engine Laboratory.
"Fritz was one of the best if

not the best in
terms of teach
ing," said Me
chanical Engi
neering Prof.
Craig T. Bow
man, Rinehart's
longtime col
league. "The
students just re
ally responded

to him in ways they wouldn't
with others.
"He was very easy to talk to,"
he said. "He spent a lot of time
with the students. He stayed late
when students dropped in to
talk."
Bowman said he first met
Rinehart while searching for
ideas for laboratory experiments
in propulsion systems.
"Someone said to me, 'Why
don't you go out in the lab and see
Fritz?' " Rinehart, a graduate
student at the time, said, " 'Oh
I'd be happy to help you.' He
helped me get [the experiments]
going," Bowman said.
"We continued that relation
ship throughout the 16 to 17
years we were here," he said.


Rinehart
Born in Massachusetts, Rine
hart worked as an automotive
technician before receiving his
B.S. in mechanical engineering
from the University of Arizona
in 1974. He received his M.S.
and Engineer's degrees at Stan
ford.
After four years as a research
associate in the thermosciences
division, Rinehart was promot
ed to teaching specialist in
1982.
Both at home and at Stanford,
Rinehart was always interested
in cars and drag racing. He
received a grant from General
Motors to renovate an out-of
date engine laboratory. And last

year he placed second in the
western region for Division Two
drag racing, Bowman said.
"He just lived and breathed
automobiles," Bowman said. "He
had a fantastic drag racer that he
built from scratch. Every experi
ment he built from the ground
up."
Rinehart stopped teaching his
popular Internal Combustion
Systems and senior thermo
sciences classes in September,
one month after learning of his
illness.
Rinehart is survived by his
mother Elizabeth, brother
Christopher, and longtime com
panion Diana Spence.
A memorial service for Rine
hart will be held tomorrow at
3:30 p.m. in Memorial Church,
followed by a reception in Build
ing 530.
