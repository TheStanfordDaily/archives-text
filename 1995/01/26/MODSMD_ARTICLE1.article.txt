### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
Francis E. Rinehart — me
chanical engineering lecturer,
teaching specialist and automo
bile aficionado — died Sunday of
lung cancer. He was 48.
Rinehart, known as "Fritz" to
the Stanford community, began
teaching at the University in
1981 and helped develop the
Stanford Internal Combustion
Engine Laboratory.
"Fritz was one of the best if

not the best in
terms of teach
ing," said Me
chanical Engi
neering Prof.
Craig T. Bow
man, Rinehart's
longtime col
league. "The
students just re
ally responded

to him in ways they wouldn't
with others.
"He was very easy to talk to,"
he said. "He spent a lot of time
with the students. He stayed late
when students dropped in to
talk."
Bowman said he first met
Rinehart while searching for
ideas for laboratory experiments
in propulsion systems.
"Someone said to me, 'Why
don't you go out in the lab and see
Fritz?' " Rinehart, a graduate
student at the time, said, " 'Oh
I'd be happy to help you.' He
helped me get [the experiments]
going," Bowman said.
"We continued that relation
ship throughout the 16 to 17
years we were here," he said.
