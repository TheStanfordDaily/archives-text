# Serbs given time deadline
## Non-compliance might force continued warring

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegov
ina (AP) — Frustrated by the lack
of peace talks, Bosnia's Muslim
president yesterday gave rival
Serbs two months to accept a plan
dividing the republic, and until
May 1 for a final peace settlement.
That date marks the end of the
current truce. The accord, howev
er, has not stopped the fighting,
particularly in northwest Bosnia
where Croatian Serbs and rebel
Muslims have been battling gov
ernment forces.
The Muslim-led government
has no power to force a deadline on
the Serbs, or on the international
community. It could, however, pull
out of the cease-fire deal May 1,
which would lead to more heavy
fighting this summer.
The five nations that drafted the
peace plan are pressing to get talks
restarted, but their representatives

left Bosnia yesterday without get
ting Serbs to agree to the proposed
deal.
The plan, accepted by the gov
ernment last July, would give 51
percent of Bosnia to the govern
ment and its Croat allies. Serbs,
who now hold 70 percent, would be
left with 49 percent.
Originally offered as a take-it
or-leave-it deal, strong Serb opposi
tion caused negotiators to soften
the terms. Serbs later said they
could regard the plan only as a
basis for further talks.
Russian envoy Alexander Zotov,
who met President Alija Izetbegov
ic and other officials yesterday, said
later that mediators wanted to
establish a renewed peace process
based on accepting the plan as a
starting point.
"We still do not have a clear
answer" from the Serbs, he said.

"We will continue our efforts to get
both sides to accept the plan and
continue negotiations."
Izetbegovic said his government
wants mediators to give Serbs two
months to approve the plan, and
then wants the whole process to be
wrapped up in another month —
by the end of April. "This is a very
important issue," Izetbegovic said.
Muslims insist the Serbs must
sign the plan first before any
changes can be considered — some
thing the Serbs have refused to do.
Moves toward peace suffered
another setback yesterday as talks
stalled on implementing an agree
ment to open a land route out of
Sarajevo, Bosnia's besieged capital.
Accusing the Serbs of stalling on
finalizing terms for opening the
route, the government said it
would not take part in talks sched
uled for today.
