# Debate on budget proposal heats up
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a debate
with enormous economic and political
significance, the Republican-controlled
House advanced yesterday toward a
showdown on a balanced-budget
amendment designed to end the gov
ernment's massive run-up in red ink.
"This is the cornerstone of our
party's 'Contract With America,"' said
Rep. Dan Schaefer of Colorado, as GOP
leaders brought the proposal to the floor
a scant three weeks after swearing in
their new, aggressive House majority.
GOP lawmakers were nearly unani
mous in their support. But with a two
thirds majority required for passage,
the amendment's fate was in the hands
of a divided Democratic party.
House Democratic Leader Richard
Gephardt of Missouri told lawmakers
the proposal was "perhaps the most
important issue we will consider in
your whole time in the Congress."
He pressed his demand for Republi
cans to identify the cuts they would
make to wipe out the deficit. "Is there a

hidden agenda here? Is there some
where in here a veiled attack on Social
Security or Medicare, which some of
our friends on the other side have
threatened in the past?"
Republicans denied the politically
potent charge, and arranged passage
first of a companion measure — which
does not have the force of law — pro
claiming that Social Security not be
used to balance the budget.
With majorities in both houses of
Congress, Republicans expressed opti
mism that they would finally prevail in
a struggle that has been waged unsuc
cessfully in the House and Senate since
1982. It takes a two-third majority in
both houses and ratification in three
fourths of the states to add the measure
to the Constitution.
In the Senate, an all-out fight is
expected from Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-
W.Va., but Republicans expressed con
fidence that they have the votes to pre
vail. One longtime GOP opponent, Sen.
Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, said the

amendment was "a bad idea whose
time may have come," and several GOP
officials said they expected she would
support the proposal.
In the House, the main point of con
troversy concerned a requirement for a
three-fiflhs vote in both houses to raise
taxes. House Speaker Newt Gingrich
and most Republicans supported it, but
many Democratic balanced-budget
supporters did not.
Under the rules established by the
GOP, the House scheduled a first vote
today on an amendment including the
three-fifths requirement — the version
contained in the "Contract With Amer
ica."
That would be followed by a vote on
a milder version that required only a
majority of the whole House and Sen
ate to raise taxes. With many freshmen
demanding passage of the tax-limita
tion provision, GOP aides held out the
possibility that they would change
plans if they came close on the first roll
call.
