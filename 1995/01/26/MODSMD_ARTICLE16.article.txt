Missile report unfounded
An erroneous report that Russian forces had
shot down a missile launched from northern
Europe had governments around the world and
their militaries asking questions yesterday.
The "missile" turned out to be a NASA
funded rocket that aimed to study the Northern
Lights. The Norwegians launched it successful
ly within their own territory after informing the
Russian government. It was not shot down.
The Interfax news agency later acknowl
edged that its report was wrong. Vyacheslav
Terekhov, deputy director of the agency,
blamed the mistake on false information from a
high-ranking military source.
Following the initial urgent report, Russian
government and military officials said they
knew nothing about a missile shootdown.
But at a time when Russia's military is
embroiled in a bloody war in Chechnya, the
report set off widespread alarms.
Spokesmen for NATO, the Pentagon, the

Allied military command in Europe, several
countries and President Clinton immediately
said they were looking into the report. Later, a
White House spokesman called it "totally
unsubstantiated."
Guerrillas killed
MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -
Ambushed Israeli troops killed three Shiite
Muslim guerrillas in a shootout yesterday in
Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon.
Two Israeli soldiers were wounded in the
attack claimed by the Iranian-backed Hezbol
lah.
Israel retaliated for the ambush with air
attacks and Hezbollah fighters later engaged
Israeli troops in artillery duels.
Hezbollah and its radical Palestinian allies
have sworn to wreck the Mideast peace pro
cess by escalating attacks in the 440-square
mile buffer zone Israel has occupied since
1985 to curb cross-border guerrilla forays.
