A FTER BACKING DOWN on
/\ their original Stanford Fund
JL JLpolicy, the administration
agreed to the formation of a commit
tee to design a new plan that would
make it easier for student groups to
solicit money from alumni. It has
been over two months since this com
mittee was formed, and with their
Feb. 15 deadline approaching, it is
time that this joint ASSU/adminis
tration group start giving signs of
their findings and recommendations.
There is little argument among
student groups that the original
Stanford Fund policy — which would
allow student groups to solicit funds
only from alumni who have con
tributed at least once in the last five
years — took too much power out of
the hands of student groups.
Coming up with a new plan is very
important for the viability of many
student organizations, otherwise all
solicitations would have to go
through the Development Office,
leaving unrestricted funds to be
placed in the Stanford Fund under
the control of the president and
provost.
Understanding the potential con
sequences these changes in funding
could have for student organizations,

the committee should ensure it com
mits as much effort and thorough
ness in formulating a new policy as it
did researching its potential impacts.
For this reason, the committee
should release a report on their
progress and findings to let these
groups know what they plan on rec
ommending, so as to ensure that all
affected groups are in agreement.
While thorough background
research was conducted, the commit
tee needs to continue to work with
the students and their organizations
throughout this drafting and negoti
ating stage, as it is ultimately these
actors who will be affected by the out
come.
The biggest consequence, as the
schedule now stands, is that the orig
inal policy will go into effect if no new
plan is drafted by the February dead
line. For this reason, the committee
should be granted the time it needs to
formulate its plan, even if this means
further extending the suspension of
the Stanford Fund.
It would be a tremendous embar
rassment for the student groups if all
the uproar and time spent investigat
ing the original policy led to a rushed
design of a new policy that failed to
meet the administration's criteria.
