# Vote 'no' on the BFD
## 
### 
Today, students have
their final opportunity to vote
on a proposed amendment to
the ASSU Constitution aimed at
revamping the ailing special-fee sys
tem.
The so-called Balanced Funding
Deal would eliminate fee refunds,
split graduates and undergraduates
into separate voting communities
and limit the amount of student
group fees the ASSU Senate could
place on the ballot.
Any proposal for reforming the
fee system might seem alluring at
this point, but the Balanced Fund
ing Deal contains serious flaws that
make it unacceptable. Students
should vote to reject it.
To keep fees under control, the

proposed amendment places a cap
on the amount of fees the senate can
place on the ballot. The cap would
require the senate to decrease some
or all groups' fee requests — not
necessarily proportionally — in
order to bring the total beneath the
cap.
Therefore, the plan would allow
the senate responsibility for making
priority judgments among deserving
groups and within groups' budgets
— decisions better left to the voters
and to the groups themselves.
By voting no on the Balanced
Funding Deal, students can prevent
a student-group funding disaster
and get the student government
back on track to designing an accept
able reform plan.
