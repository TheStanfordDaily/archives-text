ClV's existing structure should not be abandoned

I WOULD LIKE to complement the
Stanford Daily on its editorial of Fri
day Jan. 20, which raises a number of
reservations about the CUE Report Rec
ommendations for modifying the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values core, all valid.
I think there is a special place in pur
gatory reserved for University adminis
trators who appoint high-profile com
mittees to effect changes they already
had the power to implement through
existing structures. I'm afraid that our
former president and provost will have
to spend some time there, in spite of
their many good works. When the West
ern Culture Program began in 1978
(with me as Director of the Pilot Pro
gram), considerable authority was vest
ed in the Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences and the provost to appoint the
Western Culture Committee, which in

turn had complete authority over the
structure and content of the infamous
Core List.
What's more, the Pilot Program Com
mittee recommended that this commit
tee work to include works by women and
minorities. All of the 1988 modifications
to the Western Culture Program that
constitute CIV could have been brought
about by appointing a vigorous activist
Western Culture Committee. Instead,
we went the blue-ribbon committee
route, took two years, split the campus
in two, and garnered Stanford thou
sands of lines of bad publicity and mil
lions of lost donations. I explained all of
this in very easy to understand terms to
then-Provost Rosse when he twisted my
arm, hard, to join that committee. He
didn't listen.
Let me urge the present administra-

tion: don't do it. The CUE report finds
some real problems with CIV. The
tracks differ too widely in purpose, work
load and grading policy. These problems
can be addressed within the present
committee structure and should be. If
the present director of CIV can't deal
with the problems, find someone else.
The modifications proposed by CUE
don't address these problems at all. Or
rather, they address them in fantasy
mode. The fantasy is that any of these
problems would be addressed by making
the common intellectual experience "a
self-consciousness about the enterprise
itself." This is gobbledvgook.
The basic idea behind the Western
Culture Requirement and behind the
CIV requirement is to get Stanford
freshmen reading interesting stuff in
small groups led by good teachers. It's an

introductory course. The thought that
we would sacrifice any discussions of
Descartes' Meditations, or Shakespeare's
Tempest, or Equiano in order to waste
time encouraging frosh to self-reflect on
"analytical and ideological issues that the
study of culture involves," is sad; the
idea that we would waste so much time
on this as to have this self-consciousness
"anchor" the course and, apparently,
solve the problems of common purpose,
work-load and grading is absurd. It will
rightly be resisted, and Stanford will be a
spectacle again.
Please, senate, provost, president,
address the problems with the struc
tures you have already in place; let the
CUE proposal die the quiet death it
deserves.
