# The
						BFD would answer problems posed by the current refund policy
## 
### 
As students continue to vote on the
Balanced Funding Deal, we worry that
the essence of the debate has been lost
in a sea of rhetoric. As ASSU senators,
we have been exposed to more hours of
debate on this issue than we could ever
want. Our conclusion? The BFD is good
for the Stanford community.
No one is happy with the current sys
tem. Graduate students are upset

because they have to pay fees for groups
that primarily service undergraduates.
Undergrads are upset because their
groups often do not get funding. Students
who do not take fee refunds are upset
because they end up paying more to make
up for those that do take refunds.
Splitting the voting populations in
two and eliminating refunds ensures
that grad students will no longer be
charged for undergrad groups they do
not support, popular undergrad groups
will get funding and non-fee-refunders
will no longer foot the bill for refunders.
Opponents are fixated on the elimina
tion of fee refunds. Without fee refunds,
they claim, students will somehow
become powerless. They fail to acknowl

edge the power of voters; not a single
group will get a penny of special-fee
money unless a majority of grads or
undergrads vote to fund that group.
Deciding on funding in this manner is
reasonable, democratic and fair.
Opponents also imply that fee
refunds are a harmless right for stu
dents. They fail to mention that under
the present system student groups are
allowed to tack on a 30 percent buffer to
their budgets in order to compensate for
refunds. That means that students who
do not take refunds pay more than their
share every year in order to make up for
those students who do take refunds.
Finally, concerns about how the
ASSU will institute a fee cap are over-

stated. The important point is that there
will be a fee cap. It is impossible to have
a cap without having some provisions
for its implementation. The BFD makes
every effort to minimize ASSU authori
ty. It continues to protect the right of
student groups to petition their way
onto the special fee ballot if they do not
want to make their proposed budgets
fall under the ASSU cap.
We hope students will make an
informed decision. Our vote? Yes on the
BFD.
