## From across a cappuccino 
### 
THERE'S THIS NEW game I play. I
sit in the Coffee House, sip my dou
ble mocha and watch all of the girls
I've liked, wanted or had crushes on in the
past three years go by.
Some look as cute as ever, some have
cut their hair, some have gotten fat. Some
say hi and some pass by pretending not to
see or remember me almost convincingly.
I like it best when they're fat.
And I like it when friends I don't see
enough climb over the lacquered tables to
say hi and ask if I'm dating the girl I came
in with and, if not, could they. I like watch
ing freshmen who don't have cars go there
for a first date — I like watching them sing
along with Eddie Vedder on the CD juke
box when they have nothing else to say.
I enjoy watching haphazardly talented
local bands (always slightly off-track bands
at that — they're not jazz, but jazzy, never
folk, but folki's/i) interrupt course reader
solemnity to ask you to buy one of their
tapes.
I've found that a good seat at the Coffee
House provides the clearest cartoon view
of this university and its social dynamics.
In the Coffee House the tendrils of asso
ciation become salient. From across your
cappuccino you spy friends being friends
with friends you never knew were friends
with your friends. Its cacophonous bustle
is really the tune of a grand parade flaunt
ing personal history.
It's like a poorly lit Bar-Mitzvah, except
everyone's done with puberty and the
glasses aren't monogrammed.

And it's such the scene. While being a
soothing haven for noncommittal half
dates, the Coffee House doubles as a
chance for chance encounters — planned
or not. I guess everyone figures they look
cuter to someone strung out on caffeine.
But in between the buzzing background
noise and the squawking sound of Pi Phis
getting hit on, I am made fully aware just
how far I am from being master of that
domain. It is ruled by the Coffee House peo
ple, and they're the best part about it.
I don't even have to describe them to
you.
The Coffee House people — they're
inherently cool. Cool hair, cool conversa
tions, and they dress with just the right
combination of black, flannel and mohair.
They glide effortlessly from table to table
and know everyone in between. They're
the perfect hyper-independent strike-a
posers who never need to look up at the
menu to decide between a Plain Jane Quc
sadilla and Budget Bean Burrito, and who
can magically hear one another over the
hacking sound of the espresso machine
coughing up steamed milk.
I've decided I want to become one of
them.
I want it to take 20 minutes to leave for
all the hi-bye kissies I have to dispense. I
want to be so welcomed by all the pierced
regulars that they offer to paint my nails
black too.
I want to know their secrets, things like:
How did they get to be one of the Coffee
House (true aficionados never call it the

CoHo) people? Is it just a matter of time?
And when you do make it into the club, do
you have to get something pierced?
I want to know how they can show up
late and still get a table.
They're an elite cabal o' cool greater
than any greek system, because with this
group there is no loss of identity through
affiliation. Chain smoking lesbian or
philosophical physicist; a pint of Sam
Adams or an Almond Moo — it just
doesn't matter who you are or what you
drink. The Coffee House people take all
kinds.
Yet within that social sushi bar freedom
there are distinct categories. There is the
instant dichotomy of the inside vs. the out
side — the surly chess playing narcissists
vs. the yurpy islands of frat-boys and neo
hippies.
Or you can further classify the Coffee
House people by intent. For example, there
are the people who are there for: a) face
time (the see and be seen crowd); b) public
reclusivity; c) cafieine (the fly-by crowd
who bring their own mammoth mugs, and
just fill up and go and never do seem to
pay); d) beer; and so on.
I'm not really sure where I'll fit in. But
if you want to find me, that's where I'll be
— making small talk with the Coffee
House Cop and trying on nose rings.
