## Men's hoops off to UCLA Cardinal hopes to slay Pac-10 giant

Lights. Camera. Action.
In a land where fantasies become reality and
wishes and dreams do come true, the Stanford men's
basketball team hopes to spin some motion-picture
magic of its own as it travels south to take on the
glitz and glamour of No. 4 UCLA tonight.
While the 17th-ranked Cardinal (12-2 overall, 3-2
in the Pacific 10 Conference) can no longer be con
sidered anyone's David, the high-powered Bruins
(11-1 overall, 5-1 Pac-10) are unquestionably still
Goliaths in the world of college basketball.
"We know we're capable of playing good basket
ball," said Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery.
"The last three times out against Arizona State, Ari
zona and Cal, we've played pretty well. UCLA's pret
ty good, and we know that. They're a good basketball
team. You just want to go down and play the best
basketball you can."
Picked by many to go all the way this year, the
Bruins will certainly provide some good basketball.
Since losing to Oregon in their Pac-10 opener, UCLA
has played remarkably well. They sent a statement
out to the rest of the conference last week by sweep
ing both Arizona and ASU on the road.
UCLA's roster reads like an arsenal of the
NCAA's most dangerous weapons. Senior guard
Tyus Edney quarterbacks the Bruins at both ends of
the court, averaging 15.5 points and 6.2 assists per
game offensively and defensively leading the Pac-10
in steals with 3.0 a game. Stanford's own point
guard phenom, 5-foot-10 Brevin Knight (16.2 ppg,
5.7 apg, 2.7 spg) matches up nicely against the 5-10
Edney, although he is still battling the effects of a
stress reaction in his leg.
Lingering injuries hobble the Cardinal up front as
well. Stanford forward Andy Poppink, who dislocat
ed his shoulder last week, hopes to go full speed

against high-flying Bruin for
ward Charles O'Bannon.
"I'm excited to go play
UCLA," Poppink said. "They
have a bunch of guys that run up
and down really well. So it'll
probably be a fun, fast-paced
game."
Cardinal Darren Allaway gets
the tougher draw though at the
other forward position, facing
Charles' older brother, Ed. Ed
O'Bannon has dominated oppo
nents all year long, averaging
19.4 ppg and 8.9 rpg, good for
fourth and third in the Pac-10
respectively. Allaway recognizes
the threat posed by the Brothers
O'Bannon, but also realizes the
need to neutralize it.
"I'm absolutely looking for
ward to it," Allaway said. "That's
a challenge. Our front line has
faced a lot of good players this
year. Every game we have, some
one has to step up defensively.
Now it's my turn."
Physical 7-0 Bruin center
George Zidek will hope to do
some neutralizing of his own
against Stanford's star freshman
center Tim Young. At 7-1,
though, Young won't need to
back down, and he isn't planning
on it either.
"We just need to go in there
prepared to play," Young said. "If
we play our game, I think we'll be
fine."
The Bruins have done just fine
year long by simply blowing the
ir opponents away. All of UCLA's
starters are shooting over 50 per
cent, and they lead the confer
ence in scoring as well. Simply
put, the Bruin arsenal is loaded
with talented young and old.

UCLA freshman J.R. Hender
son has started the last five
games. He's joined by fellow high
ly-touted freshmen recruits Toby
Bailey, omm'A Givens and Kris
Johnson. Add returning players
Cameron Dollar, Kevin Dempsey,
Ike Nwankwo and Bob Myers to
the mix, and it's quite clear why
this will be Stanford's greatest
challenge up-to-date. Oh yes, and
the Cardinal must also contend
with the ghosts of the hallowed
halls of Pauley Pavilion.
"UCLA's awfully talented and
they're awfully deep," Mont
gomery said. "They're a very
good basketball team that has a
lot of different weapons, a lot of
ways to score. You have to play
well to have chance.
"Your objective in any game,
particularly when you're playing
a great team on the road, is to
give yourself chances to win.
Hang, hang and then give your
self a chance to run a spurt at the
end and win. The chances of you
going down and dominating are
not very good. That's just not
going to happen. Really, all you
can do is work and play as well as
you can. If you do that, the
results will take care of them
selves."
And Stanford hopes the
results will be like a storybook
ending only Tinsel Town can pro
vide. At least one Cardinal,
though, doesn't believe the feat to
be one of fairy-tale proportions.
"I feel unusually confident
going down there," Allaway said.
"I feel pretty confident with the
way we're playing right now.
We're not a surprise to anyone
anymore. UCLA's going to play
hard. And that's what we want
them to do. We want to beat the
best teams while they're playing
the best, so that we show we're
one of the best teams too."
