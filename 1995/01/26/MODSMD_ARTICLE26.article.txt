Lights. Camera. Action.
In a land where fantasies become reality and
wishes and dreams do come true, the Stanford men's
basketball team hopes to spin some motion-picture
magic of its own as it travels south to take on the
glitz and glamour of No. 4 UCLA tonight.
While the 17th-ranked Cardinal (12-2 overall, 3-2
in the Pacific 10 Conference) can no longer be con
sidered anyone's David, the high-powered Bruins
(11-1 overall, 5-1 Pac-10) are unquestionably still
Goliaths in the world of college basketball.
"We know we're capable of playing good basket
ball," said Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery.
"The last three times out against Arizona State, Ari
zona and Cal, we've played pretty well. UCLA's pret
ty good, and we know that. They're a good basketball
team. You just want to go down and play the best
basketball you can."
Picked by many to go all the way this year, the
Bruins will certainly provide some good basketball.
Since losing to Oregon in their Pac-10 opener, UCLA
has played remarkably well. They sent a statement
out to the rest of the conference last week by sweep
ing both Arizona and ASU on the road.
UCLA's roster reads like an arsenal of the
NCAA's most dangerous weapons. Senior guard
Tyus Edney quarterbacks the Bruins at both ends of
the court, averaging 15.5 points and 6.2 assists per
game offensively and defensively leading the Pac-10
in steals with 3.0 a game. Stanford's own point
guard phenom, 5-foot-10 Brevin Knight (16.2 ppg,
5.7 apg, 2.7 spg) matches up nicely against the 5-10
Edney, although he is still battling the effects of a
stress reaction in his leg.
Lingering injuries hobble the Cardinal up front as
well. Stanford forward Andy Poppink, who dislocat
ed his shoulder last week, hopes to go full speed
