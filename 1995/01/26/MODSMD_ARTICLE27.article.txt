# Quick shots

### 
thoughts and some not
t M so-keen observations from
I -J the world of sports ...
Double Trouble: Stanford is
one of six schools whose men's
and women's basketball teams
are both in the top 25. The
Cardinal men are currently
No. 17, while the women are
No. 4 in the AP Polls. Con
necticut (No. 2 men's, No. 1
women's) and North Carolina

(No. 3, No. 3) both have a legit
imate shot at a March Miracle.
Also making a double appear
ance in the polls are Virginia
(No. 15, No. 12), Florida (No.
23, No. 13) and Kansas (No. 7,
No. 17).
Stellar Statistics: Against Cal
last week, the Cardinal men hit
19-of-22 from the line in a 78-73
victory, while the women's sec
ond unit scored 45 points, grab
bing 23 rebounds in Stanford's
99-65 triumph.
Power Outage: Bay Area col
lege basketball has been fairly
successful in 1995 — except San
Jose State. Last Thursday, the
Spartans fell to 1-13 with a 69-60
loss at the hands of Cal State-
Fullerton. The game took place at


Kyle
I Utsumi
the Civic Auditorium, where SJS
played until the 1989-1990 season
instead of at their usual venue, the
San Jose Event Center. The Spar
tans lost their home court to the vis
iting Mighty Morphin' Power
Rangers show.
Easy as 1,2,3: Coach Ruben
Nieves' men's volleyball team
played well enough to grab second
place at the UC-Santa Barbara
Tournament last weekend, where
tourney champion BYU was a giant

killer. The Cougars, not ranked in
the nation's top five entering the
tournament, knocked off No. 1
UCLA, No. 2 Stanford and No. 3
USC en route to the title.
Angry Bear: Although his Golden
Bears left Northridge with a 76-65
win Sunday, Cal basketball coach
Todd Bozeman was a little hot
under the collar during the contest.
In a second half outburst, Bozeman
argued a call, was heckled by
Northridge fans and allegedly took a
swing at CSUN athletic events
manager Howard Garcia. "The
most overused thing in the world is,
they say, to show some class," Boze
man said. "Come on. [Fans are]
yelling out crazy stuff, and you want

someone to show some class? That's
ridiculous." Hmmm.
Cardinal Quotable: Men's swim
ming captain Clay Tippins, on Stan
ford's dual meets vs. Arizona and
Arizona State: "It's not easy. We
can't loaf. If we swim like we should,
we'll win. As long as we don't get
caught with our pants down, and we
swim hard, we'll win." Keeping
everyone properly clad, the Cardinal
was victorious in both meets.
Super Bowl Ties: Stanford will be
represented by both squads when
San Francisco meets San Diego
Sunday in Super Bowl XXIX. The
49ers feature cornerback Toi Cook
(Class of '87), offensive lineman

Chris Dalman ('93) and receiver Ed
McCaffrey ('9l). Ex-Cardinal star
Darrien Gordon ('93) will start at
corner for the Chargers.
Intramural Madness: Another
winter quarter, another season of
IM basketball. While dorms and
houses usually form teams, there
are always "independents" with
wacky names who enter the
leagues. Here are my top five names
for 1995: 5. Root for Newt 4. Brick
layers 3. The Great Cornholios
(Huh huh) 2. Short But Not Too
Quick 1. Trees, Peas & Cheese.
Beat LA.: In its biggest test thus
far, Mike Montgomery's men's bas
ketball team will look to defeat No. 4

UCLA in Pauley Pavilion tonight.
Stanford's Brevin Knight, facing off
against UCLA's Tyus Edney in the
backcourt, will provide excitement,
but the Cardinal must contain the
Bruin big men Ed and Charles
O'Bannon and George Zidek, espe
cially on the glass, to pick up the
win.
Play Ball: The Cardinal baseball
team, ranked No. 1 by Baseball
America, opens its season tomorrow
against St. Mary's at Sunken Dia
mond. Forget about Major League
Baseball (if you haven't already) —
if you've never been out there,
Sunken Diamond is a great place to
spend a lazy weekend afternoon
watching good baseball.

Super Saturday: While you're
waiting for Sunday's sporting
spectacle, bide your time with a
Stanford Sports Saturday. The
men's and women's tennis teams
will host San Diego and UNLV
respectively at the varsity courts,
wrestling will entertain Oregon
State in Burnham Pavilion and the
women's hoopsters will "Pac the
Pavilion" against USC. The most
interesting contests of the day are
likely to be the No. 1 women's
swimming and diving squad taking
on No. 3 USC at 1 p.m. at
deGuerre Pool and the No. 2 men's
volleyball team clashing with
defending NCAA champion Penn
State in Burnham.
Go Cardinal!
