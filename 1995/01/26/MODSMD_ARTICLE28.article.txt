# Wrestlers to tumble with Ducks, Beavers
## 
### Ratha Harntha Contributing writer 
Confronting a single Pacific
10 Conference wrestling power
is one thing, but stepping up
against such opposition on
back-to-back days is quite
another.
The Stanford wrestling team
(2-3 overall, 2-2 in the Pac-10)
will face the latter challenge
when Oregon State and Oregon
come charging into Burnham
Pavilion this weekend.
"Oregon State and Oregon
are heavily favored," said head
coach Chris Horpel. "The mid
season is the toughest time.
The question is will they be on a
roll or going fiat."
Oregon State, the defending

Pac-10 champion, has dropped
dramatically from its preseason
No. 3 ranking. Although the
Beavers' roster boasts five grap
plers ranked nationally in the
top 10 — including Les Crutch
es, last year's NCAA runner up
and the No. 1-ranked wrestler
in the country at 177 lbs —
Oregon State has sustained
numerous injuries. Many of
them came during grueling dual
meets, including the National
Dual Meet.
"I'm not sure who we're fac
ing," Horpel said. "The ques
tion is are they going to be
healthy." If Oregon State is still
recovering from their competi
tions, then Stanford will be in
good shape, Horpel added.
In contrast to the Beavers,
for the first time this season all
of the Cardinal's starters will
wrestle on Saturday. Senior co
captain Jay Jackson and junior
Matt Cano, who both missed
last Saturday's meet against
UC-Davis, will compete this
weekend but probably will not
be at 100 percent.

'Everyone will have
their toughest
matches of the year.'
— Jimmy Aguirre

"We're a good dual meet
team when we're healthy," Hor
pel said. "We're not competitive
unless we have our starters."
Jackson, who is 19-5 this
year, will move up to the 142-
lbs. division and junior co-cap
tain Jimmy Aguirre will wrestle
at 134 lbs. The undefeated
Aguirre will have his hands full
against Beaver Babak Maham
madi, the defending Pac-10
champion. Mahammadi is cur
rently ranked second in the
nation.
Junior Sahlan Martin, who
wrestled in his first dual meet
last Saturday, will move down
to 158 lbs. while junior Mark
Ryzewicz fills his shoes in the
167-pound division. Juniors
Brian Mcßeth (118 lbs.) and

Tod Surmon (150), sophomores
Roger Liu (177) and Bryan Van
iman (190) and freshman
heavyweight Mark Neglay
round out the starting lineup.
"This is definitely the tough
est competition," Aguirre said.
"Everyone will have their
toughest matches of the year.
Their best are at our best."
That prospect does not daunt
the Cardinal however.
"I think we can keep it
close," Surmon said. "They
aren't as strong as they've been
in the past. This weekend will
be tough."
Indeed it will. As if the
Beavers were not enough for
one weekend, Stanford will
have to come right back on Sun
day to face Oregon.
The Ducks boast three
nationally-ranked athletes,
including Cory Sonnen, the
defending Pac-10 champion at
142 lbs. Jackson has split his
two encounters with Sonnen.
Cano, who is 17-6 with four
pins this year, will likely experi
ence the toughest weekend as
he will face two opponents who
are ranked at 126 lbs. After he
grapples with seventh-ranked
Dave Nieradka of Oregon State
on Saturday night, he will tan
gle with sixth-ranked Jeremy
Ensrud of Oregon on Sunday
afternoon.
"Both teams are really
solid," Aguirre said. "[These
meets] will show us how we're
doing. We're good enough to
compete."
Jackson took Aguirre's confi
dence one step further.
"I think we can knock them
off," he said.
