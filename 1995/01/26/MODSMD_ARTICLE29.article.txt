# Looking for its 13th straight win
## Women's basketball to host UCLA 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The Stanford women's bas
ketball team hopes to add one
more to its 12-game winning
streak tonight.
After demolishing California
by a score of 99-65 last week,
the Cardinal (14-1, 5-0 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) will host
UCLA (7-8, 2-4) at 7:30 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.
For the contest, numbers and
statistics jump into the fore
front, and first on the list is the
number one.
1 — The current winning
streak for Stanford in this rival
ry is one after the Bruins upset
the Cardinal last year at Pauley
Pavilion, 80-73. Prior to that
game, Stanford had taken the
previous 10 contests. Before
that, UCLA had won 16 of the
first 17 meetings between the
two teams.
The Cardinal exacted
revenge later in 1994, winning
94-82 in a game marred by the
season-ending injury to Bruins
star Natalie Williams.
2 — UCLA junior center Kisa
Hughes has an affixation with
double digits. She currently is
averaging a double double per
game. Hughes leads the Pac-10
in rebounding with over 10 a
contest and also leads the Bru
ins in scoring with 18 points per
game.
3 — Hughes recently joined
three other UCLA greats when
she scored over 30 points and
grabbed over 20 rebounds in
single games. She joined that

exclusive club when she tallied
20 rebounds against Boise State
on Dec. 3. The other three
UCLA players to achieve the
mark include Williams, Denise
Curry and the legendary Ann
Meyers.
4 — Stanford sophomore
swingman Kate Starbird dished
out four assists against Cal.
While failing to lead the team
for that contest, Starbird still
paces the Cardinal in points and
assists over the season with
16.8 points and 4.1 assists per
game.
If she ends the year leading
the team in both categories,
Starbird would be the first to do
so since Jennifer Azzi in 1988-
1989. Starbird currently ranks
among the top 10 in the confer
ence in seven different cate
gories, including scoring,
blocked shots, field goal and
three-point percentage, free
throw percentage, steals and
assists.
5 — The Cardinal was ranked
fifth in both the AP and USA
Today/CNN polls until this
week. Stanford moved up one
spot into fourth after Louisiana
Tech lost to Western Kentucky.
Currently ranked ahead of the
Cardinal are No. 1 Connecticut,
No. 2 Tennessee and No. 3
North Carolina.
6 — The five freshmen who
have added to Stanford's depth
all stand six feet or taller.
Olympia Scott has started every
game, leading the team with 6.1
rebounds per outing while con
tributing 8.4 points per game. She
also has two double doubles, after
tallying her second against Cal.
Heather Owen plavs a major

role coming off the bench. Often
the first substitute for the Cardi
nal, she averages 6.5 points and
3.7 rebounds per game in only 13
minutes. After completing her
sojourn in volleyball, Kristin
Folkl is starting to contribute to
the team. Folkl only plays an
average of 10 minutes per game

but manages over seven points
and nearly three rebounds during
that span. As she gains more
experience, her time on the floor
can only go up.
Naomi Mulitauaopele is anoth
er one of the towers of power.
Mulitauaopele plays approximate
ly 10 minutes every frame, adding

six points and three rebounds.
Guard Regan Freuen, despite
playing only 45 minutes so far,
can also score. She averages 2.7
points per game during her five
minutes on the court.
13 — With a win, the number
of consecutive victories for Stan
ford after tonight.
