# First vote on CUE to be made today
## Fac Sen to look at writing, language proposals 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate will decide
today whether to strengthen the
University's writing and foreign
language requirements, as recom
mended by the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education.
If the changes are approved,
high school study will no longer
satisfy the foreign language re
quirement, and every department
will have to add a "writing-inten
sive" course to its major require
ments.
These reforms will be the first of
the commission's proposals to
come to a vote in the senate.
"Imagine that — we're actually
going to come to a decision,"
quipped Biology Prof. Bob Simoni,
the senate chair.
Today's debate, however, will be
an important one, Simoni said, be
cause certain "questions of princi
ple" will be addressed.
One question that may be

raised, Simoni said, is "How impor
tant a part of a liberal education is
language study?" Or, more precise
ly, "Is it more or less important
than other important things stu
dents are required to do?"
Along with addressing such the
oretical issues, the debate could
also be seen as an important first
test of the senate's willingness to
enact reform.
The first senate entity to consid
er the proposed changes, the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Study,
actually went beyond the commis
sion's recommendations.
Instead of giving students the
option to complete one year of lan
guage study or take a proficiency
test, the senate committee would
have required a proficiency test of
all students.
That proposal, however,
sparked considerable opposition at
a December senate meeting, and
yesterday the committee altered its
recommendation and eliminated
the proficiency test requirement.
Even Simoni, who normally
remains aloof from the senate
debate was critical of the proficien
cy test. "That was a problem from
the outset," he said. "We don't set
up a proficiency test for anything
else."
Under the revised proposal, the
foreign language requirement
could be met by one year of col
lege-level study, a score of 4 or 5 on
an Advanced Placement test, or a
yet-to-be-determined "passing"
grade on an achievement test.
As Spanish and Portuguese
Prof. Mary Pratt pointed out, that
proposal is in part "a return to the
proposal that came out of (the
commission) to begin with."
History Prof. James Sheehan,
who chaired the commission's
year-long study of virtually every
aspect of the University's under
graduate curriculum, said he is
"eager to see some of [the reforms]
become reality."
The exact form of the strength
ened requirement is relatively
unimportant, he said. "They're all
improvements over what we have
now."

Sheehan predicted that both
the foreign language and writing
requirement changes would pass
the senate today.
These two commission propos
als have already survived the sen
ate's committee process more or
less intact, and extending the
writing requirement has faced rel
atively little opposition, in con
trast to the proposed proficiency
test.
But opposition to the foreign
language proposal, which included
the proficiency test, could hint at
substantial senate resistance to
more far-reaching reforms.
History Prof. Nancy Kollmann,
who presented the writing propos
al to the senate in December, spec
ulated that those changes were
better received because "faculty
understood that it's not exactly an
incremental requirement — it's an
enhancement of an existing pro
gram."
The proposal would allow
departments to design their own
writing-intensive courses, she
added, working with colleagues
from the Writing Across the Cur
riculum program.
The only potential roadblock to
the writing reforms Kollmann
could imagine was that "in the
context of the (commission)
reforms" senators would backlash
against reform in general.
