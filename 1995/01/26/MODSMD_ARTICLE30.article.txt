# Women swimmers to face USC, UCLA
## Jenny Thompson to swim in final home dual meets 
### John Lawson Contributing writer 
After cruising to easy victo
ries against Arizona and Ari
zona State last weekend, the
top-ranked Stanford women's
swimming and diving team (3-0,
2-0 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) returns to action at
deGuerre Pool this weekend.
The Cardinal hosts a pair of 1
p.m. dual meets against confer
ence rivals No. 9 UCLA on Fri
day and No. 3 USC on Saturday.
Although the season runs
through the middle of March,
this weekend marks the last
home dual contests for Stan
ford, and that means the final
home dual meets for senior
stars such as Eileen Richetelli
and Jenny Thompson.
"Last week's meets were
pretty relaxed," Thompson
said. "I think the UCLA meet
will have a similar atmosphere,
but I expect USC to put up a big
fight."

The Bruins (5-3) finished
fourth in the Pac-10 and sev
enth at the NCAA Champi
onships last year but lost a
strong contingent of quality
swimmers to graduation.

potent one-two combination in
middle distance freestylers

Salmeen, Stanford head coach

Richard Quick does not think
the Bruins have enough talent
and depth to stay with the Car
dinal throughout the meet.
"UCLA is on the level of Ari
zona and Arizona State," Quick
said. "They are not that strong
of a team and shouldn't provide
us with that tough of a meet."
The Trojans, on the other
hand, are a totally different
matter. Although they finished
third in the Pac-10 and sixth in
the NCAAs last year, USC (5-0)
is considered by many to be the
Cardinal's equal this year.
In Kristine Quance, the Tro
jans return the 1994 Pac-10
Women's Swimmer of the Year
and the No. 1 individual point
scorer at the NCAAs. In last
year's Championships, Quance,

then a freshman, won the 200-
yard breast stroke, 200 IM and
400 IM and also led the Trojans'
800 free relay team to a first
place finish.
"USC has both talent and
depth," said senior co-captain
Becky Crowe. "They got a great
recruiting class this year, so
they should be really tough. We
will need to pay full attention to
detail, making sure that we exe
cute our starts and turns as well
as we can."
Quick, in his seventh year at
the helm of the Cardinal, could
see his perfect 46-0 dual meet
record tarnished by USC. As of
last Friday's meet, Stanford's
dual-meet win streak stands at
47, with the Cardinal's last loss
coming on Feb. 6, 1988 when

Stanford fell to Texas, 90-50, in
Austin.
Although resting before dual
meets could enhance his team's
performance, Quick stands
behind his long-term training
regimen in hopes that the Car
dinal will reach tip-top form for
the NCAAs in March. The team,
therefore, continues to practice
rigorously in pursuit of a four
peat.
"Our main goal is the
NCAAs, and that's what we
train for," Quick said. "But
that's not to say that we don't
give it our best effort every time
we go out there. The USC meet
should be as exciting as Michi
gan, and we will need all the
support that a home crowd and
a home pool can give."
