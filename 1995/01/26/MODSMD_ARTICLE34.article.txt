# SASS
## IN A WORD: Jewel Kilcher Stops by the CoHo 
### Lauren Neefe 
yes, the first word th.it comes to mind issass
... that is if you've noticed Jewel Kilcher
playing at the Coffee House recently.
She can seem so innocent, even angelic with
her rosy cheeks and pale freckles, hardly able to
convince you she's lived the 20 years she has.
She can seem gentle and vulnerable as she dos
es her eyes and brushes her right ear across her
shoulder. Or the way she avoids the applause at
the end of a song, lowering her eyes and reach
ing behind her head to scratch that silly itch
called modesty.
Hut then she'll sneak up on you in a song like
"She Cries". Singing "Ignorance is blissss," she'll
bare her teeth and that sweet demeanor will
ease into a vicious hiss. The way subtle joking
often intends the deepest cuts, Jewel's quiet wit
hints at the dangerous sting she can direct even
to an inattentive Coffee-House audience. Dis
guising her frustration with a thanks, Jewel
confessed, "I'm glad I get paid to do this — play
for you guys who don't even listen too much."
Although coffeehouses are usually her fa
vorite venues, the Stanford Coffee House has
been one of the most difficult places for Jewel to
perform. "I hate people talking while I'm
singing," she says."I mean, if two women want
to talk about the sweaters they bought that day,
can't they do it somewhere else?"
Yes, when I think of Jewel, the first word that
comes to mind is sass. Life is not happening to
Jewel Kilcher. Jewel is happening to Life.
/met Jewel Kilcher in the Coffee House
about a week ago, and before I had even
settled down to ask any questions, she beat
me to it.
"What's your middle name?" she asked.
"Aimee," I answered, (who's interviewing
who here?)
So 1 asked, "And what's your middle name?"
"I don't have one." Jewel explained she al
ways wanted a middle name so she started col
lecting them — life is all about collecting things
and trying on beliefs, she said.
Jewel Kilcher has been singing since she was

(i years old when her family started traveling
and performing throughout Alaska.
Jewel believes you have to "get out of the en
vironment [you're] raised in" so that you can
learn how much control you have over your
destiny. She graduated from a performing arts
high school in Michigan where, as she noted
during one of her Col lo sets, she was looking
for the blues and got opera instead.
But Jewel didn't want to go to college so she
proceeded to pass the time from place to place,
getting hired and tired. Vista, Calif., San Fran
cisco, Aguanga, Calif., Colorado and finally San
1 )icgo where she moved into her VW van, start
ed to surf and play the guitar.
In Alaska, "whenever 1 had a problem, [I
could] get on a horse and ride away." To keep
herself sane, she learned to surf: it's "a rhythm
within the monotone of the city." But it was in
San Diego that Jewel got a job she wanted to
keep — playing her music at the Innerchange

Coffeehouse. It was in San Diego that Jewel de
cided to happen.
Now the music business is "a whole new ball
game" for Jewel Kilcher, who releases her first
album next month. She has discovered that the
music business requires 24 hours of devotion
every day and finds herself calling home as
much as possible.
I asked Jewel whether she looks out over the
audience as she performs for college students,
and thinks about how different her life is from
theirs, and she replied, "No, not really."
Instead she looks for the similarities, "How
the same our lives are: we all have fear; we all
want love."
I consider myself a writer before I'm a per
former." Jewel has been writing poetry since she
was young. She writes by "having the words
form around the emotion." Although songs like
"My Own Private God's Gift to Women" and
"Adrian" seem inspired by personal experience,

she says her imagination and her "empathetic
awareness" play an important role in her writ
ing.
When I ask her about an apparent tension
between the anger and the sympathy she ex
presses in her songs, she says she doesn't think
there is any such tension. But then she recon
siders the question, acknowledging the "disillu
sionment and angst" of her earlier songs, and
admitting to her own "cheese factor" as re
vealed in the lyrics of "I'm Sensitive," a song she
would avoid but is forced to perform by popu
lar demand.
"I'm not a very good musician," she said, ig
noring the irony in light of all she has accom
plished in the past two years.
Jk s I chatted with Jewel's friend Wally alter
J\ she left to do the sound check, he ex
F I plained how he knew when he met Jewel
that she would be taken seriously. Unlike other
musicians, she had laid out every step of her
ambitious course of action. She confidently in
sisted she wouldn't sign to the first label who of
fered her a contract — she would wait until she
got four or five offers. Now that she is with At
lantic, the waiting seems to have paid off.
Hut Jewel doesn't want to be a superstar. Shi
hates the distance created by awe. She calls it
"divine damnation," and she experienced it
when she met Neil Young while recording
songs at his Broken Arrow Ranch home studio:
"He's legendary, you know? It was like ... I
didn't want to say a word."
No, I think Jewel wants to stay close to peo
ple. She likes talking to people and "checking
out people's lives," collecting their stories and
their autographs.
As we were finishing up, 1 complimented
Jewel on her ring, one with a giant turquoise
stone which caught my eye when she played at
the Coffee House the week before. She thanked
me, mentioning thoughtfully that she had
owned it for a long time.
And when 1 asked her if it was a gift, she
laughed and said, "1 think I stole it." ■

been one of the most difficult places for Jewel to
perform. "I hate people talking while I'm
singing," she says."I mean, if two women want
to talk about the sweaters they bought that day,
can't they do it somewhere else?"
Yes, when I think of Jewel, the first word that
comes to mind is sass. Life is not happening to
Jewel Kilcher. Jewel is happening to Life.
/met Jewel Kilcher in the Coffee House
about a week ago, and before I had even
settled down to ask any questions, she beat
me to it.
"What's your middle name?" she asked.
"Aimee," I answered, (who's interviewing
who here?)
So 1 asked, "And what's your middle name?"
"I don't have one." Jewel explained she al
ways wanted a middle name so she started col
lecting them — life is all about collecting things
and trying on beliefs, she said.
Jewel Kilcher has been singing since she was

(i years old when her family started traveling
and performing throughout Alaska.
Jewel believes you have to "get out of the en
vironment [you're] raised in" so that you can
learn how much control you have over your
destiny. She graduated from a performing arts
high school in Michigan where, as she noted
during one of her Col lo sets, she was looking
for the blues and got opera instead.
But Jewel didn't want to go to college so she
proceeded to pass the time from place to place,
getting hired and tired. Vista, Calif., San Fran
cisco, Aguanga, Calif., Colorado and finally San
1 )icgo where she moved into her VW van, start
ed to surf and play the guitar.
In Alaska, "whenever 1 had a problem, [I
could] get on a horse and ride away." To keep
herself sane, she learned to surf: it's "a rhythm
within the monotone of the city." But it was in
San Diego that Jewel got a job she wanted to
keep — playing her music at the Innerchange

Coffeehouse. It was in San Diego that Jewel de
cided to happen.
Now the music business is "a whole new ball
game" for Jewel Kilcher, who releases her first
album next month. She has discovered that the
music business requires 24 hours of devotion
every day and finds herself calling home as
much as possible.
I asked Jewel whether she looks out over the
audience as she performs for college students,
and thinks about how different her life is from
theirs, and she replied, "No, not really."
Instead she looks for the similarities, "How
the same our lives are: we all have fear; we all
want love."
I consider myself a writer before I'm a per
former." Jewel has been writing poetry since she
was young. She writes by "having the words
form around the emotion." Although songs like
"My Own Private God's Gift to Women" and
"Adrian" seem inspired by personal experience,

she says her imagination and her "empathetic
awareness" play an important role in her writ
ing.
When I ask her about an apparent tension
between the anger and the sympathy she ex
presses in her songs, she says she doesn't think
there is any such tension. But then she recon
siders the question, acknowledging the "disillu
sionment and angst" of her earlier songs, and
admitting to her own "cheese factor" as re
vealed in the lyrics of "I'm Sensitive," a song she
would avoid but is forced to perform by popu
lar demand.
"I'm not a very good musician," she said, ig
noring the irony in light of all she has accom
plished in the past two years.
Jk s I chatted with Jewel's friend Wally alter
J\ she left to do the sound check, he ex
F I plained how he knew when he met Jewel
that she would be taken seriously. Unlike other
musicians, she had laid out every step of her
ambitious course of action. She confidently in
sisted she wouldn't sign to the first label who of
fered her a contract — she would wait until she
got four or five offers. Now that she is with At
lantic, the waiting seems to have paid off.
Hut Jewel doesn't want to be a superstar. Shi
hates the distance created by awe. She calls it
"divine damnation," and she experienced it
when she met Neil Young while recording
songs at his Broken Arrow Ranch home studio:
"He's legendary, you know? It was like ... I
didn't want to say a word."
No, I think Jewel wants to stay close to peo
ple. She likes talking to people and "checking
out people's lives," collecting their stories and
their autographs.
As we were finishing up, 1 complimented
Jewel on her ring, one with a giant turquoise
stone which caught my eye when she played at
the Coffee House the week before. She thanked
me, mentioning thoughtfully that she had
owned it for a long time.
And when 1 asked her if it was a gift, she
laughed and said, "1 think I stole it." ■
