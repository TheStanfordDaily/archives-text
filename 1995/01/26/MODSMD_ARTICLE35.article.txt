Heads.... Heads.... Heads.... Heads..
.. After viewing the sheer brilliance of
Tom Stoppards' "Rosencrantz and
iuildenstern are Dead," I've decided that any

word good enough to consume
his entire opening scene is more
than good enough to open an ar
ticle extolling his play's virtues.
Stoppard turns his wit on the
Bard in the American Conserva
tory Theater's production of
"Rosencrantz and Guilden
stern," — playing at the Stage
Door Theatre through Feb. 5 —
and the hilarity never stops.
The excellence of Stoppards

a
n
d

writing overwhelms all other aspects of the
production. He keeps us laughing so hard that
we can neither seriously nor critically watch
him deconstruct William Shakespeare's
"Hamlet."
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are two
minor characters in Shakespeare's tragedy —
I iamlet's old friends manipulated by the king
and queen to take Hamlet to England and his

death. But those who are merely
minor details to Shakespeare are cen
tral to Stoppard.
So he rewrites the story from their
point of view: we see the confusion of
two innocent dolts inadvertently
drawn into the intrigue of Danish roy
alty. The duo is often forgets their own
names and thoroughly bewildered by
the complexities of flipping coins.
Dan Hiatt as Guildenstern and Ray
Porter as Rosencrantz turn in magnif
icent performances. Tall, lanky Hiatt,
as the slightly more on-the-ball
Guildenstern, alternates with ease
and grace between amazement at his
partner's stupidity and total confu-

sion about the events surrounding him.
Portly Porter (in his A.C.T. debut) does
Rosencrantz's gullible naivete with a genuine
simplicity. In their characters' own stupidity, the

a
r

actors allow their own talent to
shine through — perhaps most
clearly during a scene where
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
play their own version of a game
called "Questions."
The game
starts off when
one of the pair
asks a ques-
The rules
allow no state-

ments, repeated
questions or rhetorical questions. The
often-illogical string of questions flies fast
and furious, and lasts until one catches the
other in a mistake. Scored like tennis, "ques-

lions' is enough to leave both participants and
spectators in stitches.
In addition to Stoppard's brilliant quips,
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern" contains
scores of lines from the original tragedy. Fill
ing in as the rest of the "Hamlet" cast is a tal
ented group of A.C.T. familiar faces.
As the Player (head of a group of four
somewhat disreputable tragedians), larion
Monroe acts as both mirror and critic of soci
ety with considerable aplomb. Blond
Jamison Jones leads the royal crew as
the brooding Danish prince Ham
let, wandering the stage mutter
ing to himself and managing to
look constantly disturbed at the
flurry of activity around him.

The halls of Elsinore, the primary setting for
both "Hamlet" and "Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern," are sparsely decorated, allowing
our imaginations to rule and create a place for
ourselves in the seeming madness of the past.
Hamlet's appearance represents the tem
poral duality of Stoppard's play. Set during the
time period of "Hamlet" and with costumes
mostly reflecting that era, a few select props —
including Hamlet's studded black leather mo
torcycle pants — are indicative of the mod
ern time period in which "Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern" is performed.
Other marks of modernity include a big,
yellow, canvas beach chair for sunbathing and
an accompanying umbrella which indicates
Hamlet's leisurely journey to England. A fur
ther twist in the production: instead of the
English accents customarily accompanying
"Hamlet," we hear American accents.
In some ways, the American accents help
emphasize Rosencrantz's and Guildenstern's
roles as "everymen" — commoners, much like
ourselves, lost in the sometimes surreal, some
times unreal royal environment, lust as they
are trying to figure out "heads" and "tails" by

flipping coins in the
first scene, the duo
tries to make heads
and tails out of their
lives and journey
through Elsinore.

And Stoppard's play is definitely a leg of the
journey worth watching. ■
