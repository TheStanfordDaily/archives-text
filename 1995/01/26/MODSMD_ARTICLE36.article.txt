# No riot grrls or Go-Gos incarnates, the women of jale come onto the scene

With the Afghan Whigs' "Gentle
men" disc blaring over the PA and
cigarette smoke wafting through
the air, the narrow confines of Bottom of the
[fill seem the furthest thing from the pastoral
splendor that jale bassist Laura Stein conjures
up.
At least for an instant, Stein wanders back
a bit, recalling images of "the little lambs trol
icking" and the beautiful mountains the band
took in as it drove along the California coast
on a day off from gigging. As she revels in the
memory of picnicking by the sea and in vision
of rainbows, the "1" in jale confides that, "We
were all just amazed how great our lives were."
Yet on this chilly December night, the
foursome basks in the hazy stage lights as it
tears through a set of rugged pop songs on the
cramped platform. The band fills the stale air
with pretty vocal harmonizing anil choppy
guitar licks, whipping up a pretty fair live fac
«imile of the melodious material heard on
their excellent 1994 debut, "Dream Cake."
And though it's the first time jale has played
around these parts, the intent crowd seems fa
miliar with the group's output, bobbing to the
buoyant rhythms and calling out requests.
Literally and figuratively, jale — Jennifer-
Alyson-Laura-Eve for long — has made
great strides since the band came to
gether in 1992, graduating from their Halifax,

Nova Scotia, home and its much-hailed
music scene to modest success in college rock
circles rather quickly. Certainly, the band de-

serves the accolades and attention it
has garnered since the summertime
release of "Dream Cake," an endearing
collection of jingle-jangle gems which
sounds so complete that its all too easy
to get caught up in the band s preco-

cious talents and lose sight of the music itselt.
"Well, 1 think that everybody must have a
pretty strong intuitive musical sense," Stein
says."I hate talking about our lack of experi
ence because I feel sometimes I read stuff | and
all it says is], 'They didn't know how to play
their instruments until blah, blah, blah. But,
at the same time, it's true.
"We started by singing, because we kind of

knew we could sing. We
had basic chords on gui
tars and stuff. I guess the
way we wrote songs had
to do more with the
singing first. And then,
the music, instead of
being simultaneous,
sort of lagged behind.
Maybe that lends itself
more to melody, doing it
that way, as opposed to
coming up with the
music first and then
sticking the melody in."
"Dream Cake" serves
up a platter of relentless
melody, where the
gooey vocals contrast
with the buzzing music
which surrounds them
to create an overall ef
fect that's noisily pleas
ant. And though the
band doesn't blaze any
new trails on their recent

album, jale's charm impacts because it makes
something fresh and lively out of a formula
that's often staid and trite.
Take your pick of should-be hits: "Mend"
hounds and hurdles with Jennifer Pierce's and
Eve Hartling's bright guitar work and Stein's
rubbery grooves; "Again" gurgles with drum
mer Alyson MacLeod's heavy beat and throb
bing guitar while interchangeable voices wrap
around one another to breathily deliver the
indistinguishable lyrics. "Promise," from
jale's first Sub Pop single, is a smooth ditty,
one of those classic pop tunes that leaves
something behind with every listen.
If any cut testifies to jale's honed craft, it's
theJwangy "River," which was originally a b
side on "Steppin' Out," the hand's second
seven inch. In and of itself, the song marks
the group s rapid progress: what started as a
sparse little number turned up as a zingy,
country-tinged piece on the album, a bal
anced song where swing and sway comple
ments the band's straightforward power pop
antics rather than obscuring them. Stein gives
"Dream Cake" producer Brad Wood (Liz
Phair, Red Red Meat) some of the credit for

directing the band to a more refined product,
noting that "he was really right on in terms of
what kind of sound we wanted."
Still, more than any recording technique,
practice and the on-the-job training that
comes with touring has naturally helped the
ever-maturing band become better acquaint
ed with the job of making music.
"1 think we're now at a point where we feel
more comfortable with our instruments,"
Stein says."And we're experimenting more
with them and getting different sounds and
not just playing distorted guitars. It's sort of
getting the sounds you want to get."
It seems that jale has been on the high end
of the learning curve from the start, when
the four art school students created a band

though they owned no instruments and pos
sessed little musical experience. Five weeks
into what's become pretty close to a career, the
hand was asked hv fellow Haligonian popsters
Sloan to open at that group's ('D release party.
Despite Stein's reluctance to perform, the
others jumped at the chance, whether they
were ready or not.
In a sense, the band got caught up in the
Nova Scotia feeding frenzy (which resulted in
Sloan signing to Geffen and New Brunswick's
Eric's Trip to Sub Pop) before it had gotten its
act together. Smartly, jale turned down a
long-term offer by Island Records put for
ward only seven months after the band's for
mation.
Instead, the quartet caught the attention of
Sub Pop in its pursuit ot Sloan and was asked
by the label to record a track for a Maritime
province compilation called "Never Mind the
Mollusks." As it goes, one thing led to anoth
er and the band found itsell with a Sub Pop
contract in hand.
Looking backwards, the Sub Pop deal
seems to have been just about the best
thing that could've happened to the band.

With the aesthetic of an indie label but the
resources which can challenge the majors,
Stein says that signing to Sub Pop has given
jale the freedom to enter the music busi
ness on their own terms and at their own
speed. Rather than being buried and lost in
an endless lineup of bright bands at a
major (as Sloan has at Geffen), getting the
good word out about jale and "Dream
Cake" has been a priority for Sub Pop. And
with Sub Pop's recent business agreement
with Elektra Entertainment, jale will likely
get many major label advantages with none
of the hassles.
"Every once in while, [Sub Pop says], 'We
really think you should do blah, blah, blah,'
Stein tells. "And we say, 'We don't really
think so.' And we win usually. So it's good to

know that we can
probably win any
argument. It's nice
to know the people
around you. It's
easy to call up (Sub
Fop founders)
Jonathan (Pone
man) or Bruce
(Pavitt) and talk to
them and that's
amazing, lust to
call them up and
say, 'We're freaking
out.' They'll calm
you down and let
you know what
you need to know.
It's nice and di
rect."
Yet inevitably,
there are
those grow
ing pangs that nei
ther greater dist rib-

ution nor personal support can make disap
pear; for jale, it's to endure the swipes taken at
them by some embittered Canadian critics
and the constant misperceptions that they're
either riot grrrls or a newfangled version ol the
Go-Cios just because they share the same gen
der.
But in the end, those are variables that the
band has no control over. So, while such gibes
do irritate the band, the foursome seems to
take it all in stride, finding solace in meeting
Kristin 1 Jersh in the studio or in their 45 min
utes on stage. Or in a pleasure as simple as a
picnic on a day off.
"This is so short lived," Stein savs. "We re
not going to be the Rolling Stones and play
until we're 55. And there is kind of the sense
that, whenever 1 talk to my parents, there s al
ways this sort of, 'So, what are going to do
with your life?' And I try to say, 'Well, I m
doing it.'
"This is what I'm doing right now. So lar,
we've been able to support ourselves to some
extent. We're not making any money really,
but we're surviving. So that's good enough tor
now." ■
