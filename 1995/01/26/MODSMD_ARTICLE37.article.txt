# STANFORD CHAMBER CHORALE TAKES A "BROADWAY CAFE" BREAK FROM ITS REPERTOIRE
## 
### SAM PARK 
The "Broadway Cafe" is a sophisticated
place, a meeting ground for the witty and
the worldly. Loud Ethel Merman tunes
won't get past the maitre d', whereas tres chic
Cole Porter songs are vilkomnen ici.
Aboard the cruise liner Broadway Princess,
a playful crew and a colorful group of passen
gers merrily roll along to songs from over 10
different Broadway shows.
"1 think a score is most effective when it
blends seamlessly with the show's plot. Of
course, in 'Broadway Cafe' we've taken about
20 Broadway songs out of their original con
text, so it was a challenge for us to adapt the
script to the music," said co-director Mark
Tendall.
"Broadway Cafe," an annual event now in
its fifth year, is entirely put together by the
Stanford Chamber Chorale, a student group
that normally focuses on classical music.
"Like many members of the Chorale, when
1 sing, it's most often concert or operatic
music," Tendall said. "Singing Broadway songs
is a wonderful change of pace, since they're
more 'approachable' than most classical
music."
The songs are linked together by the interac
tion between the different characters, in
cluding a bickering couple fighting on their
25th wedding anniversary, a mysterious
woman recuperating from "surgery," an or
phan boy, a trio of showgirls and others.
"One tradition we've continued with this
year's show is to include music from a variety
of shows written over a long time span," Ten
dall said. "I'm betting that audiences will enjoy
music that was written in the 1930s and 1940s
just as much as that written in the 1980s and

19905."
Indeed the musical selection reflects many
different eras of Broadway history. Songs like
"The lady is a Tramp" (from "Babes in
Arms") and "Could I Leave You" (from "Fol
lies") reflect a more than 50-year span.
The songs are mostly quiet ballads or emo
tional musings. There's no Carol Channing
hysteria or the sappy romance of Hammer-

stein. It's the kind of music you
could imagine hearing at _

the lounge of the Plaza-
Athenee, not in

"Oklahoma."
"1 think
some people

believe tha
Broadway
music is
filled with
b i g
brawny
m en
singing
about
their con-

quests, and 1
damsels twit
tering on about

this and that," ~
leading ensemble

member Chris Nichols
said. "People view Broad-

way as a kitchy self-impressed
medium, hut the truth is that the artistic form
has a lot to offer."
Nichols stars in the two comical pieces of
the evening, a lively rendition of "If 1 Were a
Rich Man" (from "Fiddler on the Roof") and

from "Anything Goes," the duet "Friendship"
with co-ensemble member Matthew Francis,
who has a gift for acting silly and dancing
funny.
"What a better way to spend an evening
than watching your friends, peers and com
plete and total strangers sing really well, act
silly and dance funny on stage? And there's free
dessert," said ensemble member Lisa Mari
Flexner, who sines "I Can Cook Too"

from "On the Town."
"The show is less

about 'Broadway' per

e than about being
drawn into our
fantasy world,
L l . . :.l

complete with
stock charac
ters and

every cliche
in the
book."

The songs
were
chosen-

r
based on the
actors' voices
and what charac-

ters they could sing
and play.
"Usually someone

in the room [during brain

storming) would say, 'What about

.ww & , ..v.n.v, . ...U.
...' and name a song they would know," said
producer Kathleen Gregory, who has a big
number in "Broadway Baby" (from "Follies").
Most of the songs, however, are not big
time showstoppers. The Chorale has included

a lot of quiet, sophisticated and lyrically com
plex tunes, such as those of Stephen Sondheim
("Follies," "Sweeney Todd"). The choices in
duce a feeling of intimacy and elegance that
fits the evening's setting (a luxurious liner)
and theme (marriage, friendship, adult rela
tionships).
"One of our cast members will be perform
ing the song 'What Did 1 Have That I Don't
Have' from the musical 'On a Clear Day You
Can See Forever.' It's a great song with a very
pleasing melody, but what makes it work par
ticularly well for us is its lyrics, since they fit in
with a key element of our plot, which I can't
discuss since it's a surprise," Tendall said.
Tendall plays Nichols' father, and co-direc
tor Michelle Geoffrion-Vinci plays Tendall's
neglected and much put-upon wife.
Planning for the show started in mid-Octo
ber, with auditions open to Chorale members.
Four writers came up with a script, and the
cast of 20 or so started rehearsing this quarter.
"It's nice to take a break from classical
choral pieces and all the blending," said
Nichols. "I need to let my solo voice take
flight.' ■

from "On the Town."
"The show is less

about 'Broadway' per

e than about being
drawn into our
fantasy world,
L l . . :.l

complete with
stock charac
ters and

every cliche
in the
book."

The songs
were
chosen-

r
based on the
actors' voices
and what charac-

ters they could sing
and play.
"Usually someone

in the room [during brain

storming) would say, 'What about

.ww & , ..v.n.v, . ...U.
...' and name a song they would know," said
producer Kathleen Gregory, who has a big
number in "Broadway Baby" (from "Follies").
Most of the songs, however, are not big
time showstoppers. The Chorale has included

a lot of quiet, sophisticated and lyrically com
plex tunes, such as those of Stephen Sondheim
("Follies," "Sweeney Todd"). The choices in
duce a feeling of intimacy and elegance that
fits the evening's setting (a luxurious liner)
and theme (marriage, friendship, adult rela
tionships).
"One of our cast members will be perform
ing the song 'What Did 1 Have That I Don't
Have' from the musical 'On a Clear Day You
Can See Forever.' It's a great song with a very
pleasing melody, but what makes it work par
ticularly well for us is its lyrics, since they fit in
with a key element of our plot, which I can't
discuss since it's a surprise," Tendall said.
Tendall plays Nichols' father, and co-direc
tor Michelle Geoffrion-Vinci plays Tendall's
neglected and much put-upon wife.
Planning for the show started in mid-Octo
ber, with auditions open to Chorale members.
Four writers came up with a script, and the
cast of 20 or so started rehearsing this quarter.
"It's nice to take a break from classical
choral pieces and all the blending," said
Nichols. "I need to let my solo voice take
flight.' ■
