Kristin Hersh doesn't consider her
self a creative person. It's a startling
self-assessment, one that would
seem to contradict her role as "musician," as
an artist with the imaginative capacity to
project images and emotion through sound.
Without knowing any better, the stark re
mark might ring with hollow humility, espe
cially when put into the context of how
Hersh and her band Throwing Muses have
twisted and turned off well-trodden musical
paths for the past decade and a half.
But there's every reason to buy into what
Hersh is saying because she isn't selling a
thing: her cragglv speaking voice intimates
someone earnest behind it and radiates with
a sense of peace which reinforces every word
she utters.
The pristine 28-year-old will carefully re
late to you that she's the "stupidest one in
volved" in the music-making chain and tell
you that her job, in essence, is that of listen
ing and translating. As she puts it, "It's like
somebody's tricking me into writing the
songs they want to hear."
Ironically, that honesty which makes
Hersh such a captivating individual has
made her craft so befuddling to critics
and so evasive to a large audience since the
group began to be noticed in the mid 80s.
From the mystic images which has filled the
band's songs to the chilling howls that 1 lersh
has been wailing from her teens on, Throw
ing Muses and their leader have often been
perceived as weird and nutsy to say the least,
an oddball novelty that seemed best ap
proached with a love-'em-or
leave-'em-alone attitude.

Never part of the mainstream, it was
probably easier to marginalize their neo
folkie, hick-punk art crap than to escape it.
"When (we) released the [first] record,
the world at-large happens to [us]," Hersh
recalls. "And we had to hear that we were
from another planet, that we were so strange,
that I was so crazy, that I screamed and they
never heard screaming before and why was 1
always trying to be so weird. And I thought it
was just beautiful stuff that we were sharing.
I thought it was a party the whole time.
"That was kind of a slap in the face, be
cause in order to please the world, you have
to be hazed. It's unfortunate that thev told
such young people that."
While the band's six previous offerings
have largely come and gone unnoticed by all
but loyal Muses fans, a newfound focus on
Hersh and the Muses' distinctive music sur
rounds their latest effort, "University."
Hersh's successful solo acoustic project
might have something to do with why every
body is giving a damn this time around; her
well-regarded and well-received "Hips and
Makers" album sold more copies than any
thing she has been associated to in the past.
Or, if you believe the experts like Spin and
College Music Journal, maybe there's more
interest in "University" because it's a catchi
er take on the Muses' sonic mess that's ward
ed away a popular following.
From Hersh's perspective, the band "has
tricked a lot of people" into describing "Uni
versity," the band's first LP since the raucous
1992 recording "Red Heaven," as a "pop
album." Although she acknowledges that the

record is "very produced
and that its first four cut

are "as much as the Muses are capa
ble of being 'pop' or 'rock,' " she
points out that the new one isn't the
tidy package many critics seem to
think it is.
"I think it had a lot of strange
pieces on it that [the critics] forget
about because of the sequencing,
Hersh says."It slides off to kind of
weirdness, in my head, but they
don't seem to have noticed, so
maybe I shouldn't even be telling
you that. . . . I'm just waiting for
them to realize it's not as accessible
as they think it is. Maybe they're just
paying attention for the first time."
Clearly, "University" is cut of the
same material as its predecesors,
brimming with a visuality that's
etched by the images in Hersh's
lyrics and by the kinetic music. The
album isn't really an improvement
on or a progression of the Muses'
skill, but more like a new book with
an old story told in a slightly differ
ent way.
Yet "University" does stand out
with a fuller sound than any of its
predecessors, the result of having
"enough time to be self-indulgent,"
Hersh claims. The four "poppier"
cuts which open the 14-tune LP
make an instant impression: "Bright
Yellow Gun" and "Shimmer" leap
out with a boldness that comple
ments the shiny streaks that are the
band's trademark well, bouncing
with an edgy energy.
On the two songs, Hersh's guitar
still lashes and twinkles, but with a

greater presence than before.
The rhythm section keeps a re
silient beat, between longtime
Muse Dave Narcizo's charac
teristically crisp drumming
and new bassist Bernard
Georges' insistent grooves.
On "Hazing," "Universi-
third track, the trio
builds up a wall o' noise,
then crashes it down. It's
also the most free that Hersh's
stunning voice gets on the
album, moving from curt jabs
to no-sweat crooning to re
soundingly drawn-out notes
with thrilling ease.
The record's more difficult
moments are also more acces
sible via the souped-up pro
duction. The mayhem of "No
Way in Hell" engrosses fully,
with its coiling bursts of dis-

torted guitar accompanied by a syn
copated rhythm and Hersh's droning
vocals. The lucid twang of "Surf
Cowboy" follows on the heels of
"No Way in Hell," where the instru
ments lay down a lazy mood that's
a nice breather in the midst of all
the intensity.
Even "University"'s very

strangest piece, the title track
where the muted cries of Hersh's two chil
dren (eight-year-old Dylan and three-year
old Ryder) are backed by mother's soothing
guitar arrangement, proves eerily inviting.

Quirks and all, the album might prove to
be the Muses' well-deserved breakthrough,
as the Sire / Reprise band bio and the bevy of
ads in national music magazines seem to
hint. But stardom and buzz are two things in
which Hersh has little interest: after a record
has been made and released, all she expects
from her record company is the opportunity
to tour it.
"Luckily, we're not really attached to the
music biz thing," she explains. "We're not
looking to sell records. Otherwise, we'd be a
different kind of band. It's not hard to figure
out what gets played on the radio and who

becomes a famous star, you know. It's not
that hard. We always had kinda better things
to do. Not to be obnoxious about it, but there
were other songs we had to do first."
Around the time Throwing Muses
made "The Real Ramona," which
was released in 1991, Hersh decided
to put the group to bed. The time seemed
right: second stringer Tanya Donelly wanted
to forge ahead with her own projects and
Hersh herself "couldn't really remember why
[she] was in a band in the first place." To her,
the band was becoming formulaic, "trendy
and soulless, just like everybody else."

But those songs which had to be
done, which have haunted Hersh in
the form of visions since her adoles
cence, gave her no choice but to con
tinue making Throwing Muses
music. As she describes it, the songs
"didn't give a shit" that she was no
longer in a band, that she was about
to get married and was pregnant with
her second child. "They just kept
coming," tells Hersh, who has been
diagnosed with a bipolar condition
which causes hallucinations and
seizures.
"My songwriting process is a
strange one. 1 don't do it on purpose.
I never did. It just happened to me
one day when I was 13. I thought I
was hallucinating. I guess 1 was hallu
cinating.
"To me, songs are real guys. They
have heat, electricity and energy and
images. And 1 can't fight them off. 1
have to turn them into songs or else
they get stuck in my house or my
body and they do become hallucina
tions. So I could easily be a little bit
ter about it and say it was a curse. But
some of these guys are really neces
sary and, therefore, beautiful. As long
as I don't censor them, they say great
things, I think.
In a sense, penning an "awful pop
song" would constitute a betrayal of
Hersh's muse, would be a straying
away from her "real job" of "listen
ing." When a song comes on, Hersh,
hears it just as it will sound on the
record.
But because listening is such an ac
tive process, it requires Hersh to re
spond to the song before it begins to
manifest itself in images that jump
out of the wall, even if it means
climbing out of bed in the middle of
the night, putting her boots and
nightgown on and trudging over to
the studio.
"Serve the song," Hersh says with a
laugh, as if it were her motto.
"(Making songs] is not weirder than
having babies, if you ask me. I've
made 20 fingernails in my lifetime
and I don't know how to begin to
make a fingernail. That's magic.
That's crazy."
There's a natural calm in the
way Hersh describes the most
harrowing experiences, a
serenity that belies the impression
that she's a mad genius, the song
writer from another planet. Yet with-

out knowing any better, it's easy to read too
much into images of bright yellow guns and
pony tails, of water and sleep which run
through a number of Muse songs.
And that's maybe from where many ot the
misconceptions about Hersh and the group
come. With all the scattered symbolism
laden in the lyrics, it's easy to assume there's
a lot of intellectualizing going on under
neath the surface: about the tare on the
Muses'second album, 1988's "House Torna
do," Village Voice critic Robert Christgau
wrote that it was "bad poetry," which became
"obscure poetry" with 1989's "Hunkpapa."
Hersh is the first to admit that the Muses

don't make brainy music. As she told the
CM J New Music Monthly, "There's not a
whole lot of intellect in there." Rather,
Hersh's voice, words and music make a
unique visceral impact, conveying emotion
and spirit concretely. In that sense, Hersh
more than translates; she creates, turning
those real guys that have heat, electricity and
energy she hears into songs.
Nowhere does that natural vibrance
shine so brightly as on Hersh's re
cent solo acoustic efforts. On
"Hips and Makers," originally conceived for
herself and husband Billy O'Connell (who's
also the band's manager), Hersh overcame
her shyness and ventured on her own, with
nothing but her guitar, a few string arrange
ments and Michael Stipe singing backup on
a cut.
The result was one of 1994's most beauti
ful recordings, where the lush simplicity of
Hersh's voice and strummed strings defied
the cliche of "unplugged" with its rich tex
tures and carved a niche for Hersh in the
genre like the Muses have in rock.
"It was a new experience for me and
probably a good time in my career to have a
new experience," she says."I needed to be
thrust into something I didn't understand.
From the recording process on, I had never
really had to record an acoustic sound pic
ture. You know, build on sounds in a room.
Find a perfect room, the perfect old mikes,
play it reverb so that we weren't lying about
anything.
"All of a sudden, I was in big classical
halls, with everyone sitting in chairs and I

was sitting in a chair. It was so quiet and no
one was drunk hut me. And I had to make
that a musical experience.
"I did it knowing exactly what was going
to happen when I sat that piece of wood on
my lap, which is what always happens,
whether it was in my kitchen or in my bed
room. It's just that I had invited all those
people there too."
Although Hersh points out that the
acoustic songs could never be recorded by
the band, the projects really aren't as differ
ent as they seem on the surface: without
reading too much into what Hersh says,
both modes provide her an outlet to express
something honest and clear.
As much as listening and making music,
Hersh's job is to draw the line between
telling the truth and lying through her art,
because finding the right microphone and
the right room matters, because serving the
song faithfully is essential.
So even if "University" follows the other
Throwing Muses' albums into obscurity,
Kristin Hersh has found a comfort in what
she has created that has nothing to do with
popularity.
"From 'Red Heaven' on, I feel very suc
cessful, because it's all clean," she explains.
"There's nothing weighty about it, nothing
yucky, no bad feelings. Just a lot of hard
work and good music at the end and we've
been able to survive.
"We've been pretty hungry, but the band
has been able to afford to keep going and
that's the important thing. I'd rather be a
lousy waitress with a great band than a bad
rock star." ■

don't seem to have noticed, so
maybe I shouldn't even be telling
you that. . . . I'm just waiting for
them to realize it's not as accessible
as they think it is. Maybe they're just
paying attention for the first time."
Clearly, "University" is cut of the
same material as its predecesors,
brimming with a visuality that's
etched by the images in Hersh's
lyrics and by the kinetic music. The
album isn't really an improvement
on or a progression of the Muses'
skill, but more like a new book with
an old story told in a slightly differ
ent way.
Yet "University" does stand out
with a fuller sound than any of its
predecessors, the result of having
"enough time to be self-indulgent,"
Hersh claims. The four "poppier"
cuts which open the 14-tune LP
make an instant impression: "Bright
Yellow Gun" and "Shimmer" leap
out with a boldness that comple
ments the shiny streaks that are the
band's trademark well, bouncing
with an edgy energy.
On the two songs, Hersh's guitar
still lashes and twinkles, but with a

greater presence than before.
The rhythm section keeps a re
silient beat, between longtime
Muse Dave Narcizo's charac
teristically crisp drumming
and new bassist Bernard
Georges' insistent grooves.
On "Hazing," "Universi-
third track, the trio
builds up a wall o' noise,
then crashes it down. It's
also the most free that Hersh's
stunning voice gets on the
album, moving from curt jabs
to no-sweat crooning to re
soundingly drawn-out notes
with thrilling ease.
The record's more difficult
moments are also more acces
sible via the souped-up pro
duction. The mayhem of "No
Way in Hell" engrosses fully,
with its coiling bursts of dis-

torted guitar accompanied by a syn
copated rhythm and Hersh's droning
vocals. The lucid twang of "Surf
Cowboy" follows on the heels of
"No Way in Hell," where the instru
ments lay down a lazy mood that's
a nice breather in the midst of all
the intensity.
Even "University"'s very

strangest piece, the title track
where the muted cries of Hersh's two chil
dren (eight-year-old Dylan and three-year
old Ryder) are backed by mother's soothing
guitar arrangement, proves eerily inviting.

Quirks and all, the album might prove to
be the Muses' well-deserved breakthrough,
as the Sire / Reprise band bio and the bevy of
ads in national music magazines seem to
hint. But stardom and buzz are two things in
which Hersh has little interest: after a record
has been made and released, all she expects
from her record company is the opportunity
to tour it.
"Luckily, we're not really attached to the
music biz thing," she explains. "We're not
looking to sell records. Otherwise, we'd be a
different kind of band. It's not hard to figure
out what gets played on the radio and who

becomes a famous star, you know. It's not
that hard. We always had kinda better things
to do. Not to be obnoxious about it, but there
were other songs we had to do first."
Around the time Throwing Muses
made "The Real Ramona," which
was released in 1991, Hersh decided
to put the group to bed. The time seemed
right: second stringer Tanya Donelly wanted
to forge ahead with her own projects and
Hersh herself "couldn't really remember why
[she] was in a band in the first place." To her,
the band was becoming formulaic, "trendy
and soulless, just like everybody else."

But those songs which had to be
done, which have haunted Hersh in
the form of visions since her adoles
cence, gave her no choice but to con
tinue making Throwing Muses
music. As she describes it, the songs
"didn't give a shit" that she was no
longer in a band, that she was about
to get married and was pregnant with
her second child. "They just kept
coming," tells Hersh, who has been
diagnosed with a bipolar condition
which causes hallucinations and
seizures.
"My songwriting process is a
strange one. 1 don't do it on purpose.
I never did. It just happened to me
one day when I was 13. I thought I
was hallucinating. I guess 1 was hallu
cinating.
"To me, songs are real guys. They
have heat, electricity and energy and
images. And 1 can't fight them off. 1
have to turn them into songs or else
they get stuck in my house or my
body and they do become hallucina
tions. So I could easily be a little bit
ter about it and say it was a curse. But
some of these guys are really neces
sary and, therefore, beautiful. As long
as I don't censor them, they say great
things, I think.
In a sense, penning an "awful pop
song" would constitute a betrayal of
Hersh's muse, would be a straying
away from her "real job" of "listen
ing." When a song comes on, Hersh,
hears it just as it will sound on the
record.
But because listening is such an ac
tive process, it requires Hersh to re
spond to the song before it begins to
manifest itself in images that jump
out of the wall, even if it means
climbing out of bed in the middle of
the night, putting her boots and
nightgown on and trudging over to
the studio.
"Serve the song," Hersh says with a
laugh, as if it were her motto.
"(Making songs] is not weirder than
having babies, if you ask me. I've
made 20 fingernails in my lifetime
and I don't know how to begin to
make a fingernail. That's magic.
That's crazy."
There's a natural calm in the
way Hersh describes the most
harrowing experiences, a
serenity that belies the impression
that she's a mad genius, the song
writer from another planet. Yet with-

out knowing any better, it's easy to read too
much into images of bright yellow guns and
pony tails, of water and sleep which run
through a number of Muse songs.
And that's maybe from where many ot the
misconceptions about Hersh and the group
come. With all the scattered symbolism
laden in the lyrics, it's easy to assume there's
a lot of intellectualizing going on under
neath the surface: about the tare on the
Muses'second album, 1988's "House Torna
do," Village Voice critic Robert Christgau
wrote that it was "bad poetry," which became
"obscure poetry" with 1989's "Hunkpapa."
Hersh is the first to admit that the Muses

don't make brainy music. As she told the
CM J New Music Monthly, "There's not a
whole lot of intellect in there." Rather,
Hersh's voice, words and music make a
unique visceral impact, conveying emotion
and spirit concretely. In that sense, Hersh
more than translates; she creates, turning
those real guys that have heat, electricity and
energy she hears into songs.
Nowhere does that natural vibrance
shine so brightly as on Hersh's re
cent solo acoustic efforts. On
"Hips and Makers," originally conceived for
herself and husband Billy O'Connell (who's
also the band's manager), Hersh overcame
her shyness and ventured on her own, with
nothing but her guitar, a few string arrange
ments and Michael Stipe singing backup on
a cut.
The result was one of 1994's most beauti
ful recordings, where the lush simplicity of
Hersh's voice and strummed strings defied
the cliche of "unplugged" with its rich tex
tures and carved a niche for Hersh in the
genre like the Muses have in rock.
"It was a new experience for me and
probably a good time in my career to have a
new experience," she says."I needed to be
thrust into something I didn't understand.
From the recording process on, I had never
really had to record an acoustic sound pic
ture. You know, build on sounds in a room.
Find a perfect room, the perfect old mikes,
play it reverb so that we weren't lying about
anything.
"All of a sudden, I was in big classical
halls, with everyone sitting in chairs and I

was sitting in a chair. It was so quiet and no
one was drunk hut me. And I had to make
that a musical experience.
"I did it knowing exactly what was going
to happen when I sat that piece of wood on
my lap, which is what always happens,
whether it was in my kitchen or in my bed
room. It's just that I had invited all those
people there too."
Although Hersh points out that the
acoustic songs could never be recorded by
the band, the projects really aren't as differ
ent as they seem on the surface: without
reading too much into what Hersh says,
both modes provide her an outlet to express
something honest and clear.
As much as listening and making music,
Hersh's job is to draw the line between
telling the truth and lying through her art,
because finding the right microphone and
the right room matters, because serving the
song faithfully is essential.
So even if "University" follows the other
Throwing Muses' albums into obscurity,
Kristin Hersh has found a comfort in what
she has created that has nothing to do with
popularity.
"From 'Red Heaven' on, I feel very suc
cessful, because it's all clean," she explains.
"There's nothing weighty about it, nothing
yucky, no bad feelings. Just a lot of hard
work and good music at the end and we've
been able to survive.
"We've been pretty hungry, but the band
has been able to afford to keep going and
that's the important thing. I'd rather be a
lousy waitress with a great band than a bad
rock star." ■

Kristin Hersh doesn't consider her
self a creative person. It's a startling
self-assessment, one that would
seem to contradict her role as "musician," as
an artist with the imaginative capacity to
project images and emotion through sound.
Without knowing any better, the stark re
mark might ring with hollow humility, espe
cially when put into the context of how
Hersh and her band Throwing Muses have
twisted and turned off well-trodden musical
paths for the past decade and a half.
But there's every reason to buy into what
Hersh is saying because she isn't selling a
thing: her cragglv speaking voice intimates
someone earnest behind it and radiates with
a sense of peace which reinforces every word
she utters.
The pristine 28-year-old will carefully re
late to you that she's the "stupidest one in
volved" in the music-making chain and tell
you that her job, in essence, is that of listen
ing and translating. As she puts it, "It's like
somebody's tricking me into writing the
songs they want to hear."
Ironically, that honesty which makes
Hersh such a captivating individual has
made her craft so befuddling to critics
and so evasive to a large audience since the
group began to be noticed in the mid 80s.
From the mystic images which has filled the
band's songs to the chilling howls that 1 lersh
has been wailing from her teens on, Throw
ing Muses and their leader have often been
perceived as weird and nutsy to say the least,
an oddball novelty that seemed best ap
proached with a love-'em-or
leave-'em-alone attitude.

Never part of the mainstream, it was
probably easier to marginalize their neo
folkie, hick-punk art crap than to escape it.
"When (we) released the [first] record,
the world at-large happens to [us]," Hersh
recalls. "And we had to hear that we were
from another planet, that we were so strange,
that I was so crazy, that I screamed and they
never heard screaming before and why was 1
always trying to be so weird. And I thought it
was just beautiful stuff that we were sharing.
I thought it was a party the whole time.
"That was kind of a slap in the face, be
cause in order to please the world, you have
to be hazed. It's unfortunate that thev told
such young people that."
While the band's six previous offerings
have largely come and gone unnoticed by all
but loyal Muses fans, a newfound focus on
Hersh and the Muses' distinctive music sur
rounds their latest effort, "University."
Hersh's successful solo acoustic project
might have something to do with why every
body is giving a damn this time around; her
well-regarded and well-received "Hips and
Makers" album sold more copies than any
thing she has been associated to in the past.
Or, if you believe the experts like Spin and
College Music Journal, maybe there's more
interest in "University" because it's a catchi
er take on the Muses' sonic mess that's ward
ed away a popular following.
From Hersh's perspective, the band "has
tricked a lot of people" into describing "Uni
versity," the band's first LP since the raucous
1992 recording "Red Heaven," as a "pop
album." Although she acknowledges that the

record is "very produced
and that its first four cut

are "as much as the Muses are capa
ble of being 'pop' or 'rock,' " she
points out that the new one isn't the
tidy package many critics seem to
think it is.
"I think it had a lot of strange
pieces on it that [the critics] forget
about because of the sequencing,
Hersh says."It slides off to kind of
weirdness, in my head, but they
don't seem to have noticed, so
maybe I shouldn't even be telling
you that. . . . I'm just waiting for
them to realize it's not as accessible
as they think it is. Maybe they're just
paying attention for the first time."

But those songs which had to be
done, which have haunted Hersh in
the form of visions since her adoles
cence, gave her no choice but to con
tinue making Throwing Muses
music. As she describes it, the songs
"didn't give a shit" that she was no
longer in a band, that she was about
to get married and was pregnant with
her second child. "They just kept
coming," tells Hersh, who has been
diagnosed with a bipolar condition
which causes hallucinations and
seizures.
"My songwriting process is a
strange one. 1 don't do it on purpose.
I never did. It just happened to me
one day when I was 13. I thought I
was hallucinating. I guess 1 was hallu
cinating.
"To me, songs are real guys. They
have heat, electricity and energy and
images. And 1 can't fight them off. 1
have to turn them into songs or else
they get stuck in my house or my
body and they do become hallucina
tions. So I could easily be a little bit
ter about it and say it was a curse. But
some of these guys are really neces
sary and, therefore, beautiful. As long
as I don't censor them, they say great
things, I think.
In a sense, penning an "awful pop
song" would constitute a betrayal of
Hersh's muse, would be a straying
away from her "real job" of "listen
ing." When a song comes on, Hersh,
hears it just as it will sound on the
record.
But because listening is such an ac
tive process, it requires Hersh to re
spond to the song before it begins to
manifest itself in images that jump
out of the wall, even if it means
climbing out of bed in the middle of
the night, putting her boots and
nightgown on and trudging over to
the studio.
"Serve the song," Hersh says with a
laugh, as if it were her motto.
"(Making songs] is not weirder than
having babies, if you ask me. I've
made 20 fingernails in my lifetime
and I don't know how to begin to
make a fingernail. That's magic.
That's crazy."
There's a natural calm in the
way Hersh describes the most
harrowing experiences, a
serenity that belies the impression
that she's a mad genius, the song
writer from another planet. Yet with-

out knowing any better, it's easy to read too
much into images of bright yellow guns and
pony tails, of water and sleep which run
through a number of Muse songs.
And that's maybe from where many ot the
misconceptions about Hersh and the group
come. With all the scattered symbolism
laden in the lyrics, it's easy to assume there's
a lot of intellectualizing going on under
neath the surface: about the tare on the
Muses'second album, 1988's "House Torna
do," Village Voice critic Robert Christgau
wrote that it was "bad poetry," which became
"obscure poetry" with 1989's "Hunkpapa."
Hersh is the first to admit that the Muses

don't make brainy music. As she told the
CM J New Music Monthly, "There's not a
whole lot of intellect in there." Rather,
Hersh's voice, words and music make a
unique visceral impact, conveying emotion
and spirit concretely. In that sense, Hersh
more than translates; she creates, turning
those real guys that have heat, electricity and
energy she hears into songs.
Nowhere does that natural vibrance
shine so brightly as on Hersh's re
cent solo acoustic efforts. On
"Hips and Makers," originally conceived for
herself and husband Billy O'Connell (who's
also the band's manager), Hersh overcame
her shyness and ventured on her own, with
nothing but her guitar, a few string arrange
ments and Michael Stipe singing backup on
a cut.
The result was one of 1994's most beauti
ful recordings, where the lush simplicity of
Hersh's voice and strummed strings defied
the cliche of "unplugged" with its rich tex
tures and carved a niche for Hersh in the
genre like the Muses have in rock.
"It was a new experience for me and
probably a good time in my career to have a
new experience," she says."I needed to be
thrust into something I didn't understand.
From the recording process on, I had never
really had to record an acoustic sound pic
ture. You know, build on sounds in a room.
Find a perfect room, the perfect old mikes,
play it reverb so that we weren't lying about
anything.
"All of a sudden, I was in big classical
halls, with everyone sitting in chairs and I

was sitting in a chair. It was so quiet and no
one was drunk hut me. And I had to make
that a musical experience.
"I did it knowing exactly what was going
to happen when I sat that piece of wood on
my lap, which is what always happens,
whether it was in my kitchen or in my bed
room. It's just that I had invited all those
people there too."
Although Hersh points out that the
acoustic songs could never be recorded by
the band, the projects really aren't as differ
ent as they seem on the surface: without
reading too much into what Hersh says,
both modes provide her an outlet to express
something honest and clear.
As much as listening and making music,
Hersh's job is to draw the line between
telling the truth and lying through her art,
because finding the right microphone and
the right room matters, because serving the
song faithfully is essential.
So even if "University" follows the other
Throwing Muses' albums into obscurity,
Kristin Hersh has found a comfort in what
she has created that has nothing to do with
popularity.
"From 'Red Heaven' on, I feel very suc
cessful, because it's all clean," she explains.
"There's nothing weighty about it, nothing
yucky, no bad feelings. Just a lot of hard
work and good music at the end and we've
been able to survive.
"We've been pretty hungry, but the band
has been able to afford to keep going and
that's the important thing. I'd rather be a
lousy waitress with a great band than a bad
rock star." ■

Kristin Hersh doesn't consider her
self a creative person. It's a startling
self-assessment, one that would
seem to contradict her role as "musician," as
an artist with the imaginative capacity to
project images and emotion through sound.
Without knowing any better, the stark re
mark might ring with hollow humility, espe
cially when put into the context of how
Hersh and her band Throwing Muses have
twisted and turned off well-trodden musical
paths for the past decade and a half.
But there's every reason to buy into what
Hersh is saying because she isn't selling a
thing: her cragglv speaking voice intimates
someone earnest behind it and radiates with
a sense of peace which reinforces every word
she utters.
The pristine 28-year-old will carefully re
late to you that she's the "stupidest one in
volved" in the music-making chain and tell
you that her job, in essence, is that of listen
ing and translating. As she puts it, "It's like
somebody's tricking me into writing the
songs they want to hear."
Ironically, that honesty which makes
Hersh such a captivating individual has
made her craft so befuddling to critics
and so evasive to a large audience since the
group began to be noticed in the mid 80s.
From the mystic images which has filled the
band's songs to the chilling howls that 1 lersh
has been wailing from her teens on, Throw
ing Muses and their leader have often been
perceived as weird and nutsy to say the least,
an oddball novelty that seemed best ap
proached with a love-'em-or
leave-'em-alone attitude.

Never part of the mainstream, it was
probably easier to marginalize their neo
folkie, hick-punk art crap than to escape it.
"When (we) released the [first] record,
the world at-large happens to [us]," Hersh
recalls. "And we had to hear that we were
from another planet, that we were so strange,
that I was so crazy, that I screamed and they
never heard screaming before and why was 1
always trying to be so weird. And I thought it
was just beautiful stuff that we were sharing.
I thought it was a party the whole time.
"That was kind of a slap in the face, be
cause in order to please the world, you have
to be hazed. It's unfortunate that thev told
such young people that."
While the band's six previous offerings
have largely come and gone unnoticed by all
but loyal Muses fans, a newfound focus on
Hersh and the Muses' distinctive music sur
rounds their latest effort, "University."
Hersh's successful solo acoustic project
might have something to do with why every
body is giving a damn this time around; her
well-regarded and well-received "Hips and
Makers" album sold more copies than any
thing she has been associated to in the past.
Or, if you believe the experts like Spin and
College Music Journal, maybe there's more
interest in "University" because it's a catchi
er take on the Muses' sonic mess that's ward
ed away a popular following.
From Hersh's perspective, the band "has
tricked a lot of people" into describing "Uni
versity," the band's first LP since the raucous
1992 recording "Red Heaven," as a "pop
album." Although she acknowledges that the

record is "very produced
and that its first four cut

are "as much as the Muses are capa
ble of being 'pop' or 'rock,' " she
points out that the new one isn't the
tidy package many critics seem to
think it is.
"I think it had a lot of strange
pieces on it that [the critics] forget
about because of the sequencing,
Hersh says."It slides off to kind of
weirdness, in my head, but they
don't seem to have noticed, so
maybe I shouldn't even be telling
you that. . . . I'm just waiting for
them to realize it's not as accessible
as they think it is. Maybe they're just
paying attention for the first time."
Clearly, "University" is cut of the
same material as its predecesors,
brimming with a visuality that's
etched by the images in Hersh's
lyrics and by the kinetic music. The
album isn't really an improvement
on or a progression of the Muses'
skill, but more like a new book with
an old story told in a slightly differ
ent way.
Yet "University" does stand out
with a fuller sound than any of its
predecessors, the result of having
"enough time to be self-indulgent,"
Hersh claims. The four "poppier"
cuts which open the 14-tune LP
make an instant impression: "Bright
Yellow Gun" and "Shimmer" leap
out with a boldness that comple
ments the shiny streaks that are the
band's trademark well, bouncing
with an edgy energy.
On the two songs, Hersh's guitar
still lashes and twinkles, but with a

greater presence than before.
The rhythm section keeps a re
silient beat, between longtime
Muse Dave Narcizo's charac
teristically crisp drumming
and new bassist Bernard
Georges' insistent grooves.
On "Hazing," "Universi-
third track, the trio
builds up a wall o' noise,
then crashes it down. It's
also the most free that Hersh's
stunning voice gets on the
album, moving from curt jabs
to no-sweat crooning to re
soundingly drawn-out notes
with thrilling ease.
The record's more difficult
moments are also more acces
sible via the souped-up pro
duction. The mayhem of "No
Way in Hell" engrosses fully,
with its coiling bursts of dis-

torted guitar accompanied by a syn
copated rhythm and Hersh's droning
vocals. The lucid twang of "Surf
Cowboy" follows on the heels of
"No Way in Hell," where the instru
ments lay down a lazy mood that's
a nice breather in the midst of all
the intensity.
Even "University"'s very

strangest piece, the title track
where the muted cries of Hersh's two chil
dren (eight-year-old Dylan and three-year
old Ryder) are backed by mother's soothing
guitar arrangement, proves eerily inviting.

Quirks and all, the album might prove to
be the Muses' well-deserved breakthrough,
as the Sire / Reprise band bio and the bevy of
ads in national music magazines seem to
hint. But stardom and buzz are two things in
which Hersh has little interest: after a record
has been made and released, all she expects
from her record company is the opportunity
to tour it.
"Luckily, we're not really attached to the
music biz thing," she explains. "We're not
looking to sell records. Otherwise, we'd be a
different kind of band. It's not hard to figure
out what gets played on the radio and who

becomes a famous star, you know. It's not
that hard. We always had kinda better things
to do. Not to be obnoxious about it, but there
were other songs we had to do first."
Around the time Throwing Muses
made "The Real Ramona," which
was released in 1991, Hersh decided
to put the group to bed. The time seemed
right: second stringer Tanya Donelly wanted
to forge ahead with her own projects and
Hersh herself "couldn't really remember why
[she] was in a band in the first place." To her,
the band was becoming formulaic, "trendy
and soulless, just like everybody else."

But those songs which had to be
done, which have haunted Hersh in
the form of visions since her adoles
cence, gave her no choice but to con
tinue making Throwing Muses
music. As she describes it, the songs
"didn't give a shit" that she was no
longer in a band, that she was about
to get married and was pregnant with
her second child. "They just kept

which causes hallucinations and
seizures.
