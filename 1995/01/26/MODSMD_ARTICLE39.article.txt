"The Madness of King George"

The King is not mad, he's just nervous.
The year is 1788, almost 30years into King George Ill's
reign, and the British Kmpirc has just been kicked out of
the American colonies. Rolling hills, a vast land stretch
ing from sea to shining sea, it's a veritable paradise — lost.
"The Madness of King George," is set primarily with
in the claustrophobic walls of Windsor Castle. From the
processes of preening to procession, this Nicholas Hytner
film elaborately captures the daily rituals that order every
moment of monarchical life. Appearances, after all, are

everything... until the King (Nigel Hawthorne) decides
to go on strike.
Hawthorne and Helen Mirren turn in regal perfor
mances as "Mr. and Mrs. King." It'sthe Queen that suffers
most as a result of her husband's deterioration. At the first
signs of the King's mental instability (relentless babbling,
occasional spewing of invective and an aggressive censor
ship of all reports relating to America) are ignored.
But eyebrows arch when he suddenly interrupts a
royal concert, taking over the keyboard with a demon
stration of his own. Stakes are raised when he runs out ot
the castle at 4 o'clock one morning, frolicking in the fields
with only his nightshirt on.
When the King shows actual, physiological signs of ill
ness, there is almost a collective sigh of relief. It's not mad
ness for the sake of madness after all.
Meanwhile, the court's ravens circle in the distance,
carefully eyeing their carrion. The Prince of Wales (Ru
pert Everett), the King's la/y but decadent son confines
his father, denies his mother the Queen access, leaving the
King to the medieval treatments of court-appointed doc
tors. Then, with the backing of several Parliament mem
bers, the Prince approaches the House of CCommons to be
appointed Regent.
What little the movie lacks in historical texture, it
more than makes up for in compelling drama. All ends
on an uplifting note, and power is eventually restored to
the King. But long after the curtains go down, we're left
with the eerie feeling that this could happen to any one of
us. Madness. Or, according to the King, the uncomfort
able predicament of forgetting "how to seem."
