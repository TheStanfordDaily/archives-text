# Russell accused of 'deceiving' ASSU Pub Board
## 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
The ASSU Appropriations Committee
spent almost four hours last night debating
whether undergraduate senator Stephen
Russell had deceived the ASSU Publica
tions Board into allocating money to the re
cently released publication, Ask Stanford.
In its first-ever issue distributed yester
day, Ask Stanford contained a number of
articles slamming the Balanced Funding
Deal, a proposed amendment to change
the special-fee system, currently being
voted on by students.
Though committee members eventual
ly decided to recommend continued fund
ing to the newsletter's publisher, Associat

ed Student Consulting — which works
jointly with the newly formed Student's
Alliance party to put out the publication —
they stressed in a statement that "Ask
Stanford has deceived the student body,
resulting in the use of student money to
fund a partisan political agenda."
The controversy stemmed around
whether ASC — a voluntary student orga
nization of which Russell is president —
had misrepresented itself to the Pub
Board Finance Committee in October by
portraying itself as politically neutral.
At the time, ASC requested funding for
a newsletter which, according to a letter
from ASC member Patricia Lewis to the
Pub Board, would "feature in depth analy
sis of campus news and events, guide stu

dents through the quagmire of University
politics and forms, as well as inform con
cerned students how to get involved
through the ASSU."
Appropriations Committee members
contend that this statement gave no indica
tion that the newsletter would be so parti
san or even afTiliated with a political party.
"The biggest problem was whether
they deceived the ASSU Senate to get the
money.... They did a very good job of hid
ing their true intentions," said graduate
senator Marc Oppenheimer, a member of
the Appropriations Committee. "The
biggest problem to me and the rest of the
committee is that they have gone ahead
and forced students to pay to put
out this publication."
But the committee could not
find any way that ASC had violated
the letter of the Policies of the Pub
Board, Oppenheimer said.
The policies state that "any stu
dent whose primary purpose is to
publish a periodical shall be known
as a publisher."
Ask Stanford's primary purpose
is "not to publish a periodical —
it's to be fa vehicle for] the Stu
dent's Alliance party," Oppen
heimer said.
Another section of the policies,
however, says that a student publi
cation may receive Pub Board
funds if it is not receiving funds
from another board or from special
fees, a criterion which Ask Stan
ford meets.
In the end, the Appropriations
Committee was "forced to recom
mend funding," according to their
statement. "However, we are con
vinced that the spirit of the law has
been broken."
Russell said he saw no reason
for the controversy except for polit
ical opposition to the content of the
newsletter. "One man's informa
tion is another man's partisan
ship," he said.
"Tonight the Appropriations
Committee spent over three hours
trying to find a violation of Ask
Stanford.... They were unable to

find some mud to throw at the new
publication and have simply chosen
to write a malicious letter," he said.
"Ask Stanford is everything it is
reported to be — a journal of news
and opinions and about the ASSU."
Pub Board director Danny
Bressler also said he felt the com
mittee — which is made up of sev
eral members of the People's Plat
form party and proponents of the
special-fee bill decried by Ask Stan
ford — had taken a political
approach toward the meeting.
"The Appropriations Commit
tee did not approve of the fact that
this publication was against the
Balanced Funding Deal," he said.
Bressler added that he did not
really know whether ASC had mis
represented itself to the Pub Board
Finance Committee, which origi
nally approved its fall quarter
funding request of $800.
"They didn't specifically say
what they were going to do.. . with
a lot of new publications you have
to wait and see how they develop. I
had no idea what form it would
take," he said.
Calling the matter "an extreme
example of abuse of power by
Stephen Russell," Council of Pres
idents member Mork Murdock
said the senate will call for an
investigation of ASC's dealings.
Senate Chair Nawwar Kasrawi
also noted he will ask ASSU Finan
cial Manager Gabe Lucas to freeze
ASC's funds until the investigation
is over.
The recommendation will go
before the senate on Tuesday.
