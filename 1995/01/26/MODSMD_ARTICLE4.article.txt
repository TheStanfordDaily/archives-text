# Russell accused of 'deceiving' ASSU Pub Board

### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
The ASSU Appropriations Committee
spent almost four hours last night debating
whether undergraduate senator Stephen
Russell had deceived the ASSU Publica
tions Board into allocating money to the re
cently released publication, Ask Stanford.
In its first-ever issue distributed yester
day, Ask Stanford contained a number of
articles slamming the Balanced Funding
Deal, a proposed amendment to change
the special-fee system, currently being
voted on by students.

jointly with the newly formed Student's
Alliance party to put out the publication —
they stressed in a statement that "Ask
Stanford has deceived the student body,
resulting in the use of student money to
fund a partisan political agenda."
The controversy stemmed around
whether ASC — a voluntary student orga

had misrepresented itself to the Pub
Board Finance Committee in October by
portraying itself as politically neutral.
At the time, ASC requested funding for
a newsletter which, according to a letter
from ASC member Patricia Lewis to the
Pub Board, would "feature in depth analy
sis of campus news and events, guide stu

dents through the quagmire of University
politics and forms, as well as inform con

through the ASSU."
Appropriations Committee members
contend that this statement gave no indica

san or even afTiliated with a political party.
"The biggest problem was whether
they deceived the ASSU Senate to get the
money.... They did a very good job of hid
ing their true intentions," said graduate
senator Marc Oppenheimer, a member of
the Appropriations Committee. "The
biggest problem to me and the rest of the
committee is that they have gone ahead
