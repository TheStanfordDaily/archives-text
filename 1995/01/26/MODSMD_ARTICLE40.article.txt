# Emotional 'Legends of the Fall' astonishes
## 
### 
Based on Jim Harrison's novella, "Legends of the Fall"
is a tale of three brothers split apart by — yes, you guessed
it — a woman.

"Legends of the Fall"

The brothers are Alfred (Aidan Quinn), Tristan (Brad
Pitt) and Samuel (Henry Thomas). Despite their differ
ent natures and their different looks, the brothers form a
close-knit family, headed by the indominable and brash
Colonel Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins). Family ties begin
to crumble, however, when Samuel brings home his new
fiancee Susannah (Julia Ormond).
Montana in 1910 is a lonely place, and all three broth
ers find themselves completely in love with Susannah. To
make matters worse, Susannah can't keep straight whom
she's supposed to love. She moves from brother to broth
er, ultimately becoming obsessed with Tristan, the rebel
with a devil-mav-care charm.

The superb cinematography and acting definitely
keeps the film afloat, preventing us all from drowning in
the sea of pathos. Brad Pitt is unbelievably brilliant. Not
only does he look smashing with his tousled blond locks
and muscled body (hard earned from shoveling hay and
cow manure all day on the family farm), but he can ride
a horse and act too. No crocodile tears for Pitt, either.
His red-rimmed eyes and passionate delivery give Tris
tan sensitivity and humanity amid the madness.
Quinn is quite successfully despicable as Alfred. We're
not supposed to like Alfred much, and Quinn's portrayal
of the prudish, unforgiving eldest brother is dead-center.
Ormond, the beauty at the center of all the havoc, is
certainly that — a beauty. However, she is given very lit
tle chance to act. The filmmakers turned her into a wa
terspout — she cries in almost every scene — making her
character rather flat. Generally, Susannah's role is a cata
lyst, the impetus for the actions of the other characters.
Don't see this film if you don't want to be depressed.
Do see it if you want a glimpse of Pitt's tush.
