# Susan Sarandon can't save a doomed 'Safe Passage'
## 
### 
In what has become her signa
ture character, Susan Sarandon
again plays a strong-willed woman
strueeline with her self and her sur-

screens

roundings in
"Safe Passage."
This time, she
is the mother
of seven boys
and must deal
with the ago
nizing wait fol
lowing an acci
dent at a Ma
rine base, not
knowing what
has happened

to her son.
The movie basically belongs to
Sarandon. She has a lot of support
from a large cast, including Sam
Shepard, Robert Sean Leonard and

"Safe Passage"

Sean Astin. The main focus of the
movie is Mag Singer (Sarandon) as
she comes to terms with her life and
actions as a mother.
This plot provides Sarandon
with a broad range of emotions to
work with, so much so that she
doesn't really have the chance to

concentrate on one aspect of the
character's personality. She shows
that she can play the emotions well,
but never truly has the opportunity
to tic them all together.
The movie grasps for the com
passion and concern of the audi
ence, but its predictability doesn't
allow it to do so. Every situation
seems thoroughly fabricated and
unrealistic. The underlying sub
plots of Mag's civil service exam,
her husband's instantaneous blind
ness and the relationships between
the twins are given almost too much
time, as they diminish the effects of

The Last Klezmer"

Seventy-year-old Leopold Koslowski lost
his mother, father and brother when the Nazis
invaded Poland during World War 11. What he
didn't lose was his love of music — inherited
from his family and the Jewish traditions of
Eastern Europe.
In Yale Strom's magnificent documentary,
"The Last Klezmer," music is the most potent
language with which Koslowski speaks. The
story ol one Holocaust survivor becomes the
storv of cultural survival.

"Nobody's Fool"

Blue eyes, old Blue Eyes, he who made my
ninth-grade biology teacher sigh with pleasure:
Paul Newman. Old Blue Eyes in North Bath, a
small town in upstate New York, living the life
of a middle aged (well, that's kind of pushing it,
... let's say older-middle-aged) working-class
everyman.

the main plot: the agonizing wait
for information on the missing
son.
The one and only meaningful
scene that comes to mind involves
Sarandon grabbing a trained at
tack dog and almost killing it with
her bare hands in order to save her
son from being bitten. It is at this
moment that Mag realizes the in
tensity of her commitment to her
sons, and how their lives have be
come her life.
The distracting and only slight
ly pertinent use of flashbacks could
have been used to further flesh out
the characters, but instead was

"As long as I am alive, so is the Jewish cul
ture' declares Koslowski at one point in the
documentary of his life. Klezmer is Jewish folk
music, up-tempo melodies traditionally
played at Bat Milvahs, weddings and other fes
tivals, and Koslowski is its living embodiment.
Although the title is somewhat deceptive,
given that a number of young performers —
including Strom himself— are looking both
backwards and forwards into Klezmer, its
meaning becomes clear in Kozlowski's own
words:
"There isn't a professor in the world that
can teach you to become a klezmer. A klezmer
has to be born. It had to come from the moth
er, in the stomach where she fed him the feel
ing of Klezmer."

"Nobody's Fool," stars, features, promotes,
centers and focuses on Paul Newman. The
movie doesn't really have a plot, nor does it pre
tend to; it just follows the life of Paul Newman
(Sully) as he runs into various different situa
tions in his small town.
Not to say that "Nobody's Fool" is boring.
The film features convincing, funny and some
times touching performances from Jessica
Tandy in her last role ever (as Mrs. Beryl, Sully's

landlord), Bruce Willi:
(as Sully's boss, Carl
and Melanie Griffith
(as Toby, Girl's wife).
"Nobody's Fool" i'
also replete with one
liners and comic en
counters: Sully's one
legged lawyer (Gent
Saks) who can't win <
case; the idiotic towr
police officer, Rufu«
(Joe Paparone), whosi
idea of a major offense,
is a broken tail light
the complete transfor
mation of a vicious
Doberman Pinschei
to a whimpering pet:

simply wasted. While the flash
backs did provide a few very neces
sary humorous breaks from the
subject matter, including one
scene where Sarandon smokes
marijuana with her son, they were
not utilized to their greatest poten
tial.
The movie ends predictably,
in typical Hollywood form and
neglects to demonstrate much
growth or change in the charac
ters. The audience never really
cares about this family, and there
was little doubt as to the outcome
of the search was going. Al
though slightly redeemed by
Sarandon's performance, "Safe
Passage," is one film that can be
passed up on.
— Benjamin Bartos

The statement seems odd coming from a
man who teaches Klezmer to both Jewish and
non-Jewish students and for years directed the
Polish Army Symphony Orchestra.
Strom's documentary, equally about the
triumph of culture and individual, focuses
mainly on a trip Kozlowski takes back to his
Ukrainian hometown of Przemyslany and to
the camps where the Nazis once forced him to
play Klezmer for their own enjoyment.
Kozlowski's memories can't help but affect,
and as a director Strom manages to mingle
words, haunting music and pictures in a way
that mourns the past while celebrating it, cre
ating a remarkable documentary that comes
from the heart.
— Lituin Friedlieb

the continuous stealing and restealing of a
snowblower; and Sully's obnoxious grandson,
appropriately named "Wacker."
The absence of plot in "Nobody's Fool," al
most turns the movie into a character study.
Each character has a fully developed history
and personality as each is complete with their
own unique set of neuroses, ideas about how
life should be conducted and serious problems.
Sully's son Peter (1 )ylan Walsh) feels that his

father never cared about him, Mrs. Beryl has a
stroke and a grown son who wants to put her in
a nursing home — the list continues indefi
nitely. Unfortunately, none of the character's
problems are important enough that they can't
be solved by I lollvwood in an hour and a half.
"Nobody's Fool" 's major failing is its pre
dictability. The movie is as insipid .is a sitcom.
However, the viewer's instinctual knowledge

of what is going to happen
(conditioned, perhaps, by a
million similar movies)
makes "Nobody's Fool" in
credibly easy to watch — it's
a pleasant film for those
having brain dead days and
for die-hard Paul Newman
fans.
— Elisabeth Morse

"Bad Company"

"Bad Company" is a bad movie that osten
sibly tries to furnish us with a semi-apocalyp
tic picture of a post-cold war world in which
private industry dominates and motivates in
dividuals to use corruption to promote self
interest.
This summation undoubtedly gives more
credit to this Damian Harris creation than is
warranted. Unfortunately, 1 larris never man
ages to come anywhere close to that effort.
"Had Company," co-starring Laurence Fish
burne and Ellen Barkin, unravels so uncon
vincingly that this near-apocalyptic vision is
entirely diluted.
The closing scene captures a woman in a
red Escada suit climbing into a limo on her
way to some distant exotic hideaway where
she can live sumptuously off bribe money.
The opening scene of "Bad Company" re
veals that the protagonist Nelson Crowe,
(Fishburne), has no qualms about using the
skills he acquired as a special agent in the CIA
to protect Fortune 500 companies from accu
sations of illegal practices.
So there we have it... a beginning consis
tent with its end — everyone is corrupt.
Under the influence of money, from the
macro level of the private business to the
micro level of the individual who could use a
couple thousand or so, people act without
principle.
One exception in "Bad Company" may be
when the judge, despite the fact that he has
been blackmailed, upholds a court decision
that punishes an important client of the
Crimes espionage organization with a $25
million suit for unsound environmental
practice. But he later kills himself— i.e. a
principled man is as good as dead — and his
successor, the woman in the red Escada suit,
perpetuates the cycle of corruption despite
his attempt at being morally upright.
Thus, the development between the open
ing and closing scenes, for the most part, be
comes irrelevant. Director Harris seems to
make a point of playing down details in order
to focus on corruptive tendencies of
mankind. The movie contains neither the ex
pected political undertones nor docs it pro
vide any commentary on interracial affairs in
its portrayal of Crowe and his partner Mar
garet (Barkin).
Rather than creating characters with lay
ers, Harris gives us two-dimensional people
and a plot whose intrigue never gets a foot in
the door.

ture' declares Koslowski at one point in the
documentary of his life. Klezmer is Jewish folk
music, up-tempo melodies traditionally
played at Bat Milvahs, weddings and other fes
tivals, and Koslowski is its living embodiment.
Although the title is somewhat deceptive,
given that a number of young performers —
including Strom himself— are looking both
backwards and forwards into Klezmer, its
meaning becomes clear in Kozlowski's own
words:
"There isn't a professor in the world that
can teach you to become a klezmer. A klezmer
has to be born. It had to come from the moth
er, in the stomach where she fed him the feel

"Bad Company"

"Bad Company" is a bad movie that osten
sibly tries to furnish us with a semi-apocalyp
tic picture of a post-cold war world in which
private industry dominates and motivates in
dividuals to use corruption to promote self
interest.
This summation undoubtedly gives more
credit to this Damian Harris creation than is
warranted. Unfortunately, 1 larris never man
ages to come anywhere close to that effort.
"Had Company," co-starring Laurence Fish
burne and Ellen Barkin, unravels so uncon
vincingly that this near-apocalyptic vision is
entirely diluted.
The closing scene captures a woman in a
red Escada suit climbing into a limo on her
way to some distant exotic hideaway where
she can live sumptuously off bribe money.
The opening scene of "Bad Company" re
veals that the protagonist Nelson Crowe,
(Fishburne), has no qualms about using the
skills he acquired as a special agent in the CIA
to protect Fortune 500 companies from accu
sations of illegal practices.
So there we have it... a beginning consis
tent with its end — everyone is corrupt.
Under the influence of money, from the
macro level of the private business to the
micro level of the individual who could use a
couple thousand or so, people act without
principle.
One exception in "Bad Company" may be
when the judge, despite the fact that he has
been blackmailed, upholds a court decision
that punishes an important client of the
Crimes espionage organization with a $25
million suit for unsound environmental
practice. But he later kills himself— i.e. a
principled man is as good as dead — and his
successor, the woman in the red Escada suit,
perpetuates the cycle of corruption despite
his attempt at being morally upright.
Thus, the development between the open
ing and closing scenes, for the most part, be
comes irrelevant. Director Harris seems to
make a point of playing down details in order
to focus on corruptive tendencies of
mankind. The movie contains neither the ex
pected political undertones nor docs it pro
vide any commentary on interracial affairs in
its portrayal of Crowe and his partner Mar
garet (Barkin).
Rather than creating characters with lay
ers, Harris gives us two-dimensional people
and a plot whose intrigue never gets a foot in
the door.

In what has become her signa
ture character, Susan Sarandon
again plays a strong-willed woman
strueeline with her self and her sur-

screens

roundings in
"Safe Passage."
This time, she
is the mother
of seven boys
and must deal
with the ago
nizing wait fol
lowing an acci
dent at a Ma
rine base, not
knowing what
has happened

to her son.
The movie basically belongs to
Sarandon. She has a lot of support
from a large cast, including Sam
Shepard, Robert Sean Leonard and

"Safe Passage"

Sean Astin. The main focus of the
movie is Mag Singer (Sarandon) as
she comes to terms with her life and
actions as a mother.
This plot provides Sarandon
with a broad range of emotions to
work with, so much so that she
doesn't really have the chance to

concentrate on one aspect of the
character's personality. She shows
that she can play the emotions well,
but never truly has the opportunity
to tic them all together.
The movie grasps for the com
passion and concern of the audi
ence, but its predictability doesn't
allow it to do so. Every situation
seems thoroughly fabricated and
unrealistic. The underlying sub
plots of Mag's civil service exam,
her husband's instantaneous blind
ness and the relationships between
the twins are given almost too much
time, as they diminish the effects of

The Last Klezmer"

Seventy-year-old Leopold Koslowski lost
his mother, father and brother when the Nazis
invaded Poland during World War 11. What he
didn't lose was his love of music — inherited
from his family and the Jewish traditions of
Eastern Europe.
In Yale Strom's magnificent documentary,
"The Last Klezmer," music is the most potent
language with which Koslowski speaks. The
story ol one Holocaust survivor becomes the
storv of cultural survival.

Blue eyes, old Blue Eyes, he who made my
ninth-grade biology teacher sigh with pleasure:
Paul Newman. Old Blue Eyes in North Bath, a
small town in upstate New York, living the life
of a middle aged (well, that's kind of pushing it,
... let's say older-middle-aged) working-class
everyman.

the main plot: the agonizing wait
for information on the missing
son.
The one and only meaningful
scene that comes to mind involves
Sarandon grabbing a trained at
tack dog and almost killing it with
her bare hands in order to save her
son from being bitten. It is at this
moment that Mag realizes the in
tensity of her commitment to her
sons, and how their lives have be
come her life.
