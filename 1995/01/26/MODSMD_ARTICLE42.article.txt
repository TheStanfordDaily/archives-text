## With 'Death and the Maiden' Roman Polanski returns early form 
### 
Nothing attempted by Roman
Polanski in recent memory —
"Frantic," "Bitter Moon" —
quite prepares one for the sheer
suspense-ridden mastery of his
latest film "Death and the Maid
en." Artfully tempered with the
psychology of human conflict

"Death and the Maiden"

and provocative questions about
the delivery of justice, the adap
tation of Chilean Ariel Dorf
man's heralded play breathes life
into the buried ghosts of a dia
bolical political order.
Paulina Escobar (Sigourney
Weaver) is too well-acquainted
with the brutal workings of a
South American dictatorship.
Kidnapped from a busy street in
1977, Paulina was then held
without trial for two months,
during which she was blind
folded, repeatedly tortured and
raped. The name she withheld
from her interrogators was that
of her lover, Gerardo Escobar
(Stuart Wilson), a then-student
activist whom Paulina was to
marry following her release.
The film itself actually begins
one stormy night fifteen years
later, when stranded with a flat
tire, Gerardo is driven home by
a good Samaritan (Ben Kings
ley) whom Gerardo invites for a
drink in the house. Before long,
the still-edgy Paulina becomes
increasingly convinced that this
mild-mannered Dr. Miranda is

none other than the prison doc
tor who had assaulted her four
teen times during her nightmar
ish ordeal.
As the ex-victim now posi
tioned to turn the tables on the
man she believes to be her as
sailant, Weaver fashions chilling
details — the sudden twist of a
chicken leg, her flicking away of
a cigarette — that speak a multi
tude of wordless pathos. Under
mining Paulina's gut-driven,
bitter neuroticism with a re
markable capacity for reason
and persuasion, the Oscar-nom
inated actress conveys a complex
blend of emotional nuances in a
career-topping performance.
The compelling structure of
Dorfman's play places Gerardo
squarely between Paulina's per
sonal agenda and Dr. Miranda's
pleas of innocence. Playing the
reluctant devil's advocate, Wil
son is sympathetic as the loyal
ty-torn Gerardo, who vainly at
tempts to negotiate with his
wife for a rational course in ex
acting truth, a notion in danger
of being subordinated to justice.
Confined largely to the inte
riors of the Escobars' home and
spanning a time period of no
more than nine hours over one
night, "Death and the Maiden"
is made to rely purely on the
strength of its three actors, the
quality of Dorfman's script and
Polanski's once-undisputed
penchant for relentless cine
matic tension. Thanks to Polan
ski's timely recovery of form,
"Repulsion" and "Chinatown"
have finally found a worthy suc
cessor.
