# Ropin' the cash
## Brooks' quality 'Hits' album a money-making scheme 
### 
With a collection called "The Hits," Garth Brooks
clearly has set himself up for a win-win situation. How
ever, while the songs are well-chosen and representative
of his versatility as an artist, the one element this album
lacks is guts.
In his latest release, Brooks has compiled what he
feels are the best songs (and smash singles) from five of

'The Hits"
Garth Brooks

his albums, including "In Pieces," "The Chase," "Rop in
The Wind," "No Fences" and "Garth Brooks." But by
sticking with his confirmed hits and failing to attempt
any new cuts, Brooks has opted for a risk-free path to
profit. Consequently, the pleasure that results for the
listener is like that of a long marriage with a partner you
can always count on (but know too well) rather than
the spicy excitement of a new romance.
A budding fan of Garth Brooks, or even a generic en-
thusiast of the more contemporary country-western
8 rock music, would undoubtedly find this album pleas-
ing. It is high-quality, palatable country that fits into
| any scene, whether it's a barn or a penthouse apart
t ment, and the mostly danceable selection appeals to
g the yuppie-cowboys who frequent the country-danc
| ing bars.

However, unless the goal is a complete collection of
his work, the diehard devotee has no need for this CD
because odds are good that he or she already owns
Brooks' other albums from which these songs are
taken. Furthermore, many of these tried-and-true (em
phasis here is on "tried") songs are already weary from
years of riding the radio waves. Instead of embarking
on this effortless moneymaking scheme, Brooks could
have offered us more by at least remixing or offering
different versions of the originals.
The worn-out feel of this album is convincing ev
idence that Brooks and all his "Friends in Low
Places" are no longer "Much Too Young (To Feel This
Damn Old)." If Brooks is not writing and recording
new material, it would seem that he should stop
wondering "What She's Doin Now and pay more
attention to what he's doin' now (can you say, "wast
ing his talent" ?).
For all his fans know, he could be riding the "Rodeo,"
learning "The Dance," working at the "American
Honky-Tonk Bar Association," or simply "Callin' Baton
Rouge." Until his creative inspiration returns, Brooks
zealots will have to suffer with their "Unanswered
Prayers" for new releases.
However, the suggestion is not that this gifted artist
is "Standing Outside the Fire." After all, "The River" of
his success continues to flow, and still "The Thunder
Rolls." So, "If Tomorrow Never Comes," Brooks can die
happy — despite its shortcomings, diis album "Ain't
Coin' Down (Til The Sun Comes Up)."
