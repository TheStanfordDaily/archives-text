### 
ball team and the NBA athletes it attracted, is
Jar and away this album s best track. Bump
ing out bass lines that compete with the
funkiest of hip-hoppers, Franti infuses the
chorus with a reggae-style chatting that helps
pick up the album's pace. Dub artists croon
"Red Black Green, Red Gold Green / Dat's
how we know we a fe we dream team" while
Franti hooks up the rhymes.
"Brotha's on the street / And everyone is
scared a ya / So how could ten Africans rep
resent America? Bullshit / It didn't mean a
thing / 'Cause in the same year / we saw Rod
ney King."
Franti's laid-back story-telling is set to
rhymes so deceptively simple that he manages
to sneak much science into his music without
ever sounding preachy. On the other hand,

his already diverse
musical sensibilities
are still evolving,
which often lends a
raw or unfinished
quality to his music.
"Spearhead"
doesn't jump and
grab you the first
time around. It's an
ease-back-and-listen
more than a shake
your-thing invest
ment. Definitely. So
ease back, because
this cat's got a mes
sage that's meant to
be heard.
