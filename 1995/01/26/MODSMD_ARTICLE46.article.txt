# Pat Metheny paints a rhythmic portrait of U.S
## 
### 
A deluge of rhythm explodes from the speakers as the Pat
Metheny Group's new album "We Live Here" swirls a rich variety
of sound with a spoon of technique. After waiting six years since
his last album, Metheny captures the rhythmic scene of America in
this fantastic release of musical genre diversity.
"The Girls Next Door" takes a dynamic combination of disco, rap

and soul and its them with a
guitar groove. Electric and
percussive disco sounds dec
orate a rap two-chord pro
gression that keeps the song
on beat and lulls along a slow
trumpet solo.

"We Live here"
Pat Metheny Group

The metallic ratch of a printer introduces the thick sound sen
sation of "We Live Here." Borrowing from the world-music genre,
Mark Ledford's flugelhorn plays a simple melody interspersed
with the roar of an aboriginal people, a trumpeting elephant and a
gusting wind burst. The song, full of color, has to be played sever
al times in order to catch all of its shades.
One unfortunate quality of the album is the dependency on
David Blamires' whining and synthesizer. In the ballad "Some
thing to Remind You" the voice-synthesizer combination drags
out the song with little melodic variation. The complexity of the
synthesized guitar, bass, flugelhorn, piano and other percussion in
"Red Sky" gets lost when Metheny again resorts to the voice-syn
thesizer duo. With all of the techniques they have explored, the Pat
Metheny Group should have found a more sophisticated resolu
tion to the complicated style they worked up in this piece.
An excellent dispaly of technique, rhythm and sound, "We Live
Here" loses merit when it tries to escape its complexity by falling
back on the high-pitched line of the voice-synthesizer duo. Its va
riety of styles makes genre-classification impossible, but it is a
great sampling of the sounds that fill the streets of America today.
