# Deus' new album 'Worst Case Senario' a mockingbird collection of recycled sound
## 
### 
Deus' "Suds And Soda" — from their re
cent album "Worst Case Scenario" — takes
the fuzzy guitars of the Smashing Pumpkins,
the fierce rock-rap of Faith No More and the
playful yet threatening violin of Camper Van
Beethoven and throws them all together, cre
ating a surging, satisfying burst of energy
with a sweet sing-along chorus.
The only problem is that for those listen
ers who have already heard the Smashing
Pumpkins, Faith No More and Camper Van
Beethoven, much of Deus' experimentation
seems less than experimental.

Indeed, "Worst Case Scenario" is an inter
esting and ambitious recording, but the
band's apparent reliance on these borrowed
and recycled sounds often overshadows their
own creative styles.
Hut Deus mixes things up and throws
things together that you don't often hear
thrown together, and this puts them ahead of
much of the MTV crowd that they seem
poised to join.
"Right As Rain" is both sweet and haunt
ing, and "W.C.S. (First Draft)" has a smooth
bluesy groove like something from G. Love

"Worst Case Scenario"
Deus

and Special Sauce. The rocking "Via" and the
soothing "ligsaw You" are similarly appeal
ing, but the album's high points arc too often
obscured by its distractions.
Several of the songs tediously and need
lessly drag on well past the five-minute mark,

and lyrics like "It's so hard to keep the dream
alive," from "Hotellounge," seem to come
straight from a mid-eighties Molly Ringwald
movie soundtrack.
"Worst Case Scenario" has plenty of short
comings and rough edges, but it nevertheless
shows promising creative spirit. And while
Deus' Camper-Van-Pumpkins sound seems
ready to cram them right into the middle of
the alternative radio pack, they at least have
enough spunk to stir up some excitement
there.
