"Zipless"
Vanessa Daou

"Zipless" is an odyssey into a woman's
messy, steamy sexual life, a private session with
a tortured mind. Vanessa Daou whispers in
your ears. She wants to strap you down to a
chair, handcuff and blindfold you, and talk
dirty through the night.
In this album, jazz musician Daou sings
"songs of abandon from the erotic poetry of

' Second Coming
Stone Roses

Not many bands can get away with re
peatedly comparing themselves to Jesus
Christ. On the Stone Roses' first album,
singer lan Brown declared, "1 Am the Res
urrection." Now, five years later, they've
released their long-awaited follow-up,
and, taking a page right out of the New
Testament, they've called it "Second Com
ing."
I'he Stone Roses are proud of them
selves, and rightfully so. With their dazzling
self-titled debut, the band bridged other
worldly dance-pop with underworldly
indie-rock, sparking a musical revolution
out of Manchester, England. They garnered
rave reviews, sold plenty of records and es
tablished a loyal following. Hut then for five
years they released no new music, per
formed no concerts and granted no inter
views.
Now they're back, and the band's "Sec
ond Coming" offers a satisfying batch of
loose, funk-rock grooves, exploring new
territories while still clinging tight to their
Beatles-based pop sensibility. Pleasant mu
sical surprises dominate the record, from
the relentless rhythmic assault of "Begging
You" to the almost Phish-like jam that fin
ishes "Daybreak."
But while their debut thrillingly bal

Krica Jong." Jong, author of "Fear of Flying"
and once touted as a female Henry Miller, has
always been at the forefront of female erotica.
Daou's interpretations of Jong's poems are
seductive and playful. In"The Long Tunnel of
Wanting You," Jong writes: "soft as your sleep
ing cock beginning to stir/ tight as your legs
wrapped around mine... this is the long tun
nel of wanting you."
As the voice of the author, 1 )aou is all sensu
ality— panting, yearning, wanting. It's hard to
tell if she is a good singer, since she doesn't sing.
Instead, she speaks the songs with melody, de
livering the' poetry with musical intonation.

"When I Was Famous

still only 36 seconds.

Modern rock's Huge, (that's right, H-U-G-E-.) may
never be colossal, but they certainly try to be. With a
Warhol-like album cover and matching kitsch lyrics, this
primarily one-man-band is on a mission to critique the
big bucks materialism of musical mammoths. Painting
an underpaid image of success, "When I Was Famous" is
an album of varied styles and motives.
Musically, Huge, has creativity and force, but their
style is difficult to classify. Rather than combining musi
cal genres, Huge, can sound like rock or jazz or reggae
from one track to the next.
Percussion plays a serious role in many of the songs
with bongos and congas tapping in to provide the music
depth. Unlike the wall of sound in some modern rock
today, Huge, maintains that you deserve to hear all the
notes.
And the notes are good. The sound is appealing. The
3 music sticks in your head. All that adds up to some qual-

composes the accompanying score. Her music
is sexy, low and erotic, with a soft and quiet feel
that induces intimacy and loneliness.
The album has the feel of an artsy spoken
word performance done in a dark, small cafe in
Greenwich Village. You can practically see
Daou, sexiness personified, whispering to a mi
crophone — there's a hand playing on the side,
as the audience listens from their chairs; smoke
tills the tiny place.
That's what her voice does to you. It makes
you imagine things.
Jong's poetry is honest and uninhibited,
particularly in "Sunday Afternoons" as she sug
gests masochism: "You knew how easily I

Rob Whitlock, guitarist and lead singer,
has a voice that soars, woos and invites
lethargy. While he doesn't seem to push him
self too hard in his vocal work, content to
stay within his habitual Michael Stipe-esque
upper register, he nevertheless carries his

bruised/ It's like a soreness I would never lose."
However, sometimes Jong goes too far and
sounds just plain silly, as in "My Love Is Too
Much": "It is cooking you seek/ not love/ cook
ing with sex coming after/ cool sex/ that speaks
to the penis alone/ & not the howling chaos/ of
the heart." Huh?
Nevertheless most of the time Jong's poetry
is very direct and revealing. Daou sings the
poems with soul-baring intensity, and there is
something ethereal and dream-like about her
music. The combination is like the love of a
beautiful woman: irresistible, surreal, brutal
and always, always, intense.

songs impressively. Ethan Eldridge on bass,
Joe Kimura on percussion, and Bill Hogan
on piano and organ, round out a full bodied
and confident sound.
The only problem here is that the album
feels unambitious. It's as if the guys in far
away moses have a knack at coming up with
catchy chord progressions and melodies, but
they don't push themselves very hard. Songs
like "The Hill" and "Maybe," likeable pop
songs both of them, nevertheless feel lifeless:
too safe, too staid and too happy.
"Sleep Song" and "Ocean Song," stand
out as the two least successful songs on the
album. Here far moses seems to tem
porarily wallow in both simplicity and senti
mentality. Together they could make a great
audition tape for the next Disney sound
track: listless, overquiet and dull.
but "If You Haven't Heard," "The Sway"
and especially "The Things You Are" capture
interest and redeem the album's slow points.
In these songs fam seems to resist their ha
bitually pared down melodies, displaying
originality, complexity and freshness.
Finally, "Man in Love" deserves comment
for being the only true curve ball on an
album of straight pitches. It's unexpected,
luridlycheesyand sounds like a Vegas lounge
act trapped at a Maui luau. It's a gutsy move.
Overall, fani's debut album promises
great things: appealing pop songs, lilting
acoustic guitars, Whitlock's hallmark croon
ing and great cover art.

ity tracks.
The problem? Huge, doesn't take itself seriously
enough. While the music is seriously good, worthy lyrics
and style are lacking.
Lines like: "I was a cash cow/1 made the milk and they
drank/ 1 was a gravy train/ and they rode on my back to
the bank" represent the absurd side of Huge. Were the
music not so damn addictive, lyrics like these would be
their downfall.
Overall "When I Was Famous" disappoints because
its influences can be seen too easily. Not only do par
ticular lyrics and chords sound like other bands, but
Huge, (the lead singer of Huge.) actually mimics the
vocal intonation of the likes of Anthony Kiedis and
Sting. From Bob Marley to The Police, the Red Hot
Chili Peppers to Jimi Hendrix, Huge, (both the guy and
the band) quotes rather than emulates the bands it ad
mires.
Of course, this behavior is understandable if one
views the album as a critique of fame. But if Huge, says
to us: when you get famous you can only imitate, I say to
them: don't ruin your chances by doing it before you get
there.
