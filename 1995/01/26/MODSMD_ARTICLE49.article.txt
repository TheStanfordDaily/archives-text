Immortal Beloved
Shortly after Ludwig van Beethoven's
death, a cryptic letter was found
among his possessions. Addressed to
his "Immortal Beloved," the letter be
came the impetus for one of history's
great romantic mysteries.
Bernard Rose's "Immortal Beloved"
ponders this question with its own ficti
tious supposition of events. When
Beethoven's secretary Anton (Jeroen
Krabbd) tries to settle his friend's af
fairs after his death, he discovers the
letter and Beethoven's last will and tes
tament, leaving all his possessions to
the mysterious "Immortal Beloved."
Determined to honor Beethoven's final
wishes, Anton travels far and wide, vis
iting Beethoven's many love interests.
IQ
As old-fashioned as the '40s comedies

it tries to emulate, "IQ" is a standard,
by-the-book romantic comedy. There
is no freshness or originality — it goes
through the motions like an equation
being solved by a mathematician.
Tim Robbins plays a lovesick mechan
ic who, abetted by the brilliant mind of
Albert Einstein (Walter Matthau), pre
tends to be a genius physicist. All this
so he can lasso the heart of Einstein's
niece (Meg Ryan).
A Low Down Dirty Shame
In "A Low Down Dirty Shame," Keenar
Ivory Wayans shows that he still has
his comedic abilities from"In Living
Color," but that he is not quite ready fo
action-hero status.
The movie stars former police officer
Andre Shame who, along with his as
sistant Peaches Jordan (Jada Pinkett
of "A Different World" fame) solves

crimes as a private investigator. The
CIA hires Shame to find Angela (Salli
Richardson) who will lead them to a
drug kingpin. When Shame realizes
that he used to date the woman,
Peaches gets jealous and complica
tions arise.
Pret-i-Porter
The entire fashion world has gone day
glo for Robert Altman's latest flick,
"Pret-a-Porter" (otherwise known as
"Ready-to-Wear," a dumbed-down title
given to U.S. audiences). Strangely
enough, this flick has been applauded
by the industry that it tries so desper
ately to ridicule. Do Chnstian, Issey,
Sonia and Jean-Paul have the pink an
gora over their eyes? Non, mon ami,
the fashion world ain't that oblivious.
"Pret-a-Porter" just fails what it had set
out to do — attack the industry.

The film's plot is as thin as Linda Evan
gelista's upper thigh.
To Live
Adapted from Yu Hua's original novel
"Lifetimes," "To Live" documents the
trials and tribulations faced by a family
of four, a wealthy household in pre-lib
eration China, until the father, Fugui
(Ge You), loses their ancestral proper
ty on the gambling table, and is then
reduced to puppeteering to support
his wife and children.
On the eve of Chairman Mao's
takeover, the elder daughter falls so
sick that she becomes deaf and the fa
tigued younger son is killed by a bu
reaucrat's car during the nation-wide
"Great Leap Forward" campaign of
1958. Fugui and Jiazhen (Gong Li)
could not be spared from further grief
by the Cultural Revolution.
