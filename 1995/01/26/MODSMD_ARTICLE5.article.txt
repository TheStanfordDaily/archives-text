# Breaking the habit
## Stop Smoking class starts 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Shaking the smoking habit will soon be
easier thanks in part to Cowell Student
Health Center.
Beginning next week, students, faculty
and staff can sign up for a Stop Smoking
Class â€” a group-oriented course designed
to help smokers stay away from cigarettes.
"There seems to be an increase in smok
ing on campus. .. . It's becoming more com
monplace," said Carole Pertofsky, director
of the Cowell Health Promotion Program,
which is co-sponsoring the class.
The class is partly a response to the Uni
versity policy which prohibits the smoking
or selling of tobacco products on campus.
The most recent part of the policy went into
effect in the fall, when all residences were
declared smoke-free.

"The second-hand effects [of smoking]
are so obvious now," said Vice Provost and
Dean of Student Affairs Mary Edmonds.
The class is "an attempt to address what
might be a need," she said.
The smoking-cessation course begins
next Tuesday, Jan. 31, and will run for six
consecutive Tuesdays, with a professional
instructor leading the class.
"We heard a lot of students wanted to
quit" smoking, Pertofsky said. "The class
could be a really powerful tool [for them]."
With the new residence policy in effect,
she added that smoking students were "left
in a lurch."
"We wanted to reach out to those stu
dents [who want to quit]. It's a tough habit
to kick, and we're looking at this as a posi
tive experience in quitting," Pertofsky said.
In the past, students could go
to Cowell to find out about local
programs on how to quit smoking.
But the number of students
coming in was relatively low,
according to Pertofsky.
One such smoking-cessation
program was run by the Health
Improvement Program at the
Medical School's Center for Dis
ease Prevention, which is also co
sponsoring the class.
"The need for a class was par
ticularly strong. A class seems to
increase the chances for success
in quitting," Pertofsky said.

"There's something dynamic
about a group experience, and it
actually can be fun."
Edmonds said that for stu
dents who live on campus, "it's
just a hassle to go outside" to
smoke, and quitting might be the
best alternative.
"It will be interesting to see
how many people sign up [for the
class]," she added.
According to Pertofsky, Cow
ell is absorbing the cost of the
class for students. "This may be
the last time the class is free,"
she said.
The class is also open to all
faculty and staff at a cost of $60.
It will run from noon to 1 p.m.
every week at Tresidder in a
room yet to be announced.
