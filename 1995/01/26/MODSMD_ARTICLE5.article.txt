# Breaking the habit
## Stop Smoking class starts 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Shaking the smoking habit will soon be
easier thanks in part to Cowell Student
Health Center.
Beginning next week, students, faculty
and staff can sign up for a Stop Smoking
Class â€” a group-oriented course designed
to help smokers stay away from cigarettes.
"There seems to be an increase in smok
ing on campus. .. . It's becoming more com
monplace," said Carole Pertofsky, director
of the Cowell Health Promotion Program,
which is co-sponsoring the class.
The class is partly a response to the Uni
versity policy which prohibits the smoking
or selling of tobacco products on campus.
The most recent part of the policy went into
effect in the fall, when all residences were
declared smoke-free.

"The second-hand effects [of smoking]
are so obvious now," said Vice Provost and
Dean of Student Affairs Mary Edmonds.
The class is "an attempt to address what
might be a need," she said.
The smoking-cessation course begins
next Tuesday, Jan. 31, and will run for six
consecutive Tuesdays, with a professional
instructor leading the class.
"We heard a lot of students wanted to
quit" smoking, Pertofsky said. "The class
could be a really powerful tool [for them]."
With the new residence policy in effect,
she added that smoking students were "left
in a lurch."
"We wanted to reach out to those stu
dents [who want to quit]. It's a tough habit
to kick, and we're looking at this as a posi
tive experience in quitting," Pertofsky said.
