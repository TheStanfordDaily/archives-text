### Sudha Setty 
THURS/26
■ Head up to the City and groove to
a double dose of folk rock with Leon
Russell and Nuts. Both of these groups
take a different perspective on the crunchier
side to rock, but both sounds are fun and
thoroughly enjoyable. Check them out at The
Last Day Saloon, located at 406 Clement St.
in S.F. Tickets are $15 in advance, $17 at the
door. Call 387-6343 for tickets and more infor

14 Schnalle originals. This 16-year veteran of

SAT/28
■ For a refreshingly honest dose of
popular music, check out Pomegran
ate, a local band from the City that
put out the single "Down Around Her
Ankles / Wicked Wind." If the title isn't
so tempting, perhaps you'll be enticed by the
comparisons that fly around between Pome
granate and Counting Crows. Regardless,
this band has been described as introspec
tive, delightfully lyrical and full of tormented
charm. End the conflicting reports and see for
yourself as they open for Feed and Love

1840 Haight St.in S.F. Pomegranate hits the
stage at 9:45 p.m. Call 387-2996 for more in

pageants, parades and balls start up next
week.

■ For a refreshingly honest dose of
popular music, check out Pomegran
ate, a local band from the City that
put out the single "Down Around Her
Ankles / Wicked Wind." If the title isn't
so tempting, perhaps you'll be enticed by the
comparisons that fly around between Pome
granate and Counting Crows. Regardless,
this band has been described as introspec
tive, delightfully lyrical and full of tormented
charm. End the conflicting reports and see for
yourself as they open for Feed and Love
Runs Red at Club Boomerang, located at
1840 Haight St.in S.F. Pomegranate hits the
stage at 9:45 p.m. Call 387-2996 for more in
