# Mourning period
## Campus services help students deal with deaths of loved ones 
### Valerie Hung 
At a time when most students are thinking about
beginnings — the beginning of a new quarter, new
classes, a new year — friends of Jessica Williams,
Bart McCormick and David Liu are learning to cope
with endings.
And while the recent deaths of these three stu
dents called attention to students grieving at Stan
ford, at any given time many students are also coping
with less-publicized losses of friends and family
members.
Many grieving students seek counseling from ser
vices such as the Bridge or Counseling and Psycho
logical Services.
According to CAPS Director Alejandro Martinez,
however, "the primary resource that students have
are their friends, and that really goes beyond any re
source that we [at CAPS] can offer."
The second resource, continued Martinez, is a
student's sense of spirituality.
"For some people that's a very important part of

their lives and so it is through their spiritual frame
work that they try to make sense out of [their loss],"
he said. "It's not surprising that many students go to
the Dean of the Chapel to talk."
"Grieving the Loss of a Loved One" — a support
group started by Counselor Charlotte Siegel at the
request of Dean of the Chapel Robert Gregg —
evolved out of this need. Open to all students, the six-


Peter Lagerquist— Daily
week group provides a place for
sharing emotions.
These emotions can range from
feeling numb, guilty or even, in the
case of a long-term or painful ill
ness, relief.
According to Siegel, some of the
typical frustrations expressed by
students include, " 'I can't work, I
can't concentrate, I find myself
wanting to cry, but I don't want to
cry, I don't want to be breaking
down.' "
Behind all this machinery of
support lies the Office of Residen
tial Education. When a student
dies, the Residence Dean for that
area becomes the case manager,
coordinating the University's
response. A specific protocol con
sisting of a series of phone calls is
then initiated.
Assoc. Director of Res Ed Diana
Conklin described the network of
contacts as "ripples in the water. It
just keeps spreading out and out
and out. And the Residence Dean is
the one who drops the first stone to

get the ripples going."
The difference for graduate stu
dents is that typically the situation
is handled by the academic depart
ment of the deceased.
As in the case of David Liu,
"many times those folks who are
most impacted for the graduate stu
dents might be the students in the
same academic department as
opposed to students in their resi
dences," explained Residence Dean
for Escondido Village Chris Griffith.
For RFs, however, no strict pro
tocol exists.
"You decide that on the phone
based on their familiarity with the
students involved," Conklin said.
"A lot of this is really tailored to the
individual person or situation."
Julie Taylor, one of Jessica
Williams' RFs, also emphasized the
importance of allowing for differ
ences in individual response.
"I'm not going to try and be
everybody's number one support
person, because that doesn't feel
appropriate to everybody," Taylor
said. "I think my job as a resident
fellow is to make sure that every
body has somebody more than to
be that somebody."
The RFs in Mirrielees, Williams'

residence, also helped contact fac
ulty members in order to discuss
items such as midterms and
papers.
"Eventually the students were
able to negotiate these things with
the faculty themselves, but within
the first few days, they weren't
really able to do that," Taylor said.
Williams' friends dealt with
their feelings in other ways. Some
held on to the image of the sun
flower, one of Williams' favorite
flowers.
"I know friends of Jessica's who
have lots of cards or blankets or
photo things with sunflowers that
they've acquired since she died,"
Taylor said. "We've talked about
perhaps having even a sunflower
garden in Mirrielees in her memo
ry. And I think that's one way peo
ple cope, being able to identify her
through this symbol that's all
around them."
Siegel has found a similar device
to be "amazing" for members of
her support group. At the end of
the group for the past four years,
students were given the option of
bringing in a tangible reminder of
the deceased.
"The photo, the obituary, the

poem ... or something that
describes the meaningfulness of
this attachment makes this [per
son! very real," Siegel said.
This method for helping cope
also might aid in the progress of
what some believe is an evolution
of stages followed afler the loss of a
loved one.
"There is literature which sug
gests that you go through stages,"
Martinez explained. "But it's not
always a straight through pattern.
There are certain periods of denial,
periods of grieving; there's a pro
cess of incorporation, a process of
reassessment of priorities."
Now that time has put some dis
tance from Williams' accident, Tay
lor sees this process of incorpora
tion taking place around her.
"I think that people think about
Jessica a lot, but it's not necessari
ly the focal point of what's happen
ing to them all day every day," Tay
lor said. "People are accepting it as
a part of their lives."
For those struggling to accept,
Martinez had one last bit of advice.
"It's a powerful event in our lives
and we need to take care of our
selves, to talk to our friends and
not become isolated."

photo things with sunflowers that
they've acquired since she died,"
Taylor said. "We've talked about
perhaps having even a sunflower
garden in Mirrielees in her memo
ry. And I think that's one way peo
ple cope, being able to identify her
through this symbol that's all
around them."
Siegel has found a similar device
to be "amazing" for members of
her support group. At the end of
the group for the past four years,
students were given the option of
bringing in a tangible reminder of
the deceased.
"The photo, the obituary, the

poem ... or something that
describes the meaningfulness of
this attachment makes this [per
son! very real," Siegel said.
This method for helping cope
also might aid in the progress of
what some believe is an evolution
of stages followed afler the loss of a
loved one.
"There is literature which sug
gests that you go through stages,"
Martinez explained. "But it's not
always a straight through pattern.
There are certain periods of denial,
periods of grieving; there's a pro
cess of incorporation, a process of
reassessment of priorities."
Now that time has put some dis
tance from Williams' accident, Tay
lor sees this process of incorpora
tion taking place around her.
"I think that people think about
Jessica a lot, but it's not necessari
ly the focal point of what's happen
ing to them all day every day," Tay
lor said. "People are accepting it as
a part of their lives."
For those struggling to accept,
Martinez had one last bit of advice.
"It's a powerful event in our lives
and we need to take care of our
selves, to talk to our friends and
not become isolated."
