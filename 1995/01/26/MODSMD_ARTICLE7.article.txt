# Minor voting glitches anger some students
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Though many voters praised the simplicity of
the ASSU's new voting system on the World Wide
Web, the first day of the winter special election was
marked by a minor technical glitch and student
concerns about lack of privacy while voting.
The votes of some students trying to vote yes
terday morning by XMosaic — a Web browser for
the X Window environment used
on many campus computers —
were not accepted at first, but the
problem was resolved by noon, said
Kevin Morris, a programmer for
Residential Computing.
"Probably less than 50 students
were affected, and that was mostly
graduate students in computer sci
ence or other technical fields who
were working off their work sta
tions in the lab," Morris said. No
one voting from a dorm cluster or
Tresidder LaIR experienced any
difficulties, he added.
In addition to this minor flaw,
several students sent electronic
mail messages to the ASSU criticiz
ing what they perceived to be a lack
of privacy when voting, Morris said.
While entering votes through
the World Wide Web applications,
students are warned that the sub
mission process is "insecure,"
meaning that "the information you
are sending could be compromised
by a third party." Voters are then
told that if they are sending pass
words or other private informa
tion, it might "be safer... to cancel
the submission."
Throughout the day, many stu
dents posted messages on ASSU
electronic bulletin boards warning
others not to vote over the system.
ASSU senator Donald Aing
worth, a graduate student in com
puter science, was one student who
expressed concern about the new
system. "There are several security
problems, the most serious being

the fact that when I vote, my pass
word gets splashed across the top
of the screen, there for anybody to
read," he said.
He added that the ASSU did
manage to fix the password problem
on some programs, but not others.
Aingworth also complained
that, by voting, he was also giving
his e-mail password to the ASSU.
But Morris, the author and
administrator of the online voting
system, stressed that he is the only
person who sees the passwords. He
uses the passwords to authenticate
a student's identity and then dis
cards them.
He added that the voting pro
cess does not jeopardise a student's
privacy any more than "when you
log in to check your e-mail."
This voting system is graphical
ly-based and accessible from any
computer connected to the Stan
ford University Network (SUNet),
said ASSU Elections Commission
er Jonathan Berent.
"The people I've talked to have
all commented on how easy the new
voting system is," Berent said. "It
takes less than a minute for people
to vote.... The graphical interface
makes it more user-friendly."
The two-day special election will
determine the fate of the special-fee
reform measure CA-1, also known
as the Balanced Funding Deal.
If passed, the Balanced Funding
Deal will, among other things, sepa
rate graduates and undergraduates
into two distinct communities for
voting and collecting special fees,
eliminate the fee-refund system as
it currently exists and allow the sen
ate to cap on the total amount of
fees that can be placed on the ballot.
