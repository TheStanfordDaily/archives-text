In order to gather community input about pro
posed renovations to the west side of campus, a model
of the new Science and Engineering Quad (SEQ) will
be open to the Stanford community between Febru
ary and May.
University President Gerhard Casper announced
in October that the University plans to build a new
science and engineering campus west of the Quad
usinga $77.4 million grant from William Hewlett and
David Packard.
Until the construction is completed in 1999, the
project team is attempting to minimize its effect on
the teaching and research in and around the project
area by gathering community input.
"Our goal is a 'low-impact' construction pro
gram," said Mark Jones, director of Facilities Project


Daily â€” Matt Garlinghouse
The small-scale model of the new $77.4-million Science and Engi
neering Quad will be available for public viewing in the McCullough
Building next month.
