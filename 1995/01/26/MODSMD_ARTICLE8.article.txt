# Model of science quad to be shown
## Design to be available next month 
### Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing writer 
In order to gather community input about pro
posed renovations to the west side of campus, a model
of the new Science and Engineering Quad (SEQ) will
be open to the Stanford community between Febru
ary and May.
University President Gerhard Casper announced
in October that the University plans to build a new
science and engineering campus west of the Quad
usinga $77.4 million grant from William Hewlett and
David Packard.
Until the construction is completed in 1999, the
project team is attempting to minimize its effect on
the teaching and research in and around the project
area by gathering community input.
"Our goal is a 'low-impact' construction pro
gram," said Mark Jones, director of Facilities Project

The small-scale model of the new $77.4-million Science and Engi
neering Quad will be available for public viewing in the McCullough
Building next month.
Management. "The first objective
in this outreach program is to
inform the community about the
project planning and scheduling."
The model will be located in an
Interpretive Center open next
week in the McCullough Building,
along with drawings, maps and
timelines for the new quad.
The SEQ is a series of inter
linked projects planned for the next
four years to redevelop the west
campus area. Four new buildings
and a new landscape quad will be
erected, while the McCullough and
Varian buildings will be renovated.
Five existing structures — the
Physics Tank, Sequoia Hall, the
Electronics Research Laboratory
and the Electrical Engineering
Department offices — will be
demolished by 1999.
The project team began inform
ing Stanford about its project in
November with a public forum host
ed by Provost Condoleezza Rice.
"A major goal {in gathering
community inputl is to provide a

convenient way for the community
to ask and get timely answers to
any questions they may have about
the SEQ program," Jones stated.
Staff will be present at the
Interpretive Center weekday
mornings to explain the material
and receive community feedback.
In addition, the project team
will send updated reports to The
Daily and the Campus Report to
respond to community feedback.
"I have repeatedly stressed that
the planning for sequencing the
various construction / demolition
phases to minimize impacts on the
community is so important that it
needs to be treated as if it were
choreography," Jones said.
The project team's goal is not to
get design input from the commu
nity, said Jones, but to allow the
community to ask questions and
voice concerns regarding potential
construction conflicts and impacts.
"The project is a quantum leap
in state of the art facilities for sci
ence and engineering and also of
historic importance in finally
implementing the vision of the
Near West campus contained in
the Olmsted campus plan more
than a century ago."
