# New journal takes on both sides of issues
## 
### Burt Herman Staff writer 
Looking for something new to
read over lunch?
A new bi-partisan student jour
nal might just be the perfect com
panion to that Food Service garden
burger.
"The Thinker," now available
around campus, aims to bring a
more balanced approach to campus
journalism. Attempting to look
journalistic bias straight in the
face, the bi-monthly journal will
take a single issue every other week
and devote equal space to argu
ments on both sides.
"Thus is the best way to learn,"
said sophomore Nick Thompson,
publisher of the journal. "You get
both sides."
"It's a journal to surmount the
divisive tone discourse around here
has," said Ryan Bounds, The

Thinker's editor in chief.
The first issue of The Thinker
explores arguments over affirma
tive action, featuring a debate be
tween Sally Dickson, director of
the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment, and Stanford Review
News Editor Ed Malone. Other ar
ticles contribute to the dialogue.
The next issue will explore how
Stanford balances athletics and the
arts, said Bounds, a senior major
ing in psychology and political sci
ence. The housing of sororities and
the question of whether Stanford
students do enough homework
may become the subject of future
issues.
The goal of The Thinker,
Bounds said, is twofold: "to put
counter-arguments in one forum"
and to "allow public forum for is
sues that don't normally make
campus publications."
While some criticize the current
crop of campus publications as
being biased in one way or another,
The Thinker's founders intend to
put their bias out front, being per
fectly clear about which side each
article takes.
"We're trying to get that kind of
slanted journalism on one page
and admit they are that," Bounds
said. "It fills a unique niche."
Thomspon, an earth systems
and public policy major, is a liberal,
and Bounds is a conservative — a
point that both stress is an impor
tant part of the newspaper.
The entire staff of about 10 con
sists of people from various view
points, including liberals, moder

ates and conservatives, Bounds
said. And debates among members
of the staff are part of the fun in
publishing the journal, he added.
The journal is receiving most of
its funds from the ASSU Publica
tions Board. But for the future,
Bounds hopes to get more funding
from outside groups.
The cost of publishing is "trivial
to off-campus organizations," he
said.
Thompson and Bounds first
got together on the project this
fall. Bounds said the idea came
from a similar journal at the Uni
versity of Michigan, where it has
become something of a fixture. He
hopes the same will happen at
Stanford.
"It could easily become a cam
pus institution," Bounds said. "I
hope everyone reads it and it starts
the discourse it's supposed to."
