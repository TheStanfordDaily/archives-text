Looking for something new to
read over lunch?
A new bi-partisan student jour
nal might just be the perfect com
panion to that Food Service garden
burger.
"The Thinker," now available
around campus, aims to bring a
more balanced approach to campus
journalism. Attempting to look
journalistic bias straight in the
face, the bi-monthly journal will
take a single issue every other week
and devote equal space to argu
ments on both sides.
"Thus is the best way to learn,"
said sophomore Nick Thompson,
publisher of the journal. "You get
both sides."
"It's a journal to surmount the
divisive tone discourse around here
has," said Ryan Bounds, The

Thinker's editor in chief.
The first issue of The Thinker
explores arguments over affirma
tive action, featuring a debate be
tween Sally Dickson, director of
the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment, and Stanford Review
News Editor Ed Malone. Other ar
ticles contribute to the dialogue.
The next issue will explore how
Stanford balances athletics and the
arts, said Bounds, a senior major
ing in psychology and political sci
ence. The housing of sororities and
the question of whether Stanford
students do enough homework
may become the subject of future
issues.
The goal of The Thinker,
Bounds said, is twofold: "to put
counter-arguments in one forum"
and to "allow public forum for is
sues that don't normally make
campus publications."
