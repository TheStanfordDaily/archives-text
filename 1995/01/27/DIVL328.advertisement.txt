Final Notice About Changes in Potable Water Supply Quality
For February and March 1995
The San Francisco Water Department (SFWD) has notified all communities receiving potable water from
SFWD that there will be a significant change in water quality starting February 1, 1995 through the end
of March 1995. This is the final notice before the changes occur.
The water will still be completely safe to drink but some sensitive equipment or laboratory operations will
be affected. The reason for the change in water quality is that SFWD will be shutting down the Coast
Range Tunnel for inspection and maintenance. During the shutdown, no water from Hetch Hetchy (our
usual major source of high quality water) will be delivered. Instead, other reservoris and sources will be
used for the water supply.
During February and March 1995, our water quality is expected to change as follows:
Total Dissolved Solids 60 ppm 200 - 300 ppm
Hardness 25 ppm 100 - 150 ppm
Conductivity 70 umhos 320 - 520 umhos
Total Organic Carbon 1.5 ppm 3.5-5 ppm
Alkalinity 20 ppm 90 - 110 ppm
Please note the water will be safe to drink, but will taste different from our current supply.
You'll need to schedule more frequent maintenance of filter and other water purification systems.
If you have questions, please call Marty Laporte at 5-7864.
