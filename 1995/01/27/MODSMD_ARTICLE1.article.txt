# Fac Sen adopts reforms
## Writing, language proposals prevail 
### Beth Berselli Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writers 
In the first real test of faculty
willingness to adopt the proposals
of the Commission of Undergradu
ate Education, the Faculty Senate
voted yesterday to strengthen the
University's writing and foreign
language requirements.
These reforms are the first of
the commission's proposals to
come to a vote in the senate. The
commission's final report was re
leased four months ago.
As Biology Prof. Bob Simoni,
the senate chair, said: "We actual
ly made some progress."
As a result of the senate's ac
tion, three years of high-school
study will no longer satisfy the for
eign language requirement and
every major will now include a
"writing-intensive" course.
Beginning with the entering
class of 1996-97, students can ful
fill the new requirement by scoring
a 4 or 5 on the Advanced Place
ment test or 600 or better on the
SAT achievement test, or by pass
ing a proficiency test or completing
three quarters of foreign-language
study at Stanford.
About 200 students each year
who now fulfill the requirement
with high-school study would not
meet the new requirement, accord
ing to statistics from the commis
sion.
