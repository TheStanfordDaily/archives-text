# Fac Sen adopts reforms
## Writing, language proposals prevail 
### Beth Berselli Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writers 
In the first real test of faculty
willingness to adopt the proposals
of the Commission of Undergradu
ate Education, the Faculty Senate
voted yesterday to strengthen the
University's writing and foreign
language requirements.
These reforms are the first of
the commission's proposals to
come to a vote in the senate. The
commission's final report was re
leased four months ago.
As Biology Prof. Bob Simoni,
the senate chair, said: "We actual
ly made some progress."
As a result of the senate's ac
tion, three years of high-school
study will no longer satisfy the for
eign language requirement and
every major will now include a
"writing-intensive" course.
Beginning with the entering
class of 1996-97, students can ful
fill the new requirement by scoring
a 4 or 5 on the Advanced Place
ment test or 600 or better on the
SAT achievement test, or by pass
ing a proficiency test or completing
three quarters of foreign-language
study at Stanford.
About 200 students each year
who now fulfill the requirement
with high-school study would not
meet the new requirement, accord
ing to statistics from the commis
sion.
Industrial Engineering Prof.
Elisabeth Pate-Cornell stressed
the importance of foreign language
study in this "global world."
"It is a training of the mind, a
way of following someone else's
pattern of thinking," she said.
But Statistics Prof. Bradley
Efron voiced several objections to
increasing the requirement. He
said he does not buy the argument
that Stanford should strengthen
its requirement because that is
what our peer institutions do.
"It reminds me of my mom's
advice when she said, 'If Larry
jumps off the bridge, are you
going to do it too?' " he remarked.
Efron added that the proposal
is "heavy-handed and unwise,"
and will place an "unfair tax on
students' time," especially stu
dents in technical majors.
In comparison, the proposal to
increase the writing requirement
met with less controversy. The
proposal will require all students
to pass a "writing-intensive"
course in their major in addition
to the requisite freshman Writing
and Critical Thinking courses.

However, a few senators raised
concerns about the cost and logis
tics of implementing the proposal.
Spanish and Portuguese Prof.
Mary Pratt pointed out that the
new "writing-intensive" courses
in the major will require extra
teaching assistants, who are paid
at a higher rate than normal TAs
in non-"writing-intensive" class
es.
Other senators questioned the
role of the advisory board set up
to oversee the new requirement.
Chemistry Prof. Michael Fayer, a
senator, wondered aloud what
constitutes a "writing-intensive"
course in the sciences or engineer
ing.
According to the proposal, the
advisory board will help depart
ments determine which classes
will satisfy the requirement.
Despite the senate's positive
votes on the two requirements,
these changes are not absolutely
set in stone, as the senate passed a
resolution that leaves open the
possibility of revisiting any action
taken on the commission's pro
posals.
According to the resolution, at
the end of this academic year the
senate may choose to reverse any

previous votes in the context of
subsequent actions that might
increase degree requirements
beyond the present level.
"At the end of the year we will
be able to take a sober second
look," said University President
Gerhard Casper. "We are leaving
an escape clause in case anybody
thinks we have been drunk."
Senators were hesitant to vote
on such items as strengthening
the foreign language requirement
without knowing whether other
requirements will be added on
and thus significantly increase
students' course load, Simoni
added.
"My concern is the total num
ber of distribution requirements,"
said Biology Prof. Pat Jones. "It's
not possible to vote on [the for
eign language requirement] today
without knowing what the other
requirements will be."
Several senators voiced con
cerns about whether this resolu
tion signifies too "tentative" of an
action on the part of the senate.
"My concern is that it be very
clear that these are real votes on
the requirements, and not pend
ing ones," Provost Condoleezza
Rice said.
