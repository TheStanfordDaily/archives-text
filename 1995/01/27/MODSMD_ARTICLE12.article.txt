## House passes budget amendment 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In a striking
triumph for the new Republican majority,
the House voted strong approval last
night for a balanced-budget amendment
to the Constitution designed to eliminate
chronic federal deficits.
The 300-132, bipartisan endorsement
was 12 more than the two-thirds majority
needed to send the measure to the Senate.
Supporters expressed confidence that
they would also prevail there, despite the
likelihood of a protracted battle later this
winter, and would ultimately send the
measure to the states for a final ratifica
tion drive.
Loud cheers erupted in the chamber
when Speaker Newt Gingrich, architect of
last fall's GOP election sweep in the
House, announced the results of a prelim
inary roll call that demonstrated suffi
cient support to pass the measure.
The vote came little more than three
weeks after Republicans took control of
the House and launched a 100-day effort
to implement their conservative "Con

tract With America," with its promise of
lower taxes and less government.
After the House approved the amend
ment, Gingrich called it a bipartisan, "his
toric moment for the country," and said
newly empowered Republicans had "kept
our promise" to the voters.
The White House reacted coolly. "We
all want to see a balanced budget," said
press spokesman Mike McCurry. "But
the president would also like to see the
details of how the House would propose to
meet this new constitutional require
ment." Clinton has no formal say in the
amendment, since it would go directly
from Congress to the states.
Before the final vote, Democrats failed
in an effort to force Republicans to unveil
a detailed program of spending cuts, and
failed again in a politically enticing
attempt to exempt Social Security from
future spending reductions. Republicans
insist they plan no Social Security cuts.
But the Democrats succeeded in
thwarting a more severe amendment that

would have required three-fifths majority
votes in Congress to raise taxes.
Republican Leader Dick Armey of
Texas, near the end of the daylong debate,
said that as a result of years of deficits,
"Each and every one of our children today
is endowed with $18,000 of federal debt."
Without the amendment, he said, "that
indebtedness will grow larger and larger
and larger."
Countered Rep. Jim McDermott, D-
Wash., "If the Republicans want to deci
mate Social Security, Medicare and basic
community services, let them vote for the
balanced-budget amendment. I will not."
The measure received the support of
228 of the House's 230 Republicans, and
72 Democrats — more than a third of
those voting. Among them was Rep.
Charles Stenholm, D-Texas., a veteran of
past legislative wars, who noted wryly
that the Republican leadership was far
more cooperative than the Democratic
majority had been of budget-balancing
efforts.
