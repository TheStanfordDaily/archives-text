Rampaging gunman
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) - A gunman
opened fire in downtown Chapel Hill yester
day, killing two people and wounding two
others with a high-powered rifle, police said.
The man began shooting at passing cars
about 2 p.m. and was arrested within an
hour after being shot by police, authorities
said.
The gunman wounded a bystander who
tackled him and a female police officer. All
three were taken to hospitals, where their
conditions were not immediately available.
Ed Donegan, a grocery store owner, told
Raleigh television station WRAL that the
gunfire started inside the courthouse, across
the street from the University of North Car
olina at Chapel Hill.
"This came up like a sudden storm,"
Donegan said. "There was a tremendous
amount of shooting. I have no idea the
amount of rounds. It was not like 10 shots

were fired. This was more along the lines of
25 or 30 at least."
Russia continues attack
GROZNY, Russia (AP) â€” Russian
artillery shells rained down on the southern
fringe of the Chechen capital yesterday,
trapping Russian mothers searching for
their soldier sons and prompting some of
Grozny's last residents to flee.
The mothers arrived in Grozny earlier
this week, and were staying in an abandoned
apartment building on the southernmost
edge of the city. The neighborhood had been
one of the few untouched by the massive
firepower Russia has unleashed on the
Chechen capital.
Officials in the neighboring region of
Ingushetia said they sent in buses to evacu
ate the group of about 40 Russian women.
But as night fell, there was no word of their
fate.
