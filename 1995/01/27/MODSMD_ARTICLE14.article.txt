# Auschwitz liberation remembered

OSWIECIM, Poland (AP) - A
half century later, it was as if the
unburied dead of Auschwitz-Birke
nau were talking back to the living
through Moshe Stern.
His voice soaring in unbridled
anger, the Israeli cantor's prayer for
the dead recalled the boys and girls
"killed, destroyed, expunged by the
Nazis and their helpers."
They were the aunts and uncles
that Rivkah Young never met. They
were, by the time the Nazis were
done, 1.5 million brothers, sisters,
mothers and fathers.
Fifty years after Soviet soldiers
liberated Auschwitz, the world Jew
ish community was holding a cere
mony of its own at the world's
biggest Jewish graveyard, a place
where human ashes still linger in
fields and ponds.
The main commemorations are
planned for tomarrow. But they
were organized chiefly by President
Lech Walesa's office, and many
Jews felt they did not adequately
reflect Auschwitz's symbolism as

the Holocaust's chief charnel house.
About 300 people attended yes
terday's separate ceremony: mostly
Jews, but also Gypsy survivors of
Auschwitz-Birkenau and other con
centration camps. People who were
tortured, starved, humiliated and
still feel fear.
German President Roman Her
zog, a boy during World War 11, was
the only head of state. He wore the
same dark suit and fedora as the
German Jewish leaders he accom
panied. He barely spoke, pain
etched on his face.
Walesa spoke earlier yesterday in
Krakow at Jagiellonian University,
where 184 professors were seized by
the Nazis in November 1939 and
deported to Sachsenhausen, a con
centration camp just outside Berlin.
Never once, however, did he
utter the word "Jews."
Some Jewish leaders ignored the
university ceremony, including the
president of the European Jewish
Congress, Jean Kahn, and Elie
Wiesel, the Nobel Peace Prize win

ner who headed the U.S. delega
tion.
Likewise, no official Polish repre
sentative attended the Jewish
observance, where Kahn accused
Walesa's office of organizing "a
nationalist celebration" that dimin
ished the Holocaust's Jewish
dimension.
But prominent Jews including
Wiesel, an Auschwitz survivor, were
determined to mend relations with
Poles and none suggested a boycott
of Friday's main ceremony.
Wiesel and Israeli Knesset
Speaker Shevach Weiss said they
met with Walesa and agreed that a
peace declaration to be released at
the main ceremony would acknowl
edge Jews were the main target of
the Nazi genocide plan symbolized
by Auschwitz.
Nine in 10 of the 1.5 million peo
ple killed at the largest Nazi camp
complex — people gassed, starved,
clubbed, hung, shot, worked to
death in outlying armaments and
chemical plants — were Jews.
