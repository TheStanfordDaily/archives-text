## Editorial Solace for Crothers 
### 
Crothers Hall should be
connected to the SUNet
for the sake of fairness

Remember orienta
tion WEEK for first year
students. Parking in the red
zones was not only allowed, it was
encouraged. Large banners wel
comed students to their newly ren
ovated dorms. Older students wore
color-coordinated t-shirts display
ing their membership on "Leland's
Hospitality Squad." No classes to
attend. No notes to take. And no
one scoped out the competition. In
fact, the only "scoping" was of a
more primitive sort. The only
tough questions sounded some
thing like, "Oh, you're from the
East Coast, do you know my cousin
Rick?" Just all the pizza and social
izing that the spirit can handle.
Remember that? Not if you go to
the Law School.
Generally, while other law
schools persecute students arbi
trarily, Stanford prides itself on
fair and equal persecution. In fact,
unlike some law schools where stu
dents are welcomed by reading
assignments, Stanford tries to be
hospitable for at least a day. In that
vein, a catered Mexican meal
serves as Orientation Week.
But before the heartburn is
gone, many beginning law students
realize that they have been treated
unfairly — they will have to spend
the entire year in Crothers Hall.
The rooms are very small and the
bathrooms are few and far
between. In fact, if you listen really
closely, you can hear the echoes of
decades of law students saying, "I
paid $30,000 to live in a closet?"
But just when they thought it
could not get worse, it does. During
computer orientation, law stu
dents are treated to an elaborate
presentation on the SUNet. But,
says the presenter casually, those
of you in Crothers (about a quarter

of the class) do not have direct
access, so go get a modem.
So, while Crothers comes com
plete with mice, thin walls and
bushes filled with skunks and rac
coons, it does not have direct
access. According to Law School
Dean Paul Brest, access has
become a necessity for law stu
dents because many professors are
distributing course assignments
and other necessary material over
the net. Therefore, Crothers resi
dents — most of whom are in
heavy debt — are told to shell out a
few more hundred bucks for a
modem. Coupled with the more
substantial differences between
Crothers and palatial digs like
Rains, the lack of direct access
seems to be inequity piled on
inequity.
Crothers was built before the
advent of the automobile super
highway, let alone the information
superhighway. Because of the
dorm's age, giving its residents
direct access to the SUNet will take
major renovation. Dean Brest and
the Law School are pushing the
University to make this a reality.
University Housing and Dining
has begun to move forward with its
10-year capital improvement plan.
This plan includes the wiring of
some dorm rooms, including
Crothers, for direct access to the
net. According to Jeff Merriman,
Director of Residential Comput
ing, the University, to its credit,
has already moved forward with
plans to wire Crothers in the sum
mer of 1996. Nonetheless, current
residents will have to continue to
use slow and expensive modems, as
will next year's.
The Crothers wiring project
should be expedited. Next year's
incoming law students do not
expect pizza socials and big wel
come banners, but they do deserve
direct access to the SUNet, espe
cially since it is becoming essential.
If not possible, the University and
the Law School must stick to their
current plan and have this done in
1996.
