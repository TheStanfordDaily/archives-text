## Russell A. Berman Overseas programs are windows to the world 
### 
WITH THE END
of the Cold War,
many of the cer
tainties that structured
American engagement in
the world for half a cen
tury have faded, and it
sometimes seems that
the nation is turning
inward, suspicious of all

that is "foreign." Yet this current of isola
tionism, an old American tradition, misses
the point that international connections
and opportunities are expanding in ways
unimaginable before the fall of the Berlin
Wall. This is perhaps nowhere more evi
dent than in Russia, where the post-com
munist era has led to the growth of a sig
nificant community of expatriate Ameri
cans, seeking opportunities in a fledgling
capitalist economy that could also benefit
from their management and business
skills.
Though many Americans are attracted
by such new global opportunities, few have
the experience, knowledge or education to
move quickly and effectively into interna
tional jobs. The lack of language training in
secondary schools has long been a marked
feature of the American educational sys
tem. This deficiency was symptomatic of a
willful insularity that was central to the
formation of a national identity threatened
by waves of immigration. The role of lan
guage in the formation of national identity
is changing, however, as the United States
slowly comes to grips with the plurality of
language within its own borders.
Yet the rationale for learning about
other cultures and their languages is not
only a pragmatic calculation. Achieving a
foreign cultural literacy — some substan
tive understanding of another perspective
on the world — is crucial to the project of a

liberal arts education. By studying another
language, one learns something about lan
guage in general; by scrutinizing another
culture, one learns about difference in gen
eral; and by immersing oneself in another
country's habits and values, one ends up
reflecting more on one's own assumptions
and traditions. That reflective capacity is a
cornerstone of education in a democracy.
In order to promote a foreign cultural
literacy, a new foreign language require
ment has been proposed by the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education. It is a
prudent and timely initiative of modest
scope, but of great significance to the
future of education. The Faculty Senate
will decide soon whether it will adopt the
recommendations. Hopefully the outcome
will send a message that Stanford is joining
in a turn toward greater recognition of
today's international challenges.
In fact, Stanford already provides its
students with opportunities to prepare for
the new international environment.
Between a quarter and a third of Stanford
undergraduates take advantage of Stan
ford's campuses overseas. The Overseas
Studies Program (OSP) maintains cam
puses in Berlin, Florence, Kyoto, Moscow,
Oxford, Paris and Santiago. Each center
offers a curricular program designed as a
gateway to the culture of the host nation,
as well as generous extracurricular activi
ties. Enrollment at local universities often
reinforces course offerings at the centers
and broadens contact with a foreign aca
demic system and with foreign students.
Perhaps even more importantly, at almost
all of the centers students live with families
rather than in dorms, an experience that
greatly deepens a student's cultural under
standing and language skills.
Coursework provides an ideal and
essential compliment to the most exciting

areas of expansion in Stanford's overseas
programs, the creation of new opportuni
ties for internships and research. The
Berlin center and, more recently, SCTI in
Kyoto have provided Stanford students
with internships in German and Japanese
businesses, industries and government
agencies. The program in Santiago has pio
neered the concept of the research module,
which allows students to engage in
research in cultural, social science or bio
logical and environmental sciences in the
context of a developing economy. OSP is
currently expanding the network of intern
ships and research opportunities at all of
the centers; internships and research tuto
rials will be available next year in Moscow
(as well as some special summer school
courses in intensive Russian). These expe
riences are especially valuable since they
allow students to engage with the host cul
ture directly and to develop their own
understanding of the very different ways
other peoples interpret the world and
maintain their values.
Just at the moment when the interna
tional world is becoming smaller and the
cultural world of Americans is expanding
to include a non-English speaking popula
tion, Stanford students have resources
available to them to learn about other cul
tures first-hand. The Stanford centers
overseas do not provide students with a
modern version of a Grand Tour. They do
give students a means of preparing for
and even of becoming part of the increas
ingly complex international world. Appli
cations for study overseas next autumn
are due today, January 27 in Sweet Hall.
For next winter quarter they are due on
April 21.
