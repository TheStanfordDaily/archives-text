Violations of Honor Code are difficult to live with

THIS IS AN anonymous letter con
cerning the Honor Code at Stan
ford University. I graduated from
Stanford 10 years ago with a B.S. degree
Years later, I received an M.S. degree
and just recently I received a Ph.D.
degree, both from public institutions.
But while I was at Stanford, I violated
the Honor Code in five different circum
stances. The first violation, I turned in a
paper that I had written previously for
another class. The second violation, I

gained access to an essay that someone
else had written, and I used this essay as
the basis of the paper that I later submit
ted as my own. The third violation, I
entered another student's computer
account to copy several computer pro
grams which I modified and submitted as
my own. In the fourth incident, I
explained to one of my teachers that I
had handed in a homework assignment
that I never actually completed. He based
my grade on my previous work. Finally,

in my fifth violation of the Honor Code, I
took a final exam late, and before I took
the exam I obtained a copy of it. My
friend helped me with the answers to the
exam before I actually wrote it.
All this behavior was a big mistake on
my part. My dream is to become a col
lege professor. But how can I become a
college professor if my undergraduate
career is false? I am proud of my accom
plishments after graduating from Stan
ford, but I am ashamed of my behavior

while at Stanford. I wish I had the
"time" and the "financial resources" to
undo what I described above while I was
at Stanford.
But I have decided to go on with my
life. I have decided to write this letter so
that people are aware that I made this
mistake. Maybe after having read this
letter, someone will not make the same
mistakes that I made. That is my inten
tion.
