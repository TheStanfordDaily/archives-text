# 50-50 vote kills special-fee deal
## 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
Students rejected the ASSU's
controversial special-fee reform
amendment following two days of
polling which ended last night at
midnight.
The amendment failed to get
its required two-thirds vote and
fell just shy of gaining a majority.
The Balanced Funding Deal,
which would have eliminated the
fee refund and split graduate and
undergraduate fees, unofficially
garnered support by 49.7 percent
of the voters. The returns will be
finalized this afternoon, said Elec
tion Commissioner Jonathan
Be rent.
"The election results have sent
a decisive message to the senate,"
said undergraduate senator
Andre Vanier, one of the chief op
ponents. "The student body
wants real reform that will bene
fit all students."
While undergraduate and
graduate students both rejected

the amendment, it received more
support from undergraduates.
"Now we know how students
feel on this particular change,"
said Mork Murdock, member of
the Council of Presidents and the
prime proponent of Senate Bill
CA-1. "I'm satisfied because we
got a good voter turnout."
Murdock said the new voting
system helped lead to the nearly
25 percent voter turnout. "People
were able to vote successfully on
the World Wide Web," he said.
"Now the campus is informed
on what the current special fee
system is," said Senate Chair
Nawwar Kasrawi. "There's cer
tainly been more discussion than
ever before.
"People were given a proposal,
and they voted based on that pro
posal," he said.
Fifty-seven percent of fresh
men supported the amendment,
the most of any class. While the
bill also won a majority of sopho
mores, both juniors and seniors
