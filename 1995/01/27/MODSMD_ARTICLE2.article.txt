# 50-50 vote kills special-fee deal
## 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
Students rejected the ASSU's
controversial special-fee reform
amendment following two days of
polling which ended last night at
midnight.
The amendment failed to get
its required two-thirds vote and
fell just shy of gaining a majority.
The Balanced Funding Deal,
which would have eliminated the
fee refund and split graduate and
undergraduate fees, unofficially
garnered support by 49.7 percent
of the voters. The returns will be
finalized this afternoon, said Elec
tion Commissioner Jonathan
Be rent.
"The election results have sent
a decisive message to the senate,"
said undergraduate senator
Andre Vanier, one of the chief op
ponents. "The student body
wants real reform that will bene
fit all students."
While undergraduate and
graduate students both rejected

the amendment, it received more
support from undergraduates.
"Now we know how students
feel on this particular change,"
said Mork Murdock, member of
the Council of Presidents and the
prime proponent of Senate Bill
CA-1. "I'm satisfied because we
got a good voter turnout."
Murdock said the new voting
system helped lead to the nearly
25 percent voter turnout. "People
were able to vote successfully on
the World Wide Web," he said.
"Now the campus is informed
on what the current special fee
system is," said Senate Chair
Nawwar Kasrawi. "There's cer
tainly been more discussion than
ever before.
"People were given a proposal,
and they voted based on that pro
posal," he said.
Fifty-seven percent of fresh
men supported the amendment,
the most of any class. While the
bill also won a majority of sopho
mores, both juniors and seniors

rejected the measure, with only 41
percent of seniors supporting the
measure.
"Maybe this failed, but some
thing has to be done about
refunds," said Scott Moss, head of
the ASSU Speakers' Bureau. Moss
said the bureau received a surplus
of funds this year, because the
actual amount of fee refunds was
less than the 30 percent buffer
built into groups' budgets to
account for refunds. "We made a
windfall on the special-fee system,"

he said.
"We're disappointed, said
Stanford in Government co-chair
Susan Thomas. "We think the sys
tem is in need of reform. Its my
hope that those people in and out
of the ASSU who worked to defend
the amendment will work to put
together a better amendment.
There were some very good parts
to this amendment."
Some senators said they will
propose another reform bill to be
voted on in the May general elec
tion.
"The Students' Alliance is mak
ing it a priority to get a credible
reform on the spring ballot," said
undergraduate senator Stephen

Russell. "A new bill will have to
balance the interests of student
groups and preserve a student's
right to a fee refund."
Undergraduate senator Ed Mal
one — after reveling in the voters'
triumph over what he alleged were
People's Platform cheating tactics
such as misleading fliers — said he
is considering introducing a bill
allowing individual students to
fund only the organizations for
which they vote.
Proponents of CA-1 said they
will need to examine any new pro
posals before an endorsement can
be made. "We have to look at it
more carefully to see if it will have
any financial impact," Kasrawi
