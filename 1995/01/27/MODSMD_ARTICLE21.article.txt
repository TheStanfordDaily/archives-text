## Redemption? Men to tangle with Trojans 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Beware of Trojan Horses.
That is a phrase the Stanford's
men's basketball team will take to
heart when facing USC tomorrow
afternoon at the Los Angeles
Sports Arena
The Trojans (7-10 overall, 2-5
in the Pacific 10 Conference)
would like nothing better than to
sneak a victory away from the
17th-ranked Cardinal (12-3 over
all, 3-3 Pac-10) who suffered a
heartbreaking defeat to the bally
hooed Bruins of UCLA last night.
"UCLA was the fourth-ranked
team in a row we played, yet the
USC game is just as important,"
said Cardinal head coach Mike
Montgomery. "We're looking for
,c W"s. We need wins. The last
thing we can afford to do is play
well against UCLA and not play
well against USC. We have to be

careful of not respecting every
body or of treating one opponent
different than the other. We have
to be ready to play good basket
ball every night."
While the Trojans are not in
the league of UCLA and may
seem unimpressive at times, they
are by no means an innocuous
team. After being blown out by
California 76-58 last night, they
would love to capitalize on any
emotional drainage the Cardinal
might be feeling after its Bruins
contest.
USC features a small three
guard line up. They're tallest
starter at six-foot-seven is 1994
first-team All-Pac-10 forward
Lorenzo Orr. Orr'g explosiveness
has vaulted him to scoring and
rebounding averages of 18.8 and
7.4 respectively, both ranking
him in the conference's top ten.
