## Redemption? Men to tangle with Trojans 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Beware of Trojan Horses.
That is a phrase the Stanford's
men's basketball team will take to
heart when facing USC tomorrow
afternoon at the Los Angeles
Sports Arena
The Trojans (7-10 overall, 2-5
in the Pacific 10 Conference)
would like nothing better than to
sneak a victory away from the
17th-ranked Cardinal (12-3 over
all, 3-3 Pac-10) who suffered a
heartbreaking defeat to the bally
hooed Bruins of UCLA last night.
"UCLA was the fourth-ranked
team in a row we played, yet the
USC game is just as important,"
said Cardinal head coach Mike
Montgomery. "We're looking for
,c W"s. We need wins. The last
thing we can afford to do is play
well against UCLA and not play
well against USC. We have to be

careful of not respecting every
body or of treating one opponent
different than the other. We have
to be ready to play good basket
ball every night."
While the Trojans are not in
the league of UCLA and may
seem unimpressive at times, they
are by no means an innocuous
team. After being blown out by
California 76-58 last night, they
would love to capitalize on any
emotional drainage the Cardinal
might be feeling after its Bruins
contest.
USC features a small three
guard line up. They're tallest
starter at six-foot-seven is 1994
first-team All-Pac-10 forward
Lorenzo Orr. Orr'g explosiveness
has vaulted him to scoring and
rebounding averages of 18.8 and
7.4 respectively, both ranking
him in the conference's top ten.
His 1.3 blocks a game are also
good for fourth-best in the Pac
-10.
Orr's frontcourt mate, for
ward Jaha Wilson, measures
only 6-foot-5, but leads the Pac
-10 in rebounding with an aver
age of 10.3 boards a game. Wil
son, a sophomore, has also
demonstrated offensive flair
this season averaging 14.3 ppg.
after averaging just 3.9 as a
freshman.
The Cardinal frontline, dom
inated 50-35 on the glass last
night, won't be facing the size
that the Bruins had, but must
now compete with quickness
and tenacity.
Southern Cal standout fresh
man guard Cameron Murray
leads USC with 4.6 assists a
game. While Murray is also
averaging an impressive 2.4
steals a game as well, his back
court mate Stais Boseman is the
Trojan's most highly-acclaimed
defensive stopper. After missing
the earlier half of season due to
problems of academic eligibility,
the so-called "Man of Steal"
now leads USC with 2.9 steals a
game. Steady contributor Burt
Harris (11.3 ppg, 3.7 apg)
rounds out the lineup.
Southern Cal's shooting and
offense are suspect with Orr and
Wilson the only real offensive
threats shooting above or even
close to 50 percent. But given
the Trojans' hustle under new
coach Charlie Parker, the Cardi
nal had best be wary of what
may appear to be a gift-wrapped
win despite last year's sweep.
"Coach warned us about
USC," said Stanford forward
Darren Allaway. "USC's record
is not as good as UCLA's, but
that doesn't mean they're not
capable of beating us. We have
to be at our best against USC
also. It's not a matter of playing
a hard game Thursday night
and coming out Saturday after
noon and not playing hard. We
can't afford those lapses."
