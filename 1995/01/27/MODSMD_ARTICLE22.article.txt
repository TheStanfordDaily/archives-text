UCLA 49

With 11 minutes and 11 seconds
to go in the first half of last night's
Stanford women's basketball game,
victory was assured.
The Cardinal (15-1, 6-0 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) scored 22 of
the first 28 points en route to a 88-
49 thrashing of UCLA (7-9, 2-5).
The non-contest became so lopsided
at halftime, only one question
remained — is freshman Kristin
Folkl going to dunk?
During the 24 minutes she spent
on the court, Folkl twice had
chances to make history. The first
came when she trailed sophomore
Jamila Wideman on a breakaway
layup. On the second try, she
brought the crowd to its feet.
With 8:36 left in the game, Folkl
dribbled the ball downcourt on a
fastbreak. As she honed in on the
basket, Folkl palmed the ball for the
slam but was forced to go with the
finger roll after the UCLA defender
interceded Folkl's path to the bas
ket.
Folkl was not the only Cardinal
playing extended minutes last
night. With sophomore Kate Star
bird sitting out the game with a
pulled groin muscle, which she
aggravated during practice, many
Stanford players joined in the festiv
ities.

Wideman played her best game
of the year after starting for the sev
enth time. She scored 11 points,
dished out eight assi: ts and disrupt
ed the Bruin offense repeatedly —
especially in the first half, when she
stole the ball five times. Wideman
added another steal in the second
half to finish with six.
"She really disrupted her (UCLA
guard Ricarda Kuypers'] game,"
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "I
think she has excellent quickness
and I've been working with Jamila
on getting to be more aggressive
defensively."
With the double point guard
starting lineup of senior Kate Paye
and Wideman, the Cardinal looked
to pass more often early in the
game. Stanford opened with two
quick layups, one by Wideman off of
her steal. She later found junior
Bobbie Kelsey wide open for a three
pointer followed by a pass to Paye,
who drained another trey with no
Bruin defenders in sight. The easy
shots put Stanford ahead, 11-2,
with only 3:24 off the clock.
"I was really anxious about the
game because I knew that Starbird
might not be available," Van-
Derveer said. "Kate got her shots
going and Bobbie made some plays I
never thought I'd see from her."
Paye finished the game tied with
Kelsey and senior Anita Kaplan in
scoring. All three paced the team
with 14 points. Paye broke out of
her shooting slump by making five
of seven shots, three of four from
behind the arc.
The Cardinal started quickly, as
