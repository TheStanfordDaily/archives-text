# Recovering point guard proves she's back in top form
## 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
Seven months ago sophomore Jamila Wideman injured
her ankle in the final regular season women's basketball
game. Many, including Wideman, feel that she hasn't been
the same since.
But last night, in Stanford's 88-49 thrashing of the
UCLA Bruins, Wideman proved to everyone that she's
back in top form and ready to play.
With Kate Starbird, the team's leading scorer, sidelined
with a muscle pull, Stanford needed someone to step up
and pick up the 17 points and four assists per game lost
with Starbird's absence.
Wideman decided that that would be her job early in
the night, as she made her first of six steals after just three
minutes of action.
"This was Jamila's best game of the year," said Cardi
nal head coach Tara VanDerveer, on the point guard's 11
point, eight assist and six steal performance.
UCLA head coach Kathy Olivier was just as quick to
praise Wideman for her tough defense and ability to dis-

rupt the Bruin offense. "[Wide
man] showed a lot of leadership
out there tonight," Olivier said.
"She played like a senior; she
played very aggressively and
really did a good job out there."
Besides serving as the defen
sive sparkplug, Wideman provid
ed the Cardinal with something
that the team had lacked all
year—a dominant point guard
who can drive the lane.
VanDerveer felt that Wide
man's penetration was not only a
big factor in the blowout last
night, but that such play will
help the team for the rest of the

season.
"She did a great job in transi
tion, in pushing the tempo, and
in taking the ball to the basket,"
VanDerveer said. "She has been
gaining confidence and I think
her having a really good game
takes the pressure off of other
people."
One player who benefited from
Wideman's drives was senior
Kate Paye, who had 14 points,
many off of Wideman assists.
"Jamila would drive in and
then the defense would collapse
off of me, and that left me with
some open shots," Paye said.
Last night's performance
marks what Wideman hopes to
be the end of a long uphill climb
to return to the all-star level of
play she showed the basketball

world last year.
"Hopefully this was a sign
that my game is much more
aggressive, and that my confi
dence is growing," Wideman
said. "Obviously an injury
doesn't just affect you physically,
but mentally, too. And it has
been a struggle to keep it out of
my head."
VanDerveer thought last
night's victory is what Wideman
needs to get back on track and
put herself in a position to lead
the team again.
"She's been off for seven
months and that definitely has
showed," said the coach. "But I
think tonight will go a long way
in helping her with her confi
dence and helping me with my
confidence in her."

With a boost in confidence,
VanDerveer hopes Wideman will
become more aggressive and
return to the feisty style of play
that characterizes the 5-foot-6
guard.
"I think she has excellent
quickness and I've been working
with Jamila on being more
aggressive defensively — to get
her hands more active," Van-
Derveer said. "She has got to be
someone who gets under a play
er's skin, who gets right into
them and takes the ball away
from them."
Wideman, who says she is now
at 100 percent, collected her first
Bruin skin of the season last
night, and hopes to collect many
more before the vear is over.
