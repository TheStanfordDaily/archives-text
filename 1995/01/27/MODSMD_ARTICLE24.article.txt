# No. 1 baseball to open season against Gaels
## Experienced team out to defend Six-Pac title

Offense wins games. Defense wins
championships.
The Stanford baseball team hopes to
ride that philosophy all the way to the
top in 1995. The Cardinal — ranked No.
1 in the nation by Baseball America and
College Sports Magazine — boasts one of
the best pitching staffs ever assembled
on the Farm and returns a host of expe
rienced players aiming for a trip to the
College World Series in Omaha, Neb.
Stanford begins its quest today in the
season opener against Bay Area rival St.
Mary's with the first pitch slated for 2
p.m. at Sunken Diamond. The two-game
series with the Gaels concludes Sunday,
also at home, at noon.
The Cardinal looks to defend the
Pacific 10 Southern Division (Six-Pac)
title it captured a year ago and earn a
berth in the College World Series for the
first time since 1990. Seven of the nine
starting position players and all but
three pitchers return from last year's
squad — which compiled an overall
record of 36-24 before falling to Texas
and Oklahoma in the NCAA Central
Regionals.
"We get spoiled here at Stanford,"
said head coach Mark Marquess, begin

ning his 19th year as skipper of the Car
dinal. "Last year was a darn good year
for us but we would have liked to have
gone further. Our expectation levels are
pretty high."
Pitching carried the Cardinal in 1994
all season long as the offense was unable
to click. Stanford managed a team aver
age of just .285 and produced only 45
home runs in 60 games. Couple those
statistics with the loss of the team's most
consistent offensive weapon from a year
ago, designated hitter Nate Olmstead,
and it is clear that pitching will again be
the focal point in 1995.
The entire starting rotation returns
from 1994, including a potent one-two
punch in junior Dan Reed and sopho
more Jason Middlebrook. Reed keeps
opposing batters guessing with a variety
of curves and off-speed pitches while
Middlebrook, who has been clocked at
over 95 miles-per-hour, possesses over
powering heat.
Reed was named the team MVP a sea
son ago after posting a school record
with eight conference victories and an
overall mark of 10-5. The southpaw —
one of a host of Cardinal players who
participated in the Cape Cod League
during the summer — figures to be the

today as the Cardinal baseball team opens its season
against St. Mary's.
