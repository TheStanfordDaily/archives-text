# No. 1 baseball to open season against Gaels
## Experienced team out to defend Six-Pac title

Offense wins games. Defense wins
championships.
The Stanford baseball team hopes to
ride that philosophy all the way to the
top in 1995. The Cardinal — ranked No.
1 in the nation by Baseball America and
College Sports Magazine — boasts one of
the best pitching staffs ever assembled
on the Farm and returns a host of expe
rienced players aiming for a trip to the
College World Series in Omaha, Neb.
Stanford begins its quest today in the
season opener against Bay Area rival St.
Mary's with the first pitch slated for 2
p.m. at Sunken Diamond. The two-game
series with the Gaels concludes Sunday,
also at home, at noon.
The Cardinal looks to defend the
Pacific 10 Southern Division (Six-Pac)
title it captured a year ago and earn a
berth in the College World Series for the
first time since 1990. Seven of the nine
starting position players and all but
three pitchers return from last year's
squad — which compiled an overall
record of 36-24 before falling to Texas
and Oklahoma in the NCAA Central
Regionals.
"We get spoiled here at Stanford,"
said head coach Mark Marquess, begin

ning his 19th year as skipper of the Car
dinal. "Last year was a darn good year
for us but we would have liked to have
gone further. Our expectation levels are
pretty high."
Pitching carried the Cardinal in 1994
all season long as the offense was unable
to click. Stanford managed a team aver
age of just .285 and produced only 45
home runs in 60 games. Couple those
statistics with the loss of the team's most
consistent offensive weapon from a year
ago, designated hitter Nate Olmstead,
and it is clear that pitching will again be
the focal point in 1995.
The entire starting rotation returns
from 1994, including a potent one-two
punch in junior Dan Reed and sopho
more Jason Middlebrook. Reed keeps
opposing batters guessing with a variety
of curves and off-speed pitches while
Middlebrook, who has been clocked at
over 95 miles-per-hour, possesses over
powering heat.
Reed was named the team MVP a sea
son ago after posting a school record
with eight conference victories and an
overall mark of 10-5. The southpaw —
one of a host of Cardinal players who
participated in the Cape Cod League
during the summer — figures to be the

next ace of a program that has pro
duced rmyor league stars such as
Jack McDowell and Mike Mussina.
Reed will be the Cardinal's starting
pitcher against the Gaels today.
Meanwhile, Middlebrook comes
off one of the most impressive
freshman seasons in school histo
ry, posting a 7-2 mark with a 2.54
earned run average in 1994. He
struck out 76 batters in just 71.0
innings pitched and notched a
career-high 14 strikeouts in a no
hitter against UCLA. Middlebrook,
a pre-season All-American, toured
Japan, Nicaragua and Cuba with
the U.S. National Team during the
summer.
Junior right-hander Todd Bar
tels, who started 12 games for the
Cardinal a year ago and compiled a
6-4 record, will also be returning
along with standout reliever Tom
Reimers. Reimers recorded nine

saves in 1994 arid earned honor
able mention All-Six-Pac honors as
a freshman.
Mike Robbins adds experience
to the Cardinal bullpen as a junior
while heralded freshman Kyle
Peterson could fight his way into
the starting lineup.
"The strength of our team is
pitching," said Marquess. "We
have a lot of quality arms which
allows us the luxury that if some
one stumbles we will have a capa
ble replacement ready to step in."
Whoever takes the mound for
the Cardinal in 1995 will be in good
hands with junior catcher A.J.
Hinch calling the plays from
behind the plate. Hinch, a consen
sus pre-season All-American and
three year starter, is virtually a
lock as a top pick in the June Ama
teur Drafl.
He carries a .329 career average
into 1995 while throwing out over
56 percent of opposing base-run
ners trying to steal. Hinch also
breaks the mold of the stereotypi
cal catcher, possessing great speed

which allowed him to steal 14
bases last season.
"A.J. is a very special talent,"
Marquess said. "He has all the
skills necessary to succeed on the
next level and we'll be looking for a
big year from him."
The Cardinal infield is also load
ed with plenty of talent, though the
loss of second basemen Jed Hansen
to the pros leaves a void to be filled.
Junior Brian Dallimore — a two
year starter at third — can also
play second while Steve Carver,
coming off an impressive off-sea
son, should see starting time both
at third and first base.
Carver was named the Summer
Player of the Year by Baseball
America after tearing up the
Alaskan Summer League. Carver
led his team — the Anchorage
Glacier Pilots — with a .398 aver
age, 17 home runs and 62 RBIs to
earn league MVP honors. In the
past 14 years only one winner of
the Summer Player of the Year
honor has slipped past the first
round of the draft — John Olerud,

now with the Toronto Blue Jays.
Sophomore Eric Sees, who
started the final 57 games for the
Cardinal in 1994, returns as the
starter at shortstop. Senior Dusty
Allen — a three-year starter at
first base — has been sidelined
with a broken bone in his hand
and should be out three to four
weeks. Allen is one of the Cardi
nal's strongest offensive and
defensive weapons, possessing a
.992 fielding percentage while
leading the team in RBIs the past
two seasons.
Two of the three spots in the
outfield appear to be set with
junior Cale Carter in center and
junior Brodie VanWagenen in
right. Each will begin their third
consecutive season in the starting
lineup. Both are solid hitters look
ing to improve on sub-par seasons
last year (Carter batted .276 and
VanWagenen hit just .258).
Junior Rich Crowe and sopho
more Chris Clark will likely fight
for the left field spot while fresh
men Chris Draft and Eric Wei —

both members of the Cardinal foot
ball team as well — should see
some action in the outfield.
If there is a question mark
heading into 1995 it is at the desig
nated hitter position with Mar
quess still looking to replace the
offensive production of Nate Olm
stead (a .385 hitter a year ago).
Junior Sean Flikke, along with
Jimmy Noriega, Crowe and Clark,
will all probably see action as the
DH at some point.
The Cardinal enters its 102 nd
season of collegiate baseball with a
sense of optimism not seen since
Stanford won back-to-back
National Championships in 1987
and 1988. But the Cardinal must
compete in the nation's top confer
ence, where only one team, Ari
zona, is not ranked in Collegiate
Baseball's top 40.
"To be honest, I'm not even
sure that we should be ranked No.
1 in our conference," said Mar
quess. "USC has the best offense
I've seen at this level and they are
certainly going to be tough to

beat."
The 1995 season will also usher
in a new era of Stanford baseball,
as home games will be played
under the lights at Sunken Dia
mond for the first time ever. The
addition of eight light towers
around the stadium could allow
Stanford to host the NCAA
Regionals in May. Nine games are
scheduled at night, including the
conference home opener against
arch-rival California on March 3.
Pitching should be a strong
point, but the Cardinal knows that
offensive production must improve
if Stanford is to make a serious run
at the national title. In addition,
the Cardinal played just .500 ball
against non-conference opponents
in 1994, a figure which Marquess
feels must go up — starting today.
"We need a couple of guys to
have career years if we are going to
defend our Pac-10 title," Marquess
said. "I know our guys are capable
of doing the job, so it basically
comes down to executing during
the season."
