# Men's volleyball to host UCSC, No. 4 Penn State
## 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
The Chargers and the 49ers
are not the only championship
teams going at it this weekend.
Not to be overshadowed by the
hoopla surrounding Super Bowl
Sunday, the No. 2-ranked Stan
ford men's volleyball team will try
to create a little excitement at
Burnham Pavilion this weekend
as it hosts unranked UC-Santa
Cruz on Friday night before wel
coming the defending national
champions Penn State for a 3
p.m. Saturday matinee.
Having already beaten the
Banana Slugs once this season,
the Cardinal will instead focus its
attention on the No. 4 Nittany
Lions, who were upset victors
over UCLA in the NCAA Finals
last season.
Two weeks ago at the UC-
Santa Cruz Tournament, Stan
ford bested the field and captured
the title with a 15-11, 15-11, 15-
10 victory over Santa Cruz.
This week, the Cardinal's first
string players will be given a rest
against the Banana Slugs and the
probable starters for the match
include freshmen setter Tyler
Neal, middle blocker Tad Hof-

Mann, outside hitter Devin Pool
man and middle blocker Keenan
Whitehurst.
"We're not really worried
about Santa Cruz," said middle
blocker Michael Hoefer. "I think
it's safe to say that we're definite
ly going to win that match."
The Lions, on the other hand,
pose a different sort of challenge
this weekend. Last season, the
Cardinal went 1-2 against Penn
State, squeezing in a 15-8, 16-18,
12-15, 15-5, 16-14 win between
two three-game sweeps.
Since then, the Lions have lost
the services of graduated senior
Ail-American Ramon Hernandez
and a pivotal role player in Bryan
Schneider. They will, however,
return Ail-American Ivan Contr
erez, a powerful hitter who
spends the off-season middle
blocking for the Mexican National
Team.
"He's as good as there is in the
country," said Stanford head
coach Ruben Nieves. "He's a com
plete player who blocks all around
the net, hits the quick sets, is a
good passer and finishes off the
whole package with excellent
float and jump serves."
Dishing out the sets for Contr
erez and company will be 6-foot-4
Carlos Ortiz, who runs a "very
sophisticated offense," according
to Nieves. And when Ortiz gets on
a streak, the Lions' attack is very
hard to stop.
"In all of their matches, there

comes a point when their offense
get very hot and doesn't make
any mistakes," Nieves said. "That
was UCLA's downfall [in the
NCAA Finals], but we just have
to be patient against them and
keep siding out. They are a hard
team to blow out or run away
from because they make you earn
every point."
That should not be a problem
for the second-ranked Stanford
squad â€” one which, in the past

few years, has consistently fin
ished ranked close to the top.
With All-Americans Matt
Fuerbringer and Mike Lambert
hitting from all angles on the
court and last week's All-Tourna
ment setter Stewart Chong
orchestrating the offense, the
Cardinal is looking to avenge last
year's losses against the Lions.
"We definitely have more tal
ent than them, but they have
more experience," Fuerbringer

said. "This would be a great win
to have, and we're looking for
ward to hopefully beating the
national champions."
In preparation for this week's
marquee match, Penn State par
ticipated in the Hawaii Collegiate
Classic on Wednesday and Thurs
day. As of last night, UCLA had
defeated the Lions in three
straight, 15-9, 15-11, 15-10. In
the other semi-final match, host
Hawaii ousted Loyola Mary

mount 15-9, 15-6, 15-11, so Penn
St. is set to face LMU in the con
solation match before traveling
up the coast for Saturday's game.
The last time Stanford took
the court was when it faced off
against the best in the west last
week and walked away with sec
ond place at the UC-Santa Bar
bara Tournament, after falling to
BYU in a closely-contested four
game final.
Playing against the likes of No.

1 UCLA, No. 3 USC and No. 5
Cal-State Northridge, Nieves
thinks that the tournament was
an indicator of where Stanford
stands three weeks into the sea
son.
"We proved that we were one
of the best in the country, and a
win against Penn State this week
end would just reinforce that,"
Nieves said. "The question here is
whether Penn State is up there
with us."
