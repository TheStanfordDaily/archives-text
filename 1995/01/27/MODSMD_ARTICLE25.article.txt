# Men's volleyball to host UCSC, No. 4 Penn State
## 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
The Chargers and the 49ers
are not the only championship
teams going at it this weekend.
Not to be overshadowed by the
hoopla surrounding Super Bowl
Sunday, the No. 2-ranked Stan
ford men's volleyball team will try
to create a little excitement at
Burnham Pavilion this weekend
as it hosts unranked UC-Santa
Cruz on Friday night before wel
coming the defending national
champions Penn State for a 3
p.m. Saturday matinee.
Having already beaten the
Banana Slugs once this season,
the Cardinal will instead focus its
attention on the No. 4 Nittany
Lions, who were upset victors
over UCLA in the NCAA Finals
last season.
Two weeks ago at the UC-
Santa Cruz Tournament, Stan
ford bested the field and captured
the title with a 15-11, 15-11, 15-
10 victory over Santa Cruz.
This week, the Cardinal's first
string players will be given a rest
against the Banana Slugs and the
probable starters for the match
include freshmen setter Tyler
Neal, middle blocker Tad Hof-

Mann, outside hitter Devin Pool
man and middle blocker Keenan
Whitehurst.
"We're not really worried
about Santa Cruz," said middle
blocker Michael Hoefer. "I think
it's safe to say that we're definite
ly going to win that match."
The Lions, on the other hand,
pose a different sort of challenge
this weekend. Last season, the
Cardinal went 1-2 against Penn
State, squeezing in a 15-8, 16-18,
12-15, 15-5, 16-14 win between
two three-game sweeps.
Since then, the Lions have lost
the services of graduated senior
Ail-American Ramon Hernandez
and a pivotal role player in Bryan
Schneider. They will, however,
return Ail-American Ivan Contr
erez, a powerful hitter who
spends the off-season middle
blocking for the Mexican National
Team.
"He's as good as there is in the
country," said Stanford head
coach Ruben Nieves. "He's a com
plete player who blocks all around
the net, hits the quick sets, is a
good passer and finishes off the
whole package with excellent
float and jump serves."
