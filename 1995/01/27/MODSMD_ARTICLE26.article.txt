# Season opens for men's and women's tennis
## No. 1 men will clash with USD 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
The Stanford men's tennis team
will be eager to show off its new look
— and prove that it merits its pre
season No. 1 ranking — when it
opens its 1995 season with a dual
match against the University of San
Diego.
No. 48 San Diego, who will visit
the Stanford Tennis Stadium Sat
urday, is traditionally one of the
Cardinal's first opponents of the
year and "has always given us prob
lems," according to head coach Dick
Gould.
But don't expect too much of a
contest from these unequally
matched sides. The competition will
give many of the younger Cardinal
players a chance to prove them
selves as the team graduated four
out of eight starters from last year's
squad which finished runner-up in
the NCAA championships.
Ail-Americans Michael Flana
gan, Chris Cocotos and Vimal Patel
are gone, as is Robert Devens. How
ever, they have been replaced by
players who are sure to make an
immediate impact as Stanford's
newest starters.
Making their dual-match debut
on the Stadium courts will be fresh
men Scott Humphries at No. 2 and
Paul Goldstein at No. 3. Both play
ers, widely acknowledged as two of
the top recruits in the country,
played impressively in preseason
tournaments, garnishing doubles
titles in the Rolex NorCal Champi
onships and the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Indoor Championships.
"It will be exciting to see how our
freshman adapt," Gould said.
Goldstein said he was looking
forward to his first dual match after
a long period of practice and individ
ual matches.
"We've been kicking each other's
butts in practice, and now we can
start rooting and being there for

each other as a team," Goldstein
said.
The other fresh face in the Stan
ford lineup will be Grant Elliot. The
sophomore, who played most of last
year as a starter in doubles, will
begin the season at the No. 5 spot.
Anchoring the Cardinal at No. 1
will be junior Jeff Salzenstein, who
is ranked sixth in the country. The
team captain will be moving up
from his No. 2 position of last year,
where he amassed a record of 24-4.
At No. 4 will be Jim Thomas,
whose 22-1 record in 1994 was tops
on the Cardinal. Thomas has
already gotten off to a fast start in
the preseason, toppling UCLA's
Robert Janacek, who is ranked sec
ond in the country, and Texas' Chad
Clark, the country's fifth-ranked
player.
"Jim has made a mammoth
jump," Gould said.
Rounding out the Stanford line
up at No. 6 will be another junior,

Ricky Becker. A part-time starter
throughout his career, Becker has
amassed an 18-2 record over two
years, and had very strong showings
in the preseason tournaments.
Gould is especially interested in
how his top four players perform
because their abilities are so even.
He said he will be watching careful
ly to determine how well each play
er is playing, and that exceptional
performances might merit in-sea
son lineup adjustments.
"We have four guys who look to
me like they can beat any given
player in the country on any given
day," Gould said.
Which is why pollsters think the
Cardinal will be the premier team in
the country this year. But don't tell
that to Gould or the players.
"We feel that we are only one of
the best teams in the country,"
Becker said. "This weekend's match
will show us where we are or how
far we have to go."

reason why the Cardinal tennis team is ranked No. 1.
