# UW, UNLV to challenge women
## 
### Courtney Mann Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's tennis
squad will balance the fine line
between hospitality and hostility
as it gets down to the business of
regular season dual matches this
weekend at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium.
The Cardinal will be on its best
behavior as Pacific 10 Conference
rival Washington and the Univer
sity of Nevada-Las Vegas come to
town today and Saturday, respec
tively. The game faces, however,
will appear at 1:30 p.m. on both
days as the preseason No. 3 squad
bite the courts for the first time
as a cohesive unit
The format of dual matches
involves nine total contests, six
singles and three doubles. The
winner of five of those matches
takes the day's competition.
After an impressive preseason
schedule featuring AU-American
Katie Schlukebir, seasoned veter
an Kim Shasby, and freshmen
Ania Bleszynski and Julie Scott,
the squad looks to continue that
success of depth during the long
dual-match season.
Schlukebir and Bleszynski will
most likely continue to play up
with the country's top talent as
they did in the top flight of last
weekend's Pac-10 Indoor Cham
pionships in Seattle. Shasby,
Scott, and sophomore Sandra De
Silva, all of whom played
extremely solid tenhi3 up north,
will also take on large roles in the
singles competition this weekend.
Doubles play will feature the
pairing up of Schlukebir and
Bleszynski, a team that first
played together after Bleszynski's
title at the Rolex Championships
in November. Sophomore Emily
Burt will make her appearance in
the doubles competition, playing
alongside Shasby.

The third duo will consist of
Scott and senior Amy Chiminello.
Head coach Frank Brennan lias
decided to rest Chiminello in the
singles play on Friday so that she
can beat full strength in both sin
gles and doubles on Saturday.
The Washington squad visits
Stanford on Friday after hosting
last weekend's festivities in Seat
tle. Washington senior Lisa Proc
tor won her first-round match in
the top flight of last weekend's
tournament, only to meet eventu
al champion Keri Phebus in the
second round.
Senior Kim Frost was the only
other Husky to execute a noncon
solation victory in the second
flight, who Shasby had put under
her belt by the end of the week
end. Stanford's Scott actually dis
posed of Washington's Karin
Costi in third flight's opening
round. Washington did not
advance past the first round in
doubles either.
"Washington has gotten bet
ter but they're not yet of the cal
iber of the other Southern Pac-10
teams," Brennan said.
The Cardinal has seen much
leas in the recent past of its Sat
urday opponent, the Runnin'
Rebels. UNLVs team consists of
six players born outside of the
United States, led by Marianne
Vallin from Kungsangen, Swe
den, who cracked the preseason
rankings at No. 24.
UNLV dominated their only
competition of the 1995 season,
manhandling UC-Riverside last
weekend at home. The Rebels
racked up 13 victories over a two
day span and lost none.
Brennan warns not to under
estimate UNLV because of their
seeming obscurity. "We saw them
last year and that's it," Brennan
said. "It's a big world out there.
They pick up girls and you just
don't know how good they are."
