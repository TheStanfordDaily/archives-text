# BFD not first ASSU reform to fail
## 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
As students rejected a proposed con
stitutional amendment to alter the ASSU
special-fee system, supporters of CA-1
learned that history often repeats itself.
In the past 20 years of ASSU politics,
plans to restructure Stanford's student
government have come and gone regular
ly — with some of the most sweeping pro
posals suffering the same fate as CA-1 d id
last night.
These amendments have included two

proposals to establish districts for under
graduate senate seats, two plans to elimi
nate fee refunds and four attempts dur
ing the 1980s to establish a "capital fee"
to go along with the present special and
general fees. The capital fee would have
allowed the ASSU to finance larger pro
jects such as buildings and recreational
facilities.
And although 20 of the 53 amend
ments to the ASSU Constitution which
have reached the students since 1975
have been approved, last night's verdict
follows in a long line of failed reform

packages.
Amendments which have passed the
students have tended to be more proce
dural, rather than omnibus packages like
CA-1.
For example, in 1990 an amendment
passed to index the general fees to infla
tion. In 1978, a proposal passed to exempt
overseas students from paying special
fees.
While some substantive proposals
have passed the student body, they have

been few and far between.
In 1982, a constitutional amend
ment required students to vote in
the spring election in order to obtain
fee refunds the following year. That
part of the constitution was repealed
by another amendment which
passed just two years ago.
But most of the bills which have
been incorporated into the constitu
tion over the past 20 years are small
er in their scope — such as then

graduate senator Sanford Dickert's
amendment, which passed last year,
requiring senators to wear a sweat
shirt uniform on days when ASSU
Senate meetings take place.
In that same election, a proposal
which would have split the 20
undergraduate senate seats into six
geographical and four class-based
districts, replacing the current at
large system, went down in defeat.
This year's amendment focused
on correcting problems with the
special-fee system, highlighted last
year when graduate students
requested refunds en masse, lead
ing to refund rates which in some

cases exceeded 30 percent.
In that vein the ASSU has also
had its share of fickle luck — with
the most notable failures coming
on controversial, comprehensive
bills like CA-1 which proposed
changes ranging from increasing
senate power over the fees process
to eliminating refunds altogether.
In 1986, senators went so far as
to propose an entirely new consti
tution. That too failed.
And as last night's election
proved, students do not appear
ready to work toward bettering the
ASSU's 38 percent success rate
with constitutional amendments.
