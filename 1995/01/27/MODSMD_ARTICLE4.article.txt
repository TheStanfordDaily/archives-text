# Russian round table
## Russo-American panel addresses Chechnya crisis, options 
### Gabriela Teodorescu 
About 130 people sat spellbound yesterday as
a Russian lawmaker described the horrors of a
besieged Chechnya.
"Grozny was terrifying," said Parliament
Deputy Kara-Kys Arakchaa. "I saw a basement
where, for three weeks, many people — including
a 25-day-old infant, a wounded child and many
old women — were living. They did not under
stand why their civilian lives were threatened
every day."
Arakchaa, who visited Chechnya just a few
weeks ago, participated in a nine-member panel
of Russians and Americans who analyzed the cur
rent crisis in Chechnya yesterday.

The round-table discussion, entitled "The
Chechnya Crisis: Causes and Consequences,"
began with an exposition of the pre-crisis situa
tion between Russia and the Chechen Republic,
which has considered itself an autonomous re
public since 1991.
While Chechnya's contention did cause ten
sion with the Russian government, it never
reached a point of out-and-out conflict until Rus
sia invaded on Dec. 11,1994.
"It is difficult to say that a point of no return
was ever reached which made such a show of
force necessary," said Prof. Gail Lapidus, senior
fellow at the Stanford Institute for International
Studies.
"Offers by other leaders from within the Russ

ian Federation, from within the (Commonwealth
of Independent States) or from the international
community were all rejected by (Russian Presi
dent Boris) Yeltsin before the crisis broke out,"
she said.
The panel also debated who is to blame for
the Chechen crisis. "The (Russian) Security
Council chose to send in the troops and thus the
decision was made," said Valery Shamshurov,
deputy minister of nationality and regional pol
icy for the Russian Federation. In rebuttal,
some members of the panel questioned the le
gitimacy of the Russian Security Council, since
it is not an elected body.
