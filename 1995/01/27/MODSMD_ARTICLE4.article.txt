# Russian round table
## Russo-American panel addresses Chechnya crisis, options 
### Gabriela Teodorescu 
About 130 people sat spellbound yesterday as
a Russian lawmaker described the horrors of a
besieged Chechnya.
"Grozny was terrifying," said Parliament
Deputy Kara-Kys Arakchaa. "I saw a basement
where, for three weeks, many people — including
a 25-day-old infant, a wounded child and many
old women — were living. They did not under
stand why their civilian lives were threatened
every day."
Arakchaa, who visited Chechnya just a few
weeks ago, participated in a nine-member panel
of Russians and Americans who analyzed the cur
rent crisis in Chechnya yesterday.

The round-table discussion, entitled "The
Chechnya Crisis: Causes and Consequences,"
began with an exposition of the pre-crisis situa
tion between Russia and the Chechen Republic,
which has considered itself an autonomous re
public since 1991.
While Chechnya's contention did cause ten
sion with the Russian government, it never
reached a point of out-and-out conflict until Rus
sia invaded on Dec. 11,1994.
"It is difficult to say that a point of no return
was ever reached which made such a show of
force necessary," said Prof. Gail Lapidus, senior
fellow at the Stanford Institute for International
Studies.
"Offers by other leaders from within the Russ

ian Federation, from within the (Commonwealth
of Independent States) or from the international
community were all rejected by (Russian Presi
dent Boris) Yeltsin before the crisis broke out,"
she said.
The panel also debated who is to blame for
the Chechen crisis. "The (Russian) Security
Council chose to send in the troops and thus the
decision was made," said Valery Shamshurov,
deputy minister of nationality and regional pol
icy for the Russian Federation. In rebuttal,
some members of the panel questioned the le
gitimacy of the Russian Security Council, since
it is not an elected body.
Although the panel did not come
to any conclusions on the causes of
the Chechnya crisis, its members
insisted that when the crisis broke
out the peaceful means of resolu
tion had certainly not been
exhausted.
Moving on to consequences of
the crisis, the panel chose to focus
largely on domestic results.
"The problem, now and after
this crisis in Russia, is that the posi
tion of the democrats as a result of
this crisis has been weakened," said
Leokadia Drobizheva, project direc
tor at the Institute of Ethnology

and Anthropology at the Russian
Academy of Sciences.
Some positive results, however,
have resulted from the war, she
said. "This crisis has not brought
out actions on a massive scale by
the fascist forces, which we count as
very positive consequence."
The round table discussion
ended on a positive note, as Prof.
Emeritus Alexander Dallin said,
"We can at least be thankful that
Russians and Americans can meet
and talk about such topics. Hope
fully, we will meet under happier
circumstances next time."
The discussion was sponsored by
the Center for International Securi
ty and Arms Control and the Cen
ter for Russian and East European
Studies.
