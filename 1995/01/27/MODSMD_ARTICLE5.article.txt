Think you have an interesting resume? How
would you feel about working for one of the most
ruthless and oppressive leaders of the 20th century?
Recounting his unique experiences that span al
most 80 years, Stalin's translator and close aide
Valentin M. Berezhkov spoke yesterday before a
crowd of about 50 at the Hoover Institution.
Introduced as a person present at pivotal negotia
tions between world leaders before and during World
War 11, Berezhkov spoke of the upcoming 50th an
niversary of the Yalta Conference.
He took the opportunity to speak on "the mythol
ogy of Yalta" and how some historians view the con
ference as the point where the "partitioning of Eu
rope" took place and the Western Allies capitulated to
Stalin's demands.
Berezhkov, however, said plans to divide Europe
were actively traded between the Allies well before
the Yalta conference. He told of one confidential
meeting when Churchill came to Moscow to see Stal
in.
"In 1944, Churchill proposed the division of Eu
rope into spheres of influence under a percentage
plan, say, where the Soviets would control 90 percent
of Romania and the British would hold 10 [percent],"
Berezhkov said. "The Americans had no idea this
plan existed and were effectively cut off from this

power-sharing arrangement."
Stalin did not quite know what
to make of the plan said
Berezhkov. In the end, the "piece
of paper" that detailed the English
proposal was folded back up Into
Churchill's pocket and never seen
again.
"Stalin wanted to inform Roo
sevelt of what had happened
He trusted Roosevelt, but not Tru
man," said Berezhkov. "He
thought Truman would take
advantage of the situation. He
thought he would let [Europe] fight
until it was exhausted and then
come in and make peace on terms
favorable to the Americans," he
added.
Berezhkov described Stalin as a
"cruel and dangerous man" who
"exterminated" his political oppo
nents without mercy. He even had
members of his own family arrest
ed and shot, said Berezhkov.
While Stalin was certainly "a
bloody monster," he could also be
cordial and charming. Berezhkov

remembered the first time Stalin
and Roosevelt met, just before the
Teheran Conference in 1943.
"[Stalin] arrived early so he
could get the seat facing away from
the window. He did not want the
sunlight to shine directly on his
face," said Berezhkov. "Since he
smoked a lot and had a dark, dirty
complexion, he did not want to
make a bad impression on Roo
sevelt. ... All the official portraits
had been touched up to make him
look better," he said.
Berezhkov also participated in
negotiations that led to the signing
of the 1939 German-Soviet non
aggression pact. That treaty
cleared the way for the invasion of
Poland by Hitler.
Originally, Berezhkov said, the
Germans had encouraged the Sovi
ets to ally themselves with the Axis
powers. But Stalin and Soviet for
eign minister V.M. Molotov com
plained about the German's anti
communist rhetoric.
"So they renegotiated the word
ing of the pact, from being against
communism to being against [colo
nial] imperialism," said
Berezhkov.
Berezhkov also spoke about the

legacy of Yalta and the situation in
Russia today.
"The legacy of Yalta is coopera
tion, that both sides could come
together and agree," said
Berezhkov. He cited the agreement
on establishing the United Nations
as the best example of this long
term accord.
Berezhkov also talked about the
situation in the break-away Rus
sian republic of Chechnya. He pro
posed an analogy, asking what
Americans would do if the coun
try's Native American population
armed themselves, smuggled drugs
and disobeyed the laws of the Fed
eral government.
"The war is complex and con
fusing. There are over 60 national
ities in Russia. If each one were to
declare independence, then the
only thing that would be left would
be a core state surrounding
Moscow," he said.
The conflict, Berezhkov said,
"at least sends a sobering message
to other ethnic leaders" who are
intent on succeeding.
Berezhkov is currently
researching a book at Hoover and
has just published At Stalin's Side,
a book on his life with the dictator.
