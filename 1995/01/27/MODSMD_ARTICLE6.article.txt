# Men's hoops suffers narrow loss to UCLA
## No.4 Bruins edge out Cardinal 77-74 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
There was action, drama and a
whole lot of suspense. There was
even a chase scene and a come
back. The Stanford men's basket
ball team was about to take show
biz by storm.
But in the fashion of most
things in Los Angeles, things were
too good to be true. After rallying
from a 14-point halftime deficit to
lead by one with one minute,
seven seconds left in the game, de
feat was snatched from the jaws of
victory as 17th-ranked Stanford
(12-3 overall, 3-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) fell 74-77 to the fourth
ranked UCLA Bruins (12-1 over
all, 6-1 Pac-10) in the house that
Wooden built.
"It is awfully disappointing to

have that kind of opportunity to
win here and not get it done," said
Cardinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We had some chances at
the end to make a difference, but
we couldn't execute. But as far as
putting it on the line, we played
with a lot of heart."
And Hollywood does indeed
love heart. On a night when not
too much went the Cardinal's
way, Stanford nearly beat the
odds. The Bruins essentially had a
16-point headstart, five Cardinal
players eventually fouled out,
Stanford's foul-shooting was an
uncharacteristically low 65.5 per
cent, the rebounding margin fa
vored UCLA 50-35, and John
Wooden was in the house. Yet
when all was said and done,
Earvin Johnson might not have
been the only person in Pauley
Pavilion worthy of the title "Magic."
In the first half though, senior
Bruin point guard Tyus Edney
orchestrated all of the Showtime. In
what was expected to be a classic
match-up between Edney and Stan
ford's sophomore point guard
Brevin Knight, Edney proved that
although Knight has been called a
future version of Edney, the future
is not yet here.
"I didn't play my game from the
beginning," said Knight. "I let him
dictate what he wanted to do, and
didn't put any pressure on him. He
showed why he's the best hi the
country."
Edney scored the game's first
bucket with a whirling jumpshot in
the lane, and his 15-foot baseline
jumper, plus the foul, put the Bru
ins up by 16 with 9:10 left in the
first half. The rest of the Bruin
offensive machine was hitting on all
cylinders too. Forward Charles
O'Bannon was throwing down
alley-oop dunks, his brother All-
Pac-10 forward Ed was draining
turnarounds, and when center
George Zidek wasn't looping in
hook shots, he was drilling treys.
The UCLA juggernaught was pan
caking a Cardinal team that simply
appeared flat.
"It wasn't what we were capable
of doing," said Montgomery. "All I
said was let's play like the team we
are."
If not for Cardinal guard Dion
Cross's 12 points and forward Andy
Poppink's 11 points and five boards,
Steve Urkel's horrid display of
shooting during halftime might
have been all that was left for fans.
But with all eyes watching,
Knight, who had been all too quiet
in the first half with no points, no
assists and two turnovers, decided
enough was enough. Knight had 12
points and five assists in the second
half to show that while he may not
be Edney at the moment, he could
very well surpass Edney in the
future.

"In the second half, I was just
going to play how Brevin plays, and
let everything come to me. There
was no way I was going to embar
rass myself in UCLA," Knight said.
In what would have been awe
some irony, Knight and the Cardi
nal nearly ended up embarrassing
UCLA. Knight's driving lay-in
between two defenders closed the
UCI.A lead to three. Then, with two
foul shots, Knight brought the Car
dinal to within one midway through
the second half. For nearly nine
minutes, the two teams battled back
and forth. This would, of course, be
the token chase scene, a nail-biting
ride worthy of any quality flick.
The Cardinal drew to within one
on four occasions, but never caught
up. That is until Cross drilled a
three-pointer with 67 seconds left to
make the score 74-73, Cardinal.

"That was a big shot," Cross
said. "I think that was a confidence
booster. Everyone was hyped. We
thought we were going to win the
game."
Two Zidek free throws put the
Bruins in front again by one. Stan
ford had a pulse-racing 45 seconds
to topple the Pac-10 giant. Then,
with three Cardinal players already
fouled out, Darren Allaway, Pop
pink, and Tim Young, Stanford
swingman David Harbour was the
official's next victim, called for a
charge with 32 seconds left.
Sent to the line by a Knight foul,
Edney made two more free throws,
and the now Knight-less Cardinal
had 14 desperate seconds to gener
ate three points. After a timeout,
Stanford looked to open up Cross,
who at that point was four-for-five
from three-point range in the sec

ond half, for the tying bucket. The
Bruins, though, would allow no
such last-minute heroics, smother
ing the Cardinal sharpshooter and
forcing him to put up a blank.
"It really wasn't even a look,"
said Cross, who led all players with
24 points. "They knew we needed a
three to tie. Both post guys just left
their men, so I really didn't have a
clean look at it."
With the final buzzer sounding,
what would have been a wonderful
success story turned out to be
another gut-wrenching loss. But in
Hollywood, there's always a highly
anticipated sequel.
"In the (last half], you saw the
real Stanford basketball team,"
Knight said. "Once we put that
together, then we'll show you how
good we really are."
Can't wait.

together, then we'll show you how
good we really are."
Can't wait.

There was action, drama and a
whole lot of suspense. There was
even a chase scene and a come
back. The Stanford men's basket
ball team was about to take show
biz by storm.
But in the fashion of most
things in Los Angeles, things were
too good to be true. After rallying
from a 14-point halftime deficit to
lead by one with one minute,
seven seconds left in the game, de
feat was snatched from the jaws of
victory as 17th-ranked Stanford
(12-3 overall, 3-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) fell 74-77 to the fourth
ranked UCLA Bruins (12-1 over
all, 6-1 Pac-10) in the house that
Wooden built.
"It is awfully disappointing to

have that kind of opportunity to
win here and not get it done," said
Cardinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We had some chances at
the end to make a difference, but
we couldn't execute. But as far as
putting it on the line, we played
with a lot of heart."
And Hollywood does indeed
love heart. On a night when not
too much went the Cardinal's
way, Stanford nearly beat the
odds. The Bruins essentially had a
16-point headstart, five Cardinal
players eventually fouled out,
Stanford's foul-shooting was an
uncharacteristically low 65.5 per
cent, the rebounding margin fa
vored UCLA 50-35, and John
Wooden was in the house. Yet
when all was said and done,
Earvin Johnson might not have
been the only person in Pauley
Pavilion worthy of the title "Magic."
In the first half though, senior
Bruin point guard Tyus Edney
orchestrated all of the Showtime. In
what was expected to be a classic
match-up between Edney and Stan
ford's sophomore point guard
Brevin Knight, Edney proved that
although Knight has been called a
future version of Edney, the future
is not yet here.
"I didn't play my game from the
beginning," said Knight. "I let him
dictate what he wanted to do, and
didn't put any pressure on him. He
showed why he's the best hi the
country."
Edney scored the game's first
bucket with a whirling jumpshot in
the lane, and his 15-foot baseline
jumper, plus the foul, put the Bru
ins up by 16 with 9:10 left in the
first half. The rest of the Bruin
offensive machine was hitting on all
cylinders too. Forward Charles
O'Bannon was throwing down
alley-oop dunks, his brother All-
Pac-10 forward Ed was draining
turnarounds, and when center
George Zidek wasn't looping in
hook shots, he was drilling treys.
The UCLA juggernaught was pan
caking a Cardinal team that simply
appeared flat.
"It wasn't what we were capable
of doing," said Montgomery. "All I
said was let's play like the team we
are."
If not for Cardinal guard Dion
Cross's 12 points and forward Andy
Poppink's 11 points and five boards,
Steve Urkel's horrid display of
shooting during halftime might
have been all that was left for fans.
But with all eyes watching,
Knight, who had been all too quiet
in the first half with no points, no
assists and two turnovers, decided
enough was enough. Knight had 12
points and five assists in the second
half to show that while he may not
be Edney at the moment, he could
very well surpass Edney in the
future.

"In the second half, I was just
going to play how Brevin plays, and
let everything come to me. There
was no way I was going to embar
rass myself in UCLA," Knight said.
In what would have been awe
some irony, Knight and the Cardi
nal nearly ended up embarrassing
UCLA. Knight's driving lay-in
between two defenders closed the
UCI.A lead to three. Then, with two
foul shots, Knight brought the Car
dinal to within one midway through
the second half. For nearly nine
minutes, the two teams battled back
and forth. This would, of course, be
the token chase scene, a nail-biting
ride worthy of any quality flick.
The Cardinal drew to within one
on four occasions, but never caught
up. That is until Cross drilled a
three-pointer with 67 seconds left to
make the score 74-73, Cardinal.

"That was a big shot," Cross
said. "I think that was a confidence
booster. Everyone was hyped. We
thought we were going to win the
game."
Two Zidek free throws put the
Bruins in front again by one. Stan
ford had a pulse-racing 45 seconds
to topple the Pac-10 giant. Then,
with three Cardinal players already
fouled out, Darren Allaway, Pop
pink, and Tim Young, Stanford
swingman David Harbour was the
official's next victim, called for a
charge with 32 seconds left.
Sent to the line by a Knight foul,
Edney made two more free throws,
and the now Knight-less Cardinal
had 14 desperate seconds to gener
ate three points. After a timeout,
Stanford looked to open up Cross,
who at that point was four-for-five
from three-point range in the sec

ond half, for the tying bucket. The
Bruins, though, would allow no
such last-minute heroics, smother
ing the Cardinal sharpshooter and
forcing him to put up a blank.
"It really wasn't even a look,"
said Cross, who led all players with
24 points. "They knew we needed a
three to tie. Both post guys just left
their men, so I really didn't have a
clean look at it."
With the final buzzer sounding,
what would have been a wonderful
success story turned out to be
another gut-wrenching loss. But in
Hollywood, there's always a highly
anticipated sequel.
"In the (last half], you saw the
real Stanford basketball team,"
Knight said. "Once we put that
together, then we'll show you how
good we really are."
Can't wait.
