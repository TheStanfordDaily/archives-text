# New Mem Aud booth hosts visitors, tours

A new visitor's information cen
ter in Memorial Auditorium
opened Jan. 16, replacing the old
booth in the Main Quad, which will
be torn down for earthquake retro
fitting.
The new booth will dispense
campus information to visitors and
will eventually become a full-service
center like the one in Tresidder
Union, said Lawrence Davidson, as
sociate director of Stanford Events.
Campus tours will now start
near the fountain in front of
Memorial Auditorium. Hoover
Tower tours, however, will still
begin in the lobby of the tower.

The information booth was
moved from the Quad because "it
was too small — there was only
enough room for one person — and
it had a bad location," Davidson
said.
Despite the fact that the new lo
cation will not be as close to the
Main Quad as the previous site,
Davidson said that "the Memorial
Auditorium location is better be
cause it has better access for visi
tors, restrooms, an identifiable
landmark in front of it — the foun
tain — a big lobby area" and has
been combined with the Guide Ser
vice's administrative office.
The new site is also wheel-chair
accessible, is close to the food ser
vice located in the Graduate
School of Business and is near a
large visitor parking lot and two
bus stops, Davidson added.
Original plans called for the old
booth to be transformed into a
non-staffed kiosk containing a
campus map and handouts with
information about campus. The
University, however, has now
decided to tear the booth down as
part of its earthquake retrofitting
program, Davidson said.
Davidson said the University
might rebuild the old booth but
plans are not certain at this time.
The new information center
will be headed by Lynn Moeller,
who will be based in Memorial
Auditorium, and will be staffed by
an assistant and a student infor
mation guide.
