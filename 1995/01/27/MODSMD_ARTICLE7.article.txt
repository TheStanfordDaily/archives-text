A new visitor's information cen
ter in Memorial Auditorium
opened Jan. 16, replacing the old
booth in the Main Quad, which will
be torn down for earthquake retro
fitting.
The new booth will dispense
campus information to visitors and
will eventually become a full-service
center like the one in Tresidder
Union, said Lawrence Davidson, as
sociate director of Stanford Events.
Campus tours will now start
near the fountain in front of
Memorial Auditorium. Hoover
Tower tours, however, will still
begin in the lobby of the tower.

The information booth was
moved from the Quad because "it
was too small — there was only
enough room for one person — and
it had a bad location," Davidson
said.
Despite the fact that the new lo
cation will not be as close to the
Main Quad as the previous site,
Davidson said that "the Memorial
Auditorium location is better be
cause it has better access for visi
tors, restrooms, an identifiable
landmark in front of it — the foun
tain — a big lobby area" and has
been combined with the Guide Ser
vice's administrative office.
The new site is also wheel-chair
accessible, is close to the food ser
