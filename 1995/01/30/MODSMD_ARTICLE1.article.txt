How do you thank two individu
als who have worked to rescue the
world from environmental de
struction, population growth,
species extinction and nuclear
weapons?
The Heinz Family Foundation
discovered a way by awarding the
husband-and-wife team of Stan
ford Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich
and Biology Scientist Anne
Ehrlich $250,000 for their envi
ronmental work — making them
the recipients of one of the largest
individual awards given in the
United States.
Established in memory of
Pennsylvania Sen. John Heinz,
who died in a 1991 plane crash, the
prize is awarded in five categories:
public nolicy, technology, the envi-
ronment, the arts and humanities
and the human condition.
The award "was created for peo
ple who have shown excellence,
perseverance, determination, (and]
concern for humanity," said Russ
Martz, a public relations represen
tative for the foundation.
At the Center for Conservation

Biology in the Department of Bio
logical Sciences, the Ehrlichs study
the "interactions between ecology
and economics" and examine "the
waterfront of the human predica
ment," Paul Ehrlich said.
The Ehrlichs won their Heinz
award in the environmental cate
gory. "Their careers have spanned
easily 20 to 25 years," Martz said.
"They have alerted the world to
problems, have taken risks and
have stuck with it."
Because the foundation does not

restrict the use of the prize money,
the Ehrlichs have chosen to donate
a portion of their money to support
ecological centers in the Rocky
Mountains and in Costa Rica, Paul
Ehrlich said. The rest will go to
their continued research.
"As we reach retirement age, [the
prize] allows us to continue our
research," he said. But he made sure
to add that he and his wife are "not
about to retire and leave Stanford."
The Ehrlichs' massive body of
work includes research into popu

lation growth, resource depletion,
species extinction, global wanning
and nuclear threats.
They have published such well
known books as "The Population
Bomb," "Healing the Planet" and
"The Population Explosion."
Their next book — not yet
released — is titled "The Stork and
the Plow," and was written in con
junction with Dr. Gretchen Daily of
UC-Berkeley. The book explores
issues of gender, equality and
world hunger.
