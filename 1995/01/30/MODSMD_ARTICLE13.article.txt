## Renewed border conflict heats up in Peru, Ecuador 
### 
MAC AS, Ecuador (AP) â€” Two
Peruvian helicopters were report
edly shot down yesterday, killing
seven Peruvians, as Ecuadorean
officials accused Peru of mounting
a "massive offensive" along a dis
puted border.
A Ecuadorean Joint Chiefs of
Staff communique reporting the
first helicopter downing said that
one Ecuadorean had been been
killed and another wounded yester
day in the fourth day of border
clashes.
Defense Ministry spokesman
Col. Alberto Molina said that two
Peruvians were captured when the
second helicopter was downed.
Ecuadorean field commanders
reported 23 soldiers on both sides
killed Saturday.
Peruvian officials did not com

ment on the fighting yesterday, nor
have they given any casualty fig
ures.
The fighting centered on a dis
puted 50-mile unmarked stretch of
their 1,000-mile border, the
Cordillera del Condor. The area was
the site of bloody clashes in 1981.
Yesterday was the 53rd anniver
sai7 of the signing of the Rio Pro
tocol that ended a 1941 war
between Ecuador and Peru over
the entire border. Ecuador con
tends it lost almost half its territo
ry with the signing of the protocol,
and it later declared the territorial
limits set by the agreement to be
void.
Peru and Ecuador each contend
that the present skirmishes are tak
ing place on its own territory, and
therefore in defense of its own

sovereignty.
The Ecuadorean military com
mand in Quito said Peruvian forces
attacked bases at Soldado Monge,
Teniente Hugo Ortiz, Coangos and
Cueva de los Tayos with planes,
helicopters and mortars yesterday
morning.
The Ecuadorean army and air
force were "fighting to repel the
attack," the communique said.
Molina said yesterday evening that
Ecuadorean army fliers had
bombed a base at Pachacutec,
"which is in our territory."
Peruvian radio reported that a
squadron of air force Mirage jets
had taken off from the northern
city of Piura in the direction of the
conflict and that other pilots were
strapped into their planes, awaiting
flying orders.
