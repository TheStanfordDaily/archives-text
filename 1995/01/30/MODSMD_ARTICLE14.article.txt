# Republicans criticize Mexican-aid plan

WASHINGTON (AP) - The administra
tion's rescue package for Mexico is headed for
defeat because President Clinton has failed to
exert the personal leadership needed to convince
Congress, Sen. Phil Gramm said yesterday.
"We're seeing a real failure of presidential
leadership and I think a lot of Americans are
going to lose their jobs as a result," the Texas
Republican said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
The administration is pressing Congress to
approve $40 billion in loan guarantees to help
Mexico out of a currency crisis that has resulted
in the peso's dropping 40 percent in value com
pared to the dollar over the past month.
In the last week, Clinton has plugged his res
cue plan repeatedly in speeches and interviews,
and dispatched senior officials, including Secre

tary of State Warren Christopher, Treasury Sec
retary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve Chair
man Alan Greenspan, to testify at congressional
hearings.
But many lawmakers have remained unim
pressed, charging that the plan does not provide
adequate collateral or that conditions should be
attached committing Mexico to improved labor,
environment or immigrant control policies.
Gramm is running for the 1996 Republican
presidential nomination and is quick to criticize
Clinton, but Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn of Geor
gia, who also appeared on NBC, agreed that Clin
ton needs to do more.
"The president and his team of people have to
convince the Congress of what will happen if we
don't do it,"he said. "There has to be a better

case made on substance."
Nunn said he himself is "open to persuasion"
but that winning congressional approval will be
tough.
"It's not going to be popular. Anyone voting
for it is going to have to hold their nose because
this is not what the public wants out there, but
neither does the public want a financial debacle
south of our border with tens of thousands, per
haps hundreds of thousands of immigrants com
ing across the borders," he said.
Republican leaders, including House Speaker
Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole, have both indicated their support for the
plan but said the president needs to become more
actively involved, and get the Democratic leader
ship on board, before the package can pass.
