JERUSALEM CAP) â€” Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin told his
Cabinet yesterday that Islamic ter
rorism has put peace with the
Palestinians at a crossroads.
Israel's fears of terrorism were
underlined by a controversial deci
sion to station dogs at West B<uik
crossings.
The Cabinet extended the clo
sure of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip for at least another week, say
ing it would be removed only if the
Palestinian Authority took steps
against Islamic militants.
"Terrorism has become a strate
gic danger and a danger to the peace
process," said Rabin, quoted by
Israel Radio.
The Cabinet approved the clo

sure last week in response to
attacks that have killed 54 people
since Oct. 1, including 21 Israelis
who died in a suicide bombing Jan.
22. The measure is intended to stop
guerrillas from infiltrating Israel.
PLO officials said suffering
would only increase if tens of thou
sands of Palestinians were kept
from jobs in Israel.
"I don't think that the closure, a
separation of this kind, will solve
the problem and give security to the
Israelis," Sufian Abu Zaide, a mem
ber of the Palestinian self-rule
authority.
Police Minister Moshe Shahal
said he ordered the stationing of
police dogs to be used in tracking
infiltrators and finding explosives.
