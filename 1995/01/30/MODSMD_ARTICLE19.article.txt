New plan for reforming
special-fee system must
leave power with voters

Last week, students
soundly rejected the Balanced
Funding Deal, a proposed
amendment to the ASSU Constitu
tion that would have made several
sweeping changes in the ASSU spe
cial-fee system.
The proposed amendment would
have split the fee system into gradu
ate and undergraduate divisions,
eliminated fee refunds and limited
the amount of fees the senate could
place on the ballot. As presented on
the ballot, the proposed amendment
contained serious flaws that justified
students' rejection of the plan.
It would be a shame, however, if
student leaders took this result as a
mandate against change. The ASSU
fee system is fraught with problems,
and the time is ripe for reform, espe
cially given students' heightened
interest in the fee system: the pro
posed amendment sparked a good
deal of discussion and debate on
campus, and it gained the approval
of more than 1,700 voters.
Undoubtedly, an even greater num
ber of students would be willing to
support a more carefully crafted
proposal.
Students often fail to recognize
the benefits, tangible and intangible,
that they receive from student orga
nizations who depend on ASSU fees.
Any plan for fee reform should
ensure that students contribute
their fair share to the campus com
munity.
Would-be reformers should keep
this in mind, but in doing so they
must be careful to avoid the opposite
and more dangerous trap of losing
touch with the interests of the aver
age student. This is precisely the
error that was the downfall of the
Balanced Funding Deal.
The efforts behind the Balanced
Funding Deal were sparked in part

by last year's spring general election,
when a large number of groups
failed to receive special fees, and by a
high fee-refund rate last year that
arose from a guerrilla revolt by dis
gruntled graduate students.
The proposed amendment
focused too much on appeasing grad
uate students and ensuring that stu
dent groups could count on receiving
their fees. However, it failed to
account for the interests of the indi
vidual students who pay student fees
and the interests of the undergradu
ate students who would have borne a
large part of the fee burden.
The Balanced Funding Deal
would have given the ASSU Senate
wide discretion over which groups'
fee requests got on the ballot and
how large each group's share was.
At the same time, groups who
placed their requests on the ballot
by petition rather than by senate
action would have faced greater bar
riers to receiving fees. Under such a
system, older groups who had more
influence in the senate would have
an unfair advantage over newer
groups with less senate support.
This was the proposal's greatest
weakness.
A reform plan should not be
designed to protect student groups'
perceived claims to their fees. After
all, no student organization, no mat
ter how well-established its presence
on campus, is simply entitled to stu
dent money. As a basic tenet, a spe
cial-fee system should require each
student organization to prove its
worth to the voters each and every
year in order to receive fees.
ASSU leaders must regroup and
set to work crafting a new plan for
special-fee reform, taking a careful
look at which portions of the Bal
anced Funding Deal should be dis
carded and which might work as
part of a new plan. As they do this,
they must remember above all that
student voters — not the ASSU Sen
ate, and not student organizations,
but student voters — should have
the ultimate say in whether and how
student fees are collected and dis
tributed.
