## Is there life before death ? 
### 
A FEW YEARS ago, I was walking
by an old church covered with
more or less inventive graffiti.
Interspersed between caricatures of
Reagan and Hitler, crudely drawn peace
symbols and swastikas and a couple of
racial slurs and heavy-metal logos, an
assortment of slogans screamed: "Yan
kees out of Nicaragua!" "The Grateful
Dead live forever!" "More grilled pen
guins than bombers!" "Crusher loves
Picard!" And, finally:
"Is there life before death?"
What a stupid thing to ask, I thought.
Of course there's life before death.
Attributing the scrawled query to
semantic ineptitude or coked-up inanity,
I continued on my way, passing by a
sprayed depiction of two interlocking
ankhs with the caption "Dykes Rule."
But is the case so clear?
According to Webster, life is "the
quality that distinguishes a vital and
functional being from a dead body." Not
the most enlightening explanation one
could hope for. If one doesn't under
stand death, how can one expect to
explain life in terms of death? Old Noah
continues, "the period from birth to
death." This, at least, would seem to
indicate that there is indeed life before
death, simply by nature of the definition
of life. Again, not of terrific explanatory
force.
Another approach is apparent in
Stanford's own "Courses and Degrees"
under the course description for Com

puter Science 425, Artificial Life: "Com
putational forms of artificial life exploit
computer time to organize computer
memory in order to survive, reproduce,
evolve and learn." Inherent in this state
ment is the belief that life can be defined
functionally, in terms of survival of the
fittest, sex and knowledge acquisition,
and that the essence of life can be dis
tilled in digital form and implemented
on what to all appearances would other
wise be a pretty dead machine.
Maybe. But it sure seems like there's
more to life than what a laptop experi
ences when submitted to the tender
caresses of a recent graduate of the
CSIO6 program. One need only skip to a
further entry in Webster's collegiate edi
tion: "one or more aspects of the process
of living (sex life of the frog)." One
would hope that the frog, and indeed the
human, might experience certain things
in a slightly different manner than the
Intel inside does.
Almost at the end of Merriam and
Webster's list of vital attributes comes
an unexpected spin on the subject: "cap.,
Christian Science: GOD lb." That's it?
No further explanation? Cross-referenc
ing under GOD lb: "the incorporeal
divine Principle ruling over all as eter
nal Spirit: infinite Mind."
Whoa. Far out. But what does this
mean?
Plowing through the religious termi
nology a bit, it could mean that life is
that which gives the universe, and

therefore us, existence, and ultimately
meaning. The laws of physics, the theo
ry of evolution and modern genetics may
provide a wonderful explanation of how
life works, but perhaps they are merely
the tools of an underlying principle that
governs them and that endows them
with this elusive sense of meaning.
As Stephen Hawking puts it, "Up to
now, most scientists have been too occu
pied with the development of new theo
ries that describe what the universe is to
ask the question why." One need not be
Christian or a scientist to recognize that
the question of meaning has been left
largely unanswered or even unanalyzed
by these theories. Perhaps this is a
shortcoming of current attempts to
explain life: the emphasis is on examin
ing the superficial manifestations of life,
rather than searching for a principle
behind it.
In this context, one thing is clear.
Living as if one were executing a pro
gram, only performing the functions
required to survive and even to achieve
fleeting recognition and economic pros
perity, one chooses to lead a life as
empty as that of the word processor I'm
typing this on. Without the search for
meaning, there is truly no life, before or
after death.
