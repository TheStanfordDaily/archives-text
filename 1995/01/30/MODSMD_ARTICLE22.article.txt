Lecturer's tragic death provides a lesson for the living

I READ WITH sadness the articles on
the untimely death from lung cancer
of mechanical engineering instructor
Fritz Rinehart in The Stanford Daily of
Thursday, Jan. 26 and the Campus
Report of the day before. Although I only
knew him casually, from what I have
heard and seen on him since his death, he
is greatly missed. He was only 48 years
old and from all accounts an excellent
teacher who died in the prime of his
career and at the height of his popularity.
What the articles on Rinehart's death
did not mention was that he was an
inveterate chain-smoker. During the
many times that I saw him sitting outside

Tresidder Union, I don't think I ever saw
him without a cigarette. One cannot help
but wonder how much this contributed to
his early demise.
I wonder what it was like for him
when he was informed that he had lung
cancer and that in all probability his days
were numbered. What were his thoughts
and emotions? Did he make the connec
tion with his smoking or did he pretend
that it was coincidence? Did he flash back
to early in his life when he took a puff on
that first cigarette and wish that he had
not done so? How agonizing it must have
been for him to realize that he may well
have contributed to his predicament.

Keeping a secret of what probably con
tributed to his premature death would be
a mistake. It may even be disrespectful to
his memory to do so because if it is made
public, Rinehart will not have died in
vain. He will have served humanity even
after death. His life and the way he lived
would have much more meaning. He was
a captivating teacher who had a passion
for it and was admired by his students.
He was a creative perfectionist who
helped design, build and develop the
state-of-the-art Stanford Internal Com
bustion Engine Laboratory. He was also
an avid skier and hot-rod enthusiast who
seemed to know everything about how

automotive engines work.
How tragic it is that such a life was cut
short, and even more so that it was prob
ably by his own hands. Was Rinehart sui
cidal? Indeed not. He had far too much to
live for. His habit just finally caught up
with him and before he could escape from
it, it was too late.
I hope his loss of life will serve as
notice to others that it could also happen
to them. We only go around once in this
life, and if it is worth living at all, it
doesn't serve us or those who love us to
risk cutting it short.
