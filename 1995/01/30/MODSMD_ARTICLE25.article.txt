USC 82

On the heels of a heartbreak
ing 77-74 loss at UCLA Thurs
day night, Saturday afternoon's
matchup versus USC seemed

somewhat anti-climactic. Still,
the Cardinal avoided the much
feared letdown and defeated
USC 85-82. •
"I really felt the kids were pre
pared initially because we didn't
dwell on UCLA," said head coach
Mike Montgomery. "We under
stood we put a pretty good effort
on the floor. I think rather than
coming out of it negatively we

turned it around quickly. We rec
ognized this game was important
pretty quickly."
The 17th-ranked Cardinal (13-
3 overall, 4-3 in the Pacific 10
Conference) turned in an effi
cient, workman-like performance
against the Trojans (7-11 overall,
2-6 Pac-10), dominating them
throughout much of the game,
just not the end. Although the
score appears close, there was lit
tle doubt as to the better team
and who would end the winner.
In front of a sparse Sports
Arena crowd of 2,681, the few
Trojan fans found little to be
enthusiastic about. The tone was
set from the beginning. Sopho
more guard Brevin Knight made
USC freshman guard Cameron
Murray look foolish, picking the
young Trojan's pocket on the first
play and taking it coast to coast
for an easy lay-up.
The Cardinal jumped out to an
early 7-0 lead, then extended it to
13 points with a three-pointer by
junior guard Dion Cross with 8:16
left in the game. A running base
line jumper by USC guard Burt
Harris brought the Trojans to
within eight, but with jump shots
by forward Andy Poppink and a
few fast-break buckets sparked by
Knight steals, the lead was back
to 13 by halftime.
Poppink had an outstanding
first half, shooting 70 percent
from the field and scoring 14
points. On the other hand, his
counterparts, highly touted Tro
jan forwards Lorenzo Orr and
Jaha Wilson, combined to make
two of 12 field goals.
"It's tough because we were
really excited about going to
UCLA," junior forward Andy
Poppink said. "So this game's
tough. Not a big crowd, not a
team that's ranked. So the big
thing is we were trying to create
our own excitement which we did
a pretty good job of in the first
half."
Much of the second half mir
rored the first. The Cardinal's
inside scoring dominated the
smaller Trojan team. Freshman
center Tim Young finished with a

career-high 19 points shooting 8
of 13 from the field. He also
chipped in with eight boards. His
two free throws early in the sec
ond half gave the Cardinal a 17-
pointload.
"I thought Tim Young had an
awfully nice game in the second
half," Montgomery said. "Partic
ularly by hitting some big buckets
for us. He gets so frustrated
sometimes defensively with what
goes on, but he needs to learn to
deal with that. He made some big
shots down there when we needed
them inside."
Young echoed his coach's com
ments.
"I was just trying to take the
ball to the hoop strong," Young
said. "I started getting into a
rhythm and got more confidence
as I put the shots through. But
towards the end of the game my
defense was kind of sorry. I have
to start working on that because
towards the end USC was going
down to their post men."
With 4:31 left in the game,
Stanford still led by 13 points, but
then things got a little strange as
the clock wound down. Trailing
by seven with 1:01 to go, Orr
blocked a Poppink shot. Cross
momentarily recovered the ball
only to have Harris run off with
it. Harris fed to Orr, and then,
seemingly losing all signs of com
mon sense, Orr nearly botched
the fast-break score when he
almost clanked a 360-dunk.
Fouled with 40 seconds
remaining, Cross, close to auto
matic at the charity stripe shoot
ing at an 87.7 percent clip,
extended the Cardinal lead back
to seven. Murray then banked a
three-pointer to bring the Trojans
to within four. Knight was then
fouled twice, going one-for-two on
both trips to the line to up the
lead to six. Murray again sank
another three, this time on the
run with three seconds left to
make the box score closer. But if
you were there, the victory was
never really in question.
"We weren't nervous," Knight
said. "We just knew we had to
win. We knew we had to win at
least one down here. We came a
little short against UCLA, so we
knew we had to get this game."
Even the usually pessimistic
Montgomery acknowledged the

game was in fairly good hands.
"It's always nice to have a
security blanket, the lead," Mont
gomery said. "But I've seen some
strange things happen here. Like
the three-point shot Murray
banked in, makes you wonder a
little bit all of a sudden about it.
But with our guards shooting as
well as they do from the free
throw line, with Brevin as good as
he is with the dribble I tend to
worry less."
Stanford dominated in nearly
every aspect of the game. Pop
pink's 20 points led all scorers.
Four Cardinal starters were in
double digits, and the only one
not, junior forward Darren Ail
away, superbly shut down the
high-flying Orr who finished with
a paltry nine points on 3-of-13
shooting,
"Every player on this team, we
have individual defensive assign
ments," Allaway said. "This trip,
it was my turn. I had to guard Ed
O'Bannon in UCLA and I had to
guard Lorenzo this game. I did a
decent job against Ed, but he got
away from us at the end. In order
for us to win today, Lorenzo
couldn't get away from us."
The Cardinal shot 51.5 per
cent, the Trojans just 38.0. The
Cardinal's rebounding effort
arose as its only problem. After
being outrebounded 50-35 versus
the Bruins, the Cardinal was
beaten again on the boards by a
smaller, albeit quicker, Trojan
team 44-37.
"We shot over 50, only turned
it over 11," Montgomery said. "I
guess the telling statistic as far as
they go are the 22 offensive
rebounds for SC. We obviously
didn't do a good job there. I would
think that that's the one thing
they did in the ball game that kept
them close. Of course, they also
hit some threes late, and got them
back in the game."
Nevertheless, Montgomery
will happily take the road win and
move on.
"I think we played pretty well
if you look at the stats," he said.
"I think the kids were a little bit
disappointed the way we finished
it up. But as I reminded them in
the locker room, we won. We won
on the road. The bottom line is we
got a win, and we get out with a
win on the road in Los Angeles."
