After being denied a wildcard
bid to last year's NCAA Final
Four, the Stanford men's volley
ball team found Saturday's 11-15,
16-14, 15-11, 15-12 victory over
defending national champion
Penn State especially sweet.
"We were ranked No. 2 last
year and if we had gotten the
playoff spot, Penn St. would have
been our opponents in the first
round [of the Final Four]," said
sophomore middle blocker
Michael Hoefer. "That whole
East Coast thing screwed us last
year and it was great to come in

and beat Penn State here."
The victory, however, was by
no means assured, judging by
Stanford's lackluster play in the
first set.
After a frustrating week of
practice, the Cardinal came out
with its feet dragging and fell
behind early, 9-2. Capitalizing on
numerous Stanford hitting
errors, the Nittany Lions domi
nated behind the serving and hit
ting of All-American setter Carlos
Ortiz.
Instead of facilitating a Penn
State blow-out in the first game,
however, the Cardinal finally
squared its shoulders and started
pounding its way back into the
game.
Hoefer converted on a quick set
from Stewart Chong for the third
point and junior All-American Mike
Lambert put on a show with a kill,
block and a short service ace to pull
Stanford within two points. The
Lions then helped Stanford out with
a pair of offensive errors to cap off
the Cardinal's seven-point resur
gence.
"We're such an offensive team
that no matter how far down we Eire
we know we'll score our points if we
just play our game," Lambert said.
"We don't get too worried about
falling behind, because this team
can always make up the difference."
Despite that seven-point run the
first game, Stanford was not able to
stave off the Lions' offensive attack,
as Penn State eventually regrouped
and closed the set at 15-11.
The Cardinal started the second
game in a fashion similar to its first
game performance, falling behind 5-
1 and then 7-4 before clawing its
way back to seven-all with a solo
block by Chong. The lead then
swayed back and forth until Penn
State pulled ahead 14-10 and
threatened to take a 2-0 advantage
in sets.
Facing game point, Stanford
head coach Ruben Nieves substitut
ed middle blocker Brian Moore in
for his setter to create a bigger line
up. The result was two consecutive
points for the Cardinal on a Lam
bert kill and a Matt Fuerbringer ace
deep in Penn State territory.
With Chong back in the ball

game, middle blocker Brian Garrett
and Lambert went up for the stuff
on point 14 to even the score. The
Lions' lefty swing hitter Ed Josefos
ki then misfired out-of-bounds to
put Stanford up 15-14. That mis
take set the stage for a Stewart
Chong feed to Fuerbringer for a
cross-court kill on game point.
"We started really well, but we
couldn't finish, it seems," said Lion
middle blocker Ivan Contreras, who
pestered the Cardinal with 33 kills
and a .393 hitting percentage on the
night. "We just hit a wall after
awhile, and Stanford kept siding out
against us."
Since the comeback game worked
so well in that set, Stanford was
forced to try it again in game three.
Falling behind 5-2 and then bottom
ing out at 10-6, the Cardinal began
plugging away at Penn State's lead
halfway through the set.
Lambert strung together anoth
er block, kill and ace series to pull
Stanford back into the game at 10-
all, aided by a Contreras hitting
error. Continuing its upward swing,
the Cardinal rode the momentum of
its offense and the enthusiasm of
the near-capacity crowd to three
more unanswered points.
Chong combined with freshman
Keenan Whitehurst for a stuff block
on point 11 and Whitehurst took
matters into his own hands on the
next point with a kill down the mid
dle.
After an exchange of hitting
errors, Garrett denied Penn State
outside hitter David Gealy for point
14, and Fuerbringer capped off the
scoring drive and the game with a
kill down the line.
"When the game gets close like
that, it's a matter of who's tougher
and who handles the pressure bet
ter," Nieves said. "Performing
under pressure was the difference."

The final game proved no differ
ent, as the Lions built up another
10-6 advantage before Stanford
responded with five consecutive
points. Penn State was able to
squeeze in two more scores before
Fuerbringer put the game to bed
with another one of his 27 kills on
match point.
"It was a good feeling to come
from behind and win those three
games, because we knew we were
better than Penn State," White
hurst said. "But we can't be doing

that to ourselves. In the future, we
need to come out and dominate
from point one to point 15."
Even though Stanford's play
improved as the pressure mounted,
the team attributes its emotional
performance to the Burnham Pavil
ion crowd on hand.
"The fans were as big a factor as
I've seen it been in the past few
years," Nieves said. "When we were
fighting our way back into the
game, the home court advantage
definitely boosted our level of play."
