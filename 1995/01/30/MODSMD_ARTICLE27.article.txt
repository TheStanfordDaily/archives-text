# Cardinal dethrone Women of Troy
## Biggest Pac-10 win ever comes over '94 champs 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
Stanford 109

Saturday night, two teams were
in a zone at Maples Pavilion. For
the USC women's basketball team,
it did net help. For Stanford, it did.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal
(16-1, 7-0 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) exploited the weaknesses in
the 20th-ranked USC (11-5, 4-4)
zone defense en route to a 109-53
victory.
The first sellout crowd of the
season for Stanford saw records
fall. The most notable was the
margin of 56 points which
eclipsed the largest margin of vic
tory in a Pac-10 women's basket
ball game. Previously, a 54-point
victory for Washington over Ari
zona State on Mar. 3, 1988 held
the record.
"We expected that they would
be in a zone," said Stanford coach
Tara VanDerveer. What she did
not expect was that her team
would be as well.

The Cardinal achieved nirvana
by shooting 72.4 percent from the
floor, along with 83.3 percent from
behind the arc, during the first
half. Combined with Stanford's sti
fling defense, which held the
Women of Troy to 28 percent
shooting, the Cardinal ran out to a
58-27 lead at halftime.
The scoring came quickly for
Stanford. The Cardinal leaped out
of the blocks early when senior
Kate Paye hit a trey for the first
points of the game. Junior Bobbie
Kelsey continued Stanford's tradi
tion of making baskets quickly and
early by launching another three to
give Stanford the 6-0 lead. Senior
Anita Kaplan then took the game
into her own hands.
"It was real important to get the
ball in to Anita," VanDerveer said.
"Anita, one on one, can score on
pretty much everybody."
Kaplan proceeded to make a
layup and hit a short jumper for
the 10-2 Cardinal lead. Then she
unveiled her hook shot.
Kaplan scored nine of the first
13 Cardinal baskets, four on her
patented hook, on nine-for-nine
shooting to help Stanford to a 36-
17 lead when she left the game.

as she shoots (not spikes) the ball over her USC defender.
Her only miss in the first half came
on a free throw.
"Anita did a great job inside,"
VanDerveer said. "She seemed very
comfortable."
Kelsey also played an almost per
fect first half. She made three of five
shots, including two treys, to finish
the first 20 minutes with 10 points
while dishing out two assists. Fresh
man Naomi Mulitauaopele led the
team with six rebounds in the half
and also scored seven points.
Kaplan finished the game with
the 19 points she garnered in the
first half as the Cardinal did not
need her to score in the final 20 min
utes. In fact, Stanford did not need
anyone to score in the second half.
"Our defense is the real key,"
VanDerveer said. "We want to
depend on our defense and rebound
• _ w
ing.
In the second half, the Cardi
nal defense looked more than
dependable. For the first 10 min
utes and 35 seconds of the half,
Stanford held USC to three
points. During the span, the Car
dinal lead ballooned from 31 to 53
points.
Much of the scoring came on easy
layups and free throws. Of Stan
ford's eight baskets during its sec
ond-half 25-3 run, six were layups.
The Cardinal also added nine points
on free throws.
"We were able to get contribu
tions from everybody," VanDerveer
said. "I'm pleased with a lot of
things we did."
Every player for the Cardinal
scored except for sophomore
Charmin Smith. Smith, however,
added to the effort with five assists
and two steals.
Kelsey finished the game with 16
points. Other bright spots were
sophomore Jamila Wideman's per
formance, highlighted by eight
points, four assists and two steals,
and the three freshmen Muli
tauaopele, Heather Owen and
Kristin Folkl.
Mulitauaopele tallied 11 points
and eight rebounds for the entire
game while Owen scored a career
high 11 points and grabbed seven

boards. Folk! scored 13 points and
electrified the crowd with an in
the-air, spinning assist to sopho
more Tara Harrington.
"It's fun when they have some
exciting plays, especially in front of a
big crowd," VanDerveer said.
Stanford passed the ball around
and constantly found open people
for easy shots. The Cardinal ended
the game making over 65 percent of
its attempts and racked up 30
assists. VanDerveer, however, cau
tioned against being too generous.
"Our unselfishness can be a
problem," she said. "I saw people
pass up two or three good shots. I
thought they were a little too
unselfish."
The same cannot be said about
USC. The Women of Troy ended the
worst loss in team history with only
six assists, which can account for
why USC shot under 26 percent
from the floor.
"It's tough to play against a team
that is as deep as they are," said
USC coach Cheryl Miller. "Our
bench certainly isn't as deep as
Stanford's."
USC did get a good game off the
bench from junior Audrey Gomez
who scored 15 points to tie for the
team lead, on six of 13 from the
floor, and also grabbed four offen
sive rebounds. Sophomore Michelle
Campbell and Gomez both played
extended minutes when Rashida
Jeffery got into early foul trouble.
"I think the officiating hurt us
tremendously," Miller said "It is
really hard to compete ... when
your two post players are in foul
trouble."
Both Jeffery and sophomore
star Tina Thompson fouled out of
the game. Thompson, the leading
scorer and rebounder for the
Women of Troy, finished the night
with 15 points and six boards.
However, she did so on only two-of
-10 shooting and also had six
turnovers. Jeffery virtually disap
peared when she played only nine
minutes and missed all four of her
shots.
VanDerveer enjoyed the domina
tion that the Cardinal exhibited, but
cautioned that 11 games lie ahead.
"The real challenge is ahead for
our team," VanDerveer cautioned.
"I hope no one is complacent. You
better be ready to play every night."

big crowd," VanDerveer said.
Stanford passed the ball around
and constantly found open people
for easy shots. The Cardinal ended
the game making over 65 percent of
its attempts and racked up 30
assists. VanDerveer, however, cau
tioned against being too generous.
"Our unselfishness can be a
problem," she said. "I saw people
pass up two or three good shots. I
thought they were a little too
unselfish."
The same cannot be said about
USC. The Women of Troy ended the
worst loss in team history with only
six assists, which can account for
why USC shot under 26 percent
from the floor.
"It's tough to play against a team
that is as deep as they are," said
USC coach Cheryl Miller. "Our
bench certainly isn't as deep as
Stanford's."
USC did get a good game off the
bench from junior Audrey Gomez
who scored 15 points to tie for the
team lead, on six of 13 from the
floor, and also grabbed four offen
sive rebounds. Sophomore Michelle
Campbell and Gomez both played
extended minutes when Rashida
Jeffery got into early foul trouble.
"I think the officiating hurt us
tremendously," Miller said "It is
really hard to compete ... when
your two post players are in foul
trouble."
Both Jeffery and sophomore
star Tina Thompson fouled out of
the game. Thompson, the leading
scorer and rebounder for the
Women of Troy, finished the night
with 15 points and six boards.
However, she did so on only two-of
-10 shooting and also had six
turnovers. Jeffery virtually disap
peared when she played only nine
minutes and missed all four of her
shots.
VanDerveer enjoyed the domina
tion that the Cardinal exhibited, but
cautioned that 11 games lie ahead.
"The real challenge is ahead for
our team," VanDerveer cautioned.
"I hope no one is complacent. You
better be ready to play every night."
Stanford 109

Saturday night, two teams were
in a zone at Maples Pavilion. For
the USC women's basketball team,
it did net help. For Stanford, it did.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal
(16-1, 7-0 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) exploited the weaknesses in
the 20th-ranked USC (11-5, 4-4)
zone defense en route to a 109-53
victory.
The first sellout crowd of the
season for Stanford saw records
fall. The most notable was the
margin of 56 points which
eclipsed the largest margin of vic
tory in a Pac-10 women's basket
ball game. Previously, a 54-point
victory for Washington over Ari
zona State on Mar. 3, 1988 held
the record.
"We expected that they would
be in a zone," said Stanford coach
Tara VanDerveer. What she did
not expect was that her team
would be as well.

The Cardinal achieved nirvana
by shooting 72.4 percent from the
floor, along with 83.3 percent from
behind the arc, during the first
half. Combined with Stanford's sti
fling defense, which held the
Women of Troy to 28 percent
shooting, the Cardinal ran out to a
58-27 lead at halftime.
The scoring came quickly for
Stanford. The Cardinal leaped out
of the blocks early when senior
Kate Paye hit a trey for the first
points of the game. Junior Bobbie
Kelsey continued Stanford's tradi
tion of making baskets quickly and
early by launching another three to
give Stanford the 6-0 lead. Senior
Anita Kaplan then took the game
into her own hands.
"It was real important to get the
ball in to Anita," VanDerveer said.
"Anita, one on one, can score on
pretty much everybody."
Kaplan proceeded to make a
layup and hit a short jumper for
the 10-2 Cardinal lead. Then she
unveiled her hook shot.
Kaplan scored nine of the first
13 Cardinal baskets, four on her
patented hook, on nine-for-nine
shooting to help Stanford to a 36-
17 lead when she left the game.

Freshman Kristin Folkl demonstrates her characteristic sky-jump
as she shoots (not spikes) the ball over her USC defender.
Her only miss in the first half came
on a free throw.
"Anita did a great job inside,"
VanDerveer said. "She seemed very
comfortable."
Kelsey also played an almost per
fect first half. She made three of five
shots, including two treys, to finish
the first 20 minutes with 10 points
while dishing out two assists. Fresh
man Naomi Mulitauaopele led the
team with six rebounds in the half
and also scored seven points.
Kaplan finished the game with
the 19 points she garnered in the
first half as the Cardinal did not
need her to score in the final 20 min
utes. In fact, Stanford did not need
anyone to score in the second half.
"Our defense is the real key,"
VanDerveer said. "We want to
depend on our defense and rebound
• _ w
ing.
In the second half, the Cardi
nal defense looked more than
dependable. For the first 10 min
utes and 35 seconds of the half,
Stanford held USC to three
points. During the span, the Car
dinal lead ballooned from 31 to 53
points.
Much of the scoring came on easy
layups and free throws. Of Stan
ford's eight baskets during its sec
ond-half 25-3 run, six were layups.
The Cardinal also added nine points
on free throws.
"We were able to get contribu
tions from everybody," VanDerveer
said. "I'm pleased with a lot of
things we did."
Every player for the Cardinal
scored except for sophomore
Charmin Smith. Smith, however,
added to the effort with five assists
and two steals.
Kelsey finished the game with 16
points. Other bright spots were
sophomore Jamila Wideman's per
formance, highlighted by eight
points, four assists and two steals,
and the three freshmen Muli
tauaopele, Heather Owen and
Kristin Folkl.
Mulitauaopele tallied 11 points
and eight rebounds for the entire
game while Owen scored a career
high 11 points and grabbed seven

boards. Folk! scored 13 points and
electrified the crowd with an in
the-air, spinning assist to sopho
more Tara Harrington.
