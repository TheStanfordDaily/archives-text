## Biggest Pac-10 win ever comes over '94 champs

Stanford 109

Saturday night, two teams were
in a zone at Maples Pavilion. For
the USC women's basketball team,
it did net help. For Stanford, it did.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal
(16-1, 7-0 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) exploited the weaknesses in
the 20th-ranked USC (11-5, 4-4)
zone defense en route to a 109-53
victory.
The first sellout crowd of the
season for Stanford saw records
fall. The most notable was the
margin of 56 points which
eclipsed the largest margin of vic
tory in a Pac-10 women's basket
ball game. Previously, a 54-point
victory for Washington over Ari
zona State on Mar. 3, 1988 held
the record.
"We expected that they would
be in a zone," said Stanford coach
Tara VanDerveer. What she did
not expect was that her team
would be as well.

The Cardinal achieved nirvana
by shooting 72.4 percent from the
floor, along with 83.3 percent from
behind the arc, during the first
half. Combined with Stanford's sti
fling defense, which held the
Women of Troy to 28 percent
shooting, the Cardinal ran out to a
58-27 lead at halftime.
The scoring came quickly for
Stanford. The Cardinal leaped out
of the blocks early when senior
Kate Paye hit a trey for the first
points of the game. Junior Bobbie
Kelsey continued Stanford's tradi
tion of making baskets quickly and
early by launching another three to
give Stanford the 6-0 lead. Senior
Anita Kaplan then took the game
into her own hands.
"It was real important to get the
ball in to Anita," VanDerveer said.
"Anita, one on one, can score on
pretty much everybody."
Kaplan proceeded to make a
layup and hit a short jumper for
the 10-2 Cardinal lead. Then she
unveiled her hook shot.
Kaplan scored nine of the first
13 Cardinal baskets, four on her
patented hook, on nine-for-nine
shooting to help Stanford to a 36-
17 lead when she left the game.
