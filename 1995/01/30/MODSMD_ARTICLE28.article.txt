# Intangibles set Stanford apart from Miller's squad

Just what is the difference
between a Top 20 team and a Top 5
team in women's college basket
ball?
Well, a whole lotta points and
. . . the little things. It's little
things, the intangibles that put a
team head-and-shoulders above
the rest, that distinguishes
between serious title contenders
and tournament bound pre
tenders.
It was these little things that
allowed the Stanford Cardinal (16-
1, 7-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
to jump all over the No. 20 Trojans
of Southern California 109-53 last
Saturday night for its 14th-consec
utive win and the largest margin of
victory in Pac-10 history.
These are the aspects of the
game that the coaching staff can
not possibly teach, and thus loves
when it can take advantage of their
existence â€” communication, exe
cution, hustle, desire, intensity,

and mental preparedness. The
Cardinal possessed all of these
qualities at the same time through
out the game, propelling it to a 31-
point halftime lead and yet another
Pac-10 shellacking at Maples Pavil
ion.
A championship caliber team
must have the ability to communi
cate on the court without their
coach coaxing them through the
game. Players must be able to
switch through screens, help each
other out through defensive break
downs and call plays depending on
instantaneous court situations.
The Cardinal had all the chan
nels open' on Saturday night, as
players maintained precise, accu
rate and effective interaction
within the squad. Such interac
tion allowed and will continue to
allow Tara VanDerveer's squad to
compete at a much higher level.
For example, the first half saw
Stanford's constantly changing
defense stymie the Trojan offense.
