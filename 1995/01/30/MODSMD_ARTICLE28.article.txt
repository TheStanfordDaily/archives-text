# Intangibles set Stanford apart from Miller's squad
## 
### Courtney Mann Contributing writer 
Just what is the difference
between a Top 20 team and a Top 5
team in women's college basket
ball?
Well, a whole lotta points and
. . . the little things. It's little
things, the intangibles that put a
team head-and-shoulders above
the rest, that distinguishes
between serious title contenders
and tournament bound pre
tenders.
It was these little things that
allowed the Stanford Cardinal (16-
1, 7-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
to jump all over the No. 20 Trojans
of Southern California 109-53 last
Saturday night for its 14th-consec
utive win and the largest margin of
victory in Pac-10 history.
These are the aspects of the
game that the coaching staff can
not possibly teach, and thus loves
when it can take advantage of their
existence â€” communication, exe
cution, hustle, desire, intensity,

and mental preparedness. The
Cardinal possessed all of these
qualities at the same time through
out the game, propelling it to a 31-
point halftime lead and yet another
Pac-10 shellacking at Maples Pavil
ion.
A championship caliber team
must have the ability to communi
cate on the court without their
coach coaxing them through the
game. Players must be able to
switch through screens, help each
other out through defensive break
downs and call plays depending on
instantaneous court situations.
The Cardinal had all the chan
nels open' on Saturday night, as
players maintained precise, accu
rate and effective interaction
within the squad. Such interac
tion allowed and will continue to
allow Tara VanDerveer's squad to
compete at a much higher level.
For example, the first half saw
Stanford's constantly changing
defense stymie the Trojan offense.
Stanford would transform from
an intense man-to-man defense to
a suffocating 2-3 zone to another
swarming half-court 1-3-1 trap
ping zone. The Cardinal's mutabil
ity depended exclusively on the fact
that every single player on the
court knew what defense the team
was currently performing. Stan
ford's "talk" made that possible as
after every offensive set, the coach
ing staff and each player held up
their hand, either notifying of the
next defense or acknowledging
their awareness of it.
Thus, the Trojan point guard
had no idea what lied in store on
the other side of half court as she
brought the ball up the floor, nor
could she decide how to attack it.
"It wasn't difficult Ito counter],"
said USC head coach Cheryl Miller.
"We just simply weren't reacting.
We knew exactly what they were
running."
In other words, the women of
Troy couldn't respond with enough
communication of their own in
order to call the appropriate
offense set for the defense Stanford
had called.
Stanford's communication
skills were also apparent on a
smaller scale. For example, USC
guard Audrey Gomez broke down
the defense, or so she thought,
with penetration in the first half.

Instead of leaving a free path to the
goal, however, Stanford's man-to
man help system subsequently
reacted as Anita Kaplan rotated
over from the weak side, stopped
penetration, and then recovered
back to her individual responsibili
ty.
Simple execution is obviously
crucial in a basketball game as
well. The coach can design the per
fect play in the huddle and place
the most athletic squad on the
floor, but if those five cannot exe
cute then all else is futile. This
simple execution enabled Stan
ford's offense to open the game
with three wide open three point
ers which Kate Paye and Bobbie
Kelsey converted. It allowed Anita
Kaplan to receive the ball exactly
where she likes it so that she could
pour in 19 points on nine-of-nine
shooting, all in the first half of
Play-
Execution gives a team the
kinds of shots that boost shooting
percentage to an incredible 72.4
total in the first half and a season
high game percentage of 65.1.
"You like it when you shoot that
well, but you don't want to depend
on that," VanDerveer said.
Although if your team executes
that well, it may not be a such an
aberrance.
The Cardinal not only func
tioned practically flawlessly in its
offensive game, but on the boards
as well. A coach stresses how to box
out and gain appropriate position
for the rebound above going for the

ball itself. She says undoubtedly
that if everyone does their job
effectively, the ball should actually
fall to the floor before anyone
touches it.
Of course, this is an ideal goal;
it never actually occurs. Last
night, however the Stanford squad
stood so on top of its game that
this ultimate goal actually
occurred twice.
The Cardinal's desire, hustle,
and focus could not be more perva
sive in any one single contest.
Whether it be Paye on the floor for
the loose ball or Jamila Wideman
selflessly making the extra pass
while driving for a higher-percent
age shot or the countless ball fakes
that disallowed predictability as a
factor, VanDerveer had all cylin
ders pumping.
A lesser-talented team coming
into the fiery lair of a pre-eminent
team must rely on s their opponent
if they have upset aspirations.
However, it was the Cardinal, not
the women of Troy, that rode the
wave of intensity, that dove on the
floor without hesitation, that leapt
out of bounds to save a ball in play,
that took the charge fearlessly as
USC drove the lane.
"I'm still looking for things we
can do better," VanDerveer said.
The Cardinal can always
improve the plays or the free
throws or the three-point shots.
As long as the little things contin
ue to exist, however, Stanford
may get some more good looks at
history.
