Stanford 6
St, Mary's 0

The top-ranked Stanford baseball squad
wasted no time in showing why many have
picked it to go all the way in 1995.
The Cardinal (1-0), fueled by solid pitching
and timely hitting, shut out St. Mary's (0-1)
on Saturday in the rain-postponed season

opener at Sunken Diamond. Junior left-han
ders Dan Reed and reliever Mike Robbins
combined to blank the Gaels, 6-0.
St. Mary's and Stanford will meet again
this afternoon at Sunken Diamond in a make
up of a game originally scheduled for yester
day.
Reed struck out six Gaels while allowing
just one walk through six innings pitched on
opening day. The southpaw stifled St. Mary's
all afternoon, giving up only two base hits —
one of which was an infield single — to earn
the win.
"We're certainly pleased with the perfor
mance," said Stanford pitching coach Dean
Stotz. "But we're not deceived in any way and
we know that it's too early to tell how good we

are. With all the rain around here you really
have no idea how prepared other teams are.
We'll just have to wait and see."
Cardinal hitters managed just five hits
themselves on Saturday, though it seemed as
if every one proved costly. All six Stanford
runs were scored with two outs, including
two-run outbursts in the first, fifth and eighth
innings.
After the first two Cardinal batters of the
game were retired, Stanford mounted the first
of a series of rallies, beginning when Kevin
Culmo, the St. Mary's starter, had his pitch
carom off of A.J. Hinch's helmet. First base
man Steve Carver followed with a double to
the left field wall which scored
Hinch. After Chris Clark drew a
walk, shortstop Eric Sees singled
sharply to plate Carver and give the
Cardinal a quick 2-0 edge.
That offense proved to be more
than enough as the Stanford duo of
Reed and Robbins never gave the
Gaels a chance.
St. Mary's best opportunity to
score came in the fifth inning when
right fielder Jason Weekly led off
with a triple to the gap in right. But
Reed worked himself out of the jam,
forcing two quick comebackers
before facing Jeremy Fuller. Fuller
attempted a squeeze play, laying a
solid bunt down the third-base line
as Weekly charged to the plate. But
Hinch, an Ail-American catcher,
pounced on the ball and threw to
first off-balance to keep the Gaels
off of the scoreboard.
The Cardinal cruised from that
point on, with Reed finally giving
way to Robbins in the seventh
inning. Robbins earned the save,
pitching three perfect innings
while chalking up three more
strikeouts.
Sophomore Chris Clark — start
ing in right field for the injured
Brodie VanWagenen — had a two
run double, drew two walks and
made a spectacular diving catch of a
foul ball to end Saturday's game.
"It's always good to get off to a
good start," Clark said. "Everyone
was a little apprehensive with us
being ranked No. 1. You want to
know how good you really are."
The Cardinal broke open a 2-0
game in the fifth inning when junior
Cale Carter led off with a double to
the right wall. Freshman Joe Kil
burg — who made the start at third
base — then walked, bringing up
the meat of the Cardinal order.
Hinch popped out and Carver
grounded out before Clark plated
two runs with a line-drive double.
Stanford was also able to manu
facture a couple of insurance runs

in the eighth inning. Sees walked to
lead off the inning and quickly stole
second. Afler Rich Crowe struck
out, freshman Chris Draft — who
also plays football for the Cardinal
— grounded to shortstop, advanc
ing Sees to third. Second basemen
Jay Pecci then executed a perfect
squeeze play as he beat the throw to

first and Sees came in to score the
fifth Stanford run.
Sophomore Jason Middlebrook
— an overpowering pitcher clocked
at over 95 miles per hour — will
make the start for the Cardinal
today with first pitch slated for 2
p.m.
