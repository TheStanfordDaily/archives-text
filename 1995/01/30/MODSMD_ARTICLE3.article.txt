# Lack of upkeep destroys trees in Arboretum

The delay of a tree maintenance pro
gram has left the arboretum and other
areas around campus with more than
100 dead or injured trees.
University Labor and Grounds
Manager Herb Fong said maintenance
crews have already removed 50 dead
trees, some of which have been sched
uled for removal since 1973.

The arboretum is "an area that's
had very little maintenance done to it
in the past," he said. "It's been pretty
much left in its natural state."
Projects to remove dead trees and
branches have "not been a high priori
ty," Fong said, "because these have
been hard times financially for the Uni
versity."
But the years of neglect have taken
their toll on the groves of trees around
campus, especially the eucalyptus

trees, Fong said.
"Eucalyptus trees have a natural
predator," he explained. Because of the
arrival of the wood-tunneling borer —
an insect that first attacked trees in
Southern California eight years ago
and has moved north — "we're dealing
with a large number of dead trees and
partially dead trees," Fong said.
The danger comes from the beetle
larvae, Fong said. A wood-tunneling
borer "develops from egg to larvae,

bores into the wood and chokes off food
and nutrients from the tree," he ex
plained. "The tree dies, from lack of
water. Then [the insect] emerges as an
adult and repeats its life cycle."
"Its primary hosts are 'stressed'
trees" — those which are not well-main
tained, Fong added. "There's a lot of in
jury there that attracts the beetles."
Along with removing injured trees,
