# Swimmers romp over UCLA, USC
## Women triumph in seniors' final home dual meet 
### Ezra Baylin Contributing writer 
Traditionally, UCLA, USC and Stanford have
provided tough competition for one another. But
what were supposed to be two of the best match-ups
in women's swimming this year turned into Cardi
nal blow-outs as top-ranked Stanford defeated No. 9
UCLA 163-133 on Friday, and then rolled over sec
ond-ranked USC 192-107 on Saturday.
"Unbelievable — this was the highest level of
concentration we have had in a dual meet in my four
years at Stanford," said senior co-captain Becky
Crowe in regard to the USC meet. "It was really spe
cial because it was our last home [dual] meet as
seniors."
Although Saturday's match-up between the top
two teams in women's swimming came as the last
dual meet for Cardinal greats like Eileen Richetelli
and Jenny Thompson, strong individual perfor
mances by sophomores Sarah Anderson and Claudia
Franco paved the way for Stanford's victory.
Anderson cruised to easy firsts in the 500- and
1650-yard freestyle races, qualifying for the March
NCAA championship meet in the latter event.
"I was surprised that I qualified [for the champi

onships]," Anderson said. "I didn't feel like I swam
that hard. Making the cut for nationals was not
what I was thinking about. I just wanted to win the
race."
Franco, meanwhile, anchored the first-place 400-
yard freestyle relay, took second in the 50-yard
freestyle and won the 100-yard freestyle.
"Claudia Franco came through for us with big
wins when we needed them," said head coach
Richard Quick. "Her performances were really
influential."
Although its individual showings were inspiring
this weekend, Stanford accredited the victory over
the Trojans to its ability to pull together as a team.
"We were expecting this meet to be a lot closer, so
we treated this as though it were the NCAA cham
pionship meet." Thompson said. "Team unity, not
individual performances, will win us another
national championship, and we showed that we can
come together when we need to."
In contrast to the USC meet, UCLA proved
tougher than expected on Friday. Although the Car
dinal beat the Bruins by 30 points, not all Cardinal
members were satisfied with their individual perfor-
