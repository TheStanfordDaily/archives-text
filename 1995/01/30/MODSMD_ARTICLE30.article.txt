# Swimmers romp over UCLA, USC
## Women triumph in seniors' final home dual meet 
### Ezra Baylin Contributing writer 
Traditionally, UCLA, USC and Stanford have
provided tough competition for one another. But
what were supposed to be two of the best match-ups
in women's swimming this year turned into Cardi
nal blow-outs as top-ranked Stanford defeated No. 9
UCLA 163-133 on Friday, and then rolled over sec
ond-ranked USC 192-107 on Saturday.
"Unbelievable — this was the highest level of
concentration we have had in a dual meet in my four
years at Stanford," said senior co-captain Becky
Crowe in regard to the USC meet. "It was really spe
cial because it was our last home [dual] meet as
seniors."
Although Saturday's match-up between the top
two teams in women's swimming came as the last
dual meet for Cardinal greats like Eileen Richetelli
and Jenny Thompson, strong individual perfor
mances by sophomores Sarah Anderson and Claudia
Franco paved the way for Stanford's victory.
Anderson cruised to easy firsts in the 500- and
1650-yard freestyle races, qualifying for the March
NCAA championship meet in the latter event.
"I was surprised that I qualified [for the champi

onships]," Anderson said. "I didn't feel like I swam
that hard. Making the cut for nationals was not
what I was thinking about. I just wanted to win the
race."
Franco, meanwhile, anchored the first-place 400-
yard freestyle relay, took second in the 50-yard
freestyle and won the 100-yard freestyle.
"Claudia Franco came through for us with big
wins when we needed them," said head coach
Richard Quick. "Her performances were really
influential."
Although its individual showings were inspiring
this weekend, Stanford accredited the victory over
the Trojans to its ability to pull together as a team.
"We were expecting this meet to be a lot closer, so
we treated this as though it were the NCAA cham
pionship meet." Thompson said. "Team unity, not
individual performances, will win us another
national championship, and we showed that we can
come together when we need to."
In contrast to the USC meet, UCLA proved
tougher than expected on Friday. Although the Car
dinal beat the Bruins by 30 points, not all Cardinal
members were satisfied with their individual perfor-

mances.
Four-time NCAA champion and
two-time NCAA Diver of the Year
Richetelli placed third in the three
meter and second in the one-meter

competitions against UCLA.
Richetelli is capable of sweeping
both diving events, but her dual
meet record has not been consistent.
"I definitely have to start work
ing harder and focusing more,"
Richetelli said. "In the past I have
had problems with dual meets, but I
can't just ignore these latest
results."
Although Richetelli was unhappy

with her standings, sophomore Britt
Mattern dove to strong finishes in
both meets this weekend, capturing
second in the three meter and third
in the one meter on Friday and third
in both events against the Trojans
on Saturday.
"We weren't expecting to domi
nate the diving events, and I did not
think that I would beat Eileen
fßichetelli] in the three-meter event

against UCLA," Mattern said. "USC
had one great diver so it was a chal
lenge to stay focused, but I think we
handled the pressure really well."
The UCLA meet also served as a
showcase for Stanford's top swim
ming talent, as the Cardinal won 10
of the 14 swimming events, includ
ing both the crucial 200-yard
freestyle and 200-yard medley
relays.
