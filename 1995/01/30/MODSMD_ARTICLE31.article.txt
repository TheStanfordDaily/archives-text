Stanford women's tennis
danced with perfection last Satur
day afternoon as it manhandled
visiting University of Nevada-Las
Vegas, taking each of nine match
es. The Cardinal as a whole, as
well as each player and doubles
team involved, advanced to 1-0
after this first dual match of the
long tennis season.
"I'm very pleased we got it in,"
said head coach Frank Brcnnan,
after rain got the better of Fri
day's competition versus Pacific
10 Conference rival Washington.
"I thought we were fairly sharp
for this time of year."
The Cardinal saw its fiercest
competition at both the No. 1 sin
gles and doubles slots, as Ail-
American Katie Schlukebir (No.
10 nationally) hooked horns with
Marianne Vallin (No. 24).
Schlukebir eventually prevailed
in a grueling three-set match with
a deciding tiebreak at the end of
the third set.
"That's one of the best match
es you're gonna see," Brennan
said. "Nobody gave an inch."
In a match of constantly
changing momentum, Schlukebir
took the first set 6-3, as the two
heavyweights, unfamiliar with
each other, felt out the other's
style.
"I had seen her play before, but
not in matches," Schlukebir said.
"I knew she was a big hitter. She
just made a lot of mistakes in that
first set."
Vallin then fought back in the
second set 6-4 with a vicious fore
hand. Schlukebir seemed to take
control in the third set, using
tremendous serves to jump
ahead 3-0. The Cardinal sopho

more also began to feed Vallin's
backhand.
"It was like 'Stay away from
her forehand,' but then she puts
away some backhands," Brennan
said. And Vallin did just that as
she pulled back into the set.
Schlukebir withstood the surge,
however, and had numerous
match points at 5-4 in the third
set.
Vallin held her ground though
as she broke serve and then went
ahead 6-5. Schlukebir wasn't
about to surrender. "She plays
really well from behind," Brennan
said. "She just doesn't let up."
"When I'm down, I kind of
think 'Go for it.' If you're not
aggressive, you're going to lose
anyway," Schlukebir said.
Schlukebir rebounded to win
her serve and sent the match into
a deciding overtime tiebreak.
Vallin immediately took a
tremendous 0-4 edge, but
Schlukebir then rattled off four

points of her own, only to see
Vallin take over the all-important
momentum and ride it to a double
match point at 4-6. Schlukebir
made one final effort at the
match, and it paid off as she went
on to finally take it with a 9-7
tiebreak victory.
"(Katie's) lack of an emotional
outburst actually won the match.
To her credit, she never lost faith
in herself," Brennan said.
No. 1 doubles saw a tough col
lision as well with Schlukebir and
freshman Ania Bleszynski squar
ing off against Vallin and Astrid
Copano. Stanford broke out
quickly to capture the first set 6-2
as Schlukebir rode the emotion of
her singles win. UNLV nearly
took the match to a third set but
the Cardinal staged a comeback
from a 3-5 deficit in the second set
to end the match early with a 7-5
victory.

will be a good No. 1 doubles team,"
Brennan said. "Right now, Ania is
still trying to figure what this col
lege doubles thing is all about."
In the other seven matches,
the Cardinal's depth proved too
much for the Rebels as Stanford
dropped only one set in seven
matches. Bleszynski, at No. 2 sin
gles, simply overpowered her
opponent 6-3, 6-2 with hard-hit
volleys and overheads. Senior
Kim Shasby started off slow in

the No. 3 singles match but
fought back to win 4-6, 6-2, 6-2.
Stanford flat out dominated
the other singles matches. No. 4
sophomore Sandra De Silva
seized a 6-2, 6-2 victory, and
freshman Julie Scott lost one less
game in the No. 5 match 6-2, 6-1.
Senior Amy Chiminello wiped out
her No. 6 opponent 6-1, 6-1.
In the No. 2 doubles match,
Chiminello and Scott teamed up
for a 6-3, 6-0 blow-out victory
characterized by aggressive net
play. Shasby and sophomore
Emily Burt hardly broke a sweat
in their 6-1, 6-0 win at the No. 3
doubles slot.

"We have good depth," said
Brennan. "That's been our tradi
tion. Our fives and sixes have
always been real good."
The Cardinal will defend its
home courts and No. 3 national
ranking again this weekend as
Fresno State comes to town tomor
row for another 1:30 p.m. start.
Brennan will rest Schlukebir and
Bleszynski as they prepare for the
Rolex Invitational Tournament in
Dallas, Texas this weekend.
Burt and junior Wendy Sacks
will be bumped up into singles
competition while freshmen Sophy
Woodhouse and Heidi Stalla will
see some doubles action as well.
