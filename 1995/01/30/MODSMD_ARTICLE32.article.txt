Stanford 9
San Diego 0

Super Bowl Sunday was only
the second half of a disappointing
weekend for the city of San Diego,
for the Chargers were drubbed by
the 49ers just one day after the
No. 48 University of San Diego
men's tennis team (2-1) fell victim
to another Bay Area powerhouse,
the No. 1 Stanford men (2-0).
Saturday's matchup at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium foreshad
owed the more publicized event in
Miami in that the team from the
Southland (University of San
Diego) played slightly better than
expected, but the team with the
better personnel (Stanford) still
won convincingly.
All nine matches of the day
were won by Stanford, though
three of the singles matches
stretched to three sets and anoth
er match was much closer than its
score indicated.
With the threats of rain forcing
singles matches to be played prior
to doubles competition, freshman
Paul Goldstein notched Stan
ford's first and easiest victory of
the day at No. 3 singles. He sent a
definitive message to future oppo
nents by thumping J.J. Shobar, 6-
1, 6-0. Goldstein, ranked No. 40 in
the ITA/Rolex pre-season singles
rankings, lost the second game of
the first set but then steamrolled
through the rest of the match,
winning the remaining 11 games.
"I wasn't concentrating real well
in the first couple of games. I was
checking the scoreboard and look
ing at the crowd," Goldstein said
of his first dual match on Stan
ford's stadium courts.
Still, Goldstein's auspicious
debut enabled him to walk off the
court a full hour before any of his
teammates.
"Paul's serving rhythm and
hitting action were very good,"
said Stanford head coach Dick
Gould.
Goldstein's freshman team

mate, 33rd-ranked Scott
Humphries, prevailed 6-4, 6-3
over Emmanuel Udozorh in an
exciting match on Court 2.
Though the final score was some
what lopsided, Udozorh forced
most of the games to deuce. This
resulted in a two-hour match with
many big points.
"I like it when one of my play
ers really has to work hard to win
a match," Gould said.
One of the most memorable
points of the match came midway
through the second set when
Humphries chased down a lob,
and with his back to the net,
smashed a return between his
legs. Although he eventually lost
the point, Humphries won the
applause of the fans in atten
dance, all of whom were watching
the phenom for the first time in a
dual contest.
Humphries said that his plan
going into the match was to dic
tate the style of play by "going for
[his] shots" and not allowing Udo
zorh, "a deceiving player who is
quick around the net," to control
the points — a scenario which

Humphries said "would have
made it a long day."
"Humphries kept his head in
the match and never let up," Udo
zorh said. "He hit some good pass
ing shots when he really needed
them."
After sophomore Grant Elliot
overcame a week-long illness to
pull out a 7-6, 6-3 victopr over Jeff
Greenhut in No. 5 singles, the
stage was set for junior Jeff
Salzenstein to clinch the dual
match victory with a win in No. 1
singles. The sixth-ranked Salzen
stein had a rough time with
Bobby Hrdina after winning the
first set, 6-2. Serving to force a
tiebreaker in the second set,
Salzenstein was broken by Hrdi
na. In the third set, however,
Salzenstein regained his normally
strong serve, and used it to close
out the set and the match, 6-2, 5-
7, 6-4.
"I had a lot of chances that I
didn't take advantage of on his
serves and on break points,"
Salzenstein said.
