# Stanford begins to brew its own Cardinal coffee
## Caffeine high 
### Stephen L. Shih 
Stanford has long been noted as a school proud of its
name and all that goes with it.
Walk into the room of any residence on campus and
you're likely to fmd a Stanford sweatshirt hanging in
the closet — if it's not being worn — or an athletics
poster pinned to the wall.
Central stores and its marketing manager, Jane
Williams, are hoping that the combination of students'
"Logo fever" — along with the nationwide coffee craze
— will mean a healthy market for its new line of fresh,
whole-bean "Cardinal Coffees."
The coffees, which can be bought individually in bags
bearing the official school logo or in gift baskets that in
clude Stanford mugs and small coffee grinders, include
flavors like Lagunita Mocha Java.
Last year, after a recent decline in sales of regular cof
fees, Williams and her co-workers conducted a "coffee
survey."
She said that more than 50 percent of those receiving
surveys responded, compared to a usual 10 to 15 per
cent, and were very specific about their coffee needs —
demanding whole beans, gourmet flavors and specifica
tions on freshness.
"Stanford feels passionately about coffee," Williams
said.
Williams and her co-workers decided to "give the
public what they want" and began consulting several
Bay Area coffee-roasters about carrying a high-quality
coffee at Central Stores.
Then, America's Best Coffee — the San Francisco
based manufacturer of Haz Beans — offered to package
a private-label coffee just for Stanford.
"Our eyes lit up," Williams said. "We said 'This is
it.' "
After deciding to accept the offer, Central Stores con-

ducted more surveys to find out
exactly what flavors and choices
campus coffee-drinkers wanted.
Then came the hard part —
coming up with names for the
coffees that would carry special
meaning to those associated with
the school. While looking
through the Stanford Directory,
Williams was inspired — why not
name the coffees after student
residences?
"I used to work with alumni,"
Williams said, "and I know how
passionately they feel about their
residences, particularly their
freshman dorm. They just always
remember it."
There are currently 11 flavors
in all, including Branner Italian
Roast, Florence Moore French
Vienna, Escondido Sumatra, Man
zanita Special Blend and Wilbur
French Roast.
The coffees, which hit the
shelves shortly before winter break,
are selling well, said Williams, who
feels the fact that the coffee is pri
vately-roasted for the University is
a main draw for customers.

"This taste you can't get any
where else," she said. "I think that
Stanford people are very proud of
Stanford and that they would very
much like this coffee."
The coffees' association with
the school, however, has no bear
ing on some customers. Graduate
student Marcia Tsugawa said she
does not care about the name.
"It tastes good," she said simply
after sampling a cup of French
Roast at a recent "tasting party"
hosted by Central Stores to pro
mote the product.
Mary Ellen Denison, secretary
in the Radiology Department,
attributed some of the coffee's suc
cess to the fact that it is convenient
to buy. Departments, she pointed
out, can order it on-line.
If Cardinal Coffee continues to
be successful, Williams said cus
tomers may soon be able to fmd it
elsewhere on campus — such as
Tresidder or the Corner Pocket —
and in more flavors.
And, although it will probably
be a long time before you're able to
snack on Cardinal Corn Nuts or
buy a box of Cardinal Chocolates
for Valentine's Day, she admitted
that the Stanford logo might soon
make its way to other office-relat
ed or gift items.
