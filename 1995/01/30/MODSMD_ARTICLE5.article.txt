With his black vest, wire-rimmed
glasses and expressive hands, John
Edgar Wideman looks like the award
winning writer he is — capturing his au
dience and drawing them into his work.
Wideman, professor of English at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst
and author of "Brothers and Keepers"
and "All Stories Are True," gave a read
ing and discussion of his work last Friday

in Kimball Lounge.
"We sought him out, but part of the
reason we got him to come was because
he caught two basketball games in which
his daughter [Stanford sophomore Jami
la Wideman] was playing," said Blair
Bowman, interim director of the Black
Community Services Center and Mir
rielees resident fellow, who coordinated
the visit.
Wideman read excerpts from his
work-in-progress — a historical novel

about the black experience in late 18th
century America entitled "Cattle
Killing." The title refers to the killing of
cattle by the indigenous Xhosa people in
South Africa, carried out in the hopes
that it would make the British leave.
"This killing meant a suicide of the
culture, because cattle was their liveli
hood," said Wideman, who often focuses
on the black experience in America.
"When I look at black-on-black killings in
this country, it reminds me of
South African cattle killing."
Wideman hypnotized his audi
ence — stunned into silence by
the end of the reading — with
excerpts from his book, balancing
soft phrases, such as "holding the
baby like a broken wing," with
striking images: "Her skull is
naked, innocent as the soles of her
feet."
"In this novel, the challenge
for me was how to make a distant
time alive," he said.
Wideman also talked with the
audience about being a writer and
the difficult choices he has made.
"You have to figure this way: How
many lives are you going to
have?" he said. "If you don't do it
in this life, when are you going to
do it?
"I never met anyone who said
to me, 'Uh. . . I made a mistake —
I followed my dream," he added,
drawing laughter from the audi
ence of 35.
In the question and answer
period following the reading,
Wideman said he considers him
self an amateur poet. "I think
that all language of expression,
maybe all language, tends
towards music and interval, so
poetry is just along this continu
um towards the purer form —

music," he said.
Dismissing the luck involved in
being a writer, Wideman said,
"Writing is not a way of earning a
living, it is a way of living — the
luck is only about earning a liv
ing."
He went on to explain that his
work is not meant to placate read
ers, and that sometimes it may be
ugly or disconcerting. "Art should
make people feel things — it's a
very powerful medium," he said.
"I enjoy work that changes my
view of the world."
Wideman said he never
answers questions about his liter
ary influences. "But, I have a
peculiar attitude towards writing,
and in the last 20 years I have
focused more on the non-literary
aspects — sermons, music, story
telling," he said, "And I have been
trying to incorporate that into my
work."
Asked if one can be too young
to start writing, Wideman
answered that "you never know
how long you're going to be
around, so it doesn't mean that
you can't start young."
Wideman also took time to
reflect on the relationship
between academia and writing.
"Teaching is a gregarious activity,
and it is intellectually stimulat
ing, whereas writing is solitary,
and so they balance each other
out."
He also spoke of his experience
as a Rhodes scholar, a huge

change from his inner-city child
hood. "I feel that people of color,
especially, need the experience of
getting out of the context of this
country and experiencing another
culture," Wideman said.

Wideman has twice won the
PEN/Faulkner Award for Excel
lence in Fiction and has been
called "one of America's premier
writers" by The New York
Times.
