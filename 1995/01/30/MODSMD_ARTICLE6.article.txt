# Fee overhaul alive despite BFD's death
## Special-fee reform still on '94 -'95 ASSU agenda 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
With the recent narrow failure of the Balanced
Funding Deal, the future of the fee-refund system re
mains uncertain.
While some members of the ASSU said they have
tentative plans to propose another bill for the gener
al ASSU election in April, debate is already beginning
on what that proposed should contain.
"I would assume that there will be another bill
proposed for the spring elections, most likely for the
general election," said Senate Chair Nawwar Kas
rawi. "Something will come through the senate."
Kasrawi also said that those who proposed and
supported the Balanced Funding Deal will begin to
work on an alternative as soon as possible.
"There probably will be many competing propos
als on the ballot in the spring, especially given the di
versity of opinion on the 'no' side," Kasrawi said. "Ei
ther that, or there may be many proposals addressing
separately the components" of the amendment.
The senate is not under any time crunch, Kasrawi
said, adding that if any new bills are introduced they
would not have to be finalized until about the first
week of spring quarter. Currently, all plans for new
proposals to reform the refund system are tentative,
he said.
"The issue of when a constitutional change can be
applied is something the senate will have to look at,"
Kasrawi said. It is a possibility that, if a bill is passed
in the general election, it could go into effect as early
as next year, but he added that it is impossible to pre
dict now.
The Balanced Funding Deal proposed, among
other changes, to abolish the cur
rent special-fee refund system
and -plit the undergraduate and
graduate communities into two
separate voting groups.
A simpler proposal
Senators are currently debat
ing the best method to imple
ment systematic changes with
the refund system. Piecemeal
ideas as well as a comprehensive
plan have both been discussed.
Kasrawi admitted that,
although many separate bills
"might be the only way we can go
forward ... this would not be the
most ideal way to reform the sys
tem."
Separate proposals would pro
mote a chaotic and unstable gov
ernment, Kasrawi said. Ideally,
the senate will reform the entire
system, he said, adding that
"basically, we need to put togeth
er a system that all students can
live with."
Undergraduate senator Andre
Vanier agreed that many sepa
rate proposals would not be the
most ideal way to reform the sys
tem "1 just can't envision how
you would do a systematic
change piece-by-piece," he said.

Vanier added that a simpler,
comprehensive bill that focused
on splitting the undergraduate
and graduate vote would be the
ideal way to propose a reform.
Splitting the two, he said, would
solve many of the problems the
Balanced Funding Deal was
designed to address. He also said
that this type of comprehensive
bill would probably garner stu
dent support.
"Opposition mobilized around
fee refunds," Vanier said. "If we
could tackle splitting classes and
preserving refunds, I think we
could easily get the two-thirds we
need."
Some students have echoed
Vanier's ideas. Aaron Padilla, co
coordinator for Students for
Environmental Action at Stan
ford, which lost its special fee
last spring, said he believes that
SEAS's special-fee loss was due
primarily to the fact that many
graduate students voted against
the group.
"We're mainly an undergrad
uate group, although we're open
to the whole campus," he said. "I
think that the split between
undergraduate and graduate
groups would have helped us the
most."
Padilla also said that he would
like to maintain the current
refund system, because students
should be able to refund their

fees in order to object to groups
they oppose.
"Maybe, in the future, a bill
that would split the undergradu
ate and graduate vote and main
tain the current system would be
the best solution," he said. "It
might be more effective to propose
a lot of smaller reforms, or at least
have one bill that is simpler in
nature than the [previous bill)."
ASSU undergraduate senator
Steve Russell said with the fail
ure of the Balanced Funding
Deal, the senate must devise a
bill that balances the interests of
student groups while still main
taining student fee refunds.
Russell emphasized his opin
ion that "students have a right to
fee refunds," adding that he also
is in favor of splitting the gradu
ate and undergraduate vote.
Vague plans for the future
Although the bill failed, Kas
rawi said the debate continues
regarding what refund system
would best serve the students.
Proponents of reform, however,
have few specific plans as of yet,
with solutions to change the sys
tem still in the early planning
stages.
Whether or not fee refunds
are a student right or a detri
mental aspect of the constitution
divides many in the ASSU.
"The senate needs to get away

from scare tactics," Russell said.
"We should create a bill that
reforms in a positive way, and I
hope that a bill will be intro
duced by the spring elections."
While some, like Russell,
believe that the ability to refund
special fees is an inherent right
of the student body, others
believe that fee refunds actually
affect students negatively. Scott
Moss, director of the ASSU
Speaker's Bureau, said that he
believes taking away funds from
student groups detracts from
campus diversity and richness as
a whole.
"At best, I think the senate
should scrap the current refund
system entirely," Moss said.
"Everyone would benefit from a
stable system — we don't have
that now with the current refund
system."
Moss added, however, that he
did not believe that the issue of
fee refunds was the decisive fac
tor in the failure of the Balanced
Funding Deal. Instead, he said,
the complexity of the bill caused
students to vote it down without
understanding its implications.
"Also, the campaign for the
'no' side and the media's support
of that side really took away from
support for the bill," Moss said.
"Both The Daily and the Review
rejected the bill — when The
Daily and the Review agree on

something, the effect is very
powerful."
The lack of student support,
Moss said, shows the general
mistrust of the ASSU among the
student body. He pointed out
that the majority of freshmen
and sophomores voted in favor of
the bill, while most juniors and
seniors did not.
"I think that this just goes to
show that the longer students
are here, the more likely they are
to not trust the ASSU — it's a
general mistrust of government
in society," he said.
Russell said that the bill's fail
ure resulted from"the simple
fact that it had no student sup
port. Constitution reform takes
genuine, grass-roots support
from the students, and this
didn't have any grass roots sup
port."
However, some student
groups, especially those that lost
their special fees in the voting
last April, supported the mea
sure. Johnathon Briggs, one of
the media coordinators for the
Black Community Services Cen
ter, said that he is disappointed
that the bill did not pass.
"We didn't get our special fee
last year because not enough stu
dents voted, although the major
ity voted to give us money," Brig
gs said. "The bill would have
remedied that situation."

Briggs added that he hopes
that another, similar bill will be
proposed for the spring elections.
"The status quo is not working,"
he said. "If the majority of stu
dents that vote say that a group
that is doing significant things
should get money, they should
get it. I also think that the
undergraduate and graduate
vote should be split."
Voter participation
The 25 percent voter turnout
for this special election was con
sidered to be fairly large, Council
of Presidents member Mork
Murdock said. He added, howev
er, that he did not believe that
the issue of voter turnout is crit
ical in looking to a future elec
tion in April.
"I think this was a very strong
voter turnout, considering the
issue was very focused," Mur
dock said. "Although there will
probably be a greater turnout in
the general election, I don't
think it will greatly affect this
particular issue."
Kasrawi said that the effect a
new bill would have on the gen
eral election is difficult to pre
dict. "It would probably interact
with the general election, but
we've had many amendments
proposed in past general elec
tions, so I don't really know what
the effect would be."
With the recent narrow failure of the Balanced
Funding Deal, the future of the fee-refund system re
mains uncertain.

of that side really took away from
support for the bill," Moss said.
"Both The Daily and the Review
rejected the bill — when The
Daily and the Review agree on

something, the effect is very
powerful."
The lack of student support,
Moss said, shows the general
mistrust of the ASSU among the
student body. He pointed out
that the majority of freshmen
and sophomores voted in favor of
the bill, while most juniors and
seniors did not.
"I think that this just goes to
show that the longer students
are here, the more likely they are
to not trust the ASSU — it's a
general mistrust of government
in society," he said.
Russell said that the bill's fail
ure resulted from"the simple
fact that it had no student sup
port. Constitution reform takes
genuine, grass-roots support
from the students, and this
didn't have any grass roots sup
port."
However, some student
groups, especially those that lost
their special fees in the voting
last April, supported the mea
sure. Johnathon Briggs, one of
the media coordinators for the
Black Community Services Cen
ter, said that he is disappointed
that the bill did not pass.
"We didn't get our special fee
last year because not enough stu
dents voted, although the major
ity voted to give us money," Brig
gs said. "The bill would have
remedied that situation."

Briggs added that he hopes
that another, similar bill will be
proposed for the spring elections.
"The status quo is not working,"
he said. "If the majority of stu
dents that vote say that a group
that is doing significant things
should get money, they should
get it. I also think that the
undergraduate and graduate
vote should be split."
Voter participation
The 25 percent voter turnout
for this special election was con
sidered to be fairly large, Council
of Presidents member Mork
Murdock said. He added, howev
er, that he did not believe that
the issue of voter turnout is crit
ical in looking to a future elec
tion in April.
"I think this was a very strong
voter turnout, considering the
issue was very focused," Mur
dock said. "Although there will
probably be a greater turnout in
the general election, I don't
think it will greatly affect this
particular issue."
Kasrawi said that the effect a
new bill would have on the gen
eral election is difficult to pre
dict. "It would probably interact
with the general election, but
we've had many amendments
proposed in past general elec
tions, so I don't really know what
the effect would be."
With the recent narrow failure of the Balanced
Funding Deal, the future of the fee-refund system re
mains uncertain.
While some members of the ASSU said they have
tentative plans to propose another bill for the gener
al ASSU election in April, debate is already beginning
on what that proposed should contain.
"I would assume that there will be another bill
proposed for the spring elections, most likely for the
general election," said Senate Chair Nawwar Kas
rawi. "Something will come through the senate."
Kasrawi also said that those who proposed and
supported the Balanced Funding Deal will begin to
work on an alternative as soon as possible.
"There probably will be many competing propos
als on the ballot in the spring, especially given the di
versity of opinion on the 'no' side," Kasrawi said. "Ei
ther that, or there may be many proposals addressing
separately the components" of the amendment.
The senate is not under any time crunch, Kasrawi
said, adding that if any new bills are introduced they
would not have to be finalized until about the first
week of spring quarter. Currently, all plans for new
proposals to reform the refund system are tentative,
he said.
"The issue of when a constitutional change can be
applied is something the senate will have to look at,"
Kasrawi said. It is a possibility that, if a bill is passed
in the general election, it could go into effect as early
as next year, but he added that it is impossible to pre
dict now.
The Balanced Funding Deal proposed, among
other changes, to abolish the cur
rent special-fee refund system
and -plit the undergraduate and
graduate communities into two
separate voting groups.
A simpler proposal
Senators are currently debat
ing the best method to imple
ment systematic changes with
the refund system. Piecemeal
ideas as well as a comprehensive
plan have both been discussed.
Kasrawi admitted that,
although many separate bills
"might be the only way we can go
forward ... this would not be the
most ideal way to reform the sys
tem."
Separate proposals would pro
mote a chaotic and unstable gov
ernment, Kasrawi said. Ideally,
the senate will reform the entire
system, he said, adding that
"basically, we need to put togeth
er a system that all students can
live with."
Undergraduate senator Andre
Vanier agreed that many sepa
rate proposals would not be the
most ideal way to reform the sys
tem "1 just can't envision how
you would do a systematic
change piece-by-piece," he said.

Vanier added that a simpler,
comprehensive bill that focused
on splitting the undergraduate
and graduate vote would be the
ideal way to propose a reform.
Splitting the two, he said, would
solve many of the problems the
Balanced Funding Deal was
designed to address. He also said
that this type of comprehensive
bill would probably garner stu
dent support.
"Opposition mobilized around
fee refunds," Vanier said. "If we
could tackle splitting classes and
preserving refunds, I think we
could easily get the two-thirds we
need."
Some students have echoed
Vanier's ideas. Aaron Padilla, co
coordinator for Students for
Environmental Action at Stan
ford, which lost its special fee
last spring, said he believes that
SEAS's special-fee loss was due
primarily to the fact that many
graduate students voted against
the group.
"We're mainly an undergrad
uate group, although we're open
to the whole campus," he said. "I
think that the split between
undergraduate and graduate
groups would have helped us the
most."
Padilla also said that he would
like to maintain the current
refund system, because students
should be able to refund their

fees in order to object to groups
they oppose.
"Maybe, in the future, a bill
that would split the undergradu
ate and graduate vote and main
tain the current system would be
the best solution," he said. "It
might be more effective to propose
a lot of smaller reforms, or at least
have one bill that is simpler in
nature than the [previous bill)."
ASSU undergraduate senator
Steve Russell said with the fail
ure of the Balanced Funding
Deal, the senate must devise a
bill that balances the interests of
student groups while still main
taining student fee refunds.
Russell emphasized his opin
ion that "students have a right to
fee refunds," adding that he also
is in favor of splitting the gradu
ate and undergraduate vote.
Vague plans for the future
Although the bill failed, Kas
rawi said the debate continues
regarding what refund system
would best serve the students.
Proponents of reform, however,
have few specific plans as of yet,
with solutions to change the sys
tem still in the early planning
stages.
Whether or not fee refunds
are a student right or a detri
mental aspect of the constitution
divides many in the ASSU.
"The senate needs to get away

from scare tactics," Russell said.
"We should create a bill that
reforms in a positive way, and I
hope that a bill will be intro
duced by the spring elections."
While some, like Russell,
believe that the ability to refund
special fees is an inherent right
of the student body, others
believe that fee refunds actually
affect students negatively. Scott
Moss, director of the ASSU
Speaker's Bureau, said that he
believes taking away funds from
student groups detracts from
campus diversity and richness as
a whole.
"At best, I think the senate
should scrap the current refund
system entirely," Moss said.
"Everyone would benefit from a
stable system — we don't have
that now with the current refund
system."
Moss added, however, that he
did not believe that the issue of
fee refunds was the decisive fac
tor in the failure of the Balanced
Funding Deal. Instead, he said,
the complexity of the bill caused
students to vote it down without
understanding its implications.
"Also, the campaign for the
'no' side and the media's support
of that side really took away from
support for the bill," Moss said.
"Both The Daily and the Review
rejected the bill — when The
Daily and the Review agree on
