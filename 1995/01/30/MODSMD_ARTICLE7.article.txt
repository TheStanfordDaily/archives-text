Looking to improve relations and be

eral members of the Board of Trustees will
take time for dinner in dorm dining halls
next Monday.
Members of the board — a governing
body that votes on all University policies —
will eat dinner at 10 student residences, a
chance for students and trustees to get to
know each other better, said Vice Provost

The dinner "gives students an opportu

also gives trustees an idea of what students

Muwekma-tah-ruk, Manzanita Park (Kim

fraternity, 553 Mayfield and Wilbur Hall
East have been selected as host dorms. Two
trustees will be assigned to each dorm, and

two will dine with graduate
students at The Buttery.
John Rickford, resident
fellow at Kimball, said the
dinners give students a
"rare opportunity to learn
from people who are lead
ers. These people often
have such richly interest
ing lives. I think it's good
for them to sit and talk."

"It also gives students a chance to voice
their concerns," added Rickford. Trustees,
he said, often only hear of students' views
through faculty members.
"It's a good opportunity [for students] to
pass on directly their opinions, with all the
fervor and strength that they have about
these things," Rickford said.
Trustee James Ukropina, who has par

he enjoys the direct contact with students.
"I believe they're a wonderful opportu
