# To reach out to students, trustees dining in dorms
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
Looking to improve relations and be
come better acquainted with students, sev
eral members of the Board of Trustees will
take time for dinner in dorm dining halls
next Monday.
Members of the board — a governing
body that votes on all University policies —
will eat dinner at 10 student residences, a
chance for students and trustees to get to
know each other better, said Vice Provost
and Dean for Student Affairs Mary Ed
monds.
The dinner "gives students an opportu
nity to find out more about the trustees —
who they are, what they do," she said. "It
also gives trustees an idea of what students
think."
Alondra, Okada, Casa Zapata, Ujamaa,
Muwekma-tah-ruk, Manzanita Park (Kim
ball, Lantana and Castano), Kappa Sigma
fraternity, 553 Mayfield and Wilbur Hall
East have been selected as host dorms. Two
trustees will be assigned to each dorm, and

two will dine with graduate
students at The Buttery.
John Rickford, resident
fellow at Kimball, said the
dinners give students a
"rare opportunity to learn
from people who are lead
ers. These people often
have such richly interest
ing lives. I think it's good
for them to sit and talk."

"It also gives students a chance to voice
their concerns," added Rickford. Trustees,
he said, often only hear of students' views
through faculty members.
"It's a good opportunity [for students] to
pass on directly their opinions, with all the
fervor and strength that they have about
these things," Rickford said.
Trustee James Ukropina, who has par
ticipated in two past trustee dinners, said
he enjoys the direct contact with students.
"I believe they're a wonderful opportu
nity to become better acquainted with stu-


Edmonds
dents and to find out what's on
their minds," Ukropina said of
the dinner. "I think they're
tremendous fun."
Because the dinners coincide
with board meetings, the trustees
are able to then discuss what they
hear from students.
"We exchange views on the
University and its programs, con
cerns and issues," Ukropina said.
"One issue I remember dis
cussing is the proposal that the
undergrad program might be con
tained in a three-year term
instead of a four-year term," he
said. "I had dinner with six stu
dents — two were enthusiastic,
two were unenthusiastic and two
were undecided.
"It gave us and the students
the opportunity to discuss that
situation in a different setting. It
makes the students feel like
they're being heard," he added.
"In fact, at the trustees' meeting
the next day, we discussed what
the students had told us."

"Board members really want to
hear from students," said
Edmonds, adding "It was the
board which asked for [the din
ner]."
Dinners with students are "part
of the trustees' agenda," she said.
"That's nice because it makes the
dinner much more official."
Because trustees are "not as vis
ible as other players in the Univer
sity," said Okada RF Derek Miya
hara, the dinners give students the
chance to "find out who is respon
sible for the long term health of the
University and expand their
understanding of who is a part of
the Stanford community.
"It's got to be good for both
groups," he said.
During their five or six meet
ings a year, the trustees follow
busy schedules, Ukropina said.
Because of this, one dinner a year
is all that's possible.
"There isn't as much time as
we'd like to do what we want to
do," Ukropina said. "I'd like to do
dinners more frequently, but I
think our schedule really pre
cludes it."
"I'm glad we do have an oppor
tunity to do it,"he added.
