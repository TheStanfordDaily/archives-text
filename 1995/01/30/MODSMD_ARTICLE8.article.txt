# Opened competition lowers phone rates to N. California
## Possibility of higher base rate because of drop 
### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
Stanford students may have something
to cheer about when they get their phone
bills this week — if they happen to make a
lot of calls to the northern coast of Califor
nia.
The new rates, which went into effect
Dec. 22, affect calls placed in a region
which stretches from San Jose to the
Oregon Border, said Maureen Trimm,
assistant director of Communication
Services.
Depending on how many local calls a
telephone user makes, the new rates will
probably affect students in different ways.
According to Trimm, unless a student
"makes hours of calls to Eureka," the lower
rates probably will not make much of a
dent in their phone bills.
The cheaper rates are the result of a
Jan. 1 ruling by the California Public Util

ities Commission, which opened up local
phone services to competition from outside
carriers, including long distance compa
nies like AT&T and MCI.
Although the commission opened up
competition to bring down telephone rates,
it also allowed Pacific Bell, previously the
only carrier in the region and Stanford's
local service provider, to raise its monthly
service charges.
For now, Stanford's basic service charge
of $11 is not likely to increase because of
Pacific Bell's higher fees. The basic service
fee, Trimm said, is the result of "negotiat
ing the best bulk deals."
But the fee will probably change in the
future, Trimm said. After the current aca
demic year is over, Communication Ser
vices will likely have to raise its basic
charge to meet Pacific Bell's higher month
ly service charges, she said.
That could mean a higher basic service
charge as early as the summer,
Trimm said. However, Commu
nication Services is actively nego
tiating to get the best possible
pricing for Stanford telephone
users.
Stanford's monthly service
charge has been lowered twice
since 1989, resulting in a total

savings of more than 12 percent.
Local rates in the northern
California region, according to
Trimm, are "likely ... to drop
again," as Pacific Bell and long
distance carriers compete in the
upcoming months.
Communication Services is
including an insert in this
month's phone bill to explain the
new changes in local call rates.
On the current phone bill, this
region is described by zones Band
C.
