Strategies for Standardized Tests in a Diverse World
Strategy # 7: Look for Patterns
Most test-taken consider multiple-choice questions one at a time and
evaluate each option independently. Yet multiple-choice tests are
standardized so comparable students get the same score on different tests.
Testing for the Public teaches you to recognize the patterns that recur on
different forms of the same test. Soon you'll be telling yourself that you've
