## Physicians get a chance to study children in their natural habitat

Children come to pediatric residents
at Stanford Medical Center every day.
But now through a Residency Training
Program elective, some residents are
going to the children.
"A Prescription for Learning," an
elective for Stanford pediatric resi
dents, focuses on getting residents out
of a clinical environment and allows
them to observe and interact with the
every day lives of healthy children in
local public schools.

"The goal is to have our pediatric
residents see children in their natural
habitat," said Charles Prober — profes
sor of pediatrics and "Prescription" co
founder — who added that many chil
dren spend more time in school than
with their parents.
"Usually [residents] only see chil
dren in the hospital .. . when they're
not well," said Prober, who developed
the program with Pediatric Residency
Program Director Ted Sectish, Asst.
Prof, of Pediatrics Elisa Zenni and
fifth-grade teacher Brad Martin of
Menlo Park's La Entrada School.

Currently in its second year, the pro
gram now involves seven residents and
five area schools in Atherton, Menlo
Park, Redwood City, and East Palo
Alto.
Each resident spends one three
week rotation among the schools,
working with teachers and students to
supplement lesson plans as well as to do
some learning of their own.
"Typically [the residents! spend half
a day preparing and talking to their fac
ulty mentor (usually Dr. Zenni) and
