## Physicians get a chance to study children in their natural habitat 
### Karen Heywood Staff writer 
Children come to pediatric residents
at Stanford Medical Center every day.
But now through a Residency Training
Program elective, some residents are
going to the children.
"A Prescription for Learning," an
elective for Stanford pediatric resi
dents, focuses on getting residents out
of a clinical environment and allows
them to observe and interact with the
every day lives of healthy children in
local public schools.

"The goal is to have our pediatric
residents see children in their natural
habitat," said Charles Prober — profes
sor of pediatrics and "Prescription" co
founder — who added that many chil
dren spend more time in school than
with their parents.
"Usually [residents] only see chil
dren in the hospital .. . when they're
not well," said Prober, who developed
the program with Pediatric Residency
Program Director Ted Sectish, Asst.
Prof, of Pediatrics Elisa Zenni and
fifth-grade teacher Brad Martin of
Menlo Park's La Entrada School.

Currently in its second year, the pro
gram now involves seven residents and
five area schools in Atherton, Menlo
Park, Redwood City, and East Palo
Alto.
Each resident spends one three
week rotation among the schools,
working with teachers and students to
supplement lesson plans as well as to do
some learning of their own.
"Typically [the residents! spend half
a day preparing and talking to their fac
ulty mentor (usually Dr. Zenni) and

half a day in school," Prober said.
The classroom experience is
varied and fast-paced, according to
Lilia Coppa, a resident who took
part in the program this year.
She highlighted "lots of inter
active play," including activities
surrounding such topics as diges
tion, nutrition and the circulatory
system — which culminated in
the dissection of a real human
heart for a fifth-grade class.
"I was impressed with what
the children knew, and the
sophistication of their questions,"
Coppa said.
Very few children were uncom
fortable with the dissection, she
said, and "apparently the class
still talks about it — they want
even more anatomy!"
Coppa also cited "some delicate
things" during her rotation, such
as taking part in the mainstream
ing of a child with Downs-syn

drome into a standard fourth
grade class. Part of her job was
talking to the class about the dis
ease and helping to prepare them
to deal with it, she said.
Her own learning experience
with "A Prescription for Learn
ing" included observing how cer
tain teachers engage children and
the psychology that they use in
interacting with them, she said.
The program originated when
Prober's daughter was a student
in Martin's fifth-grade class at La
Entrada School. Both Prober and
Martin saw benefits in bringing
doctors, teachers and students
together.
"Some of the information
[about health and science] float
ing around the public school sys
tem these days is a little outdat
ed," Prober said, adding that the
residents in the classrooms can
help shed light on such inconsis
tencies.
According to Martin, children
are also responsive to doctors as
authority figures, "especially
about safety and health issues."

The program also gives children
beyond-the-classroom resources to
help them solve "real world prob
lems," Martin said.
For example, he posed to his
fifth-grade class the hypothetical
situation that the earth would be
incapable of supporting life in two
years. The students proposed pos
sible solutions to the problem —
such as transporting humans to
Mars — and then consulted resi
dents on logistics.
"The physicians talked about
the effects of space travel on
humans, as well as things like
nutrition," Martin said.
Zenni — program coordinator
for "A Prescription for Learning"
and faculty mentor for most of the
residents involved — said the pro
gram has already expanded from
one school and four residents
when it started last year to five
schools and seven residents this
year.
Although there are currently
no definite plans for more expan
sion, Zenni said she would like to
see the program evolve into a

"more longitudinal experience" —
for instance assigning every resi
dent to a specific class or school at
the beginning of residency, and
maintaining regular contact.
Meanwhile, she said, the pro
gram is a success.
"The residents go into this
thinking it will be a fun chance to
work with children in a different
way, but they look back and feel
they learned more than they
expected to learn," she said.
She said another goal of the
program is "to improve and
enhance communication between
pediatricians and teachers for the
benefit of children."
After exposure to a real school
setting, pediatricians may be
more likely to consult teachers
about certain cases than the
might otherwise, she said.
"It's a three-way experience
[for residents, teachers and stu
dents]" added Coppa.
"Some residents are lucky
enough to have children of their
own, but those of us who don't
can benefit from [this program]."
