## Simpson opening statement resumes 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - OJ. Simp
son's defense picked up its disrupted
opening statement yesterday with sug
gestions of missing blood, contaminated
socks and an image of Simpson chipping
golf balls into his children's sandbox at
the hour he is accused of committing
murder.
Attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr.
declared his celebrity defendant was
"entitled to an acquittal."
Moments before Cochran resumed
his presentation, interrupted last
Wednesday, Superior Court Judge
Lance Ito rebuked him for hiding wit
nesses and admonished jurors to ignore
much of what he said last week as viola
tions of law.
In an unusual move, Ito also said he
would allow the prosecution to briefly
reopen its opening statement to address
the defense transgressions.

The jurors listened intently as Ito
instructed them to disregard Cochran's
descriptions of six witnesses, including a
woman who said she saw four men flee
ing the area of the murders.
Cochran yesterday turned his focus
from eyewitnesses to what he termed
the sloppy work of inept investigators
who polluted evidence so badly it made
DNA testing meaningless.
"The evidence will be shown to be
contaminated, compromised and cor
rupted," Cochran said. "The gathering
of evidence was a complete disaster."
Cochran.also offered for the first
time a firm alibi for Simpson, saying he
was "chipping in the front yard" or
swinging a three wood or four wood at
about 10:10 p.m., shortly after telephon
ing his girlfriend from his Bronco.
Prosecutors have said they believe
Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman

were murdered at about 10:15 p.m.
Cochran didn't explain why Simpson
would go outside to make a phone call or
how he was able to swing a golf club at a
time when, as Cochran said last week,
Simpson was suffering arthritis pain so
severe he could not shuffle a pack of
playing cards.
"He did not, would not, could not, in
the time frame, commit these particular
killings," Cochran said.
Hammering away at the handling of
evidence, Cochran said the lead investi
gator carried a vial of Simpson's blood in
his pocket for hours, taking it from
police headquarters to Simpson's estate
about 20 miles away rather than refrig
erating it at the crime lab.
Now, Cochran asserted, not all of the
blood withdrawn from Simpson's arm
the day after his ex-wife's slaying can be
accounted for.
