Car bomb in Algeria
ALGIERS, Algiers (AP) — In the worst
bombing of a 3-year Muslim insurgency,
an explosives-packed car blew up yester
day along a street bustling with pedestri
ans preparing for Ramadan. At least 38
people were killed and 256 wounded,
state TV said.
The bomb went off in a downtown
commercial district near the main post
office and train station. Businesses were
particularly crowded in anticipation of
the monthlong holiday.
There was no claim of responsibility.
The security forces blamed "criminals"
— the official term for fundamentalist
guerrillas seeking to topple the army
backed government and install an Islam
ic state.

Terrorists on trial
NEW YORK (AP) — A Muslim cleric and 11
disciples plotted to blow up the United Nations,
the FBI and bridges and tunnels in a single day
of mayhem "the likes of which the world has
never seen," a prosecutor told jurors yesterday.
"They planned to slaughter people as they
traveled between New York and New Jersey or
sat in office buildings while there were ticking
time bombs underground," Assistant U.S.
Attorney Robert Khuzami said as the biggest
terrorism trial in American history got under
way with opening statements.
The blind cleric, Omar Abdel-Rahman,
chuckled as the government outlined its case
for the jury.
Prosecutors said the day of mass bloodshed
was intended to punish the United States for
its support of Israel and Egypt.
