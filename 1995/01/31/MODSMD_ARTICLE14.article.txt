Ask Stanford's use of
Pub Board funds was
unethical, misleading

JUST BECAUSE you can do
something doesn't mean you
should do it.
This seems especially true when
considering the recent debate over
the funding of the Ask Stanford
newsletter.
This fall Ask Stanford was
formed by Associated Student
Consulting, a group headed by
ASSU Undergraduate Senator
Stephen Russell, who is also a
founding member of the ASSU's
new party — Student's Alliance.
When applying to the Publica
tions Board for funding, an Associ
ated Student Consulting member
wrote, "Our newsletter will feature
in depth analysis of campus news
and events, guide students
through the quagmire of universi
ty politics and forms, as well as
inform concerned students how to
get involved through the ASSU."
The member added that the group
planned "to publish at least four
times (fall) quarter." There was no
mention of the publication being
involved with a political party of
any kind.
Yet when Ask Stanford made its
first appearance on campus last
Wednesday — and called itself a
"publication of Student's Alliance
and Associated Students Consult
ing" — it was almost entirely ded
icated to denouncing the Balanced
Funding Deal, the ASSU amend
ment to redesign the special-fee
system on which students were
voting. With the newsletter's wide
distribution, the anti-amendment
camp received a considerable
push.
Proponents of the amendment
cried foul, claiming Associated Stu
dents Consulting misrepresented
its intentions to the Pub Board in
order to receive funds for a Stu

dent's Alliance newsletter. And
although it seems there were no
violations of the Pub Board bylaws
made by Associated Students Con
sulting, the group's actions were
definitely unethical.
In addition, the fact that the
newsletter never appeared fall
quarter and read more like propa
ganda than anything when it final
ly arrived on election day demon
strates extremely poor judgment
by Associated Students Consult
ing, and Russell in particular.
The Senate Appropriations
Committee, after deciding that Ask
Stanford did not break any laws
but broke "the spirit of the law,"
decided to recommend funding for
the newsletter.
In addition to the ethical issues
surrounding the newsletter, there
are questions of hypocrisy. Earlier
in the quarter, Russell had been
one of the prime opponents of the
Council of Presidents' plan to use
their discretionary funds to pay for
a campaign for the Balanced Fund
ing Deal.
After it became clear that the
COP could not use their funds
unless equal funds were provided
for the amendment's opposition,
the COP decided against funding
the pro-campaign. It is hypocritical
of Student's Alliance then to use
ASSU funds for a newsletter
opposing the amendment.
This whole debacle is just anoth
er example of how ugly campus
politics has become. Mudslinging
between People's Platform and
Student's Alliance should end and
work on relevant issues should
begin, starting with reforms to a
special-fee system that students
will approve.
As the ASSU Senate takes up
the Ask Stanford issue, it has the
potential to become a political
nightmare as both sides bicker
about related questions. For the
good of everybody involved, Associ
ated Students Consulting should
return all funding to the ASSU for
Ask Stanford and apologize for
misleading the ASSU.
