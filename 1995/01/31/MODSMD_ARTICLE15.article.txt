COP and ASSU Senate exacerbated Pub Board quagmire

I never thought the COP or the ASSU
Senate did anything except pack
their resumes. Twice now, I have
been proved wrong. I have always
thought that these two groups were
merely spewing the rhetoric of doing
"what the Stanford people want." Twice
now, I have been proved right. Besides
packing their resumes and getting their
pictures in the Daily, the COP and sen
ate also find time to interfere in places
where they are not needed, while
remaining largely uninformed or misin
formed about the issues on which they
vote.
I am speaking in particular about the
ongoing babble concerning Publications
Board space allocation in the Storke Stu
dent Publications Building. And though
I am frustrated by the actions of the
COP and senate, they have merely acted
as pawns of the Stanford Chapparal.
The Chappie has impressed me with
their ability to persuade the COP to
demand the resignation of the Pub
Board Director last quarter and with
their mobilization of their alumni to
freak out the administration, and there
by entangle the Office of Student Activi
ties in the whole affair. So we now have
the COP, the ASSU Senate, the Office of
Student Activities and the Publications
Board all fretting about some space in
some building that most students don't

even know about (let alone care about).
With all of these players, you would
think the issue was complex. It's not.
Here's the gist of it: The Chappie
(and the other three campus publica
tions at the time) spent a lot of money in
1963 to help build the Storke Building
on the condition that they would retain
a certain amount of space in the build
ing. In 1983, the senate passed a bill
that allowed for the reallocation of
space. All of the other original publica
tions have allowed for the reallocation of
their space. Though there are now 20
publications on campus, the Chappie
maintains the same space as when there
were only four. The Chappie holds four
rooms at Storke while the other 19 pub
lications share one. When asked at last
November's Publications Board meeting
why the Chappie needed that much
space (about three quarters of the
upstairs), they replied that the other
publications "might not understand, but
it takes a certain kind of ambiance to
create humor." Apparently, it takes a lot
of space and damage to create humor too
(the Chappie's damage to Storke facili
ties has been considerable).
Considering that we now have five
times the number of publications on
campus, the Chappie only publishes
once (maybe twice) per quarter, and the
most recent ASSU bill passed allows for

the reallocation of space by the Publica
tions Board, you would think that the
Pub Board could reallocate that space
more effectively. Well, it could and it
did. Last November, the Publications
Board voted 10 to 1 (with the Daily and
two of the groups that came up with the
bill abstaining) in support of a space
reallocation bill. And that should have
been the end of it.
Here is where I turn to the two events
that enlightened me about the COP and
the ASSU Senate. The COP, along with
the senate chair, effectively crashed last
November's Publications Board meeting.
For once, they didn't gloss over their
intentions with rhetoric: they informed a
baffled board that the decisions of the
meeting would be moot, that they would
make a motion for the director's dis
missal by the senate, and that COP
member Anietie Ekanem would become
the interim director, even though he had
no qualifications for the position. In
short, the COP along with some muscle
from the senate chair, knew (and would
enforce) what was best for a group they
knew nothing about. After aggressive
lobbying by the Pub Board (less the
Chappie), the COP mysteriously dropped
the motion before the next day's Senate
meeting. Three days later, Nanci Howe
overrode the Pub Board allocations deci
sion "in order to give the Chappie time to

appeal." Now, almost two months later,
the Chappie has stalled the implementa
tion of the reallocation bill by lobbying
for the creation of a senate committee to
review Pub Board by-laws and space
reallocation.
It is ridiculous that this has even
come this far. The Publications Board
was established so that the publications
would have control over the allocation of
space that they would use. The only
publication that disagrees with the space
reallocation is the Chappie. Yet the
actions of the COP, the ASSU and the
mysterious involvement of the adminis
tration has turned a fair, democratic
process into a political field day. Though
it might be difficult for the COP, the
ASSU Senate and the Office of Student
Activities to understand, the Publica
tions Board does not need their interfer
ence. If these groups don't respect Pub
Board decisions, just revoke all of our
rights to make decisions ... but don't
say you are making an informed decision
for the common good. It has been diffi
cult to write this because the actions of
these groups have been so preposterous
and unnecessary; yet I am afraid that
the only way for these antics to stop is to
point out their insanity.
