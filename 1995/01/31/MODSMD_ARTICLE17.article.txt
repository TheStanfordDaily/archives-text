## When two realities meet 
### 
WRITING THIS COLUMN has
really brought out my
schizophrenic self. I fluctuate on
an hourly basis between idealist and real
ist, and sometimes that transition occurs
in mid-column, providing for some tortu
ous (yet I hope interesting) perspectives.
Overall, my angst over the decision to
consider my personal glass half-full or
half-empty has been strangely fulfilling.
It's a pain and pleasure thing, and I guess
I prefer it to an exclusive alternative.
I don't really have a choice in the mat
ter, however, at least not while I remain
at Stanford (which means not for a long
time). Inevitably, Stanford feeds my joy
for life as well as my cynicism, and that's
strangely addictive. There are so many
beautiful and diverse people, so many
warm hearts, such dedication to laudable
goals and that California sunshine (for
get this winter). Generally, that's what I
see and it's that positive energy which
feeds me.
And then there's the dark side.
There's the stolen bike, the vandalized
statue, the drunk fraternity punk.
There's the grossly inappropriate stereo
type, and there's the subtle yet unneces
sary insult. I wander around campus,
bombarded with these conflicting images,
and I don't know what to make of them.
Then I sit down confused and try to write
my column, which each week ultimately
condenses to the following: I am both
amazed and perplexed by the frenzy of
life I see. There seems to be a fantastic

array of collisions between "good" and
"bad" energy, and I'm trying to figure
out which team is ahead. I'm still asking
that question.
I have always hoped that my studies
will shed some light on this. That may be
my biggest mistake. There are course
offerings here in almost everything imag
inable, yet there's also a big void. Call it
REAL LIFE 101 or whatever you like. As
much as I love this place, I realize that
Stanford is extremely sheltered.
Academia, with all its laboratories,
libraries and lecture halls can explain
anything and simultaneously explain
nothing. I think its greatest benefit is to
remind you exactly what you don't
understand, so that you can focus your
spiritual energy on that discovery.
Still, I get progressively more frustrat
ed at the dead ends of my search for
truth, and my dual personality takes one
of two tacks. The first option is a won
derfully long laugh which embraces the
absurdity of my worked-up state. I think
of the billions of brain cells firing all over
campus and realize that my perception is
just a mere blip on the radar screen of
twisted thoughts. I realize how unlikely it
is that I can resolve any of the questions
that have plagued thinkers for centuries.
I think how transient my existence is,
and I remind myself to enjoy some of it
before it's too late. Continuing to grin as
I forget my grueling internal dialogue, I
opt for a carefree night out with friends.
The unbearable lightness of being. It

feels good.
However, my second option is to
plunge into the cynical abyss. In this
state of consciousness, I construct
hypotheses of an upcoming apocalypse.
Obsessed with conspiracy theories, I am
suspicious of everything I see, and I con
fide in no one. Ln such a state of mind, my
dreary forecast is every bit as real as the
bliss of partying with friends. My fear is
tangible inside me and I respect it. I
accept it.
Ultimately, both realities are equally
valid. The world abounds with evil, and
we may ultimately destroy ourselves. It's
easy enough to support that argument
with a pile of dire newspaper headings or
a late-night walk through inner-city
streets. At the same time, the world is
magical and good, and we are all eternal.
Examples supporting this positive per
spective are just as abundant. And so I
allow both views to fade in and out of my
consciousness as they may, neither more
"real" than the other. I am grateful for
the two contrasting perspectives, and
they've both contributed to this column.
As far as the struggle of good versus evil,
this seems more a cop-out than a resolu
tion, but it's where I currently stand.
Next week I may think something differ
ent. You'll never know unless you ask me.

Chris Carlsten would like to thank Phil
for being beautiful and for his recognition
of the futility in pursuing ethics.
