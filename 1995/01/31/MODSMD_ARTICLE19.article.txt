IMMIGRATION POLICY
HAS been waiting in the
wings for years to become the
nation's next hot-button issue.
In California, tensions over
immigration culminated last
year in the debate over Proposi
tion 187, a ballot measure aimed
at denying social services to
undocumented immigrants.
Prop. 187 ignited a powder keg of
controversy; advocates and sup
porters of the measure mobilized
in large numbers, drawing out
heated emotions across the state.
On Nov. 8, all eyes were on Cali
fornia as voters passed Prop. 187
by a wide margin.

Since Election Day, immigra
tion fever has spread beyond the
state. Though it has never been
an entirely cool issue, the debate
now seems to have reached a boil.
A nation founded on immigra
tion and opportunity is now
clamoring over the problems
they say today's immigrants —
legal and illegal — are creating
by committing crime and drain
ing domestic jobs and social ser
vices benefits. Others point out
that immigrants contribute
more to the nation than they
take away — the debate, they
say, is less a question of eco
nomics than of race-baiting and

scapegoating.
As the argument rages on, the
nation's leaders are listening.
Republican leaders in Congress
have since made overtures at,
among other measures, eliminat
ing federal mandates for social
services and denying social ser
vices to legal and illegal immi
grants. Democrats, too, are fol
lowing the tide — President Clin
ton's State of the Union Address
last week paid special attention
to the perceived problem of ille
gal immigration:
"We are a nation of immi
grants," Clinton said, "but we
are also a nation of laws. It is

wrong and ultimately self-defeat
ing for a nation of immigrants to
permit the kind of abuse of our
immigration laws we have seen
in recent years."
But as the furor over immi
gration polarizes the nation,
Americans risk the error of
breaking a complex issue into a
black-and-white decision. To
help sort through the subtleties
of one of the most heated topics
of the day, The Daily asked three
experts to share their views on
how the United States should
approach the difficult questions
raised by immigration in the
post-187 era.
