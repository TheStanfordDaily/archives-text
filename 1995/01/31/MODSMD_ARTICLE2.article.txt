# Storke space committee buckles down to business
## 
### Tristan Sorah Reyes Contributing writer 
Following a mandate from the ASSU Sen
ate, a committee met yesterday to begin its
examination of how space should be divided
between student publications in the Storke
Publications Building.
According to junior Danny Bressler, chair
of the ASSU Publications Board, the group
discussed ground rules for upcoming meet
ings, rather than substantive issues.
"The committee was set up to examine the
space allocation decision that the Pub Board
made and to present a decision to the senate,"
Bressler said.
Last night's meeting marks an attempt to
resolve a long-standing conflict between the
Stanford Chaparral and the Pub Board over
the allocation of office space. In the past, the
Chaparral has controlled four rooms in the
Storke Building, leaving one room as a com
mon room for more than a dozen other stu
dent publications.

In November, the Pub Board decided to re
allocate two rooms formerly used by the
Chaparral for use by the Pub Board and other
student publications. After the Chaparral ap
pealed the decision to the University and the
ASSU, the senate formed a committee to
study the issue at last Tuesday's meeting.
When asked if he was happy about the di
rection and tone of the meeting, the commit
tee's lone Chaparral representative — Stan
ford alumni Barry Parr — said, "Yes and no.
The committee is largely composed of people
who are biased against the Chaparral, and all
that we are asking is that the Pub Board ne
gotiates in good faith."
While some committee members ex
pressed concern about the lack of a Universi
ty representative on the committee, Bressler
said the absence did not disturb him.
"The University has made their position
clear. Maiy Edmonds, the vice provost for
student affairs, has given the Pub Board the
authority to allocate the space and
the historic aspects of the Cha
parral have to be acknowledged,
which has been attempted by the
board in allocating two rooms to
them," Bressler said.
Michael Meyer, incoming editor
in chief of The Stanford Review,
disagreed with Bressler, saying
that there are things to be clarified
and that this is a "he said, she
said" situation on space rights.
"I feel that the University is not
taking responsibility for its
actions. Instead it is putting all the
responsibility on the ASSU," said
Richard Barnett, a committee
member representing the Stan
ford Journal of International
Affairs.
Bressler said he feels the chal
lenge to Pub Board authority sets a
bad precedent.
"This is very bad for the Pub
Board," Meyer said. "You need due
process, but appealing every time
you're not happy is unhealthy. It

has come to the point where other
publications are paying the price
for all this."
Barnett said the Chaparral's
use of an alumnus rather than a
student as its representative is
strange.
"I feel that it is inappropriate
for anyone outside the University
to be present at the meeting," he
said.
"I'd much prefer a student rep
resentative for the Chaparral,"
Meyer added. "It's a student issue
and it would be more appropriate
for a student to be there."
Next Monday Parr and Bressler
will meet with an impartial media
tor to brainstorm ideas, and two
days later the whole group will
meet to go over its options.
Other committee members are:
Andre Vanier, ASSU undergradu
ate senator and coordinator of the
committee; Anietie Ekanem, a
member of the Council of Presi
dents; Nanci Howe, a representa
tive from the Office of Student
Affairs; Juan Taboas, a graduate
senator; Colleen Krueger and
Michael Slemmer, representatives
of The Stanford Daily.
