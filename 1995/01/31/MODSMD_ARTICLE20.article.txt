# Enforce the law, but preserve civil liberties
## 
### 
WITH PASSAGE OF Proposition 187, the
voters of California spoke loud and clear:
no taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal
immigrants. Gov. Pete Wilson supported 187,
but his position is broader: the federal govern
ment is wrong to require the states to pick up the
tab for illegal immigrants, not only the costs of
education, welfare and non-emergency medical
care, but also major costs not covered by Prop.
187 — incarceration, emergency medical care
and the welfare costs of children born in this
country to mothers who crossed the border ille
gally.
And now he has a powerful ally — Republican
Newt Gingrich, the new Speaker of the House,
who agrees with Wilson that the federal govern
ment should either eliminate the requirements
placed on the states or pay the bills. In the case of
requiring the states to educate children here ille
gally, the 1982 Supreme Court decision, Plyler v.
Doe, will have to be reversed. But that was a 5-4
decision. "The issue," said the dissenters — who
included Justices William Rehnquist and Sandra
Day O'Connor — "is whether, for purposes of
allocating its finite resources, a state has a legiti
mate reason to differentiate between persons
who are lawfully within the state and those who
are unlawfully there." When the issue again
reaches it, the Supreme Court may well go with
Rehnquist and O'Connor. After all, the federal
government makes such a distinction; illegal
aliens are barred from most federal programs.

Proposition 187 Ls not the only recent action to
deal with immigration problems. President Clin
ton calmed Florida last fall by making a deal with
Fidel Castro to keep Cubans in Cuba (in return
for a higher level of legal immigration), thus
reversing a longstanding U.S. policy of providing
safe haven for victims of Communist oppression.
And he sent troops to Haiti to stop Haitian
refugees from coming to America.
Kathleen Brown, unsuccessful candidate for
governor of California, called for stopping illegal
immigration at the border, but this approach has
problems. The outstanding example of successful
border control in the modern world was the
Berlin Wall — miles of concrete, barbed wire,
attack dogs, land mines, search lights, guard tow
ers and shoot-to-kill rules.
Not even a Berlin Wall solution would work;
over half of illegal immigrants enter legally on
tourist or other visas and simply stay. Totalitari
an governments have solved that problem, too,
with internal passports — identification papers
that must be carried by everyone. Frequent
checking of papers on many occasions — job
applications, housing rental, medical care, school
admissions and so forth — provides an ongoing
means of population control.
Meanwhile, two bills to deny welfare benefits
to legal immigrants — one Democrat and one
Republican — were introduced in the last
Congress. With over 1 million immigrants a year
— about 800,000 legal immigrants, 150,000
refugees, and 200,000 to 300,000 illegal immi
grants — what we are seeing is a broad-based
response, from the White House, the Congress,
governors' mansions and people in the voting
booth — to the costs immigrants are perceived to

impose on U.S. taxpayers, especially the costs of
social services. Given that welfare benefits in the
United States are higher than the average
income in many countries, this is a legitimate
concern.
In the 1980s the concern about illegal immi
gration culminated in the 1986 Immigration
Reform and Control Act, which made it illegal for
employers to hire illegal immigrants — those
without a green card or other permission to work.
This legislation has not worked very well, partly
because of fraudulent documents and partly
because some employers hire in violation of the
law. Its consequences may be even worse: it may
encourage illegal immigrants who are attracted
by welfare benefits rather than job opportunities,
and it may create an underclass of illegal immi
grants who lack opportunities for job advance
ment.
If we want immigrants who benefit American
society and pull their own weight — and at the

same time we want to preserve civil liberties for
all of us — we should do the following:
• Deny taxpayer-funded social services to ille
gal immigrants and deport violators, to discour
age people from coming here to obtain public ben
efits. Improve enforcement of requirements that
sponsored legal immigrants stay off the welfare
rolls for at least three years.
• Improve border enforcement, but recognize
that only totalitarian societies can achieve any
thing close to perfection in this regard. Learn to
live with some illegal immigrants, and educate
their children. The parents will, after all, be
working and paying taxes, and will not be on the
welfare rolls.
• Repeal employer sanctions, and not require
employers to determine whether someone is
legally eligible to work.
