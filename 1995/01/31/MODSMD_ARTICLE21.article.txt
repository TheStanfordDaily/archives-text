# Understandable outrage over issues of fairness begat 187 monster

### 
THERE WERE AT least two frighten
ing risks with Proposition 187 that
received wide attention before the
election took place.
High school students are routinely
recruited into gangs in Los Angeles and all
of our other big cities. Throwing a high
school student who is here illegally out of
school would help that recruitment
immensely. If such a student were immedi
ately deported, perhaps not; but no one
believes immediate deportation is likely,
and Prop. 187 does nothing to make it so.

An even clearer example of what Prop.
187 can do to harm our state is in the con
text of health care. Suppose illegal immi
grants avoid health care clinics out of fear of
deportation. That is the intended result of
Prop. 187. If that person has a communica
ble condition (a very real example is tuber

culosis), we would all be at greater risk of
the spread of disease because that person
does not seek health care. Alarmingly, the
reports at health care clinics throughout the
state demonstrate a marked decline in uti
lization since the passage of Prop. 187.
Some supporters of Prop. 187 recognized
these risks but said the proposition was nec
essary nonetheless to create a "test case" on
the question of whether the federal govern
ment can continue to get away with paying
for only the smallest share of what its man
dates, and its failure to patrol the border,
has cost our state.
However, it did not take Prop. 187 to cre
ate this test case. A legal case could have
been constructed quite simply. The state
could have withheld a small percentage of
the funding it provided to a single public
health clinic; that health clinic could have
then sued the state of California to compel
the full payment, and the state of California
would have defended by saying that per
centage is due from the federal government
because of its mandates or failure to protect

the border. The legal posture of such a case
is the same as that which Prop. 187 creates.
If the governor would prefer a state law
to executive action to prompt the test case,
that could easily have been arranged. Just
such a law was passed last year to create a
test case regarding the cost of illegal aliens
in prison.

'Outrage... among common,
decent working people'

What happened in Prop. 187, therefore,
goes far beyond the need to develop a test
case. In its implication for public health and
safety, it was dangerous. Why, then, did it
pass?
Because the level of outrage is very high
among common, decent working people
that the government takes their money and
spends it on those who don't play by the
rules. Prop. 187 appealed to the average
voter as simple fairness: we shouldn't have

to pay for people who break the law and
then demand services from us. And we
shouldn't be told to do something by Wash
ington, then get stuck with the bill.
The legacy of Prop. 187, therefore, will
largely be in how elected officials alter their
conduct. One change is a heightened aware
ness of the peoples' desire for their money to
be well spent. Surely this sentiment tri
umphed even over local interest, as the
defeat of House Speaker Tom Foley and
many powerful committee chairs proved. It
didn't do anymore to say, "Look how many
projects I've brought to our district."
As for the test case on the way Washing
ton has been dealing with the states, I
believe the U.S. Supreme Court is unlikely
to order the federal government to stop
unfunded mandates. Unfunded mandates
should be stopped, but I doubt very much
that the Supreme Court will do it. Rather,
major progress against this practice will
occur because the Congress itself will
impose new discipline against the unfunded
mandate. The new House of Representa

tives has already passed a rule of procedure
to this effect. (The state of California, inci
dentally, can also do a better job along these
same lines with units of local government â€”
our legislature is not above finding easy
exceptions to the rules against making cities
and counties do costly things without giving
them any money.)
The legal test case could have come about
without Prop. 187, but it was the vote for
Prop. 187, in face of the rather clear argu
ments against it, including risks to safety
and health, that was part of the message of
November 1994 which might bring lasting
change in the way our government oper
ates.
I only wish we had accomplished this
result by an advisory vote. The people need
ed a way to show their outrage through a
vehicle that did not imperil our public
health or safety. Since none was at hand,
they voted for Prop. 187.
