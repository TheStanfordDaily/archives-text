# Myth of the 'illegal'
## 
### 
THE 1994 CAMPAIGN sea
son marked the return of
immigration as a wedge
issue, dividing the country
socially and politically, although
not along expected or partisan
lines. With the passage of Propo
sition 187, it is clear that "ille
gal" immigration is becoming
the dominant theme of the dis
cussion. But as much as "illegal"
immigration is invoked, it rarely
is examined.
The forces in favor of restrict
ing immigration have found a
theme that plays well with the
public. That theme is the sup
posed criminal conduct of "ille
gal" immigrants and the result-

ing societal costs presumably
borne by law-abiding citizens.
The distinction between "legal"
and "illegal" immigration, which
before had always been blurry,
now has been sharpened for
political purposes.
The approach is classic divide
and conquer. The mythical good
legal immigrant is set against
the archetypal bad illegal immi
grant. Praise for the one serves
to condemn the other.
Essentially, the "illegal"
immigrant is trapped by a trick
of rhetoric, a circular argument.
By the very definition of the
term, he is one of "them," not
one of "us." He cannot be in the
country because he broke the
law; and he broke the law by
being in the country.
The "illegal" immigrant can
not win. Anything he does takes
away from citizens, including
succeeding by any other mea
sure. He is either wasting wel
fare or stealing jobs.
The political shift on immi
gration is apparent from the
acceptability of the extreme
position that the country should
have closed borders, permitting
no further legal immigration
and taking military measures to
protect against illegal immigra
tion. An alternative argument,
that the country should have
open borders and legalize most
immigration, is considered, in
contrast, laughable if not
insane. From historical, cultural
and legal perspectives though, it
is closed borders and not open
borders which represent the far
fringe.
Anyone trying to stand up to
the bullying at the borders is
accused of sanctioning criminal
behavior or undermining
national security. Individuals
who remember their immigrant
pasts or who have family mem
bers overseas are deemed to be
biased before beginning the dis
cussion.
In this context, it becomes
impossible to present basic facts
about immigration. Immigrants
represent a lower proportion of
the population now than at the
turn of the century.
Historically, immigration
policies have been based on race
and religion quite explicitly. The
goal only a few generations ago
was to limit the influx of South
ern and Eastern Europeans,
especially Catholics and Jews.
Asians were barred altogether
and Latinos were repatriated.
Today, undocumented immi
grants are a fraction of the for
eign-born population. They
number only 3.4 million nation
ally, according to the INS. Most
arrived legally, not over the
southern border. While legal

immigrants who pay taxes gen
erally are not eligible for most
forms of welfare for several
years after their arrival, undocu
mented immigrants who also
pay taxes are entitled to virtual
ly no government benefits.
There are dozens of different
"legal" statuses individuals may
have. Thousands of people are in
a gray area, "underdocumented"
because they do not know how to
proceed, or cannot afford to hire
an attorney to help them.
Moreover, the images of ille
gal immigration are exclusively
nonwhite. The stereotypes
include Mexican families sneak
ing over the border, and boat
loads of Chinese and Haitians
desperately trying to sail in. As
people cannot simply look and
see who is legally here and who
is not, Latino, Asian, African
and Afro-Caribbean citizens and
permanent residents come to be
labeled as foreign and illegal.
This form of illegal-immigration
rhetoric is comparable to law
and-order rhetoric that turns
out to focus on only African-
American criminals, none too
subtly suggesting that all crimi
nals are African American and
all African Americans criminal.
The pregnant Mexican woman
coming in to give birth is the
welfare queen of the '90s.
"Illegal" immigration is less
about illegality than immigra
tion. The much-publicized anec
dotes about "illegal" immigrants
often are about "legal" immi
grants. The "illegal" schoolchil
dren who were picked up across
the border by special school
buses sent from San Diego in
fact were citizen children enti
tled to a public education like
anyone else. The "illegal" for
eigners speaking with accents, in
line at government offices â€”
those individuals are "legal" cit
izens and permanent residents,
who may look and sound differ
ent but who have as much a
right to services as anyone else.

The 'illegal' immigrant
cannot win He is
either wasting welfare,
or stealing jobs.'

Yet the self-appointed
guardians of the borders are
either sensitive or sophisticated.
Before anyone accuses them of
"racism," they set up the hob
goblin of "political correctness."
Numerous assumptions are
never questioned, despite empir
ical evidence to the contrary:
that there are large numbers of
"illegal" immigrants, that they
impose an economic burden,
that they use governmental
largesse. Everyone has suc
cumbed to hysteria: "Something
must be done!"
As the country considers
building walls and closing gates,
from the national borders to
guarded communities, the world
is becoming more mobile, with
massive migration within a glob
al economy. The debate over
immigration, including illegal
immigration, is a debate over
our vision of America, shared or
separated. It would be unfortu
nate to end on a declaration of
selfishness.
