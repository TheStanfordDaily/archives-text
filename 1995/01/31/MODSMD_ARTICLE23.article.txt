## On their way to Atlanta? Cardinal qualifies four gymnasts for U.S. National Team 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
For the Stanford men gymnasts who qualified for
the U.S. Winter Nationals in Colorado, last weekend's
competition was their chance to step away from one
another and individually pursue berths on the U.S.
gymnastics team. Somehow, they didn't stray too far
apart.
In one of the most competitive national meets of
the year, four of the five Cardinal representatives
charged through the elite field, emerging to find them
selves together on the U.S. National Team.
Senior Josh Stein led the way for the Cardinal,
nearly winning the overall in the combined compul
sories and optionals. Finishing only 0.06 points
behind UClxA's Chainey Umphrey, Stein performed
almost flawlessly, turning a spectacular effort in every
event.
"Josh showed that he has the potential to be a
national champion," said head coach Sadao Hamada.
"Clearly he has established himself as one of the
sport's rising stars with this performance."
Returning to the national team for the second
straight year, Stein felt that this particular competi
tion would be a key indicator of his future.
"This season I've been working on my routines,
adding some big tricks and finishes, trying to get them
more in line with the expectations of USA Gymnas
tics," Stein said. "The result was very reassuring for
me as I look towards making the Olympic team in
1996."
Competing alongside him was teammate Keith
Wiley, who secured his spot with a lOth-place finish in
the overall. With only one full season under his belt,
Wiley displayed brilliant style in his routines, using it
to overcome an uncharacteristically low 8.15 on the
pommel horse. Wiley's lack of upper body strength, a
weakness he pinpointed going into the competition,
proved to be his primary problem in his weakest
event.

In optionals-only competi
tion, sophomore Jamie Ellis
rebounded from the letdown of
not qualifying for the compul
sories to post a sixth-place finish
in the 19-and-under division.
While the inconsistency that
plagued him in previous quali
fiers this season surfaced occa
sionally, Hamada felt that Ellis
was clearly more comfortable
with his routines.
Similarly, graduate assistant
Mark Booth came back from the
disappointment at falling short
in qualifiers by taking second in
the 20-and-over division. Booth
competed with a vengeance and
encountered few problems on
his way to producing the second
highest optional score of the
entire meet.
The main surprise for the
Cardinal, however, came in the
poor performance of Jair Lynch.
Lynch, a 1992 Olympian, failed
to qualify for the team, finishing
two spots out of contention at
12th place. An injury to his left
shoulder was by far the primary
factor behind Lynch's difficulty.
Lynch sustained the injury just
before the season opener and has
sat out of competition thus far.
"Nothing went right for Jair,"
Hamada said. "The fact that he
couldn't practice for 10 days was
just too much to get past."
Despite several problems,
Hamada was extremely pleased
with the results. "This is a great
indication of what's in store for
these young men," he said.
"They all showed a great deal of
potential here and I am confi
dent that any of these guys can
make the Olympic team next
year."
