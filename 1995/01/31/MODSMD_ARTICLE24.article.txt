"When you plan on being suc
cessful, it's not a big surprise."
That's how Kurt Grote
described the continuing success he
has had as a member of the Cardi
nal swimming team's three-time
NCAA champion senior class. After
walking onto the team his fresh
man year, Grote is now a co-cap
tain, a defending champion and
this year's favorite in the 200-yard
breast stroke. When asked how he
became so successful, Grote said,
"All the little steps added up."
In ninth grade, Grote went to
the doctor because of continuing
asthma problems and learned that
swimming might be a good treat
ment. He did not begin swimming
year round until 10th grade — very
late considering that Stanford
swimmers generally start before
the age of 10. However, Grote's
high school swimming coach,

Michelle Pease, was a former pupil
of Stanford men's swimming coach
Skip Kenney, and she called during
Grote's senior year to say that
Grote was a "must-see" swimmer.
When Kenney traveled down to
San Diego to see Grote compete in
the California Interscholastic Fed
eration championships, he found
that Pease had failed to register
him for his best event — the 100-
yard breast. Grote had to settle for
a "slow 50" freestyle.
However, Kenney trusted
Pease's instincts because of their
previous coach/athlete relation
ship, and when he talked to Grote
over the telephone, he thought,
"What a great kid." So when Grote
arrived at Stanford, he walked onto
the team.
Grote has a pattern of setting
goals and achieving them — of
bringing the little pieces together.
