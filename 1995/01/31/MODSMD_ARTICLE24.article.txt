# A 						former walk-on now NCAA champ
## Grote's hard work pays off with quick trip to swimming stardom

"When you plan on being suc
cessful, it's not a big surprise."
That's how Kurt Grote
described the continuing success he
has had as a member of the Cardi
nal swimming team's three-time
NCAA champion senior class. After
walking onto the team his fresh
man year, Grote is now a co-cap
tain, a defending champion and
this year's favorite in the 200-yard
breast stroke. When asked how he
became so successful, Grote said,
"All the little steps added up."
In ninth grade, Grote went to
the doctor because of continuing
asthma problems and learned that
swimming might be a good treat
ment. He did not begin swimming
year round until 10th grade — very
late considering that Stanford
swimmers generally start before
the age of 10. However, Grote's
high school swimming coach,

Michelle Pease, was a former pupil
of Stanford men's swimming coach
Skip Kenney, and she called during
Grote's senior year to say that
Grote was a "must-see" swimmer.
When Kenney traveled down to
San Diego to see Grote compete in
the California Interscholastic Fed
eration championships, he found
that Pease had failed to register
him for his best event — the 100-
yard breast. Grote had to settle for
a "slow 50" freestyle.
However, Kenney trusted
Pease's instincts because of their
previous coach/athlete relation
ship, and when he talked to Grote
over the telephone, he thought,
"What a great kid." So when Grote
arrived at Stanford, he walked onto
the team.
Grote has a pattern of setting
goals and achieving them — of
bringing the little pieces together.
He left high school with the goal of

making it to the NCAA Champi
onships. He reached that goal early
by qualifying in December of his
freshman year, and achieved per
sonal goals of two minutes in the
200 breast by December and 1:57
by the NCAAs. At the end of the
year, he was seeded first in the 200
breast, although he came in fourth.
Grote attributes much of his early
growth to the aid of former team
mates Tyler Mayfield and J.J. Fri
etag, fellow breaststroke men.
"It's definitely a surprise," said
co-captain Clay Tippins. "The only
thing you know about freshmen is
how highly they were touted. But
Kurt has set such a great example
that great attitude and work ethic
can take you a long way. He takes
away all the excuses because he did
not have the big reputation, but
has made himself a career."
Grote has continued improving
over the last three years, and was
seeded first in the 200 breast again
his sophomore and junior years. He
was disappointed to finish third in
the 200 breast his sophomore year.
However, Grote turned things
around last year.
"I took a step back and realized
I had to do different things," Grote
said. "I stopped doing weights and
did more aerobic exercise and long
distance breast." As a junior, he
was seeded first in the 100 and
fourth in the 200. However, it was
the 200 that he won.
This year Grote expects to finish
first in the 100 and 200 breast, as
last year's 100 champion Mayfield
and most of the other competition
graduated. But Grote is more excit
ed about the team relays. In the
past he had been overshadowed in
the 200 and 400 medleys by May
field and Frietag, but now he is the
man for the breaststroke leg of the
relays.
This year's 400 medley team of
Brian Retterer, Grote, Sabir
Muhammad or Tippins, and Joe
Hudepohl has set its goal at cutting
the American record of 3:08 all the
way down to 3:05. Kenney was
somewhat shocked when they

wrote down that goal, but believes
in his athletes' abilities and deter
mination.
"They have a chance because
they think they can," Kenney said.
Despite his swimming success,
Grote considers the sport a sec
ondary part of his life. For him,
coming to Stanford was mostly an
academic decision. This year,
Grote was accepted into Stanford
Medical School, and it is clear that
he has kept academics a strong pri
ority. After this season, he has no
real Olympic aspirations, and
plans on entering medical school in
the fall.
However, Kenney, who will be
the 1996 USA men's swimming
team coach, also hopes Grote will
keep his Olympic dreams alive.
"He's still growing by leaps and
bounds because he had such a late
start, and his' improvement and
confidence keep growing and grow
ing. He is one of the best in the
world underwater. As Olympic
coach I would be honored to have
Kurt on the team," he said.
Finally — and perhaps most
importantly — beyond his academ
ic and athletic success, Grote is
highly regarded by those who know
him as his teammates elected him
co-captain.
"The way we work together I
tend to be vocal while he is the per
fect silent leader," Tippins said.
"He's always working his butt off,
and always sets a perfect example.
He commands a very positive pres
ence."
Last week on the bus to the Ari
zona swim meet, the swimmers
were telling stories about each
other, and Tippins said, "Grote
didn't have any dirt or skeletons in
the closet. He's a delightful person
to be around. I think the world of
him."
When discussing Grote's
growth and success, Kenney said,
"If you really, really believe in
yourself, great things can happen. I
think [Grote] is the ultimate exam
ple of the Stanford student. He is a
great student and excels in
extracurricular activities. He's an
NCAA champion, and [he was]
admitted to Stanford Medical
School. I think that's what Stan
ford's all about."
