Yesterday afternoon, a stellar
pitching staff couldn't save the
No. 1 ranked Cardinal baseball
team from defeat — so All-Amer
ican catcher A.J. Hinch did.
Hinch lined a two-run triple to
the center field wall with two out
in the bottom of the ninth to give
Stanford (2-0) a thrilling 5-4
comeback victory over St. Mary's
(0-2) at Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinal — which built an
early 3-0 lead behind the pitching
of sophomore Jason Middlebrook
— was forced to come from
behind when a string of relief
pitchers were unable to keep the
Gaels at bay. Stanford entered
the bottom of the ninth trailing
their unranked Bay Area rivals,
4-3.
"It's important for us to win a
game like this," said Hinch.
"Some of our pitchers had tough
days but it's early in the season
and I know they'll bounce back.
We're going to have a lot of close
games down the road and it's
important that we learn how to
win them."
Junior Rich Crowe drew a
walk to begin the comeback and
advanced to second on a one-out
single by second baseman Brian
Dafiimore. After Stanford center
fielder Cale Carter hacked at the

first offering from the Gaels'
Gary Hanifen for an infield pop
up, the stage was set for Hinch's
heroics.
Hinch — who finished the
afternoon going two for four with
a walk and two runs batted in —
belted a 2-0 offering just out of
the reach of a diving attempt by
Gael center fielder Jeremy Fuller
to send the few Cardinal faithful
who braved the rain and cold into
a frenzy.
Lost in the Stanford victory
was another strong outing from
Middlebrook, who worked five
scoreless innings but was not
credited with a decision. The
sophomore threw five strikeouts
— including four out of the first
five St. Mary's hitters of the day
— while walking none and allow
ing just two hits.
"I'm way further ahead of
where I was at this time last
year," Middlebrook said. "I still
had the nervous jitters, but I
knew what to expect going into
the game and I felt a lot more in
control."
But, unlike Saturday's game,
the Stanford bullpen was unable
to hold the lead as the Gaels ral
lied for two runs off of Todd Bar
tels in the sixth inning and took
the lead with two more against
sophomore Brendan Sullivan in
the top of the eighth. Reliever
Tom Reimers — who led the Car
dinal a year ago with nine saves
— pitched the final two innings
and was credited with the win.
"It was a huge win for us,"
Reimers said. "I didn't have my
best stuff today, but it's a great
