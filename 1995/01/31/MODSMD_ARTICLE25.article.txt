# Hinch's heroics sink St. Mary's
## Junior catcher triples home two runs in bottom of ninth

St. Mary's 4j

Yesterday afternoon, a stellar
pitching staff couldn't save the
No. 1 ranked Cardinal baseball
team from defeat — so All-Amer
ican catcher A.J. Hinch did.
Hinch lined a two-run triple to
the center field wall with two out
in the bottom of the ninth to give
Stanford (2-0) a thrilling 5-4
comeback victory over St. Mary's
(0-2) at Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinal — which built an
early 3-0 lead behind the pitching
of sophomore Jason Middlebrook
— was forced to come from
behind when a string of relief
pitchers were unable to keep the
Gaels at bay. Stanford entered
the bottom of the ninth trailing
their unranked Bay Area rivals,
4-3.
"It's important for us to win a
game like this," said Hinch.
"Some of our pitchers had tough
days but it's early in the season
and I know they'll bounce back.
We're going to have a lot of close
games down the road and it's
important that we learn how to
win them."
Junior Rich Crowe drew a
walk to begin the comeback and
advanced to second on a one-out
single by second baseman Brian
Dafiimore. After Stanford center
fielder Cale Carter hacked at the

first offering from the Gaels'
Gary Hanifen for an infield pop
up, the stage was set for Hinch's
heroics.
Hinch — who finished the
afternoon going two for four with
a walk and two runs batted in —
belted a 2-0 offering just out of
the reach of a diving attempt by
Gael center fielder Jeremy Fuller
to send the few Cardinal faithful
who braved the rain and cold into
a frenzy.
Lost in the Stanford victory
was another strong outing from
Middlebrook, who worked five
scoreless innings but was not
credited with a decision. The
sophomore threw five strikeouts
— including four out of the first
five St. Mary's hitters of the day
— while walking none and allow
ing just two hits.
"I'm way further ahead of
where I was at this time last
year," Middlebrook said. "I still
had the nervous jitters, but I
knew what to expect going into
the game and I felt a lot more in
control."
But, unlike Saturday's game,
the Stanford bullpen was unable
to hold the lead as the Gaels ral
lied for two runs off of Todd Bar
tels in the sixth inning and took
the lead with two more against
sophomore Brendan Sullivan in
the top of the eighth. Reliever
Tom Reimers — who led the Car
dinal a year ago with nine saves
— pitched the final two innings
and was credited with the win.
"It was a huge win for us,"
Reimers said. "I didn't have my
best stuff today, but it's a great

feeling for the guys to pick me up
like that. Overall the pitching
wasn't that bad but our standards
have become so high that days
like this don't look good."
After relieving Sullivan in the
eighth, Reimers walked St.
Mary's pinch hitter Bryan Hurl
but to create a bases-loaded situa
tion with no outs and the Cardi
nal still nursing a 3-2 lead. Bran
don Hyde, the Gaels' catcher,
grounded into a double play that
tied the game at three before a
Reimers wild pitch allowed St.
Mary's to take their first lead of
the two-game series.
Contrary to its finish, Monday
afternoon's game began as a
pitcher's duel with Stanford's
Middlebrook and the Gaels'

btarter Sam Madrid going pitch
for pitch. While Middlebrook was
in complete command of St.
Mary's with a fastball that
nobody could keep up with,
Madrid was equally impressive —
at least through the first three
innings.
Nine of the first ten Cardinal
hitters were retired and it wasn't
until the fourth inning that Stan
ford managed its first hit off
Madrid — a single to left by
Carter. But from that point on
Madrid lost control of his pitches
and the Cardinal took advantage,
scoring one run in the fourth and
adding two more in the fifth.
Like Saturday, most of the
Stanford offense came after two
were out. Dallimore — making
his first start since returning
from a University suspension —
tripled to the wall in right to plate
designated hitter Troy Kent in
the fifth. Carter followed with a

bloop single, giving the Cardinal a
3-0 advantage. Of Stanford's 11
runs in 1995, nine have come
with two outs.
But St. Mary's responded
immediately in the top of the
sixth. Junior Todd Bartels —
making a rare relief appearance
— was shelled, giving up three
hits and two runs in just two
thirds of an inning pitched. Sulli
van, a submarine style hurler,
came on with men at the corners
and struck out Gaels' shortstop
Gabe Williams to preserve what
was then a 3-2 edge.
"It's a great find for our
offense to be able to come from
behind like we did," left-fielder
Rich Crowe said. "Being ranked
so high we know that teams will
come to play us with a chip on
their shoulder and it was a big
statement for us to respond."
St. Mary's was not expected by
many to challenge the top-ranked

Cardinal, but a strong outing is
sure to increase the Gaels' confi
dence level. Right fielder Jason
Weekly finished three for four on
the day and had five hits in the two
game series. Kelly Asan added two
more hits and an RBI for the Gaels
and center fielder Jeremy Fuller
— just a freshman — made sever
al spectacular catches in the out
field.
"You can't underestimate any
opponent," Reimers said. "St.
Mary's has a solid program and
you know that this game is only
going to help their confidence."
And the win was equally
important for the Cardinal.
"When I compare this year's
team with last year's team I see a
real difference," Middlebrook
said. "I don't think we would have
gotten that hit at the end or put
ourselves in a position to win a
game like this last year. It shows
how much we've improved."

"When I compare this year's
team with last year's team I see a
real difference," Middlebrook
said. "I don't think we would have
gotten that hit at the end or put
ourselves in a position to win a
game like this last year. It shows
how much we've improved."
Stanford 51
St. Mary's 4j

Yesterday afternoon, a stellar
pitching staff couldn't save the
No. 1 ranked Cardinal baseball
team from defeat — so All-Amer
ican catcher A.J. Hinch did.
Hinch lined a two-run triple to
the center field wall with two out
in the bottom of the ninth to give
Stanford (2-0) a thrilling 5-4
comeback victory over St. Mary's
(0-2) at Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinal — which built an
early 3-0 lead behind the pitching
of sophomore Jason Middlebrook
— was forced to come from
behind when a string of relief
pitchers were unable to keep the
Gaels at bay. Stanford entered
the bottom of the ninth trailing
their unranked Bay Area rivals,
4-3.
"It's important for us to win a
game like this," said Hinch.
"Some of our pitchers had tough
days but it's early in the season
and I know they'll bounce back.
We're going to have a lot of close
games down the road and it's
important that we learn how to
win them."
Junior Rich Crowe drew a
walk to begin the comeback and
advanced to second on a one-out
single by second baseman Brian
Dafiimore. After Stanford center
fielder Cale Carter hacked at the

first offering from the Gaels'
Gary Hanifen for an infield pop
up, the stage was set for Hinch's
heroics.
Hinch — who finished the
afternoon going two for four with
a walk and two runs batted in —
belted a 2-0 offering just out of
the reach of a diving attempt by
Gael center fielder Jeremy Fuller
to send the few Cardinal faithful
who braved the rain and cold into
a frenzy.
Lost in the Stanford victory
was another strong outing from
Middlebrook, who worked five
scoreless innings but was not
credited with a decision. The
sophomore threw five strikeouts
— including four out of the first
five St. Mary's hitters of the day
— while walking none and allow
ing just two hits.
"I'm way further ahead of
where I was at this time last
year," Middlebrook said. "I still
had the nervous jitters, but I
knew what to expect going into
the game and I felt a lot more in
control."
But, unlike Saturday's game,
the Stanford bullpen was unable
to hold the lead as the Gaels ral
lied for two runs off of Todd Bar
tels in the sixth inning and took
the lead with two more against
sophomore Brendan Sullivan in
the top of the eighth. Reliever
Tom Reimers — who led the Car
dinal a year ago with nine saves
— pitched the final two innings
and was credited with the win.
"It was a huge win for us,"
Reimers said. "I didn't have my
best stuff today, but it's a great

feeling for the guys to pick me up
like that. Overall the pitching
wasn't that bad but our standards
have become so high that days
like this don't look good."
After relieving Sullivan in the
eighth, Reimers walked St.
Mary's pinch hitter Bryan Hurl
but to create a bases-loaded situa
tion with no outs and the Cardi
nal still nursing a 3-2 lead. Bran
don Hyde, the Gaels' catcher,
grounded into a double play that
tied the game at three before a
Reimers wild pitch allowed St.
Mary's to take their first lead of
the two-game series.
Contrary to its finish, Monday
afternoon's game began as a
pitcher's duel with Stanford's
Middlebrook and the Gaels'

btarter Sam Madrid going pitch
for pitch. While Middlebrook was
in complete command of St.
Mary's with a fastball that
nobody could keep up with,
Madrid was equally impressive —
at least through the first three
innings.
Nine of the first ten Cardinal
hitters were retired and it wasn't
until the fourth inning that Stan
ford managed its first hit off
Madrid — a single to left by
Carter. But from that point on
Madrid lost control of his pitches
and the Cardinal took advantage,
scoring one run in the fourth and
adding two more in the fifth.
Like Saturday, most of the
Stanford offense came after two
were out. Dallimore — making
his first start since returning
from a University suspension —
tripled to the wall in right to plate
designated hitter Troy Kent in
the fifth. Carter followed with a

bloop single, giving the Cardinal a
3-0 advantage. Of Stanford's 11
runs in 1995, nine have come
with two outs.
But St. Mary's responded
immediately in the top of the
sixth. Junior Todd Bartels —
making a rare relief appearance
— was shelled, giving up three
hits and two runs in just two
thirds of an inning pitched. Sulli
van, a submarine style hurler,
came on with men at the corners
and struck out Gaels' shortstop
Gabe Williams to preserve what
was then a 3-2 edge.
"It's a great find for our
offense to be able to come from
behind like we did," left-fielder
Rich Crowe said. "Being ranked
so high we know that teams will
come to play us with a chip on
their shoulder and it was a big
statement for us to respond."
St. Mary's was not expected by
many to challenge the top-ranked

Cardinal, but a strong outing is
sure to increase the Gaels' confi
dence level. Right fielder Jason
Weekly finished three for four on
the day and had five hits in the two
game series. Kelly Asan added two
more hits and an RBI for the Gaels
and center fielder Jeremy Fuller
— just a freshman — made sever
al spectacular catches in the out
field.
"You can't underestimate any
opponent," Reimers said. "St.
Mary's has a solid program and
you know that this game is only
going to help their confidence."
And the win was equally
important for the Cardinal.
"When I compare this year's
team with last year's team I see a
real difference," Middlebrook
said. "I don't think we would have
gotten that hit at the end or put
ourselves in a position to win a
game like this last year. It shows
how much we've improved."
