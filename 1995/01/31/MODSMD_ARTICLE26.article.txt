The Stanford wrestling team proved that
it could compete with the best in the Pacific
10 Conference with a 21-15 upset of Oregon
and a narrow 26-18 loss to Oregon State over
the weekend.
"It's a sign of progress," said head coach
Chris Horpel. "It shows we're going in a pos
itive direction."
Sunday's win was the first time the Car
dinal had beaten the Ducks in 10 years.
Stanford needed two come-from-behind vic
tories and a pin from an athlete wrestling in
his first-ever dual meet to pull out the win.
Late in the third round of the 142-pound
bout, senior co-captain Jay Jackson, down by
two points, scored a last second take down on
Cory Sonnen, the defending Pac-10 champi
on. In sudden death overtime, Jackson took

Sonnen down again to capture the match, 6-
4.
In the 167-pound match, freshman Matt
Von der Ahe filled in for junior Mark
Ryzewicz who hurt his neck Saturday
against Oregon State. Von der Ahe, in his
first dual meet at Stanford, pinned Tom
Glenn one minute, 14 seconds into the first
round, giving the Cardinal its first lead of
the night, 15-11.
"Matt Von der Ahe gave us a big win,"
Horpel said.
In the very next match, sophomore 177-
pounder Roger Liu followed Jackson's lead
and came up big late in the match. Down by
one, Liu scored on a take down and slipped
past Oregon's Royce Retenn, 5-4. Sopho
more 190-pounder Bryan Vaniman put the
meet out of reach, dominating Oregon's
Greg Johnson.
"We wrestled great," said junior Matt

Cano. "We had a lot of wrestling with a lot of
heart."
Earlier in the night, junior co-captain
Jimmy Aguirre remained undefeated with a
10-5 victory over Blake Tompkins. Junior
Tod Surmon did not fare as well. Although
Surmon took his match into overtime on a
take down with no time left on the clock, he
still lost the match, 6-4, in sudden death to
llth-ranked Scott Norton.
"This is the kind of team we have to beat
to reach our goal," Horpel said. "The over
time matches were key. We came from
behind a lot."
But coming from behind to win wasn't
necessarily a good thing for the Cardinal this
weekend as Oregon State showed on Satur
day night. Stanford led, 18-4, heading into
the seventh match but could not hang on.
