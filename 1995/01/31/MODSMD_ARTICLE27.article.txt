# Short-handed women gymnasts still fly high

They left the Farm wounded and
weary, but returned with respect
and honor.
The Stanford women's gymnas
tics team overcame several key
injuries to finish second out of four
teams during last Friday's competi
tion at Berkeley.
The Cardinal scored 188.425,
finishing just seven-tenths of a
point behind first-place UCLA,
despite losing freshman Amy Neil
to an injury during practice last
week. Cal and the University of
Denver finished third and fourth,
respectively.
Each team usually has six gym
nasts perform in each event, with
the top five scores counting toward
the overall team score. However,
Neil's injury forced Stanford to use
only five gymnasts in three of the
four events, leaving little room for
error.
"I was tumbling last Wednesday,
my hand slipped off my leg and I
fell," Neil said. "I think it's just a
sprain."
Neil joined sophomore all
arounder Katie Jennings, senior all
arounder Jene' Elzie, and several
others on the Cardinal wounded
list. Nevertheless, Stanford
remained undaunted. Senior Mee
gan Lannin helped pick up the slack
by scoring a 9.75 on the vault, the
best of her career. Lannin's vault, a
full twisting Tsukahara, is unique
