# Short-handed women gymnasts still fly high

They left the Farm wounded and
weary, but returned with respect
and honor.
The Stanford women's gymnas
tics team overcame several key
injuries to finish second out of four
teams during last Friday's competi
tion at Berkeley.
The Cardinal scored 188.425,
finishing just seven-tenths of a
point behind first-place UCLA,
despite losing freshman Amy Neil
to an injury during practice last
week. Cal and the University of
Denver finished third and fourth,
respectively.
Each team usually has six gym
nasts perform in each event, with
the top five scores counting toward
the overall team score. However,
Neil's injury forced Stanford to use
only five gymnasts in three of the
four events, leaving little room for
error.
"I was tumbling last Wednesday,
my hand slipped off my leg and I
fell," Neil said. "I think it's just a
sprain."
Neil joined sophomore all
arounder Katie Jennings, senior all
arounder Jene' Elzie, and several
others on the Cardinal wounded
list. Nevertheless, Stanford
remained undaunted. Senior Mee
gan Lannin helped pick up the slack
by scoring a 9.75 on the vault, the
best of her career. Lannin's vault, a
full twisting Tsukahara, is unique

because it involves a full twist in the
middle of a flip.
"I just concentrated on punching
the board hard," Lannin said. "The
height I got was the key factor."
Stanford also performed well on
the beam, an area that has caused it
concern in the past few weeks.
"We've had a little trouble on
beam, but this time we did really

well," coach Breck Greenwood said.
"We hit six out of six routines."
Perhaps the key to the Cardinal
squad's fine performance was the
attitude the team chose to bring to
the meet.
"Last meet, we were so affected
by negative variables," Greenwood
said. "This past week in practice, we
worked on not letting a bad perfor
mance or a low score affect us."
The team appeared to pull
together in spite of the added adver
sity of an incomplete lineup.
"I think it really showed our
character," Elzie said. "When we

focus on ourselves, relax, and just
have fun, that is when we're at our
best."
Greenwood hopes to have both
Elzie and Jennings competing at
full strength within the next couple
of weeks.
"We're at a good place emotional
ly, and our skill level is high,"
Greenwood said. "We just need to
get our big scorers in there."
Jennings, who did not compete
in any of last week's events, will per
form on the vault at Friday's home
meet.
"I'll be ready," Jennings said.
