# Men's rugby falls to BYU
## 
### Mike Jensen 
Two weekends ago, the Stanford
Men's rugby team eryoyed a bitter
sweet victory in its thrashing of UC-
Santa Cruz. The team came away
with a blowout on the scoreboard
but the success seemed empty due
to a lack of team unity.
In its match last Saturday
against Brigham Young, the squad
saw those results flip flop. The 30-3
score tilted heavily in the Cougars'
favor; however, the Cardinal came
away uplifted by a contest that
revealed both teamwork and char
acter.
Stanford hoped to use the non
league game against BYU as a mea
suring stick. Going into the contest,
the squad knew the Cougars would
provide a challenge. Although
ranked 10th in the polls, Stanford
coach Franck Boivert considers the
Cougars to be one of the top three
squads in the country. The BYU
program is traditionally known for
its physical dominance and skilled
international players. Saturday,

both these factors gave BYU a con
siderable advantage against the
smaller Cardinal.
The Cardinal countered with its
speed and quickness. Stanford tried
to accelerate the pace of the game
utilizing quick passing and connec
tions. Despite this tactic, the team
was not able to overcome the
Cougars.
"Careless mistakes due to a lack
of experience" hampered the team's
effort according to Boiveit. Ball con
trol, a traditional area of Cardinal
strength, was one of the key prob
lems stymieing the Stanford attack.
The frustration created by care
less mistakes might have caused
other teams to fold. However, the
Cardinal revealed its character with
a gritty defensive performance.
"I thought we performed well on
defense," Boivert said. Tackling and
physical play were two highlights of
Stanford's inspired showing.
In addition to the Cardinal's
improved effort as a team, several
individuals stepped up. Junior
Bobby Blunt courageously shook off

a crushing blind-side hit early in the
match to provide solid play at full
back. Although satisfied with his
own performance, Blunt found the
team's performance more impres
sive.
"I think we stepped it up a level.
We improved a lot," he said. Like his
coach, Blunt didn't feel the score
represented the squad's true efforts.
"I felt we were close, playing against
a good team."
Boivert also singled out flanker
Trung Ngo for his gritty perfor
mance. The position of flanker is
equivalent to that of linebacker in
football, with Ngo providing consis
tent hits for Stanford throughout
the match.
The Cardinal's next opponent is
seventh-ranked league foe St.
Mary'B. Stanford hopes to use its
upcoming league matches to refine
technical areas such as passing and
eliminate offensive mistakes. More
importantly, Stanford hopes to now
build on a foundation of character
and unity forged during Saturday's
battle with BYU.
