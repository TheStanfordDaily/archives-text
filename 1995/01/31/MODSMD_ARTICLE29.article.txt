# Equestrian finishes second
## Oregon upends West-leading Cardinal at Barn 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
On a day known for lopsided out
comes, Super Bowl Sunday, the
Stanford equestrian squad went
against the trend by providing stiff
competition in a meet at the Stan
ford Barn.
The equestrian team finished in
second, becoming the latest to wit
ness an Oregon upset as the unher
alded Ducks bolted to second place
in the West region with a surprising
victoiy. Oregon now stands only
two points behind the Cardinal in
the season standings, 120-118.
Fresno State, expected to battle
the Cardinal for the championship,
slipped to third overall with 115
points after an unimpressive third
place finish. Highly regarded UC-
Davis played itself out of the leader
board with a stunning sixth-place
showing out of eight schools.
"It was very surprising," said
senior co-president Quito Perlman
of the Aggies' struggles. "I can't

explain it. For some reason they
didn't perform to par."
In the meet featuring only
English teams, the Cardinal earned
three high-point and three reserve
high-point finishes. Stanford's
freshman standout Amanda Hoche
continued her string of triumphs
with a win in the open flat class.
Junior Tamara Earhart and sopho
more Ines Diogo joined Hoche in the
victory circle by taking the begin
ning walk-trot-canter and novice
flat classes respectively.
The Stanford underclassmen
also garnered two red ribbons, as
Katherine Williams placed second in
the walk-trot category and Julie
Baker was first runner-up in inter
mediate fences. Although overshad
owed by Hoche's phenomenal suc
cess, Baker and Williams head a
long list of Cardinal newcomers con
tributing to the squad's rise to the
top of the region.
The experienced Perlman
brought home Stanford's final red
ribbon in the open fences class.

Reflecting on the second-place fin
ish in its first home event of the sea
son, Perlman appreciated the
team's ability to overcome distrac
tions.
"It's always difficult to win a
competition at home because we
have to provide the horses and make
sure everything runs smoothly,"
Perlman said. "There were a few
falls and a minor injury, but mostly
everything went well."
Stanford will take to the road
this Saturday in a contest at Fresno
State, and the second-ranked West
ern squad will join the English unit.
The host Bulldogs currently stand
ahead of the rest of the Western
pack, and are only five points behind
Stanford for the English lead.
Perlman believes the steadiness
of the Cardinal will be key.
"You can't expect to do consis
tently well in every single show,"
Perlman said. "But you can't afford
to do poorly more than once. In our
region, there's a range of five points
from first to third."
