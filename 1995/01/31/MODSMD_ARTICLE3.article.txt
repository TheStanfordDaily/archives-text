# Faculty involvement helps recruit prospective students
## 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
As part of an ongoing student recruitment
effort, the Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aid is soliciting faculty to
directly contact promising Stanford appli
cants.
"We're trying to figure out a good approach
or mechanism in contacting a small number
of talented students ... and hook them up
with faculty," said Jon Reider, chair of a sub
committee charged with looking into faculty
involvement in undergraduate admissions.
"It would be a more personal one-to-one of
fering."

The Admissions Office is asking depart
ment chairs and undergraduate program co
ordinators to provide names of faculty who
could serve as contacts.
According to Reider, names of top students
who declared a specific academic interest on
their application will be provided to the desig
nated faculty by the Admissions Office. The
faculty will personally contact each targeted
student, giving the admissions process a per
sonal touch, he said.
Although such contact does not translate
into a formal letter of admissions, these stu
dents are those who are "very, very likely to be
admitted," he said, adding that
about 200-300 students will be
contacted.
"These students have a very
strong academic record. ... These
are people we're not wavering
about." he added.
"We want them to keep consid
ering coming to Stanford," said
junior Sara Cronenwett, member
of the faculty involvement sub
committee. "The faculty will pro
vide a link for Stanford to the stu
dents."
By contacting students early
in the admissions process, faculty
in undergraduate departments
hope to "make students start
thinking about Stanford before
they start thinking about Har
vard or MIT," said Physics Prof.
Doug Osheroff, chair of the facul
ty involvement subcommittee.
"This is clearly an effort to get a
better representation of the top
echelon students."
"It's different from a letter from

the Admissions Office," Reider
said. "I think that's part of Stan
ford's strength — that it is a
human and friendly place."
Such faculty involvement
already occurs in the Math Depart
ment, where Math Prof. Brad
Osgood said it has been "extremely
helpful."
"We can write to student with
particularly high scores [on nation
al tests] and encourage them to
apply," he said. "These are sharp
kids ... with lots of talent."
Once at Stanford, however,
there has been no guarantee that
these students would major in
math. "That's okay, too," Osgood
said. "The important thing is to get
them here."
Although some say the target
ing system may apply more to sci
ence and engineering depart
ments, Cronenwett said, "it's an
opinion held across the board ...
that this will be helpful to all
departments."
"The question is who is going to
take advantage of this?" said
Osheroff. "We're just going to have
to wait and see how it will work
out."
