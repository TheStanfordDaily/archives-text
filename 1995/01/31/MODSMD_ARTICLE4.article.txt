# New study of ASSU prescribes reforms
## 
### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
After more than a year of study, third
year law student David Smolen and Cardi
nal Consulting yesterday published their
findings on the ASSU, including recom
mendations for alterations in the special
fee system and reorganization of the stu
dent government.
Coming less than a week after the fail
ure of the Balanced Funding Deal,
Smolen's report observes general student
discontent with the system and recom
mends change.
"The major goal [of the report] is to pro
mote positive discourse and offer proposals
and ideas instead of criticism," Smolen
said.
With 24 other students, ranging from
freshmen to students from the Graduate
School of Business, Smolen and the group
tackled a series of issues â€” evaluating spe
cial-fees reform, the ASSU Constitution,
ASSU banking policies, and the history of
the ASSU.
The report will be a subject of discussion

at tonight's ASSU senate meeting, with
Smolen heading the debate.
Encore for special fees
After "a long, careful and considered re
view of the way money is collected,"
Smolen said, the group decided the current
special-fee system needc revision.
However, the report argues the system
also has strengths which must be pre
served. Business school students Jeremy
Brest and Borge Hald were responsible for
overseeing the analysis of the Fee Assess
ment/Student Group Funding section.
The report praises special fees as a
"most efficient method of funding" and ar
gues that they lend credibility to groups'
budgets.
However, Cardinal Consulting found
that the present system contains a number
of weaknesses that leave it ripe for change,
many of which were debated during discus
sions about last week's failed Balanced
Funding Deal.
Cardinal Consulting's proposal is simi
lar to a plan that was debated in the senate
