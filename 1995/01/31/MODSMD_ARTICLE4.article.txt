# New study of ASSU prescribes reforms
## 
### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
After more than a year of study, third
year law student David Smolen and Cardi
nal Consulting yesterday published their
findings on the ASSU, including recom
mendations for alterations in the special
fee system and reorganization of the stu
dent government.
Coming less than a week after the fail
ure of the Balanced Funding Deal,
Smolen's report observes general student
discontent with the system and recom
mends change.
"The major goal [of the report] is to pro
mote positive discourse and offer proposals
and ideas instead of criticism," Smolen
said.
With 24 other students, ranging from
freshmen to students from the Graduate
School of Business, Smolen and the group
tackled a series of issues — evaluating spe
cial-fees reform, the ASSU Constitution,
ASSU banking policies, and the history of
the ASSU.
The report will be a subject of discussion

at tonight's ASSU senate meeting, with
Smolen heading the debate.
Encore for special fees
After "a long, careful and considered re
view of the way money is collected,"
Smolen said, the group decided the current
special-fee system needc revision.
However, the report argues the system
also has strengths which must be pre
served. Business school students Jeremy
Brest and Borge Hald were responsible for
overseeing the analysis of the Fee Assess
ment/Student Group Funding section.
The report praises special fees as a
"most efficient method of funding" and ar
gues that they lend credibility to groups'
budgets.
However, Cardinal Consulting found
that the present system contains a number
of weaknesses that leave it ripe for change,
many of which were debated during discus
sions about last week's failed Balanced
Funding Deal.
Cardinal Consulting's proposal is simi
lar to a plan that was debated in the senate
last year but eventually rejected.
.Students would have to decide on
;a total special-fee amount in the
;spring general election, and then
•allocate their money over a num
ber of special-fee groups each
quarter.
; Special-fee groups would be
determined by the senate and
refund cushions would be com
pletely eliminated. Students
would also retain the right of
refund, if they chose to do so.
Although this would increase
the uncertainty, Smolen argued
that it is fairer and far more
effective than the status quo
because students get to allocate
their funds.
Under the current system,
"you don't even know if your
group is going to be funded, peri
od," Smolen said.
Although Cardinal Consult
ing's proposals come right on the
heels of the Balanced Funding
Deal, Smolen insists that the

reformation of the special-fee sys
tem was a part of the project from
the start.
Smolen also argues that the
report should be "taken on its
own merits," rather than live in
the shadow of last week's failed
amendment.
A new structure
Most of the changes that the
report offers, though, deal with
the internal organization of the
ASSU.
Afler several debates last year
about the restructuring of vari
ous student offices, Cardinal Con
sulting came up with several sug
gestions, with reforms for the
senate and the Council of Presi
dents topping the lists.
Similar to former senator Gabe
Lucas' plan last winter, the group
proposed that the senate should
drop in size, from 40 to 36 stu
dents, and district its seats to best
serve constituents' interests.
Although the plan was rejected
by the students during last
spring's election, Smolen said he
still believes it should be imple
mented. Last year, Smolen said,

the plan failed to pass because
people didn't even want to discuss
it.
u [We need] to encourage peo
ple in talking about districting,"
Smolen said, "and get beyond the
fear."
The benefits of districting the
senate, according to the report,
would be to make senators more
accountable to students. By
putting senators in locations
where students live, Smolen said
he believes more students will
communicate with their repre
sentatives.
The districting plan is already
being used by graduate senators,
and according to Smolen, is very
successful. The plan could also
prevent a large group of students
— like a band of fraternities, for
example — from setting up a
political block and overrunning
the senate, the proposal says.
Cardinal Consulting has also
suggested that the COP be cut
from its present four to three, and
establish a formal cabinet to han
dle its primary tasks.
Finally, the report also propos
es that the ASSU set up a kind of

Stanford "supreme court" —
made up of seven students
appointed by the COP. The stu
dents would serve "life" terms,
from the time of appointment
until the end of their Stanford
careers.
While Smolen said he realizes
most students would not be
affected by the constitutional pro
posals, the changes are important
for improved functioning of stu
dent government.
Other minor changes proposed
include the creation of an ASSU
Top 10 list to set goals for each
year and providing better mainte
nance of the organization's his
torical records.
In the bank
Since the ASSU is also a mil
lion-dollar corporation largely
headed by students, Cardinal
Consulting was concerned with
how the senate handled its
money.
Although there has never been
a problem in the past, the report
found that there exists room for
abuse on the part of the ASSU
financial manager. Therefore,

Smolen said, the group recom
mended "setting up safeguards."
For the most part, this would
mean that the ASSU, either
through the senate or the finan
cial office, would establish regula
tions to formalize policy.
In addition, the report recom
mends making the financial-man
ager position full-time, since pre
vious managers have complained
about the job's time commit
ments.
Although Lucas, who is also
the current financial manager,
agrees the work is overwhelming,
he said he would also recommend
that the position become a two
year commitment to increase con
tinuity within the organization.
A need for reform
After finding that a significant
segment of the student popula
tion is dissatisfied with the ASSU,
Smolen points out "that people
are disgruntled." But he said he
hopes the study will allow the
ASSU to work towards bringing
change and reform.
Smolen — the recipient of the
Robert L. Pierce Memorial

Award, an annual gift of $1,500
given by the Stanford Alumni
Association for an innovative pro
ject — established Cardinal Con
sulting last year to take a compre
hensive look at the ASSU.
According to Smolen, the
report provides "suggestions for
the Stanford community to con
sider and hopefully implement."
However, Smolen understands
that the group's recommenda
tions are exactly that. According
to Smolen, "[we just] want to
move towards serious dialogue...
. It is the job of the elected offi
cials to modify the system."
During the past year, Smolen
said, the senate has "proven itself
to take complex issues" and work
with them. Smolen said he has
"every faith in the ASSU" and
believes the student government
is capable of implementing or dis
cussing the changes that Cardinal
Consulting proposes.
Most of the work in the project
was done by the members of Cardi
nal Consulting, although Smolen
played an important role as direc
tor in putting the results together
and in choosing personnel.
