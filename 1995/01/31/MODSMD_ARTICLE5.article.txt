# Larimore to act as dean
## 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Jim Larimore will serve as acting dean of
students for the spring and summer quar
ters, replacing current Dean Michael Jack
son, Vice Provost and Dean for Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds announced yesterday.
Jackson is leaving in March to become the
vice president for student affairs at the Uni
versity of Southern California.
"I think [Larimore] is the logical choice,"
Edmonds said. "He's filled in for the position
for short periods of time in the past. ... He
knows the University and the students very
well."
Larimore has served as an assistant dean
of student affairs as well as director for the
American Indian Program Office for the past
nine years. In his tenure, he turned Stan
ford's Native American Program around,
more than tripling the number of Native
American students, whose graduation rate

now stands at 90 percent.
He stepped down last summer in order to
pursue a doctoral degree in administration
and policy analysis at the School of Educa
tion.
In the fall, however, Larimore returned to
administrative duties, serving as an assis
tant to the provost, helping ethnic centers
implement the strategic plans that they de
veloped last year.
The announcement of Larimore's new
position came as no surprise to him. "[Ed
monds] and I have been talking about the
possibility for a while.... I'm looking for
ward to working with the people I worked
with before," he said.
In a press release, Jackson praised the
merits of his temporary replacement, saying,
"He's bright, knows the University and en
joys the confidence of his colleagues. He is
also a strong student advocate."
Edmonds said a job description for the
dean of students position will be
ready in February and a perma
nent replacement should be in
place by next fall.
Larimore is an instrumental fig
ure in the Stanford Powwow, an
annual spring event which brings
more than 20,000 people on cam
pus to celebrate Native American
culture. He also served as the first
resident fellow in Muwekma-Tah-
Ruk, the Native American theme
house which opened in 1988.
Presently, Larimore is working
with the provost to help develop
ways the ethnic centers can spend
the two-year, $200,000 grant they
received last fall from University
President Gerhard Casper. The
money is supposed to help the cen
ters in the recruitment and reten
tion of minority students.
With the new appointment,
Larimore said he will be arranging

to take a short leave of absence
from the School of Education to
focus his efforts on his new posi
tion.
Hoping to make the transition
smooth, Larimore said he will be
meeting with Jackson several
times throughout the quarter. He
added that he expects no problems
in the transition.
"It's a pretty strong organiza
tion. ... The people there are ter
rific. They're very professional,"
Larimore said, adding that he
expects "organizational momen
tum" to help in the spring and
summer quarters.
"The whole staff agrees with
the decision," Edmonds said. "I
think he'll easily learn the aspects
of the judicial system. ... It will be
an easy transition."
Jackson, who joined Stanford in
1980 and served as dean of stu
dents since 1991, announced his
resignation from the University in
November. He will be moving to
Southern California at the end of
the quarter.
