If he provokes both the political right and left
through his articles about race relations in California,
Dale Maharidge will know he has done his job.
"Since I focus on middle road solution, I hope to get
people on both extremes, the right and the left, angry
with me," he said.
Maharidge, a lecturer in the Communication De
partment, was recently awarded a $2,800 journalistic
research grant by the Freedom Forum Journalism
Professors Publishing Program to fund his research
on interaction between races in California.
Maharidge, formerly a reporter for the Sacramento
Bee, has published a series of articles and is currently
working on a book about California's situation as the
first mainland state in which whites will not be a ma
jority.
"The issue is extremely topical," he said. "By the
20505, the U.S. Census Bureau predicts that less than
50 percent of the (U.S.) population will be white, and
California is the testing ground for this situation."
"The issue crystallized for me while I was away (lec
turing at Columbia University in 1991), and then the
Los Angeles riots broke out," Maharidge said. "I began
to focus on this topic, and I felt it was very important
to humanize this story."
Although the Freedom Forum grant is a recent
award, Maharidge began his race research in May of
1992. He chose to focus on four distinct California
groups: a white community in southern Orange Coun
ty, a black community in Sacramento, an Asian com
munity in Berkeley, and a Latino community in south
eastern Los Angeles.
In his articles, Maharidge has tried to look at the so
lutions for possible problems arising out of changing
race dynamics. "Too often, it seems that there is a cen
trifugal force which pushes the race topic to extremes,
and moderate forces are ignored," he said.
Maharidge said he believes more attention should
be paid to events in which people positively interrelate.
"I am trying to find the great middle ground where
things are working, and I hope to make people more
aware of these situations," he said.
"I believe that education for this problem should
start in schools," Maharidge said. "You need to get kids
talking at an early age, in groups, and asking questions
as well as generating ideas on
their own."
Maharidge added that he
would like to increase people's
awareness of existing situations
in which cultural exchange takes
place. "You cannot really be an
overt racist in a California work
place, you cannot function in a
large company being racist here,"
he asserted.
While he admits racist think
ing persists, Maharidge points out
that social norms teach people to
peacefully coexist. "So, Ido feel. .
. that we need to look at what is
working and figure out why,
instead of just focusing on the
extreme left or right of the situa
tion."
Drawing on his own experi
ences, Maharidge asserts that the
media is terrified of racial issues.
"When something racially
charged happens, anything which
is politically incorrect — even if it
is a quote — is edited out," he
said.

Maharidge contended that
honest journalism, which he said
is lacking, would help solve the
problem. "We need to get to the
real issues, because by ignoring
the problem, we will not make it
go away," he said.
Maharidge identified three
areas — school, the workplace
and the media — where all the
cultures meet. "In these places,
we need to get people talking hon
estly about these issues and work
ing to solve prejudices and the
assumptions involved," he said.
The Freedom Forum is a non
profit, non-partisan, internation
al foundation dedicated to the
free press and speech. It is sup
ported by a $700 million endow
ment established by Frank E.
Gannett. The fund awards up to
20 grants a year.
"The aim of this program is to
supply small amounts of money to
professional journalists currently
teaching in American universi
ties," said James Carey, professor
of journalism at Columbia Uni
versity and chairman of this
year's judging committee. "It is a
program which encourages them
to remain journalists."
