How do the college you attend and the
choices you make in college shape your
life? Is an elite education worth the invest
ment? Cream of the Crop examines these
issues systematically. In the book we meet
members of the Stanford University class
of 1981 ten years after graduation. Their
stories show how the rising professional
elite has dealt with such issues as reconcil
ing career and family, defining success,
and finding satisfaction in work.
This event will be held at the Bookstore on camp us.
