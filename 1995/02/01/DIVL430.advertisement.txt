Mitsubishi Electric is one of the world's foremost developers and manufacturer of innovative
electronic and electric equipment. To continue to develop standard-setting technologies and to
assure international competitiveness, we are currently recruiting Technical Graduates
(Bachelors/Masters Degree) from top North American and European Universities.
Initial assignments of three years will be at one of our facilities in Japan. Subsequent career
placements will vary by individual; but typically would be targeted for the person's "home country."
Selected candidates will receive extensive preparation and training in conversational Japanese as
well as customs and culture before departing to Japan.
Mitsubishi Electric representatives will be on your campus on Wednesday, February 15 from 8:45
to 4:30. Students who have already graduated or will be graduating in spring of 1995 and are
interested in a career should fax their resume for immediate consideration to (714) 220-4662.
Selected candidates will be contacted by phone to schedule an interview. If you have questions or
