Cubans transferred to base
PANAMA CITY (AP) - U.S. Army engi
neers and anti-riot units tightened security
yesterday at refugee camps along the Pana
ma Canal to prevent escapes and violence
while transferring 7,500 Cuban boat people
to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba.
About 1,250 U.S. troops have been flown
into Panama to provide extra help during the
daily transfer of some 500 Cubans beginning
today. That's in addition to 2,000 American
troops regularly based here.
Gen. George Crocker, commander of the
joint task force overseeing the transfer, said
Monday that "there are some individuals
who want to cause problems, but we are
ready for any contingency."
Refugees yesterday said security is so

tight, they don't think anyone will try to flee.
New road opens
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) â€”
Scores of sick and wounded left one besieged
Muslim enclave for another yesterday under an
accord U.N. officials hoped would be a step
towards peace in Bosnia.
As more than 90 Muslims, some of whom
had been surrounded by Serbs for most of the
34-month-old war, crossed Serb territory from
the eastern enclave of Gorazde to Sarajevo, Serb
and government officials signed an agreement
to open a road into the Bosnian capital today.
But U.N. officials said that agreement would
do little to improve life in the capital because
last-minute Serb demands led to restrictions on
who could use the road, which runs through
Sarajevo airport.
