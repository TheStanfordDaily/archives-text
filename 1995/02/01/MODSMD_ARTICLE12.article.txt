# $408 package for Mexico scrapped
## New aid by U.S. intended to avert financial disaster 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Facing
unyielding opposition in Congress,
President Clinton scrapped a $40 bil
lion rescue plan for Mexico yesterday
and hurriedly assembled a substitute
package combining U.S. money with
international aid. "We cannot risk
further delay," Clinton said.
Racing against what the adminis
tration said was the imminent threat
of financial default by Mexico, Clinton
invoked presidential authority to
commit $20 billion for loans and loan
guarantees to the government of
President Ernesto Zedillo.
"The situation was dire in Mexico,"
Secretary of State Warren Christo
pher said, commenting on Monday's
plunge in the value of the peso. Trea
sury Secretary Robert Rubin said

"the likelihood is very high" that the
new aid will avert a financial catastro
phe.
Mexican financial markets and the
peso rallied yesterday after Clinton's
announcement.
International lenders increased
their aid pledges by $15 billion, to a
total of $27.8 billion. Canada and a
group of Latin American countries
pledged $1 billion apiece.
The end run around Congress was
a gamble for Clinton, drawing on
money that usually would be used to
defend the value of the U.S. dollar. It
also means he shoulders most of the
political risk of supporting Mexico's
nosediving peso rather than sharing it
with Congress.
"This is in the interest of America,

contrary to what some have said,"
Clinton asserted, answering criticism
that his proposals amount to a bailout
for U.S. banks and Wall Street
investors with millions tied up in
Mexican bonds.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich and
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
joined Democratic leaders in endors
ing Clinton's move. "This is an impor
tant undertaking and we believe that
the risks of inaction vastly exceed any
risks associated with this action," the
leaders said in a joint statement
released at the White House.
"He (Clinton) didn't have the votes
on the loan guarantees," Dole said on
Capitol Hill. "He wouldn't have the
votes next week. He wouldn't have
the votes the week after that."
