# Europe floods worst since 1953
## 
### 
AMSTERDAM, Netherlands
(AP) — Dozens of Dutch hamlets
became ghost towns yesterday as
tens of thousands fled surging
rivers that threatened to breach
dikes and flood farmlands. At
least one person drowned.
Flood waters that killed at
least 27 people in northwestern
Europe earlier this week began
to recede. But the flooding
wasn't expected to peak until
today in the Netherlands, where
most land is below sea level.
On Monday, about 15,000 peo
ple left low-lying farmlands of
their own volition. Yesterday,
the evacuations were mandatory:
Dutch authorities declared a
state of emergency and ordered
70,000 people out of "polders,"
farmland reclaimed over the cen
turies from marsh and river
basins.
Highways north from the
flooded areas were clogged yes
terday night after officials asked
100,000 more to leave the danger
zones.

Dozens of Dutch farming
hamlets along the Maas and
Waal rivers were deserted yester
day, residents fleeing with little
more than the clothes on their
backs.
"The rest of the village has
gone," a teen-age girl walking
with three children down the
empty street of one village told
Dutch Television. "But we still
have some animals with us and
we cannot leave them behind."
More than a hundred buses
rounded up people in the Bom
melerwaard, Wamel, Druten and
Ooijpolder and took them to
evacuation centers. Officials said
the evacuation was orderly.
Tens of thousands of farm
animals also had to be shipped
out of the polders to keep them
from drowning.
Jan Roelofs, a crisis center
spokesman in Nijmegen, said the
dikes were "stable, but weak."
But if even one dike burst, some
villages would be sunk in up to
16 feet of water. And water could

submerge secondary highways
and cut off escape routes.
"I have 6,000 chickens,"
screamed one farmer over the
telephone to the local crisis cen
ter at the Waal River town of
Beneden-Leeuwen. "I am staying
put. You don't get me out."
Dutch farmers prepared for
the flood by shipping livestock to
market early, since they
wouldn't be able to graze the ani
mals on flooded land.
The flooding was the worst
since 1953, when the North Sea
dikes in the southern Zeeland
province burst, killing more than
1,800 people. The dikes that
were threatened yesterday were
not sea dikes, however, but river
dikes, and the threat to life was
believed to be less extreme.
The first death from the
Dutch floods was reported yes
terday, a 52-year-old woman who
drowned in the Waal River vil
lage of Winssen, said Ruud
Schelder, a spokesman for the
crisis center in Nijmegen.
