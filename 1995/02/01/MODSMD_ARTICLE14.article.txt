# Unfunded mandates bill faces test
## Act as part of GOP 'Contract with America' expected to pass easily 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
House acted yesterday to limit the
impact of lawsuits that might result
from passage of a bill restricting
Congress' practice of imposing pro
grams on local governments with
out paying for them.
As the House moved toward pas
sage of the "Unfunded Mandates
Reform Act," lawmakers passed by
voice vote an amendment saying
people cannot use lawsuits over
mandates to halt implementation of
federal regulations.
The bill is expected to pass easily
when it comes up for a final vote
today. The Senate passed its ver
sion by 86-10 last Friday, and con
gressional sources said the two
chambers should be able to work
out differences quickly before send
ing the final version to President
Clinton for signing. Clinton has
indicated his support for the bill.
The measure would be the second
major element of the GOP "Con
tract with America" to become law,
following a bill that makes Congress

abide by the same employment laws
that the private sector must obey.
The unfunded mandates bill
requires the federal government to
pay for many programs that cost
states and localities more than $50
million. Federal agencies would also
have to provide cost-benefit analy
ses for new regulations costing local
governments and the private sector
more than $100 million.
Some lawmakers have been con
cerned that the private sector
would sue federal agencies over
alleged failures to carry out the
bill's requirements in order to stop
enforcement of anti-pollution, safe
ty or other regulations.
"We don't want to open up a Pan
dora's box of opportunity to liti
gate," said Rep. James Moran, D-
Va., the amendment's sponsor.
At the U.S. Chamber of Com
merce, a leading supporter of the
mandates bill, Jeff Joseph said, "We
want the ability of judicial review."
But the chamber wants the bill
passed even with the limitations on

the right to sue, said Joseph, the
chamber's vice president for domes
tic policy.
It was one of the rare instances
of bipartisan cooperation during
seven days of contentious debate
over the mandates bill, an impor
tant part of the House Republicans'
"Contract With America."
While many Democrats favor
ending unfunded mandates —
which costs states and local govern
ments billions of dollars annually —
the new minority party has objected
to what it says have been the
strong-arm tactics of the Republi
cans. They also have warned that
the law could affect vital environ
mental, safety and health regula
tions.
In a session that went past mid
night Monday night, the Republi
cans, with some Democratic help,
rejected 11 straight Democratic
amendments seeking to exempt
Medicare, programs concerning
children and seniors and other pro
grams from the bill.
