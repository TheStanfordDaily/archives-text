# Chechens refuse to submit
## War spills out of Grozny 
### 
GROZNY, Russia (AP) — Taking the war
to every corner of Chechnya, Russian troops
attacked one town with armored vehicles yes
terday and blasted at least two others with
artillery.
Word also emerged of savage bombing
raids on mountain villages in the south of the
secessionist republic. A British photographer
who returned from one remote site told of an
attack on a farm in which Russian fighter jets
killed a woman and decapitated four of her
children.
As the war approached the two-month
mark, Moscow's troops lobbed more artillery
shells into central Grozny despite a thick fog
and continued to battle outmanned Chechen
fighters for full control of the ruined capital.
But the war appeared to be spilling more
and more into towns and villages, where resi
dents refuse to submit to the Russian mili
tary.
"They will need more than just Grozny,"
Ruslan, a bus driver, declared defiantly in
Achkhoi-Martan, west of Grozny. "They'll
need all of Chechnya."
Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev has
been in hiding but still controls Chechen

fighters, according to Ruslan Aushev, presi
dent of the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia.
"Dudayev is in Grozny and is leading his
armed forces," Aushev's press service said
yesterday in response to comments by a top
Kremlin official that he was sheltering
Dudayev.
Heavy fighting broke out yesterday in a
previously peaceful area of western Chech
nya.
Russian armored vehicles rolled to the
edge of Samashky, which straddles a strategic
highway 20 miles west of Grozny, and blasted
it with heavy fire in apparent revenge for a
clash the previous day.
In that battle, according to fighters on
both sides, a Russian column of about 20
armored personnel carriers and trucks was
rumbling toward Grozny when they spotted
men wearing Chechen military fatigues and
opened fire.
Chechen militia responded with bazooka
and gunfire and smashed an armored person
nel carrier in two, killing at least five Russian
soldiers. The blackened remains of the vehi
cle lay by the roadside yesterday.
