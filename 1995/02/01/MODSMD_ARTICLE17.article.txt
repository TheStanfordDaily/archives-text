FEE REFUNDS CAME and
went this quarter without
much notice. Advertisements
ran for two days before the dead
line.
And that was it.
A little quick for those who aren't
on the ASSU fast-track — and a lot
quicker than in past quarters.
Perhaps it was because of all the
attention given to the Balanced
Funding Deal debate, or maybe it's
because they really needed the
money.
For whatever reason, the ASSU
forgot to get the word out to stu
dents about the eligibility period for
quarterly refunds — until it was
almost too late.
Typically, they inform students a
few times — at the beginning of the
quarter and then as tne deadline is
approaching. And students are
given ample time to decide which
groups to fund and which not to
fund.
This quarter, ironically amid an
effort to axe refunds altogether, the

reftind process was compromised to
the point where hardly any people
were well-informed about the dead
line by the time it passed.
Certainly, this is a boon for stu
dent groups, many of whom receive
their main source of income from
student fees.
But as much as some of these
groups deserve their money, the
students also deserve a say in
whether to give it to them or not.
This time, the students' voices were
effectively bypassed.
Whether this was a deliberate
attempt at preserving student
group funding or whether it was
simply an oversight, an extended
winter quarter fee-refund deadline
would set the record straight for
everyone.
It is unfair to expect that stu
dents, especially those who are still
unfamiliar with the system, will
remember about the refund period
without being reminded. It is only
reasonable to expect that the ASSU
will do its job and remind them.
