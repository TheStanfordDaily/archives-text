Anew grading policy? a
new DR system? A new sci
ence quad? The university set
ting has always been a place for
rapid change and development.
However, lately it may seem that
almost nothing stays the same. The
most disgruntling part about such
significant changes at Stanford is
that many students feel they have
little or no say in the proposals.
In October, University President
Gerhard Casper announced that a
$77.4 million grant from William
Hewlett and David Packard would
be used to build a new science and
engineering complex west of the
Quad. These plans fortunately
include an opportunity for students
and faculty to give input about the
proposed renovations.
A small-scale model of the Science
and Engineering Quad (SEQ) will be
on display beginning this week in
the McCullough Building and last
ing through May. The display also
includes drawings, maps and time

lines for the project. In addition,
staff members will be present at the
center weekday mornings to explain
the material and field any questions.
The effort on the part of the plan
ning committee and the University
to gather community input is com
mendable. Although the goal of this
outreach program is not to obtain
ideas about the SEQ's design, the
team does hope to provide an arena
for community members to have
questions answered and to voice
their concerns about potential con
struction difficulties. As Mark
Jones, director of Facilities Project
Management, said, the goal is for a
"low impact" program. He and other
planners will try to sequence the
renovations, constructions and
demolitions to inconvenience as few
people as possible.
So, kudos to the managers of this
program. As members of the Stan
ford community, we appreciate your
interest in our questions and con
cerns.
