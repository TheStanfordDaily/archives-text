# ASSU committee to probe ethics of Ask Stanford
## Senators question new publication 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Contributing writer 
The ASSU voted last night to
form a committee to investigate
allegations of misuse of funds
and abuse of authority by the
Students' Alliance, Associated
Students Consulting, its chief ex
ecutive officer undergraduate
senator Steve Russell and Publi
cations Board Chair Danny
Bressler.
At the center of the dispute are
three allegations: that Russell de
ceived the Pub Board as to the
true purpose of his publication
Ask Stanford and improperly
used the resulting student funds
in an election campaign; that
Russell improperly used his in
fluence as business manager of
the Stanford Directory; and that
Bressler behaved inappropriate
ly-
Ask Stanford stirred contro
versy last week when the first
edition of the newsletter ap

peared as a publication of the Al
liance and attacked the Balanced
Funding Deal, an ASSU amend
ment designed to reform the spe
cial-fee system on which students
were voting.
The People's Platform party
alleges that Russell misrepresent
ed the purpose of Ask Stanford to
the Pub Board.
"Clearly ethical standards were
breached," said Mike Choo,
deputy senate chair and People's
Platform member. "These breach
es included misrepresentation
and the use of student fees in
order to pay for [the anti-Bal
anced Funding DealJ campaign."

'Clearly ethical
standards were
breached.'
— Mike Choo

Russell denies these charges.
"Both the Appropriations Com
mittee and the Election Commis
sioner Jonathan Berent said that
this was a protected publication,
not campaign material," Russell
said.
Additionally since Ask Stan
ford spent none of its money, and
has withdrawn its request for fur
ther funds, Russell said, there are
no grounds for asserting financial
impropriety.
By withdrawing its request,
though, Council of Presidents
member Mork Murdock said,
"Russell has acknowledged that
his group didn't have a right to
that funding."
Murdock said that even if Ask
Stanford didn't actually use its
allocated money, it still tried to.
"The issue is over the attempt to
spend the funds," he said.
Russell has also been accused
of misusing his influence at the
Stanford Directory. According to a
report by ASSU Financial Manag
er Gabe Lucas, Russell used his
power to list the Associated Stu
dents Consulting under the head
ing for ASSU in the directory,
even though it is not a part of the
ASSU and is in fact a subsidiary of
the Student's Alliance.
Russell denies any impropriety.
"When ASC was started, it was to
do logistical consulting, as soon as
we realized [that the group would
become partisan), we disconnect-

Ed the number," he said.
Lucas' report claimed that
Bressler violated Pub Board
bylaws by being the only one to
interview Ask Stanford about its
winter funding request.
Bressler said that the other two
members of the approving com
mittee didn't show up for the
interview, but that he informed
them after the proceedings.
"I understand the reality [of
people not showing up], but the
senate can't spend the same
amount of time in the scrutiny
process that people in the front
line can," Lucas said. "There
should be more than one person
on the committee that interviews
applicants. Peo-

pie have to be
held account
able."
Additionally,
Lucas contended
that Bressler vio
lated Pub Board
bylaws by never
notifying Lucas
of a request by
Ask Stanford to

use the appropriated fall quarter
money in winter quarter.
"I either notified Gabe verbally
or e-mailed him about the
request," Bressler said. "I have
never requested such an exten
sion and had it turned down. His
torically, I would just let him
know."
Both sides claim that party pol
itics are responsible for the con
flict.
"The People's Platform set out
to destroy the ASC by any means
possible," Russell said.
The Platform, however, denies
these charges. "I don't think there
is anything partisan about the
student body knowing the details
of this issue," Choo said. "I think
it's appalling that no senator
wanted to address [this issue] for
fear that it will look partisan."
Graduate senator Mike Bailey,
who sponsored the resolution
which created the committee, also
denied claims of bias. He noted
that all members of the committee
were independent senators and
additionally that the Student's
Alliance had initially supported
the committee.
The committee is composed of
independent senators Bailey, Don
Aingworth, Mark Cordoba and
Rupali Gandhi, and will be over
seen by Jewell Hudson, ASSU
Legal Counselor.
