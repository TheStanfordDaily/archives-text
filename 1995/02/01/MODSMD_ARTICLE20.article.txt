## Intimacy through words 
### 
THOUGH NO DOUBT many have
observed this before me, I find
that one of the very strange but
wonderful aspects of writing is the fact
that the written word is at once a con
versation with no one, and everyone.
Sometimes the odd silence of that con
versation is unbearable; we are work
ing, tirelessly working, for the unseen.
As writers, we offer our words with no
assurance that anyone will listen. As
readers, we ask questions of a text
when we know it cannot answer back.
In those times of silence, I am grate
ful for all of those who have made the
effort to talk about the issues I have
raised in this column. These people
bring another side to the conversation,
extending and enriching the dialogue
with their unique challenges and com
miserations. I think of the woman with
the hat in the Coffeehouse one Friday
afternoon, or my thesis adviser with his
gifted questions and suggestions. I
think of my mother using my columns
to stimulate discussions with people
who have never been inside a place like
Stanford. I think of the three men who
stopped me on Campus Drive, with
their marvelous range of thoughts and
voices, telling me that they understood.
These moments of communion sus
tain the writer in times of difficulty.
Writing is often difficult, and lonely.
When done honestly, writing demands
a frightening vulnerability; the writer

must put herself out there — in words
— for all to see and hear and do with
what they will.
The question is what we, as the writ
ers of our own future, will choose to do
with the words we are given. Too often
today words are used as weapons of ver
bal violence, blindly cutting down the
opposition. These writers abuse their
work, they give in to their fear of the
unseen. They commit written acts of
aggression because they are afraid to
let their words stand for themselves,
without defense.
These writers know that our words
are one of the only things that are part
of us because we want them to be. They
know that while we cannot choose
where we are born or what we look like,
we can choose the things we do and say.
In this way, words are the truest part of
ourselves, they come from the deep and
soulful part that does not lie. What
these writers have forgotten is that
words themselves cannot claim author
ity, only authors. They have forgotten
what it is to converse, to turn together
in words that have the spirit of offer
ing. For that is what writing is, and
what learning is; giving something of
ourselves through our experience, in
the hope that we may somehow be
joined.
In her book of dialogues with Cornel
West, the Black intellectual bell hooks
articulates this exchange through the

concept of testimony. Describing testi
mony as an occasion where "the believ
er stands before the community ... in
order to give account of the hope that is
in him or her," hooks suggests that all
dialogue serves a dual purpose; to
strengthen the individual's faith and to
help "build a faith of the community."
The stance echoes that of our written
conversation, and confirms its creative
and connective role in our lives. We are
writers and we are builders, and we can
believe that the unseen silence before
us will speak.
I thank those who choose to listen
and speak out in our mutual struggle to
understand each other. We may not
always agree, but when spoken in truth
we can be sure that our words have the
power to heal, to strengthen and to
change. My goal throughout this col
umn was to offer something that would
draw people together in conversation:
readers and writers, students and
teachers, all of us. And so the last
words I will give you are words given to
me by Virginia Woolf: "It was not
knowledge but unity she desired, not
inscriptions on tablets, nothing that
could be written in any language
known to man, but intimacy itself,
which is knowledge."

Elizabeth Kelly wants to thank all of
her partners in conversation.
