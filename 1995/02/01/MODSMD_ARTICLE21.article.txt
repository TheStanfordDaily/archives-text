Scientists should consider the possibility of a 'young earth 9

This letter is an open invitation to
all scientists, researchers and stu
dents of science. In your studies
you undoubtedly come across the issue
of the earth's age. Modern science esti
mates this to be 4.5 billion years. I
would like, however, to propose the pos
sibility of a young earth and I invite you
to consider this possibility in your
research.
There is much evidence in favor of
this position, although it is rarely found
in the popular press or standard scientif
ic textbooks. My purpose is to ask you to
consider the evidence for and possibility
of a young earth. I presume that many of
you are familiar with at least some of the
evidence. Let me give just one example.

Both the earth and moon encounter
many solid particles as they travel
through space. These particles burn up
on hitting the atmosphere, become fine
dust and, if big enough, can be seen as
"shooting stars." The resulting dust set
tles to earth. This same phenomenon
occurs on the moon. Isaac Asimov esti
mated that over nearly five billion years,
a layer 54 feet deep would have accumu
lated on the earth. Wind and water
could have carried this dust into the
seas, it is argued, but there is no wind or
rain on the moon, so any dust falling on
the moon's surface would remain undis
turbed. At the time of the Apollo pro
gram, scientists were concerned with
this. There was the prospect that the

Apollo lunar module might sink into a
layer of fine dust! It was therefore
equipped with large pad feet. The
moon's surface, as it turned out, had a
layer of dust only a fraction of an inch
thick, indicating possibly a much
younger earth than current estimates.
By "young earth," I mean an estimate
of the earth's age under 10,000 years.
Because scientific dogma asserts that
the earth is 4.5 billion years old, scien
tists are forced to approach evidence
with this preconception. Scientists
should be free, however, to examine evi
dence with as few initial assumptions as
possible. If certain evidence seems to
support a young age, scientists should
have the courage to present it as such.

Consider Robert Gentry's statement in
1967 regarding his work on radio-halos:
"is it conceivable that one of the oldest
cosmological theories known to man
[Biblical Creation] is correct after all?
Could the earth have been created by
fiat?"
I believe we as scientists need to ask
ourselves the same questions that Gen
try asks. If we are not even willing to
consider these questions, I believe that
scientific progress will suffer as the free
flow of ideas is impeded. We must be
willing to question our assumptions and
preconceptions if we are to succeed in
our research.
