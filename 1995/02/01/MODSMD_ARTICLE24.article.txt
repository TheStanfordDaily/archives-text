## Satellite expedition maps, photographs lunar surface

While most people at Stanford eagerly await the
annual tradition of Full Moon on the Quad, some sci
entists spend their lifetime researching the moon and
the exciting things it can provide people on earth —
besides the occasional peck on the lips.
Richard Simpson, a senior research associate in
electrical engineering, has devoted his time lately to
The Clementine Project — a mission which developed
digital images of the moon using four cameras. He
joined the project after its inception two years earlier.
"They [NASA researchers] were just coming up
with the idea of Clementine. It was supposed to be a
spin-off of Star Wars in the defense industry," Simp
son explained.
After the Star Wars project seemed to lose some of
its momentum, the researchers still desired the
implementation of The Clementine Project. Under an
agreement with NASA, the scientists built the octag
onal prism-shaped spacecraft with four major cam
eras as well as a laser ranging system.
The data collected from the two meter high space
craft — whose name was coined after the song about
the daughter of a miner, 'My Darling Clementine,' —
will help scientists map rock types and determine the
mineral content of the moon, as well as provide
researchers with their first glimpse of the global topo
graphic figure of the moon.
The mission, which was launched February 19,
1994, lasted about 71 days and charted the moon in
eleven visible and infrared colors. The 38 million
square kilometer surface photographed was the first
global digital data for the moon.
With the help of the equipment on the craft, the
mission collected over one million high resolution and
thermal infrared images. Besides identifying the gen
eral color of the moon, the Clementine mission also
addressed the question of whether there are ice
deposits on the moon.
Working on determining the presence or absence
of ice on the moon, Simpson helped the researchers
collect data and suggested to them ways to test the
moon's ice composition. The question of ice on the
moon remains open for investigation, Simpson said.
"If scientists found ice on the moon, it would add a
huge cushion for any future plans to colonize the
moon, because it would enable people to travel to the

moon without lugging any sort of water supply,"
Simpson said.
In the search for ice, the Clementine scientists
took aim at the south pole. Using some of the pictures
from the cameras, previously unseen regions of the
south pole were mapped. The team of researchers
created a mosaic of the south pole with the assistance
of 1500 images taken by an ultraviolet visible camera.
One previously unknown region, near the pole,
contains a large basin that has never seen sunlight.
This occurs because of the rotational axis of the moon
and its orientation perpendicular to the orbital plane
around the sun.
Simpson, and other scientists, beUeved that this
region — called a 'cold trap'— would have water
molecules in it caused by impacts of comets. In order
to study the presence or absence of ice, Simpson, in
collaboration with NASA and other researchers,
designed an experiment that beamed radio waves into
the polar areas.
The radio waves sent into the region would be
affected by the presence of ice. Unlike the rocky
regions of the moon that absorb the transmitted sig
nals, the icy regions strongly reflect the radio waves.
In the experiment, a small increase in the echo
strength from the radio transmitter was recorded.
However this small change did not provide conclusive
evidence that there was ice on the moon. After having
the spacecraft make three orbits around the south
pole, nothing unusual happened.
"There wasn't any obvious signal that showed the
existence of any type of ice on the moon," Simpson
said. Researchers believe that if ice did exist on the
moon, it would not be in the shape of huge glaciers.
Rather, the ice would be camouflaged or mixed in
with other materials.
The final analysis of the data is still a long way
from being completed. In order to facilitate the anal
ysis of this data, the project needs monetary support.
Simpson still believes the question of ice on the
moon still can be researched. "They [the
researchers] need to go back and calibrate the instru
ments to make sure all the results make sense quan
titatively."
Although it seems that NASA has put this issue of
data analysis on hold, Simpson, with the help of other
researchers, hopes to submit a paper about the mis
sion for further review in April.
