Q: "If you shave your hair,
will it grow back thick
er?"
-anonymous
A : I have actually received
/\ this question from several
XApeople ... they don't men
tion which hair, or whether it is
being shaved voluntarily — you
know the famous prank of shav
ing a person's eyebrow if they
pass out. But I finally got a
definitive answer from the Med
ical Center's Dermatology
department.
Shaving your hair, whether
legs, facial, head, or elsewhere,
will not cause it to grow back
thicker. There's actually no rea
son to assume that this would
be the case. Your hair has no
way of knowing what's going on
above the skin. So shaving it will
not cause more folli-

cles to develop —
which would create
more hairs— or
make the hair shafts
thicker or darker.
Some of the fol
licularily curious
people who posed
this question sug
gested that the hair
that is already
exposed gets
bleached, so the new
hair will be darker. '
However, as I
explained last quar
ter, your hair

doesn't know how long it is;
hair grows for a certain length
of time, rather than to a cer
tain length. So if you cut your
hair, it won't re-grow unless it
was planning to grow anyway.
Any dark hairs that emerge
would have emerged even if
you hadn't shaved.
However, there are a couple
of effects that could make it
seem as if the hair is growing
back thicker. For instance,
many people start shaving body
parts when they hit puberty. At
this point, hair growth is
increasing anyway due to
increasing hormone levels. So
when you shave, the next time
your hair grows back there will
be more, simply because your
hairiness factor is increasing
overall.
Of course this does have a
down side: you can't suddenly
re-grow a luxurious patch of
hair on your head simply by

shaving it all off and waiting for
it to re-grow. But I hope this
provides a little reassurance to
those who, willingly or unwill
ingly, have shaved the hair in
more discrete places.
e: "What good is shampoo?
Does all of this protein
enriched stuff do any-
And is it true that sham
pooing can help your hair grow
more?"
—don't hate me because I'm
beautiful
A: The thing to remember
with these hair questions
is that the hair above your
skin is dead. So it's not going to
do anything like incorporate
protein or vitamins or anything
that you stick on it. It's like try
ing to fertilize a dead tree. And
even more, the protein in pro
tein shampoos isn't even related
to keratin, the protein that
makes up your hair.
The main thing that

shampoo does accom
plish is clean off any dirt,
grease, and other junk
that may accumulate on
your hair, depending on
how long you wait to
wash it. The main ingre
dients in shampoo —
ammonium lauryl sul
fate — are detergents
which allow the grease in
your dirty locks to be
whisked away by the
water, leaving your hair
nice and pure.
A story I've told here
before, but probably

deserves repeating at this point,
is that shampoo actually cleans
off so much of the stuff on your
hair that people in developed
countries can no longer sell
their hair for wigs (a la Gift of
the Magi). Without the grease
and wax, your hair is too brittle
to be sewn into wigs. So there's
one less way of earning your
tuition money.
On the other hand, sham
poos that claim to condition or
moisturize mainly take all the
dirty junk off your hair and then
put something else back on
(basically a lubricant) to make it
feel smooth again. But your hair
really doesn't absorb any of this
stuff. So get over yourself
Pantene girl. The shampoo is
not what's doing it for you.
