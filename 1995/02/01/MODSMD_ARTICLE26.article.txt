# Tiny chip to transmit multiple data
## Telemetry may help monitor surgery, environment 
### Julie Sauer Editorial staff 
A small transmitting chip, measuring 2 mil
limeters on each side, may provide researchers
with the ability to gather data from laboratory
animals, record the toxicity of water, and aid in
fetal operations.
Rafael Betancourt-Zamora, a graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering, is currently work
ing on a chip that would be used for radio teleme
try — measuring signals or data and sending the
information to remote locations.
Betancourt-Zamora, who works in the lab of
Gregory Kovacs, an assistant professor of Elec
trical Engineering, described the purpose of the
telemetry experiments. "In a general sense, any
time you have sensors, you have a need for
telemetry," he said. "You don't want to deal with
the materials themselves — you just want the
measurements," he explained.
Researchers in Kovacs' lab are trying to make
a chip that may be implanted in a nerve to mea
sure and transmit nerve signals. Betancourt-
Zamora and fellow graduate student Todd
Whitehurst are both developing technology that
will be useful to the neural interface project.
Whitehurst has developed a chip perforated
with an 8 hole by 8 hole matrix and containing 64
different electrodes. These microelectrodes will
measure 64 different nerve signals from a
peripheral nerve; however, the nerve signals are
small microvolts that must be amplified before
they are transmitted.
As a result, Whitehurst's chip contains a 'mul
tiplexer' — a switch that selects the signals one at
a time and rapidly alternates between them at a
rate of 20,000 times per second each.
After the amplification process, an analog dig
ital converter measures the signal and converts it
to a binary number which can then be sent by a
radiotransmitter to an outside receiver.
While Whitehurst's chip can measure the
nerve signals, it needs wires to transmit them
outside the animal's body. Betancourt-Zamora's
experimental chip will transmit the signals over
radio waves to an external receiver.
"The problem is to get the nerve signals out
[of the animal]," he said. "Now we do it with
wires, but the rat must be opened to hook up the

wires and get the signals out... this is not prac
tical," he admitted.
As an alternative to the current methods,
Betancourt-Zamora's radiotransmitter can take
eight channels of nerve signals and transmit
them as radio signals.
Although Whitehurst's chip can measure 64
signals, it is possible to transmit only eight of those
signals. Betancourt-Zamora is not ready to trans
mit all 64 signals. "Eight is reasonable," he said.
The technologies developed by Whitehurst
and Betancourt-Zamora are both necessary for
the successful functioning of the neuron-chip
interface, because one chip measures the signals
and one chip transmits them.
Telemetry emerged as a serious research field
ten to 20 years ago, in the late 1970s and early
1980s. Stanford scientists participated in the
efforts. Now the focus is on reducing the size of
the transmitting chip.
"The idea is to make the whole transmitter
the size of a single chip [2mm x 2mm]," Betan
court-Zamora said. The battery forms a substan
tial portion of the current chips; even the small
est batteries are large relative to the transmitting
section of the chip.
The telemetry project in Kovacs' lab is cur
rently supported by Stanford. Researchers at
NASA Ames and the University of California,
San Francisco are also collaborating on a similar

project, but their work is not associated with
Stanford.
NASA and UCSF are building chips using
commercially available parts like amplifiers and
microprocessors; these 'hybrid' models will be
assembled from separate components. In con
trast, Betancourt-Zamora's chip will be a single,
'custom' chip.
The potential applications for telemetry cover
a wide range, from projects with laboratory ani
mals to operations on humans.
For example, Betancourt-Zamora described
NASA's idea for experiments that would use
telemetry to record measurements from rats in
space. Researchers in these kinds of projects
often need measurements recorded continuous
ly. 'Implantable telemetry' — placing measuring
instruments inside an animal — would make this
feasible.
Environmental problems also offer opportuni
ties for implementing telemetry; sensors could
record amounts of chemicals or other toxic sub
stances in water. This information could be
transmitted to a receiver located away from the
source, thereby eliminating the need for contact
with hazardous material.
Scientists at UCSF also hope to use telemetry
for fetal surgery; after prenatal surgery, the
baby's condition inside the womb could be moni
tored by a minute transmitter.
