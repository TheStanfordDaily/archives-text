## Sweep for No.3 ladies Women's tennis bites Bulldogs 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The Stanford women's tennis team completed
its second consecutive dual-match sweep yester
day with a 9-0 old-fashioned whopping of the
Fresno State Bulldogs. The No. 3-ranked squad
advanced to 2-0 in the young season.
The Cardinal had to sht&e off some inconve
nient viruses before the match as Kim Shasby
and Sandra De Silva found themselves out of
commission due to the flu. The two had been slat
ed to move up in the lineup as Katie Schlukebir
and Ania Bleszynski planned to rest due to their
upcoming participation in this week's Rolex
National Indoors in Dallas.
"We had to juggle our lineup a little bit," said
head coach Frank Brennan. The juggling act
eventually found Schlukebir back in the No. 1
slot, followed by freshman Julie Scott and senior
Amy Chiminello.
However, it made little difference, as Schluke
bir, Scott and Chiminello (all 2-0), despite the
short-notice changes, disposed of
their opponents with ease. The
three top singles matches saw Fres
no State seize no more than two
matches in any given set, playing
the least number of sets possible.
Schlukebir bulldozed the Bull
dogs' Marta Pitarch 6-0, 6-2.
"[Schlukebir's] so focused, so deter
mined," Chiminello said. "Even on
her worst days, she's great."
Scott, playing three spots higher
than on Saturday, blew by Amy
Gallagher with a score of 6-2, 6-2.
Chiminello dominated opponent
Kristy Smith, winning 6-1, 6-1 for
the second straight time in three
days.
Sophomore Emily Burt, junior
Wendy Sacks and freshman Heidi
Stalla performed no less spectacu
larly as all three also won in
straight sets. In the No. 4 match,
Burt coasted 6-1 in the first set. She
then struggled early in the second,
falling behind 1-2, but captured five
straight games to take the contest.
Sacks and Stalla both won in
their first appearances of the '94-
'95 season. "I have every confidence
that Wendy will get the job done,"
Brennan said. "I was real pleased to
get Heidi in there too. She got a lit
tle anxious when she saw the finish
line."
Stalla jumped on her opponent,
Adriana Gavaldon, 6-2 in the first
set, but took a little longer in the
second with a 6-4 victory.
The Cardinal looked as if it
would have even less trouble in the
doubles competition as the No. 2
team of Scott and Chiminello
cruised 6-0, 6-3. However, Fresno

State hung tough in both the No. 1
and No. 3 duels.
Burt and freshmen Sophy
Woodhouse fought through a
tedious first set to take a 6-4 advan
tage and then rode the momentum
to finish the match in the second
set, 6-2. The Bulldogs then took
their only set of the afternoon in the
No. 1-doubles match featuring
Bleszynski and Schlukebir versus
Pitarch and Gallagher.
The Cardinal seemed to domi
nate the first set as it rallied behind
Schlukebir's intimidat ing serve and
net play for a 6-2 victory. Fresno
State then went to the lob, frustrat
ing Bleszynski and the Cardinal for
a 4-6 second-set steal.
Bleszynski finally settled down,

shaking off illness and the Bulldogs
with a deadly serve that led them to
a victory with a 6-2 third set.
Although the competition has
not been the finest in the first two
meets, Brennan does not underesti
mate the importance of victory.
"I'm a big believer in wins," Bren
nan said. "I think you do learn from
losing, but it also hurts your confi
dence."
The athletes can also attest to
the value of the early wins.
"These are helpful even though
you are expected to win," said
senior co-captain Chiminello. "It
turns up your level of intensity. As
long as you take them seriously,
they get you used to dual match
es."
