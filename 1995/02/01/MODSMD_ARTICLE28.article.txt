Although the NHL lockout just ended and teams
are beginning to play, hockey in the Bay Area has been
going strong all winter long. The Stanford hockey
team will wrap up its season this weekend with big
games at home against San Jose State and at Califor
nia in the season finale. Wins against both of those
teams would give Stanford a berth in the National
Club Hockey Association national tournament in Ft.
Collins, Colo., March 1-4.
The hockey team, whose season started in mid-
October, has built a 7-4-2 record so far this season.
Stanford and Cal have established themselves as the
two best club hockey teams on the West Coast, and
both of Stanford's tie games have come against Cal. If
Stanford defeats San Jose State, the winner of the
Stanford vs. Cal game will become the West Coast rep
resentative to the national tournament.
"This game is basically like a playoff game," said
senior Eric Haug, a defenseman as well as president
and one of the captains of the team.
