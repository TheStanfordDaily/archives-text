# Icemen hope for Nationals Cal stands in way

Although the NHL lockout just ended and teams
are beginning to play, hockey in the Bay Area has been
going strong all winter long. The Stanford hockey
team will wrap up its season this weekend with big
games at home against San Jose State and at Califor
nia in the season finale. Wins against both of those
teams would give Stanford a berth in the National
Club Hockey Association national tournament in Ft.
Collins, Colo., March 1-4.
The hockey team, whose season started in mid-
October, has built a 7-4-2 record so far this season.
Stanford and Cal have established themselves as the
two best club hockey teams on the West Coast, and
both of Stanford's tie games have come against Cal. If
Stanford defeats San Jose State, the winner of the
Stanford vs. Cal game will become the West Coast rep
resentative to the national tournament.
"This game is basically like a playoff game," said
senior Eric Haug, a defenseman as well as president
and one of the captains of the team.
The hockey team has existed at Stanford as a club
sport for almost two decades and
has played under current coach
Ernie Ferrari for more than a
decade. Since hockey is a club
sport, the team recruits mainly
within the admitted class. Howev
er, almost half the players on the
team are graduate students, some
of whom played Division I hockey
as undergraduates. Since club
sports are open to all students,
graduate and undergraduate,
there is a wide range of ages on
the team. One past player, David
Shapiro, played for the Stanford
hockey team for 12 years.
The team participates in no set
conference, and therefore it has
to schedule games independently
to try to prove itself the best on
the West Coast. As a result, the
selection of which squad goes to
nationals is subjective. Usually,
the team tries to schedule games
against teams like Cal, San Jose
State, Arizona, Arizona State,
Oregon, UCLA, and sometimes
Colorado and Colorado State.
However, starting next year,
Stanford will play in the new
Pacific 8 Conference which will
include some of the best teams in
the west.
With a constrained budget, it

is often tough to travel to other
schools for a game and do other
things that a Division I team
would do. While the ASSU pro
vides some funding, the team is
mostly supported by student
dues, money it earns ushering
other Stanford sports games and
ticket sales.
The Cardinal is led in scoring
by senior center Luke Winter,
also a team captain. Winter has
led Stanford in scoring during
each of his four years. The all
undergraduate starting line is
made up of Winter and his two
wings, freshman Eri Crum, who
is also a member of the Stanford
golf team, and Stefan Teitge. The
second line, made up of all gradu
ate students, includes center
Renato Cedolin and wings Sean
Morrison and Shawn Sarbacker.
The defense includes starters
Haug and graduate student Nick
Ulman and backups Dan
Williams, also a graduate stu
dent, and freshman Matt Blythe.
The players have a wide range
of experience, from Haug, who
skated when he was three years
old and grew up with hockey in
Minnesota, to some who have
picked up the sport much more
recently.
"This is a very close team,"
Haug said. "We have all become
good friends." He said that
recently, when one of the team

members got married, the entire
team was there for the wedding.
The team plays its home
games at Ice Oasis in Redwood
City. Tickets cost $3 for students
and $5 for non-students. This
year, the team has drawn
between 150 and 350 people to its
games. "Many of the kids in the
area come to our games because
when the NHL was on strike, we
were the only hockey team play
ing in the area," Haug said.
During the strike, Haug said
that many people called him to
suggest that the hockey team
should become Division I.
Although it would be easier in
terms of funding and drawing
crowds, the change looks implau
sible in the near future according
to Haug. One major obstacle is
that a Division I team needs an
ice rink on campus. While it is
probably not feasible to build an
ice rink at Stanford soon, Haug
believes it may not be a bad idea.
"With hockey becoming big in
the Bay Area, an ice rink would
be popular," Haug said. "You
could open a rink up to the public
and rent the rink out, and it will
pay for itself very quickly."
The San Jose State game is
Friday night at 6:45 p.m. at Ice
Oasis and the Cal game is Satur
day at 10:45 a.m. in Berkeley.
Tickets are still available for both
games.
