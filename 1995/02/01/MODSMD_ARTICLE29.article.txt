# Salzenstein longs for a happy ending
## No. 1 men's singles player on a mission for '95 NCAA title 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
The agony of defeat takes on new
meaning when an athlete comes
within tantalizing reach of his
sport's Promised Land, only to fall
short with the unforgiving spot
light refusing to hide his failure.
Ask John Starks of the New York
Knicks. Or ask junior Jeff Salzen
stein of the Stanford men's tennis
team, last year's runner-up in the
NCAA championships.

'Jeff doesn't feel any
kind of pressure playing
in the No. 1 position.'
— Dick Gould

Salzenstein knows that his team
would never have made it to the
championship round against USC
had it not been for his 24-4 regular
season dual-match record. Salzen
stein knows that his three-set loss
to Jon Leach was not the only Stan
ford loss of the afternoon in South
Bend, Ind. Salzenstein knows that
he played well in that critical loss
at the No. 2-singles position.
But Salzenstein also knows that
he didn't play well enough to win
the only match remaining with the
score tied at three matches apiece,
and he knows that for a few fleeting
moments, the opportunity to win a
national championship for his
entire team rested in his hands —
and his shoelaces.
That once-in-a-lifetiuie opportu
nity was quickly taken from him by
what turned out to be the most
unkind of cuts — a broken shoelace
while trying to hold his serve at 3-3
in the championship-deciding set.
After a short break in the action to
replace the defective lace, Leach
went on to take 10 of the next 11
points from Salzenstein, and with
that, the NCAA championship.
"[The incident] broke the
momentum of the match," Salzen
stein said. "After that, Leach raised
his play to another level."
Salzenstein reacted to the defeat
with tears of disappointment. His
teammates tried to console him as
USC celebrated what many have
labeled the most exciting champi
onship victory in NCAA history.
One teammate, Ricky Becker, told
Salzenstein, "If there was one play
er that we would have wanted to be

on the court in that match, it would
have been you." But in the end,
Salzenstein would recover from the
defeat on his own.
"At the time, I felt like I let the
team down," Salzenstein said. "But
then I realized that my match just
happened to be the last match. We
win as a team and lose as a team."
Once Salzenstein came to an
understanding of what had
occurred, he decided to dedicate his
energies to another shot at the elu
sive national title.
"[The incident] made me want to
work harder over the summer and
fall. I used it to motivate me to win
a national championship," Salzen
stein said.
Elected team captain this year,
Salzenstein is primed to lead the
young but No. 1-ranked Cardinal in
its quest for the NCAA crown.
Although he says the team will find
it "tough to replace the great lead
ership provided by last year's
seniors, who were proven winners,"
he thinks that freshmen No. 2 and
3 players Scott Humphries and
Paul Goldstein will be able to help
the Cardinal with the experience
they've gained from national and
international competition. The two
have already helped Salzenstein.
"I try to give them advice, but I
learn as much from them as they
might learn from me," Salzenstein
said.
To the average fan, however, it
doesn't look as though Salzenstein
has much to learn. From the day he
stepped into the No. 5 position as a
freshman, he exhibited a knack for
using his footwork to almost impec
cably set up for the ball, making
sure that he gets his weight going
forward on every shot.
"He was very well-schooled in
the fundamentals," said Stanford
head coach Dick Gould.
According to Salzenstein, when
he was younger he needed to rely
on "the fundamentals" because his
"relatively small" size meant that
he lacked the power game of the
bigger, stronger players who were
at more advanced stages of their
physical development. Gould
thinks that this also forced Salzen
stein "to learn how to play intelli
gently."
"He's a guy who's had to rely on
his intelligence and guile to win,"
Gould said, adding that, "Jeff has
always played the points well —
you rarely see him play the points

Junior Jeff Salzenstein won't stand to lose another NCAA crown by a
shoestring.
