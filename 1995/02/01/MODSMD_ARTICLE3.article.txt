# Smolen submits study on reforms after year of work
## 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
After more than a year of
studying the ASSU, Cardinal
Consulting formally submit
ted its recommendations for
reorganizing the institution
and alteringthe special-fee sys
tem at last night's senate meet
ing.
The group's founder, third
year law student David Smolen,
briefly addressed the senate on
Cardinal Consulting's history
and purpose.
"We are a student group with
out a legislative agenda," Smolen
said. "Our interest is in seeing
that these proposals are seriously
considered.
"This is not usurping your
power," Smolen said of the
group's 62-page report. "But
rather, we're presenting it to you
for your consideration."
Questions from the Senate did
not venture into the proposal's
specifics as most senators had not
read the report, having only
recently obtained copies.
Smolen said he formed Cardi
nal Consulting more than a year
ago after receiving a $1,500 grant
from the Stanford Alumni Associ
ation. The group's purpose was to
take a comprehensive look at the
ASSU.
Smolen, a former senate chair,
almost did not have a chance to
address the senate. A motion to
table the report passed the sen-

ate, prompting
business school
student Jeremy
Brest, a member
of Cardinal Con
sulting, to leave
the meeting. The
senate quickly
overruled the
motion — pre
sumably pro-

posed originally to cut down on
the length of the senate meeting
— and allowed Smolen to speak.
In other business, three appro
priations bills passed the senate
with relative ease. Winter quarter
budget allocations for the Com
munity Service Board and the
Program Board passed unamend
ed. Only minor changes were
made in Publications Board allo
cations before that bill was
passed.
Finally, the senate extended
the authorization of two ASSU
business projects, Stanford
Design Group and the Tresidder
Recreation Center, for another
week. The charters for those pro
jects would have expired today,
and the extension gives the sen
ate another week to study the
issue. They plan to debate the
question at next Tuesday's senate
meeting.
