A.J. Hinch
The top-ranked Stanford baseball team opened up its 1995 sched
ule with two victories over St. Mary's and junior A.J. Hinch was a
large reason for the positive start. Hinch, possibly the finest collegiate
catcher in the nation, went two for four with two RBIs and a walk in
Monday's 5-4 comeback win over the Gaels. His two-out two-run
triple in the bottom of the ninth pushed the Cardinal over the top. A
pre-season All-American pick, Hinch also showed his defensive
prowess, pouncing on a bunt to preserve Saturday's 6-0 shutout.
