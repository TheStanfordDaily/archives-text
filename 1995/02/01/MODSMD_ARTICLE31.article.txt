# Pacific 10 foes are not chuckling
## Track off to Reno for the Cosby Invitational 
### Matthew Lawrence 
Bill Cosby won't be there, but
the Stanford track team will be.
This Saturday in Reno an
impressive cast of returning veter
ans, coupled with one of the best
recruiting classes in the nation,
will make their season debut at
the Bill Cosby Invitational. The
men's and women's track teams
look to establish themselves as a
force in the Pacific 10 Conference
this year, and there are no laughs

coming from their competition.
In his three years at Stanford,
head coach Vin Lananna has
assembled what could well be the
next running powerhouse on the
West Coast to rival Oregon, Wash
ington and UCLA.
Lananna's talent for recruiting
and developing young athletes is
already evident in the successes of
the men's and women's cross
country teams in the last two
years. Last fall at the NCAA Cham
pionships in Arkansas, both teams
raced to top-10 finishes in the
nation (seventh for the women,
sixth for the men). Perhaps the
greatest proof of Lananna's eye for
talent comes from the Ail-American
status of three young runners: Greg
Jimmerson, a sophomore who fin
ished sixth in the nation at the
NCAAs, and freshmen Kortney
Dunscombe and Sarna Renfro.
"Our young kids have done a
good job. We have a good balance of
returning and young runners,"
Lananna said. "In their first year
the young runners have to deal with
the transition [from high school to
college]. Now we're expecting per
formances and the direction of our
program is more realistic. In
recruiting we don't need to shotgun
our appeal as much. Now we can
rifle our program."
Drawing on his impressive mid
dle and distance recruits, Lananna
will depend on the strength of the
distance runners to pace the team.
While concentrating on the two-sea
son performers in cross country and
track, Lananna has inherited some
veteran sprinters and field athletes
from his predecessor Brooks John
son's recruiting classes.
Though not running this week
end, Rene Rodriguez, a '94 indoor
and outdoor Ail-American with an
indoor best of 47.06 seconds, holds
the school record in the outdoor 400
meters with a time 0f45.85 seconds.
If Rodriguez remains healthy (he
has a temperamental hamstring) he
could go on to broi.k his own school
record and challenge for the NCAA
title in the one-lap 400 meter event.
In addition to Rodriguez, Lanan
na inherited the stand-out high
jumper, sprinter and decathlete
Travis Clark. In only his second
decathlon, Clark captured the Pac
-10 title under the tutelage of multi
event coach Mark Reiff.
On the women's side, the team
looks to the leadership of senior co
captain Christy Boyd, voted Most
Valuable Performer on the 1994
track and field team, and junior co
captain Dena Dey, the top Cardinal
woman in both the 800 and 1500
meters. Boyd leads the women's
team in the 100 and 400 meter hur
dles and will also run legs on the
400 meter and school-record hold
ing 1600 meter relays. Dey, who
also plays on the Stanford women's
soccer team, is just one of many
track and field athletes competing
in more than one sport. Distance
runner Amanda White competes in
three sports: cross country, track
and field and swimming.
On the men's side the addition of
several Cardinal football players,
running back Anthony Bookman,
wide receiver Brian Manning and
defensive backs Jami Webb and
Branyon Davis, should improve the
traditionally weak sprinting that
has plagued the team-oriented
Lananna.
For the women's team Lananna
relies on the depth of his distance
runners and is optimistic for the
women sprinters, hurdlers and
throwers. The Reno meet will
emphasize the shorter distances. "It

will provide us an opportunity to see
how the fall practices and training
went," he said.
"We're excited about going to
Reno," said senior Dan McGinn,
last year's top 800 meter runner
and an All Pac-10 Academic team
selection. "There's a lot of excellent
competition and it's not really a
low-key meet by any means. It's
definitely an opportunity to com
pete against some fine athletes and
teams. It's a time for us to come
together as a unit and run like hell."
Lananna remains relaxed about
the Bill Cosby Invitational, concen
trating instead on the indoor cham
pionship meet. "We'll take first
things first, then we can do our best
at the Mountain Pacific meet [Feb.
18]," he said.
Some of Lananna's best athletes
will leave one week later for Notre
Dame's Alex Wilson Indoor Invita
tional to run on its enlarged 355-
meter track. The times from Notre
Dame count towards the outdoor
NCAA championships, and will also

provide Stanford with a needed pre
view of its national competition.
This Saturday, the Cardinal will
be represented by only 16 men and
16 women in all the running events
from the mile down, and all the field
events. Although the indoor meets
emphasize individual perfor
mances, Lananna believes in track
and field as a team sport.
"There is an individual compo
nent, but it is a mistake to let an
individual emphasis overcome the
team sport," he said. "[ln the past]
people didn't come to see individu
als, people came to see teams... I'm
hoping we can make it a team sport
at Stanford."
This year the Cardinal track
and field teams have a more bal
anced schedule that includes
scored dual meets along with sev
eral invitationals. With this
approach, Lananna hopes to have
his athletes ready to "throw fur
ther, jump higher, and run faster
by the end of April and beginning
of May," he said.

and developing young athletes is
already evident in the successes of
the men's and women's cross
country teams in the last two
years. Last fall at the NCAA Cham
pionships in Arkansas, both teams
raced to top-10 finishes in the
nation (seventh for the women,
sixth for the men). Perhaps the
greatest proof of Lananna's eye for
talent comes from the Ail-American
status of three young runners: Greg
Jimmerson, a sophomore who fin
ished sixth in the nation at the
NCAAs, and freshmen Kortney
Dunscombe and Sarna Renfro.
"Our young kids have done a
good job. We have a good balance of
returning and young runners,"
Lananna said. "In their first year
the young runners have to deal with
the transition [from high school to
college]. Now we're expecting per
formances and the direction of our
program is more realistic. In
recruiting we don't need to shotgun
our appeal as much. Now we can
rifle our program."
Drawing on his impressive mid
dle and distance recruits, Lananna
will depend on the strength of the
distance runners to pace the team.
While concentrating on the two-sea
son performers in cross country and
track, Lananna has inherited some
veteran sprinters and field athletes
from his predecessor Brooks John
son's recruiting classes.
Though not running this week
end, Rene Rodriguez, a '94 indoor
and outdoor Ail-American with an
indoor best of 47.06 seconds, holds
the school record in the outdoor 400
meters with a time 0f45.85 seconds.
If Rodriguez remains healthy (he
has a temperamental hamstring) he
could go on to broi.k his own school
record and challenge for the NCAA
title in the one-lap 400 meter event.
In addition to Rodriguez, Lanan
na inherited the stand-out high
jumper, sprinter and decathlete
Travis Clark. In only his second
decathlon, Clark captured the Pac
-10 title under the tutelage of multi
event coach Mark Reiff.
On the women's side, the team
looks to the leadership of senior co
captain Christy Boyd, voted Most
Valuable Performer on the 1994
track and field team, and junior co
captain Dena Dey, the top Cardinal
woman in both the 800 and 1500
meters. Boyd leads the women's
team in the 100 and 400 meter hur
dles and will also run legs on the
400 meter and school-record hold
ing 1600 meter relays. Dey, who
also plays on the Stanford women's
soccer team, is just one of many
track and field athletes competing
in more than one sport. Distance
runner Amanda White competes in
three sports: cross country, track
and field and swimming.
On the men's side the addition of
several Cardinal football players,
running back Anthony Bookman,
wide receiver Brian Manning and
defensive backs Jami Webb and
Branyon Davis, should improve the
traditionally weak sprinting that
has plagued the team-oriented
Lananna.
For the women's team Lananna
relies on the depth of his distance
runners and is optimistic for the
women sprinters, hurdlers and
throwers. The Reno meet will
emphasize the shorter distances. "It

will provide us an opportunity to see
how the fall practices and training
went," he said.
"We're excited about going to
Reno," said senior Dan McGinn,
last year's top 800 meter runner
and an All Pac-10 Academic team
selection. "There's a lot of excellent
competition and it's not really a
low-key meet by any means. It's
definitely an opportunity to com
pete against some fine athletes and
teams. It's a time for us to come
together as a unit and run like hell."
Lananna remains relaxed about
the Bill Cosby Invitational, concen
trating instead on the indoor cham
pionship meet. "We'll take first
things first, then we can do our best
at the Mountain Pacific meet [Feb.
18]," he said.
Some of Lananna's best athletes
will leave one week later for Notre
Dame's Alex Wilson Indoor Invita
tional to run on its enlarged 355-
meter track. The times from Notre
Dame count towards the outdoor
NCAA championships, and will also

provide Stanford with a needed pre
view of its national competition.
This Saturday, the Cardinal will
be represented by only 16 men and
16 women in all the running events
from the mile down, and all the field
events. Although the indoor meets
emphasize individual perfor
mances, Lananna believes in track
and field as a team sport.
"There is an individual compo
nent, but it is a mistake to let an
individual emphasis overcome the
team sport," he said. "[ln the past]
people didn't come to see individu
als, people came to see teams... I'm
hoping we can make it a team sport
at Stanford."
This year the Cardinal track
and field teams have a more bal
anced schedule that includes
scored dual meets along with sev
eral invitationals. With this
approach, Lananna hopes to have
his athletes ready to "throw fur
ther, jump higher, and run faster
by the end of April and beginning
of May," he said.
