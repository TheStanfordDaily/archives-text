# Youthful softball to scrimmage St. Mary's
## 
### Jason Weintraub 
Stanford softball coach Sandy
Pierce must feel like an advisor in
Donner or Branner. As the Cardi
nal begins its inaugural Pacific 10
Conference campaign with a
scrimmage against St. Mary's on
Thursday, the team will have no
fewer than seven freshmen bat
tling for playing time.
Hoping to improve on a sub
par 1994 season, Stanford will
look to these younger players to
spark the team to victories. Lead
ing the group of new faces is Jes
sica Schulman, a highly-touted
recruit from southern California
whom, according to Pierce, the
Cardinal stole from perennial
softball powerhouse UCLA.
Schulman, a pitcher, played on
the best 18-and-under team in
the nation last year and will be an
exciting addition to the team,
according to Pierce.
Joining Schulman as a first

time Cardinal player is Dawn
Kobata, Stanford's only other
freshman recruit. "The other five
newcomers," Pierce said, "are
walk-ons from various places in
California and around the
nation." With fewer scholarships
at her disposal than coaches of
sports such as football, basketball
and baseball, Pierce must rely on
walk-ons when building a team.
With all this youth, Pierce
acknowledges that 1995 will be a
building year. Although she feels
the team will be "a lot stronger"
than in the past, Pierce under
stands that this will be the first
time at this level for most of her
players. According to Pierce, the
inexperience will present itself
most in the Cardinal's hitting, as
the squad will face some of the
nation's top fireballers when
playing the likes of UCLA and the
Arizona.
