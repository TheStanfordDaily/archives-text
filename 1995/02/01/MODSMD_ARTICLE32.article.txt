# Youthful softball to scrimmage St. Mary's
## 
### Jason Weintraub 
Stanford softball coach Sandy
Pierce must feel like an advisor in
Donner or Branner. As the Cardi
nal begins its inaugural Pacific 10
Conference campaign with a
scrimmage against St. Mary's on
Thursday, the team will have no
fewer than seven freshmen bat
tling for playing time.
Hoping to improve on a sub
par 1994 season, Stanford will
look to these younger players to
spark the team to victories. Lead
ing the group of new faces is Jes
sica Schulman, a highly-touted
recruit from southern California
whom, according to Pierce, the
Cardinal stole from perennial
softball powerhouse UCLA.
Schulman, a pitcher, played on
the best 18-and-under team in
the nation last year and will be an
exciting addition to the team,
according to Pierce.
Joining Schulman as a first

time Cardinal player is Dawn
Kobata, Stanford's only other
freshman recruit. "The other five
newcomers," Pierce said, "are
walk-ons from various places in
California and around the
nation." With fewer scholarships
at her disposal than coaches of
sports such as football, basketball
and baseball, Pierce must rely on
walk-ons when building a team.
With all this youth, Pierce
acknowledges that 1995 will be a
building year. Although she feels
the team will be "a lot stronger"
than in the past, Pierce under
stands that this will be the first
time at this level for most of her
players. According to Pierce, the
inexperience will present itself
most in the Cardinal's hitting, as
the squad will face some of the
nation's top fireballers when
playing the likes of UCLA and the
Arizona.
The Cardinal will have a chance
to test its new talent in a 10-inning
scrimmage at St. Mary's tomorrow.
"St. Mary's is a team we beat last
year," Pierce said, "so we're excited
to play them."
Although the scrimmage will
provide the team with its first com
petitive action of the 1995 season,
the game will not appear on Stan
ford's overall record.
Thursday's double-header has
double appeal to Pierce and the Car
dinal. "We'll get a good look at our
young players," she said, "and it'll
be a rare chance to actually play
after all this rain we've been hav
ing."
On Saturday, the Cardinal offi
cially opens the new season against
Menlo College, a Division 111
school. As with the St. Mary's
scrimmage, Saturday's game will
allow Schulman and her fellow
freshmen to gain some much-need
ed experience. These early games
should prove to be a valuable learn
ing experience for the young Stan
ford team.
Just like Res Ed.
