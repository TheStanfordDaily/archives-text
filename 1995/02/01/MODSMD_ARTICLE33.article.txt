Pride, courage, dedication, and loyalty: the markings of a
true champion, or perhaps, a runner-up.
In a move of sheer fidelity and honor, freshman Michael
Jensen, the loser of a Super Bowl bet, swam the distance of Lake
Lag in his underwear to pledge his undying and incomparable sup
port for his hometown San Diego Chargers.
The enthusiast marched to the edge of the lake decked out
in Charger blue and gold and stated his purpose. "Before I start, I'd
like to make an announcement," said Jensen. "I'm doing this for my
family honor, my family name. We're die hard Charger fans."
Jensen then stripped down to his tighty whities, sprinted
toward the murky water, and dove into the lake. "He was just crazy,
like a man possessed," said Kevin Miller, an observer of the inci
dent.
The freshman finished the swim strong, emerging from the
filth and muck with one last "Go Chargers" as a symbol of his ever
present spirit. Jensen, finally done after a weekend of torture, could
only look to his family for moral support. He promised, while posing
for the Daily, "My mom's gonna eat this up."
