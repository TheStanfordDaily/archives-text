# Moving up the deadline
## Financial aid forms due one month earlier, March 31; next year's packages to be finished by fall quarter 
### Allison Short Staff writer 
In hopes of presenting financial
aid packages to next year's under
graduates by the beginning of au
tumn quarter, the Office of Finan
cial Aid has moved its application
filing date up a month to March 31.
"It gives us more time in the Fi
nancial Aid Office to collect the doc
uments and get the awards out as
early as possible. That's our aim,"
said Asst. Director Cynthia Rice.
In previous years, the applica
tion deadline for all returning un
dergraduates has been April 25.
Though the earlier date could po
tentially cause some problems for
undergraduates, the Office of Fi

nancial Aid has not yet received any
negative responses from students.
"Maybe it hasn't dawned on peo
ple that the deadline is earlier," Rice
said.
However, Rice said she believes
that students shouldn't have a
problem with the earlier date be
cause the application packages
were sent out in December to all
currently enrolled freshmen,
sophomores and juniors.
Incoming freshmen will not be
aifected at all, since their deadline is
already set for a separate, earlier
date so they can have their financial
aid packages by April.
In addition to extending the

financial aid dates:
March 2: Filing date
for Cal grant applica
tions.
March 31: New applica
tion filing date for finan
cial aid for current
Stanford students.
April 25: Former ap

financial aid.
length of processing time with the
earlier deadline, the Office of
Financial Aid is trying to make the
application process more efficient
in other areas as well. According to
Rice, the most important change in
financial aid documentation is that
the office is no longer requiring tax
statements up front.
"We're trying to cut down on
the processing time for us which
means quicker processing for the
students," Rice said.
In addition to the earlier filing
date, the date for the Cal grants —
up to $5,250 in financial aid for
California students based on need
and academics — is March 2.
Currently 62 percent Stanford
undergraduates receive some of the
$40 million in financial aid money
awarded yearly.
