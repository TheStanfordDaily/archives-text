## Police statistics show fewer computers stolen last year 
### Burt Herman Staff writer 
Computer theft at Stanford dropped by more than
one-fourth last year, but according to Stanford Police
even more can be done to prevent such crimes.
The number of reported cases of stolen computers in
1994 went down to 31 — a decrease from 42 in the pre
vious year — according to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. The total estimated value of the stolen goods
dropped from $108,513 in 1993 to $73,696 last year.
Police were able to recover $6,892 of last year's
stolen computers, but were unable to solve any of the

cases the previous year, he said.
An overwhelming majority of the stolen computers
are from departments on campus and are not students'
computers, Niemeyer said. "We don't have very many
disappearing out of dorms," he said.
While the numbers look encouraging, Niemeyer was
quick to add that more can be done to stop the thefts.
"There's a lot of computers that are disappearing be
fore they are even set up," he said. New computers left
in insecure places contribute to easy thefts, he said.
Already, there have been three reported cases of
computer theft this year. A com
puter was stolen from Littlefield
Center out of an employee s cubi
cle just last week, Niemeyer said.
The computer was not secure and
the suspect is still at large.
A former Stanford temporary
employee is the suspect in two ear
lier cases of computer theft.
Anthony H. Moore is being sought
in connection with the theft of
$21,763 in computer equipment
that police later recovered,
Niemeyer said.
Security devices used to lock
down computers seem to be work
ing, Niemeyer said, but he added
that "there's still so many comput
ers that aren't secure" because of
the "open environment" that many
people feel exists at Stanford.
Another factor contributing to
the theft problem is the fact that
serial numbers of computers are
often not recorded, preventing
police from entering the number
into a national crime database,
Niemeyer said.
This facilitates quick recovery if
the equipment is found by other
law enforcement agencies any
where in the country.
"We continue to hope that we'll
keep on the downward trend,"
Niemeyer said.
