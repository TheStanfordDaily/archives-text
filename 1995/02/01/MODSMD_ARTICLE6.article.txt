A Cornell University psychology
professor who once taught at Stan
ford as a visiting professor has been
accused of sexual harassment.
An ethics committee at the New
York school has recommended
sanctions against Prof. James B.
Maas as a result of charges by four
female Cornell students.
Maas visited Stanford for one
quarter during the 1978-79 acade
mic year, teaching introductory
psychology and working on a film

about hypnosis with Stanford Prof.
Ernest Hilgard.
Hilgard said he was not aware of
the accusations and was surprised

indications of problems of that sort
while he was here," Hilgard said.
"There was no indication of a char

Four women who worked for
Maas in New York as teaching as
sistants, nannies and members of
his film crew charged the professor
with harassment, taking their com
plaints to the Professional Ethics
Committee of the College of Arts

and Sciences at Cornell.
The Cornell Daily Sun reported
last week that this committee ruled
unanimously that Maas "repeated

appropriately in his relationship"
with the students.
Possible sanctions against Maas
include prohibitions from taking on
female advisees, hiring a student
enrolled in his classes as a nanny or
family helper, traveling alone with
an undergraduate and giving stu
dents presents worth more than
