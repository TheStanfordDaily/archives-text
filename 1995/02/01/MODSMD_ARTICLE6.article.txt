# Former prof accused of harassment
## Psychology scholar taught a quarter at Stanford in 1970s 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
A Cornell University psychology
professor who once taught at Stan
ford as a visiting professor has been
accused of sexual harassment.
An ethics committee at the New
York school has recommended
sanctions against Prof. James B.
Maas as a result of charges by four
female Cornell students.
Maas visited Stanford for one
quarter during the 1978-79 acade
mic year, teaching introductory
psychology and working on a film

about hypnosis with Stanford Prof.
Ernest Hilgard.
Hilgard said he was not aware of
the accusations and was surprised
by them. "There certainly were no
indications of problems of that sort
while he was here," Hilgard said.
"There was no indication of a char
acter defect on his part."
Four women who worked for
Maas in New York as teaching as
sistants, nannies and members of
his film crew charged the professor
with harassment, taking their com
plaints to the Professional Ethics
Committee of the College of Arts

and Sciences at Cornell.
The Cornell Daily Sun reported
last week that this committee ruled
unanimously that Maas "repeated
ly behaved unprofessionally and in
appropriately in his relationship"
with the students.
Possible sanctions against Maas
include prohibitions from taking on
female advisees, hiring a student
enrolled in his classes as a nanny or
family helper, traveling alone with
an undergraduate and giving stu
dents presents worth more than
$15.
Maas has spent 32 years at
Cornell as assistant dean of stu
dents, psychology lecturer, chair
of the psychology department,
student-assisted filmmaker and
professor of Psychology 101.
His "Introduction to Psycholo
gy" class at Cornell is the largest
in the country, often counting
enrollments of 2,000 students,
said Phil Zimbardo, a psychology
professor at Stanford.
Despite the class size, Maas
was a popular and personable
professor, said Zimbardo, who
invited Maas for his quarter of
teaching at Stanford.
"I invited him to teach here
because he was one of the great
teachers of introductory psych in
the country," said Zimbardo.
While visiting Stanford, Maas
"got a high-rating," he said. "The
students uniformly liked him."
Zimbardo completed the

exchange by guest lecturing for
two of Maas' classes. "There, too,
students had a great personal
affection for him, not only in class
but out of class," he said.
"There was a very positive
relationship that he had with
both male and female students,"
Zimbardo said, adding that he
spoke with some of Maas' female
TAs at Cornell and they had "no
complaints."
Concentrating on sleep in his
psychology research, Maas has
also made several films. Along
with the film made at Stanford,
which Hilgard said made "hypno
sis more scientifically
respectable," he has covered top
ics such as drunk driving and
sleep.
"I was perfectly comfortable
working with him," Hilgard
remembered. "There are no nega
tives I can think of at all."
The ethics committee's report
has been forwarded to the dean of
the College of Arts and Sciences,
who will make his own recom
mendation and send it on to Cor
nell's provost.
