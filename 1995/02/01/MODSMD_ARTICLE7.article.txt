# Stanford Observer may get makeover, shift to quarterly
## 
### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
In an effort to make itself "more attractive," the
Stanford Observer alumni newspaper may be undergo
ing a facelift.
If approved by the Board of Trustees at its Monday
meeting, the Observer would resemble the Sunday
New York Times Magazine, a dramatic change from its
current tabloid newspaper format, according to News
Service Director Doug Foster.
Foster faces stiff opposition from Bob Beyers, one of
the Observer's original founders. According to Beyers,
who also served as the director of News Service from

1961 to 1990, changing the Observer would cause a
number of problems.
Higher costs, a smaller number of news stories and
conflicting interests with Stanford Magazine, another
alumni publication, are reasons enough to not change
the Observer, Beyers said.
Foster, however, feels that Beyers' lack of confi
dence in the new format is unfounded and the result of
a "misunderstanding" of the changes.
Current Observer Editor Theresa Johnston de
clined comment on the changes.
According to Foster, who hopes that the changes will
come as early as possible, the
new layout will "be more attrac
tive and showcase feature ideas."
In addition, Foster said, the
Observer will continue to "main
tain its commitment to report
the news fully."
But Beyers said he "doesn't
see how a quarterly magazine
can cover the same amount of
news." Instead of adopting the
new format, Beyers said, the
Observer should come out more
often, as it did in the past, pub
lishing nine issues per year as
compared to the current four to
six issues.
Noting that the new Observer
would probably include more fea
ture stories, Foster explained the
number of pages would also
increase so news would not be

sacrificed.
He said it will be up to the
University to decide whether to
pay for the added cost of the
extra pages as well the addition
of a freelance budget.
For Beyers, those extra costs
are another reason not to pro
ceed with the change. The cur
rent format of the Observer, Bey
ers said, "gives the most bang for
the buck."
Changing to a magazine for
mat, Beyers said, not only raises
the unit cost but will cause con
fusion among alumni because it
will resemble Stanford Maga
zine. In the past, the Observer
and Magazine have come out at
the same time.
Stanford Magazine, Foster
said, will continue to "major in
alumni affairs, minor in campus
news," whereas the new Observ
er would "major in campus devel
opments, and minor in alumni
affairs."

The two Stanford publica
tions would also be sent out to
alumni on different dates.
According to Foster, the Observ
er has "a determination not to
compete" but rather to provide
"a regular diet of Stanford news
at a pace I alumni) can absorb
it."
According to Beyers, there
have already been conflicts. Both
the Observer and Stanford Maga
zine had planned on doing the
same interview with Supreme
Court Justice Stephen Breyer, a
Stanford alumnus. That would
not have "been very smooth,"
Beyers said.
Both men, however, feel that
the Observer is a valuable source
of news to alumni. In a 1994
Office of Development Survey,
three out of four alumni felt the
Observer did a good job of help
ing them understand the univer
sity's position on important
issues.
