# Study dispels myths about breasts
## 
### Soumya V. Raman Contributing writer 
Glance through the pages of Cosmopolitan or the
swimsuit edition of Sports Illustrated and it's easy
to conclude that the taut, round breasts perched
high on the model's chest are the ideal shape.
But Dr. Loren Eskenazi — a plastic surgeon at
Stanford Hospital — wants to dispel the myth of
"the grapefruit breast" by creating the first data
base of what normal breasts look like.
Over the past few months, Eskenazi has scanned
the breasts of more than 500 women in order to cre
ate a database of the natural contours and measure
ments of women's breasts. This information will be

used to change the shape of implants and make bet
ter-fitting brassieres a reality.
"Most people don't know what real breasts are,"
Eskenazi said. "They believe that the big, high,
round, firm, pointed breasts found in all kinds of
fashion magazines, advertisements and catalogs
[represent] the 'ideal' shape."
"This is unique to America," she added. Maga
zines advertisements in European countries like
France and Sweden feature natural breasts that are
mature, droopy and smaller, she said.
Eskenazi explained that normal breasts are
shaped like a teardrop, flatter on top and droopy

In an effort to dispel myths about the perfect female figure, Dr. Loren Eskenazi uses computer Imag
ing to assist in her creation of a database about "normal" breast sizes and shapes.
below.
"It is very rare for a thin and
muscular woman to have big
boobs," Eskenazi said. She points
to a picture of a model in an antacid
advertisement. The model displays
a half-moon shaped cleavage.
"Women suffer from this inac
curate portrayal and go in for
breast augmentation because they
don't look like everyone else," she
said. Most women come and say 'I
want to be a 368,' thinking that it
is the perfect shape."
Women of different races have
varied breast structures depending
on genes and diet, Eskenazi said.
With this new database — a

$200,000 project sponsored by
Lipomatrix, a breast implant man
ufacturer — she hopes to get a
range of normal breast anatomy
over a large variety of shapes and
structures.
Creation of the database began
a few months ago when Eskenazi
advertised for volunteers. The
advertisement began this way:
"Tired of looking at grapefruit
breasts?"
Intrigued by this question many
women responded to the advertise
ment.
Some women make the trip to
Eskenazi's lab motivated by abso
lute disgust with the grapefruit
"ideal" promoted by the media.
Other women hope to help breast
cancer victims to get better shaped
implants.
Patricia Morris, a registered

nurse who has seen many mastec
tomies and reconstructive surg
eries, said she feels prosthesis
could be more natural.
"[l] tend to go to nude beaches
and it is unnatural not to see a
drooping, round breast," Morris
said.
Doctoral student Elisabeth
Browne, who volunteered after
reading the advertisement, said
she felt the media and advertisers
assume that women do or should
have a shape that doesn't look nat
ural to her. Browne said she hopes
the availability of this database will
change that.
Other volunteers are really
hopeful that this data will result in
bras that fit.
"I could not find a bra to fit to
save my life, after my delivery,"
said a volunteer who did not wish

to be identified.
"Why shouldn't [women] have
four or five bras that really work
for them?" Eskenazi said, hoping
to be the one to come up with the
answer.
Eskenazi wants to use this data
to help lingerie manufacturers cre
ate better bras that feel natural
and fit well. She plans to use the
data about the base diameter of the
breast and the height on the chest
wall where it sits to add another
dimension to the bra.
The actual breast scan takes
less than 30 seconds. A beam of
low-intensity infra-red light reads
the gradations of the breast, as it
moves around the volunteer in a
semicircle. It maps the size, protru
sion and droop of the breast.
Eventually, this data will also be
used to manufacture natural

shaped implants.
But some doctors don't see the
need.
"The best result isn't really mim
icking the natural breast," said Dr.
Donald Laub, a plastic surgeon in
Palo Alto. "I don't stop at the natu
ral breast. I go beyond that to make
things better, better than normal."
He said women wanting breast
reconstruction and augmentation
desire shapes that aren't always
natural. They desire a younger
breast, he said. However, Eskenazi
countered that "only one out of
every 25 of my patients want a
shape that isn't natural."
Laub said he is not affected by
America's obsession with the
grapefruit breast. He is not out to
change society, he said. "My job is
to make the patient happy."
Dr. Terry Knapp, plastic sur

geon and chief executive officer of
Lipomatrix, hopes that one day
women who desire reconstruction
will get customized implants
resembling their natural breasts.
She said implants will be molded to
fit each woman just like a pair of
custom-fit jeans.
However, Knapp added that it
will be five years before customized
implants can be produced. Cur
rently, doctors cannot prevent
implants from tightening and con
densing in volume because of the
formation of scar tissue. Scar tis
sue tightens around the implant
resulting in a noticeably spherical
shape, Knapp said.
The database will help deter
mine what shapes are possible,
Knapp said. "Unless scar control is
possible we cannot rely on the nat
ural shape being retained."
