# Study dispels myths about breasts
## 
### Soumya V. Raman Contributing writer 
Glance through the pages of Cosmopolitan or the
swimsuit edition of Sports Illustrated and it's easy
to conclude that the taut, round breasts perched
high on the model's chest are the ideal shape.
But Dr. Loren Eskenazi — a plastic surgeon at
Stanford Hospital — wants to dispel the myth of
"the grapefruit breast" by creating the first data
base of what normal breasts look like.
Over the past few months, Eskenazi has scanned
the breasts of more than 500 women in order to cre
ate a database of the natural contours and measure
ments of women's breasts. This information will be

used to change the shape of implants and make bet
ter-fitting brassieres a reality.
"Most people don't know what real breasts are,"
Eskenazi said. "They believe that the big, high,
round, firm, pointed breasts found in all kinds of
fashion magazines, advertisements and catalogs
[represent] the 'ideal' shape."
"This is unique to America," she added. Maga
zines advertisements in European countries like
France and Sweden feature natural breasts that are
mature, droopy and smaller, she said.
Eskenazi explained that normal breasts are
shaped like a teardrop, flatter on top and droopy
