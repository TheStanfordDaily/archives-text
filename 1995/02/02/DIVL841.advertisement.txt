ATTENTION JUNIORS!
WOULD YOU LIKE $15,000 FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF
GRADUATE SCHOOL PLUS $2000 TO ASSIST YOU DURING
THE APPLICATION PROCESS NEXT YEAR?!
IF THE ANSWER IS YES, READ BELOW:
The Beinecke Memorial Scholarship Program offers scholarships to juniors
who have demonstrated unusual ability in fields of study they are eager to
pursue at the graduate level. The award consists of an initial grant of $2,000
to be used at the student's discretion in support of the graduate school
application process; followed by a $15,000 stipend during each
of the first two years of graduate study.
Nominees should represent superior standards of intellectual ability,
scholastic achievement and personal promise. In addition,
preference will be given to those candidates:
1) for whom the awarding of a Beinecke Scholarship would significantly
enhance the likelihood of the student attending graduate school;
2) who are planning to attend graduate school in the arts, humanities and
behavioral or natural sciences;
3) with demonstrated financial need (i.e., a history of receiving financial aid)
