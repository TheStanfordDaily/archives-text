# Another Stanford milestone
## Alum is first woman to pilot space mission 
### September Trevi√±o Staff writer 
As the space shuttle Discovery blasts off tomor
row, Stanford alumna Eileen M. Collins will make
history as the first woman to pilot a NASA space mis
sion.
Lt. Col. Collins, a 1986 graduate in operations re
search, will be second in command of the shuttle,
which is scheduled to come within 35 feet of the Russ
ian space station Mir in preparation for the first real
docking in June.
"Ten years ago, her commanding officer in the Air
Force thought she was destined to do what she'll do
tonight," said Operations Research Prof. Don Igle
hart, who was Collins' faculty adviser.
Iglehart was also on the admissions committee the
year Collins applied. After reading her commanding
officer's shining recommendation and reviewing her
application, he advised admitting her, indicating that
she could be the next Sally Ride.
"She is quite a remarkable person," he said.
While she attended Air Force Test Pilot School at
Edwards Air Force Base in 1990, NASA selected her
to enroll in its astronaut program. She became an as
tronaut in July 1991 and was assigned to a support
team responsible for Orbiter prelaunch checkout,
final launch configuration and spacecraft communi
cation.
Collins, 39, has logged more than 4,000 hours in 30
different types of aircrafts. She was a T-38 flight in
structor at Oklahoma's Vance Air Force Base from
1979 to 1982. She was then stationed at Travis Air
Force Base where she became a C-141 air craft com
mander and instructor pilot.
She was awarded the Air Force Commendation
and Meritorious Service Medals and the Armed
Forces Expeditionary Medal for
service in Grenada.
Collins was raised in Elmira,
N.Y. She graduated from Syracuse
University in 1978 with degrees in
mathematics and economics.
After receiving her master's in
operations research from Stanford,
she went to Webster University in
1989 to pursue another degree in
space systems management.
Other women graduates from
Stanford who have made space
exploration history include Sally
Ride, America's first woman
astronaut; Mae Jemison, the first
African-American woman astro
naut; and Ellen Ochoa, the first
Hispanic woman astronaut.
The space shuttle Discovery is
set to take off from Kennedy
Space Center tomorrow.
