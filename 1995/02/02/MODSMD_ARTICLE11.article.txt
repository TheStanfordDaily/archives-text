## Floods continue to ravage Europe 
### 
TIEL, Netherlands (AP) —
Soldiers slung sandbags and
tried to battle Mother Nature as
flooded rivers, yesterday, made
water refugees of almost
250,000 people, the biggest exo
dus in Dutch history.
Despite the efforts, one dike
was breached and water poured
into the town of Ochten.
Soldiers were pressed into
duty yesterday to reinforce dikes
weakened by the rampaging
Maas and Waal rivers, which
have been bearing the brunt of
Western Europe's recent flood
ing and snow meltoff.
Although water levels in this
low-lying province were drop
ping by nightfall, the rising river
waters spread northward, forc
ing Kampen, a town of 40,000, to
build a second emergency dike.
Kampen lies along the Ijsel
River, just south of the vast
inland lake known as the
Ijselmeer.
Evacuees clogged highways
with traffic jams several miles
long in their rush to high
ground with only what they
could carry in their cars and
trucks. Livestock shared space
with washing machines as resi
dents of Gelderland and Lim

burg provinces packed up their
lives.
Some people refused to bow to
evacuation orders, which if vio
lated include fines and jail.
Riot police were sent into the
eastern section of the Waal city
of Gorinchem to forcibly evacu
ate the remaining 4,000 resi
dents.
"I'm absolutely not going to
leave," said Paul Gremmen, who
owns a furniture factory in the
Waal town of Wamel. "If the
water breaks through, I have to
save the expensive computer
controlled machinery."
Queen Beatrix, 57, splashed
through puddles in her green
rubber boots to chat with evac
uees and comfort those about to
leave their homes.
The flood waters that contin
ued to decline in the rest of
northwestern Europe regained
their fury as they poured into
the southeastern Dutch low
lands guarded by 300 miles of
dikes.
The Finance Ministry put the
price tag for a "worst-case sce
nario" of dikes bursting at up to
$46 billion.
A second Ducth fatality was
reported yesterday, a 62-year

old woman who fell into the
Waal a day earlier with her sis
ter while walking their dog along
a dike in Winssen. Her 52-year
old sister died Tuesday.
That brought the official
death toll from the European
floods to 29, including 16 in
France, four in Germany, five in
Belgium, one in Luxembourg
and one in Austria.
The flooding was the worst
natural disaster to hit the Dutch
since 1953 when a North Sea
storm surge washed away 1,800
people in the southwestern
province of Zeeland.
But in terms of refugees, the
current crisis surpasses even the
World War II battle of Arnhem
in 1944, which forced 180,000
people from their homes.
The evacuations have turned
vast tracts of village and farm
land into ghostly landscapes
devoid of people or any move
ment but the ripple of water.
At risk are not only the homes
and livelihoods of hundreds of
thousands, but centuries of
labor to turn the marsh and
floodplain into what are known
as polders by building dikes. The
dikes now threatened date to the
Middle Ages.
