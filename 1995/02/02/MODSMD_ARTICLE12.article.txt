# Testimony on Simpson's dream
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” O.J. Simpson
said after his ex-wife's slaying that he had
had dreams of killing her, a friend testified
yesterday. But the witness said he didn't
tell police earlier because he "didn't want to
go down as the person who nailed 0.J."
"I loved this man for 26 years," Ronald
Shipp, a former police officer, told jurors
during a day of taut courtroom drama. "All
of a sudden my thought processes .. . like I
say, I wanted nothing to do with it."
Prosecutors won permission from Supe
rior Court Judge Lance Ito to question
Shipp about the exchange despite strong
objections from defense attorney Carl Dou
glas, who insisted the conversation never
took place.
Legal experts were divided over whether

the judge had given the defense powerful
grounds for appeal in allowing the dream
testimony. And psychologists warned that
dreams aren't actions and are beyond the
control of the dreamer.
In blistering cross-examination, during
which the defense tried to portray Shipp as
a lying hanger-on trying to get attention,
the witness admitted that he was more like
"a servant" to Simpson than a confidant
and that he once had a drinking problem.
But he never wavered from his claim
that Simpson told him about having
dreams of killing Nicole Brown Simpson.
"I'm doing this for my conscience and
my peace of mind," Shipp said. "I will not
have the blood of Nicole on Ron Shipp. I
can sleep at night, unlike a lot of others."
