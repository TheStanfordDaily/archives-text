New ice cream CEO
WATERBURY, Vt. (AP) - He scooped
the competition with help from a lid of
Chunky Mandarin Orange, a poem
touching on the civil rights movement
and some Fortune 100 expertise.
Robert Holland Jr., a self-described
ice-cream "grazer," was appointed yes
terday as president and chief executive
officer of Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc.
In a company contest dubbed "Yo, I
Want To Be CEO," he beat out some
22,000 others who wrote assays on why
they should be chosen to take over from

company co-founder Ben Cohen, who is
stepping aside from day-to-day manage
ment.
But while the search began with a
gimmick, it ended in a more traditional
fashion. Holland, 54, a Fortune 100
business consultant, was selected with
the help of an executive search firm.
Cubans returned
GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba (AP) - A
dejected group of Cuban refugees
returned under heavy guard yesterday
to the American naval base at Guan

tanamo Bay, reluctant prisoners of a for
eign power on the same island they
risked their lives to flee.
"We see ourselves as political
pawns," said 33-year-old Alberto Lujar
do after getting off the plane that
brought him from Panama. "We have
been betrayed by the United States and
by the communist government from
which we fled."
A couple of hours earlier, the U.S.
military had tried to create a festive
atmosphere for the Cubans being forced
aboard the chartered Boeing 727 by sol
diers armed with wooden batons.
