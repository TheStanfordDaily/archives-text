The Chaparral should
give part of its space
to other publications

IT IS PERHAPS their most
inspired and entertaining
joke in recent memory.
Regardless, the Stanford Cha
parral's claim to a historical
property right in the Storke
Publications Building has
entered the realm of absurdity.
The Storke Publications
Building has been home to the
Chaparral since its construction
in 1963. At the time, the build
ing housed just four student
publications, meaning there was
ample space to keep all parties
content.
However, the number of stu
dent publications on campus has
subsequently blossomed, and
the Chaparral has been hesitant
to recognize this fact. Currently,
there are 20 publications being
run out of one room on the sec
ond floor of the Storke Building,
while the Chaparral enjoys the
luxury of four rooms to itself.
The ASSU Senate passed a bill
last Nov. 21 which would reallo
cate Publications Board space
and create a slightly more equi
table arrangement. After a
tumultuous reception from Cha
parral members, however, it was
not enacted fall quarter.
On Jan. 24, the bill was to be
reconsidered by the senate, but
the Budget and Finance Com
mittee voted instead to form a
special 12-member committee to
study the issue further.
At a school where there seem
to be more committees than stu
dents, this decision did not come
as a surprise. However, a simple
solution is still attainable. In a
long-awaited gesture of goodwill,
the Stanford Chaparral should
voluntarily relinquish two of its
four Pub Board rooms.

Members of the Chaparral
oppose this solution because
they believe they have an histor
ical right to their current rooms.
The Chaparral contributed to a
portion of the funding used to
construct the Storke Building
back in 1963, and current mem
bers have used this fact to justi
fy their privileged position.
It is clear, however, that the
Chaparral has taken its distinct
ly Lockean notion of property
too far. The vast majority of
Stanford's current publications
were not even in existence when
the Chaparral helped fund the
Storke Building; therefore, it is
ludicrous to claim that their
interests should defer to the
Chaparral's. Practicality and
fairness to the 20 other existing
publications should take prece
dence over the Chaparral's so
called historical property right.
It is also important to note
that the Chaparral is only pub
lished twice a quarter. The cur
rent space allocation is especial
ly inappropriate considering
that publications such as the
Stanford Review — published on
a weekly basis — must compete
everyday for limited space with
the 19 other publications.
Furthermore, according to
Pub Board Director Danny
Bressler, the actual publication
of the Chaparral is carried out in
the common room alongside the
other groups. Therefore, their
four additional rooms are used
for whatever Chaparral mem
bers do on a day-to-day basis; in
other words, very little.
The Chaparral is an impor
tant part of campus life, and
undoubtedly deserves adequate
space to keep its publication
healthy and humorous. Given
their somewhat unambitious
publication schedule, however,
Chaparral members should yield
to the more pressing needs of
their 20 neighbors and restore
some measure of equality among
users of the Storke Building.
