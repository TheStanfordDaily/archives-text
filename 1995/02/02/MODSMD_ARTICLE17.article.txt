Perhaps space goats are responsible for \young earth 9

1 WOULD LIKE to respond to Vlad
Beffa's Feb. 1 letter about a "young
earth" theory. I too share his con
cerns about scientific dogma and the
failure of modern science to explain the
lack of dust on the lunar surface. How
ever, I do not see the missing dust as
evidence for a young earth and an
almighty creator. Rather, my studies
have convinced me that the dust was

stolen (maybe even eaten!) by a race of
interstellar space goats for purposes
unknown to humankind.
I think it is tragic that scientists,
researchers and students of science will
not seriously consider this possibility,
when so much evidence leans towards
it. Let me give just one example. Very
often, the so-called "craters" on the
moon have a small peak in the middle.

Scientists have been unable to explain
this phenomenon satisfactorily, even
though the evidence points directly to
one startling conclusion â€” the
"craters" are actually hoofprints of
space goats!
Consider this statement regarding
space goats: "What happens when a herd
of dust-eating goats, each the size of a
small asteroid, encounters a tasty dust

covered moon?" I believe we as scientists
need to keep asking ourselves such ques
tions until we drive ourselves completely
loony. Otherwise, we might actually
approach something resembling reality,
and that wouldn't be any fun, would it?
(With apologies to Douglas Adams for
stealing the space goat idea.)
