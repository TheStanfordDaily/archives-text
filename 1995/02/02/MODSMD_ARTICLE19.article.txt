## Everything I should've said 
### 
IT STARTED WITH an invitation for
a second date. "Wanna do something
tonight?" I asked hopefully.
"Tonight?" she answered, "I'd love to,
but wait ... if we go it would be just as
friends, right?"
I'd done nothing wrong, mind you. No
picking my nose at II Fornaio on the first
date or anything. But now she wanted it
dead before it breathed and I had to do
something.
Now at instants like these, the words
selected by our egos become decisions
without our minds' consent. At these
shattered fragments of moment, subcon
scious flurries become, to some extent,
our lives. Tweak a phrase this way
instead of that, and the future picks its
colors. Usually this is where we blow it.
In my own pretty little world it goes
differently. There, my brain has a chance
to speak and salvage situations intent on
self-destruction and everything goes
right.
Here's how it should've gone:
". . . . it would be just as friends,
right?" she stabs.
"I certainly hope not," I parry.
"Because if we go as friends I won't get to
kiss you the whole night."
"Excuse me?"
"Hey, is this the part where you give
me a speech about really wanting to be
my friend or something?"
"I take it you've done this before."
"More times than you'd care to
count."
"Then you know the drill, right?"
"Lemme guess, you like spending time
with me."
"I do."
"And if you get your way, you go ahead
and continue with a silly attempt to over
simplify your life and / don't get to
smooch you any time soon."

"Hey, you're good at this."
"Thank you. I've got a question: Why
push me off like this? I didn't even pick
my nose."
"I'm not pushing you off — I do want
to hang on to you. But just as friends.
Can't we do that?"
"No, I'm not sure we could."
"What? You're not allowed to say that!
It's against the Let-Down-Easy response
rules. Let me check the Handbook."
"There's a Handbook? I knew it! Look,
I have plenty of friends. That doesn't
mean I'm by any means done making
them, but to be honest, I'd rather not set
tle you into that kind of role."
"But I still want to spend time with
you."
"So what you're saying is that you like
me, but you don't like-me like-me."
"That's not it. I guess I'm worried
about confusing things."
"And I'm worried about keeping
things too simple. So am I supposed to try
to change your mind on this, or should
we leave it alone?"
"I'm not sure."
"Well then let's think — would it be
that bad if we did kiss?"
"Again with the kissing?"
But this last one she says with just
enough flavor of flirt to sound like a hint.
I take the chance and lean in. When our
lips meet it is without resistance — they
take a moment to mesh right, but when it
comes together she and I are lost in the
undulating contours of two mouths
learning. The corners of the smile that
made me trip on my rollerblades test the
shape of my own.
"Oh," she says languidly when we pull
apart. "That was nice."
"Thank you. You should see what I
could do to your neck."
"I'm sure, but not right now. I need to

think straight."
"Think straight? Bad idea."
"Sony?"
"Well, let's be a little Buddhist about
this. Reason and rationale are excellent
tools — they bring us all the way to the
gates of that which we desire, but they
can never take us through. When it
comes down to the wire of higher emotive
potentialities, Reason is a primal pain in
the ass. Here, I'll show you."
And so I go for the neck, not too deli
cately working the line from behind the
ear to collar bone. Somewhere in between
she sighs. "This is almost making sense,"
she says when I sit back in my chair.
"Still not sure? What's wrong?"
"Check the date. We're well into win
ter here — I mean, in four months it's
summer and then, who knows?"
"Four months? Imagine what could
happen in four months — in four weeks!
Think of what we could do to each other
in four hours?"
She rubs the new pink spot on her
neck and smirks. "Hmm. I see your
point."
And then she leans over and kisses me.
From there we embark on a classic reaf
firmative college relationship where she
knows which is the lumpy side of my
futon and her roommate hates me.
That is, that's what shoulda-coulda
have happened.
Incidentally, here's how it really went:
. it would be just as friends,
right?" she asked.
"Oh yeah. I mean, of course," I said
and then added "right," for effect.
"Okay great, then just give me a sec —
I have to go pee."
