# Environmentalist pushes new energy sources
## Efficiency is key element, Flavin says 
### Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing writer 
Citing environmental concerns
and the need for increased effi
ciency, Christopher Flavin — a
noted researcher on energy and
technology policy — spoke about
the coming energy revolution to a
group of 80 people in the History
Corner last night.
Flavin said he believes that
there's potential for radical
change in the world's energy sys
tem. "It's not laissez-faire opti
mism. But if technology and poli
cy reform continues, there's a
potential for a rapid energy revo
lution."
Flavin is vice president of
research at Worldwatch Institute,
a nonprofit environmental orga
nization in Washington, D.C.,
that focuses on energy resource,
technology and policy issues. He
is active in energy debates, nucle
ar power, climate change and the
development of new energy
sources.
The future energy revolution,
according to Flavin, is driven by
environmental concerns, deplet

ing energy sources and peoples'
desire to live in "versatile areas,"
such as rural towns that lack easy
access to energy supplies.
He added that a new energy
source has been further necessi
tated by the recent flooding in
Northern Europe and areas of
California, which indicate that
the polluted atmosphere is
already changing the climate in
those areas.
A key element in the new ener
gy system that Flavin spoke of is
energy efficiency.
"If we introduce new energy
that costs more, then we need an
energy system that is more effi
cient so we can use less," he said.
He also discussed the need to
switch to alternate energy carri
ers, such as natural gas, as well as
the potential for new renewable
energy sources like solar and
wind power.
"As we develop larger and larg
er markets, wind and solar power
will reduce in cost," Flavin said.
Flavin ended his speech by
stressing that he can't predict
when and how things might
unfold. "It's easier to invent the

future than predict it,"he said.
Jane Woodward, a consulting
professor in the Department of
Petroleum Engineering, said she
wholeheartedly agreed with
Flavin's thoughts.
She noted after the speech that
Flavin believes new energy
sources will arise like the laptop
computer once did — completely
out of nowhere and a wonderful
thing to have.

Flavin's speech was part of the
A.J. & Ruth T. Horn Lectureship
The fund was established in
honor of A.J. Horn, who taught
Petroleum Engineering at Stan
ford University for 14 years. Each
year, the lecture fund provides a
platform for a wide range of ener
gy topics relating to current and
potential energy resources, such
as oil, gas, coal, solar and wind
power.
