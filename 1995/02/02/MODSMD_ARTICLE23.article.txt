## Men's basketball to host No. 22 Oregon 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Things around the University of
Oregon are a little different this year.
The quacks heard around campus are
no longer cries of futility, but instead
serendipity. Eugene has turned into a
modern-day Garden of Eden, a par
adise lost and now found for Duckama
niacs far and wide. The football team
achieved its first Rose Bowl berth since
1958, and now the 22nd-ranked men's
basketball team is primed to advance
to its first NCAA Tournament since
1960.
The Ducks are living out a dream
season, but tonight at Maples Pavilion,
they'll receive a wake-up call from the
Cardinal men's basketball team. Both
Stanford (13-3 overall, 4-3 in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference) and Oregon (12-4, 4-
3 Pac-10) are tied for fourth and vying
to move up in the heavily muddled Pac
-10 standings, where the difference
between first and sixth is just one and
a half games.
"They're legit," said Cardinal head
coach Mike Montgomery. "They've had
some good wins, and they're hanging
with a lot of people in the conference.
As evidenced by them being [ranked],
people are excited about them. It's
going to be a big ball game. We need to
do our job at home, and certainly, if
they can come in and get a quality road
win, that would be a big step for them."
The Ducks are second in the confer
ence in scoring offense and first in
three-point shooting percentage at 42.
With a veteran squad that is anything
but green behind the ears, Oregon
head coach Jerry Green, a top assistant
under Roy William at Kansas, utilizes a
Tar Heel/Jayhawk-type system that
has paid dividends this season.
Four of Oregon's starters, and seven
of its top 10 players are seniors. The
Ducks' greatest triumph this season
was a victory in their conference-open
er against then second-ranked UCLA.
But since then, they have gone 3-3,

dropping three out of their last four
contests.
"Oregon is a veteran team," Mont
gomery said. "They do a very good job
of running a system that coach Green
has brought in that is a proven system
being that he came from Kansas. Their
kids believe in it, and they're doing it
very well."
No doubt the strength of Green's
Gang, not to be confused with the foot
ball team's Gang Green, lies in the
backcourt. Guards Kenya Wilkins and
Orlando Williams combined for 38
points in last season's final meeting
with the Cardinal and are every bit as
deadly as Stanford's own lethal duo of
Dion Cross and Brevin Knight.
"Their two guards are the focal
point of what they're doing," Mont
gomery said.
Nobody likes comparisons, but the
two point guards, Wilkins and Knight,
are spitting images of each other. Both
are sophomores, both are 5-foot-10,
both are averaging 5.8 assists per
game. Knight's 15.6 points per game
edges Wilkins' 12.7. Knight is also
averaging close to one more steal and
rebound per game than his Duck coun
terpart.
"Kenya Wilkins is similar to Brevin
in many respects," Montgomery said.
"Very, very quick with the ball. Cre
ates a lot of problems with penetration
and handles everything really well."
The likeness between Cross and
Williams is also a bit uncanny. They
both measure in at 6-2, with Williams
about 30 pounds heavier at 207. Both
love shooting from deep. Cross is cur
rently converting a phenomenal 54.7
percent of his three pointers, tops in
the Pac-10. Williams is no slouch
either, hitting 45.5 percent of his treys.
The senior Duck is averaging 19.1 ppg
compared to the junior Cardinal, who
is close behind at 18.8.
"We're similar," Cross said. "The
only thing that really sets us apart is

that Williams is a senior. He's a
little more experienced and
mature. He knows more about
the game. He knows where he
wants the ball and where he
wants to be, and I'm still learn
ing that.
"I'd probably also say
Williams has a little bit more
range than I do because he's a
little stronger. But really, as
far as gamewise, it's even," he
said.
As for the Duck front line,
what they may lack in style,
they make up for in brute force
and a little foul play.
"The thing about Oregon's
front line is that they have six
or seven guys they use, and all
of them use their fouls," said
Cardinal forward Andy Pop
pink. "All of them push and
shove and play hard. That
makes it tough to play against
them."
Out-rebounded 94-72 in the
last two games, Stanford faces
another team that's tough on
the glass. Not an immensely
large team, with no player over
6-9, the Ducks nevertheless are
third in the conference in
rebounds.
"The rebouding's a con
cern," Montgomery said.
"[Against USC], the 22 offen
sive rebounds we allowed isn't
good enough. We're going to
have to sustain our block-offs.
We were kind of one-shot won
ders. We don't get it the first
time, we kind of get backed off
a little bit. We don't bother
going inside."
The Cardinal, with 7-1 Tim

Young at the pivot, brings more
size to the table. Bumps and
bruises, though, have caught
up to them. Knight is still play
ing with a stress reaction. Pop
pink's recovery from a shoulder
injury two weeks back is pro
gressing nicely, but forward
Darren Allaway, who played
two superb defensive games
last week in Southern Califor
nia, is the latest patient, nurs
ing a bad back.
"It's a pain thing," Mont
gomery said. "The doctors are
concerned about it getting
worse. But Darren feels like he
just has to deal with it.
"He has a crack in the verte
brae that is causing some dis
comfort and some pain, so we
have to rest him and nurse him
a little bit. See if we can get it
to calm down and let the pain
go away."
Allaway had his first prac
tice of the week yesterday, and
when game time rolls around,
the ailing Cardinal expects to
be ready to go.
"It's a flare-up kind of
thing," Allaway said. "It just
needs some time off. A nerve is
flaring up back there. It's not
going to go away. It's a chronic
thing that won't get consider
ably worse or better. But I'll be
ready for the game."
Likewise, the entire Cardi
nal team intends to give Ore
gon's dream season a rude
awakening.
"We're pretty confident,"
Poppink said. "These are two
games (against Oregon and
Oregon State) that we feel like
we need to have. We plan on
sweeping. We're not overconfi
dent about it because the Ore
gon game will be very tough,
but we feel good coming in."
