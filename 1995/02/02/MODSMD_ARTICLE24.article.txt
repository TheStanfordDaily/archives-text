I know the Super Bowl is old
news, but bear with me. ...

Super Bowl Sunday: During
media week, former Cardinal cor
nerback Darrien Gordon said of
49er wide receiver Jerry Rice, "I
wouldn't be surprised to see him
have eight catches — but as long
as he doesn't score any touch
downs, I think we'll win that bat

tie." Rice had 10 catches for 149
yards and three TDs, including a
44-yarder one minute and 24 sec
onds into the game.
Super Bowl II: The point spread
on the game, which fluctuated
from 18 to 20 points, was a heated
topic before kickoff. Although the
49ers easily won, for many people,
the game remained interesting
until the final play as the Charg
ers were in a position to beat the
spread with a touchdown on their
last possession. Stan Humphries'
last-gasp hail-Mary went out of
the end zone, and the Niners cov
ered, 49-26.
Blowout: The Stanford women's
basketball squad pummeled last


Kyle
Utsumi
year's Pacific 10 Conference
champion, USC, Saturday 109-53
for the largest margin of victory in
the history of the league. Com
bined with a 88-49 win over UCLA
Thursday, Stanford beat its L.A.
rivals by a total of 197-102.
In the Hunt: By overcoming the
Trojans Saturday, the men's
hoops team (13-3) improved to a
hard-fought 4-3 Pac-10 record,
one and a half games behind

UCLA and still in good position to
make the NCAA tournament in
March. After seeing Cal defeat
UCLA Saturday, it seems that the
league title is up for grabs as the
first half of the season winds
down.
Good Company: What do Stan
ford athletes Jenny Thompson
and Steve Stenstrom have in com
mon with Super Bowl MVP Steve
Young? They will all be honored at
the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame
enshrinement banquet Feb. 15.
Thompson, a two-time Olympic
gold medalist at the 1992 games in
Barcelona, and Stenstrom, the

Cardinal's record-breaking quar
terback, were named 1995 Colle
giate Athletes of the Year. Young
was named BASHOF Pro Athlete
of the Year.
Must See Flick: I had heard it
was good — a little long, but good.
After seeing "Hoop Dreams," I
have to agree with the rave
reviews. The movie is a fascinat
ing three-hour documentary fol
lowing the lives of two young
African-American boys from
inner-city Chicago who have
dreams of making it to the NBA.
Whether you ever played sports or
not, you will be touched by the

human story and the ironies of life
which are presented. "Hoop
Dreams" is playing at the Palo
Alto Square at 3000 El Camino
Real, just past Page Mill Road.
A for Effort: In an effort to
"acknowledge [fans'] patience and
support through these uncertain
times in baseball," the Oakland
A's announced reduced ticket
prices for the month of April.
Seats will range from $1 for
bleachers (regularly $4.50) to $6
MVP tickets (regularly $17.50).
Plaza and upper-reserved seats
will also be $1 for students with
valid ID. The reduced prices will

stand even if the Mtyor Leaguers
are back on the field.
Squeezing 0.J.: An ad in the

Busted Wing: The seniors on

Stanford's men's swim team are
seeking their fourth NCAA team
championship, but the Class of '95
is without its star butterflier Ray
Carey. The 1993 NCAA 200-yard
butterfly champion suffered a rare
case of nerve damage while swim
ming at last summer's World
Championships in Rome. Carey,
unable to extend his right shoul
der, is red-shirting this season as
he rehabilitates. "The team knows
that no matter who swims, the job
is the same, to go out and win
NCAAs,** he said. Carey, who
placed second in his specialty
event last year, will return for the
Cardinal next season.
