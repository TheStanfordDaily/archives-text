I know the Super Bowl is old
news, but bear with me. ...

Super Bowl Sunday: During
media week, former Cardinal cor
nerback Darrien Gordon said of
49er wide receiver Jerry Rice, "I
wouldn't be surprised to see him
have eight catches â€” but as long
as he doesn't score any touch
downs, I think we'll win that bat

tie." Rice had 10 catches for 149
yards and three TDs, including a
44-yarder one minute and 24 sec
onds into the game.
Super Bowl II: The point spread
on the game, which fluctuated
from 18 to 20 points, was a heated
topic before kickoff. Although the
49ers easily won, for many people,
the game remained interesting
until the final play as the Charg
ers were in a position to beat the
spread with a touchdown on their
last possession. Stan Humphries'
last-gasp hail-Mary went out of
the end zone, and the Niners cov
ered, 49-26.
