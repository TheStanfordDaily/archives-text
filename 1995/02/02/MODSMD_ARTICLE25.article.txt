# Men's gymnastics to tumble with SJS, SB
## 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
After a one-week break from
the team, Stanford's four newly
appointed U.S. National Team
members will rejoin their fellow
gymnasts as the fourth-ranked
Cardinal takes on San Jose
State and UC-Santa Barbara in
the Spartan's home arena
tonight.
Senior Josh Stein and sopho
mores Jamie Ellis and Keith
Wiley will return their focus to
Stanford gymnastics and NCAA
competition after their success
ful trip to the Winter Nationals
last weekend in Colorado. Grad
uate assistant Mark Booth
made the U.S. team alongside
them, but does not compete
with the Cardinal squad.
In addition to the three com

peting National Team mem
bers, gymnasts to look for
include sophomore lan
Bachrach, who took a number
of honors in the optionals of the
Spartan Open, and freshman
Tim Dalrymple, the runner-up
in last year's junior nationals.
Dalrymple has been hobbled by
injuries thus far but should
recover in time for this week
end.
The meet, while not featur
ing stellar competition from
other nationally-ranked squads,
will test Stanford. Coming into
the season, head coach Sadao
Hamada has focused his team
on performing more interna
tionally respected routines, a
change has forced his athletes
to relearn fundamentals.
Although the Cardinal won the
season-opening Spartan Open, the
types of difficulties encountered by
the gymnasts showed that their
development is still not quite com
plete. The meet this weekend
should provide a much clearer indi
cation as to the level of performance
of which the team is capable.
"Difficulty is stressed much less
in the NCAAs than it is in interna
tional competition," Hamada said.
"I want to prepare my team for
things like the Olympics as well as
the NCAAs, and that has taken
some extra time."
The NCAA only scores half a
point for difficulty versus the inter-

national standard of a full point. A
gymnast in the NCAA champi
onship effectively gets 9.5 points for
a routine that would net only 9.0 in
the Olympics. As a result, collegiate
gymnasts are often ill-prepared to
perform against their foreign coun
terparts, who have developed skills
superior to their own.
This upgrade of Stanford gym
nastics will prove crucial down the
road as Hamada looks towards the
NCAA Championships in April. For
the last three years, the competition
among the top echelon of collegiate
gymnasts has been tight, with Stan
ford, Ohio State and Nebraska play
ing musical chairs as the top three
teams. Its emphasis on difficult
skills may finally provide Stanford
the edge it needs to pull away.
