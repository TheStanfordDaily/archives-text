# Men's gymnastics to tumble with SJS, SB
## 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
After a one-week break from
the team, Stanford's four newly
appointed U.S. National Team
members will rejoin their fellow
gymnasts as the fourth-ranked
Cardinal takes on San Jose
State and UC-Santa Barbara in
the Spartan's home arena
tonight.
Senior Josh Stein and sopho
mores Jamie Ellis and Keith
Wiley will return their focus to
Stanford gymnastics and NCAA
competition after their success
ful trip to the Winter Nationals
last weekend in Colorado. Grad
uate assistant Mark Booth
made the U.S. team alongside
them, but does not compete
with the Cardinal squad.
In addition to the three com

peting National Team mem
bers, gymnasts to look for
include sophomore lan
Bachrach, who took a number
of honors in the optionals of the
Spartan Open, and freshman
Tim Dalrymple, the runner-up
in last year's junior nationals.
Dalrymple has been hobbled by
injuries thus far but should
recover in time for this week
end.
The meet, while not featur
ing stellar competition from
other nationally-ranked squads,
will test Stanford. Coming into
the season, head coach Sadao
Hamada has focused his team
on performing more interna
tionally respected routines, a
change has forced his athletes
to relearn fundamentals.
