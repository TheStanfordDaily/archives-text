# Football lands a solid recruit class
## Action, not hype, will decide the merit of these athletes 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
In what is quickly becoming
the norm for Tyrone Willingham,
Stanford's new head coach
announced the 1995 recruiting
class amid little pomp and cir
cumstance yesterday, the nation
al signing day for high-school
football players.
While signing day for many
coaches is like a second Christ
mas, Willingham instead chose to
describe the incoming class as
"solid" top to bottom, sparing
them any premature expectations
with his guarded optimism.
"I'm not into hyping these
guys," Willingham said. "The
game will determine if they are
good or if they are not good."
Looking to fill in at several key
positions, Willingham signed 21
high-school players and four
transfers. While this year's class
does not have the national stature
of Bill Walsh's previous two class
es (both rated in the top 15 in the
nation), 11 of the 25 recruits were
named to at least one prep or
junior college All-America team.
"We won't be looking for some
body out of this class to make an
immediate contribution," said
Willingham, contrasting the prac
tice of Walsh the past two years in
playing freshmen right away.
"The key for us will be the young
men we have on campus now."
With only one tight end and
two quarterbacks on the roster
heading to spring practice, these
two positions were Willingham's
primary concern. Looking every
where from junior colleges to
potential first-round picks in the
baseball high-school draft, Will

ingham left no stone unturned.
"You have to make sure you
have all your holes plugged, then
you look for the best athletes,"
Willingham said.
Greg Clark (6-foot-5, 260
pounds) and Derek Hubbard (6-3,
220) both come to Stanford with
strong resumes. Clark, a transfer
from Ricks College, was rated as
the No. 1 junior college tight end
prospect in the nation, according
to Super Prep Magazine. A first
team J.C. Ail-American, he
caught 44 passes for 565 yards
and seven touchdowns.
Hubbard, who transferred
from Fresno City College, also
was named to several J.C. All-
America teams. He caught 27
passes for 513 yards.
The tight end treasure trove
continues among the ranks of
prep stars the Cardinal signed, as
Tony Vella (6-4, 240) and Joe
Fairchild (6-6, 255) add incredible
depth to the depleted lineup.
A high school All-American,
Vella is one of the few names that
stands out in a class of few
"superstar" recruits.
"We like his bloodlines," Will
ingham said. "We like young men
in the program that have fathers
that understand the game of foot
ball, and his father played college
football at USC. Tony's a good
sized tight end that brings ability
to both be a receiver and a block
er.
On the quarterback front,
"potential" is the best word to
describe Chad Hutchinson (6-5,
230) and Tim Smith (6-4, 200).
Hutchinson, despite playing
quarterback for only one year in
high school, equally impressed and
dissuaded football scouts with his
arm strength. Reportedly able to
throw a football 65 yards with little
effort, his fastball has also been
clocked at 94 mph and is projected
as a top pick in June's high-school
baseball draft. As a junior last year,
he was 12-2 with a 1.38 ERA.
"I think he is very much wanting
to be a quarterback and prove him
self at that position," Willingham
said. "We hope baseball doesn't lure
him away. We will constantly stay
in touch with him to make sure [he
knows] how important we think he
can be to our program down the
road."
Smith was named to the All-Far
west team by Super Prep, among
other national accolades. Although
Smith was also an impressive free
safety in high school, Willingham
indicated that he will play quarter
back "because that's what we
recruited him as."
The other two transfers also look
to bolster the Cardinal in two posi
tions already fairly deep. Greg
Hairston, a cornerback from Glen
dale College, was a junior college
All-American and brings size (6-1,
190) to a relatively small secondary.
Jon Ritchie, a transfer from
Michigan, was slated to be the
Wolverines' starting fullback next
year. Ritchie (6-2, 240) will sit out
the 1995 season due to NCAA eligi
bility rules. All three junior college
players are eligible to play next year,
and all four transfers are currently
enrolled at Stanford.
Other high school Ail-Americans
include offensive linemen Eli Bur
riss (6-6, 250), Jeff Cronshagen (6-
7,270), Mike McLaughlin (6-4,275)
and Matt Motherway (6-4, 255),
defensive lineman Desmond Cook
(6-3, 260) and linebacker Brian
Toner (6-3, 225).
