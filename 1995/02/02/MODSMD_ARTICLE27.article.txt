# Women's hoops to hunt Ducks in Eugene

When one team destroys another top-25
ranked team by 56, some arrogance can be
expected.
It might be hard for the third-ranked
Stanford women's basketball team to take
the rest of the Pacific 10 Conference season
seriously after obliterating opponents by
scores of 94-59, 88-49 and 109-53 against
Washington State, UCLA and USC respec
tively. Not one to rest on past victories,
however, coach Tara VanDerver will make
sure her squad is prepared for Oregon
tonight â€” and for the rest of the season.

"Everyone knows that every game is
important," VanDerveer said. "It's real
early in the conference season and if you
don't come out strong in games, you can be
tied atop the standings in one weekend."
The Cardinal (16-1, 7-0 in the Pac-10) is
only a couple of games ahead of Washington.
"We want to have a 49ers' attitude,"
VanDerveer said. "We want to play against
ourselves."
Comparing Stanford with the Super
Bowl champions might not be too far
fetched. Both teams were highly rated
before the season began, both teams lost big
in an early season game and both teams
bounced back with a vengeance from the

defeat, leaving opponents cowering in their
wakes.
On the other hand, San Francisco has
already won the championship while the
Cardinal has a long way to go.
"I hope we're exactly halfway through
the season," VanDerveer said. "We hope we
have 17 more games."
With 11 games left on the Pac-10 sched
ule, the six extra contests would take Stan
ford into the NCAA title game. The Cardi
nal last made a trip to the Final Four in
1992 and three members of that national
championship team are still with Stanford.
