# Women's hoops to hunt Ducks in Eugene
## 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
When one team destroys another top-25
ranked team by 56, some arrogance can be
expected.
It might be hard for the third-ranked
Stanford women's basketball team to take
the rest of the Pacific 10 Conference season
seriously after obliterating opponents by
scores of 94-59, 88-49 and 109-53 against
Washington State, UCLA and USC respec
tively. Not one to rest on past victories,
however, coach Tara VanDerver will make
sure her squad is prepared for Oregon
tonight â€” and for the rest of the season.

"Everyone knows that every game is
important," VanDerveer said. "It's real
early in the conference season and if you
don't come out strong in games, you can be
tied atop the standings in one weekend."
The Cardinal (16-1, 7-0 in the Pac-10) is
only a couple of games ahead of Washington.
"We want to have a 49ers' attitude,"
VanDerveer said. "We want to play against
ourselves."
Comparing Stanford with the Super
Bowl champions might not be too far
fetched. Both teams were highly rated
before the season began, both teams lost big
in an early season game and both teams
bounced back with a vengeance from the

defeat, leaving opponents cowering in their
wakes.
On the other hand, San Francisco has
already won the championship while the
Cardinal has a long way to go.
"I hope we're exactly halfway through
the season," VanDerveer said. "We hope we
have 17 more games."
With 11 games left on the Pac-10 sched
ule, the six extra contests would take Stan
ford into the NCAA title game. The Cardi
nal last made a trip to the Final Four in
1992 and three members of that national
championship team are still with Stanford.
Seniors Rachel Hemmer,
Anita Kaplan and Kate Paye
(junior Bobbie Kelsey redshirt
ed that year with a knee injury)
were integral parts of the team
that went 30-3. Hemmer start
ed every game as a freshman,
averaging 11.2 points and 6.7
rebounds per game and Kaplan
was the top reserve on the team.
Kaplan chipped in 6.4 points
and 3.7 boards a game. As a
walk-on, T> aye played in 30
games anu made a valuable
contribution in the national
semifinal game.
"I've talked with [the other
two seniors] about the Final
Four," Kaplan said. "We know

this is our last season and we
really want to get back. A lot
depends on the team chem
istry."
Overconfidence, complacency
and playing for personal statis
tics are three pitfalls a team
must overcome, especially one
that outscores its opponents by
28 points per game. Stanford, so
far, has not fallen into those
traps.
VanDerveer actually feels
that the Cardinal has erred in
the opposite direction, often
passing the ball too much and
playing too unselfishly. After
the USC game, she complained
that the team did not take
enough shots. As for complacen
cy and overconfidence, Van-
Derveer believes that the team
will avoid any potential prob
lems.

"I don't feel that the team is
overconfident," she said. "We
have a lot of time and a lot to
work on. We need to continue to
work hard.
"There are people on the
team who have lost on the road.
There are people who have lost
at Oregon State, at Washington,
at UCLA and USC. We have to
maintain that kind of mentality
that anything can happen."
The Cardinal will have its
first chance to do just that
against Oregon tonight. The
Ducks (11-5, 4-3) feature a top
notch center in Renae Fegent.
Fegent, an Australian, was
recently the Pac-10 player of
the week. The Ducks look to
return to the national spotlight
as they were ranked in the top
25 before losing at Arizona and
Arizona State.
