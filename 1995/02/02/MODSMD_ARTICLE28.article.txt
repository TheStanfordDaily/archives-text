# Women gymnasts strive for perfection at home

### Ben Hur Contributing writer 
There is one sight that brings a
smile to the face of each member
of the Stanford women's gymnas
tics team — home, sweet home.
The Cardinal faces UC-Santa
Barbara, UC-Davis and Seattle
Pacific this Friday night at Burn
ham Pavilion, where Stanford has
yet to suffer defeat this season.
"It will be nice to be at home
after being away for a couple of
weeks," said sophomore all
arounder Katie Jennings.
Jennings returns to competi
tion after sitting out last week due
to bulging disks in her neck and
back. She will perform on the
vault, floor and uneven bars, bol
stering a Cardinal lineup that has
endured several injuries this sea
son. Seniors Katie Clancy, Jene'
Elzie and Meegan Lannin, along
with junior Linda Chun and
freshman Amy Neil have all been
limited by nagging injuries.
However, with Stanford's deep
roster, there is little concern
about the quality of the team's
performance.

Freshman Amy Neil executes her uneven bars routine in a meet against Cal.
"We're not worried because
this gives us an opportunity to
show our depth," Elzie said.
"Other members of the team
will get a chance to show their
stuff."
Competing at home has also
boosted the spirits and confi

dence of the Cardinal squad.
"Everyone is excited about
competing at home again," said
freshman all-arounder Keri
Monahan. "At home, everybody
is a little more relaxed, and we
know we have the crowd on our
side."
Along with adding new skills
and elements, the gymnasts
have heightened their focus on
the details of their routines.
"We've been working on

sticking landings and bending
our knees," Monahan said. "We
need to clean up our form a little
bit."
Barring a major breakdown,
Stanford should remain unbeat
en at home. Unlike last week
end, the Cardinal will have a full
lineup Friday night.
"We should pretty much
dominate," said co-captain Clan
cy. "We're going to kick their
butts, and it's going to be fun."
