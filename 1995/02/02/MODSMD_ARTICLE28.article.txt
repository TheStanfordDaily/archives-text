# Women gymnasts strive for perfection at home

There is one sight that brings a
smile to the face of each member
of the Stanford women's gymnas
tics team — home, sweet home.
The Cardinal faces UC-Santa
Barbara, UC-Davis and Seattle
Pacific this Friday night at Burn
ham Pavilion, where Stanford has
yet to suffer defeat this season.
"It will be nice to be at home
after being away for a couple of
weeks," said sophomore all
arounder Katie Jennings.
Jennings returns to competi
tion after sitting out last week due
to bulging disks in her neck and
back. She will perform on the
vault, floor and uneven bars, bol
stering a Cardinal lineup that has
endured several injuries this sea
son. Seniors Katie Clancy, Jene'
Elzie and Meegan Lannin, along
with junior Linda Chun and
freshman Amy Neil have all been
limited by nagging injuries.
However, with Stanford's deep
roster, there is little concern
about the quality of the team's
performance.
