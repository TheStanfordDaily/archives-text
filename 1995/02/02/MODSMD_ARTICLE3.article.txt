# Changing times complicate fund raising
## 
### Burt Herman Staff writer 
In an age of shrinking federal dol
lars and more cautious corporate gen
erosity, Stanford is more often look
ing toward larger donors in order to
grow and keep prospering.
In recent years, Stanford has seen
the biggest increase in donations in
the area of large gifts, most notably
David Packard and William Hewlett's
recent $77.4 million gift.
But large gifts can be something of
a mixed blessing as these donors often
place restrictions on their gifts to cer
tain departments or projects in order

to serve their own goals, as well as
philanthropic ideals.
And while the overall amount that
Stanford receives in gifts each year
ranks it in the top five of private uni
versities, donations in smaller dollar
amounts have been stagnating, with a
relatively small percentage of alumni
giving money in comparison with
other Ivy League schools.
Strategic corporate support
Even though recessionary condi
tions both in the United States and
abroad seem to be letting up, corpo
rations have taken a more careful ap
proach with their investments in

universities — a situation which is
likely to carry over into the next
decade.
Corporate "thinking is less philan
thropic and more driven by business
strategy," said Evelyn Kelsey, direc
tor of foundation and corporate rela
tions for the Office of Development.
"Corporate philanthropy has flat
tened.
Most corporate donations go to
ward faculty research, Kelsey said.
"They fund a line of research they
hope will benefit their corporation,"
she said.
Companies have focused most of
their giving on the schools of engi

neering, medicine and business,
Kelsey said. "It's very difficult to get
donations for humanities," she
added. ♦
From all sources of donations in
the 1992-93 fiscal year, the School of
Engineering received a total of about
$20 million, the School of Medicine
received about $54 million and the
Graduate School of Business received
about $8 million.
The School of Humanities and Sci
ences split $27 million, and the total
of unrestricted gifts was only $2.5
million.
In a 1973 speech to the Commit
tee for Corporate Support of Amer
ican Universities, David Packard
very clearly enunciated what he felt
should be the aim of corporate
donations.
One of Packard's first guidelines
is that the university should be pri
vate, because corporations already
support public universities
through taxes.
But Packard's strongest point
was that corporations should be
firm in directing the uses of their
rtioney toward their own interests.
"I recognise that for the univer
sity, unrestricted money is most
valuable," Packard said. "It does
not necessarily follow, however,
that unrestricted money, used as it
has been used, is always in the
interest of the corporation.
"Should our corporation make
an unrestricted contribution and
leave it to the trustees or the admin
istration or the faculty to decide
how the money should be used?" he
asked. "Or do we have a responsibil
ity to our stockholders to be sure the
money will, in some defensible way,
benefit our corporation?"
When Packard gave his speech
in the 19705, the atmosphere sur
rounding American universities
was considerably more controver
sial, given the tumultuous 19605.
I le made sure to address this in his
advice to corporations, saying that
"too often, faculty decisions are
determined by a militant minority
of the faculty."
Packard pointed out specific
departments which he said were
"hostile to business and the free
enterprise system."
"Departments of economics are
particularly vulnerable, as are
departments of religion and other
areas of the humanities," he con
tinued.
"I happen to believe that such
hostile groups of scholars are, to a
large degree, responsible for the
anti-business of many of our young
people today," Packard said. "And I
do not believe it is in the corporate
interest to support them — which
is what we do to a greater or lesser
degree with unrestricted funds."
Restricted gifts on the rise
Even though corporate gifts
have slowed down in the past
decade, there has been a dramatic
increase in the amount of large

gifts given to the University.
The total dollar amount per year
from individuals giving gifts under
$100,000 has remained roughly
the same over the last 15 years,
according to statistics kept by the
Office of Development.
But donations to the University
have increased dramatically in the
area of large gifts — in amounts of
over $100,000.
William Hewlett and David
Packard have led the field in dona
tions to Stanford. Their recent gift
of $77.4 million to finish the Sci
ence and Engineering Quad was
the largest private gift ever given to
Stanford.
Out of the top five largest gifts
to the University, the Hewlett and
Packard names appear four times
— which, when added to other
smaller gifts brings their total to
over $300 million.
Dave Glen, director of principal
gifts in the Office of Development,
hesitates to discuss the exact strat
egy he uses to attract large donors.
"We essentially put good ideas
before people that have money —
matching up people to ideas," he
said. "At Stanford, there's been a
lot of really good ideas."
The recent Centennial Cam
paign brought in over $1 billion,
and also contributed to an overall
increase in large-gift donations.
The theory behind a campaign
like the Centennial, Glen said, is to
"find a set of objectives that need
funding."
"It takes large gifts to fund large
projects — that's what you focus
on," he said.
The drawback to these larger
gifts is the fact that they are often
more limited. Individuals who give
in such large amounts often have
very specific ideas about how they
want their money spent — leaving
administrators with fewer choices
when planning the larger Universi
ty budget.
"Very large gifts are very
restrictive," Glen said. And much
of the recent money being raised
has been in the form of these large
gifts.
Projects such as new buildings
have more appeal to donors, Glen
said, while the renovations of exist
ing structures and the support of
academic programs do not attract
large donations.
Since the 1989 earthquake, the
Stanford Art Museum has been
trying to raise $27 million to re
open its doors, but has not been
able to meet its goal. "That's
tougher money to raise than sci

ence buildings," Glen said. "You
need to have people with an art
interest."
Large gifts also do not help in
the substantial day-to-day operat
ing costs of the buildings, Glen
said.
"Clearly, unrestricted gifts pro
vide the most flexibility," said Tim
k Warner, director of the budget in
the provost's office. "But restricted
funds go to supporting important
projects."
"Basically what we're trying to
do is make the best use of funds
that come in,"he said.
But large restricted gifts do not
necessarily give the University
more flexibility with other depart
ments' budgets. "Does it mean that
money is freed (for other areas)?"
Warner said. "That's too far down
to look."
Smaller donors isolated?
Even though large gifts are on
the rise, the number of gifts in all
other sizes has remained stable
over the past 40 years.
The Stanford Fund was estab
lished last September to broaden
the base of alumni donors and
encourage more unrestricted giv
ing, Glen said. The future for Stan
ford lies in building up the small
donor pool and establishing a habit
of giving among alumni, he said.
The Office of Development
hired Jerold Pearson last April to
look into why Stanford alumni are
not giving to their alma mater.
"Stanford does not do a good
enough job establishing a strong
relationship with alumni," Pearson
said. "When they graduate, we
seem to lose them."
In a survey of alumni that Pear
son conducted last July, 97 percent
polled said they were satisfied with
their education. But only 20 per
cent agreed with the statement,
"Stanford makes me feel like I'm
still an important part of the Stan
ford community."
"We need to do a better job of
engaging our alumni," Pearson
said.
Although some believe that the
lackluster participation of alumni
is based on the recent controversy
Stanford experienced with the fed
eral government dealing with indi
rect costs, Pearson said that alum
ni are "not influenced by the events
of the day...the participation rate
remains the same over the last 40
years."
Another part of the problem is
that alumni feel their donations
have little effect on Stanford's

apparently vast pool of money,
Pearson said.
"One hesitation is the sense that
a contribution will have more
impact on local organizations than
on Stanford," he said.
Even though the total amount
of smaller gifts do not approach the
total of larger gifts, these gifts are
still very important to the function
ing of the University.
"The discretionary money that
is so important comes from these
smaller gifts," Glen said. "The
money to operate buildings comes
from smaller gifts."
What does the future hold?
As the U.S. economy continues
to grow, so too do the hopes of
Stanford in maintaining its fund
raising pace.
"I think the pendulum might
swing back," Kelsey said. But she
still had reservations as to whether
corporate philanthropy will return
to the same level as in the early
1980s.
Large gifts are paid out over sev
eral years, which serves to boost the
total giving amounts over a period
of time, Glen said. "We're going to
have some pretty big years in front
of us," Glen said, due to pledges
from Hewlett and Packard that will
be fulfilled in the upcoming years.
But as the tide of giving from
the Centennial Campaign dries up,

the University will have to look to
new ways of garnering donor inter
est.
Universities are dealing with
people who are more careful about
their generosity — making the
challenge to devise new ways of
attracting donors even more press
ing.
Education is second only to reli
gion as the top beneficiaiy of chari
table donations. Schools and uni
versities received $15 billion in
gifts in 1993.
And in the past few years, public
universities have started to solicit
their alumni, placing all institu
tions of higher learning into
tougher competition than before.
"The 1990s could be the most
difficult climate for higher educa
tion in five decades," according to a
report by the Common Fund, a
non-profit group that gives invest
ment advice to universities.
As Stanford looks into its wallet
for future funds, the trend in large,
restricted gifts will constrain the
budget process — creating the need
for a larger base of unrestricted
funds. The Stanford Fund may be
the first step down the road toward
this goal, but alumni must feel
more connected with the Universi
ty before they will donate the kind
of unrestricted funds on which the
financial future of the University
may depend.
