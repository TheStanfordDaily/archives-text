# Changing times complicate fund raising

In an age of shrinking federal dol
lars and more cautious corporate gen
erosity, Stanford is more often look
ing toward larger donors in order to
grow and keep prospering.
In recent years, Stanford has seen
the biggest increase in donations in
the area of large gifts, most notably
David Packard and William Hewlett's
recent $77.4 million gift.
But large gifts can be something of
a mixed blessing as these donors often
place restrictions on their gifts to cer
tain departments or projects in order

to serve their own goals, as well as
philanthropic ideals.
And while the overall amount that
Stanford receives in gifts each year
ranks it in the top five of private uni
versities, donations in smaller dollar
amounts have been stagnating, with a
relatively small percentage of alumni
giving money in comparison with
other Ivy League schools.
Strategic corporate support
Even though recessionary condi
tions both in the United States and
abroad seem to be letting up, corpo
rations have taken a more careful ap
proach with their investments in

universities — a situation which is
likely to carry over into the next
decade.
Corporate "thinking is less philan
thropic and more driven by business
strategy," said Evelyn Kelsey, direc
tor of foundation and corporate rela
tions for the Office of Development.
"Corporate philanthropy has flat
tened.
Most corporate donations go to
ward faculty research, Kelsey said.
"They fund a line of research they
hope will benefit their corporation,"
she said.
Companies have focused most of
their giving on the schools of engi

neering, medicine and business,
Kelsey said. "It's very difficult to get
donations for humanities," she
added. ♦
From all sources of donations in
the 1992-93 fiscal year, the School of
Engineering received a total of about
$20 million, the School of Medicine
received about $54 million and the
Graduate School of Business received
about $8 million.
The School of Humanities and Sci
ences split $27 million, and the total
of unrestricted gifts was only $2.5
million.
