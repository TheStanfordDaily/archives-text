The new San
Francisco Mu
seum of Mod
ern Art is modern art.
Both inside and out, the
building evokes a sense
of an impending future,
a swirling excitement
captured in its project
ing skylight. The muse
um is a proud embodi
ment of new ideas that
quite literally trounce
upon the old.
The building was de
signed by Swiss archi
tect Mario Botta, who
revamped the old
building's approach to
housing art and pro
duced a smashing, new,
intriguing and unique
building.
The relocated muse
um opened on Jan. IS
and concludes a crucial
element of the Yerba
Buena Gardens twelve
block cultural center.
The snazzy new build-

ing is a located at 151 Third Street, in
the heart of the downtown area. Its
red bricks pierce the San Francisco
gray fog, and the black-and-white
stone cylindrical skylight is a striking
relief from the tall, gray office build
ings in the background.

The Third Street entrance is an im
mediate introduction to the inge
nious craftsmanship exhibited inside
the building, combining utility and
design. The entrance doors are incor
porated into the overall face of the
building, blending seemlessly. The
door panels are reflective and silver
squares, which create an intricate
geometric design when closed. The
same is true inside the museum,
where museum personnel can be
seen emerging and exiting the main
floor through doors that when
closed, inconspicuously fold into the
design of the room.
The beige wood doors that circle the
main foyer complement the lights,
which emerge as a patterned design
on the ceiling, and the rugged stone
floor surface of the staircase, an in
triguing texture which reduces the
clamor of pounding feet. All three el
ements serve simultaneuosly as cru
cial parts to the workings of the mu
seum and intricate components of an
artistic composition.
Botta's artistry is further ex
hibited by his sensitivity to
line and light throughout
his endeavor to combine the func
tional with the beautiful. The semi
transparent bridge that connects the
staircase to the art work on the fourth
floor is not only a unique visual expe
rience from above and below, but
also it clearly serves its function of
connecting the viewers to the art. The
bridge's dense, yet spaced lines of

thin metal crossbars reverberate the
shiny/dull pattern of black stone that is
stacked linearly on the walls of the main
foyer.
The truncated cylindrical skylight
evokes the awesome feeling of a high
ceilinged cathedral while funneling a warm

bath of natural light throughout the center
of the building. The presence of natural
light in Botta's architectural masterpiece is
the difference between a camera snapshot
taken outside and a snapshot taken inside a
dorm hallway lit by overhead flourescent
lights.

Aside from the
aesthetic im
provements of
the new SFMOMA, the
building has made some
technical improvements
that justify the vast
amounts of time and
money (over $65 mil
lion, collected mostly as
private donations) spent
on the project. The old
SFMOMA was located
on the fourth floor of the
War Memorial Veterans
Building in the Civic
Center. This building's
cramped quarters pro
vided little room for the
permanent collection or
borrowed art. Also, at
times, other museums
had refused to lend the
old MOMA artworks be
cause of its inefficient
lighting and heating
controls. Botta graceful
ly included improve
ments in all these areas
and added an elevator

the size of a living room so that large
pieces do not need to he taken off
their canvases for transportation be
tween floors.
Aside from supporting up-and
coming San Francisco artists, the mu
seum owns a permanent collection of
over 15,000 pieces of art. The museum
has some impressive pieces by the Ab
stract Expressionists, German Expres
sionists and others. The bulk of the
collection consists of lesser-known
works by famous artists as well as very
important pieces by lesser known
artists.
The SFMOMA has not been con
sidered as prestigious as the MOMA of
New York, but the additional space
and funding will allow the museum to
acquire at least one major work a year
to add to its permanent collection.
Several hundred pieces of the perma
nent collection are now hanging
proudly on the fresh white walls of the
galleries.
Although the new SFMOMA is ex
pected to grow to be a leader in the art
world, its location in the Yerba Buena
Center is clouded by a sketchy history
of money groping and dirty politics.
According to the San Francisco Bay
Guardian, the 40-year saga included
evicting a working-class neighbor
hood and many family businesses
(with no relocation plan) in order to
clear the area.
Yet the museum is an invitation to
the future. It invites us to see the value
of modern art, and the value of the
museum as an artistic spectacle itself.
The SFMOMA is the embodiment of a

new, self-con
sciously creative

important pieces by lesser known
artists.
The SFMOMA has not been con
sidered as prestigious as the MOMA of
New York, but the additional space
and funding will allow the museum to
acquire at least one major work a year
to add to its permanent collection.
Several hundred pieces of the perma
nent collection are now hanging
proudly on the fresh white walls of the
galleries.
Although the new SFMOMA is ex
pected to grow to be a leader in the art
world, its location in the Yerba Buena
Center is clouded by a sketchy history
of money groping and dirty politics.
According to the San Francisco Bay
Guardian, the 40-year saga included
evicting a working-class neighbor
hood and many family businesses
(with no relocation plan) in order to
clear the area.
Yet the museum is an invitation to
the future. It invites us to see the value
of modern art, and the value of the
museum as an artistic spectacle itself.
The SFMOMA is the embodiment of a

vision of both
