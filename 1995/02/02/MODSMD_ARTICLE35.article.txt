# FROM MTV TO MACEDONIA ALLEGORIES, MILCHO MANCHEVSKI'S CIRCLE COMES FULL 'ROUND
## 
### AÏDA CROAL 
It started with a feeling. A heavi
ness in the air. An expectation that

H something big was going to hap
pen, but one couldn't be sure

whether that thing would be tragic
or cleansing. Perhaps it would be

both. For director Milcho

Manchevski, a trip back home to
the Former Yugoslavian Republic
of Macedonia (FYROM), located
in one of the most unstable and

bloody regions of the world
today, provided the timely cata
lyst for his first feature film, "Be
fore the Rain."
Before this feature, Manchevski
had been working for other people,

\s a director, he worked on every-

thing from commercial to music

video scripts. Among his most highly

acclaimed works was the video for Ar

rested Development's "Tennessee," a

beautiful and visually arresting piece that

won him both the 1992 MTV and Billboard
awards for Best Video / Rap.
But then came the homecoming and the
heavy feeling.

"That was the spark," Milcho says quiet
ly, from his cushioned seat in San Francis
co's Presott Hotel. "The expectation and the
joy of being back home gave me the spark to
write for myself. And not just for myself, but
something where 1 would express what I
wanted to say."
The spectacular result is "Before the
Rain," a film divided into three discreet sec
tions. In "Words" we meet Kiril (Gregoire
Colin), a young Macedonian monk who has
taken a vow of silence and Zamira (Labina
Mitevska), a frightened Albanian girl on the
run. "Faces" bounces us into London, where
a slick photo editor Anne (Katrin Cartlidge)
is forced to choose between her sensitive
guy husband and Pulitzer Prize-winning
war photographer Aleksandar Kirkov (Rade
Serbedzija). "Pictures" pulls us back into
Macedonia where, upon returning to his
homeland, Aleksandar finds his village pop
ulated with uzis and unfounded ethnic ha
treds.
Within the circular structure of the film,
these three very simple stories collide, creat
ing havoc and loss before eventually ceding
some hope.
As a writer, Manchevski sought to
say two things with the film.
"First, that we all have personal
responsibilities and we need to take sides.
That's part of our personal responsibility."
In the film, no one is innocent nor are they
spared the chaos of violence and death.
Characters that try to ignore the conflict
that surrounds them pay dearly for it. Those
who do act also pay a price. For Manchevski
however, the difference between the two
choices is significant.
"You're denying yourself a full sense of
living by not speaking out," he insists, em
phatically. "You cannot avoid feeling on
your skin your own responsibility by being
there and not acting. Because there comes a
point when you cannot change the channel

from

CNN to

the Cartoon
Network.

You can run but you

can't hide seems to be the philosophy that
Manchevski is coming from."It comes out
of the TV and into your living room," he in
sists. "And you can say, 'I have nothing to do
with this fight,' and that is very true. But you
do. Because it's your money that goes to buy
guns, it's your elected official that gets in
volved in that war. Besides, it's your fellow
human being."

Manchevski can't say enough about this
topic, probably because he's followed the
developments on the home front quite
closely. And unlike those of us who can ab
stract the different conflicts under the
amorphous title of "war," Manchevski is
able to relate basic interactions between
people to a larger context.

"This

whole

new wave of

nationalism is

completely brainless and

irrational. Nationalism meaning ethnic
or racial hatred based on nothing.
"In the film 1 try to say that usually it's
just an outlet for other frustrations and an
inability to deal with life. So, you're too poor
and you can't get it up and it's the fault of
your neighbor — the Albanian or the Mace
donian or what have you."

is a phrase that pcips up in interesting places
during the film. "That, of course, refers to
the structure," says Manchevski.
"The film was always meant to be circu
lar. At first, only metaphorically and then
even literally. For two reasons, basically.
One, it reflects on the 'message' that revenge
begets revenge. Secondly, it offered me a

great opportunity for formal play."

At the Sundance Film Festival, crit
ics read the film in ways that

Manchevski himself had not thought

of.
"There are two glitches in the circle

which make it a time paradox. One
is the fact that Anne couldn't be

looking at pictures of Kiril and Za
mira on her desk if the story were
circular. The second one was when
Kiril calls for Aleksandar and talks
to [Anne] instead. We put those

two there to put kinks in the circle,
to make it more metaphysical. Oth
erwise it's too easy. And it closes it.

It doesn't give it any hope," says Mil

cho. And then he smiles, realizing

what he's just said. "I guess it's the

kinks that give the hope."
Manchevski credits avant-garde

filmmakers like Michael Snow, Bruce

Bailey and Bruce Conner with broadening
his narrative horizons. "They opened me up
to all the possibilities of non-narrative film.
Or the possibility of more interesting narra
tive film," he says, recalling his film school
days.
Even though he studied what he terms
"old-fashioned artists" like Michaelangelo
and Rembrandt, Manchevski believed that
even these artists took various forms and
pushed them to new limits. "Experiment
just for the sake of experiment is not
enough. Good art needs to take a leap and
take the audience with it."
When asked about the tough parts of di
recting this movie, Manchevski does not
hesitate. "The producers," he says firmly. "I
had a total of 12 producers by the time the
film was finished. And they were not apos
tles. I started off with three and I felt like
Macßeth. When it grew to seven, I said, well
OK, I feel like Snow White. In the end I
think I felt like Ali Baba."
Manchevski was not to be deterred. In
order to finance the film, he brought togeth
er the UK, France and Macedonia, three
countries that had never worked together
before. On top of that, at the time the film
was being shot, Macedonia was still not rec
ognized by the UK or France. Nevertheless,
he shot the entire film on location in Mace
donia and London, sometimes traveling by
donkey, or by foot, other times building
roads to get to the coveted destinations.
Now that the film is «ut, audiences
around the globe are responding
to it with intensity. "The interest
ing thing is that it's gotten audiences very
emotional, in a very similar way. Audiences
that are really, by temperament, very differ
ent. From Brazil to Sweden to Austria to
Puerto Rico to Macedonia and then the
States."
One might not have guessed that a trip
back home would yield such fruitful results.
But the air held expectation, the Venice In
ternational Film Festival bestowed it with a
Golden Lion Award for Best Picture, and
"Before the Rain" has yet to weather the
shower of accolades still to come. ■

As a writer, Manchevski sought to
say two things with the film.
"First, that we all have personal
responsibilities and we need to take sides.
That's part of our personal responsibility."
In the film, no one is innocent nor are they
spared the chaos of violence and death.
Characters that try to ignore the conflict
that surrounds them pay dearly for it. Those
who do act also pay a price. For Manchevski
however, the difference between the two
choices is significant.
"You're denying yourself a full sense of
living by not speaking out," he insists, em
phatically. "You cannot avoid feeling on
your skin your own responsibility by being
there and not acting. Because there comes a
point when you cannot change the channel

from

CNN to

the Cartoon
Network.

You can run but you

can't hide seems to be the philosophy that
Manchevski is coming from."It comes out
of the TV and into your living room," he in
sists. "And you can say, 'I have nothing to do
with this fight,' and that is very true. But you
do. Because it's your money that goes to buy
guns, it's your elected official that gets in
volved in that war. Besides, it's your fellow
human being."

Manchevski can't say enough about this
topic, probably because he's followed the
developments on the home front quite
closely. And unlike those of us who can ab
stract the different conflicts under the
amorphous title of "war," Manchevski is
able to relate basic interactions between
people to a larger context.

"This

whole

new wave of

nationalism is

completely brainless and

irrational. Nationalism meaning ethnic
or racial hatred based on nothing.
"In the film 1 try to say that usually it's
just an outlet for other frustrations and an
inability to deal with life. So, you're too poor
and you can't get it up and it's the fault of
your neighbor — the Albanian or the Mace
donian or what have you."

is a phrase that pcips up in interesting places
during the film. "That, of course, refers to
the structure," says Manchevski.
"The film was always meant to be circu
lar. At first, only metaphorically and then
even literally. For two reasons, basically.
One, it reflects on the 'message' that revenge
begets revenge. Secondly, it offered me a

great opportunity for formal play."

At the Sundance Film Festival, crit
ics read the film in ways that

Manchevski himself had not thought

of.
"There are two glitches in the circle

which make it a time paradox. One
is the fact that Anne couldn't be

looking at pictures of Kiril and Za
mira on her desk if the story were
circular. The second one was when
Kiril calls for Aleksandar and talks
to [Anne] instead. We put those

two there to put kinks in the circle,
to make it more metaphysical. Oth
erwise it's too easy. And it closes it.

It doesn't give it any hope," says Mil

cho. And then he smiles, realizing

what he's just said. "I guess it's the

kinks that give the hope."
Manchevski credits avant-garde

filmmakers like Michael Snow, Bruce

Bailey and Bruce Conner with broadening
his narrative horizons. "They opened me up
to all the possibilities of non-narrative film.
Or the possibility of more interesting narra
tive film," he says, recalling his film school
days.
Even though he studied what he terms
"old-fashioned artists" like Michaelangelo
and Rembrandt, Manchevski believed that
even these artists took various forms and
pushed them to new limits. "Experiment
just for the sake of experiment is not
enough. Good art needs to take a leap and
take the audience with it."
When asked about the tough parts of di
recting this movie, Manchevski does not
hesitate. "The producers," he says firmly. "I
had a total of 12 producers by the time the
film was finished. And they were not apos
tles. I started off with three and I felt like
Macßeth. When it grew to seven, I said, well
OK, I feel like Snow White. In the end I
think I felt like Ali Baba."
Manchevski was not to be deterred. In
order to finance the film, he brought togeth
er the UK, France and Macedonia, three
countries that had never worked together
before. On top of that, at the time the film
was being shot, Macedonia was still not rec
ognized by the UK or France. Nevertheless,
he shot the entire film on location in Mace
donia and London, sometimes traveling by
donkey, or by foot, other times building
roads to get to the coveted destinations.
Now that the film is «ut, audiences
around the globe are responding
to it with intensity. "The interest
ing thing is that it's gotten audiences very
emotional, in a very similar way. Audiences
that are really, by temperament, very differ
ent. From Brazil to Sweden to Austria to
Puerto Rico to Macedonia and then the
States."
One might not have guessed that a trip
back home would yield such fruitful results.
But the air held expectation, the Venice In
ternational Film Festival bestowed it with a
Golden Lion Award for Best Picture, and
"Before the Rain" has yet to weather the
shower of accolades still to come. ■

It started with a feeling. A heavi
ness in the air. An expectation that

H something big was going to hap
pen, but one couldn't be sure

whether that thing would be tragic
or cleansing. Perhaps it would be

both. For director Milcho

Manchevski, a trip back home to
the Former Yugoslavian Republic
of Macedonia (FYROM), located
in one of the most unstable and

bloody regions of the world
today, provided the timely cata
lyst for his first feature film, "Be
fore the Rain."
Before this feature, Manchevski
had been working for other people,

\s a director, he worked on every-

thing from commercial to music

video scripts. Among his most highly

acclaimed works was the video for Ar

rested Development's "Tennessee," a

beautiful and visually arresting piece that

won him both the 1992 MTV and Billboard
awards for Best Video / Rap.
But then came the homecoming and the
heavy feeling.

"That was the spark," Milcho says quiet
ly, from his cushioned seat in San Francis
co's Presott Hotel. "The expectation and the
joy of being back home gave me the spark to
write for myself. And not just for myself, but
something where 1 would express what I
wanted to say."
The spectacular result is "Before the
Rain," a film divided into three discreet sec
tions. In "Words" we meet Kiril (Gregoire
Colin), a young Macedonian monk who has
taken a vow of silence and Zamira (Labina
Mitevska), a frightened Albanian girl on the
run. "Faces" bounces us into London, where
a slick photo editor Anne (Katrin Cartlidge)
is forced to choose between her sensitive
guy husband and Pulitzer Prize-winning
war photographer Aleksandar Kirkov (Rade
Serbedzija). "Pictures" pulls us back into
Macedonia where, upon returning to his
homeland, Aleksandar finds his village pop
ulated with uzis and unfounded ethnic ha
treds.
Within the circular structure of the film,
these three very simple stories collide, creat
ing havoc and loss before eventually ceding
some hope.
