# Depicting 'the underbelly of New Zealand society'
## Actress Rena Owen on 'Once There Were Warriors 
### Julie Tsai 
It's a rare movie that ougrosses "Jurassic Park" (ac
cording to actress Rena Owen), rarer still if it trades
in big-budget, show-ftopping special effects on the
cusp of technology in return for dark family drama, so
cial issues and an edgy female lead. But that's exactly
what's been done in New Zealand by "Once Were War
riors," a first-time feature film effort produced by Com
municado, the largest native independent production
house.
Whether "Once Were Warriors," now the number
one-grossing movie ever in New Zealand, has created an
engaging pop-culture chemistry of urban deterioration,
exotic peoples and raw emotions, or is indeed a work of
virtuosity, the film has taken the international film com
munity by storm.
"Warriors" was one of the hottest movies at the
Cannes film festival, selling out in two days and winning
18 awards around the world. In its native country, it
grossed in 10 weeks what "The Piano" made in 33. Not
bad for a work made in 36 days on a budget of $1.6 mil
lion.
So it is with obvious pride that starring actress Rena
Owen discussed the impact "Once Were Warriors" has
had on her native country.
"It's part of the nation's psyche," Owen marveled. "It's
the first (New Zealand) movie to look at these deep, dark
issues and take them by the horns. There's nothing nice
and polite about it."
A 'Warriors' problem
"Warriors" examines violent family dynamics in
urban New Zeland in a contemporary Maori family, de
scendants of a Polynesian group that migrated to New
Zealand in the 15th century. Owen plays the part of the
heroine, Beth, a mother of five torn by her tumultuous
relationship with her brutally hot-headed husband fake.
The movie is based on a best-selling novel by Alan Duff
that caused some controversy in New Zealand because of
its forthright treatment of domestic abuse.
"A lot of peopie we it afraid to touch |the project],"
Owen said. "No one had ever chosen to depict the un
derbelly of (modern New Zealand) society."
But the film's producers stuck with the project tor its
compelling story and characters. And they decided to
switch the book's narrative point of view from lake to
Beth for the screen adaptation, perhaps because director
Lee Tamahori always had Owen in mind for the part of
Beth. By the time of the movie's release eight months ago,
public uneasiness over the subject matter had been de-

fused.
And yet the results of "Warriors," according to Owen,
are to have a social rather than box office impact.
"Domestic violence groups here are being inundated
by people of all races saying, 'I've got a Warriors' prob
lem. It's become a password," Owen said.
Although Owen is pleased with the "Warriors" effect
on New Zealand, she cautions, "it would be very small
minded to assume all Maori lived like that, though it's
certainly accurate for that section of society."
'The Hole to make my mark 1
Owen is also appreciative of what she calls a "gift of a
role." With 11 years of TV and theater experience in act
ing, writing and directing, Owen lamented, "you just
don't get many great dramatic female roles."
So Owen said she knew from the time she read the
script, "112 Beth] would be the role to make my mark on the
international map. This role is special."
Owen, like Beth, has a strong Maori background
which she traces to a royal bloodline. This helped her to
create Beth's strength and dignity, Owen said. There,
however, the similarities end. Owen is neither a mother
nor a wife, and "1 certainly would never let a man treat
me (abusively)," she said.

In addition, Owen is quick to note that her ethnicity
does not limit her range as an actress.
"I don't label myself as an ethnic actress," Owen said.

"I'm very white; I can get cast in European roles."
Owen initially began her acting career in London.

She then came back to New Zealand to work in
1989, "though I'd travel everywhere for a good

script." Her next projects include a stage play in
New Zealand and an Australian feature titled,
"You're Mv Venus."

On the set of "Once Were Warriors," how
etfer, Owen's professional experience put
her in the minority. According to Owen,

only five of the cast members were
trained actors. All the rest, including the
pivotal role of Beth's daughter Grace
(16-year old Mamengaroa Kerr-Bell),

were newcomers.
"They were absolutely professional,"
Owen said. "In New Zealand, you
get a lot of talent, but it's very raw
and unrefined. The director knew
I had the technical experience and
strength to carry the part of Beth."
This rawness Owen refers to is

both the greatest strength and weakness of "Once Were
Warriors." The cast, .especially the younger members,
convey much passion and sincerity, lacking the complex
guile or technique of experienced actors.
Still, the ambitiousness of the subject matter and ap
proach in "Once Were Warriors" are impressive.
"The picture sees hope for its victims" Owen said.
"There are several themes that come out of 'Warriors':
the importance of knowing where you come from; chil
dren will always suffer at the hands of parental problems;
It often takes a tragedy before people take action."
t'd be premature to claim New Zealand the site of
the next artistic zcttgeist, the Seattle of the film
world. But the country's movie community has
produced a number of films — "Heavenly Creatures,"
"The Piano " and most recently "Once Were Warriors"—
that have been well-received by the international com
munity and markets that are increasingly friendly to
"indie" productions.
To Owen, this bodes good things for cinematic art. "I
think it shows the best films are not necessarily made by
money, but by passion." ■
