Sue's Indian Cuisine For an ab
solutely delightful dinner in an inti
mate setting, check out Sue's. The
food is not only healthy, but tasty and
pretty authentic. The thali dishes are
perfect for those with larger ap
petites. Finish off your meal with the
kulfi or gulab jamun, both of which
are considerably filling desserts.
Don't be unnerved by the rather stoic

waiters, and watch out
for horrendously long
lines on weekends. A
meal at Sue's Indian Cui
sine will run about $8-
$ 15, hut is well worth the
money. Ixxated at 216
Castro Street in Mtn.
View, Sue's is open Mon.
through Wed. from 5
p.m. to 9:30 p.m. and
Thurs. through Sat.
from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m.
969-1112.
Passage to India A
extraordinarily good
deal for the money, Pas
sage to India offers an ex-

tensive lunch buffet and enormous
portions of entrees. The decor and
the service are both basic, the restau
rant is quite a hike away from campus
and the mood music can be quite
grating at times, but these factors are
to be overlooked if you're looking for
a filling and good quality meal for less
than $8 per person. Located at 110 W.
El Camino Real in Mtn. View, Pas

sage to India is open seven days a
week from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
and 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. 964-5532.
Gaylord India Restaurant
Despite its questionable locale in
the Stanford Shopping Center,
Gaylord's offers upscale dining and
service that can't be found in any
other Indian restaurants in the
area. The restaurant offers a wide
variety of North Indian dishes, and
even a champagne brunch on Sun
days. This is a restaurant to avoid if
pretentiousness is not your thing,
but if you're out to impress with at
mosphere, style and generally tasty
food, Gaylord's might be worth the
impressive price tag. The cost of
most meals usually totals up to
about $20. Gaylord Indian Restau
rant is locatcd at 317 Stanford
Shopping Center, and is open Mon.
through Thurs. from 8:30 a.m. to
9:30 p.m. and Fri. to Sun. from 8
a.m. to 10 p.m. 368-3486.
Pasand's Madras Cuisine
The considerable drive should be of

no consequence for you to enjoy
the rare treat of a South Indian
restaurant. Pasand's offer South In
dian specialties like dosai, idli and
sambar in a comfortable atmos
phere and with courteous service.
Try the rice and rasam if you're
going for a lighter meal. They also
offer tasty snacks and side dishes
like pakoras and bondas. This
restaurant offers good, healthy
food for moderate prices, as most
meals run about $ 10- $ 12. Pasand's
Madras Cuisine is located at 3701
El Camino Real in Santa Clara, and
is open seven days a week from
11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. (408) 241-
5150.
Nataraja's This restaurant offers
a pretty good meal for the price, al
though the atmosphere can be
rather stifling at times. However,
the service is prompt and efficient,
bringing you exceptionally good
curries and tasty chicken dishes as
well. The rogan josh (lamb with
spinach) is also recommended. For
a moderately priced meal, try the

wide assortment of dishes offered
at the lunch buffet. Most meals at
Natarajas are moderately priced
between $10 and $15, although
some of the non-vegetarian dishes
are considerably more expensive.
This restaurant is located at 117
University Ave. in Palo Alto (al
though the entrance is quite ob
scure), and is open Tues. through
Sun. from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and
6 p.m. to 10 p.m. 321-6161.
Mumtaj This restaurant is the
place to be for bargain-hunting
fans of Indian cuisine. Keep the
price in mind when the wait for
dinner is long and the service is
mediocre at best. The extensive
North Indian lunch buffet might be
a better bet. Vegetarians should
look for the tasty channa (garban
zo) dishes offered at Mumtaj. This
restaurant is located at 126 Castro
St.in Mtn. View, and is open seven
days a week from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m., Sun. through Thurs. 5:30
p.m. to 10 p.m. and Fri. and Sat.
5:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. 961- 2433.
