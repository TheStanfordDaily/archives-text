Fred Savage and Dan Pintauro learn who's
the boss in an enchanted forest, re-living
their wonder years in "Waxing Poetic."
• A confused college student faces his jealousy
of his blind roommate in "Coltrane Image."
• And Stanford finally finds out what's hap
pening up in heaven, courtesy of "Solitaire?"
These are the plays that have been selling out
in Eleanor Prosser Studio since last night and run
through February 11. They are "Ram's Head
Original Winter One Acts."
An annual showcase of Stanford student tal
ent, "Winter One Acts" are written, produced
and performed by students, and usually capture
the feel of an intimate dramatic production.
"Energy, everyone, energy!"
The above line could be attributed to any of
the three directors, who at times seemed to adopt
the role of cheerleaders more than any other.
Michael Glass of "Solitaire?" is the hip son of
MTV, the kind of director that you can imagine
club-hopping with the cast after rehearsal. He is
the nurturing friend who'll be sharp and perhaps
even cruel in his criticism but then send you
flowers afterwards.
"1 fear that though I find myself walking away
from the experience enriched with its challenges
and successes, that some others connected with
the piece, especially the cast, didn't go on much

of a personal journey in bringing life to 'Soli
taire?' " Glass said.
The "Solitaire?" rehearsal had a manic fresh
ness to it, like an improv class where everyone is
the next Shirley MacLaine, having had more fun
in each of their lives than the average Joe.
Ari l.ipton, director of "Coltrane Image" has a
commanding aura to her, like the captain of a
spaceship careening through the galaxy. Her di
rections are precise and tight, praising with the
same fervor that she criticizes. She radiates a kind
of nervous energy, like a painter who can't find
herbrushesat the moment ofhighest inspiration.
"Coltrane" serves as the immediate opposite
of "Solitaire?" The text is intelligent and insight
ful, but at the same time very heavy and dark. As
the cast ran through the show in the Eleanor
Prosser Studio (which is covered by black from
the ceiling to the walls), a sense ofgloom couldn't
be broken by the occasional laughter produced
by a blooper or a missed cue.
"This is a dark play that gets darker as it goes
on. It's very surreal," she said. "I wanted to make
sure I could capture what was in the text itself."
"is this his full name? is he the director?*
Xedex, of "Waxing Poetic," with his long hair and
flashy fashion sense, comes across as a mix be
tween Zeus and an aerobics instructor. He is Pyg
malion, shaping his cast by instructing all the

movements and dance steps in a play that relies
heavily on body language. "I've gone for a lot of
fluid images. One thing goes into the next, goes
into the next, just like in nature," he said.
In the rehearsals for "Poetic," the cast seemed
to be aware that they had entered the realm of
fantasy-adventure and were now in a surreal
world. This may have induced the sense of awe
and seriousness the characterized the rehearsals.
For budding playwrights on campus, One
Acts meant their big chance to hear their words
being performed. Chekhov hopefuls took heart,
and took note: October 17 was the deadline for
script submissions to Ram's Head. (Gillis wrote
his entire play the night before.)
Beginning in September, "One Acts" produc
er Scott Roos put up fliers and made announce
ments, asking for submissions. Student play
wrights from all backgrounds sent in a total of 14
plays, read by a six-person script committee.
After discussing the plays for four hours, the
committee decided on the three that are now
being performed.
"They all have something supernatural about
them," Roos said. "Over half of the script pool
had some supernatural elements to them, so it
just happened that way."
Freshman Chad Bonaker wrote his play
"(Coltrane Image" a year ago in high school for a

writing class, and received an award at the Tel
luride Young Playwright's Festival.
Senior Michael Green wrote "Solitare?" the
summer of his sophomore year. "I was working
at a mental hospital and reading Marvel comics.
On my free time 1 was breaking up with my girl- s
friend and writing this play," Green said.
Once the plays were chosen, the producing
team held auditions for technical positions, such
as directors. The final step was auditioning actors
in a general audition as they did not try-out tor
any particular roles. Finally, the directors made
final casting decisions.
"[The directors] had to, behind the scones,
kind of give and take. I'll take her but you take
him if you give me her," explained Xedex. lhe
actors said in their audition slips which plays
they were interested in."
Roos said that these casting decisions were
based on terms of individual parts in individual
shows. "It just turned out that 'Waxing Poetic'
got the two famous people," said Roos. "1 have a
feeling Xedex wanted to work with them i Savage I
and Pintauro 1 from the beginning, so he pulled
them towards his show."
Roos expects the plays to do well. "I have a
feeling we'll sell out at least 80 percent. People ij
will walk out of the theater talking about the
show.' ■

Sean is confused and insecure, looking for
happiness and some answers. He is searching
for an identity, acceptance and love.
Sean (freshman John Ynostroza) is at the
center of "Coltrane Image," a character study
about a young man who feels that he's at a dis
advantage everywhere he looks.
"He doesn't realize that he needs to look in
side. Sean is getting bit up on his own inade
quacies, trying to find a scapegoat, blaming it
on visuals," said junior Jeff Gillis, the writer.
The visuals can be color, as in race. Sean,
who feels "culturally displaced," is deceived
into misconceptions that border on racism.
The visuals can also be sight. Sean feels over
shadowed by his flamboyant roommate
Franklin (Sean McMeekin), who is blind. At
one point,, he asks Franklin, in all seriousness,
what are the "advantages of being blind."
Franklin's blindness serves as a metaphor
j for Sean's own quest into the darkness of his
heart. Scan hungers for a human connection
at the level of consciousness, beyond physical
intimacy and visual contact.
"There aren't many walls separating
[Franklin) from other people, so Sean conjec
tures that blindness helped him do that," Gillis
said.
Franklin, though more successful than
Scan in finding his "center," is also full of inse

curities.
"One of the things 1 like about the play is
that it avoids simple generalizations about
Franklin's situation," McMeekin said. Indeed,
Franklin is neither a bitter man from Al Paci
no's "Scent of a Woman" school nor a pitiful
saint.
"I like the fact that it's a complicated play
with a lot of different emotions," said director
senior Ari Lipton, who had high praise for
McMeekin's ability to capture the physical side
of a blind person.
"I've watched several movies with blind
characters," McMeekin said. "I noticed that
the blind keep their eyes open as if they were
sighted. The challenge lies in speaking to peo
ple without looking at them or focusing on
any particular objects."
McMeekin's character served as the start
ing point for the writing of "Coltrane." Ac
cording to Gillis, he led to other characters
and many scenes and, over the course of one
night, Gillis had finished his play.
"The first time 1 read it, it reminded me a
lot of David Mamet," Lipton said. "You could
read how it sounds."
"The play explores the possibility that this
one particular blind person lives in a world
that is more honest than the one of sighted
people," she added.

ple without looking at them or focusing on
any particular objects."
McMeekin's character served as the start
ing point for the writing of "Coltrane." Ac
cording to Gillis, he led to other characters
and many scenes and, over the course of one
night, Gillis had finished his play.
"The first time 1 read it, it reminded me a
lot of David Mamet," Lipton said. "You could
read how it sounds."
"The play explores the possibility that this
one particular blind person lives in a world
that is more honest than the one of sighted
people," she added.

• A confused college student faces his jealousy

These are the plays that have been selling out
in Eleanor Prosser Studio since last night and run
through February 11. They are "Ram's Head
Original Winter One Acts."
An annual showcase of Stanford student tal
ent, "Winter One Acts" are written, produced
and performed by students, and usually capture
the feel of an intimate dramatic production.
"Energy, everyone, energy!"
The above line could be attributed to any of
the three directors, who at times seemed to adopt
the role of cheerleaders more than any other.
Michael Glass of "Solitaire?" is the hip son of
MTV, the kind of director that you can imagine
club-hopping with the cast after rehearsal. He is
the nurturing friend who'll be sharp and perhaps
even cruel in his criticism but then send you
flowers afterwards.
"1 fear that though I find myself walking away
from the experience enriched with its challenges
and successes, that some others connected with
the piece, especially the cast, didn't go on much

of a personal journey in bringing life to 'Soli
taire?' " Glass said.
The "Solitaire?" rehearsal had a manic fresh
ness to it, like an improv class where everyone is
the next Shirley MacLaine, having had more fun
in each of their lives than the average Joe.
Ari l.ipton, director of "Coltrane Image" has a
commanding aura to her, like the captain of a
spaceship careening through the galaxy. Her di
rections are precise and tight, praising with the
same fervor that she criticizes. She radiates a kind
of nervous energy, like a painter who can't find
herbrushesat the moment ofhighest inspiration.
"Coltrane" serves as the immediate opposite
of "Solitaire?" The text is intelligent and insight
ful, but at the same time very heavy and dark. As
the cast ran through the show in the Eleanor
Prosser Studio (which is covered by black from
the ceiling to the walls), a sense ofgloom couldn't
be broken by the occasional laughter produced
by a blooper or a missed cue.
"This is a dark play that gets darker as it goes
on. It's very surreal," she said. "I wanted to make
sure I could capture what was in the text itself."
"is this his full name? is he the director?*
Xedex, of "Waxing Poetic," with his long hair and
flashy fashion sense, comes across as a mix be
tween Zeus and an aerobics instructor. He is Pyg
malion, shaping his cast by instructing all the

movements and dance steps in a play that relies
heavily on body language. "I've gone for a lot of
fluid images. One thing goes into the next, goes
into the next, just like in nature," he said.
In the rehearsals for "Poetic," the cast seemed
to be aware that they had entered the realm of
fantasy-adventure and were now in a surreal
world. This may have induced the sense of awe
and seriousness the characterized the rehearsals.
For budding playwrights on campus, One
Acts meant their big chance to hear their words
being performed. Chekhov hopefuls took heart,
and took note: October 17 was the deadline for
script submissions to Ram's Head. (Gillis wrote
his entire play the night before.)
Beginning in September, "One Acts" produc
er Scott Roos put up fliers and made announce
ments, asking for submissions. Student play
wrights from all backgrounds sent in a total of 14
plays, read by a six-person script committee.
After discussing the plays for four hours, the
committee decided on the three that are now
being performed.
"They all have something supernatural about
them," Roos said. "Over half of the script pool
had some supernatural elements to them, so it
just happened that way."
Freshman Chad Bonaker wrote his play
"(Coltrane Image" a year ago in high school for a

writing class, and received an award at the Tel
luride Young Playwright's Festival.
Senior Michael Green wrote "Solitare?" the
summer of his sophomore year. "I was working
at a mental hospital and reading Marvel comics.
On my free time 1 was breaking up with my girl- s
friend and writing this play," Green said.
Once the plays were chosen, the producing
team held auditions for technical positions, such
as directors. The final step was auditioning actors
in a general audition as they did not try-out tor
any particular roles. Finally, the directors made
final casting decisions.
"[The directors] had to, behind the scones,
kind of give and take. I'll take her but you take
him if you give me her," explained Xedex. lhe
actors said in their audition slips which plays
they were interested in."
Roos said that these casting decisions were
based on terms of individual parts in individual
shows. "It just turned out that 'Waxing Poetic'
got the two famous people," said Roos. "1 have a
feeling Xedex wanted to work with them i Savage I
and Pintauro 1 from the beginning, so he pulled
them towards his show."
Roos expects the plays to do well. "I have a
feeling we'll sell out at least 80 percent. People ij
will walk out of the theater talking about the
show.' ■

Sean is confused and insecure, looking for
happiness and some answers. He is searching
for an identity, acceptance and love.
Sean (freshman John Ynostroza) is at the
center of "Coltrane Image," a character study
about a young man who feels that he's at a dis
advantage everywhere he looks.
"He doesn't realize that he needs to look in
side. Sean is getting bit up on his own inade
quacies, trying to find a scapegoat, blaming it
on visuals," said junior Jeff Gillis, the writer.
The visuals can be color, as in race. Sean,
who feels "culturally displaced," is deceived
into misconceptions that border on racism.
The visuals can also be sight. Sean feels over
shadowed by his flamboyant roommate
Franklin (Sean McMeekin), who is blind. At
one point,, he asks Franklin, in all seriousness,
what are the "advantages of being blind."
Franklin's blindness serves as a metaphor
j for Sean's own quest into the darkness of his
heart. Scan hungers for a human connection
at the level of consciousness, beyond physical
intimacy and visual contact.
"There aren't many walls separating
[Franklin) from other people, so Sean conjec
tures that blindness helped him do that," Gillis
said.
Franklin, though more successful than
Scan in finding his "center," is also full of inse

curities.
"One of the things 1 like about the play is
that it avoids simple generalizations about
Franklin's situation," McMeekin said. Indeed,
Franklin is neither a bitter man from Al Paci
no's "Scent of a Woman" school nor a pitiful
saint.
"I like the fact that it's a complicated play
with a lot of different emotions," said director
senior Ari Lipton, who had high praise for
McMeekin's ability to capture the physical side
of a blind person.
"I've watched several movies with blind
characters," McMeekin said. "I noticed that
the blind keep their eyes open as if they were
sighted. The challenge lies in speaking to peo
ple without looking at them or focusing on
any particular objects."
