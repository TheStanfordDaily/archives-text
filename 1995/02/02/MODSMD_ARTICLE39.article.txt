# ‘Waxing Poetic’
## 
### 
Two adolescent boys, played by freshmen Fred
Savage and Dan Pintauro, find themselves surround
ed by sprites, talking animals and even a singing
queen in "Waxing Poetic," the first of the three plays
being presented. It's a magical world, one where the
boundaries are not rivers but fantasies.
"My first reaction at the reading was 'Wow! This is
an exciting play,' " Pintauro said. "The messages have
become very deep, very subtle and very important,
lust the idea of the fairies and the sprites appealed to
me a lot. I've been doing boring household charac
ters, so this is really exciting."
Pintauro starred with Alyssa Milano and Tony
Danza in the long-running ABC series "Who's the
Boss?" He has been acting since age two, and ap
peared in more than 50 commercials.
Savage plays Pintauro's mentor Tommy, who is de
scribed in the play as "a boy of about 15 or 16, cynical
but always thoughtful."
"Tommy is a very intimate character as far as his re
lationship with nature and his surroundings," Savage
said. "He's very observant of all natural things and
likes to articulate what he sees in speech and poetry."
Savage, a veteran of five films and the ABC series
"The Wonder Years," performed one-act plays in Los
Angeles for the past couple of years.
His character in "Poetic," Tommy, is a budding poet
who introduces Joey to a world of poetry and close
contact with nature. Joey is the younger of the two, and
needs Tommy to teach him how to "wax poetic."
"It's a challenge to play a younger character be
cause kids tend to do things constantly," Pintauro
said. "I have to be careful to maintain that character
through the whole thing, even when I am not speak
ing." His character is described in the play as a boy of
age "11 or 12."

One of the attractions of the play is watching the
two on-campus TV personalities act together. They
were both in the same network (ABC) for years, but,
according to Savage, they didn't know each other per
sonally until this past summer, when they found they
were both attending Stanford in the fall.
"Over the summer Dan and 1 spent some time to
gether hanging out," said Savage, who chose Stanford
over Harvard in order to be closer to his family and
friends. "Our relationship in the play is as friends, so
our natural relationship carries over into it and
makes it easier to make it more real."
Of all three plays, "Poetic" is the one that uses the
most visual, sound and special effects. Because it's a
fantasy tale, and because its set in a surreal land, the
designers enjoyed great freedom to create the cos
tumes and the backdrops.
I he play is about the power of words to evoke im
agery," said director Xedex, a graduate student.
1 his is the first play written by Bonaker, whose
work often features nature imagery and an explo
ration of man's connection with his creative side.
" I he point of the play is that everybody has the
power to be creative and wax poetic," Bonaker said.
I he cast also includes Valerie Cuevas, Becky Zim
merman, Valerie Kinsey and Amanda Atwood, play
ing the airy Formless (a group of dancing fairies).
