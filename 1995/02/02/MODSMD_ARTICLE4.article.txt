## Roble sculpture garden to be completed in spring 
### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
For nearly a year now, Roble residents have had
an unfinished sculpture garden in their backyard.
But that could soon change. The New Guinea
Sculpture Garden Project could be ready for dis
play by June 1, said Tom Seligman, the director of
the Stanford Art Museum.
The uncompleted project, which entered the
planning stage four years ago and actually began
last spring, has been bogged down by problems.
One of the finished statues was stolen this past
September and the project also met with tempo
rary financial trouble.
The funding problems, said Seligman, have
been alleviated and several people expressed inter-

est in financing the rest of the
project. Most of the money that
actually paid for the garden —
nearly $280,000 — was raised
from individuals, grants, foun
dations and corporations, said
project director Jim Mason.
A sign that hangs by the
sculptures reads, "We need
$40,000 to complete this pro
ject." Mason said the project has
gotten half of it.
"We have enough to finish it
but not in the way we want to,"
he said.
All that is left in the project,
Seligman said, is to landscape
the area and add pads and
drainage.
Landscape architect Tom
Richmond, who designed the
new Palm Drive, will take on this

part of the project, Mason said.
Yesterday, Mason met with
Richmond at the site to work on
meeting the June 1 date of com
pletion.
The design of the garden
came from a collaboration of
artists and landscape designers
this summer, Mason explained.
"It is a reinterpretation of some
landscape design elements com
monly used in New Guinea, try
ing to make [people] interact
with the site," said Mason.
Currently the sculptures sit
outside Roble, covered with plas
tic. The pictures of the 10 native
Guinea artists who created the
sculptures lie in the nearby
bushes.
But Mason said the sculp
tures are fine. "It is not a prob
lem laying [the statues] out
there," Mason said.
The plastic that covers the
statues, Mason said, is "to keep
water in rather than keep rain

off," since the sculptures got too
dry during the California sum
mer.
The garden will be the first of
its kind, created by 10 sculptors
from Papua New Guinea. The
artists were hired from all parts
of New Guinea. They flew to the
United States for the first time
to work on the sculptures.
When the garden is finished,
it will house 15 sculptures of
Kwoma and Itamul origin — all
carved by hand — with axes,
knives and chisels.
There is still a $300 reward
out for information on the
whereabouts of the stolen stat
ue, Mason said. The statue is
about nine-feet long and one foot
in diameter, with two elongated
faces on each end and a woman
figure in the middle.
No charges will be pressed
and any information should be
reported to the Anthropology
Department.
