# 'Solitaire?'
## 
### 
"Solitaire?" is about Daniel Palmer
(senior Dave Barlin), a yuppie with a tal
ent for ignoring his girlfriend's feelings
and a gift for one-liners. He's a refugee
from one of those sophisticated Woody
Allen Manhattan comedies; the modern
man who lives in 34-hour days and car
ries an attache case to the bathroom.
Green's dialogue is filled with funny
witticisms and post-modern cynicism
including comic references to popular
culture (at one point Daniel describes
someone as a "dyslexic kindergarten
teacher").
Palmer, who talks like Martin Short
and thinks like Woody Allen, is visited
by an angel and given a tour of heaven.
Amidst the Paul Rudnick-type
zingers from Palmer and the Second
City-style humor emerges a subtle but
meaningful commentary 011 the need to
find out what really matters in life.
"Its message is, as tar as I can tell, and
I'm just an actor, it's none of my busi
ness to tell what the message is, it's that if
you don't enjoy life, you re wasting it,

Barlin said. "It's a fairly obvious mes
sage, but it's one people don't follow."
He added that this message is "ex
tremely applicable to Stanford. If you
look around you see all these people try
ing to win it all and they don't under
stand what they're missing."
Director freshman Michael Glass
thinks it's an important lesson for a
campus that "consistently complains
about the lack of dating."
"Green encourages the viewer to risk
it, call her,' and with this I firmly agree,"
Glass said. "It's a lesson many at Stan
ford need to learn â€” in this intellectual
atmosphere it's so easy to get caught in
one's head and find excuses, rationaliza
tions for not acting on impulse or from
emotion."
Green sees the play as an analogy
about how relationships fit into greater
goals.
"Are there greater goals? Is happiness
the end? Why should life suck? Why is
pain a good thing? These are things I
tried to touch on," he said.

"The biggest challenge of it all is that
people don't like seeing the question of
heaven addressed and believers are
shunned," he added. " It's okay it you re
gay, but if you believe in God, then I
don't wanna talk to you.'"
The play overcomes this challenge
through humor. Laughter acts as the
spoonful of sugar that helps the religion
go down.
"I think there are enough levels for
each person to walk away with some
thing distinct," Glass said.
"Some will feel the love stuff, some
(hopefully) will find it entertaining,
some will explore the, shall we say, un
orthodox view of heaven/ spirituality/
life, some will get caught up in the kiss.
But what will Glass, the director,
walk away with?
"I found that even beyond its amus
ing humor, the message of Daniel allow
ing himself to take the leap and risk
committing to Laura was well crafted.
Besides, I could probably use that lesson
too."
