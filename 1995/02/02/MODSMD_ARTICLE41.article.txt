# 'Sunrise' cute, lightweight romance
## 
### 
This flick about a one night stand in Vienna is, well,
nice. That's it. No lascivious pick-up lines. No hyper
kinky sex scenes. No iiber-breasts. No extra-wet willies.
Just sensible dialogue. And that's what makes "Before
Sunrise" such a charming endorphin rush.

Before Sunrise

Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is a goateed American armed with
a Eurail pass and riddled with Euro-boredom. When Ce
line (Julie Delpy), a luscious-lipped French student on her
return trip to Paris, sits down next to him on the train,
Jesse strikes up a conversation. They immediately hit it off.
Then, Jesse makes his move. He asks Celine to postpone
her trip to Paris and embark on a spontaneous one-day
tour of Vienna with him before he returns to the States.
She agrees. He scores. The romance begins.
Despite her disheleved appearance, Celine radiates like
a Botticelli babe with her "ethereal girl" looks, use of lyri
cal hand gestures, smooth wit and a smile that could
make a sonnet blush. Immediately, the audience is
charmed by her. However, it takes a while for the audience
to warm up to the other.
Jesse, identified by his thrift store leather jacket, sparse

facial hair and squinting eyes, looks like the dumb (and
mypoic) American pseudo-beatnik in Europe. And he
talks like one too.
With more forced optimism than an Avon lady out to
give a three-day old corpse a makeover, Jesse tells Celine:
"Sitting for weeks on end just looking at the window has
been great. Really." Jesse continues to make the audience
wonder "What the hell does Celine see in him?!?" as he
laughs at his own poor jokes, delivers some painfully forced
laughs and gives one sorry Freud impersonation. Fortu
nately, as the film progresses, Jesse gains more confidence
to just be himself and gradually sheds his social blemishes.
Director Richard Linklater ("Slacker," "Dazed and
Confused") follows the couple as they wander in Vienna.
For 24 hours, Jesse and Celine paint the town fuschia. We
see the grungy couple go cafe hopping, joke, thumb
through vinyl in a record shop, visit a cemetery, flirt, pon
tificate, bicker, get their palms read and go ga-ga for each
other. We hear them confess their childhood memories,
their fear of finitude and — right before their imminent
separation — their intense desire for one another.
"Before Sunrise" is a tender exposition of how a
chance encounter blossoms into romance. It is a humble
relationship flick that, fortunately, lacks gut-wrenching
melodrama and air-brushed glamour. Rather, it is thick
with honesty... like a near-life experience.
