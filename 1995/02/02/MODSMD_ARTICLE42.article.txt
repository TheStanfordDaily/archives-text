# MURDER IN THE FIRST
## Brilliant performers can't save trite plot from quick death 
### 
Alcatraz. We all know it as a
major tourist attraction in San
Francisco, but less than 30 years
ago it was home to the meanest,
toughest cons in the country. Based
on the true story of Henry Young
(Kevin Bacon), an inmate at Alca
traz who suffered horrific tortures
at the hands of the prison system,
Marc Rocco's "Murder in the First"
is a half-hearted attempt at a court
room drama. The film intends to
shock and provoke, but ultimately
it founders under the cliched ban
ner of "Justice shall prevail."
"Murder" could have succeeded
had the script been less trite and
less predictable. Youngs story is
tragic and compelling, but cheap
platitudes like, "I don't need a

lawyer. 1 need a friend" are distract
ing. After spending three years in
solitary confinement, Young goes
nuts in the mess hall and slits the
throat of a fellow prisoner with a
spoon in front of 200 witnesses. It
then seems inappropriate to por-

Murder in the First

tray the man as a mushy sentimen
talist.
The actors turn in mediocre per
formances, except for Bacon who is
absolutely brilliant. Christian
Slater unconvincingly portrays
Young's lawyer, James Stamphill.
Stamphill is supposed to be a young
firebrand from Harvard Law

School, yet Slater doesn't seem par
ticularly clever or commanding in
the courtroom.
"Murder" tries to achieve the in
tensity of the Tom Cruise-Jack
Nicholson confrontation in "A Few
Good Men," but doesn't quite make
it. In the scene that pits Stamphill
against the evil Associate Warden
Glenn (Gary Oldman), Oldman
ends up shouting and getting red in
the face while Slater's voice just gets
squeakier and starts to crack.
"Murder in the First" lacks the
chemistry and tension needed to
make the film work. The nauseat
ing scenes of brutality leave the the
ater with you, but there is not much
else to be remembered.
