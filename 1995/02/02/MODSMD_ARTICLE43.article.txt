## 'Queen Margot': fireworks and a French royal family 
### 
"A wedding and a war.. .
that'll fix France!"
Six thousand Protestant
corpses later — after the Saint
Bartholomew's Day massacre
of 1572 — the prophetic senti
ment articulated in the initial
stages of "Queen Margot"
must have sent a distinct chill
down any spine. At times bru
tal, occasionally poignant, but

Queen Margot

never at any point more than a
heartbeat away from its willful
streak of romanticism, Patrice
Chereau's film is further testi
mony to the French Hair for
the sweeping period epic.
Unlike Hollywood counter
parts — "1492: Conquest of
Paradise," "The Last of the
Mohicans," — which are
grievously long on hushed
canonization hut short on re
visionist mischief, no cultural
icon in French history is be
yond a healthy dose of devil
may-care deconstruction.
Adapting from Alexandre
Dumas' novel, Chereau comes
up with a fabulous assortment
of wicked perversions for his
aristocratic players; Oedipal
overtones (Catherine de
Medicis and son Anjou),
anonymous sex (Margot and
La Mole), voyeuristic games
(Duchess Henrietta), and sib
ling incest (King Charles and
sister Margot) all vie for time,
space and participants in the
Charles IX court.
Sexual polymorphism thus
aptly serves as a metaphor for a
humanity of endless contra
dictions and fleeting loyalties:
simply, life is never merely
straight and narrow.
Indeed, the most fascinat
ing relationship in the 150-
minute existentialist soap
opera is the never torrid, but
ultimately conventionally
structured liaison between
Margot (Isabelle Adjani) and
her lover La Mdle (Vincent
Perez). The pre-arranged po
litical marriage between
Catholic Margot and Protes
tant Henri de Navarre (Daniel
Auteuil) is never about love in
traditional terms, yet a basic

decency — unfazed by adul
tery on both sides and blood
soaked family strife — per
vades to entrench the pair in
mutual loyalty.
As Margot, Adjani is at once
the film's asset and its liability.
Which other face in cinema
can haunt the screen with such
ethereal flaw less ness? But
when that face needs to be
contorted to convey a more
complex nuance Adjani stum
bles, particularly during the
death-bed scene with the poi
soned King Charles (lean-
Hughes Anglade). As the inef
fectual and tormented pawn of
the king's mother — the evil

overrated Virna Lisi) — the
usually superb Anglade turns
in an unpredictable and mov
ing interpretation of Charles
IX's complex psyche.
Gutsy, bawdy and always
pulsating with life — thanks to
the energetic cinematography
of Oscar-winning Philippe
Roussellot — this is one undead
retelling of history which may
catch the uninitiated off guard.
One may choose to take of
fense at the film's liberties with

factual ac
curacy and
frequently
gory depic
tions of
physical and
political vi
olence. Or
one can be
very grateful
to the
French.
