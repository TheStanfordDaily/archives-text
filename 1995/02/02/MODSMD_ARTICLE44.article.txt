# Bettie Seveert — a slacker with feelings
## Arnold Pan

It's all too easy to reduce Amsterdam's
Bettie Serveert to just another trendy alt
rock caricature, into a cartoon starring a
goofy group of laid-back foreigners who
lifted a name from a tennis instruction
manual and make slacker songs in funny
English. Throw in those references to hash,

"Lamprey"
Bettie Seveert

grunge rock and Pavement's "Slanted and
Enchanted" that seem to surface in any fea
ture on the quartet and it's enough to mar
ginalize this next band-on-the-verge-of-a
breakthrough.
But what paints a pretty picture isn't all

that has gotten the Dutch hunch noticed.
Rather, the band's brand of lazy, hazy gui
tar-pop and emotion-drained vocals are the
virtues which earned them the attention in
the first place. So while Generation Con
fused doofuses like Green Day and Off
spring revel in slackerdom and clever
smart-asses like Pavement and Superchunk
play off it, Bettie Servecrt gets to the heart of
the matter and explodes the don't-give-a
damn myth because slackers (if you choose
to call Bettie Servecrt that) have feelings too.
"Lamprey" sounds the way warm, knot
ted insides feel, a poignant and moody col
lection of songs which lurch anxiously and
cascade in calm. Like its predecessor — the
band's achingly pretty debut, "Palomine" —
the new record sweeps with the gray strokes
which distinguished Bettie Servecrt from the
power-pop crowd. But this time around,
these thirtysomethine Dutch rockers hit

with punchier hooks
that couple nicely with their hypnotic lull.
The album's first cut, "Keep Sake," is all
that and more. Peter Visser's and Carol Van
Dijk's guitars whine and crawl their way to a
riffy refrain that skips as it marches, blurry
and tight. Van Dijk's melancholy vocals cap
ture "so many moods," as she sings in the
song, triggered by fleeting yet vivid images.
When Van Dijk croons about the "smell of
falling rain," it's one of those lyrics that you
can't get rid of, setting a perfectly cloudy at
mosphere for the tune. All the while, the
crashing rhythms of bassist Herman Bun
skoeke and drummer Berend Dubbe come
in a downpour.
Their affecting sap-pop hits fast and fu
rious, as "Keep Sake" is followed up by "Ray
Ray Rain," a gem of a ditty that counter
parts Buffalo Tom and the Lemonheads
should've written but never could. On

"Cybor*D"and "Re-
Feel-It," the group
bounces and moves

without catching its breath, licking and
chopping its way with incessant melody.
"Tell Me, Sad" builds up the downcast pitch
in its swampy pace as Van Dijk's careening
voice climbs out of the muck only to settle
back in it; the forceful "Crutches" looks for
solace in the "boredom (that] always lurks
within strange places" and finds some be
cause there's still "a way to feed [one's]
mind."
If there's a point to "Lamprey," it's to be
resourceful and independent, to not "be
lieve every word that they say" but to trust
that the self can set things straight. As Van
Dijk puts it on "D. Feathers," "If the whole
world should drop dead, I'll build my own
inside my head."
