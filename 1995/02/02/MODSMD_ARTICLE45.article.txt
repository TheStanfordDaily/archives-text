# Sucky movie, but good soundtrack

Movies and their soundtracks. They once
were inseparable, committed to the other's
successes and failures. They pledged to be
there for one another, in box office sickness
and health. Eventually, these bonds began to
crumble, and rebellious movie soundtracks
took on a life of their own. A pioneer in this
multi-media melodrama was "The Body
guard" soundtrack, which sold in excess of 15

"Street Fighter II Soundtrack"
various artists

million copies, largely on the strength of
Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You".
" 'The Bodyguard' ... a movie?" you may
say. Case in point.
For those of you who are facing frustra
tion/boredom with Sega's video game ver
sion of physical combat and brutality, the
"Street Fighter" movie doesn't provide much
diversion. The soundtrack's rap theme seems
appropriate enough — rugged beats and
rhymes to complement scenes of fierce hand
to-hand combat wonderfully.
Unfortunately, the movie does little to

= only if it's free

= a can't-miss

= if you've got the money to spare

= certainly worth your while

capitalize on this connection, leaving most of
the tracks on the soundtrack unplayed. The
volume of those songs that are lucky enough
to accompany action scenes is shamefully
low, as if the director wants the songs to go
unnoticed. A movie that has been rated
mediocre by many critics could have been
decent with the addition of the soundtrack's
brilliantly refreshing hip-hop flavor.
The "Street Fighter" album is loaded
with rap's heavyweights, big names like L.L.
Cool J, Ice Cube, Craig Mack, Public Enemy
and Nas. Long-time rap fans will appreciate
the return ofdormant rappers Paris and The
Pharcyde as well as the introduction of fresh
waxmen The B.U.M.S. and Wreck League.
The biggest attention grabber on the
soundtrack is the duo of Hammer and Deion
Sanders (yes, Deion Sanders), whose upbeat
club jam, "Straight To My Feet", hasn't seen
much light in popular music circles. Possibly
the most exciting cut to come off of this
soundtrack is "Come Widdit," a free-for-all
by three of the Bay Area's most venerable
rhymers: Ahmad, Ras Kass, and Saafir, who
have united their lyrical abilities to create a
hip-hop classic.
Those who feel cheated by "Street Fighter" s
lack of spark in the box office may find relief
in the soundtrack's collec-

tion of rap's greats. "Street
Fighter" s multi-media ex
plosion has produced a
soundtrack of a new breed
— powerful, popular, and
completely rebellious.
"Street Fighter," the
movie?"

Ifyou liked "Very," you'll like "Disco 2". In
the usual Pet Shop Boys' style of "Introspec
tive" and "Relentless," "Disco 2" provides a
non-stop dance mix of the songs from their
latest album "Very." The album includes sev
eral mixes of the dance hit "Yesterday, When
I was Mad," and the mildly successful "I
Wouldn't Normally Do This Kind of Thing."
Regrettably, the only mix of the biggest hit off

"Disco 2"
Pet Shop Boys

"Very," "Can You Forgive Her " is almost
identical to the one off the CD single.
The mixes contain elements of various
electronic styles. The 12" mix of "Libera
tion" (which is much more appealing than
the album version), is one of the few times
that the Pet Shop Boys synthesize rap and
soul vocals with their distinctive electronic
style. At times, parts of the banging bass
drums of London hard-core enter and the
music remains purely electronic.
In most mixes, the distinctive FSB vocals

remain secondary to the music mixes. For
example, in a mix of the past top-ten hit "So
Hard," the vocals are totally removed.
The album presents two virtually un
known songs, "Absolutely Fabulous" and
"We All Feel Better in the Dark." "Absolutely
Fabulous" puts a new spin on the vocals of "I
Wouldn't Normally do this Kind Of Thing."
"We All Feel Better in the Dark" repre
sents a new style for the Pet Shop Boys. A
slow, heavy bass mixed with electronic piano
and violin provides an extremely smooth
and soothing sound.
"Disco 2" is not as memorable as "Intro
spective" but for obvious reasons. "Introspec-

tive" featured remixes of
worldwide hits such as
"Domino Dancing,"
"Left to My Own De
vices," "Always on My
Mind" and "It's Alright"
while "Disco 2" features
only mildly successful
songs. However, dedi
cated fans of the PSB
will not be disappoint
ed. They still know how
to mix up a storm.
