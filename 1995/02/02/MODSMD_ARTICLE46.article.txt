"Long Way to Heaven'
Cisco Poison

Why would a really good band name
themselves Cisco Poison? Who knows. No
one in the band is named Cisco and the word
isn't even in the dictionary. But with this
music, no catchy name is required.
The key to this new band is frontman Joe
Wood. The ex-T.S.O.L. vocalist gives this
group the edge of musical experience and re
flection that most new bands lack. His style
is aggressive, yet mature. He is no longer an
angst-ridden punk, but a man who knows

"The Trance of Seven Colors'
Ghania and Pharoah Sanders

Like previous endeavors of
artists such as John McLaughlin
with Shakti or Miles Davis in "On
the Corner," avant-garde jazz sax
ist Pharoah Sanders and Gnawa
master Maleem Mahoud Ghania
fuse Western and non-Western
music to create "The Trance of
Seven Colors."
Sanders, famous for his heavy
use of multiphonics — a tech
nique of blowing through an in
strument to produce several tones
— describes this undertaking:
"When I heard the [Gnawa]
music, I could hear Charlie Parker,
I could hear John Coltrane and I
started thinking, well, if that's hap
pening, then I need to just play
that kind of music."
The difficulty with fusion pro
jects such as Sanders and Ghania
have created lies in identifying
whether the two musical tradi
tions, despite their foreigness to
each other, work. Slap together a
production like "The Trance of
Seven Colors" and the assessment
may be that the multicultural,
world-beat groove sounds com

blue-collar life and the everyday troubles of
the world.
The focus of Cisco Poison's debut disc
"It's a Long Way to Heaven" is social critique,
but unlike during their punk earlier days, it
is now more profound than youthful shout
ing. Tracks like "Save One For Me" and "Lil
lian" speak candidly about difficult times
more from the perspective of a young parent
than of an "up yours!" teen.
The first track is about inner-city random
violence, and the second is about child
abuse. But don't worry. Though mature,
Cisco Poison still packs a serious punch.
Musically, the band unites to create a
soulful recipe of rock, punk and blues.

background) can easily discern
what's going on.
That is to say, Sanders and Gha
nia may garner praise simply be
cause their collaboration is a musi
cally reputable cause: the linking
of Sanders' free-jazz / blues with a
historical predecessor — ceremo
nial music of spiritual healers of
West African Fulani and Bambara
tribes. The result is a return to
one's roots, marked by a marriage
of sounds whose spiritual dimen
sion lies on the same plane.
However, past the point of po
litical judgment of the musical at
tractiveness of "The Trance of
Seven Colors," one must remem
ber that this album headlines
Maleem Mahoud Ghania — it is
not Pharoah Sanders with Maleem
Mahmoud Ghania. When Sanders
plays, his saxaphone stands out
above the Gnawa chorus, but does
not necessarily lead each selection.
Sanders' performance is made
fuller by the context — within the
melodic wailing and chants and
polyrhythmic percussion of Gha
nia resides a place for Sanders' deft
yet chaotic playing.

OK, the holiday season is over and you never got those Su
perbowl tickets you were hoping for. Don't despair though,
because ESPN's newly compiled CD entitled "Jock Rock" is
the next best thing to actually being at the game. The thrill of
popular sports songs and even the recorded roars of the crowd,
although somewhat repetitive at times, still manage to over
come the disappoint of not really being at the sporting event
of your dreams.
Composed of the "greatest crowd-rockin' sports anthems
of all time," and including such hits as Gary Glitter's "The
Hey Song," and Steppenwolf's "Born to Be Wild," every
sports fan who listens to "Jock Rock" will immediately be
transported to the center of the action. In addition, the crowd
cheers interspersed throughout the CD insure the "virtual re
ality" experience.
The CD aptly begins with the proudly sung last words of the

"Drag Me Down"

Drummer Johnny Minguez even sits in on
sessions with blues bands like The Delta
Ramblers and the Rhythm Lords. And if any
one thinks Wood can't sing this style, check
out T.S.O.L.'s classic "Hit and Run." Tracks
like "big black Cadillac" and "26 Forever"
don't just have a sorrowful side, they have
soul.
The first four tracks of the album pull you
into its style like a prize fisherman reeling in
the big one. With the mysterious edge of
Queensryche, the underlying anger of
T.S.O.L. and soul of Stevie Ray Vaughn,
Cisco Poison makes you want to crank up
the volume and groove, groove, groove.
Unlike in some punk, all the tracks on

They're angry, they're wounded and they
want to share their cynicism with you. Together,
God Lives Underwater delves into the depths of
stinging musical fury. Their self-titled debut EP
is a veritable fisticuffs on your ears and on your
soul.

psychiatric help required by Trent Rc/.nor or
Skinny Puppy but instead comes across in his

national anthem, emphasizing America's ongoing preoccu
pation with sports, and charges right into perhaps the most
popular sports song, Queen's "We Will Rock You." The horns
and cheers of excited hockey fans are heard in the back
ground. It feels so real you can almost see the players taking
the ice.
Unlike traditional CDs, several of the songs presented on
"Jock Rock" were recorded during live sports events. The addi
tional crowd noise adds a new dimension to such songs as lames
Brown's "I Feel Good," seemingly transforming the song into a
crowd bleacher dance. Other songs, such as the Isley Brothers'
"Shout" fittingly remain intact in their original forms.
The CD closes with Steam's ever-popular "Na, Na, Hey,
Hey, Kiss Him Goodbye" followed by ESPN's marketed
"Sportscenter Theme."
When listening to the album, I felt like I'd just sat through
another intense sports game, complete with the calls of a hot
dog vendor. My disappointment at not actually being at a
game, however, was diminished when I realized that perhaps
the true reason 1 love sports is because of the songs that ac

"It's a Long Way to Heaven" evolve. They are
slow when they need to be and assault when
the message demands.
The finest tracks of this album are "Lil
lian," "Gun in My Mouth," "Livin' on Death
Row" and "Save One for Me." Musically
haunting and meaty, they don't leave you
hanging. With a blend of rock, acoustic gui
tar, cymbal-heavy percussion and the oh-so
delightful John-Lee-Hooker-trapped-in-a
white-man's-body vocal style of Wood, these
songs, like the album as a whole, show a bal
ance of style and aggression.
In the words of Minguez, this is just a
band of punkers "startin' to feel the blues."

own bleak wit.
"Drag Me Down" opens the album nicely by
subjecting the listener to verbal abuse such as,
"You don't know me/ Think you can judge me/
Budge me rape rue/ Love me." Turzo, McGee
and Kary glue it all together with seething gui
tar and drums. A bit of bittersweetness or per

Reilly produces a sort of Stone-Temple-Pi- |

"Try," reaches for unattainable ecstasy through
distorted rhythm guitar that pushes the song out
of the comfort envelope and into the pain zone.
