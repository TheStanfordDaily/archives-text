"Niandra Ladies
John Frusciante

Few people can sing "in your pussy I am
cumming/ and I love you" and still make it
sound like a sincere love song. But John Frus
ciante accomplishes this colossal task on the
opening track of "Niandra Lades and Usually
lust a T-Shirt."
Quitting the coveted post as Red Hot Chili
Peppers' geetarist at the peak of the band's
popularity, Frusciante spends his post-rock
superstar days painting, being a lover (the CD
sleeve boldly reads "For Toni, Lovingly"), and
prolificaliy writing his own music.

"The Long Black Veil"
The Chieftains

Irish folk musicians The Chieftains' latest
album, "The Long Black Veil," celebrates
their knowledge of ancestral Irish music and
their ability to incorporate it with modern al
ternative music to create an ethereal new
sound that features a variety of guest per
formers including Sting and Sinead O'Con

"Speak the Truth"
The Mighty Diamonds

After more than 20 years of circulating ex
clusively in the reggae scene, The Mighty Dia
monds continue to produce mediocre albums
and their latest, "Speak the Truth," is no excep
tion.

"Walking on a Wire"
Lowen and Navarro

"Niandra Lades" is a collection of 24 mellow,
acoustic guitar-based tracks that e deliberate
ly lack any Flea-infested phunk bass. Howev
er, please don't let the album's Unpluggedness
fool you into thinking that Frusciante has
somehow transformed from his stint as a
sock-wearing, naked Pepper into some James
Taylor folk clone.
Combining the fiery passion of soulful gui
tar playing (think Paco de Lucia or the Voodoo
Chile) with the fierceness of a really strained
voice (think Axl Rose), Frusciante remains
tough even in this mostly acoustic setting.
The album's breathiness is rare in an age of
digital perfection. With unmasked mistakes of
guitar dropping, mike hissing, and even note
missing, my CD copy of "Niandra Lades"
sounds more like a cassette tape fresh out of
Frusciante's four-track machine than a stu-

describes the musical tradition and history of
the Chieftains. After 31 albums and as many
years spent together as a band, the Chieftains
have performed their beautiful renditions of
traditional Irish folk music literally all over the
world including New York, Japan, Canada,
and China. They have also taken the stage with
a wide variety of mainstream musical artists.
"The Long Black Veil" 's first track, "Mo
Chile Mear — 'Our Hero' " featuring guest
performer Sting, reconstructs an 18th-centu
ry Irish Jacobite song. It commemorates tra
ditional Irish music and resounds of honor
and loss. Sting, taking time off from his cus
tomary modern rock songs, once again
proves his ability as a singer.

Granted, reggae is a difficult genre to tran
scend a very specific audience. Yet the more
outstanding artists like Bob Marley and ÜB4O
have risen to the challenge, achieving cross
chart hits. Unfortunately, Bunny Diamond's
vision is built not on rock-solid talent, but
rather the shifting sands.
This trio's cheerful drumming rhythms
manage to communicate the spirit of the Ja
maican beaches from which they originate,
making the music alone enjoyable for its sim
ple, carefree nature. However, the correspond-

The spicy guitar pickings spring
from the speakers. Jilting the beat,
the syncopation bumps out the lyrics
that recount serious and silly stories
on Lowen and Navarro's re-released
album , "Walking on a Wire."
Originally, Eric Lowen and Dan
Navarro were songwriters for other
big names but more recently have
found stardom singing their own
songs.
Loaded with description, the
lyrics bounce puns and colloqui
alisms to tell their stories. "Black
stripes on the pavement/ White
knuckles on the wheel," "Black lines
on the postcard/ Red alert on the
way," and my favorite "Black label
on the rocks please/ I own this red
Naugahvde stool" create images re
alized with brilliant mention of
sharp color in "C'est la Vie."

Spinning webs of double mean
ing, Lowen and Navarro drop the
pun of "rapt" and "wrapped" in
"Rapt in You." Words like "ties,"
"caught up" and "bound" in the re
frain and confused with multiple
connotations. One-liners of oddly
coupled words and images pop out
in "What 1 Make Myself Believe" —
"You can let sadness be your mag
net/ Or hope be your masterpiece."
The lyrics, not the only highlight
of this album, fit into the grooves of
the thick acoustic guitar strums
echoed by the cello which classify
the music as folk rock. An empty
reggae drum beat pushes some
songs while others follow that of a
hollow Congo drum. On top of
these instruments, Lowen and
Navarro switch off singing lead,
oddly complimenting each other.
Ingeniously coupled, the lyrics
and melody combine to spin
Lowen and Navarro a two-time re
lease. "Walking on a Wire" is back
by popular demand — the reasons
are obvious.

dio-prepared piece.
While some of "Niandra Lades" echoes of
"Breaking the Girl" and "Under the Bridge,"
most of the songs sound completely novel.
With space blues, Irish folk ballads (with the
fiddle simulated by a guitar track played hack
wards), bitter songs about alterna-success
("Blood on My Neck from Success"), Tori

"Niandra Lades" is a brave output from a
talented, often misunderstood (listen to "Been

whole unstructured, free-form album. But
when you do, each listening reveals something
new and truly exciting.

Chieftains' 31st album or because of their

"The Long Black Veil" should be celebrated

combined both traditional and modern
music to create a rare new sound that is both

ing simple lyrics quickly exhaust the listener's
patience, parroting themselves again and again
as The Diamonds remind us that the world
needs more peace, love and justice.
This unoriginality in lyrics infects the con
tent of the songs to the extent that some are sus
piciously similar to the work of other musi
cians. For instance, "Corrupt Cop" bears a
striking resemblance to the TV-show "COPS"'s
theme-song "Bad Boys," and"The Things You
Do" recalls ÜB4o's cover of "The Way You Do
The Things You Do."

"Balance"
Van Halen

The hair is gone.
Alter years with the long and curly hair
stereotypical of hard rock guitarists, Edward
Van Halen now sports a short-top and goatee.
One might then expect "Balance," Van Halen's
tenth studio album, to also be a departure
from their past — indeed that is partially true.
The group's first truly "grown-up"' album,
"Balance" takes a mature stance, both musi
cally and thematically. Originally, Van Halen
made a living out of immaturity. "Van Halen"
was the perfect example of an aggressive,
crude band showing off by playing exhilarat
ing music.
Years later, they produced two masterpieces
of hard rock," 1984" and "5150." Ragged at the
edges, the albums nevertheless rocked fero
ciously with style.
Lately, however, the group has suffered a
type of mid-life crisis. "OU812" was far too
polished and bland, and"For Unlawful Carnal
Knowledge" was an only partially successful
attempt to recapture the spirit of Van Halen.
Thus, "Balance" is a huge step forward. The
songwriting is much more melodic and cre
ative. Gone are the obligatory guitar gymnas
tics. Only on "Feelin'" does Eddie Van Halen
offer us a drop-dead solo.
Instead, the music matches the song .
Eddie's guitar can be beautiful, powerful, ugly,
and lyrical, but only when it should be.
Sammy Hagar's singing is also a consider
able improvement over previous efforts.
Rather than belting out his usually random
melody and dynamics, he works with the
song. On "Big, Fat Money," for example, he
adopts a style similar to CCR's "Travelin
Band."Exemplifying their new flexibility,
Eddie plays jazz guitar as his solo for the song.
The lyrics also present some interesting
tensions. The most developed question con
cerns religion and redemption. In"The Sev
enth Seal," the band adopts a very pro-Christ
ian attitude. In fact, if it wasn't for the musi
cality of the song, Van Halen could easily be
mistaken for a Christian rock group. "Drown
my faith in trinity,"the lyrics announce.
However, "Don't Tell Me (What Love Can
Do)" questions redemption: "1 can take the
fa 11... Don't stop the setting sun on my/ King
dom come... Is it right to take the easy way...
If I'm wrong, then I'll pay for it." On previous
albums, Van Halen toyed with religion, but
only here are two distinct stands taken on the
issue.
Just as Eddie has shaved off his old hair for
a different look, the band has shed off some
old excesses to create a different sound, one
which, so far, proves worthy of Van Halen.
— Sorcri Johnson

The poorly chosen title track, "Speak the
Truth," competes with "Hey Mommy" for
worst song on the album. Each has its own key
phrase — the title — around which the rest of
the song revolves, and neither delivers its mes
sage in a remotely sophisticated or clever way.
For mindless listening, this album fits the
bill. But for anyone else, the constant repetition
of the same words and the same rhythms will
ultimately create the sense that one is listening
to the same song over and over.

"The Long Black Veil"
The Chieftains

Irish folk musicians The Chieftains' latest

their knowledge of ancestral Irish music and

"Speak the Truth"
The Mighty Diamonds

After more than 20 years of circulating ex
clusively in the reggae scene, The Mighty Dia
monds continue to produce mediocre albums
and their latest, "Speak the Truth," is no excep
tion.

"Walking on a Wire"
Lowen and Navarro

"Niandra Lades" is a collection of 24 mellow,
acoustic guitar-based tracks that e deliberate
ly lack any Flea-infested phunk bass. Howev
er, please don't let the album's Unpluggedness
fool you into thinking that Frusciante has
somehow transformed from his stint as a
sock-wearing, naked Pepper into some James
Taylor folk clone.
Combining the fiery passion of soulful gui
tar playing (think Paco de Lucia or the Voodoo
Chile) with the fierceness of a really strained
voice (think Axl Rose), Frusciante remains
tough even in this mostly acoustic setting.
The album's breathiness is rare in an age of
digital perfection. With unmasked mistakes of
guitar dropping, mike hissing, and even note
missing, my CD copy of "Niandra Lades"
sounds more like a cassette tape fresh out of
Frusciante's four-track machine than a stu-

describes the musical tradition and history of
the Chieftains. After 31 albums and as many
years spent together as a band, the Chieftains
have performed their beautiful renditions of
traditional Irish folk music literally all over the
world including New York, Japan, Canada,
and China. They have also taken the stage with
a wide variety of mainstream musical artists.
"The Long Black Veil" 's first track, "Mo
Chile Mear — 'Our Hero' " featuring guest
performer Sting, reconstructs an 18th-centu
ry Irish Jacobite song. It commemorates tra
ditional Irish music and resounds of honor
and loss. Sting, taking time off from his cus
tomary modern rock songs, once again
proves his ability as a singer.

Granted, reggae is a difficult genre to tran
scend a very specific audience. Yet the more
outstanding artists like Bob Marley and ÜB4O
have risen to the challenge, achieving cross
chart hits. Unfortunately, Bunny Diamond's
vision is built not on rock-solid talent, but
rather the shifting sands.
This trio's cheerful drumming rhythms
manage to communicate the spirit of the Ja
maican beaches from which they originate,
making the music alone enjoyable for its sim
ple, carefree nature. However, the correspond-

The spicy guitar pickings spring
from the speakers. Jilting the beat,
the syncopation bumps out the lyrics
that recount serious and silly stories
on Lowen and Navarro's re-released
album , "Walking on a Wire."
Originally, Eric Lowen and Dan
Navarro were songwriters for other
big names but more recently have
found stardom singing their own
songs.
Loaded with description, the
lyrics bounce puns and colloqui
alisms to tell their stories. "Black
stripes on the pavement/ White
knuckles on the wheel," "Black lines
on the postcard/ Red alert on the
way," and my favorite "Black label
on the rocks please/ I own this red
Naugahvde stool" create images re
alized with brilliant mention of
sharp color in "C'est la Vie."

Spinning webs of double mean
ing, Lowen and Navarro drop the
pun of "rapt" and "wrapped" in
"Rapt in You." Words like "ties,"
"caught up" and "bound" in the re
frain and confused with multiple
connotations. One-liners of oddly
coupled words and images pop out
in "What 1 Make Myself Believe" —
"You can let sadness be your mag
net/ Or hope be your masterpiece."
The lyrics, not the only highlight
of this album, fit into the grooves of
the thick acoustic guitar strums
echoed by the cello which classify
the music as folk rock. An empty
reggae drum beat pushes some
songs while others follow that of a
hollow Congo drum. On top of
these instruments, Lowen and
Navarro switch off singing lead,
oddly complimenting each other.
Ingeniously coupled, the lyrics
and melody combine to spin
Lowen and Navarro a two-time re
lease. "Walking on a Wire" is back
by popular demand — the reasons
are obvious.

dio-prepared piece.
While some of "Niandra Lades" echoes of
"Breaking the Girl" and "Under the Bridge,"
most of the songs sound completely novel.
With space blues, Irish folk ballads (with the
fiddle simulated by a guitar track played hack
wards), bitter songs about alterna-success
("Blood on My Neck from Success"), Tori

"Niandra Lades" is a brave output from a

when you do, each listening reveals something

Chieftains' 31st album or because of their

"The Long Black Veil" should be celebrated
because The Chieftains have successfully
combined both traditional and modern
music to create a rare new sound that is both

ing simple lyrics quickly exhaust the listener's
patience, parroting themselves again and again
as The Diamonds remind us that the world
needs more peace, love and justice.
This unoriginality in lyrics infects the con
tent of the songs to the extent that some are sus
piciously similar to the work of other musi
cians. For instance, "Corrupt Cop" bears a
striking resemblance to the TV-show "COPS"'s
theme-song "Bad Boys," and"The Things You
Do" recalls ÜB4o's cover of "The Way You Do
The Things You Do."

"Balance"
Van Halen

The hair is gone.
Alter years with the long and curly hair
stereotypical of hard rock guitarists, Edward
Van Halen now sports a short-top and goatee.
One might then expect "Balance," Van Halen's
tenth studio album, to also be a departure
from their past — indeed that is partially true.
The group's first truly "grown-up"' album,
"Balance" takes a mature stance, both musi
cally and thematically. Originally, Van Halen
made a living out of immaturity. "Van Halen"
was the perfect example of an aggressive,
crude band showing off by playing exhilarat
ing music.
Years later, they produced two masterpieces
of hard rock," 1984" and "5150." Ragged at the
edges, the albums nevertheless rocked fero
ciously with style.
Lately, however, the group has suffered a
type of mid-life crisis. "OU812" was far too
polished and bland, and"For Unlawful Carnal
Knowledge" was an only partially successful
attempt to recapture the spirit of Van Halen.
Thus, "Balance" is a huge step forward. The
songwriting is much more melodic and cre
ative. Gone are the obligatory guitar gymnas
tics. Only on "Feelin'" does Eddie Van Halen
offer us a drop-dead solo.
Instead, the music matches the song .
Eddie's guitar can be beautiful, powerful, ugly,
and lyrical, but only when it should be.
Sammy Hagar's singing is also a consider
able improvement over previous efforts.
Rather than belting out his usually random
melody and dynamics, he works with the
song. On "Big, Fat Money," for example, he
adopts a style similar to CCR's "Travelin
Band."Exemplifying their new flexibility,
Eddie plays jazz guitar as his solo for the song.
The lyrics also present some interesting
tensions. The most developed question con
cerns religion and redemption. In"The Sev
enth Seal," the band adopts a very pro-Christ
ian attitude. In fact, if it wasn't for the musi
cality of the song, Van Halen could easily be
mistaken for a Christian rock group. "Drown
my faith in trinity,"the lyrics announce.
However, "Don't Tell Me (What Love Can
Do)" questions redemption: "1 can take the
fa 11... Don't stop the setting sun on my/ King
dom come... Is it right to take the easy way...
If I'm wrong, then I'll pay for it." On previous
albums, Van Halen toyed with religion, but
only here are two distinct stands taken on the
issue.
Just as Eddie has shaved off his old hair for
a different look, the band has shed off some
old excesses to create a different sound, one
which, so far, proves worthy of Van Halen.
— Sorcri Johnson

The poorly chosen title track, "Speak the
Truth," competes with "Hey Mommy" for
worst song on the album. Each has its own key
phrase — the title — around which the rest of
the song revolves, and neither delivers its mes
sage in a remotely sophisticated or clever way.
For mindless listening, this album fits the
bill. But for anyone else, the constant repetition
of the same words and the same rhythms will
ultimately create the sense that one is listening
to the same song over and over.
