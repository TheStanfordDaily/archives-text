Bad Company
"Bad Company" is a bad movie that
ostensibly tries to furnish us with a
semi-apocalyptic picture of a post
cold war world in which private in
dustry dominates and motivates in
dividuals to use corruption to pro
mote self-interest...
This summation undoubtedly gives
more credit to this Damian Harris
creation than is warranted. Arguably,
Harris never manages to come any
where close to that effort. "Bad Com
pany," co-starring Laurence Fish
burne and Ellen Barkin, unravels so
unconvincingly that this near-apoca
lyptic vision is entirely diluted.
Death and the Maiden
Nothing attempted by Roman

Polanski in recent memory — "Fran
tic," "Bitter Moon" — quite prepares
one for the sheer suspense-ridden
mastery of his latest film "Death and
the Maiden." Artfully tempered with
the psychology of human conflict
and provocative questions about the
delivery of justice, the adaptation of
Chilean Ariel Dorfman's heralded
play starring Sigourney Weaver and
Ben Kingsley breathes life into the
buried ghosts of a diabolical political
order.
Confined largely to the interiors of
the Escobars' home and spanning a
time period of no more than nine
hours over one night, "Death and
the Maiden" is made to rely purely
on the strength of its three actors,
the quality of Dorfman's script, and
Polanski's once-undisputed pen
chant for relentless cinematic ten
sion. Thanks to Polanski's timely re
covery of form, "Repulsion" and
"Chinatown" have finally found a
worthy successor.
Immortal Beloved
Shortly after Ludwig van
Beethoven's death, a cryptic letter
was found among his possessions.
Addressed to a woman — known
only as "Immortal Beloved" — the
letter became the impetus for one of
history's great romantic mysteries.
Who, among the many women
Beethoven loved, was his one true
love?
Bernard Rose's "Immortal Beloved"
ponders this question with its own
fictitious supposition of events.
When Beethoven's secretary Anton
(Jeroen Krabbe) tries to settle his
friend's affairs after his death, he
discovers the letter and Beethoven's
last will and testament, leaving all

his possessions to the mysterious
"Immortal Beloved." Determined to
honor Beethoven's final wishes,
Anton travels far and wide, visiting
Beethoven's many love interests.
The film's plot unravels as each
woman tells her tale, each revealing
a new side to the mercurial maestro.
Legends of the Fall
Based on Jim Harrison's novella,
"Legends of the Fall" is a tale of
three brothers split apart by — yes,
you guessed it — a woman.
The brothers are, from eldest to
youngest, Alfred (Aidan Quinn), Tris
tan (Brad Pitt) and Samuel (Henry
Thomas). Despite their different na
tures and their different looks (who
in their right mind would think Brad
Pitt and Aidan Quinn were related?),
the brothers form a close-knit family,
headed by the indomitable and
brash Colonel Ludlow (Anthony
Hopkins). Family ties begin to crum
ble, however, when Samuel brings
home his new fiancee Susannah
(Julia Ormond).
A Low Down Dirty Shame
In "A Low Down Dirty Shame,"
Keenan Ivory Wayans shows that he
still has his comedic abilities from
"In Living Color," but that he is not
quite ready for action-hero status.
The movie stars former police officer
Andre Shame who, along with his
assistant Peaches Jordan (Jada Pin
kett of "A Different World" fame)
solves crimes as a private investiga
tor. The CIA hires Shame to find An
gela (Salli Richardson) who will lead
them to a drug kingpin. When
Shame realizes that he used to date
the woman, Peaches gets jealous

and complications arise.
Although the action scenes flopped,
the rest of the movie was able to
sustain interest, especially the
scenes with Jada Pinkett. Keenan
Ivory Wayans succeeded with the
humor in "A Low Down Dirty
Shame," but it's a shame he didn't
try harder to improve the action.
Nobody's Fool
"Nobody's Fool," stars, features,
promotes, centers and focuses on
Paul Newman. The movie doesn't re
ally have a plot, nor does it pretend
to; it just follows the life of Paul New
man (Sully) as he runs into various
different situations in his small town.
Not to say that "Nobody's Fool," is
boring. The film features convincing,
funny, and sometimes touching per
formances from Jessica Tandy in
her last role before her death (as
Mrs. Beryl, Sully's landlord), Bruce
Willis (as Sully's boss, Carl) and
Melanie Griffith (as Toby, Carl's wife
and Sully's love interest).
"Nobody's Fool" 's major failing is
its predictability. The movie is as in
sipid as a sitcom, although, thank
fully, it lacks laugh tracks. However,
the viewer's instinctual knowledge
of what is going to happen (or per
haps it is conditioned by a million
similar movies) makes "Nobody's
Fool" incredibly easy to watch — it is
a pleasant film for those having
brain dead days and die hard Paul
Newman fans.
Pret-a-Porter
0(7/', mon petit chou, the entire fash
ion world has gone day-glo for
Robert Altman's latest flick, "Pret-a-
Porter" (otherwise known as

"Ready-to-Wear," a dumbed-down
title given to U.S. audiences).
Strangely enough, this flick has
been applauded by the industry that
it tries so desperately to ridicule. Do
Christian, Issey, Sonia and Jean-
Paul have the pink angora over their
eyes? Non, mon ami, the fashion
world ain't that oblivious. "Pret-&-
Porter" just fails what it had set out
to do — attack the industry.
As always, he has the glitzy firepow
er: Sofia Loren, Kim Basinger, Tim
Robbins, Julia Roberts, Lauren Ba
call, Danny Aiello, Tracey Ullman
and Marcello Mastroianni among
other movie stars. Altman has even
managed to make the actual insid
ers of the fashion scene cooperate
in the attack. Models, fashion de
signers, and even the ever-ftaufe
Elsa Klench of CNN's "Style" aid Alt
man in his attempt to villify fashion.
But his attempt is done in vain. The
film's plot is as thin as Linda Evan
gelista's upper thigh.
Safe Passage
In what has become her signature
character, Susan Sarandon again
plays a strong-willed woman strug
gling with her self and her surround
ings in "Safe Passage." This time,
she is the mother of seven boys who
must deal with the agonizing wait
following an accident at a Marine
base, not knowing what has hap
pened to her son.
The movie basically belongs to
Sarandon. She has a lot of support
from a large cast, including Sam
Shepard, Robert Sean Leonard and
Sean Astin. The main focus of the
movie is Mag Singer (Sarandon) as
she comes to terms with her life and
actions as a mother.
