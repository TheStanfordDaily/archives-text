# Medical center joins cancer alliance
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
The Stanford Medical Center has
joined 12 other national cancer centers
in forming a new alliance for cancer re
search.
The National Comprehensive Cancer
Network plans to research cancer treat
ment, develop standards for treatment
and contract with employers to provide
cancer care. Stanford is the only repre
sentative from Northern California.
"The nation's leading, prestigious
cancer institutes have joined together to
collaborate on cost-effective treatment,
clinical advances and advocacy," said
Stanford Health Services Associate Di
rector Molly Polidoroff.
"It's a network that will in one sense
lobby for cancer care providers ... and
make sure their interests are represent
ed in terms of continuing quality of
care," she explained. "A lot of research
ensures that that continues to happen."
The institutions in the network —
which include the Dana-Farber Cancer

Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering
and the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center
— will share research, allowing all
groups involved to provide better treat
ment, Polidoroff said.
As part of its improvements, the Med
ical Center plans to build two new facili
ties: a combined cancer and neuro
science research center and an outpa
tient cancer center.
The buildings must be approved by
the University Board of Trustees and by
Palo Alto, but Polidoroff said she knows
of no opposition.
The Medical Center has encountered
opposition to expansion in the past, but
Polidoroff said concerned parties are
aware of the new projects.
When a master plan for projected fa
cilities needs for the Medical Center was
presented to the Palo Alto Comprehen
sive Planning Advisory Committee last
May, the two buildings were included.
"If there are concerns, they would be not
with the research and clinical buildings
specifically but with the overall concept
of buildings," Polidoroff said.

"Much of the fundraising has been
done," Polidoroff said of the research
center, which would be built adjacent to
the Medical School and the Beckman
Center for Molecular and Genetic Medi
cine.
Most of the $40 million to $50 million
the Medical Center hopes to raise has
come from private donations, she said.
The University is now looking for build
ing designs.
The second proposed building will
bring together all of the resources for
outpatient cancer treatment under one
roof, in a building adjacent to the hospi
tal, Polidoroff said. This will be especial
ly important as the number of outpa
tient care visits increases from its cur
rent level of 75,000 a year to the project
ed 100,000 a year, she said.
Care for outpatient cancer patients is
"in all different locations in the Medical
Center," Polidoroff said. "What this pro
poses to do is pull it all together."
She said the Medical School hopes to
complete a program plan for the
outpatient care center within the
next two months and begin a
search for designs.
The new buildings and the new
network will also facilitate the
collaborative approach that can
cer research and treatment cen
ters hope to take in the future,
Polidoroff said.
Doctors at the Stanford Medi
cal Center will be in "a dialogue
with researchers at other institu
tions, sharing information on
costs and research," Polidoroff
said. "They'll work collaborative
ly to develop optimal practice
guidelines for each of the major
types of cancer treatment."
The alliance means "the wis
dom and knowledge of Stanford
combined . . . with top-notch
research institutes," she said.
With new facilities at Stanford,
work here will be better consoli
dated as well, Polidoroff added.
"If you were newly-diagnosed
with breast cancer, for example,
you could meet with several spe
cialists at once," she said. "You
get the benefit of three opinions
in one.

"In a lot of other situations,
you would see several doctors sep
arately," she added. "This (pro
ject) enables the collaborative
approach. Everyone is involved in
the assessment and the treatment
planning."
Faculty and staff at the Medi
cal Center are "really excited"
about being part of the network,
Polidoroff said.
"The cancer program at Stan
ford is world-class, and the one
thing that's been lacking is a facil
ity to encourage the collaborative
approach," she said. "This is a
long-needed development."
The 13 centers in the network
are Stanford; the University of
Michigan Comprehensive Cancer
Center; the Johns Hopkins Oncol
ogy Center; the Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute; the Northwest
ern University / Lurie Cancer
Center; the Ohio State University
Comprehensive Cancer Cen
ter / Arthur G. James Cancer
Hospital and Research Institute;
the City of Hope National Medical
Center; the M.D. Anderson Can
cer Center; St. Jude Children's
Research Hospital; Memorial
Sloan-Kettering; the University
of Nebraska Medical Center; the
Fox Chase Cancer Center; and
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center.
