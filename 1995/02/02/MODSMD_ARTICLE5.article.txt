# Medical center joins cancer alliance

### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
The Stanford Medical Center has
joined 12 other national cancer centers
in forming a new alliance for cancer re
search.
The National Comprehensive Cancer
Network plans to research cancer treat
ment, develop standards for treatment
and contract with employers to provide
cancer care. Stanford is the only repre
sentative from Northern California.
"The nation's leading, prestigious
cancer institutes have joined together to
collaborate on cost-effective treatment,
clinical advances and advocacy," said
Stanford Health Services Associate Di
rector Molly Polidoroff.
"It's a network that will in one sense
lobby for cancer care providers ... and
make sure their interests are represent
ed in terms of continuing quality of
care," she explained. "A lot of research
ensures that that continues to happen."
The institutions in the network —
which include the Dana-Farber Cancer

Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering
and the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center
— will share research, allowing all
groups involved to provide better treat
ment, Polidoroff said.
As part of its improvements, the Med
ical Center plans to build two new facili
ties: a combined cancer and neuro
science research center and an outpa
tient cancer center.
The buildings must be approved by
the University Board of Trustees and by
Palo Alto, but Polidoroff said she knows
of no opposition.
The Medical Center has encountered
opposition to expansion in the past, but
Polidoroff said concerned parties are
aware of the new projects.
When a master plan for projected fa
cilities needs for the Medical Center was
presented to the Palo Alto Comprehen
sive Planning Advisory Committee last
May, the two buildings were included.
"If there are concerns, they would be not
with the research and clinical buildings
specifically but with the overall concept
of buildings," Polidoroff said.

"Much of the fundraising has been
done," Polidoroff said of the research
center, which would be built adjacent to
the Medical School and the Beckman
Center for Molecular and Genetic Medi
cine.
Most of the $40 million to $50 million
the Medical Center hopes to raise has
come from private donations, she said.
The University is now looking for build
ing designs.
The second proposed building will
bring together all of the resources for
outpatient cancer treatment under one
roof, in a building adjacent to the hospi
tal, Polidoroff said. This will be especial
ly important as the number of outpa
tient care visits increases from its cur
rent level of 75,000 a year to the project
ed 100,000 a year, she said.
Care for outpatient cancer patients is
"in all different locations in the Medical
Center," Polidoroff said. "What this pro
poses to do is pull it all together."
She said the Medical School hopes to
