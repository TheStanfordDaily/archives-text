# Near agreement on proposal
## Stanford Fund committee on track 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
As its self-imposed Feb. 15 dead
line draws near, student and staff
members of the Stanford Fund
committee say they are getting
much closer to an agreement.
The group met yesterday to dis
cuss an alumni-giving proposal sub
mitted by the administrators who
sit on the committee, said Stephen
Peeps, associate vice president of
the Office of Development.
Student members submitted
their own proposal last week, and
all that remains is the job of hashing
out the differences between them.
The committee was created after
students and alumni protested a
University donation policy that es
sentially had the effect of limiting
student groups' ability to solicit do
nations from alumni over a period
of time.
"It's tricky," said Council of*
Presidents member Vanessa Al
varado, who co-chairs the commit
tee with Peeps. "There are certain
aspects of both proposals we both
agree with. ... Basically, we now

have an agreement to make an
agreement."
Peeps said he is also pleased with
the progress the committee has
made, and stressed that the two
proposals have a lot of common
ground.

1 think we're pretty
close in terms of new
ideas and revisions
to old ideas.'

"I'm frankly very appreciative of
the extent to which Vanessa and
Lisa [Lee], Mike [Choo] and Steve
[Russell] have clearly understood
what kinds of things we're trying to
accomplish and how to propose re
visions that address the Universi
ty's concerns," he said.
The committee plans to meet at
least twice next week to work on
drawing up its final proposal in time
to meet the Feb. 15 deadline.

Peeps stressed that the deadline
is "not a drop-dead ultimatum kind
of date" but is rather a self-imposed
timeline.
"We set ourselves a Feb. 15dead
line just to give ourselves some
thing to push against.... It doesn't
mean that the old policy comes
slamming back down on Feb. 15,"
he said. "We clearly feel we'll make
it, but I'm sure we'll agree to take
whatever additional time we need.
It's not true that everything is lost."
Though Peeps said the commit
tee is at little risk of not reaching a
decision in the next two weeks, Al
varado said the group will work as
hard as it needs to meet that goal.
"We will meet every day if we
have to," she said.
Yesterday's meeting was actual
ly only the third real discussion the
committee has had, Peeps added.
"We didn't really get together until
winter quarter," he said.
"Now we're in the stage where
we're giving each other ideas about
what we'd like to see, "Peeps said. "I
think we're pretty close in terms of
new ideas and revisions to old
ideas."
