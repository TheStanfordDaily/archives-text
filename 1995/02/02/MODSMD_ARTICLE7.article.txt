# Conquest judges European Union
## In speech, historian predicts that union will not work well 
### Gabriela Teodorescu Contributing writer 
What has always given the world so much
trouble, said renowned historian and poet Robert
Conquest, are those ideas with a capital "I."
"The European Union (EU) was an idea with
a capital letter — like Revolution and Socialism,"
Conquest said yesterday."It seems, though, that
ideas with capital letters do not work out so well
in the world," he added.
Conquest — a senior research fellow and
scholar-curator of the Russian and East Euro
pean Collection at the Hoover Institution — tried
to answer the question "What is Europe?" in a
speech held at the Lou Henry Hoover Memorial
Building.
Conquest gave the example of recent meetings
between some European Union members and
Czech government officials in Prague. "The econ
omists did not think joining would necessarily
help, but the politicians said that, well, it was such
a good idea," said Conquest, drawing laughter
from the crowd of 65 who gathered to hear his cri
tique of the European Union in its present state.

Robert Conquest critiqued the European Union
In a lecture yesterday.
He questioned many of the
modern contentions of a Europe
united on cultural, linguistic or
geographic bases. "We use the
term Europe in a political sense,
but that... makes the issue divi
sive," he said.
Explaining some of the rea
sons for popular opposition to the
EU, Conquest focused on repre
sentation. "In its present state,
the problem is that no one in
Brussels [headquarters of the
EU] is elected or responsible to
anyone," he said.
Conquest also criticized the
role of bureaucratic interests
spearheading the EU. "At the
roots, a group of bureaucrats is
trying to get the electorate to go
along with them, and they have
done it on such a mass scale
that the electorate — and some
times even the politicians — do
not know what is going on," he
said.
"There is a revulsion now on
the part of the electorate against
super-bureaucratic, ideological
interests," Conquest argued.
"The Maastricht Treaty [the cru
cial economic treaty for the EU]
was a huge, incomprehensible
document."
Conquest questioned whether
the EU is united, based on his
analysis of its foreign policy fail
ures. "As the Bosnian crisis
shows, each country, in the end,
still hangs on to its own foreign
policy," he said.
Fielding questions from the
audience, Conquest reflected on
the possible threat of an authori
tarian regime in Russia. "If Rus
sia moves in an undemocratic
direction, the idea of unity will be
very important," he said. "But
one of the problems with the EU
is that it divides the West — it
excludes America."
In his final analysis, Con
quest's predictions for the fate of
the EU were negative. "In the
short run, we are in for more
bureaucracy and muddle," he
said. "In the long run, it will all
blow apart."
Conquest has written 18
books on Soviet history and poli
tics and international affairs,
including "The Great Terror."
He has also authored six volumes
of poetry and one of literary criti
cism.
