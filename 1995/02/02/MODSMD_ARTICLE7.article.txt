# Conquest judges European Union
## In speech, historian predicts that union will not work well 
### Gabriela Teodorescu Contributing writer 
What has always given the world so much
trouble, said renowned historian and poet Robert
Conquest, are those ideas with a capital "I."
"The European Union (EU) was an idea with
a capital letter — like Revolution and Socialism,"
Conquest said yesterday."It seems, though, that
ideas with capital letters do not work out so well
in the world," he added.
Conquest — a senior research fellow and
scholar-curator of the Russian and East Euro
pean Collection at the Hoover Institution — tried
to answer the question "What is Europe?" in a
speech held at the Lou Henry Hoover Memorial
Building.
Conquest gave the example of recent meetings
between some European Union members and
Czech government officials in Prague. "The econ
omists did not think joining would necessarily
help, but the politicians said that, well, it was such
a good idea," said Conquest, drawing laughter
from the crowd of 65 who gathered to hear his cri
tique of the European Union in its present state.
