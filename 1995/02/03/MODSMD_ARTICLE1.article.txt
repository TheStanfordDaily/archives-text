### Martin L. Yeung Contributing writer 
Stanford rang in the Chinese
New Year with a bang by an
nouncing $6.4 million in contri
butions from Taiwanese alumni
and the Ministry of Education for
the Republic of China.
David Gordon, associate dean

of external rela
tions, said the
money would
endow four pro
fessorships hon
oring Kwoh-Ting
Li, who is widely
regarded as one
of the planners of
Taiwan's rapid
economic expan
sion.

The new chairs are designated
for the areas of economic develop
ment, electrical engineering, med
icine or biological sciences, and
Chinese culture.
The first Li chair holders are
Economics Prof. Lawrence Lau,
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Thomas Cover and Genetics Prof.
Stanley Cohen. The professorship
in Chinese culture has not been
filled.
"This is the result of our close
negotiations with Taiwanese
alumni," said Gordon. "In 1990,
the University entered negotia
tions with Li and alumni with the
goal of endowing several profes
sorships."
In a press release, University
President Gerhard Casper said
that he was "grateful for the sig-


Casper
nificant commitment from the
Ministry of Education that both
honors Dr. Kwoh-Ting Li and
directly supports the heart of the
University.
"Stanford and the Republic of
China on Taiwan enjoy many
strong ties through our faculty,
our students and our alumni,"
Casper said. "We value that rela
tionship, and I know that it will
continue to flourish."
Though Li is not an alumnus of
Stanford, his close working rela
tionship with several of Stan
ford's top academic and adminis

trative leaders, as well as with
prominent Taiwanese alumni, led
contributors to honor Li by nam
ing the new professorships in his
honor.
Li, 85, is a business leader in
Taiwan and has held several cabi
net positions there, including
minister of finance and minister
of state. Currently he holds the
rank of senior advisor to the pres
ident of the Republic of China.
Cindy Ng, Assistant Director
for the Asian-American Activities
Center, said that the donation
benefits not only the Asian com
munity here but all members of
the Stanford campus.
"We appreciate [the donation];
it's great news â€” the contribu
tions of Asian alumni. ... I hope

this encourages more support
from these alumni," said Ng.
"The professorships were orga
nized to recognize senior faculty
that had made significant contri
butions to their respective fields,"
Gordon said. "Recipients will be
unrestricted in how they choose
to use their funds in regards to
research."
Jyh-Yuan Lo, director general
of the Taipei Economic and Cul
tural Office in San Francisco,
issued a press statement explain
ing why Stanford was chosen over
other elite Universities for the
donation.
"Many of our best students
[from Taiwan] come to study at
Stanford. We appreciate the out
standing education and financial

support they receive from the
University, and we invite and
encourage the future Li chair
holders to visit Taiwan and help
promote future academic and cul
tural collaboration between Stan
ford and the Republic of China."
Of the total $6.4 million contri
bution, $1 million comes from the
Ministry of Fducation of the
Republic of China, $4.2 million
from various prominent Tai
wanese alumni and $1.2 million
from Stanford's own coffers.
"The money Stanford kicks in
is from a fund set up during the
Centennial fund-raising cam
paign," Gordon said. "There are
no funds from the budget or the
endowment being diverted to this
project."
