# Israel-PLO peace talks resume
## Middle East leaders condemn terrorism but offer no ways to stop attacks 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) — After an
unprecedented summit, Israel and its
three Arab peace partners agreed yester
day to resume Israeli-PLO negotiations
next week and set up a series of meetings
to further the peace process.
Still, they came up with no new ways to
stop attacks on Israelis by Muslim extrem
ists.
Israel and PI/O negotiators will meet
again Monday in Cairo, while PLO chief
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin will meet Thursday at a
border crossing in the Gaza Strip, said
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
Jordan's King Hussein and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, along with
Arafat and Rabin, also condemned terror
ism and agreed to work toward a nuclear
free Middle East.
"The four parties condemned all the
outbreaks of bloodshed, terror and vio
lence in the region and reaffirmed their
intention to stand staunchly against, and
put an end to, all such acts," the leaders
said in a statement read by Moussa.
The meeting represented a dramatic

show of unity among Israel and its three
Arab peace partners. But despite the
declaration, disillusionment with the
Israel-PLO agreement runs deep, and
the leaders' ability to stem murderous
attacks by Islamic militants was uncer
tain at best.
Rabin and Arafat, the key players, are
facing dwindling popularity, and success of
the agreement is crucial to their political
careers. The Israeli-PLO talks were halted
after a Jan. 22 suicide bombing that killed
21 Israelis.
The four also agreed to convene a meet
ing of the foreign ministers of Israel, Jor
dan and Egypt and a Palestinian represen
tative in Washington with Secretary of
State Warren Christopher on Feb. 12.
Yesterday's meeting got under way
after sundown at the Ittahadiya presiden
tial palace with a meal to break the day
long fast Muslims observe during the holy
month of Ramadan.
The three visiting leaders met with
Mubarak separately before the summit,
but no one commented on the meetings.
Before leaving Jerusalem, Rabin made

it clear that an end to attacks on Israelis
was the key to expanding autonomy in the
West Bank and holding Palestinian elec
tions, both elements of the Israeli-PLO
accord signed in September 1993.
Arafat's government must "make sure
the territory they rule — Gaza and Jericho
— is not used as shelter, or a place to pre
pare, incite and execute attacks," Rabin
told members of his Labor Party.
"Their ability to meet it will decide
more than anything both the speed and
possibility of progress in implementing the
solution of the Palestinian-Israeli con
flict," Rabin said.
For their part, the Palestinians hoped
Israel would reopen the Palestinian terri
tories closed since a Jan. 22 homing, said
Arafat adviser Nabil Abu Irdeineh.
The Palestinians want Israel to begin
withdrawing Israeli troops from Palestini
an towns in the West Bank to make way
for elections and the release of Palestinian
prisoners. They also demand a halt to the
expansion of Jewish settlements on occu
pied land — even as Israel is adding thou
sands of homes to the Jewish enclaves.
