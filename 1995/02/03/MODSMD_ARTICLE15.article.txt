# CIA role to be studied
## Clinton launches bipartisan look at intelligence agency 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Clinton officially launched a
bipartisan study of the CIA yester
day to rethink the roles, priorities
and structure of American intelli
gence in light of the Cold War's end
and the ClA's recent setbacks.
The reassessment is the broadest
undertaken in the 47-year history of
the CIA, which itself is in a state of
flux with no permanent director, an
often sour relationship with
Congress and a sagging reputation.
"It's right to say everything is on
the table," said Les Aspin, whom
Clinton named as chairman of the
commission.
The chief questions to be
addressed, Aspin said in an inter
view, are what kinds of intelligence
are needed, how should the intelli

gence agencies — including the CIA
— be structured, and how much
spending will the public support?
Clinton announced the adminis
tration's appointment of seven men
and two women to the review panel,
officially called the Commission on
the Roles and Capabilities of the
U.S. Intelligence Community.
Congress, which created the com
mission last fall, already had
appointed eight members.
As expected, Clinton named
Aspin, the administration's first
defense secretary, as chairman of
the 17-member panel. To provide
political balance, former Sen. War
ren Rudman, a Republican from
New Hampshire, is the panel's vice
chairman.
The commission was to hold its

first meeting today. It is supposed to
report its findings by March 1996.
In a statement announcing his
appointments to the commission,
Clinton said he remained convinced
of the need for a first-rate intelli
gence network, but that with the
end of the Cold War it was neces
sary to renew bipartisan support for
the CIA.
"The foundation for this support
must begin with a thorough assess
ment of the kind of intelligence
community we will need to address
the security challenges of the
future," Clinton said.
The president said he attaches
"the highest personal priority" to
this effort, which he said should
shore up public trust in the work of
U.S. intelligence officers.
