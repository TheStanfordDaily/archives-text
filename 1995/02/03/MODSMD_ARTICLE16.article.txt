# Quake donations reach $300 M

### 
TOKYO (AP) — Japanese,
usually reluctant to help
strangers, have given hundreds of
millions of dollars to those left
homeless by the devastating Kobe
earthquake.
Japan's Red Cross Society said
yesterday it has received $300
million dollars in donations, far
more than in any of its previous
relief campaigns. It estimated
more than 90 percent of the
money came from Japanese.
Local officials, meanwhile,
increased their estimates of the
damage from the 7.2 magnitude
quake and said it is likely to
exceed $100 billion.
Nearly 250,000 people lost
their homes in the Jan. 17 quake,
which killed 5,104 people, with six
still listed as missing.
The national government, criti
cized for what many consider

insufficient efforts to help quake
victims, said yesterday it would
spend almost $150 million to build
30,000 temporary housing units.
The first four prefab houses
have been completed and families
moved in yesterday.
"It was wonderful. It was too
good for me," Kimiko Ishibitsu,
70, said of her new two-room
home on hard-hit Island.
Many people will have to spend
two to three more months in shel
ters such as tents and converted
school gymnasiums before hous
ing is available, said Rumiko
Kadonaga of the government of
Hyogo prefecture, which includes
Kobe.
"We are very concerned
whether volunteers can continue
their activities for that long," she
said. "We can't estimate how
many volunteers are working in

the quake-stricken areas. It might
be 50,000 or 100,000."
In normal times, Japanese are
reluctant to help people who
aren't family, friends or close
neighbors. They also may be
reluctant to accept gifts for fear of
becoming obligated to the giver.
But the quake in Kobe, a city of
1.4 million people 270 miles west
of Tokyo, has brought out chari
table impulses throughout the
nation.
All over Japan — at temples,
convenience stores, outside train
stations and in health clubs —
collection boxes ask passersby for
contributions.
In Kobe, venders have passed
out cooked sweet potatoes, the
only hot food for many. Some stu
dents' hands are swollen from
making hundreds of rice balls a
day.
