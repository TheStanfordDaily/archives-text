## Editor's farewell The 						gift of giving 
### 
IN A WAY, I guess I know now
how my mother felt when I left
for college.
Her little baby, who she had
taught so much and learned so
much from, was no longer hers. She
knew it was time for me to go, but
her heart still ached. It was a bitter
sweet time that brought both tears
of joy and pain.
I don't pretend to know what it's
really like to be a parent, but as my
time at The Daily now draws to a
close, I find it difficult to let go.
There has been no other place in my
life where I have learned so much,
taught so much, failed so much, suc
ceeded so much, hated so much and
loved so much. Yet there is nothing
else for me to do here — I must hand
over the reins.
The Daily is so much more than a
newspaper. It is an organization full
of incredibly talented, intelligent,
motivated people who give of them
selves everyday to publish the best
product they can. It is a huge team
of which I have been extremely
proud to lead.
But as I leave, I must admit that
I do feel old and wise and have accu
mulated thoughts to share. And for
me it comes down to the fact that
life is more enriching when you give
something of yourself. For me, my
Stanford experience has been
immensely rewarding because I gave
of myself. Simply put, it always
seemed I received back a thousand
times what I gave and both I, and
the people around me, were happier.
Yet for so long I believed the oppo
site. When I was 10 and my father
died, my heart broke. In order to put
the pieces back together, I had to
concentrate on myself and what
made me happy. I spent all my time
thinking about was how I was feel
ing and things that only affected me.
But in the end, I only felt hollow.
Though it's hard to believe, it was
The Daily that taught me that I am
happy and fulfilled making those
that I love happy. One would never
think that the chaos of the Daily
newsroom could be comforting to
some, but it always has been to me.
But when I look at Stanford as a
whole, I am the first to admit that

the stereotypical self-absorbed Stan
ford student depresses me. I truly
believe that Stanford would be a bet
ter place if everyone thought a little
less about their GPA and their
resume and more about those
around them.
Looking toward my future and
life after Stanford, I wonder if oth
ers will walk behind me at The Daily
and have the same love affair that I
had with this place. And I wonder if
Stanford students will begin to
share more and that a community
feeling will grow.
I have no control over such
things, but I hope that those who
read this and relate will lead by
example and will continue to give of
themselves.
So I find it appropriate that my
final act as editor in chief will be to
acknowledge the numerous people
who have guided me through all of
this and have continually given to
me.
To my mother, who taught me
the meaning of selflessness, thank
you for trusting me to make the
right decisions about my life and
always listening.
To my staff, thank you for your
hard work and dedication — they
were always noticed and appreciat
ed. We put out a consistently excel
lent newspaper of which I am very
proud, and I enjoyed it every step of
the way. And to those of you who
continue on at The Daily, I have no
doubt you will take the paper to new
heights.
To the chicks in Jenkins 206,
thanks for your continuous support,
encouragement and visits. You've all
helped me keep perspective on my
life this year. I hope you're ready for
your sixth roommate to come home
because I've missed you all.
And to the Stanford community,
thank you for reading and respond
ing. Obviously my job here would
have been meaningless without you,
and I hope The Daily has added to
your life in some way over these few
months.
