Pub Board directors have treated Chaparral unfairly

IN RESPONSE TO Melinda Loren
son's letter of Jan. 31, and also to
the barrage of misinformed testi
monial that has been printed concern
ing the allocation of student publica
tion space in the Storke Building, it is
my wish to provide a rebuttal on behalf
of the Stanford Chaparral and the
Hammer and Coffin Society.
The Chaparral has been painted as
an enemy of the Publications Board,
and has suffered thorough painful
revilement by its peers. We are treated
this way because we are asking for a
fair hearing, for the opportunity to
have our space reallocated by legiti
mate means — not to remain alone in
office space that is not optimally uti-

lized — yet we are vilified. We would
have been happy to give up half the
space we paid for, if only we could have
had some input as to the reallocation.
Instead, we have been attacked, abused
and silenced by both this year's and
last year's Publications Board direc
tors, Daniel Bressler and Stephen Rus
sell, for sticking up for our rights, and
our space has been annexed in a sloppy
and deleterious manner.
Do the representative publications
really believe that the University
would go over their heads and freeze
space allocations unless the University
suspected that something had been
done in bad faith? This is a belief that
flies in the face of reason. Does no one

respect the decisions of those well
versed in the history of this matter?
Yes, alumni from as far back as
1926 are involved in this dispute, and
there is good reason for this. It was
then that Chaparral Editor Northcutt
Ely, then a student at the Law School,
drafted a trust agreement with the
University that was designed to
finance building space for the Cha
parral. Among other things, recent
developments in space allocation vio
late this trust and Stanford's promise
to the Chaparral. Despite current sen
timents to the contrary, this is very
much an issue for alumni and students
both.
We have empirical and well-docu-

mented evidence that we have been
treated unfairly by the Publications
Board directors of this year and last,
and all we ask is a chance to be heard
in an unbiased forum. To date, this has
not been possible, but we are hopeful.
Until the intervention of fairness, the
rectification of injustice, and a proper
assessment of the Chaparral's alterna
tive space allocation bill (which has
been stifled for months) are realized,
Storke Student Publications Building
space will remain frozen, and the Stan
ford publishing community will contin
ue to suffer.
