## Ross Shachter Community has some responsibilities 
### 
This is the fifth
year that my
wife, Ruth, and I
have served as resident
fellows, living in an
undergraduate resi
dence with 100 stu
dents. It has been, and
continues to be, a won
derful experience, in
large part because our family feels part
of a strong community within the
house. There is a sense of belonging that
I feel as a faculty member, but my con
nection to the Stanford community is
clearly more intense as a result of my
residence experience. I understand that
there is some disagreement on campus
whether Stanford is primarily a commu
nity or an institution, but for many of
us, that sense of community is real and
essential for our learning and growth.
The issues I want to explore here
today are some of the responsibilities
that come with being a member of our
community.
The foundation of our community is
appropriate behavior by individuals
making their own decisions. For stu
dents, this is embodied in the broad
Fundamental Standard, although
there is no analogous single rule for
faculty or staff. When we identify with
a group, we feel an obligation to the
individuals in the group and to the
welfare of the group as a whole. For
students, it is often part of the educa
tional experience to develop personal
standards for individual and group
responsibility. At the same time, they

must reconcile their standards with
the behaviors of their peers.
Consider the standards of dialogue
and expression that are derisively
labeled "political correctness." The
idea, quite simply, is that we should
respect each other and our differences
in background and beliefs such as race,
gender, sexual orientation or religious
beliefs. Therefore, we try to celebrate
the right of expression by those whose
political beliefs are anything but "cor
rect," provided they are willing to lis
ten to and respect others. We learn
from these conversations precisely
because there are no restrictions on
the ideas we can express.
When our standards of mutual
respect and individual dignity work
well, we can examine divisive issues
and learn from one another. In polite
society, conversations avoid politics,
religion, sex and race. In the resi
dences, such topics often dominate
conversations. Furthermore, as a
member of the Stanford community, I
have a right and obligation to express
my disagreements with the policies of
the University, if I can express those
disagreements respectfully. Alcohol is
perhaps the most explosive issue of
residence responsibility on campus
these days. As a community member,
my main concerns with alcohol are the
related risks (such as vandalism,
assaults, harassment and driving
under the influence), which represent
unacceptable behavior regardless of
whether alcohol is involved. My next
priority is helping individuals suffer

ing from alcohol abuse. I find that any
concern about underage drinking is
counterproductive in managing the
first two.
Alcohol raises other community
issues of mutual concern and respect
involving the rights of those who pre
fer not to drink, which are well under
stood and usually well handled on cam
pus. Essentially, we need to take care
of each other, our friends, and our
guests, whether we are at home or
away.
There is one important respect in
which we are not taking such good care
of each other. When a member of our
community has a drinking problem,
most of us do not know how to help
him or her confront the problem and
seek help. Although I have seen resi
dents accompany a friend to Counsel
ing and Psychological Services or to
Alcoholics Anonymous, usually resi
dents expect the residential staff to
deal with alcoholism as a disciplinary
problem, which is much less effective.
In closing, many of us benefit as
members of the Stanford community,
in residences, academic departments,
ethnic centers, religious groups, teams
and other student activities. Our com
munity is most effective when we pay
attention to the responsibilities as well
as the benefits of that membership.
