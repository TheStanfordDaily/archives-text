OXFORD, ENGLAND
YOU COULD EXCUSE the Prince of
Wales for being a bit unsuspecting
during his appearance at a dedication
ceremony here Tuesday. The prince had
hardly begun his obligatory stroll through
the small, subdued crowd of Magdalen Col
lege onlookers when he stopped to chat with
a gaggle of Nikon-toting students. To his
mild surprise, they attended Stanford Uni
versity. Charles — an affable and rather
handsome chap in person, we all agreed —
politely inquired why we were in Oxford and
what we studied. He pressed some flesh and
moved on, only to find still more giddy Stan
fordians and an on-camera interview for a
Stanford-in-Oxford documentary awaiting
him. "You've invaded this place," he said
with a sigh.
Perhaps the prince welcomed the chance
to meet some American students, if only
because it allowed him to meet fewer
English ones; 49 percent of Chuck's subjects
believe the monarchy has outlived the mort
gage on Buckingham Palace. But Charles
isn't the only one having problems. Over
Christmas break, I traveled throughout
Europe, from Paris to Prague to Portbou,
Spain. During that time, I found that other
Europeans, hurtling toward ostensible
union while haunted by the differences of
their past, also cling to paradoxes as great
and archaic as putting a crown on a flawed,

powerless man's head and calling him King
of England.
No two cities summarize the bundle of
contradictions that is Europe better than
Vienna and Prague. Vienna lies almost 100
miles east of Prague, yet considers itself
West European. On Jan. 1, Austria became
a full member in the European Union. The
Czech Republic, obscured for 40 years
behind the Iron Curtain, is campaigning
vigorously for EU membership, but has yet
to receive even a timetable for possible
acceptance.
A visit to the two cities reveals how
absurdly misleading these East-West dis
tinctions are. I arrived in Vienna a little over
a week before Austria's accession to the EU.
The impending date clearly had little effect
on the Viennese people, because none of
them were around. It was a beautiful, sunny
afternoon, the last Sunday before Christ
mas, and yet nearly all the commercial
streets seemed deserted, the shop windows
dark and uninviting.
In the middle of the city, the sprawling
Hapsburg palaces, now decaying and sleepy,
loomed like some unavoidable reminder of
how far the city has fallen. And that's part
of the problem. Europe bores Vienna
because Vienna is boring. Everything about
it reeks of an age and an attitude that disap
peared somewhere around the turn of the
century. Beethoven remains the hippest cat
around, and techno be damned, that's the

way Vienna likes it.
Prague, on the other hand, hits you
before you even arrive. About 15 minutes
outside the station where we disembarked,
the train passed by a Communist relic, a
suburban neighborhood full of high-rise
buildings all sad and gray. The new Prague,
full of amateur capitalists, greeted us the
moment we stepped off the train. Within
seconds, eager salespeople accosted us, ask
ing in perfect English if we needed places to
stay. "When Bill Clinton came to Prague, he
stayed here," one man said, proudly show
ing us on a postcard the proximity of his flat
to Clinton's hotel. When we declined his
offer, he shook our hands and lamented that
business was slow.
That I find hard to believe. Even in late
December, Prague swims with bohemian
expats and bewildered tourists. Wenceslas
Square, the sight of some of the most coura
geous pro-democracy demonstrations this
century, has become a poor man's Champs-
Elysdes, with American Express, Nina Ricci
and McDonald's dotting the sidewalks. I
stopped for a beer at a pub off the square,
and found David Robinson posters on the
wall and an American flag behind the bar
and a cheery waitress who hailed from
Spokane, Wash.
Split personalities aren't confined to the
East. Barcelona, for instance, swears fore
most allegiance not to Spain, but to the
region of Catalonia. When I visited in 1992

for the Olympics, nearly every balcony in
the city's Gothic Quarter was draped with
Catalonia's red- and gold-striped flag. This
time, the flags were gone, but a smug defi
ance still hung in the air.
At lunch on New Year's Eve, my friend's
mother told me about life in Barcelona
under the Francisco Franco regime. Franco
banned the regional language, Catalan, per
mitting only Spanish to be taught. But Cat
alonians are resourceful. "All the families in
my neighborhood would gather at the house
of a local poet," she said. "We had to close all
the curtains and whisper. Our parents read
us stories and poems, to teach us Catalan."
I could detect a lingering anger at the Span
ish government, even Spain itself. Who can
blame her? After Franco died, she finally
learned to write her own language, at the
same time as her five year-old son.
Any discussion of Europe's
schizophrenic demons — and whether they
can be exorcised — inevitably arrives at
Berlin, for obvious reasons. It is now five
years since the Wall came down, and Ger
many is still building itself back up. Con
struction cranes have sprouted everywhere
in East Berlin. The skyline is an eerie con
stellation of concrete and yellow pipe.
On a bleak, frigid day early last month, I
went, with two Stanford friends, to the
Brandenburg Gate. Just outside the gate, in
what used to be the no man's land between
East and West Berlin, we stopped at a clus

ter of souvenir stands. They all sold "gen
uine" remnants of the wall, and we exam
ined one merchant's wares. "I cut these
with my hands, all myself," he told us. "I
went to the wall and worked there. Five
weeks — in the hottest time of the year." He
showed us two photographs of himself, first
standing in front of a sizable chunk of the
Wall, then standing above it, having reduced
the slab to rubble.
His story impressed us, and we all
snapped up a few packets of painted Wall
fragments. What will he do when the pieces
run out? "I will thank God," he said.
"Maybe then I can sell some other things."
He looked over his collection of Red Army
badges, Gorbachev dolls, used machine-gun
clips and sighed. "I have so many other
things to sell."
I got the feeling that things hadn't
turned out for this man as he had expected.
Were those days of poetry and hope, when
Berliners — indeed, all Europeans —
reclaimed their destiny from history's vice,
really so long ago? Has Europe forgotten, in
just five years? All at once, the man piped up
again. "Still, it is good," he said with a wry
smile, as if to remind us, and himself, "to eat
and drink the Wall."

Catalonia's red- and gold-striped flag. This
time, the flags were gone, but a smug defi
ance still hung in the air.
At lunch on New Year's Eve, my friend's
mother told me about life in Barcelona
under the Francisco Franco regime. Franco
banned the regional language, Catalan, per
mitting only Spanish to be taught. But Cat
alonians are resourceful. "All the families in
my neighborhood would gather at the house
of a local poet," she said. "We had to close all
the curtains and whisper. Our parents read
us stories and poems, to teach us Catalan."
I could detect a lingering anger at the Span
ish government, even Spain itself. Who can
blame her? After Franco died, she finally
learned to write her own language, at the
same time as her five year-old son.
Any discussion of Europe's
schizophrenic demons — and whether they
can be exorcised — inevitably arrives at
Berlin, for obvious reasons. It is now five
years since the Wall came down, and Ger
many is still building itself back up. Con
struction cranes have sprouted everywhere
in East Berlin. The skyline is an eerie con
stellation of concrete and yellow pipe.
On a bleak, frigid day early last month, I
went, with two Stanford friends, to the
Brandenburg Gate. Just outside the gate, in
what used to be the no man's land between
East and West Berlin, we stopped at a clus

ter of souvenir stands. They all sold "gen
uine" remnants of the wall, and we exam
ined one merchant's wares. "I cut these
with my hands, all myself," he told us. "I
went to the wall and worked there. Five
weeks — in the hottest time of the year." He
showed us two photographs of himself, first
standing in front of a sizable chunk of the
Wall, then standing above it, having reduced
the slab to rubble.
His story impressed us, and we all
snapped up a few packets of painted Wall
fragments. What will he do when the pieces
run out? "I will thank God," he said.
"Maybe then I can sell some other things."
He looked over his collection of Red Army
badges, Gorbachev dolls, used machine-gun
clips and sighed. "I have so many other
things to sell."
I got the feeling that things hadn't
turned out for this man as he had expected.
Were those days of poetry and hope, when
Berliners — indeed, all Europeans —
reclaimed their destiny from history's vice,
really so long ago? Has Europe forgotten, in
just five years? All at once, the man piped up
again. "Still, it is good," he said with a wry
smile, as if to remind us, and himself, "to eat
and drink the Wall."

OXFORD, ENGLAND
YOU COULD EXCUSE the Prince of
Wales for being a bit unsuspecting
during his appearance at a dedication
ceremony here Tuesday. The prince had
hardly begun his obligatory stroll through
the small, subdued crowd of Magdalen Col
lege onlookers when he stopped to chat with
a gaggle of Nikon-toting students. To his
mild surprise, they attended Stanford Uni
versity. Charles — an affable and rather
handsome chap in person, we all agreed —
politely inquired why we were in Oxford and
what we studied. He pressed some flesh and
moved on, only to find still more giddy Stan
fordians and an on-camera interview for a
Stanford-in-Oxford documentary awaiting
him. "You've invaded this place," he said
with a sigh.
Perhaps the prince welcomed the chance
to meet some American students, if only
because it allowed him to meet fewer
English ones; 49 percent of Chuck's subjects
believe the monarchy has outlived the mort
gage on Buckingham Palace. But Charles
isn't the only one having problems. Over
Christmas break, I traveled throughout
Europe, from Paris to Prague to Portbou,
Spain. During that time, I found that other
Europeans, hurtling toward ostensible
union while haunted by the differences of
their past, also cling to paradoxes as great
and archaic as putting a crown on a flawed,

powerless man's head and calling him King
of England.
No two cities summarize the bundle of
contradictions that is Europe better than
Vienna and Prague. Vienna lies almost 100
miles east of Prague, yet considers itself
West European. On Jan. 1, Austria became
a full member in the European Union. The
Czech Republic, obscured for 40 years
behind the Iron Curtain, is campaigning
vigorously for EU membership, but has yet
to receive even a timetable for possible
acceptance.
A visit to the two cities reveals how
absurdly misleading these East-West dis
tinctions are. I arrived in Vienna a little over
a week before Austria's accession to the EU.
The impending date clearly had little effect
on the Viennese people, because none of
them were around. It was a beautiful, sunny
afternoon, the last Sunday before Christ
mas, and yet nearly all the commercial
streets seemed deserted, the shop windows
dark and uninviting.
In the middle of the city, the sprawling
Hapsburg palaces, now decaying and sleepy,
loomed like some unavoidable reminder of
how far the city has fallen. And that's part
of the problem. Europe bores Vienna
because Vienna is boring. Everything about
it reeks of an age and an attitude that disap
peared somewhere around the turn of the
century. Beethoven remains the hippest cat
around, and techno be damned, that's the

way Vienna likes it.
Prague, on the other hand, hits you
before you even arrive. About 15 minutes
outside the station where we disembarked,
the train passed by a Communist relic, a
suburban neighborhood full of high-rise
buildings all sad and gray. The new Prague,
full of amateur capitalists, greeted us the
moment we stepped off the train. Within
seconds, eager salespeople accosted us, ask
ing in perfect English if we needed places to
stay. "When Bill Clinton came to Prague, he
stayed here," one man said, proudly show
ing us on a postcard the proximity of his flat
to Clinton's hotel. When we declined his
offer, he shook our hands and lamented that
business was slow.
That I find hard to believe. Even in late
December, Prague swims with bohemian
expats and bewildered tourists. Wenceslas
Square, the sight of some of the most coura
geous pro-democracy demonstrations this
century, has become a poor man's Champs-
Elysdes, with American Express, Nina Ricci
and McDonald's dotting the sidewalks. I
stopped for a beer at a pub off the square,
and found David Robinson posters on the
wall and an American flag behind the bar
and a cheery waitress who hailed from
Spokane, Wash.
Split personalities aren't confined to the
East. Barcelona, for instance, swears fore
most allegiance not to Spain, but to the
region of Catalonia. When I visited in 1992

for the Olympics, nearly every balcony in
the city's Gothic Quarter was draped with
Catalonia's red- and gold-striped flag. This
time, the flags were gone, but a smug defi
ance still hung in the air.
