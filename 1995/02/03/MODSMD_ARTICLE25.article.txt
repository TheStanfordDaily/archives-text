Stanford 70

Never underestimate your
enemy.
The third-ranked Stanford
women's basketball team over
came a very sluggish start to
eventually defeat Oregon 70-57
last night in Eugene. Battling
through poor shooting,
turnovers and foul problems, the
Cardinal (17-1, 8-0 in the Pacific
10 Conference) used depth from
its bench to take control of the
game from the undermanned
Ducks (11-6, 4-4 Pac-10). The
constant substituting for Stan
ford resulted in the Cardinal
bench outscoring the Oregon
bench by 24 points, 31-7.
Playing essentially its same
lineup as last year, Stanford
pulled away towards the end of
the first half on the strength of
sophomore Kate Starbird's 13

points and outside shooting. The
Cardinal ended the half making
five of 10 three-point attempts.
Senior Kate Paye led the way,
hitting three of three shots from
behind the arc.
The Cardinal led by nine at
intermission, 41-32, despite
shooting 43 percent, eight per
cent below its season mark. Ore
gon made 42 percent of its
attempts during the first 20 min
utes.
In the second half, Stanford
used defense to clamp down on
the Ducks, holding Oregon to
25.8 percent shooting. The Cardi
nal outscored the Ducks, 29-25,
despite the fact that Starbird
picked up her fourth foul close to
midway through the half.
Starbird finished the game
with 18 points, five rebounds
and, more importantly, five
steals. The steals led to easy bas
kets for the Cardinal and came at
opportune times. Senior Rachel
Hemmer also played extended
minutes, eventually spending 31
on the court during which she
scored a season-high 13 points

and grabbed six rebounds
despite being saddled with four
fouls.
Senior Anita Kaplan recorded
a double double, scoring 11
points and snagging 10

rebounds in only 18 minutes.
Paye never left the floor, playing
40 minutes. She added 10 points
and led the team with three
assists.
Sophomore Jamila Wideman
made a sizable contribution for
the third consecutive game.
Wideman hit two treys at crucial
moments, finishing the game
with eight points.
