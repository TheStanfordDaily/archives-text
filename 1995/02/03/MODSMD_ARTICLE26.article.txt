# Men's hoops pulls out tough victory

Stanford 92
Oregon 87

It was an old-fashioned, blood and
guts Pacific 10 Conference shootout.
And when all the smoke cleared and
the dust settled, there was no doubt
who were the real sheriffs in town.
Stanford guards Dion Cross and
Brevin Knight, combining for 57
points, led a second-half surge against
Oregon to give the 17th-ranked Cardi
nal (14-3 overall, 5-3 Pac-10) a 92-87
victory.
"I don't know if I've seen a team
come in here and play a much better
game than Oregon played," said Cardi
nal head coach Mike Montgomery.
"We beat a good basketball team that
played great. This was a tough one.."
In the first half, the Ducks did all of
the draining, sinking 53 percent of
their shots from, the field and 55 per
cent of their three-pointers. Oregon
led by as many as 11 midway through
the first half, led not by their marquee
guards Kenya Wilkins and Orlando
Williams, but by forwards Damon
Runyon, Jeff Potter and Darryl Park
er. The three unknowns — Parker
came off the bench and Runyon wasn't
even scheduled to start — combined
for 23 points and 10-for-10 shooting.
"They did a great job in distributing
and moving the ball around. They
found other ways to get the job done,"
Mongtgomery said. "They had every
body involved. It's a nice scheme they
have."
Stanford hung tough though,
shooting a respectable 48 percent, and
was able to close the Oregon lead to
three by the half. Cross's 14 points and
Knight's nine led the Cardinal, but the
two were just wanning up.
Despite trailing by as much as 11
once again in the second half, Cross
and Knight found the hot hand, and

the game was as good as over.
With just over 10 minutes remain
ing and Stanford down by eight,
Knight blew by a squadron of
gawking Duck defenders and
cruised in for an easy lay-up. The
flood gates were open.
"Brevin gets me up just by him
screaming and hollering," Cross
said. "He's running the show, so I
feed off him more than anything
else."
Call it a feeding frenzy then.
On Stanford's next possession,
Cross, off of a dish from Knight,
nailed an NBA three. Soon after
wards, off of a feed from forward
Andy Poppink, the Cardinal
marksman buried another to close
the Duck lead to four.
"Once I get into that groove
you just want to keep going and
going," Cross said. "Sometimes,
you can't even stop. You saw it
tonight."
Oregon received some timely
foul calls, pumping the lead back
up. But after a Knight floating
jumper in the lane, another Cross
long-range bomb, and a lay-up
from center Tim Young, the lead
was down to one.
Then Knight had that look in
his eyes: he was hungry for some
duck pat 6. The Cardinal point

guard sliced through a mass of
Duck defenders and tossed up
what appeared to be a wild shot off
the very top of the backboard.
Swish.
"Sometimes the game just
comes to me in the second half,"
Knight said. "I'm trying to take
more of a leadership role, stepping
up and making plays. Whatever it
takes to win. "
The word unconscious now
comes to mind. Cross hit another
jumper from deep, but had his toe
on the line. So what happened?
Knight, usually the penetrator,
became the shooter and nailed a
trey.
Not about to be upstaged,
Cross sunk a running baseline
jumper to give Stanford an 81-76
lead. But Knight had the final
word in this friendly duel that
brought the Maples Pavilion
crowd to its feet. After driving
baseline for another eye-opening
lay-in, Knight pulled another trick
out of his ever-growing magic hat
with a dazzling crossover stop
and-pop. That marked the Cardi
nal's largest lead at 87-78, and
there was no looking back.
"We shot extremely well in the
second half," Montgomery said.
"Certainly Brevin and Dion com
ing alive was a big deal for us. The
one thing we tried to do in the sec
ond half, because they were over
playing everything, was give a lit
tle bit more freedom to Brevin, to

allow him to get in. Of course,
then he caught fire and that made
a huge difference for us. "
Glaringly absent from this
spectacular shooting exhibition
were Williams and Wilkins, whom
some observers thought were bet
ter than Cross and Knight. They
were wrong.
"We still have a lot of doubters
for some reason," Knight said. "I
don't know what to do. A lot of
people say, 'you guys are alright
but what about so and so.' If peo
ple are going to doubt us, we
have to come out a prove some
thing. "
Cross finished with a career
high 29 points to go along with
four assists and two steals. Knight
had 28 points, eight assists, two
steals and five rebounds. The two
combined to go for an ungodly 22-
for-38 from the field and five-for
six from three-point country.
On the other side, Wilkins, who
fouled out with three minutes, 29
seconds left in the game, had just
four points off of one-of-six shoot
ing. Williams had 16 points, but
converted only five-of-17. Basical
ly, they were a mess, and Stanford
wouldn't have it any other way.
"They're a long ways from
being a two man team, but it was
a priority for us to stop them,"
Montgomery said. "They've hurt
us too many times, but they found
other ways to get the job done."
But not quite enough ways.

their shots from, the field and 55 per
cent of their three-pointers. Oregon
led by as many as 11 midway through
the first half, led not by their marquee
guards Kenya Wilkins and Orlando
Williams, but by forwards Damon
Runyon, Jeff Potter and Darryl Park
er. The three unknowns — Parker
came off the bench and Runyon wasn't
even scheduled to start — combined
for 23 points and 10-for-10 shooting.
"They did a great job in distributing
and moving the ball around. They
found other ways to get the job done,"
Mongtgomery said. "They had every
body involved. It's a nice scheme they
have."
Stanford hung tough though,
shooting a respectable 48 percent, and
was able to close the Oregon lead to
three by the half. Cross's 14 points and
Knight's nine led the Cardinal, but the
two were just wanning up.

the game was as good as over.
With just over 10 minutes remain
ing and Stanford down by eight,
Knight blew by a squadron of
gawking Duck defenders and
cruised in for an easy lay-up. The
flood gates were open.
"Brevin gets me up just by him
screaming and hollering," Cross
said. "He's running the show, so I
feed off him more than anything
else."
Call it a feeding frenzy then.
On Stanford's next possession,
Cross, off of a dish from Knight,
nailed an NBA three. Soon after
wards, off of a feed from forward
Andy Poppink, the Cardinal
marksman buried another to close
the Duck lead to four.
"Once I get into that groove
you just want to keep going and
going," Cross said. "Sometimes,
you can't even stop. You saw it
tonight."
Oregon received some timely
foul calls, pumping the lead back
up. But after a Knight floating
jumper in the lane, another Cross
long-range bomb, and a lay-up
from center Tim Young, the lead
was down to one.
Then Knight had that look in
his eyes: he was hungry for some
duck pat 6. The Cardinal point

guard sliced through a mass of
Duck defenders and tossed up
what appeared to be a wild shot off
the very top of the backboard.
Swish.
"Sometimes the game just
comes to me in the second half,"
Knight said. "I'm trying to take
more of a leadership role, stepping
up and making plays. Whatever it
takes to win. "
The word unconscious now
comes to mind. Cross hit another
jumper from deep, but had his toe
on the line. So what happened?
Knight, usually the penetrator,
became the shooter and nailed a
trey.
Not about to be upstaged,
Cross sunk a running baseline
jumper to give Stanford an 81-76
lead. But Knight had the final
word in this friendly duel that
brought the Maples Pavilion
crowd to its feet. After driving
baseline for another eye-opening
lay-in, Knight pulled another trick
out of his ever-growing magic hat
with a dazzling crossover stop
and-pop. That marked the Cardi
nal's largest lead at 87-78, and
there was no looking back.
"We shot extremely well in the
second half," Montgomery said.
"Certainly Brevin and Dion com
ing alive was a big deal for us. The
one thing we tried to do in the sec
ond half, because they were over
playing everything, was give a lit
tle bit more freedom to Brevin, to

allow him to get in. Of course,
then he caught fire and that made
a huge difference for us. "
Glaringly absent from this
spectacular shooting exhibition
were Williams and Wilkins, whom
some observers thought were bet
ter than Cross and Knight. They
were wrong.
"We still have a lot of doubters
for some reason," Knight said. "I
don't know what to do. A lot of
people say, 'you guys are alright
but what about so and so.' If peo
ple are going to doubt us, we
have to come out a prove some
thing. "
Cross finished with a career
high 29 points to go along with
four assists and two steals. Knight
had 28 points, eight assists, two
steals and five rebounds. The two
combined to go for an ungodly 22-
for-38 from the field and five-for
six from three-point country.
On the other side, Wilkins, who
fouled out with three minutes, 29
seconds left in the game, had just
four points off of one-of-six shoot
ing. Williams had 16 points, but
converted only five-of-17. Basical
ly, they were a mess, and Stanford
wouldn't have it any other way.
"They're a long ways from
being a two man team, but it was
a priority for us to stop them,"
Montgomery said. "They've hurt
us too many times, but they found
other ways to get the job done."
But not quite enough ways.
