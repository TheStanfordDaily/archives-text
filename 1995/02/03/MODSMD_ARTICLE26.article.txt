Stanford 92
Oregon 87

It was an old-fashioned, blood and
guts Pacific 10 Conference shootout.
And when all the smoke cleared and
the dust settled, there was no doubt
who were the real sheriffs in town.
Stanford guards Dion Cross and
Brevin Knight, combining for 57
points, led a second-half surge against
Oregon to give the 17th-ranked Cardi
nal (14-3 overall, 5-3 Pac-10) a 92-87
victory.
"I don't know if I've seen a team
come in here and play a much better
game than Oregon played," said Cardi

"We beat a good basketball team that
played great. This was a tough one.."
In the first half, the Ducks did all of

their shots from, the field and 55 per
cent of their three-pointers. Oregon
led by as many as 11 midway through
the first half, led not by their marquee
guards Kenya Wilkins and Orlando
Williams, but by forwards Damon
Runyon, Jeff Potter and Darryl Park
er. The three unknowns — Parker
came off the bench and Runyon wasn't
even scheduled to start — combined
for 23 points and 10-for-10 shooting.
"They did a great job in distributing
and moving the ball around. They
found other ways to get the job done,"
Mongtgomery said. "They had every
body involved. It's a nice scheme they
have."
Stanford hung tough though,
shooting a respectable 48 percent, and
was able to close the Oregon lead to
three by the half. Cross's 14 points and
Knight's nine led the Cardinal, but the
two were just wanning up.
Despite trailing by as much as 11
once again in the second half, Cross
and Knight found the hot hand, and
