# Dynamic duo leads second-half effort

### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Caught in the middle of the frenzied Pacific 10
Conference race with identical 4-3 league records,
No. 17 Stanford and No. 22 Oregon both entered
Maples Pavilion last night with something to
prove.
For the Ducks, after an upset victory over
UCLA to open the Pac-10 season, three losses in
the last four games had soured their confidence.
For the Cardinal, a three-point loss to UCLA last
week had again brought Stanford close to the big
win without capturing it.
After the first 10 minutes, the proof had found
a place on the Oregon sideline as the Ducks

jumped out to a 24-13 lead. Fending off Stanford
runs several times over the next 20 minutes, Ore
gon seemed to have all the answers with a series
of clutch free throws and offensive put-backs as
they maintained the lead until the six minute, 50
second mark of the second half.
"Every time we tried to make a mini-run, they
came up with the defensive stop or hit a couple
free throws," said head coach Mike Montgomery.
"I didn't know if we'd ever get ahead."
Twice Stanford cut the Oregon lead to one,
but both times the Cardinal saw the Ducks
extend the lead back to double digits. Down 65-54
with just over 11 minutes left, the duo of Dion
Cross and Brevin Knight ignited what seemed
like the final run left in the Cardinal tanks.

"They could have just blown us out, put us
away [in the first half]," Knight said.
However, three Cross three-pointers and two
Knight jumpers catapulted the Cardinal into the
lead at 74-73 with just under seven minutes left.
After a Tim Young lay-up, Stanford's two guards
erupted for 10 more points to take a five-point
lead.
"We wanted to give Brevin more freedom in
the second half," Montgomery said. "Then he
caught fire and that was the difference for us."
Combining for 57 points on the night, Cross
and Knight accounted for 34 of the last 46 Cardi
nal points. Helped by a 61.8 percent shooting clip
in the second half, Stanford ended
the game shooting 55.9 percent
overall, a season-high.
Coming into the game, the
showdown between Cross and
Knight and Oregon's two guards,
Orlando Williams and Kenya
Wilkins, had both backcourts
looking to prove their mettle.
Holding the Duck guards to a
combined 6-for-23 shooting and
only 20 points, the Cardinal effort
was helped by Wilkins' foul trou
ble.
Wilkins, aggressive in the first
half defending Knight, picked up
his fourth foul with 13:27 left in
the second half and watched his
team's lead dissolve as he rode
the bench. Knight quickly stole
the ball from back-up Duck guard
Jon Mitchell for an easy lay-up,
but the Cardinal sophomore
would have preferred to work his
magic against the lightning-fast
Wilkins rather than Mitchell, a
walk-on.
"I had something to prove and
I'm not going to do that with him
on the bench," Knight said.
Oregon tied the score twice
after relinquishing the lead but
never got back into an offensive
rhythm. After the 9:45 mark in
the second half, the Ducks failed
to score a field goal.
