# Dynamic duo leads second-half effort

Caught in the middle of the frenzied Pacific 10
Conference race with identical 4-3 league records,
No. 17 Stanford and No. 22 Oregon both entered
Maples Pavilion last night with something to
prove.
For the Ducks, after an upset victory over
UCLA to open the Pac-10 season, three losses in
the last four games had soured their confidence.
For the Cardinal, a three-point loss to UCLA last
week had again brought Stanford close to the big
win without capturing it.
After the first 10 minutes, the proof had found
a place on the Oregon sideline as the Ducks

jumped out to a 24-13 lead. Fending off Stanford
runs several times over the next 20 minutes, Ore
gon seemed to have all the answers with a series
of clutch free throws and offensive put-backs as
they maintained the lead until the six minute, 50
second mark of the second half.
"Every time we tried to make a mini-run, they
came up with the defensive stop or hit a couple
free throws," said head coach Mike Montgomery.
"I didn't know if we'd ever get ahead."
Twice Stanford cut the Oregon lead to one,
but both times the Cardinal saw the Ducks
extend the lead back to double digits. Down 65-54
with just over 11 minutes left, the duo of Dion
Cross and Brevin Knight ignited what seemed
like the final run left in the Cardinal tanks.

"They could have just blown us out, put us
away [in the first half]," Knight said.
However, three Cross three-pointers and two
Knight jumpers catapulted the Cardinal into the
lead at 74-73 with just under seven minutes left.
After a Tim Young lay-up, Stanford's two guards
erupted for 10 more points to take a five-point
lead.
"We wanted to give Brevin more freedom in
the second half," Montgomery said. "Then he
caught fire and that was the difference for us."
Combining for 57 points on the night, Cross
and Knight accounted for 34 of the last 46 Cardi
nal points. Helped by a 61.8 percent shooting clip
