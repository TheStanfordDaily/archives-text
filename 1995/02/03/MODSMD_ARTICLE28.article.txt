# Cardinal men must now face OSU
## 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Oregon State's men's basketball
team is quite the brain teaser. For a
team that has two 20-point scorers, its
6-11 record may seem somewhat
pathetic. Yet they have won two of their
last three, and those two victories have
come against conference powerhouses
Arizona State and California. So, sim
ply put, are they good or not?
Stanford (14-3 overall, 5-3 Pacific 10
Conference) comes into Saturday
night's contest against the Beavers (fi
ll overall, 3-5 Pac-10) with a simple
answer.
"Oregon State is good enough to

beat you," said Cardinal head coach
Mike Montgomery.
The Cardinal comes into the game
after a hard-fought victory versus the
No. 22 Oregon Ducks, and similar to
the UCLA-USC series last week, needs
to be certain that no lapse occurs in its
play against a somewhat less-touted
Beaver team.
"Once again, it's just imperative we
win at home and have a good perfor
mance," said Montgomery. "We can't
have any slip-ups,"
But why have the Beavers them
selves at times been such slip-ups?
They have two of the league's top play
ers in talented forwards Brent Rariy
and Mustapha Hoff, both averaging

over 20 points.
"Brent Barry is really a skilled play
er with a great feel for the game," said
Montgomery. "He's capable of having
big games and creating lots of problems
for people because of his explosion to
the basket and his passing ability.
"Mustapha Hoff has proven to be a
very, very good inside player. He's
strong and they go to him, give him the
ball real low. He too has proven to be a
guy that's scored lots of points."
To OSU's defense, they have played
a few teams tight and did post an upset
against the then 13th-ranked Sun Dev
ils and last night's 76-67 versus the
Bears.
"They've been close," said Mont
gomery. "They were ahead at Wash
ington State late. They were ahead
at home against UCLA late. They've
played some people tough. They just
haven't been able to win."
But why not? Barry, a lanky six
foot-six 185-pounder, is having his
best season ever. He was forced to
play the power forward hist season
because of OSU's lack of depth, but
has since returned to his more natu
ral small forward position.
"He's good," said Stanford for
ward Andy Poppink. "He's a tricky
player, kind of fun to watch."
OSU has found a true power for
ward in every sense of the word this
season in the six-foot-seven, 230-
rx)und HofT. HofT'missed last season

recovering from back surgery but
has come back with a vengeance.
After "Bones" and HofT though,
there's not much left. Beaver guard
Stephane Brown chips in with his
12.9 ppg, but consistent gamebreak
ing is not his forte. He and his start
ing backcourt mate freshman Rob
Williams should have their hands
full with Cardinal guards Brevin
Knight and Dion Cross. Six-foot
seven OSU center Vladimir Heredia
is also likely to be outmatched by
seven-foot-one Cardinal Tim
Young.
"The other guys are not at the
level of Barry and Hoff," Mont
gomery said. "Or it may just be that
that they're not looking for them to
score as much. Those other guys
may be more of role-players."
So the riddle of the Beaver
remains. The Cardinal, though, is
well aware that OSU may discover
the answer any day now, so nothing
will be taken for granted.
