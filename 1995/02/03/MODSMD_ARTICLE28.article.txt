# Cardinal men must now face OSU
## 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Oregon State's men's basketball
team is quite the brain teaser. For a
team that has two 20-point scorers, its
6-11 record may seem somewhat
pathetic. Yet they have won two of their
last three, and those two victories have
come against conference powerhouses
Arizona State and California. So, sim
ply put, are they good or not?
Stanford (14-3 overall, 5-3 Pacific 10
Conference) comes into Saturday
night's contest against the Beavers (fi
ll overall, 3-5 Pac-10) with a simple
answer.
"Oregon State is good enough to

beat you," said Cardinal head coach
Mike Montgomery.
The Cardinal comes into the game
after a hard-fought victory versus the
No. 22 Oregon Ducks, and similar to
the UCLA-USC series last week, needs
to be certain that no lapse occurs in its
play against a somewhat less-touted
Beaver team.
"Once again, it's just imperative we
win at home and have a good perfor
mance," said Montgomery. "We can't
have any slip-ups,"
But why have the Beavers them
selves at times been such slip-ups?
They have two of the league's top play
ers in talented forwards Brent Rariy
and Mustapha Hoff, both averaging

over 20 points.
"Brent Barry is really a skilled play
er with a great feel for the game," said
Montgomery. "He's capable of having
big games and creating lots of problems
for people because of his explosion to
the basket and his passing ability.
"Mustapha Hoff has proven to be a
very, very good inside player. He's
strong and they go to him, give him the
ball real low. He too has proven to be a
guy that's scored lots of points."
To OSU's defense, they have played
a few teams tight and did post an upset
against the then 13th-ranked Sun Dev
ils and last night's 76-67 versus the
