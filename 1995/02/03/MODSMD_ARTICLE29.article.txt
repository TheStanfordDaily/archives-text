### Ratha Harntha Staff writer 
Coming off one of its biggest victories ever, the
Stanford wrestling team meets Fresno State in
Burnham Pavilion on Friday and competes in the
All-California Tournament in San Francisco on Sat
urday.
"Beating Oregon was a pretty big deal," said head
coach Chris Horpel. "I wish we were completely
healthy so that we could continue to surprise some
of the" fully-funded teams. [The injuries] threw a
wrench in our momentum."
Last weekend was the healthiest the Cardinal
had been all year, with all 10 starters ready to com
pete against Oregon State on Saturday and able to
pull off the upset of Oregon Sunday. The victory
marked the second time Stanford had ever beaten
the fully-funded Ducks.
The Cardinal (3-3 overall, 3-2 in the Pacific 10
Conference) will face a similar challenge in Fresno
State. Stanford has only been able to tie the Bull
dogs once in the last four years.
"(Friday's meet] will be our toughest dual so far,"


Curtis Chen â€” Daily file
Senior co-captain Jay Jackson, dominating his Cal Poly opponent ear
lier this year, hopes to come out on top against Fresno State tonight.
Horpel said. "They have their best
team in years and years. They are
very strong at all weights. We'll
have to pull some upsets to win."
Recent injuries will not help.
Undefeated co-captain Jimmy
Aguirre has been suffering from the

flu and has not practiced all week.
Freshman heavyweight Mark
Neglay has a skin condition and will
not be able to compete this week.
Thus, the Cardinal will have to for
feit the heavyweight match, giving
the Bulldogs six points before the
meet even starts.
"We've got a lot of work to do,"
said junior Matt Cano. "But if we
wrestled like we did 112 against Oregon
and Oregon State!, we'll have a
shot. IFresno State] is the best in

the [Western Athletic Conferencel."
According to Horpel, the key for
the Cardinal will be to string togeth
er wins in its stronger weight class
es, the 126-pound to the 158-pound
divisions. The Cardinal was able to
accomplish this against Oregon
State but did not build a big enough
lead and eventually fell, 26-18.
The 126-pound Cano and either
Aguirre or senior co-captain Jay
Jackson will wrestle in key matches.
Both Aguirre and Jackson have

wrestled 134-pound Bulldog
Dewayne Zincon and both lost by a
point. Cano has come close to beat
ing his opponent, Nick Zincon, but
has not been able to hold on for the
win.
"A lot of matches will be really
close," Aguirre said. "[The meet is]
going to be a tough one."
After the dual meet against
the Bulldogs, the Cardinal will
come right back and compete in
the All Cal Tournament. Of the

seven teams competing in the
tournament, Cal State Bakers
field and Fresno State are the
favorites.
"Hopefully we'll upset one of the
two or we'll be right behind," Hor
pel said. "If we're wrestling well,
we'll be in the top three."
Cano, Aguirre, Jackson, juniors
Tod Surmon and Sahlan Martin,
and sophomore Bryan Vaniman
should have strong showings,
according to Horpel. Jackson and

Aguirre will both wrestle at 134-lbs.
and will probably have to face Zin
con along the way.
"I hope we keep our confidence
up," Surmon said. "People with lit
tle experience have been thrown
into matches and have been
wrestling well."
Aguirre is looking forward to the
tournament. "We have our
strongest team in a couple of years,"
he said. "I expect to do better than
we have done in the past."
