Coming off one of its biggest victories ever, the
Stanford wrestling team meets Fresno State in
Burnham Pavilion on Friday and competes in the
All-California Tournament in San Francisco on Sat
urday.
"Beating Oregon was a pretty big deal," said head
coach Chris Horpel. "I wish we were completely
healthy so that we could continue to surprise some
of the" fully-funded teams. [The injuries] threw a
wrench in our momentum."
Last weekend was the healthiest the Cardinal
had been all year, with all 10 starters ready to com
pete against Oregon State on Saturday and able to
pull off the upset of Oregon Sunday. The victory
marked the second time Stanford had ever beaten
the fully-funded Ducks.
The Cardinal (3-3 overall, 3-2 in the Pacific 10
Conference) will face a similar challenge in Fresno
State. Stanford has only been able to tie the Bull
dogs once in the last four years.
"(Friday's meet] will be our toughest dual so far,"
