## Student to rate campus health 
### Marc Lee Staff writer 
How would you rate your health today?
This is one of several questions that third-year
medical student Alexandra Mazard hopes to answer
in a new survey on student health and health ser
vices.
Mazard, working with Cowell Student Health
Center, will examine students' health status, as well
as their satisfaction with and use of health services
at Stanford.
With the study results, "we can see what we can
do to increase people's satisfaction" in the future,
Mazard said.
The questionnaire, which will be mailed in mid-
February, is the first of its kind at Stanford.
In part, the survey will quantify the frequency
with which campus health resources are used. It will
also ask qualitative questions, such as how students
are treated as patients by Cowell doctors.
Cowell's director, Ira Friedman, said that a study
of this type is "the best way to plan health services."
Cowell has already conducted studies on topics such
as stress, sexuality and alcohol and drug use. "Those
studies in the past have helped us in designing ser
vices," he explained.
"The results will be useful in terms of providing
student services both within Cowell and University
wide," said investigator Barbara Arnoldussen, direc
tor of quality management at Cowell.
The health center will use the results as part of an
ongoing review process to identify areas for possible
improvement and for future planning, Friedman
said.
Mazard will also use the data to compare groups
of different socio-economic status and ethnic back
ground to help pinpoint any disparities among
groups on campus. The comparisons will allow in
vestigators "to identify what groups might need bet
ter targeting for different programs," Mazard said.
She noted that national studies comparing health
status among races have indicated that some condi
tions, such as heart disease, are more prevalent
among ethnic minorities.
Mazard said she hopes her study will go further in
discovering whether there are explanations that go
deeper than ethnicity itself. "Is it really the race or is
it their (the ethnic minority's)
position in life? " she asked.
The survey has been in the
planning stages since August and
will be mailed to 1,500 under

graduate and 1,500 graduate stu
dents.
Focus groups of medical stu
dents, undergraduates and stu
dent advisers for Cowell cri
tiqued the survey during its
refining stages and estimate
that it will take 10 to 20 min
utes to complete the question
naire.
