# Baseball takes on Fullerton
## Reed looks for revenge against Titans 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
It may only be February, but the col
lege baseball season is already heating up
as top-ranked Stanford takes on No. 15
Cal State-Fullerton in a three game
series over the weekend.
The Cardinal, 2-0 after sweeping a
home series with the St. Mary's Gaels,
will travel to Fullerton to clash with the
Titans starting tonight at 7 p.m.
'"We're ranked No. 1 but nobody real
ly mentions it or acts like we're No. 1,"
Stanford's ace pitcher, Dan Reed, said.
"We're just looking forward to playing
baseball and getting into the season."
Cal State-Fullerton (1-0) comes off
one of the most impressive seasons in
school history, finishing ranked No. 3 in
the nation according to Baseball America
and capturing the Big West Conference
Championship a year ago. The Titans
posted a spectacular record of 47-16 and
advanced to the College World Series in
1994.
Even with the loss of their entire
starting rotation and six of the nine
starting position players from a year ago,
Fullerton Sta*e is the preseason favorite
to edge out Long Beach State and repeat
as Big West Conference champs. They
may not be the same team which man
handled Louisiana State University and
Florida State in last year's College World
Series, but the Titans are still a force to
be reckoned with.
"We had a large turnover in personnel
from last year and we have a lot of
curiosity about our team," Fullerton
State assistant coach George Horton
said. "You know that both teams [Stan
ford and Fullerton] will be in contention
for post-season play with a shot at the
national championship and this series
should give us an indication of how we
stand."
No less than seven players on
