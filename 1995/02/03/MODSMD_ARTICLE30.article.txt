# Baseball takes on Fullerton
## Reed looks for revenge against Titans 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
It may only be February, but the col
lege baseball season is already heating up
as top-ranked Stanford takes on No. 15
Cal State-Fullerton in a three game
series over the weekend.
The Cardinal, 2-0 after sweeping a
home series with the St. Mary's Gaels,
will travel to Fullerton to clash with the
Titans starting tonight at 7 p.m.
'"We're ranked No. 1 but nobody real
ly mentions it or acts like we're No. 1,"
Stanford's ace pitcher, Dan Reed, said.
"We're just looking forward to playing
baseball and getting into the season."
Cal State-Fullerton (1-0) comes off
one of the most impressive seasons in
school history, finishing ranked No. 3 in
the nation according to Baseball America
and capturing the Big West Conference
Championship a year ago. The Titans
posted a spectacular record of 47-16 and
advanced to the College World Series in
1994.
Even with the loss of their entire
starting rotation and six of the nine
starting position players from a year ago,
Fullerton Sta*e is the preseason favorite
to edge out Long Beach State and repeat
as Big West Conference champs. They
may not be the same team which man
handled Louisiana State University and
Florida State in last year's College World
Series, but the Titans are still a force to
be reckoned with.
"We had a large turnover in personnel
from last year and we have a lot of
curiosity about our team," Fullerton
State assistant coach George Horton
said. "You know that both teams [Stan
ford and Fullerton] will be in contention
for post-season play with a shot at the
national championship and this series
should give us an indication of how we
stand."
No less than seven players on

Sophomore Chris Clark makes a throw in the
home opener against St. Mary's last week.
Fullerton's 1994 roster were draft
ed in the June amateur draft and
have moved on to professional base
ball, including second team Ail-
American Jeff Ferguson. The
Titans lost four .300 or better hit
ters and three more pitchers who
posted at least 10 wins last season.
But, where other teams need to
rebuild, the Titans simply hope to
reload.
"We may not have the same tal
ent in terms of high-profile major
league prospects," Horton said.
"But we still think we're pretty
good and we're excited to see how
we'll improve this season. Our best
baseball is ahead of us, that's for
sure."
In head coach Augie Garrido's
19 years at the helm of Fullerton
State, the Titans have amassed an
impressive 829-366 record, good

enough for a .690 winning percent
age. Their 1995 roster is again rid
dled with talent — albeit unproven
— as the Titans welcome an incred
ible 22 newcomers from high
schools and junior colleges.
Sophomore outfielder Mark
Kotsay — who hit .372 with four
home runs and 35 RBIs last year
while also making 10 pitching
appearances — leads the list of
returnees. In addition, junior Ted
Silva should anchor a young pitch
ing staff after posting 13 saves and
a 2.29 earned run average in 1994.
Silva will start for Titans
tonight, facing off against the Reed.
Reed is already 1-0 on the year with
a perfect 0.00 ERA after a strong
performance on opening day. That
outing was much different from
last year's opener. Reed ended up
on the short end of a 12-2 Fullerton
State win at Sunken Diamond.
"We played these guys last year
and they knocked me out pretty
early," Reed said. "The coaches and
I have been joking that it's time to
pay them back."

Saturday's match-up features
Fullerton State junior Jon Ward —
who held opposing hitters to just a
.195 average a year ago — against
Jason Middlebrook, Stanford's
hard-throwing right-hander. On
Sunday afternoon Tim Dixon, a
transfer from the University of
Arkansas at Little Rock, will take
the mound for the Titans versus
the Cardinal's Todd Bartels. Both
of the weekend games are slated for
1 p.m. starts.
Stanford owns a slim 21-20 edge
in the all-time series between the
two schools, but the Titans have
won six of the last nine meetings,
including two of three a year ago at
Sunken Diamond. In 1994, Stan
ford managed to play just .500 ball
against non-conference opponents
and will be looking to improve that
figure early in 1995.
"We played really poorly outside
of our conference last year," Reed
said. "We lost some games that we
had no business losing. That's defi
nitely something we're going to try
to improve this year."
