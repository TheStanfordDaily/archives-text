# No. 1 women seeking 50th consecutive win
## Stanford heads to Texas

Fifty and 0.
If the top-ranked Stanford
women's swimming team beats
fifth-ranked Southerr Methodist
University today in Texas, the

team can extend its dual-meet
winning streak to span seven
years and an unprecedented 50
meets in a row. Ironically, the last
time Stanford lost a dual meet, it
was to the University of Texas in
1988. If the Cardinal beat the No.
9 Longhorns on Saturday, num

ber 51 may be even sweeter than
50.
Friday looks to be a tougher
challenge for the Cardinal with
SMU packing some potent indi
vidual performers. Ail-American
sprint freestyler Gitta Jensen
could be a real threat to Stan
ford's sprint free powerhouse,
lead by sophomore Claudia Fran
co and senior Jenny Thompson.
However, Thompson and Franco
have both posted faster times
than Jensen this year.
"SMU always worries me
because there is nothing they
would rather do than knock us
[Stanford! off in a dual meet,"
said Cardinal head coach Richard
Quick.
The Mustangs are also strong
in the butterfly and diving events
with the defending NCAA cham
pions in the 200-yard butterfly,
Berit Puggaard, and the one
meter diving competition, Cheril
Santini.
Senior co-captain Becky
Crowe, who was second to Pug
gaard in the 200-yard butterfly at
the national championship meet
last year, anticipates a tight con
test. "It'll be a great tune-up for
the NCAA Championships to

the NCAA Championships to swim
Puggaard this weekend," she said.
The Longhorns also have some
strong individual performers, and
they finished second at the NCAA
championship meet last year. With
the 1994 National Diver of the Year
Robin Carter and two returning
NCAA individual champions, there
could be some close races in Austin
as well.
"Texas is a little down from what
they have been in the past, but they
are a proud program," Quick said.
"Going into their pool will represent
quite a challenge for us."
Though SMU and Texas swim
mers have posted some potent indi
vidual times, the Cardinal is swim

ming faster than any team in the
country right now. Barcelona
Olympian Thompson has already
qualified for the NCAA champi
onship meet in five events.
Franco, a member of the 1992
Spanish Olympic team, rounds out
the sprint free attack with times
good enough to beat the top sprint
ers for the Longhorns and Mus
tangs this weekend.
Stanford also boasts individual
standouts Sarah Anderson (in the
distance freestyle), Becky Crowe (in
the 200-yard butterfly) and Eileen
Richetelli (in the one and three
meter diving events). However, the
key to its recent success has been
depth.
Freshmen such as Becky Bick
nell and Lindsay Gassner have post
ed NCAA championship provisional
qualifying times as well. A provi
sional qualifying time is essentially
a cut-off time marginally slower

than the qualifying time. The
NCAA will take provisional quali
fiers if enough swimmers do not
make the faster cut off.
"The depth in our sprint
freestyle program is the best that I
have had as a coach," Quick said.
"Sprint free is so imperative in any
intercollegiate program, and we
have eight people who are quality
sprint free people."
Saturday's meet also serves as a
homecoming for Quick, since his
last coaching job was with the
Longhorns. Quick coached Texas
for six years, 1983-1988, and he cap
tured five national championship
titles for Texas before coming to
Stanford
"The whole weekend is like a
homecoming for me. SMU is my
alma mater, and much of my family
lives in Texas," Quick said. "Howev
er, the main reason to go down
there is to swim quality teams."
