If the top-ranked Stanford
women's swimming team beats
fifth-ranked Southerr Methodist

Santini.
Senior co-captain Becky
Crowe, who was second to Pug
gaard in the 200-yard butterfly at
the national championship meet
last year, anticipates a tight con
test. "It'll be a great tune-up for
the NCAA Championships to
