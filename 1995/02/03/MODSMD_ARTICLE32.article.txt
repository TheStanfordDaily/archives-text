Stanford men's volleyball faces
a strikeout if it fails to connect on
three items in league-opening play
this weekend versus UC-San Diego
and San Diego State University. It
must: keep a competitive edge
despite its No. 2 ranking, regain its
sharp play from two weeks ago and
execute better on serve-receive.
"This is a young team," said
coach Ruben Nieves. "I hope they
understand the concept that
nobody rolls over [in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation].
We don't want to be an early
upset victim."
The Cardinal will especially
have to heed these words this
weekend as neither the Tritons
nor the Aztecs have any wins in
league play thus far. By paying too
much attention to this facts, Stan
ford could be caught off-guard.
"We're not too worried about
UCSD," said sophomore middle
blocker Brian Moore. "But we're
definitely not overlooking them
because they beat our second
string."

upped its play after the defeat and
went on to take second place at the
tournament.
"After the tournament we won
two matches [versus UCSC and
Penn State]," Nieves said, "but we
weren't as sharp as we wanted to
be. The question is whether we can
pick our play back up to the level
we were at in the UCSB tourna
ment."
Nieves feels that the Cardinal
played well in that tournament
based on the strength of its serve
receive. Serve-reception remains
the biggest question mark for this
powerful offensive team. Up until
now, Stanford has maintained a
strong sideout game with a torrid
offense, as Ail-American outside
hitters junior Mike lumber! and

sophomore Matt Fuerbringer rank
among the strongest hitters in the
country. However, the Cardinal's
fate for this weekend, and for the
rest of the season, rests on its abili
ty to pass the ball.
"Our serve-reception hasn't
been good enough even in games we
have won," Nieves said. "We've
made up for it with our hitting, but
we have to especially eliminate the
high number of aces we allow."
One area in which the Cardinal
should draw a strong performance
from this weekend is setting.
Sophomore Stewart Chong has
stepped in for graduated Ail-Ameri
can Canyon Ceman and excelled at
the position, earning one of six
spots on the all-tournament team
at the 24-team Santa Barbara tour
nament.
"The nice thing is that I have
really strong hitters all around
me," Chong said. "They can make
me look good; I just have to put the
ball up so they can use their tal

ents."
Perhaps Chong's only deficiency
is his height: he is listed at 5-foot-10
in a league where 6-5 is considered
an average height. Chong's block
ing abilities will be put to the test
against the Aztecs and their pre
mier outside hitter senior John
Hyden. A first-team Ail-American
last year who also led the country in
kills per game, Hyden is San Diego
State's most potent weapon.
"They move him all around,"
Chong said. "He can hit from all
angles, from anywhere on the
court, like Lambert and Fuer
bringer. If I'm matched up against
him, that's just something I'll have
to deal with."
However, if the Aztecs attempt
to attack Chong, their plan could
backfire because Nieves maintains
that Chong is a deceptively good
blocker.
"This will be a test for us,"
Nieves said. "Can we go on the road
and come back with two wins?"
