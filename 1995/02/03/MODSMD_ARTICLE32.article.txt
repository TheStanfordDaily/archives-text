Stanford men's volleyball faces
a strikeout if it fails to connect on
three items in league-opening play
this weekend versus UC-San Diego
and San Diego State University. It
must: keep a competitive edge
despite its No. 2 ranking, regain its
sharp play from two weeks ago and
execute better on serve-receive.
"This is a young team," said
coach Ruben Nieves. "I hope they
understand the concept that
nobody rolls over [in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation].
We don't want to be an early
upset victim."
The Cardinal will especially
have to heed these words this
weekend as neither the Tritons
nor the Aztecs have any wins in
league play thus far. By paying too
much attention to this facts, Stan
ford could be caught off-guard.
"We're not too worried about
UCSD," said sophomore middle
blocker Brian Moore. "But we're
definitely not overlooking them
because they beat our second
string."
The Cardinal lost to the Tritons
in the first round of the UC-Santa
Barbara Collegiate Invitational
tournament two weeks ago. How
ever, the unfazed Stanford squad
