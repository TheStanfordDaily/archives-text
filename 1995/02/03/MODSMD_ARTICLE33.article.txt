# Swimmers to duel with that other private school
## Cardinal takes on No. 7 Trojans 
### John Fabian Contributing writer 
Here come the Trojans, the mighty,
mighty Trojans.
The second-ranked Cardinal men's
swim team will take on UC-Santa Barbara
Friday at 1 p.m. in what should amount to
a warm-up for Saturday's big meet against
No. 7 University of Southern California at
noon. And when they leave deGuerre Pool,
the Cardinal xpects to watch its foes limp
away a little less mightily.
This is the first meet with the Gauchos
in what will probably become a regularly
scheduled match-up, taking UClA's place
on the Cardinal's schedule after the Bruins'
program was cut by the National Collegiate

Athletic Association last year. Stanford does
not perceive a great threat from UCSB Fri
day afternoon.
"UCSB provides a chance for individual
challenges," said senior co-captain Clay Tip
pins. "They don't really provide a team
challenge, but they give each person a
chance to improve themselves. Any time
you have a chance to race you can improve."
Swimmers and coaches agree that the
meet gives the Cardinal an opportunity to
practice putting things together for i. s
still yet to come.
"There's no substitute for racing," said
assistant coach Ted Knapp. "They give as
an opportunity to race, and a chance to pre
pare and rehearse. You can't pass up an
opportunity to stand up on the blocks and

get ready physically and mentally."
As for the meet with USC, this is one
swimming fans won't want to miss. The
Trojans are a solid team that competes well
in dual meets, providing a serious challenge
that the Cardinal will embrace. According
to Knapp, they pose as great a threat as toj>
ranked Michigan, one of which Stanford
will have to be wary.
"(The Trojans 1 have a great lineup," Tip
pins added. "Their strength is evenly dis
tributed â€” they don't have any weak
events. And that's what makes them a
tough team to beat."
Each individual swimmer and each
relay team will have to compete solidly in
