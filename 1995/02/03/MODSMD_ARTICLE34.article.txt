Displaying more confidence than the
San Francisco 49ers showed before Super
Bowl XXIX, a strong Stanford fencing
team heads south to duel with eight Cali
fornia rivals at a weekend tournament in
San Diego.
Bolstered by experienced veterans and
a freshman phenom, the men's and
women's teams look to sweep their week
end matches. Challenging the Cardinal
fencers will be Long Beach State, Cal State
Fullerton, UC-San Diego, UCLA, Univer
sity of Southern (California, California,
San Jose State and UC-Santa Cruz. As a
symbol of his confidence in Stanford,
men's coach Zoran Tulum predicted that
the entire Cardinal roster will compete

over the weekend.
Although the NCAA no longer spon
sors team national championships, this
weekend's bouts remain important for
team members' individual records. The
NCAA continues to host individual
national championships for three men's
events (epee, foil and sabre) and two
women's events (epee and foil, â€” women
can compete in epee for the first time this
year). Qualifying measures for nationals
are individual record, quality of opponents
and the results of the Western Regional
Qualifying Tournament.
"It will be nice to let the entire squad
feel the pressure of competition," said
