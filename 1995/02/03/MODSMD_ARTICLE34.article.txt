# Fencers on warpath

Displaying more confidence than the
San Francisco 49ers showed before Super
Bowl XXIX, a strong Stanford fencing
team heads south to duel with eight Cali
fornia rivals at a weekend tournament in
San Diego.
Bolstered by experienced veterans and
a freshman phenom, the men's and
women's teams look to sweep their week
end matches. Challenging the Cardinal
fencers will be Long Beach State, Cal State
Fullerton, UC-San Diego, UCLA, Univer
sity of Southern (California, California,
San Jose State and UC-Santa Cruz. As a
symbol of his confidence in Stanford,
men's coach Zoran Tulum predicted that
the entire Cardinal roster will compete

over the weekend.
Although the NCAA no longer spon
sors team national championships, this
weekend's bouts remain important for
team members' individual records. The
NCAA continues to host individual
national championships for three men's
events (epee, foil and sabre) and two
women's events (epee and foil, â€” women
can compete in epee for the first time this
year). Qualifying measures for nationals
are individual record, quality of opponents
and the results of the Western Regional
Qualifying Tournament.
"It will be nice to let the entire squad
feel the pressure of competition," said
Tulum, noting that Stanford will
meet Cal State-Fullerton twice this
weekend as a favor to the Titans.
"Each school needs to fence nine
matches in order to send fencers to
Western Regionals."
As there will only be nine schools
in attendance this weekend, Fuller
ton, who cannot afford to travel to
national tournaments, would only
get eight matches were it not for
Stanford's generosity. Consequent
ly, "the first time we fence them,
we'll use our best squad, and the
second time, maybe we'll put some
other fish in the water," Tulum
said.
The strength of Stanford's fenc
ing program lies in its men's foil and
the women's epee teams. Freshman
Sean McClain leads the foilists on
the men's side. Although Tulum

noted that McClain is a "senior
national champion [meaning the 20
years and older division! in epee, I
want him to win the NCAA champi
onship in men's foil this year."
The women are led by epee team
standouts Morgan Hoch and
Stephanie Wien, both of whom
should have no trouble with the
California competition. Hoch is
coming off a strong performance at
a United States Fencing Association
tournament. At the tournament,
she placed in the top 32 in a field of
over 150 fencers, losing 15-14 to two
members of the U.S. National Team
in double-elimination competition.
Wien also fenced well in San Fran
cisco, despite being hampered by the
effects of an off-season knee opera
tion.
Tulum notes that his two epee
specialists both have an excellent
chance to qualify for the NCAA
national tournament, as could two
of his men's foilists. However, the
limit of two fencers per school to go

to nationals in each event could pro
vide an obstacle for many of Stan
ford's hopefuls.
Tulum is clearly optimistic about
the team's chances this weekend.
"Our program is now a level above
other programs on the West Coast,"
he said. "In the past, we've had
trouble with Long Beach and Santa
Cruz, but not anymore. We're look
ing for success on a national level."
Stanford will face more difficult
competition later this quarter,
when the squad travels to Duke
University for a tournament that
will feature national powerhouse
Notre Dame.
As for this weekend, Tulum is
looking forward to traveling south.
"We'll watch the men's volleyball
game [against UC-San Diego on Fri
day], maybe get a little sun on the
beach, and, on Saturday, we'll shoot
[the competition! like shooting a
bazooka."
The city of San Diego certainly
knows the feeling.
