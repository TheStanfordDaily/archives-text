# Fac Sen to consider possible H&S minor
## Undergraduate minors could be instituted by 1997 
### Burt Herman Staff writer 
Stanford undergraduates may have the
opportunity to minor in the humanities and
sciences as soon as 1997.
All departments and inter-disciplinary
programs in the School of Humanities and
Sciences will have to come up with a minor
program before the 1996-97 academic year,
H&S Dean John Shoven announced yester
day.
The announcement was made in re
sponse to the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education's report, which recommend
ed offering minors for students.
"We've been going through that report
piece by piece, thinking about what to do
and when to do it," Shoven said. "I think
this is a very positive move."
Students will have to complete roughly

25 to 30 units in an area to complete a
minor, but the exact number is still under
discussion, Shoven said.
"From the student's point of view I think
this is all good news," he said.
There will be no requirement that un
dergraduates take a minor, just the option
to choose, Shoven added. "It opens up an op
portunity — there aren't any new require
ments," he said.
The proposal will be refined further be
fore being submitted to the Faculty Senate
for final approval.
"My sense is that it will go through the
senate without any problem," said Biology
Prof. Bob Simoni, chair of the senate.
"Everyone's really quite positive about it."
Simoni said the issue of minors "will cer
tainly come to [the senate] before the end of
this year," adding that other rec
ommendations from the commis
sion's report — such as the cul
ture requirement — will be much
more controversial.
Several department chairs said
they were hopeful about minor
programs.
"It would be an asset to our
department to have more under
graduates taking more systematic
programs," Baid Psychology
Department Chair Ellen Mark
man. "What I hope it would do is
enable students, who — instead of
sampling among psychology —

could take courses in a more
coherent way."
"Many students have more
than one interest and they are
interested in taking courses," said
Biology Prof. Patricia Jones, chair
of her department. "It will allow
students to develop a second
interest and receive acknowledg
ment that they have done a signif
icant body of work."
Some majors might be less
adaptable to minors than others.
Students majoring in human biol
ogy must complete a six-course
core sequence — a heavy burden
to place on a prospective minor
student.
"We might work out some kind
of compromise," said Prof. William
Durham, director of the Human

Biology Program. "For us to design
a high-quality minor in human
biology — that may be trying.
"In effect, human biology
includes a minor — with area of
concentration and supplemental
course work requirements," he
said.
Even though a minor would
open up new opportunities for
students, department chairs were
unsure as to what effects the new
policy might have on class enroll
ment.
"It could go both ways," said
Jones. "If it increases our enroll
ment, I assume the provost will
give us the funds to support the
extra students."
"I assume it means we will see
a few more students in our

department," said Prof. Donald
Roberts, chair of the communica
tion department.
Simoni said he felt that the
implementation of minors will not
greatly impact the University
budget."The only real cost in this
will be an additional clerical bur
den," he said. "I think it will be
relatively simple and relatively
low cost."
Whether students will choose
the minor option over completing
a full bachelor's degree in another
field remains to be seen. "We are
talking [about] Stanford students
who are achievement-oriented
people," Roberts said, adding that
undergraduates might be more
likely to double major rather than
fulfill a minor.
