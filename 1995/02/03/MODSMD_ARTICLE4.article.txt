The announcement was made in re

25 to 30 units in an area to complete a
minor, but the exact number is still under
discussion, Shoven said.
"From the student's point of view I think
this is all good news," he said.

fore being submitted to the Faculty Senate
for final approval.
"My sense is that it will go through the
senate without any problem," said Biology
Prof. Bob Simoni, chair of the senate.

Simoni said the issue of minors "will cer
tainly come to [the senate] before the end of
