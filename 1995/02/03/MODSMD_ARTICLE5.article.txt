# A 						'great scholar'
## Prof. Elsen dies at 67 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Contributing writer 
Art Prof. Albert ELsen, an internationally known
scholar of modern sculpture who specialized in Rodin,
died yesterday of an apparent heart attack.
Elsen, 67, was a professor at Stanford for 27 years
arid held the Walter A. Haas Professorship in the Hu
manities.
"He was a great scholar, a phenomenally successful
teacher and a force for good in the art world and at
Stanford, where he was a fearless supporter of good
causes and a constant opponent of whatever was trendy
and misdirected in University policy," said John Mer
ryman, professor emeritus of law.
Lorenz Eitner, professor emeritus of art, also
praised Elsen.
"He was a very active person. He was an early sup
porter of black colleges â€” when that was not yet fash-


Albert Elsen
ionable," Eitner said. "He was ener
getic and combative. He spoke his
mind, clearly and forcefully."
In the art world, Elsen was
regarded as one of the leading
experts on Rodin, said Thomas
Seligman, director of the Stanford
Museum of Art.
The Art Department also bene
fited from Elsen's efforts, Eitner
said. "He was highly instrumental
in restarting the Art Department in
the '605," he elaborated.
Elsen was pivotal in Stanford's
acquisition of its outdoor art collec
tion, Seligman said.
"He was the person responsible
for getting all of the outdoor sculp
ture to Stanford," Seligman said.
This collection includes works by
Henry Moore, Alexander Calder,
Joan Miro, Bruce Beasley, Jacques
Lipschitz and George Segal, as well
as the second-largest collection of
Rodin in the world.
"He was an activist who went far

beyond academic work in taking an
active interest in the legal aspects of
art," Eitner said. "He influenced
legislation concerning art."
This interest led Elsen to teach a
class on art law since 1971. Elsen
co-taught with Meriyman, with
whom he also wrote a book.
Besides being a eminent scholar,
Elsen was a highly regarded teach
er, Eitner said.
"He was a very popular lectur
er," Eitner said. "He was one of
those teachers who drew large audi
ences among students and the lay
public."
Seligman agreed. "He was an
extremely good lecturer. He was
compelling and exciting," he said.
"He wove a rich fabric out of the
artist, artwork and the times that
the artist worked in."
Elsen also greatly influenced his
students. "He was a caring guide to
graduate students," Eitner said,
adding that Elsen "saw [theml
through their degrees and careers."
Elsen's loss will be deeply felt,
Merryman said. "He leaves a huge
hole that will be difficult to fill," he
said.
