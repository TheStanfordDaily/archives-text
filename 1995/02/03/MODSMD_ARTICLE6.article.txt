# Commission may create early admit program
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
By next fall seniors in high school
may be able to enjoy the intellectual
benefits of a Stanford education with
out leaving their classrooms.
As early as this spring, the Commis
sion on Technology in Teaching and
Learning may launch a pilot project al
lowing up to 10 juniors in high school to
apply for early admission to Stanford.
If accepted for admission, students
would remain at their high schools for
their senior years but would complete
advanced course work in mathematics,
physics and English via computer.

The early admissions project came
out of a subcommittee on outreach to
high schools and community colleges,
said Assoc. Dean of Research Patricia
Devaney, the technology commission's
coordinator.
A proposal for the early admission
program will be submitted to a Faculty
Senate committee next quarter, ac
cording to Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions James Montoya.
The early admissions program
would be for students who "had ex
hausted all the academic possibilities in
high school, particularly in math and
physics," said Philosophy Prof. Emeri-
tus Patrick Suppes, a commis
sion member.
Students in the early admis
sions program could obtain up to
one year of college credit,
Devaney said, so that they could
enter Stanford with sophomore
standing, allowing them to grad
uate in three years or to com
plete graduate work.
"The main advantage of the
program would be that students
would come to Stanford at a
more advanced level," Suppes
said.
Universities have traditional
ly admitted exceptional youth

early, he said. However, from a
social standpoint "it is best to
keep these youth in their home
environment," Suppes said.
"They will get to stay in high
school, but at the same time they
won't be spinning their wheels.
They will still be academically
challenged."
Suppes added that Stanford
would be one of the first univer
sities in the nation to try this
specific program.
The early admissions program
is one of the first proposals to
come out of the technology com
mission.
Created by University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper last spring,
the commission is charged with
studying how Stanford can
enrich its teaching mission

through technology. The com
mission is composed of six sub
committees, including groups on
instructional software and out
reach to high schools and com
munity colleges.
"I'm pleased that the commis
sion is moving as rapidly as it is,"
said Senior Assoc. Dean of
Humanities and Sciences John
Etchemendy, the commission's
chair. "Largely this is because
Casper asked us to be an action
oriented commission rather than
a commission that produces a
final report at the end of the
quarter."
Etchemendy added that he is
presently finishing up a
"progress report" for Casper
detailing "what we are doing now
and what we see as likely projects

next quarter.
Despite the commission's
progress this year, Devaney said
that there are still a lot of details
to be resolved.
For example, the subcom
mittee on outreach to high
schools and community colleges
is currently looking at whether
students will receive high
school or college credit for the
early admissions program, she
said.
Getting the early admission
program up and running will be
made easier because Stanford's
Continuing Studies Program
already administers a course
work-on-computer program,
called the Educational Program
for Gifted Youth, or EPGY, Sup
pes said. The early admissions

program would utilize the EPGY
computer software.
About 450 students from 20
states complete Stanford course
work through EPGY, Suppes
said.
Tuition for EPGY courses is
about $400 for a three or four
unit class, and this would be
about the same rate charged for
the early admissions program,
Suppes said.
"It is definitely less than the
normal Stanford tuition," he
said. Limited financial aid would
be available for early admit stu
dents, as it is for EPGY.
The high school or the parent
of the student would be responsi
ble for supplying the necessary
computer equipment, Devaney
said.

may be able to enjoy the intellectual
benefits of a Stanford education with
out leaving their classrooms.
