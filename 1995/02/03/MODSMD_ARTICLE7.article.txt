# High school pen pal program also in works

Stanford students eager for e-mail
may soon have a guaranteed source.
The University's Commission on
Technology, Teaching and Learning
is working on an on-line pen pal pro
ject between high-school and college
students. It is also trying to create a
computerized coursework program
for the Native American community.

In addition to these pilot projects,
commission subcommittees are ex
ploring the creation of a Stanford
Language Series on CD-ROM and
linkups with other universities, in
cluding the possibility of team-teach
ing activities, said Assoc. Dean of Re
search Patricia Devaney, the com
mission's coordinator.
The on-line pen pal program
would match up high school students
with Stanford students, who
would communicate via electronic
mail, Devaney said.
"We have all the resources nec
essary for the project, and this
would be a great use of them,"
said Director of Residential Com
puting Jeff Merriman. "It is as
easy as pie to be an e-mail pen pal,
what with in-room connections
and dorm clusters."
Merriman said the program
would try to match students with
similar interests. The group pur
suing the pen pal project will
probably meet within the next
week to discuss details of the pro
ject, which might be up and run
ning this spring, Merriman
added.
In addition, the commission's
pilot project with the Native
American community would pro
vide high school students with the
computer equipment necessary to
complete advanced course work.

The pilot project would identi
fy several Native American stu
dents and "try to offer them
courses through remote technolo
gy," said English Prof. Robert
Warrior, a commission member.
This outreach program —
which would include students
from reservations, rural areas
and under-served urban areas —
probably will not start up until
next fall and will probably only
involve four or five students ini
tially, Warrior said.
The commission hopes to coor
dinate with the American Indian
Science and Engineering Society,
based in Boulder, Colo., to identi
fy possible students for the pro
gram, Warrior added.
With this project, the commis
sion hopes to "find out to what
extent we can deliver courses to
places where (Advanced Place
ment) courses and other opportu
nities are not readily available,"
Warrior said.
In addition to the course work,
students will be matched up with
mentors in their field of interest,
Devaney said.
