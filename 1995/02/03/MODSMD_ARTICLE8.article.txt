# Architect Freed focusing on fun

James Ingo Freed — one of today's most influen
tial architects — was depicted as one of "The Twelve
Most Fascinating People of 1993" in a Barbara Wal
ters Special.
But Freed, who is in the process of designing the
new science and engineering quad funded by the
$77.4 million Hewlett Packard grant, does not let
fame get in the way of his life's passion. He simply
hopes that "architecture never stops being interest
ing.
Freed — a partner since 1956 of the New York
based firm, Pei Cobb Freed — has worked on many fa
mous projects in the past, including the United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum, which opened in April
0f1993 in Washington D.C.
Of his works so far, the Holocaust Museum holds a
special place in his heart. Freed, a Jewish refugee, fled
Germany in 1939 at the age of 9.
"It is always the latest one that means the most to
you," Freed said. His current project, Stanford's new
quad, will soon assume that role.
The building of the new quad is an extraordinary
endeavor for the University, Freed said.
