# Architect Freed focusing on fun
## 
### Tracy Jan 
James Ingo Freed — one of today's most influen
tial architects — was depicted as one of "The Twelve
Most Fascinating People of 1993" in a Barbara Wal
ters Special.
But Freed, who is in the process of designing the
new science and engineering quad funded by the
$77.4 million Hewlett Packard grant, does not let
fame get in the way of his life's passion. He simply
hopes that "architecture never stops being interest
ing.
Freed — a partner since 1956 of the New York
based firm, Pei Cobb Freed — has worked on many fa
mous projects in the past, including the United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum, which opened in April
0f1993 in Washington D.C.
Of his works so far, the Holocaust Museum holds a
special place in his heart. Freed, a Jewish refugee, fled
Germany in 1939 at the age of 9.
"It is always the latest one that means the most to
you," Freed said. His current project, Stanford's new
quad, will soon assume that role.
The building of the new quad is an extraordinary
endeavor for the University, Freed said.

James Freed, the designer of the new science and engineering quad funded by a Hewlett Packard
grant, was also one of Barbara Walter's "Twelve Most Fascinating People of 1993."
"We will try to pull off in two
years what normally would take 60
years," he said. "Even Harvard, the
'Stanford of the East', never pulled
it off."
He is committed to making the
new science buildings a "joyful
place" by organizing the aesthetics
to connote freshness, energy and
peace.
"Just because a building must be
functional, it does not have to be
lacking in architecture," Freed said.
The physics tank will be torn
down and replaced with what Freed
called a more aesthetically pleasing
quad full of trees.
"Times have changed — we are
in a different century, with different
criteria and different technology,"
he said. "The strong new quad will
be an extension of the old quad."
The new quad, which Freed
summed up as a "microcosm of the
rest of the campus," will contain
many spaces of deep and light shad
ows. At the heart of the quad will be
a wide range of trees of different
sizes and various foliage.
According to Freed, architecture
is all about balance.
"The quality of this quad will be
like the other one," he said. The new
quad will add to the "spatial excite
ment of the campus."
Freed added that everyone will
be able to enjoy the new science
quad, even "fuzzy" majors, because
some humanities classes will even
tually be held in the new classrooms.
University Architect David New
man said Freed's design of the new
quad is "fundamental to rebuilding
a sense of space that has been lost at
Stanford through the years.
"The new quad will allow stu
dents and faculty to run into each
other and encourage necessary dia

logue between them," he said. "It
symbolizes the re-commitment to
excellence in research and teach
• _ rt
mg.
Newman views the quad —
which will be completed by 1999 —
as "the birth of a new area for the
second century of Stanford."
Looking back on his career,
Freed is not exactly sure why he
chose architecture to be his life's
work.
"No one really remembers why
they do it,"he said. "I like watching
buildings go up."
Freed compared architecture to a
"mission impossible" at the begin
ning stages of a project, saying "it is
almost a no-win situation. But as
you go on, it gets better."
Freed said his rational designs
are guided by the users of the build
ings. He said he achieves a perfect
combination between aesthetics and
function, which is different for each
building.
Inspired by his visit to
Auschwitz, Germany, Freed said
his design of the Holocaust Muse
um was his first attempt to make
architecture tell a story. Although
he used space and light to connote
the feeling of enclosure, Freed said
he was not attempting to recreate
Auschwitz. "You should never do a
replica of anything," he said.
Explaining the need for a high
degree of abstraction in his architec
ture, Freed refrains from ever build
ing "anything like Disneyland."
"Without frustration, work is not
good," Freed said. Out of frustration
comes new concepts, what he called
"a fresh way of looking at things."
His professional experience
before Pei Cobb Freed includes Dan
forth & Speyer in Chicago and Mies
Van der Rohe in New York. Freed
and his firm have received numer
ous major architectural awards and
honors, including the American
Institute of Architects' prestigious
Architectural Firm Award.

Working with Mies Van der
Rohe, one of the greatest architects
of the 20th century, was quite a
learning experience for Freed. Van
der Rohe's goal — which greatly
influenced Freed — was to evolve a
clear and simple architectural struc
ture rather than invent new forms.
Freed recalled one Christmas
break when he spent his entire vaca
tion drawing every brick on a build
ing for Van der Rohe "with a 4-inch
pencil like a needle." He called his
experience "wholly torture, like
doing surgery," but said "it focuses
you. You need to do something
craftsman-like to gain a peace of
mind."

Freed recalled Van der Rohe's
reaction to his work.
"He looked at my bricks for 45
minutes without saying a word.
Finally he just got up and and Tah
Yah'." Freed called Van der Rohe's
action "teaching through silence"
and has kept that painstaking draw
ing for 40 years.
Freed hopes to pass on his knowl
edge.
"I love young people," said Freed,
who has taught and guest lectured
at many universities, including
Stanford in 1983. "They are naive
and bring fresh ideas — they are
much less constricted in their
thoughts."

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, which opened in
1993 in Washington D.C., was designed by James Freed. According
to Freed, the project still holds a special place in his heart.
