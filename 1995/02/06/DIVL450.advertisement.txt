Hey, all you news department beat writers out
there! Just a friendly reminder from Beth &
Burt that we're having a meeting at noon
tomorrow to talk about what you have to do,
who you have to call, how much you have to
write and all that kind of businesslike jazz.
We're also going to have pizza for you guys
to eat.
And (yes, there's more!) one of our gracious
staff development directors will tell you
everything you always wanted to know about
writing a beat.
Oh, and if you can't make it tomorrow, don't
worry. Beth & Burt will hold another meeting
Wednesday just for you. Just call and let them
know you'll be coming a day later â€” but no
pizza on Wednesday.
