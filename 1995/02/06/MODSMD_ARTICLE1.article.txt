# Eshoo trying to ease those tuition blues
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Contributing writer 
Representative Anna Eshoo announced a middle-in
come college savings plan Saturday which some admin
istrators say could hold the key for future generations
to pay their Stanford tuition bill.
Eshoo said it is imperative that Congress act now to
support her legislation — titled the Higher Education
Assistance Program — before more lower and middle
income families fall through the cracks.
Speaking before a crowd of about 30 reporters and
educational leaders at the rare Saturday press confer
ence, Eshoo said her bill would give parents an oppor
tunity to save for their children's future by allowing
yearly contributions of up to $5,000 into tax-exempt re
tirement accounts.
Under her plan, Eshoo said she estimates if a family

started saving the maximum amount
each year for 18 years, a graduating
high school senior could expect ap
proximately $270,000 for college.
"Fees and expenses for four years [at
UC-Berkeley] total $50,000, and over
$100,000 at Stanford," she said. "By
the time a baby born today graduates
college in 2017, it will cost — even by a
conservative 4 percent [inflationl esti
mate — double what it does today."
According to Myra Strober, associate

dean for the School of Education, Stanford's high tu
ition could deter prospective applicants in the future.
"Basically, this legislation would allow Stanford to
survive," she said. "Without additional aid, the privi
lege [for diverse students] of attending Stanford would
be put into jeopardy."
Even so, Nan McKenna, associate director of the Fi
nancial Aids Office, said that Stanford will probably not
abandon need-blind admissions. "The administration
is strongly committed to the idea," she said.
But Eshoo's legislation has many supporters.
"Many parents are desperately worried," said Rochelle
Rosen, a guidance counselor at Fremont Union High
School.
"Parents and students are basing their decisions
less on the quality of programs or experience, but on
cost," she said. "A major problem is that financial aid
supports the most needy.... Most middle class families
don't fall into this category."
Richard Black, UC-Berkeley's financial aid director,
stressed that Eshoo's bill is not meant to replace exist-

ing federal student aid programs.
With the budget-cutting
rhetoric coming from Washington,
Black said he fears Eshoo's bill,
and others like it, will be used to
justify slashing subsidized loan
programs for the middle class.

"The interest now on a loan like
the Stafford is paid for by the fed
eral government," Black said.
"Without that subsidy, students
could be saddled with thousands of
dollars in additional expenses dur
ing their college careers."
However, McKenna said that
"Stanford's Office of Government
Relations is currently lobbying to
prevent further reductions in stu
dent aid."
