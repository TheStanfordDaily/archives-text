# Gingrich threatens Pell grant program

### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
House Speaker Newt Gingrich is making
waves in the higher education community
after questioning a federal grant program
which supplies 900 Stanford undergraduate
students with $1.6 million in aid each year.
In an address Tuesday before the National
Association of Independent Colleges and Uni
versities, Gingrich suggested that the gov
ernment replace the Pell grants program,
which provides lower-income students
nationwide with more than $6 billion a year
in aid.
Gingrich suggested that Pell grants be
replaced by work-study programs.
"We have this notion that, nowadays,
that if we don't give it away, there's some
thing wrong with it," Gingrich said Tues
day. "I think we have exactly the wrong bal
ance. I would rather, frankly, have a guar
anteed work-study program replace Pell
grants than have Pell grants crowd out
work-study."
Gingrich said the Pell grants program

unwisely awards funds to students without
regard to merit or effort.
"They're not getting it because they got
straight A's; they're not getting it because
they mastered calculus; they're just getting it
for being alive," he said.
Gingrich's remarks prompted quick criti
cism from college presidents and others at
the Washington, D.C. higher-education con
ference.
At Stanford, about 900 undergraduate
students received a total of $1.6 million in
Pell grants in the 1993-94 academic year,
according to Assistant Director of Financial
Aids Cynthia Rife.
Grant recipients at Stanford typically
come from lower-income families, Rife said,
and most are already involved in work-study
and loan programs as part of their aid pack
ages.
"We have the expectation, basically, that
every needy student will borrow and work,"
Rife said. "That normally comes in first
(before the Pell grant)."
Pell grant recipients "are probably the
students who shouldn't be working more or

borrowing more," she added.
Rife said Stanford could probably continue
to meet student needs even if Pell grants
were eliminated, but the burden on the Uni
versity would increase.
"If it reduces the [amount of] money avail
able, the University has to come up with it
some other way," Rife said.
Gingrich's concern that Pell grants are
distributed without regard to merit, Rife
said, has little bearing on Stanford students.
"Stanford students are well-qualified aca
demically," she said.
Gingrich's suggestion is just the latest of
many ideas that have arisen as part of
renewed efforts in the Republican-led
Congress to streamline federal programs,
including support for higher education.
The University will continue to monitor
actions in Congress on Pell grants and other
suggested higher-education cuts, said Direc
tor of Government and Community Rela
tions Larry Horton. However, Horton said
that the University cannot take any substan
tive action "until we actually see what the
plans are."
