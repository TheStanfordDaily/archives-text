## Hope to fix U.S.-China trade rift 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The warning
shots have been fired in the U.S.-China
trade war, but both sides are leaving
room for a truce before real damage is
done to one of the world's most impor
tant trade and political relationships.
The United States, exasperated by
China's failure to crack down on intellec
tual property theft, announced 100 per
cent tariffs on $1.08 billion worth of Chi
nese products Saturday.
China promptly retaliated, complain
ing its national dignity had been violated.
It placed 100 percent tariffs on a variety
of U.S. products, including video games,
compact discs, cigarettes and alcohol.
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey
Kantor's pronouncement that "we are
drawing the line here today" on trade
came just three days after an annual
State Department report faulting China
as an authoritarian state that had failed

to improve its record of "widespread and
well-documented human rights abuses."
Both were admissions that President
Clinton's decision last spring to remove
the link between trading privileges and
human rights had done little to promote
improvements in either area. China's
trade surplus with the United States was
nearly $30 billion last year, second only
to Japan and growing rapidly.
The trade dispute is serious. It could,
for example, result in China turning to
Europe for billions of dollars worth of
future aircraft purchases.
But both sides are likely to work hard
to keep it within manageable limits.
"I was surprised by the Chinese reac
tion; I thought it would be much worse
than it is," said Robert Dernberger, pro
fessor of economics at the University of
Michigan's Center for Chinese Studies.
"The restrained nature of the Chinese

reaction indicates they want this
resolved."
Both countries put off the effective
date of the tariff increases until Feb. 26,
providing a three-week grace period.
Only last week, Kan tor said the tariffs
would go into effect "just a few days"
after Feb. 4.
Even as he announced the trade sanc
tions Saturday, Kantor praised the Chi
nese for making some progress in enforc
ing a 1992 agreement on copyright and
trademark protection.
The higher tariffs directly affect only
about 5 percent of total bilateral trade,
which reached $46 billion last year.
Winston Lord, the State Depart
ment's assistant secretary for East Asian
and Pacific affairs, stressed last week
that "we are determined to keep our rela
tionship on a positive note, and we'll
keep working at it."
