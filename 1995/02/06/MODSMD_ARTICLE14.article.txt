Not near to Mir
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - Yes
terday's message from the Russian Space
Agency to NASA was clear: No way can
your leaking shuttle come near our Mir.
With time running out, NASA ordered
Discovery's astronauts to temporarily shut
down and repressurize a leaking jet in a
long-shot effort to stop the drainage and
permit a close encounter Monday with
Russia's orbiting Mir station.
Russian officials insist that, unless the
steering jet stops spewing fuel, Discovery
must stay at least 400 feet from Mir â€” 365
feet farther than planned. They fear the
small chunks of frozen propellant might
damage critical optical sensors on a Soyuz
capsule attached to the station and needed
by the three Mir cosmonauts to return to

Earth next month.
Who's on the Dole (ticket)?
WASHINGTON (AP) - Bob Dole said
Sunday he "has been tested in a lot of
ways," giving him a sound background for
his upcoming run for president.
The Kansas Republican said he will for
mally announce his candidacy in April,
around the 50th anniversary of one of his
most severe tests, a World War II injury.
Dole will be 73 years old in 1996, making
him older than any president at the start of
his first term if he is elected.
He said he would consider running with
Jack Kemp and went on to mention former
Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Pow
ell and several governors, including Pete
Wilson of California.
