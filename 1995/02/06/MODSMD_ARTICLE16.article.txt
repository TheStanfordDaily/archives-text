## Editor's welcome 
### 
IF YOU WERE to ask Stan
ford's top professors what they
like about The Farm, you
would hear a variety of responses.
Some love the research opportu
nities, some the great weather,
some the prestige, some the job
flexibility and security of being a
tenured professor.
But of all the joys of Stanford,
the one that generally tops the list
is the chance not just to teach but
to learn. It turns out that the pro
fessors come to Stanford for exact
ly the same thing as the students
— to gain knowledge.
The beauty of Stanford is not
just that a great teacher can
enlighten young students. Just as
wonderful is the fact that the
youngest freshmen can challenge,
inspire and enlighten the oldest
professors emeriti.
How do the teachers learn from
the students? It's not that hard.
The teachers watch for reaction to
their lectures. They answer the
students' questions. They solicit
written evaluations. They help the
students find out more about a
subject, and in doing so end up
learning more themselves.
Just like those professors, The
Stanford Daily has a mission to
teach people on campus. Just like
those professors, the best part
about working for The Daily
might be how much we can learn
from those we are trying to
inform.
How do journalists learn from
their readers? It's not that hard.
They watch for reaction to their
stories. They answer the readers'
questions. They solicit written
evaluations. They help the readers
find out more about a subject, and
in doing so end up learning more
themselves.
As I start my job as editor of
Volume 207, I want to learn as
much from all our readers as I can.
I want to hear what people think,
to get their reactions, comments,
criticism and suggestions. This is
the way I, and everyone else at
The Daily, get the real benefits of
working here.
To do this, we will need your
help and your feedback. To make
getting that feedback easier, I am

instituting the following changes:
• I will hold office hours every
week. On Monday evenings, from
5 p.m. to 7 p.m., I will be in The
Daily's office in the Storke Publi
cations Building to talk to people
in person. Come in and tell me
what you think. On Tuesdays
between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., I will
be in my office, by my phone, to
take calls from readers. Please call
with your comments. The number
is 725-2100.
• The Daily will be creating a
Reader Advisory Board. This body
will be composed of five to seven
readers who will meet with me and
other staff members once a
month. We'll ask board members
for advice and criticism. They
should offer plenty of ideas of
their own.
To apply to be on the board (any
readers — students, faculty, staff
or otherwise — are eligible) write
up an essay of one-half to one page
on why you want to be a board
member. Include your name,
phone number, occupation and
Stanford affiliation. Drop the
essays by The Daily's office by
noon on Monday, Feb. 13. The
authors of the best essays will
become board members.
• We are looking for one person
from outside the staff to join our
Editorial Board, the body that cre
ates and writes our opinions page
editorials.
To apply for this, write up a
one-half to one page essay on why
you want to be an Editorial Board
member and a brief list of ideas for
editorial subjects. Include your
name, phone number, occupation
and Stanford affiliation, and drop
this by The Daily's office by this
Friday at noon.
I am looking forward to the
chance to help keep our readers
informed. Please, help educate us
as well.
