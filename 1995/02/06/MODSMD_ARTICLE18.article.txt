## Co-op living: beyond tofu 
### 
SURE, THE HALLWAYS are dirty
and beans and rice are the staples of
every dinner, but to understand life
in a co-op you have to go beyond surface
characteristics. Outside observers may be
quick to judge the stinky compost pile or
messy kitchen. Many probably haven't
even ventured inside the door to really
look around. If they were to come in,
however, they would discover the people
who make up a sort of Stanford under
ground.
These are the students who actually
put Columbae and Synergy at the top of
their Draw lists. The ones who think it's
healthy to learn about quantum physics
in the morning and worry about burning
the tofu in the wok in the afternoon. The
ones who've taken Res Ed to a whole new
level.
It's hard to generalize about the co-op
crowd. Often, the only thing we have in
common is that we're Stanford students.
But even that's hard to recognize a lot of
the time. Still, the residents of co-ops are
an integral part of life on the Farm (It's a
lot like SLE — just when you thought
someone was normal, you find out about
what she studied for 27 units her fresh
man year). However, beyond the stigma
of funky vegetarians with wacky living
arrangements, co-op residents offer a
fresh perspective on a Stanford educa
tion. Imagine if the University invited

some trustees over not only to eat dinner,
but also to cook it. . . .
"So, you guys actually cook every
afternoon?"
"Yep, every afternoon. Here, put this
on, you don't want to spill soy milk on
your suit.. .. Now just follow this recipe
for fat-free cookies. Do you want Indigo
Girls or Talking Heads?"
"It doesn't matter, whatever you
want. But what about your lost study
time — you clean on weekends too,
right?"
"We work it ail in. I suppose it helps us
to keep our sanity when we can take a
break from reading and bake or mop the
kitchen floor on a Saturday morning....
Wait, wait! Put that in the compost bucket.
We don't throw away anything organic."
"Oh, all right. So, uh, why did you
come to Stanford?"
"I think it's a great school.. .. Look, I
don't really want to earn a six-figure
salary. ... I know Stanford can give that
to me, but I'm just not interested."
Who really knows what would be said.
The improbability of Charles Schwab stir
frying vegetables in the Columbae kitchen
just doesn't mesh with any construct of
reality. Perhaps the people in co-ops are
just clinging to some sort of humanness.
One can learn a strong sense of humility
from doing battle with the mildew in the
showers during a weekend clean.

We're probably from the same upper
middle-class backgrounds as most Stan
ford students. We're susceptible to the
same vices as any other person on this
campus. We're no more high and mighty
than anyone else because we hang our
clothes out to dry or clean our own dish
es. But we have decided that we'd be hap
pier doing these things in addition to
problem sets, term papers and mountains
of reading. Take it from me, it's a lot eas
ier to tackle the workload after some
mindless time chopping onions. Respect
for each other flows naturally after a
three-hour consensus house meeting
about organic food.
We're not masquerading as neo-
Thoreaus in our fabricated Waldens on
the Row. We are trying to make a state
ment about our own convictions and
what sort of living makes us happy. It
gives us some distance from the Ivory
Tower trappings around us. Sure, we can
see Hoover from the top of our roof, but
we can also see the peas blooming in our
own garden.
Maybe they would let the trustees
come over and help us harvest those this
spring.
