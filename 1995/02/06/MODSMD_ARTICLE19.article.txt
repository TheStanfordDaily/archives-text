ASSU should repeal amendment to encourage activism

I AWOKE this morning to read that
Newt Gingrich and the House Repub
licans had moved to eliminate $20 bil
lion in federal aid to higher education and
further recommended that an additional
$6 billion in college Pell Grants be
replaced by work-study programs. In
total, this amounts to about half of all the
federal dollars spent on college students.
None of this surprises me, especially
when it comes from a group of self-righ
teous demagogues who plan to spend the
first hundred days enacting a bunch of
bills that a pollster told them would help
them get elected despite whatever perma
nent damage the country may sustain in
the process (for example, the budget
deficit). What does surprise me, however,
is how far these guys will go in ruining
this country in the remainder of their
terms.

What I mean is the following. The
Republicans in Congress have stated that
they intend to cut the deficit while keep
ing Social Security and Medicare off-lim
its. In other words, they are buying off
the American Association of Retired Peo
ple and the burgeoning elderly population
who tend to vote in large numbers. Mean
while, who cares if we screw the young
generation, since they don't vote that
often and usually don't vote Republican
anyway.
These supposedly revolutionary
Republicans are clearly way out of touch
with everyone who knows how much a
college education costs these days. But
even more dangerously, they intend to
start a generational conflict. For this rea
son, I want to declare a preemptive strike
on them and the AARP before they take
away our opportunities to have a college

education and a future.
To carry out this war, I believe that
this campus and others must become
more activist. Therefore, the ASSU Sen
ate must lead the revolt by repealing the
Bone Amendment immediately. The
Bone Amendment limits campus debate
to issues which directly affect this cam
pus. In reality, this was intended as a
means to trick the student body into com
placency and apathy by denying senators
the right to talk about anything except
special fees and sweatshirts. We need to
have the ability to protect real issues like
financial aid before its too late. I chal
lenge the People's Platform and Students
Alliance to both show some courage and
get rid of the Bone Amendment since it
clearly restricts free speech.
Finally, I can't emphasize enough that
we must do something before its too late.

According to Rep. Dick Armey (R-Texas),
each one of us owes $18,000 to the insti
tutions which are financing the federal
debt. Not only that, but the current debt
is increasing because there are so many
"golf-cart grannies" who live far above
the poverty line and still receive Social
Security benefits. Franklin Roosevelt cre
ated Social Security to help alleviate
poverty, but too many elderly people use
it to finance their cushy lifestyles in
Florida. I say end this raping of our gen
eration's future and means test these
people. They've got the AARP to protect
their interests.
Who do we have to protect our inter
ests?
Clearly not the ASSU.
