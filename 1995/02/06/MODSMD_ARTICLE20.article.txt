# Roble sculpture garden progressing as scheduled
## 
### 
I thank The Daily for its article on the
continuing progress of the New Guinea
Sculpture Garden ("On hold: Roble
Sculpture Garden to be completed in
spring," Feb. 1). I do, however, feel com
pelled to respond to and correct several
inaccuracies which were reported in the
story.
The article gives the impression that
the garden's progress has been delayed
and "bogged down by problems" —
specifically, lack of financial resources
and the theft of an artwork. On the con
trary, we are right on-track with the
design and construction schedule which
we established last summer.

Yes, the theft was a great disappoint
ment and a stunning insult to the artist,
but this has not delayed completion of
the garden. Financially, we have the
resources to finish the garden and did
not delay construction for lack of fund
ing.
Last summer, we began scheduling for
a spring 1995 installation in response to
the logistical realities of both the design
and construction process. The site and
landscape design started in May with a
collaboration between the artists and a
design team, but we could not start
working on specifics until the artists
actually finished their works in Septem
ber. This was an open-ended creative
process so we could not predict the works
that would come out the end. We there
fore needed the rest of fall and winter to
fully develop and refine a site plan that

thoughtfully responded to these specific
works. The final design will be posted at
the site in about two weeks.
In addition, construction realities pro
hibited us from starting the installation
in the winter — you cannot pour con
crete into ground soaked with rain and
our specific landscaping species cannot
be planted during the winter cold.
For these reasons, we have always
planned on beginning construction in the
spring and finishing in time for a formal
opening ceremony during commence
ment weekend. As everyone can see from
the works at the site, we have the poten
tial for an unprecedented and extremely
significant public art installation; we did
not want to compromise it by rushing
ahead with a less than fully realized site
design and landscaping plan.
This project has clearly captured the

imagination of a large number of people
in the Stanford community. What start
ed modestly last May ended with over a
thousand people at the closing ceremony
on Sept. 16 — an all-night drumming
and dancing event celebrating the artists'
accomplishments and the friendships
created during the process.
I want to thank all the Stanford stu
dents, faculty, and staff that so complete
ly embraced the project and became part
of the extended cross-cultural family that
formed during the process. It was an
absolutely unique and enriching experi
ence for all of us and I look forward to
reliving the memories with you at the
formal opening ceremony in June.
