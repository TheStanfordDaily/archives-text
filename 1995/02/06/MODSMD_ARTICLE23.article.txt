Stanford 95
—————

The Cardinal men's basket
ball team hasn't started a sea
son this well since 1948-49, a
time when two of their victories
were against such luminaries as
Stanford Alumni and Stewart
Chevrolet.
However, a Chevy may have
been useful in last Saturday's
95-82 win over Oregon State, as
the Stanford frontline, over
shadowed at times by the pret
tier, fancier, snazzier moves of
their backcourt mates, mauled
their Beaver opponents, leaving
nothing but roadkill on the
Maples Pavilion hardcourt.
When push came to shove
between the two teams, the
Beavers went splat.
"We didn't play as physical
as we needed to play," said Ore
gon State forward Brent Barry,
who saw his team's record drop
to 6-12 overall, 3-6 in the Pacif
ic 10 conference. "Stanford's
very physical. They got a lot ol
big bodies, and they throw
them around. We're out
manned in that regard, and
weren't able to push them back
tonight."
The Cardinal (15-3, 6-3)
established themselves down
low early on getting six points
in as many minutes from centei
Tim Young at the start of the
game. Some fast-break buckets
and sweet dishes by guard

Brevin Knight gave Stanford an
early 17-11 lead.

Young would soon run into
foul trouble, however, picking
up his second foul with 13:43
remaining in the first half.
Slowly the Beavers chipped
away at the lead and finally
seized a two-point advantage
with 4:12 to go in the first half.
Enter back-up big man Bart
Lammersen, who along with
swingman David Harbour gave
the Cardinal some big minutes
off the bench. Lammersen pro
vided some much needed help
to both Young and ailing for
ward Darren Allaway.
The "Hammer" Lammersen
pounded in six first-half points,
and — perhaps more important
— teamed up with Allaway to
hold vaunted Beaver power for
ward Mustapha Hoff to just 1-
for-6 shooting and five points in

the first half. This trend contin
ued throughout the game as
Hoff finished the game with
only 11 points off of 2-for-12
field-goal shooting.
"They [Oregon State] do a
good job with their big people,"
said Cardinal head coach Mike
Montgomery. "We tried to con
centrate on not allowing Hoff
and [center] Vladimir Heredia
to hurt us, and we did that but
[some other players] went off
on us and did a really nice job."
Likewise, Harbour provided
greatly needed support for both
shooting guard Dion Cross, who
re-injured a shoulder when he
was clipped driving through
traffic, and forward Andy Pop
pink, who is still trying to
recover from his own shoulder
separation. If anything else, the

David Harbour looks to pass the ball Into the paint past an OSU
defender on Saturday night. The Junior guard had an outstand
ing game, including a career-high 23 points.
