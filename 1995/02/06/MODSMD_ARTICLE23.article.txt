Stanford 95
—————

The Cardinal men's basket
ball team hasn't started a sea
son this well since 1948-49, a
time when two of their victories
were against such luminaries as
Stanford Alumni and Stewart
Chevrolet.
However, a Chevy may have
been useful in last Saturday's
95-82 win over Oregon State, as
the Stanford frontline, over
shadowed at times by the pret
tier, fancier, snazzier moves of
their backcourt mates, mauled
their Beaver opponents, leaving
nothing but roadkill on the
Maples Pavilion hardcourt.
When push came to shove
between the two teams, the
Beavers went splat.
"We didn't play as physical
as we needed to play," said Ore
gon State forward Brent Barry,
who saw his team's record drop
to 6-12 overall, 3-6 in the Pacif
ic 10 conference. "Stanford's
very physical. They got a lot ol
big bodies, and they throw
them around. We're out
manned in that regard, and
weren't able to push them back
tonight."
The Cardinal (15-3, 6-3)
established themselves down
low early on getting six points
in as many minutes from centei
Tim Young at the start of the
game. Some fast-break buckets
and sweet dishes by guard

Brevin Knight gave Stanford an
early 17-11 lead.

Young would soon run into
foul trouble, however, picking
up his second foul with 13:43
remaining in the first half.
Slowly the Beavers chipped
away at the lead and finally
seized a two-point advantage
with 4:12 to go in the first half.
Enter back-up big man Bart
Lammersen, who along with
swingman David Harbour gave
the Cardinal some big minutes
off the bench. Lammersen pro
vided some much needed help
to both Young and ailing for
ward Darren Allaway.
The "Hammer" Lammersen
pounded in six first-half points,
and — perhaps more important
— teamed up with Allaway to
hold vaunted Beaver power for
ward Mustapha Hoff to just 1-
for-6 shooting and five points in

the first half. This trend contin
ued throughout the game as
Hoff finished the game with
only 11 points off of 2-for-12
field-goal shooting.
"They [Oregon State] do a
good job with their big people,"
said Cardinal head coach Mike
Montgomery. "We tried to con
centrate on not allowing Hoff
and [center] Vladimir Heredia
to hurt us, and we did that but
[some other players] went off
on us and did a really nice job."
Likewise, Harbour provided
greatly needed support for both
shooting guard Dion Cross, who
re-injured a shoulder when he
was clipped driving through
traffic, and forward Andy Pop
pink, who is still trying to
recover from his own shoulder
separation. If anything else, the

always intense Harbour gave the
somewhat lackadaisical and strug
gling Cardinal a shot in the arm.
"Dave got aggressive," Mont
gomery said. "He made some plays,
rebounded, took it to the hoop. We
were languishing, and that's what
Dave does for us. He's very good at
picking us up."
His feed to Lammersen for a
layup as time wound down in the
first half gave the Cardinal a three
point halftime lead. Harbour had
12 first-half points as well, but little
did he know that he would be in
even greater demand in the second
half.
"I've waited for my chance,"
Harbour said. "Tonight was the
night. It feels great."
While Hoff was quiet the entire
game, the second half of the
Beavers' lethal forward combo,
Brent Barry, showed up with some
fire in his belly. And in the second
half, he did some big-time burning.
After another score by Young
down low and two free throws by
Knight, the Cardinal took a nine
point lead. But then a jumper by
Oregon State's Stephane Brown,
followed by an eruption from Mt.
Barry, suddenly put the Beavers up
by two.

Barry scorched the Cardinal,
nailing three straight three-point
bombs. Stanford was on its heels.
Poppink didn't seem to be able to
halt Barry's three-point streak, so
Harbour was called in to stop him.
"Brent Barry is a great player,"
Montgomery said. "He had a great
night and really hurt us. When he
can shoot it from deep like that and
forces you to get up on it, he has a
very quick first step and really flies
to the basket.
"We made a switch. Andy's
shoulder has been very, very sore
and had a hard time getting
through screens. So I put Dave over
there. Dave did a pretty good job of
staying up in him and not allowing
him to catch the ball and get into a
rhythm."
After the switch with Harbour,
Barry scored just three more points
off of foul shots.
"I decided I just needed to get up
in on him," Harbour said. "I made
him drive forcing him to go to the
basket to beat me. He got a couple,
but we took away his three-point
shot."
With the Barry blaze extin
guished, the Cardinal slowly over
took the suddenly listless Beavers
and extended their lead to as much
as 13 with 2:28 left in the game.
Stanford put out one of their sta
tistically best offense performances
of the season, shooting 55.4 percent
from the field. However, it wasn't

all pretty. With a sore shoulder,
Cross was off, shooting just 5-of-13
from the field and l-of-7 from
three-point territory.
"For whatever reason that half
step just didn't seem to be there,"
Montgomery said. "We weren't as
crisp as we would have liked to have
been. We got into some foul trouble
in the first half. A lot of that was a
result of a lack of aggressiveness,
just not moving our feet, reaching, a
little bit lazy. The concentration
level was not great."
Harbour and Knight, who both
finished with 23 points, provided a
lot of offense, but make no mistake,
this was a game won in the trench
es with Stanford's frontline bully
ing the Beavers on the boards 39-28
and outshooting their power for
ward and center positions 71 per
cent to 33 percent. Young, called "a
force inside" by Montgomery, fin
ished with an impressive 13
rebounds and 17 points (6-of-8
from the field).
"We're getting some good
shots," Knight said. "We're getting
shots with our feet underneath us
and squared to the basket. We're
getting the ball inside and getting
some easy ones, and getting out on
the breaks and getting easy
layups."
It wasn't all skill and grace, but
with it all said and done, the
Beavers became just another bump
in the road.

vided some much needed help
to both Young and ailing for
ward Darren Allaway.
The "Hammer" Lammersen
pounded in six first-half points,
and — perhaps more important
— teamed up with Allaway to
hold vaunted Beaver power for
ward Mustapha Hoff to just 1-
for-6 shooting and five points in

the first half. This trend contin
ued throughout the game as
Hoff finished the game with
only 11 points off of 2-for-12
field-goal shooting.
"They [Oregon State] do a
good job with their big people,"
said Cardinal head coach Mike
Montgomery. "We tried to con
centrate on not allowing Hoff
and [center] Vladimir Heredia
to hurt us, and we did that but
[some other players] went off
on us and did a really nice job."
Likewise, Harbour provided
greatly needed support for both
shooting guard Dion Cross, who
re-injured a shoulder when he
was clipped driving through
traffic, and forward Andy Pop
pink, who is still trying to
recover from his own shoulder
separation. If anything else, the

always intense Harbour gave the
somewhat lackadaisical and strug
gling Cardinal a shot in the arm.
"Dave got aggressive," Mont
gomery said. "He made some plays,
rebounded, took it to the hoop. We
were languishing, and that's what
Dave does for us. He's very good at
picking us up."
His feed to Lammersen for a
layup as time wound down in the
first half gave the Cardinal a three
point halftime lead. Harbour had
12 first-half points as well, but little
did he know that he would be in
even greater demand in the second
half.
"I've waited for my chance,"
Harbour said. "Tonight was the
night. It feels great."
While Hoff was quiet the entire
game, the second half of the
Beavers' lethal forward combo,
Brent Barry, showed up with some
fire in his belly. And in the second
half, he did some big-time burning.
After another score by Young
down low and two free throws by
Knight, the Cardinal took a nine
point lead. But then a jumper by
Oregon State's Stephane Brown,
followed by an eruption from Mt.
Barry, suddenly put the Beavers up
by two.

Barry scorched the Cardinal,
nailing three straight three-point
bombs. Stanford was on its heels.
Poppink didn't seem to be able to
halt Barry's three-point streak, so
Harbour was called in to stop him.
"Brent Barry is a great player,"
Montgomery said. "He had a great
night and really hurt us. When he
can shoot it from deep like that and
forces you to get up on it, he has a
very quick first step and really flies
to the basket.
"We made a switch. Andy's
shoulder has been very, very sore
and had a hard time getting
through screens. So I put Dave over
there. Dave did a pretty good job of
staying up in him and not allowing
him to catch the ball and get into a
rhythm."
After the switch with Harbour,
Barry scored just three more points
off of foul shots.
"I decided I just needed to get up
in on him," Harbour said. "I made
him drive forcing him to go to the
basket to beat me. He got a couple,
but we took away his three-point
shot."
With the Barry blaze extin
guished, the Cardinal slowly over
took the suddenly listless Beavers
and extended their lead to as much
as 13 with 2:28 left in the game.
Stanford put out one of their sta
tistically best offense performances
of the season, shooting 55.4 percent
from the field. However, it wasn't

all pretty. With a sore shoulder,
Cross was off, shooting just 5-of-13
from the field and l-of-7 from
three-point territory.
"For whatever reason that half
step just didn't seem to be there,"
Montgomery said. "We weren't as
crisp as we would have liked to have
been. We got into some foul trouble
in the first half. A lot of that was a
result of a lack of aggressiveness,
just not moving our feet, reaching, a
little bit lazy. The concentration
level was not great."
Harbour and Knight, who both
finished with 23 points, provided a
lot of offense, but make no mistake,
this was a game won in the trench
es with Stanford's frontline bully
ing the Beavers on the boards 39-28
and outshooting their power for
ward and center positions 71 per
cent to 33 percent. Young, called "a
force inside" by Montgomery, fin
ished with an impressive 13
rebounds and 17 points (6-of-8
from the field).
"We're getting some good
shots," Knight said. "We're getting
shots with our feet underneath us
and squared to the basket. We're
getting the ball inside and getting
some easy ones, and getting out on
the breaks and getting easy
layups."
It wasn't all skill and grace, but
with it all said and done, the
Beavers became just another bump
in the road.
Stanford 95
—————

The Cardinal men's basket
ball team hasn't started a sea
son this well since 1948-49, a
time when two of their victories
were against such luminaries as
Stanford Alumni and Stewart
Chevrolet.
However, a Chevy may have
been useful in last Saturday's
95-82 win over Oregon State, as
the Stanford frontline, over
shadowed at times by the pret
tier, fancier, snazzier moves of
their backcourt mates, mauled
their Beaver opponents, leaving
nothing but roadkill on the
Maples Pavilion hardcourt.
When push came to shove
between the two teams, the
Beavers went splat.
"We didn't play as physical
as we needed to play," said Ore
gon State forward Brent Barry,
who saw his team's record drop
to 6-12 overall, 3-6 in the Pacif
ic 10 conference. "Stanford's
very physical. They got a lot ol
big bodies, and they throw
them around. We're out
manned in that regard, and
weren't able to push them back
tonight."
The Cardinal (15-3, 6-3)
established themselves down
low early on getting six points
in as many minutes from centei
Tim Young at the start of the
game. Some fast-break buckets
and sweet dishes by guard

Brevin Knight gave Stanford an
early 17-11 lead.

Young would soon run into
foul trouble, however, picking
up his second foul with 13:43
remaining in the first half.
Slowly the Beavers chipped
away at the lead and finally
seized a two-point advantage
with 4:12 to go in the first half.
Enter back-up big man Bart
Lammersen, who along with
swingman David Harbour gave
the Cardinal some big minutes
off the bench. Lammersen pro
vided some much needed help
to both Young and ailing for
ward Darren Allaway.
The "Hammer" Lammersen
pounded in six first-half points,
and — perhaps more important
— teamed up with Allaway to
