# Harbour the difference for Cardinal
## 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
On a night when Stanford wasn't as crisp as
head coach Mike Montgomery would have liked,
all the Cardinal coach needed to do was look to
the bench to find the answer in sixth man David
Harbour.
Harbour, a senior guard, made up for Stan
ford's lack of overall execution with his trade
mark brand of in-your-face basketball. Playing
one of his best games as a Cardinal, Harbour
poured in a career-high 23 points while shutting
down Oregon State's Brent Barry during a criti
cal stretch in the second half to preserve Stan

ford's 95-82 victory Saturday night.
With senior forward Andy Poppink still slowed
by a shoulder separation, Barry worked inside
and out to score 28 points on the night. However,
after a string of three three-pointers by Barry
around the 14-minute mark that erased a nine
point Stanford lead, Montgomery moved Har
bour over to cover the quick 6-foot-6 Barry.
"He hit one on me from 23 feet â€” I had to get
up on him," Harbour said. "Then we took away
his three-point shot."
After switching to cover Barry, Harbour held
him to three points, all from the free-throw line.
"Harbs did a good job on defense,
but it still wasn't that great," Barry
said. The son of ABA-NBA great
Rick Barry, Brent apparently
shares his father's lack of humility
as well as his outside shot.
Playing "a half-step slow,"
according to Montgomery, Stanford
suffered from sub-par performances

turned in by two key offensive
weapons. Poppink, slowed by both a
bad shoulder and a lack of quick
ness, and Dion Cross (sore knees,
dislocated left shoulder) combined
for only 19 points, 11 less than their
combined season averages.
Even Harbour, wasn't immune
to injury. Catching his toe on the
floor 10 minutes into the game,
Harbour played 25 of his 28 min
utes on a sprained ankle.
"Luckily, it was on the top of my
foot, so it didn't affect my jumping

very much," Harbour said.
Harbour's rough and tumble
style played into the physical nature
of the game. Combining bull-rush
drives to the basket with an
improved outside shot, Harbour
ended the game 7-for-ll from the
field and 8-for-9 from the line.
"Harbour probably saved our
bacon in the first half," Mont
gomery said. "The ball looked real
good coming out of Dave's hands,
that nice rotation like on Dion's
shots."
