# Harbour the difference for Cardinal
## 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
On a night when Stanford wasn't as crisp as
head coach Mike Montgomery would have liked,
all the Cardinal coach needed to do was look to
the bench to find the answer in sixth man David
Harbour.
Harbour, a senior guard, made up for Stan
ford's lack of overall execution with his trade
mark brand of in-your-face basketball. Playing
one of his best games as a Cardinal, Harbour
poured in a career-high 23 points while shutting
down Oregon State's Brent Barry during a criti
cal stretch in the second half to preserve Stan

ford's 95-82 victory Saturday night.
With senior forward Andy Poppink still slowed
by a shoulder separation, Barry worked inside
and out to score 28 points on the night. However,
after a string of three three-pointers by Barry
around the 14-minute mark that erased a nine
point Stanford lead, Montgomery moved Har
bour over to cover the quick 6-foot-6 Barry.
"He hit one on me from 23 feet â€” I had to get
up on him," Harbour said. "Then we took away
his three-point shot."
After switching to cover Barry, Harbour held
him to three points, all from the free-throw line.
