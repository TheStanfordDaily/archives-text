They say all good things must
come to an end.
Those good things, 15 straight
victories and 19 consecutive con
ference wins dating back to last
season, ended last Saturday after
noon as the Oregon State Beavers
shocked the third-ranked Stan
ford women's basketball team 78-

73 in front of the largest crowd
ever in Corvallis, Ore.
The 33rd-ranked Beavers (14-
4 overall, 6-3 in the Pacific 10
conference) utilized 25 points
from center Kristina Lelas and a
12-2 run opening the second half
to upset the Cardinal, who first
showed signs of vulnerability in
the Pac-10 at Thursday's tight
victory over Oregon.
The Cardinal had seemed on
its way to its 16th straight win
early in the first half as OSU
turnovers supported a 16-0 run
that propelled the first place Car
dinal (17-2, 8-1 Pac-10) to a 24-10
lead. Sophomore Kate Starbird
instigated the explosion on

defense with steals leading to easy
scores on the offensive end.
However, as head coach Tara
VanDerveer was quick to point
out, reality had to hit sometime.
"We haven't been at the right
pace," said VanDerveer. "Win
ning games by 30, 40, 50 points is
not realistic. Those won't help us
as much as this loss will."
Oregon State climbed back to
within one at 30-29 despite heavy
foul trouble to point guard Boky
Vidic and forward Annette
Mollerstrom. Starbird again
inspired the Cardinal to pull away
with two consecutive three point
ers, and the defense pulled up its
shorts to go into intermission
with a 10-point halftime lead.
Stanford still seemed in con
trol despite the Beavers' streak
out of the second half gates as
Mollerstrom found a permanent
seat on the bench. She received
her fifth foul with over 15 min
utes left in the game. The Cardi
nal defense also put the brakes on
Tanja Kostic, the Pac-10's leading
scorer, as she finished with 16
points on just 4-of-14 shooting
from the field.
The Cardinal actually jumped
to a nine point lead at 58-49
behind seven quick points from
senior Anita Kaplan who finished
with 19, three behind Starbird's
team-leading 22.
However, the Beavers clamped
down on defense and fired up on
offense as Kostic converted a
three-point play that gave Oregon
State the lead for good at 66-64
with six minutes left. Stanford
aided the upset as their leading

The Cardinal could not protect a nine-point second half lead from
the Beavers as well as sophomore Tara Harrington protects the ball
from the UCLA defense earlier this year.
