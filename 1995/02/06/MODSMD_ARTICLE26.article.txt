And the beat goes on.
For the top-ranked and three-time defending NCAA
champion Stanford women's swimming and diving
team, this past weekend's meets against Southern
Methodist University and the University of Texas pro
vided a chance to chalk up two more wins to an
unprecedented winning streak that has lasted seven

years and now stands at 51 dual meets.
Ironically, the Cardinal's last dual-meet loss came at
the hands of the Lady Longhorns in February of 1988
in the very same pool where No. 51 was claimed.
Friday's showdown against the fifth-ranked Lady
Mustangs of SMU in Dallas provided the toughest com
petition and the closest meet of the weekend. Led by the
always-reliable Olympian senior Jenny Thompson,
who won the 200-yard freestyle and the 100-yard but
terfly in addition to anchoring the victorious 200-yard
free relay team, the Cardinal exited rowdy Perkins
Natatorium with a 157-142 triumph.
"SMU really was a tough meet for us," said assistant
coach Ross Geary. "They have maybe the biggest home
pool advantage of any swimming team that we face.
Their fans are very loud, their pool is narrow, shallow,
and pretty old, and their swimmers have grown accus
tomed to it. I was just happy to get out of there with a
win."
Along with Thompson, juniors
Jessica Tong and Tammy Shannon
and sophomore Claudia Franco
helped the Stanford cause. Tong
placed first (100-yard backstroke)
and second (100-yard free); Shan
non first (200-yard back) and sec
ond (100-yard back); and Franco
first (50-yard free) and third (100-
yard free).
After Friday's narrow victory,
the Cardinal flew south to Austin to
battle the ninth-ranked Lady
Longhorns on Saturday. Texas was
no match for the champions, falling
184-114.
The meet was expected to be
competitive, and after Texas won
the 200-yard medley relay, a little
worry appeared on the brow of the
Cardinal. But sophomore Sarah
Anderson rose to the occasion in the
1,650-yard freestyle, coming from
body lengths behind to defeat the
reigning NCAA champion in that
event, Toby Smith.
"That was the turning point of the
meet," Geary said. "With that swim,
Sarah took away the crowd and all
the momentum that Texas had. It
was totally our meet after that."
Anderson's swim was not the
only time that the Cardinal defeated
Smith on the afternoon. Junior
Jane Skillman and Anderson placed
first and second in the 500-yard free
to the consternation of the
Longhorn faithful, who saw their
star swimmer go winless on the
afternoon.
"Jane's swim in the 500 really
floored the whole team," said senior
co-captain Becky Crowe. "She
swam so hard and so well and really
lifted all of us."
Other notable performances
were put in by Thompson (winner
of the 50- and 200-yard free and the
100-yard butterfly), senior Julie

Kole (winner of the 200-yard but
terfly), and senior co-captain
Kendra Thayer (winner of the 400-
yard individual medley). The Cardi
nal recorded its best times of the
season in nine events.
Ail-American diver Eileen
Richetelii faced two of the strongest
diving schools in the country, and
while she may not have dived up to
the high standards that she sets for
herself, she did manage a victory in
the three-meter event in Austin.
