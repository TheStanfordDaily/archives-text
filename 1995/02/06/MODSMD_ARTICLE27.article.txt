# Pitchers struggle
## Sluggers pick up first two losses of season in Fullerton 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
The top-ranked Stanford base
ball team found itself in unfamiliar
territory over the weekend.
Cardinal pitchers — considered
by many to be the best in the nation
— allowed 25 runs, 37 hits and 17
walks and hit seven batters as Stan
ford dropped two of three games to
No. 15 Cal State-Fullerton at Titan

Field in Fullerton, Calif.
The Cardinal (3-2) and Titans (3-
1) put on an awesome offensive dis
play in the series' first two games
with each team earning a dramatic
come-from-behind victory. Cal
State-Fullerton captured yester
day's rubber game 5-3 to close out a
series which saw two of college base
ball's powerhouse programs slug it
out in a non-conference battle.
"Our pitching staff really had a

Stanford 9 113
CSU-Fullerton 11 10 5

tough weekend," said junior A.J.
Hinch during a KZSU interview.
"But we hold such high standards
that when they slip up it looks bad.
I'm sure they'll be back and that
they'll keep us in some games down
the road."
The Cardinal needed a prolonged
ninth inning rally — their second in
less than a week — in the second
game of the series to escape south
ern California with at least one win.
Stanford entered the top of the
ninth inning on Saturday trailing
the defending Big West Conference
champions 10-7 with the Titans'
top closer, Mark Chavez, set to close
thmgs out and pick up the save.
But Cardinal first basemen
Steve Carver, a junior, had different
plans, lacing a line-drive double off
the 400-foot sign in straight-away
center field. Hinch — an Ail-Ameri
can catcher who beat St. Mary's
with a triple in the bottom of the
ninth last Monday — followed with
a moonshot home run which sailed
high over the left field wall to close
the gap to 10-9.
"Anytime you're in a critical sit
uation you bear down and concen
trate," Hinch said. "I've been lucky
to be in a couple of those situations
but it could really be anybody in our
line-up and I think they'd come
through."
Junior Sean Flikke, Stanford's
sparingly used outfielder, followed
Hinch's long ball with a solid single

before freshmen Chris Draft provid
ed the game's most exciting
moment.
In just his second collegiate at
bat, Draft lined a Chavez fastball all
the way to the wall in right field for
a triple, scoring Flikke with the
tying run. Junior Troy Kent fol
lowed with a sacrifice fly — giving
him four runs batted in on the day
— that gave the Cardinal its lone
win in the three game set.
"In games where the pitching
has a tough time the offense really
needs to pick up the slack," Hinch
said. "We were able to do that on
Saturday, but, unfortunately, we
couldn't on Friday or [Sunday]."
Stanford jumped out to early
leads in all three games of the series
and all three times saw Cal State-
Fullerton crawl back into the game.
The Cardinal's late-inning heroics
on Saturday became necessary
when the pitching staff allowed the
Titans to score nine unanswered
runs to turn a 4-0 Stanford advan
tage into a 9-4 hole.
On Friday night, a dramatic
comeback was again the order of the
day, though this time it was Cal
State-Fullerton who had the last
laugh.
The Titans — paced by six runs
in their final two at-bats — came
from a 9-5 seventh inning deficit to
edge the Cardinal 11-9 in the series
opener. Cal State-Fullerton scored
two runs off of Stanford sophomore


Curtis Song — Daily file
Junior catcher AJ. Hinch takes a mighty cut against California last sea
son. Hlnch's two-run homer sparked the rally leading to the Stanford s
lone win.
Brendan Sullivan in the bottom of
the seventh to tighten the gap to 9-7
before putting the game away in
their half of the eighth.
After Sullivan walked Titan
catcher Brian Loyd to start the
inning, the Cardinal's ace reliever
Tom Reimers came in to try to shut
the door. But after allowing a double
to first baseman D.C. Olsen and a
walk to pinch hitter Ruben Hernan
dez, Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess made the switch to junior
Mike Robbins.

Facing a bases-loaded, no-outs
situation, Robbins uncorked a wild
pitch to make it a one-run game.
After C J. Ankrum walked, outfield
er Jeff Giambi tied the game with a
single to right A Tony Martinez
groundout scored the winning Titan
run and center fielder Mark Kotsay
added insurance with a sacrifice fly
to make the final score 11-9.
"I had a really good focus on the
ball all weekend," Kotsay — who
went 8-for-12 in the series — said in
a KZSU interview. "I spent a lot of
time working and I was fortunate to
have it pay off."
The Cal State-Fullerton come
back on Friday night erased an
impressive game for freshman Joe

Kilburg, who had three hits and two
RBls in just his third game in a
Stanford uniform. Kilburg — start
ing in the place of iryured senior
Dusty Allen — nearly broke open a
7-5 game with a two-run single in
the top of the seventh.
Combined, Stanford and Cal
State-Fullerton used nine pitchers
during Friday night's marathon
game, which lasted nearly four
hours. Reimers (2-1) took the loss
for Stanford and the Titans' Tom
Dillon — who struck out the only
man he faced in the eighth inning —
was credited with the win.
Sunday afternoon's rubber
match was a pitcher's duel in com
parison to the first two games, with

Cal State-Fullerton's Ted Silva get
ting the best of Cardinal sophomore
Jason Middlebrook.
For the third time in the series,
Stanford jumped out to a quick lead
when Cale Carter launched a solo
home run in the top of the first and
extended the margin to 2-0 with a
Hinch RBI double in the third. But,
also for the third time in the series,
Cardinal hitters watched helplessly
as the pitching staff could not hold
the lead.
Lost in Sunday's defeat was
another outstanding hitting perfor
mance from Hinch, who was perfect
on the day at 4-for-4. For the series,
Hinch compiled six hits and four
RBIs.

a KZSU interview. "I spent a lot of
time working and I was fortunate to
have it pay off."
The Cal State-Fullerton come
back on Friday night erased an
impressive game for freshman Joe

Kilburg, who had three hits and two
RBls in just his third game in a
Stanford uniform. Kilburg — start
ing in the place of iryured senior
Dusty Allen — nearly broke open a
7-5 game with a two-run single in
the top of the seventh.
Combined, Stanford and Cal
State-Fullerton used nine pitchers
during Friday night's marathon
game, which lasted nearly four
hours. Reimers (2-1) took the loss
for Stanford and the Titans' Tom
Dillon — who struck out the only
man he faced in the eighth inning —
was credited with the win.
Sunday afternoon's rubber
match was a pitcher's duel in com
parison to the first two games, with

Cal State-Fullerton's Ted Silva get
ting the best of Cardinal sophomore
Jason Middlebrook.
For the third time in the series,
Stanford jumped out to a quick lead
when Cale Carter launched a solo
home run in the top of the first and
extended the margin to 2-0 with a
Hinch RBI double in the third. But,
also for the third time in the series,
Cardinal hitters watched helplessly
as the pitching staff could not hold
the lead.
Lost in Sunday's defeat was
another outstanding hitting perfor
mance from Hinch, who was perfect
on the day at 4-for-4. For the series,
Hinch compiled six hits and four
RBIs.
The top-ranked Stanford base
ball team found itself in unfamiliar
territory over the weekend.
Cardinal pitchers — considered
by many to be the best in the nation
— allowed 25 runs, 37 hits and 17
walks and hit seven batters as Stan
ford dropped two of three games to
No. 15 Cal State-Fullerton at Titan

Field in Fullerton, Calif.
The Cardinal (3-2) and Titans (3-
1) put on an awesome offensive dis
play in the series' first two games
with each team earning a dramatic
come-from-behind victory. Cal
State-Fullerton captured yester
day's rubber game 5-3 to close out a
series which saw two of college base
ball's powerhouse programs slug it
out in a non-conference battle.
"Our pitching staff really had a

tough weekend," said junior A.J.
Hinch during a KZSU interview.
"But we hold such high standards
that when they slip up it looks bad.
I'm sure they'll be back and that
they'll keep us in some games down
the road."
The Cardinal needed a prolonged
ninth inning rally — their second in
less than a week — in the second
game of the series to escape south
ern California with at least one win.
Stanford entered the top of the
ninth inning on Saturday trailing
the defending Big West Conference
champions 10-7 with the Titans'
top closer, Mark Chavez, set to close
thmgs out and pick up the save.
But Cardinal first basemen
Steve Carver, a junior, had different
plans, lacing a line-drive double off
the 400-foot sign in straight-away
center field. Hinch — an Ail-Ameri
can catcher who beat St. Mary's
with a triple in the bottom of the
ninth last Monday — followed with
a moonshot home run which sailed
high over the left field wall to close
the gap to 10-9.
"Anytime you're in a critical sit
uation you bear down and concen
trate," Hinch said. "I've been lucky
to be in a couple of those situations
but it could really be anybody in our
line-up and I think they'd come
through."
Junior Sean Flikke, Stanford's
sparingly used outfielder, followed
Hinch's long ball with a solid single

before freshmen Chris Draft provid
ed the game's most exciting
moment.
In just his second collegiate at
bat, Draft lined a Chavez fastball all
the way to the wall in right field for
a triple, scoring Flikke with the
tying run. Junior Troy Kent fol
lowed with a sacrifice fly — giving
him four runs batted in on the day
— that gave the Cardinal its lone
win in the three game set.
"In games where the pitching
has a tough time the offense really
needs to pick up the slack," Hinch
said. "We were able to do that on
Saturday, but, unfortunately, we
couldn't on Friday or [Sunday]."
Stanford jumped out to early
leads in all three games of the series
and all three times saw Cal State-
Fullerton crawl back into the game.
The Cardinal's late-inning heroics
on Saturday became necessary
when the pitching staff allowed the
Titans to score nine unanswered
runs to turn a 4-0 Stanford advan
tage into a 9-4 hole.
On Friday night, a dramatic
comeback was again the order of the
day, though this time it was Cal
State-Fullerton who had the last
laugh.
The Titans — paced by six runs
in their final two at-bats — came
from a 9-5 seventh inning deficit to
edge the Cardinal 11-9 in the series
opener. Cal State-Fullerton scored
two runs off of Stanford sophomore

Junior catcher AJ. Hinch takes a mighty cut against California last sea
son. Hlnch's two-run homer sparked the rally leading to the Stanford s
lone win.
Brendan Sullivan in the bottom of
the seventh to tighten the gap to 9-7
before putting the game away in
their half of the eighth.
After Sullivan walked Titan
catcher Brian Loyd to start the
inning, the Cardinal's ace reliever
Tom Reimers came in to try to shut
the door. But after allowing a double
to first baseman D.C. Olsen and a
walk to pinch hitter Ruben Hernan
dez, Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess made the switch to junior
Mike Robbins.

Facing a bases-loaded, no-outs
situation, Robbins uncorked a wild
pitch to make it a one-run game.
After C J. Ankrum walked, outfield
er Jeff Giambi tied the game with a
single to right A Tony Martinez
groundout scored the winning Titan
run and center fielder Mark Kotsay
added insurance with a sacrifice fly
to make the final score 11-9.
"I had a really good focus on the
ball all weekend," Kotsay — who
went 8-for-12 in the series — said in
a KZSU interview. "I spent a lot of
time working and I was fortunate to
have it pay off."
