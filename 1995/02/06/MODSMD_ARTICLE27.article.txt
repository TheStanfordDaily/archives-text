# Pitchers struggle
## Sluggers pick up first two losses of season in Fullerton 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
The top-ranked Stanford base
ball team found itself in unfamiliar
territory over the weekend.
Cardinal pitchers — considered
by many to be the best in the nation
— allowed 25 runs, 37 hits and 17
walks and hit seven batters as Stan
ford dropped two of three games to
No. 15 Cal State-Fullerton at Titan

Field in Fullerton, Calif.
The Cardinal (3-2) and Titans (3-
1) put on an awesome offensive dis
play in the series' first two games
with each team earning a dramatic
come-from-behind victory. Cal
State-Fullerton captured yester
day's rubber game 5-3 to close out a
series which saw two of college base
ball's powerhouse programs slug it
out in a non-conference battle.
"Our pitching staff really had a

tough weekend," said junior A.J.
Hinch during a KZSU interview.
"But we hold such high standards
that when they slip up it looks bad.
I'm sure they'll be back and that
they'll keep us in some games down
the road."
The Cardinal needed a prolonged
ninth inning rally — their second in
less than a week — in the second
game of the series to escape south
ern California with at least one win.
Stanford entered the top of the
ninth inning on Saturday trailing
the defending Big West Conference
champions 10-7 with the Titans'
top closer, Mark Chavez, set to close
thmgs out and pick up the save.
But Cardinal first basemen
Steve Carver, a junior, had different
plans, lacing a line-drive double off
the 400-foot sign in straight-away
center field. Hinch — an Ail-Ameri
can catcher who beat St. Mary's
with a triple in the bottom of the
ninth last Monday — followed with
a moonshot home run which sailed
high over the left field wall to close
the gap to 10-9.
"Anytime you're in a critical sit
uation you bear down and concen
trate," Hinch said. "I've been lucky
to be in a couple of those situations
but it could really be anybody in our
line-up and I think they'd come
through."
Junior Sean Flikke, Stanford's
sparingly used outfielder, followed
Hinch's long ball with a solid single

before freshmen Chris Draft provid
ed the game's most exciting
moment.
In just his second collegiate at
bat, Draft lined a Chavez fastball all
the way to the wall in right field for
a triple, scoring Flikke with the
tying run. Junior Troy Kent fol
lowed with a sacrifice fly — giving
him four runs batted in on the day
— that gave the Cardinal its lone
win in the three game set.
"In games where the pitching
has a tough time the offense really
needs to pick up the slack," Hinch
said. "We were able to do that on
Saturday, but, unfortunately, we
couldn't on Friday or [Sunday]."
Stanford jumped out to early
leads in all three games of the series
and all three times saw Cal State-
Fullerton crawl back into the game.
The Cardinal's late-inning heroics
on Saturday became necessary
when the pitching staff allowed the
Titans to score nine unanswered
runs to turn a 4-0 Stanford advan
tage into a 9-4 hole.
On Friday night, a dramatic
comeback was again the order of the
day, though this time it was Cal
State-Fullerton who had the last
laugh.
The Titans — paced by six runs
in their final two at-bats — came
from a 9-5 seventh inning deficit to
edge the Cardinal 11-9 in the series
opener. Cal State-Fullerton scored
two runs off of Stanford sophomore


Curtis Song — Daily file
Junior catcher AJ. Hinch takes a mighty cut against California last sea
son. Hlnch's two-run homer sparked the rally leading to the Stanford s
lone win.
