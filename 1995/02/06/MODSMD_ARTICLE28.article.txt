What a difference a week makes.
Burnham Pavilion rocked as the
Stanford women's gymnastics team
trounced Seattle Pacific, UC-Santa
Barbara and UC-Davis at Friday
night's quad meet. The Cardinal
rebounded from last weekend's loss
to UCLA by scoring 192.325 points,
more than nine points above sec
ond-place Seattle Pacific. UC-Santa

Barbara placed third at 180.825 and
UC-Davis finished fourth with
178.350 points.
Stanford, led by a stellar perfor
mance from freshman sensation
Keri Monahan, dominated all
aspects of the competition. An
inspired Cardinal squad started the
meet in dynamic fashion, scoring a
48.075 on the vault, a new school
record.

Freshman Keri Monahan stretches out during her floor routine. The
Monahan-ied gymnastics squad cruised to an easy victory on Friday.
Monahan also etched her name
in the record books by receiving a
9.8 on her vault, a handspring
front pike. Her score tied her with
teammate Jen 6 Elzie for the high
est individual mark in Stanford
history. Elzie recorded her 9.8
during the 1993-94 season.
"We've been working hard in
practice," said Monahan. "I guess
it's just starting to show."
The Cardinal continued its
excellence on the uneven bars.
Elzie won the event, scoring a
9.775 despite recovering from a

knee injury that has limited her
action.
"I don't go out there and try to
be a hero," said Elzie. "I just try
to do what I normally do."
But Stanford's gymnasts were
just warming up. On the beam,
strong performances by freshman
Misty Moore, senior Tina Snow
den and Monahan led the Cardi
nal. Snowden awed the crowd
with her display of strength and
style, performing a maneuver
which has been labeled as the
"Snowden skill."
The skill requires Snowden to
stand on one leg while reaching
back and grabbing the other,
holding it above her head and
maintaining that position for sev

eral seconds. It is a sight rarely
seen in women's collegiate gym
nastics.
"This meet gives us a lot of
confidence," Snowden said. "It
was a pleasant surprise."
The floor exercise, a traditional
Cardinal strength, provided some
high-flying action and electrified
the Stanford faithful. Senior Mee
gan Lannin and sophomore Katie
Jennings fired up the crowd and
had the house clapping to their
beat. Meanwhile, Moore, Snow
den and senior Katie Clancy
amazed those on hand with their
grace and energy. Monahan con
tinued her superb evening by win
ning the event, scoring an impres
sive 9.750.
