# Tumblers stagger to win

### Brian Lee Contributing Writer 
This season has been a dream for
the Stanford men's gymnastics
team. Entering last weekend's dual
meet at San Jose State, the fourth
ranked Cardinal had a win in an
open competition, four National
Team qualifiers and a stay-of-execu
tion on the NCAA's mandate to dis
continue the sport's official sanc
tion. Such success made the rude
awakening against the Spartans all
the more disconcerting.
While the final score, 217.90 to
209.85, left the Cardinal with a com
fortable margin of victory, the per
formance left the team with very lit
tle to celebrate.
"Overall, the meet was a disap
pointment for both myself and the

team," said senior Josh Stein. "This
was basically a wake-up call telling
us that we need to increase our
intensity."
Amidst all the disappointment,
there was one bright spot for Stan-

ford — the strong showing of fresh
man Tim Dalrymple. Returning
from an injury that had kept him
out of previous competition, Dal
jymple, last year's runner-up at the
U.S. Junior Nationals, delivered a

shining performance in the compul
so ries, displaying the promise he
brought to the Stanford program.
"Tim really showed his ability
this weekend," said sophomore
Jamie Ellis. "Although there wasn't
much that was positive this week
end, he and the other freshman
were pretty impressive."
Even before the competition
began, things were looking ominous
for Stanford. While warming up for
compulsories, junior Andrew Man
son hyperextended his knee. The
degree of the injury is not yet clear,
but Manson has had a history of
serious knee problems.
After that, things didn't really
ever start to look up for the Cardi
nal. The stress of the Winter
Nationals seemed to be a key fac
tor in the squad's rough outing.
"A lot of the guys had a pretty
tough week coming home from
Winter Cup," Ellis said. "We had
a lot of training and schoolwork
to catch up on and it definitely
contributed to our lack of ener
gy-"
Inconsistency, a nagging prob
lem throughout the season, once
again proved to be an unshakable
foe, surfacing the majority of the
routines.
"Guys aren't polished, sets
aren't clean," Stein said. "It's
clear that we have work to do in
the future."
Ellis echoed Stein's comments.
"Consistency will come later in
the season, but we definitely have
a lot of work to do in the mean
time," he said. "This has been
pretty disappointing, but hope
fully, it will prove to be a motivat
ing factor this season."
