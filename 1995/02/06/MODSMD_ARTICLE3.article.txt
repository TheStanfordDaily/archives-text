### Cynthia Yu Staff writer 
After almost nine months of re
search, Political Science Prof. Luis
Fraga announced at a
Chicano / Latino community meet
ing Saturday that the Grape Policy
Committee will submit its recom
mendation today.
Although Fraga, who chairs the
committee, said he would not com
ment on details, he stressed that
the committee based its report on
research into the toxic effects of
pesticides.
The committee was "established
to re-evaluate the University's poli
ty on grapes" in the wake of the stu
dent hunger strike last spring,
Fraga said. Its report will go to Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
and Provost Condoleezza Rice.
Fraga also mentioned that after
examining more than 50 studies on
grape pesticides, the committee de
termined that there was "no defini
tive scientific consensus on the
long-term effects of the use of pesti
cides."
Fraga said that although the
committee took into account the
success of previous labor struggles,
its report emphasizes the health
concerns of this issue.

The report mostly involves sci
entific literature, research and in
terviews with "people closest to the
issue," such as representatives
from grape workers' organizations,
he added.
The Grape Policy Committee
also evaluated social issues, trying
to answer questions about whether
it is Stanford's responsibility to
respond to the issue and what mes
sage the University is sending to
the Chicano / Latino community if
it does not take a clear stand on the
issue, Fraga said.
Assoc. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Ram6n Saldivar also dis
cussed the progress of a Chicano
Studies program at the meeting,
which more than 40 members of
the Chicano / Latino community
attended.
Over the summer, the Chicano
Studies committee surveyed possi
ble areas of concentration within a
Chicano / Latino studies program.
"This was the opportunity to
project where Chicano / Latino
studies will be [in the future],"
Saldfvar said. He added that the
committee wanted its report to be
"forward-looking and progressive."
The committee was formed at
the request of Rice in the wake of
the hunger strike to determine
' what was possible to do and what
had already been done at other
universities," Saldivar said.
The committee submitted its
report to Dean of Humanities and

Sciences John Shoven last month
and is currently waiting for
Shoven to announce at the Feb. 23
Faculty Senate meeting which
suggestions the University is will
ing to accept.
Saldivar speculated that the
committee will then be charged
with implementing Shoven's rec
ommendations.
Stanford also plans to hire a
"new faculty member in [the
Humanities and Sciences depart
ment] in Chicano / Latino studies
next fall," Saldivar said.
In other announcements, Civil
Engineering Prof. James Leckie
discussed the role of the Casa Zap
ata Advisory Committee, which is
"available to work with the [Casa
Zapata resident fellows] and their
new staff and to help them in
areas they feel need help."
Casa Zapata's current RFs,
Arcadio and Ellen Morales,
replaced long-time RFs Tony and
Cecilia Burciaga this fall when last
spring's budget cuts forced Cecilia
Burciaga out of her position as an
associate dean of student affairs.
However, the Morales' term at
Casa Zapata is only two years.
Although the committee will
provide assistance to permanent
RFs once they are chosen, Leckie
stressed that it is in no way
involved in the process of selecting
the new RFs.
