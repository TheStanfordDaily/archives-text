After almost nine months of re
search, Political Science Prof. Luis
Fraga announced at a
Chicano / Latino community meet
ing Saturday that the Grape Policy
Committee will submit its recom
mendation today.
Although Fraga, who chairs the
committee, said he would not com
ment on details, he stressed that
the committee based its report on
research into the toxic effects of
pesticides.
The committee was "established
to re-evaluate the University's poli
ty on grapes" in the wake of the stu
dent hunger strike last spring,
Fraga said. Its report will go to Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
and Provost Condoleezza Rice.
Fraga also mentioned that after
examining more than 50 studies on
grape pesticides, the committee de
termined that there was "no defini
tive scientific consensus on the
long-term effects of the use of pesti
cides."
Fraga said that although the
committee took into account the
success of previous labor struggles,
its report emphasizes the health
concerns of this issue.

The report mostly involves sci
entific literature, research and in
terviews with "people closest to the
issue," such as representatives
from grape workers' organizations,
he added.
