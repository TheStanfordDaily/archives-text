# Turnaround in '95?
## Softball wins 
### Jason Weintraub Contributing writer 
Looking to improve on a disappointing 1994
season, the Stanford Softball team began the
1995 campaign in impressive fashion this week
end, destroying Menlo College by a score of 29-0.
Freshman sensation Jessica Schulman went
the distance for the Cardinal, tossing the first
shutout of her Stanford career. Schulman also
helped herself at the plate, with three hits in four
trips to the plate.
Offensively, Summer Lee led the Cardinal hit
ting parade, finishing six for six with six RBIs.
Tori Marango, with three hits in as many at-bats,
was also perfect at the plate. The Cardinal
seemed able to score at will against Menlo, and
the outcome was never in doubt. Stanford used
its entire roster in the game, and all but two of
the Cardinal players had at least one hit.
Although Stanford schedules most of its
games as doubleheaders, Menlo College forfeited
the second game (resulting in a 7-0 Stanford win
for the record books) because they had no one left
who could pitch.
"All tboir pitchers had cuts and bruises all
over their hands [from facing so many Cardinal
hitters]," Stanford coach Sandy Pierce said. "It
got out of hand toward the end."
Despite the fact that the Cardinal clearly pos-
sessed more talent than Menlo Col
lege, a Division 111 school, Pierce
was happy with the squad's offen
sive attack,
"Their pitcher, Kim Ellis, is pret
ty good," Pierce said, "so I was
pleased with our team's hitting."
If nothing else, the game provid
ed Pierce with an opportunity to
assess her team's potential heading
into Pacific 10 Conference action.
"We're doing fine, this game was a
good showing for us," she said,
looking ahead to this week's double
header against California.
