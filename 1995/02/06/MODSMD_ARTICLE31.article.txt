# Two triumph
## Top duo needs 3 sets 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
Stanford's top men's doubles team staked a legiti
mate claim to a No. 1 national ranking by beating out the
country's other elite doubles teams to win the Rolex
Intercollegiate Indoor Doubles Championship yesterday
in Dallas.
The freshman duo of Scott Humphries and Paul
Goldstein scored a tough 5-7, 7-6, 6-4 final-round victo
ry over the tourney's No. 3 seed, Paul Rosner and
Vaughn Jayman of the University of Alabama at Birm
ingham.
Yesterday's championship should catapult
Humphries and Goldstein into a No. 1 national doubles
ranking when the new Rolex collegiate tennis rankings
are released on March 7. Going into the tournament,
Humphries and Goldstein were ranked 18th nationally,
but were seeded alphabetically between No. 5 and No. 8
by tournament organizers, who took note of the tan
dem's championship wins at the Rolex NorCal, the
National Collegiate Classic and the Pac-10 Indoors â€”
three of the most competitive tournaments in the coun
try.
"This is a really great victory for these two guys," said
Stanford head coach Dick Gould.
Humphries and Goldstein got to the finals by defeat
ing Texas Christian's No. 2-seeded team of Paul Robin
son and David Roditi in the semifinals, 6-7,6-2,6-4. This
came after another three-set victory in the quarterfinals
against David Caldwell and Brint Morrow of North Car
olina.
