# Wrestlers rebound from Friday's trouncing
## Mixed weekend for grapplers 
### Ratha Harntha Staff writer 
Bouncing back is necessary in
any sport — just ask the Stanford
wrestling team. After Fresno State
crushed the Cardinal grapplers 32-3
on Friday, they stormed into the
All-California Tournament on Sat
urday, placing third unofficially.
"Friday was just a kick in the
butt for us," said senior co-captain
Jay Jackson. "They [Fresno State]
just have a really solid team."
Other than junior Tod Surmon's
win in the 150-pound division, the
Cardinal (3-4 overall) was unable to
take another match against the
eighth-ranked Bulldogs (15-3).
"We have to do a better job of
wrestling in the third [round]," said
head coach Chris Horpel. "They

out-wrestled us."
In eight of the 10 matches, the
Cardinal was within four points of
its Fresno State opponent, but only
Surmon managed to pull out a vic
tory. Junior co-captain Jimmy
Aguirre, who did not practice all of
last week because of the flu, lost his
first match of the year to Bulldog
Dustin Riley, 2-5.
"I didn't have any strength,"
Aguirre said. "I felt worse as the
match went on."
Jackson, the team leader in wins
this year, could not come back from
a three-point deficit in the third
round and lost, 12-7, to Gary Quin
tana. Sophomore 190-pounder
Bryan Vaniman, who is also suffer
ing from illness, was taken down
midway through the third period as
Lalo Maz slipped past him, 5-3.

"We really got pushed around,"
Aguirre said. "We couldn't control
any of the matches."
There were some positives in the
meet. "Tod looked good like he has
all year," Horpel added. "And we
really appreciate the 400 loud,
enthusiastic fans [that came to the
meet]. Fresno State was a better
team. I just wish we could have
wrestled better."
That is exactly what the Cardi
nal did the next day. Even with four
starters out for the All-California
tournament and only one athlete
competing at 177 pounds and
above, the Cardinal finished just
two-and-a-half points behind Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, which had
destroyed Stanford earlier in the
