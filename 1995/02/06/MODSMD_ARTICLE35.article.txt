# East Palo Alto student is first at Stanford in years

Not many students cross the
bridge between East Palo Alto and
Stanford. But freshman Jorge Cas
torena surmounted the odds to
come to the Farm.
The first student from East
Palo Alto to attend Stanford in
recent years, Castorena came
through the national Upward
Bound program.
Castorena is among the few
prestigious East Palo Alto stu
dents to be accepted into a top
ranked university. Coming from a
city where census figures estimate
that just 60.6 percent are high
school graduates and only 15.6
percent complete college, Castore
na has overcome many obstacles to
get to where he is today.
"Sometimes I would look
around at what was going on," he
said. "Some of my friends were
dropping out of school, others
ended up in jail. I didn't want that
to happen to me. I knew that I had
to do well in school in order to have
a better chance."
Despite his dedication to hard
work, Castorena said he still felt
the odds of attending an elite uni
versity were against him. "I never
thought I had a chance at Stan
ford," Castorena said. "You hear
about it as the place where the
smartest people in the country go,
and that everyone is rich. I thought
it was out of my reach, there was
no way I could afford it. But then I
joined Upward Bound and my out
look on college changed."
Upward Bound, a national pro
gram administered through the
U.S. Department of Education, is
designed specifically to work with
students from socioeconomically
disadvantaged backgrounds.
"The program works with stu
dents who are traditionally
under-represented in different
levels of higher education," said
Suzette DeGrange, Program
Director for the local chapter of
Upward Bound.
This academic program aims to
encourage low-income and / or first
generation prospective college stu
dents to further their education.
The local chapter, sponsored by
Stanford's Haas Center for Public
Service, works with area high
school students from the Sequoia
Union High School District.
The local chapter of Upward

Bound especially tries to target
students who are not only first
generation Americans, but the
first member of the family to grad
uate from high school and poten
tially attend college.
Born in Guadalajara, Mexico,
Castorena lived with relatives
while his mother worked illegally
in California in order to gain resi
dent status. At the age of eight,
Castorena came to the U.S. and
received permanent resident sta
tus soon after his mother. She is
currently employed as a restau
rant cook, and his stepfather is a
sheet-metal worker.
"I look at my parents and what
they've done with their lives," said
Castorena. "They started with
nothing. Sometimes they had to
put everything on the line for the
family. I really respect them for
how far they've come."
Upward Bound encourages stu
dents to begin preparation for col
lege at an early age. "We recruit
students starting from the eighth
grade," said Degrange. "Typically
students begin the program at the
start of high school or at least by
the tenth grade. We will potential
ly work with a student for up to
four years."
Castorena discovered Upward
Bound through a teacher at Carl
mont High School. Funded to
serve 70 high school students, the
program is limited to a select
enrollment from the community.
Castorena was chosen to fill one of
the 15 to 25 positions that are
available annually.
"The program prepared me for
what to expect in college," said
Castorena. "It really encouraged
me to work towards my goal."
Castorena now works at the
other end of the program, volun
teering as a substitute tutor during
the weekend. "I'd really like to be
involved in the community," he
said. "I want to encourage kids at a
young age to do well in school. Edu
cation is so important these days."
DeGrange said she believes that
Castorena's success creates a posi
tive image for other students in
the Upward Bound program.
"[Castorena] has been exceptional
in that he has been able to balance
the responsibilities of family, com
mitment to his community and
culture, while striving for personal
fulfillment via higher education,"
said DeGrange.

Last summer Castorena worked
as an intern for Shell Oil Compa
ny, which now covers his tuition
through grants, loans and earn
ings. Working towards a mechani
cal engineering major, he plans to
continue working with Shell after

he graduates from Stanford.
"[Castorena] is very determined
and focused on his goals," said
Castorena's roommate Guillermo
Maldonado. "He seems to have
plans for everything. He knows
what he wants."
