# Symposium held on Chicano issues
## 
### Sheila McDonald 
Proposition 187 and Gov.
Pete Wilson's impending
challenge to affirmative ac
tion loomed large Saturday at
the fourth annual sympo
sium for Chicano and Latino
students and alumni.
El Centro Chicano and the
Stanford National Chi
cano / Latino Alumni Associ
ation sponsored the event in
order to spur dialogue on is
sues and opportunities in the
community, although Satur-
day's gathering leaned more
toward the negative than the
positive.
"I'm going to start by address
ing you in Spanish . . . before we
lose the right [to do so]," joked
keynote speaker Renato Rosaldo,
chair of the Department of
Anthropology.
Rosaldo reiterated arguments
for affirmative action to the
group of about 80 students and
alumni who gathered for the day
long symposium.
He insisted that an education
al institution benefits from a
diverse range of perspectives,
arguing that Stanford needs
more Latino and Chicano doctor
al candidates in sociology, eco
nomics and other hard sciences.
Mike Perez, a member of the
Board of Trustees, encouraged
calm discussion of the challenge
of Proposition 187, a bill passed
last fall which would make illegal
aliens ineligible for social ser
vices such as schooling or medi
cal care. Civil rights groups are
currently challenging the mea
sure in court.
Perez reminded listeners that

Latinos who burned the Ameri
can flag during the elections
defeated their own purpose by
attacking the nation instead of
the issue.
"You are and will continue to
be the leaders of the Latino com
munity. ... It is your responsi
bility to intelligently wage these
battles," Perez said.
University President Gerhard
Casper also spoke briefly on the
value of productive dialogue. He
surprised the audience by allud
ing to a Mayan myth which
depicts a group of gods creating
humans after much experimen
tation and discussion.
Casper encouraged creative
exchange between students and
alumni, "too few [of whom] take
advantage of the chance to share
with students their lives full of
triumphs and errors."
After the speeches the sympo
sium broke into discussion
groups headed by alumni and
experts on various topics.
The panel on Proposition 187
held their meeting like a council
of war preparing for battle.
"As an officer of the court and
someone who is sworn to uphold
the law, I encourage you to dis
obey this law [if it passes]," said
panelist Deborah Escobedo, an
attorney who is challenging the

proposition in state court.
Escobedo reminded listeners
that the historical persecution of
minority groups, such as Ger
many's Jews, often began with
laws excluding the minority chil
dren from schools.
Fellow panelist Robert Martin
Almazan, a 1992 Stanford gradu
ate and communications director
of the Mexican-American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund,
urged listeners to spread the
word that the Chicano / Latino
community has nothing to fear
for now, because the proposition
is not yet in effect.
But students like Norma Men
doza-Denton, a doctoral candi
date in linguistics, pointed out
that children are already very
afraid.
"I work with high school stu
dents, and many are afraid to go
to school," she said. "There are
students in middle school playing
'migra' tag, where some students
pretend to be persecuted and
some pretend to be [Immigration
and Naturalization Service]
agents."
A panel on images of Chicanos
and Latinos in the media took a
different but related slant. Pan
elist Giselle Marie Achecar, a
1989 graduate who is now a pro
fessional actress and a lawyer,

told listeners that light-skinned,
non-accented Latinas like herself
are in demand by an entertain
ment industry that equates
"American" with "white."
Artist Jose Antonio Burciaga,
a former Casa Zapata resident
fellow, also pointed out the
endurance of the stereotypical
Chicano image, the man against
a cactus sleeping beneath a som
brero.
The day's discussions and
defenses of Chicano and Latino
culture ended with celebration. A
boisterous performance of tradi
tional Mexican dance by the Bal
let Folklorico de Stanford drew a
clapping, whistling crowd to the
Law School courtyard.
One dancer, sophomore Carlos
Salcido, spoke afterward about
the pride Chicanos and Latinos
can still have in traditions that
outsiders might see as stereotyp
ical. But he said he fears that this
pride might not survive beyond
his generation.
"I'm fifth-generation [Mexi
can American]," Salcido said.
"Are my kids going to be able to
stand up and say, 'I'm a sixth
generation American, and I'm
proud my family has roots in
Mexico?' Or are they going to live
in fear of expressing who they
really are?"
