# No need to brave freezing nights for the Ball
## 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
Breaking from what has become a
campus tradition, students who want to
attend this year's Viennese Ball will no
longer have to brave the cold to spend a
night lined up in White Plaza.
With the addition of a separate lot
tery, people who prefer not to sacrifice
the night before tickets go on sale can de
pend on the luck of the draw. Sign-ups
for the lottery begin today in White
Plaza.
In a new attempt to make the Vien
nese Ball ticket purchase process more

organized and equitable, the Viennese
Ball Committee has decided to reduce by
half the number of tickets traditionally
sold through general sales, said senior
Jenji Mercer, the committee's chair.
Half of the 250 ticket pairs to be sold
will be allocated through the lottery and
the remaining half will be sold on a first
come first-served basis Friday morning
at 8 a.m.
For the convenience of not having to
sleep out for tickets, lottery winners will
pay $65 per pair, compared to $60 per
pair for people who purchase through
general sales, said Ryan Knotts, chair of
the publicity committee for the Viennese

Ball.
The changes were made "based on
complaints that we heard from people
who wished to go to the ball but didn't
want to sleep out for tickets," Mercer
said.
Mercer said that in the past the com
mittee has tried many different methods
which either failed or led to complaints.
"This is one last stab at selling the
tickets in a different way and seeing if it
helps people," she said. "It's more paper
work for us, but our goal is to make it less
of a hassle for both the committee mem
bers (who have to patrol the line on
sleep-out nights) and the ticket buyers,"

Mercer said.
This year's two-part process makes
the ball open to more people and saves
everyone trouble, said choreographer
Lisa Park.
Although the committee by no means
requires that people sleep out for tickets,
the high demand for the limited tickets
leads people to begin lining up the night
before tickets go on sale, Mercer said.
Although the intent is to make this
easier and accessible to more people,
Mercer was unsure how licket buyers
would respond to the lottery system.
"We have no idea how many
people will enter the drawing and
end up on the waiting list," she
said. "We don't know if people will
like it. This is the first year and this
may be the last year."
Ticket seekers can enter their
names for the lottery from 11 a.m.
to 2 p.m. in White Plaza today and
tomorrow. Entry is limited to one

per person.
The names of the 125 winners
will be chosen in the open drawing
held tomorrow at 6 p.m. at a loca
tion to be announced today. Each
winner has until 6 p.m. on
Wednesday to claim one pair of
tickets.
After that deadline, people on
the waiting list may purchase
unclaimed tickets. Any tickets
which remain unclaimed by Thurs
day at 8 p.m. will be sold with the
other 125 ticket pairs Friday at 8
a.m. in White Plaza.
