# Turnbull speaks out
## Youth need to take responsibility 
### Kyung Lee Contributing writer 
In Friday night's keynote
speech for Stanford's Black Lib
eration Month, Walter Turnbull,
founder and executive director of
the Harlem Boys Choir, stressed
the importance of taking respon
sibility for the future of America's
youth.
"We cannot sit up in the ivory
towers and prepare for our lives
without thinking about how
we're going to contribute. We will
suffer — we are suffering — for
not getting involved," Turnbull
told the 200-member audience at
Kresge Auditorium.
The choir — which Turnbull
founded 25 years ago in a New
York City church — has since
gained international fame,
singing at the rededication of the
Statue of Liberty, at Nelson Man
dela's arrival in America and for
several movie soundtracks.
Based on his experiences with
the choir, Turnbull discussed the
"challenge of instilling integrity

in youth."
Noting that the boys in his
choir are often let down by the ed
ucation system, media and their
parents, Turnbull asked how chil
dren could be made to feel good
about themselves.
He answered that self-esteem
is the key. "Kids are highly moti
vated when they feel good about
themselves," he said, referring to
his personal experience as proof
of the belief.
"When I started the choir, I
met many boys who were witty,
smart and had the gift of song. All
they needed was guidance, and
that was something I could offer,"
he said.
Turnbull said that 98 percent
of the students at his five-year-old
choir school enter college. "This is
in a city where 75 percent to 80
percent don't even graduate from
high school," he said. "It is a mul
tidisciplinary school with an em
phasis on music. For my boys, it is
an opportunity to be somebody, to

lead the world."
He added that music can be
used as a tool to develop people.
"From music, they can learn disci
pline — the ability to visualize a
goal and work toward it step by
step without giving up."
But Turnbull admitted that
instilling virtues in a child is diffi
cult. "You can't fool a child. It
takes honesty, courage, straight
forwardness. And it's not easy. It's
not easy," he said.
Turnbull graduated from
Tougaloo College in Mississippi
and then received his master's and
doctoral degrees in music from the?

Manhattan School of Music. He
also went to Columbia Business
School, where he specialized in
nonprofit organizations.
"When I entered college, I
wanted to be a biologist. But then,
something hit me upside the
head, and I became a musician .. .

bull said.
He also attributed his success
to his childhood. "I had hope,
faith, good teachers and love in
abundance. These made me go
forward and be the best I am be,"
he said.
In honor of Black Liberation
Month, a singing of the Black
National Anthem and a perfor
mance by the a cappella group
Talisman preceded Turnbull's
speech.
