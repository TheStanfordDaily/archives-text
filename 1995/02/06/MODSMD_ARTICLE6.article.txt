## Youth need to take responsibility

In Friday night's keynote
speech for Stanford's Black Lib
eration Month, Walter Turnbull,
founder and executive director of
the Harlem Boys Choir, stressed
the importance of taking respon
sibility for the future of America's
youth.
"We cannot sit up in the ivory
towers and prepare for our lives

founded 25 years ago in a New

themselves," he said, referring to
his personal experience as proof
of the belief.

met many boys who were witty,
smart and had the gift of song. All
they needed was guidance, and
that was something I could offer,"
he said.
Turnbull said that 98 percent
of the students at his five-year-old
choir school enter college. "This is
in a city where 75 percent to 80
percent don't even graduate from
