# Conflict of interest?
## Russell resigns as biz manager 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
Undergraduate ASSU senator Stephen Russell re
signed Thursday night from his position as business
manager of the Stanford Directory citing a conflict of

interest.
Russell said that because the Di
rectory falls under the jurisdiction
of the Office of Student Activities,
working for the administration and
representing students created a
troubling situation.
But some student leaders ques
tioned whether Russell's motives
relate to the controversy surround
ing his alleged misuse of authority

by listing Associated Students Con
sulting as an ASSU group in the Directory.
Russell is president of Associated Students Con
sulting, which is no more a part of the ASSU than any
other voluntary student organization. He is current
ly under investigation by the senate for alleged ethics
violations involving Associated Students Consulting.
The controversy over who controls the Directory
has been a recurring issue. In 1992, the University
was considering whether to turn the Directory over
to the ASSU. But because the ASSU was deemed to
be "falling apart," the Directory remained in the
hands of the University.
While the administration claims authority, the
Stanford Directory uses the ASSU tax code and does
not have a constitution filed with the Office of Stu
dent Activities, Russell said. Furthermore, the orga
nization is allocated space by the ASSU Publications
Board, he said.
According to Nanci Howe, director of Student Ac
tivities, the reason that the Directory uses an ASSU
tax code is because its accounting is handled by the
ASSU's banking services — a non-political part of the
ASSU which handles the accounting for most stu
dent groups.
While the Directory is run by students, Howe said,
it falls under authority of the University.


Russell
"I still care about the Directory
very much," Russell said. "I think
it serves a great purpose. It's
unfortunate that this situation
has arisen. I just simply can't
work for [Student Activities] and
represent students at the same
time."
Russell said that having Howe
as his boss would make it difficult
to argue with her on the students'
behalf, if he ever had to do so.
The graduation last quarter
of Paul Yee, former director of
the Directory, was part of the
reason for his decision, Russell
said.
"I spent a lot of time trying to
resolve it," Russell said. "It was
clarified that after the project
director graduated, I would be
working and reporting to Nanci
Howe. I just can't formally work
with Nanci Howe and represent
students at the same time."
Howe said she is "sorry that
[Russell] has resigned ... he
worked hard at the Directory.
"I don't quite understand what
he's talking about, but it's his
choice," Howe said about Russell's
claims of a conflict of interest.
Russell has recently been under
scrutiny for his role in the Ask
Stanford publication produced by
the newly formed Students'
Alliance party.
In a report, ASSU Financial
Manager Gabe Lucas found that

Russell used his role as the Direc
tory's business manager to place
Associated Student Consulting,
publisher of the newsletter, as an
ASSU organization.
Russell denied the report's find
ings and said it played no role in
his resignation. "Neither Nanci
Howe nor [Stanford Directory
Director] Paul Yee has even men
tioned it to me."
Russell added that he placed
Associated Student Consulting
under the ASSU heading in the
phone book because the group's
stated intent is to help inform stu
dents about the ASSU.
However, some student leaders
questioned the timing of Russell's
resignation.
Council of Presidents member
Mork Murdock said it would seem
"a strange coincidence for him to
up and resign now [by] saying that
he's in a position of conflict of
interest.... It seems like the tim
ing may be a little bit odd."
ASSU Senate Chair Nawwar
Kasrawi agreed, saying that "the
timing may have some signifi
cance."
Like Howe, some student lead
ers wondered whether working
for both the Directory and the
ASSU constituted a conflict of
interest.
Murdock said he did not think
"that being a part of the directoiy
would inhibit [Russell's] actions as
an ASSU senator.... I don't see
that as being a problem."
