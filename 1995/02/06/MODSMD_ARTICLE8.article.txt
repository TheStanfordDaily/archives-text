# Conflict of interest?
## Russell resigns as biz manager 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
Undergraduate ASSU senator Stephen Russell re
signed Thursday night from his position as business
manager of the Stanford Directory citing a conflict of

interest.
Russell said that because the Di
rectory falls under the jurisdiction
of the Office of Student Activities,
working for the administration and
representing students created a
troubling situation.
But some student leaders ques
tioned whether Russell's motives
relate to the controversy surround
ing his alleged misuse of authority

by listing Associated Students Con
sulting as an ASSU group in the Directory.
Russell is president of Associated Students Con
sulting, which is no more a part of the ASSU than any
other voluntary student organization. He is current
ly under investigation by the senate for alleged ethics
violations involving Associated Students Consulting.
The controversy over who controls the Directory
has been a recurring issue. In 1992, the University
was considering whether to turn the Directory over
to the ASSU. But because the ASSU was deemed to
be "falling apart," the Directory remained in the
hands of the University.
While the administration claims authority, the
Stanford Directory uses the ASSU tax code and does
not have a constitution filed with the Office of Stu
dent Activities, Russell said. Furthermore, the orga
nization is allocated space by the ASSU Publications
Board, he said.
According to Nanci Howe, director of Student Ac
tivities, the reason that the Directory uses an ASSU
tax code is because its accounting is handled by the
ASSU's banking services â€” a non-political part of the
ASSU which handles the accounting for most stu
dent groups.
While the Directory is run by students, Howe said,
it falls under authority of the University.
