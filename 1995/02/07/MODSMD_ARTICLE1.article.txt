# A 						decline in crime
## DUIs, bike thefts down in 1994, say campus police 
### Gabriela Teodorescu Contributing writer 
Recently released crime statistics for 1994
show a decrease in some common campus crimes
such as driving under the influence (DUI), alco
holic beverage violations, bike theft and vandal
ism.
DUI violations are down from 45 in 1993 to 16
in 1994, and alcoholic beverage violations de
creased by 50 percent, dropping to 28 from 56.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said the
DUI statistics reflect individuals' increasing
caution since the passage of a new law reducing
the blood alcohol level necessary for citation
from 0.1 to 0.08.
Niemeyer insisted that police did not enforce
laws differently in 1994 than in previous years.
"We've just been going out there and doing
our job. Our stance has not changed at all," he
said. "We do not go out and try to find people vi
olating the law — but we will go and investigate
a party if we get calls about it being too rowdy."
Nevertheless, Niemeyer cautioned that police
are on the lookout for underage drinkers. "Stu
dents should know that if you are under 21 and
a police officer sees you walking around with al-
cohol, you will get busted," he
said.
Despite the highly publicized
defacement of the "Gay Libera
tion" statue last spring, vandal
ism on campus has also
decreased, with 83 violations in
1994 as compared to 117 in 1993.
"Vandalism can be anything
from destroying property to
defacing signs, and it is good that
it has gone down," Niemeyer said.
Another positive trend is the
decrease in bicycle thefts, down to
643 from the 1993 banner-year
figure of 829.
"Last year we caught a lot of
bike thieves — including a three
strikes offender, Jed Harlan
Miller," Niemeyer said. "Whether
that served as a deterrent, I don't
know, but we certainly were con
cerned about the large number of
thefts in 1993."
Niemeyer applauded the
increasing student awareness of
bike theft. "There has been
more proactive police work as
well as an increase in phone calls
about such things as suspicious
people hanging around bike
racks," he said. "We can always
do our job better when people
inform us."
Niemeyer added, however,
that the decrease in grand theft
from 266 to 240 was not as signif

icant because the decrease in the
numbers of very expensive moun
tain bikes being stolen was less
dramatic.
After three years with no
reported rapes, a rape was report
ed on campus in 1994.
"The victim was attacked near
Palm Drive during the day in
open space during the World Cup
games," Niemeyer said. "Immedi
ately we tried to increase aware
ness, and told women not to walk
in open areas, and to jog with
partners, especially in forest
areas or the Foothills."
Niemeyer explained that he
saw the decrease in campus sex

offenses — from 22 to eight — as
a positive sign. "The sex offenses
are usually cases of indecent
exposure, and we had very few
last year," he said.
The statistics also show a sig
nificant increase in firearm pos
sessions, many by people not affil
iated with the University. A cou
ple of people were caught with
weapons at football games,
Niemeyer said.
"Students should know that
bringing a firearm anywhere on
campus is a felony," Niemeyer
said. "Even if you want to have
one for hunting, you have to
make arrangements to store it."
