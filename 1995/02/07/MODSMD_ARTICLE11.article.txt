# CE prof sets up fund to study catastrophes

### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
Hoping to integrate the efforts of people
in engineering, humanities, business and
law, Civil Engineering Prof. Haresh Shah
recently established an endowment for the
study of catastrophic events.
The Shah Family Fund, which totals
more than $1 million, will foster research
on natural disasters and catastrophic risk
management, or "what nature does to us,"
Shah said.
The endowment will accomplish three
specific goals, he said: to bring world
renowned researchers to campus, to sup
port student research with fellowships and
to award a $1000 prize annually to a mem
ber of the faculty in the Civil Engineering
Department.
If all goes well, Shah said, the three pro

grams will be instituted by the next aca
demic year.
"I just felt these are the kinds of things
needed," said Shah, a world authority on
earthquake damage. The fund will facili
tate merging the work of different depart
ments together and will provide ways to
cope with natural hazards, Shah said.
One aspect of the program, Shah said,
will be to bring top researchers in the field
of catastrophic risk to give open lectures on
campus. The program will also provide fel
lowships to students, preferably in the
Civil Engineering Department.
Since "society needs so much more than
students are providing," Shah said he
hopes the fellowships will give
entrepreneurial students a chance to con
duct research in the field. The department
will advertise the annual fellowships after
plans are finalized.

Income from the endowment will also be
used for an annual $1000 prize for a mem
ber of the faculty who "shows devotion to
the University," Shah said.
The Shah Family Fund is set up by a
personal gift from Shah and from the
University's portions of royalties from
research advances of Risk Management
Solutions, owned by Shah's son Hemant.
Shah said he hopes the fund will go
towards "the perpetuation of educa
tion."
When he was chair of the Civil Engi
neering Department, Shah said he used to
convince donors to contribute towards
research, and now feels a responsibility to
give back.
Shah, who has been involved with
research on catastrophic events for
almost 27 years, is currently on academic
leave.
