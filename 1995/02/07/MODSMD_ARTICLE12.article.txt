## Clinton sends budget to Congress 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Clinton unveiled a $1.61 trillion budget
for 1996 yesterday that mixes mild tax
relief and spending reductions.
In the first fiscal outline that a
Democratic president has sent a GOP
controlled Congress since 1948, Clinton
heeded the popular mood by emphasiz
ing downsizing and efficiency. There is
no general tax increase, the Energy
Department and four other agencies are
shrunk and more than 400 mostly small
programs are slashed or combined.
The budget's centerpiece is $144 bil
lion in savings for the next five years,
when the government will spend nearly
$9 trillion.
Clinton would use $63 billion of the
reductions to lower taxes for millions of
middle-income families and savers, and
the remaining $81 billion to steady
annual deficits at about the $200 billion

level through the decade. The bottom
line for 1996: red ink of $196.7 billion,
$4.2 billion more than is expected in
1995.
Yet the savings yielded are but an
anthill compared with the task
Congress' new Republican chieftains
have set for themselves. Their proposed
tax cuts would cost nearly $200 billion,
and their pledge to balance the budget
by the year 2002 would take another
$1.2 trillion in savings, according to the
nonpartisan Congressional Budget
Office.
To trim the budget, Clinton proposed
cutting military spending, selling feder
al assets ranging from excess uranium
to power-producing dams and eliminat
ing another 36,000 government jobs.
That would bring to 173,000 the num
ber of slots in the bureaucracy erased
since Vice President A 1 Gore began his

effort to reinvent government in 1993.
New fees would be imposed on many
who deal with the government, includ
ing small businesses taking federal
loans and bureaucrats parking in their
agencies' garages. Charges of $3 per car
and $1.50 per person would be leveled
on people entering the United States
from Mexican and Canadian border
crossings.
The government would speed its
shift to loans made directly to college
students rather than costlier aid that
flows through banks, a change the GOP
opposes.
NASA would rely on private compa
nies to communicate with satellites, and
aid to Amtrak would be pinched. And
271 small programs would be folded
into 27 — mostly grants to state and
local governments for public health,
transportation, education and housing.
