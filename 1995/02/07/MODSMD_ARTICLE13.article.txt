House passes line-item veto
WASHINGTON (AP) - Hailing it as
one more win for the Gipper, the House
yesterday approved line-item veto legisla
tion designed to strengthen a president's
ability to cut wasteful federal spending.
Final passage, timed to coincide with
former President Reagan's 84th birthday,
came on a strong bipartisan vote of 294-
134. Opponents have vowed a vigorous
fight in the Senate.
The measure is an element of the
House GOP's "Contract With America"
that the leadership has vowed to vote on
within the session's first 100 days.
In a speech a few moments before pas
sage, Speaker Newt Gingrich stressed
that majority Republicans were acting
"without any gimmicks" to bestow

increased power on President Clinton, a
Democrat.
Critics say the measure would tip the
constitutional balance of power too heavi
ly in the president's favor at the expense
of Congress. Other lawmakers said it
would do relatively little to rein in deficits
now running at roughly $200 billion
annually.
On final passage, 223 Republicans and
71 Democrats voted in favor of the mea
sure, while 129 Democrats, four Republi
cans and independent Bernard Sanders of
Vermont were opposed.
Before final passage, Republicans
rejected an attempt by Utah Rep. Bill
Orton, a conservative Democrat, to expand
the line-item veto authority to a certain
type of highway project highly prized by
lawmakers. The vote was 360-65.
