Stanford should urge
instructors to try out
new teaching methods

THREE SCENES from out
side the typical Stanford
classroom:
At a local elementary school, a
resident in pediatric medicine takes
time away from the Medical Center
to answer kids' questions about
health and anatomy. In return, the
resident learns about how his
future patients act in their normal,
healthy everyday lives.
Near the Quad, mechanical engi
neering students pedal the bicycles
they have constructed from paper,
testing the theories they have
picked up in class.
In a room at the Law School,
Law Prof. Kathleen Sullivan is
grilled by her colleagues, preparing
her to argue before the U.S.
Supreme Court. A crowd of law
students watches, seeing some of
the country's greatest legal minds
enacting the process they study
every day.
These lessons show that learn
ing can take place beyond the con
fines of the classroom and the
structure of a lecture. Indeed, some
of the most enlightening educa
tional experiences at Stanford
come from such chances to move
from the realm of theory to prac
tice, from talking in the auditorium
to observing or participating in the
outside world.
Such lessons are somewhat com
mon in the sciences, where lab class
es are standard. Still, getting out
side the lab can be liberating, and,
with enough work, inventive meth
ods of teaching can be found for any
subject, humanity or science.
All the faculty members involved
in the three activities mentioned
above — and in the other campus
programs that put knowledge into
practice in creative ways — deserve
hearty congratulations for their

efforts. It can't always be quick and
easy to figure out new ways to
teach students, and students owe a
debt to those professors who go
that extra mile.
Stanford's administrators
should also be glad when profes
sors teach in creative ways. Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper and
other top officials have been trying
to give teaching as much weight on
campus as research. Original exer
cises that bring new vitality to
teaching at Stanford are a crucial
tool for instilling more respect for
the art of educating.
Accordingly, the University
should do everything it can to
encourage and support innovative
teaching programs, both with
praise and the pocketbook. Profes
sors should have great freedom to
experiment with new modes of
teaching, just as they can experi
ment with chemicals or economic
theories.
Deans and department chairs
should value creative and original
teaching programs as much as they
value creative and original
research, especially whtn consider
ing promotions and tenure.
Finally, students who enjoy
learning outside the traditional lec
ture format should encourage pro
fessors to create or continue inno
vative instructional methods. Stu
dents who have ideas for a new
learning exercise should discuss
them with a favorite professor.
The traditional lecture, of
course, will still play a crucial role
in the learning process. There is
much to be said for the directness,
simplicity and effectiveness of this
traditional teaching format.
Still, when alumni look back on
their time at Stanford they are as
likely — if not more likely — to
remember those teachers who
took the time to something new
and different. Long after the
lessons of trusts and estates have
been forgotten, the memories of
Prof. Sullivan arguing to a
supreme court of her peers will
remain.
