## Are grades that important? 
### 
THE FACT IS, I never really cared
about my grade point average
(GPA) or my letter grade indicator
(LGI) until I came to the realization that
I needed a decent one to find a job and
apply to law school. For the bulk of my
undergraduate career, I have thought of
my grades as an appendage to my classes,
not as an important factor in choosing
courses and certainly not as the focus of
my academic efforts. After all, aren't we
taught that it's more important to edu
cate ourselves and really learn than to
struggle for that magical 4.0 in the sky?
Maybe, maybe not.
I admit that for years I must have
been living in some sort of dreamy Utopi
an fantasy where grades didn't matter,
tiger salamanders lived in abundance and
Cultures, Ideas and Values (CIV) was an
intellectually stimulating set of courses.
Fantasy being the imperative word. The
issues that surround grading at this uni
versity are sometimes mind-boggling in
their inanity.
First of all, why is one's GPA so impor
tant to so many students? It may seem
unbelievable to some, but there are quite
a few Stanford students who have
dropped classes at the first hint that they
might receive a B+ instead of an A or A-.
Neurotic, you say? Well, of course it is,
but perhaps it's understandable consid
ering the apparent need for a good GPA
to "succeed" in life after Stanford. Once
again, I am struck by the fact that our

education system encourages students to
behave like this.
Doesn't anybody remember that class
es are supposed to be taken to learn, not
just to pad a transcript? The GPA/LGI
seems to loom over us like a Big Brother
of sorts, guiding our actions, giving us
undeserved angst and generally being a
pain to deal with. And lately, these appar
ently harmless acronyms have taken over
a disproportionate amount of campus
brain-space.
Now, on to the Grade Inflation Prob
lem (GIP). The GIP has, according to
some, led to unreasonably high GPAs,
especially in the humanities. The Univer
sity, of course, needed the Commission
on Undergraduate Education (CUE) to
address this issue. After much debate,
they concluded that, indeed, there is
grade inflation in certain departments
and, gosh darn it, students really didn't
deserve the grades that faculty had given
them.
Revealing the obvious to some, this
ludicrous debate managed to upset a lot
of students who felt that they deserved
all those A's that they received. Great. If
the faculty is so up-in-arms about grade
inflation, why don't they just grade hard
er in their classes? That seems like an
easy way to solve this perceived crisis on
campus.
However, we must confront the issue
of different grading systems across
departments. Here, we can easily take a

glance across the nation to several promi
nent universities on the East Coast that
have found a painless way to solve the
problem. There, in the bastions of the Ivy
League (IVY), a solution to the GIP was
created by not only displaying the grades
of a student on the transcript but also
noting the average grade received in each
class.
This is a simple way for grad schools
or employers to see that although Mr. X
did receive a 92 in a given class, the
class average was 94, so Mr. X's accom
plishments are really not that impres
sive. By the same token, Ms. Y's final
score of 68 doesn't look so bad when the
class averaged 57. Such a system
wouldn't alleviate the undesired need to
worry about grades, but it's a start
toward making the system more equi
table. And the extraordinarily small
amount of effort it would take to calcu
late and include the grade averages for
all classes would save us all a lot of time
in the future by forestalling the need for
CUE meetings about the GIP, LGI
and/or GPA.
And that, of course, is QED.
