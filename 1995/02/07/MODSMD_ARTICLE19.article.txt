Political action is responsibility of individuals, not ASSU

I AM WRITING in response to the
Feb. 6 letter submitted by Lance
Lange. Although I am in total accord
with him in finding the proposals of the
new Republican Congress alarming, I
disagree profoundly with his view that
the ASSU or the University have any
business responding to them in a politi
cized manner.
Both Stanford University and the
ASSU are diverse bodies, made up of
many individuals whose political, cultur

aland religious opinions cannot (with
very rare exception) be assimilated to
one voice. Because of that, the Bone
Amendment prevents organizations sub
sidized by the University or the student
body from engaging in partisan activi
ties. This is just. While I personally
might support an organization advocat
ing a liberal agenda, I wouldn't want to
be forced to pay for its opponents' "equal
time." My opponents would refuse to
foot the bill for mine.

Nevertheless, we are not hindered
from getting involved and speaking
out. And nobody is restricting Lange's
freedom of speech — they're simply
declining to pay for it. If Lange's sense
of obligation matches his sense of out
rage, he can form an advocacy group.
He can solicit time and money from
individuals who all share his views and
concerns.
We are each, individually, responsible
for social and political change, and for

defining and striving for the change we
desire. As a generation, we have inter
ests that our political elders will not
voice; indeed, they will neglect these as
long as possible. As adults, we must dare
not only to speak out, and to engage our
hearts and minds, but also (sometimes
more painful) our purses as well. We
have to pay full-price to get into this
show.
