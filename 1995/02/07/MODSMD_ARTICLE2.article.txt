## 
### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
As Assoc. Dean of Memorial Church Diana Akiya
ma prepares to leave Stanford in March, the Rev.
Christina Miller has already begun to fill her shoes
since being named interim associate dean in late
January.
Akiyama, the wife of Dean of Students Michael
Jackson, will be relocating with her husband to USC.
Dean of the Chapel Robert Gregg said Miller was
"talented and energetic." He added that the church
hopes to have someone permanent "by next fall, or
as a fallback by Jan. 1."
In the meantime, Miller will be assuming Akiya
ma's role and filling her place on numerous commit
tees "both in the church and out on campus," Gregg
said. Miller, however, has not had much time to dis
cuss her duties with Akiyama because she is cur
rently serving jury duty.
Miller said she was looking for a permanent posi
tion, but was happy to take the interim post at the
church.
"Its a homecoming for me," she said. Since the
19705, Miller has been involved with Memorial
Church, first as a member of the congregation and
now as a religious leader.
In the past, she was active in hospital ministries,
and for the last five years, she has worked in the
Allen Temple Church of Oakland.
As part of her duties, Miller will serve on a task
force related to sexual assault
and abuse, an area in which she
said she has considerable experi
ence.
Other assignments will
include counseling students who
"need a safe place to talk," she
said, adding that not all of the
one-on-one counseling will be
religiously oriented.
About half of Miller's time
will be spent on committees and
task forces, in addition to assist
ing with Sunday morning wor
ship. Miller preached for the
first time at Memorial Church
on Jan. 26.
Her other duties would vary
from day to day, since "a min
istry, like jazz, is an improvisa
tion of art," Miller said.
