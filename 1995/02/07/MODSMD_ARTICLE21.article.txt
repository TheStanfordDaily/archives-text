## Baseball to battle Hornets at home 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
The Sacramento State Hornets
couldn't have picked a worse time to
challenge the top-ranked Stanford
baseball squad.
The Cardinal (3-2) — coming off
a disappointing series in which it
dropped two of three games to Cal
State-Fullerton — looks to get back
to its winning ways today against
non-conference rival Sacramento
State (2-2) at 2 p.m. at Sunken Dia
mond.
"This is a really important game
for us," said sophomore relief pitch
er Tom Reimers. "We didn't play
too well in Fullerton and we need to
get back on track and prove that we
can really beat somebody."
Stanford is also looking for a bit
of payback against the Hornets who
upset the Cardinal three times last
season although they finished with
a 27-29 record. Two of those Sacra
mento State victories came at
Sunken Diamond, including a 7-0
trouncing last February.
Sacramento State "really took it
to us last year in games that weren't
even close," Reimers said. "But I
honestly believe that this team is a
lot different. We're a lot more
focused and we want to start
putting teams away."
Although their pitching staff is
unproven, the Hornets have one of

the best offenses in the Western
Athletic Conference, averaging over
seven runs per game in 1994.
The Hornets are led by third
baseman Derek Brown, a preseason
Ail-American, who posted a .385
batting average last year with 14
home runs and 56 RBIs. The senior
has picked up right where he left off
in 1994, batting .333 with two dou
bles and a home run on the young
season. His two-run homer on Sun
day against Chico State broke open
a tie game and gave Sacramento
State a 4-2 win.
And Brown isn't the only Hornet
who's been buzzing of late. Senior
second basemen Armando Balder
ramos has started the 1995 cam
paign in impressive style, posting a
team-leading .556 batting average
and an astronomical .765 on-base
percentage. Balderramos helped
propel Sacramento State to its first
win of the season against St.
Mary's, reaching base safely all four
times he came to the plate with
three walks and a double.
Hornets' right fielder Brian
King, also a senior, carries a hefty
.412 batting average into today's
game and has already stolen two
bases in the 1995 campaign. Catch
er Jason Kirtlan adds even more
punch to the Sacramento State line
up with a .308 average. The senior


Teressa Trusty — Daily file
Junior Todd Bartels fires one past a batter last season. Stanford
pitchers hope to duplicate this feat today against Sacramento
State.
