## Baseball to battle Hornets at home 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
The Sacramento State Hornets
couldn't have picked a worse time to
challenge the top-ranked Stanford
baseball squad.
The Cardinal (3-2) — coming off
a disappointing series in which it
dropped two of three games to Cal
State-Fullerton — looks to get back
to its winning ways today against
non-conference rival Sacramento
State (2-2) at 2 p.m. at Sunken Dia
mond.
"This is a really important game
for us," said sophomore relief pitch
er Tom Reimers. "We didn't play
too well in Fullerton and we need to
get back on track and prove that we
can really beat somebody."
Stanford is also looking for a bit
of payback against the Hornets who
upset the Cardinal three times last
season although they finished with
a 27-29 record. Two of those Sacra
mento State victories came at
Sunken Diamond, including a 7-0
trouncing last February.
Sacramento State "really took it
to us last year in games that weren't
even close," Reimers said. "But I
honestly believe that this team is a
lot different. We're a lot more
focused and we want to start
putting teams away."
Although their pitching staff is
unproven, the Hornets have one of

the best offenses in the Western
Athletic Conference, averaging over
seven runs per game in 1994.
The Hornets are led by third
baseman Derek Brown, a preseason
Ail-American, who posted a .385
batting average last year with 14
home runs and 56 RBIs. The senior
has picked up right where he left off
in 1994, batting .333 with two dou
bles and a home run on the young
season. His two-run homer on Sun
day against Chico State broke open
a tie game and gave Sacramento
State a 4-2 win.
And Brown isn't the only Hornet
who's been buzzing of late. Senior
second basemen Armando Balder
ramos has started the 1995 cam
paign in impressive style, posting a
team-leading .556 batting average
and an astronomical .765 on-base
percentage. Balderramos helped
propel Sacramento State to its first
win of the season against St.
Mary's, reaching base safely all four
times he came to the plate with
three walks and a double.
Hornets' right fielder Brian
King, also a senior, carries a hefty
.412 batting average into today's
game and has already stolen two
bases in the 1995 campaign. Catch
er Jason Kirtlan adds even more
punch to the Sacramento State line
up with a .308 average. The senior

also excels defensively, having
thrown out four of eight base run
ners trying to steal.
With a loaded lineup from top to
bottom, the Hornets hope to rattle
an already depleted Stanford pitch
ing staff. The Cardinal was forced to
use seven pitchers in extended duty
over the weekend in Fullerton and
returns to the Farm with a notable
lack of rested arms.
"The day off [yesterday] really
helped us," Reimers said. "It gave
our bodies a rest and mentally we're
still really hungry. All of the pitch
ers know that we have the potential
to be a dominant staff."
Sacramento State began the sea
son with a 6-2 loss at California a
week ago before returning home to
earn a split with St. Mary's and a
victory over Chico State.
"I'm happy to get the two wins

over the weekend because it builds
our confidence and puts us on the
winning track," said Hornets' head
coach John Smith. "It's going to be
a tough week for us, but I think it is
good for us to learn early how to win
on the road."
The Hornets have dominated
the Cardinal recently, holding a 7-2
advantage since moving to Division
I in 1990. They have also shown a
propensity to challen/ge the nation's
top-ranked team, dropping a 3-2
decision to then No. 1 Wichita State
in 1991.
Despite recent history, the Car
dinal insists that it will be ready for
the Sacramento State challenge.
"One of the knocks against our
team last year was the way we
played outside of our conference,"
Reimers said. "We thought that no
matter how we did we could just
turn up our performance in Parific
10 Southern Division games. We
really want to turn that around this
year and win a lot of non-conference
games."
