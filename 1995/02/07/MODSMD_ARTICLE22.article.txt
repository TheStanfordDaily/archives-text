Here comes the Cardinal, the
mighty, mighty Cardinal. And there
go the Trojans, the meek, meek Tro
jans.
The Cardinal men's swimmers
once again proved their superiority
over the rest of college swimming

this weekend, trouncing the Gau
chos of UC-Santa Barbara Friday
and popping the Trojans of USC
Saturday. While the whipping of the
Gauchos was expected, the Trojans
were supposed to provide the Cardi
nal with its last big challenge before
the Pacific 10 Conference finals in
early March. But the Stanford men
actually beat the Trojans by a larger
margin( 148-81) than they did the
Gauchos (146-83).
The Gauchos, who replaced the
now-defunct UCLA swimming
team in Stanford's schedule,
entered the meet as a sacrificial
lamb, expected to provide a warm
up for the Cardinal before their big
meet Saturday. And a warm-up
they were — the Cardinal nearly
swept the individual events until
Bob Noe of Santa Barbara pulled of
a victory in the final individual
event of the day, the 200-yard
breaststroke. A mild groin injury
forced Stanford breaststroke spe
cialist senior Kurt Grote to watch
from the bench.
Stanford's A and B teams started
the meet by placing first and second
in the 200-yard medley relay; team
members followed with a continu
ous pounding in the individual
events. The Cardinal swimmers
placed one-two-three in the first five
individual events, sealing the victo
ry-
Winners included sophomore
Jon Lischke in the 1,000 free, senior
co-captain Clay Tippins in the 200
free, junior Joe Hudepohl in the 50

free, junior Bryan Addleman in the
200 Individual Medley, junior David
Johns in one and three meter div
ing, freshman Tom Wilkens in the
200 fly, junior Scott Gagner in the
100 free, sophomore Matt Thomson
in the 200 backstroke and sopho
more Kevin Itadvany in the 500
free.
Saturday, the Trojans also failed
to give Stanford an exciting meet.
"USC has a handful of good guys
and that's all you need to have a
good dual-meet team," said senior
Ray Carey. "But some of their guys
swam slower than they did against
Cal [Friday], and those times
wouldn't have been enough to give
us a good meet."
After an initial spark, the Tro
jans appeared to quit. "They were
fired up for the first relay," said
Grote, "and me and two freshmen
[Sabir Muhammad and Scott Clay
pool] and a sophomore [Matt Mar
tin] won and they gave up...They
knew that we were going to win, and
just kind of rolled over."
After the first relay, the Cardinal
won all but two of the individual
events.
Before the meet, assistant coach
Ted Knapp said "the mental
approach is real, real important. We
can't dip in the well too often with
our physical and mental energy."
Thanks to the ease of victory, the
Cardinal did not have to approach
the well, much less dip into it. Nev

The Stanford swimming team jumped into action over the
weekend, downing both UCSB and USC by considerable mar
gins.
ertheless, it was an exciting win for
Stanford.
"I thought we did really well,"
said Grote. "We managed to keep
our energy up even though they
weren't really swimming the meet."
As the coaches had hoped, some
of the younger swimmers stepped
up and provided quality perfor
mances. Freshmen Muhammad
and Claypool helped provide the
spark in the first relay, with help
from sophomore Martin. Thomson
gained his second win in the 200
back in as many days; and Wilkens
placed second in both the 200 IM
and the 200 breast.
The Cardinal had two double
winners — Hudepohl won the 100
and 200 free and Johns took home a
double win. Other winners included

sophomore Radvany in the 1,000
free with his season-best time,
Brian Retterer in the 50 free, Tip
pins with a season best in the 200
IM, Thomson in the 200 back, and
Dan Kanner in the 500 free.
Despite the lack of competition,
the meet did have rewards.
"They were the last team to beat
us besides Texas. . . . The take
home for us was guys got some
great times which will be seed times
for the Pac-lOs," Carey said. "It was
exciting. It's exciting every time you
beat USC."
Once again the Cardinal has
taken a positive step towards the
Pac-lOs and the NCAA finals next
month.
"We're excited," said Grote.
"Everyone thinks we have a better
chance now than we thought earlier
in the season. The freshmen are
making good showings, the sopho
mores are coming around, and
everything's coming together."
