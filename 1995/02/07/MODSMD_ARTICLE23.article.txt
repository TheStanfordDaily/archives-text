games to the Tritons — San Diego's
high level of play and Stanford's
large number of errors.
"UCSD played really well,"
senior middle blocker Brian Garrett
said. "It was one of the better
matches I've ever seen them play.
Their defense was great, they were
coming up with everything."
The story on Stanford's side of
the net was veiy different for much
of the match. "We fell asleep for
awhile," sophomore swing hitter
Aaron Garcia said. "We've got to
give them credit, but it was a poor
performance on our part."
The Cardinal made mental and
physical errors of all kinds, includ
ing poor passing, lackluster defense
and an inability to serve tough and
disable the Triton passers. Howev
er, the players maintain that they
were confident of an eventual victo
ry; once Stanford settled down to its
own game, the Tritons fell rapidly.
"We were disappointed that we
didn't wi:i more decisively," Nieves
said, "but the most important thing
is that we managed to pull it out and

After their swing through San
Diego this weekend, Stanford men's
volleyball discovered both the peaks
and the valleys of their potential. In
a match expected to be a blowout,
the Cardinal Friday defeated the
UC-San Diego Tritons — the
league's worst team last year — in
five games, 14-16,15-4,13-15,15-2,
15-11. On Sunday, Stanford
snuffed out a much stronger San
Diego State squad in only four: 7-
15,15-6,15-8,15-8.
The Tritons had defeated the
Cardinal once in an unofficial tour
nament match, but that closely-con
tested victory came against Stan
ford's second team. This weekend,
the Cardinal attacked San Diego
with all its starters — yet still strug
gled to dispatch them.
"We all tried not to take [the Tri
tons) too lightly," said coach Ruben
Nieves, "but somehow when we
took the court we weren't ready to
play at a high level."
Nieves and his players gave two
main reasons for the loss of two

win. Hopefully this close scare will
help us next time we're in this situ
ation "
After a day off for practice Satur
day, the Cardinal refocused and met
San Diego State with all guns blaz
ing. In one of the better matches the
team has played so far, Stanford
combined an amazing sideout per
formance with tough blocking to
shut down the Aztec assault.
In that game, the Cardinal man
aged to accomplish two of the goals
it set out for this weekend: to return
to peak performance and to improve
its serve-receive.
"We played a very solid match
versus SDSU," Nieves said. "We
played at a level similar to our per
formance in the UC-Santa Barbara
Collegiate Invitational tourna
ment."
The Aztecs launched blistering
jump serves at Stanford to secure
game one. In the next three games,
however, Stanford's passers met
the Aztecs' service challenge,
demonstrating one of the most

amazing sideout performances of
the year.
Even against the toughest ser
vice the Cardinal had faced yet,
according to Nieves, Stanford
achieved a sideout-to-points yielded
ratio of nearly three-to-one.
"If you sideout two out of three
times you can usually win," Nieves
said, "But you're rarely going to lose
at a three-to-one ratio."
One concern for Stanford was
confronting the All-American swing
of senior John Hyden. However, the
Cardinal formulated and executed a
blocking scheme that effectively
shut down the Aztec hitters.
"We analyzed their offensive ten
dencies in every rotation, the specif
ic hitters that they would consis
tently set, and we came up with a
blocking scheme that worked out
really well," Garrett said.
As in most Stanford victories,
Ail-Americans sophomore opposite
hitter Matt Fuerbringer and junior
swing hitter Mike Lambert played
prominent roles, continuing to hit
at a very high percenta^.
"This Ls one of the better match
es we've put together all year," Gar
cia said. "When we were good this
weekend, we were as good or better
than anyone in the country."
