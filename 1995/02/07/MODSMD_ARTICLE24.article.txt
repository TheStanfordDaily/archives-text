# Losing my sense of wonder
## Getting old bites 
### 
How do I know that I'm get
ting older? It isn't because
every muscle aches after a
day on the basketball courts. It
isn't because I feel like how
George Bush looks. It isn't even
because after twenty years of
domination, I can finally be out
wrestled by my younger brother.

It's because I've lost my sense
of wonder.
I remember when I was a kid
how everything was shiny and
new. How the most trivial things
could spark my curiosity and fas
cination. A Tito Landrum single
was enough to excite me. A wob
bly Tony Eason pass could send
shivers down my spine. Almost

any play in any sporting event
had me running to tell my father
about it. Sports was the spice of
my life. When I wasn't playing,
watching or talking about sports,
I didn't feel alive.
Now I haven't thrown a base
ball around in years. I don't even
know who plays for the Mets any
more. And are the Whalers still
in Hartford?
I fell asleep during the Super
Bowl. Before Rice parted the
safeties for the game's first score.
Like the immortal Elmer Bruk
er, I was out before the opening
coin toss.
When my Niners blew the doors
off Dallas in the NFC title game,
I had to force myself to go down
stairs and heckle the Cowboys'
fans. My heart just wasn't in it.
When my beloved UConn
Huskies (you'll be hearing more
about them later in the year) got
utterly destroyed by Kansas on
national TV, I didn't even shed a
tear.
My lack of emotion during


Seth
Goldstein
these normally adrenaline-creating
events is beginning to frighten me.
I'm starting to turn into my father.
Despite the fact that he was
camped out on the couch every
evening and weekend watching
sports on the tube, I always had to
kick him to get him to sit up and
take notice.
It wasn't that he was lazy or
that he didn't care. It was just that
he was tired. He had bills to pay,
work to do and a wise-ass kid to
worry about. In other words, he
was old.
Still, I have to give him credit.
He didn't complain too much when
I'd drag him out to toss the football
around. And he always there when
my Little League team needed a

base coach. He didn't even mind
too much when I interrupted him
and Mom to tell him that the Mets
had traded for Gary Carter.
He'd always grin (after Mom
stopped him from straggling me)
and remark that was one reason
why he had me. To remind him
what it was like to be young. To
remind him what it was like to
have sports be the driving force in
his life.
Who's supposed to do that for
me? I don't have a kid to harass me
(and I won't for a very, very, very
long time). I'm bogged down with
responsibility and classes and job
searches and this editing job (Lord,
please take me now!). How can I
get back what I've lost? It looks
as if my father is going to return
the favor I did him. Since he kicked
me out of the house three years
ago, he seems to have mellowed out
a lot (maybe because he's not being

interrupted anymore). He calls me
up every few days to chew the fat
about the baseball strike or Rod
man's game of musical hairs. He
tries to keep my interest up.
Even my brother, who really
never shared my obsession, gives
me ring to tell me about his bud
ding track career. Apparently, he's
now known as "the fastest white
man in the state of Connecticut."
It's not the same as it used to be.
I don't think it can ever be.
But the constant badgering has
made me aware that the spark still
exists within me, even if the flame
doesn't burn as bright. I haven't
stopped searching for that sense of
wonder. So I've got that going for
me. And that's nice.
