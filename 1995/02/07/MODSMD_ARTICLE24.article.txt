# Losing my sense of wonder
## Getting old bites 
### 
How do I know that I'm get
ting older? It isn't because
every muscle aches after a
day on the basketball courts. It
isn't because I feel like how
George Bush looks. It isn't even
because after twenty years of
domination, I can finally be out
wrestled by my younger brother.

It's because I've lost my sense
of wonder.
I remember when I was a kid
how everything was shiny and
new. How the most trivial things
could spark my curiosity and fas
cination. A Tito Landrum single
was enough to excite me. A wob
bly Tony Eason pass could send
shivers down my spine. Almost

any play in any sporting event
had me running to tell my father
about it. Sports was the spice of
my life. When I wasn't playing,
watching or talking about sports,
I didn't feel alive.
Now I haven't thrown a base
ball around in years. I don't even
know who plays for the Mets any
more. And are the Whalers still
in Hartford?
I fell asleep during the Super
Bowl. Before Rice parted the
safeties for the game's first score.
Like the immortal Elmer Bruk
er, I was out before the opening
coin toss.
When my Niners blew the doors
off Dallas in the NFC title game,
I had to force myself to go down
stairs and heckle the Cowboys'
fans. My heart just wasn't in it.
When my beloved UConn
Huskies (you'll be hearing more
about them later in the year) got
utterly destroyed by Kansas on
national TV, I didn't even shed a
tear.
