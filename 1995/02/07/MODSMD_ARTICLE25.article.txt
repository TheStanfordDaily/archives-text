# Track off to quick start
## Gambling pays off at Reno Invitational 
### Matthew Lawrence 
Thrower Pete Swanson made $28 on the
slot machines in Reno, but that wasn't the
only success for the Stanford track teams
at Saturday's Bill Cosby Invitational.
The Cardinal track team displayed the
youthful talent that will define its 1995
season while calling on the proven leader
ship of several upperclassmen. Without
team scores at the Invitational, the empha
sis in Reno was on individual performances
— and Stanford provided just that.
The women's team showed its tradition
al strengths in the middle distance events
while drawing on the ability of younger
runners.
"It's positive to have such competitive
freshman come in because it pushes the
older people to do better," said junior co
captain Dena E>ey. "In the past the empha
sis has been more on individuals, but now
we have a team so the emphasis is more
team-oriented."
Dey's impressive second-place finish in
the 800 meters along with third- and
fourth-place finishes by freshman Sara
Moore and sophomore Leila Burr demon
strated the team's speed and depth.
"I'm happy," Dey said, "because it's a
better opening mark than I have had in the
past. "
In the mile, freshman Monal Chokshi
took second. "I definitely think that every
one is more excited," Chokshi said. "We're

filling in the gaps from years past. This is
the start of a great team. I sense a lot of
excitement."
In her first pole vault competition —
this is the first year that women can com
pete in the event — sophomore Tyra Holt
vaulted 11 feet, securing a No. 2 national
ranking. "It's retvlly exciting for our team
to have someone excelling in a new event,"
senior co-captain Christy Boyd said.
With so much talent across the board
the women are rightfully optimistic.
"I'm really excited for Big Meet [May 6]
and the Pacific 10 championships (May 19-
20]," Boyd said. "We'll be a team that oth
ers will have to contend with."
Several upperclass throwers turned in
the men's team best performances. All-
Pacific 10 Conference and All-American
senior co-captain Dave Popejoy led the
throwers with a toss of 59-11 in the 35-
pound weight to win the event. Senior Toby
Norwood finished second with throw of 56-
10 and sophomore Pete Swanson, who also
plays defensive line on the football team,
completed the sweep with a third place
heave of 56-3.
In the mile, sophomore J.J. White fin
ished second in 4 minutes, 13.2 seconds
with senior Erik Spayde on his heels in
third place. White's time converts to
approximately a 4:08 at sea-level, showing
the talent in the middle distance core.
Coach Lananna did not enter any
competitors in events longer than
the mile because of Reno's alti
tude.
The distance medley relay
team of Spayde (800 meters),
sophomore Jimmie Johnson (400
meters), White (1200 meters) and
freshman Jon Weldon (1600
meters) took first against a tough
Texas Tech team. Freshman
sprinters Anthony Bookman and
Branyon Davis showed promise in
the 55 meters as they narrowly
missed the finals. Brian Manning
triple-jumped a good early season
distance of 48-11/2.
"One point to be apprehensive

about," Popejoy said, "is that our
two big point scorers are coming
off injuries (Travis Clark, high
jumper and sprinter, and Rene
Rodriguez, an Ail-American in
the 400 meters]. In the long term,
some people might get nervous
but we have people who can
score."
This season, the emphasis is on
the youth of the team. Freshmen
and sophomores compete along
side upperclassmen and show a
great deal of confidence. The con
fidence and sense of excitement is
contagious.
"You have this feeling in the
back of your head," said junior
800 meter runner Joe Karlgaard,
"that these guys are going to run
fast. They [the underclassmen]
are helping to develop a good
team atmosphere. The rest of the

upperclassmen look at that and
say 'I better get moving if I want
to stay on the team.'"
Following the performances at
Reno, Coach Lananna said, "I
thought we had a good first meet.
What we wanted to get accom
plished, we got accomplished . ..
we're better than I expected."
Lananna may be surprised at
the successes of his team, but his
team expects even more in the
future. Everyone is waiting expec
tantly for the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Indoor Cham
pionships in Reno on Feb. 18.
The odds are that the Stanford
track team will succeed. The odds
are greater that Pete Swanson
will hit the one-armed bandits in
search of the big payout. Both
possibilities are a good bet for the
smart gambler.
