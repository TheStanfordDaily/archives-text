# Cardinal stars downed by pros
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
Bay Area tennis fans who ventured to the San
Jose Arena yesterday caught a glimpse of the
future as two of the world's top amateur players
temporarily traded in their Stanford uniforms in
favor of ATP Tour regulation shirts.
Scott Humphries and Jeff Salzenstein won't
get to pocket the $3,100 that full-time, touring
professionals receive for losing in the first round
of the Sybase Open (formerly the San Jose
Open), but they will get to savor the taste of
what it is like to play an event on the pro tennis
circuit.
Humphries fell to Italian Davis Cupper Diego
Nargiso, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), and Salzenstein was oust
ed by a former Stanford standout, Jonathan
Stark, 6-1, 6-1.
Humphries gave Nargiso, who is No. 151 in
the world, a run for his money, playing with the
confidence of a seasoned tour veteran and show

"You have to go in there thinking you can win
the match," Humphries said, "or else it's over
from the very first point."
There were times in the match when it
appeared that Humphries could win with his

methodical serve-and-volley
game. He converted 62 percent of
his first serves, some of which
registered as high as 120 miles
per hour. But Nargiso's consis
tency and velocity were about
equal, with both players winning
77 percent of their first-serve
points.
The reason Humphries did
not win the match is summed
up by the second-serve points
won: Nargiso took 58 percent
while Humphries won just 39
percent. This difference can be
explained by Humphries'
aggressiveness, what he called
his willingness to "take chances
and go for it."
The turning point in the

match came in the second set
with Humphries leading 2-0 and
trying to break Nargiso for a
second time in the set.
Humphries worked his way
toward a double break point. On
the first break point,
Humphries took a chance by
trying to clobber a first serve
instead of just keeping it in play,
resulting in a long return over
the baseline. Nargiso then sur
vived the other break point by
booming one of his seven aces
on the day; he followed by win
ning the next two points to hold
his serve and position himself to
get back the break that he need
ed in the next game.
"I didn't have many opportu
nities on his serve," Humphries
said, "so whenever I got one I
didn't want to let it go by."
Humphries said that the "lefty
spin" on the Italian southpaw's

quick serve gave him problems in
the first set, but that he became
used to it in the second set.
Though Humphries was the
youngest entrant into the tour
nament at 18, he did not hesitate
to argue several questionable
calls with the chair umpire. His
persistence apparently paid off
when the umpire moved the line
judge in question.
"With all the traveling I've
done and tournaments that I've
played in," Humphries said, "I've
realized that if you don't stick up
for yourself right away, they are
just going push you around fur
ther and further until they even
tually steamroll over you."
Jonathan Stark, who is ranked
No. 74 on the ATP circuit, came
close to steamrolling over Jeff
Salzenstein. A member of Stan
ford's 1990 NCAA championship
squad, Stark needed just 48 min

utes to dispatch of Stanford's
current No. 1 player, 6-1, 6-1.
Stark's 125 mph first serves and
solid service returns proved too
powerful for Salzenstein, who
managed to win only 12 of 42
points against Stark's serve.
"Stark is a top doubles player
[currently ranked No. 9 in the
world], so his serve and return
are his biggest strengths,"
Salzenstein said.
Salzenstein landed 62 percent
of his first serves, but only won
50 percent of those points, and
lost 12 of 17 points on his second
serve. He was able to hold serve
just twice — once at the end of
the first set and once at the start
of the second set.
Stark praised Salzenstein the
college player and also had some
tips for Salzenstein the future
pro. "Jeffs lefty serve is hard to
read, and it was messing me up,

especially on his second serve,"
Stark said. "If he can turn his
serve into an even bigger weapon
than it is now, then it can be a
real huge shot for him now and
on the tour."
If and when Salzenstein and
Humphries decide to turn pro —
common with past top Stanford
players — Stark said they would
be right at home. The ATP circuit
currently features seven former
Cardinal performers ranked
among the world's top 90 players.
"There's so many guys from
Stanford on the tour, and it's
nice," Stark said. "When I was
first out there, Patrick (McEn
roe] and Jeff (Tarango] helped
me out, and took me out to din
ner a few times."
Keep your eyes peeled next
time you eat at your local diner.
