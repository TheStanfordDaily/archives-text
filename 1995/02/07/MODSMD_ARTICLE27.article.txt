The Stanford hockey team
earned a berth in the National
Club Hockey Association
national tournament with an
impressive 6-1 victory over
arch-rival California before
1,500 fans at Berkeley Saturday
night. Senior Luke Winter,
Stanford's co-captain and top
scorer, led Stanford with a hat
trick while freshman goalie
Sami Jo Small — Stanford's
first female goalie — held Cal to
just one goal.
"In this game, we played as
well as any Stanford team I've
ever seen," said senior co-cap
tain Eric Haug.
Besides Winter's three goals,

senior Stefan Teitge, freshman
Eri Crum and Haug each had
one goal for Stanford. The game
was tied 1-1 after the first peri
od before Stanford came back
with five unanswered goals,
breaking the game open by the
third period. The action became
intense when graduate student
wing Shawn Sarbacker checked
a Cal player over the fence and
out of the rink.
The triumph, Stanford's first
against Cal this season after
tying twice, capped a winning
weekend as the Cardinal also
defeated San Jose State 4-2 on
Friday night in San Jose. The
game was close all the way;
although Stanford had three
times as many shots on goal as
San Jose State, they never broke
the game open. Stanford was led
by the solid defense of goalie Bill
Sutherland, while Sarbacker
and Teitge turned in two goals
each.
Stanford will make its second
trip ever to the national tourna
ment in Fort Collins, Colo.
March 1-4. In Albany last year,
the Cardinal defeated Illinois in
the round-robin portion of the

tournament but was later elimi
nated by Kentucky. The tourna
ment includes twelve teams,
each representing a region of
the country. Stanford will be the
West Coast representative to the
tournament; Colorado State,
which won the tournament last
year and is this year's host, will
be the top seed. Stanford should
be either the fourth or fifth
seed.
The schools that participate
in the tourney are mainly small
Eastern schools, Big Ten
schools without Division I teams
and some Southern colleges.
This year's seedings will be
based on records and last year's
finish in the tournament.
The team still has four games
left to play before the end of the
regular season. Stanford will
play two games at Arizona State
on Feb. 17 and 18 and will finish
the season with two games
against Cal, Feb. 24 at Stanford
and Feb. 25 in Berkeley. Though
the outcomes of these games
will not change who goes to
Nationals, they may affect Stan
ford's seed and are an important
warm-up for the tournament.
