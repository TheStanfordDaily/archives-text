Hoping to build on last weekend's character
revealing loss to Brigham Young University,
Stanford men's rugby team faced a difficult chal
lenge against St. Mary's Saturday. When the
game was through, however, the Cardinal had
realized the rewards of its hard work, coming
back with a convincing 29-5 victory over the
Gaels, ranked third in the conference. Mean
while, the women's team trounced Sacramento
State, 32-0.
Coming into the match, Stanford had hoped to
combine a strong technical performance with a
good team effort. Head coach Franck Boivert had
been struggling to implement a new passing game
and wanted to establish greater ball control.
Playing in muddy conditions, the Cardinal had to
adjust its game; the squad moved away from its
traditional passing game toward quick short
passes, a strategy which helped the Stanford
offensive attack, and more importantly, gave the

Cardinal the improved ball control it was seeking.
"I think it was a great victory," Boivert said.
The Cardinal made up for its inexperience by
drawing on new addition Brian Brennan, who
added a tremendous punch to the Stanford squad.
The senior was credited with helping the team gel
as a unit while providing tremendous individual
play. Brennan, who plays Prop — equivalent to a
lineman in football — brought a consistency that
had been missing from the Cardinal attack.
"Just one player can make a difference," said
Boivert on the newcomer's performance.
Joining Brennan as a bright spot on the day
was junior forward, Joe Clayton. Playing out of
position, Clayton provided offensive firepower for
the Cardinal in the form of three tries.
The win over St. Mary's gave the team a confi
dence boost and a foot in the play-off door. The
team will use this week to prepare for an upcom
ing stretch of two matches over three days; this
Saturday Sacramento State visits Maloney Field
and Monday Stanford hosts the
team from the No. 1 rugby pro
gram in North America — the
University of Victoria, Canada.
The women's squad also
found success this weekend.
Using the non-league match
against the Sacramento State
Hornets to prepare for the play
offs, the Cardinal turned in a
satisfying all-around perfor
mance.
"This is definitely the best
game they have played," said

coach Jennifer Chu. "Each
game has shown improvement."
Strong forward and center
play and a varied offensive
attack were two areas that
impressed Chu. Speed and fit
ness were also crucial to Stan
ford's success against the phys
ically bigger opponent.
Kalie Kim combined good
offensive play with aggressive
hitting and defense for a well
rounded individual effort. Cap
tain Jin Sun Park also sparked
the team's effort by providing
great support throughout the
match. Park turned in an out
standing performance all over
the field, Chu said.
