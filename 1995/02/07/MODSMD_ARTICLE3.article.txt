# Language departments hopeful for new, stronger requirements
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
A recommendation to strengthen Stan
ford's foreign language requirement means a
brighter future for language departments, say
foreign language professors, who see the
change as a sign of support from the Universi
ty.
"By saying that three years in high school is
not enough [foreign language study], the Uni
versity as a whole and the Faculty Senate in
particular are reaffirming the importance of
foreign languages," said History Prof. James
Sheehan, chair of the commission on Under
graduate Education, which recommended the
requirement change.

Foreign language professors say increased
support is welcome in an area that has felt bud
get strains recently, resulting in the scheduled
combination of several language departments
and the elimination of four tenure-track billets.
The senate last week approved the change,
which allows students to fulfill the require
ment by scoring a 4 or 5 on the Advanced
Placement test or 600 or better on the SAT
achievement test, by passing a proficiency test
or by completing three quarters of foreign lan
guage study at Stanford.
Formerly, Stanford's foreign language re
quirement could be met by taking at least
three years of foreign language in high school.
The changes will be implemented beginning
with the entering class of 1996-97.

Estimates of how many more students will
be required to take a foreign language at Stan
ford vary from just under 200 to 300, but pro
fessors say more students will not have a neg
ative impact on departmental budgets. Fur
thermore, they feel confident that the admin
istration will support any budgetary needs
that may arise.
Finding support
Morale was low in the foreign language de
partments last year after John Etchemendy,
senior associate dean for the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, eliminated four tenure
track faculty billets from foreign languages —

the only billets lost in the human
ities.
In addition, the combination of
some departments for budgetary
reasons — scheduled to take place
by next year — concerned lan
guage professors.
But professors now say they
believe the University will provide
funding for any new sections
necessitated by the change in
standards. In fact, with the pas
sage of last week's vote and the
ongoing establishment of a Lan
guage Center, another commis
sion recommendation, the future
looks bright for foreign lan
guages, they said.
Complaints by the language
departments last year "had to do
with matters of reorganization,"
Sheehan said, not a lack of sup
port. Still, he added, the change
"has got to be a good thing for
them."
"If there's an increase [in
enrollment], the University is
responsible," said French and
Italian Department Chair Ralph
Hester. "And we have every indi
cation that the University will
find the funding if it's needed."
"We hope that [funding] will
follow from the senate's discus
sion," said Faculty Senate mem

ber Thomas Hare, chair of the
Asian Languages Department. "I
think the dean's office is in favor
of this. I know the provost is a
very strong supporter of it. I
assume the backing will follow
through."

'We now have admin
istrators who are
exceptionally sup
portive. I've been at
Stanford 30 years
and I've never seen
it look so good.'
— Ralph Hester

Etchemendy said the Universi
ty funds language sections accord
ing to enrollment. For each 15
additional students — the average
class size — funding for a new sec
tion will be provided, he said.
"I would say it's more of an
opportunity than a problem,"
Hare said. "There will have to be
an increase in resources to a cer
tain extent. This gives us a chance
to broaden the exposure of incom
ing students to something they
might not experience otherwise."
Another commision recom

mendation for foreign languages
called for the creation of a Lan
guage Center.
The announcement for the
Language Center director posi
tion reads, "The director will
oversee foreign language instruc
tion in the University, work to
develop proficiency testing mate
rials, encourage the development
of computer-based instructional
materials and develop interdisci
plinary ties between the Lan
guage Center and our programs
in literature, linguistics and cul
tural studies."
"We will have a master teacher
specialist in foreign language
acquisition," Hester said. "We
have a lot of good teaching, but we
need this expert."
Hester said he found it signifi
cant that "the University is will
ing to back this enthusiastically.
It's not just numbers and dollars;
it's the willingness of the Univer
sity to make the study of lan
guages as good as possible."
"We now have administrators
who are exceptionally support
ive," he said. "I've been at Stan
ford 30 years and I've never seen
it look so good."
Manageable numbers
Guadalupe Valdes, chair of the
Department of Spanish and Por
tuguese and a commission mem
ber, estimated that 192 students
would be affected by the change in

the requirement. Statistics Prof.
Bradley Efron, a Faculty Senate
member, set the number closer to
300.
Neither number should cause
the departments much of a prob
lem, professors said.
"The chair (of the commission
subcommittee on the language
requirement], Guadalupe Valdes,
did a very careful statistical anal
ysis indicating that in fact not
many students in the end will be
affected by this requirement,"
Hester said.
Even if "you allow for a margin
of error," he added, "we're not
talking about enormous sums of
money."
Financial strains won't be a
problem "if those figures are
right," said Orrin Robinson, a
German professor and Faculty
Senate member. "Keep in mind
that those 200 students would be
distributed fairly evenly across
the board."
"It's not that big of a number
when you split it up among eight
or 10 languages," added Hare.
Hare said he estimated 10 to 15
more students might enroll in
Asian languages during the next
two years because of the require
ment. "But those things change
from year to year anyway," lie
added.
Variable enrollment
Professors emphasized that

enrollment is determined by a
number of different variables.
"In the mid '80s, enrollment in
first-year Japanese doubled unex
pectedly," Hare pointed out. "We

1 think the increases
will inevitably be in
the 'easier' lan
guages.'
— Thomas Hare

responded to that adequately, and
I expect we'll be able to do the
same thing this time."
"One should understand that
the picture could change with
another variable," added Hester.
"Students tend to do some experi
menting. ... If you in fact have
had most of your Spanish training
in high school and you find you
need one more quarter, you might
take that third quarter in Spanish
before you start experimenting
with Russian or Japanese.
"That could even reduce the
number of students who take lan
guages because of less experi
menting," he said. "It could be
that the picture will stack up a lit
tle bit differently. In any case, the
basic figure is so relatively low
that I don't think it's a budgetary
problem."

A tendency by students to ful
fill their requirement by continu
ing a language started in high
school will also mean that some
departments are affected more
than others, Hare added.
"I think the increases will
inevitably be in the 'easier' lan
guages," Hare said. "Taking an
Asian language takes more com
mitment."
But while Hare said most of his
classes have full enrollment right
now, Robinson said the German
department has room.
"We have some classes that are
underutilized right now," Robin
son said. "If we have, say, four
sections of German 1, sometimes
you end up with seven people or
so showing up. If the goal is 15,
we could certainly accommodate
eight new students."
New sections are likely to be a
necessity in Asian languages,
Hare said, adding that "right now
our language classes are pretty
much up to the limit."
Hester said the French and
Italian Departments "pretty well
maintain the optimum number of
students.
"It could be that out of these
182 students, there are 30 who
want to go on in French, and
they're placed in second or third
quarter," he said. "We may add a
few sections, but . . . that's defi
nitely not going to break the
bank."
A recommendation to strengthen Stan
ford's foreign language requirement means a

foreign language professors, who see the

subcommittee on the language
requirement], Guadalupe Valdes,
did a very careful statistical anal
ysis indicating that in fact not
many students in the end will be
affected by this requirement,"
Hester said.
Even if "you allow for a margin
of error," he added, "we're not
talking about enormous sums of
money."
Financial strains won't be a
problem "if those figures are
right," said Orrin Robinson, a
German professor and Faculty
Senate member. "Keep in mind
that those 200 students would be
distributed fairly evenly across
the board."
"It's not that big of a number
when you split it up among eight
or 10 languages," added Hare.
Hare said he estimated 10 to 15
more students might enroll in
Asian languages during the next
two years because of the require
ment. "But those things change
from year to year anyway," lie
added.
Variable enrollment
Professors emphasized that

enrollment is determined by a
number of different variables.
"In the mid '80s, enrollment in
first-year Japanese doubled unex
pectedly," Hare pointed out. "We

1 think the increases
will inevitably be in
the 'easier' lan
guages.'
— Thomas Hare

responded to that adequately, and
I expect we'll be able to do the
same thing this time."
"One should understand that
the picture could change with
another variable," added Hester.
"Students tend to do some experi
menting. ... If you in fact have
had most of your Spanish training
in high school and you find you
need one more quarter, you might
take that third quarter in Spanish
before you start experimenting
with Russian or Japanese.
"That could even reduce the
number of students who take lan
guages because of less experi
menting," he said. "It could be
that the picture will stack up a lit
tle bit differently. In any case, the
basic figure is so relatively low
that I don't think it's a budgetary
problem."

A tendency by students to ful
fill their requirement by continu
ing a language started in high
school will also mean that some
departments are affected more
than others, Hare added.
"I think the increases will
inevitably be in the 'easier' lan
guages," Hare said. "Taking an
Asian language takes more com
mitment."
But while Hare said most of his
classes have full enrollment right
now, Robinson said the German
department has room.
"We have some classes that are
underutilized right now," Robin
son said. "If we have, say, four
sections of German 1, sometimes
you end up with seven people or
so showing up. If the goal is 15,
we could certainly accommodate
eight new students."
New sections are likely to be a
necessity in Asian languages,
Hare said, adding that "right now
our language classes are pretty
much up to the limit."
Hester said the French and
Italian Departments "pretty well
maintain the optimum number of
students.
"It could be that out of these
182 students, there are 30 who
want to go on in French, and
they're placed in second or third
quarter," he said. "We may add a
few sections, but . . . that's defi
nitely not going to break the
bank."
A recommendation to strengthen Stan
ford's foreign language requirement means a
brighter future for language departments, say
foreign language professors, who see the
change as a sign of support from the Universi
ty.
"By saying that three years in high school is
not enough [foreign language study], the Uni
versity as a whole and the Faculty Senate in
particular are reaffirming the importance of
foreign languages," said History Prof. James
Sheehan, chair of the commission on Under
graduate Education, which recommended the
requirement change.

Foreign language professors say increased
support is welcome in an area that has felt bud
get strains recently, resulting in the scheduled
combination of several language departments
and the elimination of four tenure-track billets.
The senate last week approved the change,
which allows students to fulfill the require
ment by scoring a 4 or 5 on the Advanced
Placement test or 600 or better on the SAT
achievement test, by passing a proficiency test
or by completing three quarters of foreign lan
guage study at Stanford.
Formerly, Stanford's foreign language re
quirement could be met by taking at least
three years of foreign language in high school.
The changes will be implemented beginning
with the entering class of 1996-97.

Estimates of how many more students will
be required to take a foreign language at Stan
ford vary from just under 200 to 300, but pro
fessors say more students will not have a neg
ative impact on departmental budgets. Fur
thermore, they feel confident that the admin
istration will support any budgetary needs
that may arise.
Finding support
Morale was low in the foreign language de
partments last year after John Etchemendy,
senior associate dean for the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, eliminated four tenure
track faculty billets from foreign languages —

sity is reaf

languages.
— James
Sheehan
the only billets lost in the human
ities.
In addition, the combination of
some departments for budgetary
reasons — scheduled to take place
by next year — concerned lan
guage professors.
But professors now say they
believe the University will provide
funding for any new sections
necessitated by the change in
standards. In fact, with the pas
sage of last week's vote and the
ongoing establishment of a Lan
guage Center, another commis
sion recommendation, the future
looks bright for foreign lan
guages, they said.
Complaints by the language
departments last year "had to do
with matters of reorganization,"
Sheehan said, not a lack of sup
port. Still, he added, the change
"has got to be a good thing for
them."
"If there's an increase [in
enrollment], the University is
responsible," said French and
Italian Department Chair Ralph
Hester. "And we have every indi
cation that the University will
find the funding if it's needed."
"We hope that [funding] will
follow from the senate's discus
sion," said Faculty Senate mem

ber Thomas Hare, chair of the
Asian Languages Department. "I
think the dean's office is in favor
of this. I know the provost is a
very strong supporter of it. I
assume the backing will follow
through."

'We now have admin
istrators who are
exceptionally sup
portive. I've been at
Stanford 30 years
and I've never seen
it look so good.'
— Ralph Hester

Etchemendy said the Universi
ty funds language sections accord
ing to enrollment. For each 15
additional students — the average
class size — funding for a new sec
tion will be provided, he said.
"I would say it's more of an
opportunity than a problem,"
Hare said. "There will have to be
an increase in resources to a cer
tain extent. This gives us a chance
to broaden the exposure of incom
ing students to something they
might not experience otherwise."
Another commision recom

mendation for foreign languages
called for the creation of a Lan
guage Center.
The announcement for the
Language Center director posi
tion reads, "The director will
oversee foreign language instruc
tion in the University, work to
develop proficiency testing mate
rials, encourage the development
of computer-based instructional
materials and develop interdisci
plinary ties between the Lan
guage Center and our programs
in literature, linguistics and cul
tural studies."
"We will have a master teacher
specialist in foreign language
acquisition," Hester said. "We
have a lot of good teaching, but we
need this expert."
Hester said he found it signifi
cant that "the University is will
ing to back this enthusiastically.
It's not just numbers and dollars;
it's the willingness of the Univer
sity to make the study of lan
guages as good as possible."
"We now have administrators
who are exceptionally support
ive," he said. "I've been at Stan
ford 30 years and I've never seen
it look so good."
Manageable numbers
Guadalupe Valdes, chair of the
Department of Spanish and Por
tuguese and a commission mem
ber, estimated that 192 students
would be affected by the change in

the requirement. Statistics Prof.
Bradley Efron, a Faculty Senate
member, set the number closer to
300.
Neither number should cause
the departments much of a prob
lem, professors said.
"The chair (of the commission
subcommittee on the language
requirement], Guadalupe Valdes,
did a very careful statistical anal
ysis indicating that in fact not
many students in the end will be
affected by this requirement,"
Hester said.
