# Language departments hopeful for new, stronger requirements
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
A recommendation to strengthen Stan
ford's foreign language requirement means a
brighter future for language departments, say
foreign language professors, who see the
change as a sign of support from the Universi
ty.
"By saying that three years in high school is
not enough [foreign language study], the Uni
versity as a whole and the Faculty Senate in
particular are reaffirming the importance of
foreign languages," said History Prof. James
Sheehan, chair of the commission on Under
graduate Education, which recommended the
requirement change.

Foreign language professors say increased
support is welcome in an area that has felt bud
get strains recently, resulting in the scheduled
combination of several language departments
and the elimination of four tenure-track billets.
The senate last week approved the change,
which allows students to fulfill the require
ment by scoring a 4 or 5 on the Advanced
Placement test or 600 or better on the SAT
achievement test, by passing a proficiency test
or by completing three quarters of foreign lan
guage study at Stanford.
Formerly, Stanford's foreign language re
quirement could be met by taking at least
three years of foreign language in high school.
The changes will be implemented beginning
with the entering class of 1996-97.

Estimates of how many more students will
be required to take a foreign language at Stan
ford vary from just under 200 to 300, but pro
fessors say more students will not have a neg
ative impact on departmental budgets. Fur
thermore, they feel confident that the admin
istration will support any budgetary needs
that may arise.
Finding support
Morale was low in the foreign language de
partments last year after John Etchemendy,
senior associate dean for the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, eliminated four tenure
track faculty billets from foreign languages —

sity is reaf
firming the
importance
of foreign
languages.
