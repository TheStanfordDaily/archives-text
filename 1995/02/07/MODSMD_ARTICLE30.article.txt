Men's Tennis
The No.l-ranked Stanford
men's tennis team (2-0) will
face San Jose State today at
1:30 p.m. at the Stanford
Tenni√ü Stadium. Stanford
head coach Dick Gould is
likely to rest No. 2 Scott
Humphries after a long week
including, yesterday's Sybase
Open and the Rolex Intercol
legiate Indoor Doubles title
last Sunday. The likely
adjustment means that lower
players will be moved up one
position for this dual match;
freshman Misha Palechek
will make his dual match
debut at No. 6 for the Cardi
nal.
