U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno's
right-hand woman implored a group of
about 90 law students yesterday to use
their profession to benefit society — not
just to take the high-paying large firm jobs.
Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gore
lick — who serves as Chief Operating Of
ficer of the Department of Justice and is
immediately under Reno — gave advice
and discussed her duties in a speech at the
Law School. In 1993, Gorelick was named

Woman Lawyer of the Year by the
Women's Bar Association.
"My predecessor described the job as
being a member of the Olympic javelin
team and electing to receive," Gorelick
said, drawing laughter from audience.
Her message to the future elite of the
legal profession was a simple one: "If I can
give one piece of advice to law students —
make sure every day you are challenged
and avoid the easy tracks," Gorelick said.
"Find your own pace and be learningall the
time."
Gorelick has spent her life as a lawyer

going back and forth be
tween the public and pri
vate sector, something
which she said she feels
adds richness to her life
and practice.
"You are a market
force," she told the

crowd, adding that when more lawyers ask
to do public service outside legal firms,
more firms will have to accommodate the
practice.


Gorelick
"Getting involved outside
makes you more valuable," Gore
lick said. "If the organization you
are working for can't accommo
date, find another firm."
When she started out as a
lawyer, Gorelick said she had the

opportunity to learn a wide variety
of skills by choosing a small firm.
"We did almost everything there
was to do," she said. "We got to
know the clients as people."
Even though the ethics of those
in the legal profession have recent
ly come under fire, Gorelick was
optimistic, saying the legal profes
sion is in a unique position.
"I believe that the legal profession
holds itself to standards that no other

profession does," she said. "Unlike
any other profession, we hold the
keys to the courthouse door."
Gorelick also addressed the
recent controversy over immigra
tion reforms by stressing the
importance of compliance with
established laws. "If we can't see
the rule of law established at our
borders, we'll see an even bigger
backlash against legal immigration
than we have today," she said.
