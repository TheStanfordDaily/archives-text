# Justice official visits Law School

### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno's
right-hand woman implored a group of
about 90 law students yesterday to use
their profession to benefit society — not
just to take the high-paying large firm jobs.
Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gore
lick — who serves as Chief Operating Of
ficer of the Department of Justice and is
immediately under Reno — gave advice
and discussed her duties in a speech at the
Law School. In 1993, Gorelick was named

Woman Lawyer of the Year by the
Women's Bar Association.
"My predecessor described the job as
being a member of the Olympic javelin
team and electing to receive," Gorelick
said, drawing laughter from audience.
Her message to the future elite of the
legal profession was a simple one: "If I can
give one piece of advice to law students —
make sure every day you are challenged
and avoid the easy tracks," Gorelick said.
"Find your own pace and be learningall the
time."
Gorelick has spent her life as a lawyer

going back and forth be
tween the public and pri
vate sector, something
which she said she feels
adds richness to her life
and practice.
"You are a market
force," she told the

crowd, adding that when more lawyers ask
to do public service outside legal firms,
more firms will have to accommodate the
practice.
