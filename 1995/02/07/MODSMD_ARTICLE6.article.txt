# For children's sake, making a difference
## Conference tries new activities for kids 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
Last Friday afternoon, squeals
of delight rang from the Beech
wood Elementary School play
ground. The children, however,
were not eager to get home, but to
stay at school.
About a dozen Stanford ath
letes had come to Beechwood to
play games with almost 100 ele
mentary school children as part of
a community service project spon
sored by the Haas Center for Pub
lic Service.
Friday's festivities were the sec
ond event in a series of programs
sponsored by Stanford's You Can
Make A Difference project
(YCMAD).
In a break with past years, this

year's project coordinators have
chosen to include a number of
other events — including a youth
poetry contest and a public service
internship workshop with Stan
ford-in-Government — along with
YCMAD's annual April confer
ence.
In order to promote this year's
theme, "Nurturing Our Children:
A Renewed Commitment to the
Future," YCMAD chose to com
bine efforts with Together Each
Achieves More. TEAM sends Stan
ford students daily to local elemen
tary and junior high schools to or
ganize sports and art projects for
the students.
Sophomore Emily Behr, one of
YCMAD's publicity directors, said
