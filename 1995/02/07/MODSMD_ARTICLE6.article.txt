# For children's sake, making a difference
## Conference tries new activities for kids 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
Last Friday afternoon, squeals
of delight rang from the Beech
wood Elementary School play
ground. The children, however,
were not eager to get home, but to
stay at school.
About a dozen Stanford ath
letes had come to Beechwood to
play games with almost 100 ele
mentary school children as part of
a community service project spon
sored by the Haas Center for Pub
lic Service.
Friday's festivities were the sec
ond event in a series of programs
sponsored by Stanford's You Can
Make A Difference project
(YCMAD).
In a break with past years, this

year's project coordinators have
chosen to include a number of
other events — including a youth
poetry contest and a public service
internship workshop with Stan
ford-in-Government — along with
YCMAD's annual April confer
ence.
In order to promote this year's
theme, "Nurturing Our Children:
A Renewed Commitment to the
Future," YCMAD chose to com
bine efforts with Together Each
Achieves More. TEAM sends Stan
ford students daily to local elemen
tary and junior high schools to or
ganize sports and art projects for
the students.
Sophomore Emily Behr, one of
YCMAD's publicity directors, said
that activities with direct contact

Ellen Blair — Daily
between Stanford students and
community children are the crux
of the YCMAD mission, because
they afford both groups an oppor
tunity to learn from one another.
"It is important for students
to realize that they are a part of
the community and it is impor
tant for children to have person
al attention," Behr said. "Also,
at a basic level, I think that play
ing games with children helps
the athletes remember that they
got involved with sports because
they are fun."
Athletics are often an effective
way for children to find the guid
ance and support necessary to
keep them involved in healthy
lifestyles, Behr added.
"Sports teach you a lot of qual
ities you can use in your life," said
junior Marlon Evans, a wide
receiver on the football team who
participated in Friday's activity.
"It teaches you how to work hard
and it teaches you how to work
with other people."
Evans added that he enjoyed
the chance to play with the chil
dren. "Just looking at the kids
and seeing how much they enjoy
playing football is great," he said.
"It's nice to remember that it is
just a game and it's for fun. It is

not this intense thing we make it
out to be sometimes."
Sophomore Melanie Corn, the
director of YCMAD's on-going
events committee, emphasized
that athletics are not the only
avenue to success.
"The point of this activity is to
stress that while sports are
important, it is also important to
do well in school," Corn said.
"The reality is that most of the
kids will not become multi-mil
lionaires by staying with their
sports. Kids need to excel at what
they can do best."
Beechwood fourth-grade
teacher John Lawrence said
that although sports are
important to elementary
school students, it is unrealis
tic to offer athletics as a replace
ment for academic success.
"A lot of these boys are very
focused on sports. Sports is all
they ever talk about," Lawrence
said.
Lawrence added that the Stan
ford volunteers provided good
examples of both academic and
athletic achievement. "Some of
the children's parents tell them
to get good grades. But if their
parents aren't working they
might think there is nothing out
there for them. The best way to
get up and out is to have good
guidance and not get coaxed into
wrongdoing," he said.
As a preliminary to Friday's

activities, the athletes and the
coordinators of YCMAD met to
discuss the implications of being a
role model. Sophomore Eli Swin
ton, a defensive back on the foot
ball team, said adults had a
responsibility to modify their
behavior around young children.
"It's all about faces," Swinton
said. "You have a different face
you put on with your peers, with
your teachers and with kids. It is
important to be a positive influ
ence when you are around kids."
Though Lawrence said he wor
ried that games like football and
soccer would exclude elementary
school girls, YCMAD also invited
a group of female athletes and
cheerleaders.
"At first, I thought there
weren't any little girls at the play
ground," Behr said. "But then I
looked across the field and saw
them all with the cheerleaders."
The group of girls had effec
tively confiscated the cheerlead
ers' pompons and were busy prac
ticing new cheers. At one point a
group of six girls formed a line
and sang the "Here we go, Stan
ford!" cheer in unison.
Although the children and the
athletes played together for an
hour, many of the athletes were
reluctant to leave. "We want
more," said senior Alan Gonzalez,
a former member of Stanford's
football team. "Let's bring the
children out again!"
