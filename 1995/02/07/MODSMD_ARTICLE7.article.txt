# New IDs on hold until fall
## 
### Ben Sussman Contributing writer 
Students hoping to receive new
universal identification cards
sometime during spring quarter
will now have to wait a little longer.
According to Assoc. Registrar
Jack Farrell, the cards — which
have already been delayed from
winter to spring quarter — will
now be delayed again until next fall
quarter.
Farrell said that the most recent
delays stem from decisions to up
grade the card's capabilities, possi
bly using it as a debit card for cam
pus facilities such as washing ma
chines.
No matter what extra capabili
ties are added, however, the new
identification cards will include
photos of their owners and mag
netic strips on the back, allowing
them to be uf*ed aa both meal cards
and libraiy cards.
Further complicating matters is
the fact that the University li
braries and Dining Services run on
different systems.
"We want all of these applica
tions to run through one card,"
Farrell explained.
Farrell said he expects that the
University will start taking photos
sometime in the next two months,
and that the cards will be ready by
fall quarter, with the possibility of
a summer quarter release date.
Before that can happen, howev
er, the University must first choose
a financial institution to help
implement the system.
Once that partnership is
formed, University officials can
decide on the capabilities that they
wish to include on the card and
begin to encode that information
on the cards.
Those capabilities may range
from a simple combination of library
and dining functions to a more com

plex debit system which would allow
students to pay for campus services
with no cash needed.
"We're still learning a lot about
this technology," Farrell said,
adding that other universities,
including Florida State University
and Duke University, have insti
tuted such systems — including in
some cases the ability to use the
identification cards as keys for res
idences.
Farrell said, however, that
"Stanford is a long way from that."
Once encoding begins, card pro
duction will be fairly easy because
the University already owns the
equipment necessary for comput
erizing student photographs and
storing the information necessary
for the card, he explained.
Previous delays in the produc
tion of universal student identifica
tion cards were due to delayed
delivery of plastic card stock. Far
rell said the stock is due to arrive
this week.
