# New IDs on hold until fall
## 
### Ben Sussman Contributing writer 
Students hoping to receive new
universal identification cards
sometime during spring quarter
will now have to wait a little longer.
According to Assoc. Registrar
Jack Farrell, the cards — which
have already been delayed from
winter to spring quarter — will
now be delayed again until next fall
quarter.
Farrell said that the most recent
delays stem from decisions to up
grade the card's capabilities, possi
bly using it as a debit card for cam
pus facilities such as washing ma
chines.
No matter what extra capabili
ties are added, however, the new
identification cards will include
photos of their owners and mag
netic strips on the back, allowing
them to be uf*ed aa both meal cards
and libraiy cards.
Further complicating matters is
the fact that the University li
braries and Dining Services run on
different systems.
