# No tents
## Sorority Rush will go casual 
### Arnold Ceballos Contributing writer 
This April, there will be no clap
ping or singing on Wilbur Field.
Major changes to the upcoming
Sorority Rush are meant to elimi
nate some of the high costs and the
"spectacle" aspect of the past, ac
cording to this year's organizers.
The Rush period, a formal set of
events to introduce Greek life on
campus to prospective members,
will be scaled back this year from
the loud seven-day program previ
ously held in large tents on Wilbur
Field.
It will be replaced by a "more
casual" five-day schedule in Es
condido Elementary School, said
Britt Wahlin, Rush chair for the
Intersorority Council.
Rush will run from April 7 to
April 11. In the past, rushees
spent the first couple of days at
tending introductory events with
each of the six sororities, which
are unhoused. This year, rushees
will visit all of the sororities in one
day and there will fewer but longer
total days, Wahlin said.
"It's very exhausting and it
consumes a lot of your energy,"
she noted. "We're introducing
Rush earlier during the year
through things like Rush panels so
that you don't need so many days
during the formal Rush period."
Other factors — such as the
noise generated by approximately
240 rushees, the unpredictability
of the weather and the cost of stag
ing the program — also led to a
search for alternatives, said Rush
Co-Chair Cornelia Ercklentz.
She added that expenses includ
ed more than $7,000 for the rental
of the tents, a generator and night
time security guards. The ISC is
still negotiating a rental fee with
Escondido School, but
it should work out to be "substan
tially less than last year," Erck
lentz said.
Organizers were concerned
about the cost for rushees, who
paid a fee of $20 last year to go
through the process. Ercklentz
said she expects the fee to be
reduced "by about 50 percent" this
year.
"The whole aim is to make it

easier on the sororities and better
for the rushees," she said. "We
want it to be comfortable and
relaxed and not showy like at other
schools.
"We're trying to move away
from the whole rah-rah idea, so we
found that it was needless to spend
all that money," Ercklentz noted.
Wahlin agreed, saying the
changes, while significant, will
lead to a "less spectacle-like" atmo
sphere.
The annual Greek Week, a peri
od when sororities and fraternities
celebrate Greek life on campus,
will feature a pre-Rush informa
tion session on February 28 in
Kimball Dining Hall.
Wahlin said this session is
intended to "demystify the system
before formal Rush begins" by giv
ing potential rushees an opportu
nity to meet members of fraterni
ties and sororities and to ask ques
tions about the Greek system.
