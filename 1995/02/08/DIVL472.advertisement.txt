DAVID HILLIARD
THIS SIDE OF GLORY:
AMERICA and the
BLACK PANTHER
PARTY
As chief of staff of the Black
Panther Party, David Hilliard was actively involved in every major
activity of the best recognized and most feared African-American
organization of the 1960's and 7O's.
Hilliard is author of the book, This Side of Glory, a compelling
personal narrative and an eyewitness account of the Black
Panthers that reclaims a piece of history long obscured and now
almost lost. David Hilliard's candid life story illuminates this
revolutionary movement, and sheds light on America's present
racial and political troubles.
David Hilliard, a vibrant voice from our recent history, speaks
eloquently to the racial divisions in America today.
