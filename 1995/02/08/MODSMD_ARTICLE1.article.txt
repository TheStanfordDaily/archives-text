# Bauer to be dean

### Martin L. Yeung Contributing writer 
Calling this a "crucial" time
for Stanford Medical Center,
University officials announced
three major appointments to key
positions in the School of Medi
cine and Stanford Health Ser
vices yesterday.
University President Gerhard
Casper appointed Eugene Bauer
dean of the Medical School while
Provost Condoleezza Rice
named Victor Dzau chair of the
Medical School's Department of
Medicine. The SHS board of di
rectors also elected Peter Van
Etten president and chief execu
tive officer of SHS, a position he
has held on an interim basis
since last April.
Bauer — presently the chair
of the Medical School's Depart
ment of Dermatology — will as
sume his new post in April, and
Dzau, currently the chief of the
division of cardiovascular medi
cine, will start his job May 1.
Despite yesterday's appoint
ments, the position of vice presi
dent for medical affairs remains
unfilled, and administrators said
an advisory committee appoint
ed by Casper will continue
searching for someone to fill the
post for several more months.
Both Bauer and Van Etten will
report to the new vice president.
The leadership changes come
as part of major reforms at the
Medical Center resulting from
last spring's creation of SHS,
which includes the clinical opera
tions of Stanford Hospital, the
Medical School and closely affili
ated local physicians.
Last August, David Korn,
dean of the Medical School, an
nounced that he would step
down from his post in order to
allow the University to imple
ment plans for reorganizing the
Medical Center's leadership po
sitions.
But yesterday's announce
ment signaled an acceleration of
plans, as Korn was originally not
supposed to step down until this
August.
"I concluded that we need rel
atively long-term leadership in
the Medical School sooner, rather
than later," Casper said in a state
ment.
Bauer, Van Etten and Dzau all
expressed excitement about the
upcoming challenges of their new
roles.
Bauer said that future chal
lenges include dealing with issues
of the changing health care envi
ronment and federal reimburse
ment programs.
"I am eager to continue the
work begun by David Korn, and to
work with my colleagues in the

School of Me
dicine and with
leadership of
SHS and
Packard Hospi
tal to conceive
and implement
programs that
will continue
Stanford's posi
tion in the first

rank of academic medical cen
ters," he said in a statement.
Van Etten said his immediate
priorities include completing the
merger between Stanford Hospi
tal and the faculty practice pro
gram, as well as further develop
ing a strategic plan for the new
organization of SHS.

"During the
past six months,
our efforts have
focused upon
integrating
physician and
hospital activi
ties with the
establishment of
SHS," he said in
a statement.

"Now we need to ensure that the
new organization meets the health
care needs of our community while
supporting our academic mission."
Robert Cutler, senior associate
dean for faculty affairs at the
Medical School, said one of the
biggest challenges facing the new
top administrators will be to

develop SHS into a viable and suc
cessful entity.
Cutler said Bauer had "a hard
act to follow" in Korn, but added
that the new dean will do "a splen
did job."
"I'm very pleased," Van E,tten
said of the new appointments.
"I've worked with both [Dzau and
Bauer] closely. They will make
significant contributions to their
new roles."
Many have credited Korn as one
of the key architects of Stanford's
top-ranked medical programs.
Korn said in August that he was
only stepping down from the post
of dean of the Medical School —
where he has served for the past 11
years — and not retiring.
