# 'A woman isn't a female man'
## Med School plans gender-based curriculum 
### Elisabeth Morse Contributing writer 
Citing a lack of emphasis on female medical
issues, the Stanford School of Medicine will
soon implement a new curriculum focusing on
women's health care.
"Just as a child isn't a small adult, a
woman isn't a female man," said Ellie Segal, a
Voluntary Clinical Faculty professor and
physician in the division of family and com
munity medicine.
The Medical School will be starting with at
least three changes: increasing gender inclu
siveness in research — for example, by having
more women serve as experimental subjects;
using these experimental results both in
teaching and developing new techniques; and
creating a women's health specialty in the
Medical School.
In addition, the Medical School is altering
its curriculum to include women's health
issues from the beginning of a student's edu
cation, said Medical School student Jo Dean
Nicolette, coordinator of the women's health
curriculum.
"A curriculum which focuses on women's

health from the beginning of life to the t
life can really promote the concept of worn
as people," Segal said.
Women's health issues will be incorporate
into the curriculum in two main wa\

even requiring, faculty members to inclu
