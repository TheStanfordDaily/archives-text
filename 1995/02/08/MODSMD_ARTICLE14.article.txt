## Juror replaced in Simpson trial 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -
Another juror in the O.J. Simpson
trial was replaced yesterday, and
the judge sternly warned the
newly reconstituted jury not to
discuss anything in the case â€” not
even what the lawyers are wear
ing.
Judge Lance Ito's office said
the woman was removed because
her arthritis doctor may be called
as a witness for Simpson, who
claims bad knees and arthritis
rendered him incapable of stab
bing to death his ex-wife and a
friend.
The 63-year-old white juror, a
retired legal secretary, was
replaced by an alternate, a 54-
year-old black man and postal
operations manager.
The 12-person jury now has
nine blacks, one white and two
mixed-race members; there are
seven women and five men. Nine
alternates remain.
Prosecutors, meanwhile, began
presenting witnesses to establish
the timeline for the June 12 mur
ders of Nicole Brown Simpson and
Ronald Goldman.
Ito did not explain to the rest
of the jury why one member was

replaced. The move came after a
two-hour private meeting
between attorneys and the judge
that dealt with what Ito told the
jury were "very delicate mat
ters."
Later, in dismissing the jurors
for lunch, he elaborated on his
usual warning not to discuss the
case.
"You are not to discuss how
long the case is taking. You're not
to discuss what goes on at side
bar," he said. "You're not to dis
cuss the apparel of the attorneys.
You're not to discuss the person
alities of the courtroom person
nel. Anything that is connected
with this case, you may not dis
cuss amongst yourselves."
He did not say what prompted
the warning, but prosecutor Mar
cia Clark's short skirts have been
a topic of discussion inside and
outside court.
Myrna Raeder, a professor at
Southwestern University School
of Law, said she had never heard
of a warning not to talk about
lawyers' clothes.
Two other jurors were dis
missed last month without expla
nation from the judge. But news

reports said one, a Hertz employ
ee, had met Simpson during a
company function, and the other,
a woman, was in an abusive rela
tionship.
"We're down to nine alter
nates in a trial that has presum
ably four months to go," said
Robert Pugsley, another law pro
fessor at Southwestern. "I have a
distinct fear that they could run
out of jurors."
As testimony began for the
day, prosecutors called employees
of Mezzaluna, the restaurant
where Goldman worked and
Nicole Simpson ate her last meal.
Waitress Tia Gavin testified
that she served dinner to Nicole
Simpson's party, which included
mostly family members who had
attended a dance recital for Simp
son's daughter. They left the
restaurant at about 8:45 p.m.,
Gavin said.
Bartender Stewart Tanner
said he believed Goldman fin
ished his shift and probably left
the restaurant between 9:45 p.m.
and 9:50 p.m. Tanner said Gold
man walked past him toward the
door, but he didn't actually see
him leave.
