# Clinton chooses new CIA chief

WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton has chosen a recently retired Air
Force general with a reputation as a strong
manager to take over the CIA in one of its
most turbulent periods, administration
and congressional officials said yesterday.
The selection of Gen. Michael P.C.
Cams, 57, as director of central intelli
gence is to be announced this week, said an
administration official, who spoke on con
dition of anonymity.
Congressional committees that oversee
the CIA have been notified of the White
House's choice, said a congressional offi
cial, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity.
Cams would replace R. James Woolsey,
who abruptly announced his resignation
last December and left the post in early

January.
Cams, if confirmed by the Senate,
would be the first military officer to head
the CIA since Stansfield Turner, a retired
Navy admiral, held the post during the
Carter administration, and only the third
in the past 30 years.
Adm. William Studeman, who was
deputy CIA director under Woolsey and
has been the acting head since Woolsey
left, would have to leave if Cams takes
over because the National Security Act of
1947 that created the Central Intelligence
Agency says military officers may not hold
the top two spots simultaneously.
People who worked with Cams during
his 35-year Air Force career said yesterday
they believed he would do well even
though he never worked for an intelligence

agency.
Retired Gen. Michael Dugan, a former
chief of staff of the Air Force, said he has
known Cams for about 35 years and con
siders him an excellent choice for CIA
chief.
"He brings great depth of experience
and respect for how government agencies
work," Dugan said. "He has the ability to
bring together diverse groups, and not
only do it with a nice touch but also as
someone who thinks ahead. In the Air
Force he was known as a thinker and a
planner" more than as a warrior.
Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., the
ranking Democrat on the House Intelli
gence Committee, applauded the Cams
choice and predicted, "He'll be easily con
firmed."
