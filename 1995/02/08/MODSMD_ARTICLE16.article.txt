Palestinian arrests
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) â€” Yasser
Arafat's troops yesterday rounded up
dozens of followers of a radical Syrian
based faction suspected in a deadly ambush
on Israeli security guards.
Arafat is under pressure from Israeli
leaders who have told him they would not
agree to expanding Palestinian self-rule to
the West Bank unless he foiled attacks on
Israelis.
"We won't permit these groups to harm
the Israelis, the Palestinians or the peace
process," Arafat said. "We'll continue, in
our way, to deal with ... all these fanatic

and extremist forces."
Yesterday's sweep targeted the Demo
cratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
a Damascus-based group that claimed
responsibility for Monday's ambush in
Gaza, in which one Israeli security guard
was killed and another wounded.
Nihad Abul-Ghosh, a leading DFLP
member, said the arrests began at dawn
when police rounded up 35 activists. Police
later picked up 10 more at the DFLP office
in Gaza City.
Palestinian officials said about 60 of the
70 people sought were in detention. Police
also carted away boxes with documents and
files, said shopkeepers who witnessed the
raids.
