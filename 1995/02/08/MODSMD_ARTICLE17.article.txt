# Exasperated president summons players and owners to White House
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Clinton found out yesterday
what most baseball fans already
knew: the players and owners will
resist compromise with all their
might.
The president's hand-picked
mediator gave both sides his sug
gestions for settling the six-month
strike, but got nowhere. Players
and owners, along with their
lawyers, were then summoned to
the White House, perhaps to per
sonally face the frustrated com
mander-in-chief.
Clinton, Vice President A 1 Gore
and several White House aides met
with mediator W.J. Usery for 35
minutes in the Oval Office. Usery
brought with him an outline on
how to resolve the dispute, but did
not disclose those plans to
reporters.
White House aides said there
was a possibility that the players
and owners would be asked to
accept binding arbitration.
"The president was exasperated

that there was no progress toward
settling the baseball strike," White
House spokesman Mike McCurry
said.
Both sides had received an out
line earlier in the day. They did not
discuss what was in the plans but
clearly were not pleased.
"It's not something we are
going to accept," one player agent
said, speaking on the condition he
not be identified.
Earlier yesterday, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich and Sen
ate Republican Leader Bob Dole
discouraged turning to Congress
for a solution.
Clinton has no legal power to
end the strike, and would need
GOP support to force either the
terms of a settlement or binding
arbitration.
"I think that between balanced
budget, welfare reform, Medicaid
reform, trying to get a budget
passed, etc., that I'm not sure
Congress is the right place to try to
organize the national pastime,"

Gingrich said at a news conference.
"So I'd be very, very cautious."
With spring training due to
start a week from Thursday, the
strike appeared no closer to con
clusion than when it began Aug.
12. Union lawyers speculated that
Clinton and Usery might tiy to
persuade them to accept binding
arbitration.
"We'll just have to see what
they offer," Detroit's Cecil Fielder
said.
The sides, which have warred in
hotel after hotel for month after
month, were to begin their White
House sessions in the Roosevelt
Room, probably with Usery, Labor
Secretary Robert Reich and deputy
White House counsel Bruce Lind
sey on hand.
Representing the players were
Fielder, Atlanta's Tom Glavine,
Pittsburgh's Jay Bell, Kansas
City's David Cone, free agent Scott
Sanderson, union head Donald
Fehr and associate general counsel
Eugene Orza.
