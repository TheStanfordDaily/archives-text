WHILE THE STUDENT ref
erendum on CA-1, the pro
posal to reform the ASSU
special-fee system, was unquestion
ably democratic, the process which
spawned the amendment was largely
conducted behind closed doors.
To its credit, the Special Fee Task
Force held two open meetings, but
these forums attracted no more than
20 students total. Considering the
proposal's secretive formulation, it is
no surprise that students — offered
a drastic overhaul of the special-fee
system — shied away from approv
ing it.
Some ASSU senators are already
talking about a second try this year
at special-fee reform; that's fine, but
this time they should keep in mind
that any proposal put forward needs
the approval of two-thirds of the stu
dent body.
Realizing this, the senate should
work to ensure that students are

involved throughout the process of
formulating the reform. Such efforts
could range from conducting polls to
making till meetings on the issue
open to the public. The senate could
even try to set up and publicize an e
mail address to receive suggestions
directly from interested students.
Senators should also look into get
ting advice from economics and polit
ical science professors on how to
reform the current system. Stanford
is a diverse, rich and opinionated
community, and it is ridiculous not
to take advantage of all its members.
Students must also do their part if
the senate chooses to put forward a
new reform plan by attending meet
ings or seeking out senators about
the issues.
Only through this type of commu
nication with the student body can
senators guarantee that a special-fee
reform amendment will pass in the
general election.
