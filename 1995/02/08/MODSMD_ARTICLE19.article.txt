# Credit refund to bill
## 
### 
BY REJECTING OA-!, stu
dents displayed their distaste
for the methods it would have
employed in reforming the ASSU
special-fee system.
As ASSU senators solicit input
and begin to design another package
of reforms for the spring elections,
they should look beyond traditional
fixes like the outright elimination of
refunds.
One idea the senate should consid
er is a change in the way fee refunds
are paid. Instead of sending checks
directly to students, the ASSU could
return the money to the University,
which would credit the student's bill
for the following quarter.
This idea was proposed by stu
dents at the first of the Special Fee
Task Force's open meetings in fall
quarter, but it was not ultimately
incorporated into the Balanced
Funding Deal.
With this special fee reform, stu
dents who request refunds just for
the extra cash each quarter would be

less inclined to do so.
In fact, since a large number of
students' tuition bills are paid by
parents, the current refund system
often acts like a transfer of money
from parents to students rather than
as a true refund system. By refund
ing special fee groups, many students
in effect receive "free" money.
Because refunds would not be
eliminated, students could still direct
which groups would receive their
funds. In this way, the proposal
would retain the students' power to
object to a particular group's funding
while curbing the temptation to
solicit refunds by those with less
noble motives.
Departing seniors and graduate
students would provide the only
complication, but cutting checks for
them would surely be cheaper them
for the entire student body, as under
the current system.
This change — however simple —
may be the only reform the special
fee system needs.
