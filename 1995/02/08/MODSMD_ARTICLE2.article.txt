### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
Proponents of an Asian-American Studies pro
gram led a discussion on the issue in Okada House
yesterday — a month before the Faculty S f is
scheduled to hear recommendations from the Asian-
American and Chicano Studies committees.
The two committees — formed in the wake of last
spring's hunger strike and student protests — turned
in their reports to Dean of Humanities and Sciences
John Shoven for evaluation in January. Shoven will
present his conclusions to the Faculty Senate on Feb.
23.
In front of small audience of about nine, sopho
more Kris Hayashi and coterminal student Patty Tsai
— members of Concerned Students for Asian-Ameri
can Studies — led the program, discussing the history
and current opinions of students in favor of Asian-
American Studies.
The committee recommendations are "the closest
we've been from getting anything from the Universi
ty," Tsai said.
Last night's meeting was the first of its kind, tar
geted at Okada — the Asian-American theme dorm —
and the east side of Wilbur. In upcoming weeks,
Hayashi said the group will have programs in other
parts of campus.
The participants of the discussion expressed inter
est in either an Asian-American Studies program or
department. "[We need] to allow people to explore this
issue," said Okada Resident Fellow Derek Miyahara.
Okada Resident Assistant Jekit Lam concurred.
Although many students will not major in Asian-
American Studies alone, he said, a high percentage
have expressed interest in having such a program.
Out a department or pro
-1 here is a lack of continu
i in-American programs,

1 1its have been trying to
mplement the ethnic program

s come of it, Tsai said.
Even though the Asian
uerican community at Stan-
Cord has increased from 9 to 25
n-'.mt in the last 10 years,
hara said, there has not
mch change in Asian
unerican Studies.
"Student action comes and
i waves," said Tsai, who
