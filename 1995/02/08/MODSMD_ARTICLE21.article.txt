## MTV should get off the air 
### 
IN SIXTH GRADE, a friend of mine
made me buy the Dead Kennedys'
album "Frankenchrist" because it sup
posedly included a banned poster called
"Penis Landscape." Eager to see any piece
of art with the word "penis" in the title, I
shelled out the ten dollars to pay for that
groovy sheet of vinyl (remember vinyl,
folks?) and we scurried home to check out
my booty. Well, as it turned out, the poster
wasn't there, so my friend and I sat —
defeated and depressed — in the corner,
using our imaginations to decide just what
a penis landscape looked like.
It wasn't until a few weeks later that I
actually picked up the album and put it on
the turntable to listen to it. Ohmigod, that
was a good record. But, more to the point
at hand, it included a song called "MTV,
get ofT the air," which — if you haven't
heard it — is a righteously cool song that
accuses MTV of ruining the music industry
and whatnot. At the time, I really couldn't
relate to what the song was all about, but
now my eyes have been opened.
You watch MTV. I know that you do.
Yes, I admit that from time to time I watch
it too. I do heroin as well, but that doesn't
mean that I like it. Well, maybe I do like
heroin, but that's beside the point. What
I'm trying to get at here is that I really hate
MTV. I hate the music, "Unplugged,"
MTV Sports and all those really stupid car
toons that they have on at night. But, most
important, I hate ... nay, I detest, the
amount of power that MTV wields in our

lives. MTV has this annoying ability to tell
people what music they should listen to. It
creates the trends, the rock stars and, to an
extent, the environment in which we live.
But does anyone actually listen to the
music anymore? Personally, I think the
kiddies are just so enthralled by the hyp
notizing video techniques that they can't
differentiate between good and bad music
anymore. OK, boys and girls, here's your
first lesson. John Zorn is good. Sheryl
Crow is bad. You probably don't know
who John Zorn is. It's MTV's fault, you
know.
But maybe you like Sheryl Crow. Maybe
you dance to her song and say to yourself,
"Hey, I really do just want to have some
fun!" I've got a feeling that you're not the
only one. Here are the facts, straight and
simple: Sheryl Crow cannot write. Her
lyrics are the most asinine, meaningless
words that have ever penetrated my ears.
Unfortunately, simple lyrics seem to be the
style nowadays. Just look at that other
"crow" band, the Counting Crows. Here's
a sample of their lyrics:
Oh yeah, yeah, sha la la la la la la
Mr. Jones
I'm gonna be famous
'Cause gray is my favorite color
Mr. Jones.
Aren't you ashamed? You made these
guys famous.
Talent and originality is passe in the

music world, my friends. So while bands
like Tourettes and Indian Summer kick
much ass, yet have little chance of ever
being famous enough to hear their songs
being played at halflime in Maples Pavil
ion, people like Janet Jackson rake in mil
lions with simple-minded, one-word titled
songs like "1f..0r "You..
I have this theory, you see. It goes like
this: people don't care about the music or
the words anymore. All they care about are
the videos. They need the combination of
audio and visual stimuli to keep them
sedated. Without the colorful pictures to go
along with the music, kids wouldn't be able
to stomach any of that Smashing Melons
or Blind Pumpkin drivel that gets shoveled
in their direction. Do you think Weezer
would have made it if they hadn't figured
out how to put the "Fonz" in their video?
So, to sum up folks, a music video is to a
simple song as a Spider Man comic is to
"Moby Dick."
So piss off, John Sencio. Kennedy, get a
real job. And Tabitha Soren, go work for
"Hard Copy." Now if you'll excuse me, I'm
gonna go shoot up.
MTV, get off the air. Now.
