Intermission article on Winter One Acts raises concerns

THANK YOU for the article on Ram's
Head's "Original Winter One Acts"
in last week's Intermission. I was
happy to see the show displayed in such a
positive light. Your compliments of the
show give both the participants of "Origi
nal Winter One Acts" and Ram's Head as
a whole encouragement to continue our
work on campus.
Despite this positive attitude of the arti
cle, I would like to express some concerns
about the portrayal of certain aspects of
"One Acts" in the article. First, the article
seemed to place an enormous emphasis on
Fred Savage and Dan Pintauro, two of the
actors in "Waxing Poetic." The article, the
cover photograph and the teaser on the

front page all focused on these two actors.
While both Fred and Dan have added
much to this year's "One Acts," countless
other individuals have made equal efforts
to make this production possible. Thirty
one actors will readily verify that being a
television star is not a pre-requisite for
being in "One Acts"! The article seemed to
give Fred and Dan higher status in the
show because of their television experience
and lost track of the fact that they are
members of an entire ensemble which has
gone beyond the call of duty in making
"Original Winter One Acts" a reality.
In addition, a quotation from the direc
tor of "Solitaire?" — Michael Glass — was
used without its full context. When

Michael said "I fear that though I find
myself walking away from the experience
enriched with its challenges and successes,
that some others connected with the piece,
especially the cast, didn't go on much of a
personal journey in bringing life to 'Soli
taire?'," he was referring to fears that he
was occasionally having as a director.
These fears remained just that — fears;
they never became a reality. Michael Glass
never intended to imply that the cast was
not making the same journey and putting
the same emotional energy into "Soli
taire?" as he was; he merely indicated that
that was a fear he once had. He and I both
assure you that the cast of "Solitaire?" has
made the experience a very personal one,

in which all involved became truly
"enriched with its challenges and success
es."
These concerns do not in any way out
weigh the delight I had in reading your
article. I always find a pleasure in reading
The Daily's support of artistic groups on
campus, and I wish you well in your con
tinuation of supportive coverage of Stan
ford's performing arts groups. Thank you
again for the article, and I look forward to
seeing you at our spring production of
"Once on this island!"
