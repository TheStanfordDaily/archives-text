## Holy holes, Batman! Stanford researcher helps preserve the bats who live in Nevada's numerous abandoned mineshafts 
### Stacey Harp 
They are creepy blind creatures who live on
human blood, get tangled in women's hair and
transmit rabies and other deadly diseases to peo
ple.
These are only a few of the many myths about
bats. In reality, bats are elusive creatures. While
they do use a sophisticated form of sonar to com
municate and navigate, they are not blind and
generally avoid contact with humans.
There are more bats and more species of bats
than any other mammal on Earth. They are
known to be quite intelligent and even trainable.
Less than a third of one percent actually feed on
blood and all of these live in Latin America, feed
ing mainly on the blood of cattle. Over 70 percent
of bats eat insects and the remaining eat fruit or
the nectar of flowers.
But in the American West, bats have been fac
ing a little publicized yet serious problem. As
humans have disturbed and destroyed their natu
ral habitats through tourism and development,

bats have been forced out of caves to seek habitat
elsewhere.
They have found new roosts in abandoned
mines, particularly in Nevada, where there aro as
many as 300,000 of these neglected holes, 27,000
of which are officially classified as abandoned
mining sites.
Now, however, people want to close off the
abandoned shafts, which can be dangerous for
humans and animals. The most common method
now used to safeguard the old mines is to backfill
the site — fill the hole with dirt — or to seal the
entrance with cement. These processes, however,
kill the resident bats.
Late in 1993, Adina Merenlender, a postdoctor
al fellow at Stanford's Center for Conservation
Biology who is part of a statewide conservation
project in Nevada, became interested in the plight
of bats in that state.
Between the concern of bat biologists over the
22 bat species native to Nevada and the responsi
bility of mining companies to make their sites
safe, she saw an opportunity. "I thought, if our
project could get involved earlier, bringing people
together and starting to discuss things, that this
would be considered a more proactive and friendli
er strategy toward the other interests, which have
their points as well," Merenlender said.
Though they are disliked and feared by many,
bats play a very important role in the ecological
community. They are crucial for regulating insect
populations. Some of the insects they feed on are
crop pests which farmers want regulated. Other
bats who feed on the nectar of flowers play a role
in pollination of those flowers and the propaga
tion of a number of plant species.
It has recently been determined that up to two
thirds of the bat population in the United States
may be dependent on abandoned mines. Biologists
are concerned that with 300 to 3,000 bats in a sin
gle colony, backfilling and sealing mines may
result in the destruction of bats in large numbers.
So Merenlender, with the help of bat biologists
from the University of Nevada, organized a work
shop on the role of abandoned mines as habitat for
bats in Nevada. Among the attendees were 12 bat
biologists, and representatives from major mining
companies, the Bureau of Land Management and
the Bureau of Abandoned Mine Lands.
"First of all," Merenlender explained, "we did
education, bringing the 12 bat biologists in to
explain what bats are, why they are important and
what role they play."
The group continued by outlining possible
methods of securing inactive mining sites without
disturbing the inhabitants. One solution is to
build a "bat gate" across the entrance to the mine.
This gate is a heavy metal grating. The bars are
close enough together to prevent access to people

and animals, but far enough apart to allow the
bats to come and go freely.
In other states, like Colorado, this method has
proven extremely effective. Although the gates
cannot prevent the most determined vandals from
entering, they restrict access so that the sites are
disturbed less frequently by intruders. The bat
populations living in gated mines have in fact been
growing.
When a mine is determined too dangerous to
gate, a one-way net may be put over the entrance.
In this case, the bats can still leave the site, but
they cannot reenter and are forced to move else
where.
"That is still very disruptive," Merenlender
said, "but it's better than killing them all. ... It
has been shown with radio collars that they do
reestablish somewhere else."
The mining companies still had concerns, how
ever, about the implementation of these measures
at their sites, Merenlender said. More than the
extra time and money that might have to be spent
to accommodate bats, the mining companies were
worried about liability.
When a site is first scheduled for permanent
closure, a fence is put up while the decision is
made how best to seal the entrance. During this
time, which may be between a year and 18
months, the company needs to determine whether
there are bats living at the site, how many bats
might use the site and whether it might be used
for raising infant bats.
The companies were concerned that during this
period they would be liable for any injuries that

occurred at the site.
"What we tried to do in the workshop was to
work out how to relieve the companies of liability
in the state of Nevada," Merenlender stated.
"With the district attorney, we drafted some legis
lation that relieves them of responsibility during
the time period that the site is fenced."
Although the workshop is over, the work it ini
tiated continues. A geographic database has been
set up to show the location of the abandoned
mines in Nevada and an ongoing project deter
mines what kind of bats live at each site and how
large each colony is.
The goal of constructing this database, Meren
lender explained, "is to be to be more predictive.
What makes good a bat habitat? How can we pre
dict where we should be looking for them to short
en the amount of work? That requires data," she
said.
Modern technology has made this task easier.
Researchers use nighttime cameras equipped with
motion sensors to capture the bats on film. A spe
cial device called a "bat monitor" records bat
sonar. Each species of bat has a characteristic
"sonar signature" allowing the researchers to
determine species without seeing any of the ani
mals.
Ultimately, Merenlender hopes that research on
the bats at each site will lead to a system where
mine closures can be considered on a case by case
basis rather than having a global or statewide plan.
"I organized the conference," she said,
"because I thought this was really a chance for the
project I work for to make a difference."
