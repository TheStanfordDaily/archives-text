Q: "What's the fastest anyone's ever
skied?"

A: Well, before I tell you the answer,
I should let you know that, in addi
tion to a hefty health insurance
plan, you're going to need lots of technol
ogy to help you break the real speed lim
its on the slopes.
You see, the main thing slowing you
down, besides bunny-slopers and people
getting their poles stuck in the chairlift, is
air resistance. Friction between your skis
and the snow is actually fairly minimal.
And in fact, when you get going at top
speeds (above, say, 100 mph) your skis

can actually lift up and ride on a
thin layer of air an inch or two
above the ground.
To think about air resistance,
consider a Coke bottle dropped
out of an airplane. As it acceler
ates due to gravity, the air resis
tance pushes back on it. The
faster it goes, the more air resis
tance pushes. Eventually the air
resistance catches up to the
force of gravity, and the bottle
won't accelerate any more. It's
reached what's known as termi
nal velocity.
Terminal velocity isn't the
speed at which you burn up, or

your guts implode, as low budget science
fiction movies use the term. It's just the
maximum speed dictated by air resis
tance.
Around the surface of the earth, the
terminal velocity of a falling human (a
skydiver, hopefully) is around 180 mph.
However, as you go up in the atmosphere,
and the air gets thinner, the terminal
velocity increases.
In 1960, an adventurous soul in the
Air Force took advantage of this, and
jumped out of an air plane at 90,000 feet
(by choice, I assume.) Wearing a pressur
ized suit, he was able to reach over 550
mph — faster than the speed of sound. I
hope our tax dollars didn't pay to get him
into the Guinness Book of World Records.
Incidentally, did you know that Guin
ness stopped updating records for people
eating weird things? Back in the 70s,

there were these guys setting records by
eating whole bicycles, car engines, and so
on. Apparently, this encouraged novices
to attempt these gustatory feats without
adequate preparation, and they ended up
with more than a just a case of indiges
tion. (I guess you have to build up ...
start with Big Wheels and tricycles and
then build up to the Harleys.) So now
there's one less way to impress the Stan
ford admissions committee.
But back to records that are still up for
grabs. The moral of skydiving is that if
you want to ski fast, you need to get as
high as you can. So the big records are set
up over 10,000 feet, in places like the
Andes and Himalayas.
Trying to zip through the air at
10,000 feet, you have two major sources
of resistance. The first is known as form
drag, which is a result of turbulence. If

the air doesn't flow smoothly
around an object, the turbu
lence on the back side will cre
ate a region of lower pressure,
which pulls back on the object,
slowing it down. Thus, a
streamlined shape is generally
smooth and sufficiently
tapered to allow the airflow to
be continuous on the back side.
The second source, which is
nearly unavoidable, is known as
skin friction (it's not quite as
exciting as its suggestive name).
This generally isn't a factor
except at very high speeds,
when other factors have been

eliminated. It arises from air molecules
that stick to the surface of a moving
object. At high speeds, dragging these air
molecules along becomes such a burden
that over half the power of a high speed
airplane goes into overcoming skin fric
tion.
For a skier, form drag is overcome by
holding the body in the most aerodynam
ic position and wearing a smooth suit to
decrease turbulence. Skin drag can only
be lessened by making the suit out of a
substance to which air doesn't adhere
well.
So the fastest speed reached by a skier
is ... 124 mph, according to my records. I
hope this gives you something to aim for
on your next trip up to Tahoe.
