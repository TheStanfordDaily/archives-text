# Hybrid electric car wave of future
## 
### Jeremy Thibeaux 
A new breed of car may soon usurp
the gasoline-powered automobile.
The hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is
the subject of the Stanford Hybrid Auto
mobile Research Project (SHARP).
Researchers say it will be more efficient,
cleaner and may well outperform gaso
line engines as technology improves.
The most significant disadvantage of
the present-day automobile is, according
to Popular Science, that only "13 per
cent of the energy released by an inter
nal combustion engine ends up as a use
ful driving force." Another source of
energy loss comes during braking, when
all of the car's kinetic energy is lost on
the brake pads.
Electric vehicles are much more effi
cient than gasoline powered vehicles and
produce zero emissions, but battery
technology will not allow somebody to
travel more than 60 miles without effec
tively "running out of gas."
Hybrid electric vehicles offer a practi
cal compromise. They retain the range
of gasoline-powered vehicles by using a
gasoline-powered auxiliary power unit
(APU) to supplement the car's power
supply. This APU generates electricity
when the vehicle's battery is low on
charge, so instead of taking the car
home to recharge the battery, the
recharging can take place while on the
road.
While retaining the same size gas
tank, the range of hybrid electric vehi
cles extends beyond those of convention
al gasoline cars because the gasoline is
used more efficiently.
The Stanford hybrid project is part of
an effort by a number of universities to
explore the possibilities in the design of

these vehicles. The project has corporate
sponsors as well: Ford Motor Co. donat
ed an Escort station wagon which the
Stanford students converted.
SHARP'S electrified Escort has com
peted in the HEV Challenge since 1993.
Thi3 competition — held in June and
sponsored by the Department of Energy
and the Big Three auto makers (General
Motors, Ford and Chrysler) — pits the
HEV designs of 30 different universities
against each other.
But Shawn Sarbacker, one of
SHARP'S coordinators and a graduate
student in mechanical engineering, said,
"our biggest competition is ourselves.
Ours is the most technologically
advanced car . .. people try to do more
than they can possibly accomplish."
This ambition has led to accolades for
the design of Stanford's car, which has
won second place in the category each
year. But it has also resulted in
mediocre overall performance because of
mishaps due to attempting such a com
plex design, project members said.
"We were the only team that designed
their own motor," said Ernest Villanue
va, a senior majoring in mechanical
engineering and the program's other
coordinator.
Villanueva also pointed out the com
plexity of SHARP'S control system.
Where most of the entrants in the HEV
Challenge require the driver to manual
ly turn on the gasoline generator when
the battery power is low, "We wanted
the car to be driven just like any other
vehicle. . . . We wanted a monitor to be
able to turn on the APU automatically,"
he said.
SHARP'S control system runs on a
microprocessor control system also
developed in-house. When the battery

has only 20 percent of its charge, the
control system switches on the APU
automatically to extend the range of the
vehicle.
The APU runs at a steady number of
rpm to maximize the power output. The
current generator is set at 6000 rpm, but
team members said they hope to replace
the old 23-horsepower (hp) generator
with a new BMW motorcycle engine
which will put out 60 hp, at somewhere
between 2,000 and 3,000 rpm.
Regenerative braking is another tech
nology being implemented in HEVs.
Energy lost during braking is preserved
by turning the electric motor into a gen
erator. As a generator, it will give power
back to the batteries, while at the same
time providing a reverse torque on the
wheels to slow the car down.
When asked how the car actually per
formed, Sarbacker said, "The 0 to 60
design point for the SHARP car is 8.2
seconds. Right now acceleration is limit
ed due to manufacturing defects in the
drive motor. ... In cooperation with
FMC Corporation in Santa Clara, we are
bringing the drive motor to design per
formance level. When the manufactur
ing problems are corrected, the motor
will put out 75 hp and we expect it to
achieve an eight-second 0 to 60."
He also hastened to point out that 75
hp for electric vehicles is impressive
since "electric motors develop full
torque at 0 rpm."
The car gets about 40 mpg, a 50 per
cent improvement over the normal
Escort, and its top speed should be
around 80 mph.
Anyone is welcome to participate in
SHARP, members said.
"We encourage everybody to come
out. There are tons of opportunities to
find something you are interested in,"
Sarbacker said.
This year there are mainly under
graduates participating in the project,
which is a mixed blessing, Sarbacker
added. "There is a steeper learning
curve, but once they figure out what's
going on they are extremely dedicated to
the project. They offer continuity on the
project from year to year," he said.
"It is a great chance for a student to
get exposed to engineering in real world
situations," he added. "There is a lot of
work to be done on proving the technol
ogy as well as showing it can be pro
duced cost effectively."
The team works on a car for three
years, and this is the last year for the
Escort. But, Sarbacker said, "We are
writing a proposal to develop a new vehi
cle for next year which will probably be
another Ford or a Saturn."
