Sacramento State 4

Just when the Cardinal pitching staff' needed a
lift, it got one â€” from the most unlikely of sources.
Junior righthander Mario Iglesiaa earned his
first win in almost two years as the top-ranked
Stanford baseball team (4-2) came from behind to
beat Sacramento State (2-3) 7-4 yesterday after
noon at Sunken Diamond.
Iglesias, who relieved freshman hurler Kyle
Peterson, pitched the final four scoreless innings to
allow the Cardinal to-come back from a 4-3 sixth
inning deficit to pick up the victory over the Hor
nets.
"I felt really good out there," Iglesias said. "I
went out with an aggressive attitude. It's been a bit
frustrating because I haven't had much of an
opportunity to pitch lately and it felt good to get in
there."
Iglesias, who pitched just one-and-a-third
innings in all of 1994, had the Hornets guessing all
afternoon as he picked up his first victory since
April 27,1993. Iglesias inherited a no-out situation
with a man on second in the sixth inning with
Sacramento State holding a 4-3 advantage.
