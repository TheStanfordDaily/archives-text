## Hornets stung Iglesias lifts baseball, 7-4 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer

Sacramento State 4

Just when the Cardinal pitching staff' needed a
lift, it got one — from the most unlikely of sources.
Junior righthander Mario Iglesiaa earned his
first win in almost two years as the top-ranked
Stanford baseball team (4-2) came from behind to
beat Sacramento State (2-3) 7-4 yesterday after
noon at Sunken Diamond.
Iglesias, who relieved freshman hurler Kyle
Peterson, pitched the final four scoreless innings to
allow the Cardinal to-come back from a 4-3 sixth
inning deficit to pick up the victory over the Hor
nets.
"I felt really good out there," Iglesias said. "I
went out with an aggressive attitude. It's been a bit
frustrating because I haven't had much of an
opportunity to pitch lately and it felt good to get in
there."
Iglesias, who pitched just one-and-a-third
innings in all of 1994, had the Hornets guessing all
afternoon as he picked up his first victory since
April 27,1993. Iglesias inherited a no-out situation
with a man on second in the sixth inning with
Sacramento State holding a 4-3 advantage.

Hornets left fielder Jason
Moore attempted to lay down a
sacrifice bunt but Iglesias came
inside with a fastball, resulting in
a weak pop-up to first baseman
Steve Carver.
"I just tried to throw the ball
real hard and he popped it up,"
Iglesias said. "That was definitely
a big pitch for me and a big out
for our team."
The Cardinal, aided by a wild

Sacramento State pitching staff,
came back with a little offense of
its own in the bottom of the sixth
inning. Junior catcher A.J. Hinch
got things started with a walk
before center fielder Cale Carter
followed with an infield single.
Hornets pitcher Chris Shwarze
then threw four straight balls to
left fielder Troy Kent to load the
bases, bringing shortstop Eric
Sees to the plate.
Sees, a sophomore, worked the
count to 3-1 before being plunked
by Shwarze to tie the game at
four. Carter later came in to score
on a wild pitch, giving the Cardi
nal a 5-4 advantage that it would

never relinquish.
"I do whatever it takes for us
to win," Sees said. "Sometimes it
means drawing a walk or taking a
pitch, and sometimes it means
swinging away. As long as we
win, I don't care."
For the day, Sees finished at 1-
for-1 with a double, RBI, and two
runs scored, but his best plays of
the afternoon didn't even enter
the scorebook. Sees executed a
perfect sacrifice bunt in the sec
ond inning, allowing the Cardinal
to pick up an early run. He also
led off the fifth with a walk and
eventually scored to cut the Hor
net lead to 4-3. In the eighth,

Sees scored all the way from sec
ond base on a wild pitch.
"There were two outs and it
was deep in the count," Sees said
of his decision to try and score on
the wild throw from the Hornets'
Chris Caine. "The odds of a hit
weren't really good and I just
never slowed up around third."
In what is becoming a pre
dictable scenario, the Cardinal
once again got off to an early lead
on Tuesday before allowing the
opposition to climb back in the
game.
Freshman third baseman Joe
Kilburg got things started in the
Stanford half of the first when
his grounder up the middle car
omed off the second-base bag and
went for a single. Junior Steve
Carver followed with a stand-up
double to left-center to put the
Cardinal ahead 1-0. That lead
increased to 2-0 with the help of a
double by left fielder Troy Kent.
But, for the fifth game in a
row, Stanford could not hold the
lead. Peterson pitched well
through the first four innings,
striking out three Hornets while
allowing just three base hits, but
he tired in the fifth.
Sacramento State put three
runs on the board on five base
hits in that inning to transform a
2-1 Cardinal lead into a 4-2
deficit. Second baseman Arman
do Balderramos led the Hornet
attack, going 4-for-4 on the day to
increase his season on-base per
centage to an astronomical .800.
Even Balderramos, however,
could not faze Iglesias, who had
fate on his side.
"My girlfriend gave me a cross
that I wore every game I pitched
in the summer," said Iglesias,
who led the Kenai Peninsula Oil
ers of Alaska to a World Series
victory over the summer.
"I thought I'd lost the cross,
but it just turned up before the
game and I wore it on the
mound," he said. "I'm glad I
found it."
And so is the rest of the team.
