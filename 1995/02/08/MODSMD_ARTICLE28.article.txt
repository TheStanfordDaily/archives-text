# Swimming co-captains lead title quest
## Crowe and Thayer excel 
### Ezra Baylin Staff writer 
Seniors Becky Crowe and
Kendra Thayer quickly became
close friends — even before their
freshman-year classes began —
when they showed up to the first
day of pre-season swimming
practice. There they found that
the rest of their teammates had
met each other during the sum
mer as some of the youngest
members the U.S. National
Team had ever had.
"We were low-profile swim
mers our freshman year," Crowe
said. "Kendra and I sort of knew
each other, and the rest of our
class was already buddy-buddy
because they had been on the
national team trips together all
summer. It is really intimidating
to know that your classmates
have won at World Champi
onships, set American records,
and been to international compe
titions all before they started col
lege."
However, with three national
championship rings and a No. 1
ranking this season, co-captains
Crowe and Thayer are not intim
idated anymore. Crowe took sec
ond in the 200-yard butterfly at
the NCAA Championships last
year and is a four-time Ail-Amer
ican. Thayer, a seven-time All-
American, also took second in
the 400-meter individual medley
at the championship meet dur

ing her freshman and sophomore
years. Neither swimmer has ever
lost a dual meet while at Stan
ford.
Though they are strong indi
vidual performers, the extraordi
nary aspect of these two athletes
is their dedication to the team as
a whole. Clearly, their devotion
to teamwork and activities out
side of swimming prompted their
teammates to elect them co-cap
tains.
Both have been either honor
roll or scholar athletes every
quarter at Stanford, and their
teammates describe their cap
tains as natural leaders and the
most committed swimmers in
the pool. In a class with
Olympian Jenny Thompson and
three-time NCAA champion
diver Eileen Richetelli, Crowe
and Thayer show that compas
sion and hard work are just as
important as individual great
ness.
"No one cares more about
people than Becky," Thayer said.
"She has been captain for two
years because everyone on the
team knows that she truly cares
about them and what they are
doing."
Although Thayer has not been
to the Olympic games or set a
world record, she epitomizes the
Cardinal student-athlete. She
realizes that there is more to life
