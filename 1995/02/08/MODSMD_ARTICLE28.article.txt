# Swimming co-captains lead title quest
## Crowe and Thayer excel 
### Ezra Baylin Staff writer 
Seniors Becky Crowe and
Kendra Thayer quickly became
close friends — even before their
freshman-year classes began —
when they showed up to the first
day of pre-season swimming
practice. There they found that
the rest of their teammates had
met each other during the sum
mer as some of the youngest
members the U.S. National
Team had ever had.
"We were low-profile swim
mers our freshman year," Crowe
said. "Kendra and I sort of knew
each other, and the rest of our
class was already buddy-buddy
because they had been on the
national team trips together all
summer. It is really intimidating
to know that your classmates
have won at World Champi
onships, set American records,
and been to international compe
titions all before they started col
lege."
However, with three national
championship rings and a No. 1
ranking this season, co-captains
Crowe and Thayer are not intim
idated anymore. Crowe took sec
ond in the 200-yard butterfly at
the NCAA Championships last
year and is a four-time Ail-Amer
ican. Thayer, a seven-time All-
American, also took second in
the 400-meter individual medley
at the championship meet dur

ing her freshman and sophomore
years. Neither swimmer has ever
lost a dual meet while at Stan
ford.
Though they are strong indi
vidual performers, the extraordi
nary aspect of these two athletes
is their dedication to the team as
a whole. Clearly, their devotion
to teamwork and activities out
side of swimming prompted their
teammates to elect them co-cap
tains.
Both have been either honor
roll or scholar athletes every
quarter at Stanford, and their
teammates describe their cap
tains as natural leaders and the
most committed swimmers in
the pool. In a class with
Olympian Jenny Thompson and
three-time NCAA champion
diver Eileen Richetelli, Crowe
and Thayer show that compas
sion and hard work are just as
important as individual great
ness.
"No one cares more about
people than Becky," Thayer said.
"She has been captain for two
years because everyone on the
team knows that she truly cares
about them and what they are
doing."
Although Thayer has not been
to the Olympic games or set a
world record, she epitomizes the
Cardinal student-athlete. She
realizes that there is more to life

than swimming, that deGuerre
Pool is not the entire universe.
Thayer stresses that swim
ming was not the primary reason
she came to Stanford or the rea
son she stays. "My parents always
stressed academics and down
played swimming. I am an eco
nomics major with no Olympic
aspirations, so I am here first and
foremost to get an education."
Though they have had overall
success with swimming, both
have had to overcome serious
shoulder injuries, which demon
strates their inner fortitude.
Crowe's tendinitis in her shoul
der forced her to miss several

meets in her freshmen year, so
she was not a part of the team
that head coach Richard Quick
sent to the national champi
onship meet.
"Even though I made the cut
for nationals, Coach Quick had to
leave some of the freshmen home
from nationals [because of NCAA
regulations]," said Crowe. "It was
fair. It was the way it worked out,
but it is really hard to read about
how your team is doing at nation
als and still feel like you are part
of the team."
Thayer too suffered through
nagging shoulder problems, but
desire kept her going. "Over the
past three years, my shoulders
have gotten worse," Thayer said.
"They really kept me from doing
anything my junior year and it
was horrible. I had the worst per

formance of my Stanford career
at the championships last year,
but we worked through it this
summer and made some real
progress."
Though adversity struck
Crowe and Thayer at different
points in their careers, their
ability to bounce back is what
makes them remarkable. Crowe
came back strong in her sopho
more year, placing second in the
200-yard butterfly and swim
ming the butterfly leg of the
first-place 200-yard medley
relay. Thayer has also put past
problems behind her and looks
to take the NCAAs by storm,
returning to the success she had
her freshman and sophomore
campaigns, when she placed sec
ond in the 400-yard individual
medley.

Even with their Ail-American
performances and NCAA champi
onship swims, Thayer and Crowe
still recount a story about watch
ing their teammates swim at the
Olympic trials in 1992 as their
best memory of Stanford swim
ming.
"One thing that really stands
out is watching my teammates at
Olympic trials. I just remember
watching Jenny Thompson
break the world record in the
100-yard freestyle, and it was
amazing to think that I know her
and trained with her," Thayer
said. "Our whole entire team was
standing up and crying when
Pablo Morales and Thompson
made the team. Coaches, swim
mers, everyone was just over
come and it was an amazingly
powerful moment."
