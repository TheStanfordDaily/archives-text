# Schlukebir, Bleszynski duel at Rolex
## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
Stanford's top women's tennis players
returned with invaluable experience from their
rendezvous with the nation's top racket stars last
weekend at the Rolex Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships.
Sophomore All-American Katie Schlukebir (2-

It was a good experience
for me to play against the
top players in the country.'
— Ania Bleszynski

0) advanced to the quarterfinals, where she col
lided with UCLA's Keri Phebus and fell in a 6-3,
6-1 straight-set loss.
Freshman Ania Bleszynski, who received
entry into the tournament by winning the quali
fying tournament in her college debut, lost in the
first round to Anne Pastor of Texas, a top-16
seed. She then moved to the conso
lation bracket where she was elim
inated by Notre Dame's Wendy
Crabtree 1-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7-3).

"l was really fortunate that I
had the opportunity to go even
though I didn't play as well as I
would have liked to,'' Bleszynski
said. "It was a good experience for
me to play against the top players
in the country."
"It's both exciting and challeng
ing to watch her," said head coach

Frank Brennan. "She's young,
and because she does everything
well, she's got so much to work on.
She's going to be a great player."
Schlukebir, seeded in the
eighth slot in the bracket, disposed
of Texas's Cristina Moros by a
score of 6-2, 3-6, 6-1. Indiana's
Rachel Epstein became Schluke
bir's next victim in straight sets 6-
1, 6-2 in a match that mirrored
Schlukebir's most recent dual
match which she also dominated
against Fresno State.
"Everybody down there is good,
so any win is a good one," Brennan
said.
The quarterfinal match marked
the third clash of Schlukebir and
Phebus so far in the 1994-95 sea
son. Phebus took the last one as
well 6-4,6-1 on her way to a cham
pionship at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Women's Indoor Tennis
Tournament in Seattle.
Schlukebir took the first meet
ing between the two potential Ail-
American standouts down in Mis
sion Hills at the 1995 National
Collegiate Tennis Classic in the
final title round. Schlukebir, a
come-from-behind player, did just
that in recovering from an 0-6 first
set to seize the championship 0-6,
7-6 (7-4), 6-3.
Last weekend's match will
undoubtedly not be the last meet
ing for the two as Phebus could
match up with Schlukebir when
her Bruins come to town in early
April, or when the Cardinal take
their act on the road to Los Ange
les later that month.
"Hopefully, we'll get it tied up
the next time," Brennan said.
Stanford (2-0) resumes dual
match play tomorrow as the Uni

versity of the Pacific attempts to
dethrone the No. 3 Cardinal at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium. Bren
nan will look to rest Schlukebir
after a long two weeks of competi
tion,, at least in Wednesday's sin
gles rounds.
Her absence will leave room for
lesser experienced players to see
the court. In addition, if the lineup
from past meets holds, Cardinal
tennis fans may see Bleszynski
playing in her No. 1 singles slot.
The Cardinal's usual No. 4 singles
player, Sandra De Silva, will also
rest because she is still recovering
from a virus.
UOP brings more to the table
than Stanford's first two oppo
nents, LTNLV and Fresno State,
whom the Cardinal flushed out of
the Bay Area by winning all 18
matches. Pacific is currently
1-1 after dropping its first match
to Arizona State, 1-8. Pacific next
downed Washington, taking seven
of the competition's nine matches.
Playing in the top spot for
Pacific has been Tracee Lee, who
Stanford caught a glimpse of at
the Rolex Qualifying tournament.
Lee, seeded just ahead of Bleszyn
ski at No. 7, lost in the second
round of that tourney. The right
handed senior from Honolulu has
qualified for the NCAA Singles
Championships twice in her
career.
Bleszynski (2-0), who could
meet Lee tomorrow afternoon,
called her "a big hitter who looks
to take a lot of chances when she is
out there on the court."
"They're another match along
the way," Brennan said. "It'll be a
good, challenging match which is
what we are looking for."
