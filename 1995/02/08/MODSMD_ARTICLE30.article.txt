# Softball aims for 3-0, will face Bears
## 
### Jason Weintraub Contributing writer 
Athletes at Stanford are taught
many things, first among them to
harbor strong feelings regarding the
University of California. The Stan
ford softball team, in only its second
year as a varsity sport and its first in
the Pacific 10 Conference, begins its

rivalry against the Bears today with
a doubleheader at Berkeley.
The Cardinal comes into the
game brimming with confidence
after a 29-0 spanking of Menlo Col
lege. As a Division 111 school, how
ever, Menlo is unable to field a team
comparable to Pac-10 squads. Cal's
collection of players usually forms a
competitive team, playing at a level

just below that of national power
houses UCLA and Arizona.
"Cal's a top 20 team," said Stan
ford coach Sandy Pearce. "They're
4-0 this year, beating Santa Clara
and San Jose State twice each. They
have good pitching, and we'll have
to play really well to win."
Stanford will counter the Bears'
attack with its strength up the mid

die. Freshman pitcher Jessica
Schulman, coming off a shutout last
Saturday against Menlo, brings an
astonishing 0.48 ERA from high
school. Junior catcher Lynn Ander
son hit .300 for the Cardinal last
season while starting every game.
Sophomore Summer Lee, the Car-
dinal shortstop, led Stanford last
year with a .388 batting average and
began the 1995 campaign by going
6-for-6 with 6 RBIs in Saturday's

romp. At second base, sophomore
Amanda Renteria looks to build on
last year's .327 average.
"In the games they've played so
far, it looks as if teams have been
able to score on Cal," Pearce said.
"They've won a couple of games 6-5.
So we'll have a good shot against
them if we can hit [like we've been

hitting]." When Stanford is playing
well, the team plays good defense
and has a powerful offensive attack.
In the first game of the double
header, Schulman will again pitch
for the Cardinal. In the second
game, sophomore Angela Webb gets
the nod for Stanford. During last
year's inaugural season, Webb

picked up three of the Cardinal's
five victories while posting an ERA
of 2.99. With two strong pitchers
and a productive hitting game, the
Cardinal look to open up the 1995
Pac-10 schedule with a sweep of
those dirty Golden Bears.
At Stanford, we've been taught
to expect nothing less.
