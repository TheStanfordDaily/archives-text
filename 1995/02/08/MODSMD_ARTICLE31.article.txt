After a month of practice and a
few scrimmages, the Stanford
men's lacrosse team opened its sea
son last weekend with two big
games against UC-Davis and the
University of the Pacific. The squad
was anxious to get the official sea
son underway to get a feel for where
it stands.

On Saturday, the Cardinal trav
eled north to face UC-Davis.
Though only the first of six confer
ence games against Division I
North opponents, the players and
the coaches felt it was important.
"We're opening up against a Divi
sion I North team. This game will
set the tone for the season, and may
make or break our chance of get
ting into the playoffs," said first
year coach Dan Williams.
Davis, a team with strong
recruits, usually has a significant
size advantage over its oppo
nents. Poised and composed, the
Aggies represented a tough chal
lenge for the young Cardinal.
"Davis is traditionally a strong
team, particularly at the mid
field," Williams said. "We're
going to try to use our speed from
the midfield to counteract their
size."
Unfortunately, Stanford's
effort was just not enough as the
Cardinal Lost, 11-4. "They played
more composed than us on Satur
day. They have a well-controlled
offense that made us play defense

for most of the game," said fresh
man Ronald Rhea. "We're going
to take this as a learning experi
ence and try to come back
stronger in our next games."
Stanford learned in a hurry,
coming back the next day to
crush Pacific, 24-0 "This was a
game where our main goal was to
practice our team offense and
control the ball," Rhea said. Play
ing relentlessly on both the offen
sive and defensive end, Stanford
never gave Pacific a chance to
gain any control.
With two games already under
its belt, the squad should be ready
for its next games this weekend.
Traveling down to southern Cali
fornia, the team will face two
highly ranked teams on consecu
tive days, UC-Santa Barbara on
Saturday and Chapman College
on Sunday. These contests will
also be significant in determining
the Stanford's playoffs hopes.
