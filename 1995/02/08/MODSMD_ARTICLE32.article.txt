# Women begin '95 with thrashing of Broncos

The Stanford women's
lacrosse team began its first var
sity season in the same way Ger
many began World War II when
it defeated Santa Clara 17-1 on
the road on Saturday. The Cardi
nal's blitzkrieg attack dismantled
the Broncos much like Hitler's
Panzer divisions took apart the
Polish countryside.
"We had been working really
hard and it was exciting to be
playing in our first varsity game,"
said junior co-captain Peppie
Stephenson. "It was just too bad
that it came against such an poor
opponent."
Coach Kay Cowperthwait's
team dominated on both sides of

the field, registering a .580 shoot
ing percentage while holding
Santa Clara to a measly .143 on
one-for-seven shooting.
Freshmen shined as the Cardi
nal offense ran roughshod over
the Broncos. Carole Fahkry
scored a remarkable seven goals
while Dara Kaplan added three of
her own.
"I think Carole and Dara will
be a powerhouse on offense as the
season moves along," Stephenson
said..
Another freshman, Daria
Kramer, helped solidify the Stan
ford defense. Kramer, Stephen
son and junior Hannah Flatau
tracked down any Bronco foolish
enough to cross to the Stanford
side of the field.
"Good man-to-man defense in
the backfield right from the
moment they took the ball defi
nitely was the key," Flatau said.
"For the one goal they [the Bron
cos] got, they just ran in and shot
wildly."
The team managed to erase
last year's lackluster perfor
mance against this same Santa
Clara squad from its collective
memory.
"It was a good victory because
last year when we played them, it
was 4-3 at halftime and coach was
like, 'What the hell is going on?' "
Stephenson said. "This time we
played much better. We still need
to improve, but, overall, we were
happy with how we played."
The Cardinal becomes the
only varsity-level women's
lacrosse team on the West Coast.
While this means that Stanford
may be playing second fiddle to

the tougher East Coast teams it
will now be facing, it also means
that the program will be able to
get more competitive faster.
"We've got a lot more funding,
so we'll be able to play more Divi
sion I teams," Flatau said. "The
facilities we have are better. We
don't have to play on mud-ridden
fields anymore or share a field
with other teams."
More funding and better
treatment make playing lacrosse
at Stanford more attractive to
talented high school players. It
was in this way that the Cardinal
was able to lure athletes like
Fahkry, Kaplan and Kramer to
the Farm.
"We didn't have the ability to
recruit at all before," Flatau said.
"Now we do and we got some
really good frosh. We still don't
have the money to give scholar
ships yet, but hopefully we'll be
able to do that in the future."
