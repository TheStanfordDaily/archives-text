The Stanford women's
lacrosse team began its first var
sity season in the same way Ger
many began World War II when
it defeated Santa Clara 17-1 on
the road on Saturday. The Cardi
nal's blitzkrieg attack dismantled
the Broncos much like Hitler's
Panzer divisions took apart the
Polish countryside.
"We had been working really
hard and it was exciting to be
playing in our first varsity game,"
said junior co-captain Peppie
Stephenson. "It was just too bad
that it came against such an poor
opponent."
Coach Kay Cowperthwait's
team dominated on both sides of

the field, registering a .580 shoot
ing percentage while holding
Santa Clara to a measly .143 on
one-for-seven shooting.
Freshmen shined as the Cardi
nal offense ran roughshod over
the Broncos. Carole Fahkry
scored a remarkable seven goals
while Dara Kaplan added three of
her own.
"I think Carole and Dara will
be a powerhouse on offense as the
season moves along," Stephenson
said..
Another freshman, Daria
Kramer, helped solidify the Stan
ford defense. Kramer, Stephen
son and junior Hannah Flatau
tracked down any Bronco foolish
enough to cross to the Stanford
side of the field.
"Good man-to-man defense in
the backfield right from the
moment they took the ball defi
nitely was the key," Flatau said.
