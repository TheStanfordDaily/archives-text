Some quotes and quips for
your own edification, cour
tesy of me:

Mike Montgomery should
start thinking about recruiting
Lou Roe and Marcus Camby as

transfers. Sound outlandish? Not
really, when one considers that
the University of Massachusetts
Minutemen might have a higher
collective grade-point-average
than the Stanford Cardinal.
After an abysmal 0.8 GPA endan
gered the eligibility of just about
every Minuteman earlier this
year, the players discovered eru
dition, raising their GPA to a
miraculous 3.3. I guess UMass
head coach John Calipari got his
players hooked on phonics. Now
he's gotta figure out how to get
their No. 1 ranking back without


The Real
Deal
Joe
Bialowitz
interfering with the players' obvi
ously tight study schedules.
Tyrone Willingham might not
have landed the best recruiting class
in the country, but he did manage to
land the recruit with the best name
— Sharcus Steen, a 6-foot-1-inch,
240-pound linebacker from south
ern California.
Brevin Knight's original first
name is explained by the Stanford
men's basketball media guide as fol
lows: "How did he get the name
Brevin? His mother's name is
BREnda and his father's name is
MeIVIN."
Jonathan Stark, the former
Stanford men's tennis player who is
now ranked No. 9 in the world in
doubles, on the difference between
being in college and being on the pro
tennis circuit: "I don't drink as
much beer."
Bill Walsh was pushing his for

mer offensive coordinator at Stan
ford, Terry Shea, for Mike Shana
han's old job with the 49ers. Can
someone please give me five dollars
so that I can buy Walsh a clue?
Granted, anyone could have done a
fme job with the 49er offense, and
Shea did get somewhat shafted
when Walsh exited the Farm. But
you would have been crazy as hell to
think Carmen Policy would hire a
man who only possessed experience
coaching a pro-style offense that
couldn't win consistently at the col
lege level.
The Sixth Man Club
expressed disappointment last
Thursday over the fact that the
University of Oregon cheer leading
squad — the stars of last year's
Ducks game at Maples Pavilion —
did not make the trip down for this
year's match-up. The club's disap
pointment, however, dissipated
when the final seconds of the Stan
ford victory ticked off the clock and
the club stormed the court in a fit
of Dionysian revelry.
Cheryl Miller, who has never
learned that silence can be a virtue,

was whining after her USC
women's basketball team was wom
anhandled by Tarn VanDerveer's
Cardinal, 109-53. "I think the offici
ating hurt us tremendously," Miller
postulated.
Memo to Cheryl: First of all, at
least you didn't draw that brutal
men's referee who hikes his pants
up to his chest and calls phantom
fouls on Brevin Knight more often
than the dealer gets blackjack
when you have 20 showing. And
second, if a team beats you by 56
points, it doesn't matter if your
mother and your best friend are
reffing the game — no matter how
poor the officiating, you are still
going to lose, big-time. This is
known as the Law of 56. Those
who know will understand.
Digger Phelps, Notre Dame's
former men's basketball coach,
recently announced that he is mak
ing plans to run for the Presidency
in 2004.
"I'm going for it," Phelps said. "I
want to coach the country."
I'll take the time to listen to his
views so long as he refrains from

choosing Lou Holtz as his running
mate and painting Touchdown
Jesus on the side of the White
House (thus violating the Establish
ment Clause).
Jerry Rice and about a dozen
other players in the Super Bowl
seemed to be wearing Band-Aids on
their noses. I hope I was not the
only one out there who noticed this.
Mayor Frank Jordan of San
Francisco is trying to recruit private
corporations to foot the bill for the
$21-26 million renovation job need
ed for Candlestick Park. Herecentr
ly sent letters of solicitation to eight
rmyor companies which, he hopes,
could sponsor the project, including
Chevron, Charles Schwab and the
Gap. This prompted Earl Gustkey,
writing in the LA Times last week,
to quip:
"This opens the possibility that
Candlestick Park will lose its name.
Are you ready for Chevron Park?
Schwab Schtadium? The Big Gap?"

Watch for Joe's exclusive trip into
the mind of the Sixth Man Club in a
future edition of The Daily.

The women's lacrosse team entered its new varsity season by
chalking up a lopsided battle against Santa Clara, 17-1.
