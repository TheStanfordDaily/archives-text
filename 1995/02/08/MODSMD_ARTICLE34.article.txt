With triumphs in three of four events plus the all-around title,
freshman gymnast Keri Monahan led Stanford's assault in a
quadrangular home meet this Friday. Monahan matched the
Stanford record in the vault with a 9.800, and also topped the
balance beam (9.775) and the floor exercise (9.750). Her all
around total of 38.525 was a full 0.325 over her nearest competi
tor as the 7-3 squad outdistanced its competition by 9.25 points
overall.

Three years had passed since a Stanford player last garnered
Pac-10 Men's Basketball Player of the Week Honors. With 51
points, 18 assists and five steals, sophomore point guard Brevin
Knight paced the Cardinal to a key sweep over the Oregon
schools and became the first since Adam Keefe to take the prize.
Knight now stands among the conference leaders in scoring,
assists and steals as the Cardinal have jumped to No. 15 in the
country.
