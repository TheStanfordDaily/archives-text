Tyrone Willingham may not have Rose Bowl coaching experience,
but his defensive coordinator will.
Bill Harris, who guided the Michigan secondary for eight years and
wide receivers in 1986, was hired yesterday to fill one of the final three
vacancies on Willingham's staff. New defensive line and inside
linebackers coaches have yet to be hired.
In Harris' tenure with the Wolverines, his defensive backs were
ranked tops in the nation twice. Michigan reached a bowl game all nine
seasons, and took the Big Ten title on five occasions.
"In BUI Harris, I feel we have added a coach who is well respected
among his peers for what he has accomplished as an individual coach
and for what he has meant to the team concept at Michigan," Willing
ham said.
