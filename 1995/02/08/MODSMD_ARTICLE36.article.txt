# Elders to speak in April at Mem Aud
## 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
Former Surgeon General
Joycelyn Elders â€” who was
recently fired by the Clinton
Administration for her contro
versial and outspoken views
will speak in Memorial Auditori
um April 18, the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau announced yester
day.
Last night the ASSU Senate
allocated $11,875 to the Speak
ers Bureau to cover Elders'
costs. While she normally
charges $15,000, the Stanford
speech will be part of a Califor
nia tour, according to Speakers
Bureau Director Scott Moss.
"It's our biggest event for the
rest of the year," Moss said.
"We've been trying to track her
down since she left the Clinton
Administration."
Although her topic has not
been finalized, Moss said Elders
has recently discussed children's
health and health education
issues.
"We think she's controver
sial, and if you're talking about
children's health education and
children's health, she's it. She's

talking about things that no one
else would say.' Moss said.
Moss said the bureau does
not exclude possible speakers

because of
their contro
versial views.
Elders, for
example, has
advocated
legalizing
marij u a n a
and teaching
about mastur
bation in
schools.

"We don't judge the merits of
the issue," he said. "These are
issues that have a lot of support,
have a lot of opposition, and it's
good to hear them. Her views on
sex and drug education are on
the cutting edge. "
Previous speakers this year
have included political strate
gists John Sununu and James
Carville and feminist writer
Naomi Wolf.
Elders' speech will also
receive funding from Stanford
in-Government, Moss said.
"We like to spark debate on
campus. If we spark debate,
we've fulfilled our goal," he said.
