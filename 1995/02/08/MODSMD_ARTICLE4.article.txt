# ASSU downs fee-reform bill
## 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
The ASSU Senate last night struck down a bill in
tended to create a separate account for special-fee
surplus funds.
The bill — which would have prevented surplus
funds from being placed in a student organization's
reserve account — won a simple majority but failed
to garner the required two-thirds vote.
Currently, organizations requesting a special fee
can charge an additional 30 percent of their budget to
cover fee refunds. If the actual amount of refunded
money is less than the buffer, the difference is placed
into the group's reserve account. Organizations can
then use that money following senate approval.
Had the bill passed, organizations would not have
access to the surplus, and the money would have

been used the following fiscal year to reduce special
fee costs.
Graduate senator Sandeep Singhal said the bill's
goal was to "take the extra money and give it back to
the students in the form of lower special-fee bills the
following year.
"This prevents groups from receiving more
money than they ever asked for. There's no reason
why we should be receiving free gifts from the stu
dents," Singhal said.
Senate associate Alex Scherbakovsky agreed, say
ing the reform "would put students in control and
give them the choice of how much [ money] the group
received."
The chief outside opponent of the bill was ASSU
Speakers Bureau Director Scott Moss. He said that,
although his organization will
receive approximately a $7,000
surplus following fee refunds, the
Bureau has used the reserve
money to balance its budget"for
the first time in years."
The reserves are "not really
extra money," he said. "The
refund rates suggested aren't
usually overstated. Last year,
students took a big hit." The
Speakers Bureau, Moss said, has
lost $9,000 over the past two
years and had to withdraw
$23,000 from its reserves.
While some senators wanted
to postpone the bill until the

Feb. 21 senate meeting to allow
time for an ASSU financial
impact report, all agreed that
delaying the bill would prevent
student groups from altering
their budgets to allow for the
new changes. Prospective spe
cial fee applications are due Feb.
15.
"Why do we have to be forced
to make a rushed decision?"
asked undergraduate senator
Phillip Lin. "Without the num
bers, we're just voting on blind
fait h."
Lin, the chief senate opponent,
said that special-fee reform is
necessary, and another buffer
related bill may be presented to
the senate in the future.
"If we had the numbers, this
could potentially be a good

thing," he said. "It doesn't really
take into account that student
reserves have suffered."
With the creation of the new
Students' Alliance party, the 9-7
vote marks the first issue divided
along party lines.
In other action, the senate
unanimously voted to retain the
Stanford Design Group and the
Recreation Center as indefinite
business projects.
Legislation on changing poli
cies on friendly amendments —
amendments supported by the
bill's authors — was tabled until
the next meeting.
The senate also granted a
leave of absence to graduate sen
ator Julie Cantor, who is unable
to attend meetings during winter
quarter.
