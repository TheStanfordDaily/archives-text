# 5.5 percent jump in tuition OK'd
## Total annual cost reaches $26,749 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
The Board of Trustees yester
day approved a 5.5 percent in
crease in undergraduate tuition
for next year, slightly higher than
last year's tuition increase.
The increase will bring the tu
ition for the 1995-96 school year
to $19,695, up $1,026 from last
year's $18,669. Room and board
charges will go up 3.8 percent next
year, to $7,054.
"We felt that [the increase] was
reasonable," said Board Chair
John Freidenrich, "although we
are concerned about the escala
tion in costs."
The total charge for tuition,
room and board will be $26,749.
This total increase of 5.5 percent
comes from a 2-percent increase
plus the inflation rate, according
to Council of Presidents member
Mork Murdock. The COP met last
week with Provost Condoleezza
Rice to discuss their recommen
dation for next year's tuition.
The percentage increase in tu
ition is higher than last year's —

when charges increased by 5 per
cent — but still well under the 7.5-
percent and 9.5-percent increases
made in 1993 and 1992, respec
tively.
The board passed the adminis
tration's recommendation of a
5.5-percent increase after debate
by the trustees' academic policy
and finance committees, Freiden
rich said.
Despite adding almost $1,300
to the yearly price of attending
Stanford, Freidenrich said he be
lieves the increase will not keep
students from middle-income
families from getting a Stanford
education. Enough other re
sources are available that the cost
should be within reach, he said.
"We think with student aid ...
[tuition] will be at the same level
of affordability," he said. "We rec
ognize and understand that for
middle-class families these things
are difficult.... It is certainly of
great importance to us."
Keeping Stanford affordable
was a priority for the COP, Mur-


Andrew Martinez-Fonts — Daily
dock said. "Our main concern that
we raised (in discussion with the
administration) was whether peo
ple's needs would be met according
to financial aid calculations," he
said, adding that the University
"assured us they would [be metj."
University President Gerhard
Casper said in a statement, "Our
goal is to keep tuition increases as
low as possible consistent with pro
viding the best possible education."
He added, however, that "even
at this level, tuition covers only
about 60 percent of the actual cost
of that undergraduate education."
The University plans to provide
additional undergraduate financial
aid next year, totaling more than
$37 million. That figure is up from
the $32 million offered this year.
Stanford's tuition remains lower
than tuition at comparable univer
sities, Freidenrich said. Even with
the increase, he said, "we certainly
feel that we're competitive."

Also, at the board meeting Mon
day and Tuesday, 1995-96 tuition

was set for graduate students.
Tuition for general graduate
students is the same as for under
graduates, taking a 5.5-percent
jump to $19,695. Next year's
tuition at the School of Medicine is
$24,375, a 5.4-percent increase.
For the School of Engineering,
graduate tuition also increased 5.4
percent, to $21,045. The School of
Law marked a 5.4-percent increase
to $22,350. Trustees passed the
smallest increase this year for the
Graduate School of Business: 4.8
percent to $22,215.
In other board meeting busi
ness, trustees discussed the status
of the Stanford Fund — the Uni
versity's controversial new dona
tion policy — which Freidenrich
said is "making progress" at rais
ing money.
"Depending on where you are in
the year, it's hard to tell where
that will end up," he said. "I think
it's ahead of last year, and we hope
it will be significantly ahead by the
end of the fiscal year."
Trustees also informally dis
cussed the dinners they attended
Monday night at student resi
dences, Freidenrich said. About
half of the board members ate with
students at nine different campus
dining halls.
"There was a very enthusiastic
response by the trustees to those
dinners and the discussions with
the students," he added. "Every
one enjoyed it and thought it was
productive and useful."
