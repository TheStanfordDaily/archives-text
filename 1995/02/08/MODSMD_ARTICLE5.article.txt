# 5.5 percent jump in tuition OK'd
## Total annual cost reaches $26,749 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
The Board of Trustees yester
day approved a 5.5 percent in
crease in undergraduate tuition
for next year, slightly higher than
last year's tuition increase.
The increase will bring the tu
ition for the 1995-96 school year
to $19,695, up $1,026 from last
year's $18,669. Room and board
charges will go up 3.8 percent next
year, to $7,054.
"We felt that [the increase] was
reasonable," said Board Chair
John Freidenrich, "although we
are concerned about the escala
tion in costs."
The total charge for tuition,
room and board will be $26,749.
This total increase of 5.5 percent
comes from a 2-percent increase
plus the inflation rate, according
to Council of Presidents member
Mork Murdock. The COP met last
week with Provost Condoleezza
Rice to discuss their recommen
dation for next year's tuition.
The percentage increase in tu
ition is higher than last year's —

when charges increased by 5 per
cent — but still well under the 7.5-
percent and 9.5-percent increases
made in 1993 and 1992, respec
tively.
The board passed the adminis
tration's recommendation of a
5.5-percent increase after debate
by the trustees' academic policy
and finance committees, Freiden
rich said.
Despite adding almost $1,300
to the yearly price of attending
Stanford, Freidenrich said he be
lieves the increase will not keep
students from middle-income
families from getting a Stanford
education. Enough other re
sources are available that the cost
should be within reach, he said.
"We think with student aid ...
[tuition] will be at the same level
of affordability," he said. "We rec
ognize and understand that for
middle-class families these things
are difficult.... It is certainly of
great importance to us."
Keeping Stanford affordable
was a priority for the COP, Mur-
