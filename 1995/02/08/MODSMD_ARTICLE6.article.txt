# Challenging intellectual horizons together
## Middlebrook, Djerassi combine expertise in marital, creative and academic arenas 
### Kyung Lee Contributing writer 
They are both considered giants in their
respective fields, but together, they are
learning to achieve even more.
Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi, father of
the birth-control pill, and English Prof.
Diane Middlebrook, author of a national
best-selling biography, are married. To
gether, as Middlebrook puts it, they form
"a great collaboration."
Although both have already reached
amazing heights, they said they believe the
"horizon is always changing," adding that
their marriage has only helped to expand
their intellectual pursuits. For example,
Djerassi said Middlebrook influenced his
decision to begin writing at the age of 62.
"If it hadn't been for my wife, I would
never have written "The Pill, Pygmy
Chimps, and Degas' Horse" because auto
biographies are too introspective for me,"
Djerassi said.

"I wanted to lead a different intellectu
al life. I wanted to be an intellectual polyg
amist, not a bigamist," Djerassi added.
"Fiction writing couldn't be more differ
ent from science."
Two of Djerassi's novels, "The Bourba
ki Gambit" and "Cantor's Dilemma,"
delve into the complex world of the scien
tist.
Middlebrook shines equally as an au
thor. Her latest book, "Anne Sexton, A Bi
ography," was a finalist for the National
Book Award in 1992. In addition, Middle
brook served as associate dean of under
graduate education from 1979 to 1981 and
as chair of Stanford's Feminist Studies
program from 1985 to 1988.
Djerassi said he hopes his writing will
educate those who are curious about the
scientific world but are scientifically illit
erate.

portray the scientific world are
the scientists. But most scientists'
only priority is gaining recogni
tion by other scientists," Djerassi
said. "I have a missionary feeling.
I want to use fiction as a means to
teach people — although I don't
want to be didactic about it."
The couple said they do not fol
low a fixed intellectual or career
path. "I don't have a life philosophy
because people are always growing
and expanding," Djerassi said.
"Anyway, it's corny to have a motto.
It's idiotic and self-promoting."
Djerassi added that this atti

tude might be the reason both he
and Middlebrook are exploring
each other's respective fields.
"I'm making things up, which is
something that I haven't done as
a scientist. And she's being a sci
entist with her information accu
mulation and verification,"
Djerassi said, referring to Middle
brook's work as a biographer.
But Middlebrook disagreed with
her husband. "I wouldn't say that
being a historian Ls like being a sci
entist. Although it may be true for
scientists also, historians are more
involved in finding information
that is already present," she replied.
As an author, Middlebrook
turned "Anne Sexton, a Biogra
phy" into a bestseller, even
though, she said, a poet's biogra

phy is more "respected than
read." However, the book also
sparked much controversy.
"The biography became the
center of controversy concerning
the ethics of disclosure and the
profession of psychology because I
used Sexton's therapeutic tapes,"
Middlebrook said. She added that,
although the action was hotly
debated, her use of the tapes
helped the book's success.
Besides writing, the couple
shares a deep interest in art.
Djerassi founded the Djerassi Res
ident Artists Program, an inter
disciplinary arts center in the
Santa Cruz mountains. Middle
brook is one of the founding
trustees of the program.
"We decided that we'd help the

living artists by commissioning
them and providing them a place
to work," Middlebrook said.
"You can do nothing for dead
artists," Djerassi added.
Djerassi also owns approxi
mately 100 works by Paul Klee,
his favorite painter, and promised
his collection to the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art in 1988.
Both professors, who live
together in London part-time,
said that although they pursue
their individual writing with zeal,
they make time to spend together.
"In London, we're totally
together," Djerassi said. "My wife
goes in her study to write for six or
seven hours, and I go into mine.
But in the evening, we always go
out, like to the theater."
