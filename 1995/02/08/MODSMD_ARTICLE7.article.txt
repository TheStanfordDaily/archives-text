# Tresidder Advisory Board discusses union's mission
## 
### Meghna Chakrabarti 
In a meeting to set their structure
and mission, Tresidder Advisory Board
members differed yesterday over a pro
posal which would decrease the num
ber of student representatives on the
board.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson
outlined a proposal to have the board

led by incoming interim Dean of Stu
dents Jim Larimore and a student vice
chair. Additionally, Jackson's plan
calls for trimming the number of stu
dent representatives from five down to
two, according to ASSU Council of
Presidents member Anietie Ekanem, a
board member.
"There is major contention with
[the proposed decrease in student rep

resentatives]," Ekanem said. "The
draft we presented Dean Jackson with
called for four students and one COP
member. . . . Two students is not
enough to accurately voice our needs."
Echoing Ekanem's concerns, board
co-chair Kevin Barenblat, a sopho
more, said, "I was kind of disappointed.
Stanford students should be able to
have some kind of input about their

concerns."
Board members will send Jackson e
mail with their comments on his pro
posal.
Created earlier this year, the adviso
ry board was established to oversee the
operation of Tresidder and serve as a
forum in which student concerns could
be addressed.
