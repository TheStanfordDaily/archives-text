# Tresidder Advisory Board discusses union's mission
## 
### Meghna Chakrabarti 
In a meeting to set their structure
and mission, Tresidder Advisory Board
members differed yesterday over a pro
posal which would decrease the num
ber of student representatives on the
board.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson
outlined a proposal to have the board

led by incoming interim Dean of Stu
dents Jim Larimore and a student vice
chair. Additionally, Jackson's plan
calls for trimming the number of stu
dent representatives from five down to
two, according to ASSU Council of
Presidents member Anietie Ekanem, a
board member.
"There is major contention with
[the proposed decrease in student rep

resentatives]," Ekanem said. "The
draft we presented Dean Jackson with
called for four students and one COP
member. . . . Two students is not
enough to accurately voice our needs."
Echoing Ekanem's concerns, board
co-chair Kevin Barenblat, a sopho
more, said, "I was kind of disappointed.
Stanford students should be able to
have some kind of input about their

concerns."
Board members will send Jackson e
mail with their comments on his pro
posal.
Created earlier this year, the adviso
ry board was established to oversee the
operation of Tresidder and serve as a
forum in which student concerns could
be addressed.
Board members also looked at
Tresidder's role at Stanford, with
Tresidder Asst. Director Jeanette
Smith-Laws presenting the issue
of balancing the demand for
meeting space between student
groups and outside clients in
Tresidder.
A large increase in demand for
meeting rooms by both outside
corporations for interviews and
student groups for meetings —
1,000 reservations were made in
January — has created a conflict of
interest, according to Smith-Laws.
Board members discussed
whether to give priority to compa
nies who pay to use rooms in
Tresidder — which in turn benefits
student services — over the stu
dent groups for which some mem
bers argued the union was created.
In order to reduce the demand
on Tresidder rooms, "the COP
will be looking fit ft space-pl&nmng
report on meeting places on cam
pus," Ekanem said. "Our goal is
to open up those spaces on a regu

lar basis."
David Longbine, manager of
the Stanford Shopping Center,
also presented a report at the
meeting. The Shopping Center is
overseen by the Stanford Manage
ment Company.
Longbine outlined tentative
plans for changes to the student
union. The Stanford Federal
Credit Union branch office —
which was slated to move into
Tresidder earlier this quarter —
will be delayed until next year,
and plans for opening a Taco Bell
have also been pushed back.
"There is a commitment to
bring fast-food establishments to
Tresidder," Ekanem said. In
order to get an accurate feel for
which services to bring to Tresid
der, Stanford Management Com
pany plans to put out a market
survey to all students in spring
quarter.
Ekanem stated that he would
like to see more definite action
taken by the time the advisoiy
board meets again in April. "I hope
to see a concrete statement made
on the expansion of businesses in
Tresidder, [businesses that] help
students in particular," he said.
