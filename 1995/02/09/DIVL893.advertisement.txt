HOW TO HANG ON TO YOUR DOUGH.
(WITHOUT CRAM PING YOUR STYLE)
Separate "needs" from "wants."
Hint: A bed is a need. A Mr. Microphone
is a want.
£3 Split the bill but only pay your share.
Why put in for someone else's swordfish
if all you got was soup?
Set aside money for emergencies.
Unless you'd rather call your parents
for it instead.
Jh Keep your eye on your wallet.
Have a Citibank Classic card in case you
lose it. The Lost Wallet Service can get you
emergency cash, a new card, usually within
24 hours, and help replacing vital documents.
Based on available cash line
WE'RE LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.
