# Former Panther defends group's past
## 
### Rosalind Wang Staff writer 
Former Chief of Staff for the
Black Panthers movement
David Hilliard challenged stu
dents to "do something for
humanity" in a speech last night
in Ricker Dining Hall.
Speaking to an audience of
about 80, the previous
spokesman for the 1960s black
revolutionary group pointed to
the community service work of
the Panthers as a model for
activism. His time with the
Marxist-Leninist group is
recorded in his autobiography,
"This Side of Glory," written
with Lewis Cole.
"We were truly a service-to
the-people organization,"
Hilliard said. "What Bill and
Hillary Clinton are trying to do
we were doing 30 years ago. We
had feed-the-children programs,
escorts for senior citizens coming
back from the bank so they
wouldn't get mugged, and most
productively, free health clinics."
Hilliard criticized the press
and the government for promot
ing a distorted view of the Black
Panthers by overlooking the
group's community assistance
programs and instead focusing
on its arms policy.
"People never realized that
we were a political organiza
tion," he said. "What they saw
were the guns. We weren't 'mili
tants,' we were revolutionaries.
The guns were only for self
defense. We weren't about guns
— we were about jobs, educa
tion, health care."
As an example of media dis
tortion, Hilliard played a video
showing his 1969 appearance on
the TV show "Face The Nation,"
in which the interviewers
repeatedly asked questions
about the Panthers' willingness
to use violence and act hostile

toward police.
The show was filmed immedi
ately following Hilliard's indict
ment for his notorious speech in
Golden Gate Park, in which he
declared that the group was will
ing to kill anyone "who'll stand
in the way of our freedom,
including the President of the
United States."
"I wanted that speech to be
relevant to our problems," he
said, adding, "I got a little car
ried away."
The perception of the Pan
thers as "gangsters and thugs"
was a "concoction of J. Edgar
Hoover, to justify his wiping us
out," Hilliard said. He attested
to the legitimacy of the group by
noting that they had an embassy

in Algeria and several informa
tion centers around the world.
Hilliard proceeded to read the
10 Points of the Black Panthers,
the group's goals for social
change. The points, which
included calls for jobs, decent
housing and education for "black
and oppressed communities,"
were written by Huey Newton,
the founder of the Black Pan
thers.
"Huey's party was about
these points," he said. "All the
violence, all the shooting . . . his
party was not about that."
Calling Newt Gingrich's plan
the "Contract on America,"
Hilliard gave a pessimistic look
on the current state of the gov
ernment.

"I believe this government is
more fascist now than it was in
1966," he said, mentioning the
highly-publicized orphanage
plan for children of welfare
mothers, "three strikes" crime
legislation and health care
reform. "Old politicians are just
trying to preserve those pay
checks," he said.
Hilliard ended with a call for
youth activism.
"I don't have answers for you
in 1995," he said. "You must cre
ate your own world. . . . When
we didn't have health care, we
went to all the young doctors in
Stanford and asked them to vol
unteer some time on the week
ends. We got free medical ser
vice. We made it work."
