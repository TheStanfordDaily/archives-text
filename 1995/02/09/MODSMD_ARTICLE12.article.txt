## Rutgers students decry remarks 
### 
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP)
â€” More than 700 Rutgers Universi
ty students rallied Wednesday to
demand the school president's res
ignation, refusing to accept his apol
ogy for a remark about race and test
scores.
A day after a sit-in at center
court stopped a basketball game, a
mixture of minority and white stu
dents gathered at the state universi
ty's main campus to listen to speak
ers and shout slogans such as "All
power to the students."
"If you're putting a basketball in
a hoop you are OK with this univer
sity," said one speaker, senior Rod
ney Jackson. "If you are a person of
color doing anything besides that
you have no respect at this universi
ty."
The cause of the protest was uni
versity President Francis
Lawrence's remark to faculty mem
bers last fall that "disadvantaged"
students do not have "that genetic
hereditary background to have a
higher average" in standardized
tests.

Lawrence has repeatedly said his
remark was a mistake and not what
he meant, but some students and
faculty insist he must resign to end
a racial crisis at the state's flagship
university.
"They've made their statements,
and now no further disruptions will
be appropriate," Lawrence said of
the protesters. Asked if campus
police would do anything to prevent
further demonstrations, he said
only: "I'm not going to theorize on
it."
University officials have said
Lawrence's record shows a commit
ment to diversity and to minority
recruitment and hiring.
About 32 percent of the state
university's 47,700 students are
minorities; just under 10 percent
are black.
Tuesday night's basketball sit-in
began just before the second half of
a game against No. 4-ranked Mas
sachusetts.
Student Jacqueline Williams
walked to midcourt and sat down.
Guards went out to talk to her, but

she remained and more than 150
students, most of them black, soon
joined her.
Some in the mostly white sellout
crowd of 8,526 shouted "Get off the
court"and "We want hoops," but
the game was suspended 24 min
utes later. There were no arrests.
In campus interviews Wednes
day, white and black students dif
fered on the seriousness of the con
troversy.
"I think it's absolutely ridicu
lous. The whole thing has been
blown completely out of propor
tion," said white freshman Sean
Kenney. He defended Lawrence's
record, saying he "seems to be the
kind of person who is the exact
opposite of what eveiybody seems to
think he is."
Black sophomore April Johnson
said the basketball sit-in was worth
while.
"It got them the recognition that
they wanted," she said. Lawrence
"as a university president should
not make an unfounded remark like
that.... I don't accept his apology."
