BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Their U.S. buy
ing power already shrunk by weak currencies,
Canadians and Mexicans may have a new rea
son to stay home: A new border tax proposed
by President Clinton.
The tax, proposed to help the government
keep out more illegal aliens, would also keep
out many others too, critics said yesterday.
U.S. retailers, sports teams and other bor
der businesses say the fees — $3 for cars and
$1.50 for pedestrians entering the United
States — would chase away foreign customers
and spoil the goodwill of the North American
Free Trade Agreement.
"It does send a message that we're not wel
coming the Canadian customers the way we
used to," said Mary Kamien, spokeswoman
for Benderson Development Co., which runs
plazas in Niagara Falls, N.Y., where many
Canadians shop.
James Phillips of the Can-Am Border
Trade Alliance, a business group, said the fees
would undercut U.S.-Canadian trade, which
totals $211 billion a year.

Canada views the proposal as downright
unneighborly, and said it might retaliate with
fees of its own.
Canada's U.S. ambassador, Raymond
Chretien, was in Maine yesterday talking over
the fee proposal with Gov. Angus King, who
opposes the tax because it might inhibit busi
ness with neighboring Quebec and New
Brunswick.
Hockey and football teams such as the Buf
falo Sabres and Bills and the Detroit Red
Wings and Lions pack in thousands of Cana
dian fans, who already are paying ticket, park
ing and border-toll costs that can total $50 a
head.
"To pay three dollars at the border, that's
just more money for fans to come up with,"
said Lions spokesman Dan Arthur. "It might
discourage some from coming over."
Canadians made about 50 million car trips
to the LJnited States last year, according to
Statistics Canada, a government agency.
That's down 50 percent from 1991, when
they made about 75 million car trips south.
