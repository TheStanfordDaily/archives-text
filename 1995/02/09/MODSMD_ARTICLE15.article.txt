Simpson trial
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Prosecutors in
the O.J. Simpson case yesterday tried
to fix the time of the murders by way of
a "Mary Tyler Moore Show" rerun and
the howls of an agitated dog found
wandering the neighborhood with
blood on its paws.
The dog, identified as Nicole Brown
Simpson's Akita, ultimately led a
neighbor to Ms. Simpson's body,
sprawled in the entryway to her condo.
Sukru Boztepe testified that he took
the dog for a w<ilk to calm it down, and
recalled how the animal was "getting
more nervous and it was pulling me
harder."
Just after midnight, he said, the dog
stopped at Ms. Simpson's home and
looked down the dark walkway. Bozte
pe's eyes followed.

"I saw a lady laying down, full of
blood," Boztepe told the jury. "She was
blond. I could see her arm."
Boztepe said he and his wife, who
was with him that night, called police.
They didn't see the body of Ronald
Goldman.
With no known witnesses to the
slayings and a coroner unable to fix the
times of death, prosecutors are seeking
to convince jurors that the barking of
Ms. Simpson's Akita, named Kato, can
establish within minutes when she and
Goldman were slashed to death the
night of June 12.
Arafat orders arrests
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Yasser
Arafat, under pressure from Israel to
crack down on militants, ordered the
arrest of another 90 Palestinians in

raids throughout the Gaza Strip yes
terday.
Arafat, who meets Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Thursday in
an effort to bolster faltering peace
talks, also established a special court to
try Palestinians charged with security
crimes, including attacks on Israelis.
Last week, Rabin complained to
Arafat that even though Palestinian
militants have been detained previous
ly, none were ever charged with attack
ing Israelis.
The moves aimed to satisfy Israeli
concerns over Arafat's readiness to
reign in Palestinian militants whose
attacks against Israelis have caused
delays extending the Palestinian
autonomy to the West Bank outside
Jericho.
Fifty-five Israelis have been killed
by radical Palestinians since October.
