Study-at-home program
could block equal access
and discourage maturity

LAST WEEK, the Universi
ty's Commission on Tech
nology in Teaching and
Learning unveiled an unusual
early admissions program which
would allow students to apply to
Stanford in their junior year of
high school. Accepted students
would take Stanford courses in
math, English and physics via
electronic mail. According to com
mission member Patrick Suppes,
a professor emeritus of philoso
phy, the program is designed for
students who have "exhausted all
of the academic possibilities in
high school."
While the commission and the
University should be commended
for their willingness to look at
educational alternatives, this
idea, as currently designed, is
flawed.
First of all, the program is not
blind to a student's financial posi
tion since, according to Assoc.
Dean of Research Patricia
Devaney, the student would be
responsible for supplying the nec
essary computer equipment. This
requirement would create a situa
tion where only students who are
wealthy enough to afford the nec
essary equipment will be able to
participate in the program.
Devaney did note that the high
school could supply the equip
ment. Realistically, however, only
some schools — such as private
institutions or ones located in
wealthy areas — would be able to
undertake this program while
dealing with basic budgetary
needs.
The problem is that such a pro
gram, while beneficial to a few
high school students, might fur
ther widen the admissions gap
between wealthier students and

their less-affluent counterparts.
With richer applicants already
holding several admissions advan
tages (for example, SAT review
courses and college counselors)
Stanford should focus on what it
can to mitigate the disparity, not
widen it.
Ironically, the same commission
has also announced plans to create
a computerized coursework pro
gram for Native American high
school students, a project which
would deliver course options to
areas where such resources have
not been readily available. If the
cost is not too high, this laudable
spirit should be applied to the new
early admissions program. Surely
one of the computer giants in the
area would happily lend its name
and a few pieces of equipment to
the new program in the name of
equal access.
The second concern with the
program falls on a less tangible
level. A student's senior year of
high school is perhaps the last
time in a young person's life
where stress and worry will not
come in daily doses. Indeed, it is a
time for reflection and relaxation;
with college applications pending,
students are afforded the chance
to work on social skills that will
probably be more useful to them
later than getting ahead in college
calculus or physics.
Stanford should realize that
there are opportunities in high
school outside academics that can
be "exhausted." The early admis
sion program could disrupt this
traditional time of personal
growth by essentially removing
students from their normal envi
ronment and forcing them to deal
with college-level work.
Reforms and alternatives are
needed for the proposed admis
sions program. This plan is not
fatally flawed by any measure, but
Stanford should implement it in
such a way that will insure open
access to all students — while not
robbing them of all aspects of the
senior year experience.
