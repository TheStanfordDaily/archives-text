## A 						few tips on internships 
### 
IT'S THAT TIME again. Only a few
months left until June. And that
should trigger a response. Some
thing along the lines of, "What the hell
am I going to do this summer?"
What else?
You'll be exploring your myriad
career options so you can finally decide
if you're going to be a Supreme Court
Justice, a neurosurgeon or the next
Oprah. Decisions, decisions.
Honing the enhancing-the-r6sume
skills. Building the network. Making
that Stanford degree work for you.
So . . . you're going to be an intern.
If you're lucky, you'll land in a
great-sounding place like the Senate or
Microsoft or Universal Pictures. And
that's a coup because hundreds of us
apply for like three spots. And if you
get the dream job, that's more proof
that Mom and the admissions commit
tee were right. You're unique.
Or just lucky.
But before you get too excited, hold
on. And if you don't get that perfect
internship — like your roommate
who's trotting off to LA to work on
Steven Spielberg's latest film — don't
be too worried.
It's all a facade.
There's a dark little secret about
many of these gems. Most of you, if not
all, who grab a coveted position for free
labor will have a common cerebral
experience. A mind-numbing one, that
is.
Xeroxing.
Photocopying and photostatting,
dittoing and duplicating, mimeograph
ing and making copies. Different
words, same job. Xeroxing by any other

name is just as tedious.
And inevitable.
But it isn't always a breeze. The
machines vary from job to job and you
have to adjust quickly. Older models
are depressingly slow, chugging along
laboriously. With these puppies, each
page must be placed individually on the
glass. That's swell when you have a
200-plus page document.
The modern studs have enhancers,
enlargers, shrinkers and that auto-sta
ple/auto-collate-super-quick-for-when-
you-had-to-have-it-yesterday button.
It gets overwhelming.
You've got to get to know your copi
er inside and out — its problems, its
indicator lights, its quirks. You're the
therapist handling paper-jam break
downs. After a few weeks you'll find
yourself talking it through while say
ing "it's okay — everybody uses three
hole-punch when they need plain
sometimes."
And you beat people out for this
position.
It's not that Xeroxing is such a ter
rible thing. It's just the internship
phenomenon. Your superiors — and
that's everyone — see you as the pro
prietor of their very own mini-Kinko's.
You get personal calls transferred to
the copy room. After a while, friends
dial direct.
Say good-bye to those fantasies
about making presentations to the
chief of staff.
And it's funny, in a way, because in
the intern subculture — most notably
in D.C. — no one talks about it. Very
hush hush. It's not taboo, really, but
it's just pretty lame to say, "Uh huh,

I'm in the White House. I make
copies."
A more typical conversation in the
Stanford-in-Washington house goes
like this (with translation):
How's the summer going? (Are you
bored yet?)
It's amazing! (Yeah, but I'm just
glad there aren't any finals.)
So, what are you up to? (Is your job
better than mine?)
Well, nothing too big. I'm just in the
West Wing working on major economic
policy and assisting in the Presidential
briefing sessions. (I'm making copies.)
Really? I pass right by that Metro
stop. I'm over in the Pentagon in the
espionage division; I was so glad when
they gave me top-security clearance!
(I'm making copies, too.)
Cool. I hope to see you around
before I head off on Clinton's next trip
with the whole presidential entourage.
(I get to make copies on the Air Force
One portable Xerox machine. They
liked the one of my butt.)
Wow. (Guess you one-upped me.)
See ya. (Sucker.)
So if you're pounding the proverbial
pavement in June while you think that
the roommate is having more fun,
don't be too disheartened.
There's no glamour.
Just copying.
