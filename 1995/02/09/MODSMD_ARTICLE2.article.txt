# Minority engineers get grant
## 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
The School of Engineering's ef
forts to recruit minority graduate
students in mechanical and electri
cal engineering have received a
$690,590 boost from the Alfred P.
Sloan Foundation.
"There is a tremendous resource
out there in minority students who

can contribute to our field," said
Joseph Goodman, chair of the Elec
trical Engineering Department. "I
think it's important for Stanford to
do its part to help those students
move into the workplace."
The Sloan grant, coupled with ap
proximately $734,000 in University
funds, will go toward establishing 10
new Ph.D. fellowships and 20 re
search assistant positions for minor

ity graduate students over the next
five academic years.
The funds will aiso be applied to
ward recruitment expenses to at
tract students from other universi
ties, as well as to fund minority un
dergraduate summer research
grants.
Goodman said he attributes the
award to the School of Engineer
ing's laudable minority recruit
ment history.
"We have been successful in
attracting minority students," he
said. "Every qualified minority
applicant is offered full financial
support."
"We're trying to double minor
ity Ph.D. candidates in mechani
cal and electrical engineering,"
said Noe Lozano, associate dean
for minority affairs.
The research opportunities
funded by the grant will enable
minority master's students to
compete for admission to Stan
ford's doctoral programs and to
find research jobs, Lozano said.
Another goal of the program is
to "create an environment of sup
port" among graduate students,
Lozano said. "The graduate Ph.D.
program has its peaks and val
leys," he said, adding that he
hopes to establish a "sale haven"

in which students can discuss
"tough issues" in graduate stu
dent life and exchange ideas.
Lozano said he believes that
Stanford's long-standing tradi
tion of faculty commitment
helped it to win the award. "We
have first-rate faculty committed
to social change and students who
mirror that commitment," he
said.
He also attributed the school's
receipt of the Sloan grant to its
strong mentor program. "We
have about 30 faculty members
who have mentored minority stu
dents — chairing dissertations
and serving as key advisors,"
Lozano said.
In the future, Lozano said he
hopes equity will get embedded
into the nation's institutions so
that "separate but equal" pro
grams are no longer essential.
"It's a catch-22. We don't want
the services to be around forever,
but we need them in the present if
we want consistent progress," he
said. "We want to get to a point
where intervention is no longer
necessary."
