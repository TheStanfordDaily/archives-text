## Basketball prepares for critical set with Arizonas Women coming off rare Pac-10 defeat 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
Maybe losses are not so bad after all.
The last time the Stanford women's basketball
team fell to Oregon State was in the 1991-1992
season, when the Beavers beat the Cardinal 75-69.
Stanford bounced back from that loss, its second
of the season, by winning the Pacific 10 Confer
ence title with a 15-3 record. The Cardinal was
eventually crowned NCAA champion, defeating
the then-No. 1 Virginia Cavaliers in the semifinals
and Western Kentucky in the championship game

'We need to play with more inten
sity on defense [and] take care of
the ball better.'

to take home the title.
This year's edition of the Stanford basketball
team is ranked sixth and also has two losses after
falling to the Beavers last weekend. The Cardinal
(17-2 overall, 8-1 in the Pac-10) still holds the No.
1 spot in the conference, one game ahead of the
Washington Huskies. Half of the Pac-10 schedule
remains, and while the loss serves as a reminder
that anything can happen, Stanford looks to
redouble its efforts and surge forward into the
tournament, starting tonight against the Wildcats
of Arizona.
"It's not that we were awful in one thing but we
were not good enough in everything," coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "We need to play with more
intensity on defense, take care of the ball better
and shoot free throws better."
In the game against Oregon State on Saturday,
foul problems plagued the Cardinal. Senior center
Anita Kaplan, seemingly the only Stanford player
to score during the second half of the game, picked
up her fifth foul with over four and a half minutes
to go in the contest. After playing in foul trouble
for most of the game, sophomore swingman Kate
Starbird soon followed.
Freshman Kristin Folkl, who recently has been
a consistent source of minutes and points, was
unable to make the trip north due to a twisted
ankle she suffered during practice. While her
absence hurt — Folkl often substitutes for Star
bird — VanDerveer said she does not believe that
Folkl's injury was a major factor in the loss.
