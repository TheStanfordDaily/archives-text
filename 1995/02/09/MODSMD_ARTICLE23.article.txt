## Basketball prepares for critical set with Arizonas Women coming off rare Pac-10 defeat 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
Maybe losses are not so bad after all.
The last time the Stanford women's basketball
team fell to Oregon State was in the 1991-1992
season, when the Beavers beat the Cardinal 75-69.
Stanford bounced back from that loss, its second
of the season, by winning the Pacific 10 Confer
ence title with a 15-3 record. The Cardinal was
eventually crowned NCAA champion, defeating
the then-No. 1 Virginia Cavaliers in the semifinals
and Western Kentucky in the championship game

'We need to play with more inten
sity on defense [and] take care of
the ball better.'
— Tara VanDerveer

to take home the title.
This year's edition of the Stanford basketball
team is ranked sixth and also has two losses after
falling to the Beavers last weekend. The Cardinal
(17-2 overall, 8-1 in the Pac-10) still holds the No.
1 spot in the conference, one game ahead of the
Washington Huskies. Half of the Pac-10 schedule
remains, and while the loss serves as a reminder
that anything can happen, Stanford looks to
redouble its efforts and surge forward into the
tournament, starting tonight against the Wildcats
of Arizona.
"It's not that we were awful in one thing but we
were not good enough in everything," coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "We need to play with more
intensity on defense, take care of the ball better
and shoot free throws better."
In the game against Oregon State on Saturday,
foul problems plagued the Cardinal. Senior center
Anita Kaplan, seemingly the only Stanford player
to score during the second half of the game, picked
up her fifth foul with over four and a half minutes
to go in the contest. After playing in foul trouble
for most of the game, sophomore swingman Kate
Starbird soon followed.
Freshman Kristin Folkl, who recently has been
a consistent source of minutes and points, was
unable to make the trip north due to a twisted
ankle she suffered during practice. While her
absence hurt — Folkl often substitutes for Star
bird — VanDerveer said she does not believe that
Folkl's injury was a major factor in the loss.

Junior forward Darren Allaway goes up strong in the Cardinal's last
meeting with Arizona.
"We missed Kristin," Van-
Derveer said. "She's a real good
outside shooter and she would
have helped us. [However,} we
are capable of winning without
her, or any other player. We
had them down 10, 14 and we
didn't put them away."
The young age of the Stan
ford squad could be one reason.
While the three seniors and
lone junior play a key role for
the Cardinal, the bulk of the
depth, which has worn out
opposing teams, consists of
freshmen and sophomores.
These players were called on to
replace Kaplan and Starbird
when the duo fouled out.
Another reason could be the
crowd.
Twice this season, Stanford
has played on the road in front
of a vocal crowd. The first time
was in Knoxville, against the
Tennessee Volunteers; the sec
ond was last weekend, when a
record crowd of 4,892 — the
largest ever for a Beaver
women's basketball game —
showed up to enjoy the upset.
"The crowd was a factor,"
VanDerveer said. "It wasn't
like the crowd was cheering
against us but cheering for the
home team. Whenever it
seemed like we would put Ore
gon State away, Oregon State
would score and the crowd
would get back into the game.
"You expect tougher games
on the road and we're disap
pointed that we didn't play bet
ter."
Do not expect major changes
for tonight's game. While Ari
zona has played well as of late
— it presented a challenge in
most of its last game against
Washington before falling —
fine tuning of the Cardinal is all
that appears necessary.
"We're going to run some
new plays," VanDerveer said.
"We are going to work harder
and try to get better. We're get
ting into the important part of
the season and we're definitely
improving."
