# Men seek to avenge heartbreak

The temperature is hot. The air is dry.
Stanford's men's head basketball coach
Mike Montgomery has never won a game
there. And to top it all off, their leader is a
worshipped cult hero whose name just so
happens to begin with an "S." No, it's not
Dante's Funland, but the University of
Arizona might as well be Hell for the 15th
ranked Cardinal (15-3 overall, 6-3 in the
Pacific 10 Conference), who face the No. 9
Wildcats (17-4, 7-2 Pac-10) tonight in the
first part of a devilishly difficult road trip
down, way down, in the fiery pits of Ari
zona.
At the halfway point of the Pac-10 sea
son, the Cardinal is sitting pretty, tied for
third place in a very contentious race.
Stanford will get a chance to move up
when they play first-place Arizona. That,
though, will be easier said than done.
"The league is still very, very bunched
up," Montgomery said. "At some point,
there's got to be some separation, we just
have to make sure that we're separating in
the right direction."
Stanford has not won at the McKale
Center in a decade and have failed to beat
the Wildcats the last 14 times the two
teams have played. A main reason for that
in recent years has been a man named
Stoudamire, who might as well be the
Prince of Darkness for fans of Cardinal
hoops.
Wildcat point guard Damon Stoudamire
has logged 86 points in the last three
games against Stanford, including a 45-
point outburst earlier this season at
Maples Pavilion. Of course, don't say that
the Cardinal didn't have its share of
chances in that heartbreaking 89-83 over
time loss to Arizona. Who can forget Stan
ford guard Dion Cross' clean look at the
basket as time ran out and center Bart
Lammersen's missed put back at. t.hp
buzzer? But that's in the past — tonight
lies in the future.
Whether past, present or future, Stan
ford still must deal with Stoudamire, the
Ail-American who leads the Pac-10 in both
assists (7.6) and points (21.8) per game.
Stanford point guard Brevin Knight, who
was named Pac-10 Player of the Week for
his masterful exploits in leading the Cardi
nal to a sweep of the two Oregon schools
last week, must live up to his billing and do
something, anything, to cool Stoudamire

down.
"With Arizona, the concern is with
Stoudamire first and foremost just based
on the fact that he went off against us last
time," Montgomery said. "We've never
had anyone score 45 points against us.
We've got to do a better job.
"Stoudamire's a very good player, and
you're not going to take him out. You just
hope that the percentage of his shots will
be less."
Knight's backcourt mate, Cross, led the
Cardinal with 25 points in the last meeting
between the two teams and will also need
to step in with a strong showing. In the
last game against Oregon State, the junior
made just one of seven three-pointers in a
sub-par performance. A reason for that
may be the separated shoulder he re
injured, but the sharpshooter says that

'Stoudamire's a very
good player... we've got
to do a better job.'
— Mike Montgomery

won't be a factor.
"The shoulder's not going to affect me,"
Cross said.
But how can the Cardinal affect
Stoudamire's game?
"We're going to switch players on and
off him and try to keep someone fresh on
him," Cross said. "We're also going to try
to keep the ball out of his hands as much
as possible and try to wear him down."
Stanford will also try a few more differ
ent tactics this time around against the
wily Wildcat.
"Obviously, when a guy gets 45 you
have to try something different," said
senior swingman David Harbour, one of
Stanford's premier defensive stoppers. "I
think what we're going to do is try to force
him to the left because he always shoots
his three's going right. Also, when they
run the isolation with him, we're going to
run another guard at him. We're going to
have to make the other players beat us."
Harbour had better be careful what he
wishes for, because Arizona is capable of
beating Stanford with its other players.

Blair give Arizona a formidable combina-
