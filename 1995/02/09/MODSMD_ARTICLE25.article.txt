Here's hoping I get one of those
adorable Shaquille 0 'Neal Valen
tine cards next Tuesday. . ..
Turnaround: Amidst the
usual list of Stanford sports
victories last weekend was
one which was extra pleasant to
read about. The Cardinal softball

squad, which has taken its lumps
over the past few seasons, opened
its 1995 campaign by crushing
Menlo College 29-0 Saturday.
Stanford upped its record to 2-0
with a 7-0 forfeit victory in the
second half of the twinbill because
Menlo had no one left to pitch.
Crossing the line: Remember
the pamphlet of "Jewish Sports
Greats" in the movie "Airplane!"?
Well in major professional sports,
a listing of "Asian-American
Sports Greats" wouldn't fill the
front side of a business card. But
following in Japanese-American
Kristi Yamaguchi's skates, the
start of the NHL season marks
the debut of Anaheim Mighty
Ducks rookie center Paul Kariya,
a Japanese-Canadian. Often com
pared to hockey legend Wayne
Gretzky, Kariya's Ducks were vic
torious over the L.A. Kings in the
first meeting between the Great
One and the Next One.
Strawberry fields for
(never)?: With the suspension
and release of Giants outfielder

Darryl Strawberry, who reported
ly tested positive for cocaine on
consecutive days last month, a
question comes to my mind. How
many chances should these pro
athletes get with substance abuse
policies? Strawberry's career, sec
ond to his health, of course, is cer
tainly in jeopardy, but I would
wager that he'll be back. I just
don't understand how Steve
Howe, who has been suspended
seven times for substance abuse,
is pitching in the major leagues
and making over a million dollars
a year. Some team will pick up the
Strawman, but he's likely to stir
up more trouble.
The Home Stretch: As the
Pacific 10 Conference basketball
season makes the turn into the
second half of the schedule, both
the Cardinal men and women face
crucial tests. The men, ranked No.
15, can solidify their position to get
an NCAA bid when they meet No.
9 Arizona in Tucson tonight and
No. 14 Arizona State Saturday in
Tempe. The Wildcats are tied with
UCLA for the top spot in the Pac
-10 while the Cardinal and the Sun
Devils share third place. Many
people think the Pac-10 will send
either four or five teams to the
NCAA tournament. The women,
ranked No. 6 after being upset by
Oregon State last week, will look
to protect its one-game lead over
No. 12 Washington in the confer
ence title race, facing the Arizona
schools at home this week.
Blue Be-devileds: While
Arkansas' men's basketball team
is finding that it is hard to be the
defending NCAA champions, its
opponent in the 1994 final, Duke,
is finding it hard to look at the
Atlantic Coast Conference stand
