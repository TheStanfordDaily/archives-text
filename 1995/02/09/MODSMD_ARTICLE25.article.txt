Here's hoping I get one of those
adorable Shaquille 0 'Neal Valen
tine cards next Tuesday. . ..
Turnaround: Amidst the
usual list of Stanford sports
victories last weekend was
one which was extra pleasant to
read about. The Cardinal softball

squad, which has taken its lumps
over the past few seasons, opened
its 1995 campaign by crushing
Menlo College 29-0 Saturday.
Stanford upped its record to 2-0
with a 7-0 forfeit victory in the
second half of the twinbill because
Menlo had no one left to pitch.
Crossing the line: Remember
the pamphlet of "Jewish Sports
Greats" in the movie "Airplane!"?
Well in major professional sports,
a listing of "Asian-American
Sports Greats" wouldn't fill the
front side of a business card. But
following in Japanese-American
Kristi Yamaguchi's skates, the
start of the NHL season marks
the debut of Anaheim Mighty
Ducks rookie center Paul Kariya,
a Japanese-Canadian. Often com
pared to hockey legend Wayne
Gretzky, Kariya's Ducks were vic
torious over the L.A. Kings in the
first meeting between the Great
One and the Next One.
Strawberry fields for
(never)?: With the suspension
and release of Giants outfielder

Darryl Strawberry, who reported
ly tested positive for cocaine on
consecutive days last month, a
question comes to my mind. How
many chances should these pro
athletes get with substance abuse
policies? Strawberry's career, sec
ond to his health, of course, is cer
tainly in jeopardy, but I would
wager that he'll be back. I just
don't understand how Steve
Howe, who has been suspended
seven times for substance abuse,
is pitching in the major leagues
and making over a million dollars
a year. Some team will pick up the
Strawman, but he's likely to stir
up more trouble.
The Home Stretch: As the
Pacific 10 Conference basketball
season makes the turn into the
second half of the schedule, both
the Cardinal men and women face
crucial tests. The men, ranked No.
15, can solidify their position to get
an NCAA bid when they meet No.
9 Arizona in Tucson tonight and
No. 14 Arizona State Saturday in
Tempe. The Wildcats are tied with
UCLA for the top spot in the Pac
-10 while the Cardinal and the Sun
Devils share third place. Many
people think the Pac-10 will send
either four or five teams to the
NCAA tournament. The women,
ranked No. 6 after being upset by
Oregon State last week, will look
to protect its one-game lead over
No. 12 Washington in the confer
ence title race, facing the Arizona
schools at home this week.
Blue Be-devileds: While
Arkansas' men's basketball team
is finding that it is hard to be the
defending NCAA champions, its
opponent in the 1994 final, Duke,
is finding it hard to look at the
Atlantic Coast Conference stand


Kyle
Utsumi
ings. The Blue Devils' 51-44 loss
to Clemson Saturday dropped
them to 10-11 overall and 0-9 in
the ACC. Not quite NCAA-type
credentials. But remember,
Duke can earn an automatic bid
to the Big Dance if they can pull
off a victory at the ACC Tourna
ment. Don't count the Blue Dev
ils out quite yet. Feel
ing Blue II: It doesn't seem
that long ago that I watched the

Fab Five challenge Duke in the
1992 NCAA championship
game. But with the exodus of
those stars to the NBA, the
Wolverines are in a transitional
period, suffering its worst loss
of the season Saturday, 80-58 at
the hands of Minnesota. The
weirdest thing about the change
of fortunes for the two schools is
looking for Michigan or Duke
results in the paper and having
to get out the magnifying glass
to find them among the
unranked.
Job Hunt?: With no settle
ment in sight and spring train
ing just one week away, Presi

dent Clinton decided to make
the Major League Baseball
strike a big issue in Washing
ton. If Clinton leaves office in a
couple of years, there just may
still be a vacant seat he can fill
at the desk of the Commissioner
of Major League Baseball.
Maybe he's looking out for his
future.
Line of the Week: The hon
ors go to Los Angeles Laker
Kurt Rambis. Yes, Kurt Rambis.
In Saturday's 121-118 Laker
win over the hapless L.A. Clip
pers, Rambo played 28 minutes,
scoring nine points and adding
five rebounds and five assists.

And you thought Showtime was
over.
O.J.'s Record Cleared: No,
there were no criminal charges
dropped against O.J. Simpson.
It was Indianapolis Colts' rookie
running back Marshall Faulk
who cleared Simpson's name out
of the Pro Bowl record book by
rushing for 180 yards to break a
22-year-old record. Faulk car
ried 13 times and scored on a 49-
yard fake punt. In case you
missed it, the game was a
blowout. In what has to be the
most ridiculous attempt at an
all-star game, the AFC won, 41-
13. Big whoop.

In Saturday's 121-118 Laker
win over the hapless L.A. Clip
pers, Rambo played 28 minutes,
scoring nine points and adding
five rebounds and five assists.

And you thought Showtime was
over.
O.J.'s Record Cleared: No,
there were no criminal charges
dropped against O.J. Simpson.
It was Indianapolis Colts' rookie
running back Marshall Faulk
who cleared Simpson's name out
of the Pro Bowl record book by
rushing for 180 yards to break a
22-year-old record. Faulk car
ried 13 times and scored on a 49-
yard fake punt. In case you
missed it, the game was a
blowout. In what has to be the
most ridiculous attempt at an
all-star game, the AFC won, 41-
13. Big whoop.
