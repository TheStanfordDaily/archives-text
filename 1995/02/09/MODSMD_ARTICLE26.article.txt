# Elementary victory for men's netters
## Spartans destroyed

Stanford 7
San Jose State 0

The No. 1 Stanford men's tennis team
improved its record to 3-0 yesterday, easily
beating a weak San Jose State team 7-0 in the
completion of a rain-shortened match from
Tuesday.
The matches ended so quickly that Stanford
head coach Dick Gould ordered his players to
play additional sets against each other immedi
ately following the real matches.
"To put things in perspective, San Jose State
was about as good as my high school team —
which was pretty darn good, but nevertheless
was a high school team," said Stanford's win
ner at the No. 5 position, junior Ricky Becker.
Becker attended Roslyn High School in New
York.
Gould was less harsh regarding the Cardi
nal's opponent, saying that "there is no ques
tion that San Jose State is down this year." The
Spartans have been particularly hard-hit by the
loss to graduation of top-10 collegian Brandon
Coupe, who gave fits to Stanford players in pre
vious years.
San Jose State's new No. 1 player, Alan
Alvistur, was no match for junior Jeff Salzen
stein, falling 6-2,6-1. Salzenstein was playing in
his first match since losing 6-1, 6-1 to the
world's 74th-ranked player, Jonathan Stark, in
the Sybase Open on Monday. Showing some
signs of discouragement from that loss, Salzen
stein was hard on himself at several times dur
ing yesterday's match.
"SalzensteL t played well, there's no doubt
about it," Alvistur said, "but he got upset at lit

tie things, probably because he was motivated
after his loss at the Sybase Open."
Gould said he noticed that Salzenstein "got
down on himself' and "wasn't moving well or
serving well." However, Gould emphasized that

he was "happy with the way Jeff competed" in
the face of those setbacks.

their normal No. 2 player, fresh
man Scott Humphries. Humphries
was resting after seeing first-round
action last Monday in the Sybase
Open. He and doubles partner Paul
Goldstein had also won the Rolex
Intercollegiate Indoor Double
Championships last Sunday, cap
ping four days of mostly three-set
matches against the nation's top
doubles teams.
With Humphries putting the fin
ishing touches on a freshman
English assignment, Goldstein
filled in at the No. 2 spot to defeat
Marvin Crampton, 6-1, 6-4.
Playing at No. 3, Jim Thomas
was taken to a first-set tie-break by
the powerful forehand of Ryan Sell
schop, but still prevailed 7-6 (7-4),
6-1. Thomas said he "had trouble
getting into a rhythm" during the
match. However, Thomas was
saved by a powerful serve that Sell
schop found difficult to return. At
one point in the first set, one
Thomas serve knocked SelLschop's
cap right off his head.
Grant Elliott was merciless in
the No. 4 position, defeating Mar
cus Bateley in a 6-0, 6-0 shutout, a
score rarely seen at the college level.

Becker was similarly omnipo
tent, clinching the dual match by
sending Howard Robertson back
down Highway 101 with a 6-1, 6-0
loss to ponder.
Making his first singles start of
1995 in a dual match, freshman
Mis ha Palecek from Menlo Park
defeated Steve Riley in the No. 6
match, 6-2, 6-4. Palecek's match
was one of two cut short by rain on
Tuesday (the other match was
Elliott's), but he picked up where he
left off by playing a mostly error
free game that enabled him to capi
talize on his opponent's mistakes.
Doubles action supplied the only
close match of the meet. Becker and
Thomas filled in at No. 1 doubles for
Humphries and Goldstein, and beat
the duo of Alvistur and Crampton
in a pro-set tie-break, 9-8 (7-3). The
evenly played match saw no breaks
of serve for either team, and a well
played tie-break by Becker and
Thomas.
"The first 16 games were really
flat," Becker said. "We had two
break points and they had none, but
we played a really good tie-breaker
to close it out."
Stanford's No. 2 tandem of
Salzenstein and Elliott defeated
Riley and Orion Weihe, 8-2. Fresh
men Palecek and Charles Hoeveler
made successful dual match debuts
in doubles by beating Sellschop and
Bateley, 8-4.
