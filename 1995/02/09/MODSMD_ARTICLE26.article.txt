# Elementary victory for men's netters
## Spartans destroyed 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
Stanford 7
San Jose State 0

The No. 1 Stanford men's tennis team
improved its record to 3-0 yesterday, easily
beating a weak San Jose State team 7-0 in the
completion of a rain-shortened match from
Tuesday.
The matches ended so quickly that Stanford
head coach Dick Gould ordered his players to
play additional sets against each other immedi
ately following the real matches.
"To put things in perspective, San Jose State
was about as good as my high school team —
which was pretty darn good, but nevertheless
was a high school team," said Stanford's win
ner at the No. 5 position, junior Ricky Becker.
Becker attended Roslyn High School in New
York.
Gould was less harsh regarding the Cardi
nal's opponent, saying that "there is no ques
tion that San Jose State is down this year." The
Spartans have been particularly hard-hit by the
loss to graduation of top-10 collegian Brandon
Coupe, who gave fits to Stanford players in pre
vious years.
San Jose State's new No. 1 player, Alan
Alvistur, was no match for junior Jeff Salzen
stein, falling 6-2,6-1. Salzenstein was playing in
his first match since losing 6-1, 6-1 to the
world's 74th-ranked player, Jonathan Stark, in
the Sybase Open on Monday. Showing some
signs of discouragement from that loss, Salzen
stein was hard on himself at several times dur
ing yesterday's match.
"SalzensteL t played well, there's no doubt
about it," Alvistur said, "but he got upset at lit

tie things, probably because he was motivated
after his loss at the Sybase Open."
Gould said he noticed that Salzenstein "got
down on himself' and "wasn't moving well or
serving well." However, Gould emphasized that

he was "happy with the way Jeff competed" in
the face of those setbacks.
