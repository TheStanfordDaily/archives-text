# Women swimmers await Cal
## 
### Ezra Baylin Contributing writer 
Three national championships, three
Pacific 10 Conference crowns, 23 dual

meet wins and no losses in the last three
years. Seniors on the top-ranked Cardinal
women'B swimming team have never
faced defeat in their tenure at Stanford,
and the meet at California this weekend

gives senior greats like Jenny Thompson
and Eileen Richetelli a chance to finish up
their dual meet careers without a loss.
The Cardinal travel up the Bay on Sat
urday to face the 19th-ranked bears in its
last dual meet of the season, and head
coach Richard Quick looks to complete
his seventh straight season without a
dual-meet defeat.
"Cal is not going to surprise us from a
team point of view," Quick said. "They
have two or three swimmers that could
challenge us in individual events, but the
overall outcome will be a win for us. The
value in this meet is that it gives us one
last tune up for the Pac-10 champi
onships and NCAAs in March."
Last year, Stanford won the meet 194-
93, but Cal has several swimmers that
could test Stanford in individual events.
Ail-American Anna Simcic leads a tal
ented backstroke crew for the Bears that
has the potential to challenge Jessica
Tong and Tammy Shannon, Stanford's
top backstrokers.
All-American Larissa Herold might
also give the Cardinal's senior co-captain
Kendra Thayer trouble in the 400-yard
individual medley. Herold took sixth in
the IM at the national championships last
year, and Saturday will be a good chance
for Thayer to see what competition will
be like in the finals at the championships
this year.
Though individual races could be close
this weekend, Stanford clearly enters the
meet as the team to beat. The Bears are a
solid team with a 7-6 record, and they
placed fifth at the Pac-10 championships
last year. However, the Cardinal are 7-0
overall (4-0 in the Pac-10), and the sprint
free squad led by Thompson and Sopho
more Claudia Franco is swimming faster
than ever.
Both Franco and Thompson have
already qualified automatically for the
NCAA championship meet, while fresh
men Becky Bicknell and Lindsay Gassner
are provisional qualifiers.
Stanford is also strong in the diving
and distance freestyle events.
"The distance end of the lineup is real
ly shaping up for us," Quick said. "Kendra
Thayer and Sarah Anderson had great
performances last weekend, and they lead
Stanford's distance free arsenal in the
freestyle and individual medley."
Sophomore Anderson has already
swum a full two seconds faster than the
automatic NCAA qualifying time in the
1650-vard freestyle, and senior Richetel-
