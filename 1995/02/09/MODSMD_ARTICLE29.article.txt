The Stanford women's gym
nastics team visits Beaver coun
try Friday and is ready to tangle
with Oregon State, a powerful
squad which should offer the Car
dinal better competition than
Seattle Pacific, UC-Davis and
UC-Santa Barbara did during last
Friday's Stanford triumph at
Burnham Pavilion.
"They've always been a good
team," said assistant coach Lisa
Mitzel-Izzi. "It will be a big chal
lenge."
This week's practice found the
Stanford gymnasts focusing on
the small details of their perfor
mances, such as landings, form
and execution. They also worked
on adding new skills to their rou
tines, which they hope to show
case against the Beavers.
"A lot of people have some
tougher skills to put in," said
senior Tina Snowden. "We all
want to start closer to a 10 by
increasing our difficulty."
Stanford enters the meet with
out freshman all-arounder Amy
Neil, who learned last week that
she would be out for the season.
Neil suffered an injury two weeks
ago in practice when she landed
awkwardly while working on her
floor routine. The original diag
nosis suggested that Neil had suf
fered a sprain, but an MRI test
later showed a tear in her anteri
or cruciate ligament.
"This just means that when I
come back next year, I'll be even
stronger," Neil said.
The Cardinal will miss Neil
most on the uneven bars, where
her 9.6 average will be difficult to
replace. However, the depth of

this squad makes Neil's absence
from the lineup easier to bear.
Senior co-captain Katie Clancy,
junior Linda Chun and freshman
Misty Moore are all capable of
picking up the slack.
Neil's attitude toward her
injury has also made it less
painful on her teammates.
"Amy has been very positive,"
said head coach Breck Green
wood. "Since she is not moping
around, it really helps us a lot."

Katie Jennings still slowed by
injuries, freshman Keri Monahan
will have to maintain her high
level of performance.
Monahan has lived up to her
billing as one of this year's highly
touted recruits, placing near the
top in all of Stanford's meets.
Mitzel-Izzi said she is not sur
prised, adding that "she is doing
very well, but she could be doing
even better."
On Friday, the Cardinal will
attempt to put aside thoughts of
its numerous injuries and focus
on the task at hand.
"I think we need to go out and
show people that we are the team
everybody expects us to be," said
freshman Christie Jones.
