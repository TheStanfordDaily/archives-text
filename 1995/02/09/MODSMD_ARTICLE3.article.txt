## STOP 187 plans expanded focus 
### Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing writer 
Students Together Opposing Proposition 187 had
its first meeting of the quarter to discuss issues con
cerning the newly passed measure and its implica
tions at both the state and national levels.
The group's first goal is national mobilization —
sending support and assistance to groups outside
Stanford which are fighting a proposition similar to
187 on the national level.
Congressional Republicans' "Contract with
America" states that national lawmakers should
push for a law similar to California's Proposition 187,
which denies social services to illegal immigrants.
Despite its passage, members still feel very strong
ly about the moral implications of the new law. "It's a
racist and classist proposition based on the color of
skin and whether one speaks English or not," said
Kris Hayashi, a group member.
The group also hopes to inform people in Califor
nia who think the new law is in effect that the contro
versial measure is currently tied up in the court sys
tem until a decision on its constitutionality is
reached.
STOP 187, which was formed last fall, has worked
on phone-campaigning and voter registration, led dis
cussions of the proposition and held several rallies.
This quarter, in order to inform Stanford students
that the law is not yet in effect, the group hopes to
form general discussion groups within dormitories.
The group also plans on contacting previous mem
bers as well as others who might be interested in join
ing their efforts by notifying other minority groups
on campus.
On a national level, the group will contact similar
organizations to offer them information and support
in their campaigns. Yale University, for example, is
planning a rally this weekend and Harvard Universi
ty and the University of Chicago are also planning ral
lies in the near future which the group plans to sup
port.
"Our energy needs to be placed in creating these
contacts and a coalition outside of Stanford," one
member said at the meeting.
Except for Hayashi, those in
attendance did not want their
names to be used.
The group is also publishing a
flier — which will be distributed
nationally — about how people
around the country can become
involved in the fight against laws
similar to Proposition 187.
"We have the ideas but we need
people power," one member assert
ed.
Group members seem ready to
tackle the new issues targetting ille
gal immigrants — both on the
national and state level — even
after their disappointment with
Proposition 187's passage.
In the past "a lot of good work
happened," Hayashi said. "A lot of
students came together who never
did before."
"I wasn't surprised that the
proposition passed, but it was frus
trating," said another member.
The group will reconvene in two
weeks to work on implementing
ideas.
