# Fencers will duel Duke
## 
### Jason Weintraub Contributing writer 
When Stanford men's fencing coach
Zoran Tulum took over the team six years
ago, the program was in its infancy. "We

had nothing," Tulum remembers. With
out scholarships to entice outstanding
high school fencers, he had to rely on
superior coaching and Stanford's strong
academic reputation to lure fencers
away from national powerhouses.
Slowly, Tulum built a competi
tive team and Stanford responded
with a new, state-of-the-art fencing
facility in Roble Gym to further the
Cardinal's efforts in attracting
recruits. Today, the Stanford pro
gram has established itself as the
best on the West Coast, and they
will have a chance this weekend to
prove themselves against the top
teams of the East at a tournament
hosted by Duke.
This past weekend at UC-San
Diego, the Cardinal fencers demol
ished the top schools in California,
going undefeated in six matches.
The results bring the records of
Stanford's men's and women's

teams to an impressive 8-0. Despite
never facing the danger of losing a
match, Coach Tulum said that the
team can fence even better.
"I wouldn't say we fenced
extremely well, but a win's a win,"
Tulum said. "The men's foil and
sabre teams crushed this weekend;
they had no problem." The men's
and women's epee teams, on the
other hand, "had a little problem
with collegiate fencers that lacked
our level of experience."
Noting that at times Stanford
fenced down to its competition,
Tulum said that "they were sur
prised when their opponents didn't
react [to moves by Stanford fencers]
the way experienced fencers usually
do. They're used to higher-level
fencers."
Stanford fencers will get all the
competition they can handle at
Duke this weekend. In addition to
the Blue Devils, the Cardinal will
fence North CaroLina, William and

Mary (men only), James Madison
(women only) and defending NCAA
champion Notre Dame.
"Clearly we could have trouble
with Notre Dame," Tulum said,
pointing out that the Fighting Irish
have several scholarship fencers
who had many years of experience
before entering college. By contrast,
Stanford's women's foil team has
four students who came to the team
after taking a fencing physical edu
cation class. Nevertheless, the
squad performed extremely well
over the weekend, with senior
Michelle Butler leading the team by
winning 17 of her 19 bouts. Tulum
also praised the fencing of freshman
Caitlin Pickart, who won 50 percent
of her matches despite joining the
team from a physical education
class only two months ago.
Stanford should gather most of
its wins with the men's and
women's epee teams and the men's
foil team. The men's foilists will be

led by freshman phenom Sean
McClain, who went undefeated in
San Diego, and senior Geoff Don
aker, who lost just once. In men's
epee, the team is paced by senior
Doug Vanderbilt and sophomore
Chris Connell. The women are led
by epee specialists Morgan Hoch
and Stephanie Wien.
"We have a strong epee team,"
Tulum said. "No one in the West
can beat us. We'll get our best test
this weekend." The tournament will
foreshadow the upcoming NCAA
national championship tourna
ment, in which Cardinal fencers will
attempt to bring some individual
titles home to Stanford.
"As a team we're not quite at the
level of a Notre Dame or a Penn
State," Tulum said. After another
strong recruiting year, however,
"maybe next year we can bring
home a title."
From humble beginnings, great
ness emerges.
