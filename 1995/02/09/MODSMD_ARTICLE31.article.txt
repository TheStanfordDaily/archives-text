# Equestrian maintains advantage
## 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
With another impressive performance this
past weekend, the Stanford equestrian team
continues to head where no Cardinal squad has
gone before — the Zone 8, Region 1 summit.
In 10 years of existence, the Cardinal has
never climbed to the peak of the westernmost
region at season's end. In this campaign, a
fresh crop of newcomers has injected new life
into the always competitive program. With
the English team's victory at Fresno State
last weekend, the Cardinal's lead increased
to a tenuous five points over surprising Ore
gon.
The Western squad, in only its second year
of existence, also continues to be a surprising

force. A fourth-place finish at Fresno still kept
the Cardinal in the runner-up slot in the cumu
lative standings, although a distant 32 points
behind the front-running Bulldogs.
Co-president Quito Perlman pointed out
that the squad overcame the absence of several
members to come away with the win.
"People rode really, really well," Perlman
said. "We had a couple people missing, one with
an injury and a couple people with personal
problems who couldn't go. Despite those three
people missing the team performed solidly."
The team also experienced a dose of
inclement weather, for a change. Despite
muddy conditions, the Cardinal still prevailed
over the other eight schools.
For the third consecutive meet, freshman
Amanda Hoche received the high-point honor

for the best overall score. Actually, Hoche man
aged only a second in the open flat and fourth
place in open fences, but still garnered the top
prize.
Sophomore Ines Diogo and Amanda Boyd
joined Hoche in the winners circle with blue
ribbons for capturing the mounted fences and
beginning walk-trot-canter classes respectively.
Freshman Katherine Williams rounded out the
Cardinal victory parade.
Still, with only a five-point advantage after
six meets, the Cardinal must look over its
shoulder to keep the overall lead away from the
oncoming Oregon Ducks.
"They have some very solid riders," Perlman
said. "They are really the only other team that
matches our depth. But we've outperformed
them so far, and we hope to keep it that way."
