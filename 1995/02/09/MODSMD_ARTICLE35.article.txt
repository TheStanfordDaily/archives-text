# Peep Thoughts
## A 						Return to Love — eh? 
### 
It's hard enough to pin down the mem
bers, and meaning, of "Generation X,"
much less determine how we feel about
that most elusive of subjects — obscenely red
cardiac boxes of chocolates, big, bright Hall
mark cards with stupid poems and aspirin-like
candy hearts.
No, no, no, what I really mean is love and
romance, slacker-style. What happens when a
generation too blas£ for the sexual revolution
comes of age? Especially when said generation,
as depicted by "Reality Bites" and subsequent
pop-culture fallout, is too damn lazy to get off
the couch? At Stanford, however, this existen
tial ennui would translate into a week-long
mental argument with yourself on reason-not
to, and then deciding, no, I'm committed to
staying on this couch by myself. I admit this is
about Valentine's Day, too, but ever since it
eloped with the greeting card industry, it's been
the black sheep of the family.

In any case, from "Reality Bites" to the pro
liferation of R&B lite Boyz II Men's clones,
popular stuff has stepped up the hawking of
old-fashioned head-over-heels love just as the
"family values" mantra of certain politicians
has gotten louder. Indeed, the country's '94
election lapse for the Way Things Were seemed
yet another spoke in some expanding wheel of
culture that's been spinning nostalgia and ro
mance Cream of Wheat ever since Harry Con
nick, Jr. became hip.
But when, I wonder, did it infect my gener
ation? I certainly don't feel ready for love and
marriage, pot roast and mah-jongg tea parties.
We were supposed to be the hardened, highest
parental-divorce-rate, battle-scarred children
of families in upheaval. Safe sex, yes; love,
ewww — people have cooties, you know.
Then again, even the first crude prototypes
for '90s alienated grunge carried inside them
the seeds of romanticism, bruised but intact

They say, after all, that a cynic is only a disap
pointed idealist.
All the signs were there in Cameron Crowe's
"Singles." Don't let the garage band sound
track or the greasy-goatee-and-waif pairing of
Matt Dillon and Bridget Fonda deceive you:
Prime, yet digestible, cheese. Fonda spends
most of the movie trying to pin down No
Committment Boy with blind delusional ado
ration and the lure of silicone-plumpened
breasts, only to finally win him over with her
apathy. Bridget's reaction, though, is the pure
embodiment of slacker self-imposed disillu
sionment: she throws herself and her heart at
Dillon's struggling musician in exchange for a
well-timed "Gesundheit" to her sneeze.
And, of course, the lovely life-after-coliege
picture "Reality Bites," is now — for better or
worse — inextricably linked with our genera
tion. I must confess, however, that as I left the
theater dazed, "Bites'" attempt to shed clarity

on my life resulted only in the indelible and du
bitable vision, "all one needs is love, and Ethan
Hawke." Yikes.
If I slip into this X-er transcendental vision,
I feel like a kid watching a scary movie, and I
know the movie will scare me into sleepless
ness so I cover my eyes, but I can't resist the
thrill so I crack open my fingers. Whoa, shake
it off.
Y'all have got to be feeling it too though.
Even Madonna is sounding a little more sedate;
X-er magazines are rhapsodizing on love and
friendship; Kate Moss is wearing lipstick; and 1
know you've been listening to Tony Bennett.
But really, even I'm starting to feel left out of
the "Sleepless in Seattle" thing. I have a sudden
urge to watch anything with Audrey Hepburn
in it. The cult is beckoning.
And so are the days of our lives— until the
next angst-ridden culture cycle. Whee. ■
