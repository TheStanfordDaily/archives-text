# Materpiece Theatre This Isn't
## But you'll laugh, you'll cry – it's letter than "Cats"

O/ liose looking for a quiet night at
/ the theatre or a politically correct
— but enjoyably sedate — evening
in San Francisco should skip "Beyond Ther
apy."
"Therapy" — now in its third year run
ning in the City — is a loud, unsubtle, rau
cous, more-than-slightly crazy (no pun in
tended) look at dating, political correctness
and neuroses. In it, six characters compete to
see who can stray furthest from sanity.

As directed by Jerry Walker, "Therapy

feels at home in the Mason Street The

atre — a venue where we have to

pass an elderly security guard

and walk up a (light of stairs

painted the same color as

the Green Monster in Fen

way Park.
The cheese factor is a
bit high at the begin
ning when Andrew — a
waiter at a restaurant
with worse than terri
ble service — comes
out to offer lis a greeting

and a warning, <) In din
ner theatre: "If you feel

the need to be politically
correct tonight, now's the

c
time to leave."
From that point on, Christo

pher Durang's blatant comedy fo-

cuses on the story of Bruce, a bisexual

in a steady relationship with his jealous

male lover, Bob. Bruce meets Prudence, a

writer for People magazine, through a per

sonal ad he places at the suggestion of his

therapist.
The love triangle, intermixed with each
character's relationship with a psychiatrist,
forms the crux of the comedy. "Interperson
al relationships gone awry" would be an apt
subtitle for the show.
"Therapy" is double cast, so almost any '
mixture of the 13 actors (including Walker,
who plays the role of Bob on some nights)

could appear on a given evening. This adds a
spontaneous, improvisational quality to the
production.
For example, Kimberly Hedzik is enthusi
astic and fun to watch as the high-strung
Prudence, an attractive perfectionist who
constantly fails at her relation-

ships. Her com-

panion in

the

role, I liana

Xauderer, is a Stan

ford graduate who strutted her stuff recently i
in some Ram's Head musicals, including i
"Into the Woods" and "West Side Story."
Randall Nott is charming as Bruce Lath- I
rop, a confused lawyer whose therapist en- ■
courages him to express his emotions. Cry
ing at the drop of a hat, Nott deals with both I
Prudence and Bob with aplomb.

The therapists, of course, are crazier than
their patients, brine's psychiatrist, Dr. Char
lotte Wallace, wanders the set with a stuffed
dog which she makes bark whenever some
one makes an emotional breakthrough. Urg
ing everyone to be free with their emotions,
she is never happier than when she

achieves that state by re-

peatedly calling

Bob a

"co c k -

sucker."

Dr. Stuart Fram

ingham, Prudence's sleazy psycho, is a pre
mature ejaculator who had a two-night affair
with his patient. Jealous of Prudence's rela
tionships with other men, Framingham
claims to he the most macho of the males.
The set provides its own chance for
humor. The two psychiatrist's offices are mir
ror images of each other, while Bruce's apart

ment is the same turniture rearranged once
more. Set changes, — executed by the actors
— are crisp and clean, with the final elements
dropping into place at a snap of the waiter's
fingers.
Timing is important because the farce at
points almost swerves into slapstick, as phys
ical comedy becomes as frequent as verbal. At
the end of the first act, the action gets overly
frantic and in the end all the loose ends are
tucked into place a bit too neatly. But the
sheer gaiety of the absurd play makes up for
these flaws and the lack of any serious quali-

ty.

Absurdist dialogue reigns supreme

in "Therapy." In the middle of one

session, Mrs. Wallace looks up at

her patient and says, "Oops,

sorry. Thought you were sonic
one else." Meanwhile, Dr.
Framingham issues advice to
Prudence: "Don't get hung up
on who has a license."
The insanity of relation
ships is also well-covered.
One of the best lines: "I didn't
think you were insane. Just sort
C I' .1

of... lively.
"Therapy" ultimately ap-

pears as something between car-

toon and cabaret — a bit larger than

life. Although the work was first writ-

ten in the 'SOs, relationships and psychia
try seem to have changed little with the new
decade.
That's why "Beyond Therapy" gives us all
a chance to laueh at ourselves.
