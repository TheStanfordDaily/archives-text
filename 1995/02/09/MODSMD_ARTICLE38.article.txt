## World Pop Machine Mixes Message and Music Vibes 
### Sangeetha Ramanujam 
CCIT a musique est passionnement
eternelle." Over dinner, Zairian
-I—/ Afro-pop singer Shaka-Ra talked
about a king who wanted to take care of his
people and therefore gave them music be
cause it is passionately eternal. Inspired by
this tale, which is deeply embedded in the
folklore of his native country, Shaka-Ra
wrote "Kamulangu" — one example of his vi
brant pop/reggae/rock musical style.
"Plato once said that music is the moral law,
charming to the world and passionately eter
nal," Shaka-Ra said in French, pointing out the
wonder of how an ancient African king and
Plato said practically the same thing.
It's evident when talking to Shaka-Ra that
for him, music is a passionate art form. His
voice, even when he's just speaking, is lyrical.
Sometimes, his body even starts slowly rocking
to a rhythm that he seems to hear in his mind.
Shaka-Ra is already known throughout
Africa and Europe as a singer, songwriter and
producer. I le was the composer and producer

behind Papa Wernba — a popular group in F.u
rope — who opened for Peter Gabriel's World
Tour in 1993. Currently, Shaka-Ra has formed
a new band — World Fop Machine. He has also
just finished producing an album for song
writer Janet 1 ler/.enberg, a member of the band
member who sings under the name Janet 11.
He first began performing at the age of 14
after his father turned him out of the house.
"1 le asked me if I wanted to become a musician
or follow some other profession," Shaka-Ra ex
plained. "When I said that I wanted to become
a musician, he told me to leave."
He was discovered playing at a nightclub
two years later by Ray Lema, a popular Zairian
music artist, who asked him to join his band.
The two men were later invited by the Rocke
feller Foundation to perform at American uni
versities. Since then, he has formed three suc
cessful bands of his own, first in Zaire and later
in Paris. "Paris is exactly between Zaire and the
United States. From there, I was close to both."
Although he retains ties with all three coun
tries, he wonders if he belongs to any. "I go
there [to Zaire) they think I sound too Ameri
can. I come here and they think I sound like an

African. Despite this contusion, he
remains a musician who sings what
he feels he has to.
"Music is his country," Janet H.
told me.
Shakii-Ra and the World Pop Ma
chine will make their American
debut with an AIDS benefit concert
at Stanford this Saturday. This will be
the first stop in a West-Coast tour
that may later be expanded national
ly to help AIDS patients in Zaire. "We
need to make more people aware.
| We must] discuss AIDS in schools,
yet people to talk about it. I'd like to
do something like that."
"We're still at the honeymoon
stage," Janet H. said of the band.
Although a new group, the mem
bers — who come from the United
States, Brazil, Zaire and Santo
Domingo — promise to provide a
revolutionary and very eclectic form
of music.
"Shakii-Ra has finally found a
group that he wants to hold onto.

Perhaps it's this new style of music. 1 le wants to
protect a good thing," said Janet H. With their
enthusiasm and talent, they'll probably do it.
The conversation was a vibrant one that
moved freely between the five of us: Shaka-Ra,
Stanford alumnus Janet H. and her parents —

the Herzenbergs (who are both

professors in the School of

Medicine) — and my
self. Everyone con

Janet H. told me about going
to Zaire with Shaka-Ra. "It was soon after

I met him," she recalled. "We landed at the air
port and he left me with the luggage and disap
peared with the passports. He came back a lit
tle while later and told me 'Now it's your turn.'
So I went in and this guy was sitting at a desk,
holding my passport. He looked at it and then
looked at me." She picked up a menu for effect,
glanced at it, and then eyed me, repeating this

procedure several times. "He asked, 'So you're
American?' and I said, 'Yes.' He looked down
again. 'What are you doing in Zaire?' I ex
plained to him that I was just vacationing. By
this time, I was really nervous. He eyed me
again. 'You sing with Shaka-RS?' And I said

Yes.' And he looks down at the

passport for a long time and

finally said, 'You must
be a really good mu-
is a

7 he admits
' he does not
see this as his
first calling. "I

don't make a
profession of it. If I

hear music that I like,
then I'll produce it."

In both his own music as
well as others', Shaka-Ra seems to be

searching for the same thing, a narrative. "I like
stories of a perfect world, a place of harmony.
There might be war now, but one day, things
will get better." 1 le cited South Africa as an ex
ample. "Now, there are white people and black
people living together [peacefully! in one
country."
Taking such stories, Shaka-Ra has man

aged to create perfect harmony within his
music. It's impossible to tell how much
work he has put into it because it flows nat
urally. Shaka-Ra has the amazing ability
not to just accompany the words with in
struments but to also enhance them. Lis
tening to the songs he has produced for
Janet H., the depth of his talent is evident.
With the appropriate musical instruments
and his own voice softly chiming in at exactly
the right moments, he takes the beautiful
words that she has written and adds meaning
to them while still retaining their original po
etry.
Several of the songs from lanet H.'s album
will be presented at the Stanford concert. Al
though an AIDS benefit, the focus of the per
formance will be the music accompanied by a
slide show. It is a concert that Janet H. and
Shaka-Ra have been planning for over a year.
They both see music as the most effective way
to talk about AIDS. "It's so much a part of cul
ture and lifestyle. We have to get people to dis-

cuss something very intimate," Shaka-Ra ex
plained.
He added, "the people who are trying to
find a cure for AIDS are important. We can't
lose track of that."
Earlier in the evening, when I arrived at
their studio, the World Pop Machine had near
ly finished recording a song. They rushed
about the studio, fiddling with their equip
ment, pausing now and then to explain to me
or the Herzenbergs how it all worked. Janet 11,
wandered around, looking for pictures and an
swering the phone. Various others walked in
and out while Shaka-Ra just listened.
At one point, not long after I made a remark
011 the poetry of Janet H.'s songs, he asked me
about literature. He rattled off the names of
various French poets that I am unfamiliar
with, his delight with them evident in his voice.
He talked about putting words to music, of
producing a song, of putting it together little by
little. "It's like a painting," he said.
Not long after that, everyone began to talk
about AIDS, and it occurred to me that in that
room there were two groups of people connect
ed by this concern — one from a musical stand

1 )uring dinner, we talked about music
as a "bigcircle with the artist at the cen
ter." Janet 11. and Shakii-Ra told the
story behind one of his songs. One
week every year, Zairian pygmies will
not work hut pay tribute to the Sun
God and celebrate. This celebration is
called the Bobongo, and it is part of the
"big circle", drawn there by Shakii-Ra's
music. It is perhaps this philosophy
that furthers Shaka-Ra's talent: his
recognition of music as a powerful art
form and its connection to all other
things — art, science, folklore, litera
ture and emotions. He realizes that
music is a circle that draws all things to
gether: "C'est <;a la vie. C'est <;a la real
ite."
