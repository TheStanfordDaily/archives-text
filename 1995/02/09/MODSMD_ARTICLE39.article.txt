# Modern dance, Newt Gingrich and degenerative art
## A 						conversation with Paul Taylor dancer David Grenke 
### Danielle Goldman 
Although I had
planned to inter
view David
(irenke of the Paul Taylor
Dance Company in his
hotel lobby, the compa
ny's public relations
manager quickly ex
plained that interviews
were conducted in the
bar and that drinks
would be on him. I could
have had anything to
drink free of charge, and I
chose water.
"What? I'm paying.
You could at least order a
fancy mineral water," the
manager said.
(irenke smiled, "Yea.
We're in the arts. We've
got all kinds of money."
Such a loaded com
ment naturally led to dis
cussion on funding for
the arts — a touchy sub
ject in today's political
climate. When asked
about the future of the
National Endowment for
the Arts and its impact
on modern dance,
(irenke said, "Don't get
me started." Neverthe-

less, (irenkc proceeded to liken 1 louse Speak
er Newt Gingrich's remarks on "weird perfor
mance art" to Adolf Hitler's comments about
degenerate art.
Grenke is clearly passionate about dance,
but he was not one of those children whose
parents put him in the ballet studio at age
three. In fact, like many young boys, Grenke
grew up playing ball.
"1 didn't come from a very artistic family,
although my mom wanted my sister to be in
theater." Grenke laughs, adding "She was the
talented one. I was always playing baseball."
It was not until he was a college sophomore
studying landscaping that David took his first
dance class. 1 le's been dancing ever since.
Enjoying the full support of his family,
David quit school in order to balance his
dance training with multiple pizza parlor jobs.

A San lose native, David swore that he would
never live in New York, but he soon realized
that the Big Apple was where the majority of
dance opportunities exist. So, like many aspir
ing dancers, he headed cast. David's experi
ence there differed from most, however — he

never had to wait tables. The talented Grenke
found work almost immediately.
Although Grenke danced with others he
fore joining the Paul Taylor Dance Company,
he wanted to be a Taylor dancer from the first
time he saw the world-renowned troupe in the

summer of 1985.
The physicality of
Taylor's work,
and its very
human quality,
immediately ap
pealed to Grenke,
who realized his
goal of becoming
a Taylor dancer in
1989.
Grenke is now
approaching his
six-year anniver
sary with the
company, an ac
complishment
which means,
much to his de
light, no more
double rooms
when on tour. In
addition to his
work with Tay
lor, Grenke, in
partnership with
his wife, heads
his own New
York-based
da nee/theater
company. He is
currently chore
ographing a
dance work
about Hitler's

degenerate art exhibit.
After an absence of 18 years, the Paul Tay
lor Dance Company returns to the South Bay
to perform the popularly acclaimed Compa
ny B; the West Coast premiere of homy Pa
pers, and revivals of Taylor's Esplanade and
Big Bertha, one of Taylor's darker pieces.
