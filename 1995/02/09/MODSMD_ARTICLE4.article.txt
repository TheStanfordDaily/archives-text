# Fac Sen to discuss changes in CIV track requirements
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Contributing writer 
A controversial recommenda
tion to reduce the total number
of distribution requirements by
incorporating more material
into the Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues program will come up for de
bate at today's Faculty Senate
meeting.
The final vote on the issue
will not be until later this year,
but the senate will hear and dis
cuss the Commission on Under
graduate Education's proposal
for such a cultures core, along
with alternative plans that have
been proposed.
"All of this is an attempt to
see if there isn't some common
ground," said Senate Chair Bob
Simoni, a biology professor.
"In anticipation of the senate
meeting, there have been lots of
other little group meetings," Si
moni said. "This senate meeting
is the last of these general dis
cussions."
The commission report sug
gests lowering the total number
of distribution requirements by
expanding the CIV program —
Area 1 in the DRs — to cover
Areas 2 and 3, which are World

Cultures and American Cul
tures respectively.
Protest against the recom
mendation has included a letter

of complaint
sent to Campus
Report last
month from 40
CIV faculty
members who
felt the com
mission's pro
posed changes
would create
too great a bur
den on the CIV
program.

History Prof. Paul Seaver, di
rector of the CIV program, said
he will outline his feelings on
the benefits and drawbacks to
the commission recommenda
tion at the meeting. The CIV
program doesn't have its own
proposal for "any kind of radical
change," he said.
Despite the letter, CIV facul
ty members "aren't hostile to
the proposal that in some fash
ion the DRs be reduced or hos
tile to the proposal that the Area
1 requirement be somehow com
bined with another require
ment," Seaver said.
In addition, the Humanities

and Sciences Council last week
developed a recommendation
that would reduce the total
number of DRs by one.
Rather than consolidate
Areas 1, 2 and 3 into a Cultures
Core, the council suggests that
the core fulfill both Area 1 and
one other DR.
"I think it is a nice, workable
compromise," said council Chair
Judith Brown. "If we're looking
to ease the pressure on students
by cutting down the DRs, we're
offering one DR. The other one
will have to be found."
This proposal allows more
flexibility that might attract
CIV faculty who "don't want to
see a major overhaul," Brown
said. "They have made many
changes in the past five or six
years, and they feel good about
these changes. This proposal al
lows them to keep the structure
they already have."
In their current format, the
CIV tracks "could easily fit one
or the other" of the remaining
DRs, Brown said. "The ones
that don't could [fit] without a
major overhaul."
"I think it's likely to have

widespread support among the fac
ulty," she said.
The council's Steering Commit
tee is sponsoring a forum at 3:15
p.m. Monday in Room 2 of the His
tory Corner for faculty members to
discuss the future of the CIV pro
gram.

Senate member Mary Pratt — a
Spanish professor and CIV track
organizer — said the senate's dia
logue on the many methods of
reducing requirements will be
important.
Pratt said she will offer her con
cerns about CIV in its present
form and inform the senate of the
input she has received about the
options for change. She has heard
"no support for the CUE propos
al," Pratt said, "but there are some

really interesting suggestions out
there."

At the meeting, "people will get
a sense about what the lay of the
land is," she said. "If there are con
cerns, they'll come out."
After discussing the various pro
posals, the senate hopes to deter
mine "what the prospects are that
we can come to a short-term solu
tion," Simoni said. If the prospects
are good, "we can proceed quickly,"
he said, because so many other pro

posals have already been offered.
"If, however, there is absolutely
no agreement, one thinks about an
overhaul of the entire thing. I think
we'll have a clear idea of which
path we can follow" after the meet
ing, he added.
The discussion will be limited to
one hour in the formal setting of
the meeting, which will be followed
by an informal meeting of faculty
senate members with University
President Gerhard Casper.
