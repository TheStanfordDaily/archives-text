# LIVING NEAR The Edge Recent Stanford alums rock off the beaten path
## 
### Taylor Antrim 
JM mid the hoopla of carcer fairs, CPPC work
shops, beckoning full-page Trilogy ads and
M F parental nagging, the abyss of post-Stanford life
looms large. Many are the sleepless nights of wayward
Stanford seniors. June inexorably approaches; there are
plans to be made, resumes to be written, transcripts to
be ordered. Glossy-eyed and trembling, these men and
women contemplate their first days after college, their
first creeping toe-hold on the Everest of real life.

Lost among them are the Stanford musi
cians. The real world is not for them. Heads
full of dreams, they stroll out of Stanford with
their guitars and drum sets strapped to their
backs, ready for the success they are sure to
have. The abandon of the artistic, the call of
the wild.
Well, maybe not. Tracking down and in
terviewing three ex-campus bands — the
Basics, Occam's Razor and Mindslam —
told me a different story. Fickle and unpre
dictable, success has eluded most, and the
demands on courage and perseverance are
high.
These three groups have kept at it in the
face of hardship and poverty. While the real
world has taken its toll, not one has failed in
the face of high stakes and scant rewards.

I meet the Basics on a crowded Friday af
ternoon in the Coffee House. At one point
during our talk, Drew Kobilio, sound tech
nician and official member of the band,
tells me about a show they did in an out
door amphitheater at Azusa Pacific College.
"Everything's set up, the people are coming
in, we're getting excited . . . and the sprin
kler system comes on and just douses our
entire sound system. I was ripping my
clothes off and throwing them on the sprin
kler heads."
Wade Baynham, singer and guitarist,
chimes in, laughing. "We spent 35 to 40 min
utes blow-drying the speakers."
This immediate ease and self-effacement
characterizes the entire interview. Wade,

I )rew and Kelly Baynham tell me with charm
about past embarrassments along the road to
their own success. "We played the Special
Olympics," Kelly says, cringing.
"I think people thought we were compet
ing," Wade adds. "Probably the low point of
our Stanford careers."
Anyone who has ever heard their inspired
and immensely satisfying mix of pop and folk
would be hard-pressed to believe them. With
four independently released albums, the Ba
sics have become something of an institution.
And that couldn't have happened to nicer
people.
Wade and Kelley broke out of their artis
tic pasts as a Dolly and a Mendicant with
"The Calling," their first band. "It was all
over the map," says Wade. "Sometimes we'd
be on and sometimes we wouldn't play any
thing for a long time." They recruited Drew
in 1986 to do sound work, but the band ran
into troubles. "Since we kept losing people,
Kelly and I decided we kept coming down to
the basics of what we could play: acoustic
stuff. It was a joke name. It stuck and we
were stuck with it."
An inspirational Indigo (iirls show at the
Coffee House in 1990 sealed it. "We were
blown away," Drew tells me. "We said, 'We
could do that."
A semi-helpful club owner in San Francis
co who promised to make them as big as the
Kingston Trio (dare to dream!) tore the Ba
sics away from the St. Michael's Alley regular
rotation. Since then, they've played all
around the Bay Area and toured from Seattle
to San Diego four times.
"Our goal is not to be the local band that
hangs around for twenty years and never
goes away. We definitely have been looking at
record deals for a while, but nothing has
seemed a good fit. Unless we can get good
artistic backing for what we want to do, we're
not interested," Wade says.
Success on their own terms is a noble pur
suit, and the excellent "Haven Road" —
their newest release — should convince any
deal makers that the Basics know how to
please. The catchy album abounds with self
assurance and maturity. And the fans know
it: the album has sold more in the first three
months than anything they've ever recorded
before.
"So," I ask, "when did you know you
weren't going to be, 1 don't kn0w...."
"Lawyers?" says Drew.
"Right."
"It was hard for us because we did really
well in school and had big ideas about what
we were going to do. I was pre mod for two
years before I freaked out and went to Knglish.
So the thought, 'Well, we're not making any
money and all of our friends are' was tough to
swallow," he says.
"For me," says Kelly, "it's been this process
of having the confidence to say I think I can
and I want to give this a shot and who knows
how good we are comparatively."
"I think," Wade adds, "it's been a process of
discovering that we loved the music enough
to risk something for it."
Looking at the three band members, at
their content, happy faces, I get the feeling
that their risks have and will continue to pay
off.

dios. As I
drive up, I'm

v.. .. v v. K , ....
thinking, this is
rock 'n' roll. By just

walking towards the
place, I feel like slipping
into struggling rocker mode.

It is a long, low building under
neath an overpass, nearly shaking
with the thump of dozens of drum
sets.

Inside the last room on
the right, amid stacks of
equipment and instru
ments I find James Nash,
lead guitarist for the band.
Still at Stanford, a senior
majoring in computer sci-

ence, James tells me about how the rest
of the band found him in 1991. "1
was a solicitation," he says. "I'm

testament for people to go
into Tresidder and read the
board, because I did and

I've been with the
band for three
years."

Rhy th m
guitarist
Greg

Loos,

a 1990
political sci-

ence graduate,
will arrive next. In

the meantime, I'm
beginning to feel more

at home here. Greg and
James look like Stanford stu-

dents, and the attitude-laden feel
of San Bruno rocker central begins
to wear off.
"A couple of us were workinu at Ora-

cle | a software compa
ny]," C ireg tells me when I
ask him about his history
with the band. " I here's a
running joke at Stanford
that anyone who gradu
ates can get a job there.

Anyway, we weren't really focused on radio
play but on the goal of making an album.
1 here wasn't a lot of glamour in it. We put an
ad in the paper to get a drummer, another ad
tor a guitar players."
"It was really interesting," adds James.
"Very different from most bands who want big
gigs and lots of money. It sounded like a really
cool idea. Six crash practices and we started
recording."
That album, self-titled and released in
1992, garnered praise from both campus lis
teners and Bay Area critics. Much quieter than
their current sound, the album contains only
hints of the band's characteristic crowd-pleas
ing punch.
Greg tells me about this change in sound.
"When we started playing live, we realized
what kind of band we were, and it became
clear we wouldn't cut it as a rock and roll band.
You go into clubs and you have to keep people
entertained, keep them in the club, keep them
drinking. So 1 think our writing changed —
different rhythms, different styles, much more
energetic, upbeat and funky."
This switch has definitely treated Occam's
Razor well. Anyone who's heard them at nu
merous campus parties knows how well they
can work a crowd. They've also gained recog
nition in a supporting slot for the Smithereens
and as first runner-up in the San Francisco
Peninsula Battle of the Bands last year.
Greg talks about the band's success in an
other way: "We did a show the other night, a
three-and-a-half hour show, and we didn't
play a cover the entire night." With a song list
of over a hundred originals, Occam's Razor
seem destined to be more than just a club and
party band.
James tells me about the plans for a second
album. "We feel like we have more songs than
could fit on an album and not enough time to
work on the details. We've definitely come to
the realization that what we need is a produc
er that has the experience to do the things that
we're hearing and have trouble getting."
Then the door opens and three more guys
— lead singer lay Middleton, drummer Pete
Falcone and Bassist Dave Wu — walk into the
noisy, freezing room, lust in time for my last
question.
Five years from now, where is Occam's
Razor?
Various answers can be heard above the
noise. "At least our fourth album." "A couple
of rockumentaries." "Definitely some contro
versies."
Occam's Razor already has the talent, and
after a few more months in San Bruno they'll
have the attitude and the true mystique of a
rock 'n' roll band destined for stardom.
I've always thought that graduates who
have nothing better to do go live on Alma
Street. It's like some black hole of post-gradu
ate indecision. And so when Steve Bank,
drummer for punk-pop trio Mindslam, calls
to tell me his address, I inwardly cringe.
Sure enough, when I drive up for an inter
view, house Mindslam looks like every other
bungalow on Alma Street. An aura of slack
hangs over it like a bad paint job.
But by the end of the evening, I feel the need
to reassess. Mindslam's attitude and likable

qualities seem slated to blow my theory wide
open.
We start by talking music. Srini Kumar,
lead vocalist and guitarist, has an encyclopedic
knowledge of punk and other deviant musical
genres. Vixx, the bassist, attempts to join in
but is still reeling from a lingering love affair
with '80s glam metal. And Steve likes Rush. So
the conversation quickly degenerates.
"Did you know Axl Rose is an anagram for
oral sex?" asks Srini.
Srini and Steve were frosh together in 1989,
and that year saw the formation of their first
attempt at punk stardom, "The Turgid Mias
ma of Existence."
Srini tells me, "Neither of us had ever
played our instruments. We had no experi
ence whatsoever. At our first gig Steve played
on a cardboard box and two food service
trays. We did a Joy Division song, a Tracy
Chapman song. It was wretched, so bad it was
lovable."
Steve says,"It was very new for me. I done
all kinds of things, I'd taken pictures, I'd trav
eled a lot, I'd lived in foreign countries. I had
done everything and was still bored. This gave
me a creative outlet."
"It was like wow, let's be in a band," adds
Srini.
Vixx arrived the next year and the three be
came Mindslam. A practice space in the
Chaparral office allowed Srini, Steve and Vixx
to hone their innate musical talents. "We
played a lot," says Srini. "We were under-ap
preciated."
After graduating "in the teeth of the reces
sion," as Srini puts it, all three have worked
numerous jobs and Steve takes music classes
at San Jose State. Meanwhile, Mindslam has
evolved from playing ad-hoc frosh rock to
competent and exciting punk pop. Last

month saw the release of their first CD,
"Mayday." Building on the airy punch of
bands like Green Day and Samiam, Mind
slam have managed to produce a recording
with startling complexity and crushing ener
gy-
Vixx comments, "I think we're on the cusp
of something. We're definitely at a new stage."
But the frenetic pace of holding down jobs,
taking classes and being in a band has begun to
take its toll. "Its like being an unpublished au
thor," says Srini, "You're sitting there with
these manuscripts, sending them out, waiting
for a reply, even a rejection letter. I also think
that we're better than most bands, and maybe
that's hubris, but on a good night, we're a real
ly great band to see."
With any luck, Mindlsam won't have to
wait long for success. The three are optimistic,
envisioning a tour of Eastern Europe and a
guest spot on a Star Trek show for Steve some
time in the next five years.
"As long as I get better on the drums with
the feeling I want and even if we have a small
audience of 100 fans or so, then that's great."
If nothing else, Mindslam seems, despite
Steve's humility, slated to put Alma Street on
the map. ■

artistic backing for what we want to do, we're
not interested," Wade says.
Success on their own terms is a noble pur
suit, and the excellent "Haven Road" —
their newest release — should convince any
deal makers that the Basics know how to
please. The catchy album abounds with self
assurance and maturity. And the fans know
it: the album has sold more in the first three
months than anything they've ever recorded
before.
"So," I ask, "when did you know you
weren't going to be, 1 don't kn0w...."
"Lawyers?" says Drew.
"Right."
"It was hard for us because we did really
well in school and had big ideas about what
we were going to do. I was pre mod for two
years before I freaked out and went to Knglish.
So the thought, 'Well, we're not making any
money and all of our friends are' was tough to
swallow," he says.
"For me," says Kelly, "it's been this process
of having the confidence to say I think I can
and I want to give this a shot and who knows
how good we are comparatively."
"I think," Wade adds, "it's been a process of
discovering that we loved the music enough
to risk something for it."
Looking at the three band members, at
their content, happy faces, I get the feeling
that their risks have and will continue to pay
off.

thinking, this is
rock 'n' roll. By just

walking towards the
place, I feel like slipping
into struggling rocker mode.

It is a long, low building under
neath an overpass, nearly shaking
with the thump of dozens of drum
sets.

Inside the last room on
the right, amid stacks of
equipment and instru
ments I find James Nash,
lead guitarist for the band.
Still at Stanford, a senior
majoring in computer sci-

ence, James tells me about how the rest
of the band found him in 1991. "1
was a solicitation," he says. "I'm

testament for people to go
into Tresidder and read the
board, because I did and

I've been with the
band for three
years."

Rhy th m
guitarist
Greg

Loos,

a 1990
political sci-

ence graduate,
will arrive next. In

the meantime, I'm
beginning to feel more

at home here. Greg and
James look like Stanford stu-

dents, and the attitude-laden feel
of San Bruno rocker central begins
to wear off.
"A couple of us were workinu at Ora-

cle | a software compa
ny]," C ireg tells me when I
ask him about his history
with the band. " I here's a
running joke at Stanford
that anyone who gradu
ates can get a job there.

Anyway, we weren't really focused on radio
play but on the goal of making an album.
1 here wasn't a lot of glamour in it. We put an
ad in the paper to get a drummer, another ad
tor a guitar players."
"It was really interesting," adds James.
"Very different from most bands who want big
gigs and lots of money. It sounded like a really
cool idea. Six crash practices and we started
recording."
That album, self-titled and released in
1992, garnered praise from both campus lis
teners and Bay Area critics. Much quieter than
their current sound, the album contains only
hints of the band's characteristic crowd-pleas
ing punch.
Greg tells me about this change in sound.
"When we started playing live, we realized
what kind of band we were, and it became
clear we wouldn't cut it as a rock and roll band.
You go into clubs and you have to keep people
entertained, keep them in the club, keep them
drinking. So 1 think our writing changed —
different rhythms, different styles, much more
energetic, upbeat and funky."
This switch has definitely treated Occam's
Razor well. Anyone who's heard them at nu
merous campus parties knows how well they
can work a crowd. They've also gained recog
nition in a supporting slot for the Smithereens
and as first runner-up in the San Francisco
Peninsula Battle of the Bands last year.
Greg talks about the band's success in an
other way: "We did a show the other night, a
three-and-a-half hour show, and we didn't
play a cover the entire night." With a song list
of over a hundred originals, Occam's Razor
seem destined to be more than just a club and
party band.
James tells me about the plans for a second
album. "We feel like we have more songs than
could fit on an album and not enough time to
work on the details. We've definitely come to
the realization that what we need is a produc
er that has the experience to do the things that
we're hearing and have trouble getting."
Then the door opens and three more guys
— lead singer lay Middleton, drummer Pete
Falcone and Bassist Dave Wu — walk into the
noisy, freezing room, lust in time for my last
question.
Five years from now, where is Occam's
Razor?
Various answers can be heard above the
noise. "At least our fourth album." "A couple
of rockumentaries." "Definitely some contro
versies."
Occam's Razor already has the talent, and
after a few more months in San Bruno they'll
have the attitude and the true mystique of a
rock 'n' roll band destined for stardom.
I've always thought that graduates who
have nothing better to do go live on Alma
Street. It's like some black hole of post-gradu
ate indecision. And so when Steve Bank,
drummer for punk-pop trio Mindslam, calls
to tell me his address, I inwardly cringe.
Sure enough, when I drive up for an inter
view, house Mindslam looks like every other
bungalow on Alma Street. An aura of slack
hangs over it like a bad paint job.
But by the end of the evening, I feel the need
to reassess. Mindslam's attitude and likable

qualities seem slated to blow my theory wide
open.
We start by talking music. Srini Kumar,
lead vocalist and guitarist, has an encyclopedic
knowledge of punk and other deviant musical
genres. Vixx, the bassist, attempts to join in
but is still reeling from a lingering love affair
with '80s glam metal. And Steve likes Rush. So
the conversation quickly degenerates.
"Did you know Axl Rose is an anagram for
oral sex?" asks Srini.
Srini and Steve were frosh together in 1989,
and that year saw the formation of their first
attempt at punk stardom, "The Turgid Mias
ma of Existence."
Srini tells me, "Neither of us had ever
played our instruments. We had no experi
ence whatsoever. At our first gig Steve played
on a cardboard box and two food service
trays. We did a Joy Division song, a Tracy
Chapman song. It was wretched, so bad it was
lovable."
Steve says,"It was very new for me. I done
all kinds of things, I'd taken pictures, I'd trav
eled a lot, I'd lived in foreign countries. I had
done everything and was still bored. This gave
me a creative outlet."
"It was like wow, let's be in a band," adds
Srini.
Vixx arrived the next year and the three be
came Mindslam. A practice space in the
Chaparral office allowed Srini, Steve and Vixx
to hone their innate musical talents. "We
played a lot," says Srini. "We were under-ap
preciated."
After graduating "in the teeth of the reces
sion," as Srini puts it, all three have worked
numerous jobs and Steve takes music classes
at San Jose State. Meanwhile, Mindslam has
evolved from playing ad-hoc frosh rock to
competent and exciting punk pop. Last

month saw the release of their first CD,
"Mayday." Building on the airy punch of
bands like Green Day and Samiam, Mind
slam have managed to produce a recording
with startling complexity and crushing ener
gy-
Vixx comments, "I think we're on the cusp
of something. We're definitely at a new stage."
But the frenetic pace of holding down jobs,
taking classes and being in a band has begun to
take its toll. "Its like being an unpublished au
thor," says Srini, "You're sitting there with
these manuscripts, sending them out, waiting
for a reply, even a rejection letter. I also think
that we're better than most bands, and maybe
that's hubris, but on a good night, we're a real
ly great band to see."
With any luck, Mindlsam won't have to
wait long for success. The three are optimistic,
envisioning a tour of Eastern Europe and a
guest spot on a Star Trek show for Steve some
time in the next five years.
"As long as I get better on the drums with
the feeling I want and even if we have a small
audience of 100 fans or so, then that's great."
If nothing else, Mindslam seems, despite
Steve's humility, slated to put Alma Street on
the map. ■

JM mid the hoopla of carcer fairs, CPPC work
shops, beckoning full-page Trilogy ads and
M F parental nagging, the abyss of post-Stanford life
looms large. Many are the sleepless nights of wayward
Stanford seniors. June inexorably approaches; there are
plans to be made, resumes to be written, transcripts to
be ordered. Glossy-eyed and trembling, these men and
women contemplate their first days after college, their
first creeping toe-hold on the Everest of real life.

Lost among them are the Stanford musi
cians. The real world is not for them. Heads
full of dreams, they stroll out of Stanford with
their guitars and drum sets strapped to their
backs, ready for the success they are sure to
have. The abandon of the artistic, the call of
the wild.
Well, maybe not. Tracking down and in
terviewing three ex-campus bands — the
Basics, Occam's Razor and Mindslam —
told me a different story. Fickle and unpre
dictable, success has eluded most, and the
demands on courage and perseverance are
high.
These three groups have kept at it in the
face of hardship and poverty. While the real
world has taken its toll, not one has failed in
the face of high stakes and scant rewards.

I meet the Basics on a crowded Friday af
ternoon in the Coffee House. At one point
during our talk, Drew Kobilio, sound tech
nician and official member of the band,
tells me about a show they did in an out
door amphitheater at Azusa Pacific College.
"Everything's set up, the people are coming
in, we're getting excited . . . and the sprin
kler system comes on and just douses our
entire sound system. I was ripping my
clothes off and throwing them on the sprin
kler heads."
Wade Baynham, singer and guitarist,
chimes in, laughing. "We spent 35 to 40 min
utes blow-drying the speakers."
This immediate ease and self-effacement
characterizes the entire interview. Wade,

I )rew and Kelly Baynham tell me with charm
about past embarrassments along the road to
their own success. "We played the Special
Olympics," Kelly says, cringing.
"I think people thought we were compet
ing," Wade adds. "Probably the low point of
our Stanford careers."
Anyone who has ever heard their inspired
and immensely satisfying mix of pop and folk
would be hard-pressed to believe them. With
four independently released albums, the Ba
sics have become something of an institution.
And that couldn't have happened to nicer
people.
Wade and Kelley broke out of their artis
tic pasts as a Dolly and a Mendicant with
"The Calling," their first band. "It was all
over the map," says Wade. "Sometimes we'd
be on and sometimes we wouldn't play any
thing for a long time." They recruited Drew
in 1986 to do sound work, but the band ran
into troubles. "Since we kept losing people,
Kelly and I decided we kept coming down to
the basics of what we could play: acoustic
stuff. It was a joke name. It stuck and we
were stuck with it."
An inspirational Indigo (iirls show at the
Coffee House in 1990 sealed it. "We were
blown away," Drew tells me. "We said, 'We
could do that."
A semi-helpful club owner in San Francis
co who promised to make them as big as the
Kingston Trio (dare to dream!) tore the Ba
sics away from the St. Michael's Alley regular
rotation. Since then, they've played all
around the Bay Area and toured from Seattle
to San Diego four times.
"Our goal is not to be the local band that
hangs around for twenty years and never
goes away. We definitely have been looking at
record deals for a while, but nothing has
seemed a good fit. Unless we can get good
artistic backing for what we want to do, we're
not interested," Wade says.
Success on their own terms is a noble pur
suit, and the excellent "Haven Road" —

their current sound, the album contains only
hints of the band's characteristic crowd-pleas
ing punch.
Greg tells me about this change in sound.
"When we started playing live, we realized
what kind of band we were, and it became
clear we wouldn't cut it as a rock and roll band.
You go into clubs and you have to keep people
entertained, keep them in the club, keep them
drinking. So 1 think our writing changed —
different rhythms, different styles, much more
energetic, upbeat and funky."
This switch has definitely treated Occam's
Razor well. Anyone who's heard them at nu
merous campus parties knows how well they
can work a crowd. They've also gained recog
nition in a supporting slot for the Smithereens
and as first runner-up in the San Francisco
Peninsula Battle of the Bands last year.
Greg talks about the band's success in an
other way: "We did a show the other night, a
three-and-a-half hour show, and we didn't
play a cover the entire night." With a song list
of over a hundred originals, Occam's Razor
seem destined to be more than just a club and
party band.
James tells me about the plans for a second
album. "We feel like we have more songs than
could fit on an album and not enough time to
work on the details. We've definitely come to
the realization that what we need is a produc
er that has the experience to do the things that
we're hearing and have trouble getting."
Then the door opens and three more guys
— lead singer lay Middleton, drummer Pete
Falcone and Bassist Dave Wu — walk into the
noisy, freezing room, lust in time for my last
question.
Five years from now, where is Occam's
Razor?
Various answers can be heard above the
noise. "At least our fourth album." "A couple
of rockumentaries." "Definitely some contro
versies."
Occam's Razor already has the talent, and
after a few more months in San Bruno they'll
have the attitude and the true mystique of a
rock 'n' roll band destined for stardom.
I've always thought that graduates who
have nothing better to do go live on Alma
Street. It's like some black hole of post-gradu
ate indecision. And so when Steve Bank,
drummer for punk-pop trio Mindslam, calls
to tell me his address, I inwardly cringe.
Sure enough, when I drive up for an inter
view, house Mindslam looks like every other
bungalow on Alma Street. An aura of slack
hangs over it like a bad paint job.
But by the end of the evening, I feel the need
to reassess. Mindslam's attitude and likable

qualities seem slated to blow my theory wide
open.
We start by talking music. Srini Kumar,
lead vocalist and guitarist, has an encyclopedic
knowledge of punk and other deviant musical
genres. Vixx, the bassist, attempts to join in
but is still reeling from a lingering love affair
with '80s glam metal. And Steve likes Rush. So
the conversation quickly degenerates.
"Did you know Axl Rose is an anagram for
oral sex?" asks Srini.
Srini and Steve were frosh together in 1989,
and that year saw the formation of their first
attempt at punk stardom, "The Turgid Mias
ma of Existence."
Srini tells me, "Neither of us had ever
played our instruments. We had no experi
ence whatsoever. At our first gig Steve played
on a cardboard box and two food service
trays. We did a Joy Division song, a Tracy
Chapman song. It was wretched, so bad it was
lovable."
Steve says,"It was very new for me. I done
all kinds of things, I'd taken pictures, I'd trav
eled a lot, I'd lived in foreign countries. I had
done everything and was still bored. This gave
me a creative outlet."
"It was like wow, let's be in a band," adds
Srini.
Vixx arrived the next year and the three be
came Mindslam. A practice space in the
Chaparral office allowed Srini, Steve and Vixx
to hone their innate musical talents. "We
played a lot," says Srini. "We were under-ap
preciated."
After graduating "in the teeth of the reces
sion," as Srini puts it, all three have worked
numerous jobs and Steve takes music classes
at San Jose State. Meanwhile, Mindslam has
evolved from playing ad-hoc frosh rock to
competent and exciting punk pop. Last

month saw the release of their first CD,
"Mayday." Building on the airy punch of
bands like Green Day and Samiam, Mind
slam have managed to produce a recording
with startling complexity and crushing ener
gy-
Vixx comments, "I think we're on the cusp
of something. We're definitely at a new stage."
But the frenetic pace of holding down jobs,
taking classes and being in a band has begun to
take its toll. "Its like being an unpublished au
thor," says Srini, "You're sitting there with
these manuscripts, sending them out, waiting
for a reply, even a rejection letter. I also think
that we're better than most bands, and maybe
that's hubris, but on a good night, we're a real
ly great band to see."
With any luck, Mindlsam won't have to
wait long for success. The three are optimistic,
envisioning a tour of Eastern Europe and a
guest spot on a Star Trek show for Steve some
time in the next five years.
"As long as I get better on the drums with
the feeling I want and even if we have a small
audience of 100 fans or so, then that's great."
If nothing else, Mindslam seems, despite
Steve's humility, slated to put Alma Street on
the map. ■

JM mid the hoopla of carcer fairs, CPPC work
shops, beckoning full-page Trilogy ads and
M F parental nagging, the abyss of post-Stanford life
looms large. Many are the sleepless nights of wayward
Stanford seniors. June inexorably approaches; there are
plans to be made, resumes to be written, transcripts to
be ordered. Glossy-eyed and trembling, these men and
women contemplate their first days after college, their
first creeping toe-hold on the Everest of real life.

Lost among them are the Stanford musi
cians. The real world is not for them. Heads
full of dreams, they stroll out of Stanford with
their guitars and drum sets strapped to their
backs, ready for the success they are sure to
have. The abandon of the artistic, the call of
the wild.
Well, maybe not. Tracking down and in
terviewing three ex-campus bands — the
Basics, Occam's Razor and Mindslam —
told me a different story. Fickle and unpre
dictable, success has eluded most, and the
demands on courage and perseverance are
high.
These three groups have kept at it in the
face of hardship and poverty. While the real
world has taken its toll, not one has failed in
the face of high stakes and scant rewards.

I meet the Basics on a crowded Friday af
ternoon in the Coffee House. At one point
during our talk, Drew Kobilio, sound tech
nician and official member of the band,
tells me about a show they did in an out
door amphitheater at Azusa Pacific College.
"Everything's set up, the people are coming
in, we're getting excited . . . and the sprin
kler system comes on and just douses our
entire sound system. I was ripping my
clothes off and throwing them on the sprin
kler heads."
Wade Baynham, singer and guitarist,
chimes in, laughing. "We spent 35 to 40 min
utes blow-drying the speakers."
This immediate ease and self-effacement
characterizes the entire interview. Wade,

I )rew and Kelly Baynham tell me with charm
about past embarrassments along the road to
their own success. "We played the Special
Olympics," Kelly says, cringing.
"I think people thought we were compet
ing," Wade adds. "Probably the low point of
our Stanford careers."
Anyone who has ever heard their inspired
and immensely satisfying mix of pop and folk
would be hard-pressed to believe them. With
four independently released albums, the Ba
sics have become something of an institution.
And that couldn't have happened to nicer
people.
Wade and Kelley broke out of their artis
tic pasts as a Dolly and a Mendicant with
"The Calling," their first band. "It was all
over the map," says Wade. "Sometimes we'd
be on and sometimes we wouldn't play any
thing for a long time." They recruited Drew
in 1986 to do sound work, but the band ran
into troubles. "Since we kept losing people,
Kelly and I decided we kept coming down to
the basics of what we could play: acoustic
stuff. It was a joke name. It stuck and we
were stuck with it."
An inspirational Indigo (iirls show at the
Coffee House in 1990 sealed it. "We were
blown away," Drew tells me. "We said, 'We
could do that."
A semi-helpful club owner in San Francis
co who promised to make them as big as the
Kingston Trio (dare to dream!) tore the Ba
sics away from the St. Michael's Alley regular
rotation. Since then, they've played all
around the Bay Area and toured from Seattle
to San Diego four times.
"Our goal is not to be the local band that
hangs around for twenty years and never
goes away. We definitely have been looking at
record deals for a while, but nothing has
seemed a good fit. Unless we can get good
artistic backing for what we want to do, we're
not interested," Wade says.
Success on their own terms is a noble pur
suit, and the excellent "Haven Road" —
their newest release — should convince any
deal makers that the Basics know how to
please. The catchy album abounds with self
assurance and maturity. And the fans know
it: the album has sold more in the first three
months than anything they've ever recorded
before.
"So," I ask, "when did you know you
weren't going to be, 1 don't kn0w...."
"Lawyers?" says Drew.
"Right."
"It was hard for us because we did really
well in school and had big ideas about what
we were going to do. I was pre mod for two
years before I freaked out and went to Knglish.
So the thought, 'Well, we're not making any
money and all of our friends are' was tough to
swallow," he says.
"For me," says Kelly, "it's been this process
of having the confidence to say I think I can
and I want to give this a shot and who knows
how good we are comparatively."
"I think," Wade adds, "it's been a process of
discovering that we loved the music enough
to risk something for it."
Looking at the three band members, at
their content, happy faces, I get the feeling
that their risks have and will continue to pay
off.

Oct**'*
A dark looming warehouse,
scary guvs in biker jackets tot-

ing amplifiers in the park
ing lot, a line of beat up
VW camper vans.

This is the scene
outside San

Brun os 's

Golden
Gat e

Pra c -
tice Stu-

dios. As I
drive up, I'm

v.. .. v v. K , ....
thinking, this is
rock 'n' roll. By just

walking towards the
place, I feel like slipping
into struggling rocker mode.

It is a long, low building under
neath an overpass, nearly shaking
with the thump of dozens of drum
sets.

Inside the last room on
the right, amid stacks of
equipment and instru
ments I find James Nash,
lead guitarist for the band.
Still at Stanford, a senior
majoring in computer sci-

ence, James tells me about how the rest
of the band found him in 1991. "1
was a solicitation," he says. "I'm

testament for people to go
into Tresidder and read the
board, because I did and

I've been with the
band for three
years."

Rhy th m
guitarist
Greg

Loos,

a 1990
political sci-

ence graduate,
will arrive next. In

the meantime, I'm
beginning to feel more

at home here. Greg and
James look like Stanford stu-

dents, and the attitude-laden feel
of San Bruno rocker central begins
to wear off.
"A couple of us were workinu at Ora-

cle | a software compa
ny]," C ireg tells me when I
ask him about his history
with the band. " I here's a
running joke at Stanford
that anyone who gradu
ates can get a job there.

Anyway, we weren't really focused on radio
play but on the goal of making an album.
1 here wasn't a lot of glamour in it. We put an
ad in the paper to get a drummer, another ad
tor a guitar players."
"It was really interesting," adds James.
"Very different from most bands who want big
gigs and lots of money. It sounded like a really
cool idea. Six crash practices and we started
recording."
That album, self-titled and released in
1992, garnered praise from both campus lis
teners and Bay Area critics. Much quieter than
their current sound, the album contains only
hints of the band's characteristic crowd-pleas
ing punch.
Greg tells me about this change in sound.
