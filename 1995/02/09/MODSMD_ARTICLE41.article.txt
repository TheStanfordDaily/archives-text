# "Boys on the Side" has mass appeal
## 
### 
A rerun of "Thelma and Louise;" a classic chick-flick;
a road trip movie; a feminist/gay rights political state
ment. From advance knowledge, "Boys on the Side"
looks to be either cheesy beyond belief or .1 shallow fe
male-buddy flick with relatively big-name stars.
Fortunately, it more than exceeds expectations. Ac
tresses VVhoopi Goldberg, Mary-Louise Parker and
Drew Barrymore pull off their three-way relationship
with style with a credible combination of seriousness
and slapstick.
The story begins with Jane (Goldberg), a self-pro
claimed "lesbo" who — after losing her singing job and
girlfriend — decides a move to Los Angeles is in order.
Enter Robin (Parker), a naive, repressed, WASPy

Boys on the Side

real-estate maven who sings Carpenter songs and ap
pears a bit on the thin side. Robin intends to relive her
childhood by driving cross-country to San I )iego. Along
the way, the duo picks up I lolly (Barrymore), the child
ish, abused girlfriend who can twist her man around any
finger she chooses.
The cast somehow manages to keep from becoming
caricatures of humanity while dealing with numerous
real-life issues like AIDS, wife abuse, murder, pregnan
cy, love and discrimination. Yet "Boys on the Side" is still
a comedy — the seriousness rarely lasts longer than the
time it takes to come up with the next caustic zinger.
Ultimately, "Boys" is a film about coming to terms
with yourself and those around you. Robin is a bit ner
vous about lesbianism and Jane dislikes Robin's her
itage, yet love and friendship abound. Laughter and
tears alternate, and often we laugh through our tears
while watching friendship's birth and death.

The roller coaster of emotions is reflected in the
movie's music. Perhaps the strongest element of the film
comes in sound rather than sight, with a cameo by the
Indigo (iirls and a soundtrack featuring Melissa
Etheridgeand Bonnie Raitt.
Directed by Herbert Ross, "Boys" manages to avoid
being either overly-happy or overly-dramatic, leaving
the simplicity of the story to speak for itself. The femi
nist and gay-rights messages of the film are evident but
not overwhelming; the three women and their relation
ships matter more than the issues surrounding them.
Although the audience tor "Boys" will probably lean
towards women and the gay community, the film's char
acters and their relationships have a universal appeal
that goes far beyond equality-driven politics.
