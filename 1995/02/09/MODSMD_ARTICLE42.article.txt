Milcho Manchevski doesn't have any problem with
getting to the point. Yet "Before the Rain," his award
winning feature debut, runs celluloid rings around its
subject matter before we realize how thoroughly we've

Before the Rain

been ensnared.
The film opens at a monastery tucked away on the
breathtaking mountainside of Macedonia, where kiril,
a young monk played byGregoire Colin encounters Za
mira (Labina Mitevska), a mysterious Albanian girl
hidden in his room. While their

communication is challenged by the
fact that he has taken a vow of si
lence and she speaks only Albanian,
the two nevertheless find under
standing and, eventually, even love.
When a group of angry
Macedonian villagers, intent on
finding and killing Zamira, force
their way into the monastery, Kiril
leaves the order to protect her. Un
fortunately, the couple doesn't
make it too far — a bloody tragedy

ends "Words," part one of this compelling, three-part
drama.
In "Faces" and "Pictures," we encounter London
based photo editor Anne (Katrin Cartlidge), her lover,
war photographer Aleksandar kirkov (Rade Serbedzi
ja), Anne's self-effacing husband Nick (lay Villiers) and
an assortment of Macedonian and Albanian villagers
from Aleksandar's youth.
Beautifully shot, "Before the Rain" is a circular nar
rative that makes use of three simple stories to explore
the pitfalls of ethnic conflict in the former Yugoslavia.
From Macedonia to London and back to Macedonia
again, characters meet, become entangled and are ulti
mately forced to face the consequences of their own in
action.
lust when we think we've escaped all that trouble
over there, cordoned off in a chichi London restaurant,
violence taps us on the shoulder and erupts uncontrol
lably. The more individuals try to ignore the real ten
sions in their surroundings, the more relentlessly vio
lence visits them.
This however, is no fatalistic tale, kirkov, after years
of making an artistic profit off of the misery of others,
decides to risk his life to save another human being. As
a result, the narrative opens itself up to hope and, we're
left with the indelible power of possibility.
