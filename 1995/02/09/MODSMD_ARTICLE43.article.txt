## "Boys of St. Vincent" explores 
### 
Few atrocities in life induce
bystanders to squirm as uncom
fortably in their shoes as the no
tion of child abuse. The makers
of "The Boys of St. Vincent " de
serve full credit for not shying
away from the hallowed

Boys of St. Vincent

grounds of organized religion
either, as the powerful two-part
Canadian film (each part is 90
minutes) deals unflinchingly
with the sexual and physical as
sault of young children by
Roman Catholic clergymen.
Prompted by events that
rocked Newfoundland in the
19705, the fictionalized script
resists movie-of-the-week sen
sationalism by shedding light
on, rather than overexposing, an
ugly but complex issue.
Brother Peter Lavin (Henry
Czerny), the main perpetrator
of evil at the St. Vincent orphan
age, is given such a harrowingly
human face that one is forced to
contemplate the sometimes im
possible delineation between
order and oppression, discipline
and derangement. This point is
particularly well illustrated by
the second part of the film set
some 15 years later, where the
ch i Id-molester-turned-loving
father-of-two now faces charges
in a much-belated court in
quiry.
The second half movingly
sketches the divergent develop
ments of fragile lives scarred in

their youth, centering on the re
union of Steven (David
Hewlett) and Brian Lunny
(Timothy Webber), two or
phaned brothers who have lost
contact for over a decade. Kevin
Reevey (Sebastian Spence),
Lavin's pet prey, is now a strap
ping young man who struggles
to decide if he should take the
witness stand and risk reopen
ing old wounds.
In comparison, the first part
smacks more of Dickens than
contemporary social commen
tary, as Lavin's reign of terror at
St. Vincent is depicted with a
somewhat contrived ferocity.
Nevertheless, Lavin's unholy
preoccupation with young
Kevin (Johnny Morina) is laid
out in quietly disturbing terms
that confront child eroticism
without resorting to gratuitous
ly graphic means.
Writer-director John N.
Smith refuses the convenience
of scapegoating homosexuality
to explain unhealthy psyches ex
acerbated by tyrannical vows of
clerical celibacy. Similarly, the
political ramifications of the
Catholic church are more than
merely hinted at.
The fact that the broadcast of
this made-for-TV feature was
banned by two Canadian
provinces in 1992 should not
have surprised anyone. Had
"The Boys of St. Vincent" been
made in this country, one has to
wonder if the portraits of such
brutal audacity would have been
shown anywhere at all.
Limited engagement at the Roxie
Cinema, San Francisco.
