"A Low Down Dirty Shame"
Various artists

with any lasting impression. But not too
long into the flick I found myself thinking,
well damn, that Jada Pinkett can act. And by
the movie's end, I thought, sure, it had been
entertaining, but one prime directive over
whelmed me: Get that soundtrack.
This is the type of CI) you take out when
you want to dance — or at least feel in the
mood — and because of circumstances be
yond your control, you just can't go out and
get your groove on. If you have this disc,
however, don't worry — at 18 tracks, "A
Low Down Dirt\' Shame holds a tempo
that will not quit.
You know you're in decent shape with a

pop/R&B line up sporting Zhane, Changing
Faces, R. Kelly, Silk, Aaliyah and levin
Campbell. Back that up with hip-hop artists
like Casual, the Fuschnickens, Souls of Mis
chief and a Tribe Called Quest's Q-tip, and
it's virtually impossible go wrong.
Among the album's highlights are
"Down 4 Whateva" by Nuttin NYCe, "Turn
it Up" by Raja Nee, "Croove On," by levin
Campbell, and Souls Of Mischief's impish
hip hop track, "Get the Girl, Grab the
Money and Run." Fach of them boast the
catchy quality of a high school anthem, and
yet it's that same youthful energy and rhyth
mic power that propels the momentum of
the entire album.
R& B tracks like "1 Can Go Deep," by Silk
and the remix of' Stroke You Up" by Chang
ing Faces, with their smooth vocals and
loin-stirring lyrics usher in an erotic dimen
sion that the kids can't quite provide. So if
your dance party has been solo up to this
point, henceforth it would be wise to double
up.... It you know what I mean.
All Inn and no propaganda would make
"Shame" a very unbalanced boy. So artists
like Oruani/.ed Konfusion are brought on

the scene to restore that balance and let ya'll
know that, while partying is fine, the world
is still one very messed-up place.
Keenan Ivory Wayans certainly knew
what he was doing when he brought this

particular group of
artists together to
comment his flick.

The resulting soundtrack is young, hip, and
full of flavor.
