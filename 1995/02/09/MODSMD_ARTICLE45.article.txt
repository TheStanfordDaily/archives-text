# Butterglory memorable
## 
### 
When it comes to musical influences, there's a fine line be
tween subtle reference and straight imitation. Stationed on that
line are Matt and Debby of Butterglory, churning out precious
chunks of pop that are engaging, soothing, fun and familiar.
Intentional or not, with comfortably loose arrangements,
some slacker-ish disappointment and Matt's sarcastic-yet-sin
cere vocals, Butterglory's got all the main ingredients to be tup
notch Pavement rip-offs.
Fortunately, they can't be — they are too clear, unique and
un Pavement. Butterglory, cares so much about their music that
you can feel the butterflies in their stomachs as they sing.
This nervous mix of freshness and familiarity decorates all ot
"(Tumble" in a way that's intimate, original and irresistible.
"Waiting on theCiuns," the album s opener, is a peppy and play-

"Crumble"
Butterglory

tul charge of
loopy bass and
buzzing guitar.
Perhaps more
rousing is "Our
(Proud) Mas-

cot, a dizzying
musical foot-race in which Debby sings, "1 11 just pass you by,"
just as the song does.
The album's slower numbers, with a more-deliberate
bounce, are just as fun as the last ones. "( actus" is endearingly
awkward, and "Peasants, Kings" offers an affecting dose ot sad
hopefulness and lazy beauty.
Throughout this 15-track set, Butterglory rarely fails to be
warmly personal and relentlessly catchy. Matt and Debby's
borrowed" sounds are so unique and enjoyable that the results
•ire pure Butterglory.
