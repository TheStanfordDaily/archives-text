# "Boys" soundtrack gives good taste of female artists
## 
### 
Men, step back —
this music definitely
puts boys on the side.
Featuring some of the
most talented women

in music today, the soundtrack to "Boys on the Side" — the
new flick Marring Whoopie Goldberg, Mary-Louise Parker
and Drew Barrymore — is a wonderful compilation of fe
male artists.
Musicians brought together for this soundtrack include

Bonnie Raitt, Melissa Etheridge,
Sheryl ('row, the Indigo (iirls, Ste
vie Nicks, the Pretenders, the (Iran
berries, Annie Lennox, Sarah
McLachlan, loan Armstrong, loan
Armatrading and Jonell Mosser.
Actress Whoopi Goldberg even

sings a rendition of the Traveling
Wilburies classic "You Got It."
While most of the music on the album is new, some of the
singles are previous releases. These are clearly the best tracks
of the compilation, which is unfortunate. The rest, even the
song by Sheryl Grow, one of the music scene's finest new

artists, sounds more like
tracks obviously written
for a movie soundtrack
than songs incorporated
into the soundtrack.
Almost all the tracks
are covers. While this may
be a statement about
women reinterpreting
what was formerly
claimed by men, the dy
namic feel of the album
suffers because of it.
Bonnie Raitt, for in
stance, covers "You Got It"
twice in addition to Gold
berg's version. The first
rendition is almost identi
cal to the original, yet
without the emotion of
Roy Orbison's almost-cry-

"Boys on the Side"
Various artists

I
ing vocals. The second
cover mimics also the
first, rather than recre
ating it. The only twist
is a swinging country

sound that turns this love ballad into a line-dance tune. You
can almost hear the stomping of cowboy boots in the back
ground.
While the music is by no means bad, one expects more
from these artists than we are offered here. Perhaps this is

because the artists conceived, wrote
and recorded the songs separately
rather than collectively. Or perhaps
it comes from the fact that with a
title like "Boys on the Side" you can
not help but get a Bette Midler feel to
the music.

If you're in the mood for slow,
country-influenced sentimental music by some of the great
est vocalists in music, then head for this compilation. But if
you want to hear these artists really shine, then stick to their
original albums where no one is featured "on the side."
