"The Sweetest Days"
Vanessa Williams

Few celebrities have experienced
the highs and lows of Vanessa
Williams' career and lived to tell the
tale. From Miss America in 1983 to
scandalous Playboy model the follow
ing year, Williams dug a career-dam
aging ditch from which few superstars
— no matter how publicly adored —
could hope to emerge. Vet by generat
ing three successful albums and land
ing the lead in the current Broadway
production of "Kiss of the Spider
woman," Williams has achieved an
undeniably miraculous resurrection.
Her latest album, "The Sweetest
Days," arrives three years after the re
lease of "The Comfort Zone,"
Williams' second album which
spawned the Grammy-winning single
"Save the Best for Last." "Days" is not
her best effort, but it certainly won't
be Williams' last. Her rich voice and
the widely varied musical styles save
this album from mediocrity.
The collaborative efforts of multi
ple artists are the album's biggest
strength — and weakness. While the
creators' professionalism comes
through clearly, the echo of past works
resonates in the new songs as well.
The title track of "The Sweetest
Days" was written and produced by
the same team that did "Save the Best
for Last," and bears their collective
signature. Except for lyrics and reor
ganization of the same notes, the two
songs are remarkably similar.
Babyface produces two cuts, both
of which conceal the full quality of
Williams' voice. "Betcha Never" has a
Gloria Estefan-like Cuban touch,
while "You Can't Run" sends vibes
reminiscent ofSade.
Sting does a surprise guest perfor
mance in "Sister Moon," a song he
originally wrote and recorded. The
background music is far more typical
of his style than her more generic ap
proach, but the female interpretation
of the song offers an interesting twist.
Even more twisted is the inclusion
of an electric guitar in "Higher
Ground." The suppressed energy of
the guitar struggles against Williams'
slow, sultry ballad, creating an acci
dental intra-song combat.
Williams claims co-writing credits
for one song on the album, "Fllamen
ta 1," a tribute to jazz singer Ella
Fitzgerald. However, it's clear from
this effort that Williams' true talent
resides in her voice rather than her
pen.
Williams is not alone in her will
ingness to borrow from other artists.
But "The Sweetest Days" would be a
little sweeter if the credits read "by
Vanessa Williams and friends."

"The Beatles Live at the BBC"
The Beatles

Plenty of Beatles compilations have been
released since the group recorded its last
album, "Abbey Road," in 1969.
Like most greatest-hits albums, this in
cludes some of the artists' very best songs.
By contrast, Apple Records' 'The Beatles
Live at the BBC," might at first glance be
stamped "for serious collectors only."
The album's 69 tracks feature recordings
made between 1962 and 1965, when the band
played live on broadcast radio. And while clas
sic songs like "Love Me Do" and "Can't Buy
Me Love" are included, many of the tracks are
previously unreleased songs such as a cover of
Chuck Berry's 1958 hit "Johnny BGoode."
Even so, saying that the album holds
meaning only for the serious Beatles collector
would be an injustice. The album's tracks
bring together the Beatles' early popular
recordings in a spectacular fashion.
But the collections' brilliance does not stop
with song selection. The album's producers
went even further to make the album a true
masterpiece. Rather than cuttingout the ban
ter between the Beatles and the radio show's
announcer, the album incorporates John,
Paul, (leorge and Ringo talking, laughing and
telling jokes — capturing the essence ot the
radio recordings.
This combination ol unreleased tracks,
hits and running commentary by the band
members makes the album both easy to listen
to and unforgettable.
Despite the fact that the Beatles broke up
more than 25 years ago, the album resurrects
the band in both song and words. Even
though most listeners haven't heard many of
the tracks, the newness of the unreleased
songs only adds to the album's vitality.

"River Otis"
Dead Hot Workshop

Recently found in the dusty desert of Ari
zona, Dead Hot Workshop has captured the
plaguing age-old issue of real life in America
in their new album, "River Otis."
A new sound of country blasts and rolls
from the speakers. But this album is not an
other disc of songs by a man with his six
string twanging out a sad, sad tune about a
dead dog or a woman who just walked out
the door.
Rather, "River Otis" contains the eclectic
sounds of grunge and hard rock that break
up its Western motif. With this new combi
nation of old musical genres, Brent Babb and
Steve Larson jam on their electric guitars but
do not get carried away to the point of hard
rock head-banging.
Dead Hot Workshop uses actual talent in
their music writing, utilizing various tech
niques to convince the listener of their mes
sage. Changing dynamics, the domination of
different genres, and the use of positive si
lence kick the message into the listener's ears.
A melancholy Brent Babb pushes the

words out of his mouth to describe his view
of life in the United States. Biting with cyni
cism, lyrics like: "We're accepting this for lib
erty/. . ./ (lan we blame this on our govern
ment/ lust little men lacking in integrity/
America's asleep in front of their TV/ Watch
ing 'Who's the Boss,' " comment on the pa
thetic and inactive life of some Americans. In
the same mood, the title of the song, "Rise of
Decline," attempts to puncture the egos of
American politicians.

As cynicism and criticism permeate all
songs, "257" ends the album with a good
snap of sarcasm true to the tone of "River
Otis." The last line heard drives the critique
home: "Never get tired of living in the USA."
A collection of six songs that ends too
soon (an KP just over 20 minutes), "River
Otis" has brought an old idea back to life in a
new sound. Dead Hot Workshop wrestles
with American society and wins.

"The Sweetest Days"
Vanessa Williams

Few celebrities have experienced
the highs and lows of Vanessa
Williams' career and lived to tell the
tale. From Miss America in 1983 to
scandalous Playboy model the follow
ing year, Williams dug a career-dam
aging ditch from which few superstars
— no matter how publicly adored —
could hope to emerge. Vet by generat
ing three successful albums and land
ing the lead in the current Broadway
production of "Kiss of the Spider
woman," Williams has achieved an
undeniably miraculous resurrection.
Her latest album, "The Sweetest
Days," arrives three years after the re
lease of "The Comfort Zone,"
Williams' second album which
spawned the Grammy-winning single
"Save the Best for Last." "Days" is not
her best effort, but it certainly won't
be Williams' last. Her rich voice and
the widely varied musical styles save
this album from mediocrity.
The collaborative efforts of multi
ple artists are the album's biggest
strength — and weakness. While the
creators' professionalism comes
through clearly, the echo of past works
resonates in the new songs as well.
The title track of "The Sweetest
Days" was written and produced by
the same team that did "Save the Best
for Last," and bears their collective
signature. Except for lyrics and reor
ganization of the same notes, the two
songs are remarkably similar.
Babyface produces two cuts, both
of which conceal the full quality of
Williams' voice. "Betcha Never" has a
Gloria Estefan-like Cuban touch,
while "You Can't Run" sends vibes
reminiscent ofSade.
Sting does a surprise guest perfor
mance in "Sister Moon," a song he
originally wrote and recorded. The
background music is far more typical
of his style than her more generic ap
proach, but the female interpretation
of the song offers an interesting twist.
Even more twisted is the inclusion
of an electric guitar in "Higher
Ground." The suppressed energy of
the guitar struggles against Williams'
slow, sultry ballad, creating an acci
dental intra-song combat.
Williams claims co-writing credits
for one song on the album, "Fllamen
ta 1," a tribute to jazz singer Ella
Fitzgerald. However, it's clear from
this effort that Williams' true talent
resides in her voice rather than her
pen.
Williams is not alone in her will
ingness to borrow from other artists.
But "The Sweetest Days" would be a
little sweeter if the credits read "by
Vanessa Williams and friends."

"The Beatles Live at the BBC"
The Beatles

Plenty of Beatles compilations have been
released since the group recorded its last
album, "Abbey Road," in 1969.
Like most greatest-hits albums, this in
cludes some of the artists' very best songs.
By contrast, Apple Records' 'The Beatles
Live at the BBC," might at first glance be
stamped "for serious collectors only."
The album's 69 tracks feature recordings
made between 1962 and 1965, when the band
played live on broadcast radio. And while clas
sic songs like "Love Me Do" and "Can't Buy
Me Love" are included, many of the tracks are
previously unreleased songs such as a cover of
Chuck Berry's 1958 hit "Johnny BGoode."
Even so, saying that the album holds
meaning only for the serious Beatles collector
would be an injustice. The album's tracks
bring together the Beatles' early popular
recordings in a spectacular fashion.
But the collections' brilliance does not stop
with song selection. The album's producers
went even further to make the album a true
masterpiece. Rather than cuttingout the ban
ter between the Beatles and the radio show's
announcer, the album incorporates John,
Paul, (leorge and Ringo talking, laughing and
telling jokes — capturing the essence ot the
radio recordings.
This combination ol unreleased tracks,
hits and running commentary by the band
members makes the album both easy to listen
to and unforgettable.
Despite the fact that the Beatles broke up
more than 25 years ago, the album resurrects
the band in both song and words. Even
though most listeners haven't heard many of
the tracks, the newness of the unreleased
songs only adds to the album's vitality.

"River Otis"
Dead Hot Workshop

Recently found in the dusty desert of Ari
zona, Dead Hot Workshop has captured the
plaguing age-old issue of real life in America
in their new album, "River Otis."
A new sound of country blasts and rolls
from the speakers. But this album is not an
other disc of songs by a man with his six
string twanging out a sad, sad tune about a
dead dog or a woman who just walked out
the door.
Rather, "River Otis" contains the eclectic
sounds of grunge and hard rock that break
up its Western motif. With this new combi
nation of old musical genres, Brent Babb and
Steve Larson jam on their electric guitars but
do not get carried away to the point of hard
rock head-banging.
Dead Hot Workshop uses actual talent in
their music writing, utilizing various tech
niques to convince the listener of their mes
sage. Changing dynamics, the domination of
different genres, and the use of positive si
lence kick the message into the listener's ears.
A melancholy Brent Babb pushes the

words out of his mouth to describe his view
of life in the United States. Biting with cyni
cism, lyrics like: "We're accepting this for lib
erty/. . ./ (lan we blame this on our govern
ment/ lust little men lacking in integrity/
America's asleep in front of their TV/ Watch
ing 'Who's the Boss,' " comment on the pa
thetic and inactive life of some Americans. In
the same mood, the title of the song, "Rise of
Decline," attempts to puncture the egos of
American politicians.

As cynicism and criticism permeate all
songs, "257" ends the album with a good
snap of sarcasm true to the tone of "River
Otis." The last line heard drives the critique
home: "Never get tired of living in the USA."
A collection of six songs that ends too
soon (an KP just over 20 minutes), "River
Otis" has brought an old idea back to life in a
new sound. Dead Hot Workshop wrestles
with American society and wins.
