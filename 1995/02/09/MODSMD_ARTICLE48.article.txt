Bad Company
"Bad Company" is a bad movie that
ostensibly tries to furnish us with a
semi-apocalyptic picture of a post
cold war world in which private in
dustry dominates and motivates in
dividuals to use corruption to pro
mote self-interest.. .
This summation undoubtedly gives
more credit to this Damian Harris
creation than is warranted. Ar
guably, Harris never manages to
come anywhere close to that effort.
"Bad Company," co-starring Lau
rence Fishburne and Ellen Barkin,
unravels so unconvincingly that this
near-apocalyptic vision is entirely di
luted.
Before Sunrise
This flick about a one-night stand in
Vienna is, well, nice. That's it. No
lascivious pick-up lines. No hyper
kinky sex scenes. No über-breasts.
No extra-wet willies. Just sensible
dialogue. And that's what makes
"Before Sunrise" such a charming
endorphin rush.

Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is a goateed
American armed with a Eurail pass
and riddled with Euro-boredom.
When Celine (Julie Delpy), a lus
cious-lipped French student on her
return trip to Paris, sits down next to
him on the train, Jesse strikes up a
conversation. They immediately hit it
off. Then, Jesse makes his move.
He asks Celine to postpone her trip
to Paris and embark on a sponta
neous one-day tour of Vienna with
him before he returns to the States.
Director Richard Linklater ("Slack
er," "Dazed and Confused") follows
the couple as they wander in Vien
na. For 24 hours, Jesse and Celine
paint the town fuschia.
"Before Sunrise" is a tender exposi
tion of how a chance encounter
blossoms into romance. It is a hum
ble relationship flick that, fortunate
ly, lacks gut-wrenching melodrama
and air-brushed glamour. Rather, it
is thick with honesty... like a near
life experience.
Death and the Maiden
Nothing attempted by Roman
Polanski in recent memory — "Fran
tic," "Bitter Moon" — quite prepares
one for the sheer suspense-ridden
mastery of his latest film, "Death and
the Maiden." Artfully tempered with
the psychology of human conflict
and provocative questions about the
delivery of justice, the adaptation of
Chilean Ariel Dorfman's heralded
play starring Sigourney Weaver and
Ben Kingsley breathes life into the
buried ghosts of a diabolical political
order.
Confined largely to the interiors of
the Escobars' home and spanning a
time period of no more than nine
hours over one night, "Death and
the Maiden" is made to rely purely
on the strength of its three actors,
the quality of Dorfman's script, and
Polanski's once-undisputed pen
chant for relentless cinematic ten
sion. Thanks to Polanski's timely re
covery of form, "Repulsion" and

"Chinatown" have finally found a
worthy successor.
Immortal Beloved
Shortly after Ludwig van
Beethoven's death, a cryptic letter
was found among his possessions.
Addressed to a woman — known
only as "Immortal Beloved" — the
letter became the impetus for one of
history's great romantic mysteries.
Who, among the many women
Beethoven loved, was his one true
love?
Bernard Rose's "Immortal Beloved"
ponders this question with its own
fictitious supposition of events.
When Beethoven's secretary Anton
(Jeroen Krabb6) tries to settle his
friend's affairs after his death, he
discovers the letter and Beethoven's
last will and testament, leaving all
his possessions to the mysterious
"Immortal Beloved." Determined to
honor Beethoven's final wishes,
Anton travels far and wide, visiting
Beethoven's many love interests.
The film's plot unravels as each
woman tells her tale, each revealing
a new side to the mercurial maestro.
The Last Klezmer
Seventy-year-old Leopold Koslows
ki lost his mother, father and brother
when the Nazis invaded Poland dur
ing World War 11. What he didn't lose
was his love of music — inherited
from his family and the Jewish tradi
tions of Eastern Europe.
In Yale Strom's magnificent docu
mentary, "The Last Klezmer," music
is the most potent language with
which Koslowski speaks. The story
of one Holocaust survivor becomes
the story of cultural survival.
Legends of the Fall
Based on Jim Harrison's novella,
"Legends of the Fall" is a tale of
three brothers split apart by — yes,
you guessed it — a woman.
The brothers are, from eldest to
youngest, Alfred (Aidan Quinn), Tris

tan (Brad Pitt) and Samuel (Henry
Thomas). Despite their different na
tures and their different looks (who
in their right mind would think Brad
Pitt and Aidan Quinn were related?),
the brothers form a close-knit family,
headed by the indomitable and
brash Colonel Ludlow (Anthony
Hopkins). Family ties begin to crum
ble, however, when Samuel brings
home his new fiancee Susannah
(Julia Ormond).
Murder in the first
Alcatraz. We all know it as a major
tourist attraction in San Francisco,
but less than 30 years ago it was
home to the meanest, toughest
cons in the country. Based on the
true story of Henry Young (Kevin
Bacon), an inmate at Alcatraz who
suffered horrific tortures at the
hands of the prison system, Marc
Rocco's "Murder in the First" is a
half-hearted attempt at a courtroom
drama.
"Murder" could have succeeded
had the script been less trite and
less predictable. Young's story is
tragic and compelling, but cheap
platitudes like, "I don't need a
lawyer. I need a friend" are distract
ing.
"Murder in the First" lacks the chem
istry and tension needed to make
the film work. The nauseating
scenes of brutality leave the theater
with you, but there is not much else
to be remembered.
Nobody's Fool
"Nobody's Fool," stars, features,
promotes, centers and focuses on
Paul Newman. The movie doesn't
really have a plot, nor does it pre
tend to; it just follows the life of Paul
Newman (Sully) as he runs into vari
ous different situations in his small
town.
Not to say that "Nobody's Fool," is
boring. The film features convincing
funny, and sometimes touching per
formances from Jessica Tandy in

her last role ever (as Mrs. Beryl,
Sully's landlord), Bruce Willis (as
Sully's boss, Carl) and Melanie Grif
fith (as Toby, Carl's wife and Sully's
love interest).
"Nobody's Fool's" major failing is its
predictability. The movie is as in
sipid as a sitcom, although, thank
fully, it lacks laugh tracks. However,
the viewer's instinctual knowledge
of what is going to happen (or per
haps it is conditioned by a million
similar movies) makes "Nobody's
Fool" incredibly easy to watch — it is
a pleasant film for those having
brain dead days and die hard Paul
Newman fans.
Queen Margot
At times brutal, occasionally
poignant, but never at any point
more than a heartbeat away from its
willful streak of romanticism, Patrice
Ch6reau's film is further testimony
to the French flair for the sweeping
period epic.
The most fascinating relationship in
thelso-minute existentialist soap
opera is never the torrid, but ulti
mately conventionally-structured li
aison between Margot (Isabelle Ad
jani) and her lover La Mole (Vincent
Perez). The pre-arranged political
marriage between Catholic Margot
and Protestant Henri de Navarre
(Daniel Auteuil) is never about love
in traditional terms, yet a basic de
cency — unfazed by adultery on
both sides and blood-soaked family
strife — pervades to entrench the
pair in mutual loyalty.
Gutsy, bawdy and always pulsating
with life — thanks to the energetic
cinematography of Oscar-winning
Philippe Roussellot — this is one un
dead retelling of history which may
catch the uninitiated off guard. One
may choose to take offense at the
film's liberties with factual accuracy
and frequently gory depictions of
physical and political violence. Or
one can be very grateful to the
French.
Bad Company

of what is going to happen (or per
haps it is conditioned by a million
similar movies) makes "Nobody's
Fool" incredibly easy to watch — it is
a pleasant film for those having
brain dead days and die hard Paul
Newman fans.
Queen Margot
At times brutal, occasionally
poignant, but never at any point
more than a heartbeat away from its
willful streak of romanticism, Patrice
Ch6reau's film is further testimony
to the French flair for the sweeping
period epic.
The most fascinating relationship in
thelso-minute existentialist soap
opera is never the torrid, but ulti
mately conventionally-structured li
aison between Margot (Isabelle Ad
jani) and her lover La Mole (Vincent
Perez). The pre-arranged political
marriage between Catholic Margot
and Protestant Henri de Navarre
(Daniel Auteuil) is never about love
in traditional terms, yet a basic de
cency — unfazed by adultery on
both sides and blood-soaked family
strife — pervades to entrench the
pair in mutual loyalty.
Gutsy, bawdy and always pulsating
with life — thanks to the energetic
cinematography of Oscar-winning
Philippe Roussellot — this is one un
dead retelling of history which may
catch the uninitiated off guard. One
may choose to take offense at the
film's liberties with factual accuracy
and frequently gory depictions of
physical and political violence. Or
one can be very grateful to the
French.
Bad Company
"Bad Company" is a bad movie that
ostensibly tries to furnish us with a
semi-apocalyptic picture of a post
cold war world in which private in
dustry dominates and motivates in
dividuals to use corruption to pro
mote self-interest.. .
This summation undoubtedly gives
more credit to this Damian Harris
creation than is warranted. Ar
guably, Harris never manages to
come anywhere close to that effort.
"Bad Company," co-starring Lau
rence Fishburne and Ellen Barkin,
unravels so unconvincingly that this
near-apocalyptic vision is entirely di
luted.
Before Sunrise
This flick about a one-night stand in
Vienna is, well, nice. That's it. No
lascivious pick-up lines. No hyper
kinky sex scenes. No über-breasts.
No extra-wet willies. Just sensible
dialogue. And that's what makes
"Before Sunrise" such a charming
endorphin rush.

Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is a goateed
American armed with a Eurail pass
and riddled with Euro-boredom.
When Celine (Julie Delpy), a lus
cious-lipped French student on her
return trip to Paris, sits down next to
him on the train, Jesse strikes up a
conversation. They immediately hit it
off. Then, Jesse makes his move.
He asks Celine to postpone her trip
to Paris and embark on a sponta
neous one-day tour of Vienna with
him before he returns to the States.
Director Richard Linklater ("Slack
er," "Dazed and Confused") follows
the couple as they wander in Vien
na. For 24 hours, Jesse and Celine
paint the town fuschia.
"Before Sunrise" is a tender exposi
tion of how a chance encounter
blossoms into romance. It is a hum
ble relationship flick that, fortunate
ly, lacks gut-wrenching melodrama
and air-brushed glamour. Rather, it
is thick with honesty... like a near
life experience.
Death and the Maiden
Nothing attempted by Roman
Polanski in recent memory — "Fran
tic," "Bitter Moon" — quite prepares
one for the sheer suspense-ridden
mastery of his latest film, "Death and
the Maiden." Artfully tempered with
the psychology of human conflict
and provocative questions about the
delivery of justice, the adaptation of
Chilean Ariel Dorfman's heralded
play starring Sigourney Weaver and
Ben Kingsley breathes life into the
buried ghosts of a diabolical political
order.
Confined largely to the interiors of
the Escobars' home and spanning a
time period of no more than nine
hours over one night, "Death and
the Maiden" is made to rely purely
on the strength of its three actors,
the quality of Dorfman's script, and
Polanski's once-undisputed pen
chant for relentless cinematic ten
sion. Thanks to Polanski's timely re
covery of form, "Repulsion" and

"Chinatown" have finally found a
worthy successor.
Immortal Beloved
Shortly after Ludwig van
Beethoven's death, a cryptic letter
was found among his possessions.
Addressed to a woman — known
only as "Immortal Beloved" — the
letter became the impetus for one of
history's great romantic mysteries.
Who, among the many women
Beethoven loved, was his one true
love?
Bernard Rose's "Immortal Beloved"
ponders this question with its own
fictitious supposition of events.
When Beethoven's secretary Anton
(Jeroen Krabb6) tries to settle his
friend's affairs after his death, he
discovers the letter and Beethoven's
last will and testament, leaving all
his possessions to the mysterious
"Immortal Beloved." Determined to
honor Beethoven's final wishes,
Anton travels far and wide, visiting
Beethoven's many love interests.
The film's plot unravels as each
woman tells her tale, each revealing
a new side to the mercurial maestro.
The Last Klezmer
Seventy-year-old Leopold Koslows
ki lost his mother, father and brother
when the Nazis invaded Poland dur
ing World War 11. What he didn't lose
was his love of music — inherited
from his family and the Jewish tradi
tions of Eastern Europe.
In Yale Strom's magnificent docu
mentary, "The Last Klezmer," music
is the most potent language with
which Koslowski speaks. The story
of one Holocaust survivor becomes
the story of cultural survival.
Legends of the Fall
Based on Jim Harrison's novella,
"Legends of the Fall" is a tale of
three brothers split apart by — yes,
you guessed it — a woman.
The brothers are, from eldest to
youngest, Alfred (Aidan Quinn), Tris

tan (Brad Pitt) and Samuel (Henry
Thomas). Despite their different na
tures and their different looks (who
in their right mind would think Brad
Pitt and Aidan Quinn were related?),
the brothers form a close-knit family,
headed by the indomitable and
brash Colonel Ludlow (Anthony
Hopkins). Family ties begin to crum
ble, however, when Samuel brings
home his new fiancee Susannah
(Julia Ormond).
Murder in the first
Alcatraz. We all know it as a major
tourist attraction in San Francisco,
but less than 30 years ago it was
home to the meanest, toughest
cons in the country. Based on the
true story of Henry Young (Kevin
Bacon), an inmate at Alcatraz who
suffered horrific tortures at the
hands of the prison system, Marc
Rocco's "Murder in the First" is a
half-hearted attempt at a courtroom
drama.
"Murder" could have succeeded
had the script been less trite and
less predictable. Young's story is
tragic and compelling, but cheap
platitudes like, "I don't need a
lawyer. I need a friend" are distract
ing.
"Murder in the First" lacks the chem
istry and tension needed to make
the film work. The nauseating
scenes of brutality leave the theater
with you, but there is not much else
to be remembered.
Nobody's Fool
"Nobody's Fool," stars, features,
promotes, centers and focuses on
Paul Newman. The movie doesn't
really have a plot, nor does it pre
tend to; it just follows the life of Paul
Newman (Sully) as he runs into vari
ous different situations in his small
town.
Not to say that "Nobody's Fool," is
boring. The film features convincing
funny, and sometimes touching per
formances from Jessica Tandy in

her last role ever (as Mrs. Beryl,
Sully's landlord), Bruce Willis (as
Sully's boss, Carl) and Melanie Grif
fith (as Toby, Carl's wife and Sully's
love interest).
"Nobody's Fool's" major failing is its
predictability. The movie is as in
sipid as a sitcom, although, thank
fully, it lacks laugh tracks. However,
the viewer's instinctual knowledge
of what is going to happen (or per
haps it is conditioned by a million
similar movies) makes "Nobody's
Fool" incredibly easy to watch — it is
a pleasant film for those having
brain dead days and die hard Paul
Newman fans.
Queen Margot
At times brutal, occasionally
poignant, but never at any point

thelso-minute existentialist soap
