# Ethnic centers wrap up plans
## Centers making spending decisions on $200,000 grant 
### Martin L. Yeung Contributing writer 
After five months of consideration, Stanford's ethnic
centers will soon finalize how a $200,000 University
grant they received last September will be spent.
Chris Clarke, assistant director of El Centra Chicano,
said the center will be consolidating its findings into a re
port on how it intends to spend its money by the end of
February.
"We have many ideas in the planning stage," Clarke
said. "We are just wrapping up the information-gather
ing phase and hope to pull all the ideas into a plan by the
end of this month."
The grant — distributed to each of the four ethnic

centers in $25,000 per year installments and guaranteed
for two years — is intended to pay for programs designed
to increase recruitment and retention of undergraduate
and graduate minority students.
Clarke said plans under consideration T *ange from de
veloping programs designed to increase student-profes
sor interaction to creating outreach and support groups
for Latino and Chicano students already on campus. All
these plans are geared toward attracting more Latino
and Chicano applicants to Stanford, Clarke said.
"We are planning on increasing our recruitment ef
forts during Stanford Admit Weekend and the minority
graduate weekend by providing partial salary support for
minority student coordinators," said
Benny Shendo, assistant dean and
director of the American Indian Pro
gram Office. He added the Native
American Cultural Center's plan to
spend the money is almost complete.
Additionally, Shendo said, "we're
collaborating with the American
Indian Science and Engineering
Society to sponsor a 'College Day' for
Bay Area middle and high school
students so they can gain exposure
to a [research 1 university atmo
sphere."
The money comes as welcome
relief to the centers, who spent last
year in a state of turmoil. Ethnic
centers were rocked by rumors of
minority center budget cuts,
widespread campus protests and the
resignations of Black Community
Services Center acting director Bar
bara Smith and Assistant Director
Shaun McAlmont.
Blair Bowman, interim director
of the BCSC, said the center is
preparing to present its list of poten
tial grant-funded projects to the
dean of students by the end of
February.
"Small portions have been spent
on tutors and academic coordina
tors, but the driving purpose of the
grant was for the recruitment of
minority graduate and undergradu
ate students to Stanford," Bowman
said, adding that he is excited over
new pilot recruitment programs.
"We plan to develop a black com
munity resource library, an honor
roll to honor the academic achieve
ments of African Americans at Stan
ford and increase academic support

at the center for African Ameri
cans," Bowman said.
In a statement, Asst Dean of
Students Richard Yuen said the
Asian-American Activities Center is
allocating funds for its Asian Inter
active Mentoring program. Yuen
said he also wants to increase the
center's financial and logistical sup
port to encourage Asian students to
enroll in Humanities and Sciences
graduate programs.
With the relatively small number
of Asian doctoral students in the
humanities, the center needs to pro
vide more social support and oppor
tunities for networking, he said.
The bonus funding helped the
Native American Cultural Center by
freeing time normally used for
fundraising to devote to program
planning, Shendo said.
"Currently, we are in negotia
tions with Dartmouth College... we
hope to develop an exchange pro
gram similar to the one we have now
with Howard University," Shendo
said in a statement.
Ethnic center administrators are
being particularly cautious with the
unexpected grant since budgets are
tight and they do not want to dupli
cate existing services.
"Twenty-five thousand dollars
goes really fast, and when we sub
mitted the request, the ideas we had
were really broad," Clarke said.
The research was to make sure
there was no overlap with programs
offered at the Career Planning and
Placement Center or Undergradu
ate Advising Center, Clarke said.
"I'm being very careful with the
money," said Bowman. "I want to
say at the end of two years that we
made a significant difference in the
retention rate of African-American
students."
