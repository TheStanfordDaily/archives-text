# Midterm canceled after copies given out early
## 
### Soumya V. Raman Contributing writer 
Students in "Computer Networks:
Architectures and Protocols," Comput
er Science 244 A, are getting what most
students can only dream about at this
time of the quarter — their midterm
was canceled last night due to concerns
over leaked exam questions.
Some Stanford Instructional Televi
sion Network coordinators distributed

the exam ahead of time, said Craig Par
tridge, the course's instructor.
The exam was sent in a sealed enve
lope to all SITN sites with instructions
not to give out the questions until 2:45
p.m. today — the time of the regular in
class exam, he said.
The network's students, who take
classes by television from places such as
Hewlett Packard and other Bay Area
companies, are expected to do all the as
signments and tests that a regular stu

dent does. Each company site has a coor
dinator who monitors assignments,
handouts and tests.
"The SITN coordinators goofed,"
Partridge said, adding that the ques
tions were mistakenly given away by at
least two SITN sites in the Bay Area. At
one site, the coordinator thought the
exams were supposed to be given out
yesterday, while at another site the
exams were just given away as hand
outs, he said.

"They obviously didn't follow the
rules," Partridge said.
SITN staff declined to comment on
the mistake.
Partridge said he learned about the
leak when a SITN student called him at
sp.m. yesterday and said he had already
taken the midterm. Another student
called to say that the midterm had been
sitting on his desk all day, Partridge
said. This happened at two of the
larger computer manufacturers in
the area, he said.
The problem was particularly
annoying, Partridge said, because
the SITN students' convenience
was specifically taken into consid
eration — they were given the
choice of taking the exams at their
work places or at Stanford.
Partridge has been frantically
trying to reach the 225 students
who are enrolled in the course —

60 of whom are SITN students —
by posting messages in news
groups and sending an e-mail mes
sage to all enrollees.
"This is not a joke," is the first
sentence of the message, which
ends with a reassuring "This is no
fake." Partridge said he was wor
ried students would not believe the
message because of a similar inci
dent at another university, where
a student broke into a professor's
e-mail account and sent a similar,
fake message to fellow students.
"This is great," said Choon Tay,
a graduate student in the class. "I
was planning to study tonight.
Now I don't have to."
