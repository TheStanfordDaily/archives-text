## Simpson lawyer talks about jury selection 
### Kyung Lee 
Attributing the make-up of the jury in the O.J.
Simpson trial to some surprising factors, Gerald
Uelmen — a visiting law professor who is a member
of the Simpson defense team — spoke at the law
school yesterday about jury selection in the highly
publicized case.
Uelmen said that Simpson has Rodney King, Los
Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti, California
Supreme Court Justice Stanley Mosk and Judge
Lance Ito to thank for the ethnically diverse jury of
eight African Americans, two Latinos, one Native
American and one Caucasian.
King's well-publicized police brutality case per
suaded the district attorney to hold the Simpson
case downtown, rather than in Santa Monica, Uel
men said.
"The King case showed the importance of venue
to jury composition," Uelmen said. "The trial in
Simi Valley, for example, resulted in an acquittal,
and the trial held in the federal district court result
ed in a conviction.
"The DA didn't want to change the venue to
Santa Monica and risk being accused of gerryman
dering the locale," he added.
Uelmen attributed the favorable jury composi-

tion to Garcetti for another rea
son as well, saying that Garcetti's
decision not to pursue the death
penalty increased the number of
minority jurors.
"If a prospective juror says
that he is against the death
penalty, then he is excused," Uel
men said. "Since most minorities
are against the death penalty, we
could have lost a substantial
number of minorities."
Uelmen praised Judge Lance
Ito for providing extensive 150-
page jury questionnaires and for
excusing prospective jurors based
on merely potential — not neces
sarily proven — bias.
"Most judges would not excuse
a prospective juror unless he
directly admitted that he was
actually biased," he said.
Uelmen stressed the key role
of peremptory challenges — the
lawyer's right to challenge his
opponent's choice of a prospective
juror. Mosk's past ruling in Peo
ple vs. Wheeler contributed to the

overall fairness in the case, he
said.
"Mosk ruled that lawyers can't
exercise peremptory challenges in
a discriminatory manner," Uel
men said. "In the Simpson case,
eight of the 10 peremptory chal
lenges on the prosecution's side
were aimed towards blacks and
each time, because of Mosk's rul
ing, the prosecution had to come
up with a reason other than race."

Uelman

The ruling, a major disadvan
tage for the prosecution, acted as
a "two-edged sword" because the
defense also could not challenge
prospective white jurors simply
on the basis of race, Uelmen said.
Simpson's defense team
opposed the sequestering of
jurors, Uelmen said, but because
of the extensive television and
tabloid coverage, they later sup

ported it. He warned his audience
of falling for tabloid journalism,
saying that "bad journalism
drives out the good."
"When I saw the cover of
National Enquirer, with the
bruised and battered face of
Nicole Brown Simpson on it and
then read in the corner that this
was a computer simulation," he
said, "I asked myself, 'Who would
ever have thought that the
Enquirer would sink to the level
of Time [Magazine]?' "
Uelmen, former dean of Santa
Clara Law School, has worked on
Marlon Brando's son Christian's
highly publicized case, and has
spent his life bridging "the gap
between concept and theory,"
Assoc. Law Prof. Kim Taylor
said Thompson.
After Taylor-Thompson intro
duced Uelmen as a member of
Simpson's "Dream Team," Uel
men said that the prosecution
also has its own "Dream Team."
"They're bringing in people to
testify about O.J. Simpson's
dreams," he said.
Uelmen added that he has
been dreaming about Ito. "I have
Judge Ito withdrawal," he said.
