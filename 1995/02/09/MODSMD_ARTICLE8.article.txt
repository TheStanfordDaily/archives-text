Behavioral science researchers
didn't have to look too far for an
intriguing case study last Wednes
day.
Impersonating a Food and
Drug Administration officer, a
woman allegedly stole food from
the Center for the Advanced
Study for Behavioral Sciences —
located across from the Stanford
Golf Course.
"The woman was availing her
self of items and placing them in a
box," said Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer. "She took some
Greek pastries, a seven-pound
ham, a frozen cheesecake, 12
pieces of bacon, some pasta shells
and two one-pound cans of gua
camole."
Shannon Greene, the center's
cook, had seen the suspect hang
ing around the building and
counting windows. "I assumed
she was a building inspector or a
person from janitorial services,"
she said.
"I walked outside to get some ice
from the freezers located there,
and there was this woman who had
a box full groceries that I recog
nized as my food," Greene said.
When Greene asked her what she
was doing, the suspect handed her
a form.
"She said that someone had got
ten sick from the food here, and
that the FDA was conducting an
investigation," Greene said.
The suspect told Greene to call
the FDA number on the form. "She
didn't seem very official, but I got
flustered when I saw FDA written
on the form," she said. "A cook's
worst nightmare is for someone to
get sick from their food."
Greene then asked if the suspect
would wait and talk to Greene's*
supervisor. "She said she would,

but that she wanted to finish
putting the food in her car,"
Greene said.
The suspect then quickly fled
the scene in her car with about
$100 worth of food.
A police officer saw the alleged
thief driving towards Menlo Park
right afler she fled, Niemeyer said.
"She stared at him with a guilty
look on her face, but the officer had
no way of knowing what had just
happened," he said.
Police are searching for a 5-foot
-6 white female in her 30s, of slim
build with black or dark brown
hair. She was wearing a gray hood
ed sweatshirt with "Polo" written
on it.
The suspect was driving a late
-1960s or early-1970s model full
sized American car, which was
either brown, beige or tan.
"My assumption is that it was
someone who is homeless and has
some problems getting food for
themselves," said Jane Kolmodin,
business officer at the center. "It
was very weird."
