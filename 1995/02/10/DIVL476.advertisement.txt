You should be proud of your college record. You saw a window
of opportunity and you took advantage of it, with hard work,
determination, and—finally—success. And your timing couldn't
be better, because right now LSI Logic is poised for a similar
opportunity—a perfect convergence of our new technologies
and market demands.
A decade ago we pioneered ASK 1 technology—a
semiconductor technology that allows electronics manufacturers
to design their own integrated circuits. Since then, we've led the
ASIC industry to another level —system-level integration. Our
new technology allows our Designers to put a complete system
on a single chip...and our S(X)K (1.5 million gate technology)
process provides the means to manufacture it.
But we can't continue to lead the industry alone—anil that's
where you come in. Our success has created challenging
engineering opportunities for you in the following areas:
• Bieim l/mm Bcsiit
• Ficii Bisien
• SotiMM
