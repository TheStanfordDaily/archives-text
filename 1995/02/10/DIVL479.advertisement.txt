To all volume 207 editors and writers —
The first week is always the hardest, and now it's over. Thanks for all the hard work
and long hours each of you has put in.
To keep you inspired over the next five issues, remember that we'll have our first
happy hour of the volume one week from today. The theme of the happy hour, as mysteri
ous as it sounds, is, "Let's Paint The Daily Red."
Cheesy as hell? Sure. But just try to guess what it means...
— Thanks again, Andy.
