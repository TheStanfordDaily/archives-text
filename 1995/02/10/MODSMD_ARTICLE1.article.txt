Applications to Stanford's top-ranked
Graduate School of Business are projected
to reach 6,000-7,000 this year â€” a 50 per
cent increase over last year.
After the first two deadlines, applica
tions total 4,561, compared to 2,700 at

this time last year, said Marie Mookini, di
rector of admissions for the Business
School.
Given the nationwide trend toward in
creased applications, Mookini said that
she believes the rise is due to strong feel
ings about the desirability of an MBA.
"A lot of the top-10 business schools
also experienced a rise," Mookini said.

"Business Week's article about the value
of an MBA encouraged people to think
about an MBA after several years of nega
tive press."
Economic pressures have also con
tributed to the rise, Mookini said. "The
MBA is being seen as a positive invest-
ment," she said. "Investment
banks are downsizing and as the
economy worsens, people go back
to school to make themselves more
attractive [to employersl."
However, Business School stu
dent David Zinman said he
believes the increase in applica
tions is due to the higher satisfac
tion that a career in business
brings.
"Why would so many people
continue to apply to law school,
when they have to spend three
years studying law and then prac
ticing it,"he asked. "You can get
an MBA in two years, while having
fun and then enjoying your career
[afterward]."

Mookini said that she attributes
the increase in Business School
applications to better recruitment.
"We expanded our recruitment
efforts," Mookini said. "We visit
ed many places. We held informa
tion sessions in many cities. We
got out and spread the Stanford
cheer."
Mookini also said the work of
international students, members
of ethnic minority groups and
Admit Day and Phone-a-thon coor
dinators was significant.
An easier application process
also contributed to the increase,
Mookini said. "We decreased the
number of essays to two from
four," she said. "It's more user
friendly."
Mookini said that a better pub
lic image for Stanford further
helped recruitment efforts. She
noted in particular a segment

about Stanford on "Good Morning
America."
However, Mookini said the rise
in applications may have some
negative side-effects. Higher selec
tivity may discourage some stu
dents on the borderline from
applying next year.
"Intimidating as it is now, when
one out of 10 students is admitted
[now], it will be worse [in the
futurel," she said.
The impact would primarily be
felt among underrepresented
groups such as women, Mookini
said.
Zinman, however, said that he
thought there would be little
impact. "Last year, Stanford was
already the most difficult school to
get into," he said. "The fact that it
goes from 10 percent [acceptance
rate] to six percent will not change
anyone's mind."
