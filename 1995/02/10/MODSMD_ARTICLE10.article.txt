# Parents fill classes today to kick the annual visiting weekend
## 
### Ben Sussman Contributing writer 
Students walking into a lecture hall this
afternoon may be surprised at what they
see.
Parents. Lots of them.
More than 825 parents and family mem
bers are expected to converge on Stanford
for the annual Parents' Weekend, far sur
passing last year's total of 700.
According to Judy Pace, an administra
tive associate in the Office of Development,
this increase in parent participation stems
from several changes in the Parents' Week

end format — in particular the decision to
move the weekend from its previous date in
October.
In addition, parents will now have the
chance to see how their students spend the
day, both in class and in their residences.
The weekend begins this morning at
10:30 a.m. with an address by University
President Gerhard Casper in Memorial
Auditorium.
After lunch, parents will be able to take
part in "Classes without Quizzes," a new
addition to the Parents' Weekend lineup.
This informal series of lectures by Stan
ford professors covers topics ranging from

ancient Greek theater to undergraduate
calculus.
"It sounds like a great idea to let parents
know what ftheir] students hear on a day
to-day basis in their classes," said History
Prof. Stephen Haber, who will be giving a
lecture on the"The Origins of the Modern
Mexican Revolution and Its Aftermath."
The lectures will be given at 2:15 p.m.
and then repeated at 3:15 p.m., allowing
parents to attend two different classes.
At 4:30 p.m., parents are invited to what
Pace calls "a very informal reception" at
their htudents' residences, another new
feature of this year's weekend.

"A lot of the learning at Stanford occurs
in the dorm," said Sue Harvey, a resident
fellow in Larkin. "It's good for the parents
to get a feel for the community in which
their sons and daughters spend most of
their lives."
Tomorrow's activities include a 10 a.m.
address and question and answer session
with Vice Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation Ramon Saldfvar and Dean and Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds.
Pace explained that one problem with
last year's fall quarter weekend was a
scheduling conflict with a football frame

played the same weekend.
"The winter quarter [datel eliminates a
lot of those problems," she said.
It also solves some other problems for
freshman parents, who make up more than
70 percent of this year's participants.
Last year's program fell "too close to
Orientation for [freshman] parents to
afford," Pace explained.
1 lowever, as in previous years, parents
attending this year's Parents' Weekend
have to pay $22 per person, with a maxi
mum of $60 per family. These fees, said
Pace, will pay for the setup, cleanup and
printing costs associated with the weekend.
