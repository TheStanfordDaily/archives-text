# Scientists find leukemia antibody

WASHINGTON (AP) - Researchers
experimenting with mice have created a
cancer "smart bomb" that attacks and
kills leukemia cells without harming nor
mal cells. The technique may be tested on
humans this summer.
Dr. F. M. Uckun of the University of
Minnesota, Minneapolis, said yesterday
the "smart bomb" is actually an antibody
that will attach to a receptor molecule
found only on the surface of leukemia
cells.
"The antibody is the missile," said
Uckun, and hooked to the missile is the
payload — a chemical that actually kills
the leukemia cell.
"Normal tissue is not affected," he
said. "Only the leukemia cells are going to
die."
Uckun, first author of a study appear
ing today in the journal Science, said the
same "smart bomb" technique for the tar

geted delivery of a killing chemical can
also be used for some cancers of the
breast, ovaries and brain.
In the study, Uckun and his team
injected human leukemia cancer cells into
laboratory mice that have no immune sys
tem. The cancer, called B-cell precursor
leukemia, is the most common form of
childhood cancer and the second most
common form of acute leukemia in adults.
All the untreated mice died within 61
days; all the mice treated with the "smart
bomb" lived for more than 120 days.
Later studies on the treated mice showed
that 99.999 percent of the leukemia cells
were killed.
Other leukemia-infected mice received
chemotherapy of the type now used on
humans. Some of the drugs were effec
tive, but none matched the "smart
bomb," said Uckun.
He said the findings suggest a treat

ment that included cycles of first the
drugs and then the "smart bomb" could
be very effective against leukemia.
843 teamed with another chemical
already has been approved for experi
mental human use, said Uckun. His
group now plans to seek Food and Drug
Administration approval to link 843 with
genistein and test the drug on human
leukemia patients. Uckun said clinical
trials of the therapy should start this
summer.
Dr. Paul Gaynon, a leukemia
researcher at the University of Wisconsin,
Madison, said the study was significant
because it looked at why chemotherapy
often fails in leukemia and then found a
way to improve treatment success.
"Killing the first 99 percent of
leukemia cells is easy," said Gaynon.
"This may give us a way of getting that
last one percent."
