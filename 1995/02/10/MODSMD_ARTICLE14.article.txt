NEW YORK (AP) — Federal authori
ties yesterday charged a former AT&T
Corp. executive and 16 others in a far
flung scheme to exploit the telephone
company's takeover plans.
The participants allegedly used infor
mation from the executive to trade the
stock of potential AT&T acquisition tar
gets over a four-year period. Prosecutors
described the suspects as a web of
friends and family spanning five East
ern states.
"One of the problems in this area,
why you have recurring violations, is
that people are tempted by the ability to
make a lot of money with little risk,"
said John Sturc, a former enforcement
official at the Securities and Exchange
Commission, now a Washington-based
private securities lawyer.
Six people were charged in a federal

indictment and another two pleaded
guilty, the U.S. attorney's office in Man
hattan said. These eight people and nine
others were named in a civil securities
fraud action by the SEC, the federal
agency that polices the financial markets.
AT&T itself wasn't charged with any
wrongdoing and cooperated with the
investigation that led to the indictment.
Officials provided no explanation of
how the scheme was discovered. But the
action marked the most aggressive
crackdown on securities fraud since the
Wall Street scandals of the 1980s involv
ing notorius Wall Street speculator Ivan
Boesky, who made at least $50 million
through the illegal use of non-public tips
about impending corporate takeovers.
Officials said the 17-person ring was
masterminded by Charles Brumfield, a
former AT&T labor relations manager

at the company's Morristown, N.J.,
offices, who parlayed secret knowledge
of the company's takeover plans into
lucrative tips to friends and family to
make $2.6 million from stock purchases.
Federal law prohibits insider trading,
which gives an unfair advantage to peo
ple with secret information that could
affect a company's stock price. This
practice proliferated during the 1980s
era of takeovers that frequently drove
up the stock prices of target companies.
Six defendants were charged with
conspiracy to commit securities fraud,
fraud in connection with takeover
offers, wire fraud and obstruction in
connection with AT&T's takeover plans
between December 1988 and last year.
The companies targeted were Para
dyne, NCR Corp., Digital Microwave
Corp. and Teradata Corp.
