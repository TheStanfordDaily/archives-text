# Quayle drops '96 campaign

### 
WASHINGTON
(AP) — Hard
pressed to
attract the
money and tal
ent necessary
for a strong
campaign, for
mer Vice Presi
dent Dan

Quayle abruptly reversed course
yesterday and said he would not
seek the 1996 Republican presi
dential nomination.
Quayle's decision came less
than three weeks after he vowed
to campaign aggressively as a
voice for the conservative "unsi
lent majority" that he said was
appalled at the decline of the
family and the liberal bent of
the social welfare system.
In a statement, Quayle said
he was confident he could have
waged a winning campaign if he
had subjected himself to a gru
eling fund-raising schedule this
year. "However, we chose to
put our family first and to
forego the disruption to our
lives that a third straight
national campaign would cre
ate," he said.
Advisers, associates and
Republican operatives, howev
er, said it became clear as
Quayle geared up to run that
the fund-raising outlook was

bleak, and that he also was hav
ing a hard time convincing sea
soned campaign operatives to
sign on.
A new, front-loaded GOP pri
mary calendar has put a premi
um on early fund-raising, a diffi
cult process cited by several oth
ers who recently bowed out,
including fellow Bush adminis
tration alumni Jack Kemp and
Dick Cheney.
Quayle associates said his
recent health problems — hospi
talization for blood clots and
then to have his appendix
removed because of a benign
tumor — were not a factor. "He
is completely recovered," said
Quayle adviser Mark Goodin.
"He was extremely excited
and fired up about running a
campaign," said Goodin. "But
the financial aspect of it threw a
bucket of cold water on his
enthusiasm."
The decision leaves three def
inite Republican candidates:
Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole of Kansas, Sen. Phil
Gramm of Texas and former
Gov. Lamar Alexander of Ten
nessee. A handful of others are
contemplating runs, including
Sens. Richard Lugar of Indiana
and Arlen Specter of Pennsylva
nia, as well as 1992 Bush prima
ry challenger Patrick Buchanan.

A few GOP governors and Cali
fornia Rep. Bob Dornan also are
mulling the race.
Gramm, Dole and Alexander
have locked up most of the
party's major fund-raisers and
are busy courting GOP elected
officials and key-state activists.
Just yesterday, for example,
Dole met with New Hampshire
Gov. Stephen Merrill, an influ
ential GOP voice in the first pri
mary state.
Quayle made the decision late
Wednesday night — just hours
after telling reporters in Miami
he planned to file candidacy
papers later this month and for
mally announce his candidacy in
April.
Since leaving office with the
Bush administration, Quayle
has kept a relatively low profile
while living in Indiana and pur
suing business interests.
Many longtime advisers had
urged Quayle not to run, sug
gesting he stay active in busi
ness or perhaps run for gover
nor of Indiana as part of an
effort to rebuild his image. But
Quayle ignored their advice,
even after his health problems,
and on Jan. 21 delivered an
impassioned speech to an Indi
anapolis convention outlining
the themes of his planned cam
paign.
