Simpson officer testifies
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The most
gruesome photos yet of the bodies of
Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald
Goldman were the backdrop yesterday
as the first police officer on the scene
took the stand in the murder trial of
O.J. Simpson.
Simpson averted his eyes and a pros
ecutor warned the victims' relatives,
"You don't want to look," as the photos
of the bloody, crumpled bodies were
shown to the jury.
The testimony of Officer Robert
Riske offered new details that may
enable the defense to cast doubt on the
estimated time of the murders at Ms.
Simpson's condominium.
Among the details: A container of
Ben & Jerry's ice cream was melting in
the kitchen, and candles were burning
in Ms. Simpson's bathroom and the
tub was full, as if she had been plan
ning a candlelit bath when death came
to call.
But under prosecution questioning
designed to anticipate another Simpson
line of defense, Riske stressed that he
never stepped in the blood, that he
warned others not to tread on it and
that he didn't touch any evidence.
The defense has suggested that a
racist detective moved one of two bloody
gloves from the murder scene and plant
ed it at Simpson's estate. The defense
also claims police handled the evidence
so sloppily that it can't be trusted.
Apple sues two rivals
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - Apple
Computer Inc. yesterday sued industry
giants Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp.,
accusing them of stealing Apple multi
media software.
Apple added Intel and Microsoft to a
copyright infringement suit filed in

December against The San Francisco
Canyon Co., a small software develop
ment company that worked with Apple
on versions of its QuickTime product.
The suit alleges that critical code
from that Apple program was copied
and ended up in rival Microsoft soft
ware. It seeks an immediate stop to dis
tribution of Microsoft's competing
Video for Windows and unspecified
damages.
Apple's QuickTime software lets
computer users display high-quality
video on their screens. Apple has a ver
sion for users of its own Macintosh per
sonal computers and another, Quick-
Time for Windows, for the much larger
market of PCs with Microsoft's Win
dows operating software.
Internet arrest
DETROIT (AP) â€” A college student
was charged yesterday with posting
computer messages describing the bind
ing, rape, torture and murder of a
woman who used to be in his class.
"Torture is foreplay, rape is romance,
snuff (killing) is climax," prosecutors
say one of Jake Baker's messages read.
The 20-year-old student was charged
with the federal crime of transmitting a
threat to injure. He was jailed pending a
bond hearing today.
Baker, who was suspended from the
University of Michigan last week, told
reporters he was within his rights to
post the messages on the worldwide web
of computer networks called the Inter
net.
By posting the messages, other Inter
net users would have access to them.
"I haven't harmed anyone," he said
before he was led away. "I think it is a
violation of my First Amendment rights
and probably several other rights."
If convicted, Baker could be sen
tenced to up to five years in prison.
