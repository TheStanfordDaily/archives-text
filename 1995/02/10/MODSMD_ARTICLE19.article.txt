## Building class unity 
### 
Recently, the assu Sen
ate's Student Affairs Com
mittee addressed the issue
of fostering class unity through
special class-specific events. The
group has formed a subcommittee
called the Committee on Class
Events, which is in the process of
planning a sophomore semiformal
and an equivalent event for the
junior class; both will take place
later this year. Much like the
planned events for the senior
class, the group's goal is to foster
class unity and to give students a
feeling that they are a part of
Stanford history.
The ASSU may also expand the
student government to include
class officers. At Tuesday night's
senate meeting, a bill was
announced — it will be voted on
Feb. 21 — that would institute a
governing body to handle affairs of
each class. These officers could
then concentrate on their class's
specific needs.

These changes are long over
due. Residential Education is help
ful in fostering a sense of commu
nity in dorms with freshmen, but
many older students feel that they
lack sufficient opportunities to
meet and spend time with their
peers. With some organization,
class leaders could fill this void.
In addition, Stanford's national
rank has suffered recently because
of poor alumni satisfaction reflect
ed by a low donation rate. Some
attribute this problem to the lack
of connection to the University felt
by many graduates. Class activi
ties and leaders could help address
this problem, which would also
help the Development Office's bot
tom line.
The Student Affairs Committee
deserves credit for taking the ini
tiative to foster class unity. If they
succeed in planning popular and
successful events, they will have
done the students and the Univer
sity itself a great service.
