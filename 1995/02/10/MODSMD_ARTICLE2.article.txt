## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Contributing writer 
The ASSU committee charged with investigating
possible improprieties in Associated Students Consult
ing (ASC), the Ask Stanford newsletter and the Stu
dents' Alliance party met yesterday to consider the is
sues and to prepare for interviewing the people in
volved.
The group — consisting of undergraduate senators
Rupali Gandhi and Mark Cordoba, graduate senators
Donald Aingworth and Michael Bailey, and ASSU legal
advisor Jewell Hudson — was formed Jan. 31 in re
sponse to a report by ASSU Financial Manager Gabe
Lucas.
The report alleged that Steve Russell, an under
graduate senator and founder of Ask Stanford, mis
led the Publications Board regarding the publica
tion's true purpose and inappropriately used the re
sulting student funds in an election campaign.
The report also charged that Russell improperly
used his influence as business manager of the Stan
ford Directory and that Pub Board Chair Danny
Bressler behaved improperly in granting a fee ex
tension for Ask Stanford's fall-quarter funding.
The committee will also investigate inappropriate
conduct by the Council of Presidents, the role of the
Students' Alliance and possible violations of the Fun
damental Standard.
"In [Ask Stanford's] application [for funds], it says
that the purpose is to 'guide students through the
quagmire of student politics,' " Bailey said.
In actuality, he said, the newsletter contained arti
cles attacking the Balanced Funding Deal, which
would have reformed the ASSU special-fee system by
abolishing fee refunds and separat ing undergraduate
and graduate voting on the fees.
The committee will also study whether Russell used
his authority as business manager
the Stanford Directory to place the
ASC under the heading of the
ASSU, although the consulting
group is not a part of the ASSU,
Aingworth said.
Bailey said the committee
should also find out "who [ASC]
was doing business with and where
their offices were."
Aingworth said he hopes the
committee will investigate alleged
inappropriate conduct by the COP.
Undergraduate senator Andre
Vanier said COP members inter
viewed him about his role in Ask
Stanford.
"We want to know who was
involved and in what capacity and

was this an action by the COP or
was this a front for political
means," Aingworth said.
ASSU legal advisor Jewell Hud
son also said that Ask Stanford's
failure to include Stanford's copy
right notice is a violation of the Fun
damental Standard. However, she
admitted that the violation is minor.
Russell could not be reached for
comment last night.
At its next meeting on Feb. 16,
the committee will begin interview
ing the people involved. The list
includes Lucas, Bressler, Vanier,
Stanford Directory Editor Patricia
Lewis, Russell and COP member
Mork Murdock.
Although it will not allow those
outside the committee to ask
questions directly, the group
invites others to submit questions
to committee members, Aing
worth said.
