# Not a minor change
## 
### 
RESPONDING TO a recom
mendation from the Com
mission on Undergraduate
Education, the School of Humani
ties and Sciences may allow stu
dents to graduate with a minor as
early as 1997.
H&S Dean John Shoven is ask
ing all departments and programs
to formulate minor programs,
which would require the comple
tion of 25 to 30 units for each cho
sen area. Although still a proposal,
the concept seems to have
widespread support and should
pass the Faculty Senate without
any problems, according to Biology
Prof. Robert Simoni, the senate
chair.
This is a great idea that is long
overdue, and Stanford should try
to implement the option as soon as
possible. Many students in effect
already minor by taking several
classes in areas that interest them

outside their majors; an official
minor program in each depart
ment would give such students the
official recognition that they
deserve.
Minor programs would also pro
vide a good middle ground
between pursuing one major and
double-majoring. Some students
are forced to decide late in their
undergraduate careers between
writing an honors thesis and fin
ishing off the requirements for a
second major. The option to minor
would offer much-needed flexibili
ty â€” students would be able to
pick up recognition for work com
pleted in their second academic
interest and still would have
enough time left over for their
theses.
Stanford should act quickly on
this issue to improve academic
flexibility and to give students the
credit they deserve.
