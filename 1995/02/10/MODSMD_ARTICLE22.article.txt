## Queer — to be or not to be ? 
### 
Straights should care about
the civil rights of gays and les
bians, but all of us who support
the protection of sexual orientation
have been approaching it the wrong
way. We have tried to use concepts of
discrimination and equality, comparing
prejudice based on sexual orientation to
racism. This attempt is misguided.
We should instead advocate liberty
and freedom of expression, characteriz
ing sexual orientation as dissent. By
reorienting our thinking in this way,
we can envision a world that is more
just.
The moral and legal principles that
have developed in this country in
response to discrimination emphasize
and encourage conformity and similari
ty. An individual is entitled to the same
treatment only to the extent that he or
she fits an unspoken standard — of
straightness.
For gays and lesbians, bisexuals,
transsexuals, people born with ambigu
ous gender identities and anyone else
who is different, feels different, or is
perceived as different because of their
sexuality, the idealization of sameness
offers nothing. Protecting only same
ness allows homophobes to attack dif
ferences. It has been and remains an
unsuccessful strategy.
The equally developed and well
respected principles of free speech
focus on the controversial and the con
trary — minorities in another sense.
An individual is allowed to burn a flag,
publish pornography and exhort revo

lution — especially because he or she is
different.
For gays and lesbians — as well as
for straights — identity is bound to act
ing up and speaking out. Protecting dif
ference allows gays and lesbians,
among others, to live openly. Protect
ing difference gives lives content and
meaning. Protecting difference leads
beyond mere tolerance.
Free speech rejects sensitivity and
accepts offensiveness. As one of the
most important developments of mod
ern democracy, free speech doctrine
makes it clear that it is not enough to
be sensitive and sometimes necessary
to be offensive. For gays and lesbians,
sensitivity is an irony and offensiveness
a norm. One may be forced into sensi
tivity so as not to upset the children,
parents, relatives, friends and commu
nity, all of whom are offended by secret
knowledge shared openly.
Except in unusual situations, it is
not the conduct but the identity of gays
and lesbians that troubles society.
Gays and lesbians are rarely prosecut
ed under the vague charge of sodomy
but are often persecuted for their
statement that they are who they are.
Holding hands in public is symbolic.
Gay and lesbian speech is always
flaunting.
Change in theory produces conse
quences in practice. Understanding
homosexuality as discourse avoids the
problem of "essentialization," of reduc
ing gays and lesbians as human beings
to nothing more than the forbidden sex

acts that have come to characterize
them. The debate about whether homo
sexuality is a matter of nature or nur
ture, genetics or choice, remains inter
esting scientifically but becomes unim
portant ideologically. Homosexuality
may well be a "lifestyle," but then het
erosexuality is a "lifestyle," and to have
any meaningful relationship in our
post-modern era is an accomplishment,
regardless of gender.
A strong societal consensus to pro
tect gays and lesbians for their differ
ences would also protect them in their
sameness. Those gays and lesbians who
are libertarians, conservatives, Repub
licans, religious, closeted — they, too,
could conform to form diversity within
diversity.
Straights should care because homo
phobia is about the control of identities
and images, public and private; homo
phobia is about threats to power; homo
phobia is about individual and collec
tive anxieties about sexuality.
Straights should care because gays and
lesbians are part of them, related to
them, next to them. Straights should
care because gays and lesbians are like
and unlike them, as each of us is liked
and disliked.
