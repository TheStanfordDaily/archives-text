Med School has been subjected to undeserved criticism

AN ARTICLE IN Wednesday's
Daily cited the implementation of
a new curriculum focusing on
women's health care at Stanford's
School of Medicine. Although I am glad
that women's issues are gaining the
importance they deserve, I have
noticed continual criticism of the Medi
cal School's policies both while in the
hospital and in The Daily.
As a Caucasian, middle-class male
medical student, I expect some criti
cism for my opinions, since I am proba
bly not in the majority. What concerns
me is the negative press that the
School of Medicine has been subjected
to regarding women's health. It is quite
obvious that "just as a child isn't a
small adult, a woman isn't a female
man," which a quote in The Daily's
article from Ellie Segal, a Voluntary
Clinical Faculty professor. Any medical
student could tell you that the real
story is men are masculinized females.
Nevertheless, I think the point is moot.
At no time during my two years of
medical school have I been taught that
women are just "female men." I would

agree that Stanford is not perfect, but I
think that the School of Medicine has
been making a strong effort to present
women's health in the proper light. It
is unjustified to criticize the it to this
extent.
I agree that it is unfortunate that
research in women's health is lagging
behind research in men, but this is not
unique to Stanford and is by no means
encouraged here, as the article suggest
ed. I have been doing research in
endometrial and breast cancer for well
over four years, and I feel that my
interest in these issues reflects a
nationwide trend towards a growing
understanding of the importance of
women's health issues.
Medicine has been a field tradition
ally dominated by men, and I think
that it is unrealistic for one to expect
changes overnight. I would only offer
praise for Stanford's active role in forg
ing ahead in these murky waters.
In the article, Jo Dean Nicolette,
coordinator of the women's health cur
riculum, argued, "How come men don't
have to find funding to get coverage?"

This statement is simply inaccurate.
Regardless of whether one is research
ing an area unique to men or unique to
women , funding is always a struggle.
It is unjustified to claim that women's
health alone must struggle for funding.
Perhaps paramount to this issue is
the controversy within the Medical
School regarding lectures and text
books. The anatomy professors have
received much criticism because the
anatomy atlas (by Dr. Frank Netter)
and the course syllabus both "neglect
women." I don't think that it is Stan
ford's role to determine how an author
depicts anatomical drawings, nor do I
think that it is possible to change a
text in retrospect. The atlas includes
drawings that are over 40 years-old and
is the "essential" text for anatomy.
Realistically, men and women are
anatomically very similar, and Netter's
atlas does include adequate depiction of
male and female differences. In addi
tion, the anatomy professors have
worked very hard to rewrite the course
syllabus, for which they should be com
mended.

I do find it very disturbing, however,
that jokes against men do occur during
lectures and are met without resis
tance. During a genetics lecture, a
female professor placed a depiction of a
fake male chromosome on the over
head. The chromosome included the "I
love-my-TV-remote gene" and others
too derogatory to mention. Although I
was amused, I was disturbed that such
a scenario was OK. I don't think that
this is the way to solve the "women's
health" controversy. Why is male bash
ing acceptable any more than female
bashing would be?
I resent the light in which the Medi
cal School, and, indirectly, the male
medical students and professors, have
been portrayed. I think that Stanford
deserves much praise for its efforts in
this continual struggle. I also question
the atmosphere that reverse discrimi
nation creates within the profession I
would hope that future articles would
present a more balanced view of the
Medical School.
