## Hoopsters come up with mixed results against 'Zona Women handle 'Cats at home 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
Stanford 100

After the Stanford women's bas
ketball team lost to Oregon State
University, there remained only
one question to be resolved during
last night's game against Arizona.
How large would the margin of
victory be for the Cardinal?
As it turns out, the final score
was 100 for sixth-ranked Stanford
(18-2 overall, 9-1 in the Pacific 10
conference) and 72 for the Wildcats
(9-13, 4-6 in the Pac-10). The 28
point victory proved as bland as
could be.
When Arizona started the game
in a zone, the Cardinal countered by
busting seven threes. The Wildcats
then switched to player-to-player in
the second half and Stanford used
its height and size advantage to
score at will from inside.
Freethrow shooting problems
plagued the Cardinal, however.
Stanford made 13 of 23 shots for a
Shaq-like 56.5 percentage. Howev
er, not even the low percentage
troubled the Cardinal.
"I've never been one to worry
about our freethrows," said coach
Tara VanDerveer. "I know that
they're concentrating when they're
at the line.
"When we are not concentrating
on setting screens or running plays,
it bothers me more."
Stanford ran enough picks,
screens and cuts to free the shoot
ers. The Cardinal finished the game

making over 50 percent from the
floor, for the umpteenth time, end
ing at 54.8.
Sophomore point guard Jamila
Wideman, time after time, found
open Cardinal players to tally eight
assists. Senior guard Kate Paye
added five and three others racked
up four assists apiece. As a team,
Stanford helped out on 31 of 40 bas
kets. The total ties the team high for
assists this season.
VanDerveer, in her 300 th game
at Stanford, started a lineup that
harkened back to last year with
Kaplan, sophomore swingman Kate
Starbird, senior Rachel Hemmer,
Paye and Wideman. Hemmer began
quickly, christening the scoreboard
with a layup. Paye then hit a trey,
Starbird made a short jumper, and
Hemmer and Kaplan followed with
layups. A pair of threes and a jump
shot later, Stanford led by 10,19-9.
"We tried to play zone on them

early to take away their inside
game," said Arizona coach Joan
Bonvicini.
Starbird and Paye forced the
Wildcats to change. The two com
bined to make seven of 13 from
behind the arc during the first half
and convinced Bonvicini that things
were not working. At the intermis
sion, the Cardinal sat at a comfort
able 20 point margin, 51-31.
Paye shot only three pointers
during the first half. She made four
of seven for her 12 points while
Starbird varied her shot selection.
Starbird scored 16 in the half on six
of 10 from the floor. Wideman made
sure that the duo was in position to
make their shots, assisting on five of
their baskets.
In the second half, the inside
game took over. Kaplan and Hem
mer scored seven of the first nine
baskets to stake the Cardinal to a
69-40 lead. The 29-point advantage
would be the largest during the
game.
"When we've done well, it's
because of our depth, rebounding
and defense," said VanDerveer,
stating the obvious.

The bench played a role in
the game, once again, responsible
for 37 points. Redshirt freshman
Vanessa Nygaard tied a career high
with 11 points. Three other fresh
men, Heather Owen, Kristin Folkl
and Naomi Mulitauaopele, also
added to the victory scoring 11, nine
and six points respectively.
Freshman Olympia Scott, who
had started all 19 previous games,
was diagnosed with a possible stress
fracture and watched from the side
lines. She will be out for a minimum
of two weeks. Hemmer, who has
been battling back from injuries of
her own, started for the first time
this season. Until this year, Hem
mer, who finished with 10 points
and five rebounds, subbed only once
before during her sophomore sea
son.
Next up for the Cardinal is Ari
zona State. As with the game
against Arizona, Stanford will con
tinue to correct the mistakes
learned from the OSU game.
"I wish we could have done bet
ter [against Oregon State]," Van-
Derveer said. "But if it helps us in
the long term, it's not so bad."
