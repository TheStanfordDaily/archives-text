## Hoopsters come up with mixed results against 'Zona Women handle 'Cats at home 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
Stanford 100

After the Stanford women's bas
ketball team lost to Oregon State
University, there remained only
one question to be resolved during
last night's game against Arizona.
How large would the margin of
victory be for the Cardinal?
As it turns out, the final score
was 100 for sixth-ranked Stanford
(18-2 overall, 9-1 in the Pacific 10
conference) and 72 for the Wildcats
(9-13, 4-6 in the Pac-10). The 28
point victory proved as bland as
could be.
When Arizona started the game
in a zone, the Cardinal countered by
busting seven threes. The Wildcats
then switched to player-to-player in
the second half and Stanford used
its height and size advantage to
score at will from inside.
Freethrow shooting problems
plagued the Cardinal, however.
Stanford made 13 of 23 shots for a
Shaq-like 56.5 percentage. Howev
er, not even the low percentage
troubled the Cardinal.
"I've never been one to worry
about our freethrows," said coach
Tara VanDerveer. "I know that
they're concentrating when they're
at the line.
"When we are not concentrating
on setting screens or running plays,
it bothers me more."
Stanford ran enough picks,
screens and cuts to free the shoot
ers. The Cardinal finished the game
