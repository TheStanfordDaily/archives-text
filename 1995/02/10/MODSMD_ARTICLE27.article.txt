# Men fall short for the second time this year

Stanford 73
Arizona 84

TEMPE, Ariz. — The story goes a
little bit like this: a tough as nails
Stanford men's basketball team
faces a top-ten squad. They fight,
scrap and scrape to the bitter end,
stumble a bit along the way, come
back furiously, get within an inch of
winning, but ultimately fall just a
hair's breadth short.
It happened against Arizona ear
lier this season and it happened
against UCLA on the road. In last
night's rematch versus the Wild
cats, it was the same old story —
Stanford lost a tight one, much
tighter than the score would indi
cate, 73-84.
"I'm tired of losing these close
ones," said center Tim Young who
logged a career-high 20 points for
the 15th-ranked Cardinal (15-4
overall, 6-4 in the Pacific 10 confer
ence). "We came back against
UCLA and Arizona, but we want to
win. I think a lot of teams can beat
Oregon State and Washington, but
to beat Arizona and UCLA is what
we really want to accomplish. We
just need to come through."
It didn't happen last night,
though. The good news this time
around was that Arizona guard
Damon Stoudamire did not have 45
points like he did in the first game
against the Cardinal. The bad news
is the senior Wildcat still had 29
points, and ninth-ranked Arizona
(18-4,8-2 in the Pac-10) won again.
Adhering close to the story line,

Stanford opened the game slowly
and found themselves in a sizable
hole. Arizona forward Ray Owes
opened the game doing his Damon
Stoudamire impression, scoring
seven quick points in the first five
minutes both from inside and out.
Owes, another of the Wildcat's
senior leaders, finished strong with
22 points and a game-high 12
rebounds.
Owes and Stoudamire combined
for 20 of Arizona's first 24 points. A
fast-break lay-in by Stoudamire
with 11:52 remaining in the first

half gave the Wildcats a 24-9 lead.
"We got off to a slow start," said
Cardinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We tried to warn a lot of
the kids who hadn't played in this
environment. We got backed off a
little bit, got out-physicaled, got
down big. There was a lot of ner
vous energy burning. We were a lit
tle tired. But we kept in it."
The Stanford squad was certain
ly floundering. Slowly but surely,
however, the Cardinal would crawl
