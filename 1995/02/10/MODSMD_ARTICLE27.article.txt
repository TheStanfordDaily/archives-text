Stanford 73
Arizona 84

TEMPE, Ariz. — The story goes a
little bit like this: a tough as nails
Stanford men's basketball team
faces a top-ten squad. They fight,
scrap and scrape to the bitter end,
stumble a bit along the way, come
back furiously, get within an inch of
winning, but ultimately fall just a
hair's breadth short.
It happened against Arizona ear
lier this season and it happened
against UCLA on the road. In last
night's rematch versus the Wild
cats, it was the same old story —
Stanford lost a tight one, much
tighter than the score would indi
cate, 73-84.
"I'm tired of losing these close
ones," said center Tim Young who
logged a career-high 20 points for
the 15th-ranked Cardinal (15-4
overall, 6-4 in the Pacific 10 confer
ence). "We came back against
UCLA and Arizona, but we want to
win. I think a lot of teams can beat
Oregon State and Washington, but
to beat Arizona and UCLA is what
we really want to accomplish. We
just need to come through."
It didn't happen last night,
though. The good news this time
around was that Arizona guard
Damon Stoudamire did not have 45
points like he did in the first game
against the Cardinal. The bad news
is the senior Wildcat still had 29
points, and ninth-ranked Arizona
(18-4,8-2 in the Pac-10) won again.
Adhering close to the story line,

Stanford opened the game slowly
and found themselves in a sizable
hole. Arizona forward Ray Owes
opened the game doing his Damon
Stoudamire impression, scoring
seven quick points in the first five
minutes both from inside and out.
Owes, another of the Wildcat's
senior leaders, finished strong with
22 points and a game-high 12
rebounds.
Owes and Stoudamire combined
for 20 of Arizona's first 24 points. A
fast-break lay-in by Stoudamire
with 11:52 remaining in the first

half gave the Wildcats a 24-9 lead.
"We got off to a slow start," said
Cardinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We tried to warn a lot of
the kids who hadn't played in this
environment. We got backed off a
little bit, got out-physicaled, got
down big. There was a lot of ner
vous energy burning. We were a lit
tle tired. But we kept in it."
The Stanford squad was certain
ly floundering. Slowly but surely,
however, the Cardinal would crawl

fell.
back up a hill that they have got
ten all too familiar with.
"This team plays with a lot of
heart," Young said. "It's hard for
us to give up because we're so
competitive and want to win so
bad. No lead's going to intimidate
us."
There were some twists, how
ever, in this game's story line.
Going against conventional wis
dom, the comeback run was not
sparked with three-pointers by
guard Dion Cross, and point
guard Brevin Knight was on the
bench most of the time.
In fact, while Knight had a
solid game with 11 points, nine
assists and five steals, Cross fin
ished with a season-low Five
points. The Wildcat defense, and
Arizona defensive stopper Reggie
Geary in particular, effectively
shutdown the Cardinal's leading
scorer who has also been strug
gling of late with nagging shoul
der and knee injuries.
"It was more the defense than
the shoulder," Cross said. "I think
they made it a point to not let me
have the ball. And when I did,
they only gave me tough shots. I
give a lot of credit to them. They
did what they wanted to do."
The unlikely heroes were
guard Warren Gravely, swingman
David Harbour, and center Bart
Lammersen who all came off the
bench and helped the Cardinal on
a 24-4 run.
"I have to give the guys that
came off of the bench a lot of cred
it," Knight said. "They came in
and did a great job, picking us up,
getting us back in the game. They
were the ones who really got us
back in the game."
Harbour's 15-foot jumper from
the right baseline tied the score at
26-26. And after a turnaround

jump shot by Arizona center Ben
Davis, Harbour's three-pointer,
off an assist from Gravely, gave
Stanford its first lead of the game.
In the first half, Stanford was 5-
of-6 from three-point land and
shot a scorching 58.1 percent
from the field.
The Cardinal would lead by as
many as five with key baskets
from Cross, forward Andy Pop
pink, and Young. Young sunk an
amazing lay-in off the glass while
at the same time being
fouled/crushed by both the 265-
pound Blair and 254-pound Wild
cat Ben Davis. Young's free throw
after being flattened by the com
bined 519 pounds of beef put the
Cardinal up by four. But
Stoudamire's hanging jumper at
the end of the half gave Stanford a
slim 43-41 halftime lead.
As the second half progressed,
the Cardinal would see its lead
evaporate against the blistering
Wildcats. With seven lead
changes, the two teams battled
furiously. Young hit several time
ly shots, including an 18-foot
jumper, that kept Stanford in it.
"I just got my confidence up
when I started getting my shots
down and got into a rhythm,"
Young said.
The Cardinal saw its last lead
at 69-67 when Harbour sunk a
free throw to convert a three
point play where he was tackled to
the hardwood while laying the
ball in from Knight's pass on the
fast break. Harbour finished with
20 points off the bench.
Wildcat Joe McLean's trey off
of a feed from Stoudamire put
Arizona up for good. Anytime, the
Cardinal breathed down Ari
zona's neck, Stoudamire (who
else?) would nail a clutch jumper.
"Stoudamire is just a great
player," Montgomery said. "He
probably had as much influence
on this game as he did last time
when he had 45."
Still, Stanford had its chances.

With just over a minute left and
down by only four, Knight
slapped Geary to send the 31 per
cent foul shooter to the foul line.
Knight, though, was whistled for
a questionable intentional foul,
giving the Wildcats both the two
shots and the ball which essential
ly put the game out of reach.
"It's the call I guess he (the ref
eree) had to make," Knight said.
"He thought that was the right
call."
Poor production at the charity
stripe from a usually surefire Car
dinal club that came into the
game leading the Pac-10 in free
throw shooting at 73.9 percent
also came back to haunt Stanford.
Both Harbour and Knight missed
key free throws down the stretch,
and the team converted just 5-of
-10 for the game.
In the end, Arizona simply out
played the Cardinal. Stanford was
held to just 36.1 percent from the
field and was out rebounded 26-
17 in the second half of the game.
"We didn't make many plays
down the stretch when we needed
to make them," Montgomery said.
"We miss some free throws that
keep you within one basket. We
don't rebound the ball on a miss
shot. And the next thing you
know, we're in a situation where
something bizarre would need to
happen for you to win."
Nothing bizarre happened.
In the pre-top-25 ranking days,
this would most certainly be con
sidered a moral victory. After all,
the Wildcats were 115-4 in the
McKale Center since 1987-88, and
the Cardinal did give them a run
for their money. In fact, this
would have been a downright
wonderful moral victory. But
that's only if the Cardinal still
believed in them. The fact is.
these days they don't.
"This is getting a little old,"
Poppink said.
He isn't the only one that's get
ting tired of these reruns.

shot a scorching 58.1 percent
from the field.
The Cardinal would lead by as
many as five with key baskets
from Cross, forward Andy Pop
pink, and Young. Young sunk an
amazing lay-in off the glass while
at the same time being
fouled/crushed by both the 265-
pound Blair and 254-pound Wild
cat Ben Davis. Young's free throw
after being flattened by the com
bined 519 pounds of beef put the
Cardinal up by four. But
Stoudamire's hanging jumper at
the end of the half gave Stanford a
slim 43-41 halftime lead.
As the second half progressed,
the Cardinal would see its lead
evaporate against the blistering
Wildcats. With seven lead
changes, the two teams battled
furiously. Young hit several time
ly shots, including an 18-foot
jumper, that kept Stanford in it.
"I just got my confidence up
when I started getting my shots
down and got into a rhythm,"
Young said.
The Cardinal saw its last lead
at 69-67 when Harbour sunk a
free throw to convert a three
point play where he was tackled to
the hardwood while laying the
ball in from Knight's pass on the
fast break. Harbour finished with
20 points off the bench.
Wildcat Joe McLean's trey off
of a feed from Stoudamire put
Arizona up for good. Anytime, the
Cardinal breathed down Ari
zona's neck, Stoudamire (who
else?) would nail a clutch jumper.
"Stoudamire is just a great
player," Montgomery said. "He
probably had as much influence
on this game as he did last time
when he had 45."
Still, Stanford had its chances.

With just over a minute left and
down by only four, Knight
slapped Geary to send the 31 per
cent foul shooter to the foul line.
Knight, though, was whistled for
a questionable intentional foul,
giving the Wildcats both the two
shots and the ball which essential
ly put the game out of reach.
"It's the call I guess he (the ref
eree) had to make," Knight said.
"He thought that was the right
call."
Poor production at the charity
stripe from a usually surefire Car
dinal club that came into the
game leading the Pac-10 in free
throw shooting at 73.9 percent
also came back to haunt Stanford.
Both Harbour and Knight missed
key free throws down the stretch,
and the team converted just 5-of
-10 for the game.
In the end, Arizona simply out
played the Cardinal. Stanford was
held to just 36.1 percent from the
field and was out rebounded 26-
17 in the second half of the game.
"We didn't make many plays
down the stretch when we needed
to make them," Montgomery said.
"We miss some free throws that
keep you within one basket. We
don't rebound the ball on a miss
shot. And the next thing you
know, we're in a situation where
something bizarre would need to
happen for you to win."
Nothing bizarre happened.
In the pre-top-25 ranking days,
this would most certainly be con
sidered a moral victory. After all,
the Wildcats were 115-4 in the
McKale Center since 1987-88, and
the Cardinal did give them a run
for their money. In fact, this
would have been a downright
wonderful moral victory. But
that's only if the Cardinal still
believed in them. The fact is.
these days they don't.
"This is getting a little old,"
Poppink said.
He isn't the only one that's get
ting tired of these reruns.

Stanford 73
Arizona 84

TEMPE, Ariz. — The story goes a
little bit like this: a tough as nails
Stanford men's basketball team
faces a top-ten squad. They fight,
scrap and scrape to the bitter end,
stumble a bit along the way, come
back furiously, get within an inch of
winning, but ultimately fall just a
hair's breadth short.
It happened against Arizona ear
lier this season and it happened
against UCLA on the road. In last
night's rematch versus the Wild
cats, it was the same old story —
Stanford lost a tight one, much
tighter than the score would indi
cate, 73-84.
"I'm tired of losing these close
ones," said center Tim Young who
logged a career-high 20 points for
the 15th-ranked Cardinal (15-4
overall, 6-4 in the Pacific 10 confer
ence). "We came back against
UCLA and Arizona, but we want to
win. I think a lot of teams can beat
Oregon State and Washington, but
to beat Arizona and UCLA is what
we really want to accomplish. We
just need to come through."
It didn't happen last night,
though. The good news this time
around was that Arizona guard
Damon Stoudamire did not have 45
points like he did in the first game
against the Cardinal. The bad news
is the senior Wildcat still had 29
points, and ninth-ranked Arizona
(18-4,8-2 in the Pac-10) won again.
Adhering close to the story line,

Stanford opened the game slowly
and found themselves in a sizable
hole. Arizona forward Ray Owes
opened the game doing his Damon
Stoudamire impression, scoring
seven quick points in the first five
minutes both from inside and out.
Owes, another of the Wildcat's
senior leaders, finished strong with
22 points and a game-high 12
rebounds.
Owes and Stoudamire combined
for 20 of Arizona's first 24 points. A
fast-break lay-in by Stoudamire
with 11:52 remaining in the first

half gave the Wildcats a 24-9 lead.
"We got off to a slow start," said
Cardinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We tried to warn a lot of
the kids who hadn't played in this
environment. We got backed off a
little bit, got out-physicaled, got
down big. There was a lot of ner
vous energy burning. We were a lit
tle tired. But we kept in it."
The Stanford squad was certain
ly floundering. Slowly but surely,
however, the Cardinal would crawl

back up a hill that they have got
ten all too familiar with.
"This team plays with a lot of
heart," Young said. "It's hard for
us to give up because we're so
competitive and want to win so
bad. No lead's going to intimidate
us."
There were some twists, how
ever, in this game's story line.
Going against conventional wis
dom, the comeback run was not
sparked with three-pointers by
guard Dion Cross, and point
guard Brevin Knight was on the
bench most of the time.
In fact, while Knight had a
solid game with 11 points, nine
assists and five steals, Cross fin
ished with a season-low Five
points. The Wildcat defense, and
Arizona defensive stopper Reggie
Geary in particular, effectively
shutdown the Cardinal's leading
scorer who has also been strug
gling of late with nagging shoul
der and knee injuries.
"It was more the defense than
the shoulder," Cross said. "I think
they made it a point to not let me
have the ball. And when I did,
they only gave me tough shots. I
give a lot of credit to them. They
did what they wanted to do."
The unlikely heroes were
guard Warren Gravely, swingman
David Harbour, and center Bart
Lammersen who all came off the
bench and helped the Cardinal on
a 24-4 run.
"I have to give the guys that
came off of the bench a lot of cred
it," Knight said. "They came in
and did a great job, picking us up,
getting us back in the game. They
were the ones who really got us
back in the game."
Harbour's 15-foot jumper from
the right baseline tied the score at
26-26. And after a turnaround

jump shot by Arizona center Ben
Davis, Harbour's three-pointer,
off an assist from Gravely, gave
Stanford its first lead of the game.
In the first half, Stanford was 5-
of-6 from three-point land and
shot a scorching 58.1 percent
from the field.
The Cardinal would lead by as
