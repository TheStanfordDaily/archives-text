# Nothing new involved with contest at Maples
## 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
Watching the Stanford women's basketball team
this season is very similar to watching how the San
Francisco 49ers rolled through their Super Bowl-win
ning season.
Every once in a while, the Cardinal women will
encounter a challenge, but in most games they have put
the contest out of reach by halftime.
Last night's 100-72 victory over the Arizona Wild
cats was a typical Stanford win in typical Stanford fash

ion.
The game began in usual Cardinal fashion, as sopho
more Kate Starbird and senior Kate Paye lit up the
Wildcats from the three-point line to open up an early
23-11 lead.
Starbird delivered a typical performance as she
poured in 22 points and dished out eight assists. Paye,
in her usual role, quietly added 12 points on four of
seven shooting from three point land.
Point guard sophomore Jamila Wideman also put on
a show the Maples spectators are
accustomed to seeing as she fin
ished with eight assists and only
three turnovers.
The Cardinal's depth proved to
be the key, as it is in most wins, as
four others (redshirt freshman
Vanessa Nygaard, senior Rachel
Hemmer, senior Anita Kaplan and
freshman Heather Owen) scored in
double digits.
Wildcat head coach Joan Bon
vicini could only add the usual
cliches when talking about Stan
ford's typical blow-out win.
"They just have so many
weapons," Bonvicini said. "I
thought Folkl did a nice job off the
bench, along with Heather Owen
and Vanessa Nygaard. They just
have so many players."
The praise did not stop there, as

the coach touched on all the typical
bases of the Cardinal's perfor
mance.
"They're a very good team, espe
cially at home and they played with
a lot of confidence tonight," Bon
vicini said. "They had a lot of peo
ple show up and play very, very
well. They're a very, very good
team."
It was a very, veiy typical press
conference.
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer was pleased, as usual, with
her team's performance and
offered up the typical praise and
criticism for her squad.
"I just thought, again, it was an
excellent team effort," VanDerveer
said. "I thought we got out running
and in the second half, even though
it wasn't reflected in the score, our
defense was much more aggressive.
"I think we got a little compla
cent with a 22- or 23-point lead in
the second half," VanDerveer
added. "But then we really finished
strong. I still think we need to con

tinue to work on our defense and
our rebounding."
As everything unfolded typical
ly, there was one atypical statistic
that might have caused Van-
Derveer to worry a bit. The Cardi
nal only shot 56 percent from the
foul line, very atypical of a team
that averages 70 percent.
However, VanDerveer remained
composed, as usual, when asked
about the team's foul shooting.
"I've never been one to worry
about our free throws," she said. "I
don't worry about our outside
shooting or our free throws. I'm
much more concerned about things
like our defense and our rebound
ing, which are effort-related
things."
The Cardinal will take on Ari
zona State this Saturday and will
most likely dispose of the Sun Dev
ils, again, in typical fashion. The
key is that when eveiything is said
and done, the Cardinal comes away
as an atypical team â€” namely,
national champions.
