# Baggers get ready for Bulldog attack
## 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Just a week after dropping
two of three games to Cal State-
Fullerton, the top-ranked Stan
ford baseball team will have a
shot at redemption against
another highly touted California
state school.
Fresno State (4-0) will travel
to Palo Alto to battle the Cardinal
(4-2) in a three game non-confer
ence series starting today at 2
p.m. All three games will be
played at Sunken Diamond, with
1 p.m. starts on Saturday and
Sunday.
"These weekend games are
really big games for us," said
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess. "They should give us a
good measuring stick of how we
stack up against some quality
teams. Fresno State is off to a
great start and they'll be tough to
beat."
The Bulldogs are two-time
defending Western Athletic Con
ference Champions and are com
ing off a three game sweep of Cal
ifornia last weekend. Fresno
State is looking to return to post
season play for the eighth
straight time and their team has
not lost much talent from last
year's 36-27 squad.
"Usually, we get hit pretty
hard by the league draft,"
said Fresno State head coach Bob
Bennett. "We expect to lose sev
eral of our top players — either
recruits or returning kids — each
year to the majors. It's nice to
know that, with a few exceptions,
we have everybody here that we
hoped would be here."
That includes sophomore left
handed pitcher Brendan Behn,
who will start for the Bulldogs
this afternoon against the Cardi

nal's ace, Dan Reed. Behn led
Fresno State with a 2.87 ERA in
1994 and looks to improve upon
those numbers in 1995.
"Brendan had some outstand
ing games last year," Bennett
said. "He showed flashes of bril
liance at times. With one year
under his belt that should make
him even tougher this year."
Reed has already made two
starts for Stanford in 1995, post
ing an opening day win against
St. Mary's before struggling
against a potent Cal State-Fuller
ton offense last Friday. Things
shouldn't get any easier today as
Reed must face a Fresno State
lineup which is averaging .311 as
a team in 1995.
No less than six Bulldogs are
hitting over .300 on the young
season, and Fresno State is scor
ing an average of eight runs per
game. Outfielder Josh Kaitfors
has been leading the charge, car
rying a whopping average of .462
into this afternoon's contest.
Senior Ryan Wood has also
been on a tear in 1995, batting
.412 while starting every game in
center field. Wood led the Bull
dogs in batting average (.320),
runs scored (60), hits (87) and
stolen bases (38) a year ago. He
has already been successful in
four of five attempted steals in
1995.
"No question, Ryan will get
things going with his speed,"
Bennett said. "He does the things
that need to be done for us to
score runs. He should be at or
near the top of the national lead
ers for stolen bases this season
with the amount we want him to
W( ,_ ft
run.
The Bulldogs have also gone
to the junior college ranks in the
offseason to acquire a couple of solid
pitchers. Robert Donnelly, a first
team Ail-American a year ago, post
ed a 12-1 record and a 1.86 earned
run average at Fresno City College.
David "Shorty" Farfan will also
make the transition to Division I, a
year after he posted a 0.97 ERA at
Laney College.
Fresno State — which has been

to the College World Series twice
since 1988 — has all of the ingredi
ents to make a run at the post-sea
son again in 1995 and would like
nothing better than to upset the
top-ranked Cardinal in the early
going. The Bulldogs also hope to
avenge Stanford's three-game
sweep in Fresno last year.
"Part of the responsibility of
being ranked so highly is that you
reality have to come to play every
day," said Stanford sophomore Tom
Reimers. "Teams will be looking to
beat you and if you don't put forth a
solid effort you'll come up short."

The Cardinal won the Pacific 10
Southern Division — rated by Base
ball America as the best conference
in the nation — despite playing just
.500 ball outside of the conference
in 1994. Stanford has already
shown that it won't give in as easily
in 1995, coming from behind three
times — including twice in its final
at-bat — to win.
"You can have a great offense
and still not be able to come from
behind," Marquess said. "We've
already been able to do that a few
times this year to pick up wins.
That's definitely a good sign."
