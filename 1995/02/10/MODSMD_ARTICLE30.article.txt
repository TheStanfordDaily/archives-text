# Sun Devils next opponent for Cardinal

TEMPE, Ariz.â€”Stanford head men's basketball
coach Mike Montgomery calls the current voyage in
Arizona "the toughest road trip in the Pac-10 in a long
time." A more suitable name for it would be The Road
Trip from Hell, and it continues tomorrow afternoon
as the 15th-ranked Cardinal (15-4 overall, 6-4 Pac-10)
travel to the University Activity Center to take on the
14th-ranked Arizona State Sun Devils (17-5 overall, 7-
3 Pac-10).
The inatch-up comes on the heels of a 73-84 defeat
against the ninth-ranked University of Arizona Wild

cats. There's little rest for the weary, though, as they
travel upstate now to face an equally formidable Sun
Devil squad. In fact, the Wildcats happen to be one of
the six ranked opponents Arizona State has defeated.
The Cardinal registered a 91-75 victory at Maples
Pavilion in the earlier meeting between the two clubs.
A 56-point, 63 percent field-goal shooting surge in the
second half keyed the victory. Stanford guards Dion
Cross and Brevin Knight combined for 43 points, and
sixth-man David Harbour came off the bench with 15
points.
Arizona State was led by stud center Mario Bennett
and high-flying forward Ron Riley who both had 17
points apiece. The Sun Devils also
implemented their trademark
press. Not much has changed
since then with coach Bill
Frieder's team, which is riding a
four-game winning streak.
"Arizona State is still the
same," said Montgomery. "They
rely on pressure to create oppor
tunites for them. They rely heavi
ly on going in to Bennett."
Stanford effectively neutral
ized both those elements the last
time around, and how Stanford
handles those two areas this time
could again determine the out
come of the game.
"We need to handle Arizona
State's pressure," Montgomery
said. "Brevin did a real nice job
last game of handling that pres
sure, but we need to make sure
we emphasize adjusting and get
ting enough spacing to get ever
body involved."
Knight did an excellent job in
pushing the ball up the court last
time. Now, he'll need to do it on
the road in front of a hostile

crowd that feeds off of Arizona
State's intense, high-pressure
defense. But to the cooly confi
dent Cardinal, handling the heat
tomorrow won't be too much dif
ferent.
"I think it'll be about the
same," said Harbour. "The ball
will be in Brevin's hands, and
Brevin's a human press breaker.
We just give him the ball. It'll be
him breaking the press. We'll
adjust if we face any problems."
Factor number two is All-Pac
-10 center Bennett, the heart and
soul of Arizona State. The six
foot-nine-inch, 230-pound junior
is averaging 17.4 points per game,
8 rebounds, and a Pac-10-leading
3.2 blocked shots. Against Stan
ford this season, he was restricted
to an average performance of 17
points and six boards.
"We did a reasonably good job
on Bennett last time and we need
to follow up and continue to try to
emphasize that aspect," Mont
gomery said. "Bennett has had
big games and they've gotten peo
ple into foul trouble by just giving
it in to Bennett."
Cardinal center Tim Young,
who had just six points and one
field goal against the Sun Devil

center, hopes to turn things
around a bit against Bennett.
"I'm going to try to take it
stronger against him because
before I was a Little too timid,"
Young said. "I want to be more
assertive on offense and put more
pressure on him and maybe get
some fouls on him. I'm just going
to take it to the basket."
While containing Bennett is a
necessity, at the same time Mont
gomery warns, "We also need to
make sure at the same time that
we get to [guard Isaac] Burton
and Riley who are their primary
perimeter shooters."
Riley, who can take it inside as
well, averages 15 points a game.
"Ice" Burton, the Sun Devils pre
mier defensive stopper who has
frustrated the likes of Jimmy
King, Damon Stoudamire and
Cameron Murray, contributes
14.6 points a game offensively.
Stanford's hands will be full,
but Knight has made it a point
that his team will do anything it
can to prevent a winless trip.
"We've made it a point to not
get swept on the road," Knight
said. "We're going to come out
and play hard Saturday because
we know that they are."
