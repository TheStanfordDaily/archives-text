Facing its toughest opponent of the season
yesterday afternoon, the No. 3 Cardinal
women's tennis squad (3-0) stepped up accord
ingly, taking all six singles matches in a 6-3
victory over the University of the Pacific (1-2)
at the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
The most intense match was No. 1 singles,
which p'tted freshmen Ania Bleszynski against
UOP senior Tracee Lee. Bleszynski started off
slowly, returning groundstrokes shallow
enough to allow Lee to keep her on the run;
this strategy guided Lee to a 3-2 lead.
The young Stanford standout then caught
fire, gaining both strength and momentum as
the set continued. Bleszynski burned Lee for
four straight games, taking the set 6-3. Lee
