Facing its toughest opponent of the season
yesterday afternoon, the No. 3 Cardinal
women's tennis squad (3-0) stepped up accord
ingly, taking all six singles matches in a 6-3
victory over the University of the Pacific (1-2)
at the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
The most intense match was No. 1 singles,
which p'tted freshmen Ania Bleszynski against
UOP senior Tracee Lee. Bleszynski started off
slowly, returning groundstrokes shallow
enough to allow Lee to keep her on the run;
this strategy guided Lee to a 3-2 lead.
The young Stanford standout then caught
fire, gaining both strength and momentum as
the set continued. Bleszynski burned Lee for
four straight games, taking the set 6-3. Lee

responded in the second set,
utilizing precision and accuracy
to spurt to a 5-2 lead. Refusing
to go under, Bleszynski fought
back to within 5-4 only to see
Lee answer her comeback call to
even the set score at one apiece.
"Even though I didn't quite
get the comeback, that run real
ly gave me a lot of confidence
going into that third set,"
Bleszynski said.
Bleszynski carried the
regained confidence and
momentum into the third and
final set. Groundstrokes of pin
point accuracy propelled
Bleszynski to a 6-4 third set
win, as she successfully defend
ed Lee's aggressive serve-and
volley tactics.
The other singles matches
saw Stanford jump all over
Pacific in the first set. Howev
er, the Tigers managed to hang
a little tougher in the second
set, picking up a couple of more
games than in the first.
Kim Shasby advanced to 3-0
on the season with a 6-1, 6-4
triumph over Katharina
Schlensker in the No. 2 singles
match. Freshmen Julie Scott
also won for the third straight
time 6-2, 6-4 over Bente Grina
in the No. 3 match.
Cardinal depth took over as
Stanford captured the fourth,
fifth and sixth matches, all in
straight sets. Amy Chiminello
(3-0) handed in a 6-0, 6-4 victo
ry over Tanya O'Neil. Wendy
Sacks and Emily Burt both
moved to 2-0 with 6-0, 6-3 and
6-2, 6-2 victories in the fourth
and fifth matches, respectively.
Despite dropping these first
six matches and allowing Stan
ford to clinch the day's event,
the Tigers stood tall in the dou
bles competition.

The No. 3 doubles squad
ended earlier than expected due
to an unfortunate knee injury
to Cardinal freshman Sophy
Woodhouse. She and Heidi Stal
la were forced to forfeit to
O'Neil and Sylvia Ta. Initial
reports qualify the injury as
damage to the anterior cruciate
ligament, although specifics
had not been determined.
Both No. 1 doubles, Bleszyn
ski and Katie Schlukebir, and
No. 2, Burt and Shasby,
dropped quick first sets.
Bleszynski and Schlukebir
answered back immediately
with a 6-0 set. The third set see
sawed back and forth until
Pacific's Lee and Mazsa Kuurna
had two opportunities to take
the match with breaks at 4-5
and 5-6, but Schlukebir and
Bleszynski held serve. Despite
the wasted chances, Pacific held
on in the tie-breaker to take the
set 4-6, 6-0, 6-7.
"I'm not upset with them,"
Brennan said. "They couldn't
get the job done today, but I
don't expect great things from
them just yet."
Burt and Shasby shook off a
tough tie-breaker loss in the
first set. Chasing lob after lob
from Schlensker and Grina, the
Cardinal forced a third set with
a 6-4 second set victory. Stan
ford looked as if it had the
match at 5-4 in the third set,
but the Tigers eventually man
aged to prevail 5-7.
"Second doubles just seemed
like one of those matches where
we were flat and they kept com
ing back," Brennan said. "The
doubles just didn't happen."
The three losses were the
first sets to be lost at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium this year
between both the men and
women squads. Brennan
refused to dwell on them, how
ever. "It goes down as a win
whether it's 9-0 or 5-4," he
said.
