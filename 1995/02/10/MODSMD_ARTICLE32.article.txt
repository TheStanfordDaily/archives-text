# Spikers over the Rainbows?

### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
In the war of men's volleyball, Stanford and
the University of Hawaii will wage a two-day
battle this weekend over first place in the
Pacific Division of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation. The engagement starts at
7 p.m. on Friday and continues at 5 p.m. Sat
urday in Burnham Pavilion.
The second-ranked Cardinal (5-1 overall, 2-
0 in the MPSF) won two league contests last
weekend against UC-San Diego and San Diego
State University. In crushing the San Diego
State Aztecs, Stanford played one of its best
matches yet this season, generating impres
sive statistics. Junior swing hitter Mike Lam
bert pounded down 39 kills and sophomore
opposite hitter Matt Fuerbringer added 27.
The team as a whole hit .464.
"We're coming off of a good match," said

freshman middle blocker Keenan Whitehurst,
"and we've had a good week of practice. Hope
fully, we can carry all this momentum into
this weekend's matches."
Stanford will need to capitalize on every
advantage to conquer the ninth-ranked Rain
bows (2-1, 2-0 in the MPSF). Hawaii's lone
loss came in a tough three game encounter
with No. 1 UCLA. One of the Rainbows' chief
weapons will be senior middle blocker Jason
Olive who leads the conference in both kills
average (.667) and blocking (2.60 per game).
In addition, Hawaii has acquired the services
of two key Israeli players.
"It's an interesting team," said coach
Ruben Nieves, "with a combination of foreign
and domestic players. Their best player, their
top hitter, is an internationally experienced
volleyball player from Israel named Yuval
Katz.
"Last year they had a nice blend of both

defense and offense; this year, they have many
returning players from that team and they are
also very much bolstered by their foreign play
___ W
ers.
Katz managed to put away 19 kills in only
two games versus Loyola Marymount Univer
sity earlier this season. Other than Katz, the
Rainbows also retain the services of one Aus
trian and one Australian player.
"You never know how teams with many
foreign players will play," Lambert said.
"They're unpredictable — you could have a
player listed as a freshman who is actually 26
from a foreign national team playing against
you."
Other than the advantage afforded by their
foreign personnel, Nieves maintains the Rain
bows can also pose a physical challenge
because all their players jump well.
The Cardinal haa not seen
Hawaii play yet this season so it is
unable to prepare a specific strate
gy for Friday's match. However,
Stanford does have intelligence on
one Rainbow weapon — four of the
six Rainbow starters jump-serve.
This is particularly threatening to
the Cardinal because the one chink
in its armor is serve-receive.
"We've been passing a lot of
jump serves in practice," White
hurst said. "Also, we've been work
ing on offense against jump serves.
For example, running quick sets
off of imperfect passes because
there just won't be as many good
passes."
Stanford will be bolstered by its

strong serve-reception perfor
mance against the Aztecs last
weekend, another big jump-serv
ing team.
"We definitely have to work on
passing," Lambert said. "If we can
pass well we'll be fine because we
have so much offense."
Stanford's goal for the weekend
is to dominate the Pacific Division
early on and set itself up as the
champion in anticipation of later
struggles to vie for the Final Four.
"This is a great opportunity for
us to establish ourselves as the
team to beat," Whitehurst said.
"By ending the weekend with a 4-0
record, we will have sole possession
of first place."
Nieves has similar aspirations
for the matches.
"We view this weekend as a real
opportunity to take charge of our
division," he said.
