In the war of men's volleyball, Stanford and
the University of Hawaii will wage a two-day
battle this weekend over first place in the
Pacific Division of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation. The engagement starts at
7 p.m. on Friday and continues at 5 p.m. Sat
urday in Burnham Pavilion.
The second-ranked Cardinal (5-1 overall, 2-
0 in the MPSF) won two league contests last
weekend against UC-San Diego and San Diego
State University. In crushing the San Diego
State Aztecs, Stanford played one of its best
matches yet this season, generating impres
sive statistics. Junior swing hitter Mike Lam
bert pounded down 39 kills and sophomore
opposite hitter Matt Fuerbringer added 27.
The team as a whole hit .464.
"We're coming off of a good match," said

freshman middle blocker Keenan Whitehurst,
"and we've had a good week of practice. Hope
fully, we can carry all this momentum into
this weekend's matches."
Stanford will need to capitalize on every
advantage to conquer the ninth-ranked Rain
bows (2-1, 2-0 in the MPSF). Hawaii's lone
loss came in a tough three game encounter
with No. 1 UCLA. One of the Rainbows' chief
weapons will be senior middle blocker Jason
Olive who leads the conference in both kills
average (.667) and blocking (2.60 per game).
In addition, Hawaii has acquired the services
of two key Israeli players.
"It's an interesting team," said coach
Ruben Nieves, "with a combination of foreign
and domestic players. Their best player, their
top hitter, is an internationally experienced
volleyball player from Israel named Yuval
Katz.
"Last year they had a nice blend of both

defense and offense; this year, they have many
returning players from that team and they are
also very much bolstered by their foreign play
___ W
ers.
Katz managed to put away 19 kills in only
two games versus Loyola Marymount Univer
sity earlier this season. Other than Katz, the
Rainbows also retain the services of one Aus
trian and one Australian player.
"You never know how teams with many
foreign players will play," Lambert said.
"They're unpredictable â€” you could have a
player listed as a freshman who is actually 26
from a foreign national team playing against
you."
Other than the advantage afforded by their
foreign personnel, Nieves maintains the Rain
bows can also pose a physical challenge
because all their players jump well.
