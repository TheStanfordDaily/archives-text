# Tennis vs. Miami, UNLV
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
The top-ranked Stanford
men's tennis team (3-0) will face
its toughest opposition of the year
so far when it takes on the Uni
versity of Nevada-Las Vegas (2-3)
today at 1:30 p.m. and No. 12
Miami (4-1) at noon Saturday.
"We've been looking forward
to this weekend ever since we first
set eyes on the schedule," said
Stanford's No. 6 singles player,
Ricky Becker.
The Running Rebels will be led
by No. 41 Roger Pettersson, the
1994 Big West Player of the Year.
In last year's 6-1 dual-match loss

to Stanford, Pettersson scored his
team's only victory of the day, a 6-
3, 6-1 drubbing of Robert Devens.
"I always fear UNLV" said
Stanford head coach Dick Gould.
"They have a good coach | Larry
Easley], many of whose pupils
I've had on my team."
Miami is led by the No. 1 sin
gles player in the nation, sopho
more Srdjan Muskatirovic of Bel
grade, Yugoslavia. He has strong
credentials as the winnner of the
National Clay Court Champi
onships in October in addition to
Ail-American honors as a fresh
man last season. The 6-foot, 4-
inch serve-and-volleyer also
defeated Stanford's Devens in the

first round of the 1994 NCAA
individual championships on his
way to a final-eight finish. And
before coming to Miami,
Muskatirovic won the European
Junior Championships.
The No. 1 singles matches
should garner even more atten
tion than usual as the sixth
ranked Jeff Salzenstein will have
his hands full with Pettersson
and Muskatirovic. Though Stan
ford's team captain won his
match easily last Wednesday
against San Jose State, he did not
play true to form following a
straight set loss to tour profes
sional Jonathan Stark in the
Sybase Open on Monday. But
Gould sees no reason to worry
about Salzenstein.
"I am a lot less concerned
about Jeff than Jeff is about Jeff,"
Gould said. "Sometimes I have
more confidence in him than he
does in himself."
Another international player
stars for the Hurricanes in the No.
2 singles slot. Junior Gil Kovalski
of Herzelia, Israel, is ranked 11th
in the country and won the Rolex
South Regional Championships
last November. According to
Miami head coach John Hammil,
"[Kovalskil has played some
matches where he would have
beaten anyone. .. .He has a huge
serve and volleys well."
This year the Hurricanes
defeated No. 18 Alabama-Birm
ingham, 5-2. Their only loss came
at the hands of No. 5 Pepperdine,
6-1. Saturday's meeting will be
the first between Stanford and
Miami since 1992, when the Car
dinal won 5-1. The Cardinal has
never lost in four previous meet
ings with the Hurricanes.
This year's Miami squad, how
ever, comes to the Stanford Ten
nis Stadium with upset potential.
The Cardinal has looked sluggish
against lesser opponents in its
first dual matches of the young
season, and will have to improve
its level of play if it wants to
remain undefeated after this
weekend.
"I think we'll be able to rise up
to the level of our new oppo
nents," Becker said.
A large crowd is expected for
Saturday's match, with all area
tennis club members guaranteed
free admission courtesy of Blue
Chalk Cafe.
