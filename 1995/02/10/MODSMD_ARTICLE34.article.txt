# Season finale for grapplers
## 
### Ratha Harntha Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestling team has one last cram
ming session before its season-ending exams. This
Sunday, the Cardinal grapplers will visit 13th
ranked Cal State Bakersfield in their season finale.
"It's one more midterm before the final," said
head coach Chris Horpel. "The [Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championship] and the NCAA championship
determines 80 percent of your grade."
Stanford (3-4 overall, 3-2 in the Pac-10) is coming
off a third place finish at the All-California tourna
ment last Saturday, in which Bakersfield did not
compete.
"Bakersfield is a real tough dual-meet team," said
junior co-captain Jimmy Aguirre. "There are going
to be some tough matches."
The Cardinal will rely on its strength in the mid
dle weight classes. Aguirre, who was suffering from
the flu last week and did not wrestle at the AU-Cal
tournament, will return to action on Sunday.

Senior co-captain Jay Jackson comes in on a roll
after defeating lOth-ranked DeWayne Zinkin on his
way to winning the All-Cal tournament. Juniors Tod
Surmon, Sahlan Martin and Matt Cano — who fin
ished first, second and third, respectively at the All-
Cal — round out the Cardinal strength in the middle.
The Cardinal may run into trouble in the upper
weights because of injuries. A knee injury hobbled
sophomore Roger Liu (177 pounds) while sopho
more Brian Vaniman (190 pounds) was sick last
week and freshman heavyweight Mark Neglay sat
out with a skin condition. Liu is still listed as ques
tionable for Sunday's match. His absence from the
lineup on Sunday would force Stanford to forfeit the
match.
"Bakersfield has a very solid team," Jackson
added. "They are comparable to Fresno State."
The Cardinal lost to the Bulldogs, 32-3, last Fri
day.
"There will be some good matches between our
best and their best," Surmon said. "Hopefully we'll
come through in the big matches."
