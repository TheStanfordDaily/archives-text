# Diversions (*Back in the saddle again)
## Michael Green: Just a fan with a man's courage When no one really cares howyadoin' 
### 
You're walking from class to lunch, and,
as usual, they ride past. Frosh dorm
dorks, that green haired guy from sec
tion, an ex's surly roommate, and the like.
Friends, as it were.
Not the real kind of she's-the-first-one-I
run-to-when-I-get-dissed-(again) friend, more
like the we-used-to-hang-but-now-for-some
reason-we-don't-so-does-that-mean-we're-
just-aquaintances-who-happen-to-know-each-
other's-last-name-now-or-what? friends.
You see a few of them every day, and,
whether they like it or not, they see you. Usu
ally the fleeting recognition goes unacknowl
edged — they just pass on by and pretend,
almost as convincingly as you, that no one saw
anyone.
But sometimes someone screws up and you
accidentally do that eye-contact recognition
thing. You're stuck: someone has to concede.
They smile sheepishly and say, "Hi."
You answer, "Hey," and smile back.
"How are you?"
"Fine, you?"
"Pretty good."
"Okay bye."
Deep stuff.
And these are people you used to split your
Pop-Tarts with.
On it's own, the Hi part is fine — it's an
innocuous greeting, nothing more. The Hey in
return is also intrinsically benign.
But it's when the What's up? or the Howya
doing? is thrown that the truth comes out.
If they don't slow down, they don't mean it.
When they ask how you are, they just don't
care.
These pseudo-greetings are not things to be
taken literally. Like a Nirvana song before
Cobain died, no one listens to the words. They
are simply symptomatic of the recurrent
insincerities which define, if not characterize,
if not comprise, the social jambalaya of college
life.
(Sometimes, if the weather's right, "What's
up?" is actually an acceptable response to the

"How are you?" portion of the exchange,
unfortunate proof that we've become so dis
tracted in our pursuit of the perfect nine-point
font resume that we don't even listen to our
selves anymore.)
It's a pervasive, unapologetic social lie we
engage in daily. Scripted questions distributed
glibly and without the slightest expectation of
an honest response. And if you think for a sec
ond that you're any better than this and actu
ally want to hear Howzitgoin7 just think
about how earnestly you avoid the two or three
people you can always count on to tell you.
That once-buddy turns to you with a "Well
actually I overslept a class this morning and
I've got that diarrhea going sti— "
By that point you've already rounded Histo
ry Corner.
Now all this goes fine with your hi-friends
(i.e., those random, colorful faces you met dur
ing orientation and make up the scenery for
this skit of an education we're getting). With
them these fly-bys act as a wayward reaffirma
tion of our appreciation that they haven't got
ten fat or died. With them, one only need com
plement their new goatee or blue hair or facial
scar and just pass on by. Little else and the
relationship continues.
But if you attempt the gratuitous
Hayadoin 7 while biking by someone you actu
ally used to have conversations with — real
conversations where you told them how badly
you wanted their roommate and they told you
that they're still a virgin — unless they answer
with a "fine," or "tired," or "late," or some

%/
other cute 'n quick closure line, it's left an
unsigned deal, a poor transaction that not only
fails as a reaffirmation of friendship, but acts
as a vague signal that you guys never really
were much of friends in the first place.
Or worse, it tells us how dependent we are
on accessibility to maintain our intimacies.
And all these are just a few among the bazil
lion social lies we tell every day:
Let's go for coffee.
We'll always be friends.
Tell Dave I said, "Hi."
See you soon.
No really, I want to hear about your rela
tional problems.
We say them as often as we hear them and
now we have to pretend we don't notice a
friend approaching until they're within con
versational hi-five range and no further.
So listen to yourself when you recite from
the insidious subconscious script. Be creative
and ask instead, "So when exactly did your
butt get that big?" or, "Are you gunna pop that
thing on your nose or just scare everyone with
it?" At least then you'll know that much more
about their day.
And if someone you wish you'd gotten to
know a bit better lets loose with a Yeahman
wussup? while blading on by, challenge the
gratuitous cordiality. Call out "Stop," and ask,
"Do you really want to know or are you just
being nice?"
If they're assertive enough to say they were
only being nice then at least you'll know you
have an honest relationship going with them.
Otherwise stop and talk. Buy them an Icee
and make yourself late to class. Ask if their ex
roommate ever broke up with that schmuck.
Find out if they're still a virgin. Offer to do
something about it.
Prove to both of you that you can still be
friends when you've got a filofax to fill.
See you soon.

relationship continues.
But if you attempt the gratuitous
Hayadoin 7 while biking by someone you actu
ally used to have conversations with — real
conversations where you told them how badly
you wanted their roommate and they told you
that they're still a virgin — unless they answer
with a "fine," or "tired," or "late," or some

%/
other cute 'n quick closure line, it's left an
unsigned deal, a poor transaction that not only
fails as a reaffirmation of friendship, but acts
as a vague signal that you guys never really
were much of friends in the first place.
Or worse, it tells us how dependent we are
on accessibility to maintain our intimacies.
And all these are just a few among the bazil
lion social lies we tell every day:
Let's go for coffee.
We'll always be friends.
Tell Dave I said, "Hi."
See you soon.
No really, I want to hear about your rela
tional problems.
We say them as often as we hear them and
now we have to pretend we don't notice a
friend approaching until they're within con
versational hi-five range and no further.
So listen to yourself when you recite from
the insidious subconscious script. Be creative
and ask instead, "So when exactly did your
butt get that big?" or, "Are you gunna pop that
thing on your nose or just scare everyone with
it?" At least then you'll know that much more
about their day.
And if someone you wish you'd gotten to
know a bit better lets loose with a Yeahman
wussup? while blading on by, challenge the
gratuitous cordiality. Call out "Stop," and ask,
"Do you really want to know or are you just
being nice?"
If they're assertive enough to say they were
only being nice then at least you'll know you
have an honest relationship going with them.
Otherwise stop and talk. Buy them an Icee
and make yourself late to class. Ask if their ex
roommate ever broke up with that schmuck.
Find out if they're still a virgin. Offer to do
something about it.
Prove to both of you that you can still be
friends when you've got a filofax to fill.
See you soon.
