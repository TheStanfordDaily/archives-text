Warning Stanford undergraduates
not to pass up the ultimate opportunity
to spend vast amounts of their parents'
money, Mac World Magazine humor
columnist Guy Kawasaki said yesterday

he would gladly switch places with any of
the 25 undergraduates who showed up
to hear him speak at Florence Moore
Hall
"I tend to think that GPA and majors
are inversely related to future happi
ness," said Kawasaki, a Stanford alum
nus. "What happened to many of the pre

meds and pre-laws I knew was that they
became vertically oriented, they became
really good at one thing and nothing
else."
He added that grades do not correlate
to future success, saying students will
drive themselves crazy by obsess
ing over them.
Kawasaki described himself as
a "typical, diligent Oriental" who
pressured himself into finishing
his degree in 3-1/2 years and got a
job right out of college.
"That's one of my big regrets

now. I wish I had gone on the five
year plan and taken advantage of
'Stanford in wherever,' " he said,
referring to the University's over
seas programs.
In addition to his advice for
students to broaden their under
graduate experience, Kawasaki
said the first job a graduate lands
out of Stanford should not be an
indicator of future success. He
added, however, that students
should not think there is an end

less supply of time.
"Traveling becomes totally dif
ferent when you've got kids than
when you're a student," he said.
"You have the rest of your lives
to work. Don't go crazy planning
out your lives. Where you end up
is unpredictable, and my Psych
GPA doesn't matter any more,"
said Kawasaki.
He poked fun at his age, saying
that the fact that it has been
almost 20 years since he was at

Stanford is scary. "Is [Psychology
Prof. Phil] Zimbardo still here?"
he asked with apprehension.
During the discussion,
Kawasaki took shots at a variety
of topics in the computer indus
try.
Bill Gates was a frequent tar
get of his jokes. Kawasaki said
that even though Gates may have
"$lO billion," he wouldn't trade
places with him.
"Imagine Bill Gates in swim
ming trunks. . . . Can't he get
some contact lenses, a personal
trainer and a tanning booth?"
Kawasaki asked.
When asked by a student why
he didn't go into the lucrative
field of consulting, he said that his
speeches make him as much
money as a consulting job would.
Additionally, Kawasaki said
business consultants irritate
him. He said they do the easy
work of finding out what the
problems are, thinking up quick
solutions and then walk off with
a check.
"The hard part is sticking
around and implementing your
ideas instead of just picking up
the check and leaving," Kawasaki
said.
Kawasaki earned a bachelor's
degree in psychology from Stan
ford in 1976.
He got a job "through sheer
nepotism" at Apple Computer in
1983. Kawasaki said the friends
and connections made as an
undergraduate would serve
future alumni well.
At Mac World Magazine,
Kawasaki is known as "the
Wise Guy." He has also written
several books and is currently
working on his next book: How to
Drive Your Competition Crazy."
