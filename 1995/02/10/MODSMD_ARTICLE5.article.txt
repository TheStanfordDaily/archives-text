# Fac Sen debates changes to CIV
## 'Culture wars' to begin once again? 
### Elizabeth Goldman Jim Luh Staff writers 
The Faculty Senate yesterday debated
proposed changes to distribution require
ments and the Cultures, Ideas and Values
program, reopening an issue the University
has already faced several times in the past
decade.
Senate members agreed that the discus
sion should serve merely as a prelude to fur
ther debate. "Consider this to be a beginning,
certainly not an end," said Senate Chair Bob
Simoni, a biology professor.
But several senators voiced reservations
about the Commission on Undergraduate Ed
ucation's proposal for revamping the CIV pro
gram, as outlined in its fall-quarter report.
The report recommended decreasing the
total number of DRs by expanding the CIV
program to encompass the American Cul
tures and World Cultures requirements.
At yesterday's meeting, some senators
cautioned against asking CIV to replace too
many DRs. Others criticized inconsistencies
among the nine CIV tracks' curricula, calling
for a clearer definition of the CIV program's
mission.
Faculty members involved in CIV had
raised these and other concerns in a letter of
complaint sent to Campus Report last month.

Though senate members agreed that the
relationship between the CIV program and
the DRs should change, no one spoke in favor
of either the commission's recommendation
or the program in its current state, and no
consensus was reached on the direction in
which to proceed.
"We did not believe that our four or five
paragraphs on these matters would be unan
imously accepted," said History Prof. James
Sheehan, who chaired the commission. "We
recognized that they would begin a discus
sion."
However, Sheehan also said that senators
should not lose sight of the fact that the com
mission strongly endorsed CIV. "We believe
there ought to be ... at least one core experi
ence (for students)," he said.
Pointing out differences in course materi
als, requirements and grading policies
among the various CIV tracks, many senate
members said that CIV in practice does not
provide a common core experience.
"We recognized early last year that there
was a lack of uniformity," admitted CIV Di
rector Paul Seaver, a history professor.
Seaver said that after some reevaluation
of CIV grading practices, "the amount of
[grading] deviation that was quite alarming a
year ago is no longer the case."
Differences in work load are more difficult


Seaver
to alleviate, Seaver said. One prob
lem, he said, is that some tracks
fulfill the freshman writing
requirement in addition to the
CIV requirement.
Though some argued for more
uniformity among CIV tracks,
Europe and the Americas CIV
track coordinator Mary Pratt, a
Spanish professor, warned the
senate against stripping CIV of its
diverse nature.
"Part of the character and orig
inality of CIV," Pratt said, "is that
the diversity of the materials and
the methodologies among the
tracks is a key dimension to the
CIV experience."
Economics Prof. Roger Noll
said any reexamination of CIV
should include a discussion of the
overall mission of the cultures
requirement.

Noll referred to a statement
made by Sheehan last year that
"we shouldn't have a requirement
unless we can explain precisely
what it is supposed to accom
plish."
Chemistry Prof. John Brau
man agreed. "If we're going to
have a requirement, it ought to
have a purpose," he said. "It ought
to have a theme."
English Prof. Regenia Gagnier
questioned whether, while looking
deeper into the mission of the CIV
program, the senate might reopen
the "culture wars" that raged in
the late 1980s over the creation of
CIV and changes to the DR system
And though much of the senate
seemed unwilling to revisit the
culture debate, English Prof.
Robert Polhemus warned that the
issue's return may prove unavoid
able.
"About culture wars — the
solution was not a victory," he
said. "It was an armistice, and it's
all compromised here."
