# Manzanita residence wins 1994 architectural award
## 
### Elisabeth Morse Contributing writer 
Since its opening almost three years ago,
residents of the Manzanita II complex have
compared their dormitory to a hotel, citing
its terrific view, airy rooms and beautiful
landscape as evidence.
Now the residents' claim may have been
proven true. The complex — which includes
Castano, Lantana and the nearby dining
hall — won first prize in the 1994 Builder's
Choice Design and Planning Awards compe
tition.
"I wasn't that surprised that it won an
award," said junior Scott Calvert, a Castano
resident. "It seems very cutting edge for a
dorm, compared to everything else I've seen
at Stanford and on other campuses."
And Manzanita II has more than one
award to its credit, as the dorm has also cap
tured the 1993 Pacific Coast Builders Con
ference Gold Nugget Grand Award, a 1994
Concrete Masonry "honor award" and the
1994 Builders Choice Grand Award.
Opened in the fall of 1992, Manzanita II
was designed by the Palo Alto firm Fisher-

Friedman Associates.
"We tried to build a residential dorm that
enhances the life of the students that live in
it," said Robert Geering, a senior design
principle at Fisher-Friedman Associates
and the project designer for Manzanita 11.
"When designing the dorms, the archi
tects took all elements of student life into ac
count, from aesthetics to convenience. A
Stanford campus architect, representatives
from Facilities and a student representative
were all included in the planning stage.
"If you do something which is nice in feel
ing, then the students feel like it is theirs
and are careful of it," Geering said.
Manzanita was built out of materials
which are as low maintenance as possible,
Geering said, adding that there hasn't real
ly been much damage to the complex.
For example, to promote the building's
maintenance, wainscoting was used on the
bottom of the corridors, the most damage
prone part of the dorms.
"It's the best place I've lived so far," said
junior John Yung, a Castaho resident. "It's
got a ping-pong table, a pool table
and lots of study rooms."
Manzanita II includes many
carefully thought out architec
tural features, such as student
lounges with "nice high wood
ceilings which feel residential and
home-like, like a nice big living
room," Geering commented.
"At the start, it felt very hotel
y, but now it feels very homey,"
Yung said.
"I've always called it Hotel
Castario because it's just like liv

ing in a hotel," Calvert said. "It's
really nice, it's clean, and the
rooms are well-lit and have great
views for the most part."
The arcade between the dining
hall and the dorms, with its lawn
and symmetrical elements, was a
particular point of focus, Geering
said.
The Manzanita dining room
was redesigned so that there
could be two separate dining
spaces which would facilitate
each dorm having its own individ
ual identity.
"We tried to aim for only 100
students in each house so that
they could have their own person
ality," Geering said.
