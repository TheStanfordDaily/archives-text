# 'Serenade your sweetie'
## Symphony valentines raise funding 
### Tracy Jan 
If you're sick of aspirin-tasting candy hearts, choco
late cupids and doily-covered red construction paper,
there's still hope for Valentine's Day.
As Feb. 14 approaches, one Stanford organization
is offering an alternative way to charm that special
someone. For students who have a sweetheart to share
the day with, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra is of
fering to "Serenade Your Sweetie."
On the night of Feb. 14, between 10:00 and mid
night, the symphony will go from dorm to dorm and
surprise the lucky loved ones with music played by
quartets of violinists in concert dress. The profits from
the serenades will go toward the symphony's sched
uled 1995 summer tour of China.
"It's a really romantic thing to have a girl or guy in
a tuxedo come to serenade you with a violin. It's kind
of cool," said sophomore Michael Lin, a violinist in the
orchestra. He said he believes students want an oppor
tunity to express their romantic sides.
"Students with a lot of initiative put the whole
thing together," Lin said, adding that he hopes their
efforts will help realize the symphony's goal of subsi
dizing part of the $250,000 cost of going to China.
The China trip, covering various cities, will take
place for three weeks in June and the symphony will
play four to five concerts. University President Ger
hard Casper is the tour's honorary chairperson.
So far, the symphony has sold about two dozen ser
enades to students and faculty and today is the last day
to buy a spot. Symphony members said they hope to
raise at least $1000.
"I'm very optimistic about our chances of doing well
with this," said violinist Becky Gelfand, who chairs
fundraising events for the symphony.
Some symphony members said they recognize the

competition with a cappella groups, which are also sell
ing serenades, but added they believe instrumental
music is a unique Valentine's gift. "We have an edge
over the a cappella groups — it's something new," said
orchestra president Elisabeth Christensen.
"We are providing a unique service to the campus,"
agreed sophomore violinist Pamina Kim, another
fundraising chair. "Though there is room for im
provement in our organization, sales are going sur
prisingly well. Hopefully we can do this again next
year."
Besides on-campus serenades, the group is selling
the "90s version" telephone serenade, for those who
maintain long-distance relationships: a short personal
message followed by a piece of music. The symphony
will even leave a message on an answering machine,
Christensen said.
Christensen added that someone has already re
quested an early serenade, to be played during a house
meeting for a visiting mother's birthday.
The violinists will play from three pieces of music:
Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet, Camille
Saint-Saens' The Swan, or G. Braga's Angel's Sere
nade, Lin said.
"Some instruments are easier to transport than
others," Christensen said, explaining the exclusive use
of violins.
Lin listed other fund raisers the symphony has
done to help subsidize the China trip, including a 12-
hour "play-a-thon" and selling chocolate bars. This is
the first time the group has offered serenades.
The Stanford Symphony Orchestra consists of ap
proximately 80 members, including 36 violinists. The
musicians range in age from a high school student to
graduate students and members from the surround
ing community. The group of musicians rehearses 5
hours a week.
