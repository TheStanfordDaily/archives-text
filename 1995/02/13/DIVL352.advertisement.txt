"Sounding Board
Call 723-2555 ext. 650
Call in comments on whatever is on your mind to the voice mailbox above and we will print the most
interesting ones we receive beginning this Tuesday. What could the University be doing better? What is
your roommate's most annoying habit? What is your least favorite part of the "Contract with America"?
Your comments will be entirely anonymous to allow you to express your true feelings. Please make your
message from one to three sentences in length.
Examples:
"I think Stanford should give all of its land back to the Ohlone Indians."
"I wish my roommate would shower more often and wear deodorant."
"Dan Quayle would have made a fine President. Why did he drop out of the race so early?"
CALL TODAY AND SEE YOUR MESSAGE IN PRINT TOMORROW!
