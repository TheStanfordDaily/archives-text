# High rhymes and misdemeanors
## Poet Ginsberg reads his work 
### Gabriela Teodorescu Contributing writer 
Allen Ginsberg is a paradox. Slight in stature
with his neatly-trimmed beard, gray suit and tie,
he looked like a meek businessman at his poetry
reading Friday night.
But he sounded like a cross between Ice-T and
Walt Whitman, chanting his heroic "suck cock,
suck cock, don't smoke, don't smoke the official
dope" to the overflowing audience at Kresge Au
ditorium.
With his knowledge, rhythm and oratory,
Ginsberg — a famous Beat poet whose collection
of mementos and papers Stanford bought last
summer for about $1 million — shocked, si
lenced and amused the audience.
Before reading his work, Ginsberg's soft voice
checked the microphone as he slowly poured
himself some tea.
Then, like a pop star, Ginsberg put on a show.
The audience crowded on the stage and filled the
auditorium's four aisles to hear his versions of
lyric and rhyme.
With the opening poem, "Sunflower Sutra,"
Ginsberg's shoulders moved in rhythm. His eye
brows lifted and occasionally one eye closed with
the momentum and energy of the words. He re
lated his simple secrets to the audience: "And you
Locomotive, you are a locomotive, forget me
not."
Ginsberg improvised frequently. Reading his
poem "America,"he said, "I haven't read the
newspapers for months, everyday somebody fa
mous goes on trial for murder" — adding the
word "famous" to laughter from the crowd.
In his singsong, shameless voice Ginsberg de
clared: "I smoke marijuana every chance I get,"
drawing the audience's cheers. Ending to tri
umphant applause, he proclaimed, "America I'm
putting my queer shoulder to the wheel."
Ginsberg's "Wichita Vortex Sutra" captured
many of America's anxieties and wishes during
the Vietnam era. "I lift my voice aloud. ... I here
declare the end of the War," Ginsberg shouted,
making his '60s message connect again today.
