# High rhymes and misdemeanors
## Poet Ginsberg reads his work 
### Gabriela Teodorescu Contributing writer 
Allen Ginsberg is a paradox. Slight in stature
with his neatly-trimmed beard, gray suit and tie,
he looked like a meek businessman at his poetry
reading Friday night.
But he sounded like a cross between Ice-T and
Walt Whitman, chanting his heroic "suck cock,
suck cock, don't smoke, don't smoke the official
dope" to the overflowing audience at Kresge Au
ditorium.
With his knowledge, rhythm and oratory,
Ginsberg — a famous Beat poet whose collection
of mementos and papers Stanford bought last
summer for about $1 million — shocked, si
lenced and amused the audience.
Before reading his work, Ginsberg's soft voice
checked the microphone as he slowly poured
himself some tea.
Then, like a pop star, Ginsberg put on a show.
The audience crowded on the stage and filled the
auditorium's four aisles to hear his versions of
lyric and rhyme.
With the opening poem, "Sunflower Sutra,"
Ginsberg's shoulders moved in rhythm. His eye
brows lifted and occasionally one eye closed with
the momentum and energy of the words. He re
lated his simple secrets to the audience: "And you
Locomotive, you are a locomotive, forget me
not."
Ginsberg improvised frequently. Reading his
poem "America,"he said, "I haven't read the
newspapers for months, everyday somebody fa
mous goes on trial for murder" — adding the
word "famous" to laughter from the crowd.
In his singsong, shameless voice Ginsberg de
clared: "I smoke marijuana every chance I get,"
drawing the audience's cheers. Ending to tri
umphant applause, he proclaimed, "America I'm
putting my queer shoulder to the wheel."
Ginsberg's "Wichita Vortex Sutra" captured
many of America's anxieties and wishes during
the Vietnam era. "I lift my voice aloud. ... I here
declare the end of the War," Ginsberg shouted,
making his '60s message connect again today.

Beat poet Allen Ginsberg entertains an overflowing Kresge Auditorium with his work
Friday night.
Using his harmonium (an
instrument similar to an accor
dion), Ginsberg reversed the
mood, singing his mid-'7os poet
ry. Love for his dead father, the
mysteries of aging and the fear of
death were softly and meaningful
ly related, eliciting silence and
awe from the audience.
More upbeat was the ditty "Do
the Meditation Rock," which
taught the listener how to medi
tate and espoused the Buddhist
principles in which Ginsberg
believes: "I fought the Dharma,
and the Dharma won."
Ginsberg did not steer away
from the political, using his claves
to convince the audience not to
smoke the "official dope" — legal
ized cigarettes. His "Put Down
Your Cigarette Rag" not only
caused rollicking laughter, but
offered his views about the money
the government and senators

such as Jesse Helms make from
tobacco.
In his National Security Coun
cil poem he narrated the Iran
Contra affair and other infamous
government dealings. Ginsberg's
dislike of authority stems from
his time on the FBl's Dangerous
Security List and the blacklisting
of his poetry from the educational
programs of the U.S. Information
Agency.
Ginsberg also provided
moments of pure, apolitical poet
ry, reciting his "American Sen
tences" — 17-syllable lines like "A
dandelion seed floats above the
marsh grass with the
mosquitoes," or "In the half light
of dawn, a few birds warble under
the Pleiades."
The poems "Sphincter" and
"What Goes In, Must Come Out,"
shocked the audience with their
irreverent references to funda
mental bodily processes.
Overall, Ginsberg's later poems
dealt with life and honesty, self
knowledge and a sense of growing
old. In "Cosmopolitan Greetings,"

he ended powerfully with the line,
"Candor ends paranoia."
This combination of boldness,
shock and poetic beauty, as strange
as the pocket protector in his shirt,
shows why Ginsberg has been a
pivotal figure of American counter
culture for the last 45 years.
Considering his fame, Gins
berg's attitude of nonchalance
was perhaps the most striking
thing about him. He addressed
people familiarly, answered ques
tions with ease and attentively
autographed fans' books and
talked to admirers.
Seeing a large set of keys hang
ing from the blue jeans of a man
who had just finished thanking
him for existing, Ginsberg asked
him what the keys were. The
man, at first taken aback, asked
Ginsberg to repeat the question,
and answered, "Oh, they're keys
to the house, motorcycles, that
kind of stuff."
Interviewed before the show,
Ginsberg talked about the reduc
tive tendencies of the media,
expressing displeasure with some

coverage of last year's sale of his
papers to Stanford.
He then addressed his first
LSD experience at the Stanford
Mental Health Institute in 1959.
"It was a bum trip, man, if you
read the poem ("Lysergic Acid")
because it was under medical aus
pices," he said. "But it wasn't so
new because I had already experi
mented with mescaline and pey
ote."
Giving advice to young writers,
he referred to his own experi
ences. "What really helped me
was that I knew other young writ
ers, like [Jack] Kerouac at the age
of 17, and I had a gang, a commu
nity," he said.
Asked about his theory of
spontaneous writing, Ginsberg
admitted that he revises his poet
ry. "The basis is spontaneity, you
train your mind, you revise in
your mind. It's like in calligraphy,
when you are ready to move, you
do one stroke. But, I revise.
"Do I contradict myself? Yes I
contradict myself," Ginsberg said,
quoting Whitman.

mysteries of aging and the fear of
death were softly and meaningful
ly related, eliciting silence and
awe from the audience.
More upbeat was the ditty "Do
the Meditation Rock," which
taught the listener how to medi
tate and espoused the Buddhist
principles in which Ginsberg
believes: "I fought the Dharma,
and the Dharma won."
Ginsberg did not steer away
from the political, using his claves
to convince the audience not to
smoke the "official dope" — legal
ized cigarettes. His "Put Down
Your Cigarette Rag" not only
caused rollicking laughter, but
offered his views about the money
the government and senators

such as Jesse Helms make from
tobacco.
In his National Security Coun
cil poem he narrated the Iran
Contra affair and other infamous
government dealings. Ginsberg's
dislike of authority stems from
his time on the FBl's Dangerous
Security List and the blacklisting
of his poetry from the educational
programs of the U.S. Information
Agency.
Ginsberg also provided
moments of pure, apolitical poet
ry, reciting his "American Sen
tences" — 17-syllable lines like "A
dandelion seed floats above the
marsh grass with the
mosquitoes," or "In the half light
of dawn, a few birds warble under
the Pleiades."
The poems "Sphincter" and
"What Goes In, Must Come Out,"
shocked the audience with their
irreverent references to funda
mental bodily processes.
Overall, Ginsberg's later poems
dealt with life and honesty, self
knowledge and a sense of growing
old. In "Cosmopolitan Greetings,"

he ended powerfully with the line,
"Candor ends paranoia."
This combination of boldness,
shock and poetic beauty, as strange
as the pocket protector in his shirt,
shows why Ginsberg has been a
pivotal figure of American counter
culture for the last 45 years.
Considering his fame, Gins
berg's attitude of nonchalance
was perhaps the most striking
thing about him. He addressed
people familiarly, answered ques
tions with ease and attentively
autographed fans' books and
talked to admirers.
Seeing a large set of keys hang
ing from the blue jeans of a man
who had just finished thanking
him for existing, Ginsberg asked
him what the keys were. The
man, at first taken aback, asked
Ginsberg to repeat the question,
and answered, "Oh, they're keys
to the house, motorcycles, that
kind of stuff."
Interviewed before the show,
Ginsberg talked about the reduc
tive tendencies of the media,
expressing displeasure with some

coverage of last year's sale of his
papers to Stanford.
He then addressed his first
LSD experience at the Stanford
Mental Health Institute in 1959.
"It was a bum trip, man, if you
read the poem ("Lysergic Acid")
because it was under medical aus
pices," he said. "But it wasn't so
new because I had already experi
mented with mescaline and pey
ote."
Giving advice to young writers,
he referred to his own experi
ences. "What really helped me
was that I knew other young writ
ers, like [Jack] Kerouac at the age
of 17, and I had a gang, a commu
nity," he said.
Asked about his theory of
spontaneous writing, Ginsberg
admitted that he revises his poet
ry. "The basis is spontaneity, you
train your mind, you revise in
your mind. It's like in calligraphy,
when you are ready to move, you
do one stroke. But, I revise.
"Do I contradict myself? Yes I
contradict myself," Ginsberg said,
quoting Whitman.
