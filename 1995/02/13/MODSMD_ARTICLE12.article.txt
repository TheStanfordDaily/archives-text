More action in Chiapas
SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico
(AP) — Government soldiers pursued guerrilla
leaders into the jungles of southern Mexico yester
day, sending dozens of peasants fleeing. No new
violence was reported.
The government says it is trying to avoid con
frontations, and Guatemala promised to assist the
Mexican army by preventing rebels from crossing
the border.
"In no way is this being treated like a war," the
Mexican Interior Ministry said in a statement.
Transport trucks and light armored vehicles
began rumbling into rebel territory in the southern
state of Chiapas after President Ernesto Zedillo
announced Thursday that he had ordered the
arrest of top rebel leaders, including the ski
masked Zapatista spokesman, Subcomandante
Marcos.

One military officer was killed by an unidenti
fied gunman after the army began its advance on
Thursday.
Nominee's actions debated
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House
promised a political brawl over its surgeon general
nominee yesteray, accusing Republicans of pander
ing to anti-abortionists and scolding slow-to-help
Democratic lawmakers.
But the GOP pushed its case against Dr. Henry
Foster, who performed abortions as an obstetri
cian-gynecologist and conducted hysterectomies on
severely retarded women in the 1960s and 19705.
Republican lawmakers insisted that Foster's
having performed abortions wasn't the only issue;
they blasted the White House for misleading
Congress about his record on abortions and steril
izations.
