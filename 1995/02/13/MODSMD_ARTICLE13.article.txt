# O.J. jury tours crime scene

LOS ANGELES (AP) - O.J.
Simpson visited his estate yester
day for the first time since his
arrest eight months ago, but decid
ed against joining jurors for a tour
of the spot where the bodies of his
ex-wife and her friend were found.
Simpson, not wearing handcuffs
or apparently any other restraint,
stood in the front yard of his Brent
wood mansion and chatted with
lawyers while jurors walked
around his property. A few plain
clothes deputies stood near him.
On the last stop of their daylong
tour, jurors were escorted through
Simpson's bedroom, bathroom,
closet, kitchen, garage, laundry
room and trophy room. They also
poked into the room used by for
mer Simpson guest Brian "Kato"
Kaelin, a witness in the trial.

Eight months to the day after
the murders of Nicole Brown
Simpson and Ronald Goldman,
Superior Court Judge Lance Ito
convened an unusual Sunday ses
sion for the tour.
Traveling in a motorcade of
presidential proportions, jurors
arrived at the murder scene at Ms.
Simpson's Brentwood condomini
um. Simpson stayed a block away
in a police car.
Jurors took copious notes of
their observations where the
slashed, crumpled bodies of Ms.
Simpson and Goldman were found
in pools of blood.
Crowds gathered along the way,
mostly people out walking their
dogs or riding bikes on the sunny
morning.
A man who was giving out

orange juice was told to remove his
sign that read: "Free 0.J."
"This is incredible," said police
Officer Art Holmes. "People are
pretty much dumbfounded by
what's happening here today. I
don't think anyone's ever seen any
thing like this as a result of a court
case."
Security was tight: 250 police
officers were working in Brent
wood, many on overtime, police
said. Streets were barricaded,
airspace was restricted to keep
news helicopters at a distance and
some residents were escorted by
police to their homes.
Also on the itinerary were Gold
man's apartment and Mezzaluna,
the restaurant where Goldman
worked and Ms. Simpson ate din
ner hours before her death.
