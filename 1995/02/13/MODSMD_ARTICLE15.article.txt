Stanford should remove
eucalyptus trees and put
native ones in their place

OVER 100 DEAD or injured
trees on the Stanford campus
are in need of maintenance or
have been scheduled for removal.
Most of these are eucalyptus trees,
which are found in the Arboretum
and all over the rest of campus.
Eucalyptus trees, native to the
Australian continent, are under
attack from one of their natural
predators, the wood-tunneling borer.
The beetle bores into the trunk of the
tree, cutting ofT its nutrient supply
and eventually killing the tree.
Because wood-tunneling borers have
an abundant food supply and no nat
ural predators in the area, their pop
ulation has grown rapidly.
As a result, wood-tunneling borers
pose a major threat to the eucalyptus
trees on the Stanford campus. In
other parts of the world as well, euca
lyptus populations are also under
siege from their insect nemesis.
In Brazil, Chile, Indonesia and
many other countries, vast tracts of
temperate and tropical forest have
been cut to make way for eucalyptus
plantations. Eucalyptus trees are
grown to produce wood chips for
paper production because they are
one of the fastest growing tree species
in the world.
To grow so rapidly, however, euca
lyptus trees consume far more water
and soil nutrients than other types of
trees, often disrupting hvdrologic
cycles and depleting nutrient levels.
In addition, the trees are being
attacked by the wood-tunneling
borer.
For these reasons many tree farm
ers are beginning to plant slower
growing species which are less sus
ceptible to damage from pests and
cause less harm to the environment.
Natural ecosystems evolve over
the millennia to achieve harmonious
and dynamic equilibria. The popula

tion of a given species depends on a
number of factors, including the
quantity of its food supply, availabili
ty of habitat and predator popula
tions.
Introducing exotic species into
ecosystems often disturbs the previ
ously existing balance. Cattle which
have been introduced in the Foothills,
for example, have eaten all of the nat
urally regenerating oak saplings and
forced the University to hire an out
side organization to plant oak trees â€”
protected from the cows by plastic
barriers.
Native trees and plants, on the
other hand, serve as sources of shel
ter and food for native wildlife, which
often has no use for exotic species.
Several species of birds are currently
being reintroduced into the area, and
their chances of survival would be
increased if they were provided with
more habitat in the form of native
trees.
For these reasons Stanford has
already adopted a policy of replacing
dead eucalyptus trees with native
species such as live oaks, valley oaks,
blue oaks, and different types of pine
trees, according to University Labor
and Grounds Manager Herb Fong.
The campus was originally an area of
oak forest and oak savannah, Fong
said.
This was an intelligent decision by
the University, mid is certainly a step
in the right direction. Given the unre
lenting threat posed by the wood-tun
neling borer and the environmental
damage caused by eucalyptus trees,
however, Stanford should be more
proactive and begin cutting down
healthy eucalyptus trees and planting
native species in their place.
Because eucalyptus trees leech
water and nutrients from the soil,
they deprive other tree and plant
species of the possibility of growing
nearby. The damage they cause will
be difficult to reverse, and should
therefore be halted as early as possi
ble.
Restoring the Stanford campus to
its natural environment will be a slow
process. The sooner we start moving
in that direction, the better.
