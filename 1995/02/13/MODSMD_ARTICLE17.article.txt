## Families are very valuable 
### 
I DO GET a lot of care packages — a
lot of care packages (ask my room
mates — they love my mom!). I have
an entire bulletin board in my room
dedicated to my kid sister's latest
watercolor and coloring book master
pieces. I call home once a week for an
hour. I write e-mails home every day.
One of the my favorite things is walking
off the jetway into my family's arms
after finals are history.
"Family values" has become a popu
lar catch phrase in politics recently. I
believe the attention is worthy, even if
Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich and future
leaders are incapable of imbuing us
with a sense of family bonds. We cannot
deny that a strong family foundation is
the key to future success. The most
basic unit of our society is also its most
fundamentally important component.
I have many memories of times with
my mom, dad, brother and sister that
sustain me today — or at least make me
smile when they cross my mind. I can
also remember some times with those
same people that weren't the greatest.
Our families tend to be there most for
us when we experience the bitterest of
defeats and hit the lowest of valleys in
the roller coaster of life.
And some of those low points are a
direct result of interactions with certain
family members. Take my brother, for
example. Sibling coexistence definitely

isn't always all roses. When he and I
were chasing each other around the
kitchen with knives when Mom and Dad
were out, we weren't exactly cherishing
our family bond. Now that we're a thou
sand miles apart (and can't go for each
other's throat everyday) we would prob
ably admit deep down that we miss each
other.
It is the simple nature of families
that make them so important. We're
born into a certain family with no
choice in the matter. Then we're all
stuck under the same roof for approxi
mately eighteen years (with the possi
bility of a few additions along the way).
We can't sever blood ties. Because we
sail through calm water and raging
storms with our family, we grow closer
to one another.
Until I got to college I never thought
a tremendous amount about the vital
importance of my family. I knew that
they were always there for me, from the
preschool Christmas program through
the high school sports events. They
were just there, day in and day out.
What seems so unspectacular about it is
the most spectacular aspect. I can sit
here today at Stanford and appreciate
all that they've done for me precisely
because they were simply there when I
needed them.
It may seem pretty crazy for my mom
to send me all the stuff that she does.

The workers at the UPS office at home
know her and my sister by name (heck,
they even know me and I've never even
met them!). I could have just gone down
to Safeway on El Camino and bought
the 20 pounds of drinks she sent for us
to stock our refrigerator. Sometimes, I
don't have time to read all the articles
she sends about hometown politics and
the upcoming cross-town rivalry foot
ball game. But, there will be no replace
ment for the satisfaction of knowing
that somebody cares about me from
afar. I'll keep putting my sister's Lion
King watercolors and the newspaper
sports clippings of my brother on my
bulletin board. At least then they won't
seem so far away. I'm sure we'll contin
ue to keep MCI, America Online and
UPS in business. Every care package,
every phone call, every trip home
strengthens the bonds we share.
Cringe all you want at the rhetoric
about family values. Let's just hope
that underneath it all, the politicians
remember back to the best times with
Mom, Dad, Sister and Brother.

Aaron hopes that Mom and Dad aren't
too upset to learn about the knife fight
with his brother.
