## Women shooters double up Devils

Stanford; 102

The Stanford women's basket
ball team flirted with history again
last Saturday night as it looked to
beat its own Pacific 10 Conference
record for margin of victory against
the visiting Arizona State Sun Dev
ils.
The Cardinal (19-2 overall, 10-1
in the Pac-10) steamrolled ASU (8-
12, 2-9) in a 102-51 destruction
that fell only five points short of the
record this very Cardinal team
inscribed in the history books earli
er this season against the USC Tro
jans.
Stanford took advantage of a
shorthanded Sun Devil squad that
sorely missed absent personnel.
Tiffany Krahenbuhl, ASU's leading
scorer, watched from the sideline

due to a strained right calf muscle
she sustained during Wednesday's
practice. Another Sun Devil
starter, guard Liisa Kotilainen, also
did not dress since a sprained ankle
in the warm-ups before ASU's
Thursday game against Cal kept
her out of commission.
However, the Cardinal was not
without its own problems as well.
Freshman Olympia Scott, who had
started 19 games for head coach
Tara VanDerveer this season, was
diagnosed with a stress fracture in
her right tibia. She will miss two
weeks and then be re-evaluated.
Stanford's depth answered the
call, however. Senior Rachel Hem
mer again stepped into the starting
role in fine fashion, leading the
team with 18 points and nine
rebounds. Hemmer was nearly
flawless, connecting on four of five
from the floor and eight of nine
from the charity stripe. Sophomore
Kate Starbird shared scoring hon
ors with 18, many coming on silky
smooth jumpers along the baseline.

State defender. The Sun Devil defense struggled as the Cardinal scored over 100
points for the third consecutive home game.
