## Women shooters double up Devils

The Stanford women's basket
ball team flirted with history again
last Saturday night as it looked to
beat its own Pacific 10 Conference
record for margin of victory against
the visiting Arizona State Sun Dev
ils.
The Cardinal (19-2 overall, 10-1
in the Pac-10) steamrolled ASU (8-
12, 2-9) in a 102-51 destruction
that fell only five points short of the
record this very Cardinal team
inscribed in the history books earli
er this season against the USC Tro
jans.
Stanford took advantage of a
shorthanded Sun Devil squad that
sorely missed absent personnel.
Tiffany Krahenbuhl, ASU's leading
scorer, watched from the sideline

due to a strained right calf muscle
she sustained during Wednesday's
practice. Another Sun Devil
starter, guard Liisa Kotilainen, also
did not dress since a sprained ankle
in the warm-ups before ASU's
Thursday game against Cal kept
her out of commission.
However, the Cardinal was not
without its own problems as well.
Freshman Olympia Scott, who had
started 19 games for head coach
Tara VanDerveer this season, was
diagnosed with a stress fracture in
her right tibia. She will miss two
weeks and then be re-evaluated.
Stanford's depth answered the
call, however. Senior Rachel Hem
mer again stepped into the starting
role in fine fashion, leading the
team with 18 points and nine
rebounds. Hemmer was nearly
flawless, connecting on four of five
from the floor and eight of nine
from the charity stripe. Sophomore
Kate Starbird shared scoring hon
ors with 18, many coming on silky
smooth jumpers along the baseline.

Freshman forward Kristin Folkl gets sandwiched by Molly Tuter and another Arizona
State defender. The Sun Devil defense struggled as the Cardinal scored over 100
points for the third consecutive home game.
The story of the game, however,
was told by the Cardinal defense,
which forced an astounding 38
turnovers. Throughout a substan
tial portion of the contest, the Sun
Devils had more turnovers than
points. Freshman Stephanie Free
man, who had never played point
guard before Saturday night's tip
off, committed 12 turnovers single
handedly.
The Cardinal defense did not
allow ASU to reach double digits in
scoring until the eight-minute
mark of the first half.
"ASU came out with a different
and very good game plan against
us," VanDerveer said. "We turned
it over a lot in the first half."
The Cardinal extended its lead
to 45-19 heading into the locker

room for the intermission. This
advantage resulted from a 26.1 per
cent shooting clip and 20 first-half
turnovers by Arizona State.
Unselfishness provided the lift for
Stanford as distributors sopho
more Jamila Wideman and senior
Kate Paye dished out 13 assists in
the half. Often, Hemmer was the
beneficiary as she poured in 15 of
her 18 before the break.
After the win, VanDerveer com
mented on how extreme the Cardi
nal's games have been, from the
shocking loss to a previously
unranked Oregon State team to
the record-breaking blowout of a
top-25 USC squad.
"We can't be an all or nothing
team," she said. "We have to really
look at coming out and being con
sistent. We are very comfortable
playing here. We have to make the
adjustment to being comfortable
playing over at Cal or at USC or
UCLA."
