# Five years later, the same debate?
## Profs doubt a return to 'culture wars' 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
In the 1980s, debates over
changes to Stanford's culture re
quirements made national head
lines and drove campus politics.
Though the debate ended years
ago, members of the Faculty Sen
ate last Thursday questioned
whether discussion would reopen
on the fundamental issues of how
to teach culture — the very same
issues that were debated five years
ago.
Back then, the senate's argu
ments led to the implementation
of the Cultures, Ideas and Values

program and the
addition of the
American and
World Cultures
areas to the dis
tribution re
quirements.
Now, the
Commission on
Undergraduate
Education has

recommended that the CIV pro
gram be altered to include the two
other culture requirements, also
noting in its report the widespread
complaints of discrepancies
among CIV tracks in grading and

workload.
But despite the mixed reviews
the CIV program has received in the
five years since its inception — and
despite the controversy now sur
rounding the commission's recom
mendation — there is no need or
desire to change the entire program,
faculty members say.
"I don't see that there's any
sign" of a return to the so-called
'Culture Wars' of the late 1980s",
said History Prof. James Sheehan,
the commission's chair.
"What is controversial (now],"
Sheehan added, "is how CIV relates
to the other parts of the cultures
core."
A political compromise
Though the current CIV pro
gram has been called a compromise,
faculty members say it represents
the best compromise possible.
The CIV idea grew out of argu
ments that the old Western Culture
program focused too much on the
work of white males. Those ideas, in
turn, prompted sentiment against
such changes, expressed in rallies,

print and angry debates both on
campus and across the countiy.
The senate approved the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values course in
April, 1988, as a replacement for
Western Culture and the program
was implemented in the fall of 1989.
Some faculty members said that
public reaction is a factor in consid
ering whether the debate should be
reopened.
"I'm not sure that anybody
wants the University to be doing this
at the moment," said History Prof.
Paul Seaver, the director of the CIV
program. "This is a political climate
in which it seems to me any funda
mental debate about how we teach
culture is going to be politicized by
the larger community even if it's not
a political issue on the campus.
"That's what happened last
time," Seaver added. "We took a ter
rible beating in the press. ... I
would sort of hate to go back over
the whole debate again."
"I think most people want to
avoid that," agreed faculty senate
member Regenia Gagnier, an
English professor. "I think people
are going to try to fmd an easier solu
tion, but you can't predict that."
Seaver emphasized that the CIV
program is still growing and being
shaped and that the complaints are

not a reason to redesign the entire
program.
Renewing the debate would
cause unnecessary pain "in part
because some of the courses are only
three years old and all of them have
evolved," he said.
"It seems to me the time to
rethink the whole program is when
people become bored of teaching it.
We're still some years off from
that," Seaver said. "As long as that
experimentation is going on, I'd
hate to scrap it and start a new
experiment."
Even given unlimited time, Gag
nier said she would refrain from
redoing the program.
"The things haven't been in
place long enough yet," she said.
DRs 2 and 3, World and American
Cultures, were implemented in
1991, and "four years is not long
enough for a course to establish
itself," she said. "I would want more
evidence that it's not working."
"I think it's a matter of refocus
ing what we do," Sheehan said of
the senate's present goal. "It's a
matter of remodeling rather than
reconstructing."
Commission recommendations
While the commission's recom
mendation is to combine the CIV,

American Cultures and World Cul
tures distribution requirements, the
Humanities and Sciences Council
has suggested that CIV fulfill Area 1,
which it currently fills, and one
other DR, but not necessarily either
of the two cultures requirements.
The commission's recommenda
tion reports that, after posing the
question: "Given the apparent prob
lems in CIV, should the require
ment be maintained?" the commis
sion "concluded that the course has
a number of valuable functions."
"Although we recommend that
there should be a first-year course
modeled on CIV," the report contin
ues, "we are convinced that the cur
rent program must be transformed
if it is to fulfill in practice the first
objective articulated in its founding
legislation" — that of providing
freshmen with a "common intellec
tual experience" to broaden their
minds.
Too many requirements?
The real question currently
before the senate is how to lower the
total number of distribution
requirements, said senate member
and Economics Prof. Roger Noll.
"I think the main problem isn't
the CIV program in particular,"
Noll said. "It's the whole pattern of

requirements. I don't think CIV
should be singled out."
Citing a "tendency by faculty to
add more and more requirements,"
Noll said, "the problem is that if
we're trying to please everyone's lit
tle hobby horse about what ought to
be in the curriculum, you're halfway
through your junior year before you
get through introductory courses."
Noll said he sees the most rea
sonable way to solve the problems of
increasing requirements and differ
ences among the tracks is to require
a certain number of units in the
humanities rather than a specific
course like CIV.
"If it is the belief that some
amount of units in non-Western
culture is necessary, let that be a
requirement," he said. "Everything
else is just a unit requirement in the
humanities and social sciences."
This system, Noll said, will allow
students to pursue more in-depth
studies on one particular area
rather than getting the broad spec
trum of glimpses that CIV in its cur
rent form offers.
"I don't think that what univer
sity knowledge is all about is learn
ing a little bit about everything,"
Noll said. "A lot of the problem of
what's wrong with CIV is it's trying
to do so many things simultaneous

ly that it's not doing any of them
well at all."
But Seaver said that despite ups
and downs, the CIV program has
had a good five years.
In discussing whether the pro
gram is a success, Seaver said, "Yes,
to the degree that we've been able to
launch new courses that couldn't
have been launched before. Yes,
because of traditional tracks that
have changed in ways they wouldn't
have changed if we hadn't started
CIV.
"No," he added, "in the sense
that the traditional tracks have not
changed as much as some believe
they ought to. And no, in the sense
that we don't have as many new
courses as I ... would like to have
seen."
Seaver said that the program has
emerged in good shape from what
could have been a disaster after the
last set of debates.
"I think we would have lost a lot
of terrific teachers to freshman
instruction if the people who had
been on the losing side of that vote
had said, 'Well, I'll go do something
else,' " Seaver said. "But they
haven't. You'll find all of them very
engaged in the program. The results
were happier than we might have
expected."
