# Stingy D and Hemmer return to the forefront
## 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
After rolling over Arizona on
Thursday night, 100-72, it didn't
seem that the Cardinal was lacking
in any phase of the game.
However, as impressive as the
team was on Thursday, in the 102-
51 win over Arizona State on Satur
day, head coach Tara VanDerveer
saw the re-emergence of two impor
tant aspects of her team â€” suffocat
ing defense and the powerful inside
game of Rachel Hemmer.
It was obvious that the Sun Dev
ils didn't stand a chance of beating
the Cardinal given the fact that they

were missing their two starting
guards, Liisa Kotilainen and
Tiffany Krahenbuhl, who both were
out due to injury.
The key to the game was that the
Cardinal women knew they were
facing a severely undermanned
club, and instead of becoming com
placent, they jumped at the smell of
blood.
"Our half-court trap, I think,
worked very well," VanDerveer
said. "Our defense overall is work
ing more aggressively, but we still
have a long way to go."
Saying that the Cardinal's half
court trap worked very well is like
saying Michael Jordan was a pretty
good player.
The Cardinal's trap, and defense
as a whole, was awesome.
Cardinal guards Jamila Wide
man and Kate Paye did such a good
job defensively on the Sun Devils'
replacement point guard,
Stephanie Freeman, that at one
point it looked like Freeman was
about to cry.
To her credit, a freshman back
up point guard can't be expected to
flawlessly lead her team on the road
against the sixth-ranked squad in
the country. However, Freeman,
who finished with 12 turnovers,
played scared from the start-
Perhaps the most telling inci
dent in the game came when Stan
ford was ahead by 50 points and
VanDerveer had to jump off of the
bench to yell at Wideman to back
out of the full-court press.
The win also marked the appar
ent return of senior Hemmer, who
has been plagued by an ankle injury.
Hemmer, who savs she's only at

85 percent, played with an intensity
reminiscent of her inside domina
tion last year. She finished with 18
points and nine rebounds, but was
quick to downplay her effort.
"I'm happy with (her offensive
performance], but I'm not neces
sarily looking at those kinds of
things," Hemmer said. "The thing I
need to work on most is my defense,
I don't think I did a good job in the
Arizona game or other games and
I'm working on that."
Hemmer explained the team's
intensity as an attempt to let every
one know that Stanford is back to
form and that last week's loss at
Oregon State was an aberration.
"I think that as we go into the
second half of our Pac-10 season we
want to send a message," she said.
"We want to get ourselves ready for
the NCAA tournament and that's
our goal for each game."
It's clear that the team's focus is
already on the post-season, but
that's not to say each game doesn't
carry its own importance.
"We try to take positives away
from every game," VanDerveer
said. "I think our team is judged
more by how we do in the NCAAs,
so every game is, for us, getting
ready for the NCAA tournament."
