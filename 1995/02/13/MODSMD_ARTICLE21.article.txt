## Baseball drops home series to Bulldogs 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Stanford 2 0 4

It's not easy being number one.
That's what the top-ranked Stan
ford baseball team found out over the
weekend as No. 26 Fresno State (6-1)
traveled to Sunken Diamond and
took two of three games from the
Cardinal (5-4) in impressive fashion.
The Bulldogs' pitching staff domi
nated the Stanford lineup all week
end as the Cardinal, which managed
just six runs in the three-game set,
will probably lose its high ranking
when a new poll is released today.
Fresno State's top two starters —
Kevin Gunther and Brandon Behn —
needed almost no help in dismantling
the Stanford offense in the series'
first two games. The Cardinal,
behind a standout performance from
left-hander junior Mike Bobbins, sal
vaged the final game of the series 4-2.
"Obviously, we're not the best
team in the nation right now," said
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess.
"But we're still a solid team that can
do pretty well. Sometimes you don't
play well because of the opposition."

With seven shutout innings yesterday, junior southpaw Mike Robbins recorded his
first win of 1995. Stanford dropped the first two games of the series against the Bull
dogs and is now 5-4 on the season.
