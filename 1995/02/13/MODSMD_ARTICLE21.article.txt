## Baseball drops home series to Bulldogs 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Stanford 2 0 4

It's not easy being number one.
That's what the top-ranked Stan
ford baseball team found out over the
weekend as No. 26 Fresno State (6-1)
traveled to Sunken Diamond and
took two of three games from the
Cardinal (5-4) in impressive fashion.
The Bulldogs' pitching staff domi
nated the Stanford lineup all week
end as the Cardinal, which managed
just six runs in the three-game set,
will probably lose its high ranking
when a new poll is released today.
Fresno State's top two starters —
Kevin Gunther and Brandon Behn —
needed almost no help in dismantling
the Stanford offense in the series'
first two games. The Cardinal,
behind a standout performance from
left-hander junior Mike Bobbins, sal
vaged the final game of the series 4-2.
"Obviously, we're not the best
team in the nation right now," said
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess.
"But we're still a solid team that can
do pretty well. Sometimes you don't
play well because of the opposition."


Edgar Holmann — Daily
With seven shutout innings yesterday, junior southpaw Mike Robbins recorded his
first win of 1995. Stanford dropped the first two games of the series against the Bull
dogs and is now 5-4 on the season.
That opposition came in the
form of a Fresno State team
which has gotten off to their best
start in school history. The Bull
dogs have made it to post-season
play for seven consecutive years
and, judging from the early
going, 1995 should be no excep
tion.
Gunther worked well into the
ninth as the Bulldogs captured a
3-2 nail-biter on Friday afternoon
before Behn fired a complete
game shutout — the first of his
college career — in a 6-0 Fresno
State win on Saturday.
"It feels really good to shut
down the top team in the nation,"
Behn said. "It's something that
I've always dreamed about. I'll
remember this for the rest of my
life."
Cardinal bats managed just
five hits off Behn on Saturday and
never mounted a serious threat.
Stanford starter sophomore
Jason Middlebrook matched Behn
in the early going but Fresno
State was able to rally for all the
offense that it would need in the
top of the fifth inning.
The Bulldogs scored three runs
in that fateful inning without the
benefit of having a ball leave the
infield grass. Left fielder Chad
Brown led off the inning with a
weak single to third base before
advancing to third on a rare
throwing error from Stanford
junior catcher A.J. Hinch. After
that, everything seemed to unrav
el for the Cardinal, which was

shut out for the first time since
April 5, 1994.
Another infield hit and a Josh
Kaitfors bunt that went for a sin
gle loaded the bases with nobody
out. A Middlebrook wild pitch and
a James Borges' RBI groundout
gave the Bulldogs a 3-0 lead and
put them well on their way to
their sixth win of the year.
"We'd been hitting some balls
pretty hard in the early going and
getting nothing out of it," Behn
said. "I didn't expect that we'd
finally break through with a few
weak hits but, if that's what it
takes, we'll take it."
Behn held the Cardinal in
check all afternoon, not allowing
a Stanford runner to reach third
base.
"You come into a place like this
and a lot of people on the team —
especially the younger ones — are
in awe," Borges said. "To beat a
great team like this should do
wonders for our confidence."
And Borges should know a lit
tle something about confidence.
He provided the heroics in the
Bulldogs' series-opening win on
Friday afternoon with the win
ning base-hit in the ninth inning.
Borges — who had failed to
bunt in a crucial situation earlier
in the game — laced a two-run
double off Stanford starter junior
Dan Reed to the corner in right
field with two outs in the ninth to
break open a tie game and deal
the Cardinal a 3-2 loss.
Reed and Gunther, the Fresno
State starter, matched pitch for
pitch as each hurler worked well
into the ninth inning. Reed
allowed just one unearned run
and three hits through eight
innings but began to tire in the

ninth.
After striking out the first two
batters of the inning on just seven
pitches, things began to unravel
for the left-handed Cardinal ace.
Designated hitter Giuseppe
Chiaramonte and catcher Matt
Curtis each laced solid singles to
left field before Borges provided
the Bulldogs' first — and costliest
— extra base hit of the game to
put Stanford behind 3-1.
But, as has been the norm for
the Cardinal in 1995, the Stan
ford offense made a valiant come
back attempt in the bottom of the
ninth, nearly giving Stanford its
third ninth-inning comeback win
of the season.
Hinch got things started with a
one-out single before junior Troy
Kent singled to left and sopho
more shortstop Eric Sees walked
to load the bases with two outs.
Sophomore Chris Clark then
stepped to the plate with a chance
to be the hero and nearly succeed
ed, belting a grounder back
through the box for a run-scoring
single.
But Bulldogs' second baseman
Jim Fisher knocked the ball down
and threw to the plate. The ball
made it there before junior pinch
runner Rich Crowe, who was run
ning for the game tying score,
could get within 10 feet.
"I don't think that was a bad
decision [by Crowe]," Marquess
said. "There were two outs in the
inning and the ball was hit back
up the middle. He thought that he
could score."
But Crowe was out by a coun
try mile and the Cardinal was
forced to swallow a narrow loss.
Gunther chalked up the win after
working eight and two-thirds

innings, scattering seven hits
while striking out three.
Robbins helped Stanford sal
vage a victory on Sunday and kept
the Cardinal from dropping below
.500 for the first time in over a
year.
"As a staff we pitched pretty
well all weekend," Robbins said.
"I was fortunate enough to have
some great defense and get a
win."
The southpaw pitched seven
scoreless innings and the Stan
ford bats finally provided some
support as the Cardinal built an
early lead and cruised to its fifth
win of the year.
Junior second baseman Brian
Dallimore led off the bottom of
the first with a double and came
around to score on senior Steve
Carver's RBI double to right field.
Kent, making his first start of the
year at first base, laced a two-out
single to put Stanford up 2-0.
Robbins did the rest of the
work, allowing just six hits in
seven and a third innings to pick
up the win. Sophomore Brendan
Sullivan retired the final three
Bulldogs with the bases loaded in
the ninth to record his first save
of the year.
On a weekend in which all
three Stanford starters pitched
exceptionally, the hitters man
aged a meager .204 average as
Fresno State snapped a nine
game losing streak against the
Cardinal.
"Last weekend it was the
pitching staff that really strug
gled and the offense put up big
numbers," Robbins said. "We
know that we can't point fingers.
You don't win championships
that way."

going, 1995 should be no excep
tion.
Gunther worked well into the
ninth as the Bulldogs captured a
3-2 nail-biter on Friday afternoon
before Behn fired a complete
game shutout — the first of his
college career — in a 6-0 Fresno
State win on Saturday.
"It feels really good to shut
down the top team in the nation,"
Behn said. "It's something that
I've always dreamed about. I'll
remember this for the rest of my
life."
Cardinal bats managed just
five hits off Behn on Saturday and
never mounted a serious threat.
Stanford starter sophomore
Jason Middlebrook matched Behn
in the early going but Fresno
State was able to rally for all the
offense that it would need in the
top of the fifth inning.
The Bulldogs scored three runs
in that fateful inning without the
benefit of having a ball leave the
infield grass. Left fielder Chad
Brown led off the inning with a
weak single to third base before
advancing to third on a rare
throwing error from Stanford
junior catcher A.J. Hinch. After
that, everything seemed to unrav
el for the Cardinal, which was

shut out for the first time since
April 5, 1994.
Another infield hit and a Josh
Kaitfors bunt that went for a sin
gle loaded the bases with nobody
out. A Middlebrook wild pitch and
a James Borges' RBI groundout
gave the Bulldogs a 3-0 lead and
put them well on their way to
their sixth win of the year.
"We'd been hitting some balls
pretty hard in the early going and
getting nothing out of it," Behn
said. "I didn't expect that we'd
finally break through with a few
weak hits but, if that's what it
takes, we'll take it."
Behn held the Cardinal in
check all afternoon, not allowing
a Stanford runner to reach third
base.
"You come into a place like this
and a lot of people on the team —
especially the younger ones — are
in awe," Borges said. "To beat a
great team like this should do
wonders for our confidence."
And Borges should know a lit
tle something about confidence.
He provided the heroics in the
Bulldogs' series-opening win on
Friday afternoon with the win
ning base-hit in the ninth inning.
Borges — who had failed to
bunt in a crucial situation earlier
in the game — laced a two-run
double off Stanford starter junior
Dan Reed to the corner in right
field with two outs in the ninth to
break open a tie game and deal
the Cardinal a 3-2 loss.
Reed and Gunther, the Fresno
State starter, matched pitch for
pitch as each hurler worked well
into the ninth inning. Reed
allowed just one unearned run
and three hits through eight
innings but began to tire in the

ninth.
After striking out the first two
batters of the inning on just seven
pitches, things began to unravel
for the left-handed Cardinal ace.
Designated hitter Giuseppe
Chiaramonte and catcher Matt
Curtis each laced solid singles to
left field before Borges provided
the Bulldogs' first — and costliest
— extra base hit of the game to
put Stanford behind 3-1.
But, as has been the norm for
the Cardinal in 1995, the Stan
ford offense made a valiant come
back attempt in the bottom of the
ninth, nearly giving Stanford its
third ninth-inning comeback win
of the season.
Hinch got things started with a
one-out single before junior Troy
Kent singled to left and sopho
more shortstop Eric Sees walked
to load the bases with two outs.
Sophomore Chris Clark then
stepped to the plate with a chance
to be the hero and nearly succeed
ed, belting a grounder back
through the box for a run-scoring
single.
But Bulldogs' second baseman
Jim Fisher knocked the ball down
and threw to the plate. The ball
made it there before junior pinch
runner Rich Crowe, who was run
ning for the game tying score,
could get within 10 feet.
"I don't think that was a bad
decision [by Crowe]," Marquess
said. "There were two outs in the
inning and the ball was hit back
up the middle. He thought that he
could score."
But Crowe was out by a coun
try mile and the Cardinal was
forced to swallow a narrow loss.
Gunther chalked up the win after
working eight and two-thirds

innings, scattering seven hits
while striking out three.
Robbins helped Stanford sal
vage a victory on Sunday and kept
the Cardinal from dropping below
.500 for the first time in over a
year.
"As a staff we pitched pretty
well all weekend," Robbins said.
"I was fortunate enough to have
some great defense and get a
win."
The southpaw pitched seven
scoreless innings and the Stan
ford bats finally provided some
support as the Cardinal built an
early lead and cruised to its fifth
win of the year.
Junior second baseman Brian
Dallimore led off the bottom of
the first with a double and came
around to score on senior Steve
Carver's RBI double to right field.
Kent, making his first start of the
year at first base, laced a two-out
single to put Stanford up 2-0.
Robbins did the rest of the
work, allowing just six hits in
seven and a third innings to pick
up the win. Sophomore Brendan
Sullivan retired the final three
Bulldogs with the bases loaded in
the ninth to record his first save
of the year.
On a weekend in which all
three Stanford starters pitched
exceptionally, the hitters man
aged a meager .204 average as
Fresno State snapped a nine
game losing streak against the
Cardinal.
"Last weekend it was the
pitching staff that really strug
gled and the offense put up big
numbers," Robbins said. "We
know that we can't point fingers.
You don't win championships
that way."
Stanford 2 0 4

It's not easy being number one.
That's what the top-ranked Stan
ford baseball team found out over the
weekend as No. 26 Fresno State (6-1)
traveled to Sunken Diamond and
took two of three games from the
Cardinal (5-4) in impressive fashion.
The Bulldogs' pitching staff domi
nated the Stanford lineup all week
end as the Cardinal, which managed
just six runs in the three-game set,
will probably lose its high ranking
when a new poll is released today.
Fresno State's top two starters —
Kevin Gunther and Brandon Behn —
needed almost no help in dismantling
the Stanford offense in the series'
first two games. The Cardinal,
behind a standout performance from
left-hander junior Mike Bobbins, sal
vaged the final game of the series 4-2.
"Obviously, we're not the best
team in the nation right now," said
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess.
"But we're still a solid team that can
do pretty well. Sometimes you don't
play well because of the opposition."


Edgar Holmann — Daily
With seven shutout innings yesterday, junior southpaw Mike Robbins recorded his
first win of 1995. Stanford dropped the first two games of the series against the Bull
dogs and is now 5-4 on the season.
That opposition came in the
form of a Fresno State team
which has gotten off to their best
start in school history. The Bull
dogs have made it to post-season
play for seven consecutive years
and, judging from the early
going, 1995 should be no excep
tion.
