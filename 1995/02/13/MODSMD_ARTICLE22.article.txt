# Mental mistakes costly for top-ranked Cardinal

When you're number one, teams are
always gunning for you.
The top-ranked Stanford baseball
team (5-4) again won one of three week
end games. So far this season, the Cardi
nal has failed to live up to its preseason
billing.
Fresno State (6-1) used strong pitch
ing and timely hitting to win two games
this weekend. The Bulldogs also got a lit
tle help from Stanford.
The execution by the Cardinal during
the three-game set was wanting. Mental
and physical errors doomed Stanford in
the first two games, especially in the
series opener.
Fresno State won that game, 3-2,
with the help of Cardinal base running

and fielding errors, clutch hitting and
luck. Stanford, however, had many
chances for the win but handed the Bull
dogs the game.
The first run for Fresno State, on Fri
day, came during the third inning. Stan
ford shortstop Eric Sees cleanly picked
up a routine grounder and promptly
threw it almost into the stands. Jim
Fisher was awarded second on the over
throw and was singled in by the Bull
dogs' number nine hitter, Ben Reynoso.
The second major incident occurred
two innings later. Stanford was batting
in the bottom of the fifth when center
fielder Cale Carter singled to right . The
next batter, left fielder Troy Kent , dou
bled into the gap in left center to drive
home the first run of the game for the
Cardinal. Kent then took third and bad
luck struck Stanford.

The Cardinal had on a contact play
with the runner on third and only one
out. With the Fresno State infield in,
Kent was to go home on any contact that
the batter, Chris Clark, would make. The
only way Kent could get thrown out was
on a comebacker to the pitcher. Kevin
Gunther, the Bulldogs hurler, got exact
ly that.
Kent was gunned down on the field
er's choice and the Cardinal rally was
snuffed. Another instance of mental
errors on the base paths happened in the
sixth inning. Joe Kilburg, playing third
base for Stanford, reached on a line drive
to center. He then missed two steal signs
which did not please the Cardinal coach
ing staff. When he made an error in the
top of the seventh, it only served to exac-
