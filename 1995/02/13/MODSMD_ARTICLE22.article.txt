# Mental mistakes costly for top-ranked Cardinal
## 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
When you're number one, teams are
always gunning for you.
The top-ranked Stanford baseball
team (5-4) again won one of three week
end games. So far this season, the Cardi
nal has failed to live up to its preseason
billing.
Fresno State (6-1) used strong pitch
ing and timely hitting to win two games
this weekend. The Bulldogs also got a lit
tle help from Stanford.
The execution by the Cardinal during
the three-game set was wanting. Mental
and physical errors doomed Stanford in
the first two games, especially in the
series opener.
Fresno State won that game, 3-2,
with the help of Cardinal base running

and fielding errors, clutch hitting and
luck. Stanford, however, had many
chances for the win but handed the Bull
dogs the game.
The first run for Fresno State, on Fri
day, came during the third inning. Stan
ford shortstop Eric Sees cleanly picked
up a routine grounder and promptly
threw it almost into the stands. Jim
Fisher was awarded second on the over
throw and was singled in by the Bull
dogs' number nine hitter, Ben Reynoso.
The second major incident occurred
two innings later. Stanford was batting
in the bottom of the fifth when center
fielder Cale Carter singled to right . The
next batter, left fielder Troy Kent , dou
bled into the gap in left center to drive
home the first run of the game for the
Cardinal. Kent then took third and bad
luck struck Stanford.

The Cardinal had on a contact play
with the runner on third and only one
out. With the Fresno State infield in,
Kent was to go home on any contact that
the batter, Chris Clark, would make. The
only way Kent could get thrown out was
on a comebacker to the pitcher. Kevin
Gunther, the Bulldogs hurler, got exact
ly that.
Kent was gunned down on the field
er's choice and the Cardinal rally was
snuffed. Another instance of mental
errors on the base paths happened in the
sixth inning. Joe Kilburg, playing third
base for Stanford, reached on a line drive
to center. He then missed two steal signs
which did not please the Cardinal coach
ing staff. When he made an error in the
top of the seventh, it only served to exac-
erbate the staff more. He was
removed to start the eighth inning.
The final coup de grace for Stan
ford took place in the bottom of the
ninth with the Cardinal down 3-1.
Starting pitcher Dan Reed, who
performed brilliantly all game, had
just given up two runs in the top of
the ninth. Stanford needed a rally,
as it had done twice before, to win
the game.
A. J. Hinch singled with one out
but was cut down on a ground ball
force out by Carter. Kent then sin
gled to right, sending Carter to
third. Rich Crowe then came in to
pinch run for Kent as Shorty Far
fan entered the game as the new
pitcher for Fresno State.
Farfan then walked Sees to load
the bases and the Cardinal fans
anticipated some more late-inning
heroics. Clark hit a grounder into
the hole between short and third for
an infield single to plate Carter but
amazingly, Crowe also attempted to
score. Not surprisingly, with the
base runner's name neither Cool
Papa Bell nor Rickey Henderson, he
was thrown out at home to end the

game.
The second game was worse in
that Stanford was obviously out
played. Jason Middlebrook, the
vaunted sophomore, was out
pitched by fellow sophomore Bren
dan Behn and the vaunted Cardinal
was out-hit by the underrated Bull
dogs. Fresno State shut out Stan
ford, 6-0.
"I didn't try to do anything dif
ferently than I normally do," Behn
said. "I knew I would be pitching
against Middlebrook and winning
against him made me feel a little bit
better."
Cardinal coach Mark Marquess
acknowledged that Stanford has
not lived up to its ranking.
"We've made a couple of mis
takes," Marquess said. "Obviously
we're not the number one team in
the nation."
Much of the preseason hype was
centered on the Cardinal pitching
staff, which has also had its share of
problems. The squad's ERA is up
around five but Marquess warns
that it is still early in the season.
"The [ERA] is way up because of
last weekend," he said, alluding to
the high scoring games against Cal-
State Fullerton. "We've only played
a few games. Just wait a couple of
weeks and see what it is then."
