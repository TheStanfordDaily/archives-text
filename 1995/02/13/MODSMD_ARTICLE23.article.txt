TEMPE, Ariz. â€” All in all, the Stanford men's basket
ball team's jaunt through Arizona didn't provide too
much fun in the sun. The Cardinal certainly could
have used some of that All-Star cheer which was more
than ample this weekend in Phoenix. But despite the
festivities surrounding the NBA All-Star weekend,
Stanford (15-5 overall, 6-5 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) didn't have much reason to be happy.
Thursday night in Tucson, the 15th-ranked Cardi
nal suffered a 84-73 loss to Arizona, and on Saturday
against the 14th-ranked Arizona State Sun Devils (18-
5 overall, 8-3 Pac-10), the team's poor fortune contin
ued as it fell 79-70.
"We laid it on the line these last two games," said
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery. "We really
worked hard to give ourselves a chance to win, and we
were right there. But we just couldn't finish it off.
Tough road trip, no question. We were hoping to get at
least one, we had an opportunity in both, but didn't
|win]. We have to play better to win."
The play started out anything but All-Star as both
teams shot less than 32 percent from the field in the
first half. In fact, with just over nine minutes left
before halflime, the score remained just 13-12, Stan
ford. The pace stayed sickly with Arizona State ahead
28-24 at the break.
The second half, however, was an entirely different
story. Stanford shot 53.8 percent. The only downside
was that it couldn't do much to stop the scorching Sun
Devils, who hit 64 percent of their field goals.
"It's a matter of team defense," said sophomore
Stanford guard Brevin Knight. "When someone drives
into the lane, someone has to step over and take the
charge. We're not doing anything to stop anyone.
We're not helping anywhere. We're just not getting
anything done."
The Cardinal came out of the locker room gunning
and seized a momentary five-point lead off of a three
pointer by junior guard Dion Cross, a slashing lay-in by
Knight, a running hook by freshman center Tim
Young and two free throws by junior forward Darren
Allaway. Everyone, it seemed, was getting into the
action.
Unfortunately for Stanford, that would eventually
