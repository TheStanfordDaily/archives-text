Arizona State 79

TEMPE, Ariz. — All in all, the Stanford men's basket
ball team's jaunt through Arizona didn't provide too
much fun in the sun. The Cardinal certainly could
have used some of that All-Star cheer which was more
than ample this weekend in Phoenix. But despite the
festivities surrounding the NBA All-Star weekend,
Stanford (15-5 overall, 6-5 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) didn't have much reason to be happy.
Thursday night in Tucson, the 15th-ranked Cardi
nal suffered a 84-73 loss to Arizona, and on Saturday
against the 14th-ranked Arizona State Sun Devils (18-
5 overall, 8-3 Pac-10), the team's poor fortune contin
ued as it fell 79-70.
"We laid it on the line these last two games," said
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery. "We really
worked hard to give ourselves a chance to win, and we
were right there. But we just couldn't finish it off.
Tough road trip, no question. We were hoping to get at
least one, we had an opportunity in both, but didn't
|win]. We have to play better to win."
The play started out anything but All-Star as both
teams shot less than 32 percent from the field in the
first half. In fact, with just over nine minutes left
before halflime, the score remained just 13-12, Stan
ford. The pace stayed sickly with Arizona State ahead
28-24 at the break.
The second half, however, was an entirely different
story. Stanford shot 53.8 percent. The only downside
was that it couldn't do much to stop the scorching Sun
Devils, who hit 64 percent of their field goals.
"It's a matter of team defense," said sophomore
Stanford guard Brevin Knight. "When someone drives
into the lane, someone has to step over and take the
charge. We're not doing anything to stop anyone.
We're not helping anywhere. We're just not getting
anything done."
The Cardinal came out of the locker room gunning
and seized a momentary five-point lead off of a three
pointer by junior guard Dion Cross, a slashing lay-in by
Knight, a running hook by freshman center Tim
Young and two free throws by junior forward Darren
Allaway. Everyone, it seemed, was getting into the
action.
Unfortunately for Stanford, that would eventually
include the Sun Devils. Arizona
State went on a 24-7 tear in the
next six-and-a-half minutes to
seize a 52-40 lead. The run was
capped by a tremendous individual
effort from Sun Devil forward
Quincy Brewer, who stripped Pop
pink of the ball off an in-bounds
pass and then dunked it home.
There was still fight left in the
Cardinal, however. Three-point
bombs by Cross, who, along with
his backcourt mate Knight, fin
ished with a game-high 20 points,
cut the lead to five twice. Pop
pink's lay-in with just over three
minutes left to play tightened the
game to 64-61.
Then came Play of the Game I.
With Arizona State clinging to the
slim three-point lead, Sun Devil
guard Isaac Burton, over Cross's
outstretched arms, let loose an
ungodly, spinning, 22-foot three
point shot that found nothing but
net.
"In a critical situation, Burton
hits an impossible three from
deep," Montgomery said. "Every
time we get close enough to get in a
one possession situation, [the lead |
balloons up to five or seven on a
bizarre play."
Play of the Game II occurred
about two minutes after that. ASU
guard Marcell Capers, with 46 sec
onds left to play, was sent to the
charity stripe with the Sun Devils
up 73-68. Capers sunk the first
free throw but missed the second.
His partner in crime, Sun Devil
forward James Bacon was more
than happy, however, to pull down
the rebound and put it back in, giv
ing Arizona State an insurmount
able 76-68 lead.
"I just went out and tried to
play hard like I do all the time,"
Bacon said. "Today, I was at the
right place in the right time and
got a couple of key plays."
Entering the contest, the Cardi
nal felt that the two main keys to
success would be handling the
ASU press and Sun Devil junior
center Mario Bennett, who had 31
points the previous night against

Cal. Stanford kept both under
wraps.
While the Cardinal did struggle
a few instances with inbounding
the ball and getting it upcourt, Ari
zona State forced as many
turnovers as they gave up, seven in
the first half and 14 total.
As for Bennett, a prospective
draft-jumper who had the opportu
nity to show off his wares in front
of 17 NBA scouts, the Sun Devil
big man had his fair share of plays
but in the long-run displayed
mostly his room for improvement.
Bumped and hammered early on,
Bennett failed to get his first buck
et until 1:10 was left in the first
half, and he finished the game with
just 11 points. He did pull down 10
boards, however, and created his
usual havoc on the defensive end
by blocking seven shots.
By shackling Bennett with dou
ble teams though, a few of his fel
low Sun Devils burst through with
big games.
"We set out to try to minimize
Bennett," Montgomery said. "We
did that. How much that cost us, I
don't know.
"To Arizona State's credit, they
did a nice job of not panicking
when Bennett was not able to get
the ball. Of course, that gave the
opportunity for some of the other
guys to make plays."
Along with Bennett, five Sun
Devils scored in double figures
including Burton's team-high 19
points. Bacon had 11 points off the
bench, but more important, he
ended with seven rebounds, four
offensive. As a team, Arizona State
pounded through with 18 offensive
boards and outrebounded the Car
dinal 42-37.
"That's a risk you run," Mont
gomery said. "You're trying to
defend Bennett with help from a
second guy, and Bacon ends up
getting some offensive rebounds.
We knew that we ran the risk of
trying to help on Bennett of the
second man getting some offensive
rebounds."
A lot of those second chances —
Bacon's follow on Capers' missed
free throw, for instance — turned
the tide of the game. The Cardinal
only wishes it could get a second
chance.
