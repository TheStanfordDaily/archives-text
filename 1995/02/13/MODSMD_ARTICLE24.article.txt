Putting the perfect touch on an unde
feated dual-meet season, the Cardinal
women's swimming team blew away the
19th-ranked California Bears 209-90 last
Saturday. Top-ranked Stanford (8-0 over
all, 5-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference) won 12
of 14 swimming events, and even took first

in the three meter diving without two time
NCAA diver of the year Eileen Richetelli.
Stanford won easily without even using
its top swimmers and divers in its best
events. Senior Olympian Jenny Thompson
did not swim the sprint freestyle, but fresh
man Lindsay Gassner captured both events
handily. Gassner even beat sophomore
Claudia Franco, a member of the
Spanish Olympic team in 1992, in
the 50-yard freestyle to lead a sweep
of the Bears in that event.
"Lindsay Gassner swam a real
fast 100-yard freestyle," said head
coach Richard Quick. "She put her
self in a real good position to make
the NCAA championship meet at
the Pac-10 championships in two
weeks."
Other strong showings included
sophomore Megan Gardner, who
won the three meter diving with a
score of 270.75.
Junior Jessica Tong also swam
to impressive victories in the 100-
yard backstroke and the 500-yard
freestyle. Tong showed that Stan
ford could beat the Golden Bears in
the distance events even without
sophomore Sarah Anderson's
NCAA championship caliber times.
"Jessica rebounded after a tough
weekend in Texas [against SMU
and the University of Texas] to
swim real well for us," Quick said.
With such strong performances

from the whole team, Stanford is
clearly the favorite to win the Pac
-10 championships in two weeks.
"The value for us in the Cal meet
is as a tuneup for the NCAA cham
pionship meet," Quick said.
Very few swimming programs in
the country could take their top
swimmers out of their best events
against a top-20 team like Cal and
come up with such a sound defeat as
the Cardinal did last Saturday.
"The freshmen are looking real
strong," Quick said. "I was pleased
with Amy Oberhalmen's perfor
mance in the 1000-yard freestyle,
and Michelle Collin's 200-yard but
terfly was fast even though she took
second."
Stanford's freshmen and sopho
mores carried the team this week
end. Freshmen Becky Bicknell,
Gassner, Oberhelman and Collins
all won events at Cal and Thomp
son was the only Cardinal senior to
win an individual race, the 200-yard
individual medley.
"This is where I want to be at
this point in the season," Collins
said. "Now I'm looking to make the
NCAA championship cut at the
Pac-10 championships this week
end."
