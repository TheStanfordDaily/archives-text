(10-15, 15-9, 1-15, 15-12, 15-13) but fell to
the Rainbows on Saturday. Stanford won the
first contest despite tallying lower statistics
in every category.
"I thought we got out-played," said coach

example, Hawaii had 25 blocks compared to
our 11. We were very fortunate to win that

As the outcome of this weekend's Stanford
men's volleyball match proves, rankings
can't always be trusted. Despite entering into
this weekend at the No. 9 slot, the University
of Hawaii's men's volleyball outgunned sec
ond-ranked Stanford in two consecutive
duels.
The battered Cardinal still managed to

match."
The Cardinal's victory on Friday
drew mixed reactions from the
team. On the one hand, obvious
questions are raised about quality of
play and consistency after a match
in which an opponent clearly exe
cuted better. Nevertheless, Stan
ford did rally for the win.
"Hawaii out-hit us, out-dug us,
out-blocked us, and out-served us,
but somehow we pulled it out," said
senior middle blocker Brian Gar
rett. After a hard fought loss in the
first game, Stanford stormed back
in game two to take a commanding
10-0 lead before faltering. The Rain
bows clawed back to within four
before the Cardinal finally put them
away off the jump-serving of fresh
man swing hitter Devin Poolman.
Game three saw Stanford fall
extremely far behind due to a com
bination of errors and Hawaii's
strong jump-serving. Nieves then
juggled the Cardinal's lineup,
switching sophomore opposite hit

ter Matt Fuerbringer to a swing hit
ter position in the rotation and fill
ing the opposite position with 6-10
sophomore Brian Moore. This
change seemed to work as Stanford
battled to a win.
"With our old system," Nieves
said, "we were barely winning. So,
we started looking at alternatives.
After game three, it was clear that
we needed a change. It showed some
promise, but it's hard to say
whether it was what made the dif
ference."
The mental attitude that pushed
Stanford to victory on Friday night
seemed absent the next night when
Hawaii convincingly and soundly
defeated the Cardinal 15-4, 15-7,
15-8. The Rainbows took over
Burnham Pavilion with tenacious
defense, a sizzling offense and
strong jump-serves.
Hawaii's stars shined particular
ly bright in this match. Senior mid
dle blocker Jason Olive handcuffed
the Cardinal passers with his four
aces, while he also dominated at the
net. Freshman opposite hitter
Yuval Katz served two aces and hit
an astonishing .700, tallying 22 kills
for only one error.

As well as the Rainbows played,
sophomore setter Stewart Chong
pointed out Stanford's complicity in
boosting Hawaii's statistics.
"We made them look better than
they really were," Chong said.
"They have very good jump-servers,
but we have very good passers. We
made them look like they were No. 1
in the country because we weren't
concentrating."
The Cardinal's problems did not
end with its serve-receive. Stanford
hitters committed an uncharacter
istically high number of hitting
errors, ending up with a team hit
ting percentage of only .307 com
pared to its previous average of
.420. Also, Cardinal players perpe
trated many careless errors such as
net violations.
At times this season, Stanford
has played like one of the best teams
in the nation. Coming away from
this disappointing weekend, howev
er, the Cardinal must prove that it
can maintain that high level.
"The loss serves some use,"
Chong said, "It will help motivate us
to compete more everyday in prac
tice. It tells us that we can't just
keep on cruising and expect to win."
