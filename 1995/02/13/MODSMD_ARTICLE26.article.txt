Winning is not always everything.
The Stanford women's gymnastics team showed
flashes of its enormous capabilities during Friday
night's dual-meet loss to powerhouse Oregon State.
The Cardinal squad finished with an impressive
191.05 points despite two falls on the uneven bars.
However, the Beavers performed nearly flawlessly
en route to a stunning 193.775.
Stanford began the meet on bars and immedi
ately ran into some difficulties. Small judgment
errors on the part of the gymnasts caused the Car
dinal to count a fall.
"We were kind of tentative," said sophomore all
arounder Katie Jennings. "After the first fall,
everyone tightened up a bit."
From there Stanford moved to the vault, scoring
a 47.675. The team started to pull together, setting
up a record-breaking performance on the beam.
The beam has traditionally been a Stanford
strength, and this season is no exception.
"We happen to have recruited good talent, and
Lisa [Mitzel-Izzi] is a great beam coach," said Stan
ford head coach Breck Greenwood. "We're going to
be very good all the time on beam."
The beam squad of freshmen Keri Monahan,
Christie Jones and Misty Moore, sophomore Ariel
Passanisi and seniors Jene Elzie and Tina Snowden
highlighted the evening with outstanding routines.
The group racked up 48.475 points, shattering the
former team mark of 48.20, set last March.
"I was just trying to relax and concentrate on
one part of my routine at a time," Jones said.
The floor exercise produced some peculiar
results for the Cardinal. Although the gymnasts
were able to successfully implement new skills,
strange judging patterns left the squad feeling
somewhat slighted.
In particular, Snowden added an impressive
double back to her already strong routine and was
disappointed with her mark of 9.600.
"It was our best floor outing of the year, but it
definitely wasn't our best score," Greenwood said.
Elzie competed in the all-around for the first
time since spraining her knee during the season
opener, winning it with a score of 38.700. She
demonstrated why she has been Stanford's most
consistent and highest-scoring gymnast over the
last few years, registering marks no lower than
9.525 in any of the four events. The all-around vic
tory was her first ever at Oregon State.
