Stanford Tennis Stadium resembled a
Davis Cup venue this weekend as the pre
dominantly foreign No. 33 UNLV and No. 11
University of Miami men's tennis teams took
to the courts against an All-American squad
from top-ranked Stanford.
The American flag unfurled at the end of
the Stanford-Miami dual match by one fan in
attendance summed up the results of the
weekend — a 6-1 Cardinal defeat of the Run
ning Rebels on Friday, and a 7-0 shutout of
the highly touted Hurricanes on Saturday.
Saturday's match featured a much antici
pated meeting of the No. 1 and No. 6-ranked
players in the nation, Miami's Srdgan
Muskatirovic and Stanford's Jeff Salzen
stein. Salzenstein served well and volleyed
successfully on big points to defeat the
sophomore from Belgrade, Yugoslavia, 6-2,6-
3. Muskatirovic's normally strong serve was
adversely affected by a shoulder injury that
has plagued him all year. But Miami's head
coach, John Hammill, was unwilling to make
excuses for Muskatirovic.
"Once you take the court, you are pro
nounced fit," Hammill said.
Hammill also credited Salzenstein with
playing "excellent tennis," something the
junior was not so sure he would be capable of
going in to the match although he had defeat
ed UNLVs Tim Blenkiron the day before, 6-
4, 6-3.
"I've been struggling a little bit mentally
rather them physically," Salzenstein said,
referring to a slight but noticeable drop-off in
his level of play during last Wednesday's vic
toiy over San Jose State, a match which
immediately followed a 6-0, 6-1 loss to tennis
professional Jonathan Stark last Monday at
the Sybase Open. "It was good to get out and
compete against some good players and just
enjoy competing."
Stanford head coach Dick Gould
expressed satisfaction with the performance
of his team's captain, who came back from
being down 0-3 in the second set to win the
last six games of the match.
"Jeff did a great job of staying focused on
the match and not worrying about the other
guy coming back," Gould said. "He also
served a lot better than he had been serving,
which is something that's tough to come back

from mentally. JefT showed me a great deal of
mental toughness. You've got to have that
from your top players."
On the No. 2 court, Stanford's 33rd
ranked Scott Humphries defeated Miami's
1 lth-ranked Gil Kovelski, 6-4, 6-3. The
match was close throughout, with
Humphries pulling out one break in each of
the sets to gain the victory.
"Once I got the break early in the second
set, I knew I had the match under control,"
Humphries said, "because he wasn't winning
many points on my serve."
Ilammill, who played Davis Cup tennis for
South Africa, was impressed with the play of
Stanford's freshman phenom.
"Young Humphries came up with some
incredible shots at the right times," Hammill
said.
Humphries added that he was well
equipped to break Kovalski's tough lefty
serve because he had played against an Ital
ian Davis Cup player — southpaw Diego Nar
giso — last Monday in the Sybase Open, and
he had wanned up with the left-handed
Salzenstein prior to the match against Koval
ski.

Kovalski, a junior from Herzelia, Israel,
displayed his animation on the court, smil
ing, laughing and yelling at both himself and
the chair umpire. But his antics seemed to
help Humphries more than himself.
"Kovalski was definitely a character,"
Humphries said. "If anything, that relaxed
me because he was out there laughing."
Stanford's numbers three through six sin
gles players were involved in less thrilling
matchups than those at the top two positions
this weekend, as Miami and UNLV exhibited
a lack of depth in the bottom two-thirds of
their lineups.
