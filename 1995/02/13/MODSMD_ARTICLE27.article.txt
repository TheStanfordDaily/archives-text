Stanford 6
UNLV 1

Stanford Tennis Stadium resembled a
Davis Cup venue this weekend as the pre
dominantly foreign No. 33 UNLV and No. 11
University of Miami men's tennis teams took
to the courts against an All-American squad
from top-ranked Stanford.
The American flag unfurled at the end of
the Stanford-Miami dual match by one fan in
attendance summed up the results of the
weekend — a 6-1 Cardinal defeat of the Run
ning Rebels on Friday, and a 7-0 shutout of
the highly touted Hurricanes on Saturday.
Saturday's match featured a much antici
pated meeting of the No. 1 and No. 6-ranked
players in the nation, Miami's Srdgan
Muskatirovic and Stanford's Jeff Salzen
stein. Salzenstein served well and volleyed
successfully on big points to defeat the
sophomore from Belgrade, Yugoslavia, 6-2,6-
3. Muskatirovic's normally strong serve was
adversely affected by a shoulder injury that
has plagued him all year. But Miami's head
coach, John Hammill, was unwilling to make
excuses for Muskatirovic.
"Once you take the court, you are pro
nounced fit," Hammill said.
Hammill also credited Salzenstein with
playing "excellent tennis," something the
junior was not so sure he would be capable of
going in to the match although he had defeat
ed UNLVs Tim Blenkiron the day before, 6-
4, 6-3.
"I've been struggling a little bit mentally
rather them physically," Salzenstein said,
referring to a slight but noticeable drop-off in
his level of play during last Wednesday's vic
toiy over San Jose State, a match which
immediately followed a 6-0, 6-1 loss to tennis
professional Jonathan Stark last Monday at
the Sybase Open. "It was good to get out and
compete against some good players and just
enjoy competing."
Stanford head coach Dick Gould
expressed satisfaction with the performance
of his team's captain, who came back from
being down 0-3 in the second set to win the
last six games of the match.
"Jeff did a great job of staying focused on
the match and not worrying about the other
guy coming back," Gould said. "He also
served a lot better than he had been serving,
which is something that's tough to come back

from mentally. JefT showed me a great deal of
mental toughness. You've got to have that
from your top players."
On the No. 2 court, Stanford's 33rd
ranked Scott Humphries defeated Miami's
1 lth-ranked Gil Kovelski, 6-4, 6-3. The
match was close throughout, with
Humphries pulling out one break in each of
the sets to gain the victory.
"Once I got the break early in the second
set, I knew I had the match under control,"
Humphries said, "because he wasn't winning
many points on my serve."
Ilammill, who played Davis Cup tennis for
South Africa, was impressed with the play of
Stanford's freshman phenom.
"Young Humphries came up with some
incredible shots at the right times," Hammill
said.
Humphries added that he was well
equipped to break Kovalski's tough lefty
serve because he had played against an Ital
ian Davis Cup player — southpaw Diego Nar
giso — last Monday in the Sybase Open, and
he had wanned up with the left-handed
Salzenstein prior to the match against Koval
ski.

Kovalski, a junior from Herzelia, Israel,
displayed his animation on the court, smil
ing, laughing and yelling at both himself and
the chair umpire. But his antics seemed to
help Humphries more than himself.
"Kovalski was definitely a character,"
Humphries said. "If anything, that relaxed
me because he was out there laughing."
Stanford's numbers three through six sin
gles players were involved in less thrilling
matchups than those at the top two positions
this weekend, as Miami and UNLV exhibited
a lack of depth in the bottom two-thirds of
their lineups.
At No. 3, freshman Paul Goldstein dis
played an improved service game to defeat

UNLVs Luke Smith of Australia, 6-
3, 6-2, and Miami's Ray Schot of
Rockai\je, Holland, 6-1, 6-3.
In the fourth position, junior Jim
Thomas played the only three-set
match of the weekend, a 6-3, 3-6, 6-
1 victory over Runr- g Rebel Jules
Pohjola of Finlanu. rhen Thomas
battled back from a 1-4 deficit in the
first set against Miami's Janni Rom
of South Africa to win 6-4, 6-4.
Stanford's No. 5 player, sopho
more Grant Elliot suffered the only
loss of the weekend when a partially
dislocated shoulder forced him to
retire in the second set of a match in
which he held the 6-2, 0-3 lead
against UNLV's Rob Norton. The
separation, which occurred during
the weight transfer on Elliot's ball
toss, was sustained to his left (non
hitting) shoulder, and stemmed
from a shoulder injury last summer.
For his the next day's match
against Miami's Arturo Zizold,
Elliot was fitted with a harness that
prevented another dislocation by

allowing his arm to go up but not
back. After Elliot defeated Zizold 6-
3, 6-1, he said he will probably wear
the harness throughout the remain
der of the season.
Stanford's No. 6 singles player,
junior Ricky Becker, had an easy
weekend, defeating Running Rebel
Thomas Schrader of Brazil, 6-2,6-4,
and Miami's Chris Chiang, 6-3,6-1.
During the second set of his match
with Chiang, Becker won 18
straight points.
Stanford swept doubles action
this weekend, but not without a
fight from the Hurricanes, whose
tandem of Muskatirovic and Koval
ski are ranked fifth in the nation.
They were defeated by the lesser
ranked duo of Humphries and Gold
stein 9-8 (9-7), though the two Car
dinal freshman are likely to be
ranked No. 1 nationally when the
new poll is released on March 7.
After the Hurricane pair broke
Humphries to take a 7-6 lead,
Humphries began to play with
added intensity, electing to unload
with forehands on shots that he was
volleying earlier in the match.
"We had been relieved to get
back even at 6-6, but then I got bro

ken," Humphries said. "Then both
Paul and I stepped up our games at
that point."
The Stanford tandem then
returned the break and Goldstein
forced a tie-breaker by holding his
serve. In the tie-break, Miami
jumped out to a quick 3-0 lead but
Stanford kept it close and was able
to fight off a match point at 5-6 with
a good Goldstein serve. With
Humphries serving four points
later, Goldstein closed out the
match with a successful volley.
From the time their match score
stood at 7-7, Humphries and Gold
stein were able to play with the lux
ury of knowing that their match
would not decide the doubles point
because Stanford had already won
at the Nos. 2 and 3 positions. The
No. 3 team of Salzenstein and Elliot
defeated Zizold and Chiang, 8-2,
and the No. 2 tandem of Thomas
and Becker defeated Schot and
Rom, 8-5, in a close match.
"It was our hardest earned dou
bles point of the year," Becker said.
"So after doubles we thought sin
gles would be a real dogfight, but we
played well enough down the line to
prevent that scenario."

at the Nos. 2 and 3 positions. The
No. 3 team of Salzenstein and Elliot
defeated Zizold and Chiang, 8-2,
and the No. 2 tandem of Thomas
and Becker defeated Schot and
Rom, 8-5, in a close match.
"It was our hardest earned dou
bles point of the year," Becker said.
"So after doubles we thought sin
gles would be a real dogfight, but we
played well enough down the line to
prevent that scenario."
Stanford 6
UNLV 1

Stanford Tennis Stadium resembled a
Davis Cup venue this weekend as the pre
dominantly foreign No. 33 UNLV and No. 11
University of Miami men's tennis teams took
to the courts against an All-American squad
from top-ranked Stanford.
The American flag unfurled at the end of
the Stanford-Miami dual match by one fan in
attendance summed up the results of the
weekend — a 6-1 Cardinal defeat of the Run
ning Rebels on Friday, and a 7-0 shutout of
the highly touted Hurricanes on Saturday.
Saturday's match featured a much antici
pated meeting of the No. 1 and No. 6-ranked
players in the nation, Miami's Srdgan
Muskatirovic and Stanford's Jeff Salzen
stein. Salzenstein served well and volleyed
successfully on big points to defeat the
sophomore from Belgrade, Yugoslavia, 6-2,6-
3. Muskatirovic's normally strong serve was
adversely affected by a shoulder injury that
has plagued him all year. But Miami's head
coach, John Hammill, was unwilling to make
excuses for Muskatirovic.
"Once you take the court, you are pro
nounced fit," Hammill said.
Hammill also credited Salzenstein with
playing "excellent tennis," something the
junior was not so sure he would be capable of
going in to the match although he had defeat
ed UNLVs Tim Blenkiron the day before, 6-
4, 6-3.
"I've been struggling a little bit mentally
rather them physically," Salzenstein said,
referring to a slight but noticeable drop-off in
his level of play during last Wednesday's vic
toiy over San Jose State, a match which
immediately followed a 6-0, 6-1 loss to tennis
professional Jonathan Stark last Monday at
the Sybase Open. "It was good to get out and
compete against some good players and just
enjoy competing."
Stanford head coach Dick Gould
expressed satisfaction with the performance
of his team's captain, who came back from
being down 0-3 in the second set to win the
last six games of the match.
"Jeff did a great job of staying focused on
the match and not worrying about the other
guy coming back," Gould said. "He also
served a lot better than he had been serving,
which is something that's tough to come back

from mentally. JefT showed me a great deal of
mental toughness. You've got to have that
from your top players."
On the No. 2 court, Stanford's 33rd
ranked Scott Humphries defeated Miami's
1 lth-ranked Gil Kovelski, 6-4, 6-3. The
match was close throughout, with
Humphries pulling out one break in each of
the sets to gain the victory.
"Once I got the break early in the second
set, I knew I had the match under control,"
Humphries said, "because he wasn't winning
many points on my serve."
Ilammill, who played Davis Cup tennis for
South Africa, was impressed with the play of
Stanford's freshman phenom.
"Young Humphries came up with some
incredible shots at the right times," Hammill
said.
Humphries added that he was well
equipped to break Kovalski's tough lefty
serve because he had played against an Ital
ian Davis Cup player — southpaw Diego Nar
giso — last Monday in the Sybase Open, and
he had wanned up with the left-handed
Salzenstein prior to the match against Koval
ski.

Kovalski, a junior from Herzelia, Israel,
displayed his animation on the court, smil
ing, laughing and yelling at both himself and
the chair umpire. But his antics seemed to
help Humphries more than himself.
"Kovalski was definitely a character,"
Humphries said. "If anything, that relaxed
me because he was out there laughing."
Stanford's numbers three through six sin
gles players were involved in less thrilling
matchups than those at the top two positions
this weekend, as Miami and UNLV exhibited
a lack of depth in the bottom two-thirds of
their lineups.
At No. 3, freshman Paul Goldstein dis
played an improved service game to defeat

Freshman Paul Goldstein unleashes a powerful serve.
UNLVs Luke Smith of Australia, 6-
3, 6-2, and Miami's Ray Schot of
Rockai\je, Holland, 6-1, 6-3.
In the fourth position, junior Jim
Thomas played the only three-set
match of the weekend, a 6-3, 3-6, 6-
1 victory over Runr- g Rebel Jules
Pohjola of Finlanu. rhen Thomas
battled back from a 1-4 deficit in the
first set against Miami's Janni Rom
of South Africa to win 6-4, 6-4.
Stanford's No. 5 player, sopho
more Grant Elliot suffered the only
loss of the weekend when a partially
dislocated shoulder forced him to
retire in the second set of a match in
which he held the 6-2, 0-3 lead
against UNLV's Rob Norton. The
separation, which occurred during
the weight transfer on Elliot's ball
toss, was sustained to his left (non
hitting) shoulder, and stemmed
from a shoulder injury last summer.
For his the next day's match
against Miami's Arturo Zizold,
Elliot was fitted with a harness that
prevented another dislocation by

allowing his arm to go up but not
back. After Elliot defeated Zizold 6-
3, 6-1, he said he will probably wear
the harness throughout the remain
der of the season.
Stanford's No. 6 singles player,
junior Ricky Becker, had an easy
weekend, defeating Running Rebel
Thomas Schrader of Brazil, 6-2,6-4,
and Miami's Chris Chiang, 6-3,6-1.
During the second set of his match
with Chiang, Becker won 18
straight points.
Stanford swept doubles action
this weekend, but not without a
fight from the Hurricanes, whose
tandem of Muskatirovic and Koval
ski are ranked fifth in the nation.
They were defeated by the lesser
ranked duo of Humphries and Gold
stein 9-8 (9-7), though the two Car
dinal freshman are likely to be
ranked No. 1 nationally when the
new poll is released on March 7.
After the Hurricane pair broke
Humphries to take a 7-6 lead,
Humphries began to play with
added intensity, electing to unload
with forehands on shots that he was
volleying earlier in the match.
"We had been relieved to get
back even at 6-6, but then I got bro

ken," Humphries said. "Then both
Paul and I stepped up our games at
that point."
The Stanford tandem then
returned the break and Goldstein
forced a tie-breaker by holding his
serve. In the tie-break, Miami
jumped out to a quick 3-0 lead but
Stanford kept it close and was able
to fight off a match point at 5-6 with
a good Goldstein serve. With
Humphries serving four points
later, Goldstein closed out the
match with a successful volley.
From the time their match score
stood at 7-7, Humphries and Gold
stein were able to play with the lux
ury of knowing that their match
would not decide the doubles point
because Stanford had already won
at the Nos. 2 and 3 positions. The
No. 3 team of Salzenstein and Elliot
defeated Zizold and Chiang, 8-2,
and the No. 2 tandem of Thomas
