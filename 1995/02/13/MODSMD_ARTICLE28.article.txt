# Baseball turns to Division II foe
## 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
What do you do when you're
ranked No. 1 in the nation but
have lost four of your first nine
games?
You schedule a Division II
team.
Such is the situation for the
top-ranked Cardinal baseball
squad which hosts Cal State-Los
Angeles of the California Colle
giate Athletic Association this
afternoon at Sunken Diamond at
2 p.m.
After dropping two of three

games in a weekend series against
Fresno State, Stanford (5-4) looks
to rebound against the Golden
Eagles (2-3). Cal State-L.A. has
never beaten the Cardinal and
brings a squad riddled with
underclassmen to Palo Alto.
"We have a lot of new, talented
faces in many spots," said Golden
Eagle head coach John Herbold, a
Stanford graduate. "We have a
pitching staff capable of good
things complemented by a great
catching staff. .. . Time will tell
with this young squad."
Cal State-L.A.'s roster includes
an incredible 17 freshmen and

sophomores and just four seniors.
The Golden Eagles lost 13 play
ers, including four starters, from
last year's team, which finished
fourth in its conference.
The Cardinal will send herald
ed freshman Kyle Peterson to the
mound today against the Golden
Eagles' Doug DeLaGarza. Peter
son has started one game already
for Stanford in 1995, coming up
with a no decision in a 7-4 win
over the Sacramento State Hor
nets last week.
Peterson has worked a total of
nine and a third innings for the
Cardinal this season, allowing

seven earned runs while striking
out five.
On the other side of the
matchup, DeLaGarza is one of the
senior leaders for the Golden
Eagles. The southpaw has posted
a 3.86 earned run average while
striking out five opposing hitters
in just four and two-thirds
innings of work.
Center fielder Don Kinney
leads Cal State-L.A.'s offense, car
rying a .444 average into today's
game. Four more Golden Eagles
are batting over .300 in a lineup
that is averaging nearly six runs a
game.
