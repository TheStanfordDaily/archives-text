# Post office's lease to be reconsidered
## 
### Kyung Lee Contributing writer 
In light of last week's expira
tion of the Stanford Post Office's
35-year-old lease, representatives
of the Stanford Management
Company, the ASSU Council of
Presidents and the U.S. Postal
Service will meet tomorrow to dis
cuss future plans for on-campus
mail service.
Student leaders and adminis
trators agree that tomorrow's
meeting may be the ideal chance
to improve the slow, inaccurate
and late postal service that has
troubled students and faculty
alike.
"We see this an opportune time
to make some changes now that

the lease is up," said COP member
Anietie Ekanem.
Ekanem said the COP is ex
ploring several alternatives for
postal service at Stanford â€” in
cluding relocating some or all stu
dent mail boxes to Tresidder
Union, installing a mail sorting
operation in Tresidder and provid
ing direct mail delivery to student
residences.
The COP is also looking at
making the post office an ASSU
business project or part of the
University, devising a plan to en
sure that priority mail is delivered
on time, and installing a private
mail operation in Tresidder, such
as Mail Boxes Etc., Ekanem said.
