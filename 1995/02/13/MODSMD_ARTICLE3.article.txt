# Post office's lease to be reconsidered
## 
### Kyung Lee Contributing writer 
In light of last week's expira
tion of the Stanford Post Office's
35-year-old lease, representatives
of the Stanford Management
Company, the ASSU Council of
Presidents and the U.S. Postal
Service will meet tomorrow to dis
cuss future plans for on-campus
mail service.
Student leaders and adminis
trators agree that tomorrow's
meeting may be the ideal chance
to improve the slow, inaccurate
and late postal service that has
troubled students and faculty
alike.
"We see this an opportune time
to make some changes now that

the lease is up," said COP member
Anietie Ekanem.
Ekanem said the COP is ex
ploring several alternatives for
postal service at Stanford — in
cluding relocating some or all stu
dent mail boxes to Tresidder
Union, installing a mail sorting
operation in Tresidder and provid
ing direct mail delivery to student
residences.
The COP is also looking at
making the post office an ASSU
business project or part of the
University, devising a plan to en
sure that priority mail is delivered
on time, and installing a private
mail operation in Tresidder, such
as Mail Boxes Etc., Ekanem said.
"This is an issue that the COP
has been looking at for a long
time and we're definitely mov
ing forward with it," Ekanem
said.
"We hope to see some con
crete results by the end of the
year," he said.
He added that the COP wants
to make this "a grass-roots cam
paign and make sure that stu
dents get involved."
The COP is going to spear
head a letter-writing campaign,
Ekanem said. They hope to have
500 students write letters to
Provost Condoleezza Rice, the
Postmaster General and Rep.
Anna Eshoo detailing the prob
lems they have encountered with
Stanford's post office, Ekanem
said.
The COP also plans to con
duct a "comprehensive" survey
of students' interactions with
the post office, he added.
While the COP gathers stu
dent input, Stanford Manage

ment Company — which holds
the lease on the post office's
building — will continue to con
sult with campus administra
tors.
"We have kept in close contact
with the Office of Student
Affairs, the Registrar's Office
and the Facilities Office," said
Leonie Batkin, manager of lands
management at Stanford Man
agement Company.
Batkin said she does not know
when lease negotiations will be
completed, but added that "we're
going to do everything possible to
get it resolved by the beginning
of next school year."
However, she said that in the
interim, several issues need to
be resolved — including the
improvement of postal service,
the location of the post office
and the possibility of having
more than one mail facility on
campus.
"We feel that there is room for
improvement on the quality of
the service and we need to
address that," Batkin said,
adding that addressing these
kinds of service issues "goes
beyond the scope of a normal

lease."
Last summer, ASSU senator
Stephen Russell compiled a list
of complaints about the post
office. Russell, the former chair
of the Postal Advisory Commit
tee, said that students constantly
complain about the post office's
poor service.
"We have had people complain
about receiving graduate school
acceptances after they have
accepted jobs or about receiving
rock-hard two-month old brown
ies because of the slow mail ser
vice," Russell said.
He attributed these problems
to Stanford's unusual postal dis
tribution system, saying that
only two other schools in the
nation have an on-campus post
office.
Russell said that most colleges
have their own distribution sys
tems or make special agreements
with postal service.
If Stanford distributed its own
mail — instead of sending it out
to a main, off-campus post office
which just returns it to campus
again — mail service would be
quicker and more cost-efficient,
Russell said.
