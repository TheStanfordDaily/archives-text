A new $1 million grant from General Mo
tors Corporation will provide funds for re
search and teaching at the School of Engi
neering and the Graduate School of Busi
ness, as well as help improve access for
women and targeted minorities.
The grant, payable in installments
through 1999, "celebrates a new chapter in
the long relationship between Stanford and
GM," said Provost Condoleezza Rice, who
accepted the award on the University's be
half on Friday.
"It is a continuation of GM's extensive in
volvement with the School of Engineering
and the Graduate School of Business," said
Thomas Evernham, senior vice president of
Delco Electronics and GM Key Executive,
who presented the first installment of the
grant.
Evernham added that both schools have
done excellent research for the automotive
industry and have trained high quality grad
uates, many of whom are now employed by
GM.

The grant will fund "student programs
and fellowships as well as faculty develop
ment and research," Evernham said. In ad
dition, a large portion of the grant will assist
Stanford in "its efforts to recruit women
and minorities to its programs."
Accepting the award on behalf on the
Business School, Dean Michael Spence
called the grant a "substantial investment in
GM's long-term commitment [to Stan
ford]."
Spence said that the money will support
global manufacturing programs such as
Stanford's Global Manufacturing Associ
ates Program, which is a collaborative effort
between the Business School and the School
of Engineering. The grant will "help pro
duce scholars and teachers in global manu
facturing," Spence said.
"It is an effort to move engineering re
search off campus," said James Gibbons,
dean of the School of Engineering. The grant
will support activities in four of the 10 de
partments in the School of Engineering,
Gibbons said.
