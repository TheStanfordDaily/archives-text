# History prof at ground zero on WWII A-bomb argument

Author George Orwell predicted that by
1984 recorded history would be reduced to
simple propaganda. He observed that be
cause "those who control the present control
the past," all history would be written and
re-written according to who was in power.
Although the country may not yet have
reached this level of oppression, a recent
controversy over the Smithsonian exhibit of
the Enola Gay — the B-29 which dropped
the atomic bomb in World War II — has
brought politics and historical evidence into
conflict.
From the time the Smithsonian released
the text that would accompany the Enola
Gay exhibit, there has been debate between
historians and veterans about the actual
numbers of American causalities that would

have occurred had the United States chosen
not to use the atomic bomb to end the war.
At the center of this controversy stands
History Prof. Barton Bernstein, who has
spent the last 20 years researching and writ
ing about the atomic bomb.
As part of his research, Bernstein sifted
through declassified military documents
and old diaries. In his digging, he uncovered
General George Marshall's estimation that
there would have been about 63,000 Ameri
can casualties in the November 1945 cam
paign at Kyushu had the United States re
lied on conventional weapons to end the war.
"The numbers I have quoted did not re
quire interpretation or anything else on my
part. I only had to read a few lines to get the
information out of a diary," said Bernstein.
"Any high school kid could have done that."
