# History prof at ground zero on WWII A-bomb argument
## 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
Author George Orwell predicted that by
1984 recorded history would be reduced to
simple propaganda. He observed that be
cause "those who control the present control
the past," all history would be written and
re-written according to who was in power.
Although the country may not yet have
reached this level of oppression, a recent
controversy over the Smithsonian exhibit of
the Enola Gay — the B-29 which dropped
the atomic bomb in World War II — has
brought politics and historical evidence into
conflict.
From the time the Smithsonian released
the text that would accompany the Enola
Gay exhibit, there has been debate between
historians and veterans about the actual
numbers of American causalities that would

have occurred had the United States chosen
not to use the atomic bomb to end the war.
At the center of this controversy stands
History Prof. Barton Bernstein, who has
spent the last 20 years researching and writ
ing about the atomic bomb.
As part of his research, Bernstein sifted
through declassified military documents
and old diaries. In his digging, he uncovered
General George Marshall's estimation that
there would have been about 63,000 Ameri
can casualties in the November 1945 cam
paign at Kyushu had the United States re
lied on conventional weapons to end the war.
"The numbers I have quoted did not re
quire interpretation or anything else on my
part. I only had to read a few lines to get the
information out of a diary," said Bernstein.
"Any high school kid could have done that."
Many veterans, however, insist
that the use of the atomic bomb
was responsible for saving them
from death in a Japanese inva
sion. Based on a famous letter
written by President Harry Tru
man in 1952, the American
Legion estimated that 1 million
causalities would have occurred.

Bernstein said such an esti
mate is outlandish and inaccu
rate. According to him, the Amer
ican Legion bases their estimates
on a contaminated letter by Tru
man. The letter, in fact, was re
written by Truman's aides who
changed Truman's earlier and
lower estimates, Bernstein said.
"There were only 1.9 million
troops involved in that opera
tion," Bernstein said. "In the
Pacific, there were no campaigns
where U.S. casualties ran over 50

percent."
But Bernstein said he still has
had difficulty engaging the veter
ans in any form of rational dis
course.
"It is hard to have discussions
with people when they are imper
vious to facts," Bernstein said.
"The American Legion is not
interested in evidence or analysis
or dialogue."
In response to political pres
sure from both the veterans'
groups and Congress, the Smith
sonian decided early this month
to severely scale back the exhibit
to include only the front part of
the fuselage of the plane and a
few placards with very limited
text. The exhibit will be essential
ly patriotic and not analytical.
"The script has been basically
eviscerated," Bernstein said.
"The Legion has used political
pressure to define history and
they've defined it in a very nar
row way. Indeed, the veterans'
organizations are trying to
restrict the dialogue more than it
was restricted 45 years ago, when
U.S. military leaders after World
War II questioned both the use
and morality of the atomic
bomb."
According to Bernstein, the
Smithsonian receives three
fourths of its budget from the fed
eral government and thus is very
sensitive to politics in Washing
ton.
"The presentation of history is
at stake," Bernstein said. "It
seems that people with more
votes and political power can
often control history in the short
run. I think this indicates that in
cases that are very volatile, politi
cal pressure can be used to define
history."
