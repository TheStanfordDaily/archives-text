# Amendment threatens financial aid
## 
### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
As the U.S. Senate prepares to vote
on the Balanced Budget Amendment
this week, Stanford students may be
forced to prepare themselves for a num
ber of sweeping changes in federal fi
nancial aid programs.

Over the next five years, Congress
has proposed to decrease student aid by
$9.6 billion dollars, cutting federal stu
dent loans, such as PLUS and Stafford
Loans, by over 22 percent and holding
students responsible for the interest
that accrues on their loans.
This has prompted concern from
University officials and students alike.

"This is a terrible, deplorable piece of
legislation," said Assoc. Dean of Gradu
ate Policy George Dekker, "with an ex
treme adverse effect on graduate" edu
cation.
"In the short run, at the administra
tion level, we must call everyone's atten-
tion to the impending legisla
tion," Dekker said.
On the student side, ASSU
undergraduate senator Michael
Choo also expressed concern over
the potential impact of the pro
posed congressional legislation.
He said he hopes to meet with
other senators to organize some
opposition.
Stanford Democrats Chairs
Bill Shen and Maria Bleavins said
they are trying to publish a
newsletter in the near future,
criticizing the Republicans'
financial aid policies and urging

students to take action against
the possible cuts.
"Stanford students must
express their outrage at this
attack on education and the
young people of America,"the
newsletter says. "Student action
must be immediate. Write, call
and e-mail your senators and rep
resentatives today."
However, Council of Presi
dents member Mork Murdock,
who learned of the bill this past
Friday, said he wasn't sure what
could be done.
"We would like to" do some
thing, he said, "but it comes at a
really bad time with midterms
and everything."
The federal cuts would come
both by lowering the overall

amount of loans and changing
the way interest is charged.
Under current policy, an "in
school interest subsidy" prevents
federal loans from being subject
to interest while the student is
enrolled and for a six-month
grace period after they graduate.
By eliminating the "in-school
interest subsidy," the amount a
student repays could increase by
15 to 50 percent.
"This is one of the biggest
blows to graduate education,"
Dekker said. The proposed legis
lation would make it increasingly
difficult to pay the tuition for
advanced degrees, he said.
Graduate and professional
students — who have to stay in
school longer and are limited in

the availability of grants and fel
lowships — would pay the great
est toll if the interest exemption
was eliminated.
Reduced loans also would
especially hurt Stanford graduate
and professional students.
According to Cynthia Rife, assis
tant director of Financial Aid,
Stanford presently "has no com
mitment to meet the needs of
graduate students."
However, the impact is not
limited to graduate students. "It
is particularly significant for any
body who comes from a back
ground of middle or lower class,"
Dekker said.
Although the proposed legisla
tion "would hurt the neediest
students" and bring about "addi

tional hardship," the University
would make every effort to meet
the needs of the undergraduate
students, Rife said.
In the meantime, Dekker is
doing everything possible to com
bat the amendment. But, he
admitted, "there's not a whole lot
we can do."
Dekker has joined the Nation
al Association of Graduate-Pro
fessional Students, Inc. — a
group that has been trying to
rally graduate deans to stop the
proposed amendment.
Dekker said he "hopes that
students could get in touch with
their congressmen."
Students seem not to know
much about the bill and its
effects. However, if students are

willing to lobby, Murdock said
the COP will provide all the
resources it can. The COP might
meet since "this may be a situa
tion where we should make a
statement," he said.
According to the Allegiance of
Save Student Aid, a recently
formed coalition of students, a
survey of 1,000 Americans
showed that 89 percent were
against cutting federal financial
aid.
Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-
Calif.) has said that she plans to
vote against the amendment
unless additional measures are
taken to secure Social Security.
Senator Barbara Boxer (D-
Calif.) was unavailable for com
ment.
