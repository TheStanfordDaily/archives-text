# ASSU fee refund requests up a bit
## 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
Fee refund requestes increased by 5 percent this
quarter to 22 percent, ASSU Financial Manager Gabe
Lucas reported Friday.
However, Lucas said, a quarterly increase is nor
mal because refunds usually carry over from fall quar
ter. Thus, only an additional 5 percent of students
asked for money back from the average student group.
Students refunded almost $87,000 this quarter, up
$10,000 from last quarter, he said.
"The refunds normally go up," Lucas said.
The refund system has received much criticism this
year, culminating in the recent failure of the Balanced
Funding Deal, an ASSU-sponsored constitutional
amendment to abolish refunds.
"I'm sure the BFD brought attention to the re
funds," he said.
As in fall quarter, the group with the highest re
fund rate this quarter was the ASSU Program Board.
Lucas estimated almost 26 percent of students took
back their program board fee. On the other extreme,
only 15 percent of students refunded their ASSU legal
counsel fee.
To account for the possibility of the fee refund, or
ganizations charge students an extra 30 percent of
their budget as a buffer.
Publications Board Director Danny Bressler,
whose organization was among the top three groups in
percent of refunds, said that since the increased rate
still left refunds at under the 30 percent buffer, the
Pub Board is not adversely affected.
"The windfall will be put into reserves," he said. "It
just means we get a little extra money in the reserves."
The 5 percent increase was felt uniformly over each
of the groups who received their special fee this year.
Lucas said that of the students who refunded their
fees, almost three-fourths were graduate students.
Overall, 3,683 students chose to refund.
In total, 15 percent of undergraduates and 42 per
cent of graduate students refunded their fees.
