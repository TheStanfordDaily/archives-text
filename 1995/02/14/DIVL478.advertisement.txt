Strategies for Standardized Tests in a Diverse World
Strategy *5: Beat the Crowd
Very few test-takers answer difficult questions correctly. Most candidates
pick a wrong answer, yet think they picked the right one. Of course, the test
makers know how the crowd thinks and how to fool them.
Testing for the Public shows you where to find the difficult questions.
More importantly, we show you how to recognize the answer the crowd will
pick. Rather than hang around with the wrong crowd, beat it!
