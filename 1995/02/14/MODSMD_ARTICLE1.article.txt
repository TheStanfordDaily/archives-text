# Dramatic rise in Bridge use
## Counseling up 100% last fall 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
A growing number of students are taking advan
tage of the counseling services available at Stanford
this year, including the Bridge — which has seen a
100 percent increase in the use of its program over
the last four months.
In fall quarter 1993, counselors at the Bridge, a
confidential peer-counseling network, handled ap
proximately 70 cases. Last quarter the numbers
jumped to 150. The counselors also referred twice as
many callers to other resources.
Senior Chris Li, a live-in counselor at the Bridge,
said the increase in counsels was due to a change in
students' perceptions about stress. "Mental illness is
less stigmatized than it has been in the past," Li said.
"People have not felt as alienated speaking about
their problems because they see that it is not abnor
mal to have these problems."
New publications like the Balance Beam and orga
nizations like Psychology Outreach — a recently
formed student group which tries to help others by
sharing experiences with psychological problems —
are largely responsible for exposing the Stanford
community to the various stresses that students
might face, Li said.
Both of these groups help to remove the miscon
ception that students must handle their problems
alone, he said.
Li added that another reason for the increase is
that students are more aware of the services available
at the Bridge. Many of this year's resident assistants
were previously involved with the Bridge and have
spread the word about its services, he said.
Coterminal student John Hall, another live-in
counselor, explained the jump in other terms. "There
has been increased academic pressure on campus,"
he said. "Because of increased distribution require
ments and the change in the grading policy there is
less and less tolerance for error and more pressure for
performance."
Hall said Stanford must consider this aspect of
student health when forming University policy.
