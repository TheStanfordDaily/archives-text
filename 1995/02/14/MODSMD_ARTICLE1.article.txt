# Dramatic rise in Bridge use
## Counseling up 100% last fall 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
A growing number of students are taking advan
tage of the counseling services available at Stanford
this year, including the Bridge — which has seen a
100 percent increase in the use of its program over
the last four months.
In fall quarter 1993, counselors at the Bridge, a
confidential peer-counseling network, handled ap
proximately 70 cases. Last quarter the numbers
jumped to 150. The counselors also referred twice as
many callers to other resources.
Senior Chris Li, a live-in counselor at the Bridge,
said the increase in counsels was due to a change in
students' perceptions about stress. "Mental illness is
less stigmatized than it has been in the past," Li said.
"People have not felt as alienated speaking about
their problems because they see that it is not abnor
mal to have these problems."
New publications like the Balance Beam and orga
nizations like Psychology Outreach — a recently
formed student group which tries to help others by
sharing experiences with psychological problems —
are largely responsible for exposing the Stanford
community to the various stresses that students
might face, Li said.
Both of these groups help to remove the miscon
ception that students must handle their problems
alone, he said.
Li added that another reason for the increase is
that students are more aware of the services available
at the Bridge. Many of this year's resident assistants
were previously involved with the Bridge and have
spread the word about its services, he said.
Coterminal student John Hall, another live-in
counselor, explained the jump in other terms. "There
has been increased academic pressure on campus,"
he said. "Because of increased distribution require
ments and the change in the grading policy there is
less and less tolerance for error and more pressure for
performance."
Hall said Stanford must consider this aspect of
student health when forming University policy.
"Stanford has a strong tradi
tion of support for personal prob
lems," he said. "I would hope the
University would not lose sight of
the importance of counseling in
the tight budget situation we are
in now."
Most of the counseling done at
the Bridge is on a short-term
basis. Students who feel they
need more help are generally
referred to Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPS) at
Cowell.
While about 80 percent of
those who seek help at the Bridge
are undergraduates, the majority
of those who go to Cowell are
graduates. "Graduate students
are much more willing to use the
resource than undergraduates,"
said Dr. Alejandro Martinez,
director of CAPS. "The graduates
are more comfortable with them
selves. They have a problem and
they want to deal with it."
Martinez agreed that students
are feeling more pressure to per
form well at Stanford. "Students
feel there is less room for mis
takes," Martinez said. "The pres
sure to do well and keep up can be
very oppressing at times."
Over the last four years there
has been an increase in the num

ber of students who use the coun
seling services available at Cow
ell, though there has not been a
particularly sharp increase this
year.
Martinez said he believes the
trend can be attributed to eco
nomic factors. "Before the new
economic decline, Stanford stu
dents could always make the
assumption that they would get
the jobs they were looking for,"
he said. "That is not true any
more. Reality is waiting for stu
dents after graduation and it is
not secure out there."
Diana Conklin, assoc. director
of Residential Education, said
many of the residence deans have
noted that more students are
coming to them with a variety of
concerns. "There is a greater
sense of urgency about declaring
a major, getting a degree, and get
ting a job," she said. "There is a
lot of economic pressure that we
didn't see even a few years ago."
The residence deans are find
ing that they are dealing with
more complaints about financial
problems and academic concerns
this year than they have in the
past. However, the reason for the
increase is not immediately clear,
she said.
"We are seeing more people,"
Conklin said. "I don't know if it is
because the students are more
willing to talk to us or more
stressed about life."
