# Radiology prof sues UCSF over medical patent
##

Radiology Assoc. Prof. Michael Moseley is
embroiled in a legal battle with the University
of California at San Francisco over the rights
to a method of predicting strokes and heart
attacks — potentially worth in excess of $ 100
million in royalties.
"The patent was sold without our knowl
edge," said Moseley, a co-inventor of the tech
nique. "And when we attempted to find out
what had happened, the more we tried, the
less we could find out."
Patented in 1990, the invention pinpoints
trouble spots in blood vessels in the brain and
heart by using computers, MRI scanners and a
drug that illuminates a patient's blood flow.
Moseley, now working in Stanford's Radiol
ogy Department, said he knew nothing of the
sale while he was at UCSF and that it was not
until 18 months later that UCSF informed
him he could no longer continue research on

the process. "I just can't believe rights would
be sold without the inventors knowing,"
Moseley said.
The rights were purchased for $12,500 by
Nycomed Salutar, a California corporation,
from the Office of Technology Transfer (OTT)
at UCSF. Moseley's complaint, filed in Novem
ber, alleges that, "Nycomed ... in secret nego
tiations with the OTT, purported to license the
worldwide rights to the invention ... on both
an exclusive and a royalty-free basis."
Moseley's lawyer, Richard Harmon, said
Nycomed estimates the process will be worth
approximately $300 million a year over the 17
year life of the patent. "That translates to a
likely minimum royalty value exceeding $100
million," Harmon said.
By law, UCSF owns the rights to anything
invented by its professors. Royalties are sup
posed to be split equally between the inventor
and the university.
"They have a right to deal with us as they

please," Moseley said. "But to issue a royalty
free license is rather strange," he said, adding
that he questions if the university is acting in
its best interests in addition to those of the
inventors.
UCSF officials declined to comment
because the case is currently in litigation.
Last September, Stanford adopted a policy
very similar to the one at UCSF. According to
Hans Wiesendanger, an associate in the Office
of Technology Licensing, Stanford owns the
rights to anything invented by the faculty if
they utilize University facilities.
"In most cases the inventor is kept
informed of dealings," Wiesendanger said.
"But we are constantly handling inventions in
every field, and it is often difficult to estimate
a patent's value over the long run."
"It could happen here," Wiesendanger said.
"In the past patents have often been sold for
less then they are worth, but at the time they
have sounded very reasonable."
