# Mexican opposition party wins key gubernatorial election

### 
GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) —
Mexico's largest opposition party yes
terday celebrated the biggest electoral
victory of its history, which analysts
said could help end 66 years of single
party rule in Mexico.
The National Action Party claimed
it won the governorship of the state of
Jalisco, control of the state legislature
and 90 of 124 city halls, including
Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest
city.
"This triumph shows it is possible
to change the government... through
the force of votes and not through the
force of bullets," said Felipe Calderon,
secretary-general of the center-right
party, known as the PAN.
Sunday's vote was a vindication of
President Ernesto Zedillo's promise of
fair elections and greater democracy in
Mexico.
It also came three days after Zedillo
sent troops to crack down on leftist
rebels in the southern state of Chiapas,
breaking a year-long truce. That move
thrilled hard-liners in his ruling party
and may have helped dissuade them
from challenging Zedillo with a fraud
ulent election in Jalisco, analysts said.
With 40 percent of the gubernatori
al vote counted, the PAN's candidate,
Alberto Cardenas, had 54.46 percent
and the ruling Institutional Revolu
tionary Party candidate, Eugenio Ruiz
Orozco, had 35.9 percent. Eight other
parties trailed far behind.
Cardenas, 36, is a former mayor of

Ciudad Guzman and a university pro
fessor.
"We accept the results. We know
the vote did not favor us," said Rafael
Gonzalez Pimienta, state president of
the governing party, known as the
PRI.
In the past, the PRI had contested
claims of opposition victory at the polls
and had admitted losing only two
statewide elections in its history —
both to the PAN.
For years, presidents have been
promising to clean up Mexican elec
tions, but opponents have continued
to accuse the PRI of using fraud, force
and public funds to maintain its hold
on power.
The last election before Zedillo took
office in December, a November vote
in Tabasco state, was marred by
widespread fraud allegations. Mili
tants within liis party rebelled against
Zedillo's efforts to solve the dispute in
January, causing the president to
appear weak
"It is very important that did not
happen in Jalisco," said Jaime
Sanchez Susarrey, a political colum
nist and professor at the University of
Guadalajara. "The government of the
republic maintained control."
The election Sunday was the first
since a sudden devaluation of the Mex
ican peso in December slashed Mexi
cans' buying power and forced the
country to appeal for international aid
to save its economy.

Sanchez suggested that the vote
could be the first of a series of PAN
victories and said the party has a
chance to win control of Mexico's
lower house of congress in the 1997
federal election.
Three other states, all PAN
strongholds, have gubernatorial elec
tions this year: Bf\ja California, Gua
myuato and Yucatan.
Local issues also factored into the
PRI defeat here. Many in Guadakyara
were angry about a 1992 sewage
explosion, blamed on the government,
that killed more than 200 people.
There is also widespread frustration
over a wave of violent crimes, includ
ing the still unsolved 1993 murder of
the city's Roman Catholic cardinal,
Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo.
On Thursday, Zedillo sent the Mex
ican army after the rebel Zapatista
National Liberation Army in Chiapas.
That move pleased PRI hard-liners
and helped wipe away an image of
presidential weakness.
Sanchez said the Chiapas events
might have dissuaded any hardliners
from thoughts of challenging Zedillo
with fraudulent actions.
"I believe the show of force in Chia
pas was a warning ... that the presi
dent maintains his power," Sanchez
said.
The leftist Democratic Revolution
Party, or PRD, which denounced
Zedillo's action in Chiapas, won less
than 5 percent of the vote in Jalisco.
