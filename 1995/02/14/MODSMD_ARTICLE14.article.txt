TUSAYAN, Ariz. (AP) - A
plane flying tourists to the Grand
Canyon apparently lost an engine
and crashed while trying to return
to the airport yesterday, killing
eight of 10 people aboard, authori
ties said.
Two other passengers were being
treated for serious injuries at the
scene two miles northeast of Grand

Canyon Airport, said Coconino
County Sheriff Sgt. Raoul Osegue
da.
The plane, a Piper Navajo,
belongs to Las Vegas Airlines, a tour
company that specializes in scenic
flights over Grand Canyon National
Park, Osegueda said.
It is believed the flight began in
Las Vegas and had completed a tour

of the park, said Fred O'Donnell, a
spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Los Angeles.
The plane landed at Grand
Canyon Airport, 175 miles north of
Phoenix and a few miles south of
the park's main south entrance.
It took off again at about 3:35
p.m. and almost immediately
reported trouble, O'Donnell said.
