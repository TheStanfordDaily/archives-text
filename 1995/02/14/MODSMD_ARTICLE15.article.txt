New crime bill introduced
WASHINGTON (AP) — Under threat of a pres
idential veto, the House took up a GOP bill yester
day that would give $10 billion in crime-fighting
money to state and local governments and end the
program to put 100,000 new police officers on the
street.

The law also would eliminate funds set aside in
the 1994 law for crime prevention programs.
Instead, state and local governments would
receive block grants of $2 billion a year for five years
to use as they wished to reduce crime and improve
public safety. The GOP bill, as amended Monday,
requires a 10 percent local match of federal funds,
compared with a 25 percent match in the 1994 law.
