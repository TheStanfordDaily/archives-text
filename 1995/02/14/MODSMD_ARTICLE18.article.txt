## Pell grants under ax 
### 
NEWT GINGRICH and
other House Republicans
have indicated that lower
income college students aren't
included in their "Contract with
America."
Gingrich recently said that he
would like to eliminate the $6 bil
lion federal Pell grant program —
which provides aid to needy stu
dents nationwide — and replace it
with more work-study programs.
About 900 Stanford undergrad
uates received $1.6 million in Pell
grants last year. But these stu
dents are already participating in
work-study programs and borrow
ing large sums of money. They
"shouldn't be working more or
borrowing more," said Assistant
Director of Financial Aid Cynthia
Rife.
Although Rife said the Univer
sity could make up for the lost

funding if necessary, in these times
of belt-tightening the last thing
Stanford needs is an additional
burden on its budget.
Gingrich and his cohorts must
be told that sacrificing federal
funding for higher education is
unacceptable. With millionaires
receiving full Social Security and
Medicare benefits — and a defense
budget of over $260 billion —
there are better ways to solve the
nation's fiscal woes than slashing
a part of the budget as beneficial
as the Pell grant program. Invest
ing in education is an investment
in America's future prosperity.
Students who receive Pell
grants, or just believe that they
should not be eliminated, should
contact their representatives and
tell them how they feel.
The future of equality in Amer
ican higher education is at stake.
