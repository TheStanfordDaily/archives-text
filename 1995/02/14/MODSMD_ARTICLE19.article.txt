AS A WORLD-CLASS uni
versity, Stanford consis
tently draws some of the
most famous people in the world
to visit and speak. Recently,
however, there has been a
notable exception — at com
mencement.
The past four graduation
speakers have been Stephen
Carter, Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
Kirk Varnedoe and John Gard
ner. While all are prominent and
successful in their respective
careers, none has delivered the
high-profile send-off that Stan
ford graduates deserve.
Part of the problem are the
requirements that University
President Gerhard Casper places
on the choice of speaker. Last
year, in defense of his choice of
Carter — a Yale law professor
who graduated from the Farm-
Casper said: "I feel about this
somewhat strongly — the com
mencement speaker should have

some Stanford connection." He
added he felt having an academic
speaker was important as well.
Although connections to Stan
ford and academia are fine,
Casper should not rule out other
possibilities because they don't
meet these criteria. As Stanford
seeks a speaker to address its
101st graduating class, the Uni
versity should not shy from look
ing outside the sphere of aca
demics and alumni.
When families and friends
come to the Farm to see a gradu
ation, they expect an experience
that they will remember.
Although it's asking too much to
demand, say, the President of the
United States, Stanford should
try harder to bring in a speaker
who is relatively well-known and
could provide an interesting per
spective on life after college.
Stanford graduates and their
families and friends deserve
nothing less.
