# Stanford Fund group ready to present changes
## Members optimistic about rewritten alumni-giving plan 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
A special task force is poised to recommend major
changes later this week in the Stanford Fund policy as
it pertains to student groups.
In November, the administration temporarily re
leased students from the policy — which prohibited a
University organization from soliciting funds from
alumni who did not donate to that particular organi
zation in the previous five years. The policy was en
acted Sept. 1.
Responding to student uproar, the administration
agreed to review the policy with a joint committee of
students and administrators.
"If I were a student group, I wouldn't worry that
the Sept. 1 policy would be put in place," said Council
of Presidents member Vanessa Alvarado, one of the
task force chairs.
Also heading the committee is Assoc. Vice Presi
dent for Development Stephen Peeps. Members in
clude Dean of Students Michael Jackson, ASSU sena
tors Michael Choo and Stephen Russell, COP member
Lisa Lee, Stanford Fund Director Nancy Wells and Di
rector of Student Activities Nanci Howe.
"We started from ground zero," Choo said. "We
didn't work backwards from the September policy."
The group agreed in November to report on its rec-
ommendations by tomorrow. Mem
bers said that after yesterday's
meeting, they will meet once more
late tomorrow afternoon to finalize
the proposal.
The group will present its
reforms to the ASSU Senate, the
Office of Student Activities and the
Office of Development.
"We believe that together the
joint committee has come up with
promising new forms of partner
ships that will benefit students and
the University alike," Peeps said.

"We've identified ways for each to
assist each other."
The final recommendations will
have to be approved by University
President Gerhard Casper and
Provost Condoleezza Rice before
taking effect.
Peeps said his office is enthusi
astic about the recommendations
and added he does not anticipate
any obstacles to delay the policy's
move to the President's Office.
"I am presuming that ... we
can expect quick action from Build
ing 10," he said. "It will make a dif
ference to the President and
Provost that all the parties
involved are on board. We're hop
ing that the senate will endorse

what they're presented with later
this week."
Alvarado said the plan will most
likely be brought up at the Feb. 21
ASSU Senate meeting for approval.
"I'm just really glad that we
went through the process," she
said. "This is just a good example of
how students and administrators
can work together."
Peeps encouraged support from
student organizations once the pol
icy is revealed.
"I would hope that their con
cerns have been well represented
by student leaders and well under
stood by us," he said. "If we'd done
our job right, they would be enthu
siastic as well."
