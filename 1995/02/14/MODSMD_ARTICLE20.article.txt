Editorial on virtual academics contained several errors

I WOULD LIKE to clarify some factual
misconceptions in the editorial from
The Daily of Feb. 9 entitled "Virtual
academics." In this piece The Daily
expressed concerns over the Commission
on Technology in Teaching and Learn
ing's plan to admit students in their
junior year of high school with the intent
of remaining at high school during their
senior year but taking courses remotely
via electronic means.
What you did not state is that this pro
gram would be run through the Educa
tion Program for Gifted Youth (EPGY), a
program which currently offers —
through the Continuing Studies Program
— computer-based courses in mathemat
ics, physics and expository writing to
almost 500 young students. The Daily's
lack of information concerning EPGY is
the source of a number of factual errors in
the editorial.
To begin with, The Daily claims that
these students will be taking these courses
"via electronic mail." While electronic
mail is a component of the tutorial sup
port structure used by EPGY, it fails to
capture the dynamic nature of the multi

media course ware which will actually be
used. (For an idea of what it will be like,
see my opinion piece in the June 1, 1994
issue of The Daily, or visit the EPGY
mosaic page at
http://kanpai.stanford.edu/epgy).
The Daily states that the program is
not blind to a student's financial position
since students are required to supply their
own computer equipment. This statement
is simply false. Since its inception in 1992
EPGY has been entirely need blind in its
admissions, and has never turned away a
qualified student. EPGY has been aggres
sive in its willingness to reduce tuition up
to 100 percent to help students who need
to purchase computers and to supply com
puters to those students in extreme finan
cial hardship. (It should be noted as well
that the EPGY course software will run
on computers costing as little as $900).
The Daily's lack of information con
cerning EPGY is manifest again when its
editorial takes its professed ironic twist,
praising the commission's plan to enable
Native American high school students to
take computerized courses. What The
Daily fails to realize lis that this program

is also to be run in conjunction with
EPGY. While the University intends to
fund this project with grant money, it is
doing so because this project will be
geared towards students who would not
regularly qualify for the EPGY courses.
The University has not set aside special
funds for the advanced high school stu
dents because these students will fall
within the framework of regular EPGY
admissions and will be eligible for aid
through EPGY.
As to the Editorial Board's second,
less tangible concern, namely that the
senior year of high school should be a
time of relaxation and socialization, I
wish to make three remarks. The first is
that the board's concern over the choices
these students make smacks of paternal
ism. Surely it is better to afford these
students with the widest possible oppor
tunities and let them make their own
decisions.
The second is that the net amount of
time these students will spend on their
remote courses will not be significantly
greater than the time they would have
spent on the courses they would otherwise

be taking at high school, especially when
one considers the tremendous amount of
time spent in class in high school. The
major difference will be that the time they
will spend in class will be productive.
They will still have all their time out of
school to socialize. Compare this to the
present alternatives involving students
taking courses at community colleges or
coming to college early and missing out on
their senior year altogether.
The final remark I wish to make is that
the Editorial Board seems to have forgot
ten that the idleness whose virtues they
extol is the prerogative of the wealthy. If
anything, a program like this, by allowing
students to complete advanced work
before coming to Stanford and to there
fore make it possible for students to com
plete degrees in fewer than four years, will
benefit the less affluent students by sav
ing them the cost of a year of tuition.
Besides which, these students will have
plenty of time for relaxation when they
are in graduate school.
