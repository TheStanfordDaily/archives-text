## Some Valentine's options 
### 
IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY. Yeah, you
can't even escape its presence in The
Daily, especially with those Valentine's
Classifieds.
We all know how pukey Valentine's Day
can get sometimes. The oh-so-colorful and
cheery gift packages in the Bookstore; the
seemingly endless stretch of campus orga
nizations in White Plaza advertising to
send a special message to a loved one for the
low, low price of your sanity and good taste;
the dopey-eyed couples walking around
campus professing, "I love you, poochie
face." "But I love you more, muffin-butt."
Even for those in happy relationships,
the marketing and unnecessary public dis
play of adoration is enough to make the die
hard romantic turn tail from the holiday
and flee.
For everyone else, it's true that Valen
tine's Day is in your face, and it's easy to
get depressed over the fact that you don't
have a person of emotional importance to
whom you can send an a cappella-gram. If
you are one of the embittered, here are a
few options for your Valentine's Day fes
tivities.
First, there's the Friends and Family
program. Call up all of your single friends
and talk about how love sucks and how
men or women (depending on your prefer
ence) are generally stupid and not worth
the time it takes to say helio.
Second, there's the more social version
of Friends and Family: the CoHo. Join a

large group of embittered people as they
congregate at the Coffee House, all wearing
black, to talk about how love sucks. The
benefit of this program is actual human
contact and a variety of bottled beers to
choose from.
Third, there's the ex-significant other
option. Renew your friendship in this time
of need by writing, calling or e-mailing to
discuss how much he or she meant to you
and how you look back upon your past rela
tionship with fond nostalgia. With this
option, you can validate yourself by think
ing about how you used to have a valentine
and, perhaps, how you'll have another one
soon enough.
And then there's the rarely used fourth
option: Suck it up. That's right, bite the
bullet, go down fighting, give 'em all your
worth and deal and move on. Yeah, it's
Valentine's Day. So what? It's another 24
hours in the long cycle of the year, so just
put on a pair of blinders to all the pink and
red decor surrounding you and look for
ward to Feb. 15, when you can put the
nightmare behind you (except for the occa
sional cutesy Valentine's Day anecdote that
your dormmate simply must tell you
again).
Luckily, Valentine's Day falls on a Tues
day this year. That means you have classes
in session, meetings to attend, work to do,
friends to hang out with and a plethora of
other things to keep your mind occupied
and your eyes dry of tears. The stuff that's

your real life, remember?
Dare to dream of a Valentine's Day dur
ing which you are cheerful and happy in
spite of all of the couples wearing matching
"#1 Sweetheart" T-shirts. Think to your
self that you are a complete person without
a significant other, and that you can find
fulfillment in your own being. Maybe you
could even muster up enough enthusiasm
to commemorate the day by wishing your
family and friends a Happy Valentine's
Day, a heartfelt sentiment shared without
the cheesiness of mylar balloons and
Shaquille O'Neal valentine cards.
But if you can't do that, if sucking it up
is just not a viable option, then choose the
fifth plan: action. That's right, either put
up or shut up. This plan calls for you to
strap on some courage and make a bold
move. To stop complaining and tell some
one that you are interested in pursuing a
relationship with him or her. Just get off
your lazy asses and ask someone out on a
date.
And who knows where this could lead?
Maybe on Valentine's Day next year you'll
be walking through White Plaza, hand in
hand with your own personal poochie-face.
