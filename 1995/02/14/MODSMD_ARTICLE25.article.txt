Students should clean for themselves
I think it's ridiculous that the University is taking
over cleaning in self-ops and co-ope, because if they are
really dedicated to residential education — if there is
one thing that most Stanford students don't know
about residing — it is how to clean. Somehow their
mothers have pampered them a little too much. I think
that most people benefit from being exposed to the
responsibility of cleaning up after themselves.
Make Hoover House represent the campus
Stanford should make Hoover House into more of a
microcosm of the environment here on campus. The
University should put the Council of Presidents, the
University President, the chair of the Faculty Senate,
and the president of the United Stanford Workers all
together in the house so they can all share that won
derful gazebo hot tub that Stanford students have
come to know and love in the spirit of better relations
between everyone that's on campus.
"Sweet" editorial on eucalyptus trees
I thought Monday's editorial on getting rid of euca
lyptus trees and planting native trees instead was
sweet, because I agree wholeheartedly.
High speed transport
I think that we need a faster method of getting stu
dents to classes. We need a high speed transportation
system from dorms — maybe even from showers —
directly to classes. I'm sure students would be much
more inclined to get up and go to class if they were
zooming in on rails.
Ginsberg article "ignorant"
I found Monday's article on Allen Ginsberg com
pletely offensive and ignorant. It concentrates entirely
on Ginsberg's use of drugs and homosexuality, and
makes him into a fad of pop culture. It left out the fact
that Ginsberg is an ever changing artist having out
lived most of the other beat writers and progressing far
beyond them He can charm an audience but to call
him a rock star is blasphemous To say that Gins
berg's resentment of authority comes from govem-
Ynent censorship of "Howl" is absurd — the reason he
was blacklisted was because of his politics, and by writ
ing about them he is using his own authority.
More howling
I'd just like to leave a message about Monday's arti
cle on Allen Ginsberg. I thought it was a really unedu
cated view of a lot of his work and made a lot of really
absurd generalizations about Allen Ginsberg and what
he is all about. I thought it was a terrible article and
definitely didn't deserve to be on the front page.
No, I'm not weird
How many feathers are on a Perdue chicken? How
many fibers are intertwined in a shredded wheat bis
cuit? How many times does the batmobile get a flat?
