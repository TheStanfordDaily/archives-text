# Tuesday Thoughts
## One should aim to live in the present, like a bobcat 
### 
TWO WEEKS
ago, a bobcat sat
under a live oak,
rotating her ears like
satellite dishes. She
sat still for a while,
then stood and walked
towards the road. I
watched until her
stubby black tail fol-

lowed her into a field, slow and insou
ciant. Her body was longer than a house
cat's, and as she stepped calmly towards
the grass, I forgot about my afternoon
class and lost myself in the lengthy torso.
That bobcat taught me something.
I'd emphasize the eerienessr of seeing
a bobcat a few miles from campus at
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve. I'd
highlight the irony of hearing cars and
SLAC humming behind that cat. But I'd
like this bobcat to get all the attention.
She doesn't care about the churning
gears of Stanford; those ears turning in
feint wind, they don't care.
That cat sighting preys on me as I

stream through White Plaza, grind
through reading, and plod through
papers., To where am I rushing? That
bobcat embodies the cliche to live every
hour as if her life depends on it, as every
increment of attention she maintains in
the present enhances the likelihood she
will catch prey.
I'd like to live like that bobcat,
unceasingly present. Could I experience
every moment fully, without jumping
ahead, planning my week, or falling
back and dwelling on the midterm I took
the other day? As I spin in the spiral
dance of a busy Stanford student, I'd
like the centrifuge to tear my thoughts
away, wash away my plans, hopes, and
dreams, let my ears open to the whir of
this moment.
I'm a mammal with hair and smelly
feces like that bobcat, but I'm no hunter,
and my survival does not depend on the
extent of my attentive presence. While
my survival is not at stake, my happiness
is at stake, because I am most content
when I'm wholly alert in the present. I

stray towards activities that greet mental
wandering with discomfort or boredom;
slugging a seventy-pound pack through
the Sierras, running in the foothills, lis
tening to music, chopping vegetables
slowly, silently.
It is difficult to live unceasingly pre
sent. The industry of media advertising
is designed to entice me out of the pre
sent and into the mythological future,
where I need only buy some product or
have some new experience in order to
acquire the commodity of happiness. A
lot is at stake in this scam, as the liveli
hood of many people depends on their
ability to seduce me out of the present
Our culture cares little about living in
the present.
How can I practice living fully awake?
If I backpacked more often, jogged more
often, chopped vegetables more often,
would I be less likely to dwell on that
approaching exam or jump ahead to
graduation? For 25 centuries Buddhist
monks have given up family life and
physical possessions, surrendered them

selves to the rigid schedule of monastic
life in order to practice the art of living in
the present. Need I go to such an
extreme? Ought I save my money for a
ticket to Nepal or Thailand?
I hope not. That bobcat gives me hope.
Two weeks ago, for a few moments, I was
complete. It was enough to watch the
cat's torso bob slightly. It was enough to
notice the slight expansion of her nos
trils. Without planning, imagining, or
remembering, for a few moments, I was
awake, wholly content.
Right now, it is dark, and stars sit over
redwoods outside my window. I wonder
about her. I imagine the black tail bob
bing into grass, the gray fur heaving with
•breath. I picture the retracted claws grit
ted with sun-dried mud. It is pleasant to
wonder, but I'd like to not wonder. I'd
like to reside in this moment, silent and
smiling. That bobcat stirs on, despite my
dreaming.
