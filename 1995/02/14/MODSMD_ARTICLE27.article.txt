# This Valentine's Day, Stanford students shouldn't bathe
## 
### 
Last year, a
good friend of
mine ran a lot
and didn't shower
much. After two
months, I assumed
that a herd of large
rodents had been
sacrificed in his
fetid room. By
April, standing in

his room made one feel like they were
stuck in the garbage compactor of the
Death Star — slimy monsters and
pungent waves closing in on all sides.
In retrospect, we should not have
mocked Andy for forsaking shower
ing; we should have followed him and
incited a movement to conserve water
to fill our once solemn and now flac
cid, lake bed. The Lake could have
been full last year, and it could be
bubbling and flowing this year. We
could have dumped the stigmas of
Generation X on their head and rein
vented student activism at Stanford.
As Robert Kennedy said in 1966,
"Each time a man stands up for an
ideal, or acts to improve the lots of
others, or strikes out against injus

tice, he sends a tiny ripple of hope,
and crossing each other from a mil
lion centers of energy and daring
those ripples build a current which
can strike down the mightiest walls of
oppression and resistance."
However, Andy's behavior gener
ated no ripples, and no walls were
struck down. People didn't under
stand and Andy's potential stand was
smothered by the Declaration of Apa
thy at Stanford. The whole campus
was asleep, drunk and/or in the
library all year — except for a short
break during the hunger strike.
Perhaps it is futile to be an idealist
— to think that people would abstain
from their work and solipsism for
others and for the environment.
Regardless, the time has come for us
to follow up on Andy's "ideals." If we
unite as a campus and make some
small sacrifices, we can transform
Lake Lag from a congealed stew into
an enchanted majestic lake.
Think about it: it takes
40,500,000 gallons to fill the lake to
nine feet, the highest it has ever
been. Now, it's about one third full.
Thus, it would take approximately 27

million gallons to fill the lake com
pletely. Sound ambitious for a bunch
of students?
It isn't. Each shower uses five to
seven gallons of water a minute. The
average person thus uses about 60
gallons a day in the shower. We also
use about 25 more gallons a day by
flushing toilets and running faucets
while we brush our teeth. Plugging
an 85 gallon a day reduction into our
trusty computer yields a net total,
assuming 13,500 participants, (the
number of people who read all of the
columns in the Daily) of only 23 mal
odorous days to turn Lake Lag from
the home of the Swamp Thing into
the playground of the Little Mermaid.
Only 23 days to double the number of
frogs serenading us at night; only 23
days until dolphins frolic a mere stroll
from the quad.
Of course, many people don't want
to make the paltry sacrifices that the
23 day method requires. They fear
that not showering will offend their
dates and job interviewers (possibly
killing two birds with one stone).
However, dating someone from with
in Stanford would not be a problem

since odor perception is relative. If I
stink and you stink, neither of us
stinks. Offending someone from out
side of Stanford could be solved by a
preemptive naked romp in our gigan
tic bathtub. Moreover, interviewers
and administrators will be awed by
our dedication and our grades will
shoot up because of all the free time
we save that we normally waste on
hygiene. Life will be good. We will
have gotten through on the transmit
ter to R2D2 and C3PO.
I firmly believe that, upon reading
this proposal, students will be capti
vated by the prospect of wandering
around in a rank and sordid state for
three weeks or, perhaps, reducing
waste by 20 percent for three months.
United, we can and will accomplish
something as critical as filling the
lake. What we need are less easily
offended senses of smell and a few
more martyrs like Andy.
