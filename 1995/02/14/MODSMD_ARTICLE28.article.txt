## Men's tennis to battle Bulldogs 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
The top-ranked Stanford
men's tennis team (5-0) will take
to the courts of Stanford Tennis
Stadium this Saturday against a
talented squad from No. 21 Fres
no State (2-1).
According to the ITA Rolex
rankings, the Bulldogs have play
ers who are ranked higher than
the Cardinal's performers at
every position in the lineup
between numbers 2 and 5, as well
as at No. 1 doubles. This fact is
not lost on Stanford head coach
Dick Gould.
"It's going to be a good test,"
Gould said.
Fresno State may also be out
for a measure of revenge after the
Cardinal eliminated them from
the NCAA Tournament last year
with a 4-2 victory in the first
round. The two Bulldogs who
won their matches that day were
twin brothers Ryan and Bryan
Junio. They return this year to

play in the numbers four and five
spots in the lineup.
Unfortunately for the Junio
brothers, the two Cardinal net
ters that they defeated in straight
sets, Chris Cocotos and Vimal
Patel, have since graduated.
Instead, 34th-ranked Ryan will
face off tomorrow against 40th
ranked Paul Goldstein, and 60th
ranked Bryan will square off
against Jim Thomas.
Fresno State will be led by the
No. 9-ranked player in the
nation, freshman Fredrik Bergh.
A former Swedish Indoor Cham
pion and European doubles
champion, Bergh has impressed
in his first season with the Bull
dogs. Last Wednesday he scored
his team's only win of the day
against No. 29 New Mexico by
defeating 29th-ranked Tad
Berkowitz, 6-3,4-6, 6-2.
Bergh will have to deal with
Stanford's 6th-ranked Jeff
Salzenstein, who last Saturday
