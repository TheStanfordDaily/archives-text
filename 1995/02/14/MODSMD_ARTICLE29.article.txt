# Saint Valentine loved sports too!

### 
Vhlentine's Day has arrived,
and there's no better time for
a sports addict to reflect on
the greatness of the athletic arena.
So without further ado, here come
some random things I love about
sports. It's not the ESPYs, but pass
us the envelopes, please, anyway.

The Sacramento Kings: You
scoff. No, this is not a hockey team.
As a lifetime native of a place known
for almonds and poor excuses for
politicians, I greeted the arrival of
big-time sports with open arms 10
years ago. That is, if you can call
eight straight NBA seasons with
less than 30 wins big-time. Now, the
Kings boast a 25-20 record at the
All-Star break, and the team that
nobody's ever heard of sports the
All-Star MVP in Mitch Richmond.
It's always sweet to see a franchise
that's been in the dumps forever
come alive. Go Kings or go home.
Women's basketball: After
watching the Shaq Slam-Fest and
"insert-player-here" Pout-Fest of
the NBA, it's refreshing to walk into
Maples Pavilion and witness funda
mental basketball again. Of course,
it doesn't hurt that one of the pre
mier assemblages of women's bas
ketball talent plays a mere five
minute walk away from where I
live. Come watch Tara Van-
Derveer's squad, or most any
women's team, and you won't see
taunting, whining or hanging on
the rim. But you just might see a
dunk if you're lucky. I love this
game.
Pac-10 officiating
As if the games weren't exciting
enough, the zebras out West tend to
be less predictable than the contests
themselves. That three-ref rule sure

has helped things clean up, hey? It's
always nice to know that if the 10
people in shorts on the court fail to
provide excitement, the three guys
with whistles might do something
to awaken the crowd.

Todd Bozeman: Cal men's coach
extraordinaire also thinks about the
fans. Realizing that nothing excit
ing could possibly happen when
playing Cal State-Northridge bar
ring an earthquake, he decided to
start a little rumble of his own by
taking a swing at a Northridge ath
letic department official. Maybe it's
no wonder that with a two-point
lead and 1.6 seconds left in Sun
day's upset win over Arizona,
Sacramento boy Monty Buckley
intercepted a long pass and instead
of running out the clock, became
confused and transformed into the
Easter Bunny, hopping all over the
place. Traveling. The Wildcats near
ly made the Bears pay, but Joseph
Blair forgot how to catch at the
buzzer. Cal was lucky to survive
Monty Python, er, Buckley's gaffe,
but it's nice to see such a disciplined
team 0-5 at home in the Pac-10.
00p5... this was supposed to be
for April Fools', not Valentine's
Day. Sorry.
Dick Vitale: Yes e can some
times make you lunge lor the mute
button. But in an era with broad
casters masquerading as polished
professionals, Dicky Vee is a hit for
just being himself. Yeah, he's an All-
Dow Joneser, and you might think
he's a Diaper Dandy, but I'll call
him a PTP'er. If you're not a Vitale
fan (or maybe even if you are),
you're scratching your head now, so
fast forward t0...
Andre Agassi: This guy used to
occupy my idiot list. But after find
ing the game to match his consider
able image, he's given tennis the
shot in the arm that it lacked since
the days of McEnroe and Connors. I
don't know about the new 'do, but
I'd shave my head if I could return a
120 mph serve like Andre.
B>Nice guys finish first: It never
used to be this way. But since Leo


Jeremy
Stone
Durocher got elected to the Hall of
Fame, his famous adage has proven
untrue. Rudy Tomjanovich beat
the Bad Boys of New York. Tom
Osborne finally got a national
championship at Nebraska over the
high-struttin' hurricanes. Grant
Hill was the leading vote-getter for
the NBA All-Stars and was joined
by teammate Joe Dumars, even
though the Pistons might not be
the best team in Michigan right
now (ask anybody in East Lansing).
And Mike Montgomery, two years
removed from a brutal 7-23 season
that had some calling for his head,
has Stanford's men's basketball
team at No. 17 in the nation.
Old stadiums: Problem is, park

ing attendants share my love for
these. Every team with a creaky
facility filled with memories wants
a high-tech, corporate sponsored
place nowadays. Chicago Stadium
may have been the pits, but it
beats the sound of the United Cen
ter. I can't imagine the Celtics
playing on anything but the par
quet of the Garden, but it will hap
pen next year. And to think the
team that started the corporate
name bonanza with Arco Arena
was my very Kings makes me cry.
Of course, Sactown had no old sta
dium. Desperate times, desperate
measures.
The Golden State Warriors: In a
time when spoiled miscreants come
away unscathed due to superior
athletic talent, this team has been
granted what it deserves. Harbor
ing legitimate NBA Finals expecta
tions in October, Don Nelson and

Chris Webber played "Who's ego's
bigger?" and they both won. But
the Warriors lost â€” first Webber,
then lots of games (30 of their last
37), and now Nelson. And some
Warrior backers are pointing to the
team's injuries as the cause for its
demise. Try again.
The Los Angeles Clippers: This
perpetually woeful franchise is
keeping the Warriors from the cel
lar. Bill Fitch gets a pat on the back
in my book, because the only north
ern California team that should
ever be in last is the Kings. Oh, and
maybe Cal.
Old habits die hard. Happy
Valentine's Day.

Jeremy's partner in crime, Seth
Goldstein, loves that both UConn's
men's and women's hoops teams
are No. 1. One of their columns will
appear here on Tuesdays.
