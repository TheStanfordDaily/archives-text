Stanford 7
CSU-Los Angeles 0

The Stanford baseball team, which dropped from
first to fifth in the nation over the weekend, took out its
frustrations by drubbing Cal State-Los Angeles 7-0 at
Sunken Diamond yesterday afternoon.
Freshman Kyle Peterson pitched seven scoreless
innings to earn his first collegiate win as the Cardinal
improved to 6-4 on the year and the Golden Eagles fell
to 2-5.
"It feels good to finally go out and have a strong per
formance," Peterson said. "This was a big win for us.
We're going to have to win a lot of these weekday non
conference games."
Stanford jumped out to an early lead in the bottom of
the first inning when center fielder Cale Carter laced a
double to left field off of Doug DeLaGarza, the Cal State-
LA starter. Carter came around to score on a wild pitch,
giving the Cardinal a 1-0 lead that it would never relin
quish.
"It makes our job a lot easier when the hitters get
going," Peterson said. "Especially when we can score in
the first inning. The bats really came through today."
And Peterson hardly needed any help. The freshman
right-hander allowed just three base hits on the day —
only one of which left the infield — while striking out
seven Golden Eagles. Peterson is trying to solidify a spot
in the Cardinal pitching rotation after making his sec
ond start of the season.
Cal State-LA's only threat to score came in the top of
the fourth with Stanford ahead by the slim 1-0 margin.
After Fidencio Madero drew a leadoff walk, Golden
Eagle first baseman Robert Berns bounced an infield
single to put two men on with no outs. Left fielder Don
Kinney than grounded out to Cardinal shortstop Jay
Pecci — a walk-on freshman — to put runners on sec
ond and third.
But Peterson worked his way out of the jam, striking

out both designated hitter Brand
Caso and right fielder Jon Cornelius
to preserve the lead.
Stanford came back in the bot
tom of the inning, putting four runs
on the board to break open the
game. Left-fielder Troy Kent began
the rally by belting a single to right
field to extend his career long hit
ting streak to eight games.
"I'm just happy to be playing in
eight straight games," said Kent,
who went 2-for-4 on the day."I
didn't get much of a chance to play

last year and I'm just excited to con
tribute."
After right fielder Chris Clark
advanced Kent to second on a sacri
fice bunt, freshman Jon Schaeffer
picked up his second run batted in of
the year with a single up the middle.
A Brian Dallimore sacrifice fly and a
Cale Carter bunt single put the Car
dinal up 4-0.
"This was a big confidence boost
er for our team," Kent said. "It's a
great feeling to get everything
gelling and pick up a win."
The Cardinal added insurance in
the sixth when Schaeffer led off
with a walk. Left fielder Rich Crowe
— who finished 2-for-3 on the day
— then doubled down the third base

line to put runners on second and
third. Dallimore bounced to short
stop for an RBI, bringing Carter to
the plate with two out.
Carter capped an impressive day
with an RBI single up the middle.
The junior was 3-for-3 on the day
with two RBIs and a sacrifice bunt.
Sophomore right-handed reliev
er Mark Williams worked the final
two innings, striking out four while
not allowing a hit to pick up his first
save of the year.
Stanford pounded out 13 hits on
the afternoon while striking out just
once. Every Cardinal starter
reached base on a dreary afternoon
and Cal State-LA was unable to put
up much of a fight.
