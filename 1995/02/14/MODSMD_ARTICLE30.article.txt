CSU-Los Angeles 0

The Stanford baseball team, which dropped from
first to fifth in the nation over the weekend, took out its
frustrations by drubbing Cal State-Los Angeles 7-0 at
Sunken Diamond yesterday afternoon.
Freshman Kyle Peterson pitched seven scoreless
innings to earn his first collegiate win as the Cardinal
improved to 6-4 on the year and the Golden Eagles fell
to 2-5.
"It feels good to finally go out and have a strong per
formance," Peterson said. "This was a big win for us.
We're going to have to win a lot of these weekday non
conference games."
Stanford jumped out to an early lead in the bottom of
the first inning when center fielder Cale Carter laced a
double to left field off of Doug DeLaGarza, the Cal State-
LA starter. Carter came around to score on a wild pitch,
giving the Cardinal a 1-0 lead that it would never relin
quish.
"It makes our job a lot easier when the hitters get
going," Peterson said. "Especially when we can score in
the first inning. The bats really came through today."
And Peterson hardly needed any help. The freshman
right-hander allowed just three base hits on the day —
only one of which left the infield — while striking out
seven Golden Eagles. Peterson is trying to solidify a spot
in the Cardinal pitching rotation after making his sec
ond start of the season.
Cal State-LA's only threat to score came in the top of
the fourth with Stanford ahead by the slim 1-0 margin.
After Fidencio Madero drew a leadoff walk, Golden
Eagle first baseman Robert Berns bounced an infield
single to put two men on with no outs. Left fielder Don
Kinney than grounded out to Cardinal shortstop Jay
Pecci — a walk-on freshman — to put runners on sec
ond and third.
But Peterson worked his way out of the jam, striking
