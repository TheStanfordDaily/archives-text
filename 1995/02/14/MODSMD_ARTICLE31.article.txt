# Execution of fundamentals leads to Stanford victory

### Emery Chen Staff writer 
After a tough weekend set against Fresno
State, the Stanford baseball team found Cal
State-Los Angeles more to its liking.
In the process of defeating the Golden Bears,
the fifth-ranked Cardinal (6-4) pitched well and
did all of the little things to emerge victorious, 7-
0.
The acknowledged hero for Stanford was
freshman right hander Kyle Peterson.

"We got a real good pitching performance
from Peterson," coach Mark Marquess said.
"He's pitched well for us this season. He is going
to be a good pitcher. He has good poise and com
mand."
While it is easy to cite the pitching for its per
formance during the victory, the Cardinal
defense and offense must also be noted. Stanford
was solid in the field and the hitting for the Car
dinal was also strong but more importantly,
Stanford did the little things.
The first example of this came in the bottom of

the first inning. Center fielder Cale Carter hit a
ground ball past the diving Cal State-LA third
baseman Luis Rodriguez. Instead of stopping at
first, Carter tried for second and made it, sliding
under the tag.
Taking advantage of a wild pitch by starter
Doug DeLaGarza, Carter again showed off his
speed by rounding third and making it home
ahead of the throw by the catcher, Mike Lutter
loh. The run put the Cardinal on top, 1-0.
