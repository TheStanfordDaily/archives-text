# Cougar sighting!
## Women's tennis takes on WSU 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The Stanford women's tennis
squad has not been the most hos
pitable inhabitants of the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium thus far this
season. Nevertheless, the Wash
ington State Cougars (4-4) will
throw on their road jerseys and
step onto the Cardinal courts
Wednesday for an conference
dual match at 1:30 p.m.
"It will be a really good warm
up before the matches against the
Arizonas this weekend," said
freshman Ania Bleszynski.
The favored Cardinal has
dropped only three total matches
out of 36 this season, one of them
a forfeit due to injury. They have
yet to be defeated in a singles
match and rarely have the Stan
ford singles competitors even
needed a third set to dispose of
their opponents.
The third-ranked Cardinal is
fresh off a 6-3 victory over a Uni
versity of the Pacific team that

refused to throw in the towel
despite the fact that Stanford
clinched the victory in the meet's
first five singles matches. Pacific
hung on to take all three doubles
matches.
All of Washington State's four
losses have come to nationally
ranked teams. No. 7 UCLA swept
the Cougars in Los Angeles. The
Cougars also ran into trouble
against another Pacific 10 Con
ference opponent as No. 11 USC

tory. WSU nearly upset the No.

boys, but fell one match short in a
4-5 loss. Most recently, No. 36
Rice University took the Cougars
to the net, crushing them in a 7-2
triumph.

ing up at the service line with

petition at that spot this season,
such as UCLA's Keri Phebus.
That trend will continue for
Lin, who will clash with Ail-
American sophomore Katie
Schlukebir (3-0) if the Cardinal
are at full strength. Schlukebir
currently resides in the 10th
spot in national ranking.
The Cougars' most successful
competitor this season has been
freshmen Linette Visage. Visage
has compiled a 6-2 dual match

record while competing at either
the third, fourth or fifth singles
spot.
Visage may have some diffi
culty tomorrow, however, as
those spots have been dominated
by the Cardinal this season. San
dra De Silva, Julie Scott, and
Amy Chiminello have highlight
ed Stanford's incredible depth in
matches that seem to be shorter
than their designated warm-ups.
None of three have split sets in
their singles matches.
Washington State looks like
it has solidified their doubles
attack in the past three meets
after experimenting with differ

ent combinations earlier in the
Beason. The No. 1 slot has been
filled by Visage and sophomore
Narelle Hall. This 4-1 tandem
brings youth to the court as
does Stanford's No. 1 duo of
Schlukebir and Bleszynski. This
Cardinal team has seen murky
waters early this season, but has
shown signs of good things to
come.
If recent trends continue, the
Cougars will round out doubles
with Lin and junior Marcia
Senn (5-0) at the No. 2 position
and sophomores Kameran Ben
der and Sheetal Khanna (2-3) at
the No. 3 spot.
