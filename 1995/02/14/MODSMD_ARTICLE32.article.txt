# Cougar sighting!
## Women's tennis takes on WSU 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The Stanford women's tennis
squad has not been the most hos
pitable inhabitants of the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium thus far this
season. Nevertheless, the Wash
ington State Cougars (4-4) will
throw on their road jerseys and
step onto the Cardinal courts
Wednesday for an conference
dual match at 1:30 p.m.
"It will be a really good warm
up before the matches against the
Arizonas this weekend," said
freshman Ania Bleszynski.
The favored Cardinal has
dropped only three total matches
out of 36 this season, one of them
a forfeit due to injury. They have
yet to be defeated in a singles
match and rarely have the Stan
ford singles competitors even
needed a third set to dispose of
their opponents.
The third-ranked Cardinal is
fresh off a 6-3 victory over a Uni
versity of the Pacific team that

refused to throw in the towel
despite the fact that Stanford
clinched the victory in the meet's
first five singles matches. Pacific
hung on to take all three doubles
matches.
All of Washington State's four
losses have come to nationally
ranked teams. No. 7 UCLA swept
the Cougars in Los Angeles. The
Cougars also ran into trouble
against another Pacific 10 Con
ference opponent as No. 11 USC
got the best of them in a 6-3 vic
tory. WSU nearly upset the No.
47-ranked Oklahoma State Cow
boys, but fell one match short in a
4-5 loss. Most recently, No. 36
Rice University took the Cougars
to the net, crushing them in a 7-2
triumph.
Washington State has been lin
ing up at the service line with
Emma Lin playing in the top sin
gles spot, where she is currently
2-5. Lin, a senior from Tai Pei,
Taiwan, has met some fierce com
