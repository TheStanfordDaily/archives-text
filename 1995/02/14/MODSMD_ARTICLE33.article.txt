Cal State-Bakersfield's lofty rankings as the top
team in the Pacific 10 Conference and the No. 10
team in the nation failed to intimidate the Stanford
wrestling team on Sunday. On the road, the Cardi
nal put on a convincing display of its athletic
prowess, jumping out to a quick lead. But in the end,
the Roadrunners edged the Cardinal, 20-17, drop
ping the squad to 3-3 in the Pac-10, 3-5 overall.
"We couldn't have wrestled better," said head
coach Chris Horpel. "We had one of our best meets

against [BakersfieldJ. It was a very positive note to
end our dual meet season on."
The Cardinal split the ten matches with the
Roadrunners, winning five in a row at its strength,
the 126- through 158-pound divisions.
"Five of our better wrestlers came out on top
against some tough competition," Horpel said. "I
was very pleased."
The meet began with Bakersfield running out to
a 4-0 lead on Bobby Soto's 26-10 crushing of junior
Brian Mcßeth. Then the Cardinal streak began.
Junior Matt Cano slipped past 126-pound Coby
Wright in Stanford's first win of the night. Junior
co-captain Jimmy Aguirre (134 pounds) followed by
dominating Mike Mendoza, 12-3.
Senior co-captain Jay Jackson then faced the No.
1-ranked wrestler in the Pac-10 at
142 pounds, Tony Desouza. Desouza
had beaten Jackson four times last
season. Sunday turned out differ
ently as Jackson held on for a 6-5 vic
tory.
Juniors Tod Surmon (150
pounds) and Salilan Martin (158
pounds) finished off the five match
win streak with wins over Jason
Ramstetter and Mickey Hitter,
respectively. The string of victories
gave the Cardinal a commanding 17-
4 lead heading into the upper weight
classes.

"We're confident," Aguirre said.
"The middle of our lineup is holding
up really strong."
Unfortunately, the upper divi
sion matches did not turn out as suc
cessfully. Injuries kept junior Mark
Ryzewicz and sophomore Roger Liu
from competing. Bakersfield's John
McCreary defeated Ryzewicz's
replacement, freshman Matt Von
der Ahe, 12-3. Junior Tom Irwin,
who usually wrestles at 158 pounds,
filled in for the 177-pound Liu. Sev
enth-ranked Roadrunner Derek
Scott pinned him in 57 seconds.
Jassen Froelich tied the score at
17 with an 8-2 win over sophomore
Brian Vaniman in the 190-pound
bout, putting the match in the hands
of the heavyweights.

"We needed one more win [to
take the dual meet]," said Horpel,
"but we didn't match up well in the
upper weights."
In the end, the Bakersfield heavy
weight, Paschal Durn came out on
top, outscoring freshman Mark
Neglay, 8-1, to give the meet to the
Road runners.
"We had a really good meet to win
five out of 10 against Bakersfield,'
Aguirre said. "We're peaking at the
end of the year. We're wrestling with
a higher level of intensity and confi
dence."
Horpel was also satisfied with the
team's gutsy performance.
"I feel great where we are right
now," Horpel said. "We're exactly
where we want to be."
