Cal State-Bakersfield's lofty rankings as the top
team in the Pacific 10 Conference and the No. 10
team in the nation failed to intimidate the Stanford
wrestling team on Sunday. On the road, the Cardi
nal put on a convincing display of its athletic
prowess, jumping out to a quick lead. But in the end,
the Roadrunners edged the Cardinal, 20-17, drop
ping the squad to 3-3 in the Pac-10, 3-5 overall.
"We couldn't have wrestled better," said head
coach Chris Horpel. "We had one of our best meets

against [BakersfieldJ. It was a very positive note to
end our dual meet season on."
The Cardinal split the ten matches with the
Roadrunners, winning five in a row at its strength,
the 126- through 158-pound divisions.
"Five of our better wrestlers came out on top
against some tough competition," Horpel said. "I
was very pleased."
The meet began with Bakersfield running out to
a 4-0 lead on Bobby Soto's 26-10 crushing of junior
Brian Mc√üeth. Then the Cardinal streak began.
Junior Matt Cano slipped past 126-pound Coby
Wright in Stanford's first win of the night. Junior
co-captain Jimmy Aguirre (134 pounds) followed by
dominating Mike Mendoza, 12-3.
Senior co-captain Jay Jackson then faced the No.
