# Both men and women place second at regatta
## Double deuce for sailing team 
### Mike Jensen Contributing writer 
This weekend the Stanford sailing team traveled
south to Los Angeles for the South 3 and 4 fleet rac
ing regatta. Going into the competition, Stanford
hoped to check the progress of the women's team and
to provide valuable experience for some new sailors.
Coming out, the Cardinal had accomplished these
goals and came away with two second place finishes.
Stanford managed to overcome weak winds on
Saturday to post an impressive finish. The regatta
was divided into A and B divisions, with the combined
results of both divisions determining the outcome of
each day's competition. Freshman skipper Phil
Barow teamed with crew Barry Kang to finish first in

the A division. The team of Rolf Kaiser and Pauley
Brovm performed well in the B division, finishing
first. However, the duo was later disqualified
because of a minor infraction. The remainder of the
squad provided enough depth to earn Stanford a sec
ond place finish on the day.
Coach Steve Bourdow was pleased with his team's
performance, especially that of Barow. One of Stan
ford's top recruits, Barow had been working hard to
make the adjustment to a different class of boats and
the stiffer collegiate competition.
"I was psyched with the way Phil and Bary did on
Saturday. Phil showed he could be a player," Bour
dow said.
Barow admits that making the transition to the
college level has been tough, but he is
confident Saturday is a step in the
right direction.
"I was really happy with the way I
sailed," he said, adding, "I finally
started to put stuff together that I
had been working on all year."
Although the regatta was a co-ed

event, Stanford focused on the
women's team during Sunday's
competition. Powered by stronger
winds, Gretchen Uznis and Sibyl
Diver provided Stanford's best
showing in the A division. In the B
division, Cinnamon Hampikian
teamed with crew Noelle Marquis to
capture second place. The squad
combined for a second place finish
on Sunday.
Alice Manard and Abigail Kramer
also caught the coach's eye with a

strong performance in the A division.
Racing together for the first time, the
two overcame some inconsistent sail
ing with aggressive tactics described
by Bourdow as "nice to see."
The coach used the races to iden
tify the strengths and weaknesses of
the women's team. He was
impressed with what he saw.
"I got a real good view of solid rac
ing. Our boat handling was as good
as anyone there. Our speed was very
good," Bourdow said.
