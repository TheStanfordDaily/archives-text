# Fencers return from East
## Men and women take different roads at Duke 
### Jason Weintraub Contributing writer 
Faced with stiff competition from defending
national champion Notre Dame and perennial
powerhouse North Carolina, Stanford's men's
and women's fencing teams were forced to fight
hard to improve their reputation on the East
Coast in a tournament at Duke over the weekend.
The men won three of their four matches while
the women took one of three.
For the first time in four years, the men's
team defeated the University of North Carolina,
wining 17 out of 27 matches. The Cardinal was
led by foilists Sean McClain and Geoff Donaker,
and epee specialists Doug Vanderbilt and Chris
Connell. Stanford defeated William and Mary by
a score of 20-7, and the team also beat host Duke
in a dramatic match that ended with the Cardinal
on top 14-13.
"It was great to beat Duke on their home
turf," said Stanford men's coach Zoran Tulum.
"The most impressive victory, though, was the
win over North Carolina. They have given us
trouble for the last three or four years."
The Cardinal was unable to sustain the
momentum against powerful Notre Dame, how
ever, as the Fighting Irish exploited Stanford's
lack of depth. Although Stanford's top fencers,
such as McClain and Donaker, can compete suc
cessfully on a national level, each team must use
three or four fencers in match competition.
Unable to give scholarships to outstanding high
school fencers, Stanford must fill its team with
students taking the fencing physical education
class in Roble Gym.
"Against Notre Dame, the men's foil team was
basically competing two against three," Tulum
said, noting that McClain and Donaker were the

only foilists who could be counted on for wins.
Despite the lack of depth, the foil team won four
of the nine matches against the Irish, with Don
aker losing the last bout in a heartbreaker, 5-4.
Unable to get enough wins from either the men's
epee or sabre teams, the Cardinal lost the overall
match 19-8.
Stanford's lack of depth was even more appar
ent in the women's matches, as the team strug
gled to a 1-3 record against the East Coast pow
ers. The epee team, led by juniors Morgan Hoch
and Stephanie Wien, performed admirably,
defeating two of the four schools it fenced while
narrowly losing to both North Carolina and
Notre Dame, dropping both matches by a 9-7
score.
"I expected us to beat North Carolina," Tulum
said. "At one point, we were up 6-3, but we only
won one bout after that." Without an experienced
foil team to pick up some wins, the women could
only muster one team victory, that being a 21-11
pasting of James Madison. Stanford lost to Duke
19-13, to North Carolina 22-10, and to Notre
Dame, 25-7.
"The women's foil team fenced the best they
could considering their lack of experience,"
Tulum said. "Michelle Butler performed very
well, winning 50 percent of her matches against
the toughest competition in the nation."
The East Coast competition helped the Cardi
nal prepare for the Western Regional National
Collegiate Athletic Association Tournament,
which will be held in two weeks. This tournament
will decide who qualifies for the NCAA tourna
ment.
"If we fence like we've been fencing all year,"
Tulum said, "we will win Western Regionals."
When that happens, the Cardinal will get their
second crack at those beasts from the East.
