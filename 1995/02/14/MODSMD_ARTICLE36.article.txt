United they stand; divided, they barely
fall.
The Stanford synchronized swimming
squad split in two this weekend, as half the
team made the trek to Seattle while the rest
ventured to Buffalo. On Saturday, the
group in Washington handed its Pacific 10
Conference rivals a 100.5-46 defeat. The
next day, the unit in Buffalo squared off at
the Canisius Invitational, a double dual
meet featuring the Golden Griffins, Cornell
and Keuka College. Host Canisius edged the
Cardinal by nine, 85-76, while Stanford
routed Keuka College and Cornell 88-46.
The second-ranked Stanford squad had
its way with the Huskies, as the Cardinal

swept the senior figures event, notching the
top four finishes. Junior All-American Julie
Davies led the way with an impressive score
of 54.19, with fellow junior Jen Graves fol
lowing close behind at 51.67. Senior Jenny
Curtis and freshman Julie Petho rounded
out the leader board with marks of 51.20
and 50.32, respectively.
Davies, who also controlled the solo
event with a 12.4 point margin of victory
over Washington's Grace Holmes, acknowl
edged that both she and the squad were glad
to get their feet wet to start the season.
"We're pretty pleased overall with how
we did," said the team's co-captain. "It was
pretty rough, but it was our first meet.
There were still some quirks in my routine,
and it certainly wasn't my best swim. But
this is the best way to figure things out."

While Davies' victories were almost fore
gone conclusions, Stanford's dominance
extended to the other figures events as well.
Freshman Courtney Harrison topped two
Huskies with a mark of 37.20 in the juniors,
and in the novice class, freshman Megan Fix
stole the show with a 28.74, followed by
junior transfer Beth Mangini's 26.23.
The Cardinal also controlled the group
events, as Davies and Graves blew their
competitors out of the water. Mangini and
Fix edged out the team of Holmes and
Jenny Hall of Washington for second.
Fix's performance was especially
remarkable, as she came away with victories
in her first competitive meet. Now in only
her third year of experience at all, the effer
vescent freshman overcame her early-sea
son jitters.

"Actually, I was really surprised just
because I didn't really know what to
expect," Fix said. "Beth and I were really
nervous. You see all the judges out there,
and it's like, 'Wow, they're all looking at
us.'"
The judges were also on hand in Buffalo,
but the group of Jill Evans and the Graham
sisters, Karen and Kristin, were too much
for the outmanned Cardinal. Weir was still
pleased with the short-handed squad's
showing.
"At Canisius, we didn't do as well," Weir
said. "Part of the problem was that we
didn't have the whole team. If we had taken
the whole team to New York, I'm very con
fident that we would have won."
Evans took the solo competition by 3.4
points over Stanford sophomore co-captain

Maia Young, who was followed closely by
sophomore teammate Eunice Woods.
Woods teamed up with fellow sophomore
Bridget Finn to place runner-up to the Gra
ham sisters in the duet. Young and junior
Amy Markezich placed third. Stanford also
placed behind the Golden Griffins in the trio
and team events, but dominated the War
riors and the Big Red.
Young took the early-season runner-up
finish in stride.
"It was a good experience for us," Young
said. "Obviously it didn't come together as
we would have liked, but as our first meet, it
was good to start the competition mode."
As the perennial bridesmaid to national
powerhouse Ohio State, Stanford will once
again attempt to assert itself as the top
squad west of the Mississippi.
