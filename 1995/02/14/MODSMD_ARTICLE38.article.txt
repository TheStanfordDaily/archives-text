# Baird aims for more assault awareness
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Contributing Writer 
After being appointed Stanford's new
half-time sexual assault prevention coordi
nator in December, Sally Baird has settled
into her post and has already formulated
plans to improve sexual assault programs on
campus.
Baird said she is not concentrating on
creating new programs, but is working to
increase awareness of groups and programs
which already offer education on sexual
assault.
"It's not so much new stuff, but I would
like to work with student groups and help
revitalize them," Baird said.
She cited the Coalition Against Sexual
Assault (CASA) as one group she is trying to
assist.
"Most of CASA's key members are
seniors who will be leaving after this year,"
Baird said. "There is a definite need for new
leadership to pick up where (the seniors)
will leave off," she said.
Baird said the reduction of ASSU funding
to sexual assault programming and related
areas has had a negative, but not devastat
ing, effect on interest and participation in
student groups who offer programming on
those issues.
"We've had to deal with (the loss of fund
ing), but mostly we are devoting our ener
gies into drawing more active student par
ticipation," Baird said.
She added that she is currently research
ing plans and gathering information by
meeting with CASA, Assoc. Director of Res

idential Education Diana Conklin and resi
dential assistants in order to formulate
ideas and ways of increasing campus aware
ness on the issue of sexual assault.
"I could have just come in and done work
shops, but this position demands something
different, something more," Baird said.
As the half-time coordinator, Baird said
she is a "resource person here to offer
advice, support and to coordinate ideas."
Baird had less than two months to get set
tled into her new position. She was appoint
ed just before winter break and did not get
the chance to acquaint herself with many of
her co-workers until after the holiday.
"I'm still getting oriented," Baird said. In
addition to meeting with campus groups,
Baird said she is trying to learn more about
the Cowell Health Center staff and Univer
sity procedures.
But Baird is no stranger when it comes to
helping the University educate its students
about sexual assault. Prior to her appoint
ment two months ago, Baird had come to
Stanford on several previous occasions to
hold seminars and workshops for student
groups like CASA.
She was appointed to a University com
mittee created to look into sexual assault,
which continues to meet to find campus
wide policies to deal with the problem of sex
ual assault.
Baird comes to Stanford with over 10
years experience in rape crisis management
and sexual assault prevention program
ming. She was the director of the Mid-
Peninsula Rape Crisis Hotline before being
appointed to her new position.
