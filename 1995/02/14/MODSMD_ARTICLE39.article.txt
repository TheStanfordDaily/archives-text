Two out of the three people
who spoke at former English
Prof. Denise Levertov's reading
last night, including Levertov
herself, were wearing shiny gold
clothing. Levertov's softly read
presentation of 21 poems and
three prose pieces, however, was
anything but gaudy.
who taught under
graduate and graduate poetry
workshops at Stanford from
1982 to 1993, is considered one
of the most important American
poets of the past 20 years.
Born in Ilford, England in
1923, Levertov migrated to the
United States in the late 1940s
and proceeded to write what is
described as "social" and "mys
tical" poetry. Both themes came
out in last night's reading.
After an introduction by
English Profs. Elizabeth Tallent
and Albert Gelpi, Levertov
began reciting mostly unpub
lished poems which illustrated
the much — acclaimed mystery
of her writing — such as "Rain
bow Weather," "Witness Incom
municado" and "Primal Speech"
— to an almost-full Kresge Audi
torium.
Lines like "They speak of
bonding, of the infinite, of the
primitive without boundary,"
drew quiet, polite applause from
the audience.
Levertov's poems also
reached the realm of the overtly
playful. In "Meeting the Fer
ret," Levertov mused about a
friendly ferret, almost as if he
were a lover. "Primal Speech"
was scattered with phrases like
"hiding out like a pigmy ptero
dactyl in the woods."
With barely a trace of an
English accent and every sylla
ble meticulously enunciated,
even words such as "canker"
sounded elegant and personal.
The themes of Levertov's poems
and prose subtly merged into
each other, transitioning from
poems about her present home,
Seattle, to overtly political
poems, to prose about her child
hood.

"The Haze and Green Moon"
alternated subjects of this sum
mer's comet crashes on Jupiter
and the suffering created in the
modern political world in such
countries as Haiti. "Absurd fig
ures, Michelin tire logos bounced
on the moon, whitely young
men's bodies, hands tied behind
them, litter the streets of Port
au-Prince."
"An Encounter and Re
encounter" was an essay which
touched on themes of growing
from childhood to adulthood,
focusing on Levertov's adven
ture of joining the communist
party as a 12 year old.
Levertov's prose was taken
from "Tesserae: Memories and
Suppositions" which will be

released in May.
"The Cult of Relics" and "A
Loss" were written about mate
rial objects which related both
physically and spiritually to peo
ple and experiences close to Lev
ertov: "Links to hands long
gone."
Friendship was a heavily
explored topic. "The Trace"
whimsically described the dan
gers and pleasures of desiring
male friends; "Complaint and
Rejoinder" explored ideas of dis
tance between friends and peo
ple in general.
Levertov concluded with
"Primary Wonder," a typically
mystical poem. "The mystery
that this is anything, anything
at all," she read.
