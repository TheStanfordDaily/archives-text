# BSU discusses affirmative action
## Topic of University admissions sparks lively debate 
### Martin L. Yeung Contributing Writer 
Encouraging black students "not
to get sucked into the 'trick bag'
making them feel less than they
are," Dean of Students Michael
Jackson spoke yesterday at a group
discussion on affirmative action
held by the Black Student Union.
Speaking before a crowd of about
30 students in Ujamaa lounge,
Jackson, who was joined by Assoc.
Director of Undergraduate Admis
sions Julie Taylor, defended the

University's affirmative action pro
grams designed to recruit and re
tain targeted minority groups.
"Who is affirmative action help
ing and who is it hurting?" Taylor
asked. "The myth is that we are
helping blacks and minorities at the
expense of white applicants," she
said.
Taylor said that race is only one
of many factors the Admissions Of
fice looks at in evaluating candi
dates.
"What has the candidate done in
relation to the circumstances she or

he was presented with? No one is
equal in an applicant pool of 15,000
.. .our task is to build a diverse class
and not to admit a person on the
basis of one attribute," Taylor said.
But during the question period,
one audience member asked Taylor
and Jackson why the Admissions
Office asks for a candidate's racial
background on the application.
"In 1968, there were about 100
[minority] people at Stanford — pe
riod," said Jackson. "[The race
check ofT] is not an absolute scale. It

allows us to define a candidate and
factor that in with all the other indi
vidual merits, and why not? Minori
ties have been discriminated
against for hundreds of years. Let's
call a spade a spade. The truth is,
race matters," said Jackson.
Jackson recalled his own experi
ence as a beneficiary of affirmative
action. As an elite California prep
school was trying to integrate, they
offered him a scholarship to
attend.
"Whether or not I took a spot
away from an equally qualified
white person, I don't know. I do
know that because of those oppor
tunities, my life was changed,"
Jackson said.
Taylor noted that the goal of the
Admissions Office was not to create
mere diversity but a class where
diverse talents and individual merit
count more than just race.

Jackson also pointed out that
racial preferences were just one of
the "zillions" of affirmative action
plans in society which benefit cer
tain members but don't garner the
amount of hostility and attention
racially based programs get.
"There are legacies that get a
preference and athletic scholarships
which give a full ride, but they don't
get nearly the same amount of
attention as this," said Jackson.
Jackson said because the "eco
nomic pie" was not getting bigger,
there is a growing backlash from
the establishment to curtail the few
gains minorities had made in the
past 20 years due in part to affirma
tive action programs. He cited
efforts to eliminate affirmative
action policies in California and the
conservative rhetoric coming from
Congress as examples.
"The backlash is real, but it's
more about a myth than reality,"
Jackson said. "These attacks are an
insidious approach, a smoke screen,
a myth that's scaring people into
believing that the white majority

[at Stanford) will soon become a
minority."
Taylor said the Admissions
Office receives letters from white
applicants questioning if minority
admissions had somehow affected
their own chances for admittance
into Stanford.
"Our [target minority| numbers
have changed little in 10 years.
There's only 1,600 spaces, and the
rise in Asian students has increased
Stanford's minority population to
around 50 percent. It appears to
some out there that the whites in
the majority may soon become the
minority," Taylor said.
But Taylor sounded a unifying
message for the audience at the end
of the discussion.
"We admit some of the best
white applicants and some of the
best black applicants," she said.
"The fact is we have some of the
best students in the country, and it
wasn't based all on scores or race.
You all have the great potential to
achieve, and that's what you need
to do."
