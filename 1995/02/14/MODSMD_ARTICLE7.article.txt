### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
A new proposal to reform the
Cultures, Ideas and Values pro
gram and distribution require
ments met with support at a facul
ty forum yesterday.
History Prof. Paul Seaver, di
rector of the CIV program, out
lined his recommendation to facul
ty at the forum, which took place
in the History Corner and was
sponsored by the Humanities and
Sciences Council to gather input
on the proposal it developed at a
meeting two weeks ago.
The proposal from the council
and Seaver's recommendation
yesterday have been offered as al
ternatives to the original plan for
the CIV program outlined by the

Commission on Undergraduate
Education â€” bringing the total
number of DR plans on the table to
three.
Seaver's proposal calls for each
CIV track to fulfill the Area 1 DR,
which it currently fulfills, plus one
other DR, either Area 7, 8 or 9
(currently Literature and the Fine
Arts; Philosophical, Social and Re
ligious Thought; and Social and
Behavioral Sciences, respectively).
Students would then have to
take three more classes from Areas
2 (World Cultures), 3 (American
Cultures), 7, 8 or 9. With these
four classes and the three science
requirements, the total number of
DRs would be reduced by two,
Seaver said after the meeting.
