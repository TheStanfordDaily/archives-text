# Alternative CIV proposal gains faculty support
## Profs discuss revisions to CUE report 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
A new proposal to reform the
Cultures, Ideas and Values pro
gram and distribution require
ments met with support at a facul
ty forum yesterday.
History Prof. Paul Seaver, di
rector of the CIV program, out
lined his recommendation to facul
ty at the forum, which took place
in the History Corner and was
sponsored by the Humanities and
Sciences Council to gather input
on the proposal it developed at a
meeting two weeks ago.
The proposal from the council
and Seaver's recommendation
yesterday have been offered as al
ternatives to the original plan for
the CIV program outlined by the

Commission on Undergraduate
Education — bringing the total
number of DR plans on the table to
three.
Seaver's proposal calls for each
CIV track to fulfill the Area 1 DR,
which it currently fulfills, plus one
other DR, either Area 7, 8 or 9
(currently Literature and the Fine
Arts; Philosophical, Social and Re
ligious Thought; and Social and
Behavioral Sciences, respectively).
Students would then have to
take three more classes from Areas
2 (World Cultures), 3 (American
Cultures), 7, 8 or 9. With these
four classes and the three science
requirements, the total number of
DRs would be reduced by two,
Seaver said after the meeting.
The Literature and the Arts
CIV track, for example, might ful
fill Areas 1 (CIV) and 7 (Literature
and the Fine Arts) under Seaver's
proposal. A student in this track
would then take three courses from
Areas 2, 3, 8 or 9.
"Each CIV track would desig
nate itself as fulfilling either 7, 8 or
9," Seaver said.
The biggest benefit of his pro
posal, Seaver said, is "that I was
told the [Faculty] Senate wanted to
eliminate two DRs and that would
do it."
The commission suggested in its
report that the total number of
DRs be reduced by two, folding
Areas 2 and 3 — the two culture
requirements — into the CIV pro
gram.
There has been little support for
the commission's proposal; 40 fac
ulty members in the CIV program
last month signed a letter of
protest which was published in
Campus Report, claiming that the
CIV program would be overbur
dened if it had to cover any more
material in its already full curricu
lum.

"I think [Seaver's] proposal is
terrific," said Faculty Senate Chair
Bob Simoni, a biology professor. "It
goes a long way to what the com
mission proposed by... asking CIV
to do a bit more, but not so much
that faculty don't know what to
teach."
The third proposal comes from
the Humanities and Sciences
Council. This recommendation
would redesign the CIV program to
fulfill the Area 1 requirement plus
either the Area 2 or the Area 3
requirement.
Seaver said his proposal will
make it easier to determine how
CIV fulfills a second requirement.
Whereas Areas 2 and 3 might
require the CIV tracks to adapt to
include new material, he said, the
tracks already fit easily into Areas
7, 8 or 9.
In fact, some tracks could be
applied to more than one area,
Seaver said. "One of the track
chairs was noting (at yesterday's
meeting] that in cases where it
could go two ways ... it could be
the student's choice," he said.
"There are some details that
have to be worked out, but no one
seemed to think it would be impos
sible," he said.
History Prof. Judith Brown, a

member of the council, said she
was pleased with the changes made
to her initial proposal.
"We went into the meeting with
what we believed to be a good pro
posal and the faculty modified it in
a very constructive way," she said.
"What we emerged with is an even
better ... and very workable pro
posal."
Faculty members also discussed
the possibility of eliminating the
course certification program for
classes in Areas 7, 8 and 9, Simoni
said.
Any class of any level in the Reli
gious Studies Department, for
example, would fulfill the Philo
sophical, Social and Religious
Thought DR.
Courses listed as fulfilling DRs
currently must go through a pro
cess of certification, Simoni said.
The only requirement for certifica
tion outside of following the formal
process is that it be an introductory
course, which means a course with
no prerequisite, he said.
"The certification process has
become sort of a joke," Simoni said.
"Nothing is turned down. The rare
course that isn't certified is resub
mitted and then it's certified."
By eliminating the process, stu
dents would have the opportunity

to fill DRs with higher-level cours
es.
"The advantage of doing it that
way is the student who wants to
take an advanced course could do
it," Seaver said. "That's an
admirable thing to do and the stu
dents won't be inhibited. To some
degree, the present system does do
that."
As for the faculty reaction at
yesterday's meeting, Seaver said,
"I don't know that there was wild
enthusiasm." But, he added, "I
hope the fact that Bob Simoni and
several members of the [Faculty
Senate] Steering Committee
seemed open to the idea means that
it will have a chance with the sen
ate."
The steering committee will dis
cuss Seaver's proposal at a meeting
tomorrow, Simoni said.
At the forum, the proposal was
"widely supported," Simoni said,
although he noted that only 37 peo
ple were in attendance.
The consensus among those fac
ulty members was a good start,
though, he said.
"I think nearly everyone's hope
is that some solution can be found
that will draw this to a close quick
ly," Simoni said. "I think the solu
tion is in sight."
