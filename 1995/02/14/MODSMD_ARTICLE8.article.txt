# University settles harassment claim
## Former employee might have sued ex-coach Green, Stanford 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Contributing Writer 
In order to prevent former
Stanford football coach Dennis
Green and the University from
being named defendants in a sexu
al harassment lawsuit, the Uni
versity settled a former employ
ee's gender discrimination suit
last month, a few days before a
scheduled Jan. 13 hearing, two
major newspapers have reported.
Green was the Stanford foot
ball coach from 1989-91, after
which he left to take a job as head
coach of the Minnesota Vikings.
According to a Friday Min
neapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune ar
ticle, the woman, who filed the
lawsuit in April 1992, told the
court that if Stanford did not set
tle, she would change her claim to
include both the University and
an unnamed person as defendants
in a sexual harassment suit. The
San Jose Mercury-News carried
the accusations Saturday.

The case file
has now been
sealed, according
to the dockets'
clerk of Federal
Judge Claudia
Wilken. The ac
cuser has insist
ed upon
anonymity in the
press.

Stanford at
torney Michael Vartain declined
to comment on the case. "We
don't, as a policy, comment on
matters in litigation," he said.
The woman's allegations in
clude that Green offered to safe
guard her job from budget cuts in
the Athletic Department in ex
change for sex. She also accused
Green of grabbing the woman in
her hotel room after she rejected
his advances before the 1991
Aloha Bowl, the newspapers re
ported.
