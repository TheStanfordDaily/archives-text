# University settles harassment claim
## Former employee might have sued ex-coach Green, Stanford 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Contributing Writer 
In order to prevent former
Stanford football coach Dennis
Green and the University from
being named defendants in a sexu
al harassment lawsuit, the Uni
versity settled a former employ
ee's gender discrimination suit
last month, a few days before a
scheduled Jan. 13 hearing, two
major newspapers have reported.
Green was the Stanford foot
ball coach from 1989-91, after
which he left to take a job as head
coach of the Minnesota Vikings.
According to a Friday Min
neapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune ar
ticle, the woman, who filed the
lawsuit in April 1992, told the
court that if Stanford did not set
tle, she would change her claim to
include both the University and
an unnamed person as defendants
in a sexual harassment suit. The
San Jose Mercury-News carried
the accusations Saturday.

The case file
has now been
sealed, according
to the dockets'
clerk of Federal
Judge Claudia
Wilken. The ac
cuser has insist
ed upon
anonymity in the
press.

Stanford at
torney Michael Vartain declined
to comment on the case. "We
don't, as a policy, comment on
matters in litigation," he said.
The woman's allegations in
clude that Green offered to safe
guard her job from budget cuts in
the Athletic Department in ex
change for sex. She also accused
Green of grabbing the woman in
her hotel room after she rejected
his advances before the 1991
Aloha Bowl, the newspapers re
ported.


Green
Green denied the allegations,
the Star Tribune reported. He
was out of town yesterday and
could not be reached by The
Daily's reporter.
"I have never sexually
harassed anyone at Stanford Uni
versity. I have never sexually
harassed anyone," Green said in
the Star Tribune. "I have never
physically assaulted anyone in my
entire life."
Stanford Athletic Director Ted
Leland declined to comment on
the issue.
Former Athletic Director Andy
Geiger said he did not know about
Green's alleged improprieties.
"I left Stanford in September
1990. I don't recall anything
about (either a suit or any impro
prieties)," Geiger said. "Whatever
happened, happened later. We
never had any incident like that
happen that I can recall."
The Vikings organization also
denied knowledge of the incident.
"We did a background check
[on Green] and never heard any
thing bad out of Stanford," said
David Pelletier, director of public
relations for the Vikings.
According to the Star Tribune,
the woman was hired in 1991.
The woman said that at first, her
relationship with Green was posi
tive, but changed soon after.
Green allegedly started taking
her out to lunch and dinner,
always on the pretext of business.
Often, the papers stated, the two
discussed sex and job security at a
time when there were widespread
fears of layoffs in the Athletic
Department.
Green reportedly told the
woman that he would safeguard
her job in exchange for sex. The
woman refused, citing the improp
er nature of such a relationship.
The two papers also reported
that Green had booked the
woman into a different hotel than
the team during a 1991 trip to the
Aloha Bowl; that on Christmas
Eve, the night before the game,
Green allegedly came to the
woman's hotel room and ordered
her to have sex with him; and that
she resisted and told Green that
he should be with his family.
Green reportedly persisted and
grabbed the woman by her arms
on the balcony of her room. Soon

after, she told Green to leave and
he did.
In January 1991, Green was
named coach of the Vikings. The
Star Tribune reported that Green
wrote the woman a letter which
led her to think that she could get
a job with the Vikings and
assured her that he would not be
her supervisor.
The job, however, was not one
with the team. Green supposedly
told her that he would give her
$30,000 to set up an image con
sulting business. Since Green
would again be her boss, the
woman refused, according to the
Star Tribune.
In April 1992, Bill Walsh was
hired as football coach and the
woman was fired. She subse
quently filed a gender discrimina
tion complaint with Equal
Employment Opportunity Com
mission (EEOC).
According to the Star Tribune,
the EEOC ruled against her. She
appealed her case to the U.S. Dis
trict Court.
A spokesman from the EEOC
declined to comment.
These allegations of sexual
harassment are not the first to be
leveled against Green. Last
month, he was also accused in an
affidavit to a sexual harassment
charge against Vikings assistant
coach Richard Solomon, the Star
Tribune reported.
Green also allegedly harassed a
hotel representative who did busi
ness with the Vikings two years
ago, former Vikings director of
operations Dan Endy said. The
charges in this incident mirror
those of the former Athletic
Department employee, according
to the Star Tribune.
"At first the [relationship]
started out business-oriented. It
worked its way toward inappro
priateness," Endy said. "There
was a pattern of him trying to
ingratiate himself in her life."
Endy said he believes Green
was a subtle harasser, at first not
openly coercive.
"He made [her] meet him at
6:00 a.m. on Tuesday for breakfast
if the Vikings won," Endy claimed.
"She felt like she had to do this."
Endy claimed that Green's
demands continued to escalate
and he called the woman later and
later at night making suggestive
comments such as, "You know
you want me," and, "One day you
will wake up and find that you do
and it will be too late."

1990. I don't recall anything
about (either a suit or any impro
prieties)," Geiger said. "Whatever
happened, happened later. We
never had any incident like that
happen that I can recall."
The Vikings organization also
denied knowledge of the incident.
"We did a background check
[on Green] and never heard any
thing bad out of Stanford," said
David Pelletier, director of public
relations for the Vikings.
According to the Star Tribune,
the woman was hired in 1991.
The woman said that at first, her
relationship with Green was posi
tive, but changed soon after.
Green allegedly started taking
her out to lunch and dinner,
always on the pretext of business.
Often, the papers stated, the two
discussed sex and job security at a
time when there were widespread
fears of layoffs in the Athletic
Department.
Green reportedly told the
woman that he would safeguard
her job in exchange for sex. The
woman refused, citing the improp
er nature of such a relationship.
The two papers also reported
that Green had booked the
woman into a different hotel than
the team during a 1991 trip to the
Aloha Bowl; that on Christmas
Eve, the night before the game,
Green allegedly came to the
woman's hotel room and ordered
her to have sex with him; and that
she resisted and told Green that
he should be with his family.
Green reportedly persisted and
grabbed the woman by her arms
on the balcony of her room. Soon

after, she told Green to leave and
he did.
In January 1991, Green was
named coach of the Vikings. The
Star Tribune reported that Green
wrote the woman a letter which
led her to think that she could get
a job with the Vikings and
assured her that he would not be
her supervisor.
The job, however, was not one
with the team. Green supposedly
told her that he would give her
$30,000 to set up an image con
sulting business. Since Green
would again be her boss, the
woman refused, according to the
Star Tribune.
In April 1992, Bill Walsh was
hired as football coach and the
woman was fired. She subse
quently filed a gender discrimina
tion complaint with Equal
Employment Opportunity Com
mission (EEOC).
According to the Star Tribune,
the EEOC ruled against her. She
appealed her case to the U.S. Dis
trict Court.
A spokesman from the EEOC
declined to comment.
These allegations of sexual
harassment are not the first to be
leveled against Green. Last
month, he was also accused in an
affidavit to a sexual harassment
charge against Vikings assistant
coach Richard Solomon, the Star
Tribune reported.
Green also allegedly harassed a
hotel representative who did busi
ness with the Vikings two years
ago, former Vikings director of
operations Dan Endy said. The
charges in this incident mirror
those of the former Athletic
Department employee, according
to the Star Tribune.
"At first the [relationship]
started out business-oriented. It
worked its way toward inappro
priateness," Endy said. "There
was a pattern of him trying to
ingratiate himself in her life."
Endy said he believes Green
was a subtle harasser, at first not
openly coercive.
"He made [her] meet him at
6:00 a.m. on Tuesday for breakfast
if the Vikings won," Endy claimed.
"She felt like she had to do this."
Endy claimed that Green's
demands continued to escalate
and he called the woman later and
later at night making suggestive
comments such as, "You know
you want me," and, "One day you
will wake up and find that you do
and it will be too late."
