# Prof wins muscle research award

James Spudich, professor of biochemistry and de
velopmental biology, will receive an award tonight
from the Biophysical Society for his research in mus
cle contraction and cell movement.
The Biophysical Society Award for Excellence and
Leadership in the Biophysical Sciences is a presti
gious award given to a single person each year with a
prize of $5,000. Previous recipients have gone on to
become Nobel Prize winners, including Keith Porter
in 1979 and Gerald Edelman in 1982.
"It's always nice to have one's work recognized by
one's peers, but what really is important is the ex
citement of the work," Spudich said.
Spudich studies the protein molecular motor

myosin, which is essential to changes in cell shape
and cell movements, including muscle contraction
and cell division. The protein is found in almost all
body cells.
"By coupling biophysical and molecular biological
techniques, we have been able to create mutations of
myosin and study its ability to produce force and
movement," Spudich said.
Although there have been models of muscles de
veloped over the last 30 years, Spudich is the first to
create mutant myosin to effectively study single
myosin molecules.
"We're using so many different approaches to un
derstand how this molecular motor works," Spudich
said.
By developing methods to cre
ate mutant forms of myosin, Spu
dich was able to watch a single
myosin molecule produce a small
step-in motion with actin.
Spudich's discovery has many
important ramifications, as it
allows scientists to understand
what goes wrong with the molecu
lar motor system in human dis
eases.

"If you want to understand
what is wrong with particular dis
eases you need to understand the
fundamentals of how things work
first," Spudich said.
A prime example is "human
familial hypertrophic cardiomy
opathies" disease, which is caused
by mutations in the heart's
myosin and causes sudden death
in young people. Spudich's
research allows scientists to study
how mutations stop the heart
from functioning.
Aside from the medical bene
fits, Spudich hopes his work will

inspire young people.
"I am fortunate enough to be at
Stanford, which attracts some of
the very best young people in the
world," Spudich said. "This award
is an attribute to their outstand
ing capabilities and thirst for
knowledge and education."
Spudich plans to continue edu
cating and training young people
through his class in biochemistry.
"As various technologies con
verge, the pieces of the myosin
puzzle are coming together," Spu
dich said. "For us, that is a dream
come true."
