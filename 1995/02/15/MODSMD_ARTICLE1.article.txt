## Harassment policy raising awareness 
### Samuel Park Contributing writer 
A little more than a year after
their creation, the University's sex
ual harassment panel and policy
have already resulted in an increase
in awareness about the issue, ac
cording to Sexual Harassment Poli-

cy Coordinating
Adviser Laraine
Zappert.
Asoftheendof
January, the
panel has heard
52 concerns, Zap
pert said. Some of
them have result
ed in official
grievances.
Zappert, a clin-

ical associate professor of psychia
try, leads the panel of faculty and
staff members which was created
early last year to draw up and im
plement the University's sexual ha
rassment policy.
The policy, which was adopted in
October 1993, prohibits any form of
sexual harassment and includes
guidelines for procedural actions
and implementation processes.

"I think the panel has been ex
cellent in heightening understand
ing and awareness of sexual harass
ment issues," said David Gordon, a
member of the panel and associate
dean of the School of Earth Sci
ences. "It's fairly early on in the
process. The panel has been suc
cessful in implementing the policy
but there is still a lot that needs to
be done."
The panel meets once a month
for ongoing training and for dis
cussing cases as they come up. Be
cause the policy is new, "unforeseen
issues arise" and need to be worked
out as the policy develops, Zappert
said.
"The role of the panel has
evolved and will continue to evolve
as cases come up," said Zappert.
"It's a struggle. How much are we
advisors and how much advocates?
We need to clarify how best to give
advice."
The panel is currently busy de
veloping creative ways to imple
ment the policy. It is formulating a
workshop for graduate students
and briefing faculty in a series of li


Zappert
ability and ethical issues. The brief
ings are expected to end by spring
quarter.
"No one is particularly safe. Sex
ual harassment is about power, but
also about control. It has little to do
with sex," Zappert said, citing cases
of students stalking faculty and
same-sex harassment.
Zappert said she feels that the
panel, which now has 26 members,
has "accomplished a lot."
"I think people have a better
sense now of where to go to ask
questions," she said. "They have a
clearer sense of what to do in terms
of who to consult and get informa
tion" from.
"My gut feeling is that there are
more concerns coming forward,"
added Zappert, who cited the lack
of reliability of statistics in measur
ing the change in numbers of com
plaints.
A brochure distributed to all
members of the Stanford commu
nity last quarter describes the poli
cy, procedures and resources

against sexual harassment and
contains a list of panelists and
advisers who can be contacted for
inquiries or complaints.
"The good news is that [the
brochure] has gotten out," said
Zappert. "The only people who
don't have them yet are new stu
dents who came in the middle of
the year."
The panel has tackled several
other issues as well. "How do you
investigate sexual harassment?
What procedures need to be in
place? Some procedures work very
well and some of them don't. These
are issues that we struggle with,"
said Zappert.
Aside from the brochure, the
information about the polity can be
obtained through Portfolio, the
World Wide Web, and even over e
mail through an account that
answers any questions regarding
the issue. Information is also avail
able through a poster containing
the names and phone numbers of
all the advisers and panelists.
"One really important issue that
the panel is discussing right now is
what happens when a complaint is
investigated and found to have
some merit. Right now, as main
tained by the University and the

law, there can be no disclosure of
remedies," Zappert said. The result
is that "people don't know the out
come, and don't know the remedy."
It conflicts with the "need of the
community to feel something has
been done."
The panel has been successful in
informally solving concerns that
could have resulted in litigation,
Zappert said. Informal resolution
procedures include moderated dis
cussion, mediation and investiga
tion followed by supervisory action.
"I myself am actively involved in
five alleged cases of sexual harass
ment," said Zappert. "The panel
helped by creating a sense of a cen
tral office to bring forward com
plaints. It's easier to talk to some
one who is trained, accessible and
easily identifiable than someone
random."
Zappert has also drafted an
annual report for University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper, including
statistics, ideas and recommenda
tions. She said she would submit
the report in the near future.
"Being quiet about sexual
harassment doesn't stop it," Zap
pert said. "It doesn't just go away.
Recognize it when it happens. It's a
violation of the law."
