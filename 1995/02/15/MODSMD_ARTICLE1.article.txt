## Harassment policy raising awareness 
### Samuel Park Contributing writer 
A little more than a year after
their creation, the University's sex
ual harassment panel and policy
have already resulted in an increase
in awareness about the issue, ac
cording to Sexual Harassment Poli-

cy Coordinating
Adviser Laraine
Zappert.
Asoftheendof

as cases come up," said Zappert.
"It's a struggle. How much are we
advisors and how much advocates?
We need to clarify how best to give
advice."
The panel is currently busy de

workshop for graduate students
and briefing faculty in a series of li
