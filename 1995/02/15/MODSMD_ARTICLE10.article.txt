LA. police admit bungling
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The first
police officer on the scene of the murders
in the O.J. Simpson case acknowledged
yesterday that he didn't examine a melt
ing cup of ice cream or check the temper
ature of Nicole Brown Simpson's bath
water â€” evidence the defense suggested
could have helped fix the time of the slay
ings.
But Officer Robert Riske repeatedly
told jurors it wasn't his job to gather evi
dence. He said he was there to look for vic
tims and "secure the scene" while a police
photographer and other experts did their
job.
Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr.
undertook an item-by-item dissection of
the evidence in a campaign to cast doubt

on police work in the case and suggest
that investigators overlooked or mishan
dled evidence.
Cochran and prosecutor Marcia Clark
questioned Riske closely about what he
reported was a cardboard cup of Ben &
Jerry's ice cream that he found melting
on a banister in Ms. Simpson's condo
minium about 12:30 or 12:40 a.m. on
June 13.
That is more than two hours after the
prosecution alleges the slayings of Ms.
Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman
took place outside her door. Simpson had
left home for the airport around 11 p.m.
on June 12 for a trip to Chicago.
The defense is expected to argue that
the melting rate of the ice cream suggests
the crime took place later in the evening
than alleged.
