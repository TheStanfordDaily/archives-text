# Judge rejects Microsoft settlement

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A federal
judge rejected the Justice Department's
proposed antitrust settlement with
Microsoft Corp., saying it fails to break
the software giant's monopoly or correct
its "anti-competitive practices."
In a 45-page ruling issued late yester
day, U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin
said he was unable to fmd — as required
by law — that the proposed settlement
was in the public interest.
"Microsoft has a monopoly on the mar
ket for personal computer operating sys
tems," Sporkin declared, noting that com
pany's share of the market is consistently
above 70 percent.
The proposed decree, he said, applies
only to future licensing practices by
Microsoft. The government, he added,
failed to show how that would "remedy
the unfair advantage Microsoft gained
through its anti-competitive practices."

"Simply telling a defendant to go forth
and sin no more does little or nothing to
address the unfair advantage it has
already gained," Sporkin wrote. "The
decree is too little, too late."
Sporkin said he made his ruling
because he felt that the government
declined to supply sufficient information
about the agreement. He also said that
the scope of the settlement is too narrow
and that it has inadequate mechanisms to
insure compliance.
Microsoft spokesman Mich Mathews
said the company needed time to read
Sporkin's opinion before deciding on its
next step.
"We are disappointed," Mathews said.
Justice spokeswoman Gina Talamona
said antitrust division attorneys were
reviewing the ruling.
Sporkin's rejection of the proposed set
tlement leaves the government with sev

eral options: It could appeal his ruling; it
could go to trial on its allegations against
Microsoft, or it could try to negotiate a
new agreement with the company that
would satisfy Sporkin.
Sporkin's refusal to approve the decree
was highly unusual. But he has grumbled
publicly for several months about the nar
rowness of the government's case.
The proposed settlement, which was
reached last July 15, would have forced
Microsoft to change the way it sells or
licenses operating software to personal
computer makers.
The settlement focused on prohibiting
Microsoft from engaging in certain licens
ing procedures that the government
argued gave the company an unfair
advantage in selling its computer operat
ing systems and other software to compa
nies that make computer terminals and
other hardware.
