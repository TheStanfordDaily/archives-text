## Editorial Tuition keeps rising 
### 
Board should hold open
meetings to let students
hear discussion of hikes

Concerned, perhaps,
with the low rates of death and
taxation among college stu
dents, the University has created
another inevitable event in our lives
— tuition increases.
Last week the Board of Trustees
continued the annual ritual,
announcing yet another higher
than-inflation raise in tuition for the
upcoming academic year. Tuition for
next year will be just under $19,700,
a 5.2 percent increase over last year's
level. This increase in costs is
approximately 2 percent higher than
the rate of inflation.
To soothe the students and par
ents who are upset about the
increase, the Board continued anoth
er tradition — that of issuing gentle
assurances they mean well. Take the
words of Board Chair John Freiden
rich: "We are concerned about the
escalation in total costs" and "we
recognize and understand that for
middle-class families these things
are difficult.... It certainly is of
great importance for us."
Enough is enough.
The tuition hikes that have
become a regular event must change,
and change now. The steady rise in
costs puts poorer students ever-fur
ther in debt, prices middle-class fam
ilies out of a Stanford education and
hurts even the wealthiest of students
through higher costs and a potential
ly less-diverse pool of classmates.
Yet every year for at least 20 years,
Stanford has raised its tuition —
many of these years over the level of
inflation. Every tuition increase in
the '90s has been at a rate higher
than inflation.
True, this reflects a national
trend; private college tuition has
more than tripled since 1980 while
overall consumer costs have not even
doubled. Yet Stanford must take the
responsibility upon itself, as a leader

in education, to buck this trend
before a college degree becomes the
privilege of the rich.
As disturbing as the steady rise in
costs, however, is the willingness of
the Board of Trustees to say one
thing while doing another — to
express their concern for constant
tuition hikes while doing seemingly
little to stop them.
It's time for students to cease qui
etly accepting tuition increases that
are slightly above inflation because
"it could have been worse." We
should no longer be satisfied by the
mere statement that the University
is concerned about costs and middle
class families, particularly when that
statement is not supported by any
tangible evidence. Indeed, simply
looking at the pattern of tuition
increases, one could be led to believe
no such concern exists whatsoever.
The trustees will no doubt protest
that they do really care, and that
they bring up their concerns in their
discussions on tuition increases. But
since these discussions are closed to
the public, as are all Board meetings,
we students can never know if the
professed concern is real or not. All
we hear is the final result: "Here's
your bill, sorry it's so high, we'll try
to change" — yet no change comes.
It's time for the Board to be fully
open with the students on the tuition
issue. If the trustees are not really
worried about the big tuition hikes,
they should just say so. If they are
worried, they should both open up
their meetings so students can know
the concern is real and cease raising
costs over inflation.
Stanford students will under
stand that federal funding is likely to
drop, that the California economy
had a deep recession and that other
factors are leading to higher costs.
They know that sometimes big hikes
will be needed. All we ask is that the
trustees try hard, and are straight
forward and open in the tuition deci
sion process.
Students deserve to know the
truth, and the whole truth. It is time
for them to quit accepting anything
less.
