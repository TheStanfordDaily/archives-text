## Try to be like a ball of lard 
### 
THIS CAMPUS is dead, baby, and
it's dragging you down with it.
Yeah, I'm talking to you. You know
exactly who you are. So drop the books,
get off the bike and let Uncle Sean give
you a few words of well-needed advice.
Take a good look around you. Survey
the scene. Chances are you're surround
ed by many other people just like your
self. If not, just imagine that you are.
Your clothes are all rather clean. You
may have gotten a haircut recently.
Maybe you forgot to put on your under
arm deodorant this morning. Stinky
monkey! In any case, things are pretty
much quiet and sedate, aren't they?
Just like a calm lake in the early morn
ing.
Well, let me tell you what I want. I
want to be a big, round mass of congealed
lard, and I want to fall into that lake from
a great height, causing ripples of large
proportions. I want to see the fish
screaming in aquatic fright as they see
my jiggling form splatter upon the flat
surface of water, globules of fat squirting
about in random directions. I want to
fuck things up.
What does this have to do with you?
Well, I want you to be a ball of lard, as
well. I want you to take action. This is a
call to arms, my brethren. Things have
been static for much too long and it is
time for us to wake up. And we shall
wake with force, my friends. We shall
wake up and the day will be ours! That is,
of course, if you're willing.

Many quarters ago, I realized some
thing. This school is designed to suck
away your mind. You may think that you
are gaining valuable knowledge in your
day-to-day studies, but I tell you that you
are wrong. While you study diligently
toward attaining your diploma, you
steadily lose track of time. You wake up,
shower, go to class, eat, study, study
some more, then sleep. It's a degenerat
ing process, and when you come out of it
after four years, you're gonna wonder
why you never had fun.
"Fun?" you say. "Oh, I've had plenty
of fun! I went to Flicks last week and
threw a paper airplane! I ate at Chef
Chaen's Saturday night! I went to the KA
party!"
That is not fun. That is boring. It is
"University-condoned" fun. Would you
like to know what real fun is? Real fun is
doing stuff that the campus police don't
want you to do. Some would call this van
dalism. I like to call it mischief.
It is not knowledge that is valuable. It
is damage. And I want you to help me
inflict it. The administration thinks that
they can charge us a 5.5 percent increase
in tuition? Let's justify that increase. 5.5
percent of $25,000 is $1,375. So, through
my twisted form of deduction that I refer
to as logic, I think each student should be
entitled to inflict $1,375 worth of damage
on this campus. Of course, I don't mean
the hateful and ignorant vandalism, of
which this campus has already seen
enough. The kind of damage I'm talking

about is a "clever" kind. Intelligent
pranks, if you will.
Wouldn't one of those bronze, Rodin
sculptures look peachy in your dorm
room? You could put it next to your Spin
Doctors poster. And how many times
have you just wanted to smash that dol
lar-changing machine to get quarters for
your laundry? Have at it! You have my
permission. Hey, are you upset about the
Republican takeover of Congress? Take a
gaze at Hoover Tower, that conservative
stronghold in the sky. All you'd need is
some plutonium, a small detonator and
blammo! — instant political revenge!
Don't just limit yourself to campus,
either. That large, plastic Colonel
Sanders in the window of KFC on El
Camino is ripe for the plucking!
Imagine what a cool place this would
be if people acted a little more subversive.
You know, I've got less than two years
left before I part ways with this campus,
and before I go I'd love to see some fat fly
and some buildings burn. So be that ball
of lard in the sky. Make some ripples. If
destruction ain't your thing, there are
plenty of other ways to monkey-wrench
this place. I'd like you to do your part in
helping make this campus a cooler place
for you and for me.
