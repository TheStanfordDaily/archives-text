Medical Center begins to address women's health needs

lAM WRITING in response to Steve
Wallace's Feb. 10 letter about the
Medical School curriculum, and also
to clarify what the Medical School is
doing to provide better education in
women's health issues to its students.
The failure of the current health sys
tem to meet the unique needs of women
is rarely debated. Current practitioners
lack sufficient risk, prevention and treat
ment data regarding women, and in
addition, women's care has been largely
compartmentalized into different spe
cialties, unnecessarily fragmenting the
field.
The Stanford Medical Center as a
whole has taken tremendous strides to
address the gender-exclusiveness of clini
cal research. The Medical Center now
houses several large scale epidemiologic
studies about women, including the
Women's Health Initiative, and individu
al researchers have also begun to con
tribute to the paucity of knowledge in
the field. In the past, scientists common
ly assumed that women's health was

synonymous with women's reproductive
health. We know now that the study of
pregnancy, breasts and uteruses,
although very important, does not con
stitute the whole of women's health.
New research at the Medical Center
looks at prevention and risk factors for
heart disease, cancer, and musculoskele
tal disorders, and studies the effects of
diet and exercise. These new attitudes in
research go hand in hand with new ideas
about women's health. Women's health
is the care of an entire person, with psy
chosocial as well as physiological focus,
and with the realization that the major
body systems are not androgynous.
Our goal at the Medical School is to
see this new information about women,
and pre-existing information, is better
transmitted to the students. We are
approaching this problems in two ways.
First, we are encouraging the faculty
to increase the gender inclusiveness of
the material covered in both pre-clinical
and clinical medicine. Although it is true
that most faculty do not teach that "a

woman is a female man," they often fail
to realize the educational implications of
presenting data without indicating
whether it is gender-inclusive.
This failure to recognize and acknowl
edge potential differences in risk factors,
and signs and symptoms of heart disease
among men and women prompted
Bernadine Healy, then director of the
National Institutes of Health, to write a
poignant letter to the New England
Journal of Medicine. She entitled the let
ter "the Yentl syndrome," because she
makes reference to Sanger's female
character who had to dress as a man to
receive privileges. Only recently are we
realizing in medicine that we cannot
assume women and men look the same
in the context of illness.
The second way that we are address
ing women's health is by education
through the creation of a clerkship that
addresses important, yet often neglected
areas. These areas include domestic vio
lence and sexual assault, autoimmune
disorders, adolescent health and breast

health.
This curriculum stresses the impor
tance of the interdisciplinary nature of
women's health care, and tries to reduce
compartmentalization of the body sys
tems. The clerkship not only includes
information about women, but stresses
sensitivity to the gender, race, age and
class inclusiveness of clinical research.
This clinical curriculum required
intensive labor from both students and
faculty, and has taken more than a year
to construct. The most difficult part of
any new curriculum, however, is finding
funding to implement it. We estimate
that costs for a clerkship director, an
administrator, staff assistants, supplies
and teaching tools will be $50,000 to
$100,000 per year.
It is frustration with this cost barrier
that prompted me to ask why no funding
barrier exists to teaching men's health
at the Medical School. Here is yet anoth
er inequity that needs to be addressed.
