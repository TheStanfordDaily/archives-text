# Eucalyptus editorial used "provincial" logic, was similar to Prop. 187
##

Does the writer of Monday's edito
rial entitled "Plant native species"
understand his proposal? He wishes to
abolish the eucalyptus trees on cam
pus and replace them with native
oaks. Not a bad idea, but why stop
there? Why not "restore the Stanford
campus" to a prior time â€” after all,
that is what the Editorial Board pro-
Sises. Perhaps it is the time of the
exican rancheros ... or perhaps a
prior time when only the Ohlone Indi

ans, among Homo sapiens, were native
in these places. The statements of the
editorial attributed to the eucalyptus
tree would equally describe more
recent incursions of persons into the
natural state of the "Stanford Farm."
It is a limited and provincial logic
that looks backward to a past time. A
similar logic would abolish potatoes,
tomatoes, and maize (corn) for North
America and would be consistent with
support of Proposition 187. The euca
lyptus is a hardy tree with over 100
separate species. The presence of
eucalyptus throughout the world
brings comfort and familiarity to
world travelers. It reminds us that we,
plants and humans, are all part of a
single, diverse, intermingling, and

interrelated world. Shame on this edi
torial!
