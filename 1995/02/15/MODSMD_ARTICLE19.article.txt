# Inner Quad benefits from non-native trees
## 
### 
The Daily's Feb. 13 editorial on euca
lyptus trees reminded me of an English
friend who advocated chopping down
exotic trees in England so that the land
scape could be returned to its appear
ance in the days of Shakespeare. To my
surprise this xenophobia extended to the
Canadian maple trees, whose brilliant
autumn color distracted from the true

England.
Stanford's Inner Quad benefits
from non-native species. The tallest
specimen is an Australian Casuarina,
the most handsome flowering tree is
an Australian flame tree (sometimes
available at the Bookstore as a post
card), while the only California tree is
a skinny Washingtonia palm, which is
not native to the Stanford area at all
but comes from southern California
and Mexico. There were once numer
ous Monterey cypresses around the
Quad, but none remains. Planting
other locally native species there
would be a mistake.
