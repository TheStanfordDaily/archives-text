# Construction to begin in Language Corner
## 
### Pamela Phan Contributing writer 
Fences go up tomorrow at the
southeast corner of the Quad to
allow for the development of a
new road directly across from the
Clock Tower.
Facilities is blocking off the
heavily-traveled area at the inter
section of Escondido Mall and La
suen Mall to accommodate earth
quake construction which is
scheduled to begin tomorrow, ac
cording to Maggie Burgett, a pro
ject manager of the Construction
Management Division.
The area will be marked off
with signs and traffic will be di
rected away from the east side of
Escondido Mall. Heavy equip
ment will be moved into the
fenced-off section until construc
tion is ended in approximately
three days, Burgett added.
Workers are widening a por
tion of the mall by adding approx
imately 10 feet to the south side.
Asphalt will replace the grass area
currently located at the corner.
Work is in progress to lay down a

new roadbed to carry traffic
around areas of the Language
Corner which are being blocked
off for reconstruction.
The new road is designed to
make the area more accessible
and the commute less congested,
according to Mike Kuntz, a con
struction supervisor for Facilities.
Plans for seismic retrofitting of
the area include interior construc
tion of Building 260 in the Quad
and replacement of columns along
the arcade.
Construction on the Language
Corner will be completed in the
spring of 1996 â€” seven years after
the structure first suffered dam
age from the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake, Burgett said.
While the work proceeds, the
new road will provide an alterna
tive route for pedestrian and bicy
cle traffic. As soon as construction
is finished, the road will be taken
out again.
"All other traffic in the area
will be maintained," Burgett said.
Massive machinery will be
moving into the construction site,
Burgett added.
