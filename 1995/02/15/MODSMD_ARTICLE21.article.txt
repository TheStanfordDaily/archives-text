## Orbital fat is implicated in dark bags under eyes 
### Cris Neill Staff writer 
Why do you get dark bags under
ICY your eyes when you 're tired ?
— Late night crammer
A:These circles and bags under the
eyes are the telltale signs of Stan
ford's dark side: we act as if Stanford
is all fun and games, and then stay up
'til 5 a.m. cramming to memorize the
stages of gastrulation and teaching
Karel the incompetent robot how to
do the hokey-pokey.
However, imagine you're a pre
med, and your career choice gives you
no alternative but to engage in such
acts of lucubration. Your eyes will
definitely pay the price. For one
thing, your eyes will get tired and

sore.
This soreness is a result of
the fact that, although you
don't usually think about it,
your eyes have muscles. A
bunch of them, in fact. You
have extraocular muscles
around the outside of the
eye, which turn your eyes
towards whatever you hope
to look at. The sphincter and
dilatory muscles open and
close the pupils, to let more
or less light in. The ciliary
muscles are attached to the
lens of the eye; they work to
change the shape of the lens,

allowing you to focus on different
points.
And just like any other muscles in
your body, if you give them a work
out, they'll get sore and tired. And
because your eyes are designed to
focus on 01-jects at a distance, rather
than most objects of academic inquiry
which are just inches away, your eye
muscle.' need to work even harder
when studying. So by the time you've
plowed through Nietzsche, you've
realized that it may not kill you, it
won't really make you stronger, but it
will definitely make your eyes hurt.
This problem is exacerbated when
your eyes are dry, because it takes
more effort to move them than when
they are moist. After a long day, your
eyes are probably not putting out as
much lubrication as when you were
fresh in the morning. Also, staring at
the pages of a book or the eerie glow
of Word 5.0 causes you to blink less
often, so your eyes get even drier.
The dark circles under the eyes are
a result of the fact that the area

around the eyes is very sensitive to
trauma. Any stress — such as crying,
foreign objects in the eye or lack of
sleep — can cause swelling in this
region. Originally, this was probably
a defense mechanism, to protect the
eye from external damage. Now it's
just a giveaway that you had a late
night in the computer cluster.
There is also what is known as
"venous pooling" of blood below the
eyes. Basically, this means that the
blood doesn't have anywhere else to
go, so it accumulates underneath the
eye. The skin here is fairly transpar
ent, so you see the blood below the
skin as dark circles.
Although this is commonly seen
around Stanford as a result of stress
or lack of sleep, it is clinically a symp
tom of asthma and sinus problems,

which prevent the free flow
of blood. It is still not really
known why lack of sleep
causes the blood to pool; it
may have something to do
with the lack of lubrication
in the eye when you're tired,
or the irritation associated
with demanding ocular activ
ity.
Some people are actu
ally prone to have darkness
around the eyes even with
out undue trauma or stress,
simply due to the vascular
structure around their eyes.
In particular, Indian women

are known to often have dark circles
under their eyes as a result of venous
pooling. Other people may have inherit
ed a tendency to have circles under their
eyes (regardless of how much their eyes
are overworked or how indifferent they
are towards their sleep hygiene) from
their parents. This inherited tendency
may be expressed through increased
venous pooling, as in Indian women, or
may simply be a result of eye shape and
position which cause excess shading.
The reason elderly people often
have bags under their eyes is actually
quite different. The orbit (socket) of
your eye is packed in a thick layer of
fat, which acts as cushioning. All this
fat is held in place by a thin mem
brane right behind the skin. However,
as you get older, this membrane
weakens and the fat starts leaking
through, giving you saggy eyes.
Well, I hope this convinces you to
cut short some of those late-night ses
sions, or at least spend them doing
something that exercises body parts
other than the ciliary muscles.
