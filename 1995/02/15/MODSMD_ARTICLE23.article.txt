# New technique for tracking the progression of the HIV virus
## An inexpensive and rapid count of T-lymphocytes reduces the mystery for individuals struggling with AIDS 
### Prithika Balakrishnan 
Stanford scientists have helped
develop a new method which may pro
vide HIV-positive individuals with a
better knowledge of the progression of
the AIDS virus.
The process evaluates the strength
of an AIDS patient's T4 lymphocytes.
T4 lymphocytes, also known as CD4,
are the body's most important white
blood cells, and virtually control the
entire immune system. As the AIDS
virus progresses, the number of these
cells diminishes.
This newly developed technique
may give HIV-positive individuals a
more accurate estimate of their T4 cell
count, and subsequently, the course of
the virus. Former methods could cal
culate the number of T4 cells, but
could not differentiate them from

other lymphocytes in measuring actu
al potency.
Dr. Mark Holodniy, acting assistant
professor of medicine at Stanford's
School of Medicine, worked with col
laborators at Becton Dickinson
Immunocytometry Systems and pre
sented his research group's findings at
the Jan. 31 National Conference on
Human Retroviruses and Related
Infections in Washington D.C.
Holodniy's colleagues at Becton
Dickinson, a biotechnology firm in San
Jose — who include Vernon Maino,
Joyce Ruitenberg and Maria Suni —
developed the technique. They then
worked with Holodniy, director of the
AIDS Research Center at the Stan
ford-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medi
cal Center in Palo Alto, to test the
method's usefulness in dealing with
AIDS patients.

This method of tallying T4 lympho
cytes can extend to many immunologi
cal diseases. Holodniy said he feels
that measuring the strength of various
types of lymphocytes "would revolu
tionize how immunology is done."
The AIDS virus infects and slowly
kills the body's T4 lymphocytes, essen
tial to the immune system. The num
ber of opportunistic infections increas
es as the T4 cells decrease below a crit
ical amount. However, HIV-patients
with identical T4 levels can have vast
ly different outward clinical courses.
"Even if you have the same classifi
cation of AIDS clinically, you can have
markedly different functional T4
capacity," Holodniy said. The new
development in testing T4 potentiality
may help to measure a patient's
remaining immune function, and thus
predict the future course of the dis

ease.
In transferring the research of the
Becton Dickinson scientists to AIDS
patients, the research team used blood
samples from thirty HIV-positive
patients. After mixing each sample
with bacterial toxin, a powerful
immune stimulator, the surfaces of
the test tubes became studded with
"early activation markers," the result
of the T4 lymphocyte's immune
response.
The researchers added a fluorescent
chemical tag to the test tubes to mea
sure the amounts of protein created by
the T4 lymphocyte. A flow cytometer
counted the number of tags in each
tube.
In general, the researchers found
that T4 cells from HIV patients with
severe opportunistic infection pro
duced less of the early activation

marker than HIV patients that were
asymptomatic. However, the scientists
discovered great variation in the
amounts of activation marker among
AIDS patients with severe opportunis
tic diseases.
The new testing method represents
multiple improvements over the older
technique in evaluating T4 cell
strength. Current tests, which cannot
determine T4 cell potential indepen
dently of other lymphocytes, involve
radioactivity and take several days to
complete. The new methods make use
of fluorescent tags, instead of radioac
tive agents, and can be completed in
five hours.
The Becton Dickinson firm will
soon be marketing these findings to
researchers. The FDA, however, has
yet to approve the new tests for clini
cal use.
