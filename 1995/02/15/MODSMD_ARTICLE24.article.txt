## Basketball hopes ailments don't hurt against Cal Injured squad needs rest 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
What's black and blue and car
dinal all over? These days, it's the
17th-ranked Stanford men's bas
ketball team. Cardinal and white?
Forget it. This year's team has
been wearing black and blue, sort
of like senior guard David Har
bour's badly sprained left ankle.
Harbour, who turned his ankle in
last Saturday's contest against
Arizona State, would rather refer
to it as "discolored." This color,
that color, whatever color, the
point is Stanford's locker room
has been replaced by a set for
"M*A*S*H" or "ER."
Harbour, questionable for
tonight's California game, is just
the latest addition to an ever
expanding list of casualties.
"I haven't had anything close
as far as basketball teams," said
trainer Tim Eakins who has been
around college athletes for nine
years, two with Stanford. "Noth
ing like this for basketball. Maybe
football."
To avoid a season like the foot
ball team's, at the start of the
campaign head coach Mike Mont
gomery stated that a major key to
success would be to minimize
player injuries. The Cardinal had
never been a traditionally deep
team, and this year is no differ
ent. Therefore, the issue of main
taining the health of the players
was a major concern.
So what happens? The Cardi
nal squad becomes the poster
boys for Blue Cross.
"We're really, really banged up

now," said junior forward Darren
Allaway. "We're hoping that after
the Cal game, we'll get some time
to rest and heal."
In the opening weeks of the
regular season, junior guard Dion
Cross dislocated his left shoulder
while getting ready for bed. It
sounds a little bizarre, but this is
the same shoulder that Cross has
dislocated or sublexed three pre
vious times. Some people have
chronic arthritis; he has chronic
dislocations.
Cross rebounded in fine fash
ion leading Stanford in scoring
(18.5 points per game) and pacing
the Pacific 10 Conference in
three-point and free-throw shoot
ing percentage, 52.3 percent and
86.0 percent respectively. Howev
er, in a matchup against Oregon
State two weeks ago, the Stanford
sharpshooter collided with sever
al Beaver defenders while making
a move towards the basket and
sublexed his shoulder once again.
He struggled in that game as
well as the following contest at
Arizona, but Cross attributes the
performances more to the opposi
tion than to his injuries. Still, one
can't help but wonder sometimes
if the battered Cardinal will even
make it through a game.
Besides the shoulder, Cross is
also nursing a sprain of the ante
rior cruciate ligament in his left
knee, an injury he suffered just a
few days into practice this season,
as well as tendinitis in both
knees. The tendinitis is quite
prevalent today in the basketball

Cardinal playing despite injuries.
