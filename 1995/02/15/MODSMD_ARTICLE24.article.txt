## Basketball hopes ailments don't hurt against Cal Injured squad needs rest 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
What's black and blue and car
dinal all over? These days, it's the
17th-ranked Stanford men's bas
ketball team. Cardinal and white?
Forget it. This year's team has
been wearing black and blue, sort
of like senior guard David Har
bour's badly sprained left ankle.
Harbour, who turned his ankle in
last Saturday's contest against
Arizona State, would rather refer
to it as "discolored." This color,
that color, whatever color, the
point is Stanford's locker room
has been replaced by a set for
"M*A*S*H" or "ER."
Harbour, questionable for
tonight's California game, is just
the latest addition to an ever
expanding list of casualties.
"I haven't had anything close
as far as basketball teams," said
trainer Tim Eakins who has been
around college athletes for nine
years, two with Stanford. "Noth
ing like this for basketball. Maybe
football."
To avoid a season like the foot
ball team's, at the start of the
campaign head coach Mike Mont
gomery stated that a major key to
success would be to minimize
player injuries. The Cardinal had
never been a traditionally deep
team, and this year is no differ
ent. Therefore, the issue of main
taining the health of the players
was a major concern.
So what happens? The Cardi
nal squad becomes the poster
boys for Blue Cross.
"We're really, really banged up

now," said junior forward Darren
Allaway. "We're hoping that after
the Cal game, we'll get some time
to rest and heal."
In the opening weeks of the
regular season, junior guard Dion
Cross dislocated his left shoulder
while getting ready for bed. It
sounds a little bizarre, but this is
the same shoulder that Cross has
dislocated or sublexed three pre
vious times. Some people have
chronic arthritis; he has chronic
dislocations.
Cross rebounded in fine fash
ion leading Stanford in scoring
(18.5 points per game) and pacing
the Pacific 10 Conference in
three-point and free-throw shoot
ing percentage, 52.3 percent and
86.0 percent respectively. Howev
er, in a matchup against Oregon
State two weeks ago, the Stanford
sharpshooter collided with sever
al Beaver defenders while making
a move towards the basket and
sublexed his shoulder once again.
He struggled in that game as
well as the following contest at
Arizona, but Cross attributes the
performances more to the opposi
tion than to his injuries. Still, one
can't help but wonder sometimes
if the battered Cardinal will even
make it through a game.
Besides the shoulder, Cross is
also nursing a sprain of the ante
rior cruciate ligament in his left
knee, an injury he suffered just a
few days into practice this season,
as well as tendinitis in both
knees. The tendinitis is quite
prevalent today in the basketball

world with NBA stars like
Patrick Ewing suffering the same
problems; it is sometimes unaf
fectionately known as "jumper's
knees."
"The worst one is probably
Dion," Eakins said. "He's got
shoulders and knees. He's had the
shoulder and tendinitis in his
knee since high school. With his
knees, I don't know how he
stands on his legs sometimes."
Cross may be the worst off, but
his medley of injuries is just the
tip of the iceberg for the Cardinal.
His backcourt mate, point guard
Brevin Knight, is known as the
"Iceman" now, and it doesn't
have anything to do with his
ultra-cool nerves during crunch
time.
Knight draws the Mr. Cool tag
because after games and prac
tices, Eakins literally packs the
sophomore in ice. Knight bruised
his left clavicle from a hard bump
to the collarbone he took in last
week's Arizona game. He also has
a sprained left ankle. And of
course, there's also the much
publicized stress reaction in his
right tibia, which has him don
ning an air cast and making trips
to the San Francisco 49ers' facili
ties to get some time in an oxygen
chamber.
Other professional teams like
the Dallas Cowboys and the Van
couver Canucks use similar
chambers to accelerate healing by
maximizing the oxygen flow to
the athlete. His other tibia,
though not suffering from a
stress reaction, isn't feeling so hot
either and is also being iced regu
larly. And to add to his bad luck,
Knight also caught a cold this
week, maybe from all that ice.
Moving to the frontline, for
ward Darren Allaway is the
largest hotbed of hurt. His
cracked vertebrae has flared up
often this season and has caused a
great deal of pain. The condition
was most evident during the
UCLA and USC games this sea
son when Allaway assumed the
Larry Bird/Charles Barkley posi
tion, laying on his stomach while
on the sidelines. The back, along
with his own jumper's knees lim
ited him at times to what Mont
gomery calls the "Brevin Knight

Program."
"So far, he's been able to avoid
a lot of discomfort where we'd
have to do some pretty radical
things like injections," Eakins
said. "We've been able to control
it with his physical therapy."
The program basically consists
of refraining from a lot of high
impact work and conditioning and
translates into a lot of time on the
bike during practice.
"This is a chronic thing," Ail
away said. "It's a flare-up type of
thing that needs time off from
time to time. A nerve's flaring up
back there. It just needs rest. It
won't go away. It won't get con
siderably worse or better."
Senior forward Andy Poppink
is battling back from a shoulder
separation he suffered in a colli
sion with sophomore forward
Rich Jackson during practice.
That, along with a sprained left
ankle, hasn't made life easy for
Poppink.
Center Bart Lammersen
brought home a souvenir during
the trip to Virginia over winter
break. It's called a patello-femoral
inflammation in his right knee. In
other words, it's not fun, and
that's why the big guy has that
sleeve over his right knee.
Doing some simple arithmetic,
that means six out of the top
seven players in the rotation are
nursing some sort of ailment,
most not too fun. Starting center
Tim Young is the only one that's
healthy, a fresh freshman body
perhaps.
"This is definitely the worst
I've seen it," said Lammersen, the
seasoned senior team captain.
"It's not affecting the team too
much. Granted it's harder to do
some things in practice, but I
think when we get out there for
games, we put the injuries behind
us."
Like Lammersen said, prac
tices are tougher to run smoothly,
and sometimes, poor practices
make for poor performances.
Practices are probably where the
injuries hurt the Cardinal the
most.
First, there's the diminished
conditioning for some of the play
ers like Knight.
"Conditioning is not as effec
tive [on a bike)," Eakins said.
"But there's not much else we can
do."
Then there are the mechanical
problems of being in-sync and

smooth with players sitting out.
But perhaps one of the bigger and
largely overlooked aspects is the
effect on the team's psyche.
"Last week, especially in prac
tice, there was a lull in our atti
tude," Harbour said. "Everybody
was kind of down, and nobody
was picking each other up like we
needed to.
"Coach made a point that we
need to pick each other up. Get
back that enthusiasm that we had
before guys started getting
injured. It's more difficult to gen
erate that enthusiasm especially
when your bodies are hurting.
We've been through it now for
awhile, now we're at the time
where we have to get over our
hurt, get through it, and get on
with the task at hand which is
winning ball games."
Winning the ball games has
been difficult the last two games,
and Montgomery thinks a large
part of that is due to the injuries.
"I think we may have allowed
ourselves to buy into the fact that
we're hurting," Montgomery said.
"Maybe we've allowed ourselves
to say,.'l can't do that because I'm
hurt.' We can't do that. We have
to do the job. We don't need any
excuses.
"We need to work hard in prac
tices and make practice a priority.
We can't use it as a crutch. We
can't allow ourselves to do any
thing less than it takes to win."
Stanford had better learn to
win hurt. The prescription for
most of the crippled Cardinal is
ice, rehab, ice, physical therapy
and more ice. However, things are
not likely to get any better — with
seven games left in the conference
season, Stanford needs to get over
the hurt because the hurt's not
going to get over them this sea
son.
"These guys won't be at full
strength until around June after
the season's over," Eakins said.
"Coming in, most of them weren't
even at full strength. There's
probably a greater chance of them
getting worse than getting better,
especially at this stage in the sea
son. It's a long season to be going
up and down hardwood. Unless
something odd happens though,
they shouldn't miss any games.
"But they're still playing with
the pain. They're going out and
playing hard and practicing hard.
That's commendable, and I give
them a lot of credit."

the Cal game, we'll get some time
to rest and heal."
In the opening weeks of the
regular season, junior guard Dion
Cross dislocated his left shoulder
while getting ready for bed. It
sounds a little bizarre, but this is
the same shoulder that Cross has
dislocated or sublexed three pre
vious times. Some people have
chronic arthritis; he has chronic
dislocations.
Cross rebounded in fine fash
ion leading Stanford in scoring
(18.5 points per game) and pacing
the Pacific 10 Conference in
three-point and free-throw shoot
ing percentage, 52.3 percent and
86.0 percent respectively. Howev
er, in a matchup against Oregon
State two weeks ago, the Stanford
sharpshooter collided with sever
al Beaver defenders while making
a move towards the basket and
sublexed his shoulder once again.
He struggled in that game as
well as the following contest at
Arizona, but Cross attributes the
performances more to the opposi
tion than to his injuries. Still, one
can't help but wonder sometimes
if the battered Cardinal will even
make it through a game.
Besides the shoulder, Cross is
also nursing a sprain of the ante
rior cruciate ligament in his left
knee, an injury he suffered just a
few days into practice this season,
as well as tendinitis in both
knees. The tendinitis is quite
prevalent today in the basketball

Cardinal playing despite injuries.
world with NBA stars like
Patrick Ewing suffering the same
problems; it is sometimes unaf
fectionately known as "jumper's
knees."
"The worst one is probably
Dion," Eakins said. "He's got
shoulders and knees. He's had the
shoulder and tendinitis in his
knee since high school. With his
knees, I don't know how he
stands on his legs sometimes."
Cross may be the worst off, but
his medley of injuries is just the
tip of the iceberg for the Cardinal.
His backcourt mate, point guard
Brevin Knight, is known as the
"Iceman" now, and it doesn't
have anything to do with his
ultra-cool nerves during crunch
time.
Knight draws the Mr. Cool tag
because after games and prac
tices, Eakins literally packs the
sophomore in ice. Knight bruised
his left clavicle from a hard bump
to the collarbone he took in last
week's Arizona game. He also has
a sprained left ankle. And of
course, there's also the much
publicized stress reaction in his
right tibia, which has him don
ning an air cast and making trips
to the San Francisco 49ers' facili
ties to get some time in an oxygen
chamber.
Other professional teams like
the Dallas Cowboys and the Van
couver Canucks use similar
chambers to accelerate healing by
maximizing the oxygen flow to
the athlete. His other tibia,
though not suffering from a
stress reaction, isn't feeling so hot
either and is also being iced regu
larly. And to add to his bad luck,
Knight also caught a cold this
week, maybe from all that ice.
Moving to the frontline, for
ward Darren Allaway is the
largest hotbed of hurt. His
cracked vertebrae has flared up
often this season and has caused a
great deal of pain. The condition
was most evident during the
UCLA and USC games this sea
son when Allaway assumed the
Larry Bird/Charles Barkley posi
tion, laying on his stomach while
on the sidelines. The back, along
with his own jumper's knees lim
ited him at times to what Mont
gomery calls the "Brevin Knight

Program."
"So far, he's been able to avoid
a lot of discomfort where we'd
have to do some pretty radical
things like injections," Eakins
said. "We've been able to control
it with his physical therapy."
The program basically consists
of refraining from a lot of high
impact work and conditioning and
translates into a lot of time on the
bike during practice.
"This is a chronic thing," Ail
away said. "It's a flare-up type of
thing that needs time off from
time to time. A nerve's flaring up
back there. It just needs rest. It
won't go away. It won't get con
siderably worse or better."
Senior forward Andy Poppink
is battling back from a shoulder
separation he suffered in a colli
sion with sophomore forward
Rich Jackson during practice.
That, along with a sprained left
ankle, hasn't made life easy for
Poppink.
Center Bart Lammersen
brought home a souvenir during
the trip to Virginia over winter
break. It's called a patello-femoral
inflammation in his right knee. In
other words, it's not fun, and
that's why the big guy has that
sleeve over his right knee.
Doing some simple arithmetic,
that means six out of the top
seven players in the rotation are
nursing some sort of ailment,
most not too fun. Starting center
Tim Young is the only one that's
healthy, a fresh freshman body
perhaps.
"This is definitely the worst
I've seen it," said Lammersen, the
seasoned senior team captain.
"It's not affecting the team too
much. Granted it's harder to do
some things in practice, but I
think when we get out there for
games, we put the injuries behind
us."
Like Lammersen said, prac
tices are tougher to run smoothly,
and sometimes, poor practices
make for poor performances.
Practices are probably where the
injuries hurt the Cardinal the
most.
First, there's the diminished
conditioning for some of the play
ers like Knight.
"Conditioning is not as effec
tive [on a bike)," Eakins said.
"But there's not much else we can
do."
Then there are the mechanical
problems of being in-sync and

smooth with players sitting out.
But perhaps one of the bigger and
largely overlooked aspects is the
effect on the team's psyche.
"Last week, especially in prac
tice, there was a lull in our atti
tude," Harbour said. "Everybody
was kind of down, and nobody
was picking each other up like we
needed to.
"Coach made a point that we
need to pick each other up. Get
back that enthusiasm that we had
before guys started getting
injured. It's more difficult to gen
erate that enthusiasm especially
when your bodies are hurting.
We've been through it now for
awhile, now we're at the time
where we have to get over our
hurt, get through it, and get on
with the task at hand which is
winning ball games."
Winning the ball games has
been difficult the last two games,
and Montgomery thinks a large
part of that is due to the injuries.
"I think we may have allowed
ourselves to buy into the fact that
we're hurting," Montgomery said.
"Maybe we've allowed ourselves
to say,.'l can't do that because I'm
hurt.' We can't do that. We have
to do the job. We don't need any
excuses.
"We need to work hard in prac
tices and make practice a priority.
We can't use it as a crutch. We
can't allow ourselves to do any
thing less than it takes to win."
Stanford had better learn to
win hurt. The prescription for
most of the crippled Cardinal is
ice, rehab, ice, physical therapy
and more ice. However, things are
not likely to get any better — with
seven games left in the conference
season, Stanford needs to get over
the hurt because the hurt's not
going to get over them this sea
son.
"These guys won't be at full
strength until around June after
the season's over," Eakins said.
"Coming in, most of them weren't
even at full strength. There's
probably a greater chance of them
getting worse than getting better,
especially at this stage in the sea
son. It's a long season to be going
up and down hardwood. Unless
something odd happens though,
they shouldn't miss any games.
"But they're still playing with
the pain. They're going out and
playing hard and practicing hard.
That's commendable, and I give
them a lot of credit."
What's black and blue and car
dinal all over? These days, it's the
17th-ranked Stanford men's bas
ketball team. Cardinal and white?
Forget it. This year's team has
been wearing black and blue, sort
of like senior guard David Har
bour's badly sprained left ankle.
Harbour, who turned his ankle in
last Saturday's contest against
Arizona State, would rather refer
to it as "discolored." This color,
that color, whatever color, the
point is Stanford's locker room
has been replaced by a set for
"M*A*S*H" or "ER."
Harbour, questionable for
tonight's California game, is just
the latest addition to an ever
expanding list of casualties.
"I haven't had anything close
as far as basketball teams," said
trainer Tim Eakins who has been
around college athletes for nine
years, two with Stanford. "Noth
ing like this for basketball. Maybe
football."
To avoid a season like the foot
ball team's, at the start of the
campaign head coach Mike Mont
gomery stated that a major key to
success would be to minimize
player injuries. The Cardinal had
never been a traditionally deep
team, and this year is no differ
ent. Therefore, the issue of main
taining the health of the players
was a major concern.
So what happens? The Cardi
nal squad becomes the poster
boys for Blue Cross.
"We're really, really banged up

now," said junior forward Darren
Allaway. "We're hoping that after
the Cal game, we'll get some time
to rest and heal."
