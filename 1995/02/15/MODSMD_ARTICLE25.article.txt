# Inconsistent Bears play better on road
## 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
It's not as if those silly Golden Bears across the
Bay ever did make much sense, but California's
men's basketball team (12-8 overall, 4-7 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) this season is just further
evidence that in Weenieland, don't look for too
much rhyme or reason because chances are, you
won't find either.
California is a great case study in weird basket
ball, and weird basketball is probably the only way
to predict how the Bears will play tonight when
they visit Maples Pavilion to take on 17th-ranked
Stanford (15-5, 6-5 Pac-10).
Stanford enters the game with bragging rights
after defeating the Bears earlier this season 78-73
at Harmon Gym. Common sense would dictate
that Stanford comes into this game with the edge.
Not so, as this is a Cal team that is winless at
home during conference play, yet has gone into
Pauley Pavilion and the McKale Center to beat
two of the top squads in the nation.
"They are a team that is very talented," said
head coach Mike Montgomery. "They are capable
of playing very good basketball. They will be plen
ty good enough and have the potential to play very
well when they come."
Which Cal team will show up? The one that
went into the homes of the Pac-10's Big Two —
UCLA and Arizona — and won? Or the team that
was swept by Oregon and Oregon State just two
weeks ago on its home floor? Obviously, the Car
dinal is hoping for the latter, but, as always, is
expecting the former.
"A lot of times, they get up for big games, and
sometimes, they don't take a lot of teams like Ore
gon State seriously," said Stanford center Bart
Lammersen. "Cal plays well in the big games, and
they're going to be up for us."
