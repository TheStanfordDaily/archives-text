Stanford 7 1
Fresno State .. 0 [

The top-ranked Stanford men's tennis team
(6-0) baffled and frustrated an upstart team from
No. 21 Fresno State (2-2) by a score of 7-0 yester
day at Stanford Tennis Stadium.
At No. 1 singles, Stanford's sixth-ranked Jeff
Salzenstein defeated ninth-ranked former
Swedish Indoor Champion Fredrik Bergh, 7-6
(12-10), 6-0. As the score indicates, the match's
two sets were about as different as could be. After
losing a grueling 12-10 tie-breaker, Bergh

appeared to give up, or as tennis players are apt
to say, "tank the match," after going down two
breaks in the second set.
"Jeff figured out how to play Bergh in the sec
ond set," said Stanford head coach Dick Gould,
' and Bergh seemed to say to himself, either con
sciously or subconsciously, 'There's no way I can
beat this guy.' Jeff kept the pressure up until
Bergh wilted at the end."
Salzenstein volleyed aggressively to save the
first two out of three set points in the first-set tie
break, and also got some help from Bergh, who
double faulted on the third big point. Salzenstein
finally won the marathon tie-break on his second
opportunity for set point with a vicious spin serve
that Bergh's backhand failed to lift over the net.
"I've been struggling in tie-breakers this
year," Salzenstein said, "so I just tried to stay
positive."
Salzenstein's win clinched the dual-match vie-

Tory for the Cardinal, because the team had
already won the doubles point and Stanford's two
freshmen continued to make winning look easy
in the number 2 and 3 positions.
The Cardinal's 33rd-ranked Scott Humphries
defeated 15th-ranked Ivan Keskinov, 6-0,6-1 in a
match that was most memorable for its plethora
of disputed calls. After hitting one ball that
Keskinov called out, Humphries approached the
net and pointed out that the ball mark was touch
ing the line. In an unusual move, Keskinov then
opted to overrule himself and award Humphries
the point.
At an earlier stage in the match, a vocal dis
pute between Humphries and Keskinov caught
the attention of Salzenstein, who was serving on
the adjacent court. Distracted by the disturbance,
Salzenstein was unable to hold serve and eventu-
ally was forced to play the grueling
tie-breaker because of that break.
.Stanford's 40th-ranked Gold
stein had no trouble whatsoever
with an ailing 34th-ranked Ryan
Juinio, winning 6-1, 6-1 by keeping
the ball in the middle of the court
against Juinio, who Goldstein said
is "good with angles."
Ryan's twin brother, 60th
ranked Bryan Juinio, nearly
defeated Stanford's Jim Thomas
at No. 4. Thomas had to come
back from down 5-3 with Juinio
serving in the third set, to win 6-4,
2-6, 7-5. Juinio was so upset at the
end of the match that he threw his
racket at the net and missed, near
ly hitting Thomas with the projec
tile.
The thrown racket resulted in a
point penalty against his team
mate, 98th-ranked Blago Petrov,
who was about to serve while trail

ing 5-6 in the final set of his match
with Stanford's Grant Elliott.
Beginning the decisive game down
0-15, Petrov was unable to hold his
serve, as Elliott became the benefi
ciary of Juinio's ill-advised
tantrum, winning his match 4-6, 6-
0, 7-5.
"I told Jim that he sacrificed his
body for Grant," Gould said.
After Ricky Becker and doubles
teammate Thomas played poorly in
losing Stanford's first doubles
match of the season, 9-7. Becker
regrouped to handily beat Jake
Bragonier in No. 6 singles, 6-2, 6-2.
"Coach Gould lashed out at me
for my sloppy, fiat play in doubles,"
Becker said. "I knew I deserved it,
and it definitely fired me up for sin
gles."
In other doubles action, Stan
ford secured the doubles point with
an 8-4 victory at No. 1 for 18th
ranked Humphries and Goldstein
over Bryan Juinio and Bergh, as
well as an 8-5 victory at No. 3 for
Salzenstein and Elliott over Keski
nov and Bragonier.
