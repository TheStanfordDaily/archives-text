Stanford 7 1
Fresno State .. 0 [

The top-ranked Stanford men's tennis team
(6-0) baffled and frustrated an upstart team from
No. 21 Fresno State (2-2) by a score of 7-0 yester
day at Stanford Tennis Stadium.
At No. 1 singles, Stanford's sixth-ranked Jeff
Salzenstein defeated ninth-ranked former
Swedish Indoor Champion Fredrik Bergh, 7-6
(12-10), 6-0. As the score indicates, the match's
two sets were about as different as could be. After
losing a grueling 12-10 tie-breaker, Bergh

appeared to give up, or as tennis players are apt
to say, "tank the match," after going down two

Bergh wilted at the end."
Salzenstein volleyed aggressively to save the
first two out of three set points in the first-set tie
break, and also got some help from Bergh, who
double faulted on the third big point. Salzenstein
finally won the marathon tie-break on his second
opportunity for set point with a vicious spin serve
that Bergh's backhand failed to lift over the net.
"I've been struggling in tie-breakers this
year," Salzenstein said, "so I just tried to stay
positive."
Salzenstein's win clinched the dual-match vie-

Tory for the Cardinal, because the team had
already won the doubles point and Stanford's two
freshmen continued to make winning look easy
in the number 2 and 3 positions.
The Cardinal's 33rd-ranked Scott Humphries
defeated 15th-ranked Ivan Keskinov, 6-0,6-1 in a
match that was most memorable for its plethora
of disputed calls. After hitting one ball that
Keskinov called out, Humphries approached the
net and pointed out that the ball mark was touch
ing the line. In an unusual move, Keskinov then
opted to overrule himself and award Humphries
the point.
At an earlier stage in the match, a vocal dis
pute between Humphries and Keskinov caught
the attention of Salzenstein, who was serving on
the adjacent court. Distracted by the disturbance,
Salzenstein was unable to hold serve and eventu-
