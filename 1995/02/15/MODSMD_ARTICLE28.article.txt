# I want to play ball
## 
### 
I'm a pathetic wannabe. I
wanna be a brilliant student, I
wanna be someone who has
good hair days the mfyority of the
week and I wanna be a more deli
cate eater.
I suppose that wanting to be
these things is natural, as long as
it's within the murky confines of
realism. But I simply can't help
the fact that above all, I wanna be
on the Cardinal women's basket
ball team.
I don't even have to start. I'll
happily guard the pine, cheer
loudly and entertain Tara. Just
donning the uniform would be a
thrill — I've always wanted to
tear off those velcro warm-up
pants with cocky authority. Just
once would be enough.
Saturday night I sat in the
stands of Maples Pavilion with
my face glazed in absolute awe.
The Cardinal women pummeled
Arizona State with the grace of
ballroom dancers and the ferocity
of a Willingham workout. My
amazement was tempered, how
ever, with a lingering emptiness, a

strange longing for what cannot
be. I wanted to be out there.
Every high school athlete has
felt the emotional turmoil
between admiration and envy
when watching star collegiate

athletes show how it's done. We
tell stories about the "glory days,"
periodically dust off the old high
school tapes and relive the cama
raderie and triumph. Somehow
we forget the turnovers, the inter
ceptions, the sweaty socks and the
aching egos. All we remember is
the feeling of being on a team, of
winning, of competing. We can't


Allyson
Mizoguchi
shake it.
I try to find comfort in intramu
rals, pick-up games and even NBA
Jam. It's just not there. All that
remains from my glory days is a few
measly bragging rights — not to
mention a host of "what-ifs" and "I
coulda's."
No, I could never shoot like Kate
Starbird. I could never hustle like
Jamila Wideman. But what if I'd
stuck with basketball? What if I'd
grown another three inches? What
if I'd been able to bench more, shoot
better, run faster? What if I could
dunk?
I'm gradually learning that
sooner or later the wannabe must
discover solace in becoming some
thing more than a yesteryear high
school athlete or a cou Ida-been con
tender. This comfort is found in
Maples, at the stadium, at Sunken
Diamond and at any other place
conjured up by glory-day memories.
It's found when we watch the game
we once played and the team we
now want to be on. We've been
there. For now, I've reconciled my
jealousy with a healthy dose of real
ism: yeah, it would be awesome to
play, but I'm "moving on." Grudg
ingly-
Even though I feel them less fre
quently, I still feel the wannabe
pangs, and I doubt that they'll go
away. I can't help the fact that I
worship Anita Kaplan (who I sat
next to in Calc 19 frosh year!) and
Rachel Hemmer (who was in my
CIV section!). These women are
simply incredible, and I can't help
but put them on a pedestal.
Lest I lose sight of reality,
though, I'll try to focus on what
really matters for now — things like
hair and food and studies. Being the
dutiful fan I am, I'll root and rave
for the Cardinal women. And like
the hopeless wannabe I am, I'll wish
and pray for just one chance to sit
on that bench next to Tara. Is that
too much to ask?

Allysun and her 1M teams have
gotta wanna win if they're gonna
getta decent record.
