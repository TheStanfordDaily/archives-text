# I want to play ball

I'm a pathetic wannabe. I
wanna be a brilliant student, I
wanna be someone who has
good hair days the mfyority of the
week and I wanna be a more deli

ball team.
I don't even have to start. I'll
happily guard the pine, cheer
loudly and entertain Tara. Just
donning the uniform would be a
thrill â€” I've always wanted to
tear off those velcro warm-up
pants with cocky authority. Just
once would be enough.
Saturday night I sat in the
stands of Maples Pavilion with
my face glazed in absolute awe.
The Cardinal women pummeled
Arizona State with the grace of
ballroom dancers and the ferocity
of a Willingham workout. My
amazement was tempered, how
ever, with a lingering emptiness, a

strange longing for what cannot
be. I wanted to be out there.
Every high school athlete has
felt the emotional turmoil
between admiration and envy
when watching star collegiate

athletes show how it's done. We
tell stories about the "glory days,"
periodically dust off the old high
school tapes and relive the cama
raderie and triumph. Somehow
we forget the turnovers, the inter
ceptions, the sweaty socks and the
aching egos. All we remember is
the feeling of being on a team, of
winning, of competing. We can't
