Stanford 21
Victoria 29

To be the best, you have to play
the best. The Stanford men's
rugby team did exactly that on
Monday. Hosting the University of
Victoria, Canada, the team put
together a remarkable perfor
mance in losing 29-21.
Coming up with the short end
of the scoring stick did not disap
point a squad inspired by a match
that some observers described as
"the best in Cardinal history."
When a coach describes an
opponent as "just being an honor
to play against," the competition
has to be stiff. Victoria has the
preeminent rugby program on the
North American continent. The
majority of its players have been
playing rugby their entire lives.
Compare this to the Stanford
players, who were, for the most
part, first introduced to the game
after enrolling at the Farm. Fur
thermore, Stanford was coming
off of a 41-8 defeat against Sacra
mento State last Saturday. All the
indicators signaled a potential
blowout.
Stanford not only showed up to
play on Monday, but the Cardinal
fought for the entire 80 minutes.
The match was close throughout,
with the Cardinal trailing only 9-7
at halftime. Rested by the break,
the Cardinal pulled ahead to cap
ture a 14-9 lead early in the second
half. The underdogs kept the

match tight with a balanced mix
ture of tactics and attitude.
Using a Sunday practice to pre
pare for the match, Stanford
focused on ironing out some tech
nical wrinkles and setting an
intense tone for the game. The
practice paid huge dividends the
following day.
Offensively, Stanford success
fully applied a relentless forward
push, utilizing its improved multi
ple phase offense. Defensively, the
unit worked on "coming apart" by
consistently battering the opposi
tion with bruising hits. One key
aspect to Monday's match was the
Cardinal's ability to control the
scrums and mauls.
The team's outstanding play
was matched by its ferocious men
tality.
"We stayed focused. We concen
trated for a full 80 minutes," said
coach Franck Boivert. "This was
by far the best match of the year."
As the match wore on, Victoria
exposed the Cardinal's primary
weakness: fitness. During a 20-
minute stretch late in the second
half, Victoria capitalized on Stan
ford's fatigue and built up a lead
big enough to withstand one last
push by the Cardinal.
The results of Monday's match
couldn't dampen the spirits of a
rejuvenated Cardinal side. The
courageous effort boosted the con
fidence of a team that is just begin
ning to realize how far it can go.
Impressed with his team's per
formance, Boivert optimistically
looked towards the remainder of
the season. "This match opens up
huge opportunities," he said.
