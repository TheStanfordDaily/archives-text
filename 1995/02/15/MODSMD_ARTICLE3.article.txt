## Residents battle over Sand Hill project 
### Martin L. Yeung Contributing writer 
The feud rages on between opponents
and supporters of Stanford's proposed Sand
Hill Road extension as they wait for an envi
ronmental impact report on the project.
Late last month, Palo Alto resident Tony
Badger — a leading critic of Stanford's Sand
Hill Road expansion plans — approached
the Palo Alto City Council with a request for
an advisory ballot to determine community
sentiment on the University's expansion
plans.
Ken Schreiber, Palo Alto's director of
planning and community environment, is
waiting for an environmental impact report
to be completed before making any recom
mendations to the council, according to
Schreiber's office.
The study will probably be completed by
the end of the year.
Badger said the Sand Hill expansion plan
"is just the tip of the iceberg," adding that
"once the wheels of this development get
moving, there will be no way to stop it."
The council did not act on Badger's re
quest and has yet to take any further steps
to implement his suggestions.
Conflicts between north Palo Alto resi
dents and the University about Sand Hill
Road — which runs through the west side of
campus — have continued for more than 60
years. Complaints center around Stanford's
plans to widen and extend the road out to El

Camino Real.
The University intends to build residen
tial complexes, expand the Stanford Health
Center and the Stanford Shopping Center,
and widen Sand Hill Road into four lanes
that would link Interstate 280 with El
Camino Real.
Bill Phillips, managing director of real es
tate for Stanford Management Company,
said he hopes the University's plans will al
leviate the traffic jams on Sand Hill Road
and result in economic benefits.
"The development would not only im
prove the horrible traffic problems on Sand
Hill, but it would allow [Sand Hill Road] to
carry off the traffic that now bleeds into the
residential neighborhoods in Menlo Park,"
Phillips said.
Opponents, however, contend that the
residential construction will only make a
bad traffic situation worse. According to
Badger, Stanford has been evasive in an
swering questions and is "stonewalling" op
position against the proposed expansion.
"Making Sand Hill Road into a four-lane
expressway and linking it from 280 to El
Camino would make [Sand Hill Road] an ac
cident waiting to happen," Badger said, not
ing that the intersection would form a dead
end turn.
Criticizing the University's plans, Bad
ger said that problems caused by the con
struction, and increased residential and
