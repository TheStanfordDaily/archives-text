Polo
The Trojan horses were too much for the Cardinal
this weekend, as the Cardinal polo squads came out
of Los Angeles without a win.
The women mustered a 2-2 tie on Saturday, while
the men dropped a 4-1 decision the next day. Team
captain Ilia Christy's two goals led the way for the
women, while Jason Knighf provided the lone offense
for the men. The men could not overcome an early
deficit despite more aggressiveness later in the
match.
