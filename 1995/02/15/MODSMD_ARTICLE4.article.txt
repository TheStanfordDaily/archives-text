# OMB plan looms over University
## Proposed changes in indirect-cost policy could cost Stanford millions 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
The Clinton Administration last week is
sued two sets of proposed changes to indirect
cost recovery practices that, if instituted, will
jeopardize millions of dollars in research fund
ing for Stanford and force drastic changes in
University accounting practices.
The proposed overhaul comes soon after
Stanford settled a dispute with the federal gov
ernment involving indirect costs — overhead
costs related to research. The government ac
cused the University of claiming inappropriate
indirect costs and slashed Stanford's reim
bursement rate, costing the University mil

lions of dollars.
The Office of Management and Budget is
sued two sets of proposals for modifying Circu
lar A-21, the government document that lays
out procedures for reimbursement of indirect
costs.
One proposal outlines eight revisions to A
-21 and invites public comment in six areas
tagged for future revision. The changes are
aimed at "making the reimbursement system
more defensible, equitable and understand
able" and streamlining the reimbursement
process.
The other proposal would extend certain
cost accounting standards now applied to gov
ernment contracts, applying them to govern

ment grants as well.
All told, the revisions to A-21 could mean
profound changes both in the level of govern
ment research funding and in the accounting
practices the University must follow to receive
reimbursement.
University officials applauded some of the
proposed changes, but they voiced reservations
about several provisions of the proposal, some
of which could cost Stanford millions of dollars.
During a brief public comment period al
lowed by the OMB, the University will analyze
the proposal and issue a formal written re
sponse, according to Director of Government
and Community Relations Larry
Horton.
"These are extremely impor
tant regulations," Horton said.
"The impact of these is not well
understood in Washington" or
across the nation.
The OMB might well back off
from or further refine some pro
posed changes after the comment
period, Horton said.
"It's not at all uncommon for
the government to put out regu
lations that are overbroad .. .
and drastically [modify] the regu
lations," he said.
But Horton said the flexibility
of the OMB proposals will depend
on the overall level of public com
ment — an uncertainty given the
complexities of the OMB propos
als.
"What we don't know is . . .
how the community at large will
react," Horton said.
It is clear, however, that a new
chapter has begun in the ongoing
indirect-cost controversy.

"The storm signals are up,"
Horton said.
One of the most important
revisions proposed would prohib
it the University from using "spe
cial studies" to determine utility,
library and student services
costs. Instead, such costs would
be determined using default stan
dards outlined in A-21.
The University would receive
much less reimbursement under
the default methods, said Gov
ernment Cost and Rate Studies
Director Reed Brimhall. The dif
ference for Stanford, he said,
would be "in the millions."
The OMB proposal does call
for future study toward estab
lishing new methods for deter
mining utility, library and stu
dent services costs. But Brimhall
suggested that the OMB should
hold off on prohibiting special
studies until after they delineate
the new standards.
"I think they have the cart in
front of the horse," Brimhall
said.
The OMB proposal would also
eliminate government funding of
tuition benefits paid to depen
dents of University researchers.

The University currently pro
vides $4 million a year in depen
dent tuition benefits, of which
approximately 35 percent is paid
by the government, Brimhall
said.
Another proposed revision
would fix indirect-cost recovery
rates over the life of a project at
the rate in the year of the pro
ject's inception. Brimhall said the
impact that change will have on
Stanford is uncertain.
"It would help us or hurt us,
depending on the situation,"
Brimhall said.
The OMB proposals released
last week also spell out sweeping
changes in the accounting prac
tices the University must use to
receive reimbursement.
The proposal would apply cer
tain cost accounting standards to
government grants and require
Stanford to file disclosure state
ments on their accounting prac
tices. Brimhall said the new stan
dards would greatly increase the
University's required paperwork.
"It will change the way we pro
pose to do research and develop
ment; it will change the way we
account for it," Brimhall said.

The proposal would also estab
lish new criteria for charging
interest payments to the govern
ment.
For one, officials would have
to perform studies to determine
whether leasing or purchasing a
given building or piece of equip
ment would be more efficient — a
provision Brimhall said would
increase the University's admin
istrative burden.
The OMB proposal would also
change the language used in dis
cussing indirect-cost matters.
Indirect costs would instead be
referred to as "facilities costs and
administrative costs."
Brimhall said the change may
eliminate some of the "political
electricity" that has surrounded
indirect-cost debate in the past.
He added, however, that it might
introduce new difficulties in
accounting, as other federal reg
ulations and documents make
frequent references to indirect
costs.
"The words 'direct' and 'indi
rect' are kind of like 'Kleenex,' "
Brimhall said. "All of these docu
ments have the concepts of
'direct' and 'indirect' embedded

in them throughout."
The proposal also announces
further revisions the OMB
intends for the future, including
studies of why different institu
tions charge vastly different
reimbursement rates for facilities
and administrative costs.
But Brimhall said this idea
fails to acknowledge that there
are often "legitimate, logical rea
sons" for variations in indirect
cost rates between institutions.
"Would you expect Lockheed
and Boeing to have the same indi
rect-cost rates?" he said. "Why
would you expect Stanford and
Harvard to have the same indi
rect-cost rates?"
Other current and future revi
sions planned to A-21 include:
• Placing Stanford under the
authority of the Department of
Health and Human Services,
rather than under the Office of
Naval Research, as now.
• Delineating a process for
evaluating reasonableness of con
struction costs.
• Developing ways to charge
costs for space and facilities
directly to individual project
grants.
