# OMB plan looms over University
## Proposed changes in indirect-cost policy could cost Stanford millions 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
The Clinton Administration last week is
sued two sets of proposed changes to indirect
cost recovery practices that, if instituted, will
jeopardize millions of dollars in research fund
ing for Stanford and force drastic changes in
University accounting practices.
The proposed overhaul comes soon after
Stanford settled a dispute with the federal gov
ernment involving indirect costs â€” overhead
costs related to research. The government ac
cused the University of claiming inappropriate
indirect costs and slashed Stanford's reim
bursement rate, costing the University mil

lions of dollars.
The Office of Management and Budget is
sued two sets of proposals for modifying Circu
lar A-21, the government document that lays
out procedures for reimbursement of indirect
costs.
One proposal outlines eight revisions to A
-21 and invites public comment in six areas
tagged for future revision. The changes are
aimed at "making the reimbursement system
more defensible, equitable and understand
able" and streamlining the reimbursement
process.
The other proposal would extend certain
cost accounting standards now applied to gov
ernment contracts, applying them to govern

ment grants as well.
All told, the revisions to A-21 could mean
profound changes both in the level of govern
ment research funding and in the accounting
practices the University must follow to receive
reimbursement.
University officials applauded some of the
proposed changes, but they voiced reservations
about several provisions of the proposal, some
of which could cost Stanford millions of dollars.
During a brief public comment period al
lowed by the OMB, the University will analyze
the proposal and issue a formal written re
sponse, according to Director of Government
