# New facility in works for Biz School

### Beth Berselli Editorial staff 
Hoping to bring administrators into one location,
the Graduate School of Business is looking at con
structing a new building to connect its main facility to
the Littlefield Center.
The University Board of Trustees passed the "con
cept approval" for the new building at its meeting last
week, according to Lowell Price, secretary to the
board.
As a result of the board's approval, the Business
School can now start work on designs and cost esti
mates for the building and can begin securing dona
tions, said Paul Johnson, associate dean of adminis
tration at the Business School.
"We will definitely try to attract donors to the pro
ject," Johnson said. Although the details of the new
building are still incomplete, some general ideas for
the facility have been discussed, Johnson said.
The building will probably be about 7,000 square
feet and will connect the second and third floors of the
main Business School facility and Littlefield Center,
he said.
The second floor will house the deans of the Busi
ness School, while the third floor will be available for
faculty offices, Johnson said.
"We're pretty sure that we will need the space for
faculty," he said. "There are a number of positions
that have been approved but have not been filled yet."
The new building will bring together administra
tors who are currently housed in separate facilities,
Johnson said.
"The deans and administrators are split between
the main building and Littlefield Center, and that
makes it difficult for them," Johnson said.
The new Business School "link" would provide a
"way of tying the two buildings together" and thus sig
nificantly simplify administrative processes, he said.
Johnson said construction on the new building
could begin as early as the summer of 1996. In the
meantime, the Business School will consult with Fa
cilities and the Provost's Office about plans for the
building.
