Walk by Casa Zapata on a Friday
night this year and you might hear re
verberations of one or two lively trum
pets and poetic lyrics in Spanish.
Students from Casa Zapata have
brought together their musical talents
to form the only mariachi band on cam
pus. Members of the band unanimously
declared that the group's main purpose
is pure enjoyment.
Since fall quarter, four other Zapatis
tas with diverse musical talents have
joined freshman B.J. Lucero to form
Mariachi de Stanford.
"I just stood up during a house meet
ing in Casa Zapata last quarter and
asked if anyone wanted to be a mari
achi," Lucero said. "There was a lot of
interest. People signed up right away."
Sophomore Eric Parra said he tried
to start a mariachi band — a group
which plays traditional Mexican dance
music — last year in Casa Zapata, but, "I
was the only one committed to it, so it
was tough. There were some other in
terested musicians in the dorm, and
they said they'd never tried playing this
stuff before, but they'd give it a shot."
But last year, Parra added, the band
never got off the ground due to lack of
motivation and commitment. "Now
that B.J. is here, and I'm not the only

one dedicated to it, it's working," he
said.
Junior Perla Rodriguez said she was
eager to join the mariachi band after her
disappointing discovery early in the year
that there were no Latin American
music groups on campus.
"I asked at El Centro Chicano if there

were any Latin American or Mexican or
Chicano cultural music groups, and
they told me that th ere was just nothing
like that here," Rodriguez said.
"I think it's a good idea to have a
mariachi band because Latinos are such
