Walk by Casa Zapata on a Friday
night this year and you might hear re
verberations of one or two lively trum
pets and poetic lyrics in Spanish.
Students from Casa Zapata have
brought together their musical talents
to form the only mariachi band on cam
pus. Members of the band unanimously
declared that the group's main purpose
is pure enjoyment.
Since fall quarter, four other Zapatis
tas with diverse musical talents have
joined freshman B.J. Lucero to form
Mariachi de Stanford.
"I just stood up during a house meet
ing in Casa Zapata last quarter and
asked if anyone wanted to be a mari
achi," Lucero said. "There was a lot of
interest. People signed up right away."
Sophomore Eric Parra said he tried
to start a mariachi band — a group
which plays traditional Mexican dance
music — last year in Casa Zapata, but, "I
was the only one committed to it, so it
was tough. There were some other in
terested musicians in the dorm, and
they said they'd never tried playing this
stuff before, but they'd give it a shot."
But last year, Parra added, the band
never got off the ground due to lack of
motivation and commitment. "Now
that B.J. is here, and I'm not the only

one dedicated to it, it's working," he
said.
Junior Perla Rodriguez said she was
eager to join the mariachi band after her
disappointing discovery early in the year
that there were no Latin American
music groups on campus.
"I asked at El Centro Chicano if there

were any Latin American or Mexican or
Chicano cultural music groups, and
they told me that th ere was just nothing
like that here," Rodriguez said.
"I think it's a good idea to have a
mariachi band because Latinos are such

a large percentage of the student
population here, and the only Latin
American cultural performance
group that gets any real exposure is
the Ballet Folklorico. There should
be more," she added.
Mariachi de Stanford has not
yet obtained uniforms, though
Parra said it is the band's next step.
He added that the cost of the uni
forms is an obstacle for the band.
"El Centro Chicano gave us a
small donation, and we got some
more money from a couple of pri
vate sources," Lucero said. The
band has used the money to pur
chase a guitarron, a small Mexican
guitar.
Chris Gonzalez, assistant direc
tor of El Centro, who helped
Lucero with his funding request
for the mariachi band, said the
band would add a needed element
to campus cultural events.
"The Ballet Folklorico has been
here for something like 25 years,
and this is a logical extension of
that. Every time the Ballet per

forms they have to pay someone to
come out here and provide music,
and that can be like $300 every
time," Gonzalez said.
James Rodriguez, chair of the
Guiding Concilio at El Centro, said
there were a variety of reasons for
funding the band. "They didn't
have any funding at all, and with
the denial of the MEChA special fee
request it's been harder for groups
to get funding," he said.
"The most important thing
about them is that they were ask
ing for the opportunity to really
offer something ongoing to the
community, something that no
other group at this time offers. And
when I say community I don't just
mean the Mexican and Chicano
community, but the whole cam
pus," Rodriguez added.
Freshman Danny Hsu, the only
non-Latino member of the band,
said that his cultural background
does not inhibit his musical
endeavors with the band. "I really
like it. I've played all sorts of stuff
on the violin, but this is really a
new experience," he said. "The
music is more aggressive-sounding
than the classical stuff I'm used to
playing."
Presently, the band's main con

cern is finding musicians who can
cover the instruments that com
plete the mariachi sound. "We're
looking for good trumpet players
and violinists," said Parra, adding
that the violin is the most outspo
ken sound in the music.
"Everyone in the band plays the
guitar, which can be a problem,
because that can be too much,"
Parra said. "B.J. and I both play
the trumpet. I play the guitarron
and B.J. plays the viuela. Everyone
sings, even trumpeters, when they
aren't playing. Not necessarily
solos, but in a chorus."
Members of the band said mari
achi music is difficult to character
ize. Although they agreed that
mariachi music is usually seen as
"a festive traditional music played
at parties or weddings," Lucero
was quick to add, "It can also be
poetic and sad. There are a lot of
songs that are about tragically
dying for love."
Junior George Lopez, who plays
guitar in the band, added that
mariachi songs sung with feeling
are "Latin American soul."
The band is presently practicing
songs such as Volver, Volver;
Zacatecas; Las Mananitas; and El
Rey.
