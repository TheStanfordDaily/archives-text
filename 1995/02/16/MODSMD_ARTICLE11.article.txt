# Asian-American groups look for bone marrow donors
## 
### Li-Cheng Wang 
Two Stanford ethnic fraternities are join
ing the national Asian American Donor Pro
gram in the difficult search to match bone
marrow donors with ethnic patients infected
with blood diseases, such as leukemia victims.
For the second year, program workers —
along with the Asian-American fraternity
Lambda Phi Epsilon, and the African-
American fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha —
will be at Old Union tomorrow asking eth
nic Stanford students to participate in sim
ple blood tests to determine possible future
bone marrow donors.
Every year, thousands of ethnic minori
ties face a tremendous disadvantage in find
ing a suitable donor, said True Truong, a
senior Lambda member.
Immediate family members only provide
a 30 percent chance of a suitable blood
match for victims, who must then seek
their next best option — their ethnic com
munities — for potential matches, said
Tonia Chen, the program's outreach coordi
nator, adding that even then, chances for
success remain between 20,000 and a mil-

lion to one.
Yet the discrepancy between ethnic
minorities, who face a merely single-digit
chance of attaining a donor match, and
Caucasians — who have a 60 percent
chance of finding a match — is astronomi
cal, the program contends.
"Only 4.6 percent of the Asian popula
tion have participated in blood donation
programs nationwide," Chen said. "If you
are a ethnic patient, you have almost no
chance of getting a donor."
Truong explained that the Stanford stu-

dent blood-registration program will
"increase the national ethnic pool, so that
grieving people who are suffering will have

good chances to survive."
"In fact, thousands of Asians die every
year" from this tragedy, Chen said. In Cali
fornia alone, around 200 Asian Americans
spend every day in an almost hopeless
search for a match, he added.
Anxiety about duration of commitment,
needles and pain create a lot of misinforma
tion about this type of event, Chen said,
which leads to community apathy and non
participation.
"This is so worthwhile," Truong said.
"You could save someone's life — when else
in life could you say that?" Chen empha
sized that the two tablespoons of blood lost
in the procedure, which lasts less than 15
minutes, could be replenished by crawling
down a flight of stairs. If called upon as a
donor, the small loss of valuable marrow
would regenerate within 10 days.
The significance of the Stanford commu
nity contribution must not be diminished
by the percents and numerical risks,
Truong said. Step-by-step action and
involvement by Stanford students provides
a base for both potential matches and
increased community education, he added.
