## Tensions rise between Israeli government, right-wing settlers 
### 
HEBRON, West Bank (AP) â€”
The leader of the outlawed Kach
group prayed over the grave of
the Hebron massacre gunman
yesterday, lauding him as a role
model, as tensions rose between
right-wing settlers and the
Israeli government.
Hours earlier, police arrested
the founder of the Jewish settler
movement, Rabbi Moshe
Levinger, and his wife, Miriam.
The two are accused of assault
ing security officers ten months
ago, Israel Radio said.
Hebron settlers charged that
the government was using the
anniversary of the mosque mas
sacre, when settler Baruch Gold
stein gunned down 29 Palestini
an worshippers, to gain support
for evacuating the 450 Jews
from the city of 80,000 Palestini
ans.
Although the massacre took
place last Feb. 25, the anniver

sary according to the Muslim
and Jewish calenders is this
week on Tuesday and Thursday,
respectively.
"They (the government) are
trying to exploit these days . . .
and incite the public against the
Hebron settlement," said settler
spokesman Noam Arnon.
After the massacre, Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin report
edly came close to ordering the
Hebron community removed,
but relented at the last minute,
fearing right-wing protest.
At Goldstein's grave in the
nearby settlement of Kiryat
Arba, Kach leader Baruch
Marzel read psalms yesterday to
honor "a holy and special man."
"If the government doesn't do
what it is supposed to do and
make order in the country, we
are liable, Heaven forbid, to see
others killed as he was," Marzel
told reporters.

Goldstein was bludgeoned to
death by the Palestinians he was
shooting at inside Hebron's
Tomb of the Patriarchs.
"Of course, (Goldstein) was
special . . . No one can say a bad
word about him," Marzel said.
Goldstein was a member of
Kach, an extreme-right group
which was outlawed along with
its sister movement Kahane
Lives after the massacre.
Rabin warned Tuesday that
police would take steps against
militant settlers who praised
Goldstein's actions. Government
spokesman Uri Dromi
denounced Marzel's comments
and said the government was
examining recent statements for
illegality.
Dromi added that a memorial
service planned for Thursday at
Goldstein's grave would be
banned if officials discovered it
involved "illegal organizations."
