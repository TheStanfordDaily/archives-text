# Prosecutors win retest of Simpson blood
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Hoping to demol
ish claims that police planted evidence to
frame O.J. Simpson, prosecutors won
approval yesterday to retest blood from his
home and the crime scene for traces of a lab
oratory preservative.
Judge Lance Ito granted approval for the
emergency FBI testing as a prosecutor said
Simpson's blood was found on a gate in the
alley at the condominium where his ex-wife
and a friend of hers were slashed to death.
Prosecutors contend that if police planted
blood that had been drawn from Simpson or
from Nicole Brown Simpson's corpse, it
would have contained a commonly used lab
preservative called EDTA.
If the tests find no EDTA, the investiga
tors will be exonerated, prosecutor Rockne
Harmon said during a hearing held with the
jury out of the room.
The tests will be conducted Monday on
such items as the blood on the gate and a
sock found in Simpson's bedroom. The sock
was stained with what prosecutors said was
his ex-wife's blood.
The blood on the gate was identified as

Simpson's by recent tests, Harmon said,
Previously, prosecutors said Simpson's
blood was found leading from the bodies
toward the gate, through which the killer is
alleged to have fled.
Police took a blood sample from Simpson
the day after the murders when the former
football star came under suspicion. They
also drew blood from Ms. Simpson's body.
Those samples were then mixed with EDTA,
according to prosecutors.
Legal experts said the testing for EDTA
may be unprecedented and ultimately less
than definitive. Harmon, in fact, noted in
court that EDTA also is present in laundry
detergent and many foods, and could be pre
sent on Simpson's socks.
In other developments, ABC yesterday
showed a "closed-circuit presentation,"
filmed three months before the murders, in
which Simpson touts a vitamin supplement
called Juice-Plus and says it made him feel so
good, he no longer had to take pain pills for
his arthritis. The defense has claimed that
Simpson's arthritis and bad knees rendered
him incapable of carrying out the slayings.

After yesterday's hearing on the blood,
testimony resumed and the defense contin
ued its campaign to suggest police over
looked or botched evidence.
Sgt. David Rossi, who was grilled by
defense attorney F. Lee Bailey on Tuesday,
returned to the stand and insisted he was
careful not to obliterate any evidence by
walking on it.
Bailey accused the officer of failing to fol
low police regulations for handling a crime
scene, suggesting Rossi should have made
sure the coroner was called immediately.
The officer said that was not his job.
The coroner didn't arrive until hours
after the bodies of Ms. Simpson and Ronald
Goldman were found, thereby losing an
opportunity to more closely fix a time of
death.
In his opening statement, defense attor
ney Johnnie Cochran Jr. suggested police
smeared Ms. Simpson's blood on one of the
socks in Simpson's room. Harmon said the
gate blood will also be tested for EDTA in
case the defense argues that a detective
sprinkled Simpson's blood on the gate.
