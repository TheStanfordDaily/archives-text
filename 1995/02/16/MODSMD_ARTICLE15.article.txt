TAICHUNG, Taiwan (AP) - Fire
roared through a crowded three-story
nightclub yesterday night, killing at
least 67 people and injuring 11 in Tai
wan's deadliest fire on record.
The cause of the fire that gutted the
popular Weierkang Club, a karaoke bar
and restaurant, wasn't immediately
known. Some survivors said it broke out
in a stairwell, while others reported
hearing an explosion on the second floor.
News reports said more than 100 cus
tomers were inside when the fire broke
out. Police said iron bars on the windows
prevented many from escaping.
Newspapers said it was the highest
fire death toll in Taiwan's history.
Badly burned bodies were taken to a
makeshift morgue, where crying rela
tives tried to identify them. One woman
collapsed when she recognized the body
of a family member.
The fire also damaged a restaurant
next door, a nearby house, and at least
five motorscooters parked outside. Fire
blackened furniture and walls could be
seen through the building's windows.
Many of the bodies were found on the
second floor, "packed in like sardines,"
said volunteer firefighter Lee Yung

chuan. He said firefighters were
exhausted from carrying bodies out of
the building.
A manager of the club, Wu Chen-seng,
was being held for questioning.
Taichung, a port city about 75 miles
southwest of Taipei, is Taiwan's third
largest city.
Some witnesses told police the fire
broke out behind the first-floor bar of
the Weierkang Club. National television
also quoted survivors who said they
heard an explosion, possibly on the sec
ond floor.
Other survivors told Associated Press
Television the fire started in the stair
well between the first and second floors.
One witness said a waiter tried to use a
fire extinguisher, but the fire was too
big.
"There were so many people on the
second floor at that time, and there was
no way that we could get out," another
witness said.
Police said firefighters extinguished
the blaze in an hour.
Taichung Mayor Lin Po-jung and Tai
wan provincial Gov. James Soong visited
the scene of the fire and expressed con
dolences to the families of the dead.
