Boy saves 14
PINE BLUFF, Ark. (AP) -
Flames were melting a mobile
home around him "like a
marshmallow" when Steven
Hines rushed inside to see if
anyone was trapped.
The 17-year-old boy — who
has a delinquency record —
roused a dozen children, ages 4
to 13, and their two adult
babysitters, both in their 70s,
singlehandedly carrying them
all outside.
Despite the violent blaze, "it
was like they were all having
the same dream. Like they had
all just finished playing," he
said.
It wasn't until hours later
that he realized what he had
done. "I got scared then," he
said.
Hines said he was riding his
bicycle home from a grocery
store Saturday night when he
spotted flames from the house's
chimney.
He called into the house but
got no answer. The door was
unlocked so he went inside,
where his attention was drawn
to the ceiling.
"Flames were moving across
like waves on the ocean," he
said Tuesday. "Stuff was melt
ing. It was like a marshmallow."
One 9-year-old boy died in
the house, and when authorities
removed the body Hines said he
had to turn away.
"I didn't sleep that night. I
was thinking about the boy,"
Hines said.
Authorities said the fire
started near a wood-burning
stove.
Cease-fire intact
LIMA, Peru (AP) — Peru
pulled back troops and tanks
yesterday from populated areas
of the border with Ecuador a day
after a cease-Fire took
hold.
More than half the troops and

at least 300 tanks have returned
to their bases, said Carlos Calero
of the government radio station
in Tumbes, 18 miles from the
border with Ecuador.
"The tension has dissipated
and the population is calm,"
Calero said.
A cease-fire went into effect at
noon Tuesday. No fighting was
reported yesterday, although
both sides reported fighting
Tuesday.
"It now seems the cease-fire is
being respected by the govern
ment of Ecuador," President
Alberto Fujimori said yesterday
from a military outpost in the
disputed zone.
Russia needs insulin
MOSCOW (AP) - Anatoly
Nozdrachev doesn't know
where his next batch of insulin
will come from. Neither do his
doctors.
"I just know I can't live with
out it," said Nozdrachev, 61,
who has to inject himself with
insulin twice a day. He also
knows he may soon fall victim
to an insulin shortage threaten
ing hundreds of thousands of
diabetics across Russia.
The shortage has been creat
ed by the Russian Health Min
istry, which is trying to force
Moscow and other cities to pur
chase a domestically produced
insulin — even though it's not
available and hasn't even been
approved by the ministry.
A result of bureaucratic
bungling and misguided moves
toward market economics, the
potentially devastating short
age reflects the instability of
Russia's health-care system and
the consequences of the unrav
eling of the Soviet Union's once
extensive social safety net.
Russia's diabetics have been
relying on imported insulin
since 1989, when the Soviet
Union closed down its facilities
because of unsafe conditions
and outdated methods.
