## Editorial Stanford Fund deal 
### 
Committee has reached
a compromise that has
both good and bad ideas

STANFORD University is a
business. And like any good
business, yesterday it reassert
ed control over its greatest financial
asset — its alumni.
While the ASSU and administra
tion hailed the Stanford Fund com
promise as an improvement over
last quarter's policy, students
should carefully consider its ramifi
cations before jumping on the band
wagon.
Though less radical than the orig
inal plan to strip student groups of
nearly all their fund-raising powers,
the policy is still primarily intended
to promote University interests.
For example, while student
groups can now solicit donations
after registering with the Office of
Development, administrators will
have the power to approve or reject
their fund-raising plans.
This power is not restricted to
rejecting plans just because they are
unfeasible. The Development Office
can also reject those that "compete
unnecessarily with other established
University fund-raising efforts or
priorities."
The lack of student representa
tion in the approval process leaves
ample room for abuse of power by
University officials. And the policy's
wording makes clear the adminis
tration's intention to protect the
interests of its own projects over
those of student groups.
Even so, student groups should
have some reason to cheer under the
new policy. For example, particular
groups can be exempted from the
process if their needs cannot be met
by the Stanford Fund.
Even with these provisions, how
ever, students must not forget that
by signing on to the Stanford Fund
policy, they are essentially handing
to the University their right to solic
it funds.

Under the proposed rules, groups
which raise funds through the
Development Office will receive a
total of $150,000 next year. The pol
icy includes no provisions for
increasing this number in the future
— a clause which may come back to
haunt student groups.
According to the terms under
which the new policy was negotiat
ed, the ASSU Senate must approve
it in order for it to take effect.
Senators must not slip into the
background through a quick and
unanimous vote on this issue. They
owe it to the students to engage in a
real discussion of the ramifications
of the Stanford Fund policy.
However, senators must keep in
mind that if they do reject the pro
posal, they will be left in the same
position they were in before negotia
tions began — the situation which
forced senators to complain in the
first place.
Even so, senators should consider
an active response to the proposal's
shortfalls. The senate should consid
er insisting on student representa
tion in the process of accepting and
rejection fund-raising plans. In addi
tion, it should question the fairness
of permanently fixing the $150,000
that will be available for groups
working through the Development
Office.
Students who are concerned
about the policy should seek out sen
ators and attend senate meetings to
make their voice heard. This policy
is likely the most important issue
the senate will decide this year; it
must not be taken lightly.
The president, provost and cabi
net will no doubt approve the policy
as a way to strengthen the Develop
ment Office, leaving the ASSU Sen
ate as its only potential stumbling
block.
Above all, what senators and stu
dents must debate is whether, in for
mulating a strict new Stanford
Fund policy, the University has
strayed too far into the realm of stu
dents' rights.
And if it has, the senate should
kick the University back out.
