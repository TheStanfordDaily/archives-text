Farm would gain from elimination of eucalyptus grove

PERHAPS I, too, am somewhat
provincial — certainly I'm no
professor of biological sciences
— but my reading comprehension is
adept enough to realize that Prof.
Robert T. Schimke's letter from Feb.
15 did not address a single issue
brought up in Monday's editorial on
eucalyptus trees. The editorial pointed
out that eucalyptus trees, because
they are such fast growers, use up so
many nutrients that other plants have

a difficult time coexisting. It also
noted that since so many of the euca
lyptus in the grove are under attack
by a wood-boring beetle, now is per
haps a good time to correct one mis
take of the past and replace the euca
lyptus with something else, something
native to the area being the natural
and logical replacement. Prof.
Schimke's letter stretched this idea to
its utmost extreme in order to debunk
it.

Sure, there was a faint and tiny
hint of environmental idealism regard
ing how nice it would be if the campus
had been preserved in its native glory,
but I think the editors would be the
first to agree that such an idea is
absolutely impractical now. For now I
think The Daily isn't advocating the
removal of the palms or cherry trees
that are so beautiful this time of year,
nor did they seem to care about maize
or illegal immigrants. The issue at

hand is the fate of the huge, dark
grove of eucalyptus trees that com
pletely dominate the arboretum. It's
one of the few places on campus where
hardly anybody spends any time at all.
It's dark, it's ugly, and now apparent
ly it's under attack by its natural
enemy. Nostalgic-world travelers
aside, I think most people on the
Farm would applaud a change.
