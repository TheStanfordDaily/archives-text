# A 						change in tenure
## Med school faculty concerned about proposal to make tenure more difficult 
### Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing writer 
School of Medicine faculty members are
concerned about recently proposed changes
which would make it harder to get tenure,
and are asking for more information about
the proposal.
"The tenure [issue] is something that
needs more thought and discussion," said
Michael Amylon, associate professor of clin
ical pediatrics.
Medical School Dean David Korn pro
posed the tenure changes — which would
delay by up to five years a professor's eligi
bility for lifetime positions at the Medical
School — at the beginning of the year.
"Patient care is not met by the tradition
al tenure system," Amylon said, "but we
need to discuss the new proposal."
Although the Medical School Faculty

Senate held a meeting last month dedicated
to the tenure proposal, it was mainly a pre
sentation of the proposal's components,
leaving no time for faculty members to ex
press interest and ideas, Amylon said.
"People are not informed enough," said
Ann Margaret Arvin, professor of pediatrics.
"Understanding the rationale and conse
quences is the next stage."
The proposal will not affect current facul
ty members' tenure but it will impact future
program planning. Under the new recom
mendations, there will be less flexibility for
recruiting new people since positions will be
less secure, Amylon said.
"It's a practice that has existed for
decades and changing it makes us different
from other universities," Arvin said. "It also
affects our ability to recruit new profes
sors."
Bruce Reitz, chair of the Department of

Cardiothoracic Surgery,
said he agreed with the pro
posal.
"Now it takes a long time
for people to establish their
career and develop their
qualifications. This takes
some pressure off for people
to develop the world-class
reputation necessary for
tenure," he said.

"In some senses it hurts
us, yet not many other medical schools have
the tenure — they just contract people for
periods of time. I'm not quite as pessimistic"
as others who are wary of the new proposal,
he added.
The University Faculty Senate has ap
pointed a committee which will research the


Korn
tenure proposal headed by Wal
ter Falcon, director of the Insti
tute for International Studies.
"It'll take months for the
various groups to discuss and
make amendments before the
policy will affect academic life,"
said Anatomy Prof. Larry Math
ers, chair of the Medical School
Faculty Senate.
"We're closer to the begin
ning than the end of the process
of deliberation," he added.
The Medical School Faculty
Senate will continue to debate

the effect of these proposals.
Questions include the need for
the changes as well as the
assumptions which underlie the
whole tenure system, said
Mathers.
"Another important question
is the conflict between academic
concerns, such as the retention
and recruitment of good faculty
versus economic issues," Math
ers added.
The senate also plans to meet
with Falcon's committee next
week to further discuss the
issue.
"The proposal is a spring
board for discussion rather than
a final document," Mathers
said.
