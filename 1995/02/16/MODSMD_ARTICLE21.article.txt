## Tossing another nominee 
### 
Masturbation, i didn't under
stand what the big deal was. Not the
act, but the controversy surround
ing the ex-Surgeon General. Well, actually
teaching kids about solo love may be a bit
much, but please, like that would change
anything.
All kids start poking and pulling as soon
as they figure out how to use the restickable
tabs on their Pampers. It's a natural
instinct, a fixed-action pattern or something.
like the Clinton people never explore.
Like Bob Dole never does a little yanky
yanky with his good hand now and then.
Come on. They could have thrown it into sex
ed nicely, right after the tacky film strip
about periods and pads.
No big whoop.
But it bothered somebody, or a bunch of
somebodies, so now they've got to find a new
Surgeon General. All the candidates are
pretty superb, I'd guess, so at some point
trivia tips the balance. Like cute grandkids.
That Nicole Miller tie. A kindergarten pal in
the Oval Office.
Thus time, Dr. Henry Foster, Jr. has been
anointed. Probably because of his stellar
glasses. Maybe his "I Have a Future" pro
gram had something to do with it, too.
Seems like a good deal, the appointed
position. Skip the election fatigue, avoid
spending inherited millions, and alleviate
the "stress on the family." But these days,
the thought of being a presidential chosen
one makes me a little woozy.
Dr. Foster may have felt lucky at one
point; today he might not be so sure. Besides

meeting Ted Koppel, the past week hasn't
been much fun for the doctor. At all. The
gynecologist thing probably frightened peo
ple, and the next thing you know — surprise
— he's performed abortions.
Waves of panic all over.
It's funny, though, because I thought the
Supreme Court had mentioned something
about them being legal. And constitutionally
sound. I could be wrong.
But as it turns out, the big issue isn't
abortion itself, nor the fact that he says he
abhors the practice. It's about numbers.
About how many abortions he's actually
done. It seems silly, but the people want to
know the facts.
Fine.
People don't like the spin — especially
bad spin. So the Clintonians have got to
improve their focus and presentation. See,
this whole nomination process is like any
relationship. It's always better to spill it up
front than to let problems fester.
They should try the honesty approach,
since that's what people want. Staffers could
set an example and start by admitting to
smoking out once or twice. And liking it. Yay
for hemp, they could say.
If it were true, of course.
Maybe no one out there in public land
would gasp with this well-I-don't-care-that
he-smoked-I-just-care-about-the-number-
of-joints-smoked routine that's being played
out with the Foster abortions. Is it the act or
the numbers? Let's figure it out. The hon
esty approach is the test.
If that doesn't fly, then it's totally clear

why these nominations turn into major fias
coes. Everyone's freaked out by sex. Maybe
that's what happens when kids are given the
message that it's not OK to figure out what's
down there. Bad, bad.
Look: all those Generals and Justices (or
wanna-be's) — Clarence, Zoe, Kimba, Joyce
lyn, now Henry — and their "problems" —
harassment, nannies, birth control, mastur
bation, abortion. What's the pattern? It's
about touching ourselves and each other,
dealing with the consequences and taking
care of the kids.
So if Dr. Foster is gently yanked out of
the nominee's chair, Clintonites should just
forget about choosing people who can find
and use reproductive organs. Even if they're
honest about it.
It's that simple.
Go with the orthopedist who's taken a
vow of celibacy, well-adjusted or not. Just
avoid anyone who has anything to do with
the whole childbearing process. Any part of
it. Personally or professionally. And certain
ly ax anyone who can comment on crotch
grabbing.
I guess it makes those somebodies out
there kind of queasy. It may be less than
ideal, but at least there will be fewer botched
nominations.

Julie wants to remind Dr. Foster not to hand
out any condoms if he ever makes it to the
Hill.
