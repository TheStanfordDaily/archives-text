## Tennis over WSU Cougars no match for Cardinal 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
Stanford 9
Washington St. 0

The Cardinal women's tennis
team (4-0) brought out the
brooms for the fourth time this
season as Stanford swept the
Washington State Cougars off the
courts of the Stanford Tennis
Stadium yesterday with a 9-0
shellacking.
The Cardinal moved its season
total match record to 45-3 as the
team only allowed one match to
go to three sets. In their victori
ous sets, the No. 3-ranked Stan
ford women did not allow their
Cougar opponent to envision even
a glimmer of hope. Besides their
one triumphant set, the Cougars
could muster only one set with
four successful games.
Looking comfortable in her

traditional No. 1 singles spot,
sophomore Katie Schlukebir (3-0)
breezed to victory, disposing of
Cougar Emma Lin in furious
fashion 6-3, 6-1.
While freshman Ania Bleszyn
ski took a short hiatus from sin
gles competition, senior Kim
Shasby (3-0) stepped up one posi
tion and sent WSU's Kameran
Bender back to the Cougar home
land with a 6-3, 6-0 defeat. Sopho

off of a two-match rest, demol

Washington State freshman
Linette Visage (6-3), presented
Stanford with its only challenge
of the day in the No. 4 singles
match. The most successful
Cougar of the season jumped out
quickly against Stanford's own
promising freshman, Julie Scott,
and took the first set 6-3.
Scott fought back, however,
and forced a third and deciding
set with a 6-4 victory. This took

the wind out of Visage's sail as
Scott rode the second set victo
ry's wave of momentum all the
way through the third set, cruis
ing 6-0.
Senior co-captain Amy
Chiminello continued her trip
on the road to recovery with a
therapeutic 6-1, 6-2 demolishing
of Narelle Hall in the No. 5
match. Junior Wendy Sacks
captured her third victory of the
season by the same score over
Sheetal Khanna.
Coming into the match, the
Cardinal looked to get back on
the track in doubles competition
after dropping all three of its
doubles matches in the dual
match against the University of
the Pacific. The team did just
that with three decisive victo
ries.
"We really needed to start
working together more and we
were able to get that going
against them," Bleszynski said.
The freshman teamed up
once again with Schlukebir in
the No. 1 doubles match for a
lopsided 6-0, 6-1 over Hall and
Visage. The second and third
doubles matches saw an equal
amount of domination by the
Cardinal.

Chiminello and Scott (3-0)
pounded Lin and Senn for a 6-2,
6-1 triumph. Shasby and sopho
more Emily Burt (2-1) got
revenge for a tough defeat
against Pacific at the expense of
WSU's Bender and Khanna 6-2,
6-1.
The Cardinal now takes their
undefeated dual-match record
on the road for the first time
this season. Two matches in Ari
zona promise to provide a chal
lenge to Stanford as the team
enters a more difficult portion of
its schedule.
Stanford will take a swing at
Arizona in Tucson on Friday
afternoon. The Wildcats can
boast a 5-3 dual-match victory
over UCLA this season. The
Cardinal have been looking to
their future collisions with the
Bruins as two of their toughest
challenges of the season.
The women will then venture
to Tempe for Saturday's match
against the Arizona State Sun
Devils. Despite its practically
übiquitous success at home, the
Cardinal actually looks forward
to getting out on the road.
"It'll be a good experience to
play in front of, or almost
against, an opposing crowd,"
Bleszynski said. "I'm excited
because I think our first dual
matches on the road with the
entire team there will really
build up the 'team' concept."
