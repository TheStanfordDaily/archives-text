The Cardinal women's tennis
team (4-0) brought out the
brooms for the fourth time this
season as Stanford swept the
Washington State Cougars off the
courts of the Stanford Tennis
Stadium yesterday with a 9-0
shellacking.
The Cardinal moved its season
total match record to 45-3 as the

could muster only one set with
four successful games.

of the day in the No. 4 singles
match. The most successful

quickly against Stanford's own
promising freshman, Julie Scott,
and took the first set 6-3.
Scott fought back, however,
and forced a third and deciding
set with a 6-4 victory. This took
