Stanford 13 10!
San Fransico St. 0 1 ,

After getting shutout in both games of a double
header sweep by Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo over the
weekend, the Stanford softball team came out
swinging Tuesday, crushing the San Francisco State
Gators 13-0 in the first game and 10-1 in the night
cap.
Stanford (4-4) combined solid pitching with its
offensive explosion to win the first game. Freshman
sensation Jessica Schulman (2-2) got the victory,
tossing her second complete-game shutout of the
season. Schulman struck out four Gators while
walking none in five innings, lowering her team
leading ERA to 0.95. Marisa Owens (0-2) took the
loss for San Francisco State.
The game remained close through the first three
innings, with the Cardinal clinging to a 2-0 lead
behind single runs in the first and third frame. In
the home half of the fourth, however, Stanford

erupted for 11 runs. Doubles by shortstop Summer
Lee, who went four for four with four RBI, and
Amanda Renteria, who went three for three, keyed
the Cardinal rally. For the game, Stanford racked up
14 hits.
"We played really well," Stanford coach Sandy


Teressa Trusty â€” Daily
The Stanford softball team circled the bases a
number of times against San Francisco State.
Pearce said. "We were down after
[hitting poorly against] San Luis
Obisbo, so we really concentrated
on our hitting in practice.
Stanford also dominated the sec
ond game, scoring three times in
the second and third innings, once
in the fourth, and three more times
in the fifth. Sophomore Angela
Webb (1-2) went the distance for
the Cardinal, striking out five,
walking two, and allowing just one
hit in five innings of work.
"Both of our pitchers Eire doing a
nice job of mixing up their pitches
and changing speeds," Pearce said.
"Another key to their performance,
though, is [Cardinal catcher] Lynn
She's calling some great
games behind the plate."
In addition to commanding both
Cardinal pitchers, Anderson led the
12-hit attack, going four for four
with two doubles and two RBI.
The Cardinal gets its next test on
Saturday, in a noon double-header
against San Jose State at El Camino
Park. Although the Spartans are
just 1-6 on the season, they are bet
ter than their record indicates.
"They're not a top-20 team right
now, but that's only because
they've been swept by Cal and Fres
no State, two really tough teams.
We're going to have to play well to
win," Pearce said.
