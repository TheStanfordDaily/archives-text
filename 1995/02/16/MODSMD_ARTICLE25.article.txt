Stanford 13 10!
San Fransico St. 0 1 ,

After getting shutout in both games of a double
header sweep by Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo over the
weekend, the Stanford softball team came out
swinging Tuesday, crushing the San Francisco State
Gators 13-0 in the first game and 10-1 in the night
cap.
Stanford (4-4) combined solid pitching with its
offensive explosion to win the first game. Freshman
sensation Jessica Schulman (2-2) got the victory,
tossing her second complete-game shutout of the
season. Schulman struck out four Gators while
walking none in five innings, lowering her team
leading ERA to 0.95. Marisa Owens (0-2) took the
loss for San Francisco State.
The game remained close through the first three
innings, with the Cardinal clinging to a 2-0 lead
behind single runs in the first and third frame. In
the home half of the fourth, however, Stanford

erupted for 11 runs. Doubles by shortstop Summer
Lee, who went four for four with four RBI, and
Amanda Renteria, who went three for three, keyed
the Cardinal rally. For the game, Stanford racked up
14 hits.
