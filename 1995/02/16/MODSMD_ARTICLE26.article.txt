Stanford 83
California 70

Axe, schmaxe. The 17th-ranked Cardinal men's
basketball team's 83-70 triumph against California
last night finished off a season sweep over the Bears.
Bay-sketball nowadays means Stanford (16-5 over
all, 7-5 in the Pacific 10 conference).
"It's an important win," said Stanford sopho
more point guard Brevin Knight. "Even after we
beat them the first time, some people still thought
they were better than us. I don't understand that.
It's a boost for us just to show that we are for real."
"It's also real important because we needed to get
a win to stay in the upper half of the Pac-10. We also
needed to get some confidence back where we win
games when we need to win games."
A sold-out Maples Pavilion rocked and rolled in
this 225 th meeting between the two rivals, where
Cardinal dominance over Cal (12-9, 4-8 in the Pac
-10) was the main motif of the match-up. Cal's
largest and only lead during the game was a one
point advantage in the first minute.
Knight set the tempo early on, taking it straight
to and through the gut of the Bear defense. The
sophomore maestro spun some magical music pene
trating at will and either dishing off to a waiting
teammate for the easy lay-in or sinking a smooth
basket.
"I thought I had to go out and assert myself ear
lier in the game," Knight said. "They gave me oppor
tunities to get to the basket. For some reason, they
always want to play me baseline to baseline. I felt
that I had to make them pay, get some points for me
or other people."
He did both. Knight finished with 16 points, 12
assists, five rebounds and two steals.
"Brevin really controlled the game as far as han
dling the ball and giving the ball to people," said
Cardinal head coach Mike Montgomery. "He was
penetrating and finding people. He did a great job.
He had the ball in his hands. He knew what he
wanted to do. He didn't force it. He penetrated, he
forced help, he drew, he kicked, and that's what he's
so good at.
"There's other times when he scored more, but
when he had the ball in his hands, you felt real good
'about what was going to happen."
Cal head coach Todd Bozeman was quick to agree
saying, "Almost every basket [Stanford] got came
off of [Knight's] penetration and him opening things
up in the paint."
He and junior forward Darren Allaway were the
offensive show in the first half. Knight and Allaway
led the club with 10 first-half points. Allaway com
pleted a perfect shooting game, making 3-of-3 from

the field and 4-of-4 from the
foul line for 14 points.
"Darren did a nice job for
us," Montgomery said. "Allaway
was boarding the ball and doing

a good job for us."
The entire Stanford team
shot well, hitting field goals at a
55.1 percent clip. Conspicuously
absent in the first half, however
was Cardinal guard Dion Cross.
With six-foot-six Bear guard
Jelani Gardner on him, Cross
had just three first-half points.
"Cross just couldn't get a

shot," Montgomery said. "[Call
had Gardner on him some. And
at six-foot-six, they made the
decision to run at him so that
they would really close on Dion
and make him put it on the
floor."
The second half, however,
was an entirely different story
for the Stanford sharpshooter.
With Cal creeping close in the
final period, Cross's 18 second
half points — which gave him a
game-high 18 — were more
than welcome.
"To [Cross's] credit, he ends
up shooting six for eleven which
is much more preferable than
trying to put up seventeen shots
and still making only six shots,"
Montgomery said.
Down by six at halftime, the
Bears hit two quick baskets to
bring them within two. Cal
hung in there for awhile, dan
gerously close to overtaking
Stanford, until swingman David
Harbour scored five straight
points to jump start an 18-4
Cardinal run.
"We came out kind of flat in
the second half," Harbour said.
"But we found it within our
selves to pick up the intensity."
The stellar sixth-man wasn't
even sure if he would be playing
due to a badly sprained ankle.
"During shoot-around,
[Coach Montgomery] himself
put me through some tests,"
Harbour said. "It was a pretty
good sprain. It was up in the air.
I woke up this morning, walked
around. I could run and go
through everything, so there
was no reason that I couldn't
play."
Harbour made quite an
impact with his 13 points off the
bench as well as his defensive
effort against Bear leader
Monty Buckley, who had just
four second-half points.
"Harbour came in and just
did a wonderful job for us,"
Montgomery said. "He picked
up our intensity and got into

Buckley a little bit. We were
having some problems with
Buckley because of our match
ups. We got ourselves into some
problems, but Harbour went in
and did a very nice job."
The Stanford spurt, which
gave the Cardinal its largest
lead at 18 points, was answered
quickly and emphatically by a
Bear barrage of three-point
shooting. Cal nailed five treys
within a four minute span mid
way through the second half,
closing the lead to 11.
"We fell asleep a little bit
when they had the straight
threes that got them back in the
game," Montgomery said.
"They were uncontested, and
that's the one thing we didn't
want — to allow them uncon
tested looks at the basket. They
got free looks. Bang, bang,
bang, they were in the ball
game."
The hot shooting was timely
for Cal who struggled offensive
ly throughout most of the game
making just 35.4 percent of its
field goals. Stanford's defense,
which struggled in the Arizona
desert last week, showed up
strong as evidenced by Bear fab
freshman forward Tremain
Fowlke's awful 2-of-ll shoot
ing.
Nevertheless, Cal still stayed
tight, and when Bear guard K.J.
Roberts drilled a three-pointer
with 1:17 left in the game, the
lead was just six. Cal came no
closer however, as Stanford
sank some clutch free throws
down the stretch to hold on to
an important win.
"We really needed a win,"
said Montgomery, whose squad
was seeking to snap a two-game
losing streak. "This was impor
tant to us. With UCLA coming
in Tuesday and coming off the
Arizona trip, this was a crucial
ball game for us against a team
we knew was very capable of
playing some excellent basket
ball."

dling the ball and giving the ball to people," said
Cardinal head coach Mike Montgomery. "He was
penetrating and finding people. He did a great job.
He had the ball in his hands. He knew what he
wanted to do. He didn't force it. He penetrated, he
forced help, he drew, he kicked, and that's what he's
so good at.
"There's other times when he scored more, but
when he had the ball in his hands, you felt real good
'about what was going to happen."
Cal head coach Todd Bozeman was quick to agree
saying, "Almost every basket [Stanford] got came
off of [Knight's] penetration and him opening things
up in the paint."
He and junior forward Darren Allaway were the
offensive show in the first half. Knight and Allaway
led the club with 10 first-half points. Allaway com

the field and 4-of-4 from the
foul line for 14 points.
"Darren did a nice job for
us," Montgomery said. "Allaway
was boarding the ball and doing

a good job for us."
The entire Stanford team
shot well, hitting field goals at a
55.1 percent clip. Conspicuously
absent in the first half, however
was Cardinal guard Dion Cross.
With six-foot-six Bear guard
Jelani Gardner on him, Cross
had just three first-half points.
"Cross just couldn't get a

shot," Montgomery said. "[Call
had Gardner on him some. And
at six-foot-six, they made the
decision to run at him so that
they would really close on Dion
and make him put it on the
floor."
The second half, however,
was an entirely different story
for the Stanford sharpshooter.
With Cal creeping close in the
final period, Cross's 18 second
half points — which gave him a
game-high 18 — were more
than welcome.
"To [Cross's] credit, he ends
up shooting six for eleven which
is much more preferable than
trying to put up seventeen shots
and still making only six shots,"
Montgomery said.
Down by six at halftime, the
Bears hit two quick baskets to
bring them within two. Cal
hung in there for awhile, dan
gerously close to overtaking
Stanford, until swingman David
Harbour scored five straight
points to jump start an 18-4
Cardinal run.
"We came out kind of flat in
the second half," Harbour said.
"But we found it within our
selves to pick up the intensity."
The stellar sixth-man wasn't
even sure if he would be playing
due to a badly sprained ankle.
"During shoot-around,
[Coach Montgomery] himself
put me through some tests,"
Harbour said. "It was a pretty
good sprain. It was up in the air.
I woke up this morning, walked
around. I could run and go
through everything, so there
was no reason that I couldn't
play."
Harbour made quite an
impact with his 13 points off the
bench as well as his defensive
effort against Bear leader
Monty Buckley, who had just
four second-half points.
"Harbour came in and just
did a wonderful job for us,"
Montgomery said. "He picked
up our intensity and got into

Buckley a little bit. We were
having some problems with
Buckley because of our match
ups. We got ourselves into some
problems, but Harbour went in
and did a very nice job."
The Stanford spurt, which
gave the Cardinal its largest
lead at 18 points, was answered
quickly and emphatically by a
Bear barrage of three-point
shooting. Cal nailed five treys
within a four minute span mid
way through the second half,
closing the lead to 11.
"We fell asleep a little bit
when they had the straight
threes that got them back in the
game," Montgomery said.
"They were uncontested, and
that's the one thing we didn't
want — to allow them uncon
tested looks at the basket. They
got free looks. Bang, bang,
bang, they were in the ball
game."
The hot shooting was timely
for Cal who struggled offensive
ly throughout most of the game
making just 35.4 percent of its
field goals. Stanford's defense,
which struggled in the Arizona
desert last week, showed up
strong as evidenced by Bear fab
freshman forward Tremain
Fowlke's awful 2-of-ll shoot
ing.
Nevertheless, Cal still stayed
tight, and when Bear guard K.J.
Roberts drilled a three-pointer
with 1:17 left in the game, the
lead was just six. Cal came no
closer however, as Stanford
sank some clutch free throws
down the stretch to hold on to
an important win.
"We really needed a win,"
said Montgomery, whose squad
was seeking to snap a two-game
losing streak. "This was impor
tant to us. With UCLA coming
in Tuesday and coming off the
Arizona trip, this was a crucial
ball game for us against a team
we knew was very capable of
playing some excellent basket
ball."

Stanford 83
California 70

Axe, schmaxe. The 17th-ranked Cardinal men's
basketball team's 83-70 triumph against California
last night finished off a season sweep over the Bears.
Bay-sketball nowadays means Stanford (16-5 over
all, 7-5 in the Pacific 10 conference).
"It's an important win," said Stanford sopho
more point guard Brevin Knight. "Even after we
beat them the first time, some people still thought
they were better than us. I don't understand that.
It's a boost for us just to show that we are for real."
"It's also real important because we needed to get
a win to stay in the upper half of the Pac-10. We also
needed to get some confidence back where we win
games when we need to win games."
A sold-out Maples Pavilion rocked and rolled in
this 225 th meeting between the two rivals, where
Cardinal dominance over Cal (12-9, 4-8 in the Pac
-10) was the main motif of the match-up. Cal's
largest and only lead during the game was a one
point advantage in the first minute.
Knight set the tempo early on, taking it straight
to and through the gut of the Bear defense. The
sophomore maestro spun some magical music pene
trating at will and either dishing off to a waiting
teammate for the easy lay-in or sinking a smooth
basket.
"I thought I had to go out and assert myself ear
lier in the game," Knight said. "They gave me oppor
tunities to get to the basket. For some reason, they
always want to play me baseline to baseline. I felt
that I had to make them pay, get some points for me
or other people."
He did both. Knight finished with 16 points, 12
assists, five rebounds and two steals.
"Brevin really controlled the game as far as han
dling the ball and giving the ball to people," said
Cardinal head coach Mike Montgomery. "He was
penetrating and finding people. He did a great job.
He had the ball in his hands. He knew what he
