Stanford 83

Axe, schmaxe. The 17th-ranked Cardinal men's
basketball team's 83-70 triumph against California
last night finished off a season sweep over the Bears.
Bay-sketball nowadays means Stanford (16-5 over
all, 7-5 in the Pacific 10 conference).
"It's an important win," said Stanford sopho
more point guard Brevin Knight. "Even after we
beat them the first time, some people still thought
they were better than us. I don't understand that.
It's a boost for us just to show that we are for real."
"It's also real important because we needed to get
a win to stay in the upper half of the Pac-10. We also
needed to get some confidence back where we win
games when we need to win games."
A sold-out Maples Pavilion rocked and rolled in
this 225 th meeting between the two rivals, where
Cardinal dominance over Cal (12-9, 4-8 in the Pac
-10) was the main motif of the match-up. Cal's
largest and only lead during the game was a one
point advantage in the first minute.
Knight set the tempo early on, taking it straight
to and through the gut of the Bear defense. The
sophomore maestro spun some magical music pene
trating at will and either dishing off to a waiting
teammate for the easy lay-in or sinking a smooth
basket.
"I thought I had to go out and assert myself ear
lier in the game," Knight said. "They gave me oppor
tunities to get to the basket. For some reason, they
always want to play me baseline to baseline. I felt
that I had to make them pay, get some points for me
or other people."
He did both. Knight finished with 16 points, 12
assists, five rebounds and two steals.
"Brevin really controlled the game as far as han
dling the ball and giving the ball to people," said
Cardinal head coach Mike Montgomery. "He was
penetrating and finding people. He did a great job.
He had the ball in his hands. He knew what he
wanted to do. He didn't force it. He penetrated, he
forced help, he drew, he kicked, and that's what he's
so good at.
"There's other times when he scored more, but
when he had the ball in his hands, you felt real good
'about what was going to happen."
Cal head coach Todd Bozeman was quick to agree
saying, "Almost every basket [Stanford] got came
off of [Knight's] penetration and him opening things
up in the paint."
He and junior forward Darren Allaway were the
offensive show in the first half. Knight and Allaway
led the club with 10 first-half points. Allaway com
pleted a perfect shooting game, making 3-of-3 from
