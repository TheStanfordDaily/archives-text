# Victory highlighted by the return of stifling team defense
## 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Last night, Stanford managed to do
something neither UCLA nor Arizona was
capable of accomplishing — beating the vis
iting Golden Bears — as the No. 17 Cardinal
topped California 83-70.
The unpredictable Bear squad entered
Maples Pavilion as the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's biggest road warriors, winning seven

of nine this year. However, the Bears ran
into the renewed intensity of a Stanford
defense that was coming off two poor show
ings in Arizona last weekend, including
allowing Arizona State a second-half shoot
ing percentage of 64 percent on Saturday.
Holding Cal to only 35.4 percent shooting
from the field, Stanford's hard-working
man-to-man defense helped stake the Cardi
nal to a double-digit lead in the second half.
After the Bears cut the Stanford halftime

lead of six to just two a minute into the half,
the basket closed up for Cal as they went the
next seven minutes, 38 seconds without
scoring a field goal.
"The first five minutes of the second half
I felt we came out ready and we got it to
within two," said Cal head coach Todd Boze
man. "Then we had six straight possessions
that we didn't score. You just can't do that
against any ball club, it doesn't
matter who it is."
Going with a small lineup,
the Bears brought the game out
to the perimeter in the second
half against the wishes of Stan
ford's head coach Mike Mont
gomery. Using five players 6-
foot-7 or smaller for most of the
half, Cal used its athletic ability
to crash the boards and work
for open three-pointers to fight
back.
"They were having a hard
time scoring, but then we gave
them those three uncontested
threes in a row," said David
Harbour. "We just had to settle
down and pick up the defensive
intensity. I felt in the second
half, we became the aggressor."
Stretching a 32-26 halftime
advantage to a 56-38 lead over
the first 10 minutes of the sec
ond half, the Cardinal was back
to its traditional self, diving for
loose balls and scorching the
nets with 58.3 percent shoot
ing. Cal wouldn't go away, how
ever, as the Bears hit three
uncontested three-pointers to
begin to make it a ball game
again.
Over the course of the game,

Cal was 10-for-24 behind the
three-point arc, including 8-for
-18 in the second half. However,
from two-point territory the
Bears only made 13 of 41 shots
for a less than satisfactory 31.7
shooting percentage.
"The uncontested shots they
took tonight they made," Mont
gomery said. "We had to play a
perimeter game a little bit, and
the threes kept them in the
game."
Seeing its 18-point lead cut
to seven with four and a half
minutes left, Stanford
answered with its own long
range bombing as shooting
guard Dion Cross buried one of
his four three-pointers on the
night. With Harbour limiting
Cal's leading scorer Monty
Buckley to only one shot in sec
ond half, the Bears' luck ran
out as Stanford iced the game at
the free throw line, making
seven of 10 free throws during
the last 1:15.
"We played defense as hard
as we did in practice this week,"
point guard Brevin Knight said.
"Monday and Tuesday were
intense, people wanted to get
back to playing hard defense
and stop people from scoring 80
or 90 points a game because
that's not us. Tonight, whenev
er we played hard defense, they
struggled to get shots."
