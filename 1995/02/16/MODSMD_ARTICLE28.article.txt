# Aggies are no pushovers, despite Divison II standing
## Baseball travels to UC-Davis 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
With less than two weeks
remaining until Pacific 10 Southern
Division (Six-Pac) play begins, the
No. 5 Stanford baseball team is hop
ing to gain a bit of momentum.
The Cardinal (6-4) travels to UC-
Davis today to take on the Aggies (0-
4) in a non-conference match-up
before playing a three-game series
with Santa Clara over the weekend.
"These next few games are pret
ty important for us," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "I hope
that we can continue to improve as
we get closer to league play."
After manhandling Cal State-
Los Angeles earlier this week, the
Cardinal hopes to top another Divi
sion II squad in Davis this afternoon
at 2 p.m. But the Aggies — who fin
ished 1994 with a 47-12 record —
are a far cry from the Cal State-L A
Golden Eagles.
UC-Davis returns three .300 hit
ters and four starting pitchers from
last year's squad, which compiled a
32-3 record in league play and wtie

ranked as high as second in the
nation in Division 11. But the Aggies
have also lost several key players,
mostly to the professional ranks,
from a team which dominated the
Northern California Athletic Con
ference (NCAC) with a 62-8 record
since 1993.
Five standout performers at UC-
Davis last season were taken in the
June amateur draft, including
1994's NCAC Player of the Year,
Jason Shapiro. The Aggies abo lost
two Ail-American performers in
catcher Rich Watts and pitcher
Matt Pool to the Pirates and Rock
ies respectively.
"UC-Davis had a great team last
year," Marquess said. "They had
five guys taken in the draft and that
really says something. I really don't
know much about them this sea
son."
That's because the 1995 Aggies
have been an enigma. UC-Davis is
still loaded with talent, but they've
opened the season with a sweep at
the hands of UC-Riverside before
losing to Cal State-San Bernadino
to drop to 0-4.

The Aggies are led by a powerful
duo of first baseman Sanjay Shar
ma and outfielder Dave Nix, who
each hit over .300 in 1994. Sharma
carries a hefty .429 batting average
into this afternoon's contest and
has already belted two home runs
this season. Nix has also picked up
right where he left off in 1994, hit
ting .375 over his first four games.
But UC-Davis has also had it's
share of disappointments in the
young season. Designated hitter
Chris Walsh — who hit .306 with
four home runs a year ago — has
been in a season-long slump, carry
ing a meager .133 batting average
into today's game.
Pitching figured to be the Aggies
strength heading into the year with
three All-Conference performers
returning. But UC-Davis has given
up an average of over nine runs a
game while opposing batters have
hit at a .320 clip. Right-hander Mike
Prelock leads the list of returning
pitchers after compiling a 9-2 mark
in 1994. Colby Craig, also a right
hander, posted a 1.94 earned
run average and an 11-1 record
last season.
The Cardinal — which is in
the middle of a nine-game, 12-
day stretch — will probably use

a committee of pitchers this
afternoon. Right-hander Mario
Iglesias, junior Todd Bartels
and sophomore Brendon Sulli
van are all expected to see
action. Iglesias, a junior, picked
up his first win in nearly two
years last week against Sacra
mento State.
"I really have no idea what to
expect from UC-Davis," Iglesias

said. "We had a lot of trouble
against non-Six Pac teams last
year and we're trying to change
that. A win [today] would be big
because it would give us a three
game win streak heading into
Santa Clara."
And with conference play in
the not-so-distant future, the
Cardinal will look to build any
momentum it can.
