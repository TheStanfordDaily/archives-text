A Stanford development officer currently faces
criminal charges for obstructing justice and de
frauding the Cambridge, Mass., Rent Control
Board, The Harvard Crimson reported.
Keith Light, a former senior admissions officer
at Harvard University, was hired by Stanford six
weeks ago to work on the Stanford Fund, according
to Assoc. Vice President of Development Stephen
Peeps.
Light said he was not aware of the exact charges
against him and is having his lawyer look into the
matter.
"What... is absolutely ridiculous is all the sug
gestions that I did anything wrong," Light told The
Daily.
According to The Crimson, rent control officials
said Light and Daniel Harrop, both alumni of
Sigma Chi fraternity, tricked a board inspector
into believing that they lived in a two-bedroom
house at 14 Mt. Auburn St.in Cambridge. The
house was actually rented to members of the Har
vard branch of the Sigma Chi fraternity, the paper
reported.
In addition to accusations of lying about living
in the house, Harrop was found to have evicted two
Harvard undergraduates in order to house two fra
ternity members, The Crimson reported. Under
Massachusetts state law, evicting tenants is legal
only if owners live on the property.
Doina Contescu, one of the two students who
was evicted, told The Daily she believes Light was
involved. She said she is suing Harrop, Light, the
Sigma Chi national organization and two Sigma
Chi members for more than $100,000 in "actual
and emotional damages" in a trial to be held this
