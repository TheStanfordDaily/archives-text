### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
A Stanford development officer currently faces
criminal charges for obstructing justice and de
frauding the Cambridge, Mass., Rent Control
Board, The Harvard Crimson reported.
Keith Light, a former senior admissions officer
at Harvard University, was hired by Stanford six
weeks ago to work on the Stanford Fund, according
to Assoc. Vice President of Development Stephen
Peeps.
Light said he was not aware of the exact charges
against him and is having his lawyer look into the
matter.
"What... is absolutely ridiculous is all the sug
gestions that I did anything wrong," Light told The
Daily.
According to The Crimson, rent control officials
said Light and Daniel Harrop, both alumni of
Sigma Chi fraternity, tricked a board inspector
into believing that they lived in a two-bedroom
house at 14 Mt. Auburn St.in Cambridge. The
house was actually rented to members of the Har
vard branch of the Sigma Chi fraternity, the paper
reported.
In addition to accusations of lying about living
in the house, Harrop was found to have evicted two
Harvard undergraduates in order to house two fra
ternity members, The Crimson reported. Under
Massachusetts state law, evicting tenants is legal
only if owners live on the property.
Doina Contescu, one of the two students who
was evicted, told The Daily she believes Light was
involved. She said she is suing Harrop, Light, the
Sigma Chi national organization and two Sigma
Chi members for more than $100,000 in "actual
and emotional damages" in a trial to be held this
August.
Stanford Fund Director Nancy
Wells, who hired Light, said he
passed a standard background
check. "There was nothing irreg
ular about the hiring process,"
Wells said.
Wells said she was not aware of
any criminal charges against
Light.
She added that she is "not

planning on doing anything dras
tic." However, she plans to con
tact Light and collect more infor
mation, including his side of the
charges.
The Crimson reported that
Light was charged with providing
false testimony last April to the
Cambridge rent board, an offense
covered in Section 12C of the
Massachusetts Rent Control Act
of 1976. Light also failed to
appear before a criminal hearing
in Cambridge late last year, The
Crimson added.
Light denied the charges.

"I didn't get any notice for the
hearing ... to this moment I
don't know what it was all
about," Light said. "I have never
appeared before the rent control
board."
The Crimson reported that
Patricia Cantor, the rent board's
general counsel, said the board
has applied for a criminal com
plaint against Light because he
defaulted the hearings.
Cantor, according to The
Crimson, said that since Light
has moved, "he is not in our juris
diction. There's a good chance if

he stays in California, he will
avoid enforcement in Mas
sachusetts."
Massachusetts rent-control
offenses are not extraditable, she
added.
Light is now in Cambridge,
however, to help select Harvard's
next freshman class.
According to The Crimson,
Cambridge police have said that if
Light is apprehended in Mas
sachusetts he will be forced to
account for his default on the
hearings and face the rent
board's criminal charges.
