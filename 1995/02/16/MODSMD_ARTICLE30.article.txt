# Stanford's gymnasts leap into action this weekend
## Men to battle Golden Bears 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
Any time Stanford battles Cal,
one can expect a little extra effort
from both teams. With all that faces
them this weekend, the fourth
ranked Cardinal gymnasts are defi
nitely going to need it.
The men's gymnastics team
travels to Berkeley on Saturday to
compete in an optionais-only tri
meet against UC-Santa Barbara
and host California And with the
recent rise of the sixth-ranked Gold
en Bears, Stanford looks to have its
hands full.
As if a rumble against a top-10
opponent wasn't enough, Stanford
should be competing in front of a
full house as Cal commemorates the
20th anniversary of its 1975 NCAA
championship team.
"They should have a lot of fan
support this weekend.", said Cardi
nal head coach Sadao Hamada "It
will definitely make things more dif
ficult for us."
After a two-week break, the team
is infinitely more prepared for this
meet than its last. While the Cardi
nal won the dual meet at San Jose
State convincingly, the performance
was better left forgotten. Plagued
with fatigue and inconsistency,
Stanford turned in a less than stel
lar effort which left most of the
gymnasts dissatisfied.
"I feel a lot better about the
upcoming meet," said sophomore
Keith Wiley. "We've gotten a chance
to rest some and just work a little bit
more on our routines. We're defi

nitely looking more consistent."
This weekend should provide the
Cardinal with its first opportunity
to completely showcase its talent.
With many gymnasts concentrating
on Winter Nationals or recovering
from injuries, every weekend has
had one gymnast or another unable
to compete.
"This will be the first time this
season that we have most of our
best gymnasts competing," Hama
da said. "Only two of our gymnasts
will be out."
Junior Andrew Manson and
senior Jason Cohen have been out
since the dual meet at San Jose
State. Cohen has been hampered by
a sore back and will rest for this
meet. Manson tore ligaments in his

right knee warming up two weeks
ago and is expected to be out the rest
of the season.
Another scary injury for the
Cardinal occurred last week when
freshman specialist Clarence Miao
slipped on a parallel bar routine and
grazed his ear, causing cartilage
damage that required eight stitch
es. However, after a week of recov
eiy, he will resume training today
and hopes to be ready by this week
end.
"I wasn't supposed to be upside
down (due to problems with bal
ance) for a week so I haven't been
able to practice, but from my perfor
mance in the last meet, I feel like I'll
be ready to compete against Cal,"
said Miao.
