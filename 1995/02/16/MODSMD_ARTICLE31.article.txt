# Hoping to be Indoor champ

One week after Michael Johnson blazed the boards
for a world record in the 400 meters, the Stanford team
hopes to scorch the same Reno track en route to a team
indoor championship.
Last year the men's track team finished third and
the women fifth at the Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation Indoor Championships; this Saturday they aim to
bring home the coveted team trophy. The Champi
onships are the indoor showcase for most of the Pacific
10 Conference and Big West teams.
"It's an important championship meet and the ath
letes are prepared to score as many points as they can,"
said head coach Vin Lananna.
However, the real prize of this indoor season will
come at Notre Dame Feb. 25 when the Cardinal gets an
opportunity to run against some of the best national
competition.
"The Notre Dame meet will be a culmination of the
indoor season and an opportunity to qualify some of
our athletes for the Pac-10 [outdoor] Championships,"
said Lananna.
Notre Dame boasts a large 355-yard indoor track,
compared to the 200-meter banked track at the Reno
Livestock Events Center. Times should be faster at
Notre Dame with the wider curves and national caliber
competition.
At the MPSF Indoor Championships, head coach
Lananna will enter runners in all the events from
sprints to distance, but he will have to do so without
several of his key performers. Outstanding freshmen
distance runners Sarna Renfro and Kortney Dun
scombe will be competing at the World Junior Cross
Country Trials in Birmingham, Ala., as they aim to join
their freshmen teammates Nathan Nutter and Matt
Farley on the Lananna-coached U.S. team.
In addition to the loss of a strong part of the
women's distance team, Lananna must enter a men's
team that lacks the injured All-American junior Ren6
Rodriguez and senior Pac-10 champion decathlete
Travis Clark. The strength of the men's team remains
