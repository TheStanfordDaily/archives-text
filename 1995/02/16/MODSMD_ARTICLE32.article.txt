# Women deal with injuries
## 
### Ben Hur Contributing writer 
Injuries are an unfortunate part
of sports, and it seems that mis
fortune has plagued the Stanford
women's gymnastics team.
The worn down Stanford gym
nasts will try to tame the Wildcats
of Arizona at 7:30 p.m. Friday
evening at Burnham Pavilion. The
Cardinal will attempt to extend its
home winning streak, having yet to
suffer a loss on the Farm this sea
son.
Stanford will have its hands full
though, considering that it has
never beaten Arizona at home.
"They will definitely be a chal
lenge," said senior Meegan Lannin.
"I think it will be exciting for us."
As if the Wildcats weren't
enough of a problem, the Cardinal
will also be battling a rash of unfor
tunate injuries. First and foremost
on the minds of the gymnasts is
the health of sophomore all
arounder Katie Jennings. She was
hospitalized Tuesday evening
because of feelings of sickness.
Doctors have performed numerous
tests, but the cause of the illness
remains unknown.
"Everyone is concerned," said
senior co-captain Katie Clancy.
"She is our friend and our team
mate, and we want her to get bet
ter. When I visited her, she was
joking around and in good spirits,
the way she usually is."
Before her recent illness, Jen
nings also struggled with a bulging
disk in her back and other nagging
injuries. Despite all these prob
lems, there exists little doubt that

she will return in full force.
"If there is anyone who can
come back from something like
this, it's Katie," said senior co-cap
tain Jen§ Elzie. "She is pretty
resilient."
Nearly every member of the
squad has suffered injuries that
have limited her ability to compete.
Freshman Kristie Jones has yet to
compete on the vault due to a
stress fracture in her back, while
Lannin has been bothered by a
stress fracture in her foot. Junior
Linda Chun has struggled with a
hand injury, and freshman Amy
Neil is out for the year with a torn
anterior cruciate ligament.
All this translates into slow
progress, as the wounded gym

nasts are unable to effectively add
new skills.
"The thing that is going to hurt
us, if anything, is our health," said
head coach Breck Greenwood.
Overall, the team has practiced
well this week and appears ready to
take on Arizona. The squad has
focused on consistency, working
under pressure situations, and its
aggressiveness. Stanford looked
tentative at the beginning of last
Friday's meet against Oregon
State, and that is something it is
anxious to change.
"It should be a fun meet to
watch," said freshman Keri Mona
han. "We've never beaten Arizona
at home, but there is always a first
time for everything."
