# Golden State board games

### 
I have a game called Jenga — maybe you know
what I'm talking about. It's this tower of
stacked, criss-crossed wooden pieces, and you
have to remove a piece from the middle and put it on
top. The structure gets weaker and weaker as pieces
are taken out and eventually the tower crashes
down and you have to build it up again to start the
game over.
For the Golden State Warriors, the removal of
head coach Don Nelson Monday was that last piece
that ended the game. Building it up again won't be
as easy as re-stacking the Jenga structure.
As Nelson stepped aside from the rubble that has
been the Warriors' season, he insisted on taking
blame for his team's performance. "Don't judge this
team on this year," he said. "I'll take responsibility
for that. I have been doing a lousy job. I deserve to
be replaced."
But this saga, which has been the Sporting
Green's top story for the last five days, began before
the start of this year's campaign. In fact, it might be
said that a great deal of the trouble began when Nel
son, who is also Golden State's general manager,
traded the No. 3 pick in the draft, Anfernee Hard
away, and three future No. 1 picks to the Orlando
Magic on draft day 1993 in exchange for the No. 1
pick, Chris Webber.
It seems that here began a clash between a 21-
year-old rookie, entering the NBA after just two
years in college, and a veteran of 30 years as a play
er and coach. Should either one have given in to the
other? Webber was unhappy playing for Nelson, and
the situation became public in a shouting match in
Charlotte one year and one week ago today.
What a difference a year makes.
Today both are gone — Webber traded to the
Washington Bullets for forward Tom Gugliotta and
Nelson taking some time off which will probably
serve his personal health well.
What remains is a team of players who have
missed out on a chance for something special, a legit
imate shot at the NBA title, on account of this dis
play of stubbornness. The pieces were finally all
there — but what was missing was patience.
I don't know exactly what went on between Web
ber and Nelson. I wasn't at practices, team meetings

or games. Perhaps Webber was treated in a down
right despicable manner. Yes, it is extremely chal
lenging to perform well and keep your head up play
ing for a coach whom you feel doesn't respect you.
But you have to adapt — perseverance may have
paid off in this case.
But included in Webber's 15-year, $74 million
dollar contract was a one-year escape clause which
Nelson worked in to allow the Warriors to get
around the salary cap. Webber took the clause and
ran. Where are you now, Chris?

In Washington, where Webber insists that he will
stay and bring the Bullets an NBA championship.
He insists he is happy to be away from Nelson and
the Bay Area, but now Webber must wait, be
patient, while the tower of pieces is reassembled in
Washington. It was built and ready to stand tall at
Golden State.
The Warriors even acquired a true center, Rony
Seikaly, from the Miami Heat, although they traded
Webber's best friend on the team, Billy Owens, to
get him. Some say it was a message to Webber, who
was unsigned at the time. But the Warriors were so
close to having it all — it was a move that made busi
ness sense in the NBA.
What do the veterans think? What did they do?
Neither Chris Mullin nor Tim Hardaway spoke out
on the situation, but you get the feeling that they
didn't make their veteran presence felt as much as
they could have in order to keep their team together
and pointed toward the goal of an NBA champi-
