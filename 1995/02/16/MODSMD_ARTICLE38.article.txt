# What, you guys don't like Ad Lib?
## Aïda Croal Sapphites on Screen 
### 
If you're Drew Barrymore, you can flirt
with it. If you're Whoopi Goldberg, you
can get away with doing it twice. And if
you happen to be Glenn Close, well then hey,
you should have no problem. What am I re
ferring to? Women acting gay in the '90s.
If in 1992 we got our green tomatoes fried
and in 1994 we were given explicit instruc
tions on how to "Go Fish," 1995 has mass
media lesbians showing all kinds of grace
under fire.
In "Higher Learning," John Singleton
took a surprising time-out in the middle of a
budding campus war to allow Kristen (Kristy
Swanson) "explore" her sexuality with
(gasp!) a member of her own sex. After she is
raped during a fraternity party, new friend
Taryn (Jennifer Connelly) and a curious
band of long-haired "feminists" are right

there to ease the pain.
No sooner than you can shout "dyke!"
across a darkened theater, Kristen and Taryn
are strolling about campus holding hands,
picnicking in the shade and putting up
posters together. You've got to wonder why
Kristen has to be raped in order for her to be
attracted to a woman, but then again let's give
John the benefit of the doubt. He may not
have meant it that way.
Even though a random "boyfriend" sud
denly slips into the picture when it's time for
Kristen and Taryn to do the do, and the ques
tion of Kristen's sexuality is eventually
dropped altogether, Singleton still deserves
an A for effort. Judging by the theater-wide
giggling and groans that greeted the Sapphic
sex scene, audience members couldn't have
handled more than what little they saw.

Heterosexual sensibilities are left unruffled,
however, in "Boys on the Side," the next of this
year's lesbo-themed flicks. Boys are clearly not
relegated to the side when Holly (Drew Barry
more) and Robin (Mary Louise Parks), the
two straight characters, are permitted multi
ple romps in the hay while Jane (Whoopi
Goldberg), self-acclaimed lesbo, goes without.
Talk about speech acts. The moment Jane
utters the fateftil self-declaration, gone are
any visible signs of passion or sexuality. In
stead, Jane is doomed to an unrequited
yearning for the "whitest woman on the face
of the earth."
But then again, this should not come as a
surprise. The mainstream media's rule of
thumb for these matters seems to be this: If
they say they're gay, they'll get no play. Apply
it to anything from "Philadelphia" to "Mel
rose Place," you'll find little disagreement.
Luckily for us, a controversial TV movie—
"Serving in Silence," the Margarethe Cam

mermeyer story — comes out like a trooper
Starring Glenn Close as Cammermeyer, the
most highly decorated military officer to bt
discharged for being gay, and Judy Davis as
her lover, this movie clearly depicts both the
passion and the power of a few good women.
Barbara Streisand, multi-talented per
former and outspoken gay-rights advocate,
acquired the rights for the story and pro
duced the movie with Close. Streisand, who
collaborated with Cammermeyer herself,
Close and Davis never once dilute their vi
sion. The development of the on-screen ro
mance between the two lovers is compelling
and sexy and, while Close and Davis share a
tender ten-second kiss at the end, it is hardly
the erotic highlight of the movie.
This is not the last we can expect to see ol
these media creations. In fact, be on the look
out for the new film "The Incredible Adven
tures of Two Girls In Love." You can nevei
have too much of a good thing. ■
