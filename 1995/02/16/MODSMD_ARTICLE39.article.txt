## Scene 
### John Chang-Eun Cha Photos by Matt Garlinghouse 
A hot feeling spread about the sticky
wicked room that quickly crowded in antici
pation of that tensome of cold smokin'
funkmeisters known as Fez. Wide eyes met in
mutual understanding — all were prepared
to funk out. As the party animals trickled in
and filled the room with the pent-up energy
of a hard week, an infectious urge to dance
overtook them.
The tension mounted as the groove mas
ters took their places on stage and mesmer
ized the crowd with their awesome presence.
Brass instruments sparkled in the hands of
keen players who gave them a preliminary
run. The bassist gave his length of string a
good whack with his thumb, and the beard
ed drummer adjusted the purple velvet of his
hat. The vocalists gave the shirtless key
boardist and conga player a look of readi
ness, while the guitarist tested out his seduc
tive wah pedal.
After a final tweaking of their instru
ments, the band screamed out a slinky in
strumental, sending the crowd into groovy
gyrations. The horns shouted fire; the
drums, congas, and bass thumped out earthy
satisfaction; the guitar chopped and wahed
tense anticipation; the vocals rolled out sex,
and the keyboard slid it all into your brain.
This is the jamming experience of Fez, a
tensome consisting of Tami Jones and Brad
Jacobson (vocals), Clay Kunz (bass), Hugh
Kojima (trumpet), Devin Parry (trombone),
Sean Fomer (drums), Seth Spalding (sax),
Drew Turitz (guitar), Dave Vann (congas)
and Mike Oristian (keyboard). Congealing
the musical mastery of ten musicians into
one cohesive funk band is no easy feat. Prac
ticed at accommodating differences of opin
ion, Mike grinned as 1 tried to get the band to
come to a consensus on their history.
The evolution of Fez
Founded in 1991 as a five-member fresh
man band, Fez went through a pivotal
change the following year with the addition
of a horn section. Then known as River Bot
tom Groove, the group began down the road
to its current funkdom with the addition of
Tami Jones, who is "all the woman Fez
needs." Fez met with more changes in 1993 as
some of the members went overseas, creating
the need for Matt Johnson to take over guitar.
With the return of the original members, the
band decided to reform with the addition of
Seth and Mike.
Now, the ten-member Fez shares its funk
wisdom all over campus at Friday frat fren-

zies. They do justice to
cover tunes from Aver
age White Band, P-
Funk, Prince, Stevie
Wonder, Brand New
Heavies, Jackson Five

and Chucklehead. In their various originals,
their care-free, instantly understandable
spirit can be heard, successfully recapturing
the soul and feeling of the seventies funk,
soul, and Motown sound. A crowd favorite is
"Party-Time, 'Get

Nekkid'," a veritable
funk explosion in your
mind, soul and limbs.
As Seth the "jazz mas
ter" puts it, "Fez is a
funk-virus spreading
all over campus."
Who are Fez?
After their powerful
show at The taXi last
Friday, I decided to get
the low down. In the
get-it-together depart
ment, Hugh calls him
self the "funk guru, Dr.
Funkenstein." Clad in a
black vest, black slacks,

and a white long-sleeved shirt, Hugh adds a
touch of style to the band. Asked about sex,
drugs and rock 'n' roll, Seth replied, in jest,
"Hugh loves a good healthy mix: sex, drugs,
and funk."

His counterparts in
the horn section are as
different from him as
jellyfish from jelly
beans. Jazz master Seth
is most laid back and
has a witty sense of
humor masked by a
charming poker face.
Devin is a funky cat
who makes trumpet
playing a science and
lives life in good time.
Not only does Devin
play a good horn, he
also aspires to be a biol
ogist.
On the more prag
matic side, Drew —
"who never misses a
fret" — keeps the band
flowing. Sean, who calls
himself "the adminis-

trative manager, with
the tools of whip and
phone," is actually a
happy soul who lifts
the band both on his
drums and with his
personality. "When
Sean smiles the band
smiles. When he's
down the band is
down," Seth noted.
Mike, a cheerful,
perpetually shirtless
figure, likes to describe
himself as "the energy
locus." According to
Seth, the band's fervor
can be gauged on the
basis of how much sur
face area of his chest is
showing: "If he's not
naked we're not having
a good night."
On the esoteric
side, there's Dave —
"conga player and spir
itual leader" — who
nives the band a de-

fined artistic image with his long hair, shirt
less physique and quiet demeanor. Brad, "the
superhero of funk," and Tami, "the funky
diva," create a dynamic which works well.
"I am ivory, and she's ebony. We are the

Yin and yang," Brad ex
plains. Together, they
belt out the soul in gen
uine funk fashion.
Last, but not least
is Clay, "the groove an
chor," who cheerfully
keeps to himself while
pondering the next
note some far off place
in his head — "in bass
land."
In this current
glut of spiritless and
sterile music that relies
so much on raw anger
and undirected energy,
Fez infuses its music
with hope. Alternative
music took an about-

face to popular music, but as it happened, al
ternative became the "popular alternative."
Alternative missed the universal groove of
James Brown, P-Funk and Sly and the Fami

ly Stone. Fez brings back to the Stanford
scene that universal groove characteristic of
the timeless musical wonder of funk.
"It is the best music to dance to. Funk is
just the best. It's musically very interesting
and has a great vibe; it's fun," Seth says as we
listen to Incognito on the radio. "If you want
to put us in a genre, we're a cross between
James Brown and the Charlie Hunter Trio."
A sweet mix indeed.
Play that funky music
The current college music scene sees a re
turn to good-feeling, rump-shaking '60s and
'70s tunes. These vibes were about happy
hour, feeling cool, putting your worries in
the back seat of a car headed for the cosmic
global village. This resurgence of funk, soul,
rhythm and blues and Motown perhaps re
sults from an overload of negativity in
today's popular and alternative music. Music
shapes the mood, and often reflects the emo
tional status of society.
Fez wants to expand the spirituality of
funk around the whole Bay Area. Its mem
bers are now in the process of recording their
originals and expanding their fan base to in
clude clubs and other campuses, such as
Berkeley.
Although Fez doesn't care much for
money — music is the cause its members be
lieve in — they wouldn't mind a Japanese
contract or two. "In fact," Seth states, "Our
mission is to play next year in Japan." With a
glimmer of determination in his eye, Drew
also adds that he wants to meet Ed McMa
hon.
Hopefully, Fez will clear the obstacles that
block the path to these lofty aspirations. As
the only exclusively funk band that calls
Stanford home, Fez accepts the role of fa
vorite party band. It would be encouraging
to find a band as sincere as Fez become suc
cessful, since many bands with talent lose out
in the race to groups with big money backing
them.
Fez is coming to a frat/club/school near
you, so batten down the hatches and get out
your funky duds, because you won't want to
miss the festivities. Why reminisce and rec
ollect about the good music when Fez plays
it? Don't forget the funk, and shake it but
don't break it, because in the lyrical
funkistry of Fez, "it's out of sight, it's out of
site, it's out of sight, it's cool." Maybe gramps
will even turn up at one of the gigs to show
us where it's at. ■
