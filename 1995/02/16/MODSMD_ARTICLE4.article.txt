Student groups will now have the option of either
working for the Stanford Fund or soliciting funds under
the auspices of the Office of Development, if the propos
al of the Stanford Fund task force is approved by Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice.
Released yesterday, the report is the result of a com
mission created in November in response to student up
roar over a proposed alumni-giving policy limiting stu
dent groups' ability to raise alumni funds.
The policy must now go to the ASSU for endorsement

income for a maximum net income of $11,250.

ate senator Stephen Russell. "By any account, it's more
than sufficient."
Russell admitted, however, that in time more money

might be required. "Down the road, it may create such a
benefit that it may need to be expanded," he said.
Vanessa Alvarado, committee co-chair and Council of
Presidents member, said that if this happens, the
amount of money allocated will probably increase.
The second option for student organizations is to re
quest money from corporations, alumni and non-alumni
through direct mail and phone solicitation under the su
pervision of the Office of Development.
Groups who opted for this choice, however, would be
required to do their fundraising inside the Office of De
