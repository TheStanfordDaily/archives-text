# Stanford Fund proposal offers two new options
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Brian Singer Contributing writers 
Student groups will now have the option of either
working for the Stanford Fund or soliciting funds under
the auspices of the Office of Development, if the propos
al of the Stanford Fund task force is approved by Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice.
Released yesterday, the report is the result of a com
mission created in November in response to student up
roar over a proposed alumni-giving policy limiting stu
dent groups' ability to raise alumni funds.
The policy must now go to the ASSU for endorsement
and then to the Offices of the President and Provost,
where the final say rests with Casper, said Director of
Student Activities Nanci Howe. If approved, the policy
will become effective Sept. 1,1995, she added.
Working partnerships
The new policy allows two choices for student groups
to raise money. First, the proposal creates a pool of
$150,000 to be paid to members of student organizations
who do work for the Stanford Fund.
Students will be paid $20 an hour, with a minimum
group commitment of 25 hours and a maximum group
commitment of 375 hours. Any group which fulfills its
commitment will receive an additional 50% of their base
income for a maximum net income of $11,250.
"It should be more than enough money to meet stu
dents' needs," said task force member and undergradu
ate senator Stephen Russell. "By any account, it's more
than sufficient."
Russell admitted, however, that in time more money

might be required. "Down the road, it may create such a
benefit that it may need to be expanded," he said.
Vanessa Alvarado, committee co-chair and Council of
Presidents member, said that if this happens, the
amount of money allocated will probably increase.
The second option for student organizations is to re
quest money from corporations, alumni and non-alumni
through direct mail and phone solicitation under the su
pervision of the Office of Development.
Groups who opted for this choice, however, would be
required to do their fundraising inside the Office of De
velopment's facilities. All donations also must be
processed through the development
office.
Howe said that she thought this
requirement would improve stu
dent organizations' fundraising
efforts.
"For most student organiza
tions, this would be an asset," Howe
said. "[Stanford Fund] has facilities
available which would be better
than using a dorm phone. It's an
enhancement, not a detriment."
The Office of Development could
do gift processing, provide labels
and do other services for student
groups, Alvarado said. This would
be especially important for "student
groups that don't have as many
resources," she added.
"The Office of Development will
[also] actively assist student organi
zations with professional consulting
using the University database and
the Gift Processing Office," said
Michael Choo, committee member
and deputy senate chair.
Since student groups ask for
funds in Stanford's name, the Uni
versity should have some control,
Russell said.
"When soliciting in the Universi
ty's name, it's important to do it
right," he said. "Also [student

groups] will not have to worry about
the intricacies of the tax code."
A new tax law enacted Jan. 1
requires that receipts be issued to
anyone who donates to an organiza
tion.
Student groups would also be
subject to other restrictions. They
will be limited to five unsuccessful
solicitations of any alumnus, after
which the person would become
ineligible for solicitation.
"There's no five-year limit [for
fund raising], so hopefully people
will be able to work within five solic
itations," Choo said.
A portion of the original Sept. 1
Stanford Fund policy prevented
student groups from soliciting
funds from alumni who had not
donated to that particular organiza
tion in the previous five years.
Another restriction contained in
the new proposal mandates that
student groups can only solicit
alumni funds between Feb. 1 and
July 1.
The time frame was added to
prevent competition between the
University and student organiza
tions, Russell said.
"This exists to benefit both
groups and to prevent them from
competing with each other," he
said. "There has always been a
fund-raising window. This one is
larger."
Alvarado said student groups

could still solicit funds from "corpo
rations, foundations, non-alumni
and friends" throughout the entire
year.
Such a time frame will lead to
more successful fund raising by
allowing groups to develop their
strategies more thoroughly, Howe
said.
"Conceivably, they can spend fall
quarter coming up with a budget
and do fund raising in the spring,"
she said. "They will be more suc
cessful in the long term."
The time frame could cause
problems, said Nancy Wells, direc
tor of the Stanford Fund. "There
may be a situation when a group
wants to solicit alumni in Decem
ber," she said.
Exemptions available
Organizations who do not wish
to be bound by the new policy can
file for an exemption through Howe
and Director of Student Develop
ment Brian Perronne — who would
grant exemptions on a case-by-case
basis.
"They are willing to consider any
kind of request made on a reason
able basis," Choo said.
"Organizations that have a spe
cific target group, that have a histo
ry of working with alumni, who
know what they are doing, who
want to process their own gifts, and

will follow IRS tax laws will be the
ones most likely to be exempted,"
Alvarado said.
Russell named The Stanford
Review, The Daily, fraternities and
the Graduate Student Association
as groups likely to gain exemptions.
Michael Meyer, editor in chief of
the Review, said his organization
will secure an exemption because
"there is a very strong and consis
tent contribution list. . . . The
Review is obviously going to satisfy
thus condition."
The Review receives its entire
funding from alumni, he added.
The proi>osul process
In order to qualify for any fund-rais
ing options or be exempted from the
plan, student groups must submit a
proposal which details their
fundraising goals to the Office of
Student Activities. The Office of
Development must also endorse the
plan.
Afler the approval process, stu
dent groups will become Recognized
Student Organizations (RSOs), the
proposal states.
"It will be easy for a group that is
focused and knows what it wants to
do with the money Ito get
approved]," Alvarado said. "A group
can't fund raise just because they
want to party all year."
The proposal process also helps

groups clearly define their goals and
plans making fund raising more
successful, Howe said.
"We want to make sure that they
have thought through the activity
well enough," she said. "Sometimes
the budget is much too large or they
have forgotten important elements.
To earn money is fairly simple if
they are organized and have a clear
sense of what they are doing."
If student groups do not abide by
the policy, sanctions will be
imposed, Choo said.
"If they do not follow the policy
guidelines, then they will face disci
plinary action — up to the revoca
tion of voluntary student organiza
tion status," Choo said.
The proposal will serve student
groups' needs well, Russell said.
"By all accounts, the recom
mendations are a tremendous suc
cess," Russell said. "There is a
place within the policy for all dif
ferent types of student groups —
Stanford in Government, the Men
dicants, The Stanford Daily — I
can't think of one group that will
not be happy with or benefit from
[the proposal]. Groups will have
opportunities that they never had
before."
Wells agreed: "I don't think
either one of us felt like we compro
mised anything. We got a policy that
meets both student and Stanford
University needs."

The task force effort could serve
as a model for future student
administration cooperation, Choo
said.
"This is an excellent example of
student leaders and the administra
tion working together on the behalf
of student and University inter
ests," Choo said. "This policy works
to benefit all student interests, be it
members of a capella groups, frater
nities or community service organi
zations."
Approval expected
Senate chair Nawwar Kasrawi
said he was fairly certain that the
ASSU would endorse the proposal.
The broad composition of the stu
dents on the committee, who all
support the proposal, was a positive
sign that it would be approved, he
added.
The proposal will also probably
be approved on the administrative
end, Wells said.
"[Casper 1 has obviously been
aware how the group has been pro
ceeding," she said. "He's taken a
very keen interest in how the work
ing group progressed. He's veiy
excited about the creativity of these
recommendations."
Provost Condoleezza I lice said
that she hoped to have a decision in
a week. "All that I'm hearing is very
positive about the process. We will
take it very seriously," she said.
Student groups will now have the option of either
working for the Stanford Fund or soliciting funds under

may be a situation when a group
wants to solicit alumni in Decem
ber," she said.
Exemptions available
Organizations who do not wish
to be bound by the new policy can
file for an exemption through Howe
and Director of Student Develop
ment Brian Perronne — who would
grant exemptions on a case-by-case
basis.
"They are willing to consider any
kind of request made on a reason
able basis," Choo said.
"Organizations that have a spe
cific target group, that have a histo
ry of working with alumni, who
know what they are doing, who
want to process their own gifts, and

will follow IRS tax laws will be the
ones most likely to be exempted,"
Alvarado said.
Russell named The Stanford
Review, The Daily, fraternities and
the Graduate Student Association
as groups likely to gain exemptions.
Michael Meyer, editor in chief of
the Review, said his organization
will secure an exemption because
"there is a very strong and consis
tent contribution list. . . . The
Review is obviously going to satisfy
thus condition."
The Review receives its entire
funding from alumni, he added.
The proi>osul process
In order to qualify for any fund-rais
ing options or be exempted from the
plan, student groups must submit a
proposal which details their
fundraising goals to the Office of
Student Activities. The Office of
Development must also endorse the
plan.
Afler the approval process, stu
dent groups will become Recognized
Student Organizations (RSOs), the
proposal states.
"It will be easy for a group that is
focused and knows what it wants to
do with the money Ito get
approved]," Alvarado said. "A group
can't fund raise just because they
want to party all year."
The proposal process also helps

groups clearly define their goals and
plans making fund raising more
successful, Howe said.
"We want to make sure that they
have thought through the activity
well enough," she said. "Sometimes
the budget is much too large or they
have forgotten important elements.
To earn money is fairly simple if
they are organized and have a clear
sense of what they are doing."
If student groups do not abide by
the policy, sanctions will be
imposed, Choo said.
"If they do not follow the policy
guidelines, then they will face disci
plinary action — up to the revoca
tion of voluntary student organiza
tion status," Choo said.
The proposal will serve student
groups' needs well, Russell said.
"By all accounts, the recom
mendations are a tremendous suc
cess," Russell said. "There is a
place within the policy for all dif
ferent types of student groups —
Stanford in Government, the Men
dicants, The Stanford Daily — I
can't think of one group that will
not be happy with or benefit from
[the proposal]. Groups will have
opportunities that they never had
before."
Wells agreed: "I don't think
either one of us felt like we compro
mised anything. We got a policy that
meets both student and Stanford
University needs."

The task force effort could serve
as a model for future student
administration cooperation, Choo
said.
"This is an excellent example of
student leaders and the administra
tion working together on the behalf
of student and University inter
ests," Choo said. "This policy works
to benefit all student interests, be it
members of a capella groups, frater
nities or community service organi
zations."
Approval expected
Senate chair Nawwar Kasrawi
said he was fairly certain that the
ASSU would endorse the proposal.
The broad composition of the stu
dents on the committee, who all
support the proposal, was a positive
sign that it would be approved, he
added.
The proposal will also probably
be approved on the administrative
end, Wells said.
"[Casper 1 has obviously been
aware how the group has been pro
ceeding," she said. "He's taken a
very keen interest in how the work
ing group progressed. He's veiy
excited about the creativity of these
recommendations."
Provost Condoleezza I lice said
that she hoped to have a decision in
a week. "All that I'm hearing is very
positive about the process. We will
take it very seriously," she said.
Student groups will now have the option of either
working for the Stanford Fund or soliciting funds under
the auspices of the Office of Development, if the propos
al of the Stanford Fund task force is approved by Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice.
Released yesterday, the report is the result of a com
mission created in November in response to student up
roar over a proposed alumni-giving policy limiting stu
dent groups' ability to raise alumni funds.
The policy must now go to the ASSU for endorsement
and then to the Offices of the President and Provost,
where the final say rests with Casper, said Director of
Student Activities Nanci Howe. If approved, the policy
will become effective Sept. 1,1995, she added.
Working partnerships
The new policy allows two choices for student groups
to raise money. First, the proposal creates a pool of
$150,000 to be paid to members of student organizations
who do work for the Stanford Fund.
Students will be paid $20 an hour, with a minimum
group commitment of 25 hours and a maximum group
commitment of 375 hours. Any group which fulfills its
commitment will receive an additional 50% of their base
income for a maximum net income of $11,250.
"It should be more than enough money to meet stu
dents' needs," said task force member and undergradu
ate senator Stephen Russell. "By any account, it's more
than sufficient."
Russell admitted, however, that in time more money

might be required. "Down the road, it may create such a
benefit that it may need to be expanded," he said.
Vanessa Alvarado, committee co-chair and Council of
Presidents member, said that if this happens, the
amount of money allocated will probably increase.
The second option for student organizations is to re
quest money from corporations, alumni and non-alumni
through direct mail and phone solicitation under the su
pervision of the Office of Development.
Groups who opted for this choice, however, would be
required to do their fundraising inside the Office of De
velopment's facilities. All donations also must be
processed through the development
office.
Howe said that she thought this
requirement would improve stu
dent organizations' fundraising
efforts.
"For most student organiza
tions, this would be an asset," Howe
said. "[Stanford Fund] has facilities
available which would be better
than using a dorm phone. It's an
enhancement, not a detriment."
The Office of Development could
do gift processing, provide labels
and do other services for student
groups, Alvarado said. This would
be especially important for "student
groups that don't have as many
resources," she added.
"The Office of Development will
[also] actively assist student organi
zations with professional consulting
using the University database and
the Gift Processing Office," said
Michael Choo, committee member
and deputy senate chair.
Since student groups ask for
funds in Stanford's name, the Uni
versity should have some control,
Russell said.
"When soliciting in the Universi
ty's name, it's important to do it
right," he said. "Also [student

groups] will not have to worry about
the intricacies of the tax code."
A new tax law enacted Jan. 1
requires that receipts be issued to
anyone who donates to an organiza
tion.
Student groups would also be
subject to other restrictions. They
will be limited to five unsuccessful
solicitations of any alumnus, after
which the person would become
ineligible for solicitation.
"There's no five-year limit [for
fund raising], so hopefully people
will be able to work within five solic
itations," Choo said.
A portion of the original Sept. 1
Stanford Fund policy prevented
student groups from soliciting
funds from alumni who had not
donated to that particular organiza
tion in the previous five years.
Another restriction contained in
the new proposal mandates that
student groups can only solicit
alumni funds between Feb. 1 and
July 1.
The time frame was added to
prevent competition between the
University and student organiza
tions, Russell said.
"This exists to benefit both
groups and to prevent them from
competing with each other," he
said. "There has always been a
fund-raising window. This one is
larger."
Alvarado said student groups

could still solicit funds from "corpo
rations, foundations, non-alumni
and friends" throughout the entire
year.
Such a time frame will lead to
more successful fund raising by
allowing groups to develop their
strategies more thoroughly, Howe
said.
"Conceivably, they can spend fall
quarter coming up with a budget
and do fund raising in the spring,"
she said. "They will be more suc
cessful in the long term."
The time frame could cause
problems, said Nancy Wells, direc
tor of the Stanford Fund. "There
may be a situation when a group
wants to solicit alumni in Decem
ber," she said.
