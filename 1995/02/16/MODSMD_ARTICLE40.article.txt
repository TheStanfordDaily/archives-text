# SOUND SCENE

### Janar Stewart Tyler Talbot 
In the glory days when the New Wave outfi,
Simple Minds was slugging it out with Human
League, Flock of Seagulls and Madness for
some mention on primitive MTV by Martha
Quinn, we didn't need liquor to enjoy their
music. Things have changed indeedsince the
Reagan administration.
As we stumbled, half-loaded, into the Ldge
last Saturday night, treading the sea of thir
tysomething Euro-dudes, the pummeling
bass from Simple Minds' latest album, "Good
News from the Next World," harkened their il
lustrious comeback.
It's been three long years since the Minds'
last album (who knows what it was called),
and it's been an entire decade since the release
of their (perhaps) musical piece ({'resistance,

We got our fill of

haute grunge and carrots

"Don't You Forget About Me." In case you've
forgotten, this was the centerpiece of the 1985
brat pack film and soundtrack "The Breakfast
Glub," during the heyday of Molly Ringwald.
Somehow, between then and now, they've
released several albums and are currently
touring clubs.
Advertised as an "18 and over" show, the
Kdge was replete with the elder end of our gen
eration. Was it the groovy beats of "Good
News?" Lead singer Jim Kerr's Bono-esque
stage persona? Or merely ample tap brew?
We turned to the people for the answer.
One of the few and proud Americans we
talked to, Dan, sported a "Simple Minds '83"
tour T-shirt, so we rightly figured he'd shower
us in Minds' trivia. He spun tales of how, in
their formative years, Simple Minds and U2
were artistically competitive, studying and
learning from each other's early endeavors.
Sadly, however, he said that recent Minds
tracks aren't quite up to the level of their now
techno contemporaries, the Pet Shop Boys.
With that we moved on to Dieter (now's the
time on sprockets when we dance!), a Euro-

Swiss dude. He bought us beer. He was cool.
He told us that his girlfriend dragged him
to the show, promising him killer tunage and a
titillating stage presence. Quite unfamiliar
with both vintage Minds and "Good News"
trax, Dieter seemed content to chug his Red
Hook and chat with random concert-goers.
Dieter, however, was not allowed back
stage, stopped cold by the Harley-dude-secu
rity-guy with the excellent leather skull cap.
We, on the other hand, were the first back
stage — rad! Lots of carrots on the buffet. Yum.
Perhaps the highlight of the evening was

meeting the Jim Kerr. Believe it or not, he pre
ferred a quaint discussion of Clintonomics
and the British Parliament to musing about
the cathartic binge 'n' purge of "Good News."
Speaking of "Good News," the album an
swers U2 Baby! and new DuranDuran-isms
with a wickedly overproduced guitar extrava
ganzzzzzza, topped off by a quartet of soul
groovin' female background vocalists and that
ever popular hip-hop beat. The result is so
Velveeta, so overflowing with melodrama that
listeners may long for "John Denver's Greatest
Hits" by the time they reach the first chorus.
Imagine "Zooropa" meets "Seven and the
Ragged Tiger," then add a bit of the Doobie
Brothers' "Brotherhood." "Hypnotized" is re
ally the only song on the album that is recog
nizable as Simple Minds.
Even worse, none of the new ditties are very
catchy. Don't ever expect any of these to ap
pear on an ex-lover's peace gesture "mix" tape
— there are just too many words to sing along.
In the post-Gobain modern nihilistic con
text of our grunge culture, maybe Simple
Minds is just trying to fit in. ■

As I stumped my way reluctantly up
Tresidder's spiral staircase to the KZSU
record fair Saturday, I sucked up my breath in
anticipation for a publicity deluge of the
same ol' same ol' Billboard Top 40. I hough
this was a music biz event, "underground"
and "counterculture" don't spring to my
mind nearly as quickly as "fro yo" and "Big
Bob's Barbecue" when I'm in Tresidder.
Little did 1 know the treasure of relics and
fetishes of aspiring music collectors that
awaited me.
CD's, records — we're talking rare vinyl,
bootleg concert tapes and videos, all beyond
the obscure corners of my imagination. It
was all there. The only thing missing were ti
tles I had heard of. I (lipped through dusty
rows of The ("ure, Prince, Black Crowes and
bunches of other stuff. I reeled as I stumbled
upon the 'fros and groovy cover art of seven
ties records that could have belonged to my
parents. All this for prices as varied as the se
lection, from single digits on jazz LPs to close
to three digits for rarely seen European re
leases of revered artists like Nirvana. A music
collector's dream. Shopaholics and chronic
procrastinators probably got into it too.
"It's an addiction like anything else," said
Carl Robertson, a music collector specializ
ing in '50s and '60s spins. College students,
no surprise, tend to favor the '70s and 80s.
But, Robertson added amiably, record
traders go to the fairs to meet people as much
as anything else. He expected to take in any
where from $300 to $500 from this fair, a
good take since the 600 people attending well
exceeded the expected 350 according to pro
moter Tommy "Toonz" Predovich.
The first record fair of its kind at Stanford,
the Saturday fair was a collaboration between
KZSU and Predovich, who organizes many
such events in the area.
"We're hoping to do maybe four a year (at
Stanford)," Predovich said with all the ener
gy and grand plans of a promoter. "It's been a
real success."
Would Stanford indeed become a hot
house of underground music activity, I won
dered? Not so fast — my overblown visions
were quickly and appropriately deflated by
KZSU music director Chanel Wheeler.
"I've got to get myself employed," Wheel
er, a '94 industrial engineering graduate, said
flatly. "I don't have time."
But for what the fair was, a limited taste, of
the music trading scene, Wheeler said she
was pleased with the results.
"It went much better than I expected,"

Wheeler smiled. "Though the dealers did say
if they'd known what types of people were
coming, they would've brought more CDs
than vinyl."
Then again, the collectors didn't seem to
expect huge sales at a college fair, but proba
bly hoped to cultivate some record collecting
hobbyists.
As Robertson watched me covetously ca
ress the stacks of music, he said with a glint,
"Maybe you'll start collecting albums too."
No sir, said I, detaching myself from the
sales items; I is just a poor college student
with no money and fewer skills.
Resigned to my empty-pocketed state, 1
took to people-watching, which was alleged
ly fairly interesting early in the day.
Eric Saxon, a sophomore, jived with the
alternative ethos of the fair, even given the
sterile Tresidder Oak Room surroundings.
" This one was good, a lot of punk music,"
Saxon said.
At that point 1 realized I was broke and
quickly wearying of being a quasi-hipster, so
I decided to head home. But of course, by
this time, even the organizers were leaving. ■
