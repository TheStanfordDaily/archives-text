# Our Eyes Can See The Glory
## Aïda new play explores racial and gender identities in the Harlem renaissance 
### Gabriela Teodorescu 
Color strikes the eye — stark images of
four women in black, blue, red and
white dancing to narrated music. In
many ways the introductory scene of "Our
Eyes Can See" thus depicts the play's underly
ing themes — color, representation and nar
rative.
"The best thing [about the show] is that
you are going to see a play you have not seen
before — it is very unusual," said Mimi
McGurl, the director of the play. "It deals in a
new way with the PC litany of race and gen
der," she said.
Spiritual movement
The play follows one day in the life of four
women living out their lives in Harlem. Peach
es, played by Ryan Bathe, is a blues singer who
does everything her way. To the chagrin of her
manager and her piano player Buddy (Tonka
Cadoree), she wears suits instead of sequined
dresses at her shows. As she says,"I don't
wanna be considered no regular lady."
Playwright Aida Croal integrates criticism
and praise of black society through the
church. Aunt Sarah (Bridgit Evans), Peaches'
religious older sister, has come to question
God and the church since the murder of her
brother. In a powerful scene, Sarah's obvious
need for explanation in the face of the preach
er's (Sterling K. Brown) placating words criti
cizes a major aspect of Harlem Renaissance
society — black acquiescence. At the same
time, the scene indicates how the church can
offer a meeting place, a place of convergence
for black society.
"I wanted to show what was empowering
about the church, how it provides spiritual
aid," Croal said. "Nevertheless, the church
does not advocate spiritual agency, it does not
allow its members to act. I was trying to show
that both factors are necessary — there can't
be a movement without soul."
Racial ambivalence
Throughout the play, Saffronia (Priya
Satia) pushes the issue of race and gender. She
is the daughter of a rich, white plantation
owner who raped Saffronia's black mother.
Saffronia has been passing herself as white to
her rich, white boyfriend Robert, played by
Richard Schimpf.
She plays charades not only with her
boyfriend but also with her black sisters. And
in the end, she has to make a choice about
which one to be. In that world, the definitions
are only "us" and "them," and no place exists
for Saffronia to be both.
The play explores not only black but also
white representation. Robert, the bigoted
white male, is caught up in how people repre
sent him, and can never escape his status in
order to be fully human. For him, blacks have
"their" neighborhoods and "we" are only vis
itors. His motto is "I don't make the rules, I
just follow them."
Also in the script are two white doctors who

represent white analysis of black culture.
Though amusing, their roles also disturb by
showing how black culture for too long was
defined in white terms.
"The play allows for ambivalence,"
Schimpf said. "It is not centered around one
person or one plot line. There is this great web
of relationships which makes it more human
than other plays."
The importance of narration, and of
blacks' narration of their own stories, is sym
bolized through the allegorical words of a
fourth woman in the play, Sweet Thing (Shirra
Graves). She is a fierce characterization of
street-wise youth gone bad. With help from
Peaches, Sweet Thing begins to change and
take control of her life.
When Peaches' manager insists Peaches
change her costume, Sweet Thing says to him,
"You should think about what happens when
you cage up a bird — it don't sing."
Nevertheless, her swift transition from
prostitute to intelligent manager is somewhat
unrealistic. Sweet Thing changes too quickly
for the audience to find her believable.
CJ+s not just a racial fKing
But "Our Eyes Can See" does not restrict it
self to the exploration of ethnic identity. Issues
of gender and sisterhood are interwoven in

unusual ways.
"The play is not just about race... but it is
unique because it has four black women as the
main characters," McGurl said. "They are not
objects — everything revolves around their
lives."
In addition, "Our Eyes" stretches the
bounds of theater by integrating dance into
the dramatic production. Throughout the
play, each woman has an alter-ego dancer. The
dancers not only add character subtext to the
play, but provide a visual break and contrast.
Aunt Sarah's alter ego, played by Cheryl
Clarke (who did some of her own choreogra
phy), comes in through the mirror at one
point and whispers, "Let me take you back." In
the visually striking tribal dance that follows,
Aunt Sarah is drawn into her primal identity
by the sheer power of the movement, rhythm
and music.
"Aida did not write this with a tired idea of
what drama is supposed to look like — some
of it is filmic or MTVesque," McGurl said.
"There is no typical Aristotelian character de
velopment. She ignored traditional conven
tions."
The characters must deal with how they are
represented by society, and also their repre
sentation of themselves to the world. "It is
about how we represent ourselves, and how

we are tripped up by different societal ideas
which make us blind," Croal said. "All the
characters are just fighting to be fully human."
The importance of representation is under
lined by Peaches' refusal to change her
wardrobe, by Saffronia's ambiguous race, and
by Sweet Thing's realization of the importance
of appearances.
As Sweet Thing mentions to Peaches at one
point, "You will look more important with
someone carrying your things." It is the signif
icance of looking and being looked at that
"Our Eyes Can See" captures so brilliantly.
Wo>*k in process
Senior Aida Croal, pursuing an individual
ly designed major in cultural studies and cre
ative writing, was inspired to write the play by
Nina Simone's song "Four Women." She re
ceived a grant from Undergraduate Research
Opportunities to research and write the play
in the summer of 1994.
"It is a work in progress," Croal said. "I
wrote the screenplay while realizing that I had
the limitation of not seeing it. In the first cou
ple of weeks of rehearsals, I did some minor
rewrites based on the limitations of putting
the work on stage."
Croal has not seen the play since she did the
rewrites, and she eagerly anticipates the final
staging of the show. "After I see this produc
tion, I will see what other limits the work has
and I will definitely rework it," Croal contin
ued. "I want the play to have a life like any
other script. I have ambitions for it and I want
it to get published and I hope it is reproduced."
The supporting work of the production is
equally ambitious and does much to enrich
the final product. Hope Mohr's choreography
is graceful yet stunning. The set, designed by
Bay Area designer Pam Pcniston and inspired
by artist Jacob Lawrence, is spare enough that
it does not take anything away, but instead en
hances the uniqueness of the drama. The cos
tumes, designed by Drama doctoral candidate
Judith Dolan, are period pieces from the 1930s
and '40s which capture well the mood of the
Harlem Renaissance.
Overall, the play leaves the spectator
feeling enriched and touched by the
fight that all these characters are
waging. In their common struggle to be free
from societal generalizations, the characters
each learn something from the others and
teach the audience about the importance of
being human.

white dancing to narrated music. In
many ways the introductory scene of "Our
Eyes Can See" thus depicts the play's underly
ing themes — color, representation and nar
rative.
"The best thing [about the show] is that
you are going to see a play you have not seen
before — it is very unusual," said Mimi
McGurl, the director of the play. "It deals in a
new way with the PC litany of race and gen
der," she said.
Spiritual movement
The play follows one day in the life of four
women living out their lives in Harlem. Peach
es, played by Ryan Bathe, is a blues singer who
does everything her way. To the chagrin of her
manager and her piano player Buddy (Tonka
Cadoree), she wears suits instead of sequined
dresses at her shows. As she says,"I don't
wanna be considered no regular lady."
Playwright Aida Croal integrates criticism
and praise of black society through the
church. Aunt Sarah (Bridgit Evans), Peaches'
religious older sister, has come to question
God and the church since the murder of her
brother. In a powerful scene, Sarah's obvious
need for explanation in the face of the preach
er's (Sterling K. Brown) placating words criti
cizes a major aspect of Harlem Renaissance
society — black acquiescence. At the same
time, the scene indicates how the church can
offer a meeting place, a place of convergence
for black society.
"I wanted to show what was empowering
about the church, how it provides spiritual
aid," Croal said. "Nevertheless, the church
does not advocate spiritual agency, it does not
allow its members to act. I was trying to show
that both factors are necessary — there can't
be a movement without soul."
Racial ambivalence
Throughout the play, Saffronia (Priya
Satia) pushes the issue of race and gender. She
is the daughter of a rich, white plantation
owner who raped Saffronia's black mother.
Saffronia has been passing herself as white to
her rich, white boyfriend Robert, played by
Richard Schimpf.
She plays charades not only with her
boyfriend but also with her black sisters. And
in the end, she has to make a choice about
which one to be. In that world, the definitions
are only "us" and "them," and no place exists
for Saffronia to be both.
The play explores not only black but also
white representation. Robert, the bigoted
white male, is caught up in how people repre
sent him, and can never escape his status in
order to be fully human. For him, blacks have
"their" neighborhoods and "we" are only vis
itors. His motto is "I don't make the rules, I
just follow them."
Also in the script are two white doctors who

represent white analysis of black culture.
Though amusing, their roles also disturb by
showing how black culture for too long was
defined in white terms.
"The play allows for ambivalence,"
Schimpf said. "It is not centered around one
person or one plot line. There is this great web
of relationships which makes it more human
than other plays."
The importance of narration, and of
blacks' narration of their own stories, is sym
bolized through the allegorical words of a
fourth woman in the play, Sweet Thing (Shirra
Graves). She is a fierce characterization of
street-wise youth gone bad. With help from
Peaches, Sweet Thing begins to change and
take control of her life.
When Peaches' manager insists Peaches
change her costume, Sweet Thing says to him,
"You should think about what happens when
you cage up a bird — it don't sing."
Nevertheless, her swift transition from
prostitute to intelligent manager is somewhat
unrealistic. Sweet Thing changes too quickly
for the audience to find her believable.
CJ+s not just a racial fKing
But "Our Eyes Can See" does not restrict it
self to the exploration of ethnic identity. Issues
of gender and sisterhood are interwoven in

unusual ways.
"The play is not just about race... but it is
unique because it has four black women as the
main characters," McGurl said. "They are not
objects — everything revolves around their
lives."
In addition, "Our Eyes" stretches the
bounds of theater by integrating dance into
the dramatic production. Throughout the
play, each woman has an alter-ego dancer. The
dancers not only add character subtext to the
play, but provide a visual break and contrast.
Aunt Sarah's alter ego, played by Cheryl
Clarke (who did some of her own choreogra
phy), comes in through the mirror at one
point and whispers, "Let me take you back." In
the visually striking tribal dance that follows,
Aunt Sarah is drawn into her primal identity
by the sheer power of the movement, rhythm
and music.
"Aida did not write this with a tired idea of
what drama is supposed to look like — some
of it is filmic or MTVesque," McGurl said.
"There is no typical Aristotelian character de
velopment. She ignored traditional conven
tions."
The characters must deal with how they are
represented by society, and also their repre
sentation of themselves to the world. "It is
about how we represent ourselves, and how

we are tripped up by different societal ideas
which make us blind," Croal said. "All the
characters are just fighting to be fully human."
The importance of representation is under
lined by Peaches' refusal to change her
wardrobe, by Saffronia's ambiguous race, and
by Sweet Thing's realization of the importance
of appearances.
As Sweet Thing mentions to Peaches at one
point, "You will look more important with
someone carrying your things." It is the signif
icance of looking and being looked at that
"Our Eyes Can See" captures so brilliantly.
Wo>*k in process
Senior Aida Croal, pursuing an individual
ly designed major in cultural studies and cre
ative writing, was inspired to write the play by
Nina Simone's song "Four Women." She re
ceived a grant from Undergraduate Research
Opportunities to research and write the play
in the summer of 1994.
"It is a work in progress," Croal said. "I
wrote the screenplay while realizing that I had
the limitation of not seeing it. In the first cou
ple of weeks of rehearsals, I did some minor
rewrites based on the limitations of putting
the work on stage."
Croal has not seen the play since she did the
rewrites, and she eagerly anticipates the final
staging of the show. "After I see this produc
tion, I will see what other limits the work has
and I will definitely rework it," Croal contin
ued. "I want the play to have a life like any
other script. I have ambitions for it and I want
it to get published and I hope it is reproduced."
The supporting work of the production is
equally ambitious and does much to enrich
the final product. Hope Mohr's choreography
is graceful yet stunning. The set, designed by
Bay Area designer Pam Pcniston and inspired
by artist Jacob Lawrence, is spare enough that
it does not take anything away, but instead en
hances the uniqueness of the drama. The cos
tumes, designed by Drama doctoral candidate
Judith Dolan, are period pieces from the 1930s
and '40s which capture well the mood of the
Harlem Renaissance.
Overall, the play leaves the spectator
feeling enriched and touched by the
fight that all these characters are
waging. In their common struggle to be free
from societal generalizations, the characters
each learn something from the others and
teach the audience about the importance of
being human.
