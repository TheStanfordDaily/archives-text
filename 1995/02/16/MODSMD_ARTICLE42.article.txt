## Artist Nathan Oliveira's Vsions of Flight

My heart is hiding Stirred for a bird, — the
achieve of, the mastery of the thing.
—from"The Windhover" by Gerard Manley
Hopkins
The words of a 19th century Irish
poet and the works of modern
artist Nathan Oliveira seem so
closely intertwined that the relation seems
to be deliberate. But artist and former Stan
ford professor Nathan Oliveira didn't plan
to name his paintings "The Windhover."
After all, he had never heard of the poem
while working on his paintings. But some
how, they seemed to name themselves.
Many people have remarked on the re
semblance of the series of paintings to the
Hopkins' poem. The coincidence "was very
mysterious," Oliveira observed. But he said
it lightly, which is not at all surprising for a
man who strongly believes in the power of
destiny.
"The Windhover" is a series of paintings
that Oliveira has been working on since
1985. When 1 walked into the Stanford Art
Gallery where his paintings are currently on
exhibit, I was met by large canvases hung on
the walls of a barren room. In the center of
the gallery are several benches. I took a seat
on one of them and stared at the paintings
surrounding me. It's a stage set not for a
quick glance before the gallery closes, but
for lengthy contemplation.
All the works are on the subject of (light
— birds, the shadows of birds, the wings of
birds, the curve of the wing — all growing
progressively across the years from the real
istic to the more abstract. Oliveira's paint
ings are not ones we can look at once and
walk away from feeling content that we've
understood them. Like true abstract art,
they tend to grow in our minds, letting us
use them as an anchor for the branching out
of our own thoughts.
□ liveira's studio is as big as the
room in the gallery, only
more impressive. Again, you
are met mostly by emptiness. Several large
paintings, are scattered across the room.
The counter against the wall is cluttered
with paint supplies and a few stuffed birds.
The large windows, looking out into the
Stanford foothills, let in a stream of light.

Oliveira glanced around him. "Most of
the big paintings at the gallery happened in
this room, which is a beautiful studio."
The son of Portuguese-American par
ents, Oliveira grew up mostly in the Oak
land area, but has since traveled to many
parts of the world. He has exhibited his art
both in this country and internationally. A
professor of art from 1964 until 1994,
Oliveira has only recently retired from the

Stanford faculty.
He taught at all
levels, from be
ginning to ad
vanced under
graduate draw
ing courses,
making his tal
ent available to
all students, re
gardless of year
or field of study.
"About 99 per
cent of the stu
dents that came
through didn't
want to be an art
major. I liked
that."
Oliveira also
liked seeing peo
ple leave with a
finer apprecia
tion for art,
stressing its im
porta n c e .
"Artists have
been around for
so long. We color
the world. If it
weren't for such
people as artists

and musicians,
the world would be so gray."
The concept of flight has always been a
source of fascination for Oliveira. Even as a
child, he admired the ability of birds to fly
high above the ground. He first started
painting them years later when a friend gave
him a stuffed bird. He used it as a model, as
well as a dead kestrel he found on his
doorstep one day. All the paintings he did of
birds in these early years were much more
realistic than they would one day be.
"It's a catalogue," he explained, referring

to his earlier paintings. "It explains the gen
esis of where I started. So it began with these
other, earlier birds and some others. And
then I started thinking about how wonder
ful it must be to fly away like the birds and
only come down to earth when it's neces
sary. Of course we can't fly — which is why
men jump off of planes with parachutes.
"As I looked at those birds they seemed
very fortunate to be able to detach [them-

selves] from the everyday as
pects of life," he continued.
Over the years, what had
once been just an idea slowly
began to develop. "If I can't

fly physically, 1 can certainly
fly in the back of my mind. And any
body who has ever invented anything
worthwhile in life has imagined that in
their minds. And so I thought of that,
and the symbol [of flight ] that came to mind
was a wing. Remembering all the other

paintings of birds I had done before, I
thought: 'What if I painted one big wing?' "
But Oliveira couldn't stop at one painting.
"I felt [the first work] didn't contain that es
sential element of flight. So then I needed
another one and another one."
But Oliveira's results still didn't represent
the idea of flight that he envisioned. "I start
ed thinking of the limitations, of why it
wasn't capable of illuminating that sensa

tion, of why
it wasn't
sending
that sensa
tion back to
me."

It was at this
point that Oliveira's art began to take a
more abstract turn. "I started to think
about that wonderful curve," he said, refer
ring to the arch of a bird's wing. He made a
sweeping motion with his hand.
"The wing then became an abstraction ot
the beast that had come to create its own
sense of reality."
He looked at me questioningly.
"You see? In other words, with the reality
of the wing always being there, the power of
the wing became real in and of itself. By
[recreating] this, I was carrying out a dia
logue with these paintings and getting
something that looked like a wing but was
becoming something more and more ab
stract. And suddenly the concept of flight

that I had so many years before started to
appear."
He emphasized here the gradual growth
of his ideas. "You keep on moving to the
next step and to the next step and to the next
step." Oliveira's art is not a flash of inspi
ration. It is a substance that develops over
time. When a painting doesn't fully capture
an idea, he simply goes one step further,
making use of everything else he's learned.

"The
ideas
gener
a t e

themselves —
you get a little
hit of information, and you put it together
and you interact with that. I continue with
the interaction and the dialogue that I have
with those ideas. When we talk about ideas,
! they don't come on] like a light bulb.'
Oliveira's work maintain a discourse. 1 his
"came as a result of a dialogue between me
and the act of creating." While his paintings
started off as separate entities, "one here, one
there," they eventually came together around
a unified theme. It evolved from Olivcira
communicating with his ideas and from the
ideas themselves speaking to each other.
"That's the way you should be, too," he
told me, stressing the importance of using all
of one's interests and letting all the pieces of

life come together as they undoubtedly will.
1 watched him, sitting on a comfortable,
faded armchair that seemed to have been
around longer than 1 had, animation res
onating from his voice. His art is evidently
something he loves to talk about. His words
are much more eloquent than mine will ever
be, and 1 wondered if perhaps 1 should have
asked him to write his own article. A ques
tion here or there was all it took to set him

off, and he spoke at
length. It occurred to
me that he did this
not only because he
enjoyed personal re
flection but because

he wanted me to see something —
something terribly important. He
had discovered a secret to living
life that he wanted to share.
Through his painting, he gives us a

glimpse of the power of our minds. Through
the story of his life, he wants us to realize the
looming force of destiny.
"I'm a very mysterious person because I
think that I had a destiny to be an artist. 1
don't think that I could have entered into
any other profession." And looking at him,
I agreed. I couldn't imagine him as any
thing else. "I had a learning disability as a
child, but somehow, with drawing, I ex
celled."
Oliveira told me about his first realization
that he wanted to be an artist. After high
school, he started college without much en
thusiasm. He was unable to focus and soon
dropped out to become an apprentice to a
bookbinder. It was at this point that an inci
dent which made a deep impression in his
mind occurred.
"I saw my high school principal. And this
was back in those days when we all knew our
high school principals — and he knew you
and he asked me what I was doing. I told

him I was apprenticed to
a bookbinder, and he
said: 'Nonsense. You
were meant to be a
painter. You're an artist.'
And I couldn't believe he
knew" He glanced at me
with a expression of awe.
"It was a psychic experi
ence — if 1 had gone out

on the street five minutes earlier or five min
utes later, I wouldn't have seen him." After
this brief conversation, Oliveira returned to
school and graduated with a degree in fine
arts.
I asked him about the shift in his work
from realism to increased abstraction.
"Once we realize the association with what
the wing looks like, one just becomes too
involved with that as opposed to what the
wing can do. You see?" He glanced at me
questioningly again. "The more you be
come aware of | the importance of the idea
over representation], once you destroy the
virtual reality and take [painting] into the
more abstract, the more the wing retains its
own relative reality. So what I created had
its own sense of reality — it became sym
bolic."
Working mostly in oil, Oliveira has suc
ceeded in destroying strict reality. This is ev
ident in the gradual evolution of his paint
ings on display in the gallery. The wing slow
ly loses its importance as the idea of flight
that the wing symbolizes takes hold. The
largest, done in two canvases, covers an en
tire wall.
1 asked Oliveira about the size of his
works, and he told me a story of a time he
had been watching a football game. Bored,
he glanced around the room and suddenly
felt an urge to create a painting as large as the
room. Once he started, he realized it wasn't
big enough and made it even larger.

What are Oliveira's plans for
the future? "I could continue
on this theme for the rest of
my life," he responded. But he's unsure
whether he will. He has also considered
doing a series of paintings of endangered
species, using his abstract art to symbolize
their gradual disappearance.
"I've also been thinking about a large lion
— a life-size lion."
But, whatever he chooses to do, Oliveira
is sure that he will never stop painting.
I asked him why he uses the kestrel wing
in almost all his works.
"Guess what 'The Windhover' poem is
about?" he responded rhetorically. "A
kestrel."
One more point for destiny.
More than anything, destiny has played a
part of Oliveira's life, and he cannot seem to
emphasize its importance enough. "Stu
dents need to realize that. They come here
and try to find a career, and think, 'Oh, I've
always liked mechanical engineering so I
guess I'll do that.' " But it shouldn't be that
way, he insists.
We don't have to look for life. It chooses
us. We just wait. Everything will fall into
place on its own "if you wait to be told with
in yourself about what you want, it you lis
ten to yourself. You have to believe that."
I wonder if 1 do, but listening to the con
viction in his voice, it seems almost difficult
not to.

faded armchair that seemed to have been
around longer than 1 had, animation res
onating from his voice. His art is evidently
something he loves to talk about. His words
are much more eloquent than mine will ever
be, and 1 wondered if perhaps 1 should have
asked him to write his own article. A ques
tion here or there was all it took to set him

off, and he spoke at
length. It occurred to
me that he did this
not only because he
enjoyed personal re
flection but because

he wanted me to see something —
something terribly important. He
had discovered a secret to living
life that he wanted to share.
Through his painting, he gives us a

glimpse of the power of our minds. Through
the story of his life, he wants us to realize the
looming force of destiny.
"I'm a very mysterious person because I
think that I had a destiny to be an artist. 1
don't think that I could have entered into
any other profession." And looking at him,
I agreed. I couldn't imagine him as any
thing else. "I had a learning disability as a
child, but somehow, with drawing, I ex
celled."
Oliveira told me about his first realization
that he wanted to be an artist. After high
school, he started college without much en
thusiasm. He was unable to focus and soon
dropped out to become an apprentice to a
bookbinder. It was at this point that an inci
dent which made a deep impression in his
mind occurred.
"I saw my high school principal. And this
was back in those days when we all knew our
high school principals — and he knew you
and he asked me what I was doing. I told

him I was apprenticed to
a bookbinder, and he
said: 'Nonsense. You
were meant to be a
painter. You're an artist.'
And I couldn't believe he
knew" He glanced at me
with a expression of awe.
"It was a psychic experi
ence — if 1 had gone out

on the street five minutes earlier or five min
utes later, I wouldn't have seen him." After
this brief conversation, Oliveira returned to
school and graduated with a degree in fine
arts.
I asked him about the shift in his work
from realism to increased abstraction.
"Once we realize the association with what
the wing looks like, one just becomes too
involved with that as opposed to what the
wing can do. You see?" He glanced at me
questioningly again. "The more you be
come aware of | the importance of the idea
over representation], once you destroy the
virtual reality and take [painting] into the
more abstract, the more the wing retains its
own relative reality. So what I created had
its own sense of reality — it became sym
bolic."
Working mostly in oil, Oliveira has suc
ceeded in destroying strict reality. This is ev
ident in the gradual evolution of his paint
ings on display in the gallery. The wing slow
ly loses its importance as the idea of flight
that the wing symbolizes takes hold. The
largest, done in two canvases, covers an en
tire wall.
1 asked Oliveira about the size of his
works, and he told me a story of a time he
had been watching a football game. Bored,
he glanced around the room and suddenly
felt an urge to create a painting as large as the
room. Once he started, he realized it wasn't
big enough and made it even larger.

What are Oliveira's plans for
the future? "I could continue
on this theme for the rest of
my life," he responded. But he's unsure
whether he will. He has also considered
doing a series of paintings of endangered
species, using his abstract art to symbolize
their gradual disappearance.
"I've also been thinking about a large lion
— a life-size lion."
But, whatever he chooses to do, Oliveira
is sure that he will never stop painting.
I asked him why he uses the kestrel wing
in almost all his works.
"Guess what 'The Windhover' poem is
about?" he responded rhetorically. "A
kestrel."
One more point for destiny.
More than anything, destiny has played a
part of Oliveira's life, and he cannot seem to
emphasize its importance enough. "Stu
dents need to realize that. They come here
and try to find a career, and think, 'Oh, I've
always liked mechanical engineering so I
guess I'll do that.' " But it shouldn't be that
way, he insists.
We don't have to look for life. It chooses
us. We just wait. Everything will fall into
place on its own "if you wait to be told with
in yourself about what you want, it you lis
ten to yourself. You have to believe that."
I wonder if 1 do, but listening to the con
viction in his voice, it seems almost difficult
not to.



My heart is hiding Stirred for a bird, — the

—from"The Windhover" by Gerard Manley
Hopkins
The words of a 19th century Irish
poet and the works of modern
artist Nathan Oliveira seem so
closely intertwined that the relation seems
to be deliberate. But artist and former Stan
ford professor Nathan Oliveira didn't plan
to name his paintings "The Windhover."
After all, he had never heard of the poem
while working on his paintings. But some
how, they seemed to name themselves.
Many people have remarked on the re
semblance of the series of paintings to the
Hopkins' poem. The coincidence "was very
mysterious," Oliveira observed. But he said
it lightly, which is not at all surprising for a
man who strongly believes in the power of
destiny.
"The Windhover" is a series of paintings
that Oliveira has been working on since
1985. When 1 walked into the Stanford Art
Gallery where his paintings are currently on
exhibit, I was met by large canvases hung on
the walls of a barren room. In the center of
the gallery are several benches. I took a seat
on one of them and stared at the paintings
surrounding me. It's a stage set not for a
quick glance before the gallery closes, but
for lengthy contemplation.
All the works are on the subject of (light
— birds, the shadows of birds, the wings of
birds, the curve of the wing — all growing
progressively across the years from the real
istic to the more abstract. Oliveira's paint
ings are not ones we can look at once and
walk away from feeling content that we've
understood them. Like true abstract art,
they tend to grow in our minds, letting us
use them as an anchor for the branching out
of our own thoughts.
□ liveira's studio is as big as the
room in the gallery, only
more impressive. Again, you
are met mostly by emptiness. Several large
paintings, are scattered across the room.
The counter against the wall is cluttered
with paint supplies and a few stuffed birds.
The large windows, looking out into the
Stanford foothills, let in a stream of light.

Oliveira glanced around him. "Most of
the big paintings at the gallery happened in
this room, which is a beautiful studio."
The son of Portuguese-American par
ents, Oliveira grew up mostly in the Oak
land area, but has since traveled to many
parts of the world. He has exhibited his art
both in this country and internationally. A
professor of art from 1964 until 1994,
Oliveira has only recently retired from the

Stanford faculty.
He taught at all
levels, from be
ginning to ad
vanced under
graduate draw
ing courses,
making his tal
ent available to
all students, re
gardless of year
or field of study.
"About 99 per
cent of the stu
dents that came
through didn't
want to be an art
major. I liked
that."
Oliveira also
liked seeing peo
ple leave with a
finer apprecia
tion for art,
stressing its im
porta n c e .
"Artists have
been around for
so long. We color
the world. If it
weren't for such
people as artists

and musicians,
the world would be so gray."
The concept of flight has always been a
source of fascination for Oliveira. Even as a
child, he admired the ability of birds to fly
high above the ground. He first started
painting them years later when a friend gave
him a stuffed bird. He used it as a model, as
well as a dead kestrel he found on his
doorstep one day. All the paintings he did of
birds in these early years were much more
realistic than they would one day be.
"It's a catalogue," he explained, referring

to his earlier paintings. "It explains the gen
esis of where I started. So it began with these
other, earlier birds and some others. And
then I started thinking about how wonder
ful it must be to fly away like the birds and
only come down to earth when it's neces
sary. Of course we can't fly — which is why
men jump off of planes with parachutes.
"As I looked at those birds they seemed
very fortunate to be able to detach [them-

selves] from the everyday as
pects of life," he continued.
Over the years, what had
once been just an idea slowly
began to develop. "If I can't

fly physically, 1 can certainly
fly in the back of my mind. And any
body who has ever invented anything
worthwhile in life has imagined that in
their minds. And so I thought of that,
and the symbol [of flight ] that came to mind
was a wing. Remembering all the other

paintings of birds I had done before, I
thought: 'What if I painted one big wing?' "
But Oliveira couldn't stop at one painting.
"I felt [the first work] didn't contain that es
sential element of flight. So then I needed
another one and another one."
But Oliveira's results still didn't represent
the idea of flight that he envisioned. "I start
ed thinking of the limitations, of why it
wasn't capable of illuminating that sensa

tion, of why
it wasn't
sending
that sensa
tion back to
me."

It was at this
point that Oliveira's art began to take a
more abstract turn. "I started to think
about that wonderful curve," he said, refer
ring to the arch of a bird's wing. He made a
sweeping motion with his hand.
"The wing then became an abstraction ot
the beast that had come to create its own
sense of reality."
He looked at me questioningly.
"You see? In other words, with the reality
of the wing always being there, the power of
the wing became real in and of itself. By
[recreating] this, I was carrying out a dia
logue with these paintings and getting
something that looked like a wing but was
becoming something more and more ab
stract. And suddenly the concept of flight

that I had so many years before started to
appear."
He emphasized here the gradual growth
of his ideas. "You keep on moving to the
next step and to the next step and to the next
step." Oliveira's art is not a flash of inspi
ration. It is a substance that develops over
time. When a painting doesn't fully capture
an idea, he simply goes one step further,
making use of everything else he's learned.

"The
ideas
gener
a t e

themselves —
you get a little
hit of information, and you put it together
and you interact with that. I continue with
the interaction and the dialogue that I have
with those ideas. When we talk about ideas,
! they don't come on] like a light bulb.'
Oliveira's work maintain a discourse. 1 his
"came as a result of a dialogue between me
and the act of creating." While his paintings
started off as separate entities, "one here, one
there," they eventually came together around
a unified theme. It evolved from Olivcira
communicating with his ideas and from the
ideas themselves speaking to each other.
"That's the way you should be, too," he
told me, stressing the importance of using all
of one's interests and letting all the pieces of

life come together as they undoubtedly will.
1 watched him, sitting on a comfortable,
faded armchair that seemed to have been

ginning to ad
vanced under
graduate draw
ing courses,
making his tal
ent available to
all students, re
gardless of year
or field of study.
"About 99 per
cent of the stu
dents that came
through didn't
want to be an art
major. I liked
that."
Oliveira also
liked seeing peo
ple leave with a
finer apprecia
tion for art,
stressing its im
porta n c e .
"Artists have
been around for
so long. We color
the world. If it
weren't for such
people as artists

and musicians,
the world would be so gray."
The concept of flight has always been a
source of fascination for Oliveira. Even as a
child, he admired the ability of birds to fly
high above the ground. He first started
painting them years later when a friend gave
him a stuffed bird. He used it as a model, as
well as a dead kestrel he found on his
doorstep one day. All the paintings he did of
birds in these early years were much more
realistic than they would one day be.
"It's a catalogue," he explained, referring

to his earlier paintings. "It explains the gen
esis of where I started. So it began with these
other, earlier birds and some others. And
then I started thinking about how wonder
ful it must be to fly away like the birds and
only come down to earth when it's neces
sary. Of course we can't fly — which is why
men jump off of planes with parachutes.
"As I looked at those birds they seemed
very fortunate to be able to detach [them-

selves] from the everyday as
pects of life," he continued.
Over the years, what had
once been just an idea slowly
began to develop. "If I can't

fly physically, 1 can certainly
fly in the back of my mind. And any
body who has ever invented anything
worthwhile in life has imagined that in
their minds. And so I thought of that,
and the symbol [of flight ] that came to mind
was a wing. Remembering all the other

paintings of birds I had done before, I
thought: 'What if I painted one big wing?' "
But Oliveira couldn't stop at one painting.
"I felt [the first work] didn't contain that es
sential element of flight. So then I needed
another one and another one."
But Oliveira's results still didn't represent
the idea of flight that he envisioned. "I start
ed thinking of the limitations, of why it
wasn't capable of illuminating that sensa

tion, of why
it wasn't
sending
that sensa
tion back to
me."

It was at this
point that Oliveira's art began to take a
more abstract turn. "I started to think
about that wonderful curve," he said, refer
ring to the arch of a bird's wing. He made a
sweeping motion with his hand.
"The wing then became an abstraction ot
the beast that had come to create its own
sense of reality."
He looked at me questioningly.
"You see? In other words, with the reality
of the wing always being there, the power of
the wing became real in and of itself. By
[recreating] this, I was carrying out a dia
logue with these paintings and getting
something that looked like a wing but was
becoming something more and more ab
stract. And suddenly the concept of flight

that I had so many years before started to
appear."
He emphasized here the gradual growth
of his ideas. "You keep on moving to the
next step and to the next step and to the next
step." Oliveira's art is not a flash of inspi
ration. It is a substance that develops over
time. When a painting doesn't fully capture
an idea, he simply goes one step further,
making use of everything else he's learned.

"The
ideas
gener
a t e

themselves —
you get a little
hit of information, and you put it together
and you interact with that. I continue with
the interaction and the dialogue that I have
with those ideas. When we talk about ideas,
! they don't come on] like a light bulb.'
Oliveira's work maintain a discourse. 1 his
"came as a result of a dialogue between me
and the act of creating." While his paintings
started off as separate entities, "one here, one
there," they eventually came together around
a unified theme. It evolved from Olivcira
communicating with his ideas and from the
ideas themselves speaking to each other.
"That's the way you should be, too," he
told me, stressing the importance of using all
of one's interests and letting all the pieces of

life come together as they undoubtedly will.
1 watched him, sitting on a comfortable,
faded armchair that seemed to have been
around longer than 1 had, animation res
onating from his voice. His art is evidently
something he loves to talk about. His words
are much more eloquent than mine will ever
be, and 1 wondered if perhaps 1 should have
asked him to write his own article. A ques
tion here or there was all it took to set him

off, and he spoke at
length. It occurred to
me that he did this
not only because he
enjoyed personal re
flection but because

he wanted me to see something —
something terribly important. He
had discovered a secret to living
life that he wanted to share.
Through his painting, he gives us a

glimpse of the power of our minds. Through
the story of his life, he wants us to realize the
looming force of destiny.
"I'm a very mysterious person because I
think that I had a destiny to be an artist. 1
don't think that I could have entered into
any other profession." And looking at him,
I agreed. I couldn't imagine him as any
thing else. "I had a learning disability as a
child, but somehow, with drawing, I ex
celled."
Oliveira told me about his first realization
that he wanted to be an artist. After high
school, he started college without much en
thusiasm. He was unable to focus and soon
dropped out to become an apprentice to a
bookbinder. It was at this point that an inci
dent which made a deep impression in his
mind occurred.
"I saw my high school principal. And this
was back in those days when we all knew our
high school principals — and he knew you
and he asked me what I was doing. I told

him I was apprenticed to
a bookbinder, and he
said: 'Nonsense. You
were meant to be a
painter. You're an artist.'
And I couldn't believe he
knew" He glanced at me
with a expression of awe.
"It was a psychic experi
ence — if 1 had gone out

on the street five minutes earlier or five min
utes later, I wouldn't have seen him." After
this brief conversation, Oliveira returned to
school and graduated with a degree in fine
arts.
I asked him about the shift in his work
from realism to increased abstraction.
"Once we realize the association with what
the wing looks like, one just becomes too
involved with that as opposed to what the
wing can do. You see?" He glanced at me
questioningly again. "The more you be
come aware of | the importance of the idea
over representation], once you destroy the
virtual reality and take [painting] into the
more abstract, the more the wing retains its
own relative reality. So what I created had
its own sense of reality — it became sym
bolic."
Working mostly in oil, Oliveira has suc
ceeded in destroying strict reality. This is ev
ident in the gradual evolution of his paint
ings on display in the gallery. The wing slow
ly loses its importance as the idea of flight
that the wing symbolizes takes hold. The
largest, done in two canvases, covers an en
tire wall.
1 asked Oliveira about the size of his
works, and he told me a story of a time he
had been watching a football game. Bored,
he glanced around the room and suddenly
felt an urge to create a painting as large as the
room. Once he started, he realized it wasn't
big enough and made it even larger.

What are Oliveira's plans for
the future? "I could continue
on this theme for the rest of
my life," he responded. But he's unsure
whether he will. He has also considered
doing a series of paintings of endangered
species, using his abstract art to symbolize
their gradual disappearance.
"I've also been thinking about a large lion
— a life-size lion."
But, whatever he chooses to do, Oliveira
is sure that he will never stop painting.
I asked him why he uses the kestrel wing
in almost all his works.
"Guess what 'The Windhover' poem is
about?" he responded rhetorically. "A
kestrel."
One more point for destiny.
More than anything, destiny has played a
part of Oliveira's life, and he cannot seem to
emphasize its importance enough. "Stu
dents need to realize that. They come here
and try to find a career, and think, 'Oh, I've
always liked mechanical engineering so I
guess I'll do that.' " But it shouldn't be that
way, he insists.
We don't have to look for life. It chooses
us. We just wait. Everything will fall into
place on its own "if you wait to be told with
in yourself about what you want, it you lis
ten to yourself. You have to believe that."
I wonder if 1 do, but listening to the con
viction in his voice, it seems almost difficult
not to.
