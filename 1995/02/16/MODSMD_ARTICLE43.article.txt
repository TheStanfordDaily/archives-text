Jah man! Fire up the barbecue, crack open
a Red Stripe, and light up an enormous . ..
lawn torch. It's calypso time and three re-re
leased classics are on the menu.
Rah tate! These are not just Bob Marley or
Steel Pulse imitators. These are the original
artists who reggae greats based their careers
on. These are musicians who embody the
spirit of Jamaica and Carnival.
On the first of a series of vital reissues of
true "Caribbean Classics" by Ice Records,
Lord Melody's "Precious Melodies" (Vol. 1)

"Carribian Classics"
(Vols 1, 3, 4) Various artists

represents a percussion and guitar-based set
of tracks that has an energetic feel that man
ages to vary style in melody and vocal into
nation, though the subject matter of love re
mains constant throughout the album.
Stories of just about every conceivable rela
tionship dot the landscape of this release with
out vulgarity and with all of the carefree
Caribbean charm Lord Melody is known for.

His style and talcs
are so forward that he is
heard in front of the
music like few calypso
singers. This effect af
fords a jazzy sentiment
to some of the songs,
with musicians playing
rounds of well crafted
solos, an effect accom
plished in no calypso as

well as here.
In the words of author Kenith Q. Warner,
this is "calypso par excellence by a consum
mate practitioner of the art."
Lord Kitchener's "Klassic Kitchener" (Vol.
3) is an energetic collection that breaks away
from the other calypso releases by distin
guishing itself with a very full and, at times,
modern sound. The second track, "Pan in 'A'
Minor," is even reminiscent of the music
coming from the "Mambo Taxi" in Alrnod
ovar's "Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down."
Heavy on melodic steel drums, Lord
Kitchener practically achieves the Platonic
form of train dancing music. Line up and
prepare to shimmy. With sophisticated har
monic progressions and the crafty integra
tion of Kitchener's almost throaty singing
style, this is a sweet-sounding collection of
songs.
Mighty Sparrow's self titled release (Vol.
4) is the finest of the lot, creating a truly joy
ous atmosphere through its winding
melodies, emphasis on horns and rich
rhythm section.
The most successful calypso singer of all
time, Sparrow creates a montage of sound fit
for general, hip-shaking revelry. Sparrow
rests at the center of a long tradition that he
reveals brilliantly in this unpretentious tell
tale collection of feel-good Trinidadian
rhythms and rhymes. This music is fit for a
beach party or just as an alternative to Harry
Belafonte.
No matter how familiar you are with ca
lypso, as a collection of the greatest hits of
some of the most renowned Caribbean artists
of all time, these albums are sure to please.
