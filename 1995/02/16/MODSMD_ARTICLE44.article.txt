I knew if I prayed enough, God would
answer. And answer my eternal desire to
hear Jimmy Page and Robert Plant joined
together again God did. In "No Quarter,"
Page and Plant's first joint release since

"No Quarter"
Jimmy Page and Robert Plant

1979's "In Through the Out Door" — then
as leaders of the world's most renowned
rock band Led Zeppelin, for those of you
who grew up on Mars — these legendary
musicians have united their solo careers.
The sounds are sweet, harmonious and
ethnic. With an Egyptian ensemble of mu
sicians who back them up on such rare in
struments as a duf and bendir, this is true
incense-lighting, lava-lamp watching
music. Wherever the great dream of peace
and happiness fled to, Robert Plant and
Jimmy Page followed.
Most songs on "No Quarter" are re
makes of Zeppelin classics, but this is no
aging band covering itself in concert (many
of the tracks were recorded live). They are
original renditions that create, in some
sense, a entirely unique set of songs.

Of the new Plant/Page songs (not rendi
tions of classics) a clear distinction can be
drawn between those reminiscent of Zep
pelin and those that create a new form of
Middle Eastern rock. "Yallah" is a pulsat
ing, almost mantra-esque song that howls
out at you in a larger than life fashion. Un
fortunately it lacks the development and
subtle evolution of some of the other tracks
on "No Quarter." "City Don't Cry" clearly
shows it's Egyptian influence, relying heav
ily on traditional instruments and a hol
low, vocal sound. It is soft and subtle, mu
sical without an ounce of pretension.
The track "Wonderful One" is the clear
winner of the new songs. Mighty like the
feel of Zeppelin at their peak, yet acoustic
and soulful like Led at the beginning of
their career, this track is nothing less than
a new classic destined to go down as fa
vorite of Zeppelin lovers of all time.
Of the Zeppelin songs, one clear winner
is the title track "No Quarter." The sound is
haunting and Plant's voice eerily echoes
into a tightly emotional, though restrained
crescendo. And "Gallows Pole" sounds as
sweet, if not sweeter, than on the original
Zeppelin 111 release.
And how can one close without men
tioning Kashmir's new sound, as augment
ed and recreated by the Egyptian Ensem
ble? After a slightly grating introduction, it

slips into that familiar, yet evolved, Zep
pelin sound, moving on to become the
song it always wanted to be.
After years of leading separate lives,
Jimmy Page and Robert Plant have joined
forces once again — not as Led Zeppelin,
but as the heart and soul of that group

united in a new effort to recreate a sound
that no one ever has come close to imitat
ing.
This album marks the calendar with the
day the history books of rock have opened
to their favorite Page once again.
