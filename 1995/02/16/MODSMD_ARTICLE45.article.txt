## Charmingly apathetic â€” this truck doesn't need to run 
### 
Spending eight years spitting out twist
ed bits of Stones-flavored noise must be a
hard job, because Royal Trux sounds
worn-down, dirty and exhausted. Even
though "Thank You" is their major label

"Thank You"
Royal Trux

debut, the band's feel is far from fresh, and
that's a big part of their burnt-out charm.
"Thank You" has a mature and weath
ered feel, delivering a sturdy stream of
bluesy rock with an attitude that's confi
dent and aggressive, yet gritty and de
tached. Royal Trux is a band that's difficult
to relate to, and you get the idea that that's
the way they like it.
On the surface, "Thank You" appeals in a
very straightforward way, as a solid rock
album that can hold your attention and take
you for a ride. But during the course of that
ride you notice subtle surprises and peculiar
ities that draw you in, only to be then puzzled

by the band's apparent lack of intention.
The songs are edgy, messy and fun, as
the vocals of Neil Hagerty and Jennifer
Herrema combine in androgynous strains
and grunts over their layers of fiercely
wandering guitars.
"Ray O Vac" alternates friendly, repeti
tive grooves and jolting funk interruptions
with a style that's cleverly incoherent and
rewardingly vague. Similarly, the album's
final track "Shadow of the Wasp" offers a
satisfying taste of Royal Trux's varied in
tensity levels, disregarding consistency in
favor of hearty, feel-good excitement.
But when the songs don't quite work,
Royal Trux's ragged nonchalance becomes
frustrating and dry. Certain parts of the
album tend to drag, as they drift towards
standard Black Crowes-style retro rock.
In general, though, Royal Trux's
blurred and crooked drive full of aches and
pains sets them apart from the hordes of
other groups that are repackaging the
sounds of another decade. "Thank You"
offers a crustier and more scabbed inter
pretation of blues-rockers of the past, and
that's a really good thing.
