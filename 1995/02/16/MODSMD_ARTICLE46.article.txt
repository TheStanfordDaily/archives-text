Rock and roll is dead! Long live Her
Majesty the Baby!
After nine years in the underground, the
San Francisco hand Her Majesty the Baby has
released its first full-length album, "Mary,"
and the results are indeed impressive.
The band has a gift for producing a lush
sound which can hold tight rhythms and ele
gant phrases. The CD's most remarkable
song, "Curious," combines a staccato rhythm,

"Mary"
Her Majesty the B» h v .

guitar overkill and a flowing, graceful lyricism
into a surprisingly coherent whole.
Formerly an all-female band, Her Majesty
the Baby was unsigned for many years. Two
years ago when the bass player and drummer
left the band, Terri Winston and Lee Paiva —

the two remaining songwriters/vocalists —
decided to do it for themselves.
With the help of friends, they built a studio
from scratch, added three new members and
recorded and released their first album with
their own independent Homeless Music label.
However, while "Mary" is an impressive
first step, the band still has much ground to
cover musically. The lyrics rarely match the
music itself. At best, as on "Fendaya," it can be
amusing to listen to the singer try to fit the two
together. At worst, as on "Crash," the singing
becomes annoying and uselessly repetitive.
The main problem is that the band has lit
tle sense of how to swing, but that is a com
mon characteristic of many alternative bands.
Ironically, essential precursors of alternative
music today, such as the Velvet Underground
and the Clash, had an excellent sense of swing
and other fundamentals of rock and roll.
Without this sense, the band's lyrics will con
tinue to sound stilled and forced.

Still, the CD is definitely worth the price.
The music itself is quite developed. On "Res
urrection," for example, the added violin solo
achieves an admirable amount of pathos, not
characteristic of a hand's first CD.

Rock and roll may have died, but bands
like Her Majesty the Baby arc very capable of
leading the way to the future of popular
music.
