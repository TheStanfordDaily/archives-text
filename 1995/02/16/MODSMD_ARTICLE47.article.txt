Listening to Prick's self-titled debut from
Trent Reznor's label Nothing is a little like
piling seven-layer bean dip on a tortilla chip
— hard crunchiness smothered by a deli
cious heap of gook.
Prick's brutal, industrial-edged assault

"Prick"
Prick

feels like that: thick chaotic noise suffocating
tuneful melodies and riffs. The feedback and
samples overlap and mix until vocals and
guitars seem like they're drowning in the tan

gle. It works though; the crackly complexity
charges all the songs with energy.
The first track, "Communique," features
an immensely satisfying melody that sounds
as if it got caught in a sandstorm. Blistering,
scalding bursts of static blow over its surface.
Kevin MacMahon, vocalist and frontman for
Prick, deliriously steps up the intensity with
his reedy, hissing vocals.
Likewise, "Other People," a dance song on
amphetamines, races along with explosive
energy. The guitars, vocals and drums over
reach until they swamp themselves. The song
clicks off at its loudest, fastest point, the sud
den quiet hitting like a brick wall.
Prick has this talent: to tease with one
sound only to foil expectations with another.

The dynamic "No Fair Fights" begins with
uncommon restraint. A quiet piano accom
panies McMahon's quavering voice through
spooky synth effects. Then Prick unleashes
scalding noise that breaks the melody apart
into pieces. The wonderful end with its muf
fled vocals and intermittent static sounds like
broken equipment, not music.
The dance-happy blaze of "1 Got It Bad" is
easier to take, even though dissonance creeps

at its edge. Even the bouncy,
appealing "1 Apologize"
with its acoustic guitar can't
help but climb eventually
into Prick's characteristic
noisy gook.
Finally, with brilliant
eeriness, Prick ends with the
moody, "Makebelieve," in
which the sound of a pipe
dragging down stairs blurs

into devil voice effects and static-laden
screams of "Mommy!"
Despite the horror movie sound bites,
Prick seems to take itself seriously. The com
plex and multi-layered bouts of tunelessness
occur in all the right moments. No song
sounds like any other. It's music to scare your
parents with. It's music to take the paint off
your walls.
