The selling point: no samples... 100 per
cent homegrown ... bare.
The Roots debut release, "Do you want
more?!!!??!," is neither a tribute to the "old
skool" nor the "new old skool." Rather, the
recognition the group pays its predecessors is
disguised in simplicity. This Philadelphia-

"Do You Want More?!!!??!"

The Roots

based rap group takes unadulterated musical
creativity into the studio.
Drummer Ahmir-Khalib Thompson
(Brother Question), rapper Tariq Trotter
(Black Thought), who plays the part of "live
D.J.," and bassist Josh Abrams break away
from standard rap conventions with musical
ingenuity.
And you thought all rappers were misogy
nists. Part of what gives "Do you want
more?!!!??!" a dynamic feel is the collective ef
fort of the group and guest artists, including

the poet Ursula Rucker, who adds a dimen
sion of thought-provoking political con
sciousness to the album.
When she speaks lines like "got his stuff
caught in a death cunt clutch/.. ./see, y'all all
fuck with my pussy hut I'll fuck with your
minds/lack of soul and respect is the crime,"
we understand that the Roots aren't looking
to further the myth of the rapper-dog.
Compared to the rest of the lyrically be
nign album, this song stands apart. The rap
ping is smooth and solid, but not jarring.
Brother Question et al. distinguish them
selves by their live sound. Just like early Tribe
and De La are still exciting, the minimalist
hip hop of the Roots will be worth listening
to long after the promo buzz dies.
A trite but true testament to the statement
"less is more," the Roots use memories of
Doug E. Fresh, Schoolly-D, and Biz Markie to
generate and innovate. Unlike many hip-hop
groups who hide their lack of talent with ef
fusive sampling, the Roots accomplish what
many "contemporary urban artists" shy away
from: improvisational, live music.
