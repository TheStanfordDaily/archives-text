# The 						closet as a stage
## A 						gay film of too much convenience Yuen Ping Low 
### 
Life is a stage — the closet, its prisoner;
hidden desires, its artificial demeanors. And
what would one do without a healthy dose of
Oscar Wilde thrown in for good measure?
Middle-aged bus conductor Alfie Byrne
(Albert Finney) not only harbors clandes

tine affections for his cute driver Robbie
(Rufus Sewell), their regular passengers
even provide the amateur talent for Alfie's
dream production of "Salome," Wilde's play
that dares not speak its name.
The threat to Alfie's ambitions looms

large in the shape of
sister l.ily (Brenda
Fricker) and bible
toting neighbor Mr.
Carney (Michael
Gambon) — the
latter is so outraged
by the play's blas
phemous under
pinnings that Mr.
Carney conspires to
turn the cast against
its director, and
persuades the local
priests to cancel the
group's rehearsals
on church premises.
A neat package in
deed, director Suri

Krishnamma's debut feature

defies its viewer to resist its immediate
charms: the postcard-perfect Dublin back
drop, the evocative use of Cole Porter tunes,
the virtuoso turns by veterans Finney, Gam
bon and pricker, the heart-tugging narrative
of societal marginalization, and even the ap
propriate quirks of its misfit figures.

A Man of No Importance

Yet, the film's central premise remains
problematic. It is one thing to adhere to the
relevant conventions of its period setting, but
it is another matter altogether to insist upon a
perversely prudish stand for purposes of gen
erating pathos. Although Alfie tenderly be
friends the winsome Adele (Tara Fitzgerald)
who agrees to play Princess Salome, his hor
ror-stricken reaction afterward to her person
al life earns chuckles for childlike innocence
but few marks for character credibility
While set in the swinging '60s, the film's

cautious take on its trag- I
ic gay hero resonates I
more with the Victorian
sensibilities that indict-

Ed Alfie's idol — Wilde — almost a century
before. Indeed, the quintessential long-suf
fering homosexual is alive and well on cellu
loid to this day. Like his predecessors of
kindly bachelors and chatty hairdressers,
the novelty value of Alfie is grounded more
in noble propriety than natural instinct.
Consider the self-defeating essence of
Alfie's coming out process — for a man
who delights in the wicked proclivities of
"Salome," Alfie's vehement proclamation of
his sexual inexperience to Lily rings hollow.
When he finally shows up at a cruising bar
decked out in full Wildean regalia, the re
ward Alfie receives for asserting his long
suppressed identity is a nasty bout of bash
ing in a darkened alley.
So excruciatingly over-wrought with
pain and pity, Alfie's trials and tribulations
in "A Man of No Importance" are fashioned
as though the New Queer Cinema had never
happened.
