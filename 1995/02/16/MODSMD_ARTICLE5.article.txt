# Stanford Fund plan
## 
### 
Ways for student groups to earn alumni support
and conduct external fundraising under the
new proposal:
• Earn direct allocations of alumni gifts already I
raised by the University through the Recog
nized Student Organization (RSO)/Stanfora
Fund Partnership.
• Solicit gifts from alumni and other off-campus
sources by working through the University's
Office of Development in the RSO/Office of De
velopment Partnership.
• The Director of Student Activities and Direc
tor of Student Development will consider other
situations on a case-by-case basis.
