# Stone tries her luck out west
## 
### 
In a small town called Redemption, the
skankiest outlaws and gunslingers come face
to face for the Quick Draw competition to
find out just who deserves the title of fastest
gun in the West. Sam Raimi's "The Quick
and the Dead" evokes a world where you can
tell a real man by the size of his spurs. A
smooth blend of comedy and drama, this
flick is pure entertainment.
Sharon Stone stars as Ellen (alias the
"Lady"), a tough broad with a quick tongue

and an even quicker Colt. But despite the
grime and leather covering her from head to
toe, Stone still exudes her trademark sex ap
peal. "The Quick and the Dead" noticeably
lacks the romantic interludes that we've
come to expect from Stone's films, yet
Raimi's approach is refreshingly simple. In
stead of keeping us guessing which of Stone's
body parts will be exposed next, he only hints
at the sensual woman who lies beneath the
hard veneer.
Although entirely appropriate for her
character, Stone's acting style is entertaining
but cheesy. Gene Hackman gives a wonderful
performance as Herod, the evil gun who
rules Redemption with a callous iron fist.
Equally delightful are Russell Crowe as Rev

erend Cort, a reformed outlaw, and Leonar
do DiCaprio as the Kid. DiCaprio ("What's
Eating Gilbert Grape") steals several scenes
with his playful antics and boyish charm.

The Quick and the Dead

Raimi, who also directed "Darkman" has
a great deal of fun with "The Quick and the
Dead." Mocking its own hammy theatrics,
the film plays with his characteristic psyche
delic camera angles and super-imposed im
ages. Every stereotype of the Old West is
played to the hilt — the bad guys wear black,

the card players
lie, and someone
is constantly
being hung, shot
or beaten to a
bloody pulp. Yet
in spite of it all,
the film has rare
moments of seri
ousness — so
carefully execut
ed, they almost
bring tears to

your eyes. These
scenes, crafted with honesty and clarity, save
the film from its own quick death.
