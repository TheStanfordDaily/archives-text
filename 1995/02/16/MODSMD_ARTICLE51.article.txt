# A 						rhapsodic affair to remember
## 
### 
It's almost a Woody Allen rip-off.
"Miami Rhapsody" opens with a close-up
of Gwyn (Sarah Jessica Parker) delivering a
candid monologue. Within the first 30 sec
onds, we know about her penchant for
gourmet hair care products, her barren-but
hopefully-not-for-long sex life and her cynical
attitude towards relationships. Watching this

Miami Rhapsody

neurotic rambling, I started to convulse in my
red velour theater seat with "Annie Hall"
flashbacks. But when Gwyn failed to quote
Groucho Marx, I decided against writing the
flick off as a mere "Annie" impersonator. I re
mained in the theater and watched on.
I'm glad 1 stayed put.
"Miami Rhapsody" documents how rela
tionships bloom with immediate passion and
rot with refusals to make compromises. And it
does so with style, humility and an uninten
tionally hilarious acting debut by über-model
Naomi Campbell.
We see Gwyn, a sharp-tongued and sexy
advertising copywriter, get engaged to Matt

(Gil Bellows), a whoa-momma Adonis of a
primate researcher. She is ga-ga for the guy but
not at the expense of going koo-koo. Although
Gwyn is a romantic with an affinity for pink
satin underwire bras, she doesn't let the gooey
French kisses or occasions to break out the di
aphragm infect her rationality. She manages
to stay detached and pensive as she assesses the
relationships of her loved ones ... which all
seem to be falling apart.
At her sister's wedding, Gwyn's father (Paul
Mazurksy) expresses his suspicions of marital
disloyalty. At an outdoor shopping center, her
mother (Mia Farrow) admits that she's been
having an affair with a mucho machismo
Cuban nurse (Antonio Banderas). At her
brother's pad, she discovers that he (Kevin
Pollak) has been having an affair with his busi
ness partner's wife (Naomi Campbell). At a
restaurant, she meets her father's anguished
ex-lover. At home, Gwyn walks into her sister
having an afternoon romp with someone she
didn't exchange vows with at her recent wed
ding. There seems to be a trend here.
Gwyn starts to look at these affairs and squab
bles as inevitable by-products of long-term rela
tionships and begins to reassess her upcoming
marriage. Eventually, she decides that she isn't

ready to make the compromises needed for mar
riage with Matt to work. So, in the one clumsy
and contrived scene in the movie, they split.
"Miami Rhapsody" handles the loaded
subject of love with a light knowingness that
hasn't been in theaters much in recent years.
The heroine isn't a martyr or a slave of squalid
hunger. She's just a sensible, modern chick
who refuses to rose-tint romance. Sarah Jessi-

ca Parker, biting her nails under her Aveda
drenched ringlets throughout the movie,
plays the neurotic romantic well with her
sharply honest opinions and gentle coos.
No, "Miami Rhapsody" is not an Allen rip
off. Rather, it is a film that combines the lyri
cal candor of "Annie Hall" with the skepticism
of'9os romance.
