Before the Rain
Milcho Manchevski's award-winning
feature debut, "Before the Rain,"
opens at a monastery in Macedonia,
where Kiril, a young monk played by
Gregoire Colin encounters Zamira
(Labina Mitevska), a mysterious Al
banian girl hidden in his room. While
communication is challenged by his
vow of silence, the two find under
standing and love — before a
bloody tragedy ends "Words," part
one of this compelling, three part
drama.
In "Faces" and "Pictures," we en
counter London-based photo editor
Anne (Katrin Cartlidge), her lover,
war photographer Aleksandar
Kirkov (Rade Serbedzija), Anne's
self-effacing husband Nick (Jay Vil
liers), and an assortment of Mace
donian and Albanian villagers from
Aleksandar's youth.
Beautifully shot, "Before the Rain" is
a circular narrative that makes use of

three simple stories to explore the
pitfalls of ethnic conflict in the former
Yugoslavia. This is no fatalistic tale.
The narrative opens itself up to hope
and, we're left with the indelible
power of possibility.
Before Sunrise
This flick about a one night stand in
Vienna is, well, nice. That's it. No
lascivious pick-up lines. No hyper
kinky sex scenes. No über-breasts.
No extra-wet willies. Just sensible
dialogue. And that's what makes
"Before Sunrise" such a charming
endorphin rush.
Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is a goateed
American armed with a Eurail pass
and riddled with Euro-boredom.
When Celine (Julie Oelpy), a lus
cious-lipped French student on her
return trip to Paris, sits down next
to him on the train, Jesse strikes up
a conversation. They immediately
hit it off. Then, Jesse makes his
move. He asks Celine to postpone
her trip to Paris and embark on a
spontaneous one-day tour of Vien
na with him before he returns to the
States.
Director Richard Linklater ("Slack
er," "Dazed and Confused") follows
the couple as they wander in Vien
na. For 24 hours, Jesse and Celine
paint the town fuschia in a tender ex
position of how a chance encounter
blossoms into romance. It lacks gut
wrenching melodrama and air
brushed glamour and is thick with
honesty, much like real life.
Boys on the Side
This film more than exceeds imme
diate expectations. Actresses
Whoopi Goldberg, Mary-Louise
Parker and Drew Barrymore pull off
their three-way relationship with
style, joining seriousness and slap
stick with style.
The story begins with Jane (Gold-

berg), a self-proclaimed "lesbo" de
cides a move to Los Angeles is in
order. Enter Robin (Parker), a naive,
repressed woman who intends to
relive her childhood by driving
cross-country to San Diego. Along
the way, the duo picks up Holly
(Barrymore) — the childish, abused
girlfriend who can twist men around
any finger she chooses.
"Boys" is a film about coming to
terms with yourself and those
around you. Directed by Herbert
Ross, "Boys" manages to avoid the
Hollywood style of either overly
happy or overiy-dramatic endings,
leaving the simplicity of the story to
speak for itself. The feminist and
gay-rights messages of the film are
evident but not overwhelming; the
three women and their relationships
matter more than the issues sur
rounding them.
The Boys of St. Vincent, Parts I
&II
Few atrocities induce bystanders to
squirm as uncomfortably as the no
tion of child abuse. The makers of
The Boys of St. Vincent" does not
shy away from organized religion ei
ther. The two-part film deals un
flinchingly with the sexual and physi
cal assault of children by Roman
Catholic clergymen.
Brother Peter Lavin (Henry Czerny),
is the main perpetrator of evil at the
St. Vincent orphanage. Fifteen years
later the child-molester-turned-lov
ing-father-of-two now faces charges
in a much-belated court inquiry. The
second half movingly sketches the
divergent developments of the
youthfully scarred lives of Steven
(David Hewlett) and Brian Lunny
(Timothy Webber), two orphaned
brothers who have lost contact for
over a decade. Kevin Reevey (Se
bastian Spence) also struggles, de
ciding if he should take the witness

stand.
Writer-director John N. Smith refus
es the convenience of scapegoating
homosexuality to explain unhealthy
psyches exacerbated by tyrannical
vows of clerical celibacy, all laid out
in quietly disturbing terms that con
front child eroticism without resort
ing to gratuitously graphic means.
Death and the Maiden
Nothing attempted by Roman
Polanski in recent memory — "Fran
tic," "Bitter Moon" — quite prepares
one for the sheer suspense-ridden
mastery of his latest film "Death and
the Maiden." Artfully tempered with
the psychology of human conflict
and provocative questions about the
delivery of justice, the adaptation of
Chilean Ariel Dorfman's heralded
play starring Sigourney Weaver and
Ben Kingsley breathes life into the
buried ghosts of a diabolical political
order.
Confined largely to the interiors of
the Escobars' home and spanning a
time period of no more than nine
hours over one night, "Death and
the Maiden" is made to rely purely
on the strength of its three actors,
the quality of Dorfman's script, and
Polanski's once-undisputed pen
chant for relentless cinematic ten
sion. Thanks to Polanski's timely re
covery of form, "Repulsion" and
"Chinatown" have finally found a
worthy successor.
Murder In the first
Alcatraz. We all know it as a major
tourist attraction in San Francisco,
but less than 30 years ago it was
home to the meanest, toughest
cons in the country. Based on the
true story of Henry Young (Kevin
Bacon) — an inmate at Alcatraz who
suffered horrific tortures at the
hands of the prison system — Marc
Rocco's "Murder in the First" is a

half-hearted attempt at a courtroom
drama.
"Murder" could have succeeded
had the script been less trite and
less predictable. Young's story is
tragic and compelling, but cheap
platitudes like, "I don't need a
lawyer. I need a friend" are distract
ing. "Murder in the First" lacks the
chemistry and tension needed to
make the film work. The nauseating
scenes of brutality leave the theater
with you, but there is not much else
to be remembered.
Queen Margot
At times brutal, occasionally
poignant, but never at any point
more than a heartbeat away from its
willful streak of romanticism, Patrice
Ch6reau's film is further testimony
to the French flair for the sweeping
period epic.
The most fascinating relationship in
the 150-minute existentialist soap
opera is never the torrid but ulti
mately conventionally-structured li
aison between Margot (Isabelle Ad
jani) and her lover La M6le (Vincent
Perez). The pre-arranged political
marriage between Catholic Margot
and Protestant Henri de Navarre
(Daniel Auteuil) is never about love
in traditional terms, yet a basic de
cency — unfazed by adultery on
both sides and blood-soaked family
strife — pervades to entrench the
pair in mutual loyalty.
Gutsy, bawdy and always pulsating
with life — thanks to the energetic
cinematography of Oscar-winning
Philippe Roussellot — this is one un
dead retelling of history which may
catch the uninitiated off guard. One
may choose to take offense at the
film's liberties with factual accuracy
and frequently gory depictions of
physical and political violence. Or
one can be very grateful to the
French.

Beautifully shot, "Before the Rain" is
a circular narrative that makes use of

three simple stories to explore the
pitfalls of ethnic conflict in the former
Yugoslavia. This is no fatalistic tale.
The narrative opens itself up to hope
and, we're left with the indelible
power of possibility.
Before Sunrise
This flick about a one night stand in
Vienna is, well, nice. That's it. No
lascivious pick-up lines. No hyper
kinky sex scenes. No über-breasts.
No extra-wet willies. Just sensible
dialogue. And that's what makes
"Before Sunrise" such a charming
endorphin rush.
Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is a goateed
American armed with a Eurail pass
and riddled with Euro-boredom.
When Celine (Julie Oelpy), a lus
cious-lipped French student on her
return trip to Paris, sits down next
to him on the train, Jesse strikes up
a conversation. They immediately
hit it off. Then, Jesse makes his
move. He asks Celine to postpone
her trip to Paris and embark on a
spontaneous one-day tour of Vien
na with him before he returns to the
States.
Director Richard Linklater ("Slack
er," "Dazed and Confused") follows
the couple as they wander in Vien
na. For 24 hours, Jesse and Celine
paint the town fuschia in a tender ex
position of how a chance encounter
blossoms into romance. It lacks gut
wrenching melodrama and air
brushed glamour and is thick with
honesty, much like real life.
Boys on the Side
This film more than exceeds imme
diate expectations. Actresses
Whoopi Goldberg, Mary-Louise
Parker and Drew Barrymore pull off
their three-way relationship with
style, joining seriousness and slap
stick with style.
The story begins with Jane (Gold-

berg), a self-proclaimed "lesbo" de
cides a move to Los Angeles is in
order. Enter Robin (Parker), a naive,
repressed woman who intends to
relive her childhood by driving
cross-country to San Diego. Along
the way, the duo picks up Holly
(Barrymore) — the childish, abused
girlfriend who can twist men around
any finger she chooses.
"Boys" is a film about coming to
terms with yourself and those
around you. Directed by Herbert
Ross, "Boys" manages to avoid the
Hollywood style of either overly
happy or overiy-dramatic endings,
leaving the simplicity of the story to
speak for itself. The feminist and
gay-rights messages of the film are
evident but not overwhelming; the
three women and their relationships
matter more than the issues sur
rounding them.
The Boys of St. Vincent, Parts I
&II
Few atrocities induce bystanders to
squirm as uncomfortably as the no
tion of child abuse. The makers of
The Boys of St. Vincent" does not
shy away from organized religion ei
ther. The two-part film deals un
flinchingly with the sexual and physi
cal assault of children by Roman
Catholic clergymen.
Brother Peter Lavin (Henry Czerny),
is the main perpetrator of evil at the
St. Vincent orphanage. Fifteen years
later the child-molester-turned-lov
ing-father-of-two now faces charges
in a much-belated court inquiry. The
second half movingly sketches the
divergent developments of the
youthfully scarred lives of Steven
(David Hewlett) and Brian Lunny
(Timothy Webber), two orphaned
brothers who have lost contact for
over a decade. Kevin Reevey (Se
bastian Spence) also struggles, de
ciding if he should take the witness

stand.
Writer-director John N. Smith refus
es the convenience of scapegoating
homosexuality to explain unhealthy
psyches exacerbated by tyrannical
vows of clerical celibacy, all laid out
in quietly disturbing terms that con
front child eroticism without resort
ing to gratuitously graphic means.
Death and the Maiden
Nothing attempted by Roman
Polanski in recent memory — "Fran
tic," "Bitter Moon" — quite prepares
one for the sheer suspense-ridden
mastery of his latest film "Death and
the Maiden." Artfully tempered with
the psychology of human conflict
and provocative questions about the
delivery of justice, the adaptation of
Chilean Ariel Dorfman's heralded
play starring Sigourney Weaver and
Ben Kingsley breathes life into the
buried ghosts of a diabolical political
order.
Confined largely to the interiors of
the Escobars' home and spanning a
time period of no more than nine
hours over one night, "Death and
the Maiden" is made to rely purely
on the strength of its three actors,
the quality of Dorfman's script, and
Polanski's once-undisputed pen
chant for relentless cinematic ten
sion. Thanks to Polanski's timely re
covery of form, "Repulsion" and
"Chinatown" have finally found a
worthy successor.
Murder In the first
Alcatraz. We all know it as a major
tourist attraction in San Francisco,
but less than 30 years ago it was
home to the meanest, toughest
cons in the country. Based on the
true story of Henry Young (Kevin
Bacon) — an inmate at Alcatraz who
suffered horrific tortures at the
hands of the prison system — Marc
Rocco's "Murder in the First" is a

half-hearted attempt at a courtroom
drama.
"Murder" could have succeeded
had the script been less trite and
less predictable. Young's story is
tragic and compelling, but cheap
platitudes like, "I don't need a
lawyer. I need a friend" are distract
ing. "Murder in the First" lacks the
chemistry and tension needed to
make the film work. The nauseating
scenes of brutality leave the theater
with you, but there is not much else
to be remembered.
Queen Margot
At times brutal, occasionally
poignant, but never at any point
more than a heartbeat away from its
willful streak of romanticism, Patrice
Ch6reau's film is further testimony
to the French flair for the sweeping
period epic.
The most fascinating relationship in
the 150-minute existentialist soap
opera is never the torrid but ulti
mately conventionally-structured li
aison between Margot (Isabelle Ad
jani) and her lover La M6le (Vincent
Perez). The pre-arranged political
marriage between Catholic Margot
and Protestant Henri de Navarre
(Daniel Auteuil) is never about love
in traditional terms, yet a basic de
cency — unfazed by adultery on
both sides and blood-soaked family
strife — pervades to entrench the
pair in mutual loyalty.
Gutsy, bawdy and always pulsating
with life — thanks to the energetic
cinematography of Oscar-winning
Philippe Roussellot — this is one un
dead retelling of history which may
catch the uninitiated off guard. One
may choose to take offense at the
film's liberties with factual accuracy
and frequently gory depictions of
physical and political violence. Or
one can be very grateful to the
French.
Before the Rain
Milcho Manchevski's award-winning
feature debut, "Before the Rain,"
opens at a monastery in Macedonia,
where Kiril, a young monk played by
Gregoire Colin encounters Zamira
(Labina Mitevska), a mysterious Al
banian girl hidden in his room. While
communication is challenged by his
vow of silence, the two find under
standing and love — before a
bloody tragedy ends "Words," part
one of this compelling, three part
drama.
In "Faces" and "Pictures," we en
counter London-based photo editor
Anne (Katrin Cartlidge), her lover,
war photographer Aleksandar
Kirkov (Rade Serbedzija), Anne's
self-effacing husband Nick (Jay Vil
liers), and an assortment of Mace
donian and Albanian villagers from
Aleksandar's youth.
Beautifully shot, "Before the Rain" is
a circular narrative that makes use of

three simple stories to explore the
pitfalls of ethnic conflict in the former
Yugoslavia. This is no fatalistic tale.
