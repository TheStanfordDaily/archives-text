# Grub Focus on: Alice's
## 
### Chris Levinson 
So, I got lost. Again. Alice's is strategically
tucked into the trees of Woodside, at a pause
in the road and next to a no-name car garage.
Yeah, it's a drive. Read on, and then you tell
me if it's worth it.
First call, fight for a cowhide booth. When
the weather gets warmer, I'd move outside to
the patio for the sun and a bird's eye view of
the Harleys dotting the front lot like a picket
fence. But for now, the red checked table
cloths of the booths beckon — and I'm hun
gry-
"Not much for vegetarians," says friend
B. It's hard to make out his whine over The
Steve Miller Band's "Jungle I.ove" seeping
out from behind a Moose head hanging on
the wall. He's quickly soothed by a glass of
Woodside Vineyard Pinot Noir ($5.50) and
a generous portion of bread products.
"It's going to be seasonal," quips chef
Fiona on a trip out from the kitchen. The
crab cakes with lemon caper aioli ($6.95) and
shrimp and avocado quesadillas with jack

cheese, salsa and sour cream ($5.95) attest to
that, drawing on the warm themes of a lin
gering winter. The place has potential, and
Fiona's total overhaul of the menu brings it
that much closer.
It depends on the weather, she claims. "Up
here, everything depends." Tonight, that in
cludes the food. While my pasta (a special
tonight) was a successful — if not surprising
— blend of capilini with tomato, garlic and
capers flecked with rock shrimp (a pricey
$12.95), B's linguini ($10.95) suffered be

neath a blue cheese sauce that couldn't decide
whether to be subtle or bold and rested flatly
in between.
Scent of roast chicken ($12.50) wafts over
from the next booth, along with a Wings'
tune. All right, maybe I turned to stare, but
the stuffing — a mix of ricotta, basil and red
bell pepper sauce demanded it. All entrees
come with an opening act, choice of soup or
salad, and I'm just finishing off my greens
when I get a fleeting glimpse of the warm
spinach salad ($11.95) topped with grilled

chicken, feta cheese, honey pecans and red
onions, a warm twist on a classic (alas, it was
too late). Next time I vow to be more daring.
Maybe the prawns and coconut curry
($12.95) or the pork chops with apple,
pineapple and raisin chutney over butter
milk and garlic mashed potatoes ($12.95).
Next time.
Most people head to Alice's for weekend
brunch, where from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. you can
get the usual — pancakes, omelets, and the
morning injection of caffeine along with the
Sunday Times. But dinner has its own follow
ing. Saturday nights there's live music... and
dessert. Skip the store-bought chocolate
torte and opt instead for a scoop of whole
walnuts tossed in cinnamon, brown sugar,
nutmeg and other sweetness laid to rest
under the folds of a thin crust (all desserts
$3.50). Then there's always the apple pie
warmed just enough to melt that side of
vanilla bean ice cream. And the coffee's still
brewing this side of noon.
It's an eclectic hit-and-miss scoring bonus
points for atmosphere. The winding road
from campus to Woodside is like a ticket to
another world. The air is cooler, time moves
differently. This is only Fiona's first week at
the helm of Alice's, and given time the kinks
will smooth out as well as those cowhide
booths.
