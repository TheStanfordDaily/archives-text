# Layoffs part of plans for Children's Hospital

As a result of health care
changes and budget reductions
at Lucile Salter Packard Chil
dren's Hospital, officials said
workers will be laid off as the
hospital conducts budget exami
nations of every department.
Thirty-five food service work
ers will be laid off in March as
the Children's Hospital com
bines its food service with the
adjacent Stanford Hospital. The
workers will be eligible for 14
new positions created at the
Stanford Hospital as a result of
the change, said Shelley Her-

Bert, director of communica
tions for the Children's Hospi
tal.
The cafeteria will continue
operating as it does now except
that Children's Hospital pa
tients will have their meals pre
pared in the larger kitchens at
the Stanford Hospital for trans
port to the Children's Hospital.
The layoffs are part of the
hospital's "Work Redesign"
process which started last sum
mer and examines all services
for their cost-effectiveness. The
hospital is midway through the
project and is now examining
each service individually.
"There will be more layoffs,"
Herbert said, "but probably no
large-scale layoffs. The real
number is just speculation."
Employees are nervous
about whose jobs will be cut
next. "We're really still up in
the air," Kim Griffen, vice
president of the union repre
senting Packard and Stanford
Hospitals, told the Palo Alto
Weekly. "People are just hys
terical. They know there will be
layoffs."
The hospital is trimming $18
million from its annual expen
ditures of $109 million, but the
cuts may increase after further
evaluation.
In order to ensure the Chil
dren's Hospital's future, the
hospital is not only cutting
costs but also increasing busi
ness volume, Herbert said.
The Children's Hospital has
just performed its first three
kidney transplants since a team
of doctors from San Francisco
transferred their kidney and
liver transplant work to the
hospital.
In addition, the Children's
Hospital will be operating a

nursery at Washington Hospi
tal in Fremont. The nursery
will be opening this spring.
Health care changes, espe
cially budget cuts similar to
those at the Children's Hospi
tal, are happening in many Cal
ifornia hospitals.
Stanford Hospital, for exam
ple, has been eliminating posi
tions and reducing costs since
1991 and plans to reduce its
budget by $25 million for this
year.
"All health care providers
need to bring their costs down,"
Herbert said. "Our costs need
to be comparable to other pedi
atric providers, otherwise
health plans will send kids else
where."
Due to California's high
health care costs, some insur
ance carriers have flown chil
dren to the East Coast for
transplant operations because
even with housing and trans
portation costs the treatment is
less expensive, Herbert said.
"The larger context is the
fact that we're trying to ensure
children in Northern California
access to pediatric care," Her
bert said, "even though the
health care environment pres
sure is greater than ever before.
"We want to make sure
there's always a Packard [Chil
dren's Hospital] to turn to."
