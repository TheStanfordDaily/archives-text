# Chappie fight over pending senate okay
## Pub Board space conflict nears end 
### Kyung Lee Contributing Writer 
The ASSU committee formed
to settle a space-allocation dispute
in Storke Publications Building fi
nally resolved the long-standing
conflict between the Stanford
Chaparral and the ASSU Publica
tions Board yesterday.
At Wednesday's meeting, both
the Pub Board and Chaparral
agreed to a new proposal for the
building's space allocation, re
placing the Pub Board's Facilities
and Space Committee's previous
proposal, said Richard Barnett,
editor of the Journal of Interna

tional Affairs and a member of the
committee.
Under the agreement, the
Chaparral will give one of the four
rooms it occupies upstairs in
Storke to The Stanford Review. A
second room will be shared with
the Quad yearbook, said a mem
ber of the ASSU committee.
The dispute began several
months ago when the Pub Board
decided to reallocate space for stu
dent publications as ordered by
ASSU Senate bylaws.
Chaparral staff members, how
ever, claimed they held historic
rights to the space, resulting in

The dispute over Chaparral office space — which includes four rooms In the Storke
Publications building — reached a resolution yesterday, pending senate approval.
heated disputes.
When junior Danny Bressler,
director of the Pub Board,
responded by suspending the
Chaparral and taking away their
right to vote on Pub Board mat
ters, Council of Presidents mem
bers claimed Bressler had acted
inappropriately and demanded
his resignation. Bressler
remained as director, but the
issue was far from resolved.
The Pub Board sought the
University's help. Nanci Howe,
director of the Office of Student
Activities, in turn, directed them
to the COP.
"The University wasn't com
ing down one way or the other.
The Chappie went to Howe, but
Howe went to the ASSU," said
Barnett. "This issue is not in the
purview of the ASSU or the Pub
Board. Instead, the University

should have been clear about
their stance from the beginning."
On Jan. 9, Chaparral Editor
Chris Onstad proposed allocating
the communal space downstairs
and moving the Quad and Stan
ford Directory upstairs.
The Pub Board Space Com
mittee's proposal, which ulti
mately failed to pass the Board's
approval, had proposed moving
the communal space next to the
Chaparral's business office. Cha
parral staff members believed
this threatened the Chaparral's
space and security, Onstad said.
Onstad said the Pub Board
Space Committee's proposal —
allocating the Chappie's dark
room to The Review and the lay
out room to the Journal of Inter
national Affairs and Real News
— was "not in the best interest of
the Board."
"[Bressler] wasn't making
anyone else compromise except
the Chappie," he said.
"By offering half of our space,
we were making a gesture to

show that we were willing to
compromise," Onstad said. He
added that the Chaparral's pro
posal offered the same amount of
space as the space committee's.
Chaparral alumni also lobbied
the members of the committee to
gain their support, Bressler said.
Yesterday, representatives
agreed to the main points of
Onstad's proposal, including the
matters about the communal
space, the Quad and the Directo
ry, Barnett said.
"The Chappie will apologize to
Bressler, maybe through The
Daily, and in the future, will obey
bylaws and allocate space for the
Pub Board," he said.
Barnett said that other details
like the cost of moving and
installing new locks are being
negotiated.
The proposal must first pass
through the ASSU Senate, which
meets two weeks from now.
"Everything's sort of said and
done. It's up to the senate to
make the final decision," said

COP Member Anietie Ekanem.
"I'm optimistic at this point in
the short run but very disap
pointed overall. This is more
proof that students can't govern
themselves," Onstad said. "It
shouldn't have taken nearly as
long."
If the senate approves, the
proposal will go into effect on
May 1.
According to Barnett, the dis
pute has left "lingering frustra
tions" and has undermined the
Pub Board's "effectiveness as a
separate, independent entity."
"Now, any group who has a
problem with the board can
appeal to the ASSU Senate. The
University should not be so
unclear in these kinds of issues,"
he said. "By being unclear, they
weaken independent groups."
