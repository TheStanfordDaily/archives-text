# New Admit Weekend prepares to go academic
## 
### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
As spring arrives, Elise Maar and
Cindy Lai are hard at work readying
campus for the annual invasion of
prospective frosh — but this year with a
new twist.
Maar, assistant director of admis
sions, and Lai, general coordinator of
the event, are designing the first-ever
Stanford Admit Weekend, scheduled for
April 20-23.
The weekend event will be "a better,

more impressive event" than its prede
cessor, Prospective Freshman Week,
Maar said.
Although the event is still "very
much in the planning stage," it will in
clude a number of changes from last
year's program, Lai said.
This year, Lai said the intent of the
program is to "emphasize [the Universi
ty's! academic resources." The plan is to
add more academic and intellectual pro
grams, as well as to highlight the ac
complishments of current Stanford stu
dents, she added.

A presentation from the Honors Col
lege Program, lab tours of the science
buildings and special lectures by profes
sors are among the academic events
planned for the weekend. Student pre
sentations, including subjects such as
research projects, are also being
planned.
Professors will also teach special one
day courses geared toward prospective
freshmen. This is "going to give them
experience... with Stanford teachers,"
Maar said.
Since Maar said she expects students

to arrive Thursday afternoon, admits
will be given copies of time schedules for
the day so they can observe Stanford
classes.
The weekend will also be "keeping
the best aspects" of Pro Fro Week, Lai
said. Fun events, like a performing arts
night and a barbecue, are in the works.
In addition, the weekend will no
longer cost prospective freshmen any
money. In the past, admits were
charged $25 for meals, but this year the
cost was subsidized by the Uni
versity President and Provost's
Office, Maar said.
So far, dorm and house coor
dinator applications have
already been turned in, Lai
said, and host applications will
be out within the next week.
Changes in the parent pro
gram are also expected. The
admits' parents will have a
lounge where they can talk to
other parents and professors.

There will also be a larger
reception for all the parents.
Many of the events that are
planned will be easily accessible
to parents as well, Maar said.
Pro Fro Week was changed
to the weekend format for two
reasons: to make it more inclu
sive and less taxing on students
and faculty, Maar said.
Unlike previous years, orga
nizers of the admit weekend
are "not necessarily going to
come up with a theme," Maar
said. Event coordinators are,
however, looking for someone
to design the logo for the pro
gram.
