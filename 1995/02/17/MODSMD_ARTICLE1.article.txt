As administrators prepare to support the Stanford
Fund proposal, some student groups highly dependent
upon alumni donations said yesterday that the new pol
icy would not affect them overall.
"It's not going to change anything," said Tom Bara
nowski, president of the Inter-Fraternity Council.
"Fraternities and sororities don't technically solicit
[alumni] for money."
He said that fraternities receive support from their
national organizations and alumni who solicit money
from other alumni.
"We were kind of outside the rules. I would assume
that we would still be outside the rules," Baranowski
said.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said yesterday that she
and University President Gerhard Casper both sup
port the new plan.
"We think the committee has done a wonderful job.
The students and the Development Office have come
up with a [good plan). We are both prepared to give it a
try," Rice said.
