# Little effect predicted for Fund policy
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
As administrators prepare to support the Stanford
Fund proposal, some student groups highly dependent
upon alumni donations said yesterday that the new pol
icy would not affect them overall.
"It's not going to change anything," said Tom Bara
nowski, president of the Inter-Fraternity Council.
"Fraternities and sororities don't technically solicit
[alumni] for money."
He said that fraternities receive support from their
national organizations and alumni who solicit money
from other alumni.
"We were kind of outside the rules. I would assume
that we would still be outside the rules," Baranowski
said.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said yesterday that she
and University President Gerhard Casper both sup
port the new plan.
"We think the committee has done a wonderful job.
The students and the Development Office have come
up with a [good plan). We are both prepared to give it a
try," Rice said.
"It's always the sort of thing
that after five years you'll want to
review, but I think it's innovative,"
she added.
Under the new plan, which
would take effect Sept. 1, student
groups could either earn money by
working for the Stanford Fund or
solicit donations under the auspices
of the Development Office. Alumni
can only be solicited from Feb. 1 to
July 1.
Organizations can request an
exemption if they do not wish to be
bound by the proposal.
The exemption clause pleases
both The Stanford Review and
Stanford-in-Government, who both
depend highly on alumni support.
"SIG has always gotten an
exemption because we fund raise to
give students money for the sum
mer," said Jon Oram, SIG treasur
er. "We've always done our
fundraising in November and
December, and I fully expect we will
continue with that."
"I don't want to be exempt from
the whole policy. There are portions
of the policy that I think SIG needs
to be exempted from, and I think
that SIG will be exempted from
them," he said.
Oram said he has mixed feelings
about the plan.

"I think that this is definitely an
interesting proposal," he said.
"There are a lot of loopholes that
need to be looked at. It leaves stu
dent groups with a lot of flexibility."
He did express concerns that the
Development Office and the Office
of Student Activities exercise sole
power over who receives exemp
tions.
Committee member and under
graduate senator Stephen Russell
has praised the measure, citing a
cappella organizations as other ben
eficiaries.
However, two of Stanford's a
cappella groups — the Fleet Street
Singers and Mendicants — both
said they would not be affected by
the proposal.
Fleet Street financial manager
Nirav Tolia said the group's main
sources of revenue are album sales
and performance fees. "We don't
really get donations," he said. How
ever, Tolia said he has not yet
reviewed the entire proposal.
Russell said the new proposal
"could provide [student groups]
with a great opportunity" by work
ing for the Stanford Fund.
In response to students' claims
that the proposal does not affect
them, Russell said, "If by saying
they are not affected, they mean not
negatively affected, then that is a
tremendous thing.... [But] two or
three years from now the number of
groups that say they are not affected
by the policy will be small indeed."
