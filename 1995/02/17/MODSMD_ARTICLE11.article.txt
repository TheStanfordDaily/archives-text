# Eating disorders focus of awareness week
## 
### Kyung Lee Contributing writer 
Though the palm trees and red-roofed
buildings lend a carefree atmosphere to the
Farm, eating disorders are a reality here.
Hoping to address this problem, Body Image
Awareness Week begins on Monday.
Geared toward men as well as women, the
2-year-old program aims to instill an aware
ness among students that the body is signifi
cant more for its functions and abilities than
for its appearance.
Students in the program's executive com
mittee — made up of coterminal student Eliz
abeth Springer and sophomores Katherine
Bamett and Laura Savage — said they believe
Stanford needs this kind of awareness pro
gram.
"Not many people clinically manifest an
eating disorder, but many are unhappy. How
many people do you know who can say that
they're truly happy with their body?"
Springer asked.
Sophomore Nancy Farghalli, who is in
charge of publicity for the event, said the
body-conscious environment on campus helps
to promote unhealthy behavior. "At 2:00 in
the morning, people are running. You just
can't help comparing yourself to other girls,"
she said.
Dorm-based activities will mark the week,
which features various panels, speakers and
movies. The program will also showcase a self
defense workshop to provide confidence for
students.
"The program will describe what eating
disorders are and how to combat them,"
Farghalli said. She added that it will incorpo
rate interactive activities to illustrate stu
dents' misconceptions.

"We will have a woman come
in to do breathing exercises — to
make students listen to their
bodies," Springer said. "Also,
students will draw an outline of
what they think their bodies look
like on butcher paper. Then
afterwards, they're going to
stand next to the actual outline.
It's interesting to see the differ
ences."
Because of wide-spread cam
pus support, the program will
only cost about $300. The coordi
nators said they are starting to
solicit money from dorms.
Savage added that the com
mittee also applied for a Haas
Center public-service grant.
"Most of our money will be
used for publicity: posters and
green ribbons for awareness,"
she said.

To help the panels reach as
many students as possible, the
panels will be dorm-based. "It won't be like:
'Come to Tresidder at this time.' Instead,
they're going to be at Flo Mo, Lantana, etc.,"
Springer said
These discussion panels, Springer said, will
include an athletics group, an ethnicity panel
and speakers from the Disability Resources
Center and Body Image, Food and Self-
Esteem Support Group.
Farghalli added that the wide range of
panels will provide more individualized and
focused information. "A lot of minorities
who come to this country have trouble rec
onciling the American ideal of beauty with
their culture's idea of beauty," she said.
"The ethnicity panel, made up of students

from different backgrounds, will address this
issue."
The athletics panel will also offer practical
information regarding sports and exercising.
"The athletes tell you how they deal with
having to conform to strict eating standards.
They also discuss how eating certain things
affects performance," Springer said. "We
rarely remember that if we don't take care of
ourselves, we can suffer the consequences."
Two featured speakers of the week, psy
chologist Kathleen Eldredge, from the Stan
ford Behavioral Medical Clinic, and Andy
Winzelberg, a member of the Psychology
Department, will advise students on how to
recognize and prevent eating disorders.
