## Justice Dept. to investigate Brown 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice
Department has opened a preliminary
criminal investigation of Commerce Secre
tary Ron Brown's personal financial deal
ings.
The decision, announced yesterday by
Attorney General Janet Reno, means the
department has found specific allegations
from a credible source that Brown may
have committed a federal felony.
Brown's attorney said, however, that
he was certain the probe would find "no
violation of law."
The preliminary investigation began on
Wednesday. The department has 90 days
from then to decide whether there is
enough evidence to ask a special court to
name an independent prosecutor to con
duct a full criminal investigation.
The special court, acting under the
independent counsel law, authorized Reno
to announce the move and said only that

the investigation covered "allegations that
have been widely reported by the news
media"
Brown's lawyer, Reid Weingarten,
called the action routine.
"The independent counsel act left Jus
tice with no choice," he said. "This is the
step at which point Justice, for the first
time, evaluates the allegations and
receives evidence."
Weingarten said he is confident the pre
liminary investigation will find that there
was "no violation of law and that there is
no need for an independent prosecutor."
At the White House, press secretary
Mike McCurry said, "The attorney gener
al did what attorneys general have to do."
Prior to Reno's announcement, McCurry
said President Clinton continued to have
full confidence in Brown.
Brown is the second Cabinet secretary
now undergoing such a preliminary inves

tigation. The department also is looking
into whether there is enough evidence to
seek appointment of a special prosecutor
to investigate Housing Secretary Henry
Cisneros for payments to a former mis
tress.
Most questions about Brown's busi
ness dealings have concerned his complex
financial relationship with Washington
businesswoman Nolanda Hill.
They were partners in a communica
tions company called First International
Communications Corp., but Brown sold
his interest in the company about a year
after becoming commerce secretary.
Brown said he did limited advising for
Hill on various business transactions. But
he has acknowledged receiving more than
$400,000 in payments from her, including
a $37,000 loan that Hill forgave and
$190,000 that she paid toward has person
al debts.
