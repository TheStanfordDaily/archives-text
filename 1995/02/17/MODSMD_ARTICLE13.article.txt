Another NAACP suit
NEW YORK (AP) - A member of the
NAACP's board of directors filed suit yesterday
seeking to force Chairman William Gibson to
release an audit of his expenses before this
weekend's board elections.
The suit, filed by Hazel Dukes in state
Supreme Court in Manhattan, asks for an
injunction directing that the Saturday election
be postponed until the board can learn results
of an independent audit of Gibson's expenses
from 1989 until last year. A hearing was sched

uled Friday before Justice Stuart Cohen.
Gibson has been accused by critics of double
dipping on his NAACP expense account, taking
hundreds of thousands of dollars for his per
sonal use.
Dukes' suit was one of three filed against
Gibson and other NAACP officials Thursday as
leaders of the troubled civil rights organization
gathered here to chart its future. Suits filed in
Washington and South Carolina accuse Gibson
of spending NAACP money on himself and
allowing sexual harassment to thrive within
the organization.

The lawsuits came as the NAACP inked a
deal with television producer Don Cornelius to
save its annual Image Awards show, which has
lost hundreds of thousands of dollars and was
dropped by NBC last year.
Gibson's critics say the Image Awards' loss
es reflect poor decision-making that drove the
organization more than $3 million into debt
and they cite the debt as one reason why Gib
son should be removed from power.
Gibson is being challenged for his job by
Myrlie Evers-Williams, widow of Medgar
Evers, in the election Saturday.
