# Democrats switch sides on balanced budget

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a setback for
the balanced budget amendment, two Senate
Democrats who had been previously support
ers announced their opposition yesterday.
The two were Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D. > and Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-
N.M.).
Even so, supporters said they were on the
verge of assembling the two-thirds majority of
the Senate needed to send the constitutional

amendment to the states for a ratification
drive.
After nearly three weeks of debate, GOP
and Democratic leaders agreed last night to
hold a vote on final passage of the amendment
on Feb. 28.
Daschle's announcement was expected,
since he has been heavily involved in pressing
Democratic demands to exempt Social Securi
ty from budget cuts and force Republicans to

identify the spending cuts needed to erase the
deficit.
"I support a balanced budget amendment,
but I also share the belief that we owe it to the
American people to tell them how we will do
what the amendment requires," he said.
In a statement declaring his opposition,
Bingaman focused on the Republican refusal
to repeal a House rule requiring a three-fifths
vote to raise income tax rates.
