EREZ JUNCTION, Gaza
Strip (AP) — Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin and
PLO chief Yasser Arafat broke
a deadlock yesterday and
agreed to step up talks on
expanding self-rule in the West
Bank.
Rabin promised to ease a
travel ban and permit 15,000
Palestinians in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip to return to
jobs in Israel next week. The
move came after Arafat arrest
ed militant opponents of the
peace talks and created a mili
tary court to try those suspect
ed of attacking Israel.
Arafat's self-rule govern
ment should also take over the
running of the West Bank city
of Jenin, Rabin said. But Pales
tinians were cool to the idea
because he suggested this could
be done without Israeli troops
pulling out.
Rabin told reporters both
sides were committed to imple

menting the second stage of the
Israel-PLO autonomy accord —
troop withdrawal from Pales
tinian towns in the West Bank
and Palestinian elections.
Arafat did not speak to
reporters, but Palestinian Eco
nomics Minister Ahmed Qureia
confirmed the two sides agreed
to step up negotiations.
"The result of the meeting
was less than we expected, but
I think it broke the ice and
ended a crisis," Qureia said.
Rabin and Arafat agreed to
meet again in three weeks,
then a week after that.
Under the autonomy accord,
Israel was to have completed a
troop pullout from West Bank
towns by July 1994 so Pales
tinians could hold general elec
tions.
Rabin delayed withdrawal
after Islamic militants carried
out attacks, most of them sui
cide bombings, which have
killed 56 Israelis since October.
