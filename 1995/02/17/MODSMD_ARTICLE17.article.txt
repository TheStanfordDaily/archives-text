THE COMMISSION on Under
graduate Education has pro
posed combining the Cultures,
Ideas and Values series and the
world and American cultures distri
bution requirements into one three
course requirement. The Faculty
Senate should vote in favor of this
proposal.

Pro

The combination of the three
requirements into one eases the
large number of required units with
which students are now burdened.
The new, combined CIV track —
along with the Commission's pro
posed three-quarter series in the sci
ences and the humanities — would
compel students to take nine sepa
rate one-quarter classes. Currently,
with CIV and the other eight distri
bution requirements, students must

take 11 required courses.
Two classes may not sound like
much, but for double majors, stu
dents in heavy-load majors like engi
neering or students who dislike the
choices of DR-fulfilling classes, low
ering requirements by two would
make a significant difference.
The main objection to the combi
nation is that professors already do
not find enough time in the five
quarters of American and world cul
tures and CIV to teach young stu
dents all of the great works they
should know from various cultures.
Because there are so many works
that should be examined, however,
no professor could teach his or her
ideal "CIV cannon" in three, five or
even seven classes. One can only
hope to show students the different
genre, to provide a sampling so that
freshmen can discover new areas of
interest. Three quarters provides
plenty of time to attain this goal.
