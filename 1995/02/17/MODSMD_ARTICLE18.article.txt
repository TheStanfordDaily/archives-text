# Don't combine DRs

LAST YEAR it was the grading
policy. This year it's distribu
tion requirements. But in its
never-ending quest to reform Stan
ford's academic requirements, the
Faculty Senate is truly barking up
the wrong tree this time. Enlarging
the scope of CIV would do more
harm than good.

In addition to studying cultures,
ideas and values, freshmen learn a
great deal about how to write a paper,
what professors expect and how
Stanford works in general.
Unfortunately, amid the rush of a
student's first three quarters at col
lege, often the history, philosophy
and great works taught in CIV fade
into the background. This is, howev
er, to be expected. Freshmen are only
beginning to resolve in their minds
the fundamentals of student life —
midterms, roommates and TAs.

If Stanford professors expect their
students to graduate with a broad
based knowledge of culture and civi
lization, freshman year is not the
time to do it. Sadly, by combining
CIV with the world and American
cultures distribution requirements,
that is exactly what the University is
trying to do.
Upperclassmen — even those in
engineering and sciences majors —
should be required to take courses in
Stanford's excellent liberal arts
departments. By that time, they will
be settled into the University envi
ronment and will gain a great deal
more from the classes than they
would as freshmen.
And while students may feel today
that the world cultures and Ameri
can cultures requirements require
them to overload their schedules
with fuzzy classes they don't find
worthwhile, perhaps one day they
will look back and be thankful that
they took advantage of Stanford's
greatest resource — its teachers.
