Cowell consistently provides poor student health care

TO ANYONE considering seeking
medical help at Cowell, forget it! I
can give you better care. At the very
least, I can give you a big caring smile,
which seems contraband at the sterile
gray center. So far my experience with
that facility — staffed by the "bottom-of
the-trough doctors," as a certain biology
professor once claimed — has been
uncomfortably painful to say the least.
My first encounter was extremely dis
concerting psychologically. The doctor
who counseled me may have succeeded in
medical school but must have received
failing marks in interpersonal communi
cation. The Rosenbergs had more amiable
conversations with the CIA during the
19405. I felt incredibly lucky to leave with

my identity left intact. A simple blood test
became a horrible nightmare.
My second experience still pains me
greatly — physically, that is. My ear had
become infected and swollen from a
recently-acquired earring. It hurt so
much that I doubled the recommended
dosage of Ibuprofen to help relieve the
pain. I tried to remove the earring
myself, but the swollen flesh had made it
impossible even to get a grip on the stud.
When Cowell opened on Monday, afler a
sleepless weekend due to the pain, I
sought medical help at the center. I now
know that I should have looked else
where.
After the usual 30 to 45 minute wait
in the lobby, I was directed to a small

chamber, where I was seated and told to
wait. Finally a doctor appeared and
queried me about my ailment. I told to
her about the pain and the horrible
weekend I had endured. Innocuously, she
asked me if she could take a look. As
soon as I exposed my ear to her, she
grasped and grappled with it, trying to
pry the earring loose. All she accom
plished was to make me scream from the
incredible pain. Blood spewed all over the
place; it hurt so much that I wanted to
cry. She did succeed in pushing the stud
further into my swollen flesh, even more
firmly and deeply embedding it than
when I first entered the center. I pleaded
with her to let me try to remove it
myself. Reluctantly, she gave me a

chance. I removed it myself with hardly
any pain or suffering.
If I were less inclined towards forgive
ness and had I not been a premed, there
would be a lawsuit pending against that
doctor and Cowell as well. I fear and
dread how mechanical the doctors are,
and how they presume such positions of
power and make all the decisions for the
patients, abrogating any freedom of
choice. Couldn't she have used a local
anesthetic? Maybe she could have told me
that she was going to attempt to remove
the earring.
So, my fellow Cardinal, beware: Cowell
harbors poor service and even worse care.
