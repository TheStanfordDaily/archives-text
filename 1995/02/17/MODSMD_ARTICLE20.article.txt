# Library should permit student body to borrow the movie 'Caddyshack'
## 
### 
I am writing to inform the Stanford
community of the fundamentally unfair
policy of the Meyer Media Center con
cerning videotapes. Students are not
allowed to check out videos and can
watch them only in Meyer library itself.
When I asked the reason for this policy, I
was told that faculty must be assured of
having access to videos which they may
need.
At the time, I was trying to borrow a
video of "Caddyshack." Unless Stanford
has a professor of "Bill Murray studies,"

I don't see how this film could be a part
of someone's research agenda. I think
the library should liberalize its policies
and allow students to watch videos in
the comfort of their own residences.
