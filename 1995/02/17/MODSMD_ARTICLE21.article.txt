# New Stanford employee did not violate the law and will be vindicated
## 
### 
On Thursday, Feb. 16, The Daily ran
a front-page article concerning allega
tions that have been made against
Keith Light in Cambridge, Mass. Know

ing that allegations of this sort, once
reported and repeated in the press,
have a tendency to develop a life of
their own regardless of the actual facts,
I feel compelled to write.
I have known Keith Light for 20
years. I know him to be an individual of
absolute integrity and honesty. He has
served as a friend, advisor and mentor to
scores of students and alumni, both at
Stanford and at Harvard, for many
years. He is a respected and trusted
member of both university communities.
We are fortunate to have him back with
us at Stanford — Harvard's loss is defi
nitely our gain.
I have no doubt that, once the facts
are known, Keith will be cleared of
any wrongdoing and fully vindicated.

When that happens, I hope and trust
that The Daily will report Keith's vin
dication with the same prominence
with which it reported the accusations
against him.

For the record

Yesterday's editorial on the Stanford
Fund deal incorrectly stated that "groups
which raise funds through the Develop
ment Office will receive a total of
$150,000 next year." The line should
have read "through the Stanford Fund."
