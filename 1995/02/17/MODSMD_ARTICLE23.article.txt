## Affirmative action myths 
### 
Affirmative action is not
what it appears to be. Or rather,
the contentious and unproductive
debate over affirmative action is as inter
esting for what is left unsaid and some
times implied, as for what is said and
sometimes denied. And the way these
things are said can be more important
than what is said.
If critics of affirmative action were to
be believed, every racial minority who
has been admitted to a prestigious uni
versity or obtained a job at an elite firm
has done so with an unfair advantage.
Meanwhile, each white male who has
been rejected by the university or been
turned down for the job has been victim
ized by the moral equivalent of slavery. It
is needless to add that all African-Ameri
can candidates are unqualified, and any
white candidate is the better choice. In
practice, however, affirmative action has
benefited white women more than other
groups.
The rhetoric directed against so-called
"reverse discrimination" would be per
suasive if it were deployed against regu
lar discrimination now and again. While
no doubt "reverse discrimination"
against whites occurs occasionally, regu
lar discrimination against African Amer
icans remains much more prevalent and
vigorous, whether measured by statistics
on employment discrimination and hous
ing segregation, or episodes such as the
Rodney King beating. The comparison
verges on the absurd.

The fetishism of meritocracy would be
attractive if it were consistent. The most
egregious special admittance programs at
universities are the spaces given over to
alumni children, especially whose par
ents donate funds. On the whole, the
beneficiaries of this type of affirmative
action are white. Unsurprisingly, there is
no organized opposition to such a lower
ing of standards. Perhaps by the time
enough non-whites have children to send
to their alma mater the practice will be
discontinued.
Affirmative action, in the end, is only
a means. Opposition to affirmative action
is not necessarily support for racism, but
it can be. The appropriate response to
opponents of affirmative action is the
query, real rather than rhetorical, of how
they might propose to achieve racial jus
tice by other means.
The answers are instructive. Politi
cians and pundits predisposed to fear and
loathing of government programs, espe
cially benefits, turn out to be proponents
in favor of aid to the deserving poor,
whom they picture as white. So they
would sacrifice their hallowed principles
to avoid giving ground to African Ameri
cans.
Especially disingenuous are the con
servatives who, without any record of
fighting discrimination against Asian
Americans, adopt Asian Americans to
support their cause. The new rallying cry
of the anti-affirmative action crowd is,
"It hurts Asians, too."

Making Asian Americans honorary
whites is an attempt to build cover for an
attack on affirmative action. Yet as long
as whites and Asian Americans are treat
ed equally, there is nothing especially
persuasive about an argument that affir
mative action affects Asian Americans.
Affirmative action for African-Ameri
cans cannot hurt Asian Americans to any
greater extent than it hurts whites, if at
all. If whites are given special treatment,
however, then Asian Americans suffer.
They are left as the only ones playing in
the merit game.
Instead of being the argument against
affirmative action, Asian Americans
should be an argument for affirmative
action. If affirmative action is analyzed
with Asian Americans included in the
picture, it becomes clear that affirmative
action does not discriminate against
whites — not in the sense of subjugating
them. Even with affirmative action,
whites and Asian Americans compete
against one another as individuals.
In the controversy over affirmative
action, there is still hope for liberals. The
anxiety over affirmative action reflects
unease over economic opportunities for
all of us. There lies the possibility for con
structive change.
