Stanford 7
UC-Davis 0~

The No. 5 Stanford baseball
team — which hoped to gain
momentum before beginning
Pacific 10 Southern Division
(Six-Pac) play a week from today
— is in perfect position.
The Cardinal extended its
season-high winning streak to
three games with a 7-0 shutout
of the UC-Davis Aggies yester
day afternoon. Stanford (7-4)
now returns home to battle non

conference Bay Area rival Santa
Clara over the weekend.
The Broncos — tabbed the
pre-season No. 17 team in the
nation by Collegiate Baseball
magazine — will travel to
Sunken Diamond tomorrow in
the series opener before hosting
the Cardinal on Sunday. The
three game set concludes on
Monday afternoon at Stanford.
All starts are at 1 p.m.
The Cardinal — which is in
the midst of a 12 day stretch
with nine games — used a com
mittee of pitchers, allowing a
total of only three hits, to blank
the Aggies yesterday afternoon
in Davis.
Junior Todd Bartels, who
worked the first two scoreless
innings, was credited with his

first win of the year but was only
one of a handful of Stanford
pitchers to shut down Davis.
Tom Reimers, J.D. Brammer,
Eric Dreier and Brendan Sulli
van combined to keep the Aggies
hitless over the final five
innings.
Walk-on freshman Jay Pecci
— who has filled in for flu
stricken shortstop Eric Sees —
provided the offensive fireworks
for the Cardinal, going 2-for-4
on the afternoon.
"I thought I'd be used more
as a utility player so I'm glad to
get the chance to play," Pecci
said. "I don't think I'm going to
take Sees' spot but I'm excited
that it might ensure me some
playing time later on."
Junior center fielder Cale
Carter gave the Cardinal a 2-0
lead with a two-run double in
the third and Stanford never
looked back, cruising to its sev
enth win of the year. First base
man Troy Kent doubled off of
Aggie reliever Frank Bignami in
the ninth inning to extend his
career-long hitting streak to
nine games.
The Cardinal must now focus
its attention on the Santa Clara
Broncos — the Bay Area's other
collegiate baseball power.
Like the Cardinal, Santa
Clara has not started the season
the way many would have pre
dicted. The Broncos, the defend
ing West Coast Conference
(WCC) champions, bring a 3-4
record to Stanford after losing a
home series to the Nevada Wolf
pack last weekend.
But Santa Clara did not earn
its first pre-season ranking in
school history for nothing.
The Broncos returned 18 let
termen from last year's 40-20
team, which upset host Wichita
State in the NCAA Midwest
Regional in Wichita, Kan. That
number includes 1994 WCC
