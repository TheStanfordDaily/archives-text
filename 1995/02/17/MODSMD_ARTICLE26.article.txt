# Men's netters await UW, Cal
## Perfect records on the line this weekend 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
Something will have to give this weekend as two
undefeated men's tennis teams come to Stanford
Tennis Stadium to take on the likewise unbeaten
No. 1 Stanford Cardinal (6-0).
No. 46 Washington brings a perfect 4-0 record to
the Farm today at 1:30 p.m., while No. 19 California
will defend its 3-0 record at high noon on Saturday.
"Washington is a scary team," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. "They have a new coach and will
be more prepared to play than they have been in a
long time."
The Huskies will be led by Mark Toinandl at No.
1 singles and Ornello Arlati at No. 2. At last Novem
ber's Rolex NorCal event, Stanford's No. 3 singles
player Paul Goldstein defeated Tomandl 6-0, 6-1,

and No. 6 starter Ricky Becker of the Cardinal beat
Arlati, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5.
So far this year, Stanford singles players are 4-1
against Washington players and 10-4 against Cal
players in tournament action. Stanford shut out
Washington last year, 7-0, but barely got past the
Bears both at home and away, winning by scores of
4-3 each time. In its April 30 dual-match win at
Berkeley, Stanford had to rely on Becker to win the
last match of the day, an exciting three-set victory at
No. 6 singles over Casey Louie, a junior from Sun
nyvale.
Louie has since improved to a No. 22 singles
ranking, and will play either No. 1 or No. 2 singles.
Stanford's No. 1 singles player, sixth-ranked Jeff
Salzenstein, has been hot as of late, winning all six
