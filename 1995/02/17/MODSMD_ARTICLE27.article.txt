# Hungry for revenge
## Hockey travels to ASU 
### Rajen Sheth 
After clinching a berth in the
National Club Hockey Associa
tion national tournament with a
stellar 6-1 victory at California
two weeks ago, the Stanford
hockey team will venture to
Tempo, Ariz, to play two games at
Arizona State today and tomor
row. Although Stanford lost its
first two games 6-5 and 7-5
against the Sun Devils at home
early this season. The team is
playing its best hockey of the sea
son going into this weekend's
games.
"Everything is coming togeth
er so beautifully right now," said
Coach Ernie Ferrari. "Early in
the season, it was tough getting
our players to react to reads. We
are much better right now than at
the beginning of the season."
Stanford comes into the week
end series with a 9-4-2 record
while Arizona State has a mark of
6-18. However, ASU has had
some prominent upsets this sea
son, including the two victories at
Stanford, a win against Cal and a
win against Northern Arizona.
Since this series will not
change its seeding in the national
tournament, Stanford will con
centrate on improving the team's
third and fourth lines against
ASU. According to Ferrari, the
first and second lines are ready,
with the exception of a few minor
adjustments.
The team will be missing three

of its most prominent players not
making the trip: graduate stu
dents Renato Cedolin and Shawn
Sarbacker and freshman Eri
Crum. "We are losing half of our
scoring punch," Ferrari said.
"However, we're not uncomfort
able about it. ASU is a good team,
but they can't touch our first line,
so, if all of our lines are together,
we have an excellent chance to
win both games."
The third and fourth lines will
be given extra defensive responsi
bilities against ASU to give them
more experience before nationals.
Ferrari says that their sole
responsibility will be to play
defense, and that, if they do well,
it will open up more opportunities
for goals. He wants the third and
fourth units to be able to handle
the finesse and speed of the ASU
offense.
"If we can bring all our lines up
to speed, we'll be putting more
bullets in the gun," said Ferrari.
Freshman Sami Jo Small and
grad student Bill Sutherland will
each play goalie for one game of
the series. Small, who has been
impressive as a freshman, will be
the goalie throughout the nation
al tournament.
After returning from Tempe,
the team will prepare for a final
two-game series at home against
Cal. The team hopes for a large
turnout as a send-off to nationals
and hopes to match the atten
