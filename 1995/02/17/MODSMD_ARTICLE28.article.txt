# Women's hoopsters seek to complete double sweep
## Hasn't happened vs. Cal since '87-88 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The stretch is about to begin.
Five of the final seven regular
season games for the Stanford
women's basketball team will be
on the road, starting with
tonight's game against California.
The Cardinal (19-2 overall, 10-
1 in the Pacific 10 Conference), in
its quest for a No. 1 seed in the
NCAA tournament, will need to
continue the trend of playing well
during the final part of the sea
son. Last year Stanford won its
last 11 Pac-10 games, including
the domination of then sixth
ranked USC, 80-50. However,
seven of those games were at
home, which is different from this
season.
The two losses this year came
during tough road games, one at
Tennessee and the contest
against Oregon State. Coach Tara
VanDerveer anticipates that the
game against the Bears will prove
to be difficult as well.
"When you play Cal, they will
play really well," VanDerveer
said. "The team has made the
mistake of overlooking them. The
seniors are only 1-2 at Cal."
During the 1991-92 season,
the last year Stanford won the
national championship, Stanford
fell at Berkeley, 74-65. One year
later, the Cardinal again lost at
Harmon Arena, 64-59. The only
victory for the senior class came
last year, when Stanford defeated
the Colden Bears, 92-75.
The first contest between the
two teams this year was a victory

by the Cardinal, 99-65. Sopho
more Kate Starbird scored 21
points and dished out four
assists to lead Stanford's bal
anced scoring attack. Freshman
Olympia Scott contributed a
double double with 13 points
and 12 rebounds. Scott will not
play in tonight's game, howev
er, as she is out with a stress
fracture in her leg. Other
injuries for the Cardinal include
a couple of twisted ankles, one
by senior Anita Kaplan and
another by freshman Regan
Freuen.
Kaplan sprained her ankle
during practice and should start
for Stanford while Freuen, this
season's "Amy Wustefeld
bomber from three" landed on
someone else's foot during the
Arizona State game and most
likely will play.
Cal is led by its guard tan
dem, Eliza Sokolowska and
Jackie Lear. The two are the top
scorers for the Golden Bears.
During the first meeting

between the teams, Sokolowska
paced the team with 21 points
and five assists while Lear
scored 15. The two also lead the
team in steals and are ranked
nationally.
"We will have to play really
strong perimeter defense to stop
them," VanDerveer said. "They
also get a lot of steals. We have
to take care of the ball."
Stanford, as it has in many
games, will have a height and
size advantage even with Scott
missing the game. Cal has only
two players over six feet who
play significant minutes. Along
with the player-to-player
defense that the Bears will like
ly open the game with, the Car
dinal will look to pound the ball
inside despite the fact that Cal
will double inside.
Although Stanford will try
not to overlook Cal, the Cardi
nal cannot help but sneak a
peek at the rest of the confer
ence season and the anticipated
berth in the tournament.
"The team is really excited,"
VanDerveer said. "We have the
tough part of our schedule com
ing up and we're ready for the
challenge."
