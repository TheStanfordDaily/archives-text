# Women's hoopsters seek to complete double sweep
## Hasn't happened vs. Cal since '87-88 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The stretch is about to begin.
Five of the final seven regular
season games for the Stanford
women's basketball team will be
on the road, starting with
tonight's game against California.
The Cardinal (19-2 overall, 10-
1 in the Pacific 10 Conference), in
its quest for a No. 1 seed in the
NCAA tournament, will need to
continue the trend of playing well
during the final part of the sea
son. Last year Stanford won its
last 11 Pac-10 games, including
the domination of then sixth
ranked USC, 80-50. However,
seven of those games were at
home, which is different from this
season.
The two losses this year came
during tough road games, one at
Tennessee and the contest
against Oregon State. Coach Tara
VanDerveer anticipates that the
game against the Bears will prove
to be difficult as well.
"When you play Cal, they will
play really well," VanDerveer
said. "The team has made the
mistake of overlooking them. The
seniors are only 1-2 at Cal."
During the 1991-92 season,
the last year Stanford won the
national championship, Stanford
fell at Berkeley, 74-65. One year
later, the Cardinal again lost at
Harmon Arena, 64-59. The only
victory for the senior class came
last year, when Stanford defeated
the Colden Bears, 92-75.
The first contest between the
two teams this year was a victory
