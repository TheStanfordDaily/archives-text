# Losing their momentum?
## Spikers hope to reclaim it vs. local foes 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
Momentum. When you've got it, it's easy to keep;
if you lose it, it's very hard to get back. The Stanford
men's volleyball team will be fighting this funda
mental rule of volleyball when they face UC-Santa
Barbara this Friday at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
Whether the Cardinal regains its momentum will
determine how it plays against California in Satur
day's 7 p.m. exhibition match in Burnham.
No. 2-ranked Stanford trudges into this weekend
with an impressive record — 6-2 overall and 3-1 in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation — but with
a languid game. Hawaii split a pair of matches with
the Cardinal last weekend, but the Rainbows out
played Stanford not only in every statistical catego
ry but also mentally — the Cardinal did not play
sharp and committed careless errors.
"When you're not ready to play mentally," said
coach Ruben Nieves, "nothing goes right."
Since taking second place at the UC-Santa Bar
bara Collegiate Invitational tournament a month

ago, Stanford has not played at a consistently high
level.

'We've been winning but just
barely, and we're coming off of a
tough loss to Hawaii'
— Ruben Nieves

The No. 4 Gauchos, on the other hand, come to
the Farm riding the wave of a very hot streak. They
have beaten Brigham Young — ranked eighth and
the winner of the UCSB tournament — Pepperdine,
and UC-Irvine. Santa Barbara swept San Diego
State, a team Stanford took in a tough four games,
and lost to No. 1 UCLA in a tight four game match.
"We've played [UCSBI already [in the Santa Bar
bara tournament]," Nieves said. "We played really
well and beat them. They were struggling a bit, but
since then things have changed.
Things are going well for them.
We've been winning but just bare
ly, and we're coming off of a tough
loss to Hawaii.
"We've got to overcome the
momentum thing — it's definitely
on their side."
The much improved Gaucho
squad fields two strong hitters.
Opposite hitter Donny Harris has
emerged as Santa Barbara's go-to
man, taking sets from all positions
on the court. Harris also possesses
a strong jump-serve, something the
Cardinal had difficulty answering
against the Rainbows. Nieves
reports that middle blocker Robert
Treahey is also a big hitter, streaky
but very hard to stop when he
turns on. The Stanford coaches are
specifically concentrating on coun
tering the hitting tendencies of
these Gaucho attackers.
However, the Cardinal's main
focus this weekend will be on
improving its own performance and
capitalizing on its breadth of talent.
"We're not so much concerned

with who the opponent is," said
freshman middle blocker Keen an
Whitehurst. "We're more con
cerned with bouncing back from
the loss to Hawaii. This weekend is
going to be a test. Either we use it
to fire us up, or we let it keep on
pushing us down."
To bounce back, Stanford needs
to overcome its lack of consistency.
"The consistency just doesn't
seem to be there because we're
such a young team," said sopho
more setter Stewart Chong. "It's
definitely something we're strug
gling with."
The Cardinal fields only one
senior this season, middle blocker
blocker Brian Garrett, and starts
four sophomores.
This young Stanford squad is
working to push its competitive
ness back up to a high plane
against the Gauchos. Its success
will determine whether the Cardi
nal uses Saturday's match against
the Cal club team as an opportuni
ty to play some different personnel
or to regain some momentum
through dominating it.
"Beating Cal is important to us
and to the fans," Nieves said, "but
all our energies are pointing
towards Friday night."
