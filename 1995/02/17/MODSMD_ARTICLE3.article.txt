# Group debates post-BFD possibilities

### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
After more than two hours of debate, a group
yesterday came up with four new possible ver
sions of reform to the special-fee system.
Nine students — representing the ASSU Sen
ate, the Council of Presidents and two student
groups — discussed reforms to the system, in
cluding splitting undergraduate and graduate
votes, as well as buffers, fee refunds and caps to

fees.
"I want to just open this up again," said COP
member Mork Murdock. The Balanced Funding
Deal — the most recent fee-reform proposal —
was defeated by students in an election in late
January. That amendment included splitting
the graduate and undergraduate voting bodies
on fees and eliminating refunds, among other re
forms.
Students are working to develop another pro
posal that would come up for a vote this spring,

after being approved by the senate.
Yesterday's meeting focused more on what
Senate Chair Nawwar Kasrawi called "the pri
mary issue of splitting graduate and undergrad
uate votes."
Under the current special-fee system, all
Stanford students vote on the fees for student
groups. In order to be granted a fee, a group must
receive a majority of the total votes from both
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents.
The group discussed four possi
bilities for reform, each of which
assumed that student groups could
choose from which community to
ask for fees. In each case, fees on
the ballot could be directed toward
graduate students, undergraduate
students or the entire Stanford stu
dent body.
Fees directed to one population
or the other would be awarded
based on a simple majority of that
group.
Under each of the suggested
reforms, a group whose fee passed
by both graduates and undergradu
ates would receive 100 percent of
its request; if it failed in both com
munities, the group would receive
none of its request.
The proposal most like the cur
rent system would award 100 per
cent of a request to a group's fee
that passed overall but failed one
community and no money if the fee
failed overall but passed one com

muruty.
A second proposal would award
50 percent of the requested fee to a
group approved by a majority of
students that failed in one commu
nity. An overall failure would net
the student group no money.
The third proposal provided a
safety net by awarding 100 per
cent to a group whose fee passed
overall but failed one community
and 50 percent to a group whose
fee failed overall but passed one
community.
The final proposal would offer
50 percent of its request to a group
whose fee passed in one communi
ty, whether or not it received an
overall majority.
Senate secretary Alane Murdock
pointed out that graduate students
would still be left paying for some
groups that passed overall but not
in their community.
But senior Scott Moss, president
of the ASSU Speakers Bureau, said
that problem could not be entirely
remedied, if the senate hoped to get
a proposal approved by the under
graduates.
"It's not utopic," he said, "but
it's better than the plan we're on
now."
