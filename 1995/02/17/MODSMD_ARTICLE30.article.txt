# Dual meet season will end at Big Swim
## 
### John Fabian Contributing writer 
"Can Bears swim?" asked the confused Cal
student.
They might as well be dog-paddling this week
end, as the Cardinal men's swimmers are pre
pared to drown them this Saturday at 1 p.m. in
Berkeley. Saturday's Big Swim is the last dual
meet of the year for the Cardinal before the Pacif
ic 10 Conference championships March 2-4, and
it is an opportunity for the men's swimmers to
continue a confident roll that they hope to carry
into the NCAA Championships March 23-25.
At this point in the season, the Cardinal swim
mers have begun tapering, a process of reducing
training so that they can swim their top perfor
mances in March. As a result, not everyone is
going to be swimming at the same level. Howev
er, the Cardinal cannot afford to look past the
Bears. In years past, California has not been a
formidable opponent, but now California is the
No. 4 team in the nation and should offer a legit
imate challenge.
"For the last few years they haven't been able
to compete with us," said senior co-captain Clay
Tippins. "They've got a much stronger team this
year than in years past. You never know what to
expect as far as a team's focus at this point in the
season. They might be absolutely set on beating
Stanford."
While Stanford always wants to beat Cal, the
Cardinal's training process and the point of the
season makes it difficult to concentrate solely on
them. "Everybody's focusing on Pac-10s ," Tip
pins said.
The Cardinal must be careful, though, to
remember that this is not the Bears of last year
or the year before, but the fourth-best team in
the nation in 1995. While they're not as powerful
as Michigan — whom the Cardinal trounced last
month — they are tough, they are in their home
pool and they will definitely be pumped up.
However, according to Stanford head coach

Skip Kenney, "there is no team that travels as
well as we do."
Any swimming fan knows that the Cardinal
does not need a home crowd to get pumped up.
Whatever challenge Cal offers, one can rest
assured that Stanford will rise to the challenge.
"We can't go down there with winning not on
our minds," Tippins said. "We have to beat them.
We hate losing and love winning."
Beyond the direct challenge of the Big Swim,
this meet also provides the last chance for the
Cardinal to race before the Pac-10s. Stanford
hopes to make sure everything is fine tuned and
ready to roll in two weeks.
"This is everybody's last chance to do every
thing right," Tippins said. "Hopefully we can win
while doing everything right. Just winning isn't
enough."
The Cardinal's confidence is high, as the team
has had a very successful last month of the sea
son. With several thorough victories, from Michi

gan to USC, the swimmers have a whole lot of
momentum — an "upward spiral," according to
Tippins — that they hope to maintain through
the NCAAs.
After the last meet, senior co-captain Kurt
Grote said "we're excited. Everyone thinks we
have a better chance now than we thought earli
er in the season. The freshmen are making good
showings, the sophomores are coming around,
and everything's coming together."
The Cardinal needs to keep the confidence by
winning this meet. Whether or not the challenge
is great, the win is a must.
"\Ve need to be able to beat any team on any
given day if we want to win the national champi
onship," said Tippins. "Winning is a habit."
Luckily, the Cardinal swimmers have good
habits, and with a win this weekend they will
carry their momentum into the final month —
into what their season is all about, the Pac-10
and NCAA championships.
