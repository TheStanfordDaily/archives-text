# Sperm angst: Back up the birth canal
## 
### 
Tomorrow'H my birthday. Twenty-two I'll be.
No Bar-Mitzvahs. No rites of passage into the
realms of driving or voting or legal boozing —
nothing special but symmetry. Yay.
Yup, approximately 22 years and nine
months ago Dad let loose the magic glob that
was to inconvenience Mom enough so that she'd
waddle for months. Twenty-two years ago my
mom spent her own birthday having contrac
tions so that a 6-pound 7-ounce pisher could
tear out a day later and get her stitches.
But on this otherwise insignificant birthday I
hear no call to return to the womb and I feel no
remorse for squeezing my way out of its com
placent — albeit gooey — tranquillity. No
angel's voice seduces me back to where Freud
suggests I accidentally forgot my keys on pur
pose. On this stupid, socially unremarkable
birthday life seems the better option and I'm
pretty glad not to be a fetus.
Sublime serenity, sure, but no cable.
Still, with all these considerations of life's ini
tiation, the mind just can't resist teetering
towards the flip-side to this whole birth thing —
that is, we 11... you know.
The grand nap. The forever bye-bye. Brain
wave straightaway. The last slice of pizza. Pee
Wee Herman's career. Check please.
Death.
Now I'm not going to get all birthday-mor
bid, but I'm wondering if, with all the present
purchasing and song singing done to celebrate
birth, perhaps we're not giving death it's due.
Every year we eat ice cream with a fork to cel
ebrate the day we were duped into this realm,
yet every year the day of our death flies by and
we give it no more notice than Arbor Day.

Perhaps croakday deserves a card and cup
cake just the same. Think of the song:
Happy deathday to you
Happy deathday to you.
Happy deathday poor Michael,
Only 58 left till you 're through.
(Unless your rollerblades get you first.)
And even beyond — or rather before — death
I have to wonder how I got to be a fetus in the
first place. I think back to the nice.
Dad relinquishes that wad of potential
cohorts I must beat to get where I am today. I
swim under adversely acidic conditions against
several million others, more or less like myself,
to the fallopian tubes. Once there, the blind
choice of left or right, trusting some vague
chemotaxical premonition to avoid the dead end
way of the average gamete. Amidst the murk of
fructose and Cowper's secretions I compete to
give that egg a hickey.
Yet somehow I — the one eating M&Ms the
whole ride down the urethra, the one with my
microtubules held together with duct-tape — I
beat all those pushy, overzealous, hyper-direct
ed, pre-med-like spermies to the zona pellucida

finish Line.
Of all the bazillion flagellated little brats Mr.
Green came up with I was the one that made it
through the mystic membrane. Nice gene pool,
Dad.
Which leads to the next in a series of Prozac
questions: If you had to run the sperm race
again, would you still win?
Could you do it again ?
Me? Probably not. I'm in abysmal shape — I
am barely bike a ten-minute-mile. Too many
birthday cakes.
Maybe I wasn't even the fastest. Maybe I
used some Jedi Sperm Trick to get all the others
to swim the wrong way ("This is not the tube
you're looking for"). Maybe I wasn't the pick of
the litter but just enough of a wise-ass germ cell
to prank my way to fertilization. And if I hadn't
swindled my half-sibs into shooting the wrong
tube, I'd have been a trickle down the shower
drain just the same.
But what if there (listed better, metre deserv
ing sperms than me? No matter how much my
mommy loves me and tells me I'm the best,
what do I do with the possibility that the world
would have been better off had one of those
Acrosome-Honor Code following pre-med
sperms penetrated the egg, dumped a grander
chromosomal load and made a taller, cuter,
perkier Michael with better hair and a sense of
direction?
Yet I resolve not to dwell. Mr. Mclrony —
God's receptionist — seems to root for the wild
card sperm and now I get to breathe.
Besides, he didn't put us here to worry. He
put us here to make trouble and open presents.
