# Financial report shows: Endowment down in '94
## 
### Kiran Srinivas Contributing writer 
Last year brought some good news to
Stanford's endowment, but it brought bad
news as well.
The University's endowment portfolio
had a relatively low return in financial mar
kets compared to previous years but it did re
ceive many contributions from private
sources.
According to the Chronicle of Higher Ed-

ucation, as of Aug. 31,
1994, Stanford's endow
ment had a total market
value of $3.03 billion, rank
ing behind only four other
schools — Harvard, the
University of Texas, Yale
and Princeton.
Like most schools, Stan
ford suffered on its endow
ment portfolio returns last

year because of a stock market slowdown.
But there is no cause for immediate con
cern, said Vice Provost for Institutional Plan
ning Geoffrey Cox. "The year -to-year returns
don't directly affect the amount of the endow
ment attributed to the budget,"he said.
Most colleges and universities, including
Stanford, only attribute a small percentage

of their endowment to use for the general
budget, while the rest is reinvested.
"We use a smoothing effect over several
years when planning the contribution of the
endowment to the budget," Cox said. "Un
less we have many consecutive down years in
the market, the budget will not be really af
fected."
In 1994, endowment portfolios for all col
leges and universities averaged a 2.9 percent
return compared with a 16.3 percent return
from fiscal year 1993.
Even though Stanford managed to earn
8.5 percent last year on its endowment —
which exceeded most national market index
es — its portfolio still performed much worse
than in previous years.
"The endowment has a pay-out rate of
about 5.25 percent [based on a moving-aver
age of the market value of the endowment
over the full fiscal year] to the University's
budget," said Stanford Management Compa
ny CEO Laurance Hoagland.
By paying out this percentage to the Uni
versity budget, Hoagland said the endow
ment is able to keep its real value — afler con
sidering inflation — constant over time.
Stanford's endowment fund also received
nearly $65 million last year in gifts from pri-


Cox
vate donors. This was another
strong year in contributions for the
endowment and the gifts helped
offset the relatively weak portfolio
performance, said Cox.
The endowment's value is even

more amazing when considering
the school's history, said Cecilia
Evangelista, special assistant to
the vice president for development.
"Only after the death of both
Stanfords (Jane and Leland) did
the University begin to accept pri
vate donations," said Evangelista.
"We have done a credible job of
catching up considering our rela
tively slow start."
