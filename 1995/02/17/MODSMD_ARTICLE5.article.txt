## 
### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
A water pipe erupted in Escondido Village
late Wednesday night, spilling its contents
onto the street and lowering EV residents'
water pressure.
The break in the pipe was spotted by grad
uate student Jamie Bronstein, who immedi
ately called the Facilities Office's emergency
number at 12:08 a.m.
"We had a grounds person on a different
call who checked it out," said Larry An
drews, the manager of water services. When
he determined that he could not handle the
problem, Andrews said he dispatched his
crew to handle the problem.
"It wasn't that bad," Andrews said. The
maintenance crew valved down the leak, and
the leak was fixed by yesterday afternoon.
Bronstein disagreed. She said she was

awakened by a "reverberating noise" and
"saw a river going by."
There was "a big hole in the ground ...
that by morning had completely covered the
street," Bronstein said. It was "pouring out
in torrents," she added.
Bronstein also said that the workers
"didn't take [the leak) too seriously" and
waited to repair the leak. She said that they
did not want to dig for fear of waking up the
residents.
Instead, Andrews said the crew put barri
cades up during the night. At 7:30 a.m. they
began working on the leak.
Water pressure was shut off in the village
for about two hours, between 9 a.m. and 11
a.m., Andrews said. The repair job was fin
ished by the afternoon.
The leak did no damage to EV, Andrews
said. However, Bronstein said that "there
was a little bit of damage to the road."
