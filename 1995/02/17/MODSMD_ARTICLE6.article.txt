# New state action may affect funds
## Proposed affirmative action measures could alter Stanford's use of public funds 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Affirmative action policies may
soon be a thing of the past in Cali
fornia if any one of three separate
political measures receives support
from either the state government or
registered voters.
All three movements are aimed
at eliminating "preferential treat
ment" in state agencies — such as
universities — based on such clas
sification as sex, race and ethnic ori
gin.
Because Stanford is a private in
stitution, however, administrative
officials say these measures, should
they pass, will have little effect on
the University's affirmative action
policies.
"This would not force any partic
ular changes on our part," said Di
rector of University Communica
tions Terry Shepard, on behalf of
the University administration. He
added that the measures "apply
only to government agencies."
But Stanford may not be totally
immune from future changes in
California. The University still re
ceives public funds from the state in
the form of Cal Grants, which sup
plement student financial aid, and it
could be pressured into revising its
affirmative action policies.
"There are still unanswered
questions," said James Montoya,
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aid. "The assump
tion is that it would not affect our
admissions policies. The question is
whether or not funds from the Cal

Grant program would be jeopar
dized."
The political arena

While the measures are still far
from a vote, concern about the actu
al wording and applicability of the

measures has
spread through
out the state.
The first of the I
three measures is
the California
Civil Rights Ini
tiative, written by
academics:
Thomas Wood ,
and Glynn Cus-

tred. Wood heads
the California Association of Schol
ars, while Custred teaches anthro
pology at Cal State-Hayward.
Although it has yet to be filed
with the Attorney General's Office,
the initiative would prohibit the
state of California and any of its po
litical subdivisions or agents from
using "race, sex, color, ethnicity or
national origin as a criterion for ei
ther discriminating against, or
granting preferential treatment to,
any individual or group in the oper
ation of the state's system of public
employment, public education or
public contracting."
Wood and Custred hope the ini
tiative — which would need close to
700,000 signatures — will appear
on either the March or November
1996 ballot.
