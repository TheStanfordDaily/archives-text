# New state action may affect funds
## Proposed affirmative action measures could alter Stanford's use of public funds 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Affirmative action policies may
soon be a thing of the past in Cali
fornia if any one of three separate
political measures receives support
from either the state government or
registered voters.
All three movements are aimed
at eliminating "preferential treat
ment" in state agencies — such as
universities — based on such clas
sification as sex, race and ethnic ori
gin.
Because Stanford is a private in
stitution, however, administrative
officials say these measures, should
they pass, will have little effect on
the University's affirmative action
policies.
"This would not force any partic
ular changes on our part," said Di
rector of University Communica
tions Terry Shepard, on behalf of
the University administration. He
added that the measures "apply
only to government agencies."
But Stanford may not be totally
immune from future changes in
California. The University still re
ceives public funds from the state in
the form of Cal Grants, which sup
plement student financial aid, and it
could be pressured into revising its
affirmative action policies.
"There are still unanswered
questions," said James Montoya,
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aid. "The assump
tion is that it would not affect our
admissions policies. The question is
whether or not funds from the Cal

Grant program would be jeopar
dized."
The political arena

While the measures are still far
from a vote, concern about the actu
al wording and applicability of the

measures has
spread through
out the state.
The first of the I
three measures is
the California
Civil Rights Ini
tiative, written by
academics:
Thomas Wood ,
and Glynn Cus-

tred. Wood heads
the California Association of Schol
ars, while Custred teaches anthro
pology at Cal State-Hayward.
Although it has yet to be filed
with the Attorney General's Office,
the initiative would prohibit the
state of California and any of its po
litical subdivisions or agents from
using "race, sex, color, ethnicity or
national origin as a criterion for ei
ther discriminating against, or
granting preferential treatment to,
any individual or group in the oper
ation of the state's system of public
employment, public education or
public contracting."
Wood and Custred hope the ini
tiative — which would need close to
700,000 signatures — will appear
on either the March or November
1996 ballot.
According to a nationwide poll


Montoya
conducted last month, most people
in America are discouraged about
current affirmative action policies.
"All the polls we've seen indicate
that we'll win, even by a margin of 2-
to-1," Custred said, adding that in
some areas, 70 to 75 percent of the
people polled disapproved of affirma
tive action.
A similar measure has been
introduced to the State Assembly by
Bernie Richter (R-Chico) as a pro
posed amendment to the California
Constitution. The proposal contains
almost the exact same wording as
the initiative and would require two
thirds approval in both the Assem
bly and the Senate.
In addition, Richter introduced a
State Assembly bill which would
require only a majority vote and
would repeal affirmative action
requirements in all state agencies,
school districts and community col
lege districts.
Effects on Stanford
Custred said he doesn't believe
Stanford's policies would be affected
by the initiative should it pass
because of the University's indepen
dent status. Regarding Stanford's
use of public funds, however, Cus
tred said he did not know the details
of Stanford's situation.
"Unless the funds are specifically
earmarked for race- or gender-spe
cific students, I don't think they'll be
in jeopardy," he said.
According to Stanford's selection
criteria for undergraduate admis
sions, there exists "a few categories
of applicants [whol receive special
consideration provided they meet
basic requirements of academic
excellence and personal achieve
ment."
These categories include specially
targeted minorities such as blacks,
Mexican Americans and Native
Americans. Children of Stanford
graduates, faculty and staff as well

as outstanding athletes also receive
"special consideration."
Although many people on and off
campus seem relatively sure that
Stanford's independent status
exempts the University from being
forced to change its policies, few
know the effects that the measures
would have on the University's pub
lic funds.
Victor Walsh, an administrative
assistant with Thomas Wood, pre
dicted that the measures would
affect Stanford and that its policies
involving both state aid and affirma
tive action students "would probably
have to be revised."
The University's admissions poli
cies could be more of a concern at the
graduate level because minority
recruitment is more aggressive at
the graduate schools. Provost Con
doleezza Rice said, however, that it
was too early to tell what the effects
would be.
At the undergraduate level, Mon
toya said that "Stanford is in a
unique position. We continually
attract the best and brightest stu
dents across ethnic lines," he said.
He added that even if the mea
sures could somehow be applied to
Stanford, he didn't believe admis
sions policies would change much.
"[Our] program focuses on develop
ing a highly diverse applicant pool
so that we don't have to focus on the
ethnic makeup of the class," he said.
The situation might be different
at other schools, where the gap
between specially targeted students
and non-specially targeted students
is greater, Montoya said.
For example, the measures have
received great attention on the UC-
Berkeley campus, where more than
400 students rallied Wednesday
against an allegedly racist flyer
denouncing affirmative action
which was distributed over the
weekend.
UC Regent Ward Connerly has
also called for a review of the school
system's affirmative action policies.
In response to his call, UC President
Jack Peltason said the UC system is

"preparing an inventory and report
on our affirmative action programs"
which will be ready in June.
Whether or not the initiative has
a direct impact on Stanford, howev
er, remains to be seen. Nevertheless,
"it raises the question related to the
value of affirmative action," Mon
toya said.
Affirmative action arguments
The three different measures
have drawn fire from several promi
nent figures including Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Fran
cisco), who has called the attacks on
affirmative action "racist."
Custred, however, classified the
recent measures as a "healthy
reassessment of policies" rather
than an attack or backlash against
affirmative action.
"The initiative basically pre
cludes the state from using preferen
tial treatment based on race and
gender," Walsh said. "This does not
include preferences based on other
factors, such as socio-economic class.
That seems to be the direction the
state is moving to right now."
Walsh added that he believes
affirmative action is not fulfilling its
original purpose. "Those who have
the most need for preferences don't
receive any help Opportunities
are veiy slight for them."
But Montoya disagreed"Many
associate affirmative action with a
decline in quality," he said. "Twenty
years ago, 23 percent of the appli
cants had 4.0 GPAs. The figure is
double that now."
Montoya also said he believed
there was a misunderstanding on
how quickly demographics were
changing in California.
"There is a sense that students
are getting in [to good schools]
because of their ethnic background,"
he said. "People are surprised to
learn that the minority of high
school graduates fin California! are
white.... When people realize this,
it becomes understandable why col
lege makeup is changing as rapidly
as it is."
