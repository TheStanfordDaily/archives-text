### Tristan Sorah Reyes Contributing writer 
The search for the new head of the
Black Community Services Center has al
most come to an end.
On Feb. 3, the search committee inter
viewed the last of the five final candidates,
said Dandre Desandies, head of the com
mittee.
A recommendation has now been made
to Dean of Students Michael Jackson and

Vice Provost and Dean for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds based on the strengths and
weaknesses of each candidate.
Desandies, a student affairs officer in
the Undergraduate Advising Center, said
he hopes that Jackson and Edmonds will
decide who to offer the position to within
the next two weeks.
The final five candidates were Robert-
Bedford, from Indiana University Purdue
University at Indianapolis; Morris Graves,
from the University of Houston; Gwen

dolyn Mosley, from the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley; Leonard Perry, from
Brown University; and Benita Ramsey,
from the Claremont Colleges.
All of the five final candidates have be
tween 10 and 15 years of experience in stu
dent affairs, Desandies said. They have ei
ther run residential, multicultural or aca
demic programs.
During fall quarter the position for the
head of the center was put up for
grabs through a national search.
The search for the new head
began in mid-December, said
junior Michelle Fowles, a student
on the recommendation commit
tee. A committee was formed to
sort through the applications,
pick final candidates, interview
them and then make a final rec
ommendation to Jackson and
Edmonds on the final candi
dates.
Before conducting interviews,
the committee determined which
qualities they were looking for in a
candidate.
"We were looking for someone
who could make the black commu
nity at Stanford a place that black
students would want to be at,
someone who had a vision of what
the black community could be,
someone with good relational
skills that could make strong con
nections with the students and
who could work well in the Stan
ford community overall,"
Desandies said.
Fowles added that the com
mittee was looking for someone
with "an understanding of and a
commitment to the University's
academic mission and the ability
to develop collaborative rela
tionships with other communi
ties."
Desandies said that the com
mittee then called the top seven
candidates and conducted inter
views with them over the phone.
From there, they narrowed it
down to five candidates who came
to Stanford for interviews with
different people and groups on
campus.
Each interviewee spent a day
on campus, allowing them to
interact not only with black stu
dents and organizations but with
the whole Stanford community,
Desandies said.
