# Mascots could face criminal charges

### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
After their brawl two nights ago, the
Stanford Tree and Oski the Bear may be
hit hard — with criminal charges.
The two mascots, who got tangled up
during the Stanford-Berkeley basketball
game on Wednesday, could be charged
with "fighting in public" if the Santa
Clara County district attorney decides to
pursue the case, Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer said.
The case will be presented to the dis

trict attorney this morning, Niemeycr
said, adding that it will take a few days
for the district attorney to decide if
charges should be pressed.
Both parties said they feel the charges
are undeserved. Sophomore Ari Mervis,
who plays the Tree, said that "in my
mind, [this is] nothing worthy of crimi
nal charges."
Although Oski the Bear — whose
identity is kept secret as a Berkeley tradi
tion — was not available for comment,
his staff adviser Karen Andrews, the as
sistant director of athletics at UC-Berke

ley, agreed, saying she does not think the
charges are warranted.
It is not clear who started the fight,
Niemeyer said, even though the event
was broadcast on ESPN. However, the
two mascots were interviewed separately
after the fight by Stanford Police Detec
tive Tim Schreiner, Niemeyer said.
According to Niemeyer, in the inter
views "the Tree [said] Oski was in the
Stanford section and he told him to
move." When Oski did not move, the
Tree "slightly gave him a nudge ... and

the Bear fell down," Niemeyer said.
The Bear then tackled the Tree, he
said.
But according to Oski's state
ment, the Tree harassed him when
he went to the Stanford section.
Mervis and Andrews both said
the two mascots feel that the inci
dent showed poor judgment and
miscommunication on their part.

But Mervis added he "didn't
think it was that serious. I was just
trying to play around ... it was just
normal mascot stuff."
If charges are tomorrow,
they could be seen as u'blow to UC-
Berkeley tradition, as Oski's iden
tity would have to be unveiled. For
the time being, however, police are
keeping Oski's identity a mystery.
In the meantime, Charles Davis,
union manager of athletics at Stan
ford, said the Athletic Depart
ments of both schools are handling
the matter internally.
