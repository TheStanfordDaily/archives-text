Give us a library, not condoms
I don't see why the liberals were up in arms
about the proposed Reagan library. This campus
has a fit over getting a new library, but we're
willing to buy Allen Ginsberg's used condoms.
Stanford shouldn't let its liberal politics stand in
the way of improving education.
New science quad is no gift
I don't understand what the deal is with the
new science quad — we're tearing down a bunch
of old buildings to build some new ones. It's
great that Hewlett-Packard gave $77 million,
but the University is going to end up paying mil
lions more. We could spend the money some bet
ter way.
Put The Daily on the 'Net
I think that campus news could reach a lot
more people if The Daily distributed its issues
over the Internet.
