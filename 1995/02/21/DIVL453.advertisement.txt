Stephen Small
Racialised
darner e:
The Black Experience in
the United Statee and
England in the 1930e
(Routledge, $16.95)
"This book is among the best general treatments of race I have encountered in
recent years." —Professor Howard Winant, Temple University
"To what extent is the 'black' experience in Britain and the US comparable? In the
past, too few writers have attempted to ask and answer this question in detail.
Small has done so in a challenging an d creative way: this book fully deserves to
be the focus of much debate in the UK and the US." - Robert Miles, Glasgow
University
