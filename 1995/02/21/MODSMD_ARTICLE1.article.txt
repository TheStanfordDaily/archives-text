# Licking the mail problem
## Group plans survey about postal service 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
As the Stanford Post Office's
lease runs out, so has Stanford stu
dents' patience with the much-ma
ligned campus mail service.
Service at the post office has
been poor for "eight generations of
Stanford students," says ASSU
Senate Deputy Chair Mike Choo.
But through a new survey and
negotiations upon the expiration of
the lease, Choo hopes to change
that.

This summer, l
the Postal Advi- j
sory Committee ■
collected 60 spe- i
cific complaints j
from post office |
customers. Now, i
Choo and Council |
of Presidents [
member Anietie i
Ekanem have

formed their own group to distrib
ute a survey to students address
ing nine general problems with
the post office. With these results
to work from, the problems can be
attacked directly, Choo said.
Choo and Ekanem are part of a
group of "volunteers who are angry
at the slow service," taking action
where the committee hasn't, Choo
said.
"I'm just appalled that an advi
sory committee would be set up
that would never meet," he said.
"This is a timely opportunity to
launch an organized protest."
A meeting of the two students
and representatives of the Palo
Alto Post Office and the Stanford
Management Company — which
leases the campus post office as a
branch of the Palo Alto office —
has been scheduled for next week,
Choo said.
By Friday, he said, the ASSU
hopes to have collected 500 sur
veys, along with letters from stu
dents to Palo Alto Postmaster
Masayuki Sato and Vice Provost
and Dean for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds. Packets of sur
veys and letters will be distributed
to students by ASSU dorm repre
sentatives. Surveys may also be
filled out at a table in White Plaza
today or tomorrow.
The survey asks students to
rank a list of identified concerns
about the post office from most
important to least important.
Concerns include: the parcel
