# Licking the mail problem
## Group plans survey about postal service 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
As the Stanford Post Office's
lease runs out, so has Stanford stu
dents' patience with the much-ma
ligned campus mail service.
Service at the post office has
been poor for "eight generations of
Stanford students," says ASSU
Senate Deputy Chair Mike Choo.
But through a new survey and
negotiations upon the expiration of
the lease, Choo hopes to change
that.

This summer, l
the Postal Advi- j
sory Committee ■
collected 60 spe- i
cific complaints j
from post office |
customers. Now, i
Choo and Council |
of Presidents [
member Anietie i
Ekanem have

formed their own group to distrib
ute a survey to students address
ing nine general problems with
the post office. With these results
to work from, the problems can be
attacked directly, Choo said.
Choo and Ekanem are part of a
group of "volunteers who are angry
at the slow service," taking action
where the committee hasn't, Choo
said.
"I'm just appalled that an advi
sory committee would be set up
that would never meet," he said.
"This is a timely opportunity to
launch an organized protest."
A meeting of the two students
and representatives of the Palo
Alto Post Office and the Stanford
Management Company — which
leases the campus post office as a
branch of the Palo Alto office —
has been scheduled for next week,
Choo said.
By Friday, he said, the ASSU
hopes to have collected 500 sur
veys, along with letters from stu
dents to Palo Alto Postmaster
Masayuki Sato and Vice Provost
and Dean for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds. Packets of sur
veys and letters will be distributed
to students by ASSU dorm repre
sentatives. Surveys may also be
filled out at a table in White Plaza
today or tomorrow.
The survey asks students to
rank a list of identified concerns
about the post office from most
important to least important.
Concerns include: the parcel

pick-up window is only open a few
hours each day, the postal line is
long, priority and first-class mail
are delivered late, important docu
ments aren't delivered, packages
are damaged, too few personnel
cover the windows, mail is misde
livered, vending equipment is out
of order or undersupplied and
express mail cannot be picked up
at the proper time.
Although not all of the 60 com
plaints collected this summer
could be included on the survey, it
is still comprehensive, Choo said.
In order to change specific
problems, however, the most
important ones must be identi
fied, he said.
"By pinpointing the problems,
we can try to fix the specific prob
lems, rather than getting a gener
al list of complaints," he said. "We
need to be creative about finding
solutions for our unique situa
tion."
Federal and union regulations
can complicate the process of
changing how the post office is
run, Choo said, making

widespread student input during
lease negotiations more impor
tant. "This is the only kind of
leverage we can get," he said.
"This survey will help in commu
nicating specific problems when
we meet with the postmaster and
the Stanford Management Com
pany."
Students understand the
restrictions the post office has as
part of the U.S. Postal Service,
Choo said, but "that's no
excuse."
"The problem with the Post
Office is a problem with all these
regulations impeding flexible and
innovative solutions," he said. "As
long as the commitment is there,
I'm sure we can find ways to
improve service and delivery."
As one of only two university
campuses in the country with a
branch office delivering mail,
Stanford's problems are unique,
Choo added.
"Stanford students should not
be treated like second-class cus
tomers just because we are a
branch of the main Palo Alto sta
tion," he said.
"Every post office across the
country has complaints," Choo
said. "We need to find those that
are most epidemic at Stanford."
