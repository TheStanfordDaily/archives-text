Mideast clash
RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) —
Tit-for-tat attacks erupted on the
last active Arab-Israeli war front
for a second day yesterday as mili
tants raided an outpost belonging

to Israeli allies and warplanes
bombed guerrilla targets.
Two fighter-bombers swooped
down on Jabal Abi Rashed, firing
at least two air-to-ground missiles,
security sources said.
Two jets returned less than an

hour later to fire two more mis
siles at the same target — a dirt
road used by Hezbollah guerrillas.
The raids, came several hours
after Hezbollah attacked an out
post of Israel's surrogate militia,
the South Lebanon Army.
