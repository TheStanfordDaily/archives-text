# Travel agents protest fee cap

TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -
Travel agents are taking their
case to the courts, as well as the
court of public opinion, in a fight
to get the airlines to remove a
$50 cap the latter placed on tick
et commissions earlier this
month.
The American Society of Trav
el Agents Inc. plans to announce
a strategy today that will include
legal action, legislative efforts, a
public advertising campaign and
other steps to overturn the cap.
Virtually every major U.S. air
line announced last week that in
order to cut costs they are cap
ping commissions to agents on
ticket sales. The airlines will now
pay agents up to $25 for one-way
domestic tickets and $50 for
round trips, instead of a 10 per
cent commission on each ticket.
After the announcement,
some large travel agencies decid
ed to start charging customers a
fee for booking. But smaller

agencies fear if they impose fees
customers will bypass them and
book their flights directly with
the airlines or through on-line
computer services.
At least one lawsuit has been
filed so far, and in the past week
some 2,000 angry travel agents
met in New York City. About 500
more gathered at a hotel in Bev
erly Hills, Calif., before protest
ing on nearby Wilshire Blvd.
Groups are also organizing all
over the country.
In Torrance, Calif., a new
group called Coalition for the
Traveling Public says it has
enlisted about 2,000 agencies in
Florida, Illinois, Minnesota and
New York to fight the cap.
New Jersey travel agents are
asking consumers to sign a peti
tion addressed to U.S. Trans
portation Secretary Federico
Pena and members of Congress,
saying travelers don't want to
have to pay fees or make their

own bookings, said Debbie
Donofrio, who organized a meet
ing of 250 irate travel agents in
Newark on Feb. 13.
"There are some smaller agen
cies that said they'll just close
their doors and others that said
they'd just cut back on their
staffs," Donofrio, owner of Boule
vard Travel in Boonton, N.J.,
said Monday. She said she may
have to lay off half of her six
employees.
ASTA's 24 directors met in
Washington and discussed the
cap over the weekend.
"We're still really analyzing
the data, but the impact is
severe," said Dick Knodt, execu
tive vice president of ASTA,
based in Alexandria, Va. He said
agents handle 85 percent of all
airline tickets in the country.
"Two-thirds of the average
agent's revenues are generated
by airline commissions," Knodt
said.
