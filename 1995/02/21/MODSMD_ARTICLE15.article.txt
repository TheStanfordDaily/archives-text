JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) - A police
commander accused of leading a terror campaign
pleaded innocent yesterday in a trial that could expose
details of the white minority's attempts to retain
power in apartheid's last days.
Testimony at Eugene de Kock's trial may support
African National Congress charges that former Presi
dent F.W. de Klerk's National Party fomented vio
lence even as it opened the way to the country's first
all-race elections last April.
The National Party needs to build support among
the black majority if it is to have a chance challenging
the ANC in future elections. De Klerk became a
deputy president in President Nelson Mandela's ANC
led coalition government.
De Klerk denied he had been responsible for state
sponsored violence.
"I am comfortable that I was never part of any deci
sion which related to or authorized the atrocious deeds

which are now being alleged to have been executed by
individual members of the security forces," he said.
De Kock, facing 121 charges ranging from murder
to weapons offenses, is accused of heading a special
police unit targeting anti-government activists.
Now the government wants to set up a Truth Com
mission that would recommend granting amnesty to
people who disclose full details of their apartheid-era
crimes.
De Kock's lawyer, Flip Hattingh, has said his client
might seek to delay trial until a Truth Commission
completes its work — a process expected to last at least
18 months.
To counter that strategy, prosecutors filed charges
that de Kock committed murder and other crimes for
personal gain, not political reasons. The judge would
have the final say on whether to delay the trial or pro
ceed because the charges involved non-political
crimes.
