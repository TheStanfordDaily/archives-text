## Stronger languages 
### 
ALTHOUGH the various rec
ommendations given by the
Commission on Undergradu
ate Education on CIV and distribu
tion requirements have received a lot
of attention, its suggestion to
strengthen language requirements
could be just as significant — and
beneficial.
Currently, student must only
have taken three years of a language
in high school to meet Stanford's for
eign language requirement students.
Acting on the CUE recommenda
tion, the Faculty Senate has
approved a changed requiremnt—
effective with the class entering in
the fall of 1996 — that would signifi
cantly beef up standards, requiring a
4 or 5 on a language Advanced Place
ment test or 60Q or better on an SAT
II foreign language achievement
test.
Although it would burden some,
this is change will be beneficial in the

long run. Stanford students are
entering a world that is increasingly
international in nature, one that will
need citizens with more language
skills.
Stanford, however, must be care
ful in its implementation. These
increased requirements should not
become, in political jargon, an
unfunded mandate — the Universi
ty must be willing to support the
inevitable costs of higher enrollment
in language classes. Estimates of the
increase in the number of students
vary from 200 to 300.
These new students — many
with some foreign language back
ground — will also need guidance; all
language departments should be
ready with improved placement tests
given during the freshman orienta
tion week.
In short, Stanford should put its
money where its multilingual mouth
is.
