# High-tech ID system
## 
### 
WHAT DO you know â€” the
University recently
announced that, yet again,
it would delay its plans to issue
comprehensive photographic iden
tification cards. Since administra
tors have waited this long, they
may as well forego photo student
IDs completely and leapfrog to the
identification systems of the future,
namely thumbprint and voiceprint
recognition technologies.
Did you know that until the
1990-91 academic year, Stanford
issued ID cards printed on tan
paper? All it took was a quick ses
sion on the family laser printer and
any Paly kid who wanted to could
party on the Farm. But then the
University got smart and created
high-tech red and white plastic lam
inated IDs. That made it lots hard
er for non-students to get into frat
parties.
And for at least the past five
years, the University has been talk
ing about making photo IDs which

worked for meals and library ser
vices. Gee, you mean like every
other university in the country has?
Frosh readers, you will have the
pleasure of spending your entire
Stanford career without filling out
dozens of carbon-copy library
forms with two-inch long pencils.
But older, wiser upperclassmen
know of the dark ages of the
library system and long minutes
spent racing to beat the 10 p.m.
checkout deadline.
Life would be even more simple
(and secure) if Stanford would pur
chase equipment to identify stu
dents, faculty and staff by
thumbprint and voice. Granted,
administrators are probably not
forward-looking enough to do that;
the very least they can do is come
out with those photo IDs they have
been promising for so long.
Stanford has always claimed to
be on the cutting edge of science
and technology. Our ID system
should reflect this.
