# Praise and mourning at the Gates of Hell
## Friends and students pay tribute to Art Prof. Elsen 
### Gabriela Teodorescu Contributing writer 
By all accounts, the event at the B. Ger
ald Cantor Rodin Sculpture Garden was
more of a celebration than a memorial ser
vice.
A bagpipe player's solemn music wel
comed more than 300 guests on Sunday af
ternoon. In his introductory remarks, Art
Department Chair Paul Turner said, "We
are here to celebrate the life of A 1 Elsen."

Albert Elsen was a renowned scholar on
the work of Auguste Rodin, an internation
al authority on the history of modern sculp
ture and a professor of art at Stanford for
27 years.
Turner spoke about the many different
roles which Elsen played — scholar,
teacher, crusader, bringer of art and friend
— allowing the other speakers to voice re
marks on Elsen's performance in each of

these roles.
Turner emphasized Elsen's
commitment to Stanford students.
"His teaching became legendary
to generations of undergraduates,"
he said.
William Rubin, director emeri
tus of the Department of Painting
and Sculpture at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York, gave the
first memorial tribute to his lifelong
friend. "The thing that struck me
about AI was that ... I always felt
that what made America good was
somehow brought together in Al,"
he said.
Stressing Elsen's personal quali
ties, Stanford Art Prof. Emeritus
and Director Emeritus of the Stan
ford Museum Lorenz Eitner said,
"[Elsen] had a warm geniality and a
need for friendship.... It is hard to
think of Al as belonging to the
past."
Many of the tributes acknowl
edged Elsen's selflessness and gen
erosity with his colleagues and
friends.

"(There was] nothing of stan
dard ego or arrogance in A 1 —
everything he did was for others or
for an idea," said Kirk Varnedoe,
one of Elsen's former students and
chief curator of the Department of
Painting and Sculpture at the
Museum of Modern Art in New
York.
Often, speakers mentioned
Elsen's willingness to share his
time equally with anyone who
requested it.
"I never heard him say 'I don't
have time for that' or 'I can't help
you with that,' " said Mona Dug
gan, associate director for external
relations at the Stanford Museum.
"He did not discriminate according
to title."
Stanford Law Prof. Emeritus
John Henry Merryman, who
taught a course on art law with
Elsen since 1971, gave a tribute to
Elsen's public and private personal
ity. "He valued reasoned discourse,
ethical action ... and he didn't hes
itate to criticize those who did not
act," he said.
University of Massachusetts
Prof. Emerita Ruth Butler focused
on Elsen's professional scholar
ship. Butler recalled Elsen's feel

ings when he was writing his book
"The Gates of Hell" about Rodin's
famous sculpture: "A 1 said,
'There's no way I'm going to do
justice to those gates.' A 1 you did it
— even Rodin would say you did
it."
"In his work on Rodin, A 1 was in
a class all by himself. He was a cul
tural treasure to have had such a
colleague, to have had such a
friend," Merryman said, tearfully
ending his memorial tribute.
Painter Paul Jenkins talked
about the way that Elsen could be
"meaningfully difficult" when he
believed in an idea. Jenkins
stressed that even Elsen's passing
was as surprising as many of his
actions in life. "You joined the
angels before they had time to react
— you shook the gates of hell," he
said.
Elsen's participation in bringing
art to the Stanford campus was one
of his better-known deeds. "(We
thank him) for enriching our lives
by raising hell — literally and figu
ratively — and making the campus
a living museum," said William
Stone, president of the Stanford
Alumni Association.
Art History Prof. Wanda Corn,

chair of the University Panel on
Outdoor Art, also stressed Elsen's
contributions to the Stanford cam
pus. "You have made this campus a
grand experience in how to live with
art and you have personalized and
enriched our campus grounds," she
said.
The memorial service ended
with a procession which passed by
all the statues Elsen helped bring to
campus. It was led by a New
Orleans-style jazz band and the
guests were requested to place a
flower in Elsen's memory by their
favorite statue. This procession
recalled the quote which many of
the speakers had used to refer to
Elsen, "If you seek his monument,
look about you."
Elsen, who died Feb. 2 at age 67,
was the Walter A. Haas Professor of
Art at Stanford. He was a pioneer in
the field of art law and a fund rais
er for the University museum.
Through his efforts the Stanford
University Museum of Art
acquired the world's second largest
collection of Rodin works.
Elsen was also the author of
"Rodin's Gates of Hell," "Rodin,"
"In Rodin's Studio" and various
other publications.
