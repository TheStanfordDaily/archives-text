## Die
						Luft der Freiheit weht 
### 
WHEN I ENTERED Stanford as
a frosh in 1991, I was over
whelmed with the sense of free
dom and choices that were given to the
students. More than the simple free
dom to choose classes and then choose
to not attend those classes, here was
the freedom to make decisions about
beliefs and lifestyles without the over
whelming presence of parental guid
ance and restrictions. This wider defi
nition of freedom and choice applies to
personal autonomy and who has the
power to make our lifestyle decisions.
In many frosh, and sometimes older
students, this initially means an excess
of partying, drinking, drug use, staying
up late and missing class the next
morning. However, 1 know that most of
the people who fit into this pattern of
behavior during my frosh year figured
out within a year or so that they need
ed to pay more attention to their aca
demic work, that frat parties just
aren't that cool and that a few hours of
sleep might be necessary to function
the next day. As relatively responsible
people who were not hell-bent on self
destruction, we soon found our own
limits and moderated our behavior
accordingly. When we couldn't find
those limits ourselves, the residence
staff was, in most cases, willing to
intervene and help.
The key factor here is that Res Ed
and the University only intervened
when we could not moderate our own

behavior and set healthy limits for our
selves. The maintenance of this "safety
net" idea is essential to allow students
both a period of self-examination and
the freedom of choice. In addition, a
relationship of mutual respect is estab
lished in which Stanford did not
impinge upon the students' autonomy.
Okay, so a hunky-dory situation
with mutual respect and warm fuzzies
has been set up. So what's wrong with
the picture? Nothing, except that these
rights and choices are slowly being
taken away from the student body. Yes,
in the form of the new no-smoking pol
icy in student rooms and around cam
pus; in the attempts to encourage
BYOB parties at fraternities; and most
recently, in Mary Edmonds' vow to
crack down on alcohol consumption on
campus to reduce alcohol abuse. All of
these administrative decisions attempt
to promote healthier behavior of the
students, which is a good thing.
However, the difference between
encouraging healthy habits and enforc
ing them is wide, probably as wide as
the gap in understanding and trust
between the administration and the
students will be if this trend of behav
ior regulation continues. If the resi
dence staff takes a more "active" role in
stemming alcohol and drug consump
tion on campus, I firmly believe that
the problem will just worsen. After all,
the University will be utterly incapable
of improving the alcohol and sub

stance-abuse situation on campus if
fewer dorm residents trust the RAs
enough to treat them as friends and not
police officers.
As it stands right now, most of the
smokers that I know who live in dorms
simply close the door and open the win
dow when they want to have a cigarette
in their room. Clearly, the University's
solution to smoking in dorms is ineffec
tive, and, in addition, the RAs are put in
the uncomfortable situation of either
losing the trust of their residents or bla
tantly ignoring Stanford's mandate by
allowing indoor smoking to continue.
Granted, this is not a major crisis on
campus and students have no need to
form action groups about it. However,
perhaps it is in the interest of the Uni
versity to consider that ideological rifts
and tension between the administra
tion and the student body have usually
led to frustration for both groups. And
perhaps the University can take deci
sive steps to limit this tension by treat
ing us, the students, as adults who
have earned the right to be treated as
responsible human beings who are
capable of shaping and defining our
own lifestyles.

Sudha thanks The Review for its sup
port and hopes that it shares her views
on feminism and welfare.
