Keith Light claims he was wrongly accused in papers

LAST WEEK, The Harvard Crimson
published a story which became the
basis for The Daily's Feb. 16 story
concerning me. Without careful research
and without allowing me fair opportunity
to comment, the Crimson article included
claims that are entirely untrue or mis
leading. It is particularly painful and
unfortunate because the story was print
ed without the slightest consideration for
the harm that might be caused me and
my colleagues at Stanford and Harvard.
Given the tone and substance of the alle
gations, it would have been more
thoughtful and decent to give me reason
able opportunity to state my response. As
it was, the Crimson reporter left mes
sages for me only a matter of hours
before the press deadline, and had not
indicated the reason for his calls.
In the best of situations, a news article
will contain errors or lead the reader to
make inaccurate assumptions. The Crim
son article crossed well beyond the line of

innocent misreporting. I will not attempt
to address the many small problems with
the article, but I do wish to comment on
the key issues around which such a dark
story was painted.
Contrary to statements in The Crim
son, and reported by The Daily, I have
neither lied to the Cambridge Rent Con
trol Board or any of its agents, nor have I
even been asked to make a statement
before any such board. In fact, I have
never owned or had any business interest
in property that would ever involve me in
tenant-landlord relations.
With regard to a "hearing" on the case,
I received no notice of the proceedings,
and I have no clear idea what useful
information I could provide in the first
place. The Daily article ran on the day
that the rent board's general counsel
admitted that the hearing notice was
mailed to an address to which mail can
not be delivered, and that it was sent nei
ther in the form of a summons nor by

registered mail. Having missed a hearing
about which I was completely unaware,
the consequence is to "default," which, I
must say, was difficult to avoid when no
other attempts were made to contact me.
It was my innocent ignorance, then, that
lead to the eye-catching report of a Stan
ford (and Harvard) worker being accused
of misdeeds.
Meanwhile, the civil litigation from
which this episode arose involves compli
cated details but a simple story. As is so
common these days, a person with a com
plaint, however unsubstantial, has elect
ed to sue anyone and everyone with hopes
that someone will pay. I regret that this
party has decided to seed an attack on my
reputation along with — or perhaps as
another means to — seeking monetary
gain.
As one of my Stanford mentors often
said, "You can't unring a bell." He was
right. This bell has been rung, with and
for what it may be worth, that this proud

Stanford alumnus and employee has not
lied to, defrauded, or mislead anyone, or
otherwise committed the slightest breach
of law or ethics in regard to this situation.
I am deeply sorry that it has become the
rule rather than the exception that a good
story takes priority over fair and thor
ough journalism. However disappointed I
am that The Daily also printed an article
that cannot possibly capture the full
scope of the issue in a few brief para
graphs, I appreciate having had even the
scant, if inadequate, opportunity to
respond before the article appeared. Had
The Crimson shown more courtesy and
professional restraint, the truth might
have had a better chance to emerge. As it
is, I will simply have to hope that once
the entire story can be appropriately told,
The Daily will be as eager to print the
news of my restored good record as it was
to report my alleged misdeads.
