# Wu has forgotten that affirmative action has widespread opposition
## 
### 
In "Affirmative Action Myths" (Fri
day, Feb 17), Frank Wu constructs a
tedious and primitive caricature of the
views of poeple who are against affirma
tive action. The Los Angeles Times, in a
recent poll, found that over 70 percent
of the population of California was

against such programs, as they now
stand.
In a state as diverse as California,
this 70 percent must include people from
diverse backgrounds with regard to eth
nicity, gender and political inclination.
In the argument over the possible
abolition of affirmative action, there is
no room on either side for the sort of
crude stereotyping in which Frank Wu
indulged.
