## Southerners fight geographical elitism on campus 
### 
IT'S BEEN over
100 years since
General Sherman
viciously rampaged
the South. Today,
while no progressive
minded Northern
academics would con
done such barbarism,
they continue dis
paraging the South

in a less messy fashion. Intellectual
snobbery has become the 20th centu
ry's answer to burning towns, and the
geographical elite are Sherman's new
foot soldiers.
Ironically, this snobbery breeds at
progressive universities. Proud of their
degrees and summer reading accom
plishments, academics claim to be
open-minded. But when they see a
chance to validate themselves at the
expense of the geographically-chal
lenged, they look right down their
noses and pass judgment. No group
finds itself at the other end of that
nose more often than Southerners.

Even at the otherwise open and
unstuffy Stanford, the labeling is ram
pant and a Southerner may just as well
have gone to school in Connecticut.
The following joke is a good example:
Who is the only person dumber than a
Southerner? The kid he'll have with
his cousin. The view is that Southern
ers are a bunch of backward hillbillies
who continue to make their own
moonshine even though Prohibition is
over (not that they could know this,
however, because they can't read the
21st amendment).
Prejudicial stereotypes take form in
people's minds before they even meet
the unfortunate recipient of their bias.
But unlike stereotypes that can at least
be disproved, the Southern misconcep
tion haunts its victims no matter their
intelligence level or how far from their
families they marry.
Indeed, a Southerner now runs
Congress, another is in the Oval Office,
and a third is standing by, just in case
some Northerner takes a liking to
Jodie Foster. But the Presidency won't

shake the label, even if you are a
Rhodes Scholar with a couple of fancy
degrees.
For example, mocking former Presi
dent Bush, David Letterman's top ten
biggest embarrassments of 1992
included "losing the presidency to a fat
hick." Moreover, on the eve of the
inauguration, Dennis Miller noted that
the Clintons were ready for the trip to
Washington while a background clip
showed the Grapes of Wrath scene
where the Joads load up their jalopy.
But the stereotype goes further.
Perhaps with slightly more grounding,
the South is regarded as the bastion of
intolerance. Indeed racism and homo
phobia are problems there, but is this
only true of the South?
Rodney King does not live in Geor
gia, and Bensonhurst is well north of
the Mason-Dixon line. I went to college
in the nerve center of geographical
(and liberal) elitism, Boston. Bostoni
ans send Ted Kennedy — who save
name and accent seems like a hillbilly
himself — to Washington to raise taxes

and look out for the less fortunate. But
Bostonians don't seem so progressive
once they leave the voting booth. The
Charles Stuart incident demonstrated
the tension in a city notorious for its
racial divisions.
I've been to the South. No one spit
tobacco juice on me, and everyone I
met was wearing shoes. Undoubtedly,
the Southern stereotype is just another
way that the Northern urbanite can
validate his crowded and cold exis
tence. But Stanford can rise above this.
Remember that every Southerner
here got in the same way you did. The
SAT has no connect-the-dots section in
Louisiana. Southerners will be good
sports about the inevitable teasing
they receive, but do not take this as an
invitation for more. The next time you
are tempted to poke fun at the South,
remember that the only thing dumber
than a Southerner may be the North
erner who does not take her seriously.
