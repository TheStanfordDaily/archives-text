## Bears too small for No. 5 women 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
Stanford 91
California 67

It was a night of career highs.
Freshman Naomi Muli
tauaopele, picking up the playing
time left by injured freshman
Olympia Scott, led the Stanford
women's basketball team to a
road victory over California Fri
day night.
The Cardinal (20-2 overall, 11-
1 in the Pacific 10 Conference),
helped by Mulitauaopele's career
high 21 points in only 14 minutes,
defeated the Golden Bears (9-12
overall, 4-8 in the Pac-10) 91-67.
Playing in front of 3,056 fans,
almost half of them rooting for
Stanford, the Cardinal overcame
a slow start to put the game out of
reach in the first half.
Cal took the lead in the early
going. At the first time out, with
15:17 to go in the half, the Bears
led 11-10. The Cardinal picked up
three turnovers in the short span,
two of them on steals by Patti
Czepiec and Jackie Lear.
However, Cal could not stop
senior center Anita Kaplan.
Kaplan, in her last game at Har
mon Arena, sparked a 21-4 run by
scoring her 14 points in the first 12
minutes to give the Cardinal the
14-point advantage, 31-17. With
the Bears playing a person-to-per
son defense, Stanford constantly
passed the ball inside, using the
height advantage to take the lead.

The run was highlighted by
freshman Kristin Folkl's "Dwight
Clark"-type catch of a pass from
senior Kate Paye. She made a
move along the baseline and
drained a short fadeaway jumper.
In addition, Folkl was fouled on
the shot, leading to a free throw
and a successful three-point play.
Then the Cardinal unleashed
Mulitauaopele.
She entered the game with the
lead down to eight at 31-23; when
halftime came around, the mar
gin had ballooned to 23. The 21-6
run included 12 points by Muli
tauaopele, who shot five of six
from the field and made both free
throws. Particularly impressive
was the four minute span in
which she did all of her damage.
In the first half, Stanford made
66.7 percent of its shots from the
floor for the 52-29 lead. Folkl,
who scored 10 points and dished
out three assists in the first half,
ended the first 20 minutes with
the same number of rebounds as
Cal, seven. The Cardinal out
rebounded the Bears by 15.
The margin fluctuated between
21 and 34 in the second half, as
Stanford was unable to complete
ly pull away as the team so often
has done this season. Most of the
starters returned to the game late
in the second half after some slop
py play by the reserves.
Sophomore Kate Starbird
scored 15 points to tie with Hem
mer for the second-highest scorer
on the team. Starbird also tied a
career high in rebounds with
seven, which she set in her very
first game with the Cardinal.
Folkl also set a career high in

Cardinal to a 91-67 triumph.
