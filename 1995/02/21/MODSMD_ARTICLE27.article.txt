# Hoping to avoid foul outcome
## UCLA hoops in town 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
The "SOLD OUT" signs came up three
weeks ago. It's a matchup close to a
month in the making. Now it's here.
Flashback to a cool and balmy South
ern California night back on Jan. 26.
With barely over a minute remaining in
the Stanford men's basketball team's
Pacific 10 Conference showdown vs.
UCLA, the Cardinal found itself up by
one and on the threshold of toppling the
mighty Bruins at fabled Pauley Pavilion.
All game, Stanford had been playing
catch-up, and now, there was an opportu
nity to do something that the stuff of
dreams are made of. But as quickly as the
chance was presented, it was snatched
away. Stanford's close brush with sweet
glory had been precisely that ... a close
brush. A foul call here, a shot made there,
and the only thing left was "what could
have been."
Tonight at Maples Pavilion, 17th
ranked Stanford (16-5 overall, 7-5 in the
Pac-10) has a chance to write a new end
ing to the story of its 77-74 loss and make
"what could have been" be in a rematch
against third-ranked UCLA (18-2 overall,
11-2 in the Pac-10).
As their ranking indicates, the Bruins
haven't slowed down much since the first
meeting between the two teams. UCLA
forward Ed O'Bannon had 31 points in
Sunday's victory versus the Pac-10's
other power, Arizona, and his brother,
forward Charles O'Bannon, had 23 in the
Bruin victory against Arizona State last
Thursday.
The Cardinal stumbled a bit on its
road trip in Arizona but have apparently
regained its composure as evidenced by
last week's thumping of Cal. Because the
Cal game was Stanford's only one last
week, the aching Cardinal squad enjoyed
some much needed healing time.
"The week off helps us a lot," said

Stanford sophomore guard Brevin
Knight. "We had a lot people that had
bumps and bruises, sprained ankles, bad
backs. Any time we get a rest, it's real
good. It's also good that we came out of
midterms, so people can just concentrate
on basketball."
Now, a different type of bear lies on
the doorstep ready to be skinned.
"We feel good going into the UCLA
game," Knight said. "We're practicing
hard. We've had a couple of great prac
tices. Our guys are just ready to play. It's
a big game for us. If we can get this win,
that just betters our chances to go unde
feated for our last seven games which is a
goal of ours after losing to both Arizona
and Arizona State."

10t.... Anytime we get a
rest, it's real good.'

But don't think this is just another one
of the last seven games.
"From the standpoint of national
recognition, anytime you play a team
that's in the top 10, and you can win, it's
a huge deal," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "I don't think we'll
ever get to the point where we're blas6 at
Stanford where we can win against a top
10 team, home or road, and consider it
not a big ball game for us. We've had
some good wins against some good teams
but another one at this point in time
would certainly enhance our reputation."
The tight games against UCLA and
Arizona have already augmented Stan
ford's standing, but after the close games,
tonight's game will let the Cardinal show
that not only can it play against
anyone, but it can win the games
too.
"It's another home game, but
it does have that added impor
tance," Knight said. "We need to
get a win over a team ranked
higher than us. We got Arizona
State [here earlier in the year],
now we need to get one more.
That will make us feel better, and
nationally people will start to say,
'They can hang, but they can also
win those games."'
Another start like the one at
Pauley Pavilion, though, and
Stanford will have its work cut
out for them. In the earlier meet
ing, UCLA jumped all over the
Cardinal from the get-go, leading
32-16 before there was enough
time to grab a hot dog.
"We need to come out and play
hard from the beginning," Knight
said. "We kind of came out a little
bit lackadaisical. They went up
big in the first 10 minutes. After
we settled down, we hung with
them. As a matter of fact, we
probably won the next 30 min
utes of the game. We know we
just have to go out and play right
from the beginning. We don't
want to give them a lead and have
to fight back. We want to try to
build a lead of our own and have
them fight back against us."
There likely won't be a short
age of Bruins willing to brawl and
battle either.
"UCLA works hard all the
time," Knight said. "They keep
coming at you, they keep coming
at you. They work very hard.
They might not throw a lot of
offensive looks at you, but they
have enough players where they
don't have to. They go out and get
the job done."
The Bruins are able to do that
because from the top of the roster
down, UCLA is simply loaded.
The elder O'Bannon, Ed, will cer
tainly be a focus, but there's also

the big picture-UCLA's overall
bigtime talent-which includes
All-Pac-10 point guard Tyus
Edney as well as center George
Zidek and freshmen Toby Bailey
and J.R. Henderson. Even back
up point guard Cameron Dollar,
who has filled in admirably at
times for a banged-up Edney
(tendinitis in left knee), is playing
the games of his life.
"You know Edney's a great
player too," Montgomery said.
"Then there's also Charles
O'Bannon, Zidek, the list goes on
and on. It's not where by stopping
just one guy, you can succeed.
You give up a half a step if you're
UCLA, and you're just coming
back to the rest of us."
Still, tightening the reigns on
Ed O'Bannon, who hit 4-of-5
from three-point range and also
had 10 rebounds against Arizona
Sunday, might be a good place to
start.
"We know Ed O'Bannon's
going to come out and play hard,"
Knight said. He had a great game
[against Arizona], That's one
thing that we know he's capable
of doing — going out and having
big games."
For Montgomery's team, all
the players need big games.
"[ln the first game against
UCLA], we had billions of prob
lems," Montgomery said. "You
name it. Too many offensive
rebounds. Got ourselves too far
behind. We didn't defend. It just
goes on and on.
"We've got to do a better job.
You play UCLA, everybody has to
do their job. You have to have
some very good individual perfor
mances, i.e. most everybody. You
can't have two or three guys that
just don't produce. If you do,
you're going to put yourself in
real jeopardy. For us, everybody
has to come out and have a pretty
good, solid ball game. And we all
have to defend and board. Then I
think we have a chance against
anybody."
The Cardinal had a chance
then on that fateful January
night. Now they have another.

UCLA will pose a stiffer challenge than Cal's Monty Buckley did to
this Andy Poppink jumper.
The "SOLD OUT" signs came up three
weeks ago. It's a matchup close to a
month in the making. Now it's here.
Flashback to a cool and balmy South
ern California night back on Jan. 26.
With barely over a minute remaining in
the Stanford men's basketball team's
Pacific 10 Conference showdown vs.
UCLA, the Cardinal found itself up by
one and on the threshold of toppling the
mighty Bruins at fabled Pauley Pavilion.
All game, Stanford had been playing
catch-up, and now, there was an opportu
nity to do something that the stuff of
dreams are made of. But as quickly as the
chance was presented, it was snatched
away. Stanford's close brush with sweet
glory had been precisely that ... a close
brush. A foul call here, a shot made there,
and the only thing left was "what could
have been."
Tonight at Maples Pavilion, 17th
ranked Stanford (16-5 overall, 7-5 in the
Pac-10) has a chance to write a new end
ing to the story of its 77-74 loss and make
"what could have been" be in a rematch
against third-ranked UCLA (18-2 overall,
11-2 in the Pac-10).
As their ranking indicates, the Bruins
haven't slowed down much since the first
meeting between the two teams. UCLA
forward Ed O'Bannon had 31 points in
Sunday's victory versus the Pac-10's
other power, Arizona, and his brother,
forward Charles O'Bannon, had 23 in the
Bruin victory against Arizona State last
Thursday.
The Cardinal stumbled a bit on its
road trip in Arizona but have apparently
regained its composure as evidenced by
last week's thumping of Cal. Because the
Cal game was Stanford's only one last
week, the aching Cardinal squad enjoyed
some much needed healing time.
"The week off helps us a lot," said

Stanford sophomore guard Brevin
Knight. "We had a lot people that had
bumps and bruises, sprained ankles, bad
backs. Any time we get a rest, it's real
good. It's also good that we came out of
midterms, so people can just concentrate
on basketball."
Now, a different type of bear lies on
the doorstep ready to be skinned.
"We feel good going into the UCLA
game," Knight said. "We're practicing
hard. We've had a couple of great prac
tices. Our guys are just ready to play. It's
a big game for us. If we can get this win,
that just betters our chances to go unde
feated for our last seven games which is a
goal of ours after losing to both Arizona
and Arizona State."

The week off helps us a
10t.... Anytime we get a
rest, it's real good.'

But don't think this is just another one
of the last seven games.
"From the standpoint of national
recognition, anytime you play a team
that's in the top 10, and you can win, it's
a huge deal," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "I don't think we'll
ever get to the point where we're blas6 at
Stanford where we can win against a top
10 team, home or road, and consider it
not a big ball game for us. We've had
some good wins against some good teams
but another one at this point in time
would certainly enhance our reputation."
The tight games against UCLA and
Arizona have already augmented Stan
ford's standing, but after the close games,
tonight's game will let the Cardinal show
that not only can it play against
anyone, but it can win the games
too.
"It's another home game, but
it does have that added impor
tance," Knight said. "We need to
get a win over a team ranked
higher than us. We got Arizona
State [here earlier in the year],
now we need to get one more.
That will make us feel better, and
nationally people will start to say,
'They can hang, but they can also
win those games."'
Another start like the one at
Pauley Pavilion, though, and
Stanford will have its work cut
out for them. In the earlier meet
ing, UCLA jumped all over the
Cardinal from the get-go, leading
32-16 before there was enough
time to grab a hot dog.
"We need to come out and play
hard from the beginning," Knight
said. "We kind of came out a little
bit lackadaisical. They went up
big in the first 10 minutes. After
we settled down, we hung with
them. As a matter of fact, we
probably won the next 30 min
utes of the game. We know we
just have to go out and play right
from the beginning. We don't
want to give them a lead and have
to fight back. We want to try to
build a lead of our own and have
them fight back against us."
There likely won't be a short
age of Bruins willing to brawl and
battle either.
"UCLA works hard all the
time," Knight said. "They keep
coming at you, they keep coming
at you. They work very hard.
They might not throw a lot of
offensive looks at you, but they
have enough players where they
don't have to. They go out and get
the job done."
The Bruins are able to do that
because from the top of the roster
down, UCLA is simply loaded.
The elder O'Bannon, Ed, will cer
tainly be a focus, but there's also

the big picture-UCLA's overall
bigtime talent-which includes
All-Pac-10 point guard Tyus
Edney as well as center George
Zidek and freshmen Toby Bailey
and J.R. Henderson. Even back
up point guard Cameron Dollar,
who has filled in admirably at
times for a banged-up Edney
(tendinitis in left knee), is playing
the games of his life.
"You know Edney's a great
player too," Montgomery said.
"Then there's also Charles
O'Bannon, Zidek, the list goes on
and on. It's not where by stopping
just one guy, you can succeed.
You give up a half a step if you're
UCLA, and you're just coming
back to the rest of us."
Still, tightening the reigns on
Ed O'Bannon, who hit 4-of-5
from three-point range and also
had 10 rebounds against Arizona
Sunday, might be a good place to
start.
"We know Ed O'Bannon's
going to come out and play hard,"
Knight said. He had a great game
[against Arizona], That's one
thing that we know he's capable
of doing — going out and having
big games."
For Montgomery's team, all
the players need big games.
"[ln the first game against
UCLA], we had billions of prob
lems," Montgomery said. "You
name it. Too many offensive
rebounds. Got ourselves too far
behind. We didn't defend. It just
goes on and on.
"We've got to do a better job.
You play UCLA, everybody has to
do their job. You have to have
some very good individual perfor
mances, i.e. most everybody. You
can't have two or three guys that
just don't produce. If you do,
you're going to put yourself in
real jeopardy. For us, everybody
has to come out and have a pretty
good, solid ball game. And we all
have to defend and board. Then I
think we have a chance against
anybody."
The Cardinal had a chance
then on that fateful January
night. Now they have another.
