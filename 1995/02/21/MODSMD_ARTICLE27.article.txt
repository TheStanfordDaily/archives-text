# Hoping to avoid foul outcome
## UCLA hoops in town 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
The "SOLD OUT" signs came up three
weeks ago. It's a matchup close to a
month in the making. Now it's here.
Flashback to a cool and balmy South
ern California night back on Jan. 26.
With barely over a minute remaining in
the Stanford men's basketball team's
Pacific 10 Conference showdown vs.
UCLA, the Cardinal found itself up by
one and on the threshold of toppling the
mighty Bruins at fabled Pauley Pavilion.
All game, Stanford had been playing
catch-up, and now, there was an opportu
nity to do something that the stuff of
dreams are made of. But as quickly as the
chance was presented, it was snatched
away. Stanford's close brush with sweet
glory had been precisely that ... a close
brush. A foul call here, a shot made there,
and the only thing left was "what could
have been."
Tonight at Maples Pavilion, 17th
ranked Stanford (16-5 overall, 7-5 in the
Pac-10) has a chance to write a new end
ing to the story of its 77-74 loss and make
"what could have been" be in a rematch
against third-ranked UCLA (18-2 overall,
11-2 in the Pac-10).
As their ranking indicates, the Bruins
haven't slowed down much since the first
meeting between the two teams. UCLA
forward Ed O'Bannon had 31 points in
Sunday's victory versus the Pac-10's
other power, Arizona, and his brother,
forward Charles O'Bannon, had 23 in the
Bruin victory against Arizona State last
Thursday.
The Cardinal stumbled a bit on its
road trip in Arizona but have apparently
regained its composure as evidenced by
last week's thumping of Cal. Because the
Cal game was Stanford's only one last
week, the aching Cardinal squad enjoyed
some much needed healing time.
"The week off helps us a lot," said

Stanford sophomore guard Brevin
Knight. "We had a lot people that had
bumps and bruises, sprained ankles, bad
backs. Any time we get a rest, it's real
good. It's also good that we came out of
midterms, so people can just concentrate
on basketball."
Now, a different type of bear lies on
the doorstep ready to be skinned.
"We feel good going into the UCLA
game," Knight said. "We're practicing
hard. We've had a couple of great prac
tices. Our guys are just ready to play. It's
a big game for us. If we can get this win,
that just betters our chances to go unde
feated for our last seven games which is a
goal of ours after losing to both Arizona
and Arizona State."

The week off helps us a
10t.... Anytime we get a
rest, it's real good.'

But don't think this is just another one
of the last seven games.
"From the standpoint of national
recognition, anytime you play a team
that's in the top 10, and you can win, it's
a huge deal," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "I don't think we'll
ever get to the point where we're blas6 at
Stanford where we can win against a top
10 team, home or road, and consider it
not a big ball game for us. We've had
some good wins against some good teams
but another one at this point in time
would certainly enhance our reputation."
The tight games against UCLA and
Arizona have already augmented Stan
ford's standing, but after the close games,
tonight's game will let the Cardinal show
