Stanford 0 3 2
v c' w 1

The Santa Clara Broncos have always been
the little brothers of Bay Area college base
ball, never able to step out of the shadow of
the highly touted Stanford Cardinal.
The little brother has grown too big to be
picked on.
The Broncos (5-5) stymied Stanford's
offensive production in taking two of three
games from the Cardinal (8-6) over the week
end. Stanford dropped from No. 5 to No. 12 in

the nation while Santa Clara climbed back
into the polls to No. 22.
"[Stanford] has a lot of great talent and it's
a big boost for us to beat them," Santa Clara
head coach John Oldham said. "We would
have liked to get the sweep but this is defi
nitely a step in the right direction."
The Broncos put themselves in a position
to sweep the three game set by shutting out
Stanford 4-0 on Saturday at Sunken Diamond
before grabbing a 5-3 decision at Santa Clara's
Buck Shaw Stadium on Sunday. The Cardinal
salvaged the series finale 2-1 behind an out
standing pitching performance from fresh
man Kyle Peterson yesterday at Stanford.
Stanford will travel to the University of
San Francisco this afternoon in their final
tune-up before Pacific 10 Southern Division
(Six-Pac) play begins at UCLA next weekend.
Santa Clara fans brought their brooms to

Sunken Diamond on Monday afternoon hop
ing to see the underdog Broncos pull off the
unlikely sweep of the pre-season No. 1 team in
the nation. But Peterson had other plans,
pitching a complete game to pick up his second
career win before a season-high crowd of
1,950.
"I was the most nervous I've ever been
before a game," Peterson said. "I've never
pitched in front of 2,000 people before but I
just did the same things I do all the time and
it worked."
The right-handed freshman struck out
seven Bronco batters while allowing just four
hits and no walks to notch the Cardinal's first
complete game of the year. Peterson worked a
perfect final five innings, retiring an incredi
ble sixteen batters in a row to seal the victory.

Senior Steve Carver dives back into first in the Cardinal's series
opening loss to Santa Clara on Saturday.
"I'd like to have some more of
those kinds of runs," Peterson said.
"It was a huge win for us with Pac
-10 play coming up this weekend."
In a defensive game that lasted
under two hours, Stanford needed
a great performance from Peter
son. Santa Clara's starting pitcher
Mike Frank — who is also one of
the Broncos' leading hitters —
went the distance as well, allowing
just five hits while striking out
three Cardinal batters.
The Broncos got all the offense
they could muster from the first
hitter of the game. Right fielder
Randy Winn launched a 3-2 pitch
over the left field wall for a leadoff
home run in the top of the first —
his second leadoff homer of the
three game series — to put Santa
Clara up 1-0.
"I threw him a pretty good pitch
at 2-2 but then I put the 3-2 pitch
right down the middle," Peterson
said. "That was a mistake but I
knew that we'd be able to come
back."
And Stanford wasted no time in
doing so, evening the game in the
bottom of the first with a two-out
rally. Junior catcher A.J. Hinch
stretched a routine single to center

field into a double. Third baseman
Steve Carver, also a junior, fol
lowed by belting the first pitch he
saw to the wall in right for a run
scoring double.
The Cardinal took the lead in
the seventh inning with another
clutch two-out hit. First baseman
Troy Kent led off the inning with a
single and was advanced to third
with two out. Junior Brodie Van-
Wagenen, who has been battling a
foot injury the entire season,
picked up his first base hit of the
year, lining a single over the reach
of the second baseman to bring
home the winning run.
For a four-inning stretch, Peter
son and Frank set down 21 consec
utive hitters in a game that was
clearly a pitcher's duel.
"I thought we played pretty well
today," Oldham said. "But [Peter
son] really did a great job. He got
tougher and tougher as the game
went along and we couldn't touch
him."
The series opener on Saturday
afternoon also featured an over
powering pitcher at Sunken Dia
mond, only this time it was the
Cardinal which was silenced.
Santa Clara's Bob Pailthorpe
tossed eight scoreless innings,
allowing just five hits, to come up
the victor in a 4-0 decision.
Pailthorpe faced just one over the
minimum number of batters
through the first five innings as the

Broncos built a 3-0 lead and went
on to snap Stanford's three game
winning streak.
Santa Clara got all the offense it
would need from the first hitter of
the game when Winn led off the
series with a home run over the
wall in left field. Stanford's starter
Dan Reed (1-2) worked the count to
0-2 before throwing an inside curve
that Winn took deep.
The Broncos added another run
in the fourth before finally chasing
Reed in the sixth. Santa Clara ral
lied for four straight hits to pick up
two more runs in thai inning and
saddle Reed with his second loss of
the year.
Karl Thompson, a preseason
second-team Ail-American catcher,
got tiling started with a single to
center field before shortstop Ross
Parmenter, who went 7-for-9 on
the series, followed with a double to
right. A Michael Cole single to right
and a Brent Bianchina single to
center made the score 4-0 and sig
naled the end of the afternoon for
Reed.
Pailthorpe, who left the game
after walking Cale Carter to lead
off the ninth, threw seven strike
outs while allowing just four walks
to pick up the victory. Mike
McDonald came in to retire the
final three Cardinal batters to end
the game.
On Sunday the Cardinal trav
eled to Santa Clara hoping to even

the series, but came away on the
short end of a 5-3 decision. The
Broncos sent eight men to the plate
in the bottom of the sixth to break
open a 2-2 tie and put themselves
in position to sweep the series.
Jason Middlebrook (0-3) took
the loss for the Cardinal, who man
aged to scatter 10 hits but was
unable to come through in the
clutch.
The Broncos put three hits
together — two doubles and a sin
gle — while walking three times in
the sixth inning to go over the .500
hump for the first time of the year
at 5-4. Winn provided the heroics
once again, singling home Par
menter to give Santa Clara a lead it
would not relinquish.
Stanford has always been
among college baseball's elite,
earning births in the College World
Series eight times and coming
away with two national champi
onships. Though the Broncos have
made it to Omaha only once — and
haven't returned for 33 years —
they've already proven that they
can compete with their neighbors
to the north.
"Stanford has always had a very
good team," said Winn, who had
four hits and three RBIs in the
series. "But we match up pretty
well against them and this was a
big series for us. We showed that
we can compete and we showed
that we can win."
