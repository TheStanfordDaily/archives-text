Stanford 0 3 2
v c' w 1

The Santa Clara Broncos have always been
the little brothers of Bay Area college base
ball, never able to step out of the shadow of
the highly touted Stanford Cardinal.
The little brother has grown too big to be
picked on.
The Broncos (5-5) stymied Stanford's
offensive production in taking two of three
games from the Cardinal (8-6) over the week
end. Stanford dropped from No. 5 to No. 12 in

the nation while Santa Clara climbed back
into the polls to No. 22.
"[Stanford] has a lot of great talent and it's
a big boost for us to beat them," Santa Clara
head coach John Oldham said. "We would
have liked to get the sweep but this is defi
nitely a step in the right direction."
The Broncos put themselves in a position
to sweep the three game set by shutting out
Stanford 4-0 on Saturday at Sunken Diamond
before grabbing a 5-3 decision at Santa Clara's
Buck Shaw Stadium on Sunday. The Cardinal
salvaged the series finale 2-1 behind an out
standing pitching performance from fresh
man Kyle Peterson yesterday at Stanford.
Stanford will travel to the University of
San Francisco this afternoon in their final
tune-up before Pacific 10 Southern Division
(Six-Pac) play begins at UCLA next weekend.
Santa Clara fans brought their brooms to

Sunken Diamond on Monday afternoon hop
ing to see the underdog Broncos pull off the
unlikely sweep of the pre-season No. 1 team in
the nation. But Peterson had other plans,
pitching a complete game to pick up his second
career win before a season-high crowd of
1,950.
"I was the most nervous I've ever been
before a game," Peterson said. "I've never
pitched in front of 2,000 people before but I
just did the same things I do all the time and
it worked."
The right-handed freshman struck out
seven Bronco batters while allowing just four
hits and no walks to notch the Cardinal's first
complete game of the year. Peterson worked a
perfect final five innings, retiring an incredi
ble sixteen batters in a row to seal the victory.
