The Stanford tree bent but did not break last Fri
day and Saturday at Stanford Tennis Stadium, as
the top-ranked Cardinal men's tennis team (8-0)
withstood a mild shaking from a group of Washing
ton Huskies (4-2) and No. 19 California Bears (4-1)
intent on bringing the undefeated Cardinal down
from the perch of its perfect record.
But it was the Huskies and the Bears who were
dealt their first defeats of the young season, with
Washington being shut out by a score of 7-0 and Cal
doing only slightly better, succumbing by a count of
6-1.
The Bears provided the Cardinal with the best
competition of the weekend, mustering a No. 1 dou
bles upset of a Stanford tandem that had looked
invincible until last Saturday, and sending a No. 2
singles wake-up call to Scott Humphries, the Cardi
nal freshman phenom who had previously been at
the top of his game.
A near-capacity crowd watched as Cal's Michael
Hill and Bobby Mahal snapped the 18th-ranked
Humphries and Paul Goldstein's 19-match doubles
winning streak with an 8-5 victory. The streak,
which dated back to October, included doubles
championships in four major tournaments: the
Rolex NorCaJ, National Collegiate Classic, Pacific
10 Conference Indoors, and Rolex Intercollegiate
Indoors.
"I knew [Hill and Mahall were going to give us a
tough match," Humphries said.
Hill and Mahal, who last November had lost to
Stanford's No. 2 doubles team of Jim Thomas and
Ricky Becker, 9-8 (7-1), were able to use the combi
nation of Hill's good hands and Mahal's excellent
returns of serve to tie the doubles match score at
one apiece. Stanford's Jeff Salzenstein and Grant
Elliott had already defeated Cal's No. 3 duo of
Nathan Jackmon and Julian 8-4.
But Thomas and Becker were able to pull out the

Junior Ricky Becker displays his mighty serve, possibly the best Stanford has to
offer. Becker and doubles partner Jim Thomas lost to Cal's Michael Hill and Bobby
Mahal, but Becker won his singles match over Tori Dapas 6-4, 6-3 as the Cardinal
topped the Golden Bears 6-1.

doubles point on Court 2, defeating
Cal's Casey Louie and David
Melmed, 8-5. Stanford was able to
overcome the first break of
Thomas' serve in recent memory
to pull ahead in that match 6-5
when the No. 1 match ended. With
Melmed serving, Thomas could not
return two of Melmed's serves on
break point. After Thomas and
Becker fought off a game point
against them, Thomas finally
broke Melmed by angling a sharp
left-to-right, cross-court volley just
beyond the reach of a drawn-in
Louie. With the needed break in
hand, Thomas then served out the
match.
"[Louie and Melmed 1 were a
team which forces other teams to
beat themselves," Becker said.
"They were not bad or good. They
just made us play. We played badly
in the beginning, but stepped up
our game at the end. That was
good because in the past we've
played better in the beginning and
worse at the end."
Beginning singles action with
the psychological advantage of hav
ing won the doubles point, most of
the Stanford players appeared
loose on the courts. Sixth-ranked
Jeff Salzenstein breezed to a 6-4,6-
0 victory over 51st-ranked Michael
Hill on Court 1. It was the second
time in the last week that Salzen
stein had discouraged his opponent
in the second set.
"Jeff wore the guy down," said
Stanford head coach Dick Gould.
"His mental toughness really
showed, winning 6-0 after a close
first set. . .That's the mental
toughness of a champion."
Becker notched the third Cardi

nal point of the day, a 6-4, 6-3 vic
tory over Jackmon in No. 6 singles.
Becker is one of five Cardinal
starters who remain undefeated
this season in singles.
Then 40th-ranked Goldstein
clinched the dual match with a 6-1,
6-4 victory over Melmed in No. 3
singles. Melmed was recovering
from a recent bout with the flu,
and was also suffering from an
injury to his hand that prevented
him from hitting a two-handed
backhand.
"Paul didn't play very well, but
despite that, continues to roll,"
Gould said.
The usually slow-finishing
Thomas got through his No. 4 sin
gles match uncharacteristically
early, defeating Bobby Mahal, 6-2,
6-3. Mahal had beaten Thomas two
weeks earlier in a qualifying match
for the Sybase Open.
"[Thomas] was on top of me
from the beginning," Mahal said.
"He deserved to win today."
In No. 5 singles, Elliott defeated
Kian Raiszadeh, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2. The
Cardinal sophomore from Palo
Alto continued to have problems
serving due to the harness he now
wears to prevent his shoulder from
dislocating. Raiszadeh forced the
first-set tie-break by converting
two perfect passing shots on suc
cessive set points while down 5-6.
In the second set, however, Elliott
was able to dominate by altering
his style of play.
"I started kicking in my serve
more," Elliott said, "and staying
back coming off his return instead
of serving and volleying."
The last match left on the
courts was a tight No. 2 match
between 22nd-ranked Louie and
33rd-ranked Humphries. The
match was as close as their rank
ings would indicate, with Louie
pulling out a 7-5, 7-5 victory. The

loss, which was Stanford's first sin
gles dual-match defeat of the sea
son, was caused by deficiencies in
Humphries' serve, as well is in the
way he chose to play his points
against the speedy Louie.
As Gould noted, "Scott really
struggled with his serve, and of
course that affected how well he
could volley."
But Humphries also failed to
account for the Michael Chang-like
abilities of Louie. The Cal junior
from Sunnyvale is übiquitous on
the court, covering long distances
and keeping the ball in play with
ground strokes that lack pace but
rarely miss. It can be frustrating to
play against a player like Louie
who gets to every shot, but there
are ways to beat him. One of the
best ways to beat an accomplished
grinder such as Louie is to neutral
ize his quickness by not trying to
beat him at his own game.
Humphries was unable to do this.
"I played his game more than
my game," Humphries said. "I got
caught at the baseline and pretty
much played right into his hands."
Against the Huskies on Friday,
Stanford had few problems.
Salzenstein defeated Mark Toman
dl 6-0, 6-1.
Humphries defeated Ornello
Arlati, 6-2, 6-2. Humphries might
have benefited from the fact that
he attended high school with
Arlati.
"I knew him and I knew his
game, " Humphries said.
Nick Williams fell to Goldstein,
6-0, 6-1. Thomas defeated Scott
Moore, 7-6, 6-2. Elliott beat Tim
Gottesman 6-3, 6-4. And Becker
defeated Tori Dapas 6-4, 6-3.
The Cardinal also swept their
doubles matches with Washington,
winning 8-2 in No. 1 doubles, 8-5 at
the No. 2 spot, and 8-4 on the No. 3
court.
