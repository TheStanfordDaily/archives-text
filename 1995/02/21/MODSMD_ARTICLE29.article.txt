The Stanford tree bent but did not break last Fri
day and Saturday at Stanford Tennis Stadium, as
the top-ranked Cardinal men's tennis team (8-0)
withstood a mild shaking from a group of Washing
ton Huskies (4-2) and No. 19 California Bears (4-1)
intent on bringing the undefeated Cardinal down
from the perch of its perfect record.
But it was the Huskies and the Bears who were
dealt their first defeats of the young season, with
Washington being shut out by a score of 7-0 and Cal
doing only slightly better, succumbing by a count of
6-1.
The Bears provided the Cardinal with the best
competition of the weekend, mustering a No. 1 dou
bles upset of a Stanford tandem that had looked
invincible until last Saturday, and sending a No. 2
singles wake-up call to Scott Humphries, the Cardi
nal freshman phenom who had previously been at
the top of his game.
A near-capacity crowd watched as Cal's Michael
Hill and Bobby Mahal snapped the 18th-ranked
Humphries and Paul Goldstein's 19-match doubles
winning streak with an 8-5 victory. The streak,
which dated back to October, included doubles
championships in four major tournaments: the
Rolex NorCaJ, National Collegiate Classic, Pacific
10 Conference Indoors, and Rolex Intercollegiate
Indoors.
"I knew [Hill and Mahall were going to give us a
tough match," Humphries said.
Hill and Mahal, who last November had lost to
Stanford's No. 2 doubles team of Jim Thomas and
Ricky Becker, 9-8 (7-1), were able to use the combi
nation of Hill's good hands and Mahal's excellent
returns of serve to tie the doubles match score at
one apiece. Stanford's Jeff Salzenstein and Grant
Elliott had already defeated Cal's No. 3 duo of
Nathan Jackmon and Julian 8-4.
But Thomas and Becker were able to pull out the

Junior Ricky Becker displays his mighty serve, possibly the best Stanford has to
offer. Becker and doubles partner Jim Thomas lost to Cal's Michael Hill and Bobby
Mahal, but Becker won his singles match over Tori Dapas 6-4, 6-3 as the Cardinal
topped the Golden Bears 6-1.
