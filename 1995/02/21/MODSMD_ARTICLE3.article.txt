# ASSU Senate gears up for busy meeting
## Senators will vote on proposal to create class presidents and Stanford Fund plan 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Contributing writer 
The ASSU Senate is
gearing up for a marathon
meeting tonight with plans
to discuss seven different
bills, including the recently
released Stanford Fund
proposal and the creation
of class presidents.
The ASSU will decide
tonight whether to endorse
the proposal of the Stan
ford Fund task force. The

plan, which would take effect Sept. 1, allows
student groups to earn funds by either work
ing for the Stanford Fund or by asking for do
nations under the guidance of the Office of
Development. Donations, however, may only
be solicited between Feb. 1 and July 1.
"The main goal of introducing [the plan]
is to begin to inform student senators of the

intricacies of the proposal and how everyone
will fit in to it," said Stephen Russell, com
mittee member and undergraduate senator.
Although many student organizations
have said the plan will not significantly affect
them, committee member and Deputy Sen
ate Chair Michael Choo said the plan will af
fect student groups more than they think.
"We have to look at the fact that $150,000
has been freed up that did not exist before. It
is a whole new source of funding for student
groups," Choo said. "This is a bonus to stu
dent activities."
Committee and Council of Presidents
member Lisa Lee is fairly certain that the
plan will pass.
"I'm pretty confident that it will be en
dorsed," Lee said. "Most senators that I have
talked to think that it covers the diverse in
terests of student groups on campus."
Graduate senator Donald Aingworth


Russell
said, however, that there are a lot of
problems with the proposal.
"I wonder why the administra
tion is making student groups jump
through hoops," he said. "Why is
the Office of Development charging
money for labels? They should be
making money from this. It's also
silly for the administration to
review mailings."
But Aingworth said he would
probably vote for the proposal, since
it is most likely the best compromise
possible.
Another issue which the senate
will consider is the creation of class
presidents for sophomores and
juniors, based on the model of
senior class presidents.
If the bill is enacted, four junior
and four sophomore class presi
dents would be elected in the spring
election. Six freshman council mem
bers would be chosen in the fall by
the other class presidents. One class

president from each class and two
freshman council members would
become ex-officio members of the
ASSU.
The purpose of the bill, according
to bill co-author and undergraduate
senator Liane Nomura, "is to foster
class unity among underclassmen."
One of the reasons for the deficit
of class unity, said undergraduate
senator and bill co-author Rupali
Gandhi, is that all of the responsi
bility for class activities (excluding
the senior class) is vested in the
ASSU.
"It's really a lot of work for the
senate to have to take on when they
have other responsibilities," she
said.
This bill would solve that prob
lem, bill co-author and COP mem
ber Mork Murdock said.
"This bill is meant to create posi
tions ... that will coordinate events
for the sophomore, junior and frosh
classes. They will plan events like
semi-formals or parties," he said.
"Under the current system, there is
orientation and senior class events
and nothing in between."

Class presidents could also deal
with academic issues like choosing a
mqjor or applying for jobs or gradu
ate school, Murdock said.
Another benefit of the bill, Choo
said, is that "people who feel a sense
of class unity are more likely to
donate money as alumni."
Russell, however, said that he
thinks class presidents are unneces
saiy.
"Why do we need class presi
dents? I'm not sure what tasks they
would be given which would require
new bureaucracy," Russell said.
"I'm concerned that this is not in
the students' best interest."
Gandhi was fairly confident that
the bill would pass the senate since
most people agree that class unity is
a problem.
Murdock also noted that this bill
had the support of the Office of
Development and the administra
tion.
Another issue that the senate
will consider tonight is a change in
the by-laws of the ASSU Speakers
Bureau.
"The bill changes the committee

which picks the Speakers Bureau
director," said Speakers Bureau
director Scott Moss. "Currently, the
Speakers Bureau has very little say
in choosing its leader. We aren't
asking for any more power than any
other group has. This bill strikes a
balance between ASSU oversight
and student group control."
The bill would change the com
position of the committee which
selects the director of the Speakers
Bureau from one which includes
one COP member, two senators, the
ASSU administrative manager and
the current Speakers Bureau direc
tor, to one composed of the current
director, the assistant director, the
ASSU financial manager, and an ex
officio member of the ASSU, Moss
said.
The senate will also hear a draft
for a new special-fee reform propos
al, Murdock said.
"We probably won't come with a
formal proposal," Murdock said.
"We will come with the changes that
we propose to make. We're not hav
ing it come up for debate until
March 7."
