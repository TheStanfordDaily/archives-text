## Senators will vote on proposal to create class presidents and Stanford Fund plan 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Contributing writer 
The ASSU Senate is
gearing up for a marathon
meeting tonight with plans
to discuss seven different
bills, including the recently
released Stanford Fund
proposal and the creation
of class presidents.
The ASSU will decide
tonight whether to endorse
the proposal of the Stan
ford Fund task force. The

plan, which would take effect Sept. 1, allows
student groups to earn funds by either work
ing for the Stanford Fund or by asking for do
nations under the guidance of the Office of
Development. Donations, however, may only
be solicited between Feb. 1 and July 1.
"The main goal of introducing [the plan]
is to begin to inform student senators of the

intricacies of the proposal and how everyone
will fit in to it," said Stephen Russell, com
mittee member and undergraduate senator.
Although many student organizations
have said the plan will not significantly affect
them, committee member and Deputy Sen
ate Chair Michael Choo said the plan will af
fect student groups more than they think.
"We have to look at the fact that $150,000
has been freed up that did not exist before. It
is a whole new source of funding for student
groups," Choo said. "This is a bonus to stu
dent activities."
Committee and Council of Presidents
member Lisa Lee is fairly certain that the
plan will pass.
"I'm pretty confident that it will be en
dorsed," Lee said. "Most senators that I have
talked to think that it covers the diverse in
terests of student groups on campus."
