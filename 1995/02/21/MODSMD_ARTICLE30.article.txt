.v..v..:

ing fifth game that ended in a
24-22 score.
The Cardinal (7-2 overall, 4-
1 in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) started its
tall lineup, playing 6-foot-10-
inch sophomore Brian Moore at
opposite hitter. Stanford con
trolled most of the first game,
with outside hitter Matt Fuer
bringer putting away crucial
balls. Game two started well

After a roller coaster victory
over UC-Santa Barbara Friday
night, the Stanford men's vol
leyball team took little time to
settle its stomach — and domi
nated California the next night.
The No. 4 Gauchos traded
punches with second-ranked
Stanford for four long games
(13-15, 15-13, 6-15, 15-12),
before falling in a gut-wrench

again for Stanford, with Fuer
bringer chalking up a string of kills
and blocks.
However, the Cardinal ran into
trouble with its Achilles heel — the
serve-receive, especially against
jump-servers. Stanford tried to
secure its passing by inserting
sophomore swing hitter Aaron Gar
cia and freshman outside hitter Tad
Hoffman, but Santa Barbara sopho
mores outside hitter Donny Harris
and middle blocker Robert Treahy
nailed serves that cuffed the Stan
ford passers.
"In games two and four, we gave
up points mainly with our passing,"

said coach Ruben Nieves. "In game
four, they scored six of their 15
points off serves, and that's just too
many. We'll continue to face good
servers, but we can't give up that
many points in such a short space of
time."
The Gauchos (7-4 overall, 6-3 in
the MPSF) also had their share of
serve-receive problems. In game
three, Santa Barbara substituted
out 1993 Ail-American junior swing
hitter Amaury Velasco in an
attempt to bolster its passing. Even
with the Gauchos' attempts to
tweak their passing game, Stanford
put the game away on the strength
of freshman outside hitter Devin
Poolman's jump-serves.
In the decisive sideout-scoring
fifth game, the Cardinal coaches
played Hoffman in place of Moore to

establish stronger serve-reception.
"My role is pretty much to pass
because that's what I do wen," Hoff
man said. "We had trouble passing
in the fourth game, so I came in to
try to steady us out and re-establish
our sideout flow."
After not starting the game well
with balls hit into the net, Stanford
again pulled back with Poolman's
serving. The game had all of Maples
Pavilion on its feet, with neither
team able to put the other away
until a cl'mactic finish when Harris
misfired for the Gauchos.
"We were all having so much fun
playing that we weren't even all
that nervous," Fuerbringer said.
"That's why we practice so much —
when it comes down to it, you have
to have faith in your ability to win."
In this game and throughout the
match, junior swing hitter Mike
Lambert provided Stanford with a
consistently powerful attack. Lam
bert banged in kills from all posi
tions, with clutch hits from the
backrow "pipe" position. Lambert
finished the night with 31 kills and
a .377 attack percentage.
On Saturday night versus the
Cal club team, Nieves rested
starters Lambert and Fuerbringer.
However, Garcia stepped in to Lam
bert's position and continued the
hitting clinic. Garcia took aggres
sive swings from the front- and
back-court and tallied up 21 kills
and a .366 average in the short span
of three games (15-9,15-12,15-3).
"The position I played gets a lot
of sets," Garcia said. "I was just
lucky enough to put them away. We
were all really fired up to play. We
just played consistently and
focused."
The Bears put up a fight, with
opposite hitter Stewart Murray
actually challenging Stanford, but
they were out-matched. The Cardi
nal backed up its advantage in tal
ent with strong execution and over
came its serve-reception difficulties.
"This might have been our best
passing match of the season,"
Nieves said. "Some of Cal's servers
weren't as tough, but I still give all
the credit to Tad [Hoffman] and
Aaron [Garcia].
"In general, we played well. We
want to be better at sustaining our
level of intensity and concentration,
but tonight [against Cal] was great
— even in game two when Cal
picked it up, we maintained our
concentration and didn't get frus
trated. Vs. Santa Barbara, there
were spells when we let ourselves
get a little flat. Maybe we really took
a step forward tonight."

Much like the Cardinal in Friday's marathon victory over UC-Santa
Barbara, sophomore Michael Hoefer stretches to the limit vs. Hawaii.
