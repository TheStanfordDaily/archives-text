The Stanford women's tennis
squad aced its first substantial
tests of the season this weekend
as the team painted the Arizona
deserts with Cardinal in Tucson
on Friday and Tempe on Satur
day.
The Cardinal (7-0 overall, 2-0
in the Pacific 10 Conference)
established its prominence atop
the Pac-10's Southern Division in
defeating 7-2 an underrated Uni
versity of Arizona Wildcats squad

(8-1, 3-1 in the Pac-10) that had
bested perennial powerhouses Cal
and UCLA. The undefeated visi
tors continued their unbeaten
streak with a 5-2 triumph over
the Arizona State Sun Devils (4-3
overall, 1-3 in the Pac-10) who
also upset Cal and hung tough
with UCLA.
"It was even more of a test
than I thought it would be," head
coach Frank Brennan said. "But
we responded to the challenge."
Stanford opened the week-,


end's festivities by taking the first
five singles matches against the
Wildcats, subsequently clinching
the dual-match victory before Ari
zona had actually won a match.
Sophomore Katie Schlukebir once
again led the way with a convinc
ing 6-2, 6-3 victory in the No. 1
singles slot over Vicky Maes.
Freshmen Ania Bleszynski fol
lowed the leader effectively in tak
ing the No. 2 match 6-4, 6-2
against Eva Maria Schurhoff.
Senior Kim Shasby dropped the
only singles match of the day to
Stephanie Sammaritano 2-6, 7-6,
7-5 at No. 3 despite having oppor
tunities with a couple of match
points throughout the set.
The Cardinal's traditional
depth at the No. 4, 5 and 6 singles
matches proved to be the nail in
the Wildcats' coffin as sophomore
Sandra De Silva continued her

extremely successful season at
the No. 4 position with a 6-3, 6-1
whitewashing of Arizona's Angela
Bernal.
Freshman Julie Scott followed
suit 6-4, 6-4 despite the efforts of
her opponent, Melody Falco.
Senior Amy Chiminello found
herself in her toughest match of
the year against Betsy Miringoff,
but she prevailed 7-6, 7-5, secur
ing the Cardinal's sixth victory of
the season.
Stanford refused to let up,
however, as the Cardinal took two
out of the three doubles matches
as well. Arizona's Maes and
Schurhoff became the Wildcats'
second victorious competitors,
winning 1-6, 7-5, 6-3 as Bleszyns
ki and Schlukebir (4-2) continued
to get oriented with each other on
the doubles court.
Chiminello and Scott remained
Stanford's only undefeated dou
bles squad, downing Falco and
Sammaritano. Shasby and sopho
more Emily Burt (3-1) found their
way through a tough third dou

bles match, prevailing 7-6, 7-5.
The Cardinal found itself on an
earlier flight home on Saturday
night as it disposed of the Arizona
State Sun Devils 5-2 in just seven
of the usual nine matches.
The Sun Devils' two tri
umphant matches represented
the first two singles losses for the
Cardinal's extremely successful
freshmen Ania Bleszynski (4-1)
and Julie Scott (6-1).
Bleszynski, at her usual No. 2
spot, met her defeat at the racket
of Arizona State's Reka Cseres
nyes 6-1, 6-7, 7-6. Sun Devil Anna
Moll put a notch in Scott's loss
column with a 7-5, 6-2 victory.
Neither the freshmen or Bren
nan were overly disappointed
with the two defeats. "[Scott]
Humphries lost on Saturday, and
he and [Paul] Goldstein lost their
first doubles match too, so it was
like freshman orientation day on
Saturday," Brennan said, refer
ring to the Stanford men's team's
top freshman duo. "Better to do it
now then against Georgia in the

second round of the NCAA's."
The upperclassmen compen
sated effectively for the losses as
Schlukebir (6-0) paved the way to
Stanford's seventh dual-match
victory and second in the Pac-10
South, winning 7-6, 6-1 over
Joelle Schad. Shasby (4-1)
bounced back immediately from
Friday's heartbreaking loss to
down Kara Schertzer 7-5, 7-6.
De Silva (5-0) and Chiminello
(7-0) rounded out the upperclass
man sweep of the Sun Devils. De
Silva took her first set 6-4 and
then fought off Stephanie Lans
dorp's attempt to split sets in a 7-
6 tie-breaker victory in the second
'set. Chiminello cruised once
again, seizing an easy 6-0, 6-2
match over Julie Coppinger.
Scott shook off her singles
defeat in teaming up with
Chiminello for the fifth and con
cluding Cardinal match, breezing
past Moll and Schertzer 6-2, 6-3.
Scott and Chiminello have com
piled a 6-0 record playing in the
second doubles slot.
