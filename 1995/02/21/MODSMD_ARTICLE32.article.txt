## First home loss for women gymnasts 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
It seems that the Stanford
women's gymnastics team spends
more time in the training room
then it does in its state of the art
gymnasium.
Despite a superb performance,
the Cardinal suffered its first
home loss of the season Friday
evening. Arizona outgunned a
Stanford squad weakened by
injuries 193.1 to 191.625 in a bat
tle between two Pacific 10 Con
ference powerhouses.
"I thought it was our best per
formance of the year," Coach
Breck Greenwood said. "When
we are healthy, we're as good as
anybody in our conference."
Injuries forced several mem
bers of the Cardinal team to com
pete after very limited practice,
particularly on the vault. Senior
Meegan Lannin performed just
two vaults all week, her warm-up
vault and the one she completed
in the meet. Sophomore Ariel
Passanisi vaulted sparingly dur
ing practice because of sore
knees, but was pressed into ser
vice because of injuries to her
teammates. Although having
only five competitors, Stanford
held its own, scoring a 47.775.
From vault the Cardinal
moved to the uneven bars, where
senior co-captain Jene Elzie led
the team with a 9.825. Strong
performances by freshman Keri
Monahan and Christie Jones
enabled the squad to score an
impressive 48.175.
"I thought we had a great per
formance," Jones said. "We had a
lot of energy and stayed within
ourselves."
The beam team, led by fresh
man Misty Moore's 9.7, almost
outscored Arizona's group
despite counting a fall. Perhaps
the highlight of the evening came
on the floor exercise, where
senior Tina Snowden won the
event with a stellar performance
that earned her a 9.825. Stanford
prevailed on the floor with just
five gymnasts, scoring 48.2
points compared to 48.05 for the
Wildcats.

The Cardinal would like to have flipped its fortunes in this Friday's
narrow loss to Arizona. A series of injuries limited Stanford's effec
tiveness.
