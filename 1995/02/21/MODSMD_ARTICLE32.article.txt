# Feel their pain
## First home loss for women gymnasts 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
It seems that the Stanford
women's gymnastics team spends
more time in the training room
then it does in its state of the art
gymnasium.
Despite a superb performance,
the Cardinal suffered its first
home loss of the season Friday
evening. Arizona outgunned a
Stanford squad weakened by
injuries 193.1 to 191.625 in a bat
tle between two Pacific 10 Con
ference powerhouses.
"I thought it was our best per
formance of the year," Coach
Breck Greenwood said. "When
we are healthy, we're as good as
anybody in our conference."
Injuries forced several mem
bers of the Cardinal team to com
pete after very limited practice,
particularly on the vault. Senior
Meegan Lannin performed just
two vaults all week, her warm-up
vault and the one she completed
in the meet. Sophomore Ariel
Passanisi vaulted sparingly dur
ing practice because of sore
knees, but was pressed into ser
vice because of injuries to her
teammates. Although having
only five competitors, Stanford
held its own, scoring a 47.775.
From vault the Cardinal
moved to the uneven bars, where
senior co-captain Jene Elzie led
the team with a 9.825. Strong
performances by freshman Keri
Monahan and Christie Jones
enabled the squad to score an
impressive 48.175.
"I thought we had a great per
formance," Jones said. "We had a
lot of energy and stayed within
ourselves."
The beam team, led by fresh
man Misty Moore's 9.7, almost
outscored Arizona's group
despite counting a fall. Perhaps
the highlight of the evening came
on the floor exercise, where
senior Tina Snowden won the
event with a stellar performance
that earned her a 9.825. Stanford
prevailed on the floor with just
five gymnasts, scoring 48.2
points compared to 48.05 for the
Wildcats.

The Cardinal would like to have flipped its fortunes in this Friday's
narrow loss to Arizona. A series of injuries limited Stanford's effec
tiveness.
Arizona gymnast Darci Wamb
sgans won the all around competi
tion, edging Elzie 38.750 to
39.725. Monahan finished third
with 38.7 points.
Although the Cardinal lost the
meet, the Stanford team remains
upbeat.
"We felt we had a really good
meet," said senior co-captain
Katie Clancy. "We were psyched."

Another positive sign for the
Cardinal was the presence of
sophomore all-arounder Katie
Jennings. She entered the hospi
tal last Tuesday evening feeling
extremely ill, and doctors were
struggling to find the cause of her
sickness. Luckily, they discovered
the culprit.
"The anti-inflammatory medi
cation I was taking for my back
gave me an ulcer," Jennings said.
"They recommended rest."
Moore, also weakened by sick
ness this week, nevertheless
delivered an inspired perfor

mance that earned her the honor
of 'wearing the vest,' a tradition
started by last year's squad. The
winner of the vest is determined
by the team and granted to the
gymnast who provides an added
spark with her performance. It
must be worn all week and carries
a punishment too severe to
describe should one of her team
mates see her detached from it.
"I wonder about what people
think of me wearing the same
thing everyday," Moore said. "But
it is an honor, and we wear it with
pride."
