# Cardinal swims past Cal

### John Fabian Staff writer 
Once again, the Cardinal men's swimming team
has ridden an ever-increasing streak of momentum
and confidence to a very convincing win over a sup
posedly competitive opponent.
Saturday afternoon, the Cardinal trekked to
Berkeley for its final dual meet of the season against
the fourth-ranked Golden Bears. It was a beautiful
day at Cal's outdoor Spiker Pool, but the sun just
didn't seem to shine on the Bears. With music play
ing before the meet, Cal seemed pumped up for the
Stanford men, but their enthusiasm did not last
long — the Cardinal slashed through the pool with
five NCAA qualifying times, five Spiker Pool
records, 14 victories in 15 events and an impressive
186-110 victory.
"It was a beautiful day and a great crowd." said
Stanford head coach Skip Kenney. "We were ready."
Stanford's readiness was apparent from the very
beginning. In the first three events, the Cardinal
achieved NCAA qualifying times, even though the
men are swimming unshaved and have begun taper
ing their training in preparation for the Pacific 10
Championships March 2-4.
Senior Brian Retterer, the American record hold
er in the 100-yard backstroke, led off the meet with
a qualifying time and pool record in the 100-meter
backstroke. He was followed by senior Kurt Grote
and freshman Sabir Muhammad, who duplicated
these feats in the 100 breast and the 100 butterfly.
Muhammad's pool record in the 100 fly surpassed
one set by Stanford alum Pablo Morales, who won
the gold medal in that event in the 1992 Olympics.
"We started off really well," said sophomore Matt
Martin. "In the first three events we made automat

ic qualifying times — and that set the tone for the
meet."
As quickly as Cal had gotten up for the meet, it
seemed to be set back down by the Cardinal's early
victories, and the Bears never really recovered.
"We thought we'd win," Kenney said, "but we
thought they'd win some more events. This year
teams have not even put up an effort against us.
Maybe it's an intimidation factor."
Whatever the reason, Cal was never really in the
meet. The only race the Bears won was the 200 fly.
an event in which Stanford's best swimmer, Ray
Carey, is out for the year. But for his injury, this
would have been a clean sweep.
"Their top backstroker swam in the 200 [Individ
ual Medley] and quit with 50 yards to go," Retterer
said. "They may have been intimidated, and we have
all the Stanford alums and all the Stanford fans to
thank for that. It's amazing that people get up for us
and then are so intimidated."
Once again, the Cardinal posted a big win on the
road, asserting its position, according to Kenney, as
"the best traveling team in the country." Many of
the swimmers attribute their success on the road
and their ability to get fired up to their closeness as
a team.
"A lot of teams don't have the chemistry that we
do," Grote said. "They don't have each other to fall
back on. There's a point in the meet where they
seem to say Stanford's unstoppable and they just
quit."
And Stanford was definitely unstoppable on Sat
urday.
"It was maybe the best dual meet ever with Cal,"
Kenney said. "In fact, it was maybe one of the best
