# Men tumblers fall by a tenth
## 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
Every Stanford student has a
thousand reasons to hate Cal. For
the fourth-ranked men's gymnas
tics team, No. 1001 arrived in the
form of a heartbreaking loss at
Harmon Arena at Berkeley last
weekend.
In a classically close Cal-Stan
ford matchup, the Cardinal lost
by a tenth of a point, 227.60 to
227.50. A strong finish on the last
event by the Golden Bears accom
panied by Stanford's rough show
ing enabled California to eclipse a
1.45 point lead and take the title.
Entering the final event — the
high bar for Cal and the vault for
Stanford — the Cardinal seem
ingly had the competition in
hand. However, a combination of
questionably high scores given to

Cal and a lapse by the Cardinal
resulting in four out of six failed
vault attempts provided a suffi
cient boost to put Cal on top.
Individually, senior Josh Stein
and sophomore Keith Wiley led
the Stanford effort, tying for the
all-around title and placing near
the top in almost every event.
Among the other top performers
was sophomore lan Bachrach,
who finished fourth on the high
bar and won the vault, the event
that gave the rest of his team
mates fits. Freshman Tim Dal
rymple turned in a strong effort
as well, placing highly in the rings
and on the parallel bars.
Sophomore Jamie Ellis also
contributed with a fourth place
finish in the all-around. Ellis'
spectacular high bar routine was
a central focus of the competition
for the Cardinal as the judges

returned a surprisingly low score.
The dissatisfaction was com
pounded later as the judges deliv
ered the decisively high marks for
Cal's high bar performers.
Freshman specialist Clarence
Miao expressed the general dis
content felt by the team.
"The scores definitely didn't
reflect the quality of the sets on
either side," Miao said, "but I
guess that's just a part of having
the home-gym advantage."
Beyond the questionable judg
ing and the close loss, however,
the team felt surprisingly good
about the meet. Clearly, the per
formance was an improvement
from two weeks ago, when the
Cardinal turned in a lackluster
effort en route to beating San
Jose State. Decimated by injuries
and fatigue and racked by incon
sistency, the squad was left shak
en by a startling wake-up call.

"This meet was pretty solid for
the whole team," Bachrach said.
"There were a few misses here
and there, but the progress we've
made, especially from San Jose
State, is great.
"The whole team unity thing
fell into place too. Things have

been kind of crazy so far with
Nationals and everything. I think
we really came together for the
first time at this meet."
Stein provided the best indica
tion of the team's focus. "We
obviously would have liked to
have won, but this meet is not

what we're concentrating on. In
the long run, NCAAs are what
matter.
"At this point in the season,
we're where we want to be; we
still have room for improvement
and we're constantly working in
that direction," Stein said.
