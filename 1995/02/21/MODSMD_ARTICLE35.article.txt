# Salute to UConn
## 
### 
So they lost. So they got
blown out at home. So
they dropped from No. 1
to No. 5 in the polls.
But if you think any of that
is going to dampen my enthusi
asm for UConn basketball,
then you're as crazy as some
one who thinks Hillary Clinton
is good for America.
You see, Connecticut finally
has something to brag about it.
No. 1 or No. 5, it doesn't matter
— I'm going to harp about
UConn hoops until you're all as
sick of hearing about Connecti
cut basketball as you are of
hearing about Texas.
The state of Connecticut,
contrary to popular belief, is
not a colony of New York, nor is
it sometimes known as Lower
Massachusetts. It is a place
where the independence and
work ethic of New England
have combined with the more
worldly aspects of New York to
create a truly unique environ
ment — one that boasts the
nation's second highest per
capita income.
Not blessed with abundant
natural resources, Connecticut
produces well beyond its
means, in industry as well as
basketball, causing George
Washington to once say that
the Revolutionary War could
not have been won without
Connecticut's supplies.
Still, despite our state's suc
cesses, we have never had a real
good reason to get excited in

Connecticut, especially in the
sports arena. Without a pro
team of our own (I absolutely
refuse to count the Whalers),
we've been forced to adopt
other states' squads. Dominat
ed by the media of Boston and
the Big Apple, we have had to
swallow the Celtics and the
Knicks, the Red Sox and the
Yankees, and the Patriots and
the Jets as long as I can remem
ber.

But now we've got some
thing of our own. And it feels
much better and more natural
than rooting for one of those
other teams. The UConn hoops
teams have risen like the sun
out of the college town of
Storrs, lighting up the darkness
of the Connecticut sports
world.
Storrs is a very surprising
place for hope to spring from.
It's the sort of town you might
end up in if you were driving
between New York and Boston
