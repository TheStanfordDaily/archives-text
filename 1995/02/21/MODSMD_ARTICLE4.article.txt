Students perusing this week's Stanford Review
may notice a certain visible part of the newspaper has
changed.
For the first time this year, The Review has chosen
not to publish its controversial Native American car

newspaper publishes its up or down commentary on
campus figures.

squatting before a bonfire.
The caricature, which drew anger and protest
from many campus Native American organizations
and complaints from the administration, was adopt
ed last fall by former Review editor in chief Aman Ver
jee.
The change in mascots comes as part of a new vol
ume for The Review, which is now headed by Mike
Meyer.

feature in a racist light ... was reason enough to
change the feature."
Native American students staged several protests
last quarter and asked University President Gerhard
Casper to censor the Review. In one act of protest,
students ripped up copies of the paper and deposited



The Stanford Review's new edi
tor has replaced the controver
sial Indian Chief caricature, top,
with a photograph for the con
servative publication's "Smoke
Signals" section.
