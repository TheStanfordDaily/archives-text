# Review tries new Indian Chief mascot
## Removes protested caricature 
### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
Students perusing this week's Stanford Review
may notice a certain visible part of the newspaper has
changed.
For the first time this year, The Review has chosen
not to publish its controversial Native American car
icature in the "Smoke Signals" section, where the
newspaper publishes its up or down commentary on
campus figures.
Instead, the drawing has been replaced with a sil
houette photograph of a Native American chief
squatting before a bonfire.
The caricature, which drew anger and protest
from many campus Native American organizations
and complaints from the administration, was adopt
ed last fall by former Review editor in chief Aman Ver
jee.
The change in mascots comes as part of a new vol
ume for The Review, which is now headed by Mike
Meyer.
In his "From the Editor" address, Meyer writes,
"the simple fact that someone might interpret the
feature in a racist light ... was reason enough to
change the feature."
Native American students staged several protests
last quarter and asked University President Gerhard
Casper to censor the Review. In one act of protest,
students ripped up copies of the paper and deposited

them in front of Building 10. Last
December, Native American
groups and Review staff met to dis
cuss possible solutions but were
not able to reach a compromise.
Lawrence Tovar, a linguistics
graduate student who spoke out
against The Review in that Decem
ber meeting, said he had no com
ment about the new photograph,
but added that the Stanford Amer
ican Indian Organization would
meet later in the week to discuss
the issue.
Meyer said that by changing the
caricature to a photograph he has
made a compromise. He hopes that
Native American groups will think
that "this guy coming from the
other side of the coin has made
some change and realize that their
hard-core position isn't appropri

ate for the situation," he said.
However, he said, "I don't really
expect to compromise further ...
after this point it would be a com
promise in ideology."
Though he had refused to
change the mascot, Veijee said he
supports Meyer's decision, adding,
"we have different goals and differ
ent styles and I support him in
that."
"From what I can tell, this
change won't make [Native Ameri
can organizations] any happier,"
Veijee said.
Veijee added that this "would
appease more moderate readers."
"I find nothing inherently
wrong with the mascot," Meyer
said, but added that since there
was "never intent by the Review to
offend anybody" and "there was no
racist intent," he had felt com
pelled to change it.
Meyer said he would meet with
opponents of the photograph if
needed.
