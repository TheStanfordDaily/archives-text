# Med School applicant pool hits record high
## Med Fac Sen also discusses harassment 
### Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing writer 
Sexual harassment policies,
medical school admissions and the
tenure proposal were topics of in
tense discussion at the School of
Medicine's Faculty Senate meeting
last Friday.
The Medical School received
7,066 applications this year, setting

a new record. So far, 127 students
have been offered admission, said
Norman Blank, director of Medical
School admissions.
The school will have to make ap
proximately 200 more offers to stu
dents before having a full class in
the end, he added.
"If you look at the records of peo
pie we reject without looking at
the whole pool of people, you'd
think it was madness," Blank
said.
Blank said he was concerned
that the school was receiving too
many applications.
"Seven thousand and sixty-six
applicants is a silly thing to brag
about — it's like bragging about
how many hangings you had," he
said.
Blank said he plans to make
clearer the qualities that the
admissions office looks for in the
application brochure.
"I don't want to scare off the
good applicants or the good
minority applicants, but we need
to reduce the number of appli
cants," he said.
There have been 44,320 medi
cal school applicants to all the
medical schools across the coun
try — up 2.7 percent from last
year, he said.
Though the number of black
male and white male medical
school applicants has decreased,
applications in every other catego
ry has gone up.
The question of faculty respon
sibility in sexual harassment
cases also sparked a great deal of
debate. "What is the extent of our
duty as faculty members to report
other people who are behaving
inappropriately?" asked Anatomy
Prof. Larry Mathers, head of the
Medical School Faculty Senate.
Faculty members said they

were concerned about their bur
den to report inappropriate
behavior that does not concern
them personally.
Mathers paralleled it to a stu
dent honor code, under which a
student is supposed to report
another student cheating even if
it does not concern him or her.
Faculty members also ques
tioned their legal duties, wonder
ing whether charges could be
brought against them if they did
not report a sexual harassment
case they had witnessed.
The discussion on sexual
harassment was sparked by
recent workshops for Medical
School faculty on the issue, in the
wake of a new University sexual
harassment policy passed last
year. Many faculty are concerned
about what their legal and moral
obligations are, both as faculty
and as citizens.
The Medical School recently
hired someone to deal with stu
dent and faculty concerns and to
help clarify the University's sexu
al harassment policy.
The senate also reported that
the committee charged with
investigating the new proposal to
make it harder to get tenure for
medical school faculty will meet
next week with a University Fac
ulty Senate committee investigat
ing the same thing.
"We will try to keep the senate
apprised of what is going on with
the tenure situation," Mathers
said.
Mathers also mentioned the
possibility of creating a formal
mechanism for faculty input
about the tenure proposal.
