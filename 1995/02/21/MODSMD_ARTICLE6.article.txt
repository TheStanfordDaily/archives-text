## Raza Day reaches out to 400 youths 
### Tristan Sorah Reyes Contributing writer 
Hoping to expose high school
students to the opportunities of
higher learning, Stanford Chicano /
Latino students kicked off their
fourth annual Raza Day Confer
ence last Saturday with speeches,
dances and workshops.
The conference was sponsored

by the Chicano / Latino student
group, MEChA, and is one of their
biggest events of the year. Over 400
Bay Area high-school students
filled Kresge Auditorium, sitting
underneath a banner which read
"Unidos En La Lucha Vencere
mos!" meaning "United in the
Struggle We Shall Prevail!"
Freshmen Cindy Urquidez and
Agustin Rodriguez, masters of cer
emony, told the students they had
been brought to Stanford to be
exposed to the opportunities of a
college education, encouraging
them to take all of the knowledge
and energy that they learned back
to share with their communities.
They also stressed that students
should take pride in their bilingual
ism and multiculturalism.
"We are brown and proud. You
should all be comfortable express
ing yourselves and showing your
colors," Urquidez said.
"You represent the future of
Chicanos and Latinos in the state
and nation, and it is up to you to
continue the struggle," MEChA
Co-chair Mireya Samaniego told
the students.
The conference's keynote
speaker was Dr. Jose Cuellar, chair
of La Raza Studies and director of
the C6sar Chavez Institute at San
Francisco State University. Cuel
lar, also known as the band leader
for Dr. Loco's Rockin' Jalapeno
Band, is a former Stanford profes
sor.
Cuellar said he was impressed
that students took the time to go to
the Saturday morning conference.

Attending the conference was one
of the most important things that
they could do, he added, saying it
would carry them through the rest
of their lives.
"Being here today will change
your lives dramatically. It will
move you into the positive realm.
Right here in this room are the
leaders of tomorrow," Cuellar said.
"You will all be making significant
changes in the world. You may not
know it, but that is why you are
here."
Cuellar told the students how
to overcome life's enemies,
adding that if they could deal
with these barriers and keep the
vision of helping community,
then they would overcome any
thing. He ended with a quote
from Winston Churchill: "Never
give up."
"The general assembly really
went well. Dr. Ijoco really set the
tone and got the crowd motivated,"
Urquidez said. "I hope the stu
dents leave here differently from
when they came, and take the
information that they have learned
here today and utilize it in their
lives and share it with other peo
ple."
The rest of the students' day
was spent in workshops â€” which
included subjects such as barrio
welfare, sexuality in the 1990s and
dance with Ballet Folklorico de
Stanford.
