### Tristan Sorah Reyes Contributing writer 
Hoping to expose high school
students to the opportunities of
higher learning, Stanford Chicano /
Latino students kicked off their
fourth annual Raza Day Confer
ence last Saturday with speeches,
dances and workshops.
The conference was sponsored

by the Chicano / Latino student
group, MEChA, and is one of their
biggest events of the year. Over 400
Bay Area high-school students
filled Kresge Auditorium, sitting
underneath a banner which read
"Unidos En La Lucha Vencere
mos!" meaning "United in the
Struggle We Shall Prevail!"
