# Six freshmen are swept out to sea
## Rescued by local surfers 
### Hussein Kanji Contributing writer 
Even on the sunniest of days, Half Moon Bay's
warm sandy beaches aren't always veiy nice places.
Six Stanford freshmen and a high school student
learned that the hard way this past Sunday, when a
riptide pulled them 150 feet from the shore of
Pompino State Beach.
With no lifeguards on the beach, the students were
stranded in the water for almost 20 minutes, until they
were rescued by three local high school surfers.
Suffering from hypothermia, three of the students
were flown in two helicopters to Stanford Hospital.
They were released from the hospital Sunday evening
— none with any serious injuries.
However, it was a scary situation for the students.
"I'm not quite sure what happened," said Zach Apter.
"A couple of waves split us apart... and the bottom
wasn't there anymore."
According to Apter, the group had been wading in
the water and holding hands, with waves crashing "8
feet over (their) heads."
They were caught suddenly by a riptide that "split
us up really quick," Apter said.
"One wave just lifted us up off the ground," said
Derek Norman, one of the students who was taken to
the hospital.
After ten minutes of struggling
with the water, Apter said he was
able to make it back to shore. Once
there he found the three surfers,
who swam out and rescued the rest
of the group on their boards.
One other student, Jessica
Hart man, was also able to make it
back to shore by herself.
The other five students tried to
swim back but kept being pushed
back. "The shore just wasn't get
ting any closer," Apter said.
According to Coast Guard Petty
Officer Thomas Barnard, a riptide
is a wave that "pulls you out while
the tide comes in. Basically if you
get caught ... [you are] better off
swimming with the tide and trying
to move parallel to beach."
Like many other students this
weekend, the freshmen had simply

gone to the beach to enjoy the gor
geous weather.
Not all of the students were
caught in the riptide. Two of their
companions were out of the water,
but were too far away to spot the
rest of the group in trouble.
Now that the students are safe,
they said they hope to meet with
their rescuers. Although they don't
have the surfers' phone numbers,
they know that the three are seniors
at James Logan High School.
Normally, if an area is prone to
riptides it is usually marked with
signs, Barnard said. But Norman
said there were no signs on the
beach.
There were also no lifeguards on
patrol at the beach. State offices
were closed for the holiday yester
day and beach officials could not be
reached for comment.
The other students caught in
the riptide were freshmen Chris
Tin, Jason Suh and Ive Aaslid, and
Aaslid's younger sister, who was
visiting from Seattle.
