George A. Collier
5/: Land and the
Zapatista Rebellion in Chiapas
(Food First Books, $12.95)
"A definitive book on the Zapatista rebel
lion in Chiapas . . . cogently argued and
beautifully written." -Evon Z. Vogt,
Professor Emeritus at Harvard University
"Collier provides the first comprehensive back

Neither romantic Indians nor backward peasants,
the agrarian peoples he describes are complex
social actors, caught up in cultural change and
economic crisis." -James Clifford, University of
California at Santa Cruz
