# Astute recruits
## Top frosh to get research grants 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
As a way to encourage top stu
dents to attend Stanford, freshmen
President's Scholars will receive a
$1,500 grant to conduct research
during their undergraduate years,
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions James Montoya announced
yesterday. _

Approximately
"75 of the most
academically tal
ented members"
of the incoming
freshman class
are honored as
President's
Scholars, Mon
toya said. They
are chosen "by

virtue of (their) extraordinary acad
emic potential," he added.
In addition to the research grant
— which begins next year — the
scholars will be flown to the Uni
versity "in much the same way the
University flies out athletic re
cruits," Montoya said.
"This is a program which re
cruits top scholars in much the
same way as top athletes," he said.
All this is aimed at increasing
student yield, Montoya said. The
program by itself, however, is "sig
nificant as (to) the statement it
makes about University commit
ment to undergraduate research
opportunities," he added.
Funds have already been allocat
ed for the research grants by the
president and provost, Montoya
said, but the exact details of the pro


Montoya
gram are still being worked out.
The students will conduct the
same type of research other
undergraduates do, even though
they are freshmen, Undergradu
ate Research Opportunities
Director Laura Selznick said.

Since the grant will come in the
form of a research account, the
scholars will have the money
available to spend when they are
ready for research.
In the past, the President's
Scholars program was known as
the David Starr Jordan Scholars
program. Last year, it was
renamed by the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid because the name

Jordan Scholars was "not associat
ed ... with academic excellence,"
Montoya said.
In its 1992-93 academic report,
the committee found that the Jor
dan Scholars program "had little
meaning for the students who
actually enrolled," Montoya said.
This problem led to increased
financial aid for scholars already
on aid and the institution of a fall
dinner last year.

The 1993-94 committee report,
presented this year, recommended
that the program be further
enhanced. According to Montoya,
the committee asked that the Uni
versity implement an early-deci
sion program, offer research
grants to President's Scholars and
make faculty members more
involved in the recruitment of
outstanding students in the appli
cant pool.
