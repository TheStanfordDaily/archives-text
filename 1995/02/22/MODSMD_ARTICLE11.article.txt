# Interim church dean reflects on religion

### Blair Lawson 
Christina Miller, recently appointed the
interim associate dean of Memorial Church,
said her job is one of spontaneity, remark
ing, "Ministry, like jazz, is an improvisa
tional art."
Having finished a residency in hospital
ministry at the Stanford Hospital in July,
Miller approached Memorial Church Dean
Robert Gregg to see if she could help in any
way during the search for Assoc. Dean
Diana Akiyama's replacement. Akiyama is
leaving next month to pursue a doctorate at
the University of Southern California.
Dean Gregg responded by formally offer
ing Miller the interim position.
"I'm really delighted about this," he said.
"She's a very talented person."
Although Miller was ordained as a Bap
tist minister, her views on spirituality are
non-denominational. "I see myself as help
ing folks with their spiritual needs wherev
er they are," she said.
This perspective will suit Miller's posi
tion as associate dean of the non-denomina
tional church. Her duties there will include
helping with Sunday worship, serving as
liturgist, committee work and one-on-one
counseling with individual students.
"I think a lot of things might come up for
which students would seek out a minister,"
said Miller. "That's a part of ministry that I
really like a lot — the one-to-one pastoral
relationship."
Miller acknowledged the difficulty of
incorporating spirituality into the highly
academic and even scientific atmosphere of

an institution like Stanford. "The spiritual
or emotional side of people isn't something
that's valued in people as much," she admit
ted. "It's not something that's easy to find a
place for."
That difficulty is perhaps exacerbated by
the spiritual diversity of such a multicultur
al environment as Stanford. "Now, there is
a lot more recognition that people are on
different paths," Miller noted. "There may
be no one way to give institutional expres
sion to things like this."
In spite of these issues, Miller asserted
that there are "spiritual dimensions that
shouldn't be forgotten. But Memorial
Church isn't the only place or way that's
expressed — there is a lot going on on this
campus, in terms of spiritual stuff."
Originally trained in nursing as an
undergraduate at the University of Califor
nia at San Francisco, Miller went on to
Kenya with the Peace Corps in the early
1970s to teach nursing.
Upon returning from Kenya, Miller spent
twelve years in clinical nursing in San Fran
cisco. Only when she adopted a son did she
decide it was time for an occupation that
would allow her, as she said, to "lead a more
normal life."
After working for several years for Syn
tex Pharmaceutical Company as a medical
magazine writer, Miller changed direction
again when she decided to go back to school.
Miller's husband, who was also in the
Peace Corps, inspired her with his own deci
sion to return to school. "He's the one that
gave me the courage to do it," she noted. In
four years at the Pacific School of Religion

in Berkeley, Miller earned both a Master of
Divinity degree and a master sin medical
ethics.
Miller was ordained at a predominately
African-American church in East Oakland.
"There are so many lessons to be learned
from immersing yourself in a different cul
ture," she said. Commenting on the highly
interactive character of church services
there, she said, "I learned more about how
to connect head and heart and soul in a
more integrated way."
Discussing her goals beyond Memorial
Church, Miller said, "My hope is, eventual
ly, to work full-time in hospital ministry,"
adding that hospital ministry would offer
the opportunity to combine her experience
in ministry with her background in nursing.
"The parts of nursing I always liked best
were the emotional and spiritual support,"
she said.
Miller smiled as she talked about her
family, describing her husband as "person
of faith and a spiritual person" who never
theless resists institutional religion. "But,
irony of irony, here I am a minister," she
said.
Her son, a senior at Palo Alto High
School, has, according to Miller, "sort of
reached that agnostic stage."
In addition to her interests in ministry
and nursing, Miller sings with the Oratorio
Society in Palo Alto, led by Greg Wait, choir
conductor at Memorial Church. While her
husband is a "fanatical fly-fisherman,"
Miller spends her free time cross-country
skiing, hiking and reading mystery novels
— her favorite way to unwind.
