State bills regulate gambling
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Cardroom gambling is
growing rapidly in California, and state officials
said yesterday they are worried about a possible
invasion by organized crime.
"Where gambling has existed without adequate
regulation and oversight, organized crime has
quickly filled the vacuum, lured by huge flows of
cash," State Attorney General Dan Lungren said
yesterday.
Lungren and four other legislators held a Capi
tol news conference to push bills to create a state
Gambling Control Commission to license card
rooms, which are now regulated by local govern
ments.
It is the third year for the attempt, which orig
inated when the Los Angeles County Sheriffs
Department noticed cardrooms were growing

beyond the department's ability to regulate them.
Last year, competing bills were defeated in a bat
tle that included Gov. Pete Wilson, Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown and Nevada and California
gambling interests.
California had 251 cardrooms with 1,774
tables in 1993-94. Lungren said an additional
3,655 tables are under development or proposed.
He said gross revenues generated by cardrooms
could jump from $706 million in 1993-94 to $2.3
billion if those proposed do open.
Gaming and Wagering Business magazine says
$7.5 billion is wagered each year in California
cardrooms, 88 percent of the national cardroom
gaming market. That puts California fifth in the
country in money wagered on all forms of legal
gambling, the magazine said.
The two other major forms of gambling, horse
racing and the lottery are regulated by the state.
