# U.S. to give Mexico $20 billion
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
United States and Mexico signed
an agreement yesterday that will
unlock $20 billion in U.S. sup
port to stabilize the Mexican
peso — but under tough terms
that could cause severe econom
ic and political distress in Mexi
co.
Officials in the Clinton admin
istration and the government of
Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo acknowledged that hard
times lie ahead for Mexico. But
they stressed the situation would
have been much worse without
the support package.
"Under these agreements,
Mexico should be able to take the
steps necessary to end its liquidi
ty crisis and in time the Mexican

economy, which is fundamental
ly sound, should stabilize," Trea
sury Secretary Robert Rubin
said at a signing ceremony.
In order to receive the U.S.
support, Mexico pledged to con
tinue a tight-money policy that
has already seen interest rates
soar to nearly 50 percent, to run
a budget surplus of 0.5 percent
this year and to move more
quickly toward privatizing state
run enterprises.
Mexican Finance Minister
Guillermo Ortiz said negotiators
had met virtually around the
clock since Thursday to hammer
out final details of the agree
ment. The slower growth will
have an impact in the United
States as well since Mexico is

America's third largest export
market. David Wyss, chief finan
cial economist at DRI-McGraw
Hill, a private consulting firm in
Lexington, Mass., said DRI was
forecasting U.S. exports to Mexi
co would drop by $10 billion this
year, translating into a loss of
350,000 U.S. jobs.
The $20 billion in U.S. loans
and loan guarantees is part of a
$52 billion international package
that includes $17.8 billion in
commitments from the Interna
tional Monetary Fund and $10
billion in funds from several
European countries.
The $20 billion in U.S. assis
tance is coming from a fund that
was established to support the
U.S. dollar.
