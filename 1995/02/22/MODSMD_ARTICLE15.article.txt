## Tree shouldn't fight 
### 
There is something
inherently amusing about last
week's fight between the Tree
and Oski. That truth must not
obscure the fact that the incident
casts Stanford in a bad light.
The best way to handle the issue
is to treat the tusslin' Tree as if he
were an athlete and hand him a one
game suspension for fighting.
At first this proposal seems to lie
between heartless and humorless;
stick with the analogy to athletes,
however, and it makes sense.
If one of Stanford's basketballers
got into a fight on the court, he or
she would receive a one-game sus
pension from the NCAA. This rule
reinforces the standards of good
sportsmanship and shows the fans
— especially children — that fist
fights are not an acceptable way to
express your anger. Additionally,
Stanford has an interest in suspend
ing players, the University's repre

sentatives, for poor conduct.
All of these rules should apply
equally to the Tree. Mascots are
involved in sport and so should
uphold the standards of good sports
manship. The Tree is admired by
fans, especially kids, and so needs to
lead by example. As a representative
of the University, it shouldn't get
into limb-and-paw fights.
Since it serves these same roles as
athletes, the Tree should face the
same punishment for fighting, and
the Athletic Department should levy
a one-game suspension.
It would be taking the fight too
seriously, however, to press criminal
charges — something Santa Clara
County is now considering. For good
reason, criminal charges aren't
pressed every time there's a fight in
a basketball game; most of the NBA
would be on probation.
A one-game suspension is the best
response.
