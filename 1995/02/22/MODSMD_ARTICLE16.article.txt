# Meyer: rent videos
## 
### 
FOR YEARS, students on the
Stanford campus have been
plagued by the difficult task of
acquiring movies to watch both for
enjoyment find research.
While students can rent videos
from off-campus sources at reason
able rates, many are not aware that
their favorite flick is most likely
already available on campus.
In truth, students need go no fur
ther than Meyer Library to find
videos. But this method only works if
they are willing either to watch the
videos in the library or find a resident
assistant to check them out â€” RAs
are the only students with this privi
lege.
As a result, students without cars
have no easy way to take advantage
of this resource which the library can
and should provide.
And while video rentals might not
seem like a key feature of the Stan
ford library system, students should
not be deprived of a resource which
the University already makes avail

able to faculty and RAs.
At the same time, however, the
library must look out for its collec
tion, and students would likely check
out videos very frequently if access
were broadened.
For this reason, the University
should institute an overnight check
out system for videos similar to the
one already in place for books. Stu
dents should be charged a nominal
fee for each check-out which would
account for the depreciation of the
videos which wear out far faster than
books.
Students could also be charged
overdue fees for videos using the sys
tem already in place for books.
Library administrators will
undoubtedly protest opening video
check-outs to the student body.
By instituting an intelligent sys
tem, however, which meshes well
with the current policies for books,
students could gain an invaluable
resource which the libraries at this
point have but are unwilling to share.
