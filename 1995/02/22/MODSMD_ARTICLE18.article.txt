## Fear and loathing in Paris 
### 
THE FRENCH are krazy, and I spell
that with a "k" intentionally. But
during my sojourn to Paris, I found
that there are creatures even more pecu
liar than the French. Read on.
It was a Saturday evening, and Jason
and I had made our way through the
stench-ridden tunnels of the Parisian
metro in a search for food. Little did we
know that our quest would soon bring us
face-to-face with the most ornery human
alive: the Crazy Scotsman.
We followed a narrow side street, and
ended up passing by several quaint, but
odd, restaurants: Chez Chien, Maison du
Lard, Bienvenue a I'Enfer. Perhaps we had
gone off the beaten path. However, Jason
and I decided to throw caution to the wind
and choose the restaurant with the most
intriguing name: Yin Judy. I don't think
that I need to remind you readers, that Yin
Judy is French for "Rudy's House of Pan
cakes."
Upon entering, we discovered a forbid
den dimension. An obscure album played
in the back of the room, mixing light
psychedelia with hard-line hillbilly music.
A plump, yet sinister, cat sat on a nearby
table, delicately picking peanuts off of a
tray and grinding them to crumbs with its
sharp, feline teeth. It then smiled at us,
quivering its thick tail.
The waiter, dressed completely in black,
appeared from nowhere and whisked us to
a table. "Here are your peanuts!" he cried
out in French, thrusting his hand forward.
"Those aren't peanuts," I cried, "They're

human heads!" But no, they were really
peanuts. I took them and began to munch.
We sat quietly, observing our foreboding
surroundings carefully. It was at this
point, my friends, that the Crazy Scots
man entered our lives.
"That damn cat loves peanuts," he
mumbled. He was a hairy man, and I do
not exaggerate. His hair was gray, tum
bling over his head in a sort of Beatles
fashion (pre-acid days). Wiry hair sprouted
out of his nose and ears as well. This man
was a fungus of hair. He spoke with a thick
British accent, so at the time I couldn't
have guessed he was a Crazy Scotsman.
Maybe a Hairy Brit. Or Fungus Man.
Jason and I simply nodded quietly while
devising a plan to escape this beatnik
prison. Unbeknownst to us, however, the
Crazy Scotsman was onto us. There was
no way he'd let us get out of this place
unscathed by his acid tongue. He slowly
began turning the conversation to the
outer limits.
"You know, boys, this next Pope is the
last one."
1 stared vacantly into his billowy eye
brows.
"Once the spaceship lands in '98, the
world will have no more need for a Pope."
I turned back to my peanuts and bit
down hard on one, trying to suppress the
rivers of tears that nearly spilled down my
face.
"Have you boys ever heard of the Leg
endary Island of Mu?"
I panicked. My heart began to pound

rapidly and sweat gathered on my face as I
twisted frantically in my chair, searching
for an exit, any exit. Faces began to melt
and the cat was sitting in the corner,
laughing maniacally. If you've ever heard a
cat laugh, then you know how evil the
sound is. I turned back to this mound of
hair to tell him how sorry I was that I had
to leave, when I finally saw what he was
wearing under the table.
This man was decked out in a full Scot
tish kilt, complete with belt-buckle and
wool socks up to his knees. The Crazy
Scotsman had stolen my soul. Grabbing
Jason, I ripped myself from the rubbery
chair and dashed for the door. The cat's
laugh was even louder now, echoing
throughout my head.
"Wait, hey wait!" said the Crazy Scots
man, but we weren't listening. Jason and I
ran wildly off into the night, vowing never
again to return to that twisted cavern.
I never did go back, and today I feel safe
knowing that I'm located thousands of
miles away from the Crazy Scotsman and
his hangout. But sometimes when its late
at night, I lie awake in my bed listening to
the frogs croak outside my window. And
sometimes, I think I can hear a cat laugh
ing at me. Maybe I should cut back on the
smack.
