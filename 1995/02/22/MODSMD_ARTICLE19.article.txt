Conservatives plan to 'feasV on affirmative action

THE RESULTS of Proposition
187 and the last national election
made it clea* to political conser
vatives that the next election in Cali
fornia is the time to feast with a
vengeance on affirmative action. And,
the reader does not have to go far to
find some of the architects of the feast.
A more scholarly representation of
the subject was made by Renaldo
Rosato in the Feb. 8 issue of the Cam
pus Report while discussing the sub
ject of so-called "affirmative action
stigma." As an African American, I
was stigmatized by the dominant soci
ety at birth, long before affirmative
action was conceived, and no matter
what I was to do after birth I would be
stigmatized by that society. The stig
ma remained when racial segregation
was declared unconstitutional; when
equal opportunity was adopted as a
national policy, the stigma remained.
More importantly, if and when affir
mative action is gutted or banned, the
stigma of race will remain into the

next millennium.
The Campus Report piece is also
correct on the topic of "separatism."
Complaints about students of color
gathering socially (as most normal folk
do) is just plain pitiful when one is
reminded of the depth of raw racism
perpetuated by red-lining in housing,
tracking of students in schools based
on color, and racial separatism in
employment, certain job categories and
senior positions. Need it be noted who
controls those institutions?
Were it not for affirmative action, it
is very unlikely that I would have been
invited to apply for employment at
Stanford â€” that's correct, invited.
Why? Because the thought never
occurred to me that Stanford was seri
ously interested in employing African
Americans; there was not much evi
dence of their presence at Stanford.
Recruitment is basically what affirma
tive action is all about, yet affirmative
action is a concept that is almost uni
versally and intentionally defined

incorrectly by its opponents.
I shall not be reticent or defensive
about affirmative action as long as
mediocrity is well represented among
"non-minority" (the University's ter
minology) staff at Stanford. Yet, it is
unfortunate, and a loss to the Univer
sity and the country, that race is more
of a stigma than mediocrity, especially
when the latter is resolvable.
The thrust of this opinion, however,
is not the fruitless effort of clarifying
affirmative action among deliberate
and permanent disbelievers. Instead, it
is to comment on the disappointing
lack of defenders of affirmative action
from interesting quarters. Media and
political analysts have informed the
country that the swing in the last elec
tion was due to "the angry white
male."
As Frank Wu correctly stated in the
Feb. 17 issue of The Daily, the primary
beneficiary of affirmative action has
been white women. Yet "non-angry"
white women have not responded in

kind to the mounting attack on affir
mative action. At the same time, they
give empty public praise to Anita, Lani,
Rosa, Fannie Lou and other "sisters."
Witness the situation at Stanford.
Women, mostly white, have successful
ly codified a University policy against
sexual harassment, which is needed.
Witness, further, their lack of endorse
ment or urging of a policy against
racial harassment. In effect, this
behavior reflects the old saying: "We
got ours; you get yours!"
In all of this, I am reminded of a
position taken by former Supreme
Court Justice Harry Blackmun in a
dissenting opinion, unfortunately, that
to get beyond racism, race must first
be considered. This is fundamental to
affirmative action. My friends, I regret
having to inform you that we have
here a very inconsiderate state and
nation.
