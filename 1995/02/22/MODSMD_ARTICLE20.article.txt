# Two visits not enough to generalize about the care offered by Cowell
## 
### 
From two visits to Cowell Student
Health Center and the authority of an
anonymous biology professor, David
Sung-Ku Chon concludes in his Feb.
17 letter that he "can give you better

care" than the Cowell staff, that Cow
ell's doctors are "bottom-of-the
trough," and that "Cowell harbors
poor service and even worse care." On
the basis of just as much data (two vis
its â€” one for a blood test and another
for advice) I've come to the opposite
conclusion: that Cowell provides con
sistently outstanding care. Doctors
and nurses have both given me fast,
friendly, and gentle service, and what
little I've heard about Cowell has been

uniformly positive.
But I don't mean to contest Chon's
claim with evidence as scant as his.
Instead, I want to suggest that if he
(perhaps along with others of his
acquaintance) thinks the Cowell center
as delinquent as he apparently does,
he should call for an ASSU investiga
tion. Such an objective, large-scale
study could determine whether the
faults he has observed reveal a wider
trend or simply reflect unavoidable

variation among staff members and
their moods over the course of long
and demanding workdays. To bewail
"how mechanical the doctors are, and
how they presume such positions of
power and make all the decisions for
the patients, abrogating any freedom
of choice," on the basis of anything
less, is ethically and scientifically irre
sponsible.
