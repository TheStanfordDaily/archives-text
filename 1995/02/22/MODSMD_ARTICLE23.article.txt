## How 'hard' is your water? Bug notes that taste won't be only difference 
### Cris Niell Staff writer 
Q:What's the deal with
this "hard water" stuff?
Can we drink it or what?

A:Well, by now everyone
probably knows that the
water around Stanford is
a little different than what
we're all used to. Either you
am taste or see the difference,
or maybe you just saw those
fliers in all the bathroom stalls.

(I'll tiy to resist making any childish puns with the
word "hard.")
Usually we get our water from the Hetch-Hetchy
reservoir, up in the Yosemite watershed. This is good
water — mostly melting from the snowcap — and it
runs over granite, so it's nice and pure. It's just like
Perrier, but without the benzene.
The problem is, the water has to run through a set
of pipes to get here, and those pipes haven't been
inspected or repaired for a while. So the San Francis
co Water District is shutting down the water supply
(that's one big spigot to turn off) so that it can attend
to these ancient pipes. As a result, we start getting
our water from other sources.
First of all, I will dispel the myth — when they say
we're getting water from "other sources," they don't
mean Lake Lag. Can you imagine the University let
ting us drink endangered salamander pee?
Actually, we're getting our water from several dif
ferent reservoirs, but primarily from the Calaveras
and San Antonio reservoirs in the East Bay. Unfor
tunately, this water isn't quite as pure as the pristine
Hetch-Hetchy. In fact, while the Hetch-Hetchy was
clean enough to come directly to us, our new water
has to go through treatment plants and filters before
it's drinkable.
This isn't due to toxic waste or sewage in the
reservoir (they dump all that down the drains into
the Bay), but primarily dissolved minerals and
organic substances. However, even after the treat
ment, the water contains more "stuff" than we are
used to — that's what makes it hard.
Whereas our old water was running over granite,
the new reservoirs are primarily sandstone and other
sedimentary and metamorphic rocks that can give up
more to the water. Thus, there is an increased leach
ing of ions, minerals, etc. by the water. As a result,
the source and reservoir will leave a different "fin
gerprint" on the water.
The government has set regulations determining
what the safe levels for contaminants in water are.
And, although the levels in our water are higher than
they were, they are still well within the standards.
So let's take a closer look at what we have in our
water now. There's the inorganic salts, such as sodi
um, potassium and calcium, which can increase the
electrical conductivity of the water.
There is an increased presence of alkalines, such
as bicarbonate (part of baking soda), borates and sil
icates. These can raise the pH of the water. However,
there has been little change in our pH, so you don't
need to worry about this.
There is also more organic carbon. This consists
primarily of sediments and decayed plant matter,
rather than human or animal remains and excre
ment.
The carbonates and salts are primarily responsi
ble for any taste the water may have. Of course, pure
water has no taste — your tongue has no receptors to
taste water — so any taste is coming from whatever
is dissolved in it.
Then there is the bathtub ring syndrome. In
water with dissolved minerals, soap doesn't work as
well. In normal water, the soap molecules are attract
ed to each other, so they can form suds and help
remove dirt.
However, in hard water, the minerals bind to the
soap molecules and prevent them from doing their
job (The property "hardness" is a measure of the
soap-consuming ability of the water. In other words,
harder water allows fewer soap suds to accumulate).
Such minerals are known as soap-consuming
molecules, because they take the soap out of com
mission.
This can leave you scrubbing your dishes harder,
or end up leaving a film on your plates or your bath
tub. This is because the compound formed from min
erals and soap is involved in a further association
with either the porcelain bathtub or glass plate or
other substrate which comes in contact with the
water.
So, if you really have noticed the difference, you
may be asking how long this will last. Well, if every
thing is in good shape, they hope to have the conduit
opened back up by the beginning of March. However,
if there's anything wrong, they might as well fix it
while they have everything cleared out, so be pre
pared for it to last an extra month or so.
Personally, I haven't noticed any big difference in
the water yet. But if you did, I'm sure you can fmd
some equally-attractive beverage to consume.
