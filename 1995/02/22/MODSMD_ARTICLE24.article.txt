# Conservation biology program in high school
## Stanford postdoctoral fellow takes big step in the 'greening' of U.S. education 
### Stacey Harp 
We live in a world that is con
stantly changing. Today, technology
is expanding while our wilderness is
shrinking. This change forces us to
view the future from different per
spectives, requiring new ways of
thinking and learning.
Much of the curriculum we use to
teach children has become ingrained
in our schools, with little room left
between the economic crisis our
schools now face and the academic
problems of American education to
insert new subjects that will be
important in the future.
However, researchers are now
working toward new curricula for
American students, to direct them in
learning new ideas and concepts that
were previously taught only at the
college level or not taught at all. One
of these educators is Dr. Robert
Blair, a postdoctoral fellow at Stan
ford's Center for Conservation Biol
ogy-
With the help of several local
teachers and Heidi Ballard, a Stan
ford graduate who has since become
a teacher at Gunn High School in
Palo Alto, Blair has created a cur
riculum in conservation biology for
high school students designed to fill
about three weeks of an introducto
ry biology class.
Blair defines conservation biology
as the science of biodiversity. "Con
servation biology was formed as a
discipline in 1986. So it's pretty
new," Blair said. "There are lots of
good curricula [for conservation
biology], but none at the high school
level."
Issues of conservation biology
have become newsworthy in recent
years due to situations such as the
destruction of the Amazon rain for
est and the conflict between loggers
and the northern spotted owl. Out of
this publicity grew a demand by
teachers for educational materials
on the subject. "A lot of teachers
were interested in being environ
mentally aware, but then they want
ed to go a step further to the science
behind it," Blair explained.
There was also the issue of where
this new curriculum would fit into a
high school curriculum already
strained by numerous state require
ments. "We decided that it would
probably fit into biology," Blair said,
"and because there are so many

requirements to meet during a year,
we had to make it a replacement for
the ecology unit. It is kind of an
applied ecology."
First, Blair wanted to create
materials that would give teachers a
solid background in conservation
biology. "Unlike most curricula, this
is really heavy on teacher and really
skinny on kid," Blair says, referring
to the teachers' manual which is
roughly four times the size of the
student workbook. "That's the flip
of normal. The manual gives teach
ers lots of background. It pulls
together many source materials and
has them right there for [the teach
ers]," he adds.
Blair also wanted to create a cur
riculum that is affordable for today's
high schools. The materials needed
for the projects he has designed are
generally those a school is likely to
have available. For instance, he sug
gests timing how long it takes a
damp paper towel to dry to approxi
mately measure relative humidity.
"Some of the schools have no bud
get for anything," Blair says. "This
[curriculum] assumes they have a
budget for Xeroxing and even that is
sometimes a problem."
To assist teachers with the lesson
plans, Blair has included overheads,
handouts and exams in his curricu
lum. The lessons are split into seven
sections beginning with a section
introducing the concept of biological
diversity and a project asking the
students to plan an expedition into
the rain forest. Later sections cover
causes of disturbance to ecosystems,
particularly human disturbance, and
the value of biodiversity.
Blair continues by explaining the
theory of island biogeography. This
area of ecology seeks to explain the
distribution of species from the
mainland to offshore islands. It pre
dicts that larger islands and islands
closer to the mainland will have
more potential for acquiring species
than smaller islands and those far
ther from the mainland.
"When you are thinking about
preserve design and preservation,
you have to think about island bio
geography," Blair explains. "Habitat
patches are becoming smaller and
smaller, so basically the world is a
series of habitat islands."
In the next section, Blair intro
duces the idea of "edge effect." Edge
effect refers to the observation that

an area constituting a particular
type of ecosystem, for example a
woodland, does not exhibit the true
characteristics of that ecosystem at
the edges.
The edge can be where the wood
land meets grassland, for instance.
At a distance away from the edge,
termed 'internal habitat', the wood
will contain those species usually
associated with woodland. This con
cept is important in designing a pre
serve because it explains why there
is more internal habitat within a
round area than there is within a
long skinny area.
The sixth section deals with caus
es of species extinction and includes
a number of case studies of extinct
and endangered species, including
both plants and animals.
The final project of the course
requires students to design a pre
serve for a specific endangered
species using the knowledge they
have gained from the previous six
sections.
The curriculum is designed to be
very practical and "hands-on," Blair
said. Each section has a project for
the students to complete. These pro
jects include flipping beans onto
paper "islands" to demonstrate
island biogeography and measuring
environmental differences across an
edge in the school yard — for exam
ple, where the playing field meets
asphalt — to uncover the causes of
edge effect.
"Instead of teaching facts which
are always changing, we need to
teach kids how to think critically,"
Blair said. "They need to learn how
to investigate and figure out
answers for themselves."
Blair wanted to make his curricu
lum fun for students, so he designed
projects that would demonstrate the
ideas that the teacher was explain
ing. At the same time, the design
allows the students to participate
actively in the learning. The curricu
lum strives to balance important
points with fun activities.

Overall, Blair hopes that students
will take two main ideas away from
this course: "First, habitats are
chopped up now and humans modify
habitat, and second, that humans
can do very specific things to prevent
loss of biodiversity."
Several area biology teachers,
including teacherB at Palo Alto and
Gunn High Schools were involved in
field testing of the new curriculum.
Blair went to several classes to
observe and trouble-shoot. "I got to
watch them teach it so I could pick
up where things made sense and
where they didn't," Blair said.
In fall of 1993 the curriculum was
published in its current form and
introduced at the conference of the
California Science Teachers Associa
tion. Blair ran workshops explaining
the new curriculum to interested
teachers. Since that time, word of
the new curriculum has spread by
word of mouth and Blair has now
distributed about 400 copies of
"Conservation Biology — A Curricu
lum for High School Students"
throughout California.
Blair is now in the process of find
ing a publisher for the curriculum,
which is currently published
through the Center for Conservation
Biology. Once it is accepted by a pub
lisher, he expects his curriculum —
the only existing conservation biolo
gy curriculum for high school stu
dents — to go into national distribu
tion.
Although reports from field tests
have been very positive, and a num
ber of teachers have lobbied for
implementation of the curriculum at
their schools, perhaps the best indi
cator for the success of this curricu
lum comes from one of the students
involved in the field studies.
When the class was asked what
might be done to improve the
lessons, Blair said, one student
replied: "You know, I don't usually
get biology, but I understand this
stuff. So maybe you should make it
harder."

insert new subjects that will be
important in the future.
However, researchers are now
working toward new curricula for
American students, to direct them in
learning new ideas and concepts that
were previously taught only at the
college level or not taught at all. One
of these educators is Dr. Robert
Blair, a postdoctoral fellow at Stan
ford's Center for Conservation Biol
ogy-
With the help of several local
teachers and Heidi Ballard, a Stan
ford graduate who has since become
a teacher at Gunn High School in
Palo Alto, Blair has created a cur
riculum in conservation biology for
high school students designed to fill
about three weeks of an introducto
ry biology class.
Blair defines conservation biology
as the science of biodiversity. "Con
servation biology was formed as a
discipline in 1986. So it's pretty
new," Blair said. "There are lots of
good curricula [for conservation
biology], but none at the high school
level."
Issues of conservation biology
have become newsworthy in recent
years due to situations such as the
destruction of the Amazon rain for
est and the conflict between loggers
and the northern spotted owl. Out of
this publicity grew a demand by
teachers for educational materials
on the subject. "A lot of teachers
were interested in being environ
mentally aware, but then they want
ed to go a step further to the science
behind it," Blair explained.
There was also the issue of where
this new curriculum would fit into a
high school curriculum already
strained by numerous state require
ments. "We decided that it would
probably fit into biology," Blair said,
"and because there are so many

requirements to meet during a year,
we had to make it a replacement for
the ecology unit. It is kind of an
applied ecology."
First, Blair wanted to create
materials that would give teachers a
solid background in conservation
biology. "Unlike most curricula, this
is really heavy on teacher and really
skinny on kid," Blair says, referring
to the teachers' manual which is
roughly four times the size of the
student workbook. "That's the flip
of normal. The manual gives teach
ers lots of background. It pulls
together many source materials and
has them right there for [the teach
ers]," he adds.
Blair also wanted to create a cur
riculum that is affordable for today's
high schools. The materials needed
for the projects he has designed are
generally those a school is likely to
have available. For instance, he sug
gests timing how long it takes a
damp paper towel to dry to approxi
mately measure relative humidity.
"Some of the schools have no bud
get for anything," Blair says. "This
[curriculum] assumes they have a
budget for Xeroxing and even that is
sometimes a problem."
To assist teachers with the lesson
plans, Blair has included overheads,
handouts and exams in his curricu
lum. The lessons are split into seven
sections beginning with a section
introducing the concept of biological
diversity and a project asking the
students to plan an expedition into
the rain forest. Later sections cover
causes of disturbance to ecosystems,
particularly human disturbance, and
the value of biodiversity.
Blair continues by explaining the
theory of island biogeography. This
area of ecology seeks to explain the
distribution of species from the
mainland to offshore islands. It pre
dicts that larger islands and islands
closer to the mainland will have
more potential for acquiring species
than smaller islands and those far
ther from the mainland.
"When you are thinking about
preserve design and preservation,
you have to think about island bio
geography," Blair explains. "Habitat
patches are becoming smaller and
smaller, so basically the world is a
series of habitat islands."
In the next section, Blair intro
duces the idea of "edge effect." Edge
effect refers to the observation that

an area constituting a particular
type of ecosystem, for example a
woodland, does not exhibit the true
characteristics of that ecosystem at
the edges.
The edge can be where the wood
land meets grassland, for instance.
At a distance away from the edge,
termed 'internal habitat', the wood
will contain those species usually
associated with woodland. This con
cept is important in designing a pre
serve because it explains why there
is more internal habitat within a
round area than there is within a
long skinny area.
The sixth section deals with caus
es of species extinction and includes
a number of case studies of extinct
and endangered species, including
both plants and animals.
The final project of the course
requires students to design a pre
serve for a specific endangered
species using the knowledge they
have gained from the previous six
sections.
The curriculum is designed to be
very practical and "hands-on," Blair
said. Each section has a project for
the students to complete. These pro
jects include flipping beans onto
paper "islands" to demonstrate
island biogeography and measuring
environmental differences across an
edge in the school yard — for exam
ple, where the playing field meets
asphalt — to uncover the causes of
edge effect.
"Instead of teaching facts which
are always changing, we need to
teach kids how to think critically,"
Blair said. "They need to learn how
to investigate and figure out
answers for themselves."
Blair wanted to make his curricu
lum fun for students, so he designed
projects that would demonstrate the
ideas that the teacher was explain
ing. At the same time, the design
allows the students to participate
actively in the learning. The curricu
lum strives to balance important
points with fun activities.

Overall, Blair hopes that students
will take two main ideas away from
this course: "First, habitats are
chopped up now and humans modify
habitat, and second, that humans
can do very specific things to prevent
loss of biodiversity."
Several area biology teachers,
including teacherB at Palo Alto and
Gunn High Schools were involved in
field testing of the new curriculum.
Blair went to several classes to
observe and trouble-shoot. "I got to
watch them teach it so I could pick
up where things made sense and
where they didn't," Blair said.
In fall of 1993 the curriculum was
published in its current form and
introduced at the conference of the
California Science Teachers Associa
tion. Blair ran workshops explaining
the new curriculum to interested
teachers. Since that time, word of
the new curriculum has spread by
word of mouth and Blair has now
distributed about 400 copies of
"Conservation Biology — A Curricu
lum for High School Students"
throughout California.
Blair is now in the process of find
ing a publisher for the curriculum,
which is currently published
through the Center for Conservation
Biology. Once it is accepted by a pub
lisher, he expects his curriculum —
the only existing conservation biolo
gy curriculum for high school stu
dents — to go into national distribu
tion.
Although reports from field tests
have been very positive, and a num
ber of teachers have lobbied for
implementation of the curriculum at
their schools, perhaps the best indi
cator for the success of this curricu
lum comes from one of the students
involved in the field studies.
When the class was asked what
might be done to improve the
lessons, Blair said, one student
replied: "You know, I don't usually
get biology, but I understand this
stuff. So maybe you should make it
harder."

We live in a world that is con
stantly changing. Today, technology
is expanding while our wilderness is
shrinking. This change forces us to
view the future from different per
spectives, requiring new ways of
thinking and learning.
Much of the curriculum we use to
teach children has become ingrained
in our schools, with little room left
between the economic crisis our
schools now face and the academic
problems of American education to
insert new subjects that will be
