# Stanford scientists propose the existence of multiple universes enclosed in 'Super-Universe'
## The
						Earth may be the center of a special universe

It is often remarked that the
world is simply an insignificant dot
in a near infinite universe.
It was first believed that the
Earth was indeed the center of the
universe. But the Copernican Revo
lution several centuries ago decen
tralized the Earth by placing it in
orbit around the sun. Eventually, it
was even found that the sun was
not stationary, but zoomed around
the Milky Way at tremendous
speeds.
In fact, the sun was found to be
rather puny in comparison with
other stars, making the Earth even
less special. However, a team of cos
mologists — Andrei Linde and
Arthur Mezhlumian, both of Stan
ford, and Dmitri Linde of the Cali
fornia Institute of Technology —
has recently proposed that the

Earth may in fact be in the center of
a special universe of space.
Numerous theories have been
advanced by scientists to explain
the origin and current state of the
universe. The most commonly held
view is the so-called Big Bang Theo
ry, that the universe expanded to its
present dimensions from a "cosmic
e £>g" — a ll atom-sized singularity —
within the first few microseconds of
its existence.
Another theory is that the uni
verse has always existed in its pre
sent form. This theory contends
that the universe we perceive is only
one in an infinite array of universes
that come forth out of an extremely
dense interstellar medium.
The universe is still expanding in
the sense that the density of matter
is decreasing. Proponents of this
theory hold that the universe will
slow down and actually begin to

contract, at what is called the "crit
ical density." The culmination of
this contraction will be the "Big
Crunch," an event with a name that
needs no explanation.
The three California researchers
propose that our universe is just
one void in the larger cosmic medi
um, which contains other universes
or holes. The theory is that these
voids or holes are not all alike.
Some holes are larger or less dense
than others. Our universe has its
own density and properties.
So there is in a sense, a "Super-
Universe," containing our universe
and others like it. Andrei Linde,
Dmitri Linde and Mezhlumian have
found the probability of being in a
particular part of the "Super-Uni
verse" given a certain density of our
universe.
The researchers claim that most
of the matter of a given density is

located at the center of an expand
ing "bubble." However, the edge of
the bubble may also contain some
matter, which, though not as mas
sive, is more dense. Bubbles of
higher density contain even more
matter.
There are, therefore, an infinite
number of density bubbles of
expanding space and matter. Each
could be considered a universe in
itself. This translates into the pos
sibility that we may be living in the
center of one of these universes.
Corroborating the team's theory
are recent astronomical discoveries
by the Hubble Space Telescope
which suggest that the universe
may not have the critical density of
matter. Thus the reason that the
universe is not shrinking is that
more dense matter may be located
just outside the universe which the
Hubble presently allows us to see.
