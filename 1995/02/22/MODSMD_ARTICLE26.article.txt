## Zone stops Stanford 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Heading into last night's
men's basketball game at
Maples Pavilion, you would
think that you could have
counted on seeing two things —
the Stanford Tree harassing
anything in a bear costume and
the Bruins playing lackluster
defense.
If that were the case, then
the 7,500 fans were disappoint
ed on both counts. Not only did
the Tree and the Lady Bruin
exchange a goodwill hug during
a time-out in the second half,
but UCLA shut down one of the
most efficient offenses in the
Pacific 10 Conference en route
to a 88-77 victory over the Car
dinal.
After holding Stanford to
45.7 percent shooting from the
field in the first half, the Bruins
clamped down in the second,
virtually shutting off all of the
Cardinal's offensive threats.
Dismal 34.3 percent shooting
kept Stanford from fighting
back after falling behind for
good at the 11 minute, 36 sec
ond mark.
"This UCLA team plays pret
ty good defense," said senior
forward Andy Poppink. "They
play hard the whole way
through, which is something
new for a UCLA team."
Switching into a two-three
matchup zone around the seven
minute mark of the second half,
the Bruins built on a lead that
up until that point had been
unable to grow past four. Three
quick turnovers by Stanford
then seemed to drain the Cardi
nal of its usual tough spirit.
"We went into a zone and
then made five, six or seven
stops," UCLA head coach Jim
Harrick said. "I thought it para
lyzed them."

According to Harrick, the
Bruins changed to a zone
defense because they were hav
ing trouble fighting through
numerous screens which had
helped the Cardinal's Dion
Cross and Poppink combine for
31 first half points.
"They got into a zone and
then we kind of fell flat," Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery
said. "We just didn't get any
thing to go down."
The Cardinal backcourt, usu
ally the strength of the team in
second halves of games, fell
short last night as Cross, Brevin
Knight and David Harbour com
bined for 9-for-37 shooting,
including 3-for-20 in the second
half. As a whole, the team shot
40 percent for the game.
At halftime, both teams
appeared to be firmly in their
offensive rhythms. Stanford,
while shooting under 50 percent
the first half, made up for it
with eight offensive rebounds
and 4-of-6 three point shooting.
The Bruins, on the other hand,
found the bottom of the net at
an astounding 63.7 percent clip.
Seeing its 47-44 halftime
lead dissolve four minutes into
the second half, Stanford stayed
close until UCLA center George
Zidek picked up his fourth per
sonal foul seven minutes into
the half.
Rather than panic at the loss
of his big man, Harrick went
with his most athletic lineup,
shifting 6-foot-9 guard J.R.
Henderson to center and filling
out the rest of the floor with Ed
and Charles O'Bannon, Toby
Bailey and Tyus Edney. This
group of long-armed jumping
jacks shut down Stanford's
methodical offense, as the Car
dinal perimeter players were
unable to break the zone. UCLA
held Stanford to only 11 points
over the last 7:20 of the game.
