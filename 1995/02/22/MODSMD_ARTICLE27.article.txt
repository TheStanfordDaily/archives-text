# Catching Sixth-Mania
## Rowdy fans part of the game 
### 
In order to perform an infor
mative service to those stu
dents who were either too
uninformed or too cheap to fork
over a twenty spot for member
ship in the Sixth Man Club, I
ventured into Stanford men's
basketball's designated rooting
section during last night's loss to
UCLA. The results of my foray
form the subject of this column.
First, a note of clarification
on what constitutes a Sixth
Man. As Sixth Man Ricky Beck
er explained, "There are two lev
els of Sixth Manness. There are

the Sixth Men who get to the
game a half-hour early and sit in
the back of the section. And then
there are those who come direct
ly from Halftime [the local
sports bar that sponsors the

Club] and stand up front.
They're the diehards. They're
the ones the cameras go after."
And a Sixth Man who wished
to remain nameless added: "And
then there are the chicks who go
there to be social."
This column will refer mainly
to "the diehards." They stand
near the halfcourt line, which is
the focal point of the club. They
wear sturdy hiking boots so that
when they jump up and down to
rattle their opponents, their
toes are not smashed by fellow
