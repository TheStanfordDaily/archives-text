# Catching Sixth-Mania
## Rowdy fans part of the game 
### 
In order to perform an infor
mative service to those stu
dents who were either too
uninformed or too cheap to fork
over a twenty spot for member
ship in the Sixth Man Club, I
ventured into Stanford men's
basketball's designated rooting
section during last night's loss to
UCLA. The results of my foray
form the subject of this column.
First, a note of clarification
on what constitutes a Sixth
Man. As Sixth Man Ricky Beck
er explained, "There are two lev
els of Sixth Manness. There are

the Sixth Men who get to the
game a half-hour early and sit in
the back of the section. And then
there are those who come direct
ly from Halftime [the local
sports bar that sponsors the

Club] and stand up front.
They're the diehards. They're
the ones the cameras go after."
And a Sixth Man who wished
to remain nameless added: "And
then there are the chicks who go
there to be social."
This column will refer mainly
to "the diehards." They stand
near the halfcourt line, which is
the focal point of the club. They
wear sturdy hiking boots so that
when they jump up and down to
rattle their opponents, their
toes are not smashed by fellow

Sixth Men. They are mostly fra
ternity members, athletes and
wannabe athletes, who as Sixth
Man Rob Baerger stated, view
the Club as "the focus of their
social lives." They are the some
times inebriated vagabonds and
incessant hecklers.
Heckling and trash-talking are
at the core of what it means to be
a Sixth Man. The best time to
taunt an opposing player is when
he is on the foul line, or standing
nearby the Club. Past verbal
attacks on hated players include
sallies such as "stupid," "Ein
stein," "SAT," "CBA," "NIT"
(used primarily against this
year's Cal team), "jailbird," "con
vict," "foster child" and
"Chevron." The last taunt is a
reference to one of the Club's
insults of choice.
"The rallying cry of the Sixth
Man is, 'You're gonna be pump
ing my gas someday,'" explained
Sixth Man Dan Lynch, who
added that another favorite

insult is, "'You're dad's my milk
man."
Of course, the referees always
provide fair game for the unfor
giving Sixth Men (favorite insults
are always prefaced by "hey,
ref!" and include "hike your
pants up a little higher," "show
us your [opposing team]'s shirt,"
and simply "you're brutal"), but
the important point is that the
Club gets results. As Baerger
said, "When your sixth man per
forms well, your team performs
well"; the inventor of the Club,
marketing expert Earl Koberlein,
added, "You can see the players
feed off it. It's like having an
energy 1.V."
But don't take their word for
it. Ask the players, many of
whom remember the days when
Maples Pavilion might have been
another name for a graveyard or
the Kingdome prior to the Ken
Griffey, Jr. era.
"7,500 isn't really that big for
a Pac-10 arena, but if we get it
packed, especially as crazy as the
Sixth Man Club is, it helps us,"
said Cardinal forward Darren
Allaway.
And the Club hurts opposing
players, like Bruin Ed O'Bannon,

who called Maples "loud, real
small, and intimidating," and
teammate George Zidek, who
said, "The home crowd should
always be a sixth man, and they
definitely have a strong sixth
man here at Stanford."
Sixth Men know that opposing
players are often distracted by
the Club. Some members can
remember a San Jose State play
er who once stood in front of the
Club and inbounded the ball with
his right hand while positioning
his left hand behind his back in a
gesture to the Club that was not
intended to signify that his team
was No. 1.
What many people don't real
ize is how much the Club helps
coach Mike Montgomery with
recruiting. Though Stanford will
never be able to boast an entire
arena full of sixth men, like Duke
can, Allaway stressed that,
"Recruits see the Sixth Men on
Sportschannel and ESPN. It
seems like the TV companies are
falling in love with them."
Cardinal assistant coach Keith
Larsen agreed: "When we show
recruits how much the student
involvement is, that definitely
helps. Guys will pay a little extra

to be a part of [the Club], and
that means a lot."
You'd think that besides oppo
nents, the only people whose ire
could be drawn by the Club are
the red-jacketed "Events Ser
vice" people and shut-out stu
dents. Though the Club has been
known to storm the court after
victories and thus jeopardize the
well-being of the springs under
the expensive Maples floor, mem
bers seem to have won over the
heart of one event coordinator
"They're good boys. They listen,"
said Events manager Cheill Pell.
And as for the non-members
who might not get their desired
seats due to the often perfect
attendance of the Club, Sixth
Men generally do not lose sleep
over that fact.
"The problem with this school
is that these are the 200 people
with school spirit," Sixth Man
Brendan Sullivan said during the
game. "The other 5,800 are
studying calculus right now."
