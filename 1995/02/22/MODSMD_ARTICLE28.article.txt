Freshman swimmer Sabir Muhammad
wasted little time etching his name into the
record books this weekend. The Atlanta
native crushed the pool mark at the Seiker
Aquatics Complex in Berkeley in the 100-
yard butterfly by speeding to a time of 47.67
seconds. Muhammad's showing erased the
former standard set by Stanford alumnus
and Olympic gold medalist Pablo Morales,
who notched a time of 48.52 in the same
pool. Muhammad also knocked off another
great Cardinal swimmer, senior Brian Ret
terer. The defending champion in the 50-
yard freestyle fell to Muhammad, who
blazed to a time of 20.16 seconds.

Don't be fooled by senior co-captain Amy
Chiminello's position as the No. 6 singles
player on the women's tennis squad.
Chiminello, who hails from Melrose, Mass.,
redshirted last season after undergoing
surgery on both feet, but is back this year as
"the heart and soul of our team," according
to head coach Frank Brennan. With her vic
tories in this weekend's matches at the Ari
zona schools, she upped her career record to
53-4 and became the only Stanford player
undefeated in both singles and doubles
matches on the season. She endured a stiff
challenge from Arizona's Betsy Miringhoff
before winning 7-6, 7-5, and dismantled Ari
zona State's Julie Coppinger 6-0, 6-2.
Chiminello and partner Julie Scott are 7-0 at
the No. 2 doubles slot.
