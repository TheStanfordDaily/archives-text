# Red-hot Bruins outlast Cardinal

UCLA 88
Stanford 77

That loud groan you heard at
about five past 10 last night came,
from the collective souls of Cardi
nal men's basketball fans every
where. Last night was supposed
to be their night.
Stanford, ranked 19th, had
just had a week off to rest and
recuperate after pummeling Cal.
UCLA just finished a grueling
two-game home stand vs. Arizona
State and Arizona, hopefully a lit
tle tired and worse for wear com
ing into Maples Pavilion.
What's more, after number
one Kansas' loss to Oklahoma the
previous night, second-ranked
UCLA, for all intents and purpos
es, was the new king of the moun
tain. And we all know what hap
pens to number one, right?
Well, maybe not, at least not
last night. Despite everything,
the Cardinal (16-6 overall, 7-6 in
the Pacific 10 Conference) still
was unable to get over that hump
against a top-ranked team and
fell 88-77 to UCLA (19-2 overall,
12-2 Pac-10).
"This one was disappointing,"
said Stanford senior forward
Andy Poppink, "maybe a little
more than the others because
with UCLA's tough schedule this
past week, and because we played
well last Wednesday, we really
thought this was a big opportuni
ty for us.
"I honestly had every confi
dence that we were going to take

this one. I don't know where or
why we slipped up exactly, but
this was one we felt we were going
to get," he said.
That's the way it started, too.
The Cardinal wasn't waiting for
anything to come to them. Best
team in the nation or not, there
was no backing down. Stanford
was going to take it to the Bruins.
On the first play of the game,
Poppink did just that as he drove
hard to the hole and drew the
foul. The ensuing foul shots
which he made were just the
beginning of the best half this
season for him. The 6-foot-7-inch
forward finished the first half
with 17 points and four assists.
His dish to sophomore guard
Brevin Knight for the three
pointer gave Stanford an early
15-9 lead.
UCLA, however, battled back
to take its largest first-half lead of
23-19 when Bruin forward J.R.
Henderson sunk two free throws.
The lead was short lived, though,
with Stanford — sparked by a
trey from Poppink — going on a
14-2 run. Actually, it was more of
a Dion Cross run with the Cardi
nal guard logging 11 of those 14
points.
Cross scored 11 straight
points, a layin here, some free
throws there, a 23-foot three
pointer here, a pull-up jumper
there, and the next thing you
knew, Stanford led by eight, 33-
25.
While seemingly the Cardinal
could do no wrong as Knight
wowed the crowd with behind the
back passes and Poppink
slammed down put-backs, the
Bruins still clawed and scraped to
keep the game close.
With Henderson's swooping,
driving layup to tie the score
with just under three minutes
to go in the first half, Stanford
was able to rally to take an
apparent five-point lead into the
locker room after Cross drilled a
three-pointer with just six sec
onds remaining in the half. But
as was the case throughout the
first half, nothing was impossi
ble as Bruin guard Toby Bailey
hit a 19-foot jumper at the
buzzer.
The first half was not only
electrifying, but it featured just
about everything Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery had
wanted his team to do. UCLA
was kept off the offensive glass
with only four offensive boards.
The Cardinal was getting some
outstanding individual perfor
mances from Cross and Pop
pink. About the only eyesore for
Stanford was the 63 percent the
Bruins were shooting from the

field.
Nonetheless, with a three
point lead and playing in front
of a sold out, hometown crowd,
the Bruins' fall appeared immi
nent. Then something happened
which you hate to see when
you're playing basketball . . .
shots stopped going in.
It seemed as if every shot the
Cardinal took was a blank in the
second half. Cross was 0-for-4
from three-point range. Both
Knight and senior swingman
David Harbour shot just l-of-7
from the field. Poppink had just
six points in the second half.
"Our perimeter was 9-for-37,
and they're standing in a zone,"
Montgomery said. "That wasn't
something that we did a very
good job on, and it cost us in the
long run."
Chalk it up to two things —
the 2-3 match-up zone UCLA
ran with a smaller, quicker line
up and Ail-American candidate
Bruin forward Ed O'Bannon,
who was placed on Poppink.
"I thought the real key was
putting Ed on Poppink," said
Bruin head coach Jim Harrick.
"It gave us a little lift and really
got our juices flowing. And then

we went to the zone. Those guys
we had in were quick. They have
long arms, they're quick, they
cover a lot of ground. We had a
hand in every face. A hand on
every shot."
After a 46 percent field-goal
shooting performance in the
first half, the Cardinal went ice
cold, shooting just 34 percent in
the second half. At one crucial
stretch with just under 10 min
utes left in the game, Stanford
scraped up just four points in
over seven minutes of play.
"We got the zone, and we just
kind of fell flat," Montgomery
said. "We weren't moving the
ball like we needed to move it.
We just didn't get anything
down. It really caused us some
problems. There was no reason
that it should have caused us
problems, it's just the change
was such that we were making
one pass, we were not taking
good shots.
"It took us out of our rhythm
a little bit. For whatever reason,
we haven't played against much
zone, we haven't seen much
zone, we didn't work much
zone, we just didn't shoot it very
well."

The offensive drought left the
Cardinal reeling. O'Bannon's
strong layin with 2:37 to go
extended the UCLA lead to 75-
68.
"I want to point out one thing
to everybody," Harrick said.
"Twenty-two points, nine
rebounds, five assists, five
blocked shots, three steals by Ed
O'Bannon. He's our foundation,
and every night he's been fan
tastic for us. He's done it all
year long offensively, defensive
ly, rebounding. He's a warrior."
Knight, one of the Cardinal's
warriors, closed the gap to five
with a 12-foot leaner in the lane,
but Stanford could get no closer
with the Bruins digging in their
heels.
"We just got into a stretch
where we couldn't get it turned
around at a stage late in the
game," Montgomery said. "We
weren't able to control any
phase of the game at that point
in time. They're very physical,
and we just couldn't going."
The Bruins' two senior lead
ers, O'Bannon and guard Tyus
Edney, sealed the game, sinking
several clutch free throws ... as
well as the Cardinal's hopes.
