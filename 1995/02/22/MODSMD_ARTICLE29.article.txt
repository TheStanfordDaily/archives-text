# Red-hot Bruins outlast Cardinal

UCLA 88
Stanford 77

That loud groan you heard at
about five past 10 last night came,
from the collective souls of Cardi
nal men's basketball fans every
where. Last night was supposed
to be their night.
Stanford, ranked 19th, had
just had a week off to rest and
recuperate after pummeling Cal.
UCLA just finished a grueling
two-game home stand vs. Arizona
State and Arizona, hopefully a lit
tle tired and worse for wear com
ing into Maples Pavilion.
What's more, after number
one Kansas' loss to Oklahoma the
previous night, second-ranked
UCLA, for all intents and purpos
es, was the new king of the moun
tain. And we all know what hap
pens to number one, right?
Well, maybe not, at least not
last night. Despite everything,
the Cardinal (16-6 overall, 7-6 in
the Pacific 10 Conference) still
was unable to get over that hump
against a top-ranked team and
fell 88-77 to UCLA (19-2 overall,
12-2 Pac-10).
"This one was disappointing,"
said Stanford senior forward
Andy Poppink, "maybe a little
more than the others because
with UCLA's tough schedule this
past week, and because we played
well last Wednesday, we really
thought this was a big opportuni
ty for us.
"I honestly had every confi
dence that we were going to take

this one. I don't know where or
why we slipped up exactly, but
this was one we felt we were going
to get," he said.
That's the way it started, too.
The Cardinal wasn't waiting for
anything to come to them. Best
team in the nation or not, there
was no backing down. Stanford
was going to take it to the Bruins.
On the first play of the game,
Poppink did just that as he drove
hard to the hole and drew the
foul. The ensuing foul shots
which he made were just the
beginning of the best half this
season for him. The 6-foot-7-inch
forward finished the first half
with 17 points and four assists.
His dish to sophomore guard
Brevin Knight for the three
pointer gave Stanford an early
15-9 lead.
UCLA, however, battled back
to take its largest first-half lead of
23-19 when Bruin forward J.R.
Henderson sunk two free throws.
The lead was short lived, though,
with Stanford — sparked by a
trey from Poppink — going on a
14-2 run. Actually, it was more of
a Dion Cross run with the Cardi
nal guard logging 11 of those 14
points.
Cross scored 11 straight
points, a layin here, some free
throws there, a 23-foot three
pointer here, a pull-up jumper
there, and the next thing you
knew, Stanford led by eight, 33-
25.
While seemingly the Cardinal
could do no wrong as Knight
wowed the crowd with behind the
back passes and Poppink
slammed down put-backs, the
Bruins still clawed and scraped to
