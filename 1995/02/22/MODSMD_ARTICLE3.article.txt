# Athletes discuss tribulations of staying in peak condition

During the off season, senior Jimmy Aguirre weighs
152 pounds. But when it comes time to weigh in at the
start of the wrestling season, he will weigh 134 pounds,
a feat he accomplishes through dehydration and star
vation.
This was just one of many stories that five varsity
athletes had to tell last night at a panel discussion
called, "Pressure from All Sides: Athletes and Their
Bodies," one of many events scheduled for Body Image

Awareness Week, which runs through Saturday.
During the evening, the athletes described the ex
pectations which shape their eating habits and exercise
patterns.
"Weight is a constant issue in wrestling because you
have to make a certain weight class," Aguirre said.
"What I try to do is work out eveiy time I eat. I eat good,
low-calorie meals.
"Right before you weigh in you work out really hard
for two hours without drinking any water," he said, ex-
plaining that he usually only weighs
134 pounds for the five minutes
that he weighs in. After the weigh in
he quickly drinks and eats to regain
water weight.
"The most unhealthy part of the
sport is binge eating after you weigh
in," Aguirre said.
Weight concerns are not limited
to wrestling. In both gymnastics

and synchronized swimming,
female athletes are encouraged to
be as thin as possible. According to
sophomore Eunice Woods, the ideal
swimmer has long legs and a thin
body.
She said maintaining a good
body image is difficult when your
body is always exposed in a bathing
suit. The coaches also take an
active interest in the swimmers'
weights.
While gymnasts are traditional
ly required to weigh in, the coach
es do not instruct the athletes to

lose weight. Sophomore Ariel Pas
sanisi said that female gymnasts
reach their peak between the ages
of 14 and 18, and that the ideal
female gymnast is a pre-pubescent
teen.
"To get to be the stereotypical
perfect body image gymnast I would
have to starve myself and do aerobic
exercise for two hours a day," Pas
sanisi said. "I am not willing to do
that."
But not all athletic teams have
this focus on body shape, according
to some panel members, who noted

that the emphasis of sports like
cross country and crew is instead on
performance.
"It doesn't matter how much
body fat we have as long as we are
strong," said Anne Dubinsky, a
sophomore on the crew team. She
said that her coach does not push
the members of the crew team to
lose weight.
While cross country runners are
also ideally thin and lean, sopho
more Sara Foster said that Stan
ford's team is made up of athletes
with a variety of shapes and sizes.
