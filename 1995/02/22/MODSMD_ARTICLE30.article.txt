# No slumber for lumber vs. USF

Stanford 15
San Francisco 4

The 12th-ranked Stanford baseball team broke
out of its early season hitting slump yesterday after
noon — in a tremendous way.
After managing just five runs in a three game set
with Santa Clara last weekend, the Cardinal pound
ed out 17 hits en route to a 15-4 trouncing of the
University of San Francisco (3-6) in a non-confer
ence game at Benedetti Diamond.
Stanford (9-6) racked up six runs in the top of the
first inning and cruised from there, compiling sea
son-highs in both hits and runs. The Cardinal also
capitalized on seven walks and five USF errors to

score five unearned runs and pick up its ninth win of
the year.
"Before the game a lot of the guys on the team got
together and decided that we needed to start hit
ting," junior left-fielder Rich Crowe said. "We need
ed to prove that we could score and then carry that
over to the UCLA series this weekend."
Crowe led the Stanford offensive charge, driving
in four runs while going 2-for-4 on the afternoon.
Second baseman Brian Dallimore, center-fielder
Cale Carter and third baseman Steve Carver each
added three hits a piece in a game the Cardinal dom
inated from start to finish.
Stanford wasted no time getting things started in
its half of the first.
Dallimore opened the game with a leadoff single
and advanced to third on freshman Joe Kilburg's
single to right field. Head coach Mark Marquess
then gambled early, calling for a double steal that
was executed to perfection. Kilburg beat the throw
to second while Dallimore scampered home with the
game's first run.
The Cardinal added another
run in the inning before loading
the bases for Crowe, who prompt
ly belted a bases-clearing double
to right-center to put Stanford up
5-0. When Crowe came around to
score on a ground out, the Cardi
nal had built a six run advantage
before sending a pitcher to the
hill.
"Anytime we can get an early
lead it always helps," Kilburg
said. "If we can get good run sup
port then I can't see us losing
much at all with the type of pitch
ing staff that we have."
With a large lead to work with,
Cardinal starter Mark Williams'
(1-0) task was simply to throw
strikes, and he had no problems
doing so. Williams pitched the

first two innings of a pre-set rota
tion, allowing two base hits while
walking none and striking out
three to pick up his first win of
the year.
Jeff Blakely (0-1), the Dons'
starter, didn't last through the
first inning, allowing six runs —
although only two were earned —
to get saddled with his first loss of
the year.
After USF rallied for two runs
in the bottom of the fifth on a two-
RBI double from catcher Larry
Pasero, the Cardinal responded
with another big inning to put the
game out of reach.
Stanford put four more runs
on the board in the top of the
sixth to take a commanding 11-2
lead. Carver, Carter and Crowe
each added RBI singles — two
coming with two outs — in that
inning and the Cardinal added
another run on a Troy Kent
ground out.

The Dons put another deuce
on the board in the bottom of the
seventh, but it wasn't nearly
enough on an afternoon when the
Cardinal bats were clicking.
"It's a really big boost for us to
be able to score some runs and
take some of the pressure off the
pitching staff," Crowe said.
"There's no doubt about the
importance of pitching with the
lead."
Jay Pecci, a walk-on freshman,
added a two-run two-out double
in the eighth and Dallimore
closed out the most productive
offensive game of the season with
an RBI single that made the score
15-4.
Four Stanford pitchers teamed
up to hold USF to just seven hits
in the Cardinal's final tune-up
before Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion (Six-Pac) play begins with a
three-game series at UCLA this
weekend.
