Stanford ,52
San Jose St. 8 5

Playing like the youthful squad
that it is, the Stanford softball team
continued the up-and-down play
that has characterized the 1995 sea
son, dropping both ends of a double
header against San Jose State. The

Spartans took the first game by a
score of 8-5 and won the nightcap 5-
2.
Coming off a 23-run perfor
mance over two games against San
Francisco State last Tuesday, the
Cardinal offense managed only four
hits in the weekend twinbill. The
Spartans, on the other hand,
pounded out 15 hits against fresh
man hurler Jessica Schulman (2-3)
in the opening game alone. In the
second contest, sophomore Angela
Webb (1-3) gave up seven hits,
including four doubles and a home
run.
Stanford (4-6) fell behind early
in the first game, as the Spartans
scored single runs in the first and
third innings to take a 2-0 lead.
Stanford fought back, though,
erupting with all five of its runs in
the bottom of the fifth inning.
Staked to a 5-2 lead, Stanford
could not hold on, as Schulman
and the Cardinal defense gave up
three runs in the top of the sev
enth to force extra innings. San
Jose State scored three more times
in the top of the eighth to put the
game away.
"We just couldn't get anything
going except for the fifth inning,"
assistant coach Andy Pearce said.
"We really struggled with the bat,
and we didn't play good defense
either."
The poor Cardinal defense
included an astonishing six errors.
As a consequence, only three of the
eight runs charged to Schulman

were earned. Good defense is essen
tial to Stanford's success, especially
when the Cardinal's opponent is
hitting well.
The Spartans controlled the sec
ond game throughout, scoring three
runs in the second and one in the
fourth to take a 4-0 lead. After
extending the lead to 5-0 in the top
of the seventh, Stanford mounted a
comeback, scoring two runs in the
bottom of the inning. During the
rally, freshman third baseman
Dawn Kobata broke up Spartan
pitcher Lindsey Jarrel's no-hit bid
with a hit that drove in sophomore
shortstop Summer Lee. Kobata
later scored Stanford's second run,
but the rally and the game ended
without further last-minute hero
ics. For the game, Stanford was held
to just one hit.
Jarrel (1-2) got the win for the
Spartans, while Stanford was left to
contemplate an anemic offensive
attack and a defense that allowed
another unearned run.
"We have a lot of work to do
before [today's game]," Pearce said.
Today, Stanford takes on UC-Davis
at 1:30 p.m. in a home game at El
Camino Park.
