# Sailors take second and first in Berkeley

The President's Day holiday
brought no rest to the Stanford sail
ing team, which sailed across the
bay to Berkeley for two days of rac
ing, the North 3 District Regatta
and North District Team Elimina
tions. The team placed second in
Saturday's fleet racing and
improved on this the next day by
capturing first.
Stanford used a full squad of 12
skippers and 12 crews in Saturday's
fleet racing. The team was split
evenly with sue boats in both the A
and B divisions. In total, eight
schools from northern California
entered boats in the race, making
for a packed course.
Stanford put in a true team
effort in the A division by capturing
second through sixth place, as well
as ninth. Finishing as the top Cardi
nal team, senior skipper Charles

Meade and freshman crew Betsy
Carmichael sailed to a strong sec
ond place finish in the A division.
Adding depth to Stanford's showing
in the A division was the third place
team of junior Cinnamon
Hampikian and freshman Susan
Bradford. Highlighting Stanford's
results in the B division, the fresh
man combination of Danny Zimbal
di and Heather Rogers earned sec
ond place.
Despite the strong individual
results, Stanford couldn't outscore
California in team competition. The
only weakness in the unit's perfor
mance was in the area of starting,
which was made more difficult than
usual by a short starting line and a
crowded field of boats.
Although surprising, the second
place finish to lower-ranked Cal
didn't discourage Bourdow. He
expects the result to motivate his
team. "This is going to make the top
teams work a little harder," Bour
dow said.
The team closed the weekend on
a positive note with Sunday's first
place showing. The North Team
Racing Eliminations provided a
change from Saturday's fleet rac
ing. In team racing, only two
schools compete against each other
per race. Compared to fleet racing,
where more than 20 boats can be on
the water, each team uses only
three boats. Team racing is much
more team focused and tactical.
Maneuvering to victory, the
teams of Meade and Carmichael,
Zimbaldi and Rogers and the rota
tion of skippers Adam Lowry, a
junior, and freshman John Meade
with junior crew Ki Mun swept the
competition with a 4-0 record.
