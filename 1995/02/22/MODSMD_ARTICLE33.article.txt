## Track 4th at MPSFs 
### Seth Goldstein Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's and
men's track teams geared up for
the beginning of their outdoor
season with fourth place finish
es at the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Indoor
Championships on Saturday in
Reno, Nev.
While the Indoor title eluded
the Cardinal, the team was defi
nitely satisfied with the outing,
which marked the first time this
year that Stanford has fielded
an entire team covering all
events.
"We don't do much indoor
track. Back East, schools will
run in eight or nine meets, but
here we do one or two," said
head coach Vin Lananna. "Con
sidering that for the majority of
our athletes, this was their first
and only meet indoors, I'm very
pleased."
Arizona took first in the
men's competition with 101
points, placing 15 points ahead
of the second place finisher,
Utah State. UCLA finished in
third with 69.5 while Stanford
and California tied for fourth
with 68.
The Wildcats also captured
the women's title with 107
points. Arizona State captured
second with 92.5, Washington
took third with 70 and the Car
dinal's 56.5 points were good for
fourth.
"Last year, we blew Arizona
away," said junior middle-dis
tance runner Joe Karlgaard. "I
think that angered them. This
year they came much better pre
pared and brought more ath
letes."
"Overall, it was a good team
performance," he continued. "In
particular, we had really out
standing runs from our milers."
Stanford runners sophomore
J.J. White, freshman Jon Wel
don and senior Erik Spayde
placed third, fourth and fifth,
respectively, in the men's mile.
Sophomore Monal Chokshi took
sixth in the women's run.
White's time of 4 minutes, 8.81
seconds was particularly
impressive.
"If you convert it to a normal

altitude time [times in Reno
must be adjusted to compensate
for the lower levels of oxygen
present], it's about a four sec
ond personal record for me, so
I'm really happy with it,"he
said. "I think it's a good indica
tor of how my training's been
going this year."
The Cardinal throwing con
tingent turned in another
strong performance. Senior co
captain David Popejoy took sec
ond in the 35-pound weight with
a distance of 66-1 1/2. In addi
tion, sophomore Pete Swanson
placed fourth with 63-11 1/4 and
senior Toby Norwood finished
seventh with 60-5 1/4. In addi
tion, Swanson nabbed sixth in
the shot put.
"All three of our throwers did
an excellent job," Lananna said.
On the women's side, junior
Dena Dey and senior Flo Adu
turned in the most noteworthy
performances. Dey finished sec
ond to only ASU's Lorriann
Adams in the 800 meter with a
time of 2:10.4, while Adu cap
tured the triple jump title with a
leap of 40-5 1/2.
The relay teams did well, as
the men's distance medley
placed second, while the women
took third. The women's 4 by
400-meter team of Monica Hog
gart, Christy Boyd, Tyra Holt
and Heather Miller also put in a
good time for a third place fin
ish, according to Lananna.
"They did a great job," he
said. "They barely ran that fast
outdoors [where times are faster
due to less turns], so that's
something to be proud of."
Lananna will be taking a
select group of his athletes who
have qualified for national com
petition this weekend to Notre
Dame, site of the 1995 National
Indoor Championships. The rest
of the squad will be preparing
itself for its first duai outdoor
meet against Fresno State in
two weeks time.
The MPSF Championship
should provide a good base to
move forward from for both
groups, according to Lananna.
"It was a good indicator of
where we stand now and it
bodes well for the future," he
said.
