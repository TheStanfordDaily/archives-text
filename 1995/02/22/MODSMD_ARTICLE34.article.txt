Stanford 6 5
Arizona State 10 6

A depleted Stanford hockey team lost
two games 10-6 and 6-5 at Arizona State (8-
18) last weekend on the heels of its trip to
the national tournament starting March 1.
Stanford (9-6-2) was missing four of its top
nine forwards — including half of the top
two lines — who didn't make the trip to
Tempe, Ariz, for the weekend series.
Using a makeshift first line and trying to
use the third and fourth lines more to pre
pare the team for nationals, Stanford came
out flat in the first game of the series. "We
were not focused in the first two periods,"
said Coach Ernie Ferrari. Arizona State
jumped out to a 6-1 lead during the first
two periods, when Stanford's top scorer,
senior center Luke Winter, occupied the
penalty box for 24 minutes.
After a team discussion between the sec
ond and third periods, the team came out
charged up for the third period in which it
scored five goals. Winter and senior wing
Stefan Teitge, Stanford's two offensive

leaders throughout the season, led the
squad in scoring during the third period
surge, but the surge fell short as the Sun
Devils scored four goals to win 10-6.
The team came out much more focused
in the second game. According to Ferrari,
the Cardinal realized that the fact that
Stanford was missing several players didn't
mean that they could not come out and play
well as a team. Stanford was leading 1-0
after the first period, but Arizona State
came back to take a 4-3 lead after the sec
ond period. Stanford scored two quick goals
to once again jump ahead, but Arizona
State scored again half way through the
period to tie the contest. Finally, with six
seconds left, Arizona State scored a go
ahead goal to seal the victory.
"We were very upset after the loss," Fer
rari said. "I was disappointed that we didn't
get two wins, but I wasn't disappointed in
the team's play."
The makeshift first line scored all of
Stanford's goals in the series. The check
ing line gave up only four goals in the
series and only one in the second game.
Ferrari said that the team turned the puck
over in critical spots during the games,
allowing the Sun Devils' top players to
have good opportunities to score. Howev
er, he thinks that Stanford will not do that

at nationals once the entire team comes
together.
Going into the game, Stanford wanted to
concentrate on preparing the third and
fourth lines defensively for nationals. How
ever, much of those lines did not make the
trip, so Ferrari worked with them on an
individual basis.
"The key to our success will be play of
players such as Dave Richardson and Brian
Gaines on the third line," Ferrari said. He
said that the players came out of the game
with established roles to focus on as nation
als approach.
Stanford will play California in a home
and-home series this weekend to conclude
the regular season. "We are looking forward
to playing good, hard hockey against Cal,"
said Ferrari. "What you see against Cal is
what we'll do in nationals. We'll review
everything to make sure we're ready for the
final exam at nationals."
Cal has played well since losing to Stan
ford three weekends ago in the playoff game
for nationals. They also traveled to Tempe
and split a series two weekends ago, and,
last week, they won two games against San
Jose State.
The Cal series will be the beginning of a
