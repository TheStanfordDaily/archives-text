Sometimes second best is
good enough.
The Stanford women's
lacrosse squad found this out
over the long weekend as they
finished runner-up to a North
ern California club team in the
seventh annual Santa Barbara
Shootout. While the Cardinal
couldn't knock off the heavily
favored club team, they did
win the award for the top col
lege squad at the tournament.
"The Northern California
club team was untouchable,"
said junior defensive player
Hannah Flatau. "They were
way out of our league. We
knew the tournament was over
for us as soon as we had made
it into the finals against
them."
The shootout teams were

divided into three groups;
Stanford was seeded second in
the most competetive division.
In addition, each divison was
divided into two pools for play
on Saturday. The other con
tenders for the title included
the top-seeded Nor-Cal club
team, the third seed, UC-
Davis, and the fourth seed,
Colorado.
Saturday's round-robin
play saw Stanford down Bates
College 6-5 and then beat the
Santa Barbara Current, anoth
er club team, 9-5 immediately
following the first match. The
continuous play eventually
took its toll on the Cardinal
later in the afternoon, as Col
orado defeated Stanford, 8-5.
"It was tough mentally to
stay in all the games," said
Flatau. "But I think we did a
good job of it. We kept the intensity
up the whole time."
Despite the loss to the Buffaloes,
Stanford's 2-1 record was good
enough to move the team into Sun
day's semifinal match against UC-
Davis, which had advanced from the
other pool. It was in this contest
that the Cardinal intensity burned
brightest, giving it an important vic
tory.
"[The team's intensity] showed
up most against Davis," Flatau said.

"We were down 4-3 at halftime, but
we came back to win 6-4.
"It was the first time we had
beaten them since I've been here,"
she continued. "Beating Davis was
the big win of the tournament."
The shootout's final game was
an anti-climactic 7-4 loss to the Nor-
Cal club team, which had beaten
Bates 9-2 earlier in the day. Howev
er, the team had accomplished what
it had expected to and had seen
improvements where it wanted to.
"Our passing was much better,"
Flatau said. "We're a lot more cohe
sive right now. We trust each other
to come through a lot more than we
did in the past."
