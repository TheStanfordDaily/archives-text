# Fencers host Olympics
## 
### Jason Weintraub Contributing writer 
While hosting an open tourna
ment in San Jose over the week
end, members of the Stanford
Fencing Club showed that the
University possesses one of the
premier clubs in the nation.
In a joint effort produced by
the Stanford and San Jose Fenc
ing Clubs, Stanford's "junior
Olympics" tournament involved
1,700 of the best fencers in the
country. The tournament includ
ed men's and women's divisions
in foil, epee and sabre, with indi
viduals 20 and under competing
in five separate age classes.
Although the purpose of the tour
nament, according to Stanford
Club Director and men's varsity
coach Zoran Tulum, is to "raise
funds for the varsity team," the
competition also provided a good
test for the club's top fencers.
"We accomplished all of our
fundraising goals [through host
ing this tournament] and we also
had some good results," Tulum
said. "It was a very well-orga

nized tournament that brought in
some top competition."
Stanford's Josh Stauffer pro
vided the Cardinal with it's best
result, finishing second in the 18
to 20 year-old class of men's foil.
Reaching the semifinals after a
series of single-elimination victo
ries, Stauffer faced off against
one of the top foilists from Notre
Dame, Stanford's nemesis last
weekend in a tournament hosted
by Duke. Down 8-3 early in the
match, Stauffer fought back,
eventually evening the bout at 14.
Stauffer then claimed the next
point to take the match 15-14.
"It was by far the most exciting
bout of the tournament," Tulum
said. "After several points, the
crowd gave standing ovations to
the players. It was one of the most
dramatic matches I've seen."
Stauffer continued the drama
in the finals bout against the top
fencer from Columbia. Trailing 7-
2, he climbed back into the match
by scoring 10 of the next 15 points
to tie the bout at 12. The fencers
traded points after that, until
Stauffer finally fell, 15-14.
Sasha Zucker also performed
well in the under-20 foil division.
Zucker advanced to the round of
32, where he met a highly regard
ed club fencer from the state of
New York. "The guy was clearly
better than him," Tulum said of
Zucker's opponent. "Sasha did
well to get that far in the tourna

ment.
The top candidate to win the
division, Stanford freshman
Sean McClain, did not compete
in the event. McClain is current
ly competing in Modling, Aus
tria in the Junior World Cup.
Tulum added that McClain has
qualified for the Junior World
Team and will compete at the
Junior World Fencing Champi
onships in April. This coming
weekend, McClain and Stan
ford's Nick Bravin will head to
La Corugna, Spain to fence in
the Senior World Cup.
