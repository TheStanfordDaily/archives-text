While hosting an open tourna
ment in San Jose over the week
end, members of the Stanford
Fencing Club showed that the
University possesses one of the
premier clubs in the nation.
In a joint effort produced by
the Stanford and San Jose Fenc
ing Clubs, Stanford's "junior
Olympics" tournament involved
1,700 of the best fencers in the
country. The tournament includ
ed men's and women's divisions
in foil, epee and sabre, with indi
viduals 20 and under competing
in five separate age classes.
Although the purpose of the tour
nament, according to Stanford
Club Director and men's varsity

series of single-elimination victo

one of the top foilists from Notre
Dame, Stanford's nemesis last
weekend in a tournament hosted
by Duke. Down 8-3 early in the
match, Stauffer fought back,
eventually evening the bout at 14.
Stauffer then claimed the next
point to take the match 15-14.
"It was by far the most exciting
bout of the tournament," Tulum
said. "After several points, the
crowd gave standing ovations to
the players. It was one of the most
dramatic matches I've seen."
Stauffer continued the drama
in the finals bout against the top
fencer from Columbia. Trailing 7-

by scoring 10 of the next 15 points
to tie the bout at 12. The fencers
