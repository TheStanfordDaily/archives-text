# Continuing education for technical pros
## New center gives job training to engineers 
### Jennifer Rosen Staff writer 
With technology progressing so
rapidly, even companies like Mi
crosoft and IBM are sending their
engineers back to school to keep up
with the constant developments in
the field.
In order to meet this demand for
continuing education, the School of
Engineering has recently created
the Stanford Center for Profession
al Development to provide such pro
grams for technical professionals in
industry and government.
The center, which opened Jan. 1,
offers non-credit courses, work
shops and conferences that utilize a
variety of cutting-edge instruction
al technologies. The organization
funds itself by charging participants
for taking classes.
Center Director Andy DiPaolo
saicl the center was established to
meet the demands of today's work
place, which require creative meth
ods for continuing education to be
aocessed and delivered in a timely
and focused manner.
The center will "strengthen the
relationship that the School of En

gineering and Stanford have with
industry relative to engineering ed
ucation," DiPaolo said.
Stanford students will benefit
from the development of new edu
cational products such as CD
ROMs, he said, while industry pro
fessionals will benefit from conve
nient access to Stanford's engineer
ing faculty and programs.
The center also encourages in
dustry and government organiza
tions to acquire high-quality engi
neering and technical management
education and training.
"Our faculty have strong inter
ests in interacting with industry,
and the continuing education pro
grams and products offered
through this new center will not
only help working engineers main
tain their technical vitality but Â£ilso
can be used to enhance the educa
tional experience for our on-campus
students," Engineering School
Dean James Gibbons said in a state
ment.
The Stanford Instructional Tele
vision Network, the core of the new
center, has extended Stanford grad
uate engineering courses to indus
try for more than 26 years via
broadcast and videotape. Available
throughout the Stanford communi
ty, it will continue to supply exist
ing programs as well as additional
resources that address the chang

ing needs of the market.
Last year, more than 5,000
professionals from a variety of
places ranging from Silicon Val
ley to Spain took classes from
SITN.
The organization will continue
to provide full graduate level engi
neering, computer science and tech
nical management courses by
broadcast television and videocas
sette.
