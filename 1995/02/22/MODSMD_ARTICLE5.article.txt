# ASSU Senate says yes to Stanford Fund proposal
## Donor plan passes overwhelmingly; details clarified 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night overwhelmingly sup
ported the recommendations of the Stanford Fund
task force.
While many senators had questions regarding the
diction of the alumni-giving policy, when the vote was
called no senator opposed the measure, and there were
only two abstentions.
The policy would give student groups the option of
either working for the Stanford Fund to make money
or soliciting funds under the auspices of the Office of
Development.
The policy will be enacted Sept. 1 pending formal
support by University President Gerhard Casper and
Provost Condoleezza Rice, both of whom have verbally
supported the bill.
Stanford Fund Director Nancy Wells and Nanci
Howe, director of Student Activities, were both on
hand at last night's meeting to further clarify nuances
of the bill. Wells provided more information on the so
licitation timeline and the 10-cents rule, and explained
the definition of a solicitation.
Wells and the task force were questioned heavily by
senate associate John Crandon, a law student, who
proposed hypothetical situations which drew definitive
interpretations of the policy.
Crandon said that at the outset, the plan seemed du
bious. "It sounds like it's harnessing some kind of
servitude," he said.
He expressed concern over the administrative juris
diction and the solicitation timeline, which requires

groups working under the Development Office to only
call alumni between Feb. 1 and July 1.
Wells said that the administration's guidance is
"just to ensure that the right hand knows what the left
hand is doing."
Senate deputy chair and task force member Michael
Choo responded to Crandon's concern about the con-
flict in schedules with the law
school's semester system, saying
the decision "wasn't based on the
academic timetable. It was based
on the Fund schedule."
Student organizations working
for the Stanford Fund will receive
$30 per hour per member, provid
ed they meet their commitments.
The actual hours, Wells said, will
not be distributed evenly through
out the year.
"There will probably be concen
trated times during the year that
there will be a lot of hours," she
said. "At other times of the year it
will be a little slower. Our intent is
to have an adequate supply of
available hours."
Task force members said that
the 10-cent fee that student groups
must pay for each mailing sent out
while working under the Develop
ment Office's guidance is in the

spirit of the new bond between the
administration and the students.
"That represents the spirit of
partnership," Wells said. "What we
felt was that it was appropriate for
groups to avail themselves of the
database.... We felt that 10 cents
a label [wasl sort of'symbolic.' "
Wells said that an unsuccessful
solicitation is "a solicitation that
does not result in a gift." The pro
posal states that alumni who
refuse to donate five times be
removed from an organization's
list.
Student members of the task
force — Council of Presidents
members Vanessa Alvarado and
Lisa Lee, Choo and undergraduate
senator Stephen Russell — praised
the partnership between the
administration and the students.
"This is not the policy the sen
ate would have written if they sat
down themselves. But it's close.
And this is not the policy the
administration would have written
if they had sat down themselves.
But it's close," Russell said.
