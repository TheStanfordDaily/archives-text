### Rachel Kolman Marshak Contributing writer 
Hoping to foster greater class unity, the ASSU
almost unanimously approved a bill to create class
presidents for the sophomore and junior classes,
as well as a freshmen council.
The positions — modeled on the senior class
presidents — will deal with a wide variety of issues,
ranging from semi-formals to workshops on how
to choose a major, said undergraduate senator
Nicole Vazquez, one of the bill's authors.
