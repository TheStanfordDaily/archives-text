# Sophomores, juniors gain class presidents
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Contributing writer 
Hoping to foster greater class unity, the ASSU
almost unanimously approved a bill to create class
presidents for the sophomore and junior classes,
as well as a freshmen council.
The positions — modeled on the senior class
presidents — will deal with a wide variety of issues,
ranging from semi-formals to workshops on how
to choose a major, said undergraduate senator
Nicole Vazquez, one of the bill's authors.
The presidents — four for each
class — will be chosen in the spring
election and the eight freshmen
council members will be picked by
an interview process.
Each president and every two
freshmen council members will
work on one of four different issues,
Vazquez said.
"One president will be the CEO.
This person will be the contact for
The Daily and University officials,"
she said. "The person will publish a
newsletter, which I envision to be a
quarterly."
The second president will be in

charge of ASSU issues and will be
an ex-officio member of the senate,
she said. "This person will deal with
(Director of Student Activities)
Nanci Howe and the Office of Stu
dent Activities and have direct
involvement with the senate."
The third president will work on
academic issues — such as advising
students on majors and establishing
better student-faculty relations —
while the fourth president will plan
social events, like semi-formals and
class convocations, Vazquez said.
Bill supporters cited a need for
class unity as the reason for increas
ing student government.
"The reason behind this bill is
that there's a need for class events
and things on the academic side of
things," said Mork Murdock, a

Council of Presidents member and
another bill author. "Class presi
dents fill that void."
"There's a lack of class unity,"
said bill author and undergraduate
senator Rupali Gandhi. "There's a
lot of frosh class unity. They come
out of the dorms and then there's
nothing."
Senate associate Alex
Scherbakovsky said, however, that
he thought that class presidents
would not foster unity.
"You're going about it the wrong
way. What we want to have is the
best Stanford experience,"
Scherbakovsky said. "This is not
going to be achieved by class presi
dents. There's no need to have class
presidents who will do nothing."
Undergraduate senator Steve

Russell also questioned the motives
behind the bill, arguing that having
class presidents was merely a way
for the Office of Development to
increase alumni donations.
"The bill passed because student
unity is a concern to the ASSU,"
Russell said. "It's also a concern to
the Stanford Alumni Association.
The Alumni Association stands to
make money off the bill. Class unity
is the number one way for the Uni
versity to raise money. The authors
could have been more honest about
their intentions."
Russell also noted that the impe
tus and the funding for the bill was
from the Office of Student Activities
and the Development Office.
"The funding for the organiza
tion and the text of the bill came out

of the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion," Russell said. "On a positive
note, it's nice to see the altruism. I
will look for the Office of Student
Activities and the Alumni Associa
tion to fund more useful projects."
Now that the bill has passed,
Murdock said, the main push will be
"getting people psyched about it"
and finding people to run as class
presidents.
The ASSU also approved a bill to
change the selection process of the
ASSU Speakers Bureau director,
giving the Speakers Bureau more
influence in the selection.
The director will now be selected
by a committee of the director and
assistant director of the Speakers
Bureau, the ASSU financial manag
er and a member of the ASSU Sen

ate.
"The previous system was
ridiculous," said Speakers Bureau
Director Scott Moss. "We only had
a one in five say. This partnership
is (now) split fifty-fifty between the
Speakers Bureau and the ASSU."
Moss said the new policy would
also remove politics from the selec
tion of the director. "This will
ensure that someone responsible
gets picked," he said. "Last year
someone with a political agenda
almost got picked, and we wanted to
make sure that did not happen
again."
The senate also postponed a vote
on a bill to change the rules of order
and tabled indefinitely a bill to
specifically delineate the powers of
the ASSU and the COP.
