# Losing appeal
## Law School applications drop about 18 percent 
### September Trevi√±o Staff writer 
Students applying to law schools
this year may have an easier time
getting admitted to their top choic
es.
Stanford Law School applica
tions are expected to drop by 18 per
cent, while administrators at Yale
and Harvard Universities are pre
dicting a plunge in applications of
about 10 percent and 17 percent re
spectively. This parallels a national
trend, with law school applications
across the country plummeting this
year as much as 13 percent.
"I think this is a very realistic
and healthy response to the situa
tion within law firms," said Paul
Brest, dean of the Law School.
Brest suggested that recent layoffs
in top corporate law firms have cast
doubts on job prospects and long
term job security.
"We could be going back to a pre

' Bos period," he said, characterizing
the 1980s as an "exceptional"
decade in which the legal prospects
prompted by increasing mergers
and acquisitions made law a popu
lar choice among job seekers.
As the corporate law firm goes
through tough economic times,
I jaw Prof. William Baxter said, re
cent economic recovery in other
areas could also impact the situa
tion. He suggested that the law pro
fession's resilience against the re
cession made it an attractive job
prospect in past years, but that as
the economy recovers, people are
looking elsewhere.
Baxter also said the "shameful
performance" of lawyers in recent
O.J. Simpson-style cases may be
turning people away from the pro
fession.
Both Brest and Law School Di
rector of Admissions Faye Deal
agreed that the drop is primarily a
function of shifting career choices.

"We haven't done anything dif
ferently and [other schools] haven't
done anything differently either,"
Deal said. She asserted that recruit
ment practices and entrance re
quirements have not dramatically
changed in recent years and are not
likely to be different in the future.
Instead, she cited a rise in med
ical and business school applicants
as a contributing factor to the re
cent legal decline.
Medical school applications na
tionwide are up 2.9 percent, and the
number of students vying for ad
mission to Stanford's Graduate
School of Business has skyrocketed
an astounding 50 percent.
The Law School received 5,246
applications in 1993. That number
rose just slightly to 5,298 last year
and is expected to bottom out at
4,500 this year after the March 1
application deadline.
Normally, the Law School re
ceives between 5,200 and 5,300
applications a year and accepts
approximately 450 applicants,
expecting 180 to attend in the fall.
"I don't have a basis for think

ing it's good or bad," said Brest.
"Whether quality [of students]
drops at the bottom, the quality at
the top of the pool is still very
strong.... There are so many veiy
good people we leave behind."
According to Deal, future trends
are hard to predict. She explained
that the recent decline may simply
mark a normal fluctuation. "One

year we were up at 6,000," she
said. "You get a real surge, you bot
tom out a few years, and then you
surge again."
Brest said he is not worried
about the decline either, suggest
ing that it may even be a healthy
turn of events. "There are many
other productive ways to con
tribute to society," he said.
