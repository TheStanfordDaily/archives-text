# Expressing their wrath against the new math
## Paly Unified curriculum draws protest from Stanford parents 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
Wielding posters and disseminating fliers, oppo
nents of Palo Alto's math curriculum protested
outside of yesterday's Palo Alto Unified School Dis
trict Board meeting.
Calling for a return to "math basics," the group
of five parents — including Stanford faculty mem
bers — said they were opposed to changes imple
mented in 1991 in the Palo Alto school curriculum
which they say emphasize conceptual thinking over
computation.
The changes are the result of the "Mathematics
Framework," a set of recommendations that ex
plain how children should learn math. Although it
has no set guidelines, it offers teachers examples
and ideal classrooms, according to Jodie Libretti, a
teacher at Hoover Elementaiy School.
The protesting group of five parents has simply
titled the changes "fuzzy math." By picketing out
side a large roomful of parents, they said they hoped
to make a statement about the detrimental effects
of the program.
Bill Evers, a Hoover Institution research fellow
and the father of a third grader at Escondido Ele
mentary School, said the school board has taken cur
riculum suggestions and pushed them too far. "My
third grader doesn't know his times tables," he said.

Hoover Fellow Bill Evers joins in a picket at the Palo Alto Unified School District Build
ing, protesting the teaching of "fuzzy math" to school children.
His wife, Leslie Evers, echoed
the same sentiment, shouting "I
know my times tables. Do you?"
to parents entering the school
board meeting.
Libretti said, however, that the
new curriculum "still values com

putational skills." Although she
agreed that parents have a reason
to be upset, she said the "frame
work is really a beautiful study of
how children learn mathematics."
Stanford Mathematics Depart
ment Chair Ralph Cohen, who the
school board appointed to a com
mittee to study the changes, said
that "teachers should teach the
best way they know how. They
should be able to try new things."

The group vehemently dis
agreed, holding signs that read "If
everyone is second grade, second
grade is second to none" and
"2+2=?"
Evers said a student "can get a
good grade even if he is way off on
the answer." He said a student
should learn the basics so that
they are second nature.
The parents also said the
framework holds back students

by putting them in mixed groups
and forces the teacher to become
a coach instead of an instructor.
The curriculum changes
extend to several schools on Stan
ford campus which are in the Palo
Alto Unified School District,
including Lucille Nixon Elemen
tary School on Stanford Avenue.
School board members were at
a meeting and were not available
for comment.
