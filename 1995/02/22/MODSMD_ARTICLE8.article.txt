# Expressing their wrath against the new math
## Paly Unified curriculum draws protest from Stanford parents 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
Wielding posters and disseminating fliers, oppo
nents of Palo Alto's math curriculum protested
outside of yesterday's Palo Alto Unified School Dis
trict Board meeting.
Calling for a return to "math basics," the group
of five parents — including Stanford faculty mem
bers — said they were opposed to changes imple
mented in 1991 in the Palo Alto school curriculum
which they say emphasize conceptual thinking over
computation.
The changes are the result of the "Mathematics
Framework," a set of recommendations that ex
plain how children should learn math. Although it
has no set guidelines, it offers teachers examples
and ideal classrooms, according to Jodie Libretti, a
teacher at Hoover Elementaiy School.
The protesting group of five parents has simply
titled the changes "fuzzy math." By picketing out
side a large roomful of parents, they said they hoped
to make a statement about the detrimental effects
of the program.
Bill Evers, a Hoover Institution research fellow
and the father of a third grader at Escondido Ele
mentary School, said the school board has taken cur
riculum suggestions and pushed them too far. "My
third grader doesn't know his times tables," he said.
