ig "Origins and Dilemmas of the
Contemporary Chinese State"
Dr. Michel Oksenberg
Director, Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange Between East and West, Inc.
• The Chinese Communist state has diverse roots in the late
Qing state, the anti-Japanese guerrilla experience, the 1930s
KMT state, and Stalin's Soviet state. In what ways have these
origins contributed to its contemporary form?
• How can China's leadership rebuild this eclectic Communist
state, which was originally designed to address the issues of
the late 1940s and early 19505, to meet the challenges of a
rapidly changing contemporary situation?
