# Olympic diver Louganis announces he has AIDS
## Was HIV positive during Seoul diving accident 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Greg Louganis, the
only man to sweep diving gold medals at
consecutive Olympics, said he has AIDS
and was HIV positive when he hit his head
at the 1988 Seoul Games and bled into the
pool.
In transcripts of an interview with ABC
News "20/20" to be televised Friday,
Louganis said that "according to the CDC
(Centers for Disease Control) standards of
AIDS versus HIV, I do have AIDS."
In disclosing his illness, Louganis joins
two other prominent athletes who said
they had AIDS or carried the HIV virus:
basketball star Magic Johnson and tennis
champion Arthur Ashe. Johnson retired
from the Los Angeles Lakers in 1991, and
Ashe died in February 1993, less than a
year after acknowledging he was infected.
Louganis said he tested positive for the
HIV virus just before the 1988 Seoul
Games, where he went on to win the

springboard and platform diving gold
medals — duplicating his sweep at the 1984
Los Angles Games.
It was in Seoul where Louganis cracked
his head on a reverse dive. He did not
reveal his condition to the U.S. Olympic
Committee doctor who stitched the wound,
and felt sure the chlorinated water in the
pool would dilute the virus. The doctor said
he is HIV negative.
Louganis was first tested after receiving
word that a former companion was dying of
AIDS. When the results were positive, he
was placed on the drug AZT, taking it every
four hours around the clock. He was still
taking it during the Olympics.
Louganis, who lives in Malibu, Calif.,
could not immediately be reached by The
Associated Press for comment. Telephone
calls to his attorney, Pat Benson, and
spokeswoman, Maggie Meyerson, were not
returned.
