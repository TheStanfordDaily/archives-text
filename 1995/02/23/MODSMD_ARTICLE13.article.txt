# France accuses US of spying
## Five American Embassy officials asked to leave country 
### 
PARIS (AP) — France has
accused five Americans —
including four diplomats — of
industrial and political spying
and asked them to leave the
country, a rare move that put the
allies on a diplomatic collision
course yesterday.
The clandestine efforts went
beyond the usual domain of
industrial spying, often centered
on the defense and aerospace
industries, to target the audiovi
sual and telecommunications
industries, the French newspa
per Le Monde said.
The Americans also made
their way into Cabinet circles
and paid officials to obtain infor
mation, the paper said, quoting
extensively from Interior Min
istry and counterintelligence
documents.
French news reports said
those accused included the top
CIA official in Paris.
In Washington, the State
Department dismissed the accu
sations as "unwarranted." But it
was not immediately clear

whether the United States
planned retaliatory action.
A statement by State Depart
ment spokeswoman Christine
Shelly did not contain a direct
denial of the French allegations
but said there was "no reason for
expelling any Americans, nor is
the French government calling
for it."
Shelly also referred to "allega
tions in the French press, citing
French government sources."
White House spokesman Mike
McCurry said "it remains to be
seen" whether the Americans
would leave. He suggested disclo
sure of the affair was linked to
France's presidential campaign,
in which a wiretapping scandal
has embarrassed Premier
Edouard Balladur, the front-run
ner.
France is seeking the "very
rapid" departure of the five, four
of them diplomats. A fifth was a
non-diplomat who reportedly
worked under cover.
Two other U.S. Embassy
employees implicated in espi

onage had been sent home earli
er, officials said.
The U.S. Embassy refused all
comment. But in a demonstra
tion of the sensitive nature of the
affair, Ambassador Pamela Har
riman held an unusual half-hour
meeting yesterday with Bal
ladur.
She was informed of the mat
ter Jan. 26 and was summoned
two weeks later by the Interior
Ministry when the embassy failed
to take action. Le Monde said.
The U.S. Embassy has been
notified "numerous times over
numerous weeks" that the
Americans "were engaged in
activities incompatible with the
status under which they reside in
France," said the joint statement
by the Foreign and Interior min
istries.
The ministries' statement
stressed that the departure of
the Americans was a "recom
mendation . . . that in no way
constitutes an expulsion order."
It said the affairs should not
have become public.
