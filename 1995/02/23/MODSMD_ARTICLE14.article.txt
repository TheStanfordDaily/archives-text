Peace proposal
BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) —
Two years in the making, a new
approach to governing Northern Ireland
was unveiled yesterday by Britain and
Ireland as a framework for peace talks.
Indignant pro-British unionists rejected
it as "the IRA way."
In contrast to their Protestant rivals,
nationalist Roman Catholic politicians
were cheered by the 42-page document
made public by the British and Irish
prime ministers, standing side-by-side at
a conference center in Belfast.
John Major of Britain and John Bru
ton of Ireland stressed that Northern
Ireland's parties could amend or reject
their suggestions in coming negotia
tions.
The proposals include an elected Par
liament in Northern Ireland with safe
guards for the Catholic minority,
changes in British law and the Irish con
stitution to guarantee Northern Ire
land's right to choose its destiny and new

bodies to promote cooperation within the
divided island.
But the Rev. Lan Paisley, the domi
nant voice of hard-line unionism,
denounced the document as "the IRA
way, the Dublin way, the nationalist way
and the republican way ... a one-way
street to Dublin, every word of it."
The document is an attempt to lay the
groundwork for a settlement in North
ern Ireland, created in 1920 with a pro-
British Protestant majority but torn
since the late 1960s by Protestant-
Catholic violence.
Stalled talks
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) — Mired in a
stalemate with Israel over expanding
Palestinian autonomy, PLO leaders
sought help yesterday from Europe and
the Arab League to pressure Israel to
withdraw from occupied lands.
A new round of Israel-PLO talks,
meanwhile, ended without progress
toward holding Palestinian elections.

The PLO's executive committee held
a second day of talks in Cairo yesterday
to discuss ways of breaking the deadlock
over Israel's failure to withdraw from
Palestinian towns in the West Bank to
make way for elections, as called for in
the Israeli-PLO accord. Only the West
Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza Strip
are under PLO rule.
Israel has delayed a further pullback
following a spate of terrorist attacks, the
most recent on Jan. 22, when 21 Israelis
were killed in a suicide bombing.
In a statement, the committee criti
cized the expansion of Jewish settle
ments around Jerusalem and Israel's
failure to free Palestinian prisoners as
called for by the accord.
"The peace process is starting to go
round in an empty circle and is losing its
credibility and ability to continue," the
statement said.
The meeting was an indication that
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat hopes to
involve traditional Palestinian leaders in
the beleaguered peace process.
