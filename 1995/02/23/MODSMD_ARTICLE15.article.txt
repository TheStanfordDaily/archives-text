Students should take
action to save financial
aid from budgetary ax

AS THE U.S. Senate prepares
to vote on the Balanced
Budget Amendment, feder
al funding for financial aid to col
lege students has been put on the
chopping block. House Republi
cans have already proposed to cut
federal student loans by $9.6 bil
lion over the next five years.
The amendment, part of the
House Republicans' "Contract
with America," must pass the
Senate with a two-thirds majority
and then be ratified by three
quarters of the states to become
effective. While the the amend
ment's future is uncertain, it
seems inevitable that congres
sional leaders will be slashing
government spending in the
future.
Republicans have sworn to
leave Social Security off the table
and end reductions in defense
spending. This vow, along with
interest payments on the deficit,
which cannot be cut, leaves the
three largest portions of the fed
eral budget untouchable.
This leaves Speaker Gingrich
and company hunting for less
sacred cows to slaughter — like
aid for lower-income college stu
dents. The strategy is clearly cal
culated — college students do not
tend to vote Republican in large
numbers anyway. And, in recent
years college students have failed
to make their voices heard on the
national stage.
Now is the time for that reality
to change. If they do not stand up
and take action to protect their
interests, students now and later
will pay dearly. Every Stanford
student who believes in helping
less-fortunate members of our
society attend college should con
tact their elected representatives
and urge them to vigorously
oppose any efforts to reduce fed-

eral funding for higher education.
The ASSU, as the representa
tive government of the student
body, should also take decisive
action. This is one of the few
areas of national policy for which
debate is permitted in the ASSU
Senate under the Bone-Overdeck
amendment, which restricts the
senate's actions to issues directly
related to Stanford students. As
such, the ASSU should discuss
the current state of affairs
regarding funding for financial
aid and pass a resolution opposing
the federal government's pro
posed actions.
This accomplished, the ASSU
should organize student efforts to
fight cuts in financial aid, both on
the Stanford campus and nation
wide. The ASSU should urge the
United States Student Association
to take a strong stand against cuts
in federal funding for higher edu
cation and to unite the efforts of
college students across the coun
try.
Students will not be without
allies in this fight. College admin
istrations, already under severe
budgetary pressures, would hate
to see another source of financial
assistance disappear and are
already organizing to prevent
cuts in financial aid. In addition, a
recent poll found that 89 percent
of Americans are opposed to
reducing federal financial aid.
Social Security and defense
spending are safe from the bud
getary ax because the affected
groups are well-organized and
have made concerted efforts to
protect their interests, through
groups like the American Associa
tion of Retired People and pro-mil
itary political action committees.
Students can learn from those
groups' successes. A strong politi
cal base combined with the will to
speak out would once again make
college students a force to be reck
oned with.
As the budget battles intensify,
you can bet the AARP won't be
looking out for students' inter
ests.
