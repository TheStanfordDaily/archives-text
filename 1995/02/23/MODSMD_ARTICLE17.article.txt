## When mom started dating 
### 
I USED TO THINK that seeing my par
ents kiss was fairly sick. It was never a
big loud one, just a hi-honey-how-was
your-day peck. Very natural.
But I was in that junior high braces
stage where you think it's cool to wear
your headgear to the mail. So I was nau
seous.
Maybe it was a pubescent sexual awak
ening thing. What would Freud say? And
who would care? Anyhow, it was plain
gross. I mean, you just don't think about
your parents smooching or snuggling or
doing it. At least if you're normal you
don't.
But after my mom starting dating,
when that first guy rang the doorbell —
programmed to play the theme from Psy
cho just to freak him out — I remember
praying feverishly to go back to the days
where the most repulsive thing around
was my parents' benign kiss. When home
was home.
See, my mom started dating again
about a year after my dad died. Sure,
that's healthy and good, but for me, the
experience redefined bizarre. I was wait
ing for Jack Palance to cruise in and do his
sultry "Believe it, or not."
I guess everyone whose parents are
divorced or widowed is forced in some way
to go through this, but I was totally unpre
pared for the ambivalence, the shock, the
echoing mantra of all those supposedly
sensitive friends of the family, comment
ing in their detached way: "You know you
have to move on sometime."

Like they had any clue.
Those friends started setting her up. As
patient as her friends were, they were
probably getting antsy about that third
wheel thing. Or maybe they were getting
nervous that she was plotting to steal
their husbands.
How Melrose.
And I remember that first one who
rang doorbell that night. Not his name,
just his mounds of blond curly hair. No
gel, but plenty of mousse. In some sort of
sardonic role reversal, I ended up answer
ing the door. There he was, whistling
geekishly.
I needed to be cordial. But that Jan
Brady-ish inner voice was taunting me,
telling me not to censor the greeting. To
tell it like it was.
"Hi. So you're taking my mother out on
a weeknight. Well, I want to assure you
that I'm completely OK with this date
thing because it's been a long time. So I'm
basically over it. Don't worry about mak
ing me ill, because hey, that's life. Just
don't think I'm changing the doorbell
song to 'Here comes the bride' any time
soon."
That was the fantasy. Instead I did my
Miss Congeniality act and cooed, "Hello.
Nice to meet you. Come in." Smile, smile,
smile.
I found out that he was divorced raising
his 10-year-old son Davey. He was really
emphatic about the "y" part. Like if you
referred to Dave, he'd look at you blankly
and then think you were talking about

Letterman. He and Davey lived in one of
those L.A. cities with "Beach" in the
name. Had to respect that.
As I watched the couple slide into his
car on my mom's second-first date, I won
dered whether they could hit it off. See, I
don't know if widowed people and
divorced people can really relate. It's criti
cal if you're going to connect somewhere
above the "Sure, Italian again is fine with
me" level. Both experiences are about sep
aration and grief, but one is like, get out,
and the other is more like, don't leave.
And I was left at home with The Con
flict — she should go out and be happy and
not sit alone with pretzels and non-fat
onion dip waiting for her life to ebb away
versus she should stay here and contem
plate that standard 17 by 20 Bat Mitzvah
picture of the lovely nuclear family and
remember, until it makes her cry.
But that was years ago. I've resolved
that one since then.
Incidentally, her current man is bald
ing. From Chia-dude to the Hair Club
president. Really, he's a good guy. I don't
know what'll happen, but if she's happy,
please, what more could a daughter want?
And so far, there aren't any really sick
parts. As long as I don't have to see them
kiss.

Julie is now dating that blond-haired
man. Or his son ... she forgets.
