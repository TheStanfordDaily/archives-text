The Sixth Man Club is an embarassment to Stanford

WE JUST WATCHED a group of
white males show up five min
utes before game-time and get
ushered to reserved seating, while the
"commoners" outside, some of whom
had waited for up to two hours, were
told to go home. No, we're not talking
about a plantation in the South in the
1820s â€” we're talking about a Stan
ford men's basketball game just last
Tuesday. This contemptible group to
which we are referring is the Halftime
Sixth Man Club (that's right, Sixth
Man Club) or, to be more accurate, the
Halftime Sixth Reich Club.
This is how the Sixth Reich Club
operates: students pay money to have
a huge portion of the best seats in the
arena saved for them. They can show
up any time before the game begins
and take their privileged, half-court
seats without waiting. Meanwhile,
hundreds of "regular students" who
turn out early for the game are turned
away, in large part because so many of
the precious student seats have
already been allocated to the Sixth
Reich Club. It doesn't matter that
these "commoners" show up hours
before any of the Club members. If you
are not in the Club, there's a good

chance you won't get a seat at all.
There are so many repugnant things
about this organization that we are not
sure where to begin. First of all, the
group represents the height of elitism.
If you pay your money and join, you
don't have to wait in line, you don't
have to show up early for games and
you don't even have to mingle with the
"common folk" around you. In fact,
you sit in your own barricaded section,
directly at midcourt. How's that for
promoting harmony and fairness
amongst the student body? In this
way, the Club only serves to divide
members of the community via resent
ment and anger rather than uniting
them in their support for Stanford
athletics.
Further, the organization itself is
an embarrassment to Stanford. In a
school that prides itself on multicul
turalism, the Sixth Reich Club is a
practically all-white, all-male, fraterni
ty-dominated organization. Although
we assume the Club is open to women
and minorities, it hardly seems that
way by the looks of the group.
The Club's conduct at games is also
an abomination. As "the commoners"
are turned away from the gate, I have

seen members of the Club mock and
taunt these students for not getting
into the event. I have witnessed mem
bers so intoxicated (because their
pathetic sponsor, Halftime Sports
Cafe, provides them with liquor before
the game) that ushers and police offi
cers have had to intervene. I have seen
people in the Club act so inappropri
ately that the referee has had to stop
the basketball game and ask the mem
bers to stop being so disruptive. Sadly,
this conduct is frequently broadcast on
national television for all to see and to
condemn. In short, their behavior at
games is an embarrassment to anyone
associated with Stanford.
The presence of this Club also
demeans the Stanford community by
pandering to commercialism. Stanford
University, in an effort to turn a prof
it, has allowed a local business to spon
sor this organization. Thus, in order to
make money, regular students are
turned away from games so a business
can have a forum for publicity. This
indignity would be more tenable if the
Club benefited a local charity or home
less shelter. Instead, it's just a local
bar that the University has chosen so
ignominiously to associate itself with.

The Sixth Reich Club is an affront
to all standards of fairness and equity.
In every lecture, class and other sport
ing event at Stanford, those who show
up first are guaranteed a seat. Yet, at
basketball games, those who pay the
most, drink the most, act the most
obnoxiously and show up last get the
best seats in the stadium. In the pro
cess, this club takes up such an enor
mous portion of the already limited
student seating that many "regular
students" are turned away. It is an
insult to the Stanford community that
loyal students who arrive hours before
games are denied entry, while taunting
members of the Club are permitted to
strut into the best seats in the arena
just five minutes before game-time.
What's next? Will Stanford start bar
ring those students from classes who
aren't willing to pay extra tuition for
reserved seats and who don't want to
publicize a local bar on each of their
backs? With this in mind, the Halftime
Sixth Man Club should be immediately
and permanently abolished.
