# Fac Sen should adopt ethnic studies program during today's meeting
## 
### 
The Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences, John Shoven, will report on
Asian-American studies and Chicano
studies at the Faculty Senate meeting
tonight. As members of the student
community, we applaud Dean Shoven
for following up on student interest in
ethnic studies by establishing commit
tees to investigate the potential for
bringing these fields of study to Stan
ford. We are eager to see the results of

25 years of struggle.
Ethnic studies, as an interdisci
plinary, cross-cultural, and transna
tional complex, addresses long
neglected histories and still-marginal
ized cultural productions. It's at the
cutting-edge of academic work. More
over, with the changing demographics
of the United States, California and
Stanford itself, we can no longer avoid
what the University Committee on
Minority Issues determined in 1989
should be an integral part of Stan
ford's educational program.
As students committed to bringing
ethnic studies to Stanford for the 21st
century, we want to ensure that it
will incorporate not only the neces-

sary information on individual minor
ity populations in the United States,
but also the comparative study of eth
nic subgroups, racially-divided com
munities and global diaspora popula
tions.
With a historical perspective on
scholarship in ethnic studies over the
past two decades, we also recognize
and hope to avoid the pitfalls of stud
ies that address race at the expense of
other social identities, such as gender,
class or sexual orientation. As stu
dents with interest and expertise in
these issues, we are confident that our
voices will be heard in the campus dia
logue.
Ethnic studies will only fulfill its

potential if the programs are set up
with the academic and social integrity
that the best scholarly work demands.
Stanford's reputation as a top interna
tional university cannot simply be
protected, it must be earned. As stu
dents of the Stanford community, we
are committed to working with the
faculty and administration on this
campus to move our educational cur
riculum into the future.
