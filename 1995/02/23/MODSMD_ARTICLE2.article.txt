# Different views of beauty
## Panelists discuss how culture affects body image 
### Neha Gupta Contributing writer 
Discussing how ethnic backgrounds af
fect an individual's body image, a panel of di
verse students examined different cultural
views of the "ideal" woman's body yesterday
in Branner Hall.
The panel discussion — titled "Ethnicity
and Body Image" — was part of the ongoing
Body Image Awareness Week. The week,
now in its second year, was organized to
make the Stanford community more aware
of body image and self-esteem issues
through discussion and information.
Ironically, three of the panelists were

from the Los Angeles area, where climate
may be a factor in body awareness. They ad
mitted to being more aware of their bodies
because they lived in an area where, for "half
the year, people walk around half-naked."
The panelists from Southern California said
there was such an underlying message to be
slim at home that they felt more comfortable
and accepted after arriving at Stanford. Yet
other panelists claimed to feel more pressure
to exercise and eat properly after coming to
Stanford.

for lunch and exercising everyday, you don't

need someone to tell you to be
healthy and work out," said
senior Virginia Duplessis.
"Stanford is such an athleti
cally oriented campus that this
translates into being aware of
body image," said sophomore
Nancy Farghalli, who organized
the event.
All six panelists complained
about being subjected to the
Western ideal of the perfect
woman — blond, blue-eyed, tall
and beautiful — because of
stereotypes that invade the coun
try.
While the panelists com
plained about the media promot

ing this image, sophomore Nava
Ashraf did question the motives
behind this. "I wonder if it's us
perpetuating it because we want
to see pictures of beautiful
women."
"It's still such a large issue in
the U.S. and on campus," said
Lani Schiota, who graduated last
year. "It breaks my heart to hear
. . . girls nine and 10 years old,
talk about dieting to become
skinny."
Schiota, who is half-Japanese,
also told the audience that when
she got to high school, it sudden
ly became trendy to be half-Asian
and she began receiving a lot of
attention.
"It was then that I stopped
taking body image so seriously
because I realized how subject it
was to fashion trends," she said.

Yet Farghalli and Ashraf also
talked about how their cultural
backgrounds — Egyptian and
Iranian, respectively — also pre
sented the contrasting view that
women should be strong and
well-built: "the baby-carrying
type."
Duplessis also talked about
how her father would always joke
around about her friends being
too skinny and fattening them
up. She saw that on her father's
side of the family it was okay to
have an "hourglass figure."
While most of the women had
conflicting views of the ideal
woman pushed on them while
growing up, they all claimed to
now have more accepting and
healthy attitudes about their
bodies.
In fact, Ashraf and Schiota

said their ideas about their own
bodies have changed so dramati
cally that they now feel strongly
about adhering to proper eating
habits. "I can no longer skip a
meal — otherwise I feel awful,"
Schiota said.
"I learned that your body isn't
everything," said sophomore Sta
cie Carney.
"The emphasis needs to shift
from what your body looks like to
what your body can do for you,"
said Farghalli. "That can do so
much more for you in the long
run and make you feel good."
The idea for the panel came
from a class held last spring
called "Body Traps." The panel
was so successful in the class
that organizers decided to have a
similar panel during Body
Awareness Week.
