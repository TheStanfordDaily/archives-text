## Trojans up next for men's hoops Team must regroup after loss 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Now is the time for that "36-
hour turnaround" that Stanford
men's head basketball coach Mike
Montgomery is always exhorting.
With Tuesday night's dishearten
ing loss to UCLA, the 19th
ranked Cardinal (16-6 overall, 7-6
in the Pacific 10 Conference) now
must regroup for tonight's match
up against USC.
Tonight's contest at Maples
Pavilion will be a stark contrast to
Tuesday's game, as Stanford
finds itself going from playing the
Pac-10's penthouse to the Pac
10's outhouse. The Bruins were
the conference's creme de la
creme, whereas the Trojans (7-16
overall, 2-11 Pac-10) have been
more like curdled milk.
The main concern, however,
will be whether Stanford rises to
the occasion — as it has done in
the past — or sinks to the compe
tition. There was no problem
motivation-wise when facing the
league's best, but how about
when facing the league's worst?
"The kids, of course, wanted to
win |the UCLA game] very badly
and they came out with the idea
that we're really going to sell out
and commit," Montgomery said.
"Now we've got to turn around
and get ready for LUSC]."
While the Trojans — seeking to
snap a nine-game losing streak —
may seem to be the conference
doormats, they have played tough
against some of the league pow
ers, including UCLA, Arizona and

Arizona State.
"{This] USC team on paper
doesn't look like they're very
good," Montgomery said. "But
from what I've seen the last two
or three or four times they've
played, they're really playing hard
and causing people some prob
lems with the way they're play

The Cardinal didn't face too
many of those problems in the
team's meeting earlier this sea
son. Stanford, also coming off a
tough defeat to UCLA, was able to
bounce back with an 85-82 victory
over the Trojans. Now the Cardi
nal will try to repeat the effort to
put together both the team's
heart and a win.
"It is going to be difficult, but
everybody's going to be here and
we're all going to work through it
together," said Stanford forward
Andy Poppink. "There's no way
we can slide at all because all
these teams are coming in to play
hard, so we have to be ready one
way or another."
Poppink led all scorers with 20
points in the season's earlier
game. He is also coming off a sea
son-best 23-point effort in Tues
day's game.
"There's no doubt that we're
going to have to win," Poppink
said. "We feel like we should take
the rest of our games, but we def
initely need to pile on a few more
wins."
Although USC is at the bottom
of the barrel now, the win mav

not be as easy as it sounds.
Despite being bottom dwellers,
the Trojans do have some nice
individual talent. Arizona head
coach Lute Olson has compared
USC's leading scorer, athletic for
ward Lorenzo Orr (17.4 points
per game), with Michael Jordan.
Perhaps that's a bit of a reach,
but then there's also Trojan for

ward Jaha Wilson, the Pac-10's
leading rebounder with an aver
age of 10 boards per game.
No, it's not likely to be a cake
walk tonight, and for the Cardi
nal, it's even tougher because of
the mental elevator ride the team
has been on. This time, Stanford
is hoping the elevator is going up.
"Emotionally, if you're going
to be a team that's going to expect
to have the kind of year we're try
ing to have, you're going to have
to bounce back and be ready to
go," Montgomery said.
