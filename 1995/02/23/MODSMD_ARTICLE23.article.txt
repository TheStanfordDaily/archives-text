# No. 1 men off to National Indoors
## The
						rest of the best 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
If a coach is supposed to be
happy when his team peaks right
before a big tournament, then
Stanford men's tennis head coach
Dick Gould should be as joyous as
a kid in a candy store.
The top-ranked Cardinal (8-0)
will begin play today at the
National Team Indoors in
Louisville, Kentucky while riding
a surge of momentum created by
five decisive victories over ranked
teams within the last two weeks.
"This team has come through
a tough stretch about as good as
any team I've ever had," said
Gould, who has coached 12 NCAA
champion teams in his 28 years
with Stanford.
In that five-match stretch the
Cardinal handily defeated No. 32
UNLV, No. 11 Miami, No. 21
Fresno State, No. 46 Washington
and No. 19 California. Stanford
dropped just four out of 45
matches in those contests, and
scored straight set victories in 25
out of 28 singles wins.

The Cardinal enters today's
prestigious tournament as the top
seed and defending champion by
virtue of last year's 4-3 victory
over this year's second-seeded
and second-ranked Georgia. But
the recent wining streak by this
year's squad has made the Cardi
nal feel even more confident than
it did at this time last year.
"We have a lot of confidence at
this point," said junior Ricky
Becker. "Going into each match
we expect to win, and that helps
us."
"Last year, we'd go into a
match like the one against Cal
and be slight favorites at each
position, but two or three players
would have bad matches. This
year, either we don't have those
bad matches, or that one bad
match we might have is still good
enough to win."
Still, Gould warned that "the
real test" will come at Indoors,
when "the teams we play will all
be a notch up from the teams
we've played here."
