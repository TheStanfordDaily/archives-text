# Women's tennis in Championship
## No. 3 Stanford hopes to freeze nation's other top squads 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The Cardinal will undergo climate
shock as the Stanford women's tennis
team (7-0 overall, 2-0 in the Pacific 10
Conference's South Division) heads
from the sweltering deserts of Arizona
to the frozen tundra of Madison, Wis.,
for this weekend's USTA/ITA Women's
National Indoor Collegiate Team Ten
nis Championship.
Stanford, No. 3 in the nation, has
received the second seed overall and will
collide with host No. 34 Wisconsin (4-2,
3-2 in the Big Ten) in the first round on
Thursday.
"What's different about this tourna
ment is that it's inside and that you get

to play out-of-region schools," said head
coach Frank Brennan.
Those out-of-region schools round
out the other overall seeds in the tour
nament's draw. Georgia, the top seed,
resides in the opposite bracket. Thus
the Bulldogs and the Cardinal will not
meet unless seedings hold true to form,
and the two powerhouses meet in the
finals on Sunday.
"It will be really interesting to see
who plays where for teams outside our
region like Georgia and Florida because
they have a lot of foreigners whom some
of us really haven't had much of a
chance to see," said freshmen Ania
Bleszynski. "We may see them again in
the NCAAs."
Florida pops in at the No. 3 seed,

matched up in Stanford's bracket with
Pac-10 rival USC representing a sub
stantial first round challenge for the
Gators. The No. 4 and final seed, Duke,
will square off against Pepperdine on
Thursday.
The Cardinal may see some familiar
faces through the tournament as Pac-10
South rivals USC, UCLA and Arizona
all enter the tournament on Stanford's
side of the bracket.
However, the opposite bracket con
sists of only three teams — Georgia,
Pepperdine and UC-Santa Barbara —
that appear on the Cardinal's regular
season dual-match schedule.

a successful road trip to Ari
zona, where the Cardinal
secured its throne on top of the
Pac-10 South with dual-match
victories over both Arizona and
Arizona State. The Wildcats,
whom the Cardinal soundly

defeated 7-2, loom behind Stan
ford at second place in the divi
sion after victories over UCLA
and Cal.
"We responded to the chal
lenge," said Brennan. "It's what
we need for Wednesday, going
into the National Team
Indoors."
Wisconsin will be riding high
as well, coming off of a nail-bit
ing triumph over Big 10 nemesis

lowa (4-6, 1-3 in the Big 10) last
Sunday. The Badgers clinched
the 5-4 victory with a No. 2 dou
bles win by Jamie Fouret and
Shannon Tully (2-0).
The tournament format does
provide a consolation bracket in
which the teams losing in the
first round will be re-drawn for
play on Friday and Saturday.
The championship final will
take place on Sunday.
