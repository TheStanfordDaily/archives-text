# Cardinal to duel Women of Troy
## Will they destroy USC again? 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The No. 5 Stanford women's
basketball team (20-2 overall, 11-
1 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
takes off into the heart of Holly
wood for a rematch of a game
against the No. 23 USC Trojans
(15-6, 8-5 in the Pac-10) for
which the Cardinal could not
have written a better script.
In late January, the women of
Troy came to Maples Pavilion —
where the Cardinal has yet to fall
— and endured the worst defeat
in Pac-10 history, 109-53.
Since then, however, the Tro
jans have refused to yield, sitting
only three spots lower in the
national poll and still in con
tention for the Pac-10 title in the
fourth place behind Stanford, No.
14 Washington and No. 21 Ore
gon State. The Beavers achieved
national recognition after shock
ing Stanford in Corvallis, Ore.,
and retaining their third-place

standing in the conference.
There is no argument that
Stanford has been unstoppable in
front of the faithful at Maples
this season; the Cardinal needs
only wins against Oregon and
Oregon State to complete an
undefeated home season.
While not denying the Cardi
nal's dominance at home, head
coach Tara VanDerveer warned
that there is more to Pac-10 bas
ketball than defending one's own
kitchen. "We are very comfort
able playing here," she said after
their most recent home win. "We
have to make the adjustment to
being comfortable playing over at
Cal or at USC or UCLA."
This time, however, the Cardi
nal does not have the comfort of
their own home, and the Trojans
will be looking for vengeance
after their most embarrassing
defeat ever. In addition, USC has
posted a 7-2 record in the Los
