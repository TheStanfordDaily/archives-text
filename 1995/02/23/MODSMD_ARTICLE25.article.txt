# Cardinal to duel Women of Troy
## Will they destroy USC again? 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The No. 5 Stanford women's
basketball team (20-2 overall, 11-
1 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
takes off into the heart of Holly
wood for a rematch of a game
against the No. 23 USC Trojans
(15-6, 8-5 in the Pac-10) for
which the Cardinal could not
have written a better script.
In late January, the women of
Troy came to Maples Pavilion —
where the Cardinal has yet to fall
— and endured the worst defeat
in Pac-10 history, 109-53.
Since then, however, the Tro
jans have refused to yield, sitting
only three spots lower in the
national poll and still in con
tention for the Pac-10 title in the
fourth place behind Stanford, No.
14 Washington and No. 21 Ore
gon State. The Beavers achieved
national recognition after shock
ing Stanford in Corvallis, Ore.,
and retaining their third-place

standing in the conference.
There is no argument that
Stanford has been unstoppable in
front of the faithful at Maples
this season; the Cardinal needs
only wins against Oregon and
Oregon State to complete an
undefeated home season.
While not denying the Cardi
nal's dominance at home, head
coach Tara VanDerveer warned
that there is more to Pac-10 bas
ketball than defending one's own
kitchen. "We are very comfort
able playing here," she said after
their most recent home win. "We
have to make the adjustment to
being comfortable playing over at
Cal or at USC or UCLA."
This time, however, the Cardi
nal does not have the comfort of
their own home, and the Trojans
will be looking for vengeance
after their most embarrassing
defeat ever. In addition, USC has
posted a 7-2 record in the Los
Angeles Sports Arena, and the
Cardinal's only two losses have
come on the road in Tennessee
and Corvallis.
The Cardinal's trip to South
ern California comes six days
after Stanford completed a sea
son series sweep of Cal last Fri
day in a 91-67 blowout. Stanford
started off slowly, however, com
mitting costly turnovers that
kept the game tight early on.
In that game, Stanford turned
to the bench to provide the spark;
freshmen Naomi Mulitaoupele
and Kristin Folkl answered the
call. Mulitaoaupele injected her
self into the offense, taking scor
ing honors with 21 points in just
14 minutes. Folkl also helped the
Cardinal to a 52-29 halftime lead
with 12 points and eight
rebounds.
Mulitaoupele and Folkl proved
to be the shot in the arm that the
Cardinal first unit needed, as
Kate Starbird finished the game
with 15 points and a career-high
seven rebounds. Rachel Hemmer
also finished the contest with 15
points.
The Women of Troy enter
Thursday night's game with no
less momentum. USC's Arizona
road trip improved its away
record to 7-4 with two solid con
ference victories over Arizona
State and Arizona.
USC first downed the Sun
Devils soundly 77-65. The Tro
jans then refused to let up as
they scratched their way to a 71-
63 victory over the Wildcats to
keep themselves in the Pac-10
race.
Tina Thompson leads the
offense for the Trojans at 20
points per game, good for second
in the Pac-10. She also ranks sec
ond in the conference in
rebounding with 10 boards. The
Cardinal held Thompson to only
2-of-10 shooting and six
rebounds in the previous meet
ing.

The first place Cardinal
received some breathing space in
the race as the Cinderella-esque
Beavers played spoiler once
again, defeating the Washington

Huskies this weekend in Seattle,
74-70. Stanford now holds a two
game lead over the second-place
Huskies, three over Oregon State
and four over the Women of
