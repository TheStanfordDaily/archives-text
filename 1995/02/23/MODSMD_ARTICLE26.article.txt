# Shooting photos and dodging Dion
## 
### 
There's no better seat in
the house. Sitting in
Maples Pavilion on the
top of the T in the red-painted
"Stanford," watching Brevin
Knight driving by a bewildered
opponent, ducking when Dion
Cross dives over you to scoop
up the loose ball. There's no
better seat in the house.

Crammed between photog
raphers from the Merc, the
AP, the Chronicle and the
Quad, I may have no elbow
room on the sides, but I've got
the open court in front of me.
There are no annoying bob
bing heads of freshman in my
way or prancing cheerleaders
blocking my view.
The sports photographer's
bane is not the distraction of
frenzied fans but rather the
ominous black mass of a ref s
butt strategically positioned
directly in front of the cam
era's lens.
But there are those
moments when the black mass
slides to the side; in those

instances, all I hear is the bar
rage of camera fire. See,
although I might sit through
an entire game, media time
outs and all, the only action I
see comes in instants; I live a
frame-by-frame existence.
It's an odd paradox that a
photographer pans her camera
around, following the action,
yet only aims to capture single
moments of the game.
But, when those moments
are successfully shot on film,
when Michael Jordan is
caught frozen in time and
flight with the ball in his hand
and the bucket in his sights,
it's a high that lasts a lifetime.
Everyone appreciates a good
sports photo; they revere the
great ones.
There's honestly no feeling
like watching the players blaze
by, pressing your finger down
on the button, and praying
that you got more than just a
leg, an arm or the refs butt.
It's our job to document the
instants when a killer jam is
made, when the winning buck
et is sunk, when fans storm
the court, even when two
stupid mascots decide to have
a wresting match on the floor.
When we've got it on film,
we've got it forever.
It's a sort of God-complex.
Knowing that you've got a
great moment captured on
film, and that it's going to be
