# Shooting photos and dodging Dion
## 
### 
There's no better seat in
the house. Sitting in
Maples Pavilion on the
top of the T in the red-painted
"Stanford," watching Brevin
Knight driving by a bewildered
opponent, ducking when Dion
Cross dives over you to scoop
up the loose ball. There's no
better seat in the house.

Crammed between photog
raphers from the Merc, the
AP, the Chronicle and the
Quad, I may have no elbow
room on the sides, but I've got
the open court in front of me.
There are no annoying bob
bing heads of freshman in my
way or prancing cheerleaders
blocking my view.
The sports photographer's
bane is not the distraction of
frenzied fans but rather the
ominous black mass of a ref s
butt strategically positioned
directly in front of the cam
era's lens.
But there are those
moments when the black mass
slides to the side; in those

instances, all I hear is the bar
rage of camera fire. See,
although I might sit through
an entire game, media time
outs and all, the only action I
see comes in instants; I live a
frame-by-frame existence.
It's an odd paradox that a
photographer pans her camera
around, following the action,
yet only aims to capture single
moments of the game.
But, when those moments
are successfully shot on film,
when Michael Jordan is
caught frozen in time and
flight with the ball in his hand
and the bucket in his sights,
it's a high that lasts a lifetime.
Everyone appreciates a good
sports photo; they revere the
great ones.
There's honestly no feeling
like watching the players blaze
by, pressing your finger down
on the button, and praying
that you got more than just a
leg, an arm or the refs butt.
It's our job to document the
instants when a killer jam is
made, when the winning buck
et is sunk, when fans storm
the court, even when two
stupid mascots decide to have
a wresting match on the floor.
When we've got it on film,
we've got it forever.
It's a sort of God-complex.
Knowing that you've got a
great moment captured on
film, and that it's going to be


Through

around longer than you are. ... It
makes you feel immortal. At least
it makes me feel that way.
That's where the high comes
from — looking at a photo 10
years later and remembering the
instant that Cross took the des
peration three — with two sec
onds to the buzzer and a burly
UConn brute in his face — and
got nothing but net for the win
and the 1995 NCAA champi
onship crown. That's the mea
sure of a great sports photo.
The point isn't to document
the present, it's to immortalize
the past.
Looking through the lens is
like viewing the world in the past
tense. In taking pictures of great
sports moments, we never actual
ly see action happen. But after
the film is out of the soup, has
run through the drier and is laid
out on the light table, we know it
was a great game.
Seeing those pictures is like

living the instant all over again.
And when some guy off the street
says he noticed your photo and
adds that it was cool, or — better
yet — when a fellow photogra
pher turns to you at the next
game and says "that photo was
bitchin'," you start to realize that
it's all worth it. Referees' butts in
the way, annoying cheerleaders
and water boys, the fact that 119
out of your last 120 shots were
crap — none of those problems
seems to matter any more.
The God-complex comes from
knowing that your photograph
helped someone else relive the
moment; that's what gives me a
high.
So, it's well known that I can't
write. This column proves that
fact well. After all that rambling,
here's my point: when you turn
to the sports page to get a feel for
last night's game, forget about
reading the articles or the
columns. Just look at the photos.
