# Women swimmers seek ninth straight conference title
## 
### Ezra Baylin Contributing writer 
The top-ranked Stanford
women's swimming team travels
to Seattle, Wash., today in an
attempt to win its ninth consecu
tive Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionship. The Cardinal is heavily
favored to win the meet, having
soundly defeated all five of the
other ranked teams in the league.
However, third-ranked USC
may pose a significant threat to
Stanford's perfect conference
record this season. Though the
Cardinal pummeled the Trojans
192-107 in January, even head
coach Richard Quick character
ized that win as a "surprise."
"USC's goal is the end of the
season. It was significant that we
beat them," said Quick "Howev
er, it was only significant on the
day of the meet. They are a fast
team."
Though USC may provide
some competition, this meet
should belong to Stanford's
seniors. Senior co-captains Becky

Crowe and Kendra Thayer and
seniors Julie Kole, Eileen
Richetelli and Jenny Thompson
have won three national champi
onship meets and three Pac-10
championships and can boast a
27-0 dual meet record over their
Stanford careers.
Stanford's perfect record has
been the result of a combination
of superstar talent and potent
depth in all areas. The team is
chock full of talent, reflected by
the team's former Olympians,
Thompson and sophomore Clau
dia Franco.
Stanford's depth has also been
instrumental. More than half of
the Cardinal swimmers have
qualified for this season's NCAA
championship meet and Stan
ford's sprint freestyle attack is
the strongest in the country.
"Our depth in the sprint free
program is the best I've had as a
coach," Quick said. "We have
eight people who are quality
sprint free athletes. Since sprint
free is so important in intercolle
giate swimming, our sprinters

give us a definite advantage."
Though Thompson and Franco
anchor the free events, freshmen
Becky Bicknell and Lindsay
Gassner have posted times fast
enough to qualify for the NCAA
championships; they could also
make an impact this weekend.
Depth is also important in the
distance events; three-time Ail-
American sophomore Sarah
Anderson leads the way for the
Cardinal here. Anderson qualified
for the NCAA meet in the 1650-
yard freestyle earlier in February,
and Quick expects her to do well
at the championship meet.
"The distance end of the
freestyle is really shaping up
well," Quick said. "Kendra Thay
er and Sarah Anderson have put
themselves in good shape for top
performances."
Cardinal divers will also com
pete this weekend, but their meet
will be held at the Rose Bowl
Aquatics Center at UCI.A. Two
