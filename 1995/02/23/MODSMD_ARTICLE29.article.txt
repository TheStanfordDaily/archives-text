# Top-ranked golfers caught at the finish

After last weekend, the Stanford men's
golf team has had just about enough of final
round heroics. The top-ranked and defend
ing national champion Cardinal fell victim to
last-day charges by No. 2 Oklahoma State
and No. 7 Texas Christian at the Taylor-
Made-Big Island Invitational played at the
King's Course in Waikiloa, Hawaii.
Despite a solid third-day performance by
Stanford, the combination of a rough second
round for the Cardinal and strong finishes
by OSU and TCU allowed both teams to
push Stanford back into third place.
The Cardinal started forcefully, leading
the field of 20 schools with a nine-under par
279 on the first day. On the second day how
ever, senior All-Americans Casey Martin and
Steve Burdick had difficulties and the team
was forced to include a 79 on their team
tally.
"The team played a spectacular first
round," said head coach Wally Goodwin,

"and it's usually really difficult to follow up
a performance like that.
"I was very pleased with the way the guys
played after a two-and-a-half month layoff,"
he continued. "They aren't hitting on all five
cylinders, but they definitely look strong."
Burdick expressed the combination of sat
isfaction and disappointment that he felt.
"We made a good effort, but we just
couldn't pull the win off," he said. "We have
really high expectations of ourselves, but I
think we played pretty well, considering this
is our first meet in a couple of months."
Individually, freshman Tiger Woods, who
was coming off knee surgery, nearly notched
another win on his young collegiate career,
missing a five-foot birdie putt on the first
sudden death playoff hole while Arizona
State's Chris Hanel sank a clutch 15-footer.
Woods, Stanford's low-scorer this season,
silenced any doubts concerning his health by
turning in three straight under-par perfor
mances and storming through the field.
Senior All-American Notah Begay 111 also
played steadily, finishing with scores of 73-

73-72 for a total of 218.
Unfortunately, consistency was the
exception and not the mean for the Cardinal.
Martin, the leader after a spectacular six
under par 66 in the first round, struggled on
the second day, shooting a seven-over-par 79
and falling to 19th place. For teammate Will
Yanigasawa, the problem was the opposite:
the senior All-American weathered a rough
start, shooting 77 on the first day before
recovering to shoot even par on the second
and third days.
"Streaky" was how Martin described his
performance. "I just didn't feel quite as
consistent as I did earlier in the season, but
that's just part of not having competed for
a while."
Of all the Stanford players, Burdick had
the most problems, losing his rhythm after a
first round 73 and finishing in 97th place
after posting scores of 80 and 79 the next
two days.
"I was really driving poorly last week
end," Burdick said. "I needed to keep more
of my drives on the fairway."
