# Castaño to have public policy focus next year
## 
### Molly Stephens 
After several years as the world affairs theme
dorm, Castano will acquire a new personality next
year — one with a public policy focus.
The dorm, located in the Manzanita II complex,
will redirect its current focus on foreign lands to a
more comprehensive concentration on the United
States and its relations with other countries.
Under the leadership of Political Science Assoc.
Prof. Luis Fraga and Charlene Aguilar, the associate
director of the Stanford Center for Chicano Re
search, the new focus will define public policy to in
clude both domestic and international issues and
provide students with the opportunity to explore
events both at home and abroad.
"We want to get the whole dorm involved in issues
facing the nation," Fraga said. "We want to have dis
cussions of issues facing the 1996 Congress."
The dorm will explore the environment, urban
poverty, racial interactions, immigration, affirma
tive action, educational policy and health care re
form, among other issues.
Fraga also said that he wants public officials and
community advocates to speak to students and pro
fessors.
Saying that he wanted to "bridge the gap between
people who do not normally talk to each other,"
Fraga added that he hopes to let "academics con
tribute to public policy."
Michelle Lee, residence dean for the Manzanita
complex, said she believes the public policy focus will
provide students with a wonderful opportunity to
both narrow and broaden their viewpoints on con
temporary issues.
"A public policy focus will allow students to ad
dress the particular issues they are concerned about,
such as the border and immigration," she said.
"These issues are some students' defining character
istics. "
She added that the inclusion of international rela
tions will broaden the area of research and discus
sion.
Fraga and Aguilar, currently resident fellows at
Cedro, decided to move to Castano after History
