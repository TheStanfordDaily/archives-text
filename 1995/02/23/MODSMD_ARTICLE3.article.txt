# Castaño to have public policy focus next year
## 
### Molly Stephens 
After several years as the world affairs theme
dorm, Castano will acquire a new personality next
year — one with a public policy focus.
The dorm, located in the Manzanita II complex,
will redirect its current focus on foreign lands to a
more comprehensive concentration on the United
States and its relations with other countries.
Under the leadership of Political Science Assoc.
Prof. Luis Fraga and Charlene Aguilar, the associate
director of the Stanford Center for Chicano Re
search, the new focus will define public policy to in
clude both domestic and international issues and
provide students with the opportunity to explore
events both at home and abroad.
"We want to get the whole dorm involved in issues
facing the nation," Fraga said. "We want to have dis
cussions of issues facing the 1996 Congress."
The dorm will explore the environment, urban
poverty, racial interactions, immigration, affirma
tive action, educational policy and health care re
form, among other issues.
Fraga also said that he wants public officials and
community advocates to speak to students and pro
fessors.
Saying that he wanted to "bridge the gap between
people who do not normally talk to each other,"
Fraga added that he hopes to let "academics con
tribute to public policy."
Michelle Lee, residence dean for the Manzanita
complex, said she believes the public policy focus will
provide students with a wonderful opportunity to
both narrow and broaden their viewpoints on con
temporary issues.
"A public policy focus will allow students to ad
dress the particular issues they are concerned about,
such as the border and immigration," she said.
"These issues are some students' defining character
istics. "
She added that the inclusion of international rela
tions will broaden the area of research and discus
sion.
Fraga and Aguilar, currently resident fellows at
Cedro, decided to move to Castano after History
Prof. Norman Naimark, the cur
rent Castano RF, announced his
intention to retire from dorm life.
"The focus of the house
depends of the resident fellows'
interests," said Anne Porteus,
acting director of Residential
Education.
Porteus said that the change
of the house's focus is "not any
thing major," adding that resi
dent fellows stay several years
and then leave, thereby changing
the focus of the house.
Forteus disclosed that other
focus houses will also be chang
ing areas of concentration next
year because other resident fel

lows are planning to leave. Since
agreements have not yet been
finalized, however, she could not
reveal any more information.
The situation in Castano will
allow Fraga and Aguilar to com
bine their interests, both said.
Fraga's academic focus is on
urban politics and the politics of
race and ethnicity, while Aguilar
studies public policy education.
The two plan to develop work
ing groups among the students
in Castano to research contem
porary issues and to write posi
tion papers to present to the
dorm and to the Stanford com
munity.
They also hope to coordinate
with Lantana, the public service
focus dorm, to create projects to
advance public policy, Aguilar
said.
