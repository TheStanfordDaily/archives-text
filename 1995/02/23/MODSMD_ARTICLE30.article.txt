# Team needs strong performance in Hawaii tourney to stay No. 1

The sight of Stanford atop the men's
Golf World rankings has become a familiar
one this season for the Cardinal, which has
been perched there since the start of the sea
son some five months ago.
The team might be in for a change of
scenery, however.
This week, No. 1 defending national
champion Stanford takes on No. 2 Okla
homa State in the John F. Burns Invitation
al at Kaneohe, Hawaii, in what could be a
decisive match for the two rivals.
The Cardinal should have their hands
full. The Cowboys have had Stanford's
number of late, defeating the men in the
last two tournaments that both teams com
peted in.
"We are definitely looking to beat OSU,"
said head coach Wally Goodwin. "If the
rankings came out today, they'd be No. 1
and we'd be No. 2.

"We're not the only golf team in Ameri
ca,"he continued. "We shouldn't expect to
win every tournament or be No. 1 all the
time, but I think we are in a group of six to
eight teams that have a shot at the title and
any time we play one of those other five or
seven teams, we have to look to play com
petitively."
The momentum definitely lies with OSU,
which came from behind to beat Stanford on
the last day of two different tournaments
and won the Golf World Collegiate with a
dramatic 15-foot birdie putt on the final hole
of the tournament.
Stanford's outlook remains bright,
despite the Cardinal's loss last weekend.
After a two-and-a-half-month break, the
team is trying to regain the form they had
earlier this season as they prepare for the
NCAAs.
"We're really starting to get back into the
competitive mode," said senior All-American
Will Yanigasawa. "We're still trying to get
our timing down, but we have to remember

that we haven't competed for a while and
that we shouldn't get down on ourselves too
much these first couple of weeks."
Compared to most of the other teams
Stanford has played and will play this week,
the Cardinal has been relatively inactive as
of late. Almost all of them had already com
peted before the TaylorMade Invitational
last weekend. In addition, rain in the Bay
Area has kept the team off the links for the
most part.
"The weather in Palo Alto just hasn't
been very cooperative lately," said senior
All-American Casey Martin. "We really
haven't been about to prepare as much as we
would have liked."
But the combination of the TaylorMade
tournament and better weather has given
the golfers a chance to iron out the kinks.
"This should definitely be a better indica
tion of our abilities," said senior All-Ameri
can Steve Burdick. "We've had a little more
time to work some of the bugs out of our
game."
