# Engineers get new course: yacht modeling
## 
### Allison Short Staff writer 
Hoping to diversify a strenuous engineer
ing curriculum, the University will offer a
different sort of course this spring quarter â€”
an elective for undergraduates interested in
constructing model yachts.
Currently, there are only two or three
electives in the School of Engineering for
undergraduates. The new course, titled The
Computer Aided Design of Model Yachts, is
the result of a $10,000 grant to the school.
"It's an exciting introduction to engineer
ing," said Rolf Faste, director of Product
Design, who will be teaching the course with
Director of Student Shops Craig Milroy and
teaching assistant Kurt Dammermann.
The course, limited to 30 undergraduates,
will require students to design and build a
22-inch free-sailing model yacht, which will
be tested in a major sailing event.
By the end of the quarter, students will
have a strong knowledge of sailing theory,
model yacht design, the software programs
Max Surf and Vellum and necessary yacht

construction techniques.
Faste stressed that no engineering back
ground is required for the course. "Students
could get involved and build something with
out math and physics," Faste said. "I'm hop
ing a few brave frosh and sophomores who
are not thinking about engineering will take
it."
Faste and Milroy have offered ME 209:
Aesthetics of Machinery, a similar course
limited to 15 engineering graduate students,
every two years since 1986.
In the past three years, the project focus
became the design and construction of a
model sailing yacht. However, this is the first
time the class will be available for under
graduates.
Faste, a resident fellow in Toyon Hall,
mentioned the idea of the course at house
meetings and received a great deal of positive
student feedback about the course.
"It mixes a hobby with engineering and
design," freshman Erin Kassoy said.
"It's an experiment on my part," Faste
said. "I think it's do-able."
The $10,000 grant will be used to pur-

chase computer software, which will do a lot
of the "hard work" in designing the yachts,
said Faste. By using the software program
and laser cutter, students will be able to build
a boat in just a few minutes.
"It's amazing software and it's interesting
to see how students will respond," Faste said.
"It raises interesting questions because you
can build something before you understand
it."
Due to the class limit of 30 students, pref
erence will be given to students "who have a
passion to build a beautiful sailboat," Faste
said.
The course will begin by requiring each
student to build a quick, simple toy sailboat
which will be tested after two weeks and help
weed students out. With the aid of the com
puter software, students will be divided into
teams of three to create 10 designs for a 22-
inch model sailing yacht.
Students will then individually construct
their own boats to one of the plans. The class
will end with students fine tuning their boats
this June at Spreckles Lake in Golden Gate
Park.
