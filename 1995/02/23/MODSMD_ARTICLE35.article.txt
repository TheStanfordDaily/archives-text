# The 						Music of Art: Pizzicato Five
## 
### 
If putting sounds into words is a Sisyphean
task, then writing about the multimedia
experience of Japanese trio Pizzicato Five is
all the more impossible. Any story might
only threaten to homogenize the group, ex
plaining away what's unique with the same
words that adorn whoever is today's Ameri
can alt-radio wonder. like the "modern
rock" music that's covered, it's all too easy for
reviews and features to render the different as
the same.
On such terms, one could just say that
Pizzicato Five is a cool dance combo that's
the Japanese version of Deee-Lite and Saint
Etienne. And the band has its commercial al
ternative hit, "Twiggy Twiggy/Twiggy vs.
James Bond," which samples the theme to
"Hawaii Five-O," is featured in the movie
"Ready to Wear" and also happens to be one
of the neatest and best-crafted songs in re-

cent memory. Put it another way: "This
Tokyo trio's wacky and wonderful hybrid of
dance-cocktail lounge-pop sounds has the
rock world singing its praises," claim the
folks at US magazine in a blurb about "buz/"
bands that could be "the next Offspring, the
next Beck, the next Sheryl Crow." What's that
about making the different the same?
But to be fair, that might be as close as any
one's going to get to Pizzicato Five, because
there's only layer after layer to peel off. That's
not to say the band is naively shallow or
mockingly jaded — in fact, Pizzicato Five
seems far from either; but in addition to the
difficulties of verbalizing the music and the
visual imagery that's important to this band's
identity, there's the cultural gap to cross, so
any snapshot of the trio is bound to be fuzzy.
On top of that, Pizzicato Five takes its cue
from a plethora of pop culture sources and
plays off the happy irony of pop music, mak
ing description all the more futile. Without
knowing any more, it's almost enough to dis
miss the band's canny pop art as sideshow
camp, today's in-thing and tomorrow's in
joke.
"Gimmick is just a trick to grab, to catch
interest," P5 mastermind Yasuharu Konishi
tells in an interview via fax and filtered
through a translator. "Then if you have qual
ity to show, gimmick is a door to another
world, you know? The difference (between
gimmick and art) depends on the world the
door opens to."
If the Pizzicatomania that's just hitting the
U.S. is a fad, then it's got to be the longest
running music fad this side of MTV. At
home in Japan, the band is renowned for
being quite a prolific act, a top 40 sensation
that's released 14 albums since Konishi and
Keitaro Takanami (K-Taro) founded the
group in 1984.
In those eleven years, Pizzicato Five has
gone through numerous incarnations and

experimented with a number of
musical identities; put simply, P5
is a soul band with pop sensibili- »
ties that has ventured into dub,
techno and hip-hop. Fven better,
Konishi himself describes his
band's work as "the music of art:
time machine of sound." The cur
rent model, showcased on their 1994
stateside debut "Made in USA,"

is fueled by the inventive craft
of Konishi and K-Taro (who
left P5 in 1994) and fronted by
the vogue looks and smooth
crooning of fashion plate
Maki Nomiya (Maki).
"It is all inspired by the
great artists of the past and
present: Smokey Robinson, Sly
and the Family Stone, Andv

Warhol, Bruce Lee, Ozu Ya
sujiro (Tokyo Stories), Jean
Luc Godard, Beatles,
Rolling Stones, Monkees,"
Konishi explains.
"First 1 dream about the
title, then the music comes.
Then Maki and 1 and our
good friend Mitsuo Shin
do, (our) Art Director,
come up with feeling and
concept and style. Studio
work is a mysterious
process."
With Maki's arrival in
1991, the band has sought
to cross the line from pop
music to pop art, if there is
one. As much as the music
itself, P5 is about image
and style, one building and
feeding off the other. For

instance, its live performance has be
come something of an urban legend,
a fashion show combined with a rock
concert: the band's U.S. manage
ment spins a fantastic yarn about a
spectacle consisting of a runway, a
horde of models, costumes and big
(lags emblazoned with the band's name.
Americans will be getting a scaled-

down version of that l's experi
ence as the group kicks off its
first U.S. tour tonight at tin
I Great American Music Hall in
San Francisco.
"We are multimedia band in
old-fashioned sense," Konishi
writes. "Have you seen our pho
tobook? It is like so. But of course
you can listen to our CD anc
enjoy, 1 hope, lust play it loud!"

Still, as with all ex
treme pop culture
movements, it took
time for Pizzicato Five to
gain popularity in Japan, to
I turn from a cult favorite into
"a pretty big deal," as Ps's bio
puts it. In a comprehensive
history of the band, Japanese
music critic Kentaro Taka
hashi points out that, even
back home, the group "has
always been, in a sense, an
alien presence!"
An "alien presence" there,
Pizzicato Five was non-exis
tent on this side of the Pacif
ic until the past year. Before
Matador Records released
"Made in USA" last fall (the
FP "Five by Five" preceded

the album by a couple of months), the only
exposure Americans had of the band consist
ed of a few hard-to-come-by imports and a
Japanese artists gig at the 1993 New Music
Seminar.
The band caught the attention of Matador
when an employee got a video of one of Ps\
live performances. In a short matter of time,
Pizzicato Five has become one of Matador's
more popular acts, finding a nice niche along
side Liz Phair and Pavement in the label's
cooler than cool line-up. It seems that Maki
has become the company tlag bearer, bran
dishing the Matador cape logo with "Pizzica
to" scrawled on it on the cover of "Made in
USA."
iinn ade in USA" stands as one of
■ 1994's best and most clever
I W I offerings, making good on
the promise of gimmick with quality. The
album sports then sheds sounds as if it were
Halloween between each of the 11 tracks. The
smooth and mellow "I" is like a preface to the
record; Maki's clear voice trots beside a crisp
bass line and a light accordion accompani
ment, sounding like the kind of thing you'd
want to hear while window shopping or shuf
fling by streetside cafes.
At an instant, the calm and stately shimmy
turns groovy, giving way to a bit of horns and
a slinky bass rhythm that make up the intro
to "Sweet Soul Revue." Maki's voice rings
briskly above it all, making soul music that,
ironically, never goes over the top. The next
cut, "Magic Carpet Ride," takes off in anoth
er direction with its psychedelic feel and
snake charmer flourishes. One of the tracks
that's done up in English, the "catchy pop'
tune does lose a bit of the edge that's on the
rest of album, but as Konishi tells, they're
"working on it."
"Translation was not easy," Konishi notes.
"My lyrics in Japanese are very ironic and it's
hard to communicate nuance."
