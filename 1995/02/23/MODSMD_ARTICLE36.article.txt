# and its Quality Gimmick

"This Year's Girl #2," which is basically an
interview backed by some lounge-y music,
seems to be playing up irony and nuance. Al
though those of us who don't understand
Japanese might just take it for some funny
chatter, Maki's answers are most likely play
ing off something we don't quite get. For in
stance, her response that her favorite fashion
is "fashion that's cute, gorgeous, and in bad
taste" could be a good way to describe P5 it
self, even if one does know better. Or maybe
that's the point.
So writing about Pizzicato Five doesn't re
ally get anyone closer to anything. But it gets
the word out and that itself is a worthy pur
pose in this case. That an audience over here
has latched on to a phenomenon that seems
out of water and out of time is a good sign.
Not only for the media types, but for anyone
who cares about music. â–
