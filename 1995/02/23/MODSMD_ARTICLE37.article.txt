# Sherwood Schwartz's brainchild grows up

It is (albeit embarrassingly so) a little

with a mo
nopoly on the
answers to the
great modern
mysteries:

Why did the
Howells pack so
many suitcases for a
three-hour tour?
What ever hap
pened to Carol's first
husband?

How come, after all that time on

the island, no one ever bonked?
Sherwood Schwartz: the creator, produc
er and writer of "The Brady Bunch," "Gilli
gan's Island" and their incessant theme
songs; the fortuitous perpetrator of family
values and the middle-class paradigm.
And now he's running the interview cir
cuit to talk up the latest re-re-revival of the
ne'er-to-die Brady clan.
"Actually, 1 don't have all the answers,"
says Schwartz. "The thing that always sur
prised me is just how much more all the fans
know about the episodes than 1 do. They'll
come up to me and say, 'Marcia Marcia
Marcia,' and I have to think about it."
More than that, he admits most of the
Bradvs' fame came as a surprise to him —
an accidental nerve hit by putting two coin
cidentally occurring pieces of information
together.
"I do recall what inspired the Bradys," he
tells as the drum roll starts beating. "It was
in the mid-'60s when I was looking in a
newspaper and 1 saw that 30 percent of all
marriages in America had a child by a for
mer marriage. I thought, 'Now that's some
statistic."'
One could hear the gears grinding.
"And then, a few days later, my daughter
came to me with a story about a boy who
was in a play at her school, and the school
had only allowed one ticket for each stu
dent. Well, the kid's mother had just remar
ried, and he was worried that if he gave his
mother the ticket, his new stepfather would
be upset and think he didn't like him, but if
he gave his stepfather the ticket, his mother
would be upset."
The realization occurred to Schwartz
then that "kids are really bothered by the
most trivial things. A parent would just tell <

the kid to pick
but a kid will
scrutinize

the decision," and
he had a full blown
case of marketable

sensitivity — one pow
erful enough on which to base a whole
episode.

So apparently, to some empathic yet
laughable degree, we are supposed
to take the Bradys seriously. Just sit
ting on Grampa Schwartz's knee and listen
ing to his ancient tales of the creative
process, one is stricken with the fact that he
sees his work not only as entertainment, but
as a social influence as well.
"We made this show at a time before
there was such a phrase as 'family values.'
But that's what it was about."
So when Paramount hit him up with the
racy first drafts of the film's script, Schwartz
was glad he insisted on retaining final ap
proval. "It was a good thing too," he says.
"You wouldn't believe some of the things
that were on some of the drafts of the script.
There arc things they wanted the kids to say,
I can't even tell them to you."
But in sit-sitcom world where it's okay
for Marcia to marry a man she's only known
for two weeks, but Cindy saying "penis" is
crossing the line, one wonders what, exact-

ly, would be taking the Bradys too tar.
"Now, I was part of the original series, as
well as the animated series. That was also a
concept — to put the kids without the par
ents in a world of imagination — but I did
not work on the variety hour. I thought it
was just the wrong place for the Brady kids
to be, in the center of a variety show.
"And, well, if we made another movie, a
sequel, where the Bradys are in the '90s
again, that just wouldn't be necessary. We've
already explored that concept."
Ah, so the Bradys arc a conceptual bunch.
But Schwartz is ultimately pleased with
the results of this film effort — impressed
with the "uncanny" resemblance of his
Brady doubles and amused with the
comedic transposition of old onto new.
Still all this comic theory is fine and
nice, but they aren't what one wants
to hear from Mr. Sherwood
Schwartz. One wants to hear the secrets.
Ironically though, those are the topics he

likes the least. He de
flects specific episode
questions with anec
dotes like the brilliant

Hollywood veteran he is.

"No, it wasn't hard to
avoid sex on the [Gilligan's]
island, even on the movie

camera episode."
Schwartz says. "To be
| honest, we never

I thought much about it
at the time. I mean,
Tina Louise [Ginger],

she was a sexy character,
but otherwise, none of
the others had it in them.

A funny thing though,
you know who, of all the
characters on the island,
you know who got the

most mail, the most

letters? It was Mary
Anne [Dawn Wells)
— she's a lovely

girl."
So rather
than reveal the

cause of death of
the original Mrs.
Brady, he would

rather talk about his
wonderful son. And

rather than settle the puz
zle of Carol's divorced versus

widowed status, he would rather
expound on the virtue of a theme

song.
"Having the theme song made it so that
we didn't have to retell the situation every
week.... Nothing can kill a good story like
exposition. But with a theme song to retell
the story, we could avoid all that."
So Schwartz relates that it was only by ac
tually singing the Gilligan's Island theme
song to the network executives that he final
ly convinced them that the show would
work.
"It's true," he tells. "The night before a
big meeting, 1 sat down and wrote the
theme song. I passed out copies and they
read it, but they just didn't get it. They said
to me, 'Would you sing it for us?' Now I'm a
terrible singer, but you know... you've got
to do what you've got to do. I sang and then
we had a series."
So when you get to hear stories like
these — about how pillars of
American consciousness came to
be — it suddenly becomes OK that this still
creative man can make one last round of
Brady bucks, thus reaffirming something
we could already tell by the cut of Greg's
shirt: that Americans, though well-meaning
and generally fun to play with, are inherent
ly tasteless.
Incidentally, of all 116, do you know
which is Schwartz's favorite episode of "The
Brady Bunch?"
"Actually, I like the Marcia Marcia Mar
cia episode best." ■

came to me with a story about a boy who
was in a play at her school, and the school
had only allowed one ticket for each stu
dent. Well, the kid's mother had just remar
ried, and he was worried that if he gave his
mother the ticket, his new stepfather would
be upset and think he didn't like him, but if
he gave his stepfather the ticket, his mother
would be upset."
The realization occurred to Schwartz
then that "kids are really bothered by the
most trivial things. A parent would just tell <

the kid to pick
but a kid will
scrutinize

the decision," and
he had a full blown
case of marketable

sensitivity — one pow
erful enough on which to base a whole
episode.

So apparently, to some empathic yet
laughable degree, we are supposed
to take the Bradys seriously. Just sit
ting on Grampa Schwartz's knee and listen
ing to his ancient tales of the creative
process, one is stricken with the fact that he
sees his work not only as entertainment, but
as a social influence as well.
"We made this show at a time before
there was such a phrase as 'family values.'
But that's what it was about."
So when Paramount hit him up with the
racy first drafts of the film's script, Schwartz
was glad he insisted on retaining final ap
proval. "It was a good thing too," he says.
"You wouldn't believe some of the things
that were on some of the drafts of the script.
There arc things they wanted the kids to say,
I can't even tell them to you."
But in sit-sitcom world where it's okay
for Marcia to marry a man she's only known
for two weeks, but Cindy saying "penis" is
crossing the line, one wonders what, exact-

ly, would be taking the Bradys too tar.
"Now, I was part of the original series, as
well as the animated series. That was also a
concept — to put the kids without the par
ents in a world of imagination — but I did
not work on the variety hour. I thought it
was just the wrong place for the Brady kids
to be, in the center of a variety show.
"And, well, if we made another movie, a
sequel, where the Bradys are in the '90s
again, that just wouldn't be necessary. We've
already explored that concept."
Ah, so the Bradys arc a conceptual bunch.
But Schwartz is ultimately pleased with
the results of this film effort — impressed
with the "uncanny" resemblance of his
Brady doubles and amused with the
comedic transposition of old onto new.
Still all this comic theory is fine and
nice, but they aren't what one wants
to hear from Mr. Sherwood
Schwartz. One wants to hear the secrets.
Ironically though, those are the topics he

likes the least. He de
flects specific episode
questions with anec
dotes like the brilliant

Hollywood veteran he is.

"No, it wasn't hard to
avoid sex on the [Gilligan's]
island, even on the movie

camera episode."
Schwartz says. "To be
| honest, we never

I thought much about it
at the time. I mean,
Tina Louise [Ginger],

she was a sexy character,
but otherwise, none of
the others had it in them.

A funny thing though,
you know who, of all the
characters on the island,
you know who got the

most mail, the most

letters? It was Mary
Anne [Dawn Wells)
— she's a lovely

girl."
So rather
than reveal the

cause of death of
the original Mrs.
Brady, he would

rather talk about his
wonderful son. And

rather than settle the puz
zle of Carol's divorced versus

widowed status, he would rather
expound on the virtue of a theme

song.
"Having the theme song made it so that
we didn't have to retell the situation every
week.... Nothing can kill a good story like
exposition. But with a theme song to retell
the story, we could avoid all that."
So Schwartz relates that it was only by ac
tually singing the Gilligan's Island theme
song to the network executives that he final
ly convinced them that the show would
work.
"It's true," he tells. "The night before a
big meeting, 1 sat down and wrote the
theme song. I passed out copies and they
read it, but they just didn't get it. They said
to me, 'Would you sing it for us?' Now I'm a
terrible singer, but you know... you've got
to do what you've got to do. I sang and then
we had a series."
So when you get to hear stories like
these — about how pillars of
American consciousness came to
be — it suddenly becomes OK that this still
creative man can make one last round of
Brady bucks, thus reaffirming something
we could already tell by the cut of Greg's
shirt: that Americans, though well-meaning
and generally fun to play with, are inherent
ly tasteless.
Incidentally, of all 116, do you know
which is Schwartz's favorite episode of "The
Brady Bunch?"
"Actually, I like the Marcia Marcia Mar
cia episode best." ■

It is (albeit embarrassingly so) a little
nerve-racking to talk to Sherwood
Schwartz. Not that omivod, he's fatuous

and I'm just a fanboy kind of nervous
more like the fear you'd have if

speaking to a prophet
After all, he's sup
posed to be the

m an w ho
knows. He's
th e on e V
who made it
all up. Th e

Creator of our
pop-cultural
baseline. A na
tion's 78-year
old Gram pa
with a mo
nopoly on the
answers to the
great modern
mysteries:

Why did the
Howells pack so
many suitcases for a
three-hour tour?
What ever hap
pened to Carol's first
husband?

How come, after all that time on

the island, no one ever bonked?
Sherwood Schwartz: the creator, produc
er and writer of "The Brady Bunch," "Gilli
gan's Island" and their incessant theme
songs; the fortuitous perpetrator of family
values and the middle-class paradigm.
And now he's running the interview cir
cuit to talk up the latest re-re-revival of the
ne'er-to-die Brady clan.
"Actually, 1 don't have all the answers,"
says Schwartz. "The thing that always sur
prised me is just how much more all the fans
know about the episodes than 1 do. They'll
come up to me and say, 'Marcia Marcia
Marcia,' and I have to think about it."
More than that, he admits most of the
Bradvs' fame came as a surprise to him —
an accidental nerve hit by putting two coin
cidentally occurring pieces of information
together.
"I do recall what inspired the Bradys," he
tells as the drum roll starts beating. "It was
in the mid-'60s when I was looking in a
newspaper and 1 saw that 30 percent of all
marriages in America had a child by a for
mer marriage. I thought, 'Now that's some
statistic."'
One could hear the gears grinding.
"And then, a few days later, my daughter
