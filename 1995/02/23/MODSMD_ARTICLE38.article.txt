# AASA's foray into fashion

Turn to the left, turn to the right...
It don't matter what you wear, 'cause everyone has
their eyes on youuuuu
—RuPaul

fyy] lien I walked into the Asian-American
I A / Activities Center Monday night, I feasted my eyes
V r on a rare sight at Stanford: the bustle of a would-be
fashion show in the making.
Students, some swathed in gauze and evening elegance,
others in denim shorts and T-shirts, huddle in impromptu
conferences before counting out the beats to runway marches,
punctuating with fashion-y pivot turns and hip swings.
Though predominantly Asian females of relatively tall height,
the models are of various race and gender. Right before me, a
slender brown-skinned man whips through a vogue-ing rou
tine worthy of a Madonna protege . Meanwhile, committee
chairs and creative director-types perch on foldingchairs ready
to scrutinize les petits faux pas with critical eyes and sophomore
organizational zeal.
Work it, work it
But the coordinators of "Exposure: Unveiling the Asian
Mosaic" clearly have a firm belief in RuPaul's credo about fash
ion — that fashion is about finding the God within yourself.
"My opinion is that the show is a chance for others to come
and see Asian Americans succeed in non-traditional fields,"
says sophomore Su-Ping Lu, the show's co-chair. "It's a way to
show we're not just the studying types. We have style and atti
tude, and we can be sophisticated
"But not an exotic way," Lu hastens to add.
The show, which showcases fashions lent out from many
New York-based Asian-American designers and Bay Area
artist Kay Fujita, aims to exhibit the work of a less-visible com
munity in the high-profile world of fashion. And unfortunate
ly, the tension between stereotypes of traditional minority
roles and the desire to break out of these roles seems to be
somewhat self-perpetuating.
"You usually don't see Asian-Americans in a fashion show —
you usually see them in bioorchem labs," said sophomore Won
Park says the event is one of AASA's biggest and is expecting
In addition to lofty goals of altering images and stereotypes, the
ticket sales to the Asian Mental 1 lealth Center in San Francisco,
/ )on't hate me because I'm beautiful

Jung Park, one of the coordinators,
about 250 to 300 people to attend,
three-year old show is donating its
a very un-frou-frou-like cause.

The show's organization and artistry also
seem to he benefiting from additional years of ex
perience, an evolution from the days of scrambling
for participants and spontaneous choreographing
during the show. This year, Shen and the other co

ordinators were able to snag the expert choreo
graphic input of Stephanie Herman, a former dancer with
the Zurich Ballet and a lecturer in the dance division.
"Last year, the models made up a lot of their chore
ography," says senior Christopher Shen, the creative direc
tor. "It was kind of embarrassing."
"It was funny," 1 offer.
"We weren't trying to be funny."
I'm too sexy for myself, too sexy for myself, so sexy it
hurts
"No, we're not doing an artistic thing four days be
fore," protests Gina Yang, the show's PR chair, as several
models experiment with a white sheet and statue poses at
the behest of Shen.
"It's a creative thing," Shen ventures good-naturedly
before surrendering.
"At Stanford, it's hard to present fashion as some
thing serious," Shen admits. "So we are trying to emulate
more what fashion shows are. We're not trying to do a 'stu
dent show.' "
Despite the improvements made to make the pro
duction more professional, it's precisely this mix of amateur
sweat and designer expertise that appeals to me. I'm often
tempted to jeer at fashion for its iiber-sexy self-conception,
so nicely described in

that Right Said Fred
song. The student feel of
the AASA fashion show
keeps things at a di
gestible level.
Taken with a
grain of salt though, it's
still fun to see everyone

dolled up and moving choreographically en tnasseto the Village
People's "Go West."
And as I depart, I inevitably feel the rhythm of the mantra:
"Sashay, chante. Sashay, chante. Sashay, chante, sashay sashay
sashay...■
