## Focus on: Bagels 
### Chris Levinson 
Is this necessary? Bread is bread, right? i
beg to differ. Bread is the staff of life, the
stuff that dreams are made of, responsible
tor the establishment of kingdoms, and the
fall of empires. And you think I'm joking.
1 wanted to play fair. There would be no
seeds tlown in from the fields of Central
America, no rye plucked from the hands of
some unsuspecting Manhattanite. We're talk
ing just plain bagels here. Plain water bagels. I
went door to door, hitting all of the bagel es
tablishments in greater downtown Palo Alto
and demanding the best they had to offer.
Bagel Works ($.45)
642 Ramona Street
328-5429
Looks aren't everything. Where was the tell
tale hole? More of a scrunched dollop than
the classic disk shape, this one scored points
for originality. First bite... nice. The slight
crust surrounds the dough with just the right
amount of feistiness. Bagel baker Ken, guides
me through the process of boil then bake,

and follows me out the door with promises of
"no fat!" No threat of airiness here. The rea
son these bagels lacked that center hole is ex
plained after the first taste — this is one
dense bagel. But don't let that daunt you:
Bagel Works' final product proves to be a lit
tle nugget of goodness.
Holey Bagels ($.50)
117 Town and Country Village
327-2586
Picture this — it's 2 a.m. on a Tuesday night.
You've got work due tomorrow, but the
munchies are gnawing at you now. You head

for that open kitchen... and today's bagel
bag. You decide to risk it. But the bagel's skin
is something close to shoe leather, and tear
ing it in half requires more exertion than
you're willing to expend. So you attack with
bared fangs. Mistake. So are Holey Bagels.
Posh Bagels ($.55)
869 Santa Cruz Avenue
325-7674
Fresh out of the oven, this one defies gravity.
Known for its airiness, it usually leaves me
unsatisfied. But today, an hour or so after
baking, the density sets in. If you're the type

who orders air-popped over the real thing at
the movies, Posh is your place. For me, a
bagel is no rice cake, and I like mine dense, so
this place never thrills me. A similar-all-over
texture puts these at risk for being mistaken
for a dinner roll, but today that just-baked
bite remained. Nice surprise.
Safeway ($.39)
528 HI ("amino Real
324-2909
Yes, I did it so you wouldn't have to. Let's just
say I didn't swallow — enough said.
Noah's Bagels ($.50)
278 University Avenue
473-0751
I'm surprised. Noah's bagel doesn't hold up
well over time. The skin loses its firmness, the
flesh its texture. Sorry, but it's bland. That
tangy sweetness (possibly due to its higher fat
count — 3 to 5 grams per bagel) is gone.
Noah's, favored to win this taste test, has be
come just another bread product.
And the winner is...
House of Bagels ($.50)
220 Hamilton Avenue
323-8474
Perky. This is a perky bagel. This time, looks
are deceiving. What at first appeared to be a
bagel cut off at puberty, only slightly
browned, turns out to be, well, perfect. Not
lead, not light, but sitting comfortably in the
middle of bagel expectations. Crisp base,
comforting center. The stuff that ideal bagels
are made of.
And what about the other flavors, you ask?
As far as I'm concerned, you can keep your
jalapeiio, cranberry and blueberry variations
on a theme — just give me mine plain, toast
ed and once every day.
