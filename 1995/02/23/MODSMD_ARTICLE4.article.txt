### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Stanford's Class of 1995 will get the
kind of big-name send off that every se
nior desires.
William Perry, U.S. secretary of de
fense and a professor of engineering
economic systems at Stanford, will give
his remarks to Stanford's 104 th gradu
ating class on Sunday, June 18.
"He's delighted to be coming back as
the secretary of defense to address his
colleagues at the University," a
spokesperson for Perry said. "To ad
dress the University is quite an honor."
University President Gerhard
Casper selected the speaker from a list
submitted by the four Senior Class
presidents.
"Secretary Perry, both an alumnus
and a Stanford faculty member, holds
one of the most important and difficult
positions in our government," Casper
said in a statement.
"In his career, he always has man

aged to combine academic interests, es
pecially in international security and
arms control, with responsibilities in
government service and business," he
added.
Senior Class President Eric Chen
said he hoped the choice would cover a
theme that has not been addressed by
speakers in previous years.
"The area of international relations
is something that Stanford hasn't
talked about recently," Chen said.
Walter Falcon, who has worked with
Perry and is the director of the Insti
tute for International Studies, said he
was "absolutely delighted" with the
choice.
"I suspect he'll have interesting
things to say about combining learning
and public service," Falcon said. "He'll
have something useful to say â€” he al
ways does."
While many past speakers have been
criticized for not being famous enough,
the Senior Class presidents said they
hope this year's choice will be accepted

more positively.
"I think in terms of a name, which is
what people seem to want, I don't think
