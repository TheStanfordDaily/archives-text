# Secretary of Defense Perry to be '95 graduation speaker
## 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Stanford's Class of 1995 will get the
kind of big-name send off that every se
nior desires.
William Perry, U.S. secretary of de
fense and a professor of engineering
economic systems at Stanford, will give
his remarks to Stanford's 104 th gradu
ating class on Sunday, June 18.
"He's delighted to be coming back as
the secretary of defense to address his
colleagues at the University," a
spokesperson for Perry said. "To ad
dress the University is quite an honor."
University President Gerhard
Casper selected the speaker from a list
submitted by the four Senior Class
presidents.
"Secretary Perry, both an alumnus
and a Stanford faculty member, holds
one of the most important and difficult
positions in our government," Casper
said in a statement.
"In his career, he always has man

aged to combine academic interests, es
pecially in international security and
arms control, with responsibilities in
government service and business," he
added.
Senior Class President Eric Chen
said he hoped the choice would cover a
theme that has not been addressed by
speakers in previous years.
"The area of international relations
is something that Stanford hasn't
talked about recently," Chen said.
Walter Falcon, who has worked with
Perry and is the director of the Insti
tute for International Studies, said he
was "absolutely delighted" with the
choice.
"I suspect he'll have interesting
things to say about combining learning
and public service," Falcon said. "He'll
have something useful to say — he al
ways does."
While many past speakers have been
criticized for not being famous enough,
the Senior Class presidents said they
hope this year's choice will be accepted

more positively.
"I think in terms of a name, which is
what people seem to want, I don't think


William Perry
you're going to fmd a bigger name
in government who's a Stanford
alumnus," said Senior Class Presi
dent Sarah-Marie Martin.
"A lot of people that we thought
would be quality speakers were not
big-name people," she added. "Peo
ple were so flustered that there was
not a big name (in previous years).
In our list we had names that we
thought were recognizable."
The choice was also restricted by
Casper to a person who had a Stan
ford connection, the class presi
dents said.
Casper "set criteria that there
had to be some sort of connection to
Stanford — more than just wearing
a Stanford cap in a magazine,"
Chen said. "We didn't put Colin
Powell or President Clinton on the
list because we knew that [Casperl
had his own reservations about peo
ple who didn't have a tie to Stan
ford."
Despite the restriction, the class
presidents said having a speaker
connected to Stanford did not
greatly constrict their choices.
"There are a lot of people that
have a Stanford connection,"
Senior Class President Paula
Strange Dybdahl said. "We came up
with so many spectacular names —
I don't think it was limiting at all."
Even though the short list of
choices contained 10 names, Martin
said that Casper was "intent on
having I Perry]" as the speaker.
Martin said that Perry was
ranked high on the list. "Not our
first choice, but he was high," she
added.
The class presidents would not
disclose the other names on their
short list, but Martin said the oth
ers were "business people, profes
sors and university presidents."
Senior Aaron Bilstrom said he

"will be interested to hear what
[Perry] has to say to inspire us ...
they always make a speech about
how you can contribute to America
and the world."
Perry was named secretary of
defense Feb. 3, 1994, ending the
eight-week search for a replace
ment to outgoing secretary Les
Aspin.
Before being named to the top
position at the Department of
Defense, Perry served as deputy
secretary under Aspin for 11
months.
He received two degrees from
Stanford — a bachelor's in 1949
and a master's in 1950, both in
mathematics. He then went on to
complete his Ph.D. work at Penn
sylvania State University, in his
home state.
Perry was founder of ESL Inc., a
maker of devices used by the Pen
tagon for electronic listening, code
breaking and surveillance. During
this time, Perry also served as tech
nological consultant for the Depart
ment of Defense.
After President Jimmy Carter
appointed him undersecretary of
defense for research and engineer
ing in the 19705, Perry sold the
shares of his company, making him
a multi-millionaire.
At the Pentagon, Perry was
instrumental in developing the
radar-evading stealth bomber and
fighter, as well as the laser-guided
missile technologies used to great
effect in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
After Carter's presidential
defeat in 1980, Perry returned to
the Bay area as managing director
of Hambrecht and Quist, an invest
ment banking firm specializing in
high technology.
Perry went on to found Technol
ogy Strategies and Alliances, a
Menlo Park-based technology con
sulting and investment firm. From
1989 to 1993, Perry served as direc
tor of Stanford's Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control.
