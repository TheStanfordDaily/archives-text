# Channeling life through a white

When MTV called
Sub Pop and
asked for some
one from an alternative band
who wrote a lot of songs
about break-ups and heart
break, Sebadoh's Lou Barlow
was the obvious choice. For
nearly a decade now, Barlow
and his bandmates have con
tinually jumped from folk to
pop to punk, tinkering with
their own tense emotional
circuitry while generating
some of the most personal
and powerful rock music to
grace the indie scene in
years.
MTV was looking for a hip
and sensitive musician to
speak on their 1994 "Sex In
the '90s" program, and Bar
low obliged, mainly because
Sub Pop set it up and they
were going to fly him down to
New York with his girlfriend.
If you saw the show, you may
remember Barlow wearing a
Joy Division T-shirt, sitting
on a stool and talking about
his personal life in front of the
whole world.
But Barlow seems comfort
able sharing his personal life
with everyone, since that's a
big part of what he does with
Sebadoh, as well as with his
solo acoustic band Sentridoh
and other side projects. After
listening to a few Sebadoh al
bums, you almost feel like you
know Lou Barlow. But you re
ally don't.
During the course of our
recent phone interview, I
spoke with Barlow about his
music, his life and his posi
tion as an underground hero
on the verge of a break
through. He was mellow and
intelligent, a down-to-earth
and pleasant guy who seemed
miles away from the high
strung and super-sensitive
reputation that he's gained
over the years.
After all, it's this reputation
that got him the spot on
MTV's "Sex In the '905." Bar
low seems mildly annoyed
with this reputation as a sort
of indie-rock Woody Allen,
but he doesn't take the time to
worry about it. "It's a little bit
one-dimensional and stupid;
but MTV's a little one-dimen
sional and stupid," he says
with a laugh.

Naked and loose
The cover of Sebadoh's latest album
"Bakesale" is an old photograph of a one
year-old Lou Barlow staring deep into a toilet
bowl at his parents' house. "I think every
body has a sort of embarrassing nude photo
graph of them as a baby that their mom took
at some point," Barlow says."And that's defi
nitely mine." It seems a fitting cover for an
album that blends the band's naked honesty
and bleak emotional exploration with their
subtle sense of humor and good fun.
"Bakesale" is the band's most direct and
accessible release to date, as Barlow's songs
are nicely complemented by the songs of Se
badoh's other main songwriter, bass player
Jason Loewenstein. The two writing styles are
compatible but not identical, making for a
consistent but colorful listen. New drummer
Bob Fay also contributes a track, rounding
out the band's laid-back and democratic ap
proach to making albums.
"We're starting to really lock into a sound,
like a certain groove that we're good at," Bar
low says."I guess before we always were just
fucking around with so many different things
that we never really bothered to get a sound."
Describing Sebadoh's sound is a difficult
task, but Barlow gives a loosely insightful at
tempt. "It's folk rock, but there's still a lot of
punk aggression, and we just kind of swing
between them." he says. "Kind of jangly, kind
of heavy in spots, distorted, nice singing,
screaming, all that stuff. It's like life, sort of
channeled through a white folk rock band."
Barlow's lyrics ooze with honesty and cu
riosity, as he has a knack for dissecting rela
tionships with a straightforward edginess
that leaves you knotted-up and intrigued. On
"Together or Alone," Barlow sings: "It was
never my intention/ to blindly feed the boy
girl game/1 know romance isn't everything/
But I'm obsessing just the same/ Because
today I don't feel worthy/ You seem so beau
tiful and strong/ These unsure hands could
never soothe you/ Too afraid of doing some
thing wrong."
Barlow's music is direct and real, commu
nicating on a thoughtfully personal level that
most musicians would be unable and unwill
ing to match. "It's an instinct," Barlow says."I
don't really see it as having a choice, really.
What else would I do but write what I feel?
"I think the music definitely shows that I
at least try to understand things," he says.
"And that's definitely a big part of my person
ality."
Fantastic disaster
Before Sebadoh, Barlow was in a number
of bands, most notably Dinosaur Jr. which he
and J. Mascis founded in 1985. Barlow played
bass and sang occasionally until he was
kicked out of the band in 1989. But by that
time he was already collaborating with origi
nal percussionist Eric Gaffney in the early
stages of Sebadoh. Barlow's experience with
Dinosaur Jr. was a frustrating one, but one

that was essential to his creative success with
Sebadoh.
"(Dinosaur Jr.) was the most one-dimen
sional, uncreative thing that I could have
done, but it was really good for me in a lot of
ways," he says. "Dinosaur just gave me a real
jump on the game. When I came back it was
Sebadoh, and I knew exactly what I didn't
want to do. 1 didn't know what I wanted to

do, but I knew what I
didn't want to do. And

thats more impor
tant I think, to
know what you
don't want. Be-

cause if you know
what you want,
then you can be kind
of a dick, and your

music can be kind of
one-dimensional. But if
you know what you don't

want, you can let it evolve,
and it's a little more open."
Sebadoh's music has

evolved freely over the
years, drifting from
genre to genre, some-

times gracefully, some
times abrasively. "We
just let things fall into
place or fall out of

I
place," he says. "There's
not a lot of control

happening."
In the beginning
the band was just Bar-

low and Gaffney,
putting together
rough, four-track

recordings that
boasted Barlow's
trademark vision
and honesty be
neath all its fuzz and j
hiss. Barlow and!
Gaffney's acoustic!
collaborations 1

grew more aggres
sive and ambi
tious, and with
addition of
Loewenstein,
they developed
the experimental
semi-acoustic
folk-punk sound
that decorated
much of the

band's classic
"III" release
on the indie
label Home
stead.
Not long
after the release

of "III," the
band signed with Sub Pop, where

they would
later re
1 e a s e ,
"Bub- j
bleand

Scrape," a mostly electric work which

showcased Barlow's, Loewenstein's
and Gaffney's dramatically

unique writing styles. "Bub
ble and Scrape" brought

Sebadoh modest success,
but the following year

/ â€”
Gaffney quit the band

and was replaced
by long-time

fill-in
Bob
Fay.

Gaffney was the source of much of Se
badoh's more eccentric and occasionally
downright frightening material, so his ab
sence inevitably gives the newer Sebadoh
material a smoother, more straightforward
feel. But the band is still far from your stan
dard alternative three-piece.
License to confuse
Sebadoh has come to be known as a par
ticularly unstable live band. Barlow hesi
tates to call their shows unpredictable, but
he admits that they can be pretty odd. He
goes on to describe the previous night's
show in New Orleans: "We had this guy
Mike play for us who sells T-shirts for us and
is generally a really good friend. We all got
really, really drunk.... We ended up play
ing a really weird set. Short and very weird,
and Mike walked around in his underwear
and sold paper plates that said 'Sebadoh' on
them for 25 cents a piece. So that was kind of
weird."
On other occasions, Barlow admits to
shows becoming hostile at times. "Some
times I'll get really defensive when we play
live, like I'll just think that everybody thinks
that we suck," he says. "Instead of dealing
with that in a rational way, I'll just get defen
sive and mean or angry or I'll just start pro
voking. Or if there's one person in the audi
ence who's trying to provoke me, I'll focus
on that person rather than focus on the 99
percent of the people who just want to sit
there and listen to us play. But I'm doing that
a lot less lately."
In general, Barlow says he's pleased with
the band's current tour. More and more peo
ple attend the shows, and so Sebadoh's pop
ularity steadily climbs.
"Every album we've put out is kind of a
step forward in a certain way," he says.
"We've been at it long enough and we have
sort of a buzz about u5.... I think we're no
torious enough that people will actually give
us a closer listen. And maybe they'll look a
little bit beyond what people who program
commercial alternative radio would consid
er a good production."
Barlow doubts that the band will be
come mainstream superstars any time in
* the near future, but he does enjoy seeing
If his music reach wider audiences. "I want
to have a life, you know, and I want to be
M successful," he says."And I want more
and more people to listen to my music."
Sebadoh's current single "Re
bound" has actually been enjoying
V modest radio exposure on many of the
same stations that deliver all that Green
Day, Counting Crows and Stone Tem
ple Pilots. Life on the fringe of main
stream pop might take some getting
used to, but Barlow seems willing to ad
just.
"We've just been playing for so long, and
it's all kind of a joke to us, like kind of a good
joke," he says about the band's increasing
success. "There could easily be some point
when I totally flip out on it. In fact I don't

doubt it. I'm sure I will, but
it's all part of learning how to
deal with it."
Barlow doesn't fear popu
larity as many of his indie
peers seem to. "I never really
feel like we're the flavor of
the month," he says."I feel
that anyone who really pur
sues our music gets really
into it, and really sees the
emotional aspects of it, as
opposed to just 'This sounds
good when I'm partying.' "
With any band's rise to
mainstream success come
cries of "sell-out," but Bar
low calmly anticipates and
dismisses these claims.
% "There are a lot of examples
of people who sell a lot of
records and the music has
no integrity at all," Barlow
says. "But as far as I'm con
cerned the smallest indie
rock bands sell out their in
tegrity in their own way."
"It all just comes down to
music and whether you like it
or not, or whether the con
nection is made or not
made," Barlow says. "If you
end up making a connection
with thousands of people, or
even millions, if you are real
ly making a connection with
them, I don't see any prob
lem with that."
The nakedly frank ap
proach of Sebadoh's music is
both chilling and warm, as
the band's stark emotional
excavation creates a psycho
logically cleansing listening
experience.
Interestingly enough,
if Barlow weren't
with Sebadoh, he says
that he'd probably be a
nurse, because he likes the
feeling he gets from helping
people. "That's what I did
when I had to work," he
says."I worked health care
because you get this real
tangible sense of what
you're doing."
When Barlow considers
some of the positive feed
back he's received from fans
who have found comfort in
his work, he sees his job with
Sebadoh as just as good. "It's
strangely similar," he says.
"But the good thing is I'm
not working weird shifts and
I'm not cleaning any bed
pans." â–

Sebadoh modest success,
but the following year

/ â€”
Gaffney quit the band

and was replaced
by long-time

fill-in
Bob
Fay.

Gaffney was the source of much of Se
badoh's more eccentric and occasionally
downright frightening material, so his ab
sence inevitably gives the newer Sebadoh
material a smoother, more straightforward
feel. But the band is still far from your stan
dard alternative three-piece.
License to confuse
Sebadoh has come to be known as a par
ticularly unstable live band. Barlow hesi
tates to call their shows unpredictable, but
he admits that they can be pretty odd. He
goes on to describe the previous night's
show in New Orleans: "We had this guy
Mike play for us who sells T-shirts for us and
is generally a really good friend. We all got
really, really drunk.... We ended up play
ing a really weird set. Short and very weird,
and Mike walked around in his underwear
and sold paper plates that said 'Sebadoh' on
them for 25 cents a piece. So that was kind of
weird."
On other occasions, Barlow admits to
shows becoming hostile at times. "Some
times I'll get really defensive when we play
live, like I'll just think that everybody thinks
that we suck," he says. "Instead of dealing
with that in a rational way, I'll just get defen
sive and mean or angry or I'll just start pro
voking. Or if there's one person in the audi
ence who's trying to provoke me, I'll focus
on that person rather than focus on the 99
percent of the people who just want to sit
there and listen to us play. But I'm doing that
a lot less lately."
In general, Barlow says he's pleased with
the band's current tour. More and more peo
ple attend the shows, and so Sebadoh's pop
ularity steadily climbs.
"Every album we've put out is kind of a
step forward in a certain way," he says.
"We've been at it long enough and we have
sort of a buzz about u5.... I think we're no
torious enough that people will actually give
us a closer listen. And maybe they'll look a
little bit beyond what people who program
commercial alternative radio would consid
er a good production."
Barlow doubts that the band will be
come mainstream superstars any time in
* the near future, but he does enjoy seeing
If his music reach wider audiences. "I want
to have a life, you know, and I want to be
M successful," he says."And I want more
and more people to listen to my music."
Sebadoh's current single "Re
bound" has actually been enjoying
V modest radio exposure on many of the
same stations that deliver all that Green
Day, Counting Crows and Stone Tem
ple Pilots. Life on the fringe of main
stream pop might take some getting
used to, but Barlow seems willing to ad
just.
"We've just been playing for so long, and
it's all kind of a joke to us, like kind of a good
joke," he says about the band's increasing
success. "There could easily be some point
when I totally flip out on it. In fact I don't

doubt it. I'm sure I will, but
it's all part of learning how to
deal with it."
Barlow doesn't fear popu
larity as many of his indie
peers seem to. "I never really
feel like we're the flavor of
the month," he says."I feel
that anyone who really pur
sues our music gets really
into it, and really sees the
emotional aspects of it, as
opposed to just 'This sounds
good when I'm partying.' "
With any band's rise to
mainstream success come
cries of "sell-out," but Bar
low calmly anticipates and
dismisses these claims.
% "There are a lot of examples
of people who sell a lot of
records and the music has
no integrity at all," Barlow
says. "But as far as I'm con
cerned the smallest indie
rock bands sell out their in
tegrity in their own way."
"It all just comes down to
music and whether you like it
or not, or whether the con
nection is made or not
made," Barlow says. "If you
end up making a connection
with thousands of people, or
even millions, if you are real
ly making a connection with
them, I don't see any prob
lem with that."
The nakedly frank ap
proach of Sebadoh's music is
both chilling and warm, as
the band's stark emotional
excavation creates a psycho
logically cleansing listening
experience.
Interestingly enough,
if Barlow weren't
with Sebadoh, he says
that he'd probably be a
nurse, because he likes the
feeling he gets from helping
people. "That's what I did
when I had to work," he
says."I worked health care
because you get this real
tangible sense of what
you're doing."
When Barlow considers
some of the positive feed
back he's received from fans
who have found comfort in
his work, he sees his job with
Sebadoh as just as good. "It's
strangely similar," he says.
"But the good thing is I'm
not working weird shifts and
I'm not cleaning any bed
pans." â–

When MTV called
Sub Pop and
asked for some
one from an alternative band
who wrote a lot of songs
about break-ups and heart
break, Sebadoh's Lou Barlow
was the obvious choice. For
nearly a decade now, Barlow
and his bandmates have con
tinually jumped from folk to
pop to punk, tinkering with
their own tense emotional
circuitry while generating
some of the most personal
and powerful rock music to
grace the indie scene in
years.
MTV was looking for a hip
and sensitive musician to
speak on their 1994 "Sex In
the '90s" program, and Bar
low obliged, mainly because
Sub Pop set it up and they
were going to fly him down to
New York with his girlfriend.
If you saw the show, you may
remember Barlow wearing a
Joy Division T-shirt, sitting
on a stool and talking about
his personal life in front of the
whole world.
But Barlow seems comfort
able sharing his personal life
with everyone, since that's a
big part of what he does with
Sebadoh, as well as with his
solo acoustic band Sentridoh
and other side projects. After
listening to a few Sebadoh al
bums, you almost feel like you
know Lou Barlow. But you re
ally don't.
During the course of our
recent phone interview, I
spoke with Barlow about his
music, his life and his posi
tion as an underground hero
on the verge of a break
through. He was mellow and
intelligent, a down-to-earth
and pleasant guy who seemed
miles away from the high
strung and super-sensitive
reputation that he's gained
over the years.
After all, it's this reputation
that got him the spot on
MTV's "Sex In the '905." Bar
low seems mildly annoyed
with this reputation as a sort
of indie-rock Woody Allen,
but he doesn't take the time to
worry about it. "It's a little bit
one-dimensional and stupid;
but MTV's a little one-dimen
sional and stupid," he says
with a laugh.

Naked and loose
The cover of Sebadoh's latest album
"Bakesale" is an old photograph of a one
year-old Lou Barlow staring deep into a toilet
bowl at his parents' house. "I think every
body has a sort of embarrassing nude photo
graph of them as a baby that their mom took
at some point," Barlow says."And that's defi
nitely mine." It seems a fitting cover for an
album that blends the band's naked honesty
and bleak emotional exploration with their
subtle sense of humor and good fun.
"Bakesale" is the band's most direct and
accessible release to date, as Barlow's songs
are nicely complemented by the songs of Se
badoh's other main songwriter, bass player
Jason Loewenstein. The two writing styles are
compatible but not identical, making for a
consistent but colorful listen. New drummer
Bob Fay also contributes a track, rounding
out the band's laid-back and democratic ap
proach to making albums.
"We're starting to really lock into a sound,
like a certain groove that we're good at," Bar
low says."I guess before we always were just
fucking around with so many different things
that we never really bothered to get a sound."
Describing Sebadoh's sound is a difficult
task, but Barlow gives a loosely insightful at
tempt. "It's folk rock, but there's still a lot of
punk aggression, and we just kind of swing
between them." he says. "Kind of jangly, kind
of heavy in spots, distorted, nice singing,
screaming, all that stuff. It's like life, sort of
channeled through a white folk rock band."
Barlow's lyrics ooze with honesty and cu
riosity, as he has a knack for dissecting rela
tionships with a straightforward edginess
that leaves you knotted-up and intrigued. On
"Together or Alone," Barlow sings: "It was
never my intention/ to blindly feed the boy
girl game/1 know romance isn't everything/
But I'm obsessing just the same/ Because
today I don't feel worthy/ You seem so beau
tiful and strong/ These unsure hands could
never soothe you/ Too afraid of doing some
thing wrong."
Barlow's music is direct and real, commu
nicating on a thoughtfully personal level that
most musicians would be unable and unwill
ing to match. "It's an instinct," Barlow says."I
don't really see it as having a choice, really.
What else would I do but write what I feel?
"I think the music definitely shows that I
at least try to understand things," he says.
"And that's definitely a big part of my person
ality."
Fantastic disaster
Before Sebadoh, Barlow was in a number
of bands, most notably Dinosaur Jr. which he
and J. Mascis founded in 1985. Barlow played
bass and sang occasionally until he was
kicked out of the band in 1989. But by that
time he was already collaborating with origi
nal percussionist Eric Gaffney in the early
stages of Sebadoh. Barlow's experience with
Dinosaur Jr. was a frustrating one, but one

that was essential to his creative success with
Sebadoh.
"(Dinosaur Jr.) was the most one-dimen
sional, uncreative thing that I could have
done, but it was really good for me in a lot of
ways," he says. "Dinosaur just gave me a real
jump on the game. When I came back it was
Sebadoh, and I knew exactly what I didn't
want to do. 1 didn't know what I wanted to

do, but I knew what I
didn't want to do. And

thats more impor
tant I think, to
know what you
don't want. Be-

cause if you know
what you want,
then you can be kind
of a dick, and your

music can be kind of

evolved freely over the
years, drifting from

times gracefully, some
times abrasively. "We

nection is made or not
made," Barlow says. "If you
end up making a connection
with thousands of people, or
even millions, if you are real
ly making a connection with
them, I don't see any prob
lem with that."
The nakedly frank ap
proach of Sebadoh's music is
both chilling and warm, as
the band's stark emotional
excavation creates a psycho
logically cleansing listening
experience.
Interestingly enough,
if Barlow weren't
with Sebadoh, he says
that he'd probably be a
nurse, because he likes the
feeling he gets from helping
people. "That's what I did
when I had to work," he
says."I worked health care
because you get this real
tangible sense of what
you're doing."
When Barlow considers
some of the positive feed
back he's received from fans
who have found comfort in
his work, he sees his job with
Sebadoh as just as good. "It's
strangely similar," he says.
"But the good thing is I'm
not working weird shifts and
I'm not cleaning any bed
pans." â–

When MTV called
Sub Pop and
asked for some
one from an alternative band
who wrote a lot of songs
about break-ups and heart
break, Sebadoh's Lou Barlow
was the obvious choice. For
nearly a decade now, Barlow
and his bandmates have con
tinually jumped from folk to
pop to punk, tinkering with
their own tense emotional
circuitry while generating
some of the most personal
and powerful rock music to
grace the indie scene in
years.
MTV was looking for a hip
and sensitive musician to
speak on their 1994 "Sex In
the '90s" program, and Bar
low obliged, mainly because
Sub Pop set it up and they
were going to fly him down to
New York with his girlfriend.
If you saw the show, you may
remember Barlow wearing a
Joy Division T-shirt, sitting
on a stool and talking about
his personal life in front of the
whole world.
But Barlow seems comfort
able sharing his personal life
with everyone, since that's a
big part of what he does with
Sebadoh, as well as with his
solo acoustic band Sentridoh
and other side projects. After
listening to a few Sebadoh al
bums, you almost feel like you
know Lou Barlow. But you re
ally don't.
During the course of our
recent phone interview, I
spoke with Barlow about his
music, his life and his posi
tion as an underground hero
on the verge of a break
through. He was mellow and
intelligent, a down-to-earth
and pleasant guy who seemed
miles away from the high
strung and super-sensitive
reputation that he's gained
over the years.
After all, it's this reputation
that got him the spot on
MTV's "Sex In the '905." Bar
low seems mildly annoyed
with this reputation as a sort
of indie-rock Woody Allen,
but he doesn't take the time to
worry about it. "It's a little bit
one-dimensional and stupid;
but MTV's a little one-dimen
sional and stupid," he says
with a laugh.

Naked and loose
The cover of Sebadoh's latest album
"Bakesale" is an old photograph of a one
year-old Lou Barlow staring deep into a toilet
bowl at his parents' house. "I think every
body has a sort of embarrassing nude photo
graph of them as a baby that their mom took
at some point," Barlow says."And that's defi
nitely mine." It seems a fitting cover for an
album that blends the band's naked honesty
and bleak emotional exploration with their
subtle sense of humor and good fun.
"Bakesale" is the band's most direct and
accessible release to date, as Barlow's songs
are nicely complemented by the songs of Se
badoh's other main songwriter, bass player
Jason Loewenstein. The two writing styles are
compatible but not identical, making for a
consistent but colorful listen. New drummer
Bob Fay also contributes a track, rounding
out the band's laid-back and democratic ap
proach to making albums.
"We're starting to really lock into a sound,
like a certain groove that we're good at," Bar
low says."I guess before we always were just
fucking around with so many different things
that we never really bothered to get a sound."
Describing Sebadoh's sound is a difficult
task, but Barlow gives a loosely insightful at
tempt. "It's folk rock, but there's still a lot of
punk aggression, and we just kind of swing
between them." he says. "Kind of jangly, kind
of heavy in spots, distorted, nice singing,
screaming, all that stuff. It's like life, sort of
channeled through a white folk rock band."
Barlow's lyrics ooze with honesty and cu
riosity, as he has a knack for dissecting rela
tionships with a straightforward edginess
that leaves you knotted-up and intrigued. On
"Together or Alone," Barlow sings: "It was
never my intention/ to blindly feed the boy
girl game/1 know romance isn't everything/
But I'm obsessing just the same/ Because
today I don't feel worthy/ You seem so beau
tiful and strong/ These unsure hands could
never soothe you/ Too afraid of doing some
thing wrong."
Barlow's music is direct and real, commu
nicating on a thoughtfully personal level that
most musicians would be unable and unwill
ing to match. "It's an instinct," Barlow says."I
don't really see it as having a choice, really.
What else would I do but write what I feel?
"I think the music definitely shows that I
at least try to understand things," he says.
"And that's definitely a big part of my person
ality."
Fantastic disaster
Before Sebadoh, Barlow was in a number
of bands, most notably Dinosaur Jr. which he
and J. Mascis founded in 1985. Barlow played
bass and sang occasionally until he was
kicked out of the band in 1989. But by that
time he was already collaborating with origi
nal percussionist Eric Gaffney in the early
stages of Sebadoh. Barlow's experience with
Dinosaur Jr. was a frustrating one, but one

that was essential to his creative success with
Sebadoh.
"(Dinosaur Jr.) was the most one-dimen
sional, uncreative thing that I could have
done, but it was really good for me in a lot of
ways," he says. "Dinosaur just gave me a real
jump on the game. When I came back it was
Sebadoh, and I knew exactly what I didn't
want to do. 1 didn't know what I wanted to

do, but I knew what I
didn't want to do. And

thats more impor
tant I think, to
know what you
don't want. Be-

cause if you know
what you want,
then you can be kind
of a dick, and your

music can be kind of
one-dimensional. But if
you know what you don't

want, you can let it evolve,
and it's a little more open."
Sebadoh's music has

evolved freely over the
years, drifting from
genre to genre, some-

times gracefully, some
times abrasively. "We
just let things fall into
place or fall out of

I
place," he says. "There's
not a lot of control

happening."
In the beginning
the band was just Bar-

low and Gaffney,
putting together
rough, four-track

recordings that
boasted Barlow's
trademark vision
and honesty be
neath all its fuzz and j
hiss. Barlow and!
Gaffney's acoustic!
collaborations 1

grew more aggres
sive and ambi
tious, and with
addition of
Loewenstein,
they developed
the experimental
semi-acoustic
folk-punk sound
that decorated
much of the

band's classic
"III" release
on the indie
label Home
stead.
Not long
after the release

of "III," the
band signed with Sub Pop, where

they would
later re
1 e a s e ,
"Bub- j
bleand

Scrape," a mostly electric work which

showcased Barlow's, Loewenstein's
and Gaffney's dramatically

unique writing styles. "Bub
ble and Scrape" brought

Sebadoh modest success,
but the following year

/ â€”
Gaffney quit the band

and was replaced
by long-time

fill-in
Bob
Fay.

Gaffney was the source of much of Se
badoh's more eccentric and occasionally
downright frightening material, so his ab
sence inevitably gives the newer Sebadoh
material a smoother, more straightforward
feel. But the band is still far from your stan
dard alternative three-piece.
License to confuse
Sebadoh has come to be known as a par
ticularly unstable live band. Barlow hesi
tates to call their shows unpredictable, but
he admits that they can be pretty odd. He
goes on to describe the previous night's
show in New Orleans: "We had this guy
Mike play for us who sells T-shirts for us and
is generally a really good friend. We all got
really, really drunk.... We ended up play
ing a really weird set. Short and very weird,
and Mike walked around in his underwear
and sold paper plates that said 'Sebadoh' on
them for 25 cents a piece. So that was kind of
weird."
On other occasions, Barlow admits to
shows becoming hostile at times. "Some
times I'll get really defensive when we play
live, like I'll just think that everybody thinks
that we suck," he says. "Instead of dealing
with that in a rational way, I'll just get defen
sive and mean or angry or I'll just start pro
voking. Or if there's one person in the audi
ence who's trying to provoke me, I'll focus
on that person rather than focus on the 99
percent of the people who just want to sit
there and listen to us play. But I'm doing that
a lot less lately."
In general, Barlow says he's pleased with
the band's current tour. More and more peo
ple attend the shows, and so Sebadoh's pop
ularity steadily climbs.
"Every album we've put out is kind of a
step forward in a certain way," he says.
"We've been at it long enough and we have
sort of a buzz about u5.... I think we're no
torious enough that people will actually give
us a closer listen. And maybe they'll look a
little bit beyond what people who program
commercial alternative radio would consid
er a good production."
Barlow doubts that the band will be
come mainstream superstars any time in
* the near future, but he does enjoy seeing
If his music reach wider audiences. "I want
to have a life, you know, and I want to be
M successful," he says."And I want more
and more people to listen to my music."
Sebadoh's current single "Re
bound" has actually been enjoying
V modest radio exposure on many of the
same stations that deliver all that Green
Day, Counting Crows and Stone Tem
ple Pilots. Life on the fringe of main
stream pop might take some getting
used to, but Barlow seems willing to ad
just.
"We've just been playing for so long, and
it's all kind of a joke to us, like kind of a good
joke," he says about the band's increasing
success. "There could easily be some point
when I totally flip out on it. In fact I don't

doubt it. I'm sure I will, but
it's all part of learning how to
deal with it."
Barlow doesn't fear popu
larity as many of his indie
peers seem to. "I never really
feel like we're the flavor of
the month," he says."I feel
that anyone who really pur
sues our music gets really
into it, and really sees the
emotional aspects of it, as
opposed to just 'This sounds
good when I'm partying.' "
With any band's rise to
mainstream success come
cries of "sell-out," but Bar
low calmly anticipates and
dismisses these claims.
% "There are a lot of examples
of people who sell a lot of
records and the music has
no integrity at all," Barlow
says. "But as far as I'm con
cerned the smallest indie
rock bands sell out their in
tegrity in their own way."
"It all just comes down to
music and whether you like it
or not, or whether the con
nection is made or not
made," Barlow says. "If you
end up making a connection
with thousands of people, or
even millions, if you are real
ly making a connection with
them, I don't see any prob
lem with that."
The nakedly frank ap
proach of Sebadoh's music is
both chilling and warm, as
the band's stark emotional
excavation creates a psycho
logically cleansing listening
experience.
Interestingly enough,
if Barlow weren't
with Sebadoh, he says
that he'd probably be a
nurse, because he likes the
feeling he gets from helping
people. "That's what I did
when I had to work," he
says."I worked health care
because you get this real
tangible sense of what
you're doing."
When Barlow considers
some of the positive feed
back he's received from fans
who have found comfort in
his work, he sees his job with
Sebadoh as just as good. "It's
strangely similar," he says.
"But the good thing is I'm
not working weird shifts and
I'm not cleaning any bed
pans." â–
