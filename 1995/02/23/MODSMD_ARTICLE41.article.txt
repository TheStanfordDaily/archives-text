# Guitars snarling into ecstasy

While other indie-land talents are mov
ing up to the big leagues with leaner and
cleaner sounds, the Portland trio Pond is
paving its own way by becoming messier and
meaner. And the band's new album, "The
Practice ol Joy Before Death,' argues the
case: The record is a staggering collection ot
off-key, off-balance cuts that's a clever twist
on the slack mother tucker formula.

"The Practice of Joy Before
Death"

Pond

Compared to the structured mayhem of
the group's promising 1993 self-titled
debut, Pond roams freely this time out, let
ting the music guide the pace rather than
the other way around. It is stream-of-con
sciousness power pop unburdened by form
or context. The fuzzy production doesn't
hurt either, giving the piece a feel that
works well for Pond's jerky, murky rock.

The guitars do the damage for Pond, slic
ing and dicing with speedy tempos, whin
ing and weaving at slower moments.
Singer/guitarist Charlie Campbell pulls off
some neat tricks on the album, slipping in
and out of guitar identities between and
within songs. What s a wall o minor-chord
crunch at one instant turns into a twangy
taste ol sitae music at the next, which is then
followed by a one-man guitar duel. On
songs like "Mubby" and "Van," Campbell's
instrument speaks better than the vocals,
hitting the right tones at the right time.
With such standout guitar effects, it's
easy to lose track of lead-heavy beats
bounced out by singer/bassist Chris Brady
and drummer Dave Triebwasser. The
rhythm section lays down a solid founda
tion from which to build, nailing down the
songs as the guitar lines blister and splinter
on top.
If there's a weak link, it's the vocals.
Brady's and Campbell's voices alternate
from sounding nasal to monotonous,
which would probably be more annoying if
it didn't fit so well in the mix. The droning,
out of tune singing works well as a part of
the whole — just don't expect to under
stand it. Case in point: the muddled, dis
torted screams which make up the vox on
"Carpenter Ant" don't seem to mean much,

but they get their mess(age)
across between the coiling blasts
of guitar. After all, musical ex
pression goes beyond pretty
voices and nicely packaged
forms. Maybe that's what Pond is
good for.
