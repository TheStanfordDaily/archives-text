# Zbigniew Preisner's Red' soundtrack radiates a subtle and sublime grace
##

Alpha: If outside of good acting and good
directing there is one other element that can
improve a film, it is the music. Soundtracks
arc an art in their own right: Either they are se
lected pieces of music (Kubrick always has the
most magnificent choices for his films), or
they are originally composed for the direc
tor/film by a team composer (Fellini and Nino

"Red"
Zbigniew Preisner

Rota are the best known team).
Beta: Directors can use music to manipu
late their audience, to tell them how to feel,
when to cry, when to laugh or when to get ex
cited. (Steven Spielberg is the greatest of
fender in this area. All his films contain mu
sical manipulation of the audience: now feel
thrilled, now sad, now I command you to
cry.) Music, in other words, can be very easi
ly used to cheat, without the audience ever
recognizing it.
Now comes "Red" (known as "Rouge" in
its native country, France), a film that has at
tracted little attention despite its genius.
"Red" remained, and still remains, in the
background, unjustly so in my opinion.
"Red" is the best film of the past two years.
The soundtrack to "Red" wins. And it

wins by playing a fair game. It refuses to
cheat. All the movie's elements come togeth
er perfectly: the color, the dialogue, the di
recting, the cinematography. Yet, above all
the elements, the music stands out. It adds
the necessary element of grace.
The music is part of what makes the film
work. Moreover, independent of the film, the
soundtrack stands on its own as a monu
ment. Fourteen of the 16 tracks were com
posed by Zbigniew Preisner; the other two
operatic pieces were written by Van Den Bu
denmayer. All 16 are magnificent â€” 100 per
cent, hands down.
The main theme of the film is reminiscent
of Ravel's "Bolero": similar, yet fully devel
oped with many tender moments. Preisner
also abandons the nerve-wrecking repetition
of "Bolero," adding instead a twist of Eastern
European nostalgia. The different tracks are
segments or variations on the theme, each as
beautiful as the other. The quieter moments
have a subtleness sufficient to make you feel a
certain unknown within yourself.
The music strives to uncover the hidden
sublime around every corner. In the same
way the film is framed around destiny, the
music is structured around a spiritual pil
grimage which emphasizes the journey
rather than the destination. Again and again,
the music reminds us to look carefully with
in ourselves.
The two tracks of Van Den Budenmayer
are equally provoking and challenging. The
