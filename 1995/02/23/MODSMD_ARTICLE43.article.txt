## Why I love the fierce Dionne Farris 
### 
From the moment I heard she had left
Arrested 1 )evelopment to go solo I knew we
were in for «i good thing. Unsatisfied with
squeezing soulful vocals between Speech's
rapping aiul Headliner's percussion,
I )ionne Farris broke with her former family
and came on out with her own thing. Now,
of course there were skeptics. But with a

"Wild Seed — Wild Flower"
Dionne Farris

voice like hers that raised songs like "Ten
nessee" and "People Everyday" to new lev
els, it is a fitting career move.
"Wild Seed — Wild Flower," is a startling
debut album. Pulling from gospel, folk and
rock styles, Harris molds her musical influ
ences into a voice all her own. Listening to
this album is definitely a spiritual experi
ence. Grounded fundamentally within a
gospel aesthetic, Harris' own brand of alter
native music washes over us like an oceanic
tide. At times crashing in with harsh guitar
riffs while caressing with sweet, sweet
melodies in other moments, her songs find

a natural rhythm and carry us with them.
Harris' lyrical vocabulary is enhanced by
unique instrumentation and down-home
innovation. Take a song like "Stop to Think,
where the inimitable Lenny Kravitz accom
panies her. After a cool, violin-led opening,
a distorted voice announces "Adventures in
Negro 1 iistory." (iuitar riffs and percussion
then dominate the song, dropping funky
beats over a serious bass line.
A little further along is "Food For
Thought," a meditative masterpiece. With
violin, cello and organ accompaniment, the
arrangement is excruciatingly beautiful —
accosting our spiritual sensibilities and
pulling us into Farris' own self-questioning.
With lyrics like, "using food for thought
and thought for food/ all I have is my atti
tude/ the hour glass/ my ever changing
mood," Farris finds new ways of expressing
very simple, universal concerns.
Farris has no problem hanging back to
have fun, either. David Alan Grier of "In Liv
ing Color" fame drops in twice to insert a lit
tle high comedy into the musical oeuvre.
Raw, intense and fiercely creative, Farris
has soared high above lowered expectations
and arrested beginnings. She has won my
heart with this album.
