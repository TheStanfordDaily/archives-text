voice sounds hurt but not in pain. It is ex
tremely lonely, extremely sad, but beneath its
despondency there seems to be a voice softly
whispering: "keep moving. . .keep

There is no qualm that "Red" is a spiritu
al film which will either hit or fail in the first
15 minutes. How much of this sublimity

from the Preisner's music, 1 do not know.
This much is certain: "Red" is subtle and

spiritual, and for anyone who has the sensi
tivity, it is a great treat. And the trace of this
treat is the soundtrack — every minute of it.
