Beneath the dissonant hubbub of Mecca
Normal's new Matador Records release, "Sit
ting on Snaps," lies a no-holds-barred com
mitment to anything arty. Most of it is so
bravely unconventional and tuneless that
you forgive them for their moments of os
tentation and pretension. Ultimately,
though, Mecca Normal comes off sounding
like worn out Velvet Underground devotees,
over-smoked and under-practiced.
Still, 1 like this album a lot. It's bouts of
semi-frantic tunefulness and improvised
feedback delirium give off a nice feel. The
eleven songs end up sounding as if they were
produced by washed-up and sentimental
coffee shop regulars, drowning in espresso
and lovable morbidity. It's full of itself, true.

"Sitting on Snaps"
Mecca Normal

But it sounds agonized and wrenched in all
the right places.
Mecca Normal's prolific guitarist and vo
calist David Lester and lean Smith have been
recording since 1986 on a slew of indepen
dent labels including Kill Rock Stars, Sub
Pop, K and Matador. "Sitting on Snaps" was
recorded in bits and pieces on their world
tour last year. And the album feels like that:
scattered. The songs range from uneasy folk
ditties to caustic electric assaults. Jean
Smith's vocals range from oddly plaintive
melodies to moments where she doesn't
seem to sing — just stretches words out
along a single note. David Lester's rambling
guitar feels improvised and stylishly arrhyth

mic.
There's not much to tap your foot to here,
hardly anything to hum in the shower.
"Frozen Rain" offers acoustic guitars that
fold into an electric feedback hum. "Alibi" is
a late-night bluesy arpeggio set against
stringy, wicked witch of the west vocal
twangs.
Continuity there isn't. The inaccessible,
pretentious moments fade into melodies.
The beautiful, murky folk instincts of
"Beppo's Room" wash away unrelenting
arty-ness. Acoustic guitars and perfect har
monies slide over brewing electric mayhem.
Inexplicable poetry runs through all of
Mecca Normal's songs. From "Frozen Rain":
"Waxy laughter breaks your knees." And in
"Beppo's Room" startling prettiness: "I'm
sitting on the sand floor / With my arms
around my knees / Experimenting with day
dreams." No line rhymes. It's acidic art rock
free verse, and it's actually good. A tad pre
tentious like everything else about Mecca
Normal, but still incurably appealing.
