# Timbuk3 delivers on their promise
## 
### 
Years ago, Timbuk3 said that their future
was so bright they had to wear shades. That
future has finally arrived with their reappear
ance on their new album "A Hundred Lovers."
Timbuk3's approach is simple. They
choose only a select group of instruments for
each song. Then taking turns to play either the
solid melodic line or bulk out the tune, the
heavy bass, naked acoustic, and thin electric

"A Hundred Lovers"
Timbuk3

guitars are all used. For percussion, "A Hun
dred Lovers" beats with a regular drum set in
cluding the crash cymbal but also bumps with
the bongo drum. The harmonica sprinkles it
self throughout modestly, not playing enough
to become annoying nor playing too little to
be missed.
In nearly all the songs, the two voices of Pat
Mac Donald and Barbara K sing in two differ
ent octaves. They harmonize but do not blend
into a complete sound like a barber shop
quartet or Winston Philips. Mac Donald
mimics the bass singing with a deep, solid
sloopy sound that slides from note to note. It
is an excellent match with K who can bottom

at an even lower range.
For worldly diversity Timbuk3 uses a
Middle Eastern sound in "Kitchen Fire" and
a reggae drum in "Not Yet Gone." Another
interesting technique is altering Mac Do
nald's voice to sound as though it is coming
from a static-y radio in "Shotgun Wedding."
Timbuk3 is matter of fact. Blunt, straight
forward and without any mixed messages, the
lyrics talk about teenage pregnancy, AIDS,
sex, homosexuality, religion and the homeless
without making heavy political statements.
Instead the social issues are written about in a
light humorous manner.
In "Inside Out," Timbuk3 dissects society
using the phrase "inside out." "Inside out I
wear my Sunday best/ Inside out I bear my soul
in jest/ Inside out my house is on the street/ In
side out I'm not so hard to meet/ Some say hi
or smile as they pass/ Some just look, some just
laugh/ Some give spare change, some wear no
doubt/ Some turn their pockets inside out."
Starting with the literal and then turning figu
ratively, the lyrics go on to look at and criticize
society from the inside out.
With a simple sound and realistic lyrics
Timbuk3 has made a comeback. In the past
they talked about the future. Now Timbuk3
has resurfaced and talks about the present. It
was worth the wait.
