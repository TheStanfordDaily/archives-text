# Siouxsie Sioux's imperfect The Rapture' still mesmerizes
## 
### 
Siouxsie Sioux, notorious for her dark
music and ghoulish image, now claims to be
multi-faceted, that there is more to her new
album, "The Rapture" than morbidity. Her
photos, however, feature her clad in black
grasping her neck, and a majority of the
songs on "The Rapture" have lyrics that
would make Hannibal Lecter seem like a re
ally happy guy.

"The Rapture"
Siouxsie Sioux and the
Banshees

"The Rapture" was produced largely by
John Gale of the Velvet Underground; conse
quently, it lacks much of the vocal acrobatics
and true angst that have previously differen
tiated Siouxsie from hordes of imitators.
"O Baby," "Tearing Apart" and "Stargaz
er," are bland, happy songs. Musically
repetitive and lyrically inane — "the cracks
in the ground grin up at me even the creas
es in my shoes smile up at me" — these
songs create a particularly weak opening for
the album.
In the fourth song, the catchy "Fall From
Graze," Siouxsie Finally begins to flex her
voice. The upward trend continues with "Not
Forgotten," where true melancholic feelings
surface; Siouxsie's sharp voice is at its most

powerful when it is expressing unhappiness.
"Sick Child," the middle song and apex of
"The Rapture," is quirky and almost bluesy in
feel. It begins with a guitar, chimes and
Siouxsie singing in a quiet voice, then gradu
ally builds up momentum.
"The Lonely One," very appropriately
about two lonely people who want each
other, makes the Cure-esque mistake of cou
pling sad lyrics with a cheerful tune.
"The Rapture," the album's title song, is
11 minutes long, and entails a variety of
changes. Intricately detailing the process of
falling in love, the song switches from ecstasy
— "far above the cloud sinking far below the
ground only my senses remain the rapture
unfurling blues and greens" — to doubt —
"unharnessed storms the plough by the cres
cent disc rising amethyst how can love re
main the same unchained?"
"Double Life" relates an eerie tale, and the
album concludes with its strongest song, the
musically complex "Love Out Me."
"The Rapture," is not Siouxsie and the
Banshees' finest album, but it definitely has
worthwhile moments — some of the songs
are thoroughly mesmerizing. If Siouxsie had
focused more on sorrow and despair, "The
Rapture" might have been flawless; unfortu
nately, like the dismal existence Siouxsie so
often sings about, "The Rapture" is not per
fect.
