# Massive musical schizophrenia

Reading Shakespeare at a construction
site — that's what listening to Massive At
tack's new album "Protection" is like. The
album contains some incredible music, but
more often than not, the repetitive, mechan
ical and excessively loud bass rhythms negate
one's enjoyment of the subtlety and beauty of
the music.

group, received much critical praise in Britain

"Protection"
Massive Attack

for their first album, "Blue Lines." After losing
its lead singer Shara Nelson, the group stayed
together to release this second album, "Pro
tection," three years after its debut.
Containing no less than six different lead
vocalists, the album explores a remarkable
number of musical styles, from the silky funk
of "Protection" to the heavy rap of "Karma
coma" to the elegant jazz of "Weather
Storm." However, such eclecticism does not
necessarily lead to a coherent album. Instead,
Massive Attack comes off as schizophrenic,
unable to commit to any one style.
Nonetheless, some individual tracks are
indeed outstanding. "Karmacoma" com
bines a gorgeous percussive track with a
droning style of rap that produces a hypnot
ic beauty.
But the group's penchant for suffocating
ly low and repetitive bass beats kills some of
the most promising tracks of the album.
"Protection" and "Better Things" both
display admirable vocal control from Tracey

Thorn as she graccfully delivers an almost
dream-like lyricism, but each song is then de
stroyed by the bass line, which simply over
powers the subtlety of the singing.
Furthermore, the entire album suffers
from an excess of control. The same tempo is
inexplicably sustained from beginning to
end. Never is anything loose or ragged even
suggested. Instead, the cold perfectionism of
the album alienates the listener.
All this is truly a shame because the group
does some remarkable things musically, but
its concept of what listeners will actually
want to listen to is seriously flawed.
