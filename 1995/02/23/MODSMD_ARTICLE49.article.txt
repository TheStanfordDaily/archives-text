## Casting shadows of Hong Kong's future 
### 
To the uninitiated, Hong Kong cinema
means little more than F/X-laden sword
fighting adventures and the John Woo school
of designer violence. Yet in 1990, writer-di
rector Wong Kar-Wai's seminal film "Days of
Being Wild" presented such a mesmerizing
meditation on an aimless generation that
old-school cinephiles were forced to re-ex
amine their disdain for Hong Kong's assem
bly-line celluloid culture.

Chungking Express

"Chungking I-xpress" marks Wong's
much-anticipated return. But, unlike its ex
pensive predecessor, the intimate scope,
small cast and modest budget of the current
film all point to a leaner, meaner, neo-realist
philosophy — even the protagonists are
named after their corresponding actors.
What results is 1 long Kong's most boldly
conceived and acutely observed piece of cin
ema in recent memory. The setting is grimy
Chungking Mansion in downtown
Tsimshatsui district, a concrete labyrinth

where shady per
sonalities of every

trade and persuasion weave among milling
blonde backpackers and sari-clad immigrant
merchants at any hour of the day.
Situated amid the noisy clatter and acrid
odors are two couples linked to one another
more by existentialist forces than linear nar
rative. Teen heartthrob Takeshi Kaneshiro
encounters Brigitte Lin's shadowy femme fa
taleon his nightly patrol as a plainclothes law
enforcer. In the second episode, l ave Wong is
an assistant in a late-night diner frequented
by another cop played by Tony Leung Chiu-
Wai.
Like actor Leung, art director Chang Suk-
I'ing and cinematographer Christopher
Doyle are both repeat performers from
"Days of Being Wild." In the current film,
Doyle's hand-held steadicam is responsible
for the arresting imagery of the later seg
ment. (Captured in fluid detail from imagina
tive vantage points, meandering human traf
fic and staccato body movements — particu
larly those of l ave Wong's obsessive character
— achieve a breathtaking sense of dynamism
not found anywhere since the French New
Wave in the '60s.
Lest one accuse Wone of derivative Go-

dardian excesses,
"Chungking Express"
has its feet firmly rooted
in pre-1997 Hong Kong
post-modernism. De
void of overt socio-polit
ical statements, the film
suggests that the frenzied
mayhem and oppor
tunistic psyches in the
final hours of a free
wheeling economy may
be driving forces for Lin's
drug smuggler in a
blonde wig.
Indeed, the questions
of urban disarray, alien
ation and anonymity —
Kaneshiro and Leung are
mainly addressed by
their paging account
numbers — constantly
underscore the film's
narrative, and are made
timely as .1 vibrant era of
1 long Kong's contempo
rary history arrives at a
showdown with the
looming specter of fu
ture uncertainty.
The 13th San Fran
cisco International
Asian American Film
Festival is screening
"Chungking Express" at
the Kabuki Theater,
March 3, at 9 p.m.
