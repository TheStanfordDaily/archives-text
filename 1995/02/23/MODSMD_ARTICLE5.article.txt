# Fac Sen to discuss ethnic programs
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
After months of debate over
their contents, proposals for Chi
cano and Asian-American Stud
ies programs will be opened to
discussion at the Faculty Senate
meeting today.
John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, will present the report to
the senate, after which senators
will have an opportunity to ask
questions, said Senate Chair Bob
Simoni, a biology professor.
The proposals were not dis
tributed in advance because of
last-minute "stylistic changes,"
Shoven said.
Because senate members were

not able to look at the proposals
before the meeting, Simoni said,
the debate will probably give only
a glimpse of what may come.
Shoven's report is the latest
stage in the University's exami
nation of possible Chicano and
Asian-American Studies pro
grams.
Committees to look at such
programs were established last
spring, in response to student
protests that included a hunger
strike and a demonstration at a
senate meeting. The committees
are made up of a mix of students
and faculty members.
In January, after several
months of research and discus-
sion, the committees sent their
proposals to Shoven.
Shoven said he expects an
"interesting debate" â€” proba
bly over funding rather than
the content of the programs.
"I'm certainly optimistic
that we've got a very construc
tive program that will be good
for Stanford," Shoven said.
"In this environment, the
big debates are usually over
resources," he said. "This is
kind of a tough atmosphere to

introduce new programs. ... I
doubt there will be too much
debate about whether this is a
good thing."
Senior Gerald Chen, who
served on the Asian-American
Studies committee, said he is
"pretty happy with the commit
tee's work" and "very hopeful
for the future."
"I think everyone on the
committee feels satisfied with
the proposal that was presented
to Dean Shoven," he said.
Chen said Shoven supports
the proposals, but he couldn't
predict the senate's reaction.
The issues raised by the
protests and the progress of the

committees have been dis
cussed in several forums
already, but, Simoni said, fur
ther debate on the proposals
themselves will have to wait
until they have been looked at
more closely.
The issue may require more
meetings and forums for discus
sion when all interested parties
are more informed, Simoni said.
"This is going to take some
real reflection and thought," he
said. "The really substantive
questions will come after a lit
tle reflection."
Simoni added that he has
received several calls from peo
ple curious about today's meet

ing. "There's a lot of interest in
this," he said.
Only senators and members
of the Chicano Studies and
Asian-American Studies Com
mittees will be able to speak at
the meeting, Simoni said.
Though Simoni said he
couldn't judge the success of
the ethnic studies committees
before reading the proposals,
he said he was optimistic. "It's
nice that there is some progress
to report," he said.
Chen called the proposals "a
great moment in the struggle
for Asian-American Studies."
But, he added, "the hard
part is just beginning."
