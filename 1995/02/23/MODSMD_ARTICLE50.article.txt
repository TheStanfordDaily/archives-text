# Just skip Connery's 'Just Cause'
## 
### 
"lust Cause," starring Scan Connery, Blair
Underwood and Kd Harris, has only one
amusing aspect: cutc alligators. It 1 hadn't
been writing a review, I would have walked
out. "Just Cause" features a bad script, disap
pointing acting, checsy camera angles and an
obnoxiously predictable plot. 1 didn't like it.
The opening scene: A young African Amer

ican, Bobby Earl Ferguson (Underwood), is
arrested and tortured into a confession of rape
and murder.
The next scene: a debate between two Har
vard professors, one of them Connery's char
acter, Paul Armstrong, about whether the
death penalty is justifiable. Can we say,
"Pass/No Clue scholarship?" If these were re

ally Harvard professors, Stanford would never
have to worry about intellectual competition.
As the movie thuds along, we find that per
haps Bobhv F.arl did not commit the crime.
Maybe it was his psychopathic prison- mate,
Blair Sullivan (Ed Harris). Eventually even
Armstrong, now Bobby Earl's attorney, gets
involved in the slaughter.
"Every once in a while," says Armstrong's
wife (Kate Capshaw), "you've got to get a little
bloody. Its good for the soul." The violent plot

Just Cause

twists without excitement or real suspense
The viewer discovers that all is not black
and white in "Just Cause." Even if we can't fig
ure out who committed which crimes in the
movie, we are not inclined to care. The film is
replete with such unbelievable dialogue and
so many unlikely coincidences that it is ab
solutely impossible to suspend disbelief long
enough to be vaguely amused.
Scan Connery has proved many times (as
with his outstanding role in"The Hunt for
Red October") that he can combine wry
humor with unquenchable integrity. Howev
er, his performance in "Just Cause" lacks true
emotion and is devoid of the enthusiasm
which might have made it work.
The beautiful Blair Underwood juggles and
does his best with a very difficult role — we are
not allowed or supposed to see much about
his character until the end of the film. Ed Har
ris clearly revels in his character as a remorse
less lunatic; his lucid and fun acting is one of
the few highlights of "Just Cause."

"lust Cause tries
and fails to address
issues of racism, tra
dition, family and ju
risprudence. Instead,
it leads the viewer
into a labyrinth of
banality.
One leaves the
film feeling that the
two hours would
have been better
spent asleep.
