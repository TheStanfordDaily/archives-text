# Nothing for snobs in 'Jerky Boys'
## 
### 
Confessions of a Jerky Boys junkie: I am
ideologically opposed to panning this film,
even though it (heh-heh) sucks.
Last month, I had the opportunity to
spend a few days in Breckenridge with
friends from days of yore. Snowboard
hounds looking for a legitimate way to spend
a winter season, these friends of mine were

The Jerky Boys

Jerky fiends. During my short stay, they ex
posed me to Jerky Boys recordings like
"Hairy nipples," "Fruityass," "Sizzlechest,"
"Hemorrhoid-suffering" — the whole nine
yards.
1 admit 1 liked it.
I laughed at the senseless, rude, scatologi
cal humor (such as excrement jokes). 1
laughed at the awful insults and the igno
rance of prank victims. I laughed when my

friends constantly alluded to the movie at
every non-Jerky listening moment.
It was sick and twisted, yet it was a funny
sick twistedness.
With all that background, 1 knew the
movie was going to be stoo-pid. What else
could it be? An entertaining, coherent come
dy? Fun for the whole family? Oscar materi
al?
Let's not fool ourselves and allow our eru
dite, 1-only-watch-foreign-film ways over
whelm us. "The Jerky Boys" is bad, but I am
not certain the typical critical approach will
provide insight. Yes, Johnny Brennan and
Kamal Ahmed (a.k.a. the Boys) don't seem to
realize the camera has been rolling for a few
seconds after a scene begins. Yes, the thin,
banal plot — the Boys get tangled in mob op
erations through their crank calls — spins it
self out and fails to grab hold of the audience.
Yes, you could just watch the television
commercial or the movie trailers and catch
enough laughs to make you vomit. Yes, you
could argue that there is nothing redeeming

about this movie.
But, despite these criticisms, this film's
success depends on its already existing audi
ence. The Jerky Hoys have a guaranteed clien
tele who know and accept the Jerky Boys'
inanity. And even if the movie doesn't mea
sure up to the degree of hilarity of Jerky Boys
albums, the complaints won't equal the caus
tic commentary of movie critics who have

forgotten that albums and movies produce
significantly different reactions.
The Boys will offend you if you are sensi
tive to limp plots, weak acting and glaring
racial stereotypes about the mob. But to up
braid the movie in the name of celluloid elit
ist criticism is as senseless as the lerky Boys
themselves.
