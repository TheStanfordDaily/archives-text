"You're all a part of me, and there's no es
caping that," admits Jan Brady (Jennifer Hlise
Cox) to her family after a failed attempt to
run away. I sympathize with you, Jan. In fact,
I recommend fleeing before the film even
starts.

The Brady Bunch Movie

"The Brady Bunch Movie" drags along
like one long "Saturday Night Live" sketch
filled with moronic jokes, one-liners and
cameo appearances. Director Betty Thomas,
also known for her direction of early "Doo-

gie Howser, M.D."
episodes, follows the
lives of the Brady family
as they live out their '70s
existence in a '90s envi
ronment.
Sequestered behind
their seemingly 20-foot
tall fence, the Brady
family dresses in butter
fly collars, bell bottoms
and distractingly pat-

terned shirts. They hold family potato sack
races on their backyard astro-turf, worship
the Monkees and listen intently as Mike
Brady (Clary Cole) delivers muddled words

of wisdom.
Granted, the movie does seem to follow
some sort of plot line, albeit poorly con
structed and completely unbelievable. Basi

cally, the Bradys will be evicted from their
home within a week, unless they can pay
$20,000 in property taxes. It just so happens
that there's a talent contest at school that's of
fering a $20,000 prize. Hmmm... coinci
dence? 1 think not.
The sub-plots are similarly foolish. Greg
(Christopher Daniel Barnes) wants to be a
rock singer, except he lacks talent. He spends
most of the movie singing to himself in front
of a mirror. Marcia suffers a major teen
dilemma: She books two dates for the same
night. At one point she declares, "My life is
over!" Finally, Carol (Shelley Long) manages
to look overly perky and simultaneously per
plexed throughout the movie.
"The Brady Bunch Movie" attempts to
both parody and pay tribute to the original
series. At the end, however, the viewer is sim
ply left confused... and hopeful that a sequel
is never made.
