Before the Rain
Milcho Manchevski's award-win
ning feature debut, "Before the
Rain," opens at a monastery in
Macedonia, where Kiril, a young
monk played by Gregoire Colin en
counters Zamira (Labina Mitevska),
a mysterious Albanian girl hidden in
his room. While communication is
challenged by his vow of silence,
the two find understanding and love
— before a bloody tragedy ends
"Words," part one of this com
pelling, three part drama.
In "Faces" and "Pictures," we en
counter London-based photo editor
Anne (Katrin Cartlidge), her lover,
war photographer Aleksandar
Kirkov (Rade Serbedzija), Anne's
self-effacing husband Nick (Jay Vil
liers), and an assortment of Mace
donian and Albanian villagers from
Aleksandar's youth.
Beautifully shot, "Before the Rain"
is a circular narrative that makes
use of three simple stories to ex
plore the pitfalls of ethnic conflict in
the former Yugoslavia. This is no fa
talistic tale. The narrative opens it
self up to hope and, we're left with
the indelible power of possibility.
A Man of No Importance
Middle-aged bus conductor Alfie

Byrne (Albert Finney) not only har
bors clandestine affections for his
cute driver Robbie (Rufus Sewell),
their regular passengers provide the
amateur talent for Alfie's dream pro
duction of "Salome," Wilde's play
that dares not speak its name.
The threat to Alfie's ambitions
looms large in the shape of sister
Lily (Brenda Fricker) and Bible-tot
ing neighbor Mr. Carney (Michael
Gambon). A neat package indeed,
director Suri Krishnamma's debut
feature defies its viewer to resist its
immediate charms. Vet, the film's
central premise remains problem
atic.
While set in the swinging '60s, the
film's cautious take on its tragic gay
hero resonates more with the Victo
rian sensibilities that had indicted
his idol — Wilde — almost a century
before. So excruciatingly over
wrought with pain and pity, Alfie's
trials and tribulations in "A Man of
No Importance" are fashioned as
though the New Queer Cinema had
never happened.
Miami Rhapsody
"Miami Rhapsody" documents
how relationships bloom with im
mediate passion and rot with re
fusals to make compromises. And it

does so with style, humility and an
unintentionally hilarious acting
debut by über-model Naomi Camp
bell.
Meet Gwen (Sarah Jessica Park
er). At her sister's wedding, her fa
ther (Paul Mazurksy) expresses sus
picions of marital disloyalty. At an
outdoor shopping center, her moth
er (Mia Farrow) admits she's been
having an affair with a mucho
machismo Cuban nurse (Antonio
Banderas). At her brother's pad,
she discovers that he (Kevin Pollak)
has been having an affair with his
partner's wife (Naomi Campbell). At
a restaurant, she meets her father's
anguished ex-lover. At home, Gwyn
walks into her sister having an after
noon romp with someone she didn't
exchange vows with at her recent
wedding. There seems to be a trend
here.
"Miami Rhapsody" handles the
loaded subject of love with a light
knowingness that hasn't been in
theaters much in recent years. The
heroine isn't a martyr or a slave of
squalid hunger. She's just a sensi
ble, modern chick who refuses to
rose-tint romance. Sarah Jessica
Parker, biting her nails under her
Aveda-drenched ringlets through
out the movie, plays the neurotic

romantic well with her sharply hon
est opinions and gentle coos.
The Quick and the Dead
In a small town called Redemp
tion, the skankiest outlaws and gun
slingers come face to face for the
Quick Draw competition to find out
just who deserves the title of fastest
gun in the West. Sam Raimi's "The
Quick and the Dead" is a smooth
blend of comedy and drama; this
flick is pure entertainment.
Sharon Stone stars as Ellen
(alias the "Lady"), a tough broad
with a quick tongue and an even
quicker Colt. Gene Hackman gives
a wonderful performance as
Herod, the evil gun who rules Re
demption with a callous iron-fist.
Equally delightful are Russell
Crowe as Reverend Cort, a re
formed outlaw, and Leonardo Di-
Caprio as the Kid.
Mocking its own hammy the
atrics, the film plays with every
stereotype of the Old West — yet
in spite of it all, the movie has rare
moments of seriousness — so
carefully executed, they almost
bring tears to your eyes. These
scenes, crafted with honesty and
clarity, save the film from its own
quick death.
