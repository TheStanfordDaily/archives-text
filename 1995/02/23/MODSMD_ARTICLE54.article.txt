Black History Month is a time to cele
brate the miracle of the Blues and Jazz.
The word "miracle" is not used lightly.
A fusion of Afro-American rhythm and Euro
pean harmonic and melodic traditions, Jazz
and the Blues took root among rural and
urban blacks in the late 19th century as folk
art/entertainment. Thanks to exploding tech
nology — mainly the phonograph record —
jazz and the blues developed with astonishing
speed into a complex and infinitely varied art
that interacted with white popular music, Eu
ropean concert music, and ethnic music
everywhere, to become the only universal lan
guage of this beleaguered planet.
Jazz accomplished this despite appalling

racial, academic and social prejudice. Damned
from the pulpit, attacked by "proper" music
schools, abhorred by the respectable middle
class—black as well as white—and often mis
represented by the mass media, jazz seized
people of all colors and nations in new ways.
And anything that gets your body moving in
ways it never moved before, will get your mind
moving in ways it never moved before.
Today, jazz and its offshoots rhythm 'n'
blues and rock are heard and played in every
major country; when mainland China really
starts to "swing" it will change that country
just as it changed Czechoslovakia, Poland and
Japan.
In my jazz courses at Stanford, I remind

students that the records played in class aren't
rare. Any well-stocked record shop carries the
timeless work of Duke Ellington, Louis Arm
strong, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Count
Basie, Lester Young and Art Tatum — in mul
tiple-takes on Italian, British, Japanese, Aus
tralian and Dutch labels. This is why I call jazz
America's classical music, because this music,
like that of Bach, Mozart and Stravinsky has
stood the test of time: It endures.
Genuine racial integration in the United
States began within the community of the
jazz musician long before the integration of
schools, sports or the military. But you can
go through high school and college and no
one will tell you this. If the black and white

people of the United States had never mutu
ally developed this powerful body-based lan
guage to communicate, the history of this na
tion could have veered into some imaginable
science-fiction horror. When white teenagers
bought records of Charlie Christian, asked
Lionel Hampton for his autograph and
pinned photos of Billy Eckstein and Aretha
Franklin on their bedroom walls, it was no
longer possible to sell them the myth of white
superiority that was such a comfort to their
elders.
