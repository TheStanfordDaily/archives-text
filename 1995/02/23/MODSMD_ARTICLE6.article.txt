# Tree and Oski off the hook
## Mascots not to be charged 
### Gabriela Teodorescu Contributing writer 
Criminal charges will not be filed in connec
tion with the brawl between the Stanford Tree
and Oski the Cal Bear at the men's basketball
game last Wednesday.
The Santa Clara County District Attorney's
Office notified Stanford Police that it would not
press charges after reviewing the case, Sgt. John
McMullen said.
"They looked upon it as a mutual combat sit
uation as opposed to an assault or battery situa
tion," McMullen said. "I think it just seemed to
them like some play that must have got ten out of
hand."
If charges had been filed, the
true identity of Oski would have
become public information —
going against Cal's tradition of
keeping the person behind the
paws a secret. Now, only Stan
ford Police and the District Attor
ney's Office know the mascot's
identity.
The Tree's real-life alter ego,
sophomore Ari Mervis, was not
aware that criminal charges
against him had been dropped.
"I actually didn't know,"
Mervis said. "I didn't really con
sider it a very serious matter — I
think the police were just follow
ing the standard procedure."
Responding to concerns that
the Department of Athletics
might take action against him,

Mervis said that "they have not
said anything, though they were
obviously displeased."
"I think they realized that it
was not a big deal," Mervis
added. "They do not want it to
happen again, though."
Berkeley officials also seemed
to be taking the incident lightly.
"We don't support fighting in
public, but at the same time we
viewed it as something that was
just a jest and not very serious,"
said Kathy Ritter-Andrews, the
Bear's representative at UC-
Berkeley.
One or both of the mascots
could have been charged with
assault and battery for the skir
mish.
"I was kind of able to get out
all of my negative feelings
towards Oski that night, especial
ly with the ripping off of his
head," Mervis said. "The tree is
still a bear's natural enemy."
