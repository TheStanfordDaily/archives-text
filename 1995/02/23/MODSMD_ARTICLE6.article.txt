Criminal charges will not be filed in connec
tion with the brawl between the Stanford Tree
and Oski the Cal Bear at the men's basketball
game last Wednesday.
The Santa Clara County District Attorney's
Office notified Stanford Police that it would not
press charges after reviewing the case, Sgt. John
McMullen said.
"They looked upon it as a mutual combat sit
uation as opposed to an assault or battery situa
tion," McMullen said. "I think it just seemed to
them like some play that must have got ten out of
hand."
