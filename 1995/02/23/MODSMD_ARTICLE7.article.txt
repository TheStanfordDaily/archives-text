# Green's floor plans on display
## 
### Gabriela Teodorescu Contributing writer 
Floor plans for the repair and
renovation of Green Library's
West Wing have been completed
and are on display in the library's
East Wing lobby until mid-March.
"The design documents are
available for people to see, and we
do not anticipate any major
changes in them," said Karen
Nagy, deputy University librarian.
The project is scheduled for com
pletion and reopening in 1999.
The West Wing has been closed
since the 1989 Loma Prieta earth
quake. Finalization of the plans
comes at the end of an almost four
year process which began in 1991.
This display is the first to show
final plans of what will be the ren
ovated west wing of the library.
"No major changes have oc
curred in the plans — some small
things have been fleshed out,"
Nagy added. "But these docu

ments are the same as the ones
which were submitted last year."
The plans include two new re
source centers — with curatorial
staff, books and computer clusters
— which the building will hold.
"Libraries are evolving due to
increased technology," said Sarah
Williamson, director of facilities
services. "The problem is that
when dealing with an existing
building, we needed to make the
space as flexible as possible."
On the first floor of the north
side, the Social Sciences Resource
Center will include Government
Documents and will become the
focus for advanced social science
research. The center will hold
workstations for use in analysis
and manipulation of large data
sets, and house 10,000 to 15,000
volumes.
The north side's second floor
will hold the Humanities and Area
Studies Resource Center. This
center will provide access to these

collections, along with support for
instruction and research in these
fields.
Many large tables for reading
and study as well as an expanded
collection of reference works and
classic texts also will be available.
This center will hold approximate
ly 30,000 volumes.
"We looked at all the competing
needs, and we looked at how best
to allocate space in an area that
has patron, student and collection
needs," Williamson said.
Williamson focused on in
creased computer accessibility as
the most flexible feature of the
plans.
"The building will have an in
frastructure of wiring which will
allow for much greater connectivi
ty for computers and laptops,"
Williamson said. "It allows us to
wire the building to make it much
more feasible for the current
changes in technology."
Each resource center will
have printed reference and
source materials, as well as com
puter clusters. Computer con
nections for data delivery and
other information sources will
be located at every reader seat
and staff station.
Last year, some faculty voiced
concerns over the separation of
the disciplines in the library, but
things have apparently changed.
"We ended up getting a lot of
endorsements for the plans from
the faculty and staff," Nagy said.
"I think the new arrangement
will provide a richer array of

information and more in depth
consultation."
One of the last year's critics,
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz,
said he was reassured after
meeting with staff at the library.
However, he said he was still
concerned as to whether under
graduate students will be too
"intimidated" to ask senior
library officials about where the
separation between social sci
ences and humanities lies.
"Will the students feel at ease
contacting these fairly senior
people to get advice on the
crossover in social sciences and
humanities?" Rebholz said. "If
the students do not encounter
these obstacles it should be
fine."
Special Collections, including
the University Archives, will be

located at the front of the
library's second floor and will
become the new Field Room with
4,000 volumes. Other reading
and conference rooms will be
located on the third, fourth and
fifth floors.
The conference rooms will
contain instructional technolo
gy, allowing faculty to present
computer and video displays,
simulations, communication
programs or multimedia materi
als. They also will be equipped to
allow local or global broadcast
ing of instructional program
ming.
The rotunda at the top of the
grand staircase will still be used
as an exhibit area. The Bender
Room on the fifth floor — which
contains 5,000 to 10,000 vol
umes — will be open for patron

use as a reading room.
The bottom three levels of the
seven-tiered stacks and the
Green West basement will con
tain around 250,000 volumes in
the Government Documents col
lection.
The Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency in 1994 agreed
to provide $15.8 million for
Green West. The project budget
is $39.8 million. So far, $16.2
million of the $18.9 million fund
raising goal has been raised and
fund raising continues.
"It is a very exciting program,
especially since we are breaking
new ground," Williamson said.
"This program will have some
payoffs and I think many under
graduates would like to see the
inside of Green Library's West
Wing."
