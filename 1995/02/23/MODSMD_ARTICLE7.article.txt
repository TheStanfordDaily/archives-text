Floor plans for the repair and
renovation of Green Library's
West Wing have been completed
and are on display in the library's
East Wing lobby until mid-March.
"The design documents are
available for people to see, and we
do not anticipate any major
changes in them," said Karen
Nagy, deputy University librarian.
The project is scheduled for com
pletion and reopening in 1999.
The West Wing has been closed
since the 1989 Loma Prieta earth
quake. Finalization of the plans
comes at the end of an almost four
year process which began in 1991.
This display is the first to show
final plans of what will be the ren
ovated west wing of the library.
"No major changes have oc
curred in the plans — some small
things have been fleshed out,"
Nagy added. "But these docu

ments are the same as the ones
which were submitted last year."
The plans include two new re
source centers — with curatorial
staff, books and computer clusters
— which the building will hold.
"Libraries are evolving due to
increased technology," said Sarah
Williamson, director of facilities
services. "The problem is that
when dealing with an existing
building, we needed to make the
space as flexible as possible."
On the first floor of the north
side, the Social Sciences Resource
Center will include Government
Documents and will become the
focus for advanced social science
research. The center will hold
workstations for use in analysis
and manipulation of large data
sets, and house 10,000 to 15,000
volumes.
The north side's second floor
will hold the Humanities and Area
Studies Resource Center. This
center will provide access to these

collections, along with support for
instruction and research in these
fields.
Many large tables for reading
and study as well as an expanded
collection of reference works and
classic texts also will be available.
This center will hold approximate
ly 30,000 volumes.
"We looked at all the competing
needs, and we looked at how best
to allocate space in an area that
has patron, student and collection
needs," Williamson said.
Williamson focused on in
creased computer accessibility as
the most flexible feature of the
plans.
"The building will have an in
frastructure of wiring which will
allow for much greater connectivi
ty for computers and laptops,"
Williamson said. "It allows us to
wire the building to make it much
more feasible for the current
