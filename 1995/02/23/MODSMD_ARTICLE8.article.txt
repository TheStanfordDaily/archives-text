# A 						cure for procrastination?
## Workshop teaches students how to manage their time 
### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
Are you reading this article instead of
startingyour five-page CIV paper that is due
tomorrow? Or perhaps you should be study
ing for your upcoming calculus midterm in
stead?
If procrastination is your worst enemy,
never fear. Sam Edwards, a Counseling and
Psychological Services adviser, is presently
teaching "The Procrastination Workshop"
every Friday afternoon to help Stanford stu
dents manage time better.
Edwards said he noticed a real need for
this workshop last quarter in his one-on-one
meetings with students.
"There were a good number of students
coming in with problems about procrasti

nating," Edwards said.
Students around campus said they think
the workshop is a good idea, especially at
Stanford.
Freshman Kara Dußray agreed that the
workshop would be beneficial for her. "I
think the procrastination workshop is a
good idea. However, I don't imagine you're
going to get a lot of procrastinators to show
up unless it means avoiding a CIV paper,"
she said. "Actually, if attending the work
shop gives me a good reason to put off my
work, I'm there."
Senior Matthew Francis pointed out that
procrastination will probably always be
prevalent with Stanford's laid-back atmos
phere. "It's considered the norm to procras-

tinate. It's not cool to be stressed
about your studies. It's essential
that we begin to see our lives as
not the next paper — it's some
thing more than that," he said.
Simply recognizing procrasti
nation tendencies would benefit
students, said junior Matt Losey.
"I think some people procrasti
nate and they don't even know it,
including myself. If people could
learn to get things done ahead of
time, there would be a lot less
stress and anxiety," he said.
An integral part of the pro
gram is "talking a lot about what
procrastination is. There is a dif
ference in avoiding work just to
avoid it and having a true pro
crastination problem," Edwards
explained.
He added that he sees the lat
ter as being much more serious.
"Students might not do the work
and it might cause them an
incomplete, a failing grade or ulti
mately dismissal from the school.

This is true procrastination."
After discussing procrastina
tion, the program also "identifies
what people's procrastinating
preferences are," Edwards said,
including "playing computer
games, visiting friends and spend
ing time doing other things rather
than doing the work itself."
Losey said he has already iden
tified his procrastinating prefer
ence. "I clean my room," he said.
"The week before finals, my room
is the cleanest."
Finding the procrastination
"trigger" is also important in
overcoming the problem, and
Edwards said he sees the lack of a
particular structure as one such
trigger. If students are not clear
about what the exact assignment
is, or what the professor expects
of them, they are less likely to
begin the task at all, he said.
Edwards added that having to
work alone acts as another pro
crastination trigger because, he
said, "It can be hard to tolerate
the isolation."
Other errors in judgment that
may result in putting off work
until the last minute occur when

"students overestimate their
capabilities or misjudge the
amount of time an assignment
will take," Edwards said.
Perfectionists, Edwards said,
often join the workshop, because
they tend to procrastinate for fear
of turning in an imperfect assign
ment. The program teaches these
particular students to "not expect
themselves to turn out perfect
products. This is an evolution in
learning," he said.
Once these procrastination
preferences and triggers have
been identified, Edwards has his
students role-play. There, they
can practice avoiding procrastina
tion in a real life situation.
For example, the students in
the program go through the act of
walking to a desk, sitting down
and beginning their work.
Edwards said the students in the
role-play will often "decide sud
denly that they want a Coke or to
smoke or do anything else than
work."
By role-playing, students can
identify their weaknesses in
hopes of avoiding them in the
future.

One important part of over
coming the hurdle of procrastina
tion is establishing a time sched
ule and sticking to it, Edwards
said. For this, the students in the
workshop give each other a great
deal of support, such as request
ing that others call them to see
how they are doing with their
assignments. Knowing that some
one is checking up on you can
often be a motivation in working
diligently, he said.
Edwards said he has two pieces
of advice for all the procrastina
tors on campus.
"Try to avoid setting up
implicit procrastination support
groups," Edwards said, adding
that procrastinators often learn
who else in the dorm tends to put
off work as well. They then
"hang out with each other"
instead of completing their
assignments.
Edwards also advised students
"to become a risk-taker in con
fronting those tasks that pose
some kind of threat," adding that
students are less likely to start an
assignment about which they are
unsure.
