THE ROBERT HOFSTAPTER
MEMORIAL T F.CTURE
Invited Speakers: Joseph H. Taylor, Jr.
Nobel Laureate,
Princeton University
Popular Lecture: Monday, February 27,1995
8:00 PM - Bloch Auditorium
(Physics 100)
Stanford University
"BINARY PULSAR AND RELATIVISTIC GRAVITY"
Discovery of the first binary pulsar has opened a new field of
astronomy in which the relativistic nature of gravity is tested through
precise comparisons of "pulsar time" with atomic time on Earth. The
experiments have also demonstrated the existence of gravitational
waves, as predicted by Einstein's theory of gravity.
Afternoon Colloquium: Ttiesday, February 28,1995 at
4:00 PM in Physics 101
"TIMING PULSARS FOR FUN AND PROFIT"
Both lectures are open & free to the public
for information, call (415) 723-4347
