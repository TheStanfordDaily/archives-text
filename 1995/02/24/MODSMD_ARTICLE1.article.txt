# Shoven announces comparative ethnic studies plan
## 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
The long struggle to bring additional ethnic
studies programs to Stanford reached an impor
tant milestone yesterday when Dean of Human
ities and Sciences John Shoven announced plans
to establish a new interdisciplinary program
that will allow students to major in Asian-Amer
ican Studies or Chicano Studies.
"It is my intention to establish an interdisci
plinary program in Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity," Shoven announced at yester
day's Faculty Senate meeting.
The interdisciplinary program — laid out in a
seven-page document released yesterday —
would allow students to choose a major or minor
in Chicano Studies, Asian-American Studies or
African and Afro-American Studies. The exist
ing African and Afro-American Studies program
would be absorbed into the new interdisciplinary
program. (See related story.)
If all proceeds smoothly, Shoven said, stu
dents could be declaring majors in the new pro
gram as early as next winter quarter.
Shoven's plan also calls for future establish
ment of a research institute supporting scholar
ship in the comparative study of race and ethnic
ity.
The proposed program is based on months of

study and discussion by two committees formed
last spring to examine possible programs in Chi
cano Studies and Asian-American Studies. The
School of Humanities and Sciences assembled
the committees last year after years of effort by
students, faculty and staff to bring more formal
ethnic studies programs to Stanford.

Student efforts to introduce
new ethnic studies programs
gained national attention last
May when Chicano / Latino
students staged a hunger
strike and protest in the Quad,
listing a Chicano Studies pro
gram as one of their demands.
The following week, advocates
of an Asian-American Studies
program staged a protest of

their own, disrupting a Faculty Senate meeting
and forcing its adjournment.
Shoven's presentation met with an enthusi
astic response from the senate at yesterday's
meeting. While many senate members had ques
tions about specific points of Shoven's plan, no
one vocally opposed either the general scheme or
specific elements of the new program.
"I'm feeling elated that the Faculty Senate
... would come out so unanimously in support of
this proposal," said Political Science Prof. Daniel
Okimoto, who chaired the Asian-American

Studies Committee. "I expected skepticism, op
position, but none of that surfaced in this discus
sion. Indeed, it was only enthusiasm."
"I was really happy," said junior Jerry Chen,
who has been active in the push for an Asian-
American Studies program at Stanford. "Almost
every comment was positive to [Shoven's] pro
posal."
Senate members lauded the proposed propos
al for taking an innovative, forward-looking ap
proach to ethnic studies. The program's compar
ative approach will take it to the cutting edge of
current ethnic studies scholarship, said Political
Science Prof. Luis Fraga, director of the Center
for Chicano Research.
"There is very strong intellectual interest
from a diverse set of faculty ... convinced that
the comparative method is the best way to go,"
he said.
Sophomore Lubia Sanchez, a student mem
ber of the Chicano Studies Committee, said the
new ethnic studies programs could be "light
years past what everybody else is doing."
Fraga applauded the program for "bringing
studies of race and ethnicity out of the last chap
ter of books."
"I think that this is an idea whose time has
come at Stanford," said Vice Provost for Under-


Shoven
