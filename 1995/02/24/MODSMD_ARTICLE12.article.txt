WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats filed
a new ethics charge yesterday against House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, accusing him of tak
ing an illegal gift of free cable television time.
The complaint accused Gingrich of accept
ing $150,000 to $200,000 in broadcast time
for his college class from Jones Intercable.
"It's trying to make money like any other
cable operator. Reaching out and doing that
for free would not let them stay in business
very long," said Rep. Pat Schroeder, one of
the authors of the complaint.
Gingrich spokesman Tony Blankley said
the speaker is being accused of receiving "an
illegal gift every time he makes an appear
ance on network television, because every
network has business before Congress. On

this theory, every congressman and every
president since the invention of television is
guilty."
"Mr. [Glennl Jones [owner of Jones Inter
cable 1 has substantial interests before the
U.S. Congress, including telecommunica
tions reform, cable deregulation and the
takeover of the Public Broadcasting Sys
tem," the complaint said.
Jim Carlson, spokesman for Jones Inter
cable, denied the claim. He said Mind Exten
sion University televises credit courses at
three dozen colleges and signs agreements
with the schools to keep part of the tuition.
All the televised courses are free to viewers
who do not choose to register for credit, he
said.
