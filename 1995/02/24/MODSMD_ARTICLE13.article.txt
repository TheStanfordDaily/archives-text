# Congress cuts free school lunches
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A House
committee approved a Republican plan
yesterday to undo federal policies and
programs that have fed millions of poor
children since the end of World War II
and replace them with grants to the
states.
On a party line vote of 23-17, the
House Economic and Educational
Opportunities Committee endorsed leg
islation repealing the national school
lunch and breakfast programs and end
ing a poor child's guarantee to a hot
meal at school.
The legislation folds WIC — a sup
plemental feeding program for women,
infants and children — school lunches,
nutrition assistance for children in day
care and several child care programs
into three block grants to the states.
Federal nutrition standards for
school lunches and WIC would be tossed
out, and states would be given wide lat
itude to shape their own nutrition pro
grams.

Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., the com
mittee's chairman, said the changes
would cut layers of regulations and
paperwork out of the school lunch pro
gram and give states much greater flex
ibility.
"Yes, we are going to cut and gut —
the bureaucracy in Washington D.C.,
which in turn will put more food in the
mouths of children back in our dis
tricts," said Goodling.
Under the legislation, spending on
the nutrition block grants would rise
over the next five years. But the amount
would not be adjusted to reflect eco
nomic downturns and increases in need.
Democrats said the amount falls at
least $7 billion short of what will be
needed to keep up with demand. Such a
shortfall, the Clinton administration
warned, could lead to increased malnu
trition, stunted growth and iron-defi
ciency anemia, which can permanently
reduce intelligence.
Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, a

Democrat and the chairman of the
National Governors' Association, called
the legislation the "most despicable,
mean-spirited legislative proposal that I
have seen in all my years of public ser
vice."
He predicted that children would go
hungry if it becomes law.
But Michigan Gov. John Engler, a
Republican, said Thursday that anyone
who thinks the GOP plan will give gov
ernors a license to starve children
should be prepared to back up the accu
sation by naming the offending state.
"To suggest that any governor in any
state is ready to abandon children, let
them be hungry, throw them out on the
street, is absurd," the governor said.
The measure must first clear the
House floor and it will then go to the
GOP-controlled Senate where it faces
an uncertain fate. Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., declared it "dead on arrival" and
Senate Republicans have yet to get
behind a similar plan.
