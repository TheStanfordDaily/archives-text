Dow sets record
NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks vaulted
to record highs yesterday, pushing the
Dow Jones industrial average above
the critical 4,000 barrier, as Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
reiterated the central bank's commit
ment to containing interest rates.
The blue chip index closed 30.28
higher at 4,003.33, after jumping as
much as 48 points to 4,020.49 before
paring its gains. The Dow shot
through its record close of 3,987.52,
set last Thursday.
The market headed higher at the
open, extending a rally that began
Wednesday, when Greenspan indicat
ed in testimony before Congress that
the central bank may be done raising
interest rates.
Greenspan strengthened that view
in his second day of testimony yester
day, when he said central bankers
stand ready to cut interest rates if they

detect a downturn in the economy.
The Fed has raised short-term
interest rates seven times in the past
year in a campaign to prevent rampant
inflation. The higher rates acted as a
drag on stock prices all last year
because they made fixed-income
investments a more attractive alterna
tive and posed the risk of choking off
economic growth.
"The fear of rate increases were
very much in people's minds," said
Bob Dickey, managing director of
technical analysis at Dain Bosworth.
"Greenspan's comments eased that
fear."
The chairman's remarks led many
analysts to hope that the central bank
could successfully engineer moderate
growth without undue inflation.
Heart drug approved
WASHINGTON (AP) - A Food
and Drug Administration advisory

panel recommended yesterday that
the anticoagulant drug Coumadin be
approved as a way to prevent second
heart attacks, its manufacturer said.
Coumadin helps keep blood from
clotting. It is already approved to pre
vent and treat blood clots in veins,
embolisms and other problems.
DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co.
said the FDA's Cardiovascular and
Renal Drugs Advisory Committee rec
ommended that Coumadin — known
generically as crystalline warfarin
sodium — be approved to prevent sec
ond heart attacks and complications
such as strokes.
Any change in the drug's labeling
must await final approval from the
FDA itself.
The panel acted after reviewing
studies that indicated anticoagulants
lowered the risk of death, a repeat
heart attack and strokes in patients
who had suffered their first heart
attack.
