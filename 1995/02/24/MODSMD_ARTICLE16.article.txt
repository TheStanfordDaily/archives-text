## Easier applications 
### 
March is quickly
approaching — and dead
lines for applying to sum
mer internships are passing by
fast. As undergraduates who
have sent out dozens of resumes
and cover letters already know,
many applications require letters
of recommendation from profes
sors. What they may not know is
how to go about getting them.
Students often have no clear
idea of what is the correct proto
col for asking a professor for a
recommendation. In order to
make this entire process more
manageable, the University
should consider developing a sys
tematic way for students to
request and use such letters.
A better system not only would
make the procedure less intimi
dating to students but also would
ease the burden placed on busy
professors. Currently, students
must bring relevant materials to
their professors' office hours
whenever they want to submit an

application. As a result, profes
sors may feel overworked and
could be less inclined to write rec
ommendations in the future.
Stanford should look into set
ting up a file for every student,
which would mean that he could
ask a professor to submit a rec
ommendation just once. Every
time the student needs the letter
of reference, he could simply
request that it be sent to the
prospective employer. The Career
Planning and Placement Center
already has a system very much
like this, but it can only be used
by students seeking permanent
employment.
Students who come to the
Farm understand that Stanford
is a large school. Nevertheless,
the University should try to pro
vide as many personalized bene
fits as possible. Without an effi
cient system to collect recom
mendations, Stanford students
are at an unnecessary disadvan
tage.
