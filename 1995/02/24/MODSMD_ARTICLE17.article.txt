# Farewell to 'pro fros'
## 
### 
Yet another Stanford
tradition has gone the way of
the dodo. Never again will
wide-eyed high school seniors visit
ing Stanford shift nervously after
being referred to as a "pro fro."
Never again will the best of col
lege-bound America pray silently
that they haven't gotten them
selves into more than they bar
gain«d~ for* when introduced to
Stanford "pro fro ho."
With the abolition of Prospec
tive Freshman Week in favor of the
new Stanford Admit Weekend, two
of the most beloved terms in the
Stanford lexicon are no more. We
mourn their passing.
Nonetheless, creating the first
Stanford Admit Weekend is a posi
tive step for the University. Stu
dents who have been admitted to
Stanford but have not yet commit
ted should be able to experience
the academic side of the University

— by meeting professors, visiting
classes and learning about
research opportunities — before
making their final decisions. The
new program will give admitted
students that chance, and we
applaud Stanford for offering it.
But it's clear that the Universi
ty's new direction is to emphasize
academics so intensely at the
expense of the traditions and
unique spirit that help draw bril
liant minds to the Stanford com
munity.
Planners behind the Stanford
Admit Weekend should recognize
this and ought to keep the best of
the fun events of Pro Fro Week. In
any case, they should at least come
up with as good an addition to the
unique Stanford jargon for the stu
dent visitors formerly know as
"pro fros."
Let's face it . . . calling them
SAWs just won't cut it.
