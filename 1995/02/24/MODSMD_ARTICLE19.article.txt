THE RIGHT to die is perplexing.
After all, most of us prefer to live.
We ignore Albert Camus' chal
lenge, "There is only one true philosoph
ical question and that is suicide."
Euthanasia, assisted suicide, the art
of dying, death with dignity and the vari
ations of this theme macabre are much
more complex than simply recognizing a
right to die. Individuals who may favor
recognizing rights in general should rec
ognize that this right is different.
Perhaps because of the approach of a
new millennium, accompanied by the
apocalyptic declarations that are cus
tomary fanfare, the dead, the dying,
death and dying are suddenly the subject
center stage. All around us is a sense of
triage.
Surgeon Sherwin Nuland's best-sell
ing and prize-winning book, How We Die
has appeared in paperback. Numerous
other books have been published recent
ly that explain near-death experiences,
the nature of death, its many forms, its
meaning, its prevalence, and its perma
nence. We may be a post-literate culture,
but we are reading like mad about our
collective end and individual demise.
Ultimately, a decision about death is
not about the choice that each of us
might make, for there is none. We may
pretend to have some control over the
timing and the manner, but that is, for
the most part, insignificant and at worst
illusory.
The discussions about death are

about who decides and how the judg
ment is made. Within the debate over
the quality of life lies another debate,
about the autonomy of the living.
An individual may execute a living
will, but he or she does no more than
authorize someone else to carry out the
intentions. Many institutions are com
peting for the right to do so: govern
ment, religion, medicine, law and family.
Whether a decision is made publicly or
privately, by an ostensibly objective
expert with regard to a patient or by an
admittedly attached intimate with
respect to a person, the problem is the
procedure.
Our culture of death, then, is shaped
by right to die cases. It is impossible to
create the right to die without implicitly
creating a responsibility to die. People
are encouraged to exercise their rights.
Ours, though, is a generation that
has experienced death differently, not
even as our parents did, with playmates
who might not appear for the new
school year and a guest room with a
deathbed to be visited by older relatives,
with the potential of plague and the
memory of war. Ours is Generation X,
another lost one, that sees three lives
for every quarter deposited into the
video game machine.
Ours is a generation divided and
afflicted.
The middle-class suburban family will
see all of its children grow to adulthood,
but a lower-class, inner-city family faces

crime as the leading cause of mortality,
an unnatural phenomenon but also an
unlamented fact. Or, a problem taken by
the larger world to be natural, meaning
primitive, below culture and beyond
progress â€” death as a way of life.
In a different way, the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus returns us
together to a more humble place in the
order of things. There may not be a cure
for the biological causes, but there
should be a salve for its societal symp
toms.
Even in our time, Dr. Jack Kevorkian
is not the first, nor the last, in the line of
executioners. If he and others flourish in
their trade, with all its attendant public
ity, our world will come to resemble Kurt
Vonnegut's "Welcome to the Monkey
House." In that short story, written well
before the Karen Ann Quinlan case or
the Nancy Cruzan case, Vonnegut fore
saw a society in which people were
pushed to visit their local "Federal Ethi
cal Suicide Parlor" to prevent overpopu
lation.
The right to die presents us with per
petual dilemmas of democracy. The chal
lenge is how we can communicate with
one another, how we might persuade
without coercing, and how we will decide
without damning.
