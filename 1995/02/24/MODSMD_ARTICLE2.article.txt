# Programs will emphasize humanities, social sciences

The proposed new interdisci
plinary program in Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity
will be "visionary, innovative and
trend-setting," according to a
seven-page report presented to
the Faculty Senate yesterday.
The program can do this by
being "truly comparative" and by
placing an equal emphasis on the
humanities and social sciences,
Dean of Humanities mid Sci
ences John Shoven told the sen
ate yesterday.
Shoven based his proposal on
reports from the Chicano and
Asian-American Studies com
mittees, formed last spring in re
sponse to student protests over

the issues.
Rather than establish inde
pendent departments for Chi
cano and Asian-American Stud
ies, those two disciplines — along
with African and Afro-American
Studies — will be part of the in
terdisciplinary Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity,
according to Shoven's report.
"What is being proposed is an
umbrella [program] under which
we will have separately identifi
able programs in African and
Afro-American Studies, Asian-
American Studies and Chicano
Studies," the report said.
"Within this new structure,
apart from the individual ethnic
group tracks, students could con
centrate their study across ethnic
and racial groups ... or could, with
the eventual participation of other
programs, pursue even wider U.S.
and international racial and ethnic
group comparisons," it said.
Under Shoven's proposal,
majors in the program would take

gateway courses and a common
senior seminar connecting the dif
ferent concentrations.
Students will also be encour
aged to pick a second major, he
added.
Including courses from the social
sciences as well as the humanities
will further distinguish Stanford's
new program, Shoven said. "For the
most part, ethnic studies in the
United Suites is dominated by two
areas of study — literary analysis

and history," the report said. A
cooperation of the humanities and
social sciences would make Stanford
a leader in ethnic studies programs,
Shoven said.
The program could expand,
with the involvement of social sci
ences departments, to include "a
host of important economic, social
and cultural problems that are
worthy of study and analysis," the
proposal said.
Shoven suggested discrimina

tion, immigration, welfare and
higher education as items that
could be included in the curricu
lum.
He also said he hopes to have
the curriculum in place next year.
Within the next two weeks, he said
he will appoint committees on Chi
cano Studies, Asian-American
Studies and African/Afro-Ameri
can Studies, as well as a general
committee for the program as a
whole.
