West Bank policy is a 'sustained act of state terrorism 9

ON JAN. 22, 21 Israelis were killed
in a suicide bombing at a crowded
bus-stop near Tel Aviv, an attack
that the media unanimously labeled an
act of terrorism aimed at sabotaging the
peace process. The brutality of this
attack, whose victims we mourn, is
unquestionable. Yet what most accounts
of the incident fail to consider is the com
plicity of the state of Israel in such acts of
sabotage.
Feb. 25 will mark the first year
anniversary of the slaughter of 29 Pales
tinian worshipers by settler Baruch Gold
stein in Hebron's Ibrahimi mosque.
Unlike the Tel Aviv bombing, this mas
sacre was the tragic result of army collu
sion with the settler population. Gold
stein, a reserve officer in the Israeli army,
was armed by the Israeli government.

He had a history of violent attacks
against Palestinians. Yet despite official
complaint lodged against him by the Mus
lim religious authorities, he was never
punished. As a member of Hebron's set
tler population, his violence was virtually
sanctioned by Israeli occupation policy,
which expressly forbids soldiers from fir
ing on settlers, even in their murderous
attacks on Palestinians. Following the
Hebron massacre, settlers erected an
elaborate shrine to Goldstein, celebrating
the anniversary of his death with a
memorial service paying homage to the
"righteous Jew."
Settler terrorism takes many forms. It
involves the seizure of land and depletion
of water reserves from Palestinian resi
dents, daily incidents of harassment such
as the smashing of cars, shop windows

and solar heaters as well as murderous
shootings. Even the more militant of such
crimes are seldom punished. The Israeli
human rights organization B'tselem
reports that settlers have killed at least
100 Palestinians since 1988. Yet only one
of these cases resulted in a murder con
viction.
Since the signing of the Oslo accords,
the Israeli government has continued its
efforts to bolster the settler population in
the occupied Palestinian territories. The
settler population of the West Bank and
East Jerusalem has increased 17 percent
since Yitzhak Rabin became Prime Min
ister in July 1992. Over 160,000 Jews
live in new neighborhoods in East
Jerusalem constructed to encircle the
Arab population and make Israel's
annexation of the city irreversible and

non-negotiable. Through this support for
new building, the Israeli government
lends its hand to all acts of settler vio
lence. Peace is not compatible with set
tlements, and their expansion has pro
voked Palestinians to even greater des
peration.
The ongoing closure and slow annexa
tion of the West Bank under the guise of
peace, with no serious consideration of
Palestinian interests, is a sustained act of
state terrorism that exacerbates Israel's
security problems and encourages mili
tant retaliation. If Israeli polity continues
on this path, we can only expect increas
ingly violent responses by a people who
feel they have nothing more to lose.
