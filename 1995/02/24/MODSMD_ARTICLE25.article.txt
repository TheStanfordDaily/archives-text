Stanford 71

The Stanford women's basket
ball squad (21-2 overall, 12-1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) not only
brought out the brooms for its

fourth straight win against the USC
Trojans (15-7,8-6 in the Pac-10) last
night at the Los Angeles Sports
Arena, but the Cardinal also did
some mopping, whitewashing and
meticulous buffing as Stanford com
pleted a season sweep of the Women
of Troy with a 71-52 victory.
Sophomore Kate Starbird led the
fifth-ranked Cardinal out of the 38-
24 intermission with nine points in
the first five minutes of the second
half to put the game out of reach.
Senior Anita Kaplan continued
to tear up the Trojan defense, lead

ing the Cardinal in scoring with 25
points on 11-of-22 shooting. She
also pulled down a game high 12
rebounds, a total that also ties her
career high.
The Stanford defense put the
clamp on Pac-10 scoring star Tina
Thompson for the second straight
game, holding her to only 5-of-16
shooting and eight boards, two
below her season average.
"We were trying to keep Tina
Thompson off the boards. She's
very tough and very athletic," Van-
Derveer said.
The Cardinal defense inhibited
the entire Trojan offense, limiting
USC to 29.7 percent shooting for
the game.
A 27-18 rebounding advantage
and USC foul trouble — exempli
fied by Thompson's two early fouls
— helped the Cardinal jump out to a
20 point lead in the first half. Sopho
more Vanessa Nygaard connected
on two consecutive three point shots
to extend the Stanford first-half
lead.
The Women of Troy came crawl
ing back, however, entering the
intermission with a fortunate 14-
point deficit after having been heav
ily outrebounded while shooting a
measly 26.7 percent from the floor.
The Cardinal continued to domi
nate the glass throughout the sec
ond half, ending the game with an
11 board advantage at 51-42. "I was
