# Testing volleyball's top spot
## 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
The second-ranked Stanford men's volleyball
team must squeeze hard to hold onto its role as
Pacific Division leader this weekend. Its position will
be tested against Long Beach State on Friday at 7
p.m. and the University of Southern California at
the same time on Saturday in Maples Pavilion. In
the heated race for first place, the Cardinal will have
to work hard to not lose its grip.
Stanford (6-2 overall, 3-1 in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) currently stands at the top of the
division, alongside Hawaii, with one conference loss.
The 49ers have suffered three losses and the Trojans
have fallen twice.
"This is a really big weekend," said coach Ruben
Nieves. "It's our opportunity to knock them further
down, but it's their chance to pull us down into the
middle of the pack."
The Cardinal played No. 6 Long Beach (4-3, 3-3 in
the MPSF) earlier this year in an exhibition match,
securing a sound victory. However, as this season

has progressed, the 49ers have upped their game and
come through with impressive victories, including a
win over USC.
"They're a scrappy team," said sophomore swing
hitter Matt Fuerbringer. "But they're definitely
inconsistent — they could come out real flat and
then suddenly catch fire — they're very emotional.
We're just going to have to weather it when they
catch fire."
The Trojans (5-2, 2-2 in the MPSF) entered the
season with high expectations — they returned five
starters — but have battled to maintain their No. 5
ranking. USC has also defeated a top team — No. 3
Cal State-Northridge.
"USC's a really good team," Nieves said. "Both of
these teams are like us — if things go right for them,
they can win the national championship."
All three teams are led by potential first-team All-
American hitters. Stanford's artillery is fired by
swing hitters junior Mike Lambert and Fuerbringer.
The 49ers generate much of their offense through
opposite hitter Tom Hoff, the
Trojans through opposite hit
ter Jason Mulholland.
Both Lambert and Fuer
bringer are continuing their
Ail-American performances of
last year. Lambert is number
four in the MPSF in average
kills per game with 6.59 and
eighth in hitting percentage
with .398. Fuerbringer, hitting
.327, has adjusted to the new
role of passing but continues to
put down clutch kills.
Hoff, a transfer to Long
Beach from Ohio State, contin
ues to improve in his first sea
son on the West Coast but has
already earned the respect of
the league.
"Tom's a good player," Fuer
bringer said. "He's definitely
the key to the team. He gets
frustrated sometimes with his
team's level of play and with
his new position. We definitely
have to slow him down because
they will rally behind him if he
gets hot."
Mulholland has garnered
high praise in his four years as
a starter for USC. A big and
powerful attacker who consis
tently rates in the upper eche
lons of the nation's hitters,
Mulholland leads the league in
average kills per game with
7.38. He also contributes to the

Trojan side-out machine with
his excellent passing skills.
"He frustrates lots of teams
because you know he's going to
get set, but it's still very hard
to stop him," Nieves said.
Stanford will do all it can to
not be frustrated by Mulhol
land because he will most like
ly rack up his fair share of kills
regardless of the opponent. To
contain big guns like Mulhol
land and Hoff, the Cardinal
will employ specific tactics
such as blocking schemes and
defensive positions.
"This weekend, we've got to
do two things. First, we have to
shut down some of the other
hitters on these teams who are
more containable. Second,
we've got to make sure [Hoff
and Mulholland] don't have
monster matches against us,"
Nieves said.
"We're coming off of one our
best weeks of practice in the last
month, and the teams' intensity
level is picking up. We've
improved a lot in two areas —
one, defensive effort, and two,
communication on the court.
We're hoping to be able to carry
this over into the matches."
Given Stanford's deep talent
pool and constant improve
ment, concentration and exe
cution will be the keys to victo
ry this weekend.
"If we play our best and
they play their best," Fuer
bringer said, "we're going to
win."
