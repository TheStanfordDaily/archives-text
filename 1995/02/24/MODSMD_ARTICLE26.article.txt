# Testing volleyball's top spot

### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
The second-ranked Stanford men's volleyball
team must squeeze hard to hold onto its role as
Pacific Division leader this weekend. Its position will
be tested against Long Beach State on Friday at 7
p.m. and the University of Southern California at
the same time on Saturday in Maples Pavilion. In
the heated race for first place, the Cardinal will have
to work hard to not lose its grip.
Stanford (6-2 overall, 3-1 in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) currently stands at the top of the
division, alongside Hawaii, with one conference loss.
The 49ers have suffered three losses and the Trojans
have fallen twice.
"This is a really big weekend," said coach Ruben
Nieves. "It's our opportunity to knock them further
down, but it's their chance to pull us down into the
middle of the pack."
The Cardinal played No. 6 Long Beach (4-3, 3-3 in
the MPSF) earlier this year in an exhibition match,
securing a sound victory. However, as this season

has progressed, the 49ers have upped their game and
come through with impressive victories, including a
win over USC.
"They're a scrappy team," said sophomore swing
hitter Matt Fuerbringer. "But they're definitely
inconsistent — they could come out real flat and
then suddenly catch fire — they're very emotional.
We're just going to have to weather it when they
catch fire."
The Trojans (5-2, 2-2 in the MPSF) entered the
season with high expectations — they returned five
starters — but have battled to maintain their No. 5
ranking. USC has also defeated a top team — No. 3
Cal State-Northridge.
"USC's a really good team," Nieves said. "Both of
these teams are like us — if things go right for them,
they can win the national championship."
All three teams are led by potential first-team All-
American hitters. Stanford's artillery is fired by
swing hitters junior Mike Lambert and Fuerbringer.
