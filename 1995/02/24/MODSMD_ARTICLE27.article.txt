# Gymnasts home for the weekend
## Women deal with Fullerton 
### Ben Hur Contributing writer 
It was a little more than a
month ago when Stanford fell
to the mighty Titans. The
Cardinal women gymnasts
hope tonight's story will end
differently when No. 19 Cal-
State Fullerton visits the farm
Friday evening to face No. 20
Stanford.
When Stanford met up
with the Titans during the
second week of the season, the
team suffered several break
downs on the uneven bars, a
difficulty it hopes not to
repeat this weekend.
"We had our worst bar per
formance of the year at Fuller

ton," said coach Breck Green
wood. "We have definitely got
ten better."
The bar team's strength
rests on the consistent perfor
mances of senior co-captain
Jen 6 Elzie and freshman Keri
Monahan. While the emer
gence of freshman Misty
Moore and the perseverance of
senior Meegan Lannin and
sophomore Katie Jennings did
bolster the line-up, the Cardi
nal have lost the latter two to
injuries for tonight. Lannin
suffers from a stress reactor in
her foot, which is the first
stage of a fracture and Jen
nings has battled back trouble
