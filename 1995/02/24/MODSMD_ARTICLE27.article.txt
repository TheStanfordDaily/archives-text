# Gymnasts home for the weekend
## Women deal with Fullerton 
### Ben Hur Contributing writer 
It was a little more than a
month ago when Stanford fell
to the mighty Titans. The
Cardinal women gymnasts
hope tonight's story will end
differently when No. 19 Cal-
State Fullerton visits the farm
Friday evening to face No. 20
Stanford.
When Stanford met up
with the Titans during the
second week of the season, the
team suffered several break
downs on the uneven bars, a
difficulty it hopes not to
repeat this weekend.
"We had our worst bar per
formance of the year at Fuller

ton," said coach Breck Green
wood. "We have definitely got
ten better."
The bar team's strength
rests on the consistent perfor
mances of senior co-captain
Jen 6 Elzie and freshman Keri
Monahan. While the emer
gence of freshman Misty
Moore and the perseverance of
senior Meegan Lannin and
sophomore Katie Jennings did
bolster the line-up, the Cardi
nal have lost the latter two to
injuries for tonight. Lannin
suffers from a stress reactor in
her foot, which is the first
stage of a fracture and Jen
nings has battled back trouble
all season.
Also hobbled by injury but able
to perform, freshman Christie
Jones will make her vaulting
debut against Fullerton. A stress
fracture in her back had limited
her to the uneven bars and the
beam, but she has recently gained
medical approval to vault.
"Running and landing is what
hurts," Jones said. "But as long as
it isn't getting worse, I can keep
going. I'm really excited to com
pete on vault."
Although the Cardinal will
miss Jennings on the beam, the
group has proven itself as the
strength of the squad. Senior co
captain Katie Clancy and sopho
more Ariel Passanisi will join
Elzie, Moore, Monahan and Jones
in the line-up.
Only five gymnasts will per
form on the floor exercise due to
the injuries of Jennings and Lan
nin. However, strength is not
always in numbers. Last week
against Arizona, the floor squad
— behind the amazing perfor
mance of senior Tina Snowden —
out-scored Arizona, which fielded
six competitors.
"It wasn't a problem last
week," Elzie said. "We are just
going to have to hold together
again."
Despite the rash of injuries, the
team has remained a tight unit.
"The injuries have made us
stronger," Elzie said. "These
tough circumstances have made
us closer."
The Cardinal squad feels it has

made definite progress since its
earlier visit to southern Califor
nia, and it is ready for the
rematch.
"Everyone is determined to do
well," Jennings said. "It makes it
sweeter if we beat them since we
lost to them once before."
