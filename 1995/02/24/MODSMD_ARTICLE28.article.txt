# Men play host to five squads
## 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
After nearly two months on
the road and a tough meet in
front of a packed arena of
screaming Cal fans, the Stan
ford men's gymnast team must
have one thought on its mind:
there's no place like home.
Anxious to compete in the
friendly confines of Burnham
Pavilion, the fourth-ranked
Cardinal hosts California,
UCLA, UC-Santa Barbara and
Western Michigan this Satur
day in an optionals-only compe
tition.
"The home gym advantage
should be fairly important,"
said sophomore lan Bachrach.
"At the very least, we won't
have to contend with it working

against us."
Even with the support of the
Stanford faithful, the competi
tion will be stiff. Both nationally
ranked, Cal and UCLA have
given Stanford difficulties this
season. Recently however, the
team has shown a new edge.
The squad's confidence
reached a season-high this week
after a promising showing at
Berkeley last weekend.
Although the team fell to the
Golden Bears by a tenth of a
point, their outlook is positive
coming into this weekend.
"The team is really charged
up for this meet", said freshman
all-arounder Tim Dalrymple.
"We're ready to take revenge on
Berkeley for last weekend."
Stanford is beginning to fulfill its
full potential as head coach Sadao
Hamada's vision for the team is
finally materializing. The gymnasts

are continuing to master the diffi
cult routines intended to prepare
them for the rigors of international
competition. The inconsistency that
has plagued them since the start of
the season has started to disappear.
"We're definitely making a lot of
progress," said sophomore all
arounder Jamie Ellis. "The guys are

hitting their routines with more
consistency and there aren't nearly
as many major misses."
"I think we're pretty much on
track as far as our development goes
this season," he continued. "We're
starting to look good, but we defi
nitely have a lot of room for
improvement before NCAAs."
