# Stanford men down USC

Stanford 90
USC 78

History has this nagging
tendency to make itself in the
least likely circumstances, or,
at least in last night's case,
nearly make itself.
With USC in town for the
19th-ranked Cardinal men's
basketball team 90-78 victory
last night, fans and players
alike were treated to the Tro
jans' rough and rowdy brand of
ratball which seemed to infect
everything, causing Dollies to
fall on behinds and press room
podiums to collapse to the way
side. Then again, things hadn't
been expected to be pretty, and
they weren't.
"I haven't played a clean
game against USC yet," said
sophomore point guard Brevin
Knight. "I go into these games
knowing that they're going to
be sloppy just because its their
style of basketball. They push
and foul. You just have to come
in with the [right! mindset."
So with Maples Pavilion
transformed into a garbage
dump of junkyard basketball,
the last thing you would expect
would be to have a player flirt
with history. But that's exactly
what Knight did, and it wasn't
just any small bit of inane triv
ia. If accomplished, the feat
would have set an unprecedent
ed Pacific 10 Conference mile
stone, a pinnacle unattained by
the likes of Alcindor, Walton,

Freshman Brevin Knight had an incredible game last night.
