# Stanford men down USC

Stanford 90
USC 78

History has this nagging
tendency to make itself in the
least likely circumstances, or,
at least in last night's case,
nearly make itself.
With USC in town for the
19th-ranked Cardinal men's
basketball team 90-78 victory
last night, fans and players
alike were treated to the Tro
jans' rough and rowdy brand of
ratball which seemed to infect
everything, causing Dollies to
fall on behinds and press room
podiums to collapse to the way
side. Then again, things hadn't
been expected to be pretty, and
they weren't.
"I haven't played a clean
game against USC yet," said
sophomore point guard Brevin
Knight. "I go into these games
knowing that they're going to
be sloppy just because its their
style of basketball. They push
and foul. You just have to come
in with the [right! mindset."
So with Maples Pavilion
transformed into a garbage
dump of junkyard basketball,
the last thing you would expect
would be to have a player flirt
with history. But that's exactly
what Knight did, and it wasn't
just any small bit of inane triv
ia. If accomplished, the feat
would have set an unprecedent
ed Pacific 10 Conference mile
stone, a pinnacle unattained by
the likes of Alcindor, Walton,


Teressa Trusty — Daily
Freshman Brevin Knight had an incredible game last night.
Payton and Kidd — a quadruple
double. Yes, you heard that right:
not a double-double or a triple
double, but a Q-U-A-D-ruple-dou
ble.
Unfortunately for all those
rotisserie buffs out there, howev
er, Pac-10 history was not made.
Knight literally fell inches short
with 14 points, 13 assists, nine
rebounds and nine steals. Knight's
13 dishes still set a school mark.
"How many chances do you get
to get one of those in your life, to
even get close? But [media rela
tions director and statistician Bob
Vazquez] screwed us out of the
rebound, I see here on the stats,"
joked Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery
At the outset of the game, how
ever, there was no talk of records
and even less of jokes.
"I'm just happy to get out with a
'W,' " Montgomery said. "I've been
around too long, seen this type of
game too many times, to not know
what the possibilities are.
Montgomery was referring to a

first half in which his Stanford
team (17-6 overall, 8-6 in the Pac
-10) appeared nearly as ineffective
as the last place Trojans (7-17, 2-
12 in the Pac-10).
"In all honesty, we were pretty
tired coming off the game on Tues
day," said Cardinal forward Andy
Poppink. "We knew we had to win,
there was no doubt about that, but
throughout the first half we were
trying to feel our way to see exact
ly how tough it was going to be."
It started out tough. The game
opened with USC playing a zone
defense similar to the one that
UCLA utilized to frustrate the
Cardinal. And like in that game
Tuesday night, Stanford found it
painfully difficult to get its offense
going, falling behind early 10-5.
"I would [use the zone] too
against us after seeing how we did
against UCLA," said Stanford
swingman David Harbour, who
came off the bench for 16 points.
It wasn't until one of the Cardi
nal's best shooters — junior guard
Dion Cross — sank a three that
Stanford seized its first lead 12-10.
The Cardinal never looked back
after that, but the Trojans still
kept it suprisingly close.
It wasn't until the latter part of

the second half that the Cardinal
finally regained that spring in its
step. USC closed the lead to one
with some aggressive offensive
rebounding, but a 10-0 run
allowed Stanford to break the
game open.
"Second half we got it moving a
little bit better," Montgomery said.
"We just had to move the ball. Get
some people into position. Get
some rhythm and so forth, and we
were going to be fine."
Center Tim Young led the Car
dinal attack with a quiet 18 points
in just 23 minutes off of 8-of-9 field
goal shooting even after the fresh
man big man was whistled for two
quick fouls less than three min
utes into the game.
"I got a couple of garbage bas
kets, but they still count," Young
said. The frequently flagged frosh
continued sarcastically, "I'm pret
ty used to getting called for fouls. I
structure the game around that
now."
Ironically, it was one of the 7-1
center's rebounds late in the game
that may have snatched at least a
triple-double away from Knight.
"I tried to tell Tim to the let the
rebound go, but he didn't hear
me," Knight said.
