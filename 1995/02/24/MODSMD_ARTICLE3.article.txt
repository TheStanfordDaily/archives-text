# Copy centers succumb to budget woes
## 
### Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing writer 
Seven months after the closure of Stanford's
Graphic Center, three campus copy centers will change
management March 15 because of budget problems.
Due to the change, 13 staff members will be laid off
College Enterprises Inc. will take over the existing
Document Express copy centers — located at Tresid
der Union, the Law School and the Graduate School of
Business — and buy the existing equipment from the
University.
The copy centers were run by the University as part
of Stanford Publication Services, which also included a
graphic design and consulting service. The Graphic
Center, which employed 19 people, was shut down last
August due to a large budget deficit.
Over the past three years, Publication Services has
lost University funding and the copy centers and the
Graphic Center were made into self-supporting units,
said University Communications Director Terry Shep
ard.
Currently, the copy centers face a huge operating
deficit — in fiscal year 1994 they lost $85,875, or 5 per
cent of their annual revenue.
"We would need to make $200,000 more next year
just to break even and that's not feasible. We have to get
the University out of the business," Shepard said.
"It's a difficult business to compete in because it's
technolotrv-driven." he added.
College Enterprises will inter
view the laid-off staff members
for possible positions with the
new copy center, Shepard said.
The University will also provide
them with training to increase
their chances of re-employment.
"We're trying to do everything
we can," he added.
Employees have a variety of
opinions on the centers' closure
and the subsequent layoffs, said
Brenda Sepolen, administrative
assistant at Document Express.
"We have a mixture of reac
tions. For some it's a benefit
because they're near retirement
age, but for others this creates a
lot of anxiety in their lives,"
Sepolen said.
"I understand [the layoffs!
from a strictly business stand
point, but working closely with
the staff who can't afford to lose
their jobs right now, my heart
goes out to them," she added.
College Enterprises is a special
ist in the copying field and the
University will be contracting
their services, as it does with Stan
ford Hair Styling and Bon Appetit

in Tresidder, Shepard said.
"The new vendor, because it is
both expert in university copying
and serves nearby businesses ...
can provide the campus with bet
ter quality, useful new services
and economies of scale," Shepard
said.
"I think the change is for the
better. The new company has the
resources to provide better ser
vices from both a faculty and stu
dent standpoint," said Rick Sey
bold, manager of Document
Express.
College Enteiprises plans to
offer more services to students in
the future, including digital scan
ning, custom t-shirts, resume ser
vices and black-and-white laser
printing.
The new copy service will be
allied the Pulse Copy and Tech
nology Center and is part of an
existing chain of copy centers on
college campuses such as UC-San
Diego, UC-Santa Barbara and
use.
Previous problems with the
quality and the turn-around time
of copies should be ameliorated
under the new center, Shepard
said.
"Hopefully, we'll have better
service and better quality of
work," he added.
