# Copy centers succumb to budget woes
##

Seven months after the closure of Stanford's
Graphic Center, three campus copy centers will change
management March 15 because of budget problems.
Due to the change, 13 staff members will be laid off
College Enterprises Inc. will take over the existing
Document Express copy centers — located at Tresid
der Union, the Law School and the Graduate School of
Business — and buy the existing equipment from the
University.
The copy centers were run by the University as part
of Stanford Publication Services, which also included a
graphic design and consulting service. The Graphic
Center, which employed 19 people, was shut down last
August due to a large budget deficit.
Over the past three years, Publication Services has
lost University funding and the copy centers and the
Graphic Center were made into self-supporting units,
said University Communications Director Terry Shep
ard.
Currently, the copy centers face a huge operating
deficit — in fiscal year 1994 they lost $85,875, or 5 per
cent of their annual revenue.
"We would need to make $200,000 more next year
just to break even and that's not feasible. We have to get
the University out of the business," Shepard said.
"It's a difficult business to compete in because it's
technolotrv-driven." he added.
