# Knight does it all against the Trojans
## 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
On a night when both Stanford and USC had
trouble getting anything done, Cardinal point guard
Brevin Knight stepped up and decided to do a little
bit of everything.
Finishing the night with 14 points, 13 assists,
nine rebounds and nine steals, the sophomore
missed the Pacific 10 Conference's first quadruple
double in history by the narrowest of margins.
Poised on the edge of achieving this loftiest of goals
during the game's last 5 minutes, 38 seconds,

Knight was unable to get either of the final legs of
the record-breaking stat line as the Cardinal defeat
ed the Trojans 90-78.
"They told me that I needed another steal and
another rebound, and I tried my hardest to get that
steal," Knight said.
With just under a minute left and the game
locked away as a win for Stanford, he had three
legitimate shots at that elusive 10th steal. Lurking
behind the Trojans' Lorenzo Orr deep in the corner,
the smile on Knight's face reflected his wish for the
6-foot-7 forward to bring the ball to
his waist for the quick pick.
After Orr cleared the ball to the
top of the key, Knight got another
chance as he poked it loose. Howev
er, he couldn't find the handle as
the ball squirted out of bounds.
Always persistent, Knight had one
more look at number 10 as he
stripped guard Brandon Martin
but was called for a reach-in foul.
"After that I quit," he said. "It
wasn't meant for me to get that
triple-double."
Knight's steadying presence
broke down numerous Trojan zone

defenses to find the open shot. The
13 assists mark both a school
record and a career high for
Knight.
"I needed to go out and do some
thing to get us going," he said. "I
put a little extra effort into the
game."
As of last night, there have only
been nine triple doubles recorded in
the history of the Pac-10. Stan
ford's only triple double came from
Andrew Vlahov in the opening
round of the 1991 NIT against
Houston. While wins are of the
most concern for both the Cardinal
and Knight, such a close brush with
immortality will definitely linger
with him for quite some time.
"When I go home tonight, it'll
hit me," he said.
