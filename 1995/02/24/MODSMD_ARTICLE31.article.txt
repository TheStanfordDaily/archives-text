# Six-Pac schedule begins with UCLA
## 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Stanford's 12th-ranked base
ball team has been waiting all
year for today to arrive.
The Cardinal (9-6) begins its
quest to repeat as the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division
(Six-Pac) champion when it
travels to UCLA's Jackie Robin
son Stadium to open conference
play against the Bruins (7-4) in a
three-game series this weekend.
"Everyone's primary focus
this year is on the conference
race," said junior All-American
catcher A.J. Hinch. "Our
league's the toughest league in
the country and if we plan to
repeat as champions, we're
going to have to be focused. Our
season starts today."
Early losses have hurt Stan
ford — the nation's preseason
No. 1 team — and the Cardinal
looks to get back on track
against a UCLA team that it
dominated in 1994. Stanford
took five of six games from the
Bruins a year ago, including a

three-game sweep at Sunken
Diamond last May that put the
Cardinal in position to clinch the
conference title.
Left-handed junior Dan Reed
(1-2), who pitched two complete
game victories against UCLA a
year ago, will start for the Cardi
nal tonight, facing off against
Rick Heineman (2-1) at 7 p.m.
Stanford come 3 off it's most pro
ductive offensive game of the
year after banging out 17 hits
and 15 runs against the Univer
sity of San Francisco on Tues
day.
"Everyone on the pitching
staff knows that regardless of
what's going on with the bats,
we have to do our jobs," said
freshman hurler Kyle Peterson
(2-0). Peterson — who should
start on Sunday — was named
Pac-10 Pitcher of the Week after
beating both Cal State-Los
Angeles and Santa Clara.

the hill for the Cardinal looking
to continue his success against
the Bruins. Middlebrook tossed a
complete game no-hitter against
UCLA last season, striking out 14
Bruins along the way, to record
the seventh no-hitter in Stanford
history.
Southpaw sensation Jim Par
que (1-1), just a freshman, will
start for UCLA against Middle
brook. Parque has emerged as the
ace of the Bruins' staff, striking
out 22 batters in just 18 innings
of work in 1995.
Coming off a sub-par 22-36
year in which UCLA finished
next-to-last in the Six-Pac, the
Bruins hope to reclaim their posi
tion among college baseball's
elite. UCLA has earned post-sea
son berths in five of the last nine
seasons and is looking to return
again in 1995.
Offensive production has
never been a problem for the Bru
ins, who carry another potent
line-up into 1995. UCLA boasts
six players batting over .300 on
the young season and eight of the
line-up's nine hitters top .263. As
a team, UCLA is hitting .287 and
averaging over six runs a game.
Only nine upper-classmen
return on a UCLA squad that
lists 23 freshmen and sopho
mores on its roster. With the
departure of several key players
from last year's squad, a host of
fresh faces have been cast into
key roles.
Leading the list of newcomers
is third baseman Troy Glaus, who
was named a pre-season All-
American by Baseball America
before ever setting foot on a col
lege diamond. Glaus — who was
chosen in the second round by the
San Diego Padres — was the
highest draft pick to turn down a

pro contract.
Glaus has actually managed to
live up to his astronomical billing
through the season's first ten
games. The freshman from San
Diego has started every game for
the Bruins, carrying a .342 hit
ting clip into this evening's con
test. He has already racked up 10
runs batted in and belted three
home runs — the same number
Stanford has accumulated as a
team through 15 games.
"UCLA is a real young team,"
Hinch said. "They've got some
great talent and they've added
some new guys that are highly
touted. We know that we have to
come to play if we expect to win."
Another UCLA freshman,
Pete Zamora, has also made the
transition from high school to
Division I look like a walk in the
park. Zamora, the Bruins' start
ing first baseman, is batting .359
with 10 RBIs so far this season.
But the freshmen aren't the
only Bruin sluggers that have
been red hot. Senior shortstop
Gar Vallone, who finished as the
seventh best hitter in the league a
year ago, carries a .381 clip into
the Stanford series. Sophomore
sensation Tim Dicenses adds
another .300 bat to the UCLA
order, looking to cement himself
into an All-American spot. And
the Bruins are accomplishing all
of this without the services of
their best hitter — center fielder
Brett Schafer — who was hitting
.571 before going down with an
arm injury after five games.
All in ail, it adds up to a power
ful UCLA line-up that could turn
the Cardinal's conference-open
ing dream into a nightmare.
"How we do all depends on
which team shows up," Hinch
said. "We have the ability to win
— both pitching-wise and offen
sively. But, if we play the way we
have over the first 15 games, we
very well could finish last in our
conference."
