### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Stanford's 12th-ranked base
ball team has been waiting all
year for today to arrive.
The Cardinal (9-6) begins its
quest to repeat as the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division
(Six-Pac) champion when it
travels to UCLA's Jackie Robin
son Stadium to open conference
play against the Bruins (7-4) in a
three-game series this weekend.
"Everyone's primary focus
this year is on the conference
race," said junior All-American
catcher A.J. Hinch. "Our
league's the toughest league in
the country and if we plan to
repeat as champions, we're
going to have to be focused. Our
season starts today."
Early losses have hurt Stan
ford — the nation's preseason
No. 1 team — and the Cardinal
looks to get back on track
against a UCLA team that it
dominated in 1994. Stanford
took five of six games from the
Bruins a year ago, including a

three-game sweep at Sunken
Diamond last May that put the
Cardinal in position to clinch the
conference title.
Left-handed junior Dan Reed
(1-2), who pitched two complete
game victories against UCLA a
year ago, will start for the Cardi
nal tonight, facing off against
Rick Heineman (2-1) at 7 p.m.
Stanford come 3 off it's most pro
ductive offensive game of the
year after banging out 17 hits
and 15 runs against the Univer
sity of San Francisco on Tues
day.
"Everyone on the pitching
staff knows that regardless of
what's going on with the bats,
we have to do our jobs," said
freshman hurler Kyle Peterson
(2-0). Peterson — who should
start on Sunday — was named
Pac-10 Pitcher of the Week after
beating both Cal State-Los
Angeles and Santa Clara.
In Saturday's contest, sopho

Middlebrook (0-3) will take to

Freshman Kyle Peterson won Pac-10 Player of the Week honors
with a gutsy performance. The team travels to UCLA this weekend.
