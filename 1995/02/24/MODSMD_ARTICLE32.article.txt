# Grapplers head to Pac-10 championship
## Cardinal wrestlers hope to surprise conference foes in Corvallis 
### Ratha Harntha Staff writer 
Forget what has happened so far this season,
because everything that matters to the Stanford
wrestling team will be determined today and
tomorrow at the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships in Corvallis, Ore.
The Cardinal (3-5 overall, 3-3 in the Pac-10) is
coming off a third place finish at the All California
Tournament in San Francisco on Feb. 4 and a
narrow 20-17 loss on Feb. 12 at 10th-ranked Cal
State-Bakersfield, the highest ranked team in the
Pac-10.
"In the past there has always been a dominant
team," said head coach Chris Horpel. "This year,

it's more spread out."
Traditional powerhouses Oregon and Oregon
State have had some troubles during their dual
meet seasons because of injuries. Oregon State,
who started the year ranked third in the nation,
has five returning Pac-10 champions. The Cardi
nal lost to the Beavers, 26-18, on Jan. 28 but came
back on the very next day to stun Oregon, 21-15.
"We can place higher than we have in the
past," senior co-captain Jay Jackson said. "It'll be
tough to win but we'll surprise some teams."
Last year, Stanford finished eighth and no
Cardinal placed higher than fourth. Only three
athletes, Jackson and juniors Jimmy Aguirre and
Tod Surmon, have qualified for the NCAA Cham
pionships. To qualify, a competitor must finish in

the top three in his division or obtain one of the
eight wild card bids by finishing fourth or fifth
and earning enough votes from the Pac-10 coach
es.
"The team is as ready as it has been all sea
son," Horpel said. "Six athletes have a legitimate
shot to qualify for the NCAAs."
Jackson, who will move up a weight from 134
to 142 pounds, defeated last year's champion,
Oregon's Cory Sonnen, 6-4, in sudden-death over
time earlier this year. His 6-5 victory over Bake) Â»-
field's Tony DeSouza, who was the No. 1-ranked
wrestler in the Pac-10 at the time, makes him the
top seed at 142 pounds.
