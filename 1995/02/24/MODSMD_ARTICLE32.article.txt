# Grapplers head to Pac-10 championship
## Cardinal wrestlers hope to surprise conference foes in Corvallis 
### Ratha Harntha Staff writer 
Forget what has happened so far this season,
because everything that matters to the Stanford
wrestling team will be determined today and
tomorrow at the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships in Corvallis, Ore.
The Cardinal (3-5 overall, 3-3 in the Pac-10) is
coming off a third place finish at the All California
Tournament in San Francisco on Feb. 4 and a
narrow 20-17 loss on Feb. 12 at 10th-ranked Cal
State-Bakersfield, the highest ranked team in the
Pac-10.
"In the past there has always been a dominant
team," said head coach Chris Horpel. "This year,

it's more spread out."
Traditional powerhouses Oregon and Oregon
State have had some troubles during their dual
meet seasons because of injuries. Oregon State,
who started the year ranked third in the nation,
has five returning Pac-10 champions. The Cardi
nal lost to the Beavers, 26-18, on Jan. 28 but came
back on the very next day to stun Oregon, 21-15.
"We can place higher than we have in the
past," senior co-captain Jay Jackson said. "It'll be
tough to win but we'll surprise some teams."
Last year, Stanford finished eighth and no
Cardinal placed higher than fourth. Only three
athletes, Jackson and juniors Jimmy Aguirre and
Tod Surmon, have qualified for the NCAA Cham
pionships. To qualify, a competitor must finish in

the top three in his division or obtain one of the
eight wild card bids by finishing fourth or fifth
and earning enough votes from the Pac-10 coach
es.
"The team is as ready as it has been all sea
son," Horpel said. "Six athletes have a legitimate
shot to qualify for the NCAAs."
Jackson, who will move up a weight from 134
to 142 pounds, defeated last year's champion,
Oregon's Cory Sonnen, 6-4, in sudden-death over
time earlier this year. His 6-5 victory over Bake) »-
field's Tony DeSouza, who was the No. 1-ranked
wrestler in the Pac-10 at the time, makes him the
top seed at 142 pounds.
"The wins have given me a lot of
confidence but the past doesn't mat
ter," said Jackson, who leads the
team with 26 victories this year. "I'll
be smaller [than most of my compe
tition), but I can compete at this
weight."
Aguirre, who won the Pac-10
two years ago and holds a 12-1
record this season, will wrestle at
134 pounds. To win another title,
Aguirre will have to get past Ore
gon's Babak Mahammadi, the
defending champion and second
ranked wrestler in the nation, and
No. 3 Steve St. John from Arizona
State, who was last year's runner

up and champion three years ago.
Surmon competes in one of the
toughest divisions with six athletes
having a legitimate shot to win the
division. Arizona State's Jeff Thail
er, last year's Pac-10 runner up and
second-ranked wrestler in the
nation, is the top seed.
"I'm in the best shape of my life,"
Surmon said. "I'm feeling very con
fident and I can beat any one of
them."
Juniors Matt Cano (126 pounds)
and Sahlan Martin (158 pounds),
and sophomore Bryan Vaniman
(190 pounds) also have solid
chances of qualifying for the NCAA
Championships, according to Hor
pel. Cano's 23 wins and only nine
losses place him second for team
points.
"We're looking amazingly solid,

especially [in the 126- to 158-pound
divisions]," Surmon said. "Any one
of us can make the finals."
The only set back for the Cardi
nal right now is the back injury to
sophomore Roger Liu. Freshman
Matt Von der Ahe will move up a
weight division to 177 pounds to fill
in for Liu.
Juniors Brian Mcßeth (118
pounds) and Mark Ryzewicz (167
pounds) and freshman heavyweight
Mark Neglay round out the 10 Car
dinal wrestlers who will compete
this weekend.
"Someone [outside of the top six
wrestlers] would really have to
wrestle out of their minds [to quali
fy for the NCAAs]," Horpel said.
"Von der Ahe could surprise some
people and Ryzewicz has the poten
tial to do damage if he's on."
