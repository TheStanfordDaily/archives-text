# Women linksters fourth in Tucson
## 
### John Lawson Contributing writer 
The third-ranked Stanford
women's golf team spent the
first three days of this week at
the Randolph Park North Golf
Course in Tucson, Arizona,
where it battled against some of
the best teams in collegiate golf
at the Conquistadores/Chris
Johnson Arizona Invitational.
But for the Cardinal and 17
other teams who entered the
tournament, it was almost as if
their clubs were never given a
chance to leave the bag.
That's because they had to
watch No. 1-ranked Arizona
State destroy the field with a
final margin of victory that was
larger than any in recent mem
ory.
After three rounds of compe
tition, ASU finished with a
team score of 872, an amazing
48 strokes below its nearest
competitors, South Carolina
and Wake Forest (tied at 920).
In NCAA golf, five players
compete in every round of a
tournament. The highest indi
vidual score for each round is
dropped, and the final team
score is tabulated by adding the
remaining four golfers' scores
together.
The Cardinal ended in a tie

for fourth with the University
of Oklahoma, shooting its way
to a 923. It was the team's
worst showing of the school
year, a season in which it won
three of its first five tourna
ments including the Santa
Clara Invitational last week in
Monterey.
But there should be no great
cause for concern, according to
head coach Tim Baldwin. "We
played ASU in the fall and
almost beat them," he said.
"But they have had perfect
weather since Christmas, while
ours has left something to be
desired. They've put in six
weeks of good practice, while
we've been practicing irregular
ly. Combine that with the fact
that our course is under repair,
and I'd say they're about six
weeks ahead of us in all phases
of the game."
"But the course is almost
ready and the weather is only
getting better, so we'll hopeful
ly have caught up to them sig
nificantly by April when the big
tournaments start rolling
around," Baldwin said.
The Pacific 10 Champi
onships are scheduled for the
end of April and the NCAAs are
slated for the end of May.

A Cardinal batter takes a poke at a pitch earlier this season. Stanford's
offense failed to materialize during Wednesday's double-header.
Individually for the Cardinal,
sophomores Andrea Baxter and
Mhairi McKay placed in a tie for
18th place out of 101 golfers

with scores of 230. Following
closely behind were seniors
Jamille Jose (231), who tied for
24th, and Amy Lawrence (232),
who tied for 26th. Junior Vicky
Strada rounded out the Stan
ford lineup finishing in a tie for
67th with a score of 242.
The Sun Devils showed their
dominance as all five of their

golfers finished in the top nine,
including the first two spots.
"We knew Arizona State was
going to play really well," said
Lawrence, "and we were a bit
rusty. If I had to give us a grade,
I'd probably give us a C."
ASU will strut onto the Farm
next weekend to compete
against the Cardinal and other

golfing powers such as No. 2
San Jose State and No. 4 Tulsa
University in the annual Stan
ford Women's Intercollegiate,
another three-round event.
"We have the talent and a
team that's balanced enough to
give ASU a run for their
money," Baldwin said. "All we
need now is time to practice."
