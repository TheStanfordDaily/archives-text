The Stanford softball team,
displaying the strong pitching
and solid defense that the Cardi
nal hopes will become trademarks
this season, split a doubleheader
Wednesday against UC-Davis (5-
3). In two pitching duels, Stan
ford (5-7) took the first game 1-0
and lost the second game 2-1.
Freshman phenom Jessica
Schulman (3-3) recorded her
third complete-game shutout of
the season in game one, holding
the Aggies scoreless in spite of
allowing 10 hits. Due to Stan
ford's struggling offensive attack,
Schulman has been unable to win
this year without holding her
opponents scoreless. Kris Kirchn
er (2-2) took the loss for the
Aggies.
The game was easily the most
dramatic that the Cardinal has
played this year, with both teams
unable to score in seven innings
of regulation play. Finally, in the
bottom of the ninth inning, fresh
man third baseman Dawn Kobata

singled to lead off the inning. Fol
lowing a sacrifice that advanced
Kobata to second, Schulman
came to the plate and helped her
own cause with a single to left.
Aggie left fielder Sue Gundersen
misplayed the hop, allowing
Kobata to score the game's only
run.
"It was just a great game all
around," said Stanford head
coach Sandy Pearce. "It was a real
tight ball game, with excellent
pitching by both teams. Our
defense held tight and we were
able to pull it out in the ninth."
In an attempt to add some
offensive punch to the Cardinal
attack, Pearce shuffled the Stan
ford lineup for the first time this
season prior to the start of game
two. Shortstop Summer Lee, the
Cardinal's leading hitter, was
moved from the third spot to the
leadoff position, while former
leadoff hitter Amanda Renteria
dropped to eighth. First baseman
Caryn Okinaga moved up from
the fifth spot to replace Lee.
"We tried to change things up
a little bit, and it worked to some
extent," Pearce said. However,
the lineup change did not dramti
cally improve run production as
Stanford only scored once in the
second game.
The Aggies took the early
lead, scoring a single run in the
top of the third inning. Stan
ford tied the game in the fifth
with an unearned run. Howev
er, the Cardinal failed to capi
talize on the gain in momentum
as the Aggies came right back to
take the lead for good with an
unearned run in the top of the
sixth.
"We got an outstanding
pitching performance from
Angela Webb," Pearce said, not
ing that the game was close all
the way and Stanford had sev
eral chances to pull it out in the
last two innings. Webb gave up
one earned run in seven
innings, allowing six hits and
walking one batter.
With the loss Webb fell to 1-4
on the year; Gena Weber (3-1)
got the win for the Aggies. In
seven innings, Weber struck
out eight Cardinal batters while
walking three.
The split provides reason for
optimism for the Cardinal,
which has already matched its
win total from all of last year.
In only its second year as a var
sity sport, the team has
improved dramatically in a
short time.
"We're playing well," says
Pearce. "We're a young team
and we'll continue to improve."
