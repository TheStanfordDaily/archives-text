So it's one of those bonus beautiful
February days where spring teases
everyone with its cleavage — a day
that would be downright perfect if it
weren't for two-hour sections and the
out-of-shape Sigma Somethings playing
frisbee golf with their shirts off — and
I'm walking my advisor to his office.
He's a tall, yet brilliant man (I like to
think there's an inverse proportion) with
lots of eyebrows. We're talking about
senior year.
"And what are you going to do next
year?" he asks finally. Everyone does.
"Doing? Umm. . . well with any luck
I'll be here."
"Oh, that's right, you're doing the
five-year plan."
"Plan?" I say, a little too proud of my
irresponsibility. "There's no plan
involved here."
At this he smushes his fuzzball brows
together and I wonder if that's just how
it works: the older men get, the more
they rely on their eyebrows for expres
sion.
As I cover, poorly, with, "I suppose I'll
end up with a job sooner or later," one of
those new briefcase-toting, almost-late

hyperseniors — blatantly en route to an
interview — passes by, being worn by a
crisp new suit.
"Be just like this guy, will you?" my
advisor says.
"Would that be so bad?"
"Would you hire him?"
"Not with that tie."
"Me neither. It's awful, those are the
kinds you only wear when your kids buy
them for you and then you have to. Poor
guy is so determined to sell himself over
he doesn't even remember how to dress
the part. Let's see what he's up to."
So my advisor calls over to the scurry
ing figure being worn by a crisp new suit.
"Where are you taking him?" he asks.
"Excuse me?" whimpers the student.
"Oh, I'm sorry," he says,"I was asking
your suit. Where are you taking him?"
"Who me?" answers the suit, "I'm tak
ing him to an interview for a monster 1.8.
firm."
"Investment banking? Do you know
what investment bankers actually do?"
"Not really," says the suit, "but as far
as I know, no one does. Only investment
bankers know what they do and most of
them aren't even too sure. But they make
bucks and that means new friends — silk

friends — for me. If we make the second
round I'll get worn in New York City."
"Not bad. But how do you figure syn
thetic fibers will fare in the harsh winter
weather?"
"Hadn't thought of that. Still, it
should be a fun trip. Listen, I'd love to
chat but I've got to get him in on time."
"No problem. Good luck," my advisor
says and then turns to me. "You see?"
"I'm confused. Are you saying, that I
should or shouldn't have the hem length
ened on my Bar Mitzvah suit and do the
interview circuit?"
"And endure all that groveling?"
"It's not groveling, it's pragmatism."
"Yeah, that blind faith and stagnation
will get you two steps closer to Enlight
enment and social change any day."
"Since when did you do sarcasm?"
"One of my grad-students just wrote a
paper on it — I'm giving it a test run.
What do you think?"
"Wonderful. I love it. More."
"Really?"
"Uh-huh. So then what? I should just
putz around the rest of my life, rack up
co-term after co-term degree until the
Messiah comes and buys me an Icee?"
"No," he says. "Just be determined to

spend your time in ways worthy of your
cranial capacity. Let me ask you, what
good would a job do you now?"
"I guess money comes to mind."
"No," he corrects, "money comes with
a mind. When you make these deceptive
ly large decisions, presume the finances."
"I'm not following."
"Well I've got a faculty meeting in a
few minutes so let me just preach."
"Sing it sister."
"When you choose, pick something
that allows you to spend your time doing
whatever it is that makes you feel like
you are changing the world for the bet
ter. Pragmatism is a only a ladder for
short people; then it becomes a hurdle.
Now I'm sorry you're short but you are
also someone who can do better than that
yutz with the tie. Pretty much anyone is
except for whoever picked it out for him."
"Did one of your grad students just
write a paper on cryptic metaphors?"
"Don't interrupt, I'm being pithy.
Don't scare yourself into wasting the lit
tle time you have before Alzheimer's or a
car accident or whatever changes your
mind to cottage cheese. Find a job that
suits you, don't suit a job that binds you.
Don't even buy a suit if you can avoid it."

"I should be writing this down.
This is great stuff."
"Thank you. But I mean it. You kids
come through here with these minds and
these ideals, but somehow you leave only
with the minds and trade the ideals in for
32 grand a year plus signing bonus."
"Then what should I do?"
"Who am I to say? You tell me." He
stops and thinks. "Hmm, don't you do
some writing for the school paper? That
Daily thing?"
"Sometimes."
"Well there's a start. One can do a lot
of good from behind a typewriter."
"Actually, we use computers now."
"That's right, I forgot I was old."
"The official term is old fart."
" 'Old fart,' got it. Hard to stay on top
of everything," he says and then adds,
"Well I've got to run, thanks for the tip."
And the old fart waves me goodbye and
skips — not walks, but skips — towards
his office, tripping over his eyebrows as
he goes. I watch him skip and trip away
and I figure, "Yeah, I'd hire him."
