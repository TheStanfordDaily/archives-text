# Digital library project puts it all on-line

### Martin L. Yeung Contributing writer 
Getting a copy of Milton's "Paradise
Lost" on a Saturday night when the
libraries are closed may no longer be a prob
lem for students next year if all goes well
with Stanford's new integrated digital
library project.
For the last six months, Stanford has been
among a select group of universities involved
in designing a system that will provide stu
dents access via computer to everything from
complete transcripts of books to video docu
mentaries and databases from any library in
the world.
The new service will be different from
existing computerized information research
programs because it will allow a user to "par
allel search" several databases at once. The
goal is to simplify the way students do
research.
"Not only would you be able to retrieve
entire books on-line, but you would be able to
watch programs and view diagrams without
having to step foot in the library," said
Andreas Paepcke, senior research fellow in
the Department of Computer Science and the
project's manager.

According to Paepcke, the new system will
allow the user to "focus more on the task
than battling the technology."
"We demonstrated a prototype of the pro
gram, called the 'information bus' [Wednes
day]. The program was able to search
through three separate databases simultane
ously," Paepcke said.
Most databases currently can only be
accessed on an individual basis and searching
through each one for related information can
be time-consuming and tedious.
But the "information bus" being devel
oped now would increase efficiency dramati
cally by running through every database that
was linked into the system at once, Paepcke
said.
The $24-million project is a part of a coor
dinated effort by three federal agencies —
the National Science Foundation, the
Advanced Research Project Agency and
NASA — and six major research universities
to create a comprehensive digital on-line
library and information network.
Each of the universities was given a spe
cific aspect to work on. Using a $3.6-million
grant for the project, Stanford is responsible
for developing the coordinating programs
that will link the subsidiary programs being

developed at the five other participating uni
versities — UC-Berkeley, UC-Santa Barbara,
University of Michigan, University of Illinois
and Carnegie Mellon.
In a statement, Hector Garcia-Molina,
professor of computer science and electrical
engineering, said the project will coordinate
a "difficult variety" of databases and on-line
services.
"We intend to develop a common environ
ment that links everything from personal
information to library collections to large
research databases," Garcia-Molina said.
The information bus consists of basic con
cepts, language and protocols that can coor
dinate materials, services and users of infor
mation.
Special programs — called protocol
machines — will be developed for specific
libraries. These will translate between the
subsidiary digital library and the "informa
tion bus." Special client interfaces will be
developed that will connect the user to the
information bus.
Stanford's role in the integrated digital
library project is being shared by several pri
vate-sector companies, including Xerox Palo
Alto Research Center, Bell Communications
Research and Hewlett-Packard Co.
