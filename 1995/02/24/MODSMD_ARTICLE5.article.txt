# Stanford victory brings money
## $5M received in court ruling 
### Kiran Srinivas Contributing writer 
After a lengthy dispute with the Chrisitan
Science Church last week the University fi
nally took possession of 23.5 percent of the
$20-million bequest left by Eloise Mabury
Rnapp.
Knapp, whose sister attended Stanford,
had requested in her will that her estate be
given to the Christian Science Church, which
is based in Boston, provided that it met re
quirements she set.
The will's primary contingency was that

the Church widely distribute a book written
by Knapp's brother-in-law. Otherwise, Stan
ford and the Los Angeles-based Museum As
sociates were to become equal beneficiaries of
the estate.
During the lawsuit they fded, the Univer
sity and the Museum Associates argued that
the Church had not met the conditions of the
will.
The three parties were able to resolve the
dispute in court — with the Church getting
53 percent of the estate, and the other two
groups settling for 23.5 percent
each.
The newly acquired $5 million
has not yet been allocated into the
University budget. The decision as

to where the money will go will be
made by the Provost's Office,
according to Assoc. General Coun
sel Iris Brest.
"The original settlement
ended in January 1993," Brest
said, "but the actual distribution
of the money just recently
occurred."
Knapp had no direct ties to the

University, but her sister Bella
Mabury attended Stanford in its
inaugural year in 1891.
And Bella Mabury — who wrote
her will in the same manner that
her sister did — had an estate val
ued at nearly $75 million. So,
assuming the University reaches a
similar agreement in this case, it
could receive yet another $17 mil

lion.
Brest said the Mabury case is
currently under appeal but is still
in the preliminary stages. "The
appeals have not yet been
briefed; they should be filed with
in the next two months," she
said.
Eloise Mabury Knapp died in
1973 and her sister died in 1964.
