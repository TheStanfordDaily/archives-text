# Clinic therapy helps couples, families cope with problems
## 
### Yvonne Chiu 
A couple sits in chairs neatly arranged in a
small, nondescript white room. The mirror
on the wall hides an observation room on the
other side.
This is the site of the Couples and Family
Therapy Clinic at Stanford, a program Dr.
Douglas Rait of Stanford's Department of
Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences started
two years ago.
Rait, director of the clinic, began the pro
gram so that Stanford employees and gradu

ate students could gather for counseling on a
variety of problems, ranging from unsatisfy
ing marriages to conflict to coping with med
ical problems.
"There is always a need for therapy," Rait
said. "Many couples are referred to us within
the department from individual therapists or
from contracts with their insurance compa
nies."
Rait came to Stanford from New York
three years ago to develop a "system-wide
training program working with
couples and families." He is now
based at the Palo Alto VA Hospital,
the "birthplace of family therapy,"
according to Rait.
Stanford's clinic, however, is
much smaller than the Palo Alto
Hospital's, staffing two psychiatry
residents, two psychologists — one
of whom is a trainee — a psychi
atric nurse and Rait.
"The purpose of therapy is to
create a focus for the couple or fam
ily," Rait said. "We solicit each per
son's perspective of the problem."
In therapy, he added, the therapist
can also directly observe problems
and patterns with the couple or
family. "Therapy is a series of
experiments where we recommend
alternatives to present behavior."
Common problems include
making more time for one's spouse,

power struggles among two strong
people and life transitions, such as
birth, death or illness. "Or one
partner wants more closeness, and
the other responds with withdraw
al," Rait added.
Couples come in for pre-marital
counseling, or sometimes they will
decide to divorce after counseling.
"But that is not always bad," Rait
pointed out.
Allen Maloney, senior resident
at the Stanford clinic, sees therapy
as a process of getting to know the
therapist and discovering what is
available. "It's an exploration of
the issue and understanding their
own influence on the problem,
their ability to change, how to
change."
Typically, the couple meets with
the therapist in a small counseling
room. Sessions are often video
taped so the therapist can review
and renew his focus on the couple's
or family's problems. Other thera
pists watch through the two-way
minor, of which the patients are

aware.
At the first session, the thera
pist meets with the patients to
determine the problem as well as
review past attempts at solutions.
"We don't need to reinvent the
wheel," said Barbara Yates, fourth
year resident and doctor of psychi
atry at the Stanford clinic. "We
need to make a link — establish
trust, the ability to talk with the
patients — and most importantly,
give hope."
A therapist's goal is not neces
sarily to cure, Yates added. "Some
times it's to relieve pain, helping
them with the problem, getting
them to stable ground. And some
times you see things that won't
change."
Yates also sets up ground rules,
"to make sure they know they have
to do the work," she said. "We can't
change them. They have to change
themselves."
Though therapy is usually effec
tive and the University clinic has a
very high satisfaction rate, Rait

stressed that the responsibility
ultimately rests on the patients.
"We see the couple only one hour a
week. They have the rest of the
week to do what they normally do."
Therapists must be careful
when dealing with violent and abu
sive relationships, Rait added.
"Putting two people in such a rela
tionship in the same room without
each having his own treatment
provides them with the context to
continue the abuse," he cautioned.
Maloney said he does not see
himself as a counselor; rather, he
said, he is a therapist. "I try to use
people's language in order to relate
and get them to see the solution
themselves." But sometimes peo
ple need structure, he added.
Maloney emphasized that ther
apists have their own strong
suits, which each tries to match
with those of the patients. "For
example, someone focused on the
here and now will get no benefit
from speaking in the theoretical,"
he said. "You have to adjust."
