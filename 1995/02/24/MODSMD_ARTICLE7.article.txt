# No mango madness: Snapple to be pulled
## Supplier costs too pricey to continue sale in residences, University claims 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
Stanford students may no
longer be able to purchase "the
best stuff on earth" with their
meal cards, now that University
Housing and Dining Services has
discontinued the purchase of
Snapple from its supplier.
Housing and Dining Services is
waiting to find a "better deal," said
Operations Manager of Finance
Craig Mitchell.
"We are not recouping the full
expenses" of purchasing and sell
ing Snapple, Mitchell said. That,
he said, is different from losing
money on the product.
Until this quarter, Snapple
used to sell for $1.65 per bottle.
After "numerous complaints,"
Mitchell said, Dining Services re
evaluated the price and lowered it
to $1.30 at the beginning of the
quarter.
But the lower price was not
cost-effective. At the higher price,
Snapple is "marked up enough to
cover overhead expenses," he said.
"We can't afford to sell at the
lower price."
Some students, though, ex

pressed skepticism at Dining Ser
vices' rationale.
"What a crock," said freshman
David Butts, a resident of Wilbur
Hall. "They could buy it at retail
and sell it for a buck a piece."
Mitchell refused to comment on
the wholesale price of Snapple,
saying only, "Our costs are very
strange."
At Tresidder Express Conve
nience Store in Tresidder Union,
Snapple is sold for $ 1.05 per bottle,
and convenience stores off campus
sell it for even lower prices. At
Safeway, the beverage costs $3.19
for a four-pack — approximately
80 cents a bottle.
Mitchell said that Dining Ser
vices' higher prices are the result
of additional costs like labor, elec
tricity and sanitation.
In the meantime, he said, Din
ing Services is working "as fast as
possible" to fmd a solution. If Din
ing Services finds that selling
Snapple is not economically feasi
ble, they will consider purchasing
substitute products like Fruitopia
and Arizona Iced Tea. There is also
a possibility that if Snapple re
turns, some flavors may not be
available.
Still, Mitchell said, there will
continue to be Snapple on dining
hall shelves until Dining Services'
stock runs out.
Some dorms, however, are
already experiencing a Snapple
shortage. "We're pretty much out
of it," said Wilbur Executive Chef
Andre Mallie.
The popular iced-tea drink was
actually gone in Wilbur last night,
after one student, upon hearing
the news, decided to buy the
remaining stock, said hasher
Chou Yang, a freshman. Stern
Hall's Late Night was also Snap
ple-less yesterday.
Council of Presidents member
Mork Murdock said that if many
students express an interest in
having Snapple in their dining

halls, the COP would take
action.
The subject was not brought
up, however, at last night's Din
ing Services Student Advisory
Board meeting.
Several students said they are
not too disappointed about Dining
Services' decision to stop selling
Snapple.
"It doesn't really matter to me.
1 can always buy Snapple at Safe
way. It's cheaper there anyway,"
said freshman Pedro Fernandez,
who was hanging out at Late
Night yesterday.
However, freshman Robert
Ochoa — an avid Snapple fan who
mentioned he once had five cases
of the flavored drink in his room
— said he is "devastated" by the
decision.
"Food service should really
have the decency to give us what
we want, considering that they
already rip us off so much,"
Ochoa said.
