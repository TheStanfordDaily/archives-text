# 'Saturday Night Live' history revealed
## Author Doug Hill discusses past, present, future of show 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
In a behind-the-scenes look at the legendary com
edy show, Doug Hill, co-author of the book "A Back
stage History of 'Saturday Night Live,' " last night
vividly revealed the moods, people and problems of
"Saturday Night Live" in a combination of video and
speech.
"Saturday Night Live" was the "first television
program that consciously set out to be revolution
ary," Hill told the audience in Annenberg Auditori
um. It "came in with the attitude that old television
had to be despised and destroyed."
This attitude was reinforced in producer Lome
Michael's casting choices. The infamous John
Belushi was just one such example.
According to Hill, Belushi entered the interview
dressed in a sweatshirt with stains and holes and cir
cled the office screaming, "What am I doing here? TV
sucks."
Even though Belushi told Michaels that he had
only one black-and-white television — which was
covered in spit — he was hired.
Since pilots didn't exist, NBC executives were
outraged over "Saturday Night Live," Hill said. But
they could neither stop it nor control it.
NBC's prime time schedule "went into the toilet"


Jonas Celebiler— Daily
In an Annenberg address last night, "Saturday Night Live" expert
Doug Hill discusses the pinnacles and problems of the show.
during the show's first season, Hill
said, and "Saturday Night Live"
was allowed to stay on even though
its ratings were terrible. Contrary
to popular belief, Hill said, the
show did not even hit marginal rat
ings until its third season.
"Saturday Night Live" also
"scared NBC into submission."
Cast members openly smoked pot
in their torn-up offices — which
were equivalent to "frat houses"
— and when NBC officials walked
in, the cast offered them a smoke.
The show was also made up of
"very tough-looking people" like

Dan Akroyd, Hill said.
Akroyd made friends with the
"local chapters of Hell's Angels"
and "wore full biker regalia," Hill
said, and often got into fist-fights
with guards since he kept forget
ting his entrance pass.
When Akroyd received a memo
demanding $400 for expenses
incurred during the Emmy
Awards ceremony, he decided to
teach NBC a lesson. Hill said
Akroyd "created a mural" with
paint, markers and "some sort of
large chiseling tool."
On the mural, Akroyd wrote
phrases like "I will kill you, Rick,"
"I am Beelzebub." NBC was
forced to quickly cover it up and
they never asked Akroyd for
money again, Hill said.

Early episodes of "Saturday
Night Live" also contained a lot of
drug humor that is rare nowadays,
Hill said. The popular Coneheads
skit was created under the influ
ence of magic mushrooms.
"There has never been a show
as chaotic .. . and out of control as
'Saturday Night Live,' " Hill said.
To many people, Hill said, the
show lost its innocence when
Chevy Chase — who had left after
the first season — came back. Bill
Murray, who had replaced Chase,
began making nasty comments
and there was a general atmo
sphere of tension which culminat
ed in a fight five minutes before
the show, Hill said.
The incident "changed a lot of
people's confidence in the show,"

Hill said. Then, after Michaels
left, the show deteriorated until
Eddie Murphy rose to stardom.
Murphy had been hired as a
token black, Hill said, but he was
able to make it to a cast member
because of his "amazing explosion
of talent." Murphy, Hill said, was
the only good thing about the
show for those two seasons.
Nowadays, although Michaels
has returned, the show isn't doing
that well, though it has some
"great stuff," Hill said. The show
has lost its original mission and
the atmosphere behind the scenes
is deadly, Hill added.
The show is "more of a busi
ness" now and it has "become too
institutionalized," Hill said. "Its
future is more tenuous now."
