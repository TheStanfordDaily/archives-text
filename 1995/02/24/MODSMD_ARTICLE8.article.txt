### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
In a behind-the-scenes look at the legendary com
edy show, Doug Hill, co-author of the book "A Back
stage History of 'Saturday Night Live,' " last night
vividly revealed the moods, people and problems of
"Saturday Night Live" in a combination of video and
speech.
"Saturday Night Live" was the "first television
program that consciously set out to be revolution
ary," Hill told the audience in Annenberg Auditori
um. It "came in with the attitude that old television
had to be despised and destroyed."
This attitude was reinforced in producer Lome
Michael's casting choices. The infamous John
Belushi was just one such example.
According to Hill, Belushi entered the interview
dressed in a sweatshirt with stains and holes and cir
cled the office screaming, "What am I doing here? TV
sucks."
Even though Belushi told Michaels that he had
only one black-and-white television — which was
covered in spit — he was hired.
Since pilots didn't exist, NBC executives were
outraged over "Saturday Night Live," Hill said. But
they could neither stop it nor control it.
NBC's prime time schedule "went into the toilet"
