DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED A YEAR AGO?
SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 25 MARKED THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE HEBRON MASSACRE
THE MADNESS MUST STOP
♦ April 9, 1948: Menachem Begin's Irgun terrorists attacked
Deir Yasin, a small Arab village, killing 252 villagers for the
sole reason of initiating a mass exodus of Palestinians from Palestine.
♦ Between 1948 and 1967 more than 385 Palestinian villages were
destroyed, being replaced exclusively with Jewish settlements. Israel
destroyed 19,000 Arab homes for undisclosed security reasons.
♦ September 8,1972: Israel launched massive air strikes against Palestinian
refugee camps and Arab villages in Syria and Lebanon, killing thousands, mostly
civilians.
♦ January 27,1988: Yitzhak Shamir praised the army policy of beating Palestinian
protesters saying, "our task now is to put the fear of death into the Arabs of the territories."
♦ February, 1988: CBS taped a forty-minute incident of five Israeli soldiers using hard rocks
to break the shoulder, back, and elbow bones of two handcuffed Palestinians. One minute
of the incident was shown to the American public.
♦ The September 23,1991 issue of the New York Times reports "U.S. Aid to Israel: $77 Billion Since
'67." America gives $3 billion each year to Israel. That's about $1000 per Israeli civilian and $9000 per
Israeli soldier per year, both of which are more than most Americans get from their own government.
♦ Despite the "peace treaty" of December 1993, Jewish settlement construction continues in the West
Bank and around Jerusalem.
♦ February 25,1994: A mosque full of Muslim worshippers at dawn prayer were massacred by an
America-Israeli citizen named Baruch Goldstein.
♦ February 19,1995: Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said that occupation forces had arrested lately
about 2400 Palestinians in the West Bank. Rabin confirmed that his authorities have detained more than
6000 Palestinian prisoners, and affirmed that his government has no intention of releasing them. Why?
