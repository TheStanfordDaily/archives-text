learned about Dr. Jacobs from one of my

the man who invented the Viterbi Decoder. Turns
out they started their own company in San Diego."
Andy has been with QUALCOMM for nearly five years.
He's seen it grow from close to 100 employees to more
than 1,800 today. m "Our success isn't just from
developing better technologies but also from creating
products that sell. We're going places fast." t
QUALCOMM products and systems include the highly
successful OmniTRACS® satellite-based mobile

phones. Personal Communications Systems (PCS), Low Earth
Orbit (LEO) satellite communication system and much more.
Another big plus for Andy is QUALCOMM's Flex-Time policy. He can set his own hours, making
it easier for him to hoop it up after work with his favorite sport. % If your major is
