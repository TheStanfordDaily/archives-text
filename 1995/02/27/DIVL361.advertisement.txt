For fast relief from the nagging ache of taxes, we
recommend TIAA-CREF SRAs. SRAs arc tax
deferred annuities designed to help build additional
assets —money that can help make the dillercnce
between living and living urll after your working years
are over.
Contributions to your SRAs are deducted from
your salary on a pre-tax basis. That lowers your
current taxable income, so you start saving on taxes
right away. What's more, any earnings on your SRAs
are also tax-deferred until you receive them as income.
That can make a big difference in how painful your tax
bill is every year.
As the nation's largest retirement system, we offer
a wide range of allocation choices — from TIAA s
traditional annuity, with its guarantees of principal
and interest, to the seven diversified investment
accounts of CREF's variable annuity. What's more,
our expenses are very low,* which means more of
your money goes toward improving your future
financial health.
To find out more, call our planning specialists at
I 800 &42-'2BBB. We'll send you a complete SRA
information kit, plus a free slide-calculator that shows
you how much SRAs can lower your taxes.
Call today —it couldn't hurt.
