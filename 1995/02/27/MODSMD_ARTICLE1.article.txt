The body of an approximately
60-year-old white male was found
hanging from an oak tree on cam
pus late Friday afternoon.
According to Stanford Police
Sgt. David Lee, the victim — a
Menlo Park resident with no
Stanford affiliation — appears to
have committed suicide.
"A male bicyclist was riding his
bicycle through the eucalyptus
grove off Lasuen Street near Ar
boretum Road and he observed a
gentleman hanging by a rope
under a tree," Lee said.
The body was found near a blue
car, he added.
Police would not release either
the victim's or the bicyclist's iden
tity. Lee said he did not know if

the bicyclist had any Stanford af
filiation.
Upon discovering the body, the
bicyclist rode over to Stanford
Stadium, where he called the po
lice, Lee said. Police officers met
the bicyclist at the stadium and he
led them to the body.
The victim was discovered a lit
tle before 5 p.m. on Friday, Lee
said. The elderly man did not
leave a suicide note at the scene of
death, he added.
"No signs of foul play were noted
at the scene of death," Lee said. He
added that the Santa Clara County
Coroner's Office is investigating
the cause of death. This is a stan
dard procedure, Lee added.
"For all intents and purposes it
appears to be a suicide, based on
the condition of the scene," Lee
said.
