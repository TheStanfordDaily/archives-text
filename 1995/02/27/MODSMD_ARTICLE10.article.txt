## Violence escalates in Somalia 
### 
MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP)
— Rival clans battled each other
with mortars, machine guns and
light arms near Mogadishu's air
port yesterday in a possible pre
view of Somalia's future after the
departure of U.N. peacekeepers.
With a U.S.-led military coali
tion poised just offshore, the
fighting also offered a taste of
what American and Italian
Marines might face in the com
ing days as they guard the with
drawal of the last U.N. soldiers.
About 50 U.S. Army special
forces soldiers already are ashore
to help the remaining Pakistani
and Bangladeshi troops complete
preparations to leave under the
coalition shield.
"This is the the heaviest fight
ing since the second day sifter we
got here," said Capt. Joe Bovy of
Arlington, Va., as he watched the
battle from a heavily sandbagged
bunker atop an abandoned three
story building inside the airport.
"This is a prelude," said Staff
Sgt. Matt Mutarelli of Philadel
phia, who came to Mogadishu
with Bovy and other special
forces soldiers on Feb. 8. "We've
been expecting this."
A stray mortar shell exploded

on the airport tarmac only a few
hundred yards from one of two
chartered Boeing 747s that
arrived yesterday to ferry 920
Pakistani troops back to Islam
abad, the Pakistani capital.
Somali factions have jockeyed
for months for strategic posi
tions near the air and sea ports
— expected to be the focus of
fierce fighting once the last
peacekeeper leaves.
Another stray shell, either a
mortar or rocket-propelled
grenade, impacted near the tem
porary office of the United
Nations' special envoy to Soma
lia. No injuries were reported
from either explosion.
Stray bullets had American
and Pakistani troops and U.N.
civilians ducking and staying
under cover a good part of the
day, but the only injury was to a
Somali policeman, who was not
believed seriously wounded.
At least one Somali clansman
was killed in the fighting that
erupted just outside the airport's
main gate, and the level of fight
ing suggested there probably
were more casualties.
The Dutch humanitarian
group Memisa — one of the very

few aid groups still operating in
the anarchic country — said yes
terday that one of its aid workers
was shot and seriously wounded
in a southwest Somali town. A
Somali worker for the group was
also hit by a bullet.
The shooting occurred Satur
day when eight gunmen burst
into the group's offices in Garba
Harre, near Kenya's border,
where the group ran a hospital.
More than 350,000 people
died from disease, starvation and
clan warfare before a U.S.-led
coalition force arrived in Somalia
in December 1992, stopped the
looting of relief supplies and
began moving food to the needy.
The United States turned the
humanitarian mission over to
the United Nations in March
1993.
About 2,000 American and
Italian Marines will come ashore
in the next few days to form a
rear guard for the remaining
2,400 Pakistani and Bangladeshi
peacekeepers, the last remnant
of a U.N. force that once num
bered more than 30,000.
The exact date and time the
operation will begin is being kept
secret.
