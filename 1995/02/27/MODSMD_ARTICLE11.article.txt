BEIJING (AP) â€” China and the United States
averted a major trade war yesterday by signing a com
prehensive agreement putting teeth into Chinese laws
protecting copyright, trademarks and patents.
The agreement capped 20 months of "often very dif
ficult negotiations," said Deputy U.S. Trade Represen
tative Charlene Barshefsky.
"This is a strong agreement for American compa
nies and American workers," President Clinton said in
a statement issued by the White House.
"This agreement will eliminate practices that have
cost Americans over $1 billion a year in high-value
exports. It will mean thousands of jobs for Americans
in key industries, including computer software, phar
maceuticals, agricultural and chemical products, books
and periodicals, and audiovisual products," Clinton
said.
The steps include establishing a nationwide task
force to raid businesses engaged in piracy, review busi

ness records, destroy goods and equipment, and order
closure and criminal prosecution.
Beginning on March 1, China is to begin a six
month special enforcement period during which it is
supposed to raid all suspected pirates, particularly
those engaged in illegal production of compact discs,
laser discs and CD-ROMs.
Chinese customs agents will be granted greater
powers, including border seizure and destruction of
pirated goods.
In the first year, China is to make quarterly reports
on its progress, followed by semiannual reports in fol
lowing years.
The agreement also gives American producers of
intellectual property greater access to the Chinese
market. American movies will no longer be restricted
by quotas, and audio-visual firms can enter into Chi
nese joint ventures to produce and distribute their
products.
