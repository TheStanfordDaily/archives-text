Blimp pilot falls to death
HAYWARD (AP) — A man fell from a blimp and
died, leaving the craft floating at the whim of the
winds for several hours before it landed itself yester
day.
The man fell as the pilot was attempting to land
earlier in the day at Hayward Air Terminal, about 20
miles southeast of San Francisco, a witness said.
Terry Bar, an airport technician, said the blimp's
owner was giving pilot lessons when the craft came in
too low for a landing and hit a berm at the end of the
runway.
The student was able to escape, but the instructor
somehow ended up hanging outside the crafl and lost
his grip, Bar said.
The blimp had floated up to about 10,000 feet,

where a helicopter monitored it and air traffic was
diverted around it until it finally settled to earth sev
eral hours later.
