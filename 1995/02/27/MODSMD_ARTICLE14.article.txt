KUDOS IS DUE for the selec
tion of William Perry as the
1995 Commencement
speaker.
For years, students have been
clamoring for a "big name" as
their graduation speaker. Gradua
tion, they said, is a celebration for
the students. If the students want
fame, fame they should get.
For years, University President
Gerhard Casper has said he wants
the Commencement speaker to be
connected to Stanford. Like it or
hate it, this argument has its per
suasive points. At any rate, it is
law when it comes to the selection
of speakers.
How happy, then, when a speak
er can be chosen to satisfy both cri
teria. As secretary of defense,
Perry is certainly famous enough
to please any student. As an alum
nus (Perry received his bachelor's
and master's degrees from Stan
ford) and a professor of engineer

ing-economic systems, he satisfies
the requirement for a Stanford
connection as well as anyone
could.
The Senior Class presidents and
Casper should look back on 1995
every year as an example of a great
compromise. There is no need to
have annual clamor for David Let
terman followed by bitterness over
the selection of Kirk Varnedoe.
Perry proves that we can have our
cake and eat it, too.
More important, however, is the
fact that Perry should make a
great speaker. He is a thoughtful
man with broad knowledge about
military and economic affairs. His
speech should be compelling
whether he chooses to address
international issues or his own
experiences at Stanford — or, most
likely, to combine the two. Perry's
Commencement address is some
thing which every senior can look
forward to.
