# Where is Taco Bell?
## 
### 
THE FOOD at Tresidder is
not bad, especially as cam
pus eats go. Even the vari
ety passes the "usual college fare"
test. But there is something miss
ing.
For some time, the Stanford
community has been promised
the arrival of a Taco Bell on cam
pus. While this food may not jibe
with the appetites (and health
concerns) of some, there are those
who desperately want a Burrito
Supreme and not more empty
promises. In fact, few fast food
fans have more fervor than those
loyal consumers of Taco Bell.
Why? Because Taco Bell is ideal
for students. The new value menu
fits even the tightest of college
budgets. The beverages are all
you-can-drink. And every once in
a while, if you buy enough food,
you can also pick up a cool CD.
Much to our disappointment,
however, Stanford claims that
health and other regulations have

made the originally planned loca
tion too expensive. But the Uni
versity now claims to have found
a feasible alternate site. Accord
ingly, students should be able to
make a run for the border, with
out crossing the Palo Alto city
line, by next fall. This will coin
cide nicely with the probable
unveiling of the "new" mini steak
burrito (which, of course, was the
"new" steak soft taco and the
"new" steak fajita in seasons
gone by).
While its hard to imagine how
a health regulation could ever
cause problems for Taco Bell,
Stanford should follow through
on this new plan as soon as possi
ble. Students should demand no
less. Stanford's somewhat iso
lated location does have its
advantages. But for Taco Bell
fans weary from the journey
down El Camino, a campus outlet
would give that isolation one
sorely needed amenity.
