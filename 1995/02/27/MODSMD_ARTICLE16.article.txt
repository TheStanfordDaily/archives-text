Now is the time for students to make their voices heard

STANFORD STUDENTS can no
longer afford to detach them
selves from political reality. For
too long, too many students have cho
sen to remain politically apathetic by
not voicing their opinions. We are urg
ing students to make a conscious
effort to look beyond the distorted
rhetoric and instead, educate them
selves on the real issues. Regardless of
how you define yourself politically,
there are significant changes taking
place which will have a severe impact
on the young people of America. How
much do you really know about the
legislative agenda of the new conser
vative majority in Congress? Are you
aware of the consequences these pro
posals may have on your ability to
finance your college education? The
spending cuts advocated by the Repub
licans appear necessary to many, but

who will really bear the brunt of these
changes?
Clearly, the conservatives have to
cut programs to make good on their
promise to balance the budget. But at
what expense? And who will suffer? If
the Republicans follow through with
their plans to cut the federal govern
ment, the most vulnerable members of
society will carry the burden of such
reforms. These members are those
lacking political resources such as
extensive organization, political action
committees, lobbyists and other forms
of political clout. We as the young peo
ple of this nation, from underprivi
leged kindergartners to college stu
dents on financial aid, are the most
vulnerable to the Republican attack on
social programs.
The Republican "Contract on Amer
ica" could require a $13 billion cut in

student aid programs over a five-year
period. The House budget committee
seems poised to eliminate the Stafford
Loan interest exemption and many
campus-based aid programs. This
would come at the cost of $10 billion
over the next five years — charged to
college students. Conservatives have
threatened to dismantle the national
service program — Americorps —
characterizing it as "a bunch of kids
sitting around singing 'Kumbaya.' "
Another part of the Republican attack
on education is the elimination of
$105 million from the Head Start pro
gram and $140 million from the Cor
poration for Public Broadcasting.
What did Big Bird ever do to them?
In addition to the majority's effort
to slash 20 percent of a summer jobs
program, the Republicans have also
pledged to cut AIDS research and bilin

gual education. Do these proposals dis
turb, even anger you? If you choose not
to express your concerns regarding this
trampling of the underrepresented, the
conservatives will accept that as a man
date for such actions. Let your voice be
heard. You are not powerless in the
American political process. Your sena
tors and representatives will respond to
you. Educate yourself. Inform yourself.
Take action if you don't like what you
see. Through immediate mobilization
and collective action, we will protect
the future of this nation. Write, call or
e-mail you representatives. You can
reach your representatives at (202)225-
3121.
