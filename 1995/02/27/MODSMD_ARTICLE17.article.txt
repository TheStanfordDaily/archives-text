# Letter which attacked Sixth Man Club was 'admirable piece of art'
## 
### 
Thursday's letter attacking the
Sixth Man Club, written by Michael
Jones and Joshua Groban, caused
quite a controversy in my dorm. Some
thought that no one could be moronic
enough to write that letter and that it
must be a joke; others disagreed, sug
gesting that, at Stanford, anything is
f>ossible. Personally, I consider the
etter to be an admirable piece of art,
in which Jones and Groban weave a
beautiful web of arguments which are
alternately absurd and incoherent.
I do not wish to demean the totality

of this masterpiece by analyzing its
component parts, but I think that the
elegant stupidity of the authors is
readily apparent if we consider a few
of those claims which can be made
sense of: reserved seating is compara
ble to slavery and fascism; if reserved
seating must exist, we should take
measures — perhaps a mixture of
racial, gender, and sexual-orientation
quotas — to ensure that the composi
tion of the Sixth Man Club is a reflec
tion of that of the Stanford communi
ty; when Stanford attempts to make
money (perhaps to prevent cuts else
where), it would be best to donate all
profits to charity; shame on Halftime
(for advertising or serving alcohol?);
and the practice of reserving some
prime seats in an arena for those will
ing to pay extra is an embarrassment

to Stanford, while the presence of
"men of the people" Jones and Groban
is not.
It is true, the authors could simply
have sent in a one-line letter to the
effect of "Waah!" But the long-winded
manifesto of our peasant leaders is a
much more effective battle cry. Why
should some be allowed to buy movie
or airline tickets in advance? I hate it
when those arrogant fat cats just
waltz on board a plane, ticket in hand,
their smiles mocking those of us who
are on stand-by. And why should
exploitative capitalist pigs be permit
ted to rent luxury boxes at sporting
events, when those boxes could be
given to us "common folk." Why
should those cocky bastards who
reserve a limousine have their ride
home from the airport guaranteed

while the rest of us have to wait in
line for a cab? People shouldn't be
able to purchase anything with money
that we serfs can't have too. It's
unfair, it's unjust, it's racist and sex
ist and homophobic.
No, fellow students, I don't think
we should judge Jones and Groban too
harshly. Their letter may look like the
pathetic ravings of two hysterical
whiners. But we must look below the
surface, we must trust that they were
admitted for a reason, and we must
recognize that they are misunderstood
artists. They have captured perfection
— the perfectly worthless letter —
and held it up for all to see. Thank
you, comrades, and may our revolu
tion succeed!
