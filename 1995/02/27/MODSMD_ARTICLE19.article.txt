## Lessons from the Lorax 
### 
Unless someone like you cares a whole
awful lot,
Nothing is going to get better. It's not.
— Dr. Seuss, "The Lorax"
HOW IS IT that once we get to a
place like Stanford we forget the
simple lessons of youth? It is cer
tainly true that we progress beyond the
days of afternoon naps and quiet evening
stories in our parents' laps. Our world
becomes one of engineering, government
policy and the intricate know-how we
obtain in the years beyond Dr. Seuss.
But astute observers cannot deny that
the world we've fabricated with the stuff
of SATs and GREs just isn't working like
it could be. Just one of our social mal
functions — the ailing environment —
makes me wonder what we've done to life
around us. Perhaps the missing link is
found in the simple lessons of those
evening stories.
Somewhere along the line, caring
about Truffula Trees got left out of econ
textbooks. Someone forgot to include
"The Lorax" in your course reader. For
the sake of those powerful truths of days
gone by, let's reconstruct that story as an
allegory for 1995. ...
Enter the Onceler (that greedy
entrepreneur who is down on his luck).
With profit on his mind, he chops down
those Truffula Trees to make a quick
buck. Out of a stump, an oldish and
mossy cute little guy pops onto the stage.
Forcefully objecting, this is our Lorax —
the environment's wise sage. The Onceler

just ignores him. He's too busy making
his Thneeds, those wonderful do-dads
that everyone needs.
Soon the whole family's there, chop
ping and marketing and sending the stock
prices up. But the Lorax, he's there, oh he
never gives up. He Speaks for the trees
and the Brown Bar-ba-loots. Today he'd
stomp in the boardrooms of the men in
dark suits. The Onceler ignores him, he
seems not to hear. He's got to look good in
Fortune at the end of the year.
In the end, shortsightedness and quick
gains on investment rule the day. All this
in spite of the Lorax — our Sierra Club,
Greenpeace and EPA. The Swomee-
Swans fly away and Humming-Fish must
flee. It's because of unfettered growth in
the e-con-o-my.
So the words go unheeded and caring's
left out. The chopping continues 'til the
Earth's all petered out. What's left is
smog in the air and Gluppity-Glup in the
stream. The linear market economy's all
out of steam. The Lorax ... he leaves
'cause the world's such a mess. Just like
today, the only hope left is one word,
unless....
Oh, how I'd love to be a Lorax one-on
one with the CEO of DuPont. I wouldn't
be demanding or confrontational. I'd just
ask him one simple question: Don't you
care?
The simple lessons to live by may be
gathering dust in the forgotten bookcases
of our childhood. The one-liners from our
parents and simple maxims like the Gold

en Rule could lead us away from the
messes we face. In our world of 15-page
papers and future Nobel Prizes for things
not yet discovered, we tend to forget what
we've already heard. Simplicity is seldom
our focus.
I couldn't help but be surprised by the
reacUon at Flicks last quarter when "The
Lorax" played as a short. Everyone hissed
the Onceler and cheered for the Lorax.
My fellow Stanford students — you know,
tomorrow's high school teachers, CEOs,
presidents — were standing up for the
Truffula Trees. Was it just a silly story we
praised? Was it just the entertainment
value that brought our hands together? I
wonder if the simple lesson whizzed over
our heads faster than the second theory
of thermodynamics.
Perhaps not. Perhaps we can listen
today like we did when we took afternoon
naps and wouldn't eat our vegetables.
Perhaps we're capable of answering the
question if we really need a Thneed.
Plant a new Truffula. Treat it with care.
Give it clean water. And feed it fresh air.
Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that
hack.
Then the Lorax and all of his friends may
come back.

If Aaron is elected president he will read
Dr. Seuss at Cabinet meetings.
