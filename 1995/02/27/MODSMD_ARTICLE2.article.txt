# Panel addresses CIV effectiveness
## 
### Pamela Phan Contributing writer 
At a time when the Faculty
Senate is considering widely de
bated reforms to the Cultures,
Ideas and Values program, stu
dents and faculty questioned Fri
day whether CIV adequately pre
pares freshmen for dealing with
multiculturalism in the outside
world.
About 20 people attended the
forum on "Cultural Differences in
the CIV Tracks" to discuss issues
ranging from multiculturalism
within the Stanford community to
future reforms in CIV.
History Prof. Mark Mancall, di
rector of the program in Struc
tured Liberal Education, present
ed four major concerns about
teaching CIV.
Mancall said he is concerned
about teaching world cultures
from a Western perspective, the

concept of "depth of culture," the
impact of historical knowledge on
cultural perceptions and the prob
lem of how to teach a text or an
idea.
Mancall said he realized that
SLE has not done much with the
issue of multicultural diversity.
Its objectives have been "to decen
ter our students," rather than to
teach them about cultural diversi
ty, he said.
Renato Rosaldo, chair of the
Anthropology Department, said
CIV should aim to teach students
that there are other "centers" of
culture besides the dominant
Western perspective.
"It should be about centering
and decentering," he said.
Speaking from a student's
point of view, James, an an
thropology major, said that he
sees a major problem in the Uni
versity curriculum.
"CIV, despite its efforts to
multiculturalize, has failed," he
said. It attempts to place multi
cultural issues into an already
existing hierarchy without realiz
ing there is something fundamen
tally wrong with the structure as
a whole, he said.
James said CIV falls short of
providing Stanford students with
the tools needed to understand
the world in which they live.
Patty Tsai, a co-terminal stu
dent in the School of Education,
saw her experiences in the
Europe and the Americas track as
positive ones. She was "happy"
with her CIV track because it
exposed her to writings "more rel
ative to my life as a woman of
color," she said.
Multiculturalism, Tsai added,
is not about studying cultural
groups as separate and distinct
entities. "You have to evaluate

the relations of power," she said.
"I'm scared to death of this
whole multiculturalism idea,"
Mancall said. "The argument of
multiculturalism we're so focused
on has deflected focus away from
[other issues such as] economics."
He added that because of this
deflection, "we are surrendering
our independence and freedom to
the ruling classes at the Universi
ty."
Another problem created by the
current debate over CIV reform is
that "people are trying to take the
[multiculturalism] challenge and
marginalize it by throwing it all
into CIV," James said.
The University is currently in
the process of redefining the CIV
program as a result of a recom
mendation by the Commission on
Undergraduate Education last
October. In its final report, the
commission urged that steps be
taken to restore "common intel
lectual experience" to the CIV
program.
The Faculty Senate will dis
cuss proposed changes to CIV at
its March 9 meeting.
