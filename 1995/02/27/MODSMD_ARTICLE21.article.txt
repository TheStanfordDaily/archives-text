series and be in first place right
away. Hopefully, we'll never look
back."
Carver's heroics capped an
impressive and gutsy rally by the
Cardinal on the road in the ninth
inning. Freshman designated hit
ter Jon Schaeffer — who reached
base all four times he came to the
plate on Friday — led things off
with a walk. An Eric Sees'
groundout moved Schaeffer, who
avoided a tag in the basepaths, to
second before second baseman
Brian Dallimore struck out.
With Stanford just one out
away from dropping their first
Six-Pac game of the season and
UCLA's top closer, Bobby
Kazmirski, set to slam the door,
center fielder Cale Carter shocked
everyone in attendance by laying
a bunt down the first base line.
Carter narrowly avoided the tag
from first baseman Pete Zamora
to keep the Cardinal's hopes alive.
All-American catcher A.J.
Hinch then walked on four pitch
es, bringing Carver to the plate in
a situation he had only dreamed
of.
"I was really surprised by the
way they pitched to A.J. and I was
excited to have the opportunity,"
Carver said. "I fell behind quickly
0-2 and I new that he had a domi
nant slider. I looked for the slider
and he got it a little bit up. I just
tried to put the ball in play."
Carver didn't put the ball in
play, but he went one step better,
sending the Kazmirski pitch high
over the left-field wall for an
opposite field home run. Carver's
long ball gave the Cardinal its

The 12th-ranked Stanford
baseball team traveled to the land
of stars, glitz and glamour and
put on a three-game show with
UCLA that even Hollywood's best
producers couldn't have equaled.
The Cardinal (11-7 overall, 2-1
in the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion) took two of three games
from the Bruins (8-6,1-2 in the
Six-Pac) in a dramatic conference
opening series that would have
made Jack Nicholson's heart skip
a beat. Stanford edged UCLA 6-5
in the opener before the Bruins
exacted revenge with an 8-6, 10-
inning victory on Saturday. The
Cardinal captured the rubber
game of the series 2-0 yesterday
afternoon behind another great
performance from freshman Kyle
Peterson.
Friday evening's conference
opener seemed more fiction than
reality as junior third baseman
Steve Carver took a page from
Roy Hobbs in the"The Natural,"
giving the Cardinal one of its
most dramatic wins in school his
tory.
With Stanford just one strike
away from defeat and the Bruins
leading 5-2, Carver launched an
0-2 slider 380 feet into the Los
Angeles night for a grand slam
that gave the Cardinal a miracu
lous 6-5 victory and left the fans
at Jackie Robinson Stadium in a
daze.
"I felt good at the plate all day
long and I was just hoping for
another chance to get up," Carver
said in a KZSU interview. "This
was a really big series for us. It's
