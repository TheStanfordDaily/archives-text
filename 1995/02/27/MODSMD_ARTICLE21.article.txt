Carver's heroics capped an
impressive and gutsy rally by the
Cardinal on the road in the ninth
inning. Freshman designated hit
ter Jon Schaeffer — who reached
base all four times he came to the
plate on Friday — led things off
with a walk. An Eric Sees'
groundout moved Schaeffer, who
avoided a tag in the basepaths, to
second before second baseman
Brian Dallimore struck out.
With Stanford just one out
away from dropping their first
Six-Pac game of the season and
UCLA's top closer, Bobby
Kazmirski, set to slam the door,
center fielder Cale Carter shocked
everyone in attendance by laying
a bunt down the first base line.
Carter narrowly avoided the tag
from first baseman Pete Zamora
to keep the Cardinal's hopes alive.
All-American catcher A.J.
Hinch then walked on four pitch
es, bringing Carver to the plate in
a situation he had only dreamed
of.
"I was really surprised by the
way they pitched to A.J. and I was
excited to have the opportunity,"
Carver said. "I fell behind quickly
0-2 and I new that he had a domi
nant slider. I looked for the slider
and he got it a little bit up. I just
tried to put the ball in play."
Carver didn't put the ball in
play, but he went one step better,
sending the Kazmirski pitch high
over the left-field wall for an
opposite field home run. Carver's

The 12th-ranked Stanford
baseball team traveled to the land
of stars, glitz and glamour and
put on a three-game show with
UCLA that even Hollywood's best
producers couldn't have equaled.
The Cardinal (11-7 overall, 2-1
in the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion) took two of three games
from the Bruins (8-6,1-2 in the
Six-Pac) in a dramatic conference
opening series that would have
made Jack Nicholson's heart skip
a beat. Stanford edged UCLA 6-5
in the opener before the Bruins
exacted revenge with an 8-6, 10-
inning victory on Saturday. The
Cardinal captured the rubber
game of the series 2-0 yesterday
afternoon behind another great
performance from freshman Kyle
Peterson.
Friday evening's conference
opener seemed more fiction than
reality as junior third baseman
Steve Carver took a page from
Roy Hobbs in the"The Natural,"
giving the Cardinal one of its
most dramatic wins in school his
tory.
With Stanford just one strike
away from defeat and the Bruins
leading 5-2, Carver launched an
0-2 slider 380 feet into the Los
Angeles night for a grand slam
that gave the Cardinal a miracu
lous 6-5 victory and left the fans
at Jackie Robinson Stadium in a
daze.
"I felt good at the plate all day
long and I was just hoping for
another chance to get up," Carver
said in a KZSU interview. "This
was a really big series for us. It's
important for us to come out

third ninth-inning comeback vic
tory of the season.
After Stanford jumped out to
an early 2-1 lead in the opener,
UCLA scored four unanswered
runs to take a 5-2 lead into the
ninth before falling victim to
Carver's heroics.
The Bruins, however, quickly
turned the tables on the Cardinal
the next afternoon. UCLA rallied
from a 6-4 eighth inning deficit to
score single runs in the eighth
and ninth before freshman Eric
Byrnes won the game with a two
run, two-out homer in the tenth.
Like Stanford the evening
before, the Bruins stared defeat
straight in the eye on Saturday.
With the Cardinal nursing a 6-
5 lead in the bottom of the ninth
and Byrnes on third with two out,
a bizarre plav appeared to have
ended the game. UCLA catcher
Tim DeCinces hit a 3-1 pitch
behind home plate which popped
out of Hinch's glove and hit off
the backstop fence before Hinch
barehanded the ball. Home plate
umpire Kevin Dougherty signaled
for the out and Stanford began to
celebrate a win.
But, after a vehement protest

from Bruins skipper Gary Adams
and a prolonged umpire confer
ence, the call was reversed and
DeCinces was given another life.
The sophomore made the most of
his second opportunity, lining a
single to right field that knotted
the game at six.
The Cardinal went scoreless in
the top of the 10th before Mario
Iglesias — who earned the win on
Friday with a perfect ninth inning
— surrendered Byrnes' third
home run of the year. Byrnes, a
true freshman, also homered to
lead off the series opener on Fri
day.
"UCLA has a good, young
team," Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess told KZSU. "They
should get better as the season
goes on and I wouldn't be sur
prised to see them right up there
at the end of the year."
The Cardinal had rallied from
an early deficit on Saturday after
the Bruins notched four runs in
the bottom of the first to bounce
starting pitcher Jason Middle
brook. Junior southpaw Mike
Robbins allowed Stanford to
climb back into the game by keep
ing the Bruins off the board over
the next six innings as Cardinal
hitters scored six unanswered
runs.
"I was just trying to keep us in
the game," Robbins told KZSU.
"We got down pretty early and I

knew that I just had to throw
strikes." Robbins recorded seven
strikeouts, all on breaking pitch
es, in his seven innings of work.
Stanford scored in five consec
utive innings on Saturday, bang
ing out 13 hits, to come back and
take the lead. First baseman Troy
Kent led the offensive charge,
going 3-for-5 with a home run.
"I thought we did a pretty good
job [on Saturday]," Marquess
said. "It was one of the best games
we've had offensively all year. We
couldn't pick up the win but we
played well."
The Cardinal was able to regis

quickly on the mound and he
throws strikes. He gets a lot of
easy outs and keeps us on our
toes."
UCLA's Ryan Lynch, brother
of ex-Cardinal football great John
Lynch, matched Peterson
through the first five innings as
the game remained scoreless.
Carver led off the sixth with a
double and scored on a two-out
RBI double from Kent to the lefl
center field gap. Kilburg followed
with another timely hit, plating
Kent with a single to give the Car
dinal a 2-0 advantage.

ter a victory in the rubber match
behind the third straight out
standing performance from
Peterson. After earning Pac-10
Pitcher of the Week honors last
week, Peterson shut down the
Bruins, allowing just six hits
while going the distance for the
second straight game to notch his
first career shutout.
"It's pretty easy to play behind
[Peterson]," Kent said. "He works

momentum going into next
week," Kent said. "It's a good sign
for us to come out and play hard
and win on the road."
With UCLA and Stanford the
only two conference teams in
action over the weekend, the Car
dinal — the defending Six-Pac
champion — is already in first
place. In a city where dreams turn
into reality, it couldn't have been
scripted any better.

action over the weekend, the Car
dinal — the defending Six-Pac
champion — is already in first
place. In a city where dreams turn
into reality, it couldn't have been
scripted any better.

Carver's heroics capped an
impressive and gutsy rally by the
Cardinal on the road in the ninth
inning. Freshman designated hit
ter Jon Schaeffer — who reached
base all four times he came to the
plate on Friday — led things off
with a walk. An Eric Sees'
groundout moved Schaeffer, who
avoided a tag in the basepaths, to
second before second baseman
Brian Dallimore struck out.
With Stanford just one out
away from dropping their first
Six-Pac game of the season and
UCLA's top closer, Bobby
Kazmirski, set to slam the door,
center fielder Cale Carter shocked
everyone in attendance by laying
a bunt down the first base line.
Carter narrowly avoided the tag
from first baseman Pete Zamora
to keep the Cardinal's hopes alive.
All-American catcher A.J.
Hinch then walked on four pitch
es, bringing Carver to the plate in
a situation he had only dreamed
of.
"I was really surprised by the
way they pitched to A.J. and I was
excited to have the opportunity,"
Carver said. "I fell behind quickly
0-2 and I new that he had a domi
nant slider. I looked for the slider
and he got it a little bit up. I just
tried to put the ball in play."
Carver didn't put the ball in
play, but he went one step better,
sending the Kazmirski pitch high
over the left-field wall for an
opposite field home run. Carver's
long ball gave the Cardinal its

The 12th-ranked Stanford
baseball team traveled to the land
of stars, glitz and glamour and
put on a three-game show with
UCLA that even Hollywood's best
producers couldn't have equaled.
The Cardinal (11-7 overall, 2-1
in the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion) took two of three games
from the Bruins (8-6,1-2 in the
Six-Pac) in a dramatic conference
opening series that would have
made Jack Nicholson's heart skip
a beat. Stanford edged UCLA 6-5
in the opener before the Bruins
exacted revenge with an 8-6, 10-
inning victory on Saturday. The
Cardinal captured the rubber
game of the series 2-0 yesterday
afternoon behind another great
performance from freshman Kyle
Peterson.
Friday evening's conference
opener seemed more fiction than
reality as junior third baseman
Steve Carver took a page from
Roy Hobbs in the"The Natural,"
giving the Cardinal one of its
most dramatic wins in school his
tory.
With Stanford just one strike
away from defeat and the Bruins
leading 5-2, Carver launched an
0-2 slider 380 feet into the Los
Angeles night for a grand slam
that gave the Cardinal a miracu
lous 6-5 victory and left the fans
at Jackie Robinson Stadium in a
daze.
"I felt good at the plate all day
long and I was just hoping for
another chance to get up," Carver
said in a KZSU interview. "This
was a really big series for us. It's
important for us to come out

third ninth-inning comeback vic
tory of the season.
After Stanford jumped out to
an early 2-1 lead in the opener,
UCLA scored four unanswered
runs to take a 5-2 lead into the
ninth before falling victim to
Carver's heroics.
The Bruins, however, quickly
turned the tables on the Cardinal
the next afternoon. UCLA rallied
from a 6-4 eighth inning deficit to
score single runs in the eighth
and ninth before freshman Eric
Byrnes won the game with a two
run, two-out homer in the tenth.
Like Stanford the evening
before, the Bruins stared defeat
straight in the eye on Saturday.
With the Cardinal nursing a 6-
5 lead in the bottom of the ninth
and Byrnes on third with two out,
a bizarre plav appeared to have
ended the game. UCLA catcher
Tim DeCinces hit a 3-1 pitch
behind home plate which popped
out of Hinch's glove and hit off
the backstop fence before Hinch
barehanded the ball. Home plate
umpire Kevin Dougherty signaled
for the out and Stanford began to
celebrate a win.
But, after a vehement protest

from Bruins skipper Gary Adams
and a prolonged umpire confer
ence, the call was reversed and
DeCinces was given another life.
The sophomore made the most of
his second opportunity, lining a
single to right field that knotted
the game at six.
The Cardinal went scoreless in
the top of the 10th before Mario
Iglesias — who earned the win on
Friday with a perfect ninth inning
— surrendered Byrnes' third
home run of the year. Byrnes, a
true freshman, also homered to
lead off the series opener on Fri
day.
"UCLA has a good, young
team," Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess told KZSU. "They
should get better as the season
goes on and I wouldn't be sur
prised to see them right up there
at the end of the year."
The Cardinal had rallied from
an early deficit on Saturday after
the Bruins notched four runs in
the bottom of the first to bounce
starting pitcher Jason Middle
brook. Junior southpaw Mike
Robbins allowed Stanford to
climb back into the game by keep
ing the Bruins off the board over
the next six innings as Cardinal
hitters scored six unanswered
runs.
"I was just trying to keep us in
the game," Robbins told KZSU.
"We got down pretty early and I

knew that I just had to throw
strikes." Robbins recorded seven
strikeouts, all on breaking pitch
es, in his seven innings of work.
Stanford scored in five consec
utive innings on Saturday, bang
ing out 13 hits, to come back and
take the lead. First baseman Troy
Kent led the offensive charge,
going 3-for-5 with a home run.
"I thought we did a pretty good
job [on Saturday]," Marquess
said. "It was one of the best games
we've had offensively all year. We
couldn't pick up the win but we
played well."
The Cardinal was able to regis

quickly on the mound and he
throws strikes. He gets a lot of
easy outs and keeps us on our
toes."
UCLA's Ryan Lynch, brother
of ex-Cardinal football great John
Lynch, matched Peterson
through the first five innings as
the game remained scoreless.
Carver led off the sixth with a
double and scored on a two-out
RBI double from Kent to the lefl
center field gap. Kilburg followed
with another timely hit, plating
Kent with a single to give the Car
dinal a 2-0 advantage.

ter a victory in the rubber match
behind the third straight out
standing performance from
Peterson. After earning Pac-10
Pitcher of the Week honors last
week, Peterson shut down the
Bruins, allowing just six hits
while going the distance for the
second straight game to notch his
first career shutout.
"It's pretty easy to play behind
[Peterson]," Kent said. "He works
