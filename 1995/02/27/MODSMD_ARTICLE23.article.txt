## Swimmers take Pac-10s 
### Ezra Baylin Staff writer 
The top-ranked Stanford women's
swimming and diving team cruised to
an easy victory this weekend at the
University of Washington, capturing
its ninth Pacific 10 Conference crown
in as many years. The Cardinal finished
up with 1646 points, more than 450
ahead of second place UCLA and 600
ahead of third place USC.
"We were real pleased with the
results this weekend. This is always a
tough meet for us," said head coach
Richard Quick. "We have been favored

to win in recent years, but the meet is
also at a critical time of preparation for
the NCAAs."
This most recent win continues a
dynasty in which no currently compet
ing Stanford women's swimmer has
ever lost a championship or dual meet.
The last time Stanford lost a dual meet
was 1988, and the only question during
last weekend's meet was how soundly
the Cardinal would defeat its Pac-10
opponents.
Although the Cardinal won easily,
the Pac-10 has more top-25 teams than
any other conference in the coun
try. Arizona, Arizona State,
UCLA, USC and California are all
top teams, but the daunting depth
of Stanford's lineup made the vic
tory look easy.
Stanford's superstars started
the three-day meet off strong,
winning three of the six swim
ming events on the first day of the
meet. Senior Jenny Thompson
won the 200-yard individual med
ley, and sophomore Claudia Fran
co qualified for the NCAA Nation
al championship on her way to
victory in the 50-yard freestyle.
"Jenny Thompson is a super
star athlete," Quick said. "She
wasn't even feeling 100 percent
for the meet, but she is a fierce
competitor who never gives up.
Claudia Franco is also coming
into her own right as a dominant
athlete."
Cardinal divers also put in
strong performances this week
end, with senior Eileen Richetelli
taking first in the three-meter
and platform competitions and
second in the one-meter event.

Sophomore Megan Gardiner's
two third-place finishes rounded
out Stanford's dominant perfor
mance.
Though the divers were influ
ential, the team's greatest

strength came from its plethora
of swimming talent. Thompson
swam to victory in the 100-yard
freestyle in a scant 49.14 seconds.
However, Stanford also took
third, fourth and fifth in the

event. Junior Jessica Tong,
sophomore Michelle Jesperson
and freshman Lindsay Gassner
rounded out the victorious sprint
free attack.
"Sprint freestyle is the thing
we hang our hat on," Quick said.
"We are going to have to swim real
fast in the sprint free to win at the
NCAA Championships this year."
Stanford also dominated the
1650-yard freestyle event, with
freshman Amy Oberhelman beat
ing her own season best by 10 sec
onds to win the event with a time
of 16:20.93. Oberhelman's time
was also good enough to guaran
tee her a spot at this year's
national championship meet.
The other top performer in the
distance event was sophomore
Sarah Anderson, who paced her
self to a respectable fifth-place
finish and a time of 16:36.18.
However, Anderson's time was a
bit of a disappointment because
she swam almost 14 seconds
faster against USC earlier in the
season.
"This race was a real step for
Amy Oberhelman," Quick said,
"but Sarah Anderson's perfor
mance is an example of what I say
when I talk about this meet as a

'Jenny Thompson is
a superstar athlete.
She wasn't even feel
ing 100 percent for
the meet, but she is
a fierce competitor
who never gives up.'

hard competition."
The other impressive victories
this weekend came in the relays.
Stanford won the 400- and 200-
yard free relays. A strong sprint
freestyle attack is important to
any college swim team, as four
events — the two relays and the
50- and 100-yard freestyles — are
based on sprint free swimmers
alone.
The next scored meet for the
Cardinal is the NCAA Champi
onships in Austin, Texas. Stan
ford will put its number one rank
ing on the line there in two weeks,
and the seniors on the team will
look to capture their fourth NCAA
championship crown in a row.
