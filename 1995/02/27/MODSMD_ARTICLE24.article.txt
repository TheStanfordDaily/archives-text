# Wrestlers grab 5th at Pac-10s
## 
### Ratha Harntha Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestling team showed how
it's supposed to be done at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships this weekend. The
Cardinal grapplers peaked at just the right
time to grab fiflh place at the tournament,
placing eight out of ten wrestlers and qualify
ing four for the NCAA Championships.
"We exceeded all expectations," said head
coach Chris Horpel. "Other teams were sur
prised at how strong we came on."
Seventeenth-ranked Arizona State
claimed the Pac-10 crown, narrowly edging
defending champion Oregon State, 126-
123.5. Cal State-Bakersfield placed third with
108 points, followed by Oregon's 91.5 points.
The Cardinal finished just 7.5 points

behind the Ducks, who needed Scott Norton's
2-0 victory over junior Tod Surmon in the
finals of the 150-pound division to hold off
Stanford for the fourth spot. Surmon was in
the process of taking the Norton down late in
the third period but time expired before he
could finish the takedown.
To reach the finals, Surmon scored the
biggest surprise of the tournament. After
crushing the fourth seed, Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo's Tim Cano, 9-3, Surmon faced Ari
zona State's Jeff Theiler, the top seed and
third-ranked 150-pounder in the nation. Sur
mon got the better of Theiler, slipping past
the Sun Devil, 5-3, and earning a spot at the
NCAAs.
"I knew what to expect and I didn't have

anything expected of me," Sur
mon said. "I wrestled really well
on my feet."
Senior Jay Jackson and juniors
Jimmy Aguirre and Matt Cano
joined Surmon as the other NCAA
qualifiers. Jackson took third at
142 pounds, and Cano and
Aguirre both placed fourth at 126
and 134 pounds, respectively.
Junior Sahlan Martin, who fin
ished fourth in the 158-pound
division, is the first alternate for
the NCAAs. That is, if any of the
38 qualifiers from the Pac-10 can
not compete at the NCAA Cham

pionships on March 16-18, Martin
will obtain that spot.
Sophomore Bryan Vaniman
placed fourth at 190 pounds but
did not qualify for the NCAAs.
"Getting into the top four is
tough," Horpel said. "And the six
athletes that I've been relying on
all year finished in the top four."
Freshman heavyweight Mark
Neglay and junior Mark Ryzewicz
rounded out the eight Cardinal
that placed, taking fifth and sixth
respectively.
The first round went well for
the Cardinal, but only one
wrestler, Surmon, moved onto the
finals. "I was disappointed with
the semis," Horpel said. "Only one
athlete made the finals and we
could have had three."

Aguirre lost his semifinal
match to Arizona's Steve St. John
and injured his knee in the pro
cess. Cano and Jackson also both
lost their semifinal bouts. Of the
three, only Jackson won his bout
to determine third and fourth
place in each class.
"I kept my mistakes to a mini
mum," Cano said. "I wrestled well
enough to qualify. I'm very excit
ed [for NCAAsJ."
"I feel good about qualifying,
but I could've done better,"
Aguirre said. "I definitely should
have taken third. I wasn't intense
enough. But our team showed
great improvement."
To get an idea of the team's
development through the season,
just look at Stanford's first tourna

ment appearance of the year. At
the Las Vegas Invitational on Nov.
25 and 26, not one Cardinal placed,
while the other eight teams had at
least one wrestler who placed.
"To come back and compete for
fourth is a tribute to our hard
work," Horpel said. "We're the
worst-funded program [in the Pac
10] and we finished in the middle
of a very tough conference. I think
that's pretty darn good. I'm proud
of what we're able to do."
The Cardinal also finished
ahead of Cal Poly-San Luis Obis
po, who fmished sixth with 79.5
points. Cal Poly crushed Stanford,
34-7, in a dual meet on Dec. 3.
"You have to be excited about
this team arid the possibilities,"
Aguirre said.
