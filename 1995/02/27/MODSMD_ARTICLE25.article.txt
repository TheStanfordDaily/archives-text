j UCLA 49

The last time the Stanford women's
basketball team played UCLA, the Cardi
nal could have won without showing up
for the second half. This time, Stanford
showed up flat for the first half yet still
won.
In the first meeting between the two
teams, the Cardinal (22-2 overall, 13-1 in
the Pacific 10 Conference) made sure that
the Bruins (10-14, 5-10 in the Pac-10)
were never in the game. Stanford
outscored UCLA 47-15 in the first half en
route to an easy 88-49 victory.
The rematch on Saturday climaxed
with basically the same conclusion
although the halves were switched. The
84-49 result was the worst-ever Bruins
loss in the history of the series for a game
played in Los Angeles. The 35-point mar
gin eclipsed the 23-point Stanford con
quest during the 1991-92 season.
The Cardinal outscored UCLA by 32
points in the second half, 52-20, after a
halftime "pep talk" by coach Tara Van-
Derveer. After a sloppy first half and
enlightening intermission, Stanford shot
60.6 percent from the floor (20 of 33),
including 6 of 9 from behind the arc. The
Cardinal also had many other chances to
add to the blowout but turned the ball over
13 times in the second half. The 24
turnovers in the game set a season high
for the Cardinal.
The triumvirate of seniors Anita
Kaplan and Kate Paye and sophomore
Kate Starbird again led the charge, com
bining for 59 of the Cardinal's points.
Starbird was the high scorer with 24
points on eight of 17 shooting, despite
going 1 of 8 during the first half. She also
stole the ball four times and added four
assists.
Paye added 19 points, breaking out of
her slump, making 6 of 7; all of her shots
were three pointers. The six treys set a
career high and helped raise her shooting

percentage. Paye entered the game 30 for
96 from the floor during Pac-10 play. She
also led the team with six assists and
added three steals.
Kaplan played her usual steady game
scoring 16 points and grabbing nine
rebounds to lead the team.
The Cardinal's performance during the
second half was a marked departure from
the first 20 minutes. The Stanford defense
clamped down on the Bruins and held
UCLA to one basket during a nine-minute
stretch in the second half. The Bruins
made only seven field goals after the break
and shot 29.2 percent. Bruin center Kisa
Hughes, who entered the game averaging
17.0 points and 10.8 rebounds per game,
was never a factor in the game as the Car
dinal constantly denied her the ball. She
ended the contest scoring 10 points and
grabbing a team-high six rebounds.

After a sloppy first half,
the Cardinal out scored
UCLA by 32 points in the
second half, 52-20.

The blowout began to detonate in the
initial stages of the second half. Stanford
outscored the Bruins 16-4 to secure a 15-
point lead when the first television time
out in the half occurred. Starbird made
four of her five attempts for nine points
and Kaplan and Paye added four and three
points respectively.
From then on, the Cardinal was never
challenged in the game. Stanford went on
a 23-4 run between the 11 minute, 46 sec
ond and the 3:05 marks in the second half.
Paye scored seven points in the run and
Starbird added six points. The Bruins
made 1 of 5 attempts and turned over the
ball seven times in the span.
The first half did not play out as the
Stanford coaching staff would have liked.
The Cardinal shot only 36.7 percent from
the floor and the Bruins had a chance to tie
on their final possession of the half. UCLA
actually outshot Stanford in the first half,
making 12 of 27.

The Bruins were led by senior
forward Kellie Bennett, who
scored 12 points in the half. Ben
nett missed only one of her six
attempts, while making both of
her three point attempts. Howev
er, in the second half, the Cardi
nal held her scoreless. Despite
that fact, Bennett was the lead
ing scorer for UCLA in the game.
Paye and Kaplan led the team
in the initial 20 minutes as well.
Kaplan scored eight points and
grabbed six rebounds in the half
while Paye made three of her
four treys.
The victory in Los Angeles
basically ensured that Stanford
would win at least a share of the
Pac-10 championship. The Cardi
nal, with four games left on the
conference schedule, has a three
game lead over Washington after
the Huskies' surprise loss at
Washington State. Oregon State,
the only Pac-10 squad to defeat
the Cardinal this season, will try
its luck again Thursday night at
Maples Pavilion, where Stanford
has not lost since last year.
