one, and our offense in general
got into trouble. Three, I didn't
think we came out communicat
ing.
"Once we turned these things
around, they're what won us the
match."
One of the ways Stanford
managed to turn things around
was by inserting freshman swing
hitter Tad Hoffman in to pass for
sophomore opposite hitter Brian
Moore at the end of game one.
Nieves asserted that the passing
combination of junior swing hit
ter Mike Lambert, Hoffman and
Fuerbringer improved as a whole
with this substitution.
"Early on we kind of strug
gled," Hoffman said. "Ruben put
me in to get things going, to
steady out the side-out game."
Long Beach's serve-receive
fared far worse in the match —
the situation was so dire that
coach Ray Ratelle made a whole
sale substitution of both of his
passers in game three. HofT hit
well, especially early in the
match, ending the night with 34
kills. However, Stanford man
aged to slow Hoff down with deci
sive blocks in the last two games.
"We haven't played well in a
long time," Ratelle said. "We're
hoping that something happens,
but we haven't shown anything
so far."
The No. 4 Trojans (6-3, 3-3 in
the MPSF) suffered a similar fate

This weekend, the No. 2 Stan
ford men's volleyball team
stormed the beach and sacked
Troy. Brandishing some of its
sharpest play of the season, the
Cardinal upended Long Beach
State in four games (6-15, 15-6,
15-8, 15-5) and USC in three (15-
7, 15-3, 15-10).
The sixth-ranked 49ers
walked into Maples Pavilion with
impressive victories over top
teams and an equally impressive
lineup. Long Beach (5-4 overall,
4-4 in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) had already
defeated the Trojans and
Brigham Young, both strong con
tenders this year. Also, the 49ers
have acquired the services of
junior opposite hitter Tom Hoff,
a highly rated player from Ohio
State's Final Four team of two
years ago.
Long Beach started well, tak
ing one game off of Stanford (9-2,
6-1 in the MPSF). A combination
of factors, primarily serving and
serve-receive, resulted in the
Cardinal's loss. However, the
Cardinal readjusted, bouncing
back to take the next three games
convincingly.
"We had a slow start because
of a combination of things," said
coach Ruben Nieves. "One, weak
serving. Two, [sophomore out
side hitter Matt] Fuerbringer
had a bad start passing in game
