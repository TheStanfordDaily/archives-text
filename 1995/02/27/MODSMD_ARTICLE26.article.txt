one, and our offense in general
got into trouble. Three, I didn't
think we came out communicat
ing.
"Once we turned these things
around, they're what won us the
match."
One of the ways Stanford
managed to turn things around
was by inserting freshman swing
hitter Tad Hoffman in to pass for
sophomore opposite hitter Brian
Moore at the end of game one.
Nieves asserted that the passing
combination of junior swing hit
ter Mike Lambert, Hoffman and
Fuerbringer improved as a whole
with this substitution.
"Early on we kind of strug
gled," Hoffman said. "Ruben put
me in to get things going, to
steady out the side-out game."
Long Beach's serve-receive
fared far worse in the match —
the situation was so dire that
coach Ray Ratelle made a whole
sale substitution of both of his
passers in game three. HofT hit
well, especially early in the
match, ending the night with 34
kills. However, Stanford man
aged to slow Hoff down with deci
sive blocks in the last two games.
"We haven't played well in a
long time," Ratelle said. "We're
hoping that something happens,
but we haven't shown anything
so far."
The No. 4 Trojans (6-3, 3-3 in
the MPSF) suffered a similar fate

This weekend, the No. 2 Stan
ford men's volleyball team
stormed the beach and sacked
Troy. Brandishing some of its
sharpest play of the season, the
Cardinal upended Long Beach
State in four games (6-15, 15-6,
15-8, 15-5) and USC in three (15-
7, 15-3, 15-10).
The sixth-ranked 49ers
walked into Maples Pavilion with
impressive victories over top
teams and an equally impressive
lineup. Long Beach (5-4 overall,
4-4 in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) had already
defeated the Trojans and
Brigham Young, both strong con
tenders this year. Also, the 49ers
have acquired the services of
junior opposite hitter Tom Hoff,
a highly rated player from Ohio
State's Final Four team of two
years ago.
Long Beach started well, tak
ing one game off of Stanford (9-2,
6-1 in the MPSF). A combination
of factors, primarily serving and
serve-receive, resulted in the
Cardinal's loss. However, the
Cardinal readjusted, bouncing
back to take the next three games
convincingly.
"We had a slow start because
of a combination of things," said
coach Ruben Nieves. "One, weak
serving. Two, [sophomore out
side hitter Matt] Fuerbringer
had a bad start passing in game

at the Cardinal's hands the next
night. Playing the entire match
with the tall lineup of Moore in the
opposite position, Stanford man
aged to do almost everything well
and snuffed out a national champi
onship contender.
"This lineup is something we've
been working on," said.
"Tonight was the first break
through night for it. What definite
ly helped with it was the fact that
we were pretty much passing nails.
Also, we were focusing on serving
tough. We executed well in every
phase of the game, it was a great
all-around performance."
Right from game one, the
trends of the match were set —
tenacious digging on both sides of
the court, Stanford's impeccable
side-out game and the Cardinal's
shutout of Trojan opposite hitter
Jason Mulholland, who ended the
night with a sub-par .182 hitting
percentage.
Also, serve-receive again played
a significant part in Stanford's
win. Fuerbringer's and Moore's
tough float serving and Lambert's
jump-serving plagued the USC
passers, especially at the start of
the second game, when the Cardi
nal rattled off four straight points.
"[Stanford! played really well,
the best I've seen them play in a
long time," said USC coach Jim
McLaughlin. "They did a lot of
things well, but we didn't pass well
and we weren't siding out. You've
got to pass with the big boys to
win."
Nieves credited Stanford's vic
tory to a combination of many fac
tors.
"A lot of things came together
tonight," Nieves said "Fuer
bringer and Lambert together had
a very good passing match. Also,
Moore played a very complete, con
sistent match — he hit .500, was
second on the team in kills [with
12, behind Lambert's 19], and had
nine digs.
"We're very pleased with the
performance. You just don't expect
to blow a team like USC out."
An upbeat Lambert cited the
night's performance as evidence of
Stanford's constant improvement
and great potential.
"This is just a brief glimpse at
what we're capable of later on,"
Lambert said. "There are good
vibes going on."
