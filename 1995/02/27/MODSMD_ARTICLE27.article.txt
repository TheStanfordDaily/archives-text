# Men gymnasts duel No. 4 Bears to draw
## 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
The thrill of victory and the agony of
defeat. The Stanford men's gymnastics
team learned on Saturday that the two
aren't always separate.
In a bittersweet finish at Burnham
Pavilion, the team battled No. 4 Califor
nia to a dead-even finish with matching
scores of 227.40. In the second biggest
surprise of the competition, Western
Michigan finished a distant third, out

pacing nationally ranked UCLA.
The fifth-ranked Cardinal (7-1-1)
was conning off its first loss of the season
last week in Berkeley, when a dramatic
finish on the high bar allowed Cal to
edge Stanford by a tenth of a point. The
team rebounded nicely in its home open
er, however, posting its second-highest
team score of the season.
"You always like to win and it's dis
appointing not to, but overall, the team
generally seemed to be in an upswing,"
said sophomore U.S. National Team

member Jamie Ellis. "We have to keep
looking towards NCAAs though and at
this point in the season, we seem to be
making good progress to that goal.
"The team focus and enthusiasm
that we were maybe lacking earlier in
the season is starting to surface."
Freshman specialist Clarence Miao
shared Ellis' positive outlook.
"I think the performance showed a
lot about how far we've come as a
team," Miao said. "After kind of a
rough start in the first few events,
we really came together and didn't
succumb to the pressure at the
end."
Although the team standings
were close, the individual honors
were all Stanford. The Cardinal
swept the top three spots in the all
around, with U.S. National Team
members Josh Stein, Keith Wiley
and Ellis finishing first through
third, respectively.
"I guess I felt like I did pretty
well," said Stein, a senior. "My per
formance on the parallel bars and
the pommel horse were kind of dis
appointing, but my vault was very
encouraging, definitely one of the
best I've ever done."
Stein's improvement on the
vault, which he won, held for the
entire squad. Following a horren
dous performance at Berkeley in
which four of six Stanford gym

nasts missed badly in the event,
Stein and sophomores Wiley and
lan Bachrach dominated, tying for
first, each posting scores of 9.65.
Part of the resurgence could be
attributed to the home-gym advan
tage, which the squad was enjoying
for the first time this season. The
Stanford faithful came out in
droves to cheer on its team, pack
ing the gym with Cardinal-clad
fans.
"It was definitely good to be
home for a change," Stein said.
"It's great to have the whole crowd
cheering for you when you hit your
routines."
Despite the team's success,
there were a few rough spots.
Early in the meet, the pommel
horse caused problems. Much of
the difficulty was directly related
to the timed warm-up period.
"We were really rushed to get
through all the events in the
warm-up," Bachrach said. "It real
ly disrupted our concentration at
the beginning and it took a lot of
motivation to just get through
those first few events."
