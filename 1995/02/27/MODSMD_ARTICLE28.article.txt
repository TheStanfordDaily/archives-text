# Rain stops golfers' comeback
## Begay garners first, team ties for second 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
The key foe of the top
ranked, defending-NCAA-cham
pion Stanford men's golf team
hasn't been a Pacific 10 Confer
ence powerhouse or a Big Eight
rival. The most feared enemy of
this year's Cardinal team has
been adverse weather.
Last weekend, rain stopped
short a Stanford charge in the
final round of the 19th annual
John A. Burns Intercollegiate
Tournament in Kaneohe,
Hawaii. The two-day final
standings left the team tied for
second with New Mexico and
Arizona, three strokes behind
No. 2 Oklahoma State.
"I don't think we were in it
mentally on the first day," said
head coach Wally Goodwin. "We
really jazzed things up on the
second day when we turned in

the best score of the day and
really had a lot of momentum
with us.
"Things really looked good
for us on the final day,"he con
tinued. "We finished nine holes
with the best score of the day
and in good position to get a
grip on the tournament, but the
weather wasn't being very coop
erative."
Individually, fifth-year
senior All-American Notah
Begay finished as the top per
former for both the Cardinal
team and the tournament.
Begay outpaced three other
golfers, each by one stroke,
scoring a four-under-par score
of 140.
For the rest of the squad, the
story was the mediocre showing
on the first day. Tiger Woods
ended up three strokes back of
the lead at 143. The freshman
overcame a rough start to fire a

tournament-low 68 on the sec
ond to finish ninth overall.
Fifth-year senior Ail-Americans
Casey Martin and Will Yaniga
sawa displayed a similar pat
tern, turning in their best per
formances in the second round.
Fellow senior All-American
Steve Burdick continued to
struggle, following up a disap
pointing tournament at the
TaylorMade Invitational. Bur
dick was simply unable to find
his rhythm, scoring eight over
par for the tournament and fin
ishing 55th.
Many of the Cardinal's diffi
culties in these first two tourna
ments after a two-month break
can be attributed to poor weath
er here in the Bay Area. The
non-stop rain of a few weeks ago
covered the driving range and
soaked greens, making it very
