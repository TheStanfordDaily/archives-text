# No. 20 tumblers topple Titans
## 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
This was one of those magnifi
cent evenings that takes a few days
to completely enjoy.
The 20th-ranked Stanford
women's gymnastics team trounced
No. 19 Cal State-Fullerton Friday
evening at Burnham Pavilion,
outscoring the Titans 192.075 to
189.875.
The Cardinal began the meet in
fine fashion with a superb perfor
mance on the vault. Freshman Keri
Mo mill an brought rousing cheers
from the crowd by scoring a 9.900,
shattering the vault record she
shared with senior co-captain Jen 6
Elzie.
"My vaults have been consistent
ly getting better all season," Mona
han said. "I've been concentrating
on perfecting my landings and I
finally put it together during the
meet."
Freshman Christie Jones, vault
ing for the first time all season
because of a stress fracture in her
back, rose to the occasion by earning
a 9.525. Sophomore Katie Jennings
has battled an array of injuries all

season long but amazingly tallied
the highest scoring vault of her
Stanford career, a 9.700.
"Christie Jones and Katie Jen
nings performed above and beyond
what they should have been able to
do tonight," Stanford head coach
Breck Greenwood said.
It comes as no surprise that this
historic evening was to be shared by
all members of the vault team, as
seniors Tina Snowden and Elzie,
along with sophomore Ariel Pas
sanisi, contributed in setting a new
Stanford vault record. The Cardinal
score of 48.350 broke the previous
mark by nearly three tenths, which
was set two weeks ago against Ore
gon State.
The team's success continued on
the uneven bars, as Monahan once
again demonstrated her abilities by
winning the event with 9.825
points. Elzie and Jennings were not
far behind, scoring a 9.800 and
9.775, respectively. Jennings per
formed her routine without having
practiced it all week.
"Katie is just so talented that she
can just go out and do it," Green
wood said. "She can do bars in her
sleep."

However, Stanford's magical
evening took a slight detour when
the squad moved to the balance
beam. The Cardinal sufibred three
falls, basically ending its quest for
the highest team score ever. Pas
sanisi provided the lone bright spot,
recording a 9.700.
"Hopefully we can use this in a
positive way to get them fired up,"
Greenwood said. "We're going to
work on two things this week, beam
and beam."
The floor exercise also provided
some history, as Monahan complet
ed the first full-out ever to be per
formed in collegiate women's gym
nastics. The move consists of a dou
ble backflip, with a twist in the sec
ond flip.
Elzie's 9.800 contributed to her
all-around victory, capping an excel
lent evening as the team avenged a
loss to the Titans earlier in the sea
son.
"Breck's team has improved for
sure," Fullerton head coach Lynn
Rogers said. "They didn't tell me
this, but I would guess that they
were trying to peak later in the sea
son."
He was right about that.
