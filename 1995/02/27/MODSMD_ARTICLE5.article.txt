# Hopes high for ethnic studies plan
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Faculty and students respond
ed positively to the proposal for a
new ethnic studies program re
leased last week. But their enthu
siasm was mixed with a lingering
skepticism that they said will last
until the program is firmly in
place.
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven presented his
proposal for an interdisciplinary
program in Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity to the Fac
ulty Senate last Thursday, meet
ing with general approval by sena
tors.
If implemented, the proposal
will offer majors and minors in

Chicano, Asian-
American and
African and
Afro-American
Studies, as well
as in a variety of
comparative eth
nic studies.
Shoven based
the proposal on

Shoven recommenda
tions from two committees as
signed to examine Chicano Stud
ies and Asian-American Studies.
"I'm elated," said alumna
Sandy Yuen, Class of '73, who was
active in the movement for Asian-
American Studies when she was a
student.
But Yuen described her joy as
hesitant. "I want to see more than
words," she said.
Felipe Barragan, a co-chair of
the Chicano / Latino student
group MEChA and a participant
in the protest last year that led to
the formation of the Chicano
Studies Committee, was positive
about the program. "The only
thing now is how the implementa
tion process will take place," he
said.
It is essential that students be
able to participate by sitting on the
committees for curriculum design
and faculty searches, students
said. And both students and facul
ty agreed that the University must
make the necessary commitment
to resources if the new program is

to be successful.
The good side
Students and faculty praised
both the comparative aspects of
the program and the equal roles it
will give to the humanities and so
cial sciences in studying race and
ethnicity.
"It looks as though this is a
good way to study contemporary
problems from different perspec
tives," said Law Prof. Miguel
Mendez.
"I think that in many respects,
it is a brilliant way to pull together
a number of ethnic studies pro
grams," said Civil Engineering
Prof. Jim Leckie, who supported
students in the hunger strike. "It
opens up ideas that are not being
utilized at [other] universities
with ethnic studies programs."
"The notion here was that the
committees reviewed the pro
grams that were in place [at other
universities] and decided that
what was missing was the involve
ment of social sciences ... in
studying race and ethnicity as it
affects modern American society,"
he said. "That is an area we had
been lacking in severely here."
"It struck a veiy strong chord
with regard to the relation of eth
nic studies to critical social issues
such as discrimination, poverty
and affirmative action," agreed
Comparative Literature Prof.
David Palumbo-Liu, who along
with History Prof. Gordon Chang
was hired in 1990 to teach Asian-
American Studies courses.
"I am ... excited about the
comparative dimension, as well as
the international dimension,
which will make Stanford's pro
gram unique," Palumbo-Liu said.
"I was also pleased to hear Dean
Shoven underscore the fact that
these new perspectives would
complement, rather than replace,
the study of particular ethnic
groups."
An uncertain future

gram — which would come
under the new interdisciplinary
program's umbrella — was
unsure of the impact the pro
gram and its comparative
emphasis would have on Afro-
American Studies.
"Personally, I feel that African
and Afro-American Studies has
the particular commitment to our
history and to our needs as a peo
ple today to study race not in a
comparative context, but to study
those particular experiences that
we as people of African descent
have had," he said.
Although "the phenomenon of
race as we know it in America has
a lot to do with whites, as well as
Hispanics and Asians and
blacks," Black said he is con
cerned without knowing more
specifics.
"African and Afro-American
Studies was not a part of the

study and the committee research
and investigation and the issues
that came out of the hunger
strike," he said. "Those commit
tees did not have the benefit of
our views and perspectives and
particular conditions and circum
stances so that our being
absorbed into this new organiza
tion leaves me with a lot of ques
tions."
After the May hunger strike,
when the ethnic studies commit
tees were formed, "no one knew
that [Afro-American Studies]
were going to be absorbed into the
structure ... so we didn't ask to
be a part of it," Black explained.
"But if someone had said six or
seven months ago that we were
going to be a part, we would have
asked for a committee."
In his report, Shoven said,
"The role of African and Afro-
American Studies .. . should be
clarified."
But he added that he thinks
Afro-American Studies "will lose
nothing and gain considerably
from its participation in the new

comparative [interdisciplinary
program]."
Student representation
Other concerns focused on stu
dent representation in developing
curricula and hiring staff and the
availability of resources to make
the program successful.
The proposal offered "more
than I expected," said senior
Sun Lee, a member of Con
cerned Students for Asian-
American Studies. "After work
ing on Asian-American Studies
and looking back at the history, I
was kind of skeptical about get
ting any kind of program started
at Stanford.
"I'm impressed, but I do have
some reservations," she added.
"One of them is that there won't
be any students on the search
committees for hiring the profes
sors."
Shoven said at the senate
meeting that students would be
named to the curriculum commit
tees but not to search commit
tees. The committees should be

named within the next two
weeks.
"I'm hoping that the adminis
tration will reconsider putting
students onto the faculty search
committee," said Michael Choo,
deputy chair of the ASSU Senate.
"There are a lot of students who
have done research on Asian-
American Studies and their input
will be important to find faculty
to teach the courses."
"Students have always been a
really big part of pushing for the
ethnic studies program, and I
think student input is always
good," Lee said.
"I hope that they start imple
menting whatever plans they
have in this proposal and they
will listen to students while
they're doing it," she said. "With
student input, things will move
ahead, and I hope they move
rather quickly."
Resources essential
Chicano Studies, although not
a formal program currently, will
enter the new program with more

resources, and"in Asian-Ameri
can Studies they'll have to throw
. .. more resources right in at the
beginning," said Leckie.
Palumbo-Liu shared Leckie's
concern. "While I have much to
say in praise of the document, I
am also disappointed that at this
point we cannot make more hires
in Asian-American Studies," he
said. "The one appointment we
have been given still puts us way
behind Chicano Studies. ... I
hope we can convince the Dean's
office to devote resources for
another appointment soon."
Shoven's proposal outlines
plans for a visiting faculty mem
ber next year and an authorized
search for a new faculty position
in each of Chicano and Asian-
American Studies. Searches for
faculty members in political sci
ence and history who would
teach in the African and Afro-
American Studies program have
already been authorized, the
report said.
"It is important to note," the
report added, "that none of these

appointments will be made to the
[program]. In all cases, we are
planning to strengthen our disci
plinary departments via these
appointments and to indirectly
solidify the Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity program."
"I would hope that there's
some way to ensure that faculty
who are hired are committed to
the program and will continue to
commit their time to the pro
gram," said Yuen. "Those things
will have to be worked out."
But, she said, ethnic studies at
Stanford have made good
progress since she studied here as
an undergraduate in the early
1970s and as a graduate student
in the 1980s.
When she returned to campus
to pursue her doctoral degree,
Yuen said, "not much improve
ment had really been made in
those 10 years."
With a proposal in place, eth
nic studies at Stanford will
improve more quickly, she said,
adding, "it's certainly been a long
time coming."

seven months ago that we were
going to be a part, we would have
asked for a committee."
In his report, Shoven said,
"The role of African and Afro-
American Studies .. . should be
clarified."
But he added that he thinks
Afro-American Studies "will lose
nothing and gain considerably
from its participation in the new

comparative [interdisciplinary
program]."
Student representation
Other concerns focused on stu
dent representation in developing
curricula and hiring staff and the
availability of resources to make
the program successful.
The proposal offered "more
than I expected," said senior
Sun Lee, a member of Con
cerned Students for Asian-
American Studies. "After work
ing on Asian-American Studies
and looking back at the history, I
was kind of skeptical about get
ting any kind of program started
at Stanford.
"I'm impressed, but I do have
some reservations," she added.
"One of them is that there won't
be any students on the search
committees for hiring the profes
sors."
Shoven said at the senate
meeting that students would be
named to the curriculum commit
tees but not to search commit
tees. The committees should be

named within the next two
weeks.
"I'm hoping that the adminis
tration will reconsider putting
students onto the faculty search
committee," said Michael Choo,
deputy chair of the ASSU Senate.
"There are a lot of students who
have done research on Asian-
American Studies and their input
will be important to find faculty
to teach the courses."
"Students have always been a
really big part of pushing for the
ethnic studies program, and I
think student input is always
good," Lee said.
"I hope that they start imple
menting whatever plans they
have in this proposal and they
will listen to students while
they're doing it," she said. "With
student input, things will move
ahead, and I hope they move
rather quickly."
Resources essential
Chicano Studies, although not
a formal program currently, will
enter the new program with more

resources, and"in Asian-Ameri
can Studies they'll have to throw
. .. more resources right in at the
beginning," said Leckie.
Palumbo-Liu shared Leckie's
concern. "While I have much to
say in praise of the document, I
am also disappointed that at this
point we cannot make more hires
in Asian-American Studies," he
said. "The one appointment we
have been given still puts us way
behind Chicano Studies. ... I
hope we can convince the Dean's
office to devote resources for
another appointment soon."
Shoven's proposal outlines
plans for a visiting faculty mem
ber next year and an authorized
search for a new faculty position
in each of Chicano and Asian-
American Studies. Searches for
faculty members in political sci
ence and history who would
teach in the African and Afro-
American Studies program have
already been authorized, the
report said.
"It is important to note," the
report added, "that none of these

appointments will be made to the
[program]. In all cases, we are
planning to strengthen our disci
plinary departments via these
appointments and to indirectly
solidify the Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity program."
"I would hope that there's
some way to ensure that faculty
who are hired are committed to
the program and will continue to
commit their time to the pro
gram," said Yuen. "Those things
will have to be worked out."
But, she said, ethnic studies at
Stanford have made good
progress since she studied here as
an undergraduate in the early
1970s and as a graduate student
in the 1980s.
When she returned to campus
to pursue her doctoral degree,
Yuen said, "not much improve
ment had really been made in
those 10 years."
With a proposal in place, eth
nic studies at Stanford will
improve more quickly, she said,
adding, "it's certainly been a long
time coming."
Faculty and students respond
ed positively to the proposal for a
new ethnic studies program re
leased last week. But their enthu
siasm was mixed with a lingering
skepticism that they said will last
until the program is firmly in
place.
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven presented his
proposal for an interdisciplinary
program in Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity to the Fac
ulty Senate last Thursday, meet
ing with general approval by sena
tors.
If implemented, the proposal
will offer majors and minors in

Chicano, Asian-
American and
African and
Afro-American
Studies, as well
as in a variety of
comparative eth
nic studies.
Shoven based
the proposal on

Shoven recommenda
tions from two committees as
signed to examine Chicano Stud
ies and Asian-American Studies.
"I'm elated," said alumna
Sandy Yuen, Class of '73, who was
active in the movement for Asian-
American Studies when she was a
student.
But Yuen described her joy as
hesitant. "I want to see more than
words," she said.
Felipe Barragan, a co-chair of
the Chicano / Latino student
group MEChA and a participant
in the protest last year that led to
the formation of the Chicano
Studies Committee, was positive
about the program. "The only
thing now is how the implementa
tion process will take place," he
said.
It is essential that students be
able to participate by sitting on the
committees for curriculum design
and faculty searches, students
said. And both students and facul
ty agreed that the University must
make the necessary commitment
to resources if the new program is

to be successful.
The good side
Students and faculty praised
both the comparative aspects of
the program and the equal roles it
will give to the humanities and so
cial sciences in studying race and
ethnicity.
"It looks as though this is a
good way to study contemporary
problems from different perspec
tives," said Law Prof. Miguel
Mendez.
"I think that in many respects,
it is a brilliant way to pull together
a number of ethnic studies pro
grams," said Civil Engineering
Prof. Jim Leckie, who supported
students in the hunger strike. "It
opens up ideas that are not being
utilized at [other] universities
with ethnic studies programs."
"The notion here was that the
committees reviewed the pro
grams that were in place [at other
universities] and decided that
what was missing was the involve
ment of social sciences ... in
studying race and ethnicity as it
affects modern American society,"
he said. "That is an area we had
been lacking in severely here."
"It struck a veiy strong chord
with regard to the relation of eth
nic studies to critical social issues
such as discrimination, poverty
and affirmative action," agreed
Comparative Literature Prof.
David Palumbo-Liu, who along
with History Prof. Gordon Chang
was hired in 1990 to teach Asian-
American Studies courses.
"I am ... excited about the
comparative dimension, as well as
the international dimension,
which will make Stanford's pro
gram unique," Palumbo-Liu said.
"I was also pleased to hear Dean
Shoven underscore the fact that
these new perspectives would
complement, rather than replace,
the study of particular ethnic
groups."
An uncertain future

gram — which would come
under the new interdisciplinary
program's umbrella — was
unsure of the impact the pro
gram and its comparative
emphasis would have on Afro-
American Studies.
"Personally, I feel that African
and Afro-American Studies has
the particular commitment to our
history and to our needs as a peo
ple today to study race not in a
comparative context, but to study
those particular experiences that
we as people of African descent
have had," he said.
Although "the phenomenon of
race as we know it in America has
a lot to do with whites, as well as
Hispanics and Asians and
blacks," Black said he is con
cerned without knowing more
specifics.
"African and Afro-American
Studies was not a part of the

study and the committee research
and investigation and the issues
that came out of the hunger
strike," he said. "Those commit
tees did not have the benefit of
our views and perspectives and
particular conditions and circum
stances so that our being
absorbed into this new organiza
tion leaves me with a lot of ques
tions."
After the May hunger strike,
when the ethnic studies commit
tees were formed, "no one knew
that [Afro-American Studies]
were going to be absorbed into the
structure ... so we didn't ask to
be a part of it," Black explained.
"But if someone had said six or

going to be a part, we would have
