# Hopes high for ethnic studies plan

### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Faculty and students respond
ed positively to the proposal for a
new ethnic studies program re
leased last week. But their enthu
siasm was mixed with a lingering
skepticism that they said will last
until the program is firmly in
place.
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven presented his
proposal for an interdisciplinary
program in Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity to the Fac
ulty Senate last Thursday, meet
ing with general approval by sena
tors.
If implemented, the proposal
will offer majors and minors in

Chicano, Asian-
American and
African and
Afro-American
Studies, as well
as in a variety of
comparative eth
nic studies.
Shoven based
the proposal on

Shoven recommenda
tions from two committees as
signed to examine Chicano Stud
ies and Asian-American Studies.
"I'm elated," said alumna
Sandy Yuen, Class of '73, who was
active in the movement for Asian-
American Studies when she was a
student.
But Yuen described her joy as
hesitant. "I want to see more than
words," she said.
Felipe Barragan, a co-chair of
the Chicano / Latino student
group MEChA and a participant
in the protest last year that led to
the formation of the Chicano
Studies Committee, was positive
about the program. "The only
thing now is how the implementa
tion process will take place," he
said.
It is essential that students be
able to participate by sitting on the
committees for curriculum design
and faculty searches, students
said. And both students and facul
ty agreed that the University must
make the necessary commitment
to resources if the new program is

to be successful.
The good side
Students and faculty praised
both the comparative aspects of
the program and the equal roles it
will give to the humanities and so
cial sciences in studying race and
ethnicity.
"It looks as though this is a
good way to study contemporary
problems from different perspec
tives," said Law Prof. Miguel
Mendez.
"I think that in many respects,
it is a brilliant way to pull together
a number of ethnic studies pro
grams," said Civil Engineering
Prof. Jim Leckie, who supported
students in the hunger strike. "It
opens up ideas that are not being
utilized at [other] universities
with ethnic studies programs."
"The notion here was that the
committees reviewed the pro
grams that were in place [at other
universities] and decided that
what was missing was the involve
ment of social sciences ... in
studying race and ethnicity as it
affects modern American society,"
he said. "That is an area we had
been lacking in severely here."
"It struck a veiy strong chord
with regard to the relation of eth
nic studies to critical social issues
such as discrimination, poverty
and affirmative action," agreed
Comparative Literature Prof.
David Palumbo-Liu, who along
with History Prof. Gordon Chang
was hired in 1990 to teach Asian-
American Studies courses.
"I am ... excited about the
comparative dimension, as well as
the international dimension,
which will make Stanford's pro
gram unique," Palumbo-Liu said.
"I was also pleased to hear Dean
Shoven underscore the fact that
these new perspectives would
complement, rather than replace,
the study of particular ethnic
groups."
An uncertain future
