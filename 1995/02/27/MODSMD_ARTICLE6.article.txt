# Hunger strikers are pleased by proposal
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
With a proposal for a Chicano
Studies program completed, stu
dents who participated in a
hunger strike and protest last
year are proud of furthering the
movement by camping for three
days in the Quad without food.
The days that junior Elvira
Prieto spent fasting along with
senior Tamara Alvarado and re
cent graduates Eva Silva and
Julia Gonzalez Luna were worth
it, Prieto said.
"I still think it was very im
portant," she said. "I think that
if last year hadn't happened,

then things wouldn't have
moved as fast as they have."
The four students were part
of a protest demanding a Chi
cano Studies program, a Univer
sity-wide ban on grapes, a com
munity center in East Palo Alto
and a high-level position offer for
Cecilia Burciaga, a Chicana ad
ministrator who lost her job last
March.
"I feel it's a big leap," said Fe
lipe Barragan, co-chair of the
Chicano / Latino student group
MEChA and one of more than
100 students who joined the
protest. "I see it as a big move
forward."
Prieto said that she was
pleased with the victory for Chi
cano Studies and that she hopes
the program can soon be expanded
further to include other ethnic
studies and possibly a focus on
gender relations.
The availability of such pro
grams is important because "it's
history that isn't necessarily
taught when we're going through
elementary school and high
school," she said.
In the months since the hunger
strike, Prieto said, she has been
keeping up on progress toward a
Chicano Studies program by
attending meetings and forums,
although she did not serve on the
Chicano Studies Committee.
Prieto echoed the uncertainty
of other students who want to see
the program before they believe it.
"I think it's good," she said of
the program, "but I have to see it
done before I can really know."
The proposal is even better
than she envisioned during the
protests, Prieto said, especially
because of the comparative aspect.
Although the establishment of

an entire department would be
best, Barragan said he under
stands constraints on resources
and is satisfied with the proposed
nuyor for Chicano Studies.
"I felt that the msyor was very
important because there were
already classes in Chicano Studies
but they weren't consistent and
there weren't enough in different
areas," he said. "The mqjor itself
was something I saw as essential."
Although he said last year's
efforts probably played a pivotal
role in the establishment of a Chi
cano Studies program, Barragan
was quick to give credit to every
one involved with the 25-year
effort.
"I think that we made some
significant accomplishments, but
it wasn't just from that point that
the struggle began," he said.
"There have been students here
advocating for a Chicano Studies
program and major for many
years."
The hunger strike was "anoth
er level in that struggle," Barra
gan said. "It wasn't just us. We
realize that. That protest was just
one in a series of different types of
strategies by other students.
"To see that something . . .
very positive materialized out of
that," he said, "made it seem
worth it to make the sacrifices."
