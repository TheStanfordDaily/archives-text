The number of student groups re
questing ASSU Senate approval for a spe
cial fee decreased this year, coupled with a
significant decrease in the amount of
money requested.
Twenty-nine groups requested senate
approval for their fee and were approved
by the appropriations committee last
week, compared to 34 groups last year.
"A lot of groups this year cut back," ac
cording to Liane Nomura, co-chair of the
ASSU Senate Appropriations Committee.
"There was a backlash from [those groups
who] did not pass or narrowly passed last

the special-fee issue, making students
more wary about the process. "This re

awareness [about] the BFD," he said.

"Student groups who did not pass last
year are more conscious about how much
money they're going to spend," Chen said,
using Stanford-in-Government as an ex
ample. The group's request of almost
$25,000 is down $13,000 from last year's
figure, according to SIG treasurer Jon
Oram.
Though Oram said that one reason for
the decreased request is eliminating
waste, his chief rationale for the lower fig
ure is simply to get the necessary student
support to win the special fee.
"It has to do with the fact that we lost
our funding last year," Oram said. "I'm
willing to do anything to get funding for
next year. Otherwise my organization will
