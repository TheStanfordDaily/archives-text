# ASSU special fee requests decrease
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
The number of student groups re
questing ASSU Senate approval for a spe
cial fee decreased this year, coupled with a
significant decrease in the amount of
money requested.
Twenty-nine groups requested senate
approval for their fee and were approved
by the appropriations committee last
week, compared to 34 groups last year.
"A lot of groups this year cut back," ac
cording to Liane Nomura, co-chair of the
ASSU Senate Appropriations Committee.
"There was a backlash from [those groups
who] did not pass or narrowly passed last
year. [Groups are] trying to appeal to stu
dents and be more money-conscious."

Last spring, only 40 percent of student
groups who requested a special fee actual
ly won the money, causing concern among
student groups.
Jerry Chen, appropriations committee
co-chair, said student groups have grown
more cautious in the wake of widespread
student awareness about the special-fee
process.
"Overall, [fewer] groups are applying,"
he said. "Even those who did pass have de
creased their budget."
Chen said the recent Balanced Fund
ing Deal — which was defeated in a stu
dent election last month — spotlighted
the special-fee issue, making students
more wary about the process. "This re
flects the atmosphere now, with the
awareness [about] the BFD," he said.

"Student groups who did not pass last
year are more conscious about how much
money they're going to spend," Chen said,
using Stanford-in-Government as an ex
ample. The group's request of almost
$25,000 is down $13,000 from last year's
figure, according to SIG treasurer Jon
Oram.
Though Oram said that one reason for
the decreased request is eliminating
waste, his chief rationale for the lower fig
ure is simply to get the necessary student
support to win the special fee.
"It has to do with the fact that we lost
our funding last year," Oram said. "I'm
willing to do anything to get funding for
next year. Otherwise my organization will
die."
The highest amount that the
appropriations committee
approved for any group was
$115,165 for club sports, according
to ASSU Financial Manager Gabe
Lucas.
Noticeable absences from the
original submissions were KZSU
and The Stanford Daily. Chen
said that in both cases there were
misunderstandings on the dead
line between the group and the
ASSU.
Alex Gould, business manager

of KZSU, said that he was unaware
of the deadline because of poor
publicity on the part of the ASSU.
Gould said he was told that the
ASSU would provide him with
more information but he was
never contacted. The deadline was
publicized in the ASSU office,
which KZSU does not frequent, he
said.
"We don't do most of our finan
cial transactions through the
ASSU. We were very lucky to fmd
out that there was an appeal
Thursday night," Gould said.
At Thursday's appeal, both The
Daily and KZSU received recom
mendations for senate approval.
The senate will vote on all special
fee recommendations at its Tues

day night meeting.
"It was a near disaster," Gould
said. "I think [the ASSU] could
have done a better job making it
clear where to apply. Luckily, it
turned out okay."
The Coalition Against Sexual
Assault was also planning to apply
for a special fee but was unaware of
the specific deadlines and applica
tion procedures, according to mem
ber Virginia Duplessis. In addition,
she said the group is undergoing
some "internal restructuring"
which could influence future deci
sion making.
Though the deadline for apply
ing for a spot on the special-fee bal
lot has passed, student groups can
still petition students to have their

special-fee request placed on the
ballot. The deadline for submitting
petitions is March 10. Duplessis
said the coalition is considering
using the petition process.
Lucas also announced last week
that the special-fee buffer — an
extra percentage of a group's bud
get added to offset fee refunds —
will run in the mid-20 percent
range. Because the buffer is differ
ent for each group requesting a
fee, there is no set number, he
said.
Despite more student aware
ness about the right to a fee
refund, the actual amount of
refunded money this year was far
less than the 30 percent buffer
which the ASSU added last year.
