# A 						story that will not die
## College legend is alive on campus 
### Valerie Hung Contributing writer 
He may not be 10 feet tall and wander the Hi
malayas, and he cannot be sighted crooning "Love
Me Tender" at every 7-11 in America, but Prof.
Emeritus of Operations Research George Dantzig
has every right to his legendary status.
College folklore has circulated the nation's uni
versities for hundreds of years and most legends
have been dismissed as myth. But Dantzig knows
better.
Currently teaching at Stanford, Dantzig spent his
graduate years at UC-Berkeley. There he took a
math class under Professor Jerzy Neyman, who gave
his students some unsolved math problems as a
brain teaser.
Thinking they were homework problems,
Dantzig copied the unsolved teasers down — and

solved them.
"If you know George Dantzig,
you know I'm always late, and I
copied the homework from the
board," Dantzig said. "Two prob
lems were there and I went ahead
and tried to solve them. After a
while, I ran into Neyman. I was a
little slow in handing in the home
work — it took me longer than
usual."
Not completely understanding
what Dantzig was talking about,
Neyman told him to throw the
"problem set" on his desk so he
could examine it later.
"My wife and I had a little apart

ment and we lived up on the second
floor. It was Sunday morning and
we were sleeping late. Suddenly
there was this tremendous banging
and I went downstairs to open the
door," Dantzig recalled.
"In flies Neyman. 'I've written
up an introduction and I want you
to send it in,' he said. I didn't know
what he was talking about. But it
turns out that the homework
wasn't homework after all, that he
had written on the board two prob
lems that had been unsolved prob
lems, and important ones in the
field," Dantzig said.
The story has spread to become
a famous college tale, growing more
exaggerated with time. A few years
after the incident, traveling by
plane one day, Dantzig happened to
be sitting next to a man from Los

Angeles named Reverend Schuler.
"I told him this story about me
and he got very interested,"
Dantzig said. "The next thing I
heard is that he preached a sermon
to illustrate that here was an exam
ple of positive thinking."
Schuler not only told the story
twice to followers of his radio pro
gram in Los Angeles but also
included it in a book of sermons.
"He sent it to me and asked me
to check it over," Dantzig said. "I
gave him the corrected version but
he didn't pay any attention to it.
His story was better." And with
each telling, Dantzig said, the story
grew.
"He has a style about him that
when he preaches, he exaggerates,"
Dantzig said. "So instead of having
solved one problem, and in my case

it was two, it became eventually
eight or something."
Rev. Schuler also confused other
facts, such as the university
Dantzig was attending at the time.
For Dantzig, however, the impor
tant thing was that the general idea
remained the same.
"The whole point of the story,
from the point of view of Schuler,
was that he believed in positive
thinking," Dantzig said. "I didn't
know it was an unsolved problem,
and because I didn't know it was an
unsolved problem, I wasn't defeat
ed before I began. Approaching the
problem positively, I was able to
solve it."
Dantzig was quick to de-empha
size his status as a college legend.
"To me it's just some junk you put
in the newspaper," he said.
