# Stanford medics test soybean oil implant

Stanford University medical researchers are
participating in a national study to test a new
soybean oil breast implant which could make
implants more accessible to women and eventu
ally replace imperfect saline and silicone breast
implants.
Donald Laub, clinical associate professor of
plastic and reconstructive surgery, and Gail
Lebovic, a general surgeon in Palo Alto, operated
on three patients at Stanford Hospital on Feb. 16
to replace their silicone gel breast implants with
breast implants made of soybean oil.
The three surgeries marked the beginning of
a series of 10 experimental surgeries to be per
formed at the hospital for a national study test
ing the reliability, safety and cosmetic results of
soybean oil breast implants.
If test results are positive, the new implants
could replace current saline and silicone breast
implants. The Food and Drug Administration
banned silicone gel implants in 1991 for cos
metic purposes, although they are still used for
cancer patients.
Doctors want "to see if indeed soybean oil is
superior to saline," said Kathy Wright, regis
tered nurse for Laub.
Wright said saline breast implants leak
because of fissures in the silicone shell sur
rounding the saline. The silicone shell sur
rounding the new soybean oil implants, howev
er, is "textured silicone."
"A fuzzy material on the outside causes the

body to be irritated so a layer of water surrounds
the shell, making leaks less likely," she said.
The soybean oil could also decrease a risk of
fissures by lubricating the shelL
Although not proven by comprehensive
studies, leakage of silicone has been shown to
cause drastic diseases in some patients. "The
diseases include neurology problems, rashes,
joint pains, chronic fatigue and short-term
memory loss," Wright said.
Doctors also want to test the mammograph
ic properties of the soybean oil.
"The implant was designed so that mam mo
graphic X-rays could penetrate the implant,"
Lebovic said.
Wright elaborated that "with saline, doctors
cannot see all the breast tissue. Since soybean
oil contains the same fatty substance as is in the
breast, mammographs could be improved."
The study is also testing the implants for cos
metic improvements.
Since saline is watery, "women are not com
pletely satisfied with the look and feel of the
saline implants," Wright said. Soybean oil, on
the other hand, is more fatty and could offer
more satisfying cosmetic results.
Doctors are also experimenting with a
transponder, a small computer chip contained
in the implant, which would provide critical
medical information about the implant.
"Women do not know the exact date when
they got the implants in, the manufacturer or
the size," Wright said. "The transponder could
give that information immediately to doctors."

LipoMatrix, a subsidiary of the Collagen
Company, manufactures the soybean implant.
"LipoMatrix is a Palo Alto-based company,
but it is operating out of Switzerland because of
problems encountered in the United States
when developing the implants," Lebovic said.
The implants are also being tested by other
researchers at the Breast Center in Van Nuys,
Calif., Washington University, Johns Hopkins
University and the University of Florida at
Gainesville. Each institution, including Stan
ford, will perform 10 surgeries, for a total of 50
surgeries.
"The 10 surgeries at Stanford will be com
pleted before May," Lebovic said. "The national
study will be finalized within one year and the
results will be presented."
Wright said researchers will perform a five
year follow up on all 50 patients.
A European study of the soybean implants
was performed last year, and "[researchers] are
tabulating the results," Lebovic said. She added
that the studies have reported no major prob
lems or complications.
"LipoMatrix is putting in the effort to make
a safe product and test it effectively," Lebovic
said. "They are making the effort to involve doc
tors and surgeons from all disciplines. It truly is
a comprehensive study â€” not just a study of
how the implant looks.
"In my opinion this is not the end-all
implant," Lebovic said. "It's just the first in a
series. Doctors will begin looking to natural
materials and focusing on health care concerns."
