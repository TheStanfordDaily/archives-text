Sexual assault complaint
A sexual assault was reported to have
occurred on campus Feb. 5.
The victim, a female Stanford student,
reported the assault to Cowell Student
Health Center on Feb. 13 and then agreed to
report the incident to the police. According to
the police bulletin, the victim declined to pro
vide details of the incident or identify the sus
pect.
"We are trying to work with the victim
right now to tell us what happened so that we
can prevent this from happening again," said
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
The incident had been reported in the
police's public bulletin as a rape last week but
was later changed to sexual assault. A sexual
assault can be attempted rape or any other
forms of sexual violence. Penetration is
required for rape.
It is illegal under the California Penal
Code for the police to release the name of the
victim.
One sexual assault was reported at Stan
ford in both 1992 and 1994. None were
reported in 1993.
Fans fight at game
Two California attorneys argued their
sides at a recent Stanford-Cal basketball
game rather than in the nearest courtroom.
Representing Stanford and UC-Berkeley,
the lawyers went head to head Feb. 15 — the
same game at which Oski the Bear took on
the Tree.
After the referee called a foul against the
UC-Berkeley team, a Stanford alumnus
stood up and cheered, according to Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"The Cal fan was upset and said to the
Stanford graduate that he was an idiot and
that the foul had been an offensive foul and
not a defensive foul," he said.
The two fans proceeded to engage in a
heated verbal exchange that culminated with
the Cal fan striking the Stanford alumnus on
the back of the head.
"In order to avoid escalation, the Stanford
fan got up, left his seat, went to the police,
and we made a report," he said.
After the two fans were separated, the
Stanford fan returned to the arena and fin
ished watching the game, Niemeyer said.
Subsequently, a doctor said the Stanford
fan had whiplash and a slight contusion,
Niemeyer said.
"Based on our investigation ... the Dis
trict Attorney has charged the defendant
with battery," Niemeyer said, naming the
defendant as Paul Christian Scheley, a 33-

year-old Hayward attorney.
"Charges are being filed as we speak and
he will be booked at a later time," Niemeyer
said.
Robbery at Stern
Two juveniles attempting to steal a carry
ing case filled with tapes from Stern Hall Fri
day night were stopped by a couple of Uni
versity students, according to the Stanford
Police.
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said the youths
"drew attention to themselves" while hang
ing around Stern. When they attempted to
leave with the red case and tapes, "people
started yelling at them. They started running
and they dropped some of the stuff," he
added.
"The attempted thefts didn't come to
fruition," Niemeyer said.
Sophomore Jeremy Schreiber witnessed
the events Friday night. According to
Schreiber, the two young males entered a
Twain dorm room at about 11:35 p.m. and
attempted to leave with a freshman's carry
ing case, tapes and compact discs.
When Stanford students confronted the
pair, Schreiber said the teenagers dropped
some of the tapes they were carrying and ran
away.
Schreiber also said he saw the same two
youths earlier that evening in the Toyon
parking lot. They were making noise and
yelling that they were "looking for a party,"
he added.
While at Twain, Schreiber said the youths
were also yelling at some girls in the women's
restroom.
Schreiber added that the missing compact
discs were recovered the next day by Stanford
postal workers.
One of the unidentified males was
described by Schreiber as about 17-years-old,
5 feet 6 inches tall, with short, light brown
hair, wearing a Berkeley sweatshirt and
jeans. Schreiber described the second teenag
er as 5 feet 9 inches tall, with longer, dark
brown hair, wearing a black T-shirt, baseball
cap and jeans.
According to Schreiber, while leaving
Larkin the teenagers also dropped a bottle of
champagne which they allegedly took from
the Larkin "Screw Your Roommate" dance.
Progressive yields petty theft
A petty theft occurred at ZAP in Cowell
Cluster during a progressive party on Satur
day, Feb. 18.
"I left my black leather jacket and my
keys, which were attached to one of those red

Stanford credit card holders. It had my driv
er's license, credit cards and money in it and
the jacket had my camera in it," said senior
Shelley Shick.
"Before my friend left, at about 11:30 p.m.,
she put all that stuff in the pockets of the
jacket and hung it in the cleaning closet ...
and then turned off the light," Shick said.
"The next morning, I woke up at 7:30 a.m.
and the jacket was gone," Shick said. Howev
er, the wallet was recovered yesterday —
with the money but without the keys — at
the East Bay shore Post Office, she said.
Equipment stolen from KZSU
A break-in at the Stanford radio station
KZSU resulted in the theft of a Lexicon digi
tal effects processor, which has an estimated
value of less than $400, according to Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
KZSU reported the electronic sound
equipment missing on Feb. 11, and there are
no suspects at this time, Niemeyer said. The
theft happened sometime between Feb. 1 and
Feb. 8.
"An unknown person or persons took the
Lexicon digital effects processor, which was
bolted to a rack of other electronic equip
ment," Niemeyer said. "The thief knew
where it was and how it was secured. They
brought tools and left no physical evi
dence."
Niemeyer added that police have the serial
number and a description of the "black metal
case." The theft was also entered into the
National Stolen Property Systems index, he
said.
"If someone fmds it or brings information
about it, we'll know that it was the stolen
one," he added.
Jewelry stolen
A burglar stole jewelry from an EAST
house resident the morning of Feb. 19.
"An unknown suspect entered the
unlocked room and took a jewelry box with
jewelry inside," said Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer.
"I didn't discover it until the morning and
I was in the dorm the whole time the bur
glary must have happened," said the victim,
Lisa Lee, a Council of Presidents member.
"It was a pretty nice jewelry box that was
given to me as a gift and it had real and cos
tume jewelry inside," said Lee, a senior. Also
stolen were a leather folder, a filofax and a
mug which had change in it, she said.

Equipment stolen from KZSU
A break-in at the Stanford radio station
KZSU resulted in the theft of a Lexicon digi
tal effects processor, which has an estimated
value of less than $400, according to Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
KZSU reported the electronic sound
equipment missing on Feb. 11, and there are
no suspects at this time, Niemeyer said. The
theft happened sometime between Feb. 1 and
Feb. 8.
"An unknown person or persons took the
Lexicon digital effects processor, which was
bolted to a rack of other electronic equip
ment," Niemeyer said. "The thief knew
where it was and how it was secured. They
brought tools and left no physical evi
dence."
Niemeyer added that police have the serial
number and a description of the "black metal
case." The theft was also entered into the
National Stolen Property Systems index, he
said.
"If someone fmds it or brings information
about it, we'll know that it was the stolen
one," he added.
Jewelry stolen

house resident the morning of Feb. 19.

Sexual assault complaint
A sexual assault was reported to have
occurred on campus Feb. 5.
The victim, a female Stanford student,
reported the assault to Cowell Student
Health Center on Feb. 13 and then agreed to
report the incident to the police. According to
the police bulletin, the victim declined to pro
vide details of the incident or identify the sus
pect.
"We are trying to work with the victim
right now to tell us what happened so that we
can prevent this from happening again," said
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
The incident had been reported in the
police's public bulletin as a rape last week but
was later changed to sexual assault. A sexual
assault can be attempted rape or any other
forms of sexual violence. Penetration is
required for rape.
It is illegal under the California Penal
Code for the police to release the name of the
victim.
One sexual assault was reported at Stan
ford in both 1992 and 1994. None were
reported in 1993.
Fans fight at game
Two California attorneys argued their
sides at a recent Stanford-Cal basketball
game rather than in the nearest courtroom.
Representing Stanford and UC-Berkeley,
the lawyers went head to head Feb. 15 — the
same game at which Oski the Bear took on
the Tree.
After the referee called a foul against the
UC-Berkeley team, a Stanford alumnus
stood up and cheered, according to Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"The Cal fan was upset and said to the
Stanford graduate that he was an idiot and
that the foul had been an offensive foul and
not a defensive foul," he said.
The two fans proceeded to engage in a
heated verbal exchange that culminated with
the Cal fan striking the Stanford alumnus on
the back of the head.
"In order to avoid escalation, the Stanford
fan got up, left his seat, went to the police,
and we made a report," he said.
After the two fans were separated, the
Stanford fan returned to the arena and fin
ished watching the game, Niemeyer said.
Subsequently, a doctor said the Stanford
fan had whiplash and a slight contusion,
Niemeyer said.
"Based on our investigation ... the Dis
trict Attorney has charged the defendant
with battery," Niemeyer said, naming the
defendant as Paul Christian Scheley, a 33-

year-old Hayward attorney.
"Charges are being filed as we speak and
he will be booked at a later time," Niemeyer
said.
Robbery at Stern
Two juveniles attempting to steal a carry
ing case filled with tapes from Stern Hall Fri
day night were stopped by a couple of Uni
versity students, according to the Stanford
Police.
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said the youths
"drew attention to themselves" while hang
ing around Stern. When they attempted to
leave with the red case and tapes, "people
started yelling at them. They started running
and they dropped some of the stuff," he
added.
"The attempted thefts didn't come to
fruition," Niemeyer said.
Sophomore Jeremy Schreiber witnessed
the events Friday night. According to
Schreiber, the two young males entered a
Twain dorm room at about 11:35 p.m. and
attempted to leave with a freshman's carry
ing case, tapes and compact discs.
When Stanford students confronted the
pair, Schreiber said the teenagers dropped
some of the tapes they were carrying and ran
away.
Schreiber also said he saw the same two
youths earlier that evening in the Toyon
parking lot. They were making noise and
yelling that they were "looking for a party,"
he added.
While at Twain, Schreiber said the youths
were also yelling at some girls in the women's
restroom.
Schreiber added that the missing compact
discs were recovered the next day by Stanford
postal workers.
One of the unidentified males was
described by Schreiber as about 17-years-old,
5 feet 6 inches tall, with short, light brown
hair, wearing a Berkeley sweatshirt and
jeans. Schreiber described the second teenag
er as 5 feet 9 inches tall, with longer, dark
brown hair, wearing a black T-shirt, baseball
cap and jeans.
According to Schreiber, while leaving
Larkin the teenagers also dropped a bottle of
champagne which they allegedly took from
the Larkin "Screw Your Roommate" dance.
Progressive yields petty theft
