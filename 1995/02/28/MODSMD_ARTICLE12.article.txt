## Senate to vote on balanced-budget bill 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — After a 13-year
s truggle, a precedent-shattering vote in the
House and a month-long Senate debate, the
fate of a balanced-budget amendment hinged
yesterday on five uncommitted Democrats. As
star players in the sort of drama the Capitol
thrives on, they were being coy.
"Never before have we been this close to
passing the balanced-budget amendment,"
said GOP Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio.
Both sides read their final lines in advance
of today's vote.
Supporters held a news conference in the
Capitol parking lot. Their backdrop was a
gigantic tote board calculating the federal debt
to 13 digits.
"The debt is the threat," said Sen. Larry
Craig, R-Idaho. "We must stop building this
monstrous debt that can imprison our future
generations as nothing else can."
Opponents relied on behind-the-scenes lob
bying by President Clinton and others to firm
up the 34 votes needed to defeat the measure.
"We're not throwing in the towel by any
means," said White House press secretary
Mike McCurry, even as he made clear the
amendment wasn't the same as having one of
Clinton's "top legislative priorities" up for
grabs.
But the five Democrats everyone most
wanted to hear from — North Dakotans Kent
Conrad and Byron Dorgan, Sam Nunn of
Georgia, Wendell Ford of Kentucky and John
Breaux of Louisiana — said through aides that
they weren't ready to announce a final posi

tion.
Supporters said they needed three more
votes to prevail, and some harbored last
minute hopes they could persuade Oregon
Sen. Mark Hatfield, the lone GOP opponent,
to reverse his position.
But Hatfield's press secretary, Julie
McGregor, put a damper on such hopes, say
ing, "He won't change his mind."
Supporters considered Breaux and Dorgan
most likely to swing behind the measure; Ford
and Conrad the least. That made Nunn the
focus of attention, after his speech last week
demanding a provision that would bar federal
judges from becoming involved in tax and
spending rulings in the course of resolving
lawsuits arising from the amendment.
In a debate laced with partisan politics, sev
eral wavering Democrats also sought protec
tion for Social Security.
With several proposed changes scheduled to
be voted on before today's roll call on final pas
sage, Republicans said they weren't agreeing
to any amendments to the amendment.
Instead, they faxed to Nunn pledges from
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and House
Speaker Newt Gingrich to deal with his con
cerns in follow-up legislation. "We think we
can get him everything he needs," said Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
In Atlanta, Nunn said he wanted the
amendment itself altered to foreclose such
judicial intervention. "They aren't elected," he
declared of federal judges at a news confer

ence. "They have life tenure. This country
started without taxation without representa
tion. I don't think you want to backdoor it
now."
Conrad, asked in a TV interview about
GOP reluctance to accept changes on limiting
judicial intervention, protecting Social Securi
ty and other topics, said Republicans may
"have to decide whether they really want an
amendment or whether they want a political
statement."
Republican Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas
gave grudging endorsement after voting
against such measures for years.
"In the past, I have referred to this amend
ment as a sham and a gimmick," she said.
"This year I intend to vote for final passage...
I do so not as a result of a change in my views
or beliefs or because of some revelation that
this amendment does not suffer from some of
the flaws, [but] simply and solely to eliminate
it as an excuse for not cutting spending."
Whatever the outcome, the amendment
was closer to passage than at any time since
1982, when the most recent drive to enact a
balanced-budget amendment gathered steam
in response to the run-up in federal debt dur
ing the Reagan administration.
Democrats conceded that the amendment is
hugely popular in the abstract, but said voters
would change their minds after actual spend
ing cuts begin to be felt.
If passed by the Senate, it would require
ratification by three-quarters of the states to
become part of the Constitution.
