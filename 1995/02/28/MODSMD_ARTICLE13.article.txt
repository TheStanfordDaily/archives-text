High-tech airport to open today
DENVER (AP) — A conga line of snowplows,
tugs and trucks loaded with equipment wound its
way from Denver's old airport to its $4.9 billion new
one yesterday, hours before the first passenger
flight was scheduled to land.
Most of the 2,000 vehicles in the convoy traveled
at speeds of no more than 15 mph to Denver Inter
national Airport along back roads to avoid freeway
congestion. The 22-mile trip from Stapleton Inter
national Airport was expected to take about two
hours.
Mayor Wellington Webb said the new airport,
which is 16 months late and $3.2 billion over bud
get, represents "the natural evolution of Denver's
transportation history — from Pony Express to the
stagecoach to railroads."
Earlier, Webb greeted the first commercial cargo
flight to land at the new airport: a Federal Express
plane that arrived from Memphis at 12:41 a.m., 20
minutes early.
"I think now we can put the jokes behind us,"
Webb said. "DIA does include airplanes."
The airport's opening has been delayed four
times because of construction problems, including
an automated baggage system that chewed up lug
gage and spit it out. It eventually was replaced by an
old-fashioned tug-and-cart system at all airlines
except United.
About a dozen investigations are under way into
allegations of wrongdoing in the airport project,
including shoddy construction.
And bondholders sued the city yesterday, claim
ing officials concealed problems with the project.
The class-action lawsuit seeks unspecified damages
for investors, whose bonds lost value because of
delays and cost overruns. A call to city officials
wasn't returned immediately.
While the convoy over the rolling prairie around
Denver was a dramatic sight, about 70 percent of
the equipment was moved from Stapleton over the
weekend as city workers and business owners took
advantage of springlike weather.
The first commercial passenger flight was sched
uled to leave the new airport for Kansas City, Mo.,
at 6 a.m. today, followed by the first commercial
passenger arrival, from Colorado Springs, at 6:11
am.
About 1,300 flights and an estimated 88,000 pas
sengers are expected to pass through the new air
port every day, making it, like Stapleton, the sixth
busiest airport in the nation.
Apple settles keyboard lawsuit
HASTINGS, Minn. (AP) — Apple Computer has
settled with a secretary who blamed her crippling
hand and arm injuries on Apple and IBM keyboards,

dropping out of the first such lawsuit against the
two companies ever to go to trial.
Terms of the settlement, which came eight weeks
into the trial, were not disclosed.
IBM, which remains as the lone defendant, said
it doesn't intend to settle.
Nancy Urbanski, 30, claims Apple and IBM
didn't adequately warn her about the risk of repeti
tive stress injuiy, or RSI.
Urbanski typed 95 words a minute in her job as a
high school secretary and said her disability caused
her to lose her job.
"She can't tie her kids' shoes ... she can't chop
or cook. She can't bathe her kids," her lawyer
Steven Phillips said yesterday.
Phillips said the settlement reached Friday
included a requirement that the terms be kept
secret. He said Apple settled after supplying the
plaintiff with confidential company documents that
he described only as "explosive."
Apple spokeswoman Betty Taylor disputed
Phillips' characterization, saying the company set
tled because its attorneys turned over the materials
too late.
IBM yesterday asked state District Judge
Richard Spicer to declare a mistrial because the jury
could be influenced by Apple's settlement. Spicer
refused.
Michael Cerussi, an attorney for IBM, said the
Apple settlement "puts us on a more even playing
field" because IBM can now be judged solely on its
own conduct.
Tom Beermann, an IBM spokesman in Armonk,
N.Y., said: "The fact remains that there is no scien
tific evidence linking computer keyboards to
injury."
Defense witness testifies early
LOS ANGELES (AP) — O.J. Simpson's key alibi
witness testified on videotape yesterday that she
saw his white Bronco parked crookedly outside his
estate at about the time prosecutors contend he was
two miles away killing his ex-wife and her friend.
Rosa Lopez, whose testimony could be played for
jurors later should she leave the country, said she
saw the Bronco on the street just after 10 p.m. on
June 12.
Lopez, a maid for Simpson's next-door neighbor,
testified in Spanish, with each question and answer
translated by an interpreter. Lopez said she was
walking her employers' golden retriever that night.
She said she wasn't wearing a watch but had
checked a clock before she left.
Prosecutors contend Simpson drove the Bronco
to Nicole Brown Simpson's home, where he alleged
ly murdered her and friend Ronald Goldman about
10:15. With no witnesses, they have timed the mur
ders to the howling of Ms. Simpson's dog.
