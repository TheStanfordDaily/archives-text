## US forces guard UN retreat

MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP)
â€” U.S. Marines swept ashore
early today on the beaches of
Mogadishu, this time not to save
starving Somalis but to protect
U.N. peacekeepers retreating
from the country's chaos.
The first amphibious wave was
met on the beach at one minute
after midnight by its own com
manding general and about 150
Pakistani peacekeepers backed by
tanks.
About 18 hours earlier, a van
guard force of approximately 150
Marines landed by helicopter and
Helicat air cushion vessels on a
beach at the city's seaside airport
to set up a command headquar
ters and landing routes for the
2,000 other Marines and Italian
soldiers to follow.
Although staged with the pre
cision of a combat invasion, the
Marines did not land on a hostile
beach and were greeted by

friends, not foes.
The airport and nearby seaport
were controlled by U.N. peace
keepers, who have been keeping
away children, scavengers and the
curious for days.
Although they prepared for the
possibility, commanders of the
seven-nation U.S.-led forces did
not expect a direct confrontation
with Somali militia.
Instead, the biggest threat may
be from stray bullets, mortars and
rocket-propelled grenades fired by
the rival militias warring among
themselves.
Commanding the operation was
Marine Lt. Gen. Anthony C. Zinni,
one of the chief planners of the first
U.S.-led intervention in Somalia
that came in December 1992.
"Coming in, I don't see any
real threat or problem," he told
reporters yesterday. "Going out,
of course, there's nothing behind
us. We are the last units out and

that's probably a few days away."
The Pakistani and Bangladeshi
peacekeepers are the last of a
U.N. force that once numbered
38,000 from 21 nations.
Mogadishu was relatively calm
Monday, a day after warring
Somali militias battled outside
the main gate of the airport.
Stray rounds fell at the airport
Sunday, and one Somali police
man was slightly wounded.
Another clan fight broke out
Monday farther from the port and
airport.
Shots and explosions could be
heard, but far fewer stray rounds
appeared to be striking near U.S.
and U.N. positions.
Since entering Somalia in
December, 1992, 42 Americans
have died, 30 in combat. More
than 100 other peacekeepers also
died. Somali casualties, never offi
cially recorded, were estimated in
the hundreds.
