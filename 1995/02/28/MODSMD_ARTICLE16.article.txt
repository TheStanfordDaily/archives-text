# Fewer military bases to be closed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Pentagon shortened its base clo
sure list under pressure to mini
mize high up-front costs, Defense
Secretary William Perry said yes
terday.
But a senior Republican law
maker said the list was too short.
The Clinton administration,
making final preparations for issu
ing the list on Tuesday, ran into
the iron logic of base closings: The
savings come years down the road;
in the short term, base closings cost
money.
"It is a heavy price we are pay
ing," Perry said during a question
and-answer session at an American
Legion meeting in Washington yes
terday.
"The good news is that by 1999,
we will be saving $4 billion not only
that year but every year thereafter

as a result of closures."
Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio,
chairman of the House Republican
Caucus, said the administration
apparently was satisfied to keep
more military overhead than it
needs.
"We still have a tremendous
number of bases in our country
that are no longer necessary or
needed for national security,"
Boehner said. "As painful as it is
for the communities in which those
bases are located, we ought to bite
the bullet."
Late yesterday afternoon, Perry
signed the documents containing
his recommendations to the Base
Closure and Realignment Commis
sion.
At least one installation, Oak
land Army Base in California, with
more than 2,000 jobs, appeared to

survive after having been put on
the Army's initial list of recom
mended shutdowns.
"It is my understanding that
Oakland Army Base is off the list,
and that's very good news," Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said
Monday evening after talking to
Deputy Defense Secretary John
Deutch.
After an initial round of closures
in 1988, a base closure law drafted
by the current House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, led to
closure rounds in 1991, 1993 and
this year. The law has no provision
for further rounds.
"We ought to look toward
extending it," Boehner said.
Perry has said he would like to
hold another closure round in 1997
but thinks Congress would oppose
the idea.
