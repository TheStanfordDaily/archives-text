## Editorial Affirmative debate 
### 
Students should keep
open minds in debate
about affirmative action

LIKE IT or not, it's only a
matter of months before the
nation and campus are
engaged in heated debate over
affirmative action.
Polling data indicates that a
substantial majority of Americans
are dissatisfied with current affir
mative action programs. As a
result, politicians are planning to
seize on this issue and give it the
same attention in 1996 that immi
gration reform received in 1994.
Republican leaders have fired
the first shots. In declaring his
candidacy for president, Sen. Phil
Gramm of Texas promised that
his administration would disman
tle affirmative action as the coun
try knows it. Closer to home, Gov.
Pete Wilson has announced his
support for a 1996 ballot initiative
which would eliminate affirmative
action in all state programs. He
says the state suffers when it is
compelled to judge on factors
other than merit. In fact, the gov
ernor declared that he would issue
an executive order to the same
effect for agencies under his
purview.
In response to these proposals,
African-American Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown immediate
ly labeled the reforms as racist.
Other minority leaders accused
the GOP of playing the race card
for votes, while turning back the
civil rights clock 40 years.
These were only the first rum
blings from a storm just clearing
the horizon.
Affirmative action programs
have, in one way or another, prob
ably affected us all. While they
alter hiring or admission stan
dards, they also promote diversity
and mitigate intangible barriers
faced by certain groups. Accord
ingly, as an issue for political
debate and public discussion,

affirmative action has always
been difficult because it is so per
sonal. Indeed, it is not uncommon
for people to simply hide or sup
press their views on the subject
for fear that backlash may be too
great.
But it is critical that members
of the Stanford community not
bury their heads and opinions in
the sand, and that we not allow
the sorts of extreme labeling,
overreaction and academic intol
erance which foster such suppres
sion.
People who support affirmative
action programs are not necessar
ily advocating so-called handouts
for certain groups at the expense
of others more deserving. The rea
sons behind affirmative action are
much more complex than a selfish
desire for a free break.
Similarly, opponents of affirma
tive action are not necessarily
racists who arrogantly think they
have been cheated out of deserved
advantages. Many opponents of
the current system advocate
switching to socioeconomic affir
mative action programs which,
arguably, may do more to help the
truly disadvantaged.
And even those who do not
advocate a substitute program
make sound arguments. Many
believe that affirmative action
programs stigmatize the recipi
ents (and non-recipients of the
same group) as tokens and perpet
uate images of inferiority.
In short, no matter what sound
bites the governor or speaker pro
duce, there are no easy answers.
Critical to reaching the difficult
answers and workable conclu
sions, however, is a free and open
debate. That will only happen if
people feel they can share their
views without retaliatory hyper
bole and name calling.
Don't bury your head in the
sand on this one — it's too impor
tant. Don't try to bury anyone
else's, either; suppressed
thoughts are not changed
thoughts, they're actually just
more stubborn.
