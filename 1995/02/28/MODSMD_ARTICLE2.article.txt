Stanford's Fleet Street Singers
recently swept the national a cap
pella scene by winning prestigious
1995 Contemporary A cappella
Recording Awards for their latest
album, "What You Want," which
was released last September.
The Contemporary A cappella
Society of America honored the

group with awards in three of its
four categories: best album, best
song and best soloist. In the best
arrangement category, Fleet Street
was a runner-up.
"We were ecstatic when we
heard that we had won all these
awards.... A cappella is about ca
maraderie between groups rather
than competition, so it's especially
nice to be appreciated," said Fleet
Street Director Young Moo Kim, a

graduate student.
Along with the best album
award, Fleet Street received best
song for their version of "Ave
Maria." Best soloist went to recent
graduate Kevin Bleyer, for his ren
dition of the song, "Black Coffee."
Runner-up in best arrangement
went to Fleet Street's original song,
"What's Opera Doc?"
