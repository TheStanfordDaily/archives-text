# Fleet Street wins national awards
## Album 'What You Want' sweeps three of four categories

Stanford's Fleet Street Singers
recently swept the national a cap
pella scene by winning prestigious
1995 Contemporary A cappella
Recording Awards for their latest
album, "What You Want," which
was released last September.
The Contemporary A cappella
Society of America honored the

group with awards in three of its
four categories: best album, best
song and best soloist. In the best
arrangement category, Fleet Street
was a runner-up.
"We were ecstatic when we
heard that we had won all these
awards.... A cappella is about ca
maraderie between groups rather
than competition, so it's especially
nice to be appreciated," said Fleet
Street Director Young Moo Kim, a

graduate student.
Along with the best album
award, Fleet Street received best
song for their version of "Ave
Maria." Best soloist went to recent
graduate Kevin Bleyer, for his ren
dition of the song, "Black Coffee."
Runner-up in best arrangement
went to Fleet Street's original song,
"What's Opera Doc?"
The society announced the
awards in its February newsletter,
although Fleet Street was notified
several weeks earlier. Even though
there is no monetary compensa
tion, Fleet Street members said
they considered it a high honor to
receive the awards.
"The [Contemporary A cappella
Recording Awards] are a barome
ter of success for collegiate a cap
pella groups," said senior Nirav
Tolia, Fleet Street business man
ager.
Deke Sharon, the society's pres
ident, praised Fleet Street's work.
"The quality [of their music] is
fantastic. They're very good per
formers and their recordings are
remarkably professional for a stu
dent-run group," he said.
According to Sharon, competi
tion for the male collegiate division
was intense. There are more than
300 groups across the country, and
at least 25 put out albums during
the 1994 calendar year, Sharon
said.

Contemporary A cappella
Recording Awards have been
known to favor East Coast artists,
since there are significantly fewer
collegiate groups in the west. How
ever, Bay Area groups — especially
at Stanford and UC-Berkeley —
"have done very well," Sharon
said. Stanford's Mixed Company
has received awards in the past.
Fleet Street's 1992 album, "50-
Minute Fun Break," also won
numerous awards: best album,
best song, best original song, best
artwork and best mixing and engi
neering.
"We had high expectations
while recording ['What You Want']
because of the success of '50-
Minute Fun Break,' " Tolia said.
According to Sharon, the society
has "scaled down on special
awards" since Fleet Street last
competed in 1993. Presently, the
society awards only four main
awards and runners-up.
The society awards the Contem
porary A cappella Recording
Awards annually in each of its
three amateur divisions: collegiate
male, female and mixed. It also has
a separate division for professional
groups.
