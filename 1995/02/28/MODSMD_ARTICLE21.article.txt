## A
						plot against white men? 
### 
THERE IS a new trend on this cam
pus, and perhaps in other places as
well. It has to do with marginaliza
tion, respect and a general lack of under
standing.
It sometimes seems like there are sev
eral hundred organizations on this cam
pus that have been formed to discuss cul
tures, group oppression and discrimina
tion. This becomes clear to me every time
I see the banners in White Plaza, drop by
the Women's Center or find the latest
issue of CommunicAsians in my post
office box. I have personal interest in
only a few of these organizations, but I
understand the need and interest of oth
ers to belong to these groups and to use
them as vehicles for commentary on life
at Stanford and beyond.
What is beyond me is the negative
reaction of some students on campus to
these groups. A virtual plethora of
friends and acquaintances of mine have
made their opinions on this subject
extraordinarily clear: that the very pres
ence of these organizations on campus is
somehow offensive to historically advan
taged groups, and in a weird way,
oppressing them.
Yep, it's true. The groups that are
formed out of the ethnic centers and the
LGBCC and the Women's Center and the
variety of other organizations are all
devoted to plotting against rich white
men. We have secret tunnels that run
below the campus, relaying messages

about how and when to set off explosives
in any place considered to be a bastion of
the white male. We are bribing the
admissions committee to let in students
of color, waiting for the day until we out
number white people and can take over
the campus. The Women's Center is
seeking its special fee just to buy guns,
bows and arrows to pick off men on the
street. It's all true, you are right.
Yes, and the best thing you can do, as
one of these historically privileged mem
bers of society, is one of two things:
either hate us and rally the old forces
together, or to seek some sort or
marginalization yourself. Both of these
tactics will allow you to form interest
groups of your own. Or, if the leadership
initiative is not strong, join one of the
already-formed groups on campus.
Join a Greek organization and discuss
how the administration is trying desper
ately to get rid of your time-honored tra
ditions by giving more space and money
to interest groups on campus. Congre
gate with your friends and refuse to
attend any events that might be focused
around a culture other than your own.
Talk about how American history started
with the Revolutionary War. Oppose eth
nic studies classes, not seeing the impor
tance of a variety of perspectives in your
education.
Or swing the other way. Become the
sensitive new-age guy. Strap on an empa
thy belly. Feel the pain of womankind.

Live in either a co-op or a fraternity and
then deny your identity as a member of a
privileged class by gaining a different
label that subverts your identity alto
gether. Call yourself more oppressed
than anybody else because there's
nobody there to support you. Do it. It's
easy and you don't have to think twice
about the issues that are being thrown
into the public arena by interest groups.
But wait, then there's the third way
out of this dilemma. Accept the fact that
you are privileged. Don't try to deny it
with different identities and cover-ups
and ifs, ands or buts. It means that when
somebody brings up an issue of racism,
you sometimes stay silent instead of
launching into some story about how you
felt when you saw the Rodney King beat
ing on television. It means that you deal
with yourself as who you are. It's a diffi
cult journey and it will make you uncom
fortable. It demands that you listen to
people more than you talk, because your
story has had more time than others
have.
It means that you invest time to learn,
understand, respect and accept.

Sudha would like to point out to Seth
Goldstein that Storrs, Conn., is not only a
great place to live but also a lovely vaca
tion spot.
