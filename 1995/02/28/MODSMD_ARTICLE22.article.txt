Letter on West Bank policy contained many half-truths

ON FEB. 24 The Daily published a
letter entitled "West Bank policy
is a sustained act of state terror
ism." The argument presented in the
letter, blaming Israeli policy for the
series of ruthless attacks of Islamic ter
rorism against Israeli civilians, con
tained so many half-truths, innuendoes
and misleading claims that it warrants
no serious response on its own merit.
However, feeling that the large majority
of students are poorly informed on Mid
dle East politics and might hence be
misled by the letter's demagoguery, we
feel compelled to set the record straight
on a number of facts.
Since Yitahak Rabin's Labor party
beat incumbent Yitzhak Shamir's Likud
party in a national election in 1992,
Israel has consistently and relentlessly
sought a territorial compromise with
the Palestinians. Months of secret nego

tiations culminated in Israeli military
withdrawal from the cities of Gaza and
Jericho as a first step towards establish
ing a Palestinian national entity. It is
difficult to see how these withdrawals,
as well as ongoing negotiations about
Israeli withdrawal from the majority of
the West Bank correspond with the poli
cy of "slow annexation of the West
Bank" presented by Rebecca Stein in
her letter.
Stein's statements that the Israeli
government sanctions settler terrorism
against Arab civilians is ludicrous. Her
assertion that Baruch Goldstein's attack
on Palestinian worshippers one year ago
was "the tragic result of army collusion"
is completely unfounded. Her attempt to
support this assertion by mentioning
that "Goldstein was a reserve officer in
the Israel army" in order to insinuate
that Goldstein was leading a military

attack deliberately ignores the fact that
all Israeli males, including ourselves,
are members of the Israeli reserve
forces, and that Goldstein wasn't on
active duty at the time of the attack.
The fact is that Goldstein's attack was
the tragic and isolated act of a madman.
Though Stein creates the impression
that the Israeli government supports
"settler terrorism," in reality leaders
and members of the Jewish under
ground are imprisoned in Israeli jails,
the result of a massive crackdown con
ducted by Israel.
Stein fails to mention that the attack
on a crowded bus station in Beit Lid was
the last in an ongoing series of attacks
on Israelis in the heart of sovereign
Israel. This campaign is as part of a
"holy war" against Israel by fundamen
talist Palestinian organizations, with
the declared purpose of destroying the

peace negotiations that favor compro
mise and mutual existence, and return
ing to the original dogma of creating a
Palestinian state on the ruins of the
Jewish state. Despite Yasser Arafat's
failure to restrain these organizations,
Israel has continuously stated its com
mitment to the peace process, and nego
tiations have continued after every bru
tal incident. To blame Rabin's govern
ment, that has taken upon itself histori
cal concessions with little reciprocity
from the Palestinian side, for the terror
ist attacks is inconceivable. It is thus no
wonder that Stein chooses to selectively
overlook the facts in order to support an
unfounded argument.
