# Three upcoming events allow students to learn more about Greek system
## 
### 
It is our understanding that there has
been some discussion regarding changes
in the Rush process this year. To avoid
speculation and improve communication
between the Greek system and the Stan
ford community, we are excited to inform
the Stanford community about three
events coming up this week that com
prise Greek Week. These events reflect
both an effort to clarify the Rush process
and our desire that the Greek system
benefit the wider Stanford community.
We encourage all students, both Greek
and non-Greek to attend and look for
ward to your participation.
First, tonight at 7 p.m., both the
Interfraternity Council and the Inter-

sorority Council will be holding a "Rush
Open House." The men will be holding
their open house in the Branner lounge,
while the women will be in Wilbur west
dining hall. This event is being held to
demystify the entire Rush process for
both men and women, and will provide
an open forum for individuals interested
in Rush to ask questions and receive
important information from active fra
ternity and sorority members. While
many rumors tend to circulate about the
nature of the Rush process, we encour
age you to take this opportunity to edu
cate yourself about the changes in this
year's program While we realize that
Rush may not be for everyone, it is our
sincere hope that everyone take the time
to stop by on Tuesday to discover for
themselves what Rush is all about.
Second, on Thursday, March 2 at the
Beta house, the IFC and ISC will be
sponsoring a "Party Against Poverty."
This all-campus event will start at 10

p.m., and will feature the band "WET"
and dancing. Admission to this event will
consist of either a non-perishable food
item or an item of clothing which will in
turn be donated to local charity organiza
tions. Please come with one of these two
items, as we cannot accept money at the
door. A current Stanford ID will also be
needed to attend, and, as always, you
must be 21 to drink.
Third, on Saturday, March 4 at the
Phi Delt house is yet another all campus
event — "Dry Snow." Jointly funded and
sponsored by the Stanford Community
Partnership For Alcohol and Other Drug
Abuse Prevention and the Stanford
Greek community, this dry party will
start at 10 p.m. and will feature night
basketball and volleyball, live music,
dancing and a backyard full of snow to
remind us all of Tahoe. Additionally, hot
chocolate, apple cider, virgin mixed
drinks and other non-alcoholic drinks
will be available. Everyone is welcome to

come celebrate the conclusion of the
week and cool off at the Phi Delt house.
Finally, we would like to remind all
freshman and sophomore men and
women that Rush is just around the cor
ner. Sorority Rush is slated to begin on
April 7 and will run through April 11.
Interested women should look for sign
ups in White Plaza in the coming weeks.
Fraternity Rush will begin with a
mandatory information session on April
5. Events for fraternity Rush will start
on April 10 and last through April 24.
We encourage all of you to take part in
the events next week to learn more about
the Greek community here on campus,
and look forward to seeing the under
classmen next quarter during Rush.
