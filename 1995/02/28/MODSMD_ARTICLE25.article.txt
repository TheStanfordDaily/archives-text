Stanford should add drug use
DR
If we could alter the distribution
requirement system so that drug use
was required, that would a very good
thing. What better way to broaden
students' minds, expand their con
sciousness and teach them things
they may know nothing at all about.
No techie dork should be allowed to
graduate without being stoned at
least once. It's wrong and it's inhu
mane.
Bike theft prevention program
I believe that public torture of
hike thieves may be a great preventa
tive measure in order to keep the
bike theft rate down on campus.
More nature photography need
ed
I was just noticing that all of the
pictures in The Daily are of people.
They are not necessarily all students,
of course, but you might want to mix
it up a little bit and have other kinds
of feature pictures in The Daily, such
as more photographs of nature and
other non-human subjects.
Is The Daily racist?
I am damn offended that you
would print The Review's chief logo
on your front page, you racists.
Stanford discriminates against
white males
I think that the new ethnic studies
program is just another way to divide
the campus racially. I am in favor of
an academically and ethnically
diverse campus, but, as a white male,
I feel that the undue focus the
administration and students put on
these programs discriminates
against me.
The Sounding Board rocks
The Sounding Board is the shit!
There's some rad stuff in there in the
same ole place every week. Go figure.
Modern technology.
The Sounding Board welcomes calls
from its readers on any subject, but
The Daily takes no responsibility for
the opinions represented fiere.
