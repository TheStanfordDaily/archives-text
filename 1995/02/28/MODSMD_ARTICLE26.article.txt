# Tuesday Thoughts
## Does Stanford benefit from its alternative scene? 
### 
IS THE alternative scene at Stanford
hypocritical? Betsy Kennedy and
Stewart Richardson probe the ques
tion no one else bothers to ask.
Betsy:
The alternative scene is inherently
hypocritical. By alternative, I am refer
ring to all of those liberal types who are
generally ill-kempt and obscurely pierced
and who often have liberal political issues
on hand.

The hypocrisy lies in the purpose of
their "alternativism." Their unaesthetic
gestures are statements against society,
whether they will admit it or not. More
tangibly, their attire and rejection of
social mores is offensive to the decent cit
izen. Their purpose is to shun society;
thus, by living in society, they are hyp
ocrites. Real alternativism, by definition,
would either be solitude, death or life in a
homogeneous commune of freaks.
When applied to Stanford, a highly
structured and very bureaucratic mini
society, the hypocrisy is glaring in two
major ways. First, because Stanford is by
nature an elitist institution, the "alterna
tive guy" is completely raping himself of
his alternative mission by even touching
the Stanford pi' iron' "it. You vegetari
ans and communists claim to appreciate
that which is not mainstream. Thus, if
you are going to go to college at all (which
by the nature of your fundamental pur
pose you should not), then by no means
should you be taking up a space at Stan
ford that a decent man could have had.

The second way that Stanford alterna
tive people are hypocritical is that they
pay so much money to subject themselves
to this stratified, bureaucratic order.
Surely all of you Columbae and EBF res
idents who fit into my ripped and dirty
description are not conducting a
$100,000 experiment in the name of your
alternative cause. Remember, you can
infest the back of the Coffee House with
out being a registered student.
On a personal level, I would like to pay
tribute to all of you alternative militant
lesbians out there — not all lesbians, just
the ones who look prepared and able to
kick ass. I am scared of you. Upon sight, I
fear for the lives of my more petite Pi Phi
friends. This kind of fear makes me want
to talk about the alternative scene's
hypocrisy.
Stewart:
Let's face it, Pi Phis are easy. But
that's beside the point. Miss Kennedy has
read far to much into the situation.
Sporting ripped jeans and a plaid shirt is
not a profound rejection of society and
the aesthetic ideal; it is simply more com
fortable than the preppy fashions which
the Pi Phis like to dress their frat boys up
in. Also, the "social mores" of the Victori
an era, while perhaps still embraced by a
few pitiable snobs on this campus, are not
representative of American culture and
values. Most people just don't consider
casual attire to be an offense against good
taste.
As for "real alternativism" — "a
homogeneous commune of freaks" — I
don't foresee sororities at Stanford being
housed anytime soon, so Miss Kennedy
and her Pi Phi sisters will just have to
wait on that dream. And regarding the
alleged hypocrisy of attending Stanford
while rejecting Puritan ethics, I never
saw a brochure which stated that "during
your stay at Stanford the University will
revise its once laid-back outlook in favor
of the paternalistic standards of various
Midwestern universities;" also, there is
no hypocrisy in feeling that it is worth
putting up with some stuffy, moralizing
do-gooders for the sake of a Stanford edu
cation.
I don't want to bag on frats and soror
ities too much here Thank God there are
still a few people left at this school who
know that there's more to life than study
ing, roller blading, Fro Yo and a cappella.
It's easy to see that the administration
hates frats (look up "persecution" in the
dictionary and you'll find the Universi
ty's recent treatment of the SAE house),

and this is certainly a good sign. At least
the frat houses haven't (yet) been con
verted to "Handicapped Lesbian Drama
in 1960s Bolivia" theme houses.
Strange as it may seem, the Greek sys
tem is one of the last bastions of diversity
on campus. I'm referring here to sub
stantive diversity, as in people who don't
accept the Fro Yo Stanford lifestyle, cul
ture and value system, as opposed to
M&M diversity (all different colors, all
the same on the inside). The Greek sys
tem is a fine subculture, and I wish it
well.
Similarly, the Greeks should support
EBF and all of the other "alternative
freaks." There aren't many people left on
this campus who are opposing Universi
ty-imposed anality, and we all need to
stick together. Who cares if you don't
happen to like or want to hang out with
your new-found allies? — I don't really
want to spend an evening chilling at the
KA house either.
The point is, there are very few stu
dents left who want options for their
evening plans other than studying and
going to University-approved awareness
raising dorm programs. We need to be
unified if we don't want to see the whole
campus become one big Juice Club fest
("Extra wheat germ for everybody!").
Betsy:
Stewart, first of all, I would like to
thank you for recently cutting your femi
nine long hair. Readers, I trust that Stew
art's liberalism is just a phase, and that
his good sense will come into fruition any
second now. You speak bitterly about the
Pi Phis ... is that because you wish you
were a girl and could be one? Nonethe
less, Stewart, you are apparently deviat
ing from my point about the alternative
scene's hypocrisy. How idealistic of you to
say that we "should all stick together."
This is not beer warfare. Rather, I was
explaining the hypocrisy of alterna
tivism's implied philosophy. I notice that
your reply did not focus on the merits of
your alternative scene.
You claim that the Greek system is
diverse — it's not too diverse. You make
an issue about substantive diversity. You
ingrate. (Ingratitude is also a prominent
symptom of the alternativism.) Not only
do you want diversity, but you also want
a certain kind of diversity ... you liberals
are always complaining.
I will admit that if a disaster such as
alternativism is going to occur at all, the
college years are the best time for it. Peo
ple should falter as much as possible

before entering the real world. Alterna
tive Theta Chi types are essentially mak
ing a lifestyle out of messing up — those
shameless barbaric types have co-ed
showers. Do you think that Theta Chi
residents should have such a free love
attitude when they have children? Cer
tainly not in the interest of their off
spring. Orgies and drugs hardly make for
an ideal toddler atmosphere. I must be
fair and admit that sometimes fraternity
and sorority members approach the state
of being flawed as well. Nevertheless,
unlike the alternative setting, the theme
of fraternal life is a life bracketed by
order. Chaos is futile, Stewart, like your
face.
Stewart:
Aside from the futility of my face,
which is undeniable, your arguments are
misguided. I did not suggest that the
Greek system is internally diverse,
although it may very well be; what I am
saying is that Greek life represents an
option for students which is different
from the dominant culture found in the
sterilized robot dorms.
The existence of the Greek system,
along with the alternative scene, should
demonstrate that Stanford students are
not all identical. This is an obvious point
which has eluded our new administra
tors. Recent policy shifts are intended to
limit residential autonomy (removal of
the old priority system, no dorm funds for
alcohol, de facto imposition of University
cleaning in co-ops through ridiculous
fines for messes, the holding of fraterni
ties to standards which no group of col
lege students could — or should — meet,
et cetera... .) Effectively, Stanford's new
policy is that dorms should all be identi
cal, except for geographic and structural
differences and University-approved
themes. Quick, name three other differ
ences between Manzanita, Kimball, Flo
Mo, and Lag — I certainly can't. There is
too little room for any dorm identities
which are not sanctioned by the Universi
ty. In this sense, the merits of alterna
tivism are hardly relevant, since I'm
advocating substantive diversity in com
munities rather than any particular type
of community. But if I must take a stand
and generalize about alternativism: it
consists of determining one's own values
rather than defining "messing up" by
standards one doesn't agree with. And, of
course, doing lots of good drugs.

Betsy and Stewart will be partying at
EBF this Wednesday.
