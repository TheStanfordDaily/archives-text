Muslims' terrorist activities are are anything but peaceful and just

I SAW a great ad in Monday's Daily.
It was a revelation to me: the Mus
lim Student Awareness Network is
working for peace and justice. I guess
that because they are so peaceful and
quiet we haven't heard from them yet.
What a relief to know they exist. Hey,
if they spend their time and money on

ads they will have less for other activi
ties.
I feel much more secure now. After
all, Islamic movements have peacefully
and with great awareness promoted
peace throughout the world. A bomb in
Argentina peacefully killed over 100
Jews. Another peacefully brought

down a plane in Venezuela. And the
bombs and attacks on Israel are full of
awareness, not to speak about those
peaceful suicide attacks (which all
come with a complementary key to
heavens' gates). And yes, I forgot, very
peacefully, the Palestinian Islamic
movements oppose the peace treaty

between Israel and the PLO. And with
great awareness they do not recognize
Israel's right to exist. Peaceful and jus
tified death-sentences are brought
against those that are not so nice, like
blasphemous Rushdie. Peaceful coer
cion is used to show the light to the
infidels.

And bombing the World Trade Cen
ter, is that part of the awareness week
activities? I guess condemning these
acts will violate their strict policy of
peace and quiet. May I suggest a slo
gan for you guys: Hate will unite us!
