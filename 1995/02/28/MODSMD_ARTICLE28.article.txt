# The 						Sixth Man Club has a positive influence on the mens' basketball team
## 
### 
For the second year in a row, The
Daily has published a letter to the
editor complaining about the Sixth

Man Club. We want to clarify, once
and for all, that the Sixth Man Club
has an enormously positive influence
on the Stanford basketball program
and throughout the season has
repeatedly given us a lift in our
games. The Sixth Man Club is a
group of die-hard basketball fans with
tremendous spirit who come to sup-

port us every game, not just the
UCLAs and Arizonas.
They were the ones who were there
in the beginning of the season when
crowds were very poor — no one
seemed to mind back then. Even dur
ing the 1992-1993, season when our
record was a dismal 7-23, many of the
students who now comprise the Sixth

Man Club were there supporting our
team. The Stanford basketball team
has worked hard to get our program
in to the national spotlight. As we
continue our quest towards the NCAA
tournament, we ask that all students
— Sixth Man Members or not — come
out and support our team in our last
two home games in a couple of weeks.

We know the Sixth Man Club will be
there in full force; we just hope other
students ere there, too.
