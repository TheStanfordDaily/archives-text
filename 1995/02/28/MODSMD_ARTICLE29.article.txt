## Women's tennis freezes in north; men rule Kentucky Team falls in second round 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The Stanford women's tennis
team (9-1 overall, 2-0 in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference's Southern Divi
sion) flew cross country last week
end, only to experience turbu
lence through familiar skies. The
Cardinal crashed and burned 5-4
against the eighth-ranked UCLA
Bruins (9-2, 1-1 in the Pac-10
Southern Division) in the second
round of the USTA/ITA Women's
National Indoor Collegiate Team
Championship in Madison, Wis.
The Cardinal put forth a
valiant effort against a Bruin
team loaded with talent. All of
UCLA's top five singles players
rank nationally among the top
sixty players in the country, head
lined by Jane Chi and Keri Phe
bus, who compete at No. 5 and
No. 8, respectively.
Both Chi and Phebus backed
up their high rankings against the
Cardinal, taking the top two sin
gles matches. Chi downed sopho
more Katie Schlukebir, who is no
stranger to national prominence
joining the top Bruins in the
country's top 10.
Schlukebir and Chi traded
blows until they knotted the first
set score at 5-5. Chi then took
over the set, and consequently the
match, winning 7-5 in that set
and 6-0 in the second.
"She's a great player,"
Schlukebir said. "I played pretty
well until 5-5. After that, it was a
different match. I got really frus
trated and tried to do too much."

Phebus, who compiled a 2-1
record on Schlukebir throughout
the preseason, defeated Stanford
freshmen Ania Bleszynski in the
No. 2 singles match 6-2, 6-1.
Senior Kim Shasby disposed of
UCLA's Paige Yaroshuk, ranked
No. 34, in straight sets 6-4, 6-2.
Sandra De Silva lost her first
match of the year in the No. 4
match, falling 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 to the
38th-ranked Stephanie Chi.
Freshman Julie Scott bounced
back from her first defeat of the
year in Arizona State, providing
valuable depth for the Cardinal at
the No. 5 spot. She captured a 6-2,
6-4 triumph over 60th-ranked

Susie Starrett. Senior Amy
Chiminello tied up the match
with Stanford's third singles vic
tory, winning 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.
The match and the ticket to
advance resided in the doubles
competition. The Cardinal looked
solid in the No. 1 match as
Schlukebir and Bleszynski upset
the eighth-ranked duo of Phebus
and Starrett 6-4, 7-5. The sixth
ranked sister tandem of
Stephanie and Jane Chi proved to
be too much in the No. 2 match,
defeating Chiminello and Scott 6-
4, 6-2.
