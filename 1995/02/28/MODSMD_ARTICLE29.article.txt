## Women's tennis freezes in north; men rule Kentucky Team falls in second round 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The Stanford women's tennis
team (9-1 overall, 2-0 in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference's Southern Divi
sion) flew cross country last week
end, only to experience turbu
lence through familiar skies. The
Cardinal crashed and burned 5-4
against the eighth-ranked UCLA
Bruins (9-2, 1-1 in the Pac-10
Southern Division) in the second
round of the USTA/ITA Women's
National Indoor Collegiate Team
Championship in Madison, Wis.
The Cardinal put forth a
valiant effort against a Bruin
team loaded with talent. All of
UCLA's top five singles players
rank nationally among the top
sixty players in the country, head
lined by Jane Chi and Keri Phe
bus, who compete at No. 5 and
No. 8, respectively.
Both Chi and Phebus backed
up their high rankings against the
Cardinal, taking the top two sin
gles matches. Chi downed sopho
more Katie Schlukebir, who is no
stranger to national prominence
joining the top Bruins in the
country's top 10.
Schlukebir and Chi traded
blows until they knotted the first
set score at 5-5. Chi then took
over the set, and consequently the
match, winning 7-5 in that set
and 6-0 in the second.
"She's a great player,"
Schlukebir said. "I played pretty
well until 5-5. After that, it was a
different match. I got really frus
trated and tried to do too much."

Phebus, who compiled a 2-1
record on Schlukebir throughout
the preseason, defeated Stanford
freshmen Ania Bleszynski in the
No. 2 singles match 6-2, 6-1.
Senior Kim Shasby disposed of
UCLA's Paige Yaroshuk, ranked
No. 34, in straight sets 6-4, 6-2.
Sandra De Silva lost her first
match of the year in the No. 4
match, falling 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 to the
38th-ranked Stephanie Chi.
Freshman Julie Scott bounced
back from her first defeat of the
year in Arizona State, providing
valuable depth for the Cardinal at
the No. 5 spot. She captured a 6-2,
6-4 triumph over 60th-ranked

Susie Starrett. Senior Amy
Chiminello tied up the match
with Stanford's third singles vic
tory, winning 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.
The match and the ticket to
advance resided in the doubles
competition. The Cardinal looked
solid in the No. 1 match as
Schlukebir and Bleszynski upset
the eighth-ranked duo of Phebus
and Starrett 6-4, 7-5. The sixth
ranked sister tandem of
Stephanie and Jane Chi proved to
be too much in the No. 2 match,
defeating Chiminello and Scott 6-
4, 6-2.

Sophomore Sandra De Silva chases down a ball against WSU earli
er this year. Unfortunately for Stanford, the Bruins proved far more
elusive than the ball.
The Bruins rounded out the
match with their fifth victory in
the No. 3 doubles match as
Yaroshuk avenged her singles
defeat as she and Kelly Randolph
cruised 6-2, 6-4 over Shasby and
sophomore Emily Burt (3-2).
The weekend was by no means
a disappointment, however, as
the Cardinal opened the tourna
ment's events with a 6-0 shutout
victory over its first round oppo
nent, the 34th-ranked Wisconsin
Badgers. The hosts came out fired
up with dreams of upset, but
Stanford did the job, advancing
without having to compete in
doubles.
Twelfth-ranked Lauren
Gavaris extended Schlukebir to
three sets, but the Cardinal Ail-
American shook off a first set
defeat to take the match 5-7, 6-4,
6-4. Bleszynski also needed three

sets, but converted a 6-2, 4-6, 6-3
victory over Badger Colleen
Lucey.
Shasby continued the singles
sweep by firing up after a 5-7 dis
appointment in her first set
against Jamie Fouret. She domi
nated Fouret from then on, tak
ing the second and third sets 6-1.
Continuing familiar trends in
recent Cardinal dual matches,
Stanford depth exploited holes in
the Badger lineup as De Silva,
Scott, and Chiminello all breezed
in straight sets. De Silva downed
Tracy Zobrist 6-3, 6-4 while Scott
dominated Shannon Tulley for a
6-2, 6-0 whitewashing. Chiminel
lo also found little trouble with
Tina Grubisic, taking her 6-1, 6-
2.
The Cardinal obtained its
ninth victory of the season, dis
posing of the 15th-ranked Univer
sity of Notre Dame 6-1 in a conso
lation match featuring losers of
the quarterfinal matches.
Schlukebir (7-2) met yet
another difficult match against

the Fighting Irish, squaring off
against another top ranked oppo
nent, No. 26 Wendy Crabtree.
Schlukebir fell for the second
time this season in less than 72
hours, 4-6, 7-5, 7-5.
"I'm sometimes putting too
much pressure on myself," said
Schlukebir. "I would've loved to
win all my matches this weekend,
but that's hard playing at No. 1."
Bleszynski (6-1) bounced back
from her tough UCLA loss
against Notre Dame, in a match
she played more like a seasoned
veteran than an inexperienced
freshmen. Bleszysnki found her
self down set point at 2-5 in the
third set after she and Holyn Lord
exchanged 6-1 victories in the
first two sets. The freshman
refused to yield, fighting back
relentlessly to comeback and win
the match. She went the distance,
taking Lord into a tie-breaker and
winning there 7-6 (7-4).
Shasby (7-1) went undefeated
for the weekend as she blew by
Laura Schwab for a 6-1, 6-1

blowout. De Silva (7-1) did not
allow Molly Gavin to take any
momentum from a 4-6 second set
triumph as she took the match 6-
2, 4-6, 6-2.
Scott (9-1) continued to roll
over her opponents at the No. 5
spot, defeating Erin Gowin 6-2, 6-
3. Chiminello (10-0) maintained
Stanford's only undefeated sin
gles record, tooling Kelley Olson
6-1, 6-2.
Schlukebir and Bleszynski (6-
2) upset the Notre Dame's No. 1
doubles squad of Crabtree and
Lord 6-4, 6-4 in the only neces
sary doubles match.
The Cardinal finished the tour
nament in a tie for fifth place with
the University of Florida. The
fifth place finish represented
Stanford's worst finish in the
tournament's eight-year history.
However, Stanford was only one
match away from the finals as
UCLA advanced all the way to the
championship round, where the
Bruins fell to the top-seeded
Georgia Bulldogs 5-4.

record on Schlukebir throughout
the preseason, defeated Stanford
freshmen Ania Bleszynski in the

UCLA's Paige Yaroshuk, ranked
No. 34, in straight sets 6-4, 6-2.

match of the year in the No. 4
match, falling 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 to the
38th-ranked Stephanie Chi.
Freshman Julie Scott bounced
back from her first defeat of the
year in Arizona State, providing
valuable depth for the Cardinal at
the No. 5 spot. She captured a 6-2,
6-4 triumph over 60th-ranked

Susie Starrett. Senior Amy
Chiminello tied up the match
with Stanford's third singles vic
tory, winning 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.

Schlukebir and Bleszynski upset
the eighth-ranked duo of Phebus
and Starrett 6-4, 7-5. The sixth
ranked sister tandem of
Stephanie and Jane Chi proved to
be too much in the No. 2 match,
defeating Chiminello and Scott 6-
4, 6-2.

Sophomore Sandra De Silva chases down a ball against WSU earli
er this year. Unfortunately for Stanford, the Bruins proved far more
elusive than the ball.
The Bruins rounded out the
match with their fifth victory in
the No. 3 doubles match as
Yaroshuk avenged her singles
defeat as she and Kelly Randolph
cruised 6-2, 6-4 over Shasby and
sophomore Emily Burt (3-2).
The weekend was by no means
a disappointment, however, as
the Cardinal opened the tourna
ment's events with a 6-0 shutout
victory over its first round oppo
nent, the 34th-ranked Wisconsin
Badgers. The hosts came out fired
up with dreams of upset, but
Stanford did the job, advancing
without having to compete in
doubles.
Twelfth-ranked Lauren
Gavaris extended Schlukebir to
three sets, but the Cardinal Ail-
American shook off a first set
defeat to take the match 5-7, 6-4,
6-4. Bleszynski also needed three

sets, but converted a 6-2, 4-6, 6-3
victory over Badger Colleen
Lucey.
Shasby continued the singles
sweep by firing up after a 5-7 dis
appointment in her first set
against Jamie Fouret. She domi
nated Fouret from then on, tak
ing the second and third sets 6-1.
Continuing familiar trends in
recent Cardinal dual matches,
Stanford depth exploited holes in
the Badger lineup as De Silva,
Scott, and Chiminello all breezed
in straight sets. De Silva downed
Tracy Zobrist 6-3, 6-4 while Scott
dominated Shannon Tulley for a
6-2, 6-0 whitewashing. Chiminel
lo also found little trouble with
Tina Grubisic, taking her 6-1, 6-
2.
The Cardinal obtained its
ninth victory of the season, dis
posing of the 15th-ranked Univer
sity of Notre Dame 6-1 in a conso
lation match featuring losers of
the quarterfinal matches.
Schlukebir (7-2) met yet
another difficult match against

the Fighting Irish, squaring off
against another top ranked oppo
nent, No. 26 Wendy Crabtree.
Schlukebir fell for the second
time this season in less than 72
hours, 4-6, 7-5, 7-5.
"I'm sometimes putting too
much pressure on myself," said
Schlukebir. "I would've loved to
win all my matches this weekend,
but that's hard playing at No. 1."
Bleszynski (6-1) bounced back
from her tough UCLA loss
against Notre Dame, in a match
she played more like a seasoned
veteran than an inexperienced
freshmen. Bleszysnki found her
self down set point at 2-5 in the
third set after she and Holyn Lord
exchanged 6-1 victories in the
first two sets. The freshman
refused to yield, fighting back
relentlessly to comeback and win
the match. She went the distance,
taking Lord into a tie-breaker and
winning there 7-6 (7-4).
Shasby (7-1) went undefeated
for the weekend as she blew by
Laura Schwab for a 6-1, 6-1

blowout. De Silva (7-1) did not
allow Molly Gavin to take any
momentum from a 4-6 second set
triumph as she took the match 6-
2, 4-6, 6-2.
Scott (9-1) continued to roll
over her opponents at the No. 5
spot, defeating Erin Gowin 6-2, 6-
3. Chiminello (10-0) maintained
Stanford's only undefeated sin
gles record, tooling Kelley Olson
6-1, 6-2.
Schlukebir and Bleszynski (6-
2) upset the Notre Dame's No. 1
doubles squad of Crabtree and
Lord 6-4, 6-4 in the only neces
sary doubles match.
The Cardinal finished the tour
nament in a tie for fifth place with
the University of Florida. The
fifth place finish represented
Stanford's worst finish in the
tournament's eight-year history.
However, Stanford was only one
match away from the finals as
UCLA advanced all the way to the
championship round, where the
Bruins fell to the top-seeded
Georgia Bulldogs 5-4.
The Stanford women's tennis
team (9-1 overall, 2-0 in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference's Southern Divi
sion) flew cross country last week
end, only to experience turbu
lence through familiar skies. The
Cardinal crashed and burned 5-4
against the eighth-ranked UCLA
Bruins (9-2, 1-1 in the Pac-10
Southern Division) in the second
round of the USTA/ITA Women's
National Indoor Collegiate Team
Championship in Madison, Wis.
The Cardinal put forth a
valiant effort against a Bruin
team loaded with talent. All of
UCLA's top five singles players
rank nationally among the top
sixty players in the country, head
lined by Jane Chi and Keri Phe
bus, who compete at No. 5 and
No. 8, respectively.
Both Chi and Phebus backed
up their high rankings against the
Cardinal, taking the top two sin
gles matches. Chi downed sopho
more Katie Schlukebir, who is no
stranger to national prominence
joining the top Bruins in the
country's top 10.
Schlukebir and Chi traded
blows until they knotted the first
set score at 5-5. Chi then took
over the set, and consequently the
match, winning 7-5 in that set
and 6-0 in the second.
"She's a great player,"
Schlukebir said. "I played pretty
well until 5-5. After that, it was a
different match. I got really frus
trated and tried to do too much."

Phebus, who compiled a 2-1
record on Schlukebir throughout
the preseason, defeated Stanford
freshmen Ania Bleszynski in the
No. 2 singles match 6-2, 6-1.
Senior Kim Shasby disposed of
UCLA's Paige Yaroshuk, ranked
No. 34, in straight sets 6-4, 6-2.
Sandra De Silva lost her first

38th-ranked Stephanie Chi.
