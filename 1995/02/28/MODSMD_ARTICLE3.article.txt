# Power Mac theft raises security issues in Wilbur

A Macintosh was stolen from Trancos last Fri
day, leaving students with one less computer to
work on and questions about security in Wilbur.
On Saturday morning an Apple Power Macin
tosh 7100 was stolen, said junior Phil Lin, resident
assistant at Trancos. The computer was "forcibly
ripped out of the restraints," Lin said, but the
thieves left the attached monitor, keyboard and
power cord behind.
The computer was just installed in Trancos'
computer cluster at the end of fall quarter, Lin said.
Patrick Weston, residential computer consul
tant at Trancos, said he found the computer gone
around 10:30 a.m. "I searched the house, and then
I called the police and Residential Computing and
they took it from there," he said.
"The thieves pried the adhesive plates off the
computer and then removed the computer," Lin
said. "The thief seemed to know what he or she was
doing, since they did not bother with anything else."
Dane Spearing, assistant director of Residential
Computing, said he was surprised the thieves were
able to remove the security equipment.
Because of a computer program which tells net
work managers when computers crash and applica
tions are disconnected, authorities can pin down
that the theft occurred between 5:16 and 5:21 a.m.,
Spearing said. "It's an added benefit of this soft
ware that we never thought about," he said.
There were no signs of a forced entry into Tran
cos, Lin said. "We're not sure how they got in . ..
the keys were just changed at Wilbur," Lin said.
"Around Wilbur there are a lot of security prob
lems."
A broken back door might have been one way the
thief was able to gain easy access to the dormitory,
he said.
Lin said the back-door problem was reported to
Housing Facilities and Services. "When the rain
soaks in, it makes the door fatter so that it doesn't
fit. [Facilities] fixed it once by sanding it down, and
said they would replace it eventually, but they never
did," he said.

'I felt that when the
students visited it
gave them a human
aspect to college as
something they
could do.'

"If it had been replaced a week
earlier, this might have been pre
vented," Lin added. "There are def
initely several doors around Wilbur
that have to be replaced."
"We knew there was a problem,

and we sent people out there to
have the door refitted," said Clark
Vitt, facilities supervisor at Wilbur
and Cowell Cluster. "A door was
put on order, but because that
door is not a regular door and has
a glass fitting, it has to be specially
made."
"It is just unfortunate that [the
thieves'] timing was better than
ours," Vitt said.
