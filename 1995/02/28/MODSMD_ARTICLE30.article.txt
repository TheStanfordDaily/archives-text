# Win over No. 2 Georgia captures Indoor title
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
When the top-ranked Stanford
men's tennis team began competi
tion last Thursday at the
USTA/ITA National Team Indoor
Championship in Louisville, Ky.,
it was riding a sea of momentum
created by two weeks of dominant
play in dual matches. The team's
performance had been so remark
able that head coach Dick Gould
said it had "come through a tough
stretch as good as any team I've

ever had."
After the Cardinal won the
tournament on Sunday, Stan
ford's coach of 12 NCAA champi
ons saw fit to revise his remarks.
"It was some of the most dom
inating three weeks of tennis
we've played at Stanford since
I've been here," Gould said.
In coasting to its ninth ever
championship at the event, the
Cardinal also became the first
team to win back-to-back titles
since
Southern Cal in 1987 and 1988.

Stanford emerged with this
year's title from a field consisting
of the top teams from all of the
country's eight regions, as well as
the top eight teams not atop their
regions. In matches that Stanford
could quite conceivably relive at
the NCAA championships in May,
the Cardinal relied on a 19-2 sin
gles record to defeat, in order, No.
15 Notre Dame, No. 8 Mississippi,
No. 4 UCLA and No. 2 Georgia.
Even if the title match against
the Bulldogs did not supply the
Cardinal's hardest fought victory
of the week, it did supply a 5-0
championship-winning result.
After managing to win its previ
ous two matches despite losing
both doubles points, Stanford
knew that it could not afford to
come out flat in Sunday's doubles
matches against a strong Georgia
team that received just one vote
less than the Cardinal in the lat
est ITA Rolex Collegiate Tennis
Rankings.
The task of winning four sin
gles matches against the Bulldogs
would have been a daunting one,
and that is what made the No. 1
doubles victory of the 18th
ranked tandem of freshmen Scott
Humphries and Paul Goldstein so
important. Theirs was the first
match off the court, and they
went out with a flourish.
Leading 7-5 as the No. 8 duo of
Steven Baldas and Jamie
Laschinger served at 30-30, Gold
stein launched a sky-high lob
toward Laschinger's racquet. As
the Bulldog set up for a powerful
overhead, Humphries and Gold
