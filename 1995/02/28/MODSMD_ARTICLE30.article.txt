# Win over No. 2 Georgia captures Indoor title
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
When the top-ranked Stanford
men's tennis team began competi
tion last Thursday at the
USTA/ITA National Team Indoor
Championship in Louisville, Ky.,
it was riding a sea of momentum
created by two weeks of dominant
play in dual matches. The team's
performance had been so remark
able that head coach Dick Gould
said it had "come through a tough
stretch as good as any team I've

ever had."
After the Cardinal won the
tournament on Sunday, Stan
ford's coach of 12 NCAA champi
ons saw fit to revise his remarks.
"It was some of the most dom
inating three weeks of tennis
we've played at Stanford since
I've been here," Gould said.
In coasting to its ninth ever
championship at the event, the
Cardinal also became the first
team to win back-to-back titles
since
Southern Cal in 1987 and 1988.

Stanford emerged with this
year's title from a field consisting
of the top teams from all of the
country's eight regions, as well as
the top eight teams not atop their
regions. In matches that Stanford
could quite conceivably relive at
the NCAA championships in May,
the Cardinal relied on a 19-2 sin
gles record to defeat, in order, No.
15 Notre Dame, No. 8 Mississippi,
No. 4 UCLA and No. 2 Georgia.
Even if the title match against
the Bulldogs did not supply the
Cardinal's hardest fought victory
of the week, it did supply a 5-0
championship-winning result.
After managing to win its previ
ous two matches despite losing
both doubles points, Stanford
knew that it could not afford to
come out flat in Sunday's doubles
matches against a strong Georgia
team that received just one vote
less than the Cardinal in the lat
est ITA Rolex Collegiate Tennis
Rankings.
The task of winning four sin
gles matches against the Bulldogs
would have been a daunting one,
and that is what made the No. 1
doubles victory of the 18th
ranked tandem of freshmen Scott
Humphries and Paul Goldstein so
important. Theirs was the first
match off the court, and they
went out with a flourish.
Leading 7-5 as the No. 8 duo of
Steven Baldas and Jamie
Laschinger served at 30-30, Gold
stein launched a sky-high lob
toward Laschinger's racquet. As
the Bulldog set up for a powerful
overhead, Humphries and Gold

stein scurried back to the fence in
anticipation of the ball-destruc
tion that awaited. Laschinger's
overhead was fast, but it came
upon the forehand of Humphries,
who launched a passing shot to the
disbelief of the bewildered Bull
dogs.
On the next point — a match
point — Humphries caught up
with a drop volley angled so
sharply that by the time he got to
the ball, it was on the back side of
the umpire's chair.
"I threw my racquet at the ball,
and shoved it over, crosscourt,"
Humphries said.
The result was the first doubles
victory of the day for Stanford,
and, more important, a momen
tum-builder for the other
Cardinal doubles teams still bat
tling it out.
"Everyone was riding Scott's
coattails after our match," Gold
stein said.
Stanford's No. 2 duo of 24th
ranked Ricky Becker and Jim
Thomas used the momentum to
defeat the 28th-ranked tandem of
John Roddick and Kevin Sessions,
8-6. The victory was notable for
Thomas and Becker because they
had been struggling in the tour
ney, trailing when play was sus
pended in their first two doubles
matches of the tournament, and
losing their previous doubles
match to UCLA's Justin Gimel
stob and Loren Peters, 8-5.
30th-ranked Jeff Salzenstein
and Grant Elliot also scored an 8-6
victory over the Bulldogs, coming
against Mike Sell and Nirav Patel
(younger brother of former Stan
ford All-American Vimal Patel).
In singles action, the Cardinal
was omnipotent, winning every
match and thus clinching a victory
that forced a suspension of the two
remaining matches.
The 6th-ranked Salzenstein led

the charge, defeating Laschinger
6-4, 6-2 in No. 1 singles. Stan
ford's team captain showed no
signs of a painful hip flexor that
had plagued him in earlier match
es.
"The pain went away once I got
out on the court," Salzenstein
said.
Goldstein continued to domi
nate in the No. 3 singles position,
defeating his good friend and
teammate from the under-18 U.S.
national team, Eddie Jacques, 6-4,
6-2. All of Goldstein's matches at
the tournament were decided in
two sets, with the exception of the
first, which was suspended with
the set score tied at one apiece.
"When Paul got going in the
last three matches, he was just
dynamite," Gould said.
With Thomas and Becker still
playing, Goldstein and Salzenstein
walked to the back three courts,
where they found Grant Elliot
packing up his equipment after a
7-6 (7-5), 6-4 victory over Roddick.
This meant that Stanford had
clinched the championship, and as
Humphries played out his three
set match on Court 2, Becker and
Thomas interrupted their match
es to rejoice in the thrill of victory
with their teammates.
But this victory celebration was
unlike most gentlemanly displays
of tennis euphoria. It was rather
like a New York Knicks semifinal
victory over the Chicago Bulls,
replete with chest-bumping that
would make Anthony Mason and
Charles Oakley proud.
The 33rd-ranked Humphries
finished up his No. 2 singles match
by coming back from one set down
for the second day in a row to beat
Sell, 1-6,6-3, 7-5. The Bulldog was
ranked in the top 10 nationally
last year, and had taken the fall off
to play tennis on the pro circuit.
"Sell was a baseliner, so the
faster, indoor surface wasn't really
suited to his game, and that helped
me," Humphries said.
Stanford's road to the champi
onship round was not without its

potholes. After easily defeating the
Fighting Irish, 6-0, in the first
round, the Cardinal came up
against a talented, mostly foreign
team from Mississippi.
The Rebels had supplied Stan
ford with some motivation two
days earlier in a hotel elevator,
when Goldstein and Becker rode
with several non-American mem
bers of the Mississippi squad.
"Some guy in the elevator said,
'USA sucks,' to me and Gold
stein," Becker said.
The Rebels came out against
Stanford ostensibly prepared to
prove their word. They beraune the
first team this year to snatch the
doubles point from the Cardinal.
"Losing the doubles point put
an awful lot of pressure on us to
win in singles," Gould said.
The Cardinal was up to the
challenge. Humphries defeated
13th-ranked Johan Hede, 6-4,6-1;
Goldstein beat 36th-ranked Ali
Hamadeh, 6-2,6-3; Elliot returned
serves by standing four feet inside
the service line, and defeated the
6-foot, 8-inch Remi Feneon 6-3, 7-
6 (7-5); and Becker clinched the
match with a 6-1, 4-6, 6-4 victory
over Van VanLingen, despite the
fact that Rebels were trying to dis
tract Becker by yelling for another
match during his ball toss.
Thomas then finished off 53rd
ranked Johan Landsberg, 3-6, 7-6
(7-4), 6-4. Stanford's only singles
loss of the day came at the hands
of Indian Davis Cupper Mahesh
Bhupathi, who defeated Salzen
stein, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3, after Salzen
stein was broken while serving for
the match at 5-4 in the second set.
"[Mississippi] was easily our
toughest match to date," Gould
said.
UCLA was also a tough oppo
nent, again taking the doubles
point and one singles match. But
three-set victories for the Cardinal
in Nos. 2, 5, and 6 singles, as well
as two set victories in Nos. 1 and 3
advanced the Cardinal to its final
round showdown with the Bull
dogs.
