# Baseball discovers Pacific
## Middlebrook hopes to get his game back on track against Tigers 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
After grappling with the Bruins over the
weekend, the 12th-ranked Stanford baseball
team will try to escape the jungle unscathed
when they take on the Tigers of the Universi
ty of the Pacific today.
The Cardinal (11-7), which took two of
three games from UCLA to open Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division (Six-Pac) play,
will conclude the last leg of a five-game stint
away from Sunken Diamond when they
attempt to tame the Tigers (11-6) in a non
conference match up this afternoon at 2 p.m.
in Stockton, Calif. The Cardinal will have to
upend the Tigers in their own den, the 3,500

capacity Billy Hebert field, which is typically
one of the toughest places to play on the road.
All-American right-handed pitcher Jason
Middlebrook (0-3) will probably get a rare
weekday start for Stanford. The hard-throw
ing sophomore — normally the number two
man in the pitching rotation — comes off the
worst outing in his collegiate career, going just
two-thirds of an inning in the Cardinal's 8-6
loss at UCLA on Saturday. Middlebrook
allowed four runs, all earned, while walking
two Bruins and allowing five hits as he was
unable to escape the first inning.
"I think that we need to get Middlebrook
out on the mound and just let him throw,"
said his battery mate, All-American catcher
A.J. Hinch. "He is a real talented pitcher and

we need to let him get in a groove and let him
go out and dominate. This is a good chance for
him to get better and regain his pitching."
While it is likely that Middlebrook will have
a shot at redemption in the starting role, head
coach Mark Marquess also plans to use anoth
er committee of pitchers, similar to the ones
that shut down UC-Davis and USF. Junior
Todd Bartels, sophomore Mark Williams and
sophomore Brendan Sullivan are all likely to
see action on the hill for the Cardinal.
Though today's game comes on the heels of
an emotional weekend in Los Angeles, most
Stanford players don't sense any sort of let
down.
"We come out every day and
play hard regardless of the oppo
nent," Hinch said. "The coaches
really stress that every game is
important. These midweek games
help us stay focused and get
momentum for the weekend
series."

Like Stanford, Pacific also
comes off a weekend series win,
downing the Portland State
Vikings in two of three games.
The Tigers hope to challenge in
the talented Big West Conference
in 1995.
Despite compiling an impres
sive 36-18 overall record last sea
son, Pacific finished fourth in the
conference race behind perennial
powers Cal State-Fullerton and
Long Beach State. But the Tigers

certainly held their own against
non-conference teams a year ago,
posting a 28-6 non-Big West
record.
The Cardinal captured the
lone meeting between the two
schools last season, with left
handed junior Mike Robbins pick
ing up the victory in a 14-4 affair
at Sunken Diamond. Stanford
has dominated the all-time series,
posting 24 wins in 27 contests
since 1977.
