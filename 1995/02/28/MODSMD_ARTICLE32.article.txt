# Lacrosse beats Slugs, Aggies

### Seth Goldstein Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's lacrosse team definitely
made a mark on Maloney field this Sunday. In its
first home appearance as a varsity squad, the Car
dinal crushed UC-Davis 11-3. If the ground could
speak, it would have to say it was impressed with
its new owners.
"It was our first official home game as a varsity
team," said junior defensive player Hannah
Flatau. "We wanted to set the tone for the rest of
the season. I think that we showed that we can do
anything we set our minds to."
The victory over the Aggies marks the second
time that Stanford has beaten Davis the season,
the previous victory coming at last weekend's
Santa Barbara Shootout. After a few years of being
completely dominated by the Aggies, the Cardinal
was happy to throw the proverbial monkey off its
back.
"We see them [Davis] all the time so it's exciting
to be turning that rivalry around," said head coach
Kay Cowperthwait. "The players are ecstatic that
the tide is turning. You could say that we've final
ly cracked the code on Davis."
The win was made even more sweet by some e
mail forwarded to the squad by a Cardinal player's
friend who attends Davis.
"It basically said that they [the Aggies] had all
been suffering from hangovers and that this was
the only reason we beat them in Santa Barbara,"
Flatau said. "So we had something to prove on
Sunday."
Stanford proved its point quickly, jumping out
to a 4-0 lead by halftime of the "higniy anticipated"
match and never looking back. Freshman forward
Dara Kaplan led the Cardinal scoring attack with
four goals while senior Eileen Gorman added two
of her own. The rest of the team's goals came from
an offensive attack that Cowperthwait called
"extremely balanced," with no player having more
than one score.
The emotional win over the Aggies came two
days after a 15-0 lambasting of UC-Santa Cruz on
the road. The Banana Slugs were simply no match
for Stanford.
"Their skills just aren't very high," Flatau said.
"They have a lot of new players and are just started

to get on their feet. We knew we
were going to win and win big.
But we still wanted to accomplish
things with our own game."
Despite the huge margin of vic
tory, Cowperthwait wasn't
entirely pleased with the perfor
mance.
"When we're playing a team
that's a level below us, it's hard to
maintain a high level of intensi
ty," she said. "There's a lot of
teams out here on the West Coast
that don't have the same advan
tages we do and it's a challenge to
stay consistent."
"We were coming off a big

tournament the weekend before
and had a big game against Davis
coming up, so I think we let
things go mentally a little on Fri
day. And while we played well, it
was hard to go from an easy oppo
nent to a more difficult one,"
Cowperthwait said.
Despite this small disappoint
ment, the coach is still extremely
proud of her squad and their
development thus far this season.
"I think we're moving along
really nicely," she said. "We're
right on track. I'm extremely
pleased with their physical con
dition and we're right where we
should be in terms of skill
level."
The team continues its trek
with a home game Saturday
against California.
