# Tourney time: Let the madness begin
## 
### 
The last day of February
is here. For college bas
ketball fans everywhere,
this is the final day of sanity
for five weeks. March Mad
ness beckons, and it doesn't
end until a few days into April.

Couch potatoes love March
Madness because college bas
ketball is more entertaining
than Picket Fences. CBS
Sports loves March Madness
because, for one month,
everybody forgets they lost
football to Fox. People with
sensitive ears love March
Madness because Dick Vitale
doesn't work for CBS.
March Madness is a power
ful force. It makes people
watch games between
Winthrop and North Caroli
na-Asheville. It makes fans
watch matchups with 47-
point spreads pitting Kansas
and McNeese State.

While the NCAA tourna
ment doesn't come around
until the middle of the month
(March 16 if you're keeping
score), March Madness starts
much sooner. All the other
tournaments are right around
the corner. The conference
tourneys decide who gets the
automatic bids and who stays
home for the Big Dance â€”
and in some cases render the
regular season results use
less.
With 64 teams invited to
the show, all the squads that
have any chance at the title
get in. The only question to
be answered is which less
deserving squads will fill out
the field. This is where March
Madness comes in.
Just about every league
gets an automatic bid. And
just about every league has a
tournament. This means that
even teams that lay an egg in
the regular season have one
last shot to sneak in. Is it fair
that a team that goes 4-23 in
the regular campaign can
have one miracle weekend and
get in over the regular season
champion who goes 22-5 but
has one bad game in the tour
nament?
Probably not, but it's excit
