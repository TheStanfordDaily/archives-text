# Tourney time: Let the madness begin
## 
### 
The last day of February
is here. For college bas
ketball fans everywhere,
this is the final day of sanity
for five weeks. March Mad
ness beckons, and it doesn't
end until a few days into April.

Couch potatoes love March
Madness because college bas
ketball is more entertaining
than Picket Fences. CBS
Sports loves March Madness
because, for one month,
everybody forgets they lost
football to Fox. People with
sensitive ears love March
Madness because Dick Vitale
doesn't work for CBS.
March Madness is a power
ful force. It makes people
watch games between
Winthrop and North Caroli
na-Asheville. It makes fans
watch matchups with 47-
point spreads pitting Kansas
and McNeese State.

While the NCAA tourna
ment doesn't come around
until the middle of the month
(March 16 if you're keeping
score), March Madness starts
much sooner. All the other
tournaments are right around
the corner. The conference
tourneys decide who gets the
automatic bids and who stays
home for the Big Dance —
and in some cases render the
regular season results use
less.
With 64 teams invited to
the show, all the squads that
have any chance at the title
get in. The only question to
be answered is which less
deserving squads will fill out
the field. This is where March
Madness comes in.
Just about every league
gets an automatic bid. And
just about every league has a
tournament. This means that
even teams that lay an egg in
the regular season have one
last shot to sneak in. Is it fair
that a team that goes 4-23 in
the regular campaign can
have one miracle weekend and
get in over the regular season
champion who goes 22-5 but
has one bad game in the tour
nament?
Probably not, but it's excit

ing. Small-conference regular
season champions hate it,
because they have to win their
tournament to get invited to the
NCAAs. But, small leagues have a
tournament because they want to
get on ESPN. And all those scrub
schools want a shot to knock off
the giant and get on ESPN. Even
the regular-season champ real
izes that without a tournament,
ESPN couldn't give a rat's behind
about the Big South or the South
land. March Madness blinds us to
the fact that these schools will get
a 16-seed and get fed to the
hounds or Bruins or Huskies in
the first round of the NCAAs.
The fact is, if you have a stellar
regular season, you'll get in
regardless of your conference.
Last year, College of Charleston

was new to the mighty Trans-
America Athletic Conference and
ineligible for the tournament.
The Charleston crew, with its
three losses, actually received an
at-large bid, joining Central Flori
da from the TAAC in the NCAAs.
Call me TAACky or call it Mad
ness, but I'd rather see two teams
I've never heard of from the
TAAC than somebody from the
Big Ten who goes 7-11.
The true Madness comes when
the NCAA tournament seeds are
announced before the end of the
conference tourneys. In the past
couple seasons, the Southwestern
Athletic Conference Champi
onship has been on a late Sunday
afternoon, hours after CBS and
ESPN stage their grand NCAA
tournament selection shows. No
matter who wins, they get a 15-
seed, even though Jackson State
may be 23-3 and Prairie View
A&M may be 2-26. Nobody seems
to care how stupid this is because

come the first round of the
NCAAs, the big boys will eat them
alive. Or will they?
This year, the Pacific 10 Con
ference gets a chance to get more
than four teams into March Mad
ness. While the Pac-10 decided to
do away with the tournament con
cept a few years ago — eliminat
ing USC and Cal's shots at this
year's Dance — five teams (sorry,
Wazzu) put forth deserving
resumes. Stanford will probably
be favored to win its first NCAA
tournament game since 1942.
I've got my popcorn ready. I'll
cut the brackets out of the paper
and fill them in as the tournament
progresses. I'll have the tube on
while I prepare for my History
1658 final. Because March Mad
ness comes only once a year.
I'll be watching. And so will
Cal.

Jeremy would like Ixintana to get
cable very, very soon.
