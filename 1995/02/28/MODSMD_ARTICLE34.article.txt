# Softball wishing for déjà vu vs. Gators

### Jason Weintraub Contributing writer 
The Stanford Softball team
takes on San Francisco State today
at 1:30 p.m. in San Francisco, hop
ing to duplicate a doubleheader
sweep in which the team won two
games over the Gators by a com
bined score of 23-1.
The team's sweep of the Gators
represents one of the highlights of
an up-and-down season for the
Cardinal. Stanford (5-7), in only its
second varsity season, has already
matched its win total from all of
last year.
The 1995 season has seen the
Cardinal hit well at times, pitch
well at times and play defense well
at times. However, rarely has the
squad put it all together in one out
ing. Consequently, the team's
record fails to reflect the talent
level of the youthful squad.
"We've shown that we can
[play] well," assistant coach Andy

'We just need to play
consistently in all
phases of the game
— Andy Pearce

Pearce said. "We just need to play
consistently in all phases of the
game if we want better results."
The lack of consistency is a
direct consequence of the team's
youth, as only four of the 16 play
ers on the roster are upperclass
men. Six of the nine starters are
freshmen or sophomores.
The Gators, on the other hand,
are a team attempting to play
through a season mured by adver
sity.
"The last time we played them,"
Pearce said, "their best pitcher had
just quit the team. I'm sure that
this time they'll have made the
necessary adjustments and will
come out and play much better."
Pearce added that San Francis
co State "is a very well-coached
team" that should be well pre
pared to give Stanford a tougher
battle in their second meeting of
the season.
M I expect them to be better than
they were last time," freshman
pitcher Jessica Schulman said.
"But we've gotten a lot better too
[since the last meeting between
the two teams], so I expect that the
result will be the same."
Schulman, 3-3 with three com
plete-game shutouts on the year,
will pitch the first game for Stan
ford, while sophomore Angela
Webb (2-4) will pitch game two.
"We're playing really well,"
Schulman said. "Against Davis
(last week, when we took the first
game 1-0 and lost the second 2-1),
even though we split, we played
well against a top team in [Divi
sion ll]. If we keep playing like
this, we'll do well as we head into
[Pacific-10] play."
