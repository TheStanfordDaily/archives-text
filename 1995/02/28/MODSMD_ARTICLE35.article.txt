Stanford 7 5
California 4 7

The Stanford hockey team netted a
split this weekend as the Cardinal beat
California 7-4 Friday at home and then
lost 7-5 Saturday at Cal to conclude the
regular season. The team will begin
play in the national tournament tomor
row in Fort Collins, Colo.
Friday's win in the last home game
of the year assured that Stanford (10-7-
2) would retain the Skate, hockey's ver
sion of the Axe, for winning the season
series against Cal. After the weekend
split, Stanford finished with a 2-1-2
record against Cal for the year.
The first game was a very methodical
victory as Stanford put its best foot for
ward in a practice for nationals. After
missing many of their top players for
their road trip at Arizona State, the
entire squad was back together for the
Cal games. "We completed the work we

needed to complete in that game," said
Coach Ernie Ferrari. "I was satisfied
with where we were."
As in many of the games this season,
seniors Stefan Teitge and Luke Winter
dominated the scoring in both games.
While the first and second lines domi
nated the play in the first game, the
third line came in and played well as a
checking line. Cal's first line was unable
to score against Stanford's tough third
line.
In the second game, the team con
centrated on developing the third,
fourth and fifth line players, and the
first and second lines were rested more.
Teitge and Winter played only 70 per
cent as much as usual, according to Fer
rari.
"We definitely weren't happy about
losing, but the game was not as signifi
cant [as Friday's game]," Ferrari said.
The Cardinal, seeded seventh at
nationals, will travel to Colorado
tonight and begin play against second
ranked Illinois tomorrow afternoon at
Colorado State University. Tomorrow's
game is just the beginning of a grueling
stretch in which the team may play up
to five games in five days.
The tournament brings together the

champions of the five leagues across the
nation in addition to three indepen
dents. The team will start by playing a
three game round robin against the
other three teams in their division. On
Friday, the eight-team field will be nar
rowed to the four teams with the best
records in the preliminary round.
After Illinois, Stanford will play
third-ranked Indiana Thursday morn
ing, and will conclude the preliminary
round against Northern State, a school
in North Dakota, on Friday morning.
"We are all ready to go and we are
looking forward to it," Ferrari said.
"The competition out there will be as
good or better than the competition
here, but we are playing well and will
hold up. I think we have a good chance
to win nationals."
The team is entering the tourna
ment completely healthy, and all the
players will make the trip. If Stanford
should make it to the semifinals, they
will be without freshman goalie Sami Jo
Small, who will fly back on Saturday for
a track meet. She will be replaced by
grad student Bill Sutherland, who split
the net duties with Small during the
