# Student volunteer project targets India
## 
### Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing Writer 
Six Stanford students will help bring better
health care to rural and alum areas around Ban
galore, India, for six weeks this summer
through Project DOSTI, which translates to
Project Friendship.
Sameer Bhatia, a Stanford sophomore,
helped start the group in 1992 as a high-school
senior in Seattle. The group, comprised of both
Stanford students and high-school students
from Seattle, is currently training and raising
funds for its third trip to India this summer.
The training includes Hindi classes, local
community service and workshops on cross-cul
tural issues, including Indian history, music,
dance, women and religion.
The group also has special project training on
rural health and hygiene, health care systems,
functioning of a health camp, first aid and CPR.
In addition, the group is actively raising
funds for the cost of its trips to India through
letter-writing campaigns, brochures and other
publicity measures.
"The program builds anticipation for the

summer," said freshman Sou my a Sastry. "It's
an active part of your life now — not just for the
summer."
This summer, students will conduct health
surveys, organize six health camps, teach
health care and nutrition, attempt to rehabili
tate and educate street children and provide
therapy for developmentally disabled children
in Bangalore.
The volunteers will work with the South
Asian Council for Community and Children in
Crisis in conjunction with the Bangalore Chil
dren's Hospital and Research Centre.
The goals of the group, according to Bhatia,
are to provide service for people in India, gain a
better understanding of India and strengthen
bonds of shared culture and values.
"I'm really excited about working in the
slums and rural areas.... Working with these
people and immersing ourselves, we should
grow from this experience," Bhatia said.
In 1993, four participants spent a month
working with developmentally disabled children
in the Bangalore Children's Hospital and
Research Centre. The following summer, five
volunteers initiated the hospital's volunteer

program by teaching first aid and CPR to 450
students.
"The best thing was knowing that even
though we've been born and brought up in the
States we could adapt to day-to-day living in
India," said Gita Sinha, a senior who went on
last year's trip. "We could communicate with
Indians from shopkeepers to bus drivers and
that gave us the confidence to deal with the
problems and hardships we encountered."
The group was patterned after Amigos de
las Americas, a program in which students vol
unteer to help in health projects in rural com
munities of Latin America. Bhatia wanted a
similar program in India — a country which
has a population of over 800 million people —
where only one-half of the 100 million who are
disabled receive assistance.
"It gives students an opportunity to give
back to India, a country that's given so much
of our culture, and to learn more about Indian
culture — our heritage and our past," Bhatia
said.
Aside from helping students learn about
India, the program also creates a unified group
of young people, Bhatia added.
