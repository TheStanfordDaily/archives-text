# Resources still a hurdle for ethnic studies plan
## Uncertain financial times forbid firm commitment 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
Advocates of ethnic studies at
Stanford scored a major victory last
week with the announcement of a
new interdisciplinary ethnic studies
program but another imyor battle
lies ahead as the University strug
gles under financial duress to assem
ble the innovative program.
The program's future depends on
the University's ability, during
tough financial times, to commit the

resources and fund-raising efforts needed to nurture
the program through its crucial early years.

In his proposal, Dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences John Shoven promised to authorize
searches for one full-time faculty member in Chicano
Studies and one in Asian-American Studies next
year. However, he has been hesitant to comment on
development of the program beyond next year, given
the unpredictable future of the University budget.
"I am unable to make multi-year, multi-position
promises in this uncertain budgetary climate,"
Shoven stated in his report.
The University is currently in the midst of a three
year initiative designed to trim $18 million from the
annual budget.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said administration dis-


Shoven
crctionary funds will sponsor two
visiting faculty positions next
year, one in Chicano Studies and
one in Asian-American Studies.
She noted, however, that this is a
temporary measure aimed at but
tressing the infant interdisci
plinary program while academic
departments begin faculty search
es for the two permanent posi
tions.
If next year's faculty searches
prove fruitless, Rice said, "we
might be able to go with visitors
another year."
Rice said there are as yet no
plans to commit additional discre
tionary funds to future develop
ment of the program, as Shoven
has said resources within the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences should be sufficient to run
the program.
However, Rice said, additional
administration support might be
discussed in the future if the
school finds the program strains
its resources.
"We'll certainly keep in touch
about it," Rice said.
The new interdisciplinary pro
gram, she said, is a high priority
because its development will
strengthen other areas of the
University.
Others are less confident that
Shoven's current commitment
will be sufficient to launch effec
tive ethnic studies programs.
Among them is Comparative
Literature Asst. Prof. David
Palumbo-Liu, who was hired
along with History Assoc. Prof.
Gordon Chang in 1990, partially
to reinforce the University's
Asian-American Studies offer
ings.
Palumbo-Liu said that he and
Chang teach half-time in ethnic
studies, as will the permanent
faculty member Shoven has
promised.
As such, the three professors
will together only be able to offer
six courses a year.
To establish a strong Asian-
American Studies program,
Palumbo-Liu said, "we would
need at least two more appoint
ments. . . . That would add four
courses, making eight."
Palumbo-Liu said he under
stands that financial uncertain
ties prevent greater commitment

of resources to the program.
But he also warned against let
ting financial constraints justify
mediocrity in the new program.
"If we become too cautious
after we've gone through this
effort to mount a program ... if
the program suffers from the
resulting weakness, then a lot of
effort will be put to no use," he
said.
One way the University could
try to reinforce the program,
Palumbo-Liu said, would be to
encourage current Stanford facul
ty who have research interests in
Asian-American Studies to teach
in the program.
Sophomore Lubia Sanchez, a
member of the Chicano Studies
Committee, said she is pleased
with the proposed interdisci
plinary program and had not
expected a much greater financial
commitment from Shoven.
Sanchez said current Universi
ty resources, along with the addi
tional faculty search promised
next year, will likely be sufficient
to get the Chicano Studies major
off the ground.
"It's enough to get us started,"
Sanchez said.
However, interest and partici
pation in the program may even
tually outgrow the current Uni
versity capacity, she said.
"I think we're definitely, with
time, going to have more needs,"
she said.
Financial considerations will
also be a key obstacle in long-term
plans for a research institute ded
icated to comparative ethnic stud
ies.
The seeds of the research cen
ter are being planted this year in a
faculty seminar in Comparative
Race and Ethnicity sponsored by
the Mellon Foundation, but the
future of the seminar and the
eventual development of the
research center will depend on
future raising of funds, Shoven
said.
Efforts are already underway
to secure funding for the research
institute, Shoven said.
"We've got a couple of strong
(fund-raising) prospects, and
we've got a foundation that we
will be approaching," Shoven
said. "There certainly are promis
ing leads and I'm convinced that
we can be successful in this
regard."
