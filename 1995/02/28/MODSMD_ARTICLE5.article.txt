# Students critique proposal
## Specifics of ethnic studies plan probed 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
At a forum yesterday, students
voiced a number of concerns with
the new proposal for ethnic studies
— including the commitment of
both faculty and the University and
the role of each specialty within the
interdisciplinary program.
Dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences John Shoven and
Assoc. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Ram6n Saldivar, who
chaired the Chicano Studies com
mittee, mediated the forum, the
first for student debate of Shoven's
proposal for a new interdisciplinary
program in Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity.

The proposal was presented to
the Faculty Senate last Thursday.
Within the next two weeks, com
mittees will be formed to develop
curricula for Chicano Studies,
Asian-American Studies and
African and Afro-American Stud
ies.

Students voiced concern that the
meeting, which was first an
nounced last Thursday at the sen
ate meeting, was not well enough
publicized to draw all interested
students. Shoven said he would

hold another forum before the
committees are named, possibly in
the evening so alumni could attend.
"We just wanted to get back to
students right away, to get the dis
cussion started," explained Saldl
var.
Several students expressed con
cerns that the faculty hired for the
program may not be fully commit
ted to it because they will be hired
by individual departments. Several
members of the 30-person crowd
also enunciated worries about the
University's long-term commit
ment to strengthening the pro
gram.
As an interdisciplinary program,
ethnic studies would be taught by
faculty from full-fledged depart
ments whose classes receive credit
for both majors. African and Afro-
American Studies currently func
tions as an interdisciplinary pro
gram.
Shoven said he thought the hir
ing and tenure processes for faculty
who will teach classes within the
new program should be the same as
the processes for any department.
Although the final decision to
grant tenure to a faculty member
would rest with the departments,

the directors of the program would
have input in the decision, probably
in the form of a letter of recommen
dation, Shoven said.
Shoven has proposed an execu
tive board for the program, com
prised of the directors of each of the
three ethnic programs.
But students said a professor
hired for an individual department,
such as history or English, will not
necessarily be committed to the
ethnic studies program, and that
work related to ethnic studies could
be further de-emphasized if the
professor is pursuing tenure.
"I'm concerned about the actual
institutional support for this pro
gram," said another student, who
said he thought newly hired profes
sors would look at the interdisci
plinaiy program and ask "Do 1
want to get tenure or do I want to
help with this program?"
"We can offer them an environ
ment that provides them a good
opportunity" to be granted tenure
while continuing to focus on race
and ethnicity, Shoven said.
He added that he has seen many
departments in the humanities and
social sciences moving toward com
parative studies already, citing that
movement as evidence that the pro
gram would be widely supported.
"We can't have a curriculum if,
in fact, faculty aren't committed to
this line," Shoven said, "but I think

by all accounts they are."
Students also said they were
worried that because of tight bud
gets, Chicano, Asian-American and
African and Afro-American Studies
would have to compete with each
other.
The school is large enough,
Shoven assured students, that "we
can afford to devote some resources
to Asian-American scholarship, to
Chicano scholarship and to
African-American scholarship."
"I don't think the three primaiy
partners in this [program] should
enter saying, 'It's either you or
me,'" he said.
With resources available for the
hire of only two visiting professors
for next year — one in Chicano
Studies and one in Asian-American
Studies — "to a certain extent
we're going to have to count on the
existing faculty," Shoven said.
Even with only one addition to
the current Asian-American Stud
ies faculty count of two professors,
Shoven was confident that the pro
gram would succeed.
One student said she didn't
understand how the program could
be successful if Shoven expected it
to be "cushioned by the current fac
ulty," but Saldfvar pointed out that
the plans for next year are "just a
start."
Another student asked for
assurance that the new program

would grow and improve more
quickly than the Afro-American
Studies program, which he said has
not received enough support from
the University during its 25-year
history.
"I think this program is a signif
icant step forward," Saldivar said.
"I think if you come back in 20
years, you'll be pleased with how
it's developed."
Students also asked how their
representatives to the curriculum
committees would be chosen, sug
gesting that undergraduate stu
dents and graduate students both
be included.
Shoven said he was considering
curriculum committees of six mem
bers which could have one under
graduate and one graduate repre
sentative each.
Students who served on the ini
tial Chicano and Asian-American
Studies may continue their work as
members of the curriculum com
mittees, or new representatives
could be selected from student
groups' nominees, he said, adding
that a similar process will occur for
Afro-American Studies.
The committees will work all
spring quarter, after which the pro
posals will be sent to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies and
the Faculty Senate. Shoven said he
hopes to have the program estab
lished by next winter quarter.
