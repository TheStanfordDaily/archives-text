# E-mail pen-pal program aids Latino youths
## 
### Tristan Sorah Reyes Contributing writer 
Some Chicano / Latino Stanford stu
dents may soon be getting e-mail from new
friends, and help teach English in the
process.
The students are participating in a new
buddy program with 26 students from Mon
roe Middle School in San Jose. The e-mail
pen-pal program is being funded by a grant
from the California state government and is

intended to assist students with limited
English proficiency.
Each Stanford student has a buddy who
they communicate with one-on-one over e
mail in a kind of mentor relationship. The
program is intended to promote the develop
ment of English writing and language skills
and technological literacy, according to
Susie Pierson, an organizer of the program.
But Pierson, who also teaches seventh
grade at Monroe, said the teachers have ad
ditional goals in mind.

"We want to see socialization. We want
the kids to have contact with University stu
dents of their same culture who are very
successful," she said.
The program started earlier this month
with a group trip to Stanford where the kids
met their pen pals and took a tour of cam
pus.
"It was exciting to see the students in
teract with the Stanford students," Pierson
said. "They interacted beautifully. At first
they were a little stiff, but as soon
as they found their buddies and got
into little groups they talked quite
a lot."
The students were given
mementos from their trip to Stan
ford; for example, one girl received a
book on Latino history. Pierson said
some of the students cany their
presents to school everyday, adding
that this demonstrates the trip's
lasting impact on the students.
"I felt that when the students
visited it gave them a human
aspect to college as something they
could do," said sophomore Sal
vador Paniagua, one of the men
tors.
Pierson said she felt that the
exposure to the college experience
was wonderful for her students.
"This has even raised Latino
pride. The students want to have a
Latino Awareness Month that
would feature famous Latinos, dis
play Latino poetry and writing and
expose other aspects of the Latino

culture," she said. "The students
initiated this and are now working
with their school counselor to
make it happen."
Pierson added that the program
has generated excitement in the
students, making them more inter
ested in education.
Despite limited access, Pierson
said the students are adapting
quickly to the computers. Howev
er, there is only one computer in
the eighth grade classroom and
two in the seventh grade class
room, one of which is Pierson's
own. Continual delays with the
system also make Pierson afraid
students might lose interest.
Still, Pierson said the progress
students have made after just one
chance to send e-mail is remark
able given that they have no com
puter access in their homes.
"It's good that we will be com
municating with the students
through e-mail, because e-mail is
immediate and not as tedious as
normal writing. I think that the
students will feel more comfortable
with this than a formal written let
ter," said sophomore Jennifer
Najera, a mentor.
