Stressing the importance of sta
bility and open trading markets,
German Minister of Federal De
fense Volker Riihe spoke at the
Hoover Institution's Stauffer Au
ditorium yesterday.
"We now have a historical op
portunity to shape a world con
ducive to our common interests
and consistent with our common
values," Riihe told a crowd of about
40 invited guests.
"We want a world of open soci
eties and open markets. We need
stability as the very precondition to
unfold the forces of market econo
my," he added.
Riihe, the German minister of
defense since 1992, said Ger
many's foreign policies will be de
signed to accomplish three basic
principles: to maintain and
strengthen cooperative relation
ships with its economic partners, to
adapt and build new institutions

that can foster this economic coop
eration and to support democracy
and human rights.
Since Germany has a vital inter
est in stability and wants an open
trading system, it is making the Pa
cific Basin an area of top priority.
According to Riihe, the Pacific
Basin is a region where "European
and American interests are grow
ing rapidly."
Like Washington, Germany is
"developing broad strategic dia
logues with important partners in
the Pacific Basin," Riihe said. One
of these partners, Riihe said, is
Japan.
"Germany wants to materialize
all possible chances in Asia and in
the Pacific Basin ... and be suffi
ciently prepared for the challenges
facing us from that region of the
world," Riihe said.
"The main emphasis of our
Asia-Pacific policy covers the fields
of trade, technological cooperation,
