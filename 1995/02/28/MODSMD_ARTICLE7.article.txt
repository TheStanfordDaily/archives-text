### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
Stressing the importance of sta
bility and open trading markets,
German Minister of Federal De
fense Volker Riihe spoke at the
Hoover Institution's Stauffer Au
ditorium yesterday.
"We now have a historical op
portunity to shape a world con
ducive to our common interests
and consistent with our common
values," Riihe told a crowd of about
40 invited guests.
"We want a world of open soci
eties and open markets. We need
stability as the very precondition to
unfold the forces of market econo
my," he added.
Riihe, the German minister of
defense since 1992, said Ger
many's foreign policies will be de
signed to accomplish three basic
principles: to maintain and
strengthen cooperative relation
ships with its economic partners, to
adapt and build new institutions

that can foster this economic coop
eration and to support democracy
and human rights.
Since Germany has a vital inter
est in stability and wants an open
trading system, it is making the Pa
cific Basin an area of top priority.
According to Riihe, the Pacific
Basin is a region where "European
and American interests are grow
ing rapidly."
Like Washington, Germany is
"developing broad strategic dia
logues with important partners in
the Pacific Basin," Riihe said. One
of these partners, Riihe said, is
Japan.
"Germany wants to materialize
all possible chances in Asia and in
the Pacific Basin ... and be suffi
ciently prepared for the challenges
facing us from that region of the
world," Riihe said.
"The main emphasis of our
Asia-Pacific policy covers the fields
of trade, technological cooperation,

telecommunication and environ
mental protection as well as coop
eration in the fields of training, sci
ence and culture," he added.
However, Riihe said it was also
important for the region to accept
its responsibilities in securing
peace and economic development.
"For obvious reasons Germany
and the United States welcome
China's participation in regional
security and economic organiza
tions," he added.
So far, China has been able to

raise its gross domestic product by
an average annual rate of 9 per
cent and has accelerated it to 13
percent in the last two years, Riihe
said. China, he said, claims that
stability is the precondition for
this success.
Riihe said it is in China's own
interest to show sufficient respect
for human rights and the rule of
law.
Unlike China, however, "Rus
sia's use of military force has been
excessive," he said. Pointing to
Russian intervention in Chechnya,
Riihe called the recent army crack
down in the area a "terrible human
tragedy."
"A stable, democratic Russia is

vital to build a secure Europe and
to resolve regional conflicts — be it
Asia [or] Europe," he added.
Criticizing Russia's actions,
Riihe said that Germany will be
guided by its responsibility to sup
port the reforms in Russia with
lasting patience.
Riihe also spoke about NATO,
saying that the "foundation for
trans-Atlantic relations has
changed. NATO as the sole institu
tional basis is no longer suffi
cient."
The alliance has to be willing to
expand, he said. "Any case against
admitting the Eastern Europeans
lacks logic and principle," Riihe
said.

However, NATO expansion is
not enough for a secure Europe.
There has to be a strategic part
nership with Russia as well, he
said.
East German troops also play a
key role in this cooperation in Cen
tral Europe, Riihe said. By forming
military partnerships with French,
Polish and Czech units, Germany
can continue to foster understand
ing and unity in the region, he
added.
"Today, the Europeans and the
Americans face a huge task. In a
new area, we must, and we intend
to, evolve Euro-Atlantic relations
into a comprehensive partnership
of equals."
