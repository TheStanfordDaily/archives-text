great research...
Kaplan spends over $3 million annually developing
products and researching the tests. We've proved
that we know the tests inside out.
In 1992, Kaplan predicted the elimination
of an LSAT question type and changed our
course in anticipation of the change.
In 1993. the ETS was forced to
withdraw a GRE question type because
Kaplan "broke the code."
In 1994. Kaplan research brought to light
w security flaws in the computer-based GRE
tests. As a result, the ETS temporarily
pulled the test.
great results.
Kaplan's expertise translates
into higher scores and greater
confidence for our students.
Put our research to work for
you on test day.
