# Stanford speech code struck down by judge
## 
### Molly Stephens Contributing writer 
In a precedent-setting decision yesterday, Santa
Clara County Superior Court Judge Peter Stone struck
down Stanford's speech code, upholding First Amend
ment protection to students at California's private uni
versities.
The decision ordered a preliminary injunction
against the Grey Interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard, Stanford's speech code. The interpretation
prohibits harassment, including "discriminatory in
timidation by threats of violence and also [includingl

personal vilification of students on the basis of their
sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orientation,
or national and ethnic origin."
The injunction was ordered after nine Stanford stu
dents and alumni — led by Law School alumnus Rob
Corry and Law School student Scott Kupor — brought
a suit against the University last May, arguing that the
code violates California's Leonard Law.
The Leonard Law, which was adopted in 1992, ex
tends First Amendment protections to students at pri
vate universities.
The University, however, defended the speech code
by arguing that it does not violate the First Amend ment

rejected, people take notice.'

and that, even if it did, the First Amendment is applica
ble only to state actors and not to private actors.
Stone decided against Stanford on both counts.
He argued that the Grey Interpretation is "over
broad" and violates the right to free speech because it
prohibits speech that would not incite immediate vio-

lence. "Fighting words — which threaten violence —
are one of the few types of speech not protected by the
First Amendment.
"By proscribing certain words, without even consid
ering ... whether under a given situation there will be
a breach of the peace, [the] speech code fails to meet the
'fighting words' standard," Stone wrote in his decision.
Stone also argued that since the Grey Interpretation
prohibits speech based on the content, and not the con
text, of the speech, it violates the First Amendment.
He upheld the plaintiffs' argument that the speech
code "is an impermissible content
based regulation, since it does not
proscribe all fighting words but
only those which are based upon
sex, race, color and the like." The
plaintiffs argued that such "hostili
ty" and "favoritism" is unconstitu
tional.
Stone also upheld the constitu
tionality of the Leonard Law. Cali
fornia is the only state that pos
sesses such a law, and the speech
code case provided the first test of
its constitutionality.
Stone wrote that the injunction
constituted the final disposition at
the trial level, so any appeal by the
University must be made to a high
er court.
An 'important' decision
The student plaintiffs were very
excited with the decision.
"I think the case is extremely
important," Corry said. "People all
around the country look at Stan
ford, and it has one of the most pre
cise [universityl speech codes," he
said. "When a speech code like this
is rejected, people take notice."
"A school of Stanford's caliber
does not need a speech code," Corry
added. "It insults students who
have the ability to decide for them
selves what is appropriate and
inappropriate speech."
Corry said the First Amend
ment is the only speech code that
Stanford needs and that he will
continue to fight for free speech if
the University decides to appeal
the Superior Court decision.
"It is probable that [Stanford]
could write a constitutional speech
code," Kupor said.
Kupor said he would reject any
restrictive code against speech,
however, because "free speech is so
incredibly important to democratic
institutions."
Corry said that "the purpose of
Stanford is to seek the truth. The
meaning of education is [for a stu
dent] to be challenged and offended
from time to time."
Both Corry and Kupor said they
believe some speech is unaccept

able but that individuals should
fight bad speech with more speech.
They argue that speech restric
tions, no matter how narrow,
"chill" many forms of speech
because individuals become afraid
of violating the speech codes.
Corry and Kupor drafted all of
the case complaints themselves,
receiving minor help from Law
School professors and law firms
outside the University. They and
the seven other plaintiffs plan to
continue to represent themselves if
necessary.
A 'conscientious' policy
University representatives,
however, expressed displeasure
with the decision.
"A conscientious group of legal
scholars worked to stay within the
four corners of the First Amend
ment [when drafting the speech
code]," said University President
Emeritus Donald Kennedy, a biolo
gy professor.
The Grey Interpretation was
drafted during Kennedy's presi
dency.
Kennedy said he believes the
case will be appealed to a higher
level than the Superior Court. But
other University officials said they
were unsure whether an appeal
would be made.
"We will have to study the deci
sion before deciding what to do
next," said Deputy General Coun
sel Michael Hudnall.
"The court gave the matter a
good deal of attention, but I still
hold the view that the code is per
fectly constitutional," said David
Heilbron, a partner in the law firm
of McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and
Enersen which represented Stan
ford in the case.
"I think it is important to have
in mind what the code really says
— that students can't offend other
students with fighting words,"
Heilbron said.
Heilbron also said that beyond
the First Amendment issue, the
Leonard Law allows the state to act
"unwisely and well beyond consti
tutional limits."
University President Gerhard
Casper and General Counsel
Michael Roster were not in town
and were therefore unavailable to

comment on Stanford's future
actions.
Barbara Babcock, a law profes
sor and wife of Law Prof. Thomas
Grey, the drafter of the speech
code, said Grey wants the Universi
ty to defend the policy but has no
role in the debate.
"It's the University's code, not
his code anymore," she said.
Grey would not comment on the
decision.
Little impact?
University officials also ques
tioned the impact of the speech
code and the court decision on free
speech at Stanford.
"No one has ever been charged
under the Grey Interpretation,"
said Terry Shepard, director of
University communications, on
behalf of the University.
"Four and a half years is a fair
test to draw your own conclu
sions," he said, adding that the fact
that no one has ever been charged
with a speech code violation indi
cates either that the code has been
unnecessary or that it has served as
an effective deterrent to offensive
speech.
Law Prof. William Cohen said
the decision will have almost no
impact since no student has ever
been charged under the code.
The speech code was proposed
after a 1988 incident in Ujamaa
House — the African-American
theme house — when two fresh
men defaced a poster of Beethoven
by giving it stereotypical black fea
tures. A poster with the word "Nig
gers" scrawled across it was also
found in the house.
The Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council issued an opinion in
March 1989 which stated that indi
viduals and groups on campus
should be free from forms of
expression that degrade on the
basis of "personal or cultural differ
ences." The opinion was cited by
many in the University community
as being too vague and too restric
tive.
The council responded in April
1989 with the Grey Interpretation,
which was enacted in 1990. Despite
several challenges from the ASSU
and the student body, the interpre
tation has remained in place.
