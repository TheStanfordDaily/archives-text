In a precedent-setting decision yesterday, Santa
Clara County Superior Court Judge Peter Stone struck
down Stanford's speech code, upholding First Amend

First Amendment.
"By proscribing certain words, without even consid

a breach of the peace, [the] speech code fails to meet the

He upheld the plaintiffs' argument that the speech
