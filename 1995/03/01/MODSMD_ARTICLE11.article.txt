## 
### Beth Berselli Editorial staff 
"One and a Half," a sculpture
in the courtyard of the Law
School, was vandalized early
Saturday morning, causing
mtgor damage to the piece.
The sculpture — which is
composed of two circular disks
that stand vertically and paral
lel on a concrete base — was
"very badly damaged," said
Hilarie Faberman, Stanford
Art Museum curator of modern
and contemporary art.
"The piece is what you
would call in a car 'totaled,' "
Faberman said.
The bronze circular disk was
"pulled down 90 degrees from
its vertical position so that it is
now parallel to the ground,"
and the stainless steel circular
disk was "yanked out of plane,"
Faberman said.
In addition, the bronze was
"sheared" because "so much
force was used that it tore the
bronze," she said.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said police have no
clues about the vandal's identi
ty. No fingerprints were found
at the scene of crime.
A Stanford student reported
the vandalism at 1:15 a.m. on
Saturday, Niemeyer said.
The vandalism is believed to
have occurred late Friday night
or early Saturday morning
because the student passed by
the sculpture on Friday morn
ing and"it was fine then,"
Niemeyer said.

Museum officials will not
know the cost of the sculp
ture's damage until today,
when a professional sculpture
conservator will determine
what, if anything, can be done
to restore the piece and how
much it would cost, Faberman
said.
Niemeyer said the vandalism
does not appear to have been
motivated by any political or
social agenda. "It was just a
mere senseless act of vandal
ism," he said.
"It sounds like someone is
really bent on vandalizing [the
sculpture]. Somebody put a lot
of effort into it."
Considering the amount of
force needed to damage the
sculpture, the crime may have
been committed by more than
one person, Niemeyer said. "Or
the sculpture was vandalized
by someone very strong," he
said.
Also on Saturday morning,
police noted damage to another
sculpture in the Law School's
courtyard, Niemeyer said.
Niemeyer said that a "black
liquid substance that they
think is motor oil" was thrown
on "Le Faucon," a sculpture by
Alexander Calder.
However, museum officials
concluded that the damage to
"Le Falcon" was the result of
an earlier vandal, Faberman
said.
"We had seen that damage a
couple of days earlier," said
Susan Roberts-Manganelli,
museum registrar.
