## Balanced-budget vote is postponed 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In an atmosphere
of excruciating tension, Senate Republicans
flinched yesterday from a final vote on a con
stitutional balanced-budget amendment. One
vote shy, GOP leaders struggled to salvage
the centerpiece of their drive to shrink gov
ernment.
Republicans courted Democrat Kent Con
rad of North Dakota for the final, elusive vote
they needed. But after feverish, unsuccessful
negotiations, Majority Leader Bob Dole decid
ed to postpone the showdown rather than
accept defeat.
"I don't see a prospect for there to be a
meeting of minds," said Conrad.
Senators said the discussions focused on
Conrad's insistence that Social Security trust
funds be declared off-limits to budget cutters.
Several lawmakers said Republicans were
proposing to gradually phase out the avail
ability of the funds to balance the budget.
"This is a sad spectacle," said the amend
ment's principal foe, Democrat Robert C.
Byrd of West Virginia. "This has every
appearance of a sleazy, tawdry effort to win a
victory at the cost of amending the Constitu
tion."
But Dole, who said the vote was the most
important in the careers of many members of
the Senate, said majority Republicans have
every right to see if they can prevail. "And I
intend to do that," he added.
Earlier Republican efforts to persuade the
lone GOP holdout, Mark Hatfield of Oregon,
to provide the decisive 67th vote failed, leav
ing Republicans negotiating with Conrad in
hopes they could persuade him to come along
— and perhaps other Democrats as well.
The amendment would require a balanced
budget by 2002, unless three-fifths of both

houses vote otherwise. The House cleared the
measure, 300-132, in January as Republicans
worked to implement their conservative
"Contract With America."
The delay came at the end of a day-long
drama in which Republicans coughed up a
last-minute concession barring federal judges
from ordering tax hikes or spending cuts to
balance the budget. The change secured the
votes of Democrats Sam Nunn of Georgia and
John Breaux of Louisiana, but left the amend
ment one vote shy of the two-thirds necessary
for passage.
And hours later, as the time for a vote
came and went, the 46-year-old Conrad was at
the center of an intense series of meetings —
on a crowded Senate floor, then in one party's
cloakroom and the other — as the two sides
sought the vote that could determine the
amendment's fate.
The delay stunned a chamber packed with
senators ready to cast their votes after an
epic, month-long battle on the Senate floor.
Aides ringed the back of the chamber and
tourists peered down from the gallery as the
final showdown was unexpectedly put off by
voice vote.
As Dole walked out of the Senate at day's
end, he was vague on when the final vote
would be held, saying "maybe this week or
maybe not."
One other Democratic opponent said he'd
reverse field if Republicans would compro
mise on the issue. "They can pass a balanced
budget amendment in a flash — with my vote
and numerous others — if they will exclude
Social Security funds," said Sen. Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina.
As if to remind opponents of the potential
consequences of rejection, the 11 newly elect-

Ed GOP senators whose victories created a
new Republican mcyority sat together on the
Senate floor. Said Rick Santorum of Pennsyl
vania, at 36 the youngest among them, "The
people who will stand in the way of this bal
anced-budget amendment today will not be
around long to stand in the way the next
time."
President Clinton, who opposes the
amendment, watched on television as events
unfolded on the Senate floor, said White
House press secretary Mike McCurry. He said
Clinton met with White House chief of staff
Leon Panetta and planned to call wavering
senators.
The centerpiece of the Republican revolu
tion in Congress, the proposed amendment to
the Constitution is designed to end the run
up in federal debt that exceeds $4.8 trillion. A
similar measure cleared the GOP-controlled
House in January. Senate passage would
mean the House would have to vote on the
newly modified version before submitting it
to the states for ratification.
Both sides had delivered final arguments
on the measure.
"This vote is one of the most important
many of us will have cast in decades," Dole
said. "Congress needs the discipline" of an
amendment to make actual spending cuts, he
said.
Byrd, 77, said, "Change merely for the sake
of change" had become for some a virtue above
all others. "But I will never, never bow to
those messengers of expedience or to the man
agers of any political party's agenda," he said.
Countered Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee:
"The salvation of our country depends on it.
The future of our children depends on it."
