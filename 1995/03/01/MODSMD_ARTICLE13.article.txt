# Offender law struck down

NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A judge yester
day ruled unconstitutional New Jersey's
"Megan's Law" requirement that law
enforcement authorities notify the public
when a convicted sex offender is released
into a community.
U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan's
ruling applies only to those offenders whose
crimes were committed before Megan's Law
was enacted Oct. 31. Politan upheld the
requirement that offenders register with
authorities.
In striking down the notification provi
sion, Politan said the law amounts to addi

tional punishment for released sex offend
ers. When they committed their crimes, he
said, the community notification provision
didn't exist.
Megan's Law was enacted last fall in
response to the slaying of 7-year-old Megan
Kanka, allegedly by a sex offender who lived
across the street from her home in Hamil
ton Township.
The ruling came in the case of 49-year
old Alexander A. Artway. He was convicted
in 1965 of statutory rape and was found
guilty in 1971 of sodomizing a 21-year-old
woman.
