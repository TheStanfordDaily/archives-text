# Ex-President Salinas' brother charged with assasination
## Mexican murder suspect arrested 
### 
MEXICO CITY (AP) - The broth
er of a former Mexican president was
arrested yesterday and charged with
masterminding the assassination of a
high-ranking, reformist leader of the
ruling party.
The arrest of Raul Salinas de Gor
tari, brother of ex-President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, was the latest
stunning development in one of three
unsolved assassinations of top Mexi
can leaders over the past year.
The crimes have helped erode the
government's credibility with the
public and with investors — a factor
that may have contributed to Mexi
co's current economic crisis.
Salinas' arrest also was a major
show of political force and indepen
dence by President Ernesto Zedillo,
who was hand-picked by Carlos Sali
nas as his successor and who has
been accused of weakness in his first
three months in office.

Carlos Salinas, who was president
until Dec. 1, had insisted his govern
ment was doing all it could in the
probe of the Sept. 28 assassination of
Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu.
Ruiz Massieu, the secretary-gener
al of the ruling Institutional Revolu
tionary Party, or PRI, was gunned
down outside a Mexico City hotel. A
lone gunman had been arrested and
confessed to the slaying.
"No one is above the law," special
prosecutor Pablo Chapa Bezanilla
said in announcing the arrest at a
news conference. But he did not pro
vide a possible motive in the case.
Raul Salinas, 48, was taken into
custody Tuesday afternoon.
The arrest came only four days
after the attorney general's office
announced it had proven a conspiracy
in last year's other major assassina
tion, the March 23 murder of PRI
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo

Colosio.
Many Mexicans have long suspect
ed conspiracies in the two killings, as
well as the 1993 assassination of a
Roman Catholic cardinal in the west
ern state capital of Guadalajara. The
cases have not been linked by officials.
Chapa Bezanilla said the search
for those who plotted Ruiz Massieu's
murder was over unless other evi
dence arises — a hint that officials
will not try to actively implicate Car
los Salinas or other top PRI officials.
Raul Salinas is a former member of
the PRl's executive committee and
served at high levels in the govern
ment — positions that once might
have made him untouchable.
He and Carlos Salinas are both for
mer brothers-in-law of the victim,
who was a school friend of Carlos
Salinas and who married one of the
Salinas' sisters. They were later
divorced.
