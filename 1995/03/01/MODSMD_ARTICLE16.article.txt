British bank ruined
LONDON (AP) — Court-appoint
ed salvagers swarmed into Britain's
oldest investment bank Monday to
evaluate the remaining assets of Bar
ings PLC after a brash 28-year-old
trader ruined it by gambling on Tokyo
stock prices.
The failure of Barings — the 232-
year-old bank that financed the
Napoleonic wars and counts Queen
Elizabeth II among its clients
— jolted Asian financial markets, sent

the British pound tumbling against
other currencies, contributed to a stiff
late-afternoon fall in U.S. stock prices
and sent rumors flying that the
bank's losses could grow as details of
the fiasco emerge.
Barings' failure was blamed on
Nick Leeson, a Briton who worked for
Barings in Singapore and accumulat
ed $7 billion worth of risky invest
ments known as stock-index futures
contracts, linked to the performance
of Japan's stock market.
Leeson bet that the Nikkei 225

stock index, the main market barom
eter in Japan, would rise. It fell.
Then Leeson, who has been miss
ing since Thursday, apparently began
doubling up his bets in hopes of
recouping. The tactic cost Barings
hundreds of millions of dollars and
forced it under the control of outside
accountants.
Barings' losses came to about 625
million pounds, or $1 billion, by the
weekend, when the Bank of England
failed to rally other banks to rescue
Barings.
