Stanford should woo
prospectives with its
quality, not funding

IN STANFORD'S most recent
ploy to increase its student yield
figures vis-a-vis Harvard, 75
prospective freshmen will now
receive $1,500 research grants if
they choose to attend Stanford.
This plan, which would include
flying prospective grant recipients
to Stanford, should not be dis
guised as merely an attempt to pro
vide funding for research by excep
tional students. The administra
tion has owned up to the fact that
this program — which is much like
those designed to attract and
recruit athletes — was created with
the single purpose of increasing
Stanford's yield rate.
Unfortunately, offering these
grants to a selective group of
incoming freshmen will run
counter to the principle of equality
among incoming freshmen, which
Stanford has until now followed
closely. Not only will these grants
set one group of freshmen above
others, but they will also unreason
able allocate funds which could be
used by upperclassmen who have
shown their promise at Stanford.
While it is true that the Athletics
Department effectively gambles on
recruits in much the same way by
offering them money before they
arrive on campus, academics are a
different matter. It is often impossi
ble to predict who will become an
academic superstar after stepping
on campus. And, unlike athletics,
Stanford admits thousands of stu
dents each year — meaning that
there is a high probability that the
75 students selected for grants will
not be the true superstars.
In addition, giving money to the
students does not guarantee that
they will come to Stanford. They
may yet be attracted by the thought
of wearing the big "H" cap and
carousing in Cambridge.
And even those students who do

come to Stanford after being
offered a grant may not improve
the University's yield numbers. In
reality, there is no way for Stanford
to know whether prospectives are
choosing between Stanford and
Harvard or Stanford and Cal State-
Fullerton.
This discrepancy between poten
tial and product will come back to
haunt Stanford students not cho
sen for the grants. But Stanford's
admissions office is still left with
the formidable dilemma of over
coming Harvard's one-two admis
sions punch. We're still losing to
them in student yield by an impres
sive margin.
So what can the admissions
office do? Tell the truth. If Stanford
is so concerned about the fact that
Harvard attracts students better,
the University should stop beating
around the bush. In reality, this
new grant program is merely a half
hearted measure designed to con
ceal Stanford's agenda behind a
curtain of goodwill.
Maybe Stanford's admissions
office should give bonuses to stu
dents who turn down Harvard and
come to Stanford. A photocopy of
Harvard's acceptance letter would
suffice as proof, and the University
would be guaranteed an increase in
yield rate.
Or perhaps Stanford could
change the Cardinal to Crimson,
Palo Alto could change its name to
Cambridge and we could fool
unwitting students to come here.
To attract more students and
better students, Stanford must
focus on a loftier goal than bribing
prospective freshmen. The pro
gram's annual price of $112,500
could be better spent hiring a new
professor, bringing interesting
speakers to campus or wiring
another residence with in-room
computer connections.
After all, Stanford should be
aiming to make itself academically
the best university in the country, if
not the world.
And if high-school seniors still
choose Harvard, to hell with them.
We're still the best.
