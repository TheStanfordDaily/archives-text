## Boycott Ollie North's speech 
### 
GREETINGS AGAIN, mighty read
ers. I was originally going to write
a column on how utterly stupid
the city of Palo Alto is, but something
caught my eye, forcing me to change my
mind. I was performing my weekly rou
tine of scouring the pages of the Stanford
Review with my tongue when my furry
taste buds came upon something sour. It
was an advertisement announcing that
Oliver North was to speak on campus.
"A prank?" I thought. Oh no, Sean,
this was no prank. This was butt-cold
reality. Oliver North, so-called Mighty
Morphin' Defender of the Cosmic Apple
Pie, is going to be speaking his words of
wisdom on this campus tomorrow night.
At first, I laughed a hearty laugh. Ha ha
ha! Ho ho ho! But soon, the humor wore
off and the nausea set in.
First off, I found it terribly silly that
the Review would advertise the coming of
Ollie after heavily chastising the campus
for allowing beat poet Allen Ginsburg to
speak. First they scold us about how
awful we should feel about having a
"pedophile" speak, but then they go and
endorse a pervert of another sort. This
man has screwed the entire population of
the United States in one fell swoop.
Thank you, Ollie!
Here's the scoop. I do not like Oliver
North. I find it absurd that this man is
making money by writing books and
touring campuses. Oliver North is not a
"national hero" as many would wish you

to believe. Ollie is a stooge. He is worse
than Shemp. He is a lying, low-down,
toady suck-butt. Ollie steals candy from
little children. If he were a vegetable, I
bet he would taste like zucchini.
To be blunt, Ollie is a criminal. Now
normally I would condone a little crime.
As Big Bird once said, "When rules don't
reflect your reality, break 'em." But Ollie
went a little too far. He may be a rebel,
but not one that I can support.
This man disobeyed Congress by
diverting funds from U.S. arms sales to
Iran — at a time when Reagan was refer
ring to Iran as "Terrorist Central," or
some other nonsense — to the Contras in
Nicaragua to help them overthrow the
Sandanista government. He kept it secret
from the general populace, and supposed
ly the president as well. Yet he managed
to get off the hook through shredding
secret documents and pleading the Fifth
Amendment — the universal escape
hatch for greasy swindlers.
The entire logistics of the Iran-Contra
scandal are fairly confusing and, like
most governmental scandals (such as
Whitewater, October Surprise and the
Juice Boy fiasco), I would guess that a
large part of the country never under
stood it or has forgotten all about it by
now. The saddest part about the whole
thing is that Ollie has taken advantage of
the public's forgetfulness and has ridden
the wave of the whole incident to star
dom. Mention the words "Iran-Contra"

and your average drone will simply think
of Ollie North, without attaching any
negative significance to him. It is like free
advertising for Ollie. He began as a sim
ple U.S. Marine and is now an author, a
politician and the poster-boy of right
wing patriotism. Way to go, Hot Dog Boy.
So what should we do? My first idea
was to subvert the speech, somehow,
using 10 pounds of buttery tortillas, a
ball of twine and a box full of little green
Gideon bibles. However, I quickly theo
rized that Ollie would most likely bring
with him torrents of armed guards,
trained to mow down anyone raising
their hands above mid-waist level. So
much for "Operation Gideon."
Then I thought, "Maybe I should
openly protest his presence through a
demonstration of some sort." Unfortu
nately, I lack the ability to come up with
stirring political slogans to put on signs.
Plus, nothing rhymes with Oliver except
"Balliburr," and that's not a real word.
So the Joan Baez plan was out, too.
Finally, it came to me. The best way to
show your dissent and let Ollie know how
you feel about him — don't go to the
speech.

Sean Kennedy invites Ollie to his room
tomorrow evening, where he will be wait
ing with a salami.
