Letter attacking Muslim network was ignorant and racist

I AM WRITING in response to yester
day's letter about recent Muslim ter
rorist activities. Criticizing the sup
posed hypocrisy of the Muslim Student
Awareness Network's declaration of
peace and justice, Ronen Brafman
claimed that Muslim terrorist activities
are "anything but peaceful and just."
Take another look, Ronen. Your sweep
ing generalizations are what's not just. I
may not be a very devout Muslim and I
am not part of the campus Muslim net
work, but I know well enough to be
insulted by the overwhelming racism of
your comments.
The ignorance of your statements was

blinding. All Muslims are murderers. No
Muslim can ever truly want peace. We
are all the same. Hate to burst your bub
ble, Ronen, but I haven't bombed anyone
lately. Just like there are violent and
hateful Muslims, so there ere peaceful
ones. Yes, I am ashamed of the heartless
actions of Muslim terrorists, but neither
I nor the Muslim Student Awareness
Network had anything to do with them.
Just like you have nothing to do with the
actions of a stranger halfway across the
world linked to you by the arbitrary
chance of race or religion. If we were all
to be held accountable for the actions of
our countrymen, our guilt would be

enough to drown the world.
What would you rather have? Should
the Muslim Student Awareness Network
be making a declaration of war? Perhaps,
since in your eyes, that must be what
they truly intend. If you're bent on hat
ing us, Ronen, it's a no-win situation. We
could declare peace or hatred, or braid
flowers in our hair for that matter, and
you'd still see what you want to see. And
that's too bad, because you will never see
the humanity behind any of us.
Many Muslims have died at the hands
of ignorance. I, for one, had to witness
the bloody war that the Islamic funda
mentalists inflicted upon my homeland. I

hate violence more than anyone, but I
refuse to put the blame on the blameless.
It would only be widening the circle of
bigotry ... which is exactly what you are
doing. Not to mention demeaning all
Jews to the level of victims. Give others
the right to judge for themselves if they
want to live by such stereotypes. No,
Ronen, hate will certainly not unite us.
Especially the kind of hate you are per
petuating. The kind of hate that binds
you to those Islamic aggressors you hate
so much.
