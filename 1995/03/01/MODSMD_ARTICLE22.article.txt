# Postal Service has made many changes in order to improve mail delivery
## 
### 
This letter is in response to an article
regarding the post office's lease being
reconsidered published in The Stanford
Daily on Feb. 13.
The article portrays the Postal Service
as slow, inaccurate and late. The Postal
Service has made many changes to
improve the timely delivery of mail. In the
summer of 1993 two automated mail pro
cessing/sorting machines were installed at
the Palo Alto main post office. These
machines will sort mail at a rate of 30,000
to 40,000 pieces per hour. Presently, these
machines sort the Stanford box section
mail into sequential order. All first class
mail is processed by the Palo Alto main
office by 9 a.m. and is placed into the
boxes at Stanford on a regular basis by 12
p.m. The Palo Alto main office processes
approximately 500,000 to 600,000 pieces
of mail a day, and we realize that some
delays may occur. We have seen a dramat
ic decrease in complaints and hope that
the Stanford community has seen an
increase in service.
In our retail area we have created

another window position which, during
peak hours allows us to staff to a maxi
mum of six windows. We have replaced
the vending machine in the lobby with
one which offers more products and
stocks larger quantities. In responding to
suggestions from the Stanford communi
ty, a parcel pick-up door has been opened
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on a daily basis since
late 1993.
In order to address areas of concern,
the Postal Service joined with the ASSU
and the Council of Presidents to form the
Postal Advisory Board. The board is com
prised of volunteers from various portions
of the Stanford community. We see the
advisory board as an important communi
cation link between the Stanford commu
nity and the Postal Service.
