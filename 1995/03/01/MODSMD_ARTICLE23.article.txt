# Muslim advertisement was offensive, but the response was as well
## 
### 
The letter in yesterday's Daily
responding to the Muslim Student
Awareness Network fails to point out
the fundamental issue at hand. In his

letter, Ronen Brafman states the other
side of the conflict represented in the
Muslims' advertisement from Monday's
Daily. All of Brafman's facts are correct;
in fact, he calls attention to a very cru
cial understanding — violence in Israel
has by no means been created by the
Israeli Jews. The Jewish people of Israel,
representing the only democracy in the
Middle East, have been defending them
selves against Muslim terrorism for as
long as they can remember. Indeed, the
Palestinian Islamic movements do
oppose the peace treaty between Israel
and the PLO. However, Brafman only
lowers himself to the level of the Mus
lims' offensive advertisement by merely
using defensive arguments which appear
just as bitter and hateful.
Although Brafman is justified in his
anger and frustration, he doesn't deal
with the primary issue, which is the fol
lowing — the Muslim advertisement's
content undermines its purpose. The
Muslim Student Awareness Network
claims to seek peace by including an
illustration of doves and guns allied with
the bold slogan, "The Madness Must
Stop." However, by listing only the
offenses of one side without mentioning
the violence of the other, the network
only expresses militancy. By the defini
tion of peace, opposing parties must

work together for justice. This does not
include the gathering of support and
empathy by means of misrepresenting
facts taken out of context. Obviously, if
the Muslim Student Organization were
seeking peace, which I wish it were, it
never would have paid for such a biased,
angry outcry. I hope that in the future
the Muplim and Jewish students will be
able to come together for a more peace
ful understanding, but this is not the
way to do it.
