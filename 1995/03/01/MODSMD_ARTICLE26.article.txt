Stanford Democrats 9 letter was the i whining of spoiled children 9

AFTER REACHING the end of
Monday's letter attacking the
Contract with America, it was
hardly a surprise to discover that the
authors were freshmen and co-chairs of
the Stanford Democrats. However, the
fact that in a letter addressing the
"severe impact on the young people of
America" of budgetary decisions being
made in Washington, neither Bill Shen
nor Maria Bleavins felt the need to men
tion that the national debt is shocking.
After urging us to "look beyond the
distorted rhetoric," these political neo

phytes proceed to serve up a prodigious
dish of rhetoric while completely ignor
ing an undeniable truth — the national
debt is a problem of monumental
importance for the country, and partic
ularly for the young people of America.
If you were to sum the hardships
inflicted on the young by cuts in stu
dent aid programs, the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting, Americorps, AIDS
research, bilingual education and Head
Start, the total would be insignificant
to the point of irrelevance compared to
the catastrophic consequences down

the road of doing nothing to bring the
U.S. budget into balance. Yet our eager
young Stanford Democrats subject us
to a diatribe about cuts in these pro
grams, but include not a word about
the enormous debt burden which is a
drag on economic growth that will only
worsen.
I assume that even the freshmen co
chairs of the Stanford Democrats must
realize that a debt the size of the U.S.
GDP cannot be a good things for Ameri
cans, young and old, but particularly
young. The omission of even token sup

port for deficit reduction in their letter
betrays their professed intention to
educate Stanford students about the
Contract with America (or suggests a
complete lack of common sense).
Instead, it is clear they are simply stick
ing to the Democratic Party line, which
at the moment requires all government
spending to be defended as absolutely
vital to our continued survival as a
species. This is akin to releaving a
hangover by grabbing another bottle of
beer.
The Republican takeover of Congress

and the Contract with America have
sparked a national discourse on the pri
ority we assign each government pro
gram given the limitation of finite
national resources. The list of priorities
presented by Newt Gingrich is certainly
not the only one imaginable. It is not
even the best imaginable. But it is unde
niably a list. From our freshmen co
chairs of the Stanford Democrats, we
have only the whining of spoiled chil
dren.
