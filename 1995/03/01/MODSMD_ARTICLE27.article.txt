# Daily should not have printed 'debate' about Farm's alternative scene
## 
### 
Regarding the article published Feb
28, "Does Stanford benefit from its
alternative scene," we would like to

know how this type of useless informa
tion managed to get published in a rep
utable school newspaper? We will
refrain from commenting on Betsy's
limited world views, lest she think we
(like the rest of Stanford students) are
jealous of her status as a Pi Phi.
Instead, we will focus on The Daily's
role in providing her with a forum to

express her thoughts to the rest of the
Stanford community.
The title of this piece suggested that
we were going to be reading a well-con
structed debate highlighting the pros
and cons of an "alternative" lifestyle.
Instead, we were treated to a mud-sling
ing battle between Betsy and Stewart,
each one using The Daily's space to vent

their personal views on a wide variety of
topics. Few of these topics actually per
tained to the argument we had hoped to
read.
In the future, we hope that a half
page of valuable news space will not be
devoted to a futile argument between
two arguably small sectors of our uni
versity. If The Daily's purpose was quite

simply to rouse emotions in the reader
ship, congratulations! You've done it!
However, we hope that The Daily has
not been reduced to such tactics in order
to attract our attention.
