## Dealing with 'stage fright' — offstage New insights into vexing problem that has belittled our civilization for eons

Q:Why do I have trouble peeing when other
people are around?
RfPHH' — stage fright
A: In fact, this is one of the first questions I
ever received, soon after my metamorphosis
the Bug last year. For a long time, I
thought it would remain on my list of unanswered
(or unanswerable) questions, along with such
queries as the relative buoyancy of various forms
of excrement and other stranger and even more
vulgar topics.
However, I recently came across a series of
studies that shed light on the relatively unex
plored field of lavatory science and decided that I
could finally do justice to this question.
The basic explanation is that an invasion of

someone's personal space
can be a stressful event,
especially when one's geni
tels are involved. This stress
causes the sympathetic ner
vous system to k* c k
action -
The sympathetic ner
vous system, as regular read
ers may recall, is responsible
for the various forms of anx
iety and arousal; as all bio
students learn, the four F's :
"fight, flight, fear and sex."
one of itB side _ eff ects is to
constrict the muscles that
control the flow of urine.

Thus, stage fright occurs.
You may be surprised (or maybe not) to know
that studies have actually been done to verify the
fact that it's harder to pee when other people are
around. (In the technical jargon, "delay in onset
and. decrease in persistence of micturation.")
Some researchers took advantage of a men's
restroom at a Midwest university and rigged up
an intricate experiment setup to study the peeing
habits of the unknowing students. (Although
women can suffer the same problems, it can be
more pronounced in men who actually stand side
by-side at urinals.)
When a man entered the L'il Boys Room, he
was confronted with one of three scenarios.
Either 1) He was all alone; 2) A co-conspirator of
the researchers was using one urinal, ana the only
available one was separated from him by an "out
of order" urinal; or 3) The only available urinal
was right next to the co-conspirator.
There was one catch to this experiment — the
researchers had to time the onset of urination
accurately. It was discovered that listening
wouldn't work — the splash in these urinals
wasn't loud enough. So another conspirator was
planted in one of the stalls, with a pile of books at
his feet. The books concealed a periscope which
was aimed at the subject's groin. To me this
seems a little above and beyond the call of duty
(and would probably make a good Sharon Stone
movie).
Now for the hard-earned results: it took an
average of 4.9 seconds for the guys who were all
alone to start, 6.2 seconds for the guys who were
one urinal away, and 8.4 seconds for the guys who
were shoulder-to-shoulder. So your performance
anxiety is not unique — it's a well-established
medical phenomenon.
It seems that there has been a lot of other
important research done in lavatories, rather
than laboratories, and now seems a good time to
bring some of it up.
On the subject of male-male inhibitions, there
is an interesting study done at USC investigating
pheromones, the chemicals emitted by animals,
often to attract the opposite sex. Although no
pheromones have been shown to serve as an
aphrodisiac for humans, this study suggests that
humans are subject to subconscious olfactory sig
nals.
Male pigs have been shown to produce a sub
stance called androatenol to induce female pigs to
mate. When androstenol was found in human
male urine and armpit sweat, people began to
wonder what role it served for humans.
So the researchers placed a plastic square on
each of four stalls. A solution, essence of
androstenol, was placed on one of the doors. The
use of that stall dropped dramatically, from 20
visits per week, to only four. The faint smell of
androstenol could not be held responsible,
because a control was performed with a close rel
ative of androstenol, which has a nearly identical
smell but didn't affect stall usage.
So something was subconsciously keeping
these guys from using the stall. It has thus been
hypothesized that androstenol may serve as a ter
ritorial marking signal, like dogs peeing on fire
hydrants, wolves delineating their turf and the
smell in certain fraternity houses.
I hope this gives you something to think about
next time you hit the bathroom. And next time
you see books on the floor of the stall, check that
there's no periscope peering out from them.

Don't wait to see the Bug standing at a urinal. E
