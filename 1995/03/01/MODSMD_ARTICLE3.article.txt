# ASSU puts 28 fee requests on ballot
## Only significant senate debate centers on Daily's funding request 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Contributing writer 
The ASSU last night approved the special-fee
requests of 29 student organizations, which to
taled $1,056,010.
No group's fee was denied at the ASSU Sen
ate meeting, and the fee requests will now be put
on the April election's ballot for approval by stu
dents.
Most of the requests for funds were approved
unanimously. The special-fee request of The
Daily was the only one that sparked long debate,
although the request was ultimately endorsed.
Several people spoke against The Daily's re
quest.

"The Daily is a large organization that has
lots of resources not available to others," gradu
ate senator Christopher Hondl said. "It may be
able to find funding through other mecha
nisms."
Former senator Kevin Murdock added that
the special-fee funds are not important for the
survival of The Daily.
"Forty-four thousand dollars (The Daily's re
quest) is not necessary for The Daily," Murdock
said. "They can survive... without it."
Undergraduate senator Stephen Russell dis
agreed. "The Daily receives money from the
ASSU as a part of the commitment to the stu
dents to distribute [The Daily for freel," Russell
said. "The figure is completely reasonable given

the cost of subsidizing The Daily on campus."
Murdock alleged, however, that the money
improperly goes to paying for student salaries
and students should not be supporting the
salaries of The Daily staff.
Graduate senator Juan Taboas said that he
thought students also do not know what their
Daily special fees go toward.
During the meeting, Taboas proposed an
amendment to split The Daily special-fee request
into two parts — salary and distribution. The
amendment eventually failed.
This division does not correspond to reality,
said ASSU Financial Manager Gabe Lucas.
"This (division) distorts the budget of The
Daily," Lucas said. "There are
numerous costs and incomes. The
division (between salaries and dis
tribution costs) is not realistic. It
could not be enforced."
Other expenses besides salaries
and distribution include, for exam
ple, approximately $284,000 for
printing and $180,000 a year for
ASSU Type and Design services,
according to the budget submitted
bv The Daily.

"Other groups who submit bud
gets might not report unrestricted
income for fear that the senate
might change their request," in the
future, Lucas said in opposition of
splitting the request.
There are also other special-fee
groups whose members receive
salaries, undergraduate senator
Jerry Chen said. Undergraduate
senator Charles Katz pointed out
that the ASSU pays students and
has outside sources of funds.
In any case, Russell said, stu
dents have approved The Daily's
fee requests in the past. "Students
overwhelmingly support it,"he

said. "Students agree year after
year on the $44,000 figure."
Besides objecting to the request
of The Daily, Hondl opposed fund
ing the Stanford Hybrid Automo
bile Research Project and the Stan
ford Jazz Orchestra.
"The reason that special fees are
so high is that there is lots of stuff
that shouldn't be paid for," Hondl
said.
The research project should be
funded by the School of Engineer
ing and the jazz orchestra by the
Music Department, Hondl said.
However, both requests were
approved.
