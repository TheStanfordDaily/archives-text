# ASSU puts 28 fee requests on ballot
## Only significant senate debate centers on Daily's funding request

The ASSU last night approved the special-fee

said. "The figure is completely reasonable given

the cost of subsidizing The Daily on campus."

Daily special fees go toward.
During the meeting, Taboas proposed an
amendment to split The Daily special-fee request
into two parts â€” salary and distribution. The
amendment eventually failed.
This division does not correspond to reality,
