# Dispelling the myth of DNA's durability
## Work on DNA mechanisms gains worldwide attention for Stanford prof. 
### Dev Nag Contributing writer 
Before you finish reading this arti
cle, each strand of DNA in your body
will have lost thousands of bases.
Scientists have always thought of
DNA as one of the most stable mate
rials within the various realms of
biology — after all, your DNA is con
stantly enduring toxic chemicals,
ultraviolet light and other types of
radiation. The hardiness of DNA
seemed a natural consequence. You
couldn't possibly pass your genes on
to offspring if your DNA were being
destroyed.
But DNA is damaged at a rapid
rate. As Stanford Biology Prof.
Philip Hanawalt suspected more
than thirty years ago, your cells must
act beyond simply maintaining their
DNA — they must constantly repair
damage. And this damage occurs
from events less terrifying than trip
ping into a puddle of carcinogens.
The mere act of metabolizing oxygen
(which occurs in many biological pro
cesses) releases free radicals, chemi
cals which can tear into DNA.
One of Hanawalt's favorite
insights from his studies of DNA
repair is that DNA's basic nature is
to break down. "Originally we
thought the only reason cells needed
a DNA repair mechanism was to
recover from external damage," he
said. "That has become a continuing
misconception."
The repair occurs during tran
scription, a highly critical event
where DNA is copied for protein syn
thesis and other crucial functions.
Errors during transcription can lead
to various diseases. In transcription,
a replication complex moves down
the DNA strand, splitting it open like
a zipper and reading off the bases.
The copy of the DNA strand, known
as RNA, is constantly being length
ened as the replication complex adds
on copies of each base it sees.

Damage to the DNA can take on
several forms. One important type
involves spontaneous kinks in the
DNA chain. Sometimes adjacent
bases on one side of the DNA helix
will bond together, or dimerize. The
tight-fitting replication complex will
jam at the site of dimerization, caus
ing the replication molecule to
undergo a conformational change,
altering its shape.
When this happens, the DNA
repair enzyme (known as TRCF)
binds to the stalled replication com
plex. This somehow causes the repli
cation molecule to back a few bases
away from the site of damage, reveal
ing the lesion in the DNA. Another
enzyme known as the excision repair
complex will then cut out the offend
ing bases and replace them.
Hanawalt's research has even
interested the mainstream science
media. The journal Science named
the enzyme responsible for DNA
repair as "Molecule of the Year" last
December and asked Hanawalt to
contribute a perspective on his dis
covery.
"More surprises and complexities
may be in store before we fully under
stand the mechanism and biological
implications of transcription-coupled
repair," he wrote. "Max Delbruck
reflected long ago that 'any living cell
carries with it the experiences of a bil
lion years of experimentation. You
cannot expect to explain so wise an
old bird in a few simple words.' "
Hanawalt began work on DNA
repair as a graduate student in bio
physics at Yale. Working in Roger
Setlow's lab in the late '50s,
Hanawalt examined the effects of
ultraviolet light on bacteria and on
the synthesis of DNA and RNA. No
one had quantitatively studied these
results before — James Watson and
Frances Crick had only elucidated the
structure of DNA a few years before.
"We used radioactive probes to
show that ultraviolet light inhibited

DNA synthesis for some time, after
which it recovered. We surmised that
there was some mechanism that
allowed the bacteria to overcome the
damage," Hanawalt said.
Hanawalt then moved to Den
mark and did not resume work on
DNA repair until 1961, when he
came to Stanford as a research asso
ciate in biophysics. Working with
graduate student David Pettijohn,
Hanawalt discovered the phe
nomenon of NER — nucleotide exci
sion repair.
Especially interesting to
Hanawalt are the social conse
quences of his findings. For example,
rodents have traditionally served as
adequate subjects for testing envi
ronmental carcinogens. Hanawalt
has his doubts about this practice.
"They may not be that good a
model for the way humans repair
some kinds of damage," he said. "It's
often found that rodents are far
more sensitive to getting cancer than
humans are. Sometimes we may be
vastly overestimating the risk. We
may be spending billions of dollars to
clean up 'toxic' sites, but what we're
cleaning up might be harmless."
One everyday illustration is the
sugar substitute saccharine. Though
phrases on packets warn that the
substance is considered a carcinogen,
Hanawalt said the warnings are mis
leading.
"Saccharine causes cancer in the
bladder of the male rat. It doesn't
cause cancer in the bladder of a
female rat, it doesn't cause cancer in
mice, and it doesn't cause cancer in
humans," he said. "The reason it
causes cancer in the male rat bladder
is that it forms an insoluble crystal
which irritates the bladder walls; the
irritation leads to cancer."
Hanawalt has plenty of these

examples. "Ascorbic acid, also known
as Vitamin C, also causes cancer in
the bladder of the male rat. If we
were to apply the same test to orange
juice as we do to saccharine, then
humans wouldn't be allowed to drink
orange juice," he said. "So you can
see how it could get pretty ridiculous.
In fact, if we applied the same stan
dard, then we wouldn't be able to
drink enough orange juice to keep us
from getting scurvy."
This study of risk assessment
leads to other insights. Taking the
example of pesticides, Hanawalt per
ceives the need to examine the trade
offs of using such chemicals as DDT.
"If you're going to kill 1 in 10,000
people because of bacterial infections,
without the pesticides, but you're
going to kill 1 person in fifty million
from cancer with the pesticides, isn't
it worthwhile to use the substance to
save the 1 person in 10,000? These
are the kind of things we have to face
that come from the broader view of
how agents interact with cells and
DNA," he said.
Hanawalt plans to continue work
ing with the ramifications of his
research on the public policy level.
He sits on a scientific advisory panel
which oversees California's imple
mentation of Voter Initiative 65,
ensuring that the law (requiring a
warning for any carcinogenic materi
al) is applied in a rational manner.
"I've come from very basic studies
of DNA to a growing interest in the
implication of these repair processes
for understanding how human cells
respond to these agents," Hanawalt
said. "If you look at any complex sub
stance that we eat, like broccoli—
there are at least six carcinogenic
substances in broccoli. But no one
would suggest that we stop eating
broccoli."

DNA repair until 1961, when he
came to Stanford as a research asso
ciate in biophysics. Working with
graduate student David Pettijohn,
Hanawalt discovered the phe
nomenon of NER — nucleotide exci
sion repair.
Especially interesting to
Hanawalt are the social conse
quences of his findings. For example,
rodents have traditionally served as
adequate subjects for testing envi
ronmental carcinogens. Hanawalt
has his doubts about this practice.
"They may not be that good a
model for the way humans repair
some kinds of damage," he said. "It's
often found that rodents are far
more sensitive to getting cancer than
humans are. Sometimes we may be
vastly overestimating the risk. We
may be spending billions of dollars to
clean up 'toxic' sites, but what we're
cleaning up might be harmless."
One everyday illustration is the
sugar substitute saccharine. Though
phrases on packets warn that the
substance is considered a carcinogen,
Hanawalt said the warnings are mis
leading.
"Saccharine causes cancer in the
bladder of the male rat. It doesn't
cause cancer in the bladder of a
female rat, it doesn't cause cancer in
mice, and it doesn't cause cancer in
humans," he said. "The reason it
causes cancer in the male rat bladder
is that it forms an insoluble crystal
which irritates the bladder walls; the
irritation leads to cancer."
Hanawalt has plenty of these

examples. "Ascorbic acid, also known
as Vitamin C, also causes cancer in
the bladder of the male rat. If we
were to apply the same test to orange
juice as we do to saccharine, then
humans wouldn't be allowed to drink
orange juice," he said. "So you can
see how it could get pretty ridiculous.
In fact, if we applied the same stan
dard, then we wouldn't be able to
drink enough orange juice to keep us
from getting scurvy."
This study of risk assessment
leads to other insights. Taking the
example of pesticides, Hanawalt per
ceives the need to examine the trade
offs of using such chemicals as DDT.
"If you're going to kill 1 in 10,000
people because of bacterial infections,
without the pesticides, but you're
going to kill 1 person in fifty million
from cancer with the pesticides, isn't
it worthwhile to use the substance to
save the 1 person in 10,000? These
are the kind of things we have to face
that come from the broader view of
how agents interact with cells and
DNA," he said.
Hanawalt plans to continue work
ing with the ramifications of his
research on the public policy level.
He sits on a scientific advisory panel
which oversees California's imple
mentation of Voter Initiative 65,
ensuring that the law (requiring a
warning for any carcinogenic materi
al) is applied in a rational manner.
"I've come from very basic studies
of DNA to a growing interest in the
implication of these repair processes
for understanding how human cells
respond to these agents," Hanawalt
said. "If you look at any complex sub
stance that we eat, like broccoli—
there are at least six carcinogenic
substances in broccoli. But no one
would suggest that we stop eating
broccoli."

Before you finish reading this arti
cle, each strand of DNA in your body
will have lost thousands of bases.
Scientists have always thought of
DNA as one of the most stable mate
rials within the various realms of
biology — after all, your DNA is con
stantly enduring toxic chemicals,
ultraviolet light and other types of
radiation. The hardiness of DNA
seemed a natural consequence. You
couldn't possibly pass your genes on
to offspring if your DNA were being
destroyed.
But DNA is damaged at a rapid
rate. As Stanford Biology Prof.
Philip Hanawalt suspected more
than thirty years ago, your cells must
act beyond simply maintaining their
DNA — they must constantly repair
damage. And this damage occurs
from events less terrifying than trip
ping into a puddle of carcinogens.
The mere act of metabolizing oxygen
(which occurs in many biological pro
cesses) releases free radicals, chemi
cals which can tear into DNA.
One of Hanawalt's favorite
insights from his studies of DNA
repair is that DNA's basic nature is
to break down. "Originally we
thought the only reason cells needed
a DNA repair mechanism was to
recover from external damage," he
said. "That has become a continuing
misconception."
The repair occurs during tran
scription, a highly critical event
where DNA is copied for protein syn
thesis and other crucial functions.
Errors during transcription can lead
to various diseases. In transcription,
a replication complex moves down
the DNA strand, splitting it open like
a zipper and reading off the bases.
The copy of the DNA strand, known
as RNA, is constantly being length
ened as the replication complex adds
on copies of each base it sees.

Damage to the DNA can take on
several forms. One important type
involves spontaneous kinks in the
DNA chain. Sometimes adjacent
bases on one side of the DNA helix
will bond together, or dimerize. The
tight-fitting replication complex will
jam at the site of dimerization, caus
ing the replication molecule to
undergo a conformational change,
altering its shape.
When this happens, the DNA
repair enzyme (known as TRCF)
binds to the stalled replication com
plex. This somehow causes the repli
cation molecule to back a few bases
away from the site of damage, reveal
ing the lesion in the DNA. Another
enzyme known as the excision repair
complex will then cut out the offend
ing bases and replace them.
Hanawalt's research has even
interested the mainstream science
media. The journal Science named
the enzyme responsible for DNA
repair as "Molecule of the Year" last
December and asked Hanawalt to
contribute a perspective on his dis
covery.
"More surprises and complexities
may be in store before we fully under
stand the mechanism and biological
implications of transcription-coupled
repair," he wrote. "Max Delbruck
reflected long ago that 'any living cell
carries with it the experiences of a bil
lion years of experimentation. You
cannot expect to explain so wise an
old bird in a few simple words.' "
Hanawalt began work on DNA
repair as a graduate student in bio
physics at Yale. Working in Roger
Setlow's lab in the late '50s,
Hanawalt examined the effects of
ultraviolet light on bacteria and on
the synthesis of DNA and RNA. No
one had quantitatively studied these
results before — James Watson and
Frances Crick had only elucidated the
structure of DNA a few years before.
"We used radioactive probes to
show that ultraviolet light inhibited

DNA synthesis for some time, after
which it recovered. We surmised that
there was some mechanism that
allowed the bacteria to overcome the
damage," Hanawalt said.
Hanawalt then moved to Den
mark and did not resume work on
DNA repair until 1961, when he
came to Stanford as a research asso
ciate in biophysics. Working with
