# Discovery of genes which cause certain cancers
## Genetic detection will allow early diagnosis and treatment of these, and other, cancers 
### Sara Bhargava Contributing writer 
Scientists at the National Cancer Institute have
recently identified a gene involved in von Hippel-
Lindau (VHL) disease, a discovery which could
have important implications for the early diagnosis
and treatment of kidney-cancer patients.
"Von Hippel-Lindau is a disease of many condi
tions; one is the presence of kidney cancer,"
explained Dr. Fuad Freiha, professor and chief of
the Department of Urologic Oncology at the Stan
ford Medical Center. Individuals with VHL disease
can also develop tumors in the nervous system,
adrenal gland, pancreas and eyes.
Von Hippel-Lindau disease occurs in one out of
36,000 babies born and renal carcinoma affects
over 27,000 people in the United States alone, caus
ing more than 11,000 deaths each year. The inci
dence of the kidney cancer is increasing at a rate of
2 percent annually.
"All of us have oncogenes which may lead to the
development of cancer," Freiha said.
There are generally two ways these oncogenes
can cause cancer. The first occurs when the gene is
stimulated by an agent which results in the pro
duction of proteins and growth factors that "cause
cells to multiply and behave in a wild fashion.
That's what cancer is — cells that become uncon
trollable," Freiha added. Stimulation can occur by
a mutation in the gene or an external factor such as
a virus.
A second mechanism which causes cancer
involves a class of tumor-suppresser genes. These
genes accompany oncogenes and keep them in
check in a healthy cell, but if something happens to

the suppresser B " the oncogene may go wild," Frei
ha said, resulting in the growth of a tumor.
The recently identified VHL gene may be one
such tumor-suppresser gene. Therefore any muta
tion in the gene or any external factor which ren
ders it ineffective will result in dysfunctional sup
pression of a renal oncogene, resulting in uninhib
ited growth of cells and a kidney tumor.
The VHL gene was identified by studying 110
families through the U.S. and Canada in which the
disease is common. These families showed a variety
of mutations in an area of the short arm of chro
mosome three. Humans have 23 pairs of chromo
somes in each somatic cell which contain all of the
body's genetic information.
One purpose of this type of genetic research is to
enable scientists and physicians to identify a defec
tive gene in patients long before they show symp
toms of a particular disease. This will allow for
early diagnosis and treatment of the condition.
Looking at chromosomes and DNA sequencing will
allow identification of a damaged VHL gene in
high-risk individuals. Particularly at risk are indi
viduals include those who have a family history of
VHL disease.
Identified patients can then be monitored care
fully so that early intervention may decrease mor
bidity. Currently, patients treated for early-stage
kidney cancer have a 95% chance for a five to 10
year survival. Those treated when cancer has
already begun to spread have only a 10 to 20 per
cent chance for two-year survival.
Another advantage of screening for VHL muta
tions is that those from high-risk families who are
identified as having normal VHL genes can be
spared a lifetime of wondering whether they will

become ill.
VHL disease occurs in both inherited and non
inherited forms. Genetically inherited VHL
involves tumors that are multifocal as well as bilat
eral, which means they occur in a number of places
in the body, including both kidneys.
The "two-hit" theory of cancer initiation pre
dicts that a person inherits a mutation that predis
poses him to the disease and then an additional
mutation later in life is required to result in cancer.
Because non-inherited forms of the disease require
two mutations in the VHL gene to occur sponta
neously, this is rare and therefore results in a later
onset of cancer.
Treatment for VHL currently involves surgery
to remove renal tumors. Kidney cancer is one of the
few types of cancer that is resistant to chemothera
py due to the genetic nature of its tumors. "These
tumors contain a multi-drug-resistant gene which
produces protein products which bind to and pump
out chemicals when they try to enter a cell," Freiha
explained. Other types of cancer with this special
resistant feature include certain types of ovarian
and prostrate tumors cells.
With the identification of the VHL gene, possi
bilities exist for the application of gene therapy in
treatment and prevention of VHL disease. Gene
therapy techniques entail correcting altered genet
ic sequences or adding new ones that will replace
missing gene products. "Eventually the treatment
of [all] cancers will involve the manipulation of
genetic makeup of tumors," said Freiha.
Research efforts for the future focus on under
standing the VHL gene further, from its specific
protein products to learning how exactly defects in
the gene are associated with cancer.
