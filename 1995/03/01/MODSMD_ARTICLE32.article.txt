## No longer also-rans Men now get air time 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
The scene is the Maples Pavilion locker
room for the Stanford men's basketball
team just after practice. The big screen
television is turned on to — what else —
ESPN's "Sports Center." Dickey V and his
infamous larynx have just appeared on the
screen. The topic on the table: Pacific 10
Conference basketball.
Most of the players have filed into the
room by now.
"Turn it up," says senior captain Bart
Lammersen.
The TV is turned up.
In all his loquacious glory, the grand
mage of the microphone lets loose on the
strength of the Pac-10 this year. First
there's UCLA, at number one this week.
Some cries of angst are emitted when a clip
is shown of Bruin Ed O'Bannon swatting
away swingman David Harbour's shot.
Then it's on to Oregon's turnaround this
year under coach Jerry Green. After that,
it's all about Lute Olsen's Wildcats.
The anticipation becomes suffocating.
Then point guard Brevin Knight's eyes
light up, and a smile spreads across his
face. It's Stanford time, baby.
Images of the raucous Maples Pavilion
crowd flash onto the screen. Then there's
forward Andy Poppink's over-the-shoulder
circus pass to Lammersen for a lay-up a
few weeks ago versus Cal. The team is
ranked 20th, and Vitale thinks that they
"are for real."
To top it all off, there's a segue into a
small feature about the Pac-10's best. Lo
and behold, who's there amongst such stel
lar seniors like Bruin Ed O'Bannon and
Arizona's Damon Stoudamire? Yup, you
guessed it, sophomore Knight in all his

fist-pumping glory.
O'Bannon finishes off the ESPN fea
ture by saying his team is going to Seattle
for the Final Four. Knight gives us his own
personal in-house finish saying his team is
going to Seattle.
He is swift to follow his proclamation by
another one — this time a grand call to
arms: "Let's lift weights!"
And just as quickly as a Brevin Knight
move to the basket, the entire squad stam
pedes en masse over to the weight room.
The exodus for some post-practice lifting
shouldn't be surprising at all because,
while it's nice to be on ESPN, it's even
nicer to stay there. And the Cardinal
knows full well about the ages of B.E.
(Before ESPN) and A.E. (After ESPN),
and without a doubt, the latter is pre
ferred.
"We had some timely wins early, [for
example] against Virginia and Wisconsin
— teams that were ranked," said head
coach Mike Montogmery. "That got us in a
position to get some recognition, and we've
taken advantage of that as well as with our
league being so strong. It's been fun for the
kids and the community. We're playing the
kind of basketball that we'd like to provide
on a yearly basis."
That certainly was not the case two
years ago. In an injury-racked year, the
team finished 7-23. It's a time and place
best forgotten.
"That's history now," Montgomery
said. "It's something you hope will never
happen. It was difficult on everybody."
Lammersen, a survivor of that woeful
season, lent his own views. "It was tough,"
said the senior center. "We were in a lot of
games, and the last four minutes we just
