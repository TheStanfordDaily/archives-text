## No longer also-rans Men now get air time 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
The scene is the Maples Pavilion locker
room for the Stanford men's basketball
team just after practice. The big screen
television is turned on to — what else —
ESPN's "Sports Center." Dickey V and his
infamous larynx have just appeared on the
screen. The topic on the table: Pacific 10
Conference basketball.
Most of the players have filed into the
room by now.
"Turn it up," says senior captain Bart
Lammersen.
The TV is turned up.
In all his loquacious glory, the grand
mage of the microphone lets loose on the
strength of the Pac-10 this year. First
there's UCLA, at number one this week.
Some cries of angst are emitted when a clip
is shown of Bruin Ed O'Bannon swatting
away swingman David Harbour's shot.
Then it's on to Oregon's turnaround this
year under coach Jerry Green. After that,
it's all about Lute Olsen's Wildcats.
The anticipation becomes suffocating.
Then point guard Brevin Knight's eyes
light up, and a smile spreads across his
face. It's Stanford time, baby.
Images of the raucous Maples Pavilion
crowd flash onto the screen. Then there's
forward Andy Poppink's over-the-shoulder
circus pass to Lammersen for a lay-up a
few weeks ago versus Cal. The team is
ranked 20th, and Vitale thinks that they
"are for real."
To top it all off, there's a segue into a
small feature about the Pac-10's best. Lo
and behold, who's there amongst such stel
lar seniors like Bruin Ed O'Bannon and
Arizona's Damon Stoudamire? Yup, you
guessed it, sophomore Knight in all his

fist-pumping glory.
O'Bannon finishes off the ESPN fea
ture by saying his team is going to Seattle
for the Final Four. Knight gives us his own
personal in-house finish saying his team is
going to Seattle.
He is swift to follow his proclamation by
another one — this time a grand call to
arms: "Let's lift weights!"
And just as quickly as a Brevin Knight
move to the basket, the entire squad stam
pedes en masse over to the weight room.
The exodus for some post-practice lifting
shouldn't be surprising at all because,
while it's nice to be on ESPN, it's even
nicer to stay there. And the Cardinal
knows full well about the ages of B.E.
(Before ESPN) and A.E. (After ESPN),
and without a doubt, the latter is pre
ferred.
"We had some timely wins early, [for
example] against Virginia and Wisconsin
— teams that were ranked," said head
coach Mike Montogmery. "That got us in a
position to get some recognition, and we've
taken advantage of that as well as with our
league being so strong. It's been fun for the
kids and the community. We're playing the
kind of basketball that we'd like to provide
on a yearly basis."
That certainly was not the case two
years ago. In an injury-racked year, the
team finished 7-23. It's a time and place
best forgotten.
"That's history now," Montgomery
said. "It's something you hope will never
happen. It was difficult on everybody."
Lammersen, a survivor of that woeful
season, lent his own views. "It was tough,"
said the senior center. "We were in a lot of
games, and the last four minutes we just
seemed to crumble. We just
couldn't finish games. We didn't
have the knack for winning. Last
year we turned that around a lit
tle bit, and this year even more
so.
"That was something you
never want to experience in your
life. After that year, we've
worked really hard not to let that
happen again."
Last season's 17-11 team
made great strides. With the
debut of Knight who garnered
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year
accolades, the Cardinal was back
on track. Still, a late season lost
to Washington State deep-sixed
hopes for an NCAA tournament
bid, and a first-round lost to
Gonzaga in the NIT left a bitter
taste in the team's mouth. Oh
yes, and ESPN appearances were
few and far between.
Not bad, but not great. Those
were the words previously syn
onymous to Stanford basketball.
Now, however, there's simply
no way around it. From the top,
from the bottom, from the left,
from the right, anyway you look
at it, this season has been a
turnaround, a meteoric rise from
mediocrity. The team, with some
time to mature — not to mention
the addition of 7-1 freshman cen
ter Tim Young — has come
together and blossomed, elevat
ing itself to a 17-6 record.
"We have a lot of talent that

no one really knew about or
appreciated," Lammersen said.
"Last year, Brevin came on the
scene. Andy's been a huge factor
in this year's success. He's done
the things it takes for us to win.
Dion's putting up tremendous
numbers. Tim's come in and had
a great impact."
All year long, Montgomery
has drawn the analogy of a puz
zle when describing the team.
Each player has a function,
whether it be Knight penetrat
ing, Cross shooting, or Young
banging. And when everything
fits, that's when the Cardinal
plays its best basketball.
"We work well together,"
Knight said. "We're becoming
more of a team. In the beginning
we were a team, but we still had
people doing their own thing, not
knowing where they fit in. Now,
I think everybody understands
where they fit in. We're playing
as hard as anybody.
"But we haven't peaked yet.
We've played some good games,
and we've played hard, but the
only thing is we haven't put that
all together where we're playing
hard and making plays. Once we
get to that point we'll be all
right."
While Stanford's surprising
play has taken most college bas
ketball pundits by storm, the
success hasn't really shocked the
team.
"Honestly, not to sound
cocky, I think we expected to be
this good," Lammersen said.
"Dave Harbour, Andy and I sat
down with our schedule last
summer and looked at all the

games. We figured that if we
could do the things we had done,
we would be good and we would
be tough. In fact, we expected to
be a little better. On the whole,
however, we're right about
where we expected."
Wait a minute, back up. Bet
ter than being nationally-ranked
for nine consecutive weeks? Bet
ter than a possible 20-win sea
son? Then again, lofty goals are
nothing new to this team.
In fact, heading down the
final stretch of the season, Stan
ford has its eyes set on not only a
NCAA tournament berth, but a
sweep of the last four regular
season games as well.
"Our goal is to win all four,"
Knight said. "I think to get into
the tournament, we need to win
three of four. We don't want to
go in with onlyl9 wins. We'd
rather go in with 20 wins. We
don't want to be one of those
teams on the bubble. We want to
go and win all four, so we don't
have anything to worry about."
The last four games — at Ore
gon State and Oregon, home
against Washington State and
Washington — are important in
more ways than one. First of all,
with an 8-6 conference record,
the Cardinal is in a three-way tie
for fourth-place in the Pac-10
with Oregon and Washington
State. Wins against both teams
are critical to break the gridlock.
Additionally, third-place Arizona
State, at 10-5, still has a remain
ing contest at Arizona, a game
that, if they lose, could result in
the Cardinal's rise to third.
In the overall tournament pic

ture, a third or fourth place fin
ish
would nearly guarantee an invi
tation. A fifth place finish would
most likely put Stanford on the
proverbial bubble. Nevertheless,
in the ever-pessimistic eyes of
Montgomery, nothing is guaran
teed and nothing is to be taken
for granted. Even as a top-20
team, the coach still treats it as
an uphill climb to the Big Dance.
"They're all important at this
point in time," Montgomery said.
"We can't afford to have a game
slip by us. Oregon State, Wash
ington, they all can beat you."
"There's nothing we can do
about [tournament selections]. I
know that if we post the kind of
wins we're capable of, we're
going to get great consideration.
I just don't want to make any
mistakes at this point."
If Stanford does get a chance
to put on its dancing shoes, and
it probably will, Knight and com
pany will get even more opportu
nities to be the object of Vitale's
sonorous sonnets.
"I don't know if we expected
as much press as we're getting,
but that goes along with being a
good team," Knight said. "Once
you get to be a nationally-ranked
team people want to know what
we're all about. I think the guys
are taking it well. We talk to the
press when we have to, we do
those things, but we also know
that we're playing basketball.
We don't want to get so caught
up that we forget what our goal
is."
Four wins, the tournament —
and Seattle.

lar seniors like Bruin Ed O'Bannon and
Arizona's Damon Stoudamire? Yup, you
guessed it, sophomore Knight in all his

fist-pumping glory.
O'Bannon finishes off the ESPN fea
ture by saying his team is going to Seattle
for the Final Four. Knight gives us his own
personal in-house finish saying his team is
going to Seattle.
He is swift to follow his proclamation by
another one — this time a grand call to
arms: "Let's lift weights!"
And just as quickly as a Brevin Knight
move to the basket, the entire squad stam
pedes en masse over to the weight room.
The exodus for some post-practice lifting
shouldn't be surprising at all because,
while it's nice to be on ESPN, it's even
nicer to stay there. And the Cardinal
knows full well about the ages of B.E.
(Before ESPN) and A.E. (After ESPN),
and without a doubt, the latter is pre
ferred.
"We had some timely wins early, [for
example] against Virginia and Wisconsin
— teams that were ranked," said head
coach Mike Montogmery. "That got us in a
position to get some recognition, and we've
taken advantage of that as well as with our
league being so strong. It's been fun for the
kids and the community. We're playing the
kind of basketball that we'd like to provide
on a yearly basis."
That certainly was not the case two
years ago. In an injury-racked year, the
team finished 7-23. It's a time and place
best forgotten.
"That's history now," Montgomery
said. "It's something you hope will never
happen. It was difficult on everybody."
Lammersen, a survivor of that woeful
season, lent his own views. "It was tough,"
said the senior center. "We were in a lot of
games, and the last four minutes we just
seemed to crumble. We just
couldn't finish games. We didn't
have the knack for winning. Last
year we turned that around a lit
tle bit, and this year even more
so.
"That was something you
never want to experience in your
life. After that year, we've
worked really hard not to let that
happen again."
Last season's 17-11 team
made great strides. With the
debut of Knight who garnered
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year
accolades, the Cardinal was back
on track. Still, a late season lost
to Washington State deep-sixed
hopes for an NCAA tournament
bid, and a first-round lost to
Gonzaga in the NIT left a bitter
taste in the team's mouth. Oh
yes, and ESPN appearances were
few and far between.
Not bad, but not great. Those
were the words previously syn
onymous to Stanford basketball.
Now, however, there's simply
no way around it. From the top,
from the bottom, from the left,
from the right, anyway you look
at it, this season has been a
turnaround, a meteoric rise from
mediocrity. The team, with some
time to mature — not to mention
the addition of 7-1 freshman cen
ter Tim Young — has come
together and blossomed, elevat
ing itself to a 17-6 record.
"We have a lot of talent that

no one really knew about or
appreciated," Lammersen said.
"Last year, Brevin came on the
scene. Andy's been a huge factor
in this year's success. He's done
the things it takes for us to win.
Dion's putting up tremendous
numbers. Tim's come in and had
a great impact."
All year long, Montgomery
has drawn the analogy of a puz
zle when describing the team.
Each player has a function,
whether it be Knight penetrat
ing, Cross shooting, or Young
banging. And when everything
fits, that's when the Cardinal
plays its best basketball.
"We work well together,"
Knight said. "We're becoming
more of a team. In the beginning
we were a team, but we still had
people doing their own thing, not
knowing where they fit in. Now,
I think everybody understands
where they fit in. We're playing
as hard as anybody.
"But we haven't peaked yet.
We've played some good games,
and we've played hard, but the
only thing is we haven't put that
all together where we're playing
hard and making plays. Once we
get to that point we'll be all
right."
While Stanford's surprising
play has taken most college bas
ketball pundits by storm, the
success hasn't really shocked the
team.
"Honestly, not to sound
cocky, I think we expected to be
this good," Lammersen said.
"Dave Harbour, Andy and I sat
down with our schedule last
summer and looked at all the

games. We figured that if we
could do the things we had done,
we would be good and we would
be tough. In fact, we expected to
be a little better. On the whole,
however, we're right about
where we expected."
Wait a minute, back up. Bet
ter than being nationally-ranked
for nine consecutive weeks? Bet
ter than a possible 20-win sea
son? Then again, lofty goals are
nothing new to this team.
In fact, heading down the
final stretch of the season, Stan
ford has its eyes set on not only a
NCAA tournament berth, but a
sweep of the last four regular
season games as well.
"Our goal is to win all four,"
Knight said. "I think to get into
the tournament, we need to win
three of four. We don't want to
go in with onlyl9 wins. We'd
rather go in with 20 wins. We
don't want to be one of those
teams on the bubble. We want to
go and win all four, so we don't
have anything to worry about."
The last four games — at Ore
gon State and Oregon, home
against Washington State and
Washington — are important in
more ways than one. First of all,
with an 8-6 conference record,
the Cardinal is in a three-way tie
for fourth-place in the Pac-10
with Oregon and Washington
State. Wins against both teams
are critical to break the gridlock.
Additionally, third-place Arizona
State, at 10-5, still has a remain
ing contest at Arizona, a game
that, if they lose, could result in
the Cardinal's rise to third.
In the overall tournament pic

ture, a third or fourth place fin
ish
would nearly guarantee an invi
tation. A fifth place finish would
most likely put Stanford on the
proverbial bubble. Nevertheless,
in the ever-pessimistic eyes of
Montgomery, nothing is guaran
teed and nothing is to be taken
for granted. Even as a top-20
team, the coach still treats it as
an uphill climb to the Big Dance.
"They're all important at this
point in time," Montgomery said.
"We can't afford to have a game
slip by us. Oregon State, Wash
ington, they all can beat you."
"There's nothing we can do
about [tournament selections]. I
know that if we post the kind of
wins we're capable of, we're
going to get great consideration.
I just don't want to make any
mistakes at this point."
If Stanford does get a chance
to put on its dancing shoes, and
it probably will, Knight and com
pany will get even more opportu
nities to be the object of Vitale's
sonorous sonnets.
"I don't know if we expected
as much press as we're getting,
but that goes along with being a
good team," Knight said. "Once
you get to be a nationally-ranked
team people want to know what
we're all about. I think the guys
are taking it well. We talk to the
press when we have to, we do
those things, but we also know
that we're playing basketball.
We don't want to get so caught
up that we forget what our goal
is."
Four wins, the tournament —
and Seattle.


Edgar Holmarw — Daily file
Sophomore forward Rich Jackson shoots over USC's Jaha Wilson. The
Trojans' fortunes have gone south, but the Cardinal's are rising.
The scene is the Maples Pavilion locker
room for the Stanford men's basketball
team just after practice. The big screen
television is turned on to — what else —
ESPN's "Sports Center." Dickey V and his
infamous larynx have just appeared on the
screen. The topic on the table: Pacific 10
Conference basketball.
Most of the players have filed into the
room by now.
"Turn it up," says senior captain Bart
Lammersen.
The TV is turned up.
In all his loquacious glory, the grand
mage of the microphone lets loose on the
strength of the Pac-10 this year. First
there's UCLA, at number one this week.
Some cries of angst are emitted when a clip
is shown of Bruin Ed O'Bannon swatting
away swingman David Harbour's shot.
Then it's on to Oregon's turnaround this
year under coach Jerry Green. After that,
it's all about Lute Olsen's Wildcats.
The anticipation becomes suffocating.
Then point guard Brevin Knight's eyes
light up, and a smile spreads across his
face. It's Stanford time, baby.
Images of the raucous Maples Pavilion
crowd flash onto the screen. Then there's
forward Andy Poppink's over-the-shoulder
circus pass to Lammersen for a lay-up a
few weeks ago versus Cal. The team is
ranked 20th, and Vitale thinks that they
"are for real."
To top it all off, there's a segue into a
