Maybe wearing a strapless dress
doesn't sound like a lot, but to
me it's the realization of a
dream. To be able to walk around in a

"cleavage gown" without it gracing my
ankles after the first step would be a
miracle. Alas, given the shape of my
body — or the lack thereof — I won't be
donning a hot little number anytime
soon without the assistance of wadded

up gym socks or cotton balls. (And
we're talking a lot of cotton.)
While this shortage of chest mass
frustrates me in times of prom dresses
and bikinis, I'm usually content with
my shape. I prefer to think of my flat
ness as sleek and aerodynamic — and
truly I believe it has helped me in the
realm of sports more than once. As
both a sprinter and a post player in
high school, I often gave thanks to my
A-cup genes despite my superficial con
cerns. Giving oneself black eyes jogging
down the street or worrying about a
defender smashing the dickens out of
one's hefty torso seem to be excessive
prices to pay for simply being able to
wear strapless dresses.
In any other context besides sports,
however, having a small chest is defi-

nitely not something to thank your
parents for. The models, the silhou
ettes on tire flaps, the idealization
of the "hourglass shape" are as
much a part of society as glass ceil
ings and the Juice Club. It's those
unnerving places where body ideals
and sports overlap that concerns
me lately.
I've always considered sports —
or working out — as an integral
part of a loop: I work out, I look bet
ter, I feel better, I work out more. I
just keep feeling better about
myself. The external rewards of
sweat and pain are firmer buns,
bigger biceps and slimmer thighs.
But rewards also come from the
inside, like the "runner's high" feel
ing of getting off one's arse and
doing something besides watching
Beavis and Butthead reruns all day.

But all along I've been wrong —
it's not that simple. There's anoth
er factor to the loop that I've under
estimated: the supreme influence
of the beauty standard in the world
of sports. It's not just about feeling
healthy and looking good. It's about
achieving that perfect figure, the
perfect buns to go along with the
perfect breast size. It's about look
ing good while striving to look good.
Under these rules, I can't feel
happy about my flat chest even in
athletics anymore.
Let's take the annual Sports
Illustrated swimsuit issue as an
example. We've got basketball
highlights on one page and Kathy
Ireland's thonged buttocks on the
next. How dare these models per
petuate the "beauty standard" in
my SI, of all places! Sports is where
I want to feel fired up and good
about myself, not where I want to
be barraged by Elle MacPherson's
boobs and buns everywhere. But
there they are, associated with the

most popular sports magazine in
the nation. I don't need that.
I want my stats, I want my pics.
I don't need the perpetuation of
ridiculous beauty standards in my
world of sports.
I'm willing to concede that it's
not all bad. Beauty goddesses Cindy
Crawford and Rachel Hunter have
workout videos on the market, and
I like that to some degree. As much
as it mixes beauty with sports, this
also shows these lovely ladies
sweating to the oldies; they're
working hard for their bodies.
They're doing something, not just
posing seductively on the beach for
SI photographers. Sweat can be
beautiful. Sports can be glamorous.
Most important — and this is
where Kathy and Elle can take a
hike — sports should be a place
where I am healthy and rewarded
no matter what I look like. It's just
for me.
It's idealistic — and probably
downright wrong — to try to draw

a separation between sports and
beauty. Sure, we work out so we'll
look more beautiful, and this
makes us feel more confident.
Beauty has its natural place in
sports. Rut I don't believe it's ideal
istic to believe in the appreciation of
bodies and not the objectification of
them. I don't want to feel disap
pointed if I never achieve a body
likely to be featured in the swimsuit
issue. That perpetuated expecta
tion is an insult to the sports world,
and it's an insult to me.
We're not all swimsuit issue
material, and frankly I'd rather be
on the basketball highlights page
any day. I wouldn't be half the aero
dynamic athlete I am if I had twice
the chest I do. And I'm willing to
bet that Kathy and Elle get black
eyes all the time.

Enough about chest size already —
it's as overrated as Burbank's IM
basketball team. Watch out, Alpha
