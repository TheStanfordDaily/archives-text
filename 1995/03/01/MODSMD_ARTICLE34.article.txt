# It's a Small world for goalie
## 
### Janice Podsada 
Figure it this way — the Ice
Capades will probably never call
Sami Jo Small for a try-out.
On practice nights at the Red
wood City Ice Oasis, Small slices
onto the rink, cutting circles in
the ice that will not mark the
heart-stopping triple axels that
are the flutter of a Nancy Kerrig
an or Kristi Yamaguchi. Small is a
skater without a tutu or a music
program. Her job is to stop pucks.
There is no lift-off with 60
pounds of padding strapped to
Small's 5-foot-6-inch frame.
Behind the white goalie's mask, a
pair of blue eyes focuses on face
offs, not jumps.
Small, a freshman, is one of
two goalies in the Stanford ice
hockey club, and the only woman
on the team. She attends Stan
ford on a track and field scholar
ship, but when Small isn't at class
or in cleats, she's on ice.
She turned down track schol
arships at Minnesota, Penn State
and Syracuse because they
wouldn't allow her to play two
sports. But the Stanford recruiter
said, "Yeah, sure you can play
hockey — as long as you can find
the time."
"It was the deciding factor,"
Small said. "But I'm not sure
Stanford thought I would really
play."
She wanted to play because she
has been on the ice, playing hock
ey with the boys since she was
four years old. Track can be a sin
gular sport, one that gives women
a shot at an athletic scholarship,
whereas hockey is about bonding,

being a team player, being "one of
the guys," Small said.
"I need to play," she said.
"Hockey is in my blood."
After the Stanford-California
game, a 10-1 win, you could see it
— the need. She flipped her long
blonde ponytail, she cracked her
knuckles excitedly, though it was
two days later and she admitted
to having told the story 20 or 30
times.
"Two thousand Berkeley fans
were yelling, 'You're a bitch. You
do the whole damn team. Get
back in the kitchen,'" she said.
Sticks and pucks can break
your bones, but words can never
hurt you. "When your team is
doing well, you almost thrive on
that stuff," she said.
Small is used to the taunts.
Although in Winnipeg, where she
grew up, a girl playing on a boys'
hockey team is not an anomaly,
Small is unique in the States,
especially at the college level.
"Guys on the other team will
hear a girl is playing, and they'll
skate up to me during practice.
They'll pretend like they're not
really looking," she said. "I feel
like saying, 'Yes, I'm a girl.'
Maybe I should put pink tape on
my skates or something."
Ernie Ferrari, the Stanford ice
hockey coach, admitted to being
shocked the September night he
heard a quiet voice on the phone
asking him if he let girls play on
the team.
"Whether or not we did, I had
to say yes," he said. "Stanford
told her she could play, but they

Freshman Sami Jo Small is equally comfortable
with pucks and javelins.
