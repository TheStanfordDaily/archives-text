# It's a Small world for goalie
## 
### Janice Podsada 
Figure it this way — the Ice
Capades will probably never call
Sami Jo Small for a try-out.
On practice nights at the Red
wood City Ice Oasis, Small slices
onto the rink, cutting circles in
the ice that will not mark the
heart-stopping triple axels that
are the flutter of a Nancy Kerrig
an or Kristi Yamaguchi. Small is a
skater without a tutu or a music
program. Her job is to stop pucks.
There is no lift-off with 60
pounds of padding strapped to
Small's 5-foot-6-inch frame.
Behind the white goalie's mask, a
pair of blue eyes focuses on face
offs, not jumps.
Small, a freshman, is one of
two goalies in the Stanford ice
hockey club, and the only woman
on the team. She attends Stan
ford on a track and field scholar
ship, but when Small isn't at class
or in cleats, she's on ice.
She turned down track schol
arships at Minnesota, Penn State
and Syracuse because they
wouldn't allow her to play two
sports. But the Stanford recruiter
said, "Yeah, sure you can play
hockey — as long as you can find
the time."
"It was the deciding factor,"
Small said. "But I'm not sure
Stanford thought I would really
play."
She wanted to play because she
has been on the ice, playing hock
ey with the boys since she was
four years old. Track can be a sin
gular sport, one that gives women
a shot at an athletic scholarship,
whereas hockey is about bonding,

being a team player, being "one of
the guys," Small said.
"I need to play," she said.
"Hockey is in my blood."
After the Stanford-California
game, a 10-1 win, you could see it
— the need. She flipped her long
blonde ponytail, she cracked her
knuckles excitedly, though it was
two days later and she admitted
to having told the story 20 or 30
times.
"Two thousand Berkeley fans
were yelling, 'You're a bitch. You
do the whole damn team. Get
back in the kitchen,'" she said.
Sticks and pucks can break
your bones, but words can never
hurt you. "When your team is
doing well, you almost thrive on
that stuff," she said.
Small is used to the taunts.
Although in Winnipeg, where she
grew up, a girl playing on a boys'
hockey team is not an anomaly,
Small is unique in the States,
especially at the college level.
"Guys on the other team will
hear a girl is playing, and they'll
skate up to me during practice.
They'll pretend like they're not
really looking," she said. "I feel
like saying, 'Yes, I'm a girl.'
Maybe I should put pink tape on
my skates or something."
Ernie Ferrari, the Stanford ice
hockey coach, admitted to being
shocked the September night he
heard a quiet voice on the phone
asking him if he let girls play on
the team.
"Whether or not we did, I had
to say yes," he said. "Stanford
told her she could play, but they

never told me."
At the start of the season, Fer
rari didn't tell any of the other
coaches in the league that his
goalie was a girl. Other teams
thought it was some kid with long
hair, he said. Ferrari even gave
Small her own locker room. But
she protested, saying it was
unfair to the 20 other team mem
bers crammed into one locker
room when there were two. Fer
rari relented. Now she changes in
the same dressing room as every
one else. "It's not an issue," for
ward Arnold Ceballos said. "She's
one of the players."
Ferrari showcases her at all
the important games. She draws
crowds and little kids who want
her autograph. Opposing fans
chant, "Bring out the girl." Small
is his ice princess, and the team is

on its way to club nationals.
Small's goalkeeping remains a
novelty. Ferrari capitalizes on it.
Team members accept it. As one
player explained, "We like it when
she's out there playing." Track and
field coach Robert Weir hates it.
When Weir first learned of
Small's moonlighting, he wasn't
crazy about it, but he let it go.
However, as the start of track sea
son drew near, he one day told
Small — who throws discus and
javelin — "No more hockey."
That night Small showed up to
practice without her equipment,
Ceballos said. "She told us she
couldn't play. She shot the puck
around with us, which goalies
don't usually do. Then she sat on
the bench the rest of the
evening."
Weir's ultimatum conflicted
with the hockey club's last few
games of the season. Minus
Small, the team would be without
a second goalie during nationals.
Weir doesn't want her getting

hurt. Small insists that except for
a few bruises she has never been
injured playing hockey. And she is
the first to admit that track is her
top priority: "That's why I'm
here." But Small told a teammate
that if she were to win the nation
al title for javelin throwing it
would not bring Stanford as
much attention as her goaltend
ing at this year's club nationals.
After a tense negotiation, Weir
allowed Small to continue playing
hockey. Still, a frown comes to
Weir's face when he discusses
what he seems to know is Small's
passion.
"She has been skating since
she was four years old," Weir
said. "Skating is to her like walk
ing. However, ice hockey did not
recruit her. I cannot by all rights
sanction her playing. It is a novel
ty. But there is a potential risk of
injury regardless. The reality is
she has to fulfill her responsibili
ty here on the field."
It is a cold February day, but

only for those standing still.
Small bounds across Stanford's
Angell Field, javelin in hand.
Weir is by her side, doing what
coaches do. He watches her throw,
cocking his head, observing her
follow-through. Her hips swing
upward. "You've got to keep that
down, Sami Jo," he says, slapping
the sides of his hips.
Weir trots to the other end of
the field to check out the shot
putters. Spring is in the air, but
hockey is in the blood.
Out of ear-shot, Small glances
back at him, biting the corner of
her lip.
"What did he say about me?"
she asks her visitor.
"He said, for you, skating is
like walking."
Small picks up the javelin once
more, begins a syncopated run
down field, and then hurls it
cleanly through the air in one
long, smooth arc.
"I skate better than I walk,"
she hollers.
