Stanford 2
Pacific 10

Sophomore pitcher Jason Middle
brook returned to form for the 12 th
ranked Stanford baseball team yester
day afternoon. Unfortunately, it wasn't
nearly enough as the Cardinal fell 10-2
at the University of the Pacific.
Though Middlebrook handcuffed the
Tigers through his pre-set first two
innings of work, Stanford's bullpen sur
rendered eight runs over a three-inning
stretch as Pacific (12-6) rallied to send
the Cardinal (11-8) to its seventh non
conference loss.
"I don't know if it's because we were

tired or what, but we just didn't play up
to our potential [yesterday]," said
sophomore pitcher Eric Dreier. "We had
a long talk with the coaches after the
game and I'm sure that after a few prac
tices we'll be ready to go against Cal this
weekend."
Ron Lewis, the Tigers' starting pitch
er, went the distance, allowing just four
base hits while striking out eight Stan
ford batters. Lewis carried a two-hitter
into the ninth.
Middlebrook also appeared unhit
table, striking out five UOP batters
while walking just one.
"This was definitely a big start for
Middlebrook," said Dreier — who
worked a scoreless eighth inning for the
Cardinal. "He needed to work on some
mechanics and get back to where he
should be and he did that."
But the Tigers rallied in the third for
three runs off of junior reliever Todd
Bartels — who took the loss for Stan

ford — before putting a five-spot up in
the fifth.
Bartels plunked Ramy Dickerson to
open the third and then compounded his
mistake with a bad throw after fielding
a bunt to advance Dickerson to third.
Two walks and two infield groundouts
later, Stanford suddenly trailed 3-1.
Things unraveled for the road-weary
Cardinal — which was playing its fifth
consecutive game away from Sunken
Diamond — in the bottom of the fifth.
Pacific pounded out four hits in that
inning, while also benefiting from a pair
of Stanford walks and errors, to put the
game away with five runs.
Carver — last week's Pacific 10
Southern Division Player of the Week —
led the Cardinal offense with two hits on
the afternoon, including a run-scoring
triple. Only two other Stanford hitters,
Troy Kent and Brian Dallimore, man
aged base hits on a day when the bats
fell silent.
