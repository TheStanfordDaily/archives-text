The Stanford horse polo teams
returned from this past week
end's match against Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo with a tie and a loss
after the men's team (0-3-1)
fought to a 10-10 deadlock and
the women (0-1-3) fell 7-6. The
one bright spot was the women's
B team, which won 8-6.
A polo match consists of four
periods know as "chukkers" that
last seven and a half minutes
each. Three players make up a
team; one is designated as
offense, the second is play-maker
and the third is defense.
Juniors Jeff Heeder and Jason
Knight and sophomore Adam
Strom make up the men's team,

which played a tough match. "It
was a good, hard, fast-paced
game," Knight said.
Knight, who plays position 3, is
optimistic about the season and
the up-coming regionals. "We
have a solid team, and we can beat
just about anybody [in the region
al tournament]," he said.
There are four regions in
NCAA polo: West, Northeast,
Southeast and Central. The win
ners of each of the regional tour
naments go on to play in the
national tournament which the
men's team has qualified for the
last three years.
