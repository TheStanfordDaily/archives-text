# Polo striving for win

### Noel Manalo 
The Stanford horse polo teams
returned from this past week
end's match against Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo with a tie and a loss
after the men's team (0-3-1)
fought to a 10-10 deadlock and
the women (0-1-3) fell 7-6. The
one bright spot was the women's
B team, which won 8-6.
A polo match consists of four
periods know as "chukkers" that
last seven and a half minutes
each. Three players make up a
team; one is designated as
offense, the second is play-maker
and the third is defense.
Juniors Jeff Heeder and Jason
Knight and sophomore Adam
Strom make up the men's team,

which played a tough match. "It
was a good, hard, fast-paced
game," Knight said.
Knight, who plays position 3, is
optimistic about the season and
the up-coming regionals. "We
have a solid team, and we can beat
just about anybody [in the region
al tournament]," he said.
There are four regions in
NCAA polo: West, Northeast,
Southeast and Central. The win
ners of each of the regional tour
naments go on to play in the
national tournament which the
men's team has qualified for the
last three years.
Junior Ilia Christy, position 2
on the women's team and presi
dent of the Stanford Polo Club,
feels the same confidence in her
squad that Jason does in his.
"We're a fairly strong team with
three solid players," said Christy.
The women's team had a tough
match against the Cal Poly women.
The Cardinal led at the end of the
first chukker 4-1, but Cal Poly
managed to pull out the win with
some controversial play. "The
umpires were very lax [in calling
fouls]," Ilia said. "There were an
unusual number of fouls that
weren't called, and the game got to
be pretty rough."
The women's team, consisting
of Christy, her freshman sister
Alexa and senior Suejin Hwang,
prides itself on good teamwork and
clean play. However, this has not
translated into victories thus far.

The women's team placed sec
ond in the regionals last year and
should do well again this year.
"The umpires at regionals are bet
ter at their jobs," Ilia explained.
The little-publicized polo teams
are tight-knit and hard-working.
"We're like a big family," Knight
said.
Wes Linfoot coaches both the
men's and women's teams. The
two teams practice together and
use the same horses. People inter
ested in playing are invited to look
into Stanford Polo. "We're always
looking for new people," Knight
said. "You can learn to play the
game here."
While teams on the East Coast
have varsity status and recruit the
best high school players, many on
Stanford's team join with little
polo or riding experience. The Polo
Club meets eveiy Tuesday at 8
p.m. in Roble Gym. The teams will
play again next weekend, at a tour
nament in Modesto, Calif.
