# Ultimate to host Invite
## 
### Jason Weintraub Contributing writer 
You may have noticed the 23
women and 44 men with great
winter tans walking around Stan
ford last week. Many still have
sand in unmentionable places and
might give you some if you ask.
They are the proud members of
the Stanford Ultimate teams.
In the eighth Kaimana Klassik
Tournament, held in Waikiki,
Hawaii earlier this month, Team
Bloodthirsty surpassed all expec
tations en route to a second-place
finish, losing in the final game to
Necter Haagen, a team comprised
of men wearing women's clothes.
"They were all wearing lingerie —
I thought I was being skied by a
woman until I noticed his chest
hair," said senior Jay "Kefir"
Clyne.
The Stanford men had a rough
road to the finals. They battled
only club teams, facing some play
ers with more than 10 years of
experience. In the semifinals,
they defeated a team of Stanford

"Old-timate" Alumni in what
became a rematch of the classic
battle between apprentice Mickey
and the Sorcerer.
Bloodthirsty Ultimate is com
ing off one of its strongest years
to date. Last season, the team
marched through sectionals,
regionals and nationals, narrowly
losing in the national champi
onship game. Expectations of a
rebuilding year faded as a crop of
rookies stepped in to make Stan
ford the team to beat on the West
Coast.
"All my life, I've hunted with a
boomerang," said rookie sensa
tion Peter "Dundee" Jewett.
"Ultimate came naturally to me."
The women also had unprece
dented success, advancing to the
semifinals of the Kaimana Klas
sik. Competing against teams
loaded with wily and experienced
veterans, Superfly — the name of
the women's team — took advan
tage of their driving speed and
youthful endurance to "whirl"
the unexpecting peas. Aside from
the hot "D" and chilly "O," the
sweet spirit emitted by the tran
sients and other worldly creatures
in attendance is what lifted their
play to a new karmic level.
Despite brief interludes of near
monsoon conditions, Superfly
overcame pelting rain and mucus
mud to upset the highly touted
Sundried Tomatoes. With new
found confidence earned in Hawaii,
the Stanford women are eager to
test their powers against the
hottest collegiate teams in the
country in future competition.
"We are family," says hot rover
Julie "Shoepicker" Chen. "Yay lay
out! Yay spirit! Yay defense! Yay
Superfly! Sch waaaaaaaaanaa h!"
This weekend, March 4 and 5,
three-time defending champion
Stanford hosts its own invitational
tournament at the intramural

fields. Likely to be the largest West
Coast event this year, the Stanford
Invitational boasts a 30 team field,
including 12 women's teams, sev
eral of which are out-of-state par
ticipants. Pool play begins Satur
day morning and continues until
dusk. The bloody elimination
rounds commence in the early
hours on Sunday.
Commenting on the large num
ber of East Coast teams traveling
into the lion's den that is Stanford
Ultimate, tan sophomore Cabral
"Thunder Urchin" Bonner said,
"Traveling 3000 miles just to play
Ultimate and to get bludgeoned
like a hapless curmudgeon — I
think that's ridiculous!"
Despite the absence of a rowdy
"Sixth Man Club" clustered
around the center cone, the team
encourages the loyal Stanford
faithful to witness Stanford's
fiercest carnage yet this season.
"We're trying to print up some
'Eighth Man' T-shirts for the die
hards," said senior co-captain Jesse
Roach.
