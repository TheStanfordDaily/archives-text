# Ultimate to host Invite

You may have noticed the 23
women and 44 men with great
winter tans walking around Stan
ford last week. Many still have
sand in unmentionable places and
might give you some if you ask.
They are the proud members of
the Stanford Ultimate teams.
In the eighth Kaimana Klassik
Tournament, held in Waikiki,
Hawaii earlier this month, Team
Bloodthirsty surpassed all expec
tations en route to a second-place
finish, losing in the final game to
Necter Haagen, a team comprised
of men wearing women's clothes.
"They were all wearing lingerie —
I thought I was being skied by a
woman until I noticed his chest
hair," said senior Jay "Kefir"
Clyne.
The Stanford men had a rough
road to the finals. They battled
only club teams, facing some play
ers with more than 10 years of
experience. In the semifinals,
they defeated a team of Stanford

"Old-timate" Alumni in what
became a rematch of the classic
battle between apprentice Mickey
and the Sorcerer.
Bloodthirsty Ultimate is com
ing off one of its strongest years
to date. Last season, the team
marched through sectionals,
regionals and nationals, narrowly
losing in the national champi
onship game. Expectations of a
rebuilding year faded as a crop of
rookies stepped in to make Stan
ford the team to beat on the West
Coast.
"All my life, I've hunted with a
boomerang," said rookie sensa
tion Peter "Dundee" Jewett.
"Ultimate came naturally to me."
The women also had unprece
dented success, advancing to the
semifinals of the Kaimana Klas
sik. Competing against teams
loaded with wily and experienced
veterans, Superfly — the name of
the women's team — took advan
tage of their driving speed and
youthful endurance to "whirl"
