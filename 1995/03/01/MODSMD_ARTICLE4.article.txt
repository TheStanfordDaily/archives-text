# Sweatshirt rule suspended....
## Senate reallocates Pub Board space 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate voted unani
mously last night to approve space
reallocations for the Publications
Board — finalizing an issue which
has been debated since November
— in a meeting which also saw the
suspension of the senate's contro
versial sweatshirt rule.
The Pub Board bill effectively
decreases the number of rooms oc
cupied by the Chaparral from four
to two and a half. The Stanford Re
view receives an extra room and the

Quad retains basically the same
space, said Publications Board Di
rector Danny Bressler.
Furthermore, the Chaparral has
agreed to subsidize the moving
costs of the Quad and the Stanford
Directory. Former Chaparral edi
tor in chief Barry Parr — who was
vocal in the Chaparral's opposition
to the November space reallocation
proposal — estimated the costs to
be no more than "a couple thou
sand dollars."
"What we are looking to do is to
make sure that the Publications
Board is happy in this case," Pan
said.
The feud began over a 1964
Publications Board rule stating
that student publications receive
space for a period of five years
But five years after the enact
ment of the rule — when the Cha
parral, the Quad and The Daily all
donated money to build the Storke
Publications Building — the policy
was not enforced.
When Bressler tried to invoke
the policy and introduced the real
location bill in November, past and
present staff members of the Cha
parral vigorously opposed the plan
and accused Bressler of abusing his
power. A Council of Presidents-led
drive for Bressler's dismissal ulti
mately failed.
Parr said the bill passed last
night was "substantially what we
put forward to Danny last Novem
ber.
However, Bressler said there are
differences between the two bills.
"The difference is that the Cha
parral alumni [are] going to pay the

full cost of the bill," he said.
The senate postponed a bill
which would give the Publications
Board almost $12,000 out of
reserve funds to pay for computer
equipment and upgrades.
Another short debate ensued
about the infamous "sweatshirt
rule." Senate Chair Nawwar Kas
rawi said he has suspended
enforcement of the constitutional
clause — which states that sena
tors not wearing their sweatshirts
be exempted from voting. A new
bill has been debated in the admin
istration and rules committee for
three weeks.
"I believe it is impossible to
enforce this in a fair and reason
able manner," Kasrawi said. "I am
not enforcing the sweatshirt rule."
Undergraduate senators Ed
Malone and Stephen Russell
opposed the bill on grounds that
fcisrawi was disregarding the con
stitution.
In other senate action, the sen
ate postponed until next week a bill
to create a Graduate Student
Council similar to the class presi
dents it approved last week.
Although a majority of authors
were not present, graduate senator
Mike Bailey praised the bill, saying
that since undergraduates can

have class presidents, "the gradu
ates can do something like that just
as well."
The bill was criticized by both
graduate senator Mark Oppen
heimer Russell as "a waste of
money." Opponents said that if
graduate students cannot bring 10
senators to a senate meeting, there
should be no reason to vote for the
bill.
The senate also approved a mea
sure reorganizing presentation of
special-fee material to students
during the April election.
"It will make the elections hand
book a better handbook," said Elec
tions Commissioner Jonathan
Berent. Currently, he said, there
are "long budgets which no one
looks at. I think we need to make
that clear what the student organi
zations are looking for."
The bill grants the Publications
Board the right to define a student
publication and the hearing officer
the right to define editorial matter.
The bill also limits the extent to
which a group can publish its bud
get in the election handbook. It can
only publish each section and the
individual line-item summaries.
Finally, the bill reduces cam
paign costs for candidates appear
