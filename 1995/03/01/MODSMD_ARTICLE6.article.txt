# Hoover energized by GOP's recent political resurgence
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Contributing writer 
During the 1980s, the Hoover Institution ri
valed Washington think tanks, providing counsel
and advice to President Ronald Reagan and top
administration officials.
But with the passing of the Reagan-Bush era,
it appeared that Hoover was down and out. Bill
Clinton's election seemed to relegate Hoover's
brand of conservative economic and social philos
ophy to the ash-heap of history.
Now, however, Hoover is back with a
vengeance. With the Republican electoral sweep
last November, its scholars and research fellows
are advising government leaders from Calif. Gov.
Pete Wilson to Speaker of the U.S. House of Rep
resentatives Newt Gingrich.
Hoover scholars have provided
ideas for the GOP's "Contract
With America"and balanced-bud
get amendment, and for Wilson's
tax cut and economic recovery pro
grams for the state of California.
Hoover Director John Raisian

called this "an exciting time" at
the institution, adding that the
opportunity to interact with those
charged with implementing public
policy is always welcome.
"We've been doing research on
ideas like those covered in the
'Contract [With America]' for
years," he said.
With the new Republican
majority, he added, Hoover has
experienced a resurgence of activ

ity.
In his annual report to the
Hoover trustees, Raisian said
Hoover fellows are busy advising
the new Republican Congress on
everything from budget matters to
social policy.
For example, Martin Anderson,
a senior Hoover fellow, is one of
the strongest supporters of the
balanced-budget amendment.
Michael Boskin — who was

chair of the Council of Economic
Advisers during the Bush Admin
istration — is advising the Senate
and House Budget Committees
and John Cogan is an adviser for
House Budget Process and Advis
ing Chair John Kasich.
A Feb. 24 article in the San
Francisco Chronicle reported on
signs of Hoover's growing influ
ence in political circles. For exam
ple, House Majority Leader Dick

Armey wears a Hoover tie which
depicts the landmark tower and
complex on a cardinal background.
Raisian said the new visibility
of the institution should not come
as a surprise. Hoover researchers
have been prominent in studying
these ideas for years.
"In no way are we trying to pro
mote the Republican party. In no
way do we take responsibility for
the Republicans coming into

power, nor is it our aim to increase
their power," Raisian said.
Though the majority of people
helped by the institution are con
servative Republicans, Raisian
explained, "We have certain sets of
ideas, and if Democrats or other
groups choose to embrace them,
then that's great," he said.
Hoover wants "to try and make
sure ideas get out on the table for
discussion," he added.
