# Hoover energized by GOP's recent political resurgence

During the 1980s, the Hoover Institution ri
valed Washington think tanks, providing counsel
and advice to President Ronald Reagan and top
administration officials.
But with the passing of the Reagan-Bush era,
it appeared that Hoover was down and out. Bill
Clinton's election seemed to relegate Hoover's
brand of conservative economic and social philos
ophy to the ash-heap of history.
Now, however, Hoover is back with a
vengeance. With the Republican electoral sweep
last November, its scholars and research fellows
are advising government leaders from Calif. Gov.
Pete Wilson to Speaker of the U.S. House of Rep
resentatives Newt Gingrich.
