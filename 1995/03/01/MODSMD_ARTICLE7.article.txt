### Elisabeth Morse Contributing writer 
With the creation of a new committee, the
University may soon follow its own advice on ad
vising
Almost five months after the Commission on
Undergraduate Education recommended exten
sive changes to the University's advising system,
the new Undergraduate Advising Committee is
addressing those concerns.

Provost Condoleezza Rice created the com
mittee last month to address and attempt to im
plement the commission's recommendations for
improving Stanford's advising system.
"Although Stanford is comparable to other
schools in terms of advising, we still feel that we
could make advising better," said Margaret
Brandeau, a committee member and associate
professor of industrial engineering.
The commission's report — which was re
leased last October — offered eight recommen

dations to improve advising, including having
clear-cut relationships between students and
advisers, allotting additional resources to the
Undergraduate Advising Center, strengthening
the peer-advising program, encouraging more
faculty participation in the advising system and
placing emphasis on advising during a student's
sophomore year.
"We basically want to get going on the pro-
gram set out by the [commission]; it
was a whole menu of ideas," said
Norman Naimark, a history profes
sor and resident fellow in Castaho.
The committee will prioritize the
commission's recommendations
and then develop them into specific
proposals. There will be a prelimi
nary report to the Faculty Senate
by the end of the year, according to
Asst. Provost Ann Fletcher, a com
mittee staff member.
"I think some of the recommen
dations will be in place by the begin
ning of next year," Naimark said.

The commission's recommenda
tions "vary in complexity and
involve many different parts of the
University," Fletcher added.
"The recommendations of the
commission were broad-based and
philosophical without making spe
cific suggestions for implementa
tion," said Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Ram6n Saldl
var, the committee's chair.
Adviser-student relations,
sophomore advising and peer advis
ing are "all things [the committee]
is going to work to implement
quickly," Saldlvar said.
"Sophomore advising is a key in
the whole puzzle," he said.
"We hope to create a system that
students are more happv with and

also one in which the advisers and
the [Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter] can do a better job," Brandeau
said.
The advising committee meets
weekly and has already held two
meetings, Naimark said. History
Prof. A 1 Camarillo — the chair of
the commission's subcommittee
which developed the advising rec
ommendations — addressed mem
bers at the first meeting.
Currently, the committee is
gathering additional information
on all aspects of the advising pro
cess.
The committee consists of seven
faculty and staff members; two stu
dent representatives will soon be
added.
