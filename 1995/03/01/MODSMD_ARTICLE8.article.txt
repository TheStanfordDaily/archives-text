# Hugging the trees
## Stanford program plants, protects native oak trees in the Foothills 
### Kyung Lee Contributing writer 
Stephanie Kwee is saving a
tree.
Kwee, a sophomore, is one of
a group of University students
and others who rise from their
beds Saturday mornings and
clamber up the Foothills to
plant new trees, protect living
ones, get an outdoor workout
and just have "a really good
time" talking.
Kwee is part of the Oak Re
generation Project, a program
by the Stanford Planning Office
that plants and maintains na
tive oak trees in Stanford's aca
demic reserve lands near the
Dish.

"The main benefit is that
people are able to work out there
in the hills and see for them
selves how hard it is to restore
the ecosystem," said Joan
Schwan, an assistant on the pro
ject. "They realize that it's easy
to throw a system ofT balance
but that it's hard to get it back."
Between 10 and 50 volun
teers — including Stanford stu
dents, Boy Scout troops and
other local community mem
bers — meet Saturday morn
ings and Thursday afternoons,
said Trevor Taylor, the project
coordinator.
"I walk by those tree seedlings
every day when I walk up to the

Project coordinator Trevor Taylor puts a cage around an oak
seedling in the Foothills to protect It from roaming livestock.
Dish and I was looking for a com
munity service project that I could
get involved with," junior Lisa
Dawe said. "I use the Foothills as
my sanctuary, so I wanted to
make sure they were kept nice."
Taylor said the project is the
only reforestation program in the
vicinity and also the only one
available every weekend, "like
clockwork."
The project began 10 years ago
when some ecologists and biolo
gists discovered a "generation
gap" between the mature trees
and young trees, Taylor said.
During the past decade, volun
teers of the project have planted
approximately 1,500 trees at
Stanford.
"There were almost no trees
younger than 100," he said. "Stan
ford instituted this project in
order to fill this gap."
Taylor said several factors —
like grazing — have helped pro
duce this generation gap among
the oak trees.
"The cows eat the trees," Tay
lor said. "But more importantly,
they mine nutrients. But, because
we later take the cows somewhere

else for human benefits, they can't
cycle back the nutrients into the
sotf."
Taylor added that competing
vegetation in the Foothills hinders
the growth of oak trees and that
rodents also nibble and eat young
trees.
Besides planting new trees, the
project also tries to maintain the
living trees, Taylor explained. "We
water the trees and put out tree
shelters and weed mats," he said
adding that the group also tries to
teach its volunteers about the
ecology of the area.
"I think it's great that they
have ecology lessons up there even
for college kids," Kwee said. "They
don't teach it in a condescending
manner."
The project volunteers said
they do not try to restore the area
to historical accuracy. "We don't
call it the 'restoration project'
because that would imply that
we're making the trees like they
were," explained David Muffly, a
project volunteer. "We don't do
that. I don't think it's possible."
Most volunteers, satisfied with
the program, return after their
first day. Some volunteers return
year after year, Taylor said.
MufTly, one such volunteer, is
now entering his sixth year with
the project.

"I wanted an outdoor activity
on a Saturday that was a workout
for me but at the same time bene
fited other people," Muffly said.
Kwee said that although she
has only volunteered with the
project once, she plans to contin
ue going into the Foothills with
the group each Saturday. "It's a
great cause. The more people who
can go up, the better. It's a great
way for Stanford students to real
ize all the other great things that
are happening on campus," she
said.
The project is affiliated with
Magic, Inc., a non-profit organiza
tion based in the Bay Area that
sponsors other environmental
projects.
One Magic, Inc. project is
Peninsula ReLeaf, a national
organization that helps people
start urban forestry projects,
Schwan said.
Another Magic, Inc. program
called Fruition has helped salvage
nearly 18,000 bare-root fruit trees
and distributed them to school
children and charities, Muffly
said.
"These were trees that would
otherwise have been burned by
their growers. The people take
them home, plant them and get
fruit off of them in a couple
years," he said.

Besides environmental pro
grams, Magic, Inc. also teaches
lifestyle skills, Schwan said. "We
teach people about the ecosystem.
We hold yoga classes and a life
planning workshop," she
explained.
People who want to practice
these skills full-time can join
Magic's eight-member residential
community just outside the Stan
ford campus, Schwan added.
According to Schwan, the pur
pose of the community is to
"emphasize the importance of
health, awareness, cooperation
and environmental steward
ship."
"We base our lives around the
principles of science and ecology.
We continually question and form
hypotheses," Schwan explained.
"We believe in taking care of our
selves, taking care of others and of
the environment."
Muffly said more people would
volunteer for these programs if
they understood the inherent
interdependence between the
environment and human life.
"If people could identify them
selves more with the larger envi
ronment and other people — iden
tify their dependence on the envi
ronment like I had done six years
ago — then they'd come out," he
said.

order to fill this gap."
Taylor said several factors —
like grazing — have helped pro
duce this generation gap among
the oak trees.
"The cows eat the trees," Tay
lor said. "But more importantly,
they mine nutrients. But, because
we later take the cows somewhere

else for human benefits, they can't
cycle back the nutrients into the
sotf."
Taylor added that competing
vegetation in the Foothills hinders
the growth of oak trees and that
rodents also nibble and eat young
trees.
Besides planting new trees, the
project also tries to maintain the
living trees, Taylor explained. "We
water the trees and put out tree
shelters and weed mats," he said
adding that the group also tries to
teach its volunteers about the
ecology of the area.
"I think it's great that they
have ecology lessons up there even
for college kids," Kwee said. "They
don't teach it in a condescending
manner."
The project volunteers said
they do not try to restore the area
to historical accuracy. "We don't
call it the 'restoration project'
because that would imply that
we're making the trees like they
were," explained David Muffly, a
project volunteer. "We don't do
that. I don't think it's possible."
Most volunteers, satisfied with
the program, return after their
first day. Some volunteers return
year after year, Taylor said.
MufTly, one such volunteer, is
now entering his sixth year with
the project.

"I wanted an outdoor activity
on a Saturday that was a workout
for me but at the same time bene
fited other people," Muffly said.
Kwee said that although she
has only volunteered with the
project once, she plans to contin
ue going into the Foothills with
the group each Saturday. "It's a
great cause. The more people who
can go up, the better. It's a great
way for Stanford students to real
ize all the other great things that
are happening on campus," she
said.
The project is affiliated with
Magic, Inc., a non-profit organiza
tion based in the Bay Area that
sponsors other environmental
projects.
One Magic, Inc. project is
Peninsula ReLeaf, a national
organization that helps people
start urban forestry projects,
Schwan said.
Another Magic, Inc. program
called Fruition has helped salvage
nearly 18,000 bare-root fruit trees
and distributed them to school
children and charities, Muffly
said.
"These were trees that would
otherwise have been burned by
their growers. The people take
them home, plant them and get
fruit off of them in a couple
years," he said.

Besides environmental pro
grams, Magic, Inc. also teaches
lifestyle skills, Schwan said. "We
teach people about the ecosystem.
We hold yoga classes and a life
planning workshop," she
explained.
People who want to practice
these skills full-time can join
Magic's eight-member residential
community just outside the Stan
ford campus, Schwan added.
According to Schwan, the pur
pose of the community is to
"emphasize the importance of
health, awareness, cooperation
and environmental steward
ship."
"We base our lives around the
principles of science and ecology.
We continually question and form
hypotheses," Schwan explained.
"We believe in taking care of our
selves, taking care of others and of
the environment."
Muffly said more people would
volunteer for these programs if
they understood the inherent
interdependence between the
environment and human life.
"If people could identify them
selves more with the larger envi
ronment and other people — iden
tify their dependence on the envi
ronment like I had done six years
ago — then they'd come out," he
said.
