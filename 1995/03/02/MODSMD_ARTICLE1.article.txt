# Stanford Fund plan reserves lucrative times for University
## Students get donor-poor months 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Contributing writer 
Although the new Stanford Fund
policy allows student groups to solicit
alumni only between Feb. 1 and July
1, statistics from the Office of Devel
opment show that the best months for
receiving alumni contributions are
December, January, and August — all
months during which students cannot
solicit alumni gifts.
The policy was approved by Presi
dent Gerhard Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice on Tuesday and will
be implemented Sept. 1.
According to the figures for the last
five years, the Office of Development
received on average $26 million a
month during the months included in
the time limit and $44 million during
the months not included.
"Everyone is well aware that in De
cember and January we receive many
gifts," said Jessie Schilling, adminis
tration services manager of the Office
of Development. "In order to receive
credit on taxes, you must give a gift be
fore Dec. 31. January is a big month
because donors wait until the last
minute. In December, money is re
ceived from people who think ahead."
Schilling added that August is also
a big fund-raising month because it is
the end of Stanford's fiscal year.
"Because people like their gift
counted in the totals for Stanford's

next fiscal year, we do get a fair num
ber in August," Schilling said.
April, a month during which stu
dents can solicit alumni, is also a good
month for fund raising, said Director
of the Stanford Fund Nancy Wells, be
cause "people tend to write checks at

tax times."
However, the Development Office
only received approximately $4 mil
lion in gifts in April for the 1993-94 fis
cal year — almost $23 million less
