## Republicans set showdown on balanced budget for Thursday 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Fac
ing likely defeat, Senate Republi
cans set a showdown vote for
today on the balanced-budget
amendment while vowing to
revive the issue at the height of
the 1996 election season if it
fails.
Majority Leader Bob Dole
sharply attacked several Demo
cratic opponents yesterday for
what he called a "stunning flip
flop" on the measure similar to
one they supported a year ago.
Other GOP senators criticized
President Clinton's opposition.
Dole's decision to proceed with
a vote today — two days after he
abruptly postponed it — came
after apparently unsuccessful
attempts to reach a compromise
with wavering Democrats who
could ensure the amendment's
passage. The Democrats said
they would support the measure
only if it specifically spared
Social Security trust funds from
budget cutters.
He conceded that no senator's
vote had been changed, indicat
ing that barring a last-minute
development, the measure would
fall one vote short of the two
thirds majority needed for pas
sage. While saying he remained

open to overtures from
Democrats, Dole added, "We've
done all we can."
That was not enough for the
Democrats, who said Republi
cans were proposing only sepa
rate legislation that would grad
ually protect Social Security
from budget cuts over the next
several years to a decade.
"Republicans are indeed
counting on the use of Social
Security trust fund dollars to buy
down the debt over the next 10
years," said Democratic leader
Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
"It is just fundamentally
wrong to take Social Security
trust fund monies to balance the
budget," said Sen. Kent Conrad,
D-N.D. Added Sen. Byron Dor
gan, also D-N.D.: "This is about
whether we will be honest and
true to our word about creating a
trust fund for future genera
tions."
Rejection of the amendment
would be a blow to Dole and the
new GOP majority in Congress.
But Dole said Republicans may
wind up with a political victory
when the issue re-emerges next
fall. In addition, barring agree
ment by all 100 senators, the
Senate can do nothing else until

it disposes of the amendment.
Democrats weren't the only
ones under pressure from
amendment supporters.
Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon
remained the sole GOP holdout
despite calls from close relatives,
Oregon legislative leaders and
party activists as well as a visit
from Haley Barbour, his party's
national chairman.
"He said a balanced-budget
amendment is a must piece of
legislation for the Republican
Party," the senator said of Bar
bour. Hatfield chairs the Appro
priations Committee, the panel
that would have to make the bud
get cuts if the amendment
becomes part of the Constitution.
The centerpiece of the Repub
lican drive to shrink government
and reduce federal deficits, a sim
ilar amendment cleared the
House in January, the first major
victory of the conservative "Con
tract With America."
Dole delayed the vote for a sec
ond time yesterday when he sent
the Senate home after a session
that lasted only a few, acrimo
nious moments. That was fol
lowed by a day-long series of
meetings over the Social Security
issue.
