MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) â€” Warlord
Mohamed Farrah Aidid's militiamen swept
into the Mogadishu airport yesterday, chas
ing away packs of looters and filling the void
left by a retreating U.N. mission.
American and Italian troops watched
from the nearby dunes while the militiamen
loyal to Aidid, who once carried a $25,000
U.N. price on his head, roared through the
airport gates in stripped-down trucks and
jeeps mounted with heavy weapons.
A Marine sniper shot and killed a Somali
gunman who fired a rocket-propelled
grenade at Marines during a firefight
between two Somali factions, said U.S. mil

itary spokesman Lt. Col. Jerry Broeckert.
The grenade exploded over the Indian
Ocean behind the Marines.
U.S. and Italian forces also fired numer
ous warning shots to keep Somalis from try
ing to breach the razor wire between them.
After the last U.N. peacekeepers left the
airstrip in the morning, hundreds of looters
swarmed over walls and barbed-wire fences
to pick over what remained.
American and Italians troops protecting
the withdrawal of Pakistani peacekeepers
nervously watched the looting. Rifle shots
rang out, most fired by militiamen as they
shooed away looters.
