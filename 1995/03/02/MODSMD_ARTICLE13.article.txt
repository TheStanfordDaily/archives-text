OJ. juror dismissed
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A juror
who stared at a photograph of O.J.
Simpson during a visit to his mansion
was dismissed today and said later the
prosecution has presented a "strong
case."
The juror, who is black, also denied
there was racial tension on the
sequestered panel. He was replaced
by a 38-year-old white woman who

works for the phone company and
once described herself as a "touchy,
feely" kind of person.
Michael Knox, 46, was the fourth
juror dismissed and the change leaves
only eight alternates. Superior Court
Judge Lance Ito gave no reason for
Knox's dimissal, other than to say it
was for a "good cause."
The ethnic balance of the jury
shifts to eight blacks, two whites, one
Hispanic and one juror of mixed race.

There had been reports that Knox
was on the brink of dismissal for
allegedly failing to disclose past
domestic abuse â€” an important issue
in the case since Simpson was alleged
to have abused his ex-wife before she
was slain.
In a live interview with television
reporters at his North Long Beach
home, Knox wouldn't discuss why he
was dismissed, but he did talk about
the case.
