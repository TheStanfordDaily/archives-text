## Post-BFD proposals 
### 
AS THE ASSU prepares to
take another shot at special
fee reform in the spring elec
tion, it seems senators are consid
ering every possible plan except
one that makes the most sense. So
far, the ASSU Senate has come up
with four proposals, all of which
split undergraduates and gradu
ates into separate voting groups.
Last year's "Graduate Student
Tea Party" — which led to gradu
ate students voting down student
groups which they felt they did not
directly benefit from — made it
clear that splitting undergraduate
and graduate votes is a popular
idea. Numerous groups which
were very popular with undergrad
uates, such as Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford,
were denied funding because of
the graduate student revolt.
But all four proposals have two
things in common. If a student
group applies for funding to both

groups, the amount of funding it
receives will depend on the overall
result, and groups must request
one total amount of money from
graduates and undergraduates.
The differences between the pro
posals concern how much funding
a group gets if its request passes
overall but fails one community —
100 percent or 50 percent; or if it
passes one community but fails
overall — 50 percent or none.
A more sensible proposal would
allow student groups to apply for
different amounts of funding from
the different communities. If a
group benefits undergraduates
more than graduates, its fee
request for graduate students
could be substantially lower than
its undergraduate request. And,
these results could be calculated
independently — students would
receive funding from whichever
community or communities
approved their request.
