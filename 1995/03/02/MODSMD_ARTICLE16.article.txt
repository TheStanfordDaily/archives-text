OUR COSTS are very
strange." Therefore, Snap
pie will no longer be offered
in student residences. So observed
Housing and Dining Services'
Operations Manager of Finance
when asked why a bottle of Snap
pie cannot be sold for anything less
than $1.65 in student residences.
At the student-run Terrace Cafe in
the Toyon eating clubs, a bottle
will run you $1.11.
Time and again, Dining Services
demonstrates and admits obscene
inefficiencies in operations that
would kill a similar business in the
marketplace and that should not be
tolerated in a university that pro
fesses to care about its students'
financial situation. Provost Con
doleezza Rice should undertake a
review of Dining Services to identi
fy what could be done to improve
efficiency in the organization.
Rice has shown remarkable
strength in making some tough
decisions to improve the Universi

ty's financial situation. Several
units of the University have been
subjected to severe budget scruti
ny in recent years.
For example, Stanford Publica
tion Services and the Copy Centers
were dissolved in favor of an out
side company that can provide effi
cient, competitively-priced ser
vices. While this is hardly good
news for the employees of the dis
solved units, it should hold down
the costs paid by the other parts of
the University that use the ser
vices.
The same sort of questions need
to be asked of Dining Services. A
more efficient organization could
provide higher revenue to the Uni
versity and lower costs to stu
dents.
Losing a daily fix of kiwi straw
berry cocktail is a minor issue; los
ing significant portions of stu
dents' board bills and of the Uni
versity's revenue to the inefficien
cy of Dining Services is not.
