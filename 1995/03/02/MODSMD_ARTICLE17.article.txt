The Thinker still contains bias at 'deep structure 9 level

IMUST COMMEND Nick Thompson
and Ryan Bounds in their efforts as
publishers of the Thinker to "look
journalistic bias straight in the face."
But I am concerned that in their own
individual efforts to do so, their publica
tion will only deal with bias at the "sur
face level" and hence never confront bias
on a "deep structure" level. In short, the
publication will remain just as biased as
the publications it strives not to mimic.
The Thinker as it now stands will not
be impartial or unbiased. This stems
from the approach the publication is tak
ing to be unbiased — the format of pre
senting two sides of em issue. What the
editors of the publication fail to realize is
that this supposedly unbiased approach
is culturally biased. The process of
dichotomizing the world into either/or
propositions (between the polarizing

views of the liberal and the conservative
on which their "bipartisan" publication
focuses) is a characteristic of Western
positivist thinking. Therefore, their
approach undermines their mission. As
Editor in Chief Ryan Bounds has said,
"You get both sides." Unfortunately,
this statement implies that there are
only two sides to any debate, at least
only two sides worth mentioning. Where
are the other sides and the other voices?
The bottom line is there are many sides
to an issue. The Thinker's idea of debate
and its form is defined in such narrow
terms that it excludes certain view
points. This is the "deep structure" bias
which their publication does not address.
To borrow from noted communica
tion scholar Stuart Hall, we must look
at the "politics of representation." That
is to say, we must understand that there

are certain views which, for example,
are validated on such shows as "Cross
fire" or the "MacNeil/Lehrer New
s Hour" and others that have been sys
tematically ignored and will never
appear on any of these programs. It is
likely that if either of the above shows
were to discuss abortion they would
invite the two most celebrated view
points currently dominating the scene
— pro-choice and pro-life. But what
about those people in the middle? Has
anyone considered that there may actu
ally be more than two sides to this
issue? It becomes obvious, then, that
there are some people and beliefs which,
as Stanford communication Prof.
Theodore Glasser explains, "are always
in the frame and others who are in the
margin of the frame" — excluded from
the realm of representation in the

media.
On a surface level, the Thinker deals
with bias beautifully. The "balance"
which the publication seeks to achieve is,
at first glance, accomplished by the fact
that two sides are being presented. And
for the average reader, the format of the
paper (liberal view on the left side of the
page and the conservative view on the
right) reinforces this idea. But if the
intent of their paper is to be completely
unbiased (with its motto of "For every
issue, there is another side; think about
it"), then a look at the assumptions it
operates on — its "deep structure" — is
necessary. Until then, its motto should
be "For every issue, there are many
sides; here are two."
