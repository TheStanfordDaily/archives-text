# Sarcastic letter about the Muslim group did not carry accusations
## 
### 
My letter in The Daily on Tuesday,
Feb. 28, has generated much personal
and public response, so I feel it must be
clarified. It was an intentionally cynical
and sarcastic letter ridiculing the group
behind Monday's ad, whose idea of
awareness and fighting for peace and jus
tice is the publication of a hateful and
extremely biased ad. My letter should be
read as such.
Those who read into it a racist accusa
tion against all Muslims or an attempt to
imply that most Muslims support terror
ist activities have misread it. The Daily's
choice of headline, implicating all Mus
lims, may have contributed to that. Nev
ertheless, I apologize to those Muslims

who felt it carried such accusations. I do
not believe such accusations would be
justified, or that a person should be held
responsible for acts of other members of
his or her faith, color, et cetera. There
fore, I had no intentions of targeting
anyone besides the group behind the ad.
