# The 						Daily's special fee request should he split into separate sections
## 
### 
I was rather disappointed when I read
yesterday's coverage of the debate on the
special fee for The Stanford Daily. I do
not believe that the article accurately
represented my argument for splitting
The Daily's fee request into two compo
nents. The primary point I addressed

(repeatedly) during the debate was that
the salaries are approximately $310,000,
which far exceeds the total subsidy from
the special fee ($44,404). The ASSU Sen
ate has a long tradition of not funding
salaries through special fees. It was on
this principle that I argued for dividing
the special fee into two components —
campus distribution and student
salaries.
I accept and can support the claim that
the student body may have an interest in
subsidizing campus distribution of the
paper — it facilitates campus-wide com
munication and awareness of issues. I
believe most students support subsidizing
this aspect of The Daily's cost, which is
budgeted for $22,404 next year. I do not
think that most students understand the
extent to which student salaries dwarf
this expense and the total subsidy
amount. The purpose of dividing the fee
request in two would be both to highlight
this information and to let the students

choose, which is, after all, the point of an
election. If the students believe that the
full special fee request is justified, then
they could vote for both components. If,
however, students vote for The Daily pri
marily because they believe that they are
subsidizing campus distribution, they
might choose to vote for just that compo
nent.
The information included (and not
included) in the article indicates, I believe,
a selective reporting of facts. Two budget
components hardly mentioned in the
debate ($284,000 for printing and
$180,000 for ASSU TVpe & Design) were
specifically mentioned by dollar amount in
the article. The two budget components
that were the primary source of debate
($310,000 for student salaries and $22,404
for campus distribution) were mentioned
only by reference and nowhere in the arti
cle did the actual budget figures appear.
