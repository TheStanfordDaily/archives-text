# Some students fear
## loss of speech code Many see no effect, others sense danger 
### Molly Stephens Contributing writer 
Students and cultural organizations dis
agreed about the impact Tuesday's speech
code decision will have on minority life and
free speech at Stanford.
Resolving a suit launched against the
University by nine students last May, the
Santa Clara County Superior Court de
clared the Grey Interpretation of the Fun
damental Standard unconstitutional be
cause it restricted more than just hate
speech.
The code was first enacted after a 1988
incident in Ujamaa, the African-American
theme house, when two freshmen defaced a
poster of Beethoven by giving it stereotypi
cal black features. A poster with the word
"Niggers" scrawled across it was also found
in the house.
Some students and administrators ex
pressed disappointment with the decision
â€” fearing that minority students will now
feel more vulnerable to harassment.
"I think all students at Stanford may
feel that they are in more danger of being
harassed and vilified." said Blair Bowman,
interim director of the Black Community
Services Center.
Bowman also expressed "some appre
hension that harassment will increase."
"I think it is important to encourage the
University to appeal the decision," he said.

"The Grey Interpretation falls well within
the scope of the Fundamental Standard,
and Stanford should defend the Funda
mental Standard as a private school."
Bowman added that he expects minority
students will press Stanford to appeal the
decision and emphasized that the Grey In
terpretation is very narrow and affects only
a small category of speech.
"At this point, students most likely feel
less protected," said Steve Gonzalez, law
student and a member of Stanford's les
bian, gay and bisexual community.
Gonzalez was "shocked" at the decision
and felt that the University should appeal if
it felt it could win in a higher court.
"I think the debate is a competition be
tween the right of free speech and the right
of all students to pursue education in an at
mosphere free of harassment," Gonzalez
said. "The code supports the equally impor
tant right to advanced education. It's sad
that [the plaintiffs] do not recognize this in
terest."
Gonzalez said he believes that the prob
lem with the Grey Interpretation is that it
is not broad enough.
"I think students might feel uncomfort
able about the implications of not having an
enforcement mechanism [for harass
ment]," said Esther Chun of the Asian
American Students Association.
"Every freedom in political
society is limited," Chun said.
Other students and adminis
trators said they felt the decision
Bymbolizes the nation's emerg
ing conservative tide.
"The climate in the country is
becoming more conservative,"
said Frances Morales, director of
El Centro Chicano. "[The deci
sion! can be seen as one less pro
tection."
Morales also said she is uncer
tain if the speech code is the best
method to deal with harassment,
adding that the code was not
widely discussed and many stu
dents were unaware they could
have used it to solve conflicts.
"We need much more than the
code," said Felipe Barragan, co
chair of MEChA, a
Chicano / Latino student group.
"The way to better deal with
issues is through education."
Barragan added that he does
not think Stanford should pur

sue an appeal since it would tie
up time, energy and resources
that could be used to develop
more tangible solutions to
harassment.
Denni Woodward, program
coordinator for the American
Indian Program Office, agreed
that preventing harassment has
more to do with education.
"I think we have a long way to
go in making people aware of
other people's cultures," she said.
Other administrators said the
decision will have no impact.
"It seems to me that the issue
of freedom of speech is a side
track," said Chris Clarke of El
Centro Chicano. "I don't think
the code kept people from engag
ing in debate."
Others echoed that the deci
sion will have little effect.
"[The Stanford Review] does
not feel any more free than
before," said Aman Verjee, for
mer editor in chief of The Review.
"What holds us back is not the
fear of prosecution, but respect
and knowledge that our argu
ments are the strongest without
epithets," Verjee said.
