## Boxing your brains out 
### 
SOMEWHERE across this country,
in Anytown, USA, little Billy is
lying in an intensive care bed, in a
coma. Could have been a bike accident
or a car crash — or maybe he got his
hands on the Drano. Either way, he
didn't bargain for brain damage. Most
people don't.
Unless you're a boxer.
Halfway around the world in Lon
don, Gerald McClellan is lying in a sim
ilar ward, hooked up to a life-support
machine. Could have been an accident
or a crash. As it turns out, McClellan
stayed in the ring for one round too
many.
With every punch, his brain slammed
against his skull, moving closer and
closer to permanent damage. And
although the medics were quickly by his
side when he started reeling, today he's
not in good shape.
And the rallying cry to ban the sport
has gone up.
Behold, the evolution of entertain
ment and sport and violence. It's remi
niscent of the gladiators; one guy
smashing and punching the other until
he won't get up anymore. Or until he's
whisked away to the neurosurgeon.
If, for McClellan, boxing was his joy,
his escape, his pride, then it's awfully
moralistic to ban someone's life. But
since it's unclear whether he'll have
any more life at all, I start to wonder if
the sacrifice was really worth it. Whoev

er bet thousands on his winning thinks
so.
Used until the end.
Now, certainly there are other sports
that fall into the category of dangerous
or dumb. Regardless of fun. Football's
not exactly ballet. Skiing is an accident
waiting to happen. But no one is rush
ing off to ban the Super Bowl or the
next giant slalom.
And running is a little suspect.
Wasn't that the part of practice that we
all hated? Where the coach said,
"Another one under 30 or we'll start
again!" I don't like all that bouncing,
but I can respect people who do. Still,
we're not talking about a high percent
age of brain damage or death. There's
something inherently more civil about
sprinting side by side than banging into
someone's face with your fist.
Boxing may have its merits. I've
heard it's entertaining. And there's
virtue in it's accessibility. You just need
a bag or a body to pound. No fancy
equipment or expensive club member
ships. No need to drop a couple thou
sand dollars for those Rossignol skis
and Solomon boots.
But there must be accessible sports
where the odds of spinning that wheel
and landing on brain damage aren't in
your favor. Vanna, I'd take a vowel.
And in an ominous twist at the
McClellan event, one of the wounded
watched ringside from his wheelchair.

Foreshadowing McClellan's fate. In a
sport where, over the past 30 years or
so, at least 23 boxers have died after a
pummeling in the ring, and where
countless others have been permanent
ly maimed, the question of banning it
may not be out there. At all.
It's not to say that people won't box
— most likely they will. Rather, it
speaks more to the idea of ending an
industry that uses people who are will
ing to have their brains turned into jello
for money. And that may not be so
wrong.
Still, I don't know if eliminating the
sport is the answer. Banning anything
reminds me of Hitler Youth and ban
ning books and then before you know it
they're banning people. . . . It'd be nice
if boxing just quietly faded away. Due to
a shift in the supply and demand curve
or something. Or a strike.
Odds are, it won't just disappear.
Even with another victim.
But who am I to talk about brain
damage. I don't want to end up like lit
tle Billy or George, but you don't see me
wearing a bike helmet.

Julie changed her mind and is going to
get a bike helmet, partly because she's a
coterm (read: grad student). Look for
her — she's the tool in the red one.
