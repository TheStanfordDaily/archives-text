In spite of statements, Israel is complacent about settler violence

IN THEIR letter of Feb. 28, Noam
Livnat and Gil Rabinovici accuse
Rebecca Stein of resorting to "half
truths, innuendoes and misleading
claims" in her letter of Feb. 24. Yet
they fail to address her evidence, coun
tering with a "half truth" of their own.
They claim that since 1992, Yitzhak
Rabin has "consistently and relentless
ly sought a territorial compromise with
the Palestinians." On the contrary,
since taking office, Rabin's government
has seized 27,500 additional acres of
Palestinian territory an, in violation of
the Oslo agreement, refuses to with
draw any Israeli troops from the occu
pied territories so that Palestinian elec
tions can take place. Indeed, before the
Labor government came to power,

Israel had confiscated 68 percent of the
West Bank for Jewish settlements and
state interests, and today refuses to
dismantle any of these settlements or
negotiate a redistribution of land in the
interim period. This can hardly be
termed "relentless compromise."
Livnat and Rabinovici called Baruch
Goldstein's killing of 29 Palestinians
last year at the Ibrahimi mosque "the
tragic and isolated act of a madman."
Tragic yes, isolated no. In fact, Israeli
and Palestinian human rights organiza
tions have documented numerous cases
of settler violence against neighboring
Palestinian communities, ranging from
destruction of property to murderous
shootings. As Stein documented in her
letter, settlers have killed at least 100

Palestinians since 1988, yet only one of
these cases resulted in a murder con
viction.
Livnat and Rabinovici credit Rabin
with a "massive crackdown" on mem
bers of the militant Jewish under
ground. In fact, since the Hebron mas
sacre last year and despite the scores of
unprovoked attacks by military set
tlers, the Israeli government has
arrested fewer than a dozen Jewish
extremists, most of whom were
released shortly thereafter. Meanwhile,
more than 7,000 Palestinians remain in
Israeli prisons despite the terms of the
Oslo accords.
Even the Israeli appointed commis
sion to investigate the Hebron massacre
concluded that the army had not ade-

quately provided for Palestinian securi
ty in deference to the settler population.
In the course of the commission's hear
ings, Israeli officers testified that army
policy expressly forbids soldiers from
firing on settlers, even when Palestini
an lives are in danger. Despite such
findings, the commission failed to effect
a change in army shooting orders. As
Stein suggested, the government's
refusal to actively intervene in settler
attacks is an act of violent complicity.
By representing Goldstein as a lone
"madman," Livnat and Rabinovici
erase the history of state complicity
which has facilitated the violence of the
militant settler population.
The Daily edited a crucial line below
Stein's name which designated her as a

spokesperson for Stanford Middle East
Focus. This effacement, in which the
politics of an organization were reduced
to those of an individual, misrepresent
ed the significance of this critique of
Israeli policy. We agree, as Livnat and
Rabinovici suggest, that "Israel has
continuously stated its commitment to
the peace process." Unfortunately,
Israel's actions belie its statements.
