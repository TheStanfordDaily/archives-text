## Beavers will try to play basketball spoiler tonight No. 20 men poised for Pac-10 stretch 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Some college basketball teams call it crunch time.
Others refer to it as the home stretch. But with four
games left in the regular season, Stanford men's
basketball head coach Mike Montgomery sees it as
the season within the season.
"We're down to two weeks left in the season,"
Montgomery said. "We know what the job is. I'm
approaching it from the standpoint, 'Look let's just
take this last two weeks, separate it out. Let's get
after it.'
"This is two weeks. Let's try to play our best bas
ketball, not worry about anybody else. Just play our
best basketball. Instead of looking at it as, 'It's been
four and a half months.' Let's look at it as two
weeks and four games," he continued.
Game number one for the Cardinal (17-6 overall,
8-6 in the Pacific 10 Conference) is up in Corvallis
against the Beavers (6-17, 3-11 in the Pac-10), a
team which boasts some fine individual talent but
not much else; Oregon State has lost its last six
games.
In the earlier meeting between the two clubs in
Maples Pavilion, spectators were treated to some of
the Beavers' singular glory as Oregon State forward
Brent Barry scored 28 points and made five of seven
three-pointers.
"Oregon State played us tough here," Mont
gomery said. "They executed real well. And certain
ly we've played against Barry long enough to know
that he can hurt you."
Nevertheless, the Beavers stdl crumbled under
Stanford's tough play, 95-82. The Cardinal was led
by freshman center Tim Young's 17 points and 13
rebounds as well as sophomore point guard Brevin
Knight's 23 points and 10 assists. Senior swingman
David Harbour also had an excellent game con
tributing 23 points off the bench and putting the
clamps on Barry in the latter portions of the game
with some tough defense.
