# L.T.-a-mania?
## Stay with blitzing 
### 
Taking up acting after retire
ment isn't so bad, but
Lawrence Taylor in Wrestle
mania? Come on L.T.. ..
Once More to the
Pool: For the members
of the Class of '95 on
the women's swim squad, one
more challenge remains. The
seniors, led by 19-time Ail-
American Jenny Thompson,
have been victorious in 27

dual meets, four Pacific 10
Championship meets and
three NCAA Championships
since arriving on the Farm.
After wrapping up the confer
ence title last week, only the
upcoming NCAAs March 16-
18 in Austin, Texas, stand in
the way of a perfect four
years.
Add Water: The men's
swim team isn't far behind
the women as far as successes
go, racking up a 30-2 record in
dual-meet competition over
the past four seasons. The
Cardinal will begin its quest
for an unprecedented 14th
consecutive Pac-10 title today
in Long Beach, and will seek a
fourth national championship

March 23-25 in Indianapolis.
Between women's and men's
swimming and water polo, Stan
ford has won six consecutive
NCAA championships in aquatic
sports.
The Best is Out West: It
doesn't feel right. The UCLA Bru
ins completed the climb to the No.
1 ranking in men's basketball, but
it sure looks different seeing a
Pac-10 team atop the polls. Not a
team from the the Big East, or the
ACC, or the Big Ten. Are the Bru
ins really the best team in the
land? Possibly — but time (specif
ically tournament time) will tell.
Sorry, UCLA, but winning big
over Duke isn't enough to con
vince me this season.
Sixth Cents: Just my two
cents. ... The Sixth Man Club
obviously provides a boost to the
Cardinal men's basketball team,
as evidenced by a letter to The
Daily from Bart Lammersen and
Andy Poppink earlier this week.
The noise and energy provided by
these fans make it extremely
tough for opposing teams to come
to Maples and leave town with an
easy win. I realize that it is hard to
accept people waltzing in just

before game time and getting the
best seats — I don't even bother
going to the big games because I
don't have time to wait in line
from about 6 p.m. — but it's about
time the basketball team got this
type of loyal support. Obviously,
schools such as Duke, Michigan,
Indiana and such have a much
stronger basketball tradition than
Stanford — but those places are
filled with crazy, rowdy fans.
Maples is a small, cozy arena —
we should fill the whole place and
all the fans together should make
the rafters rattle.
Titans on Top: The once top
ranked Cardinal baseball squad
(11-8) is struggling, both on the
mound and at the plate, losing big
to Pacific Tuesday. Without a few
clutch ninth-inning rallies, Stan
ford would be much further down
in the polls than its current No.
12 seat in the Baseball America
rankings. As long as the Cardinal
isn't in the top spot, though, I was
pleased to see my hometown
team, Cal State-Fullerton in the
No. 1 position. The Titans
couldn't keep their football pro
gram and are always mired at the
bottom of the Big West in hoops,
but come springtime, baseball is
all that matters in this hardball
hotbed.
Stripped! Now that I don't
subscribe to Sports Illustrated

anymore (getting a weekly maga
zine a week late defeats the pur
pose, doesn't it?), I didn't receive a
copy of the annual swimsuit issue.
If you missed it, too, you can prob
ably find it in Green Current Peri
odicals, but don't go looking for
any swimsuit spectaculars from
years past. They aren't there.
While doing research (on baseball
salaries — not bikini fashions),
combing through bound volumes
of SI, I found that the covers and
layouts of the always controver
sial swimsuit issues have been
removed from the magazines.
Maybe that explains the lack of a
roving masturbator in Green
Library this year.
Lights Out: If you were anx
iously awaiting night baseball at
Sunken Diamond, you'll have to
wait a little bit longer. It was
announced yesterday that tomor
row's contest against Cal, origi
nally scheduled to be the first
game played under the new lights,
has been moved to 2 p.m. Negotia
tions between the university and
the city of Palo Alto are continu
ing.

Kyle's 1M basketball season was
cut short due to injury. Final
statistics: three games, a couple of
assists, one rebound, two traveling
violations, a few fouls and zero
points. Rough year.
