Taking up acting after retire
ment isn't so bad, but
Lawrence Taylor in Wrestle
mania? Come on L.T.. ..
Once More to the
Pool: For the members
of the Class of '95 on
the women's swim squad, one
more challenge remains. The
seniors, led by 19-time Ail-
American Jenny Thompson,
have been victorious in 27

dual meets, four Pacific 10
Championship meets and
three NCAA Championships
since arriving on the Farm.
After wrapping up the confer
ence title last week, only the
upcoming NCAAs March 16-
18 in Austin, Texas, stand in
the way of a perfect four
years.
Add Water: The men's
swim team isn't far behind
the women as far as successes
go, racking up a 30-2 record in
dual-meet competition over
the past four seasons. The
Cardinal will begin its quest
for an unprecedented 14th
consecutive Pac-10 title today
in Long Beach, and will seek a
fourth national championship
