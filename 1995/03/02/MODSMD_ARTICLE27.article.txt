The No. 1-ranked Stanford
men's tennis team (12-0) will

week's National Team Indoor
Championships, winning just
four of nine doubles matches. As

Ricky Becker.
Despite Stanford's recent set
backs, all three of its entries into
this weekend's tourney received

Scott Humphries and Paul Gold
stein have been awarded a No. 1
seed by the event's organizers;
the 24th-ranked tandem of Jim
Thomas and Becker have been
seeded No. 8 and the 30th-ranked
