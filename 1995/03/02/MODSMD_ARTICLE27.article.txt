# Men's netters seek to wreak double trouble
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
The No. 1-ranked Stanford
men's tennis team (12-0) will
send its three starting doubles
teams to the Pacific Coast Men's
Doubles Championships this
weekend.
The 105-year-old tournament
consisting of 32 tandems, mostly
collegiate, will take place at the
La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club
in La Jolla, Calif.
But expect Stanford head
coach Dick Gould to limit the
amount of time allocated to his
players for hitting the La Jolla
beachline. The only things the
Cardinal doubles team will be hit
ting are tennis balls, and the only
lines they'll see are baselines.
"We have some work to do,"
Gould said.
Stanford's doubles teams do

indeed need to work on their
games. They struggled during last
week's National Team Indoor
Championships, winning just
four of nine doubles matches. As
a result, the Cardinal lost the
doubles point in dual matches
against No. 8 Mississippi and No.
4 UCLA.
"This will be a good tourna
ment for us because we have been
struggling in doubles," said junior
Ricky Becker.
Despite Stanford's recent set
backs, all three of its entries into
this weekend's tourney received
seedings. The 18th-ranked duo of
Scott Humphries and Paul Gold
stein have been awarded a No. 1
seed by the event's organizers;
the 24th-ranked tandem of Jim
Thomas and Becker have been
seeded No. 8 and the 30th-ranked
team of junior Jeff Salzenstein
and sophomore Grant Elliott
received a No. 10 seed.
Some of the Cardinal's stiffest
competition should come from the
contingents sent by UCLA, No. 5
Pepperdine, No. 7 USC and No.
19 California.
Humphries and Goldstein are
likely to meet Cal's No. 2 duo of
Casey Louie and David Melmed
on Saturday. Should the Stanford
freshmen advance, they would
probably take on USC's No. 1
doubles team of Brett Hansen and
Fernando Samayor in the quar
terfinals to be held later that day.
Salzenstein and Elliott are in

the same half of the draw as
Humphries and Goldstein, but
the two teams could only meet if
both advance to the semifinals.
In the other half of the draw,
Thomas and Becker would likely
have to get past a pair of second
seeded Australians, Troy Budgin
and Brad Sceney, in the quarterfi
nal match. If the two Stanford
juniors were to advance, they
could conceivably meet any of
three top Pac-10 rivals in the
semifinals: UCLA's No. 1 team of
Robert Janacek and Eric Lin,
USC'B No. 2 duo of Lukas Hovor
ka and Adam Peterson, or Cal's
No. 1 duo of Michael Hill and
Bobby Mahal, which defeated
Goldstein and Humphries 8-5 on
Feb. 18.
Action will begin Friday and
conclude on Sunday.
