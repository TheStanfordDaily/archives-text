Revenge.
With four games remaining on
its regular season schedule, the
Stanford women's basketball
team can accomplish two impor
tant goals tonight. The team can
take back the Pacific 10 Confer
ence crown and avenge its lone
conference loss this season, all in
one fell swoop.
The last time the No. 5 Cardi
nal (22-2 overall, 13-1 in the Pac
-10) played Oregon State (now
ranked 19th), the Beavers con
stantly gnawed at the Stanford
lead and eventually toppled the
Cardinal, 78-73.
"This is the first time we have
been in this situation," coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "We're
able to play a team that we lost to
this season. They embarrassed us
on TV."
Throughout that game, Stan
ford led numerous times only to
fall in the waning minutes of the
game. Sophomore Kate Starbird
and senior Anita Kaplan, the two
leading scorers for the team and
often the spark plugs to the Car
dinal offense, both fouled out late
in the contest. Starbird had
scored 22 points while Kaplan,
the current Pac-10 Player of the
Week, added 17.
"We had a lead and we lost it,
as well as our poise," VanDerveer
said. "We need to adjust to the
officiating. Obviously you'd like
to improve on your performance."
One of the major areas where
VanDerveer would like to see
improvement is the defense.
While the Cardinal "D" has gen

erally been stifling, Beaver play
ers Tanja Kostic and Anjanette
Dionne, both juniors, and Tina
Lelas, a sophomore, found
enough holes to lead Oregon
State to the victory. Kostic, an
All-Pac-10 player last year, scored
16 points and grabbed a team
leading eight rebounds while
Lelas lit up the Cardinal for a
career-high 25 points. Dionne

also scored in double digits with
13 points, stealing the ball four
times.
"They have an excellent team
and a talented starting lineup,"
VanDerveer said.
Offensively, Stanford was
stymied by the Beaver zone. The
Cardinal shot only 39.4 percent
