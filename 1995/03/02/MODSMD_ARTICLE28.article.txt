# Women aim to avenge loss to OSU
## 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
Revenge.
With four games remaining on
its regular season schedule, the
Stanford women's basketball
team can accomplish two impor
tant goals tonight. The team can
take back the Pacific 10 Confer
ence crown and avenge its lone
conference loss this season, all in
one fell swoop.
The last time the No. 5 Cardi
nal (22-2 overall, 13-1 in the Pac
-10) played Oregon State (now
ranked 19th), the Beavers con
stantly gnawed at the Stanford
lead and eventually toppled the
Cardinal, 78-73.
"This is the first time we have
been in this situation," coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "We're
able to play a team that we lost to
this season. They embarrassed us
on TV."
Throughout that game, Stan
ford led numerous times only to
fall in the waning minutes of the
game. Sophomore Kate Starbird
and senior Anita Kaplan, the two
leading scorers for the team and
often the spark plugs to the Car
dinal offense, both fouled out late
in the contest. Starbird had
scored 22 points while Kaplan,
the current Pac-10 Player of the
Week, added 17.
"We had a lead and we lost it,
as well as our poise," VanDerveer
said. "We need to adjust to the
officiating. Obviously you'd like
to improve on your performance."
One of the major areas where
VanDerveer would like to see
improvement is the defense.
While the Cardinal "D" has gen

erally been stifling, Beaver play
ers Tanja Kostic and Anjanette
Dionne, both juniors, and Tina
Lelas, a sophomore, found
enough holes to lead Oregon
State to the victory. Kostic, an
All-Pac-10 player last year, scored
16 points and grabbed a team
leading eight rebounds while
Lelas lit up the Cardinal for a
career-high 25 points. Dionne

also scored in double digits with
13 points, stealing the ball four
times.
"They have an excellent team
and a talented starting lineup,"
VanDerveer said.
Offensively, Stanford was
stymied by the Beaver zone. The
Cardinal shot only 39.4 percent
from the floor — 10 percent
lower than the team average —
and only made four of 18 shots
from behind the arc.
The game was also one of the
rare times when Stanford was
out-rebounded. The Beavers
snared 48 boards while the Cardi
nal managed only 42.
"We did not rebound well,"
VanDerveer said. "We also failed
to execute well against the zone."
Recently, one person off the
Cardinal bench has sparked the
team to victory, whether offen
sively or defensively. Against
UCLA, junior Bobbie Kelsey
played good defense for 22 min
utes to help key the second-half
Stanford explosion. Against USC,
redshirt freshman Vanessa

Nygaard scored a quick eight
points, six on three-pointers, in
the first half to expand the Cardi
nal lead.
"We have a lot of talented
players," VanDerveer said. "If
they do a good job, then I'll play
them. It puts pressure on every
one to do well when someone
comes off the bench and [plays
well]."
A victory tonight would not
just exact a measure of revenge
against Oregon State — it would
also recapture the Pac-10 title
from last year's holder, USC. The
Cardinal are three games up on
the Beavers and Washington
with four games to go on the Pac
-10 schedule; a victory tonight
would clinch a share of the title.
Before last year, Stanford had
won the championship five years
in a row and had started to take
winning for granted. The Cardi
nal did not realize how much the

title meant until they failed to
capture it last year.
"The first year we won the
Pac-10, people I toilet 1 papered my
place," VanDerveer reminisced.
"The next year we were really
happy. . . . The fifth year we won
it, we didn't even get rings. We
expected to win. By not winning,
it made it bigger to our team."
The conference crown also
entitles the champion to visit the
NCAA tournament. While this
year Stanford should make it into
the Big Dance even if it does not
win the Pac-10 title, winning the
rest of the regular season games
should put the Cardinal in line
for a number one seed, or at least
a spot in the West region.
"To me, a one or a two seed are
virtually identical," VanDerveer
said. "A lot depends on how you
finish. We're playing the tough
est part of our schedule. We're
going to be ready to play."
