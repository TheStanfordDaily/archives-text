"I think this is an awesome
team/' said head coach Paula

currently in her first year as an
assistant coach at West Coast
Conference regular-season
champion University of San
Francisco.
Steding places fifth on the
school's all-time scoring list
with 1,586 points. A three-time
All-Pac-10 player and an excel
lent outside shooter at the small
forward slot, Steding was an
alternate on the 1992 U.S.
Olympic team. At 27, she is the
oldest player on the roster.
Whiting is Stanford's all
time top scorer and rebounder
