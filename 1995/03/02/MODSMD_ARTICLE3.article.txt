# The
						cuts hurt less this year: $6M budget trim calm
## 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
Though this year's budget cuts will slash
roughly the same amount from University
budgets as last year's controversial reduc
tions, the current round is proceeding
smoothly, free of the campus-wide uproar
that surrounded last year's cuts.
The University administration is in the
second year of a three-year budget-cutting
initiative aimed at trimming $18 million
from the University's annual budget. Last
year's round of budget cuts drew intense
student protest, as cuts decreased funding
to Student Affairs offices by $1 million and
brought the layoff of widely appreciated
Chicana administrator Cecilia Burciaga.
Campus ethnic centers barely escaped the
budget ax.
This year's round of cuts has not elicited
the same student furor. The target figure

for this year's round of cuts is the same as
last year's final total, $6 million. But this
year's cuts are occurring largely behind the
scenes, out of most students' sight.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said this year's
cuts are drawing less attention in part be
cause they are being made in areas better
suited to a gradual streamlining process,
rather than more sudden, sweeping cuts
like those last year.
"Some areas [such as Student Affairs]
took bigger cuts last year in the University,"
Rice said. "That was very tough. It meant
doing stuff right up front, it meant some
very unpopular layoffs; it meant that things
got done very fast. .. almost in a shock fash
ion.
"Other units have had to move more
slowly," she added. "It has been very vari
able."
Rice said that many administrative units
are working to lower expenses by streamlin

ing various processes, such as decreasing
the paperwork required for procurement
orders or installing new management infor
mation systems to eliminate superfluous
steps.
"It's largely changing a number of
processes that we have," she said.
"You never can count on savings from
that, because you have to reorganize around
the savings," Rice said. "But most people
who have gone through those kinds of ad
ministrative changes find that if you're
careful about it, you can harvest substantial
savings."
The University is also gearing up for
large losses in federal funding as the nation
moves to trim government spending across
the board.
"The Defense Department has funded 50
percent of all national federal funding for
computer science and electrical engineering
research," Rice said. "When you think

about pressure on defense budgets, that has
to have an effect. Why is there pressure on
defense budgets? ... It's because there's
this long-term change called the end of the
Cold War.
"If there really is a sort of national con
sensus that the federal government can't
continue to spend beyond its means, then
something's got to come out of the budget,"
Rice added.
The University's various schools are not
immune to the budget ax either. Rice said
funding to schools this year will not be in
creased to match inflation â€” that is, then
budgets will be effectively decreased.
"Most of them are not seeing inflation,"
she said.
At the same time that the University is
cutting the budgets of its schools and ad
ministrative units, it is also making a few
