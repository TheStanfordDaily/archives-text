# Men's swimming eyes the record books

Excitement.
That's the key work for the Stanford men's
swimmers as they head to Long Beach this
Thursday through Saturday for the Pacific 10
Conference Championships. Every athlete is
excited. Every swimmer has a goal to surpass.
Every man is ready to shine.
After blowing out every Pac-10 opponent
this year in dual meets, the Cardinal swim
mers expect little competition from the other

teams. However, each athlete has his own
individual battle; and different groups of
swimmers have different plateaus to reach.
The first group of Cardinal swimmers is
composed of the men who have either already
achieved automatic qualifying times for the
NCAA Championships earlier in the year, or
are on relay teams that are assured to post
automatic qualifying times this weekend. This
group includes seasoned veteran seniors Brian
Retterer, Clay Tippins, Kurt Grote; juniors
Scott Gagner, Eric Diehl, Joe Hudepohl and
super-freshman Sabir Muhammad. They are

already assured a spot in the NCAAs, so they
do not have to shave, and do not have to
expend as much mental and emotional energy.
This does not mean, however, that they are
complacent.
"We're talking about doing things people
don't expect," Retterer said. "We're talking
about getting times unshaved that would win
NCAAs. We're thinking about breaking Amer
ican records unshaved."
For the second group of swimmers, most of
the younger ones, it's do or die time. For this
group it is imperative to post automatic quali
fying times.
"The number one objective is to qualify for
NCAAs," said senior Dan Kanner. "If we don't
do that, the season's over."
The focus is on making qualifying times —
if the swimmers reach these small goals, the
larger goal of winning the Pac-10 Champi
onship will come along with it.
A victory this weekend would be the Cardi
nal's unprecedented 14th straight conference
championship, all under Coach Skip Kenney.
It would break the UCLA men's basketball
team's record of 13 straight Pac-10 titles, nine
of them under John Wooden. In anticipation
of the new record, Wooden will be in Long
Beach Saturday to present the award. While
the victory would be astounding, Kenney's
tradition of excellence is so strong that it is
almost taken for granted.
"We don't really think about it much," Tip
pins said. "But when you do step back and
think about it, it's amazing. It's a real tribute
to [Coach Kenney]. When he took over we
were getting our butts kicked, but now he's

made it a tradition for Stanford to
win Pac-lOs."
This is Kenney's 16th season
at Stanford. His first two years
the Cardinal placed sixth and
third in the Pac-lOs. Since then, it
has been nothing but victory.
Along with all the league titles,
the Cardinal has won six NCAA
titles and is aiming for its sev
enth. The sign of a good coach is
consistency. The type of consis
tency Kenney has demonstrated
makes it no exaggeration to place
him in the ranks of Wooden, Red
Auerbach and Vince Lombardi.
"The consistency of winning
over and over is amazing," said
Kanner. "[Coach Kenney] does a
really good job motivating us.

With three days of swimming in
the mornings and at night in Pac
lOs and NCAAs, he gives a tradi
tional speech about a war where
there's six battles. In the morn
ings [preliminaries] you fight to
qualify, and at night ffinals] you
fight to win the points. If you can
win five of the six battles, you'll
win the war."
By these standards, Kenney is
a heck of a warrior.
The final objective for the Car
dinal this weekend is simply to
keep improving. Since upsetting
No. 1 Michigan with a decisive
win Jan. 3, the men's swimmers
have not looked back. Their
momentum has grown with each
meet, as has their confidence.
This is the "dress rehearsal,"
according to Kanner, for NCAAs.
"At Michigan everyone went
from thinking we can win to
knowing," Retterer said. "They

didn't step up like we did. We
found a way to win that we didn't
need last year. Losing a lot of guys
last year, this year we found moti
vation — we found a heart."
Ever since that turnaround
meet, the Cardinal has been
buzzing with nervous energy,
concerned no longer with Michi
gan, but with its own goals.
"What we're doing is making
them focus on us without us
focusing on them," Tippins said.
The Cardinal is not looking at
Michigan's times, but at the indi
vidual goals it can reach.
"There's a lot of nervous
excitement," Retterer said. "Peo
ple are excited to see how fast
they're going to swim. We've got
guys taking down goals that
they've already reached, and set
ting new ones. We have nothing
to lose. We're returning champi
ons, and we know how to win.

We're sending a message to
Michigan that says, 'If you want
to win, go ahead and beat us. But
we're not rolling over."'
Finally, the most exciting
aspect of the weekend is that it is
a championship meet. The season
is on the line for some. The young
guys are ready to step up, and the
older guys are ready to win again.
"Everyone's ready to bust
out," Retterer said. "Every year
there are two or three guys who
really break out and do something
amazing — my American records
were at Pac-lOs. Right now we
have 23 guys thinking they're
going to be the ones who break
out."
With the preparation, the tra
dition, the confidence and the
momentum, the Cardinal is
poised to win the Pac-10 title and
take the final step on its quest to
the NCAA Championships.
