# Men's swimming eyes the record books

Excitement.
That's the key work for the Stanford men's
swimmers as they head to Long Beach this
Thursday through Saturday for the Pacific 10
Conference Championships. Every athlete is
excited. Every swimmer has a goal to surpass.
Every man is ready to shine.
After blowing out every Pac-10 opponent
this year in dual meets, the Cardinal swim
mers expect little competition from the other

teams. However, each athlete has his own
individual battle; and different groups of
swimmers have different plateaus to reach.
The first group of Cardinal swimmers is
composed of the men who have either already
achieved automatic qualifying times for the
NCAA Championships earlier in the year, or
are on relay teams that are assured to post
automatic qualifying times this weekend. This
group includes seasoned veteran seniors Brian
Retterer, Clay Tippins, Kurt Grote; juniors
Scott Gagner, Eric Diehl, Joe Hudepohl and
super-freshman Sabir Muhammad. They are

already assured a spot in the NCAAs, so they
do not have to shave, and do not have to
expend as much mental and emotional energy.
This does not mean, however, that they are
complacent.
"We're talking about doing things people
don't expect," Retterer said. "We're talking
about getting times unshaved that would win
NCAAs. We're thinking about breaking Amer
ican records unshaved."
For the second group of swimmers, most of
the younger ones, it's do or die time. For this
group it is imperative to post automatic quali
fying times.
"The number one objective is to qualify for
NCAAs," said senior Dan Kanner. "If we don't
do that, the season's over."
The focus is on making qualifying times —
if the swimmers reach these small goals, the
larger goal of winning the Pac-10 Champi
onship will come along with it.
A victory this weekend would be the Cardi
nal's unprecedented 14th straight conference
championship, all under Coach Skip Kenney.
It would break the UCLA men's basketball
team's record of 13 straight Pac-10 titles, nine
of them under John Wooden. In anticipation
of the new record, Wooden will be in Long
Beach Saturday to present the award. While
the victory would be astounding, Kenney's
tradition of excellence is so strong that it is
almost taken for granted.
"We don't really think about it much," Tip
pins said. "But when you do step back and
think about it, it's amazing. It's a real tribute
to [Coach Kenney]. When he took over we
were getting our butts kicked, but now he's
