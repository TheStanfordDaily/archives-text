# Future to meet past for track at Fresno State

Assistant coach and former Stanford run
ner Chryste Gaines sits peacefully in the posi
tion that her former coach, Brooks Johnson,
so often assumed. Watching from a chair on
the side of the track she — as Johnson did
before her — watches over the practice starts
of the team sprinters. In his own workout,
Olympian and former Stanford runner Jeff
Atkinson, affectionately known as Rat, powers
around the rain-soaked oval. They ran under
Brooks Johnson, who is now coaching at Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo.

tor Vin Lananna's runners as Johnson used to
watch over her. This Saturday's meet at Fres
no State along with Johnson's San Luis Obis
po team will be the first meet of the outdoor
season and the first meet at which only a
handful of Stanford runners will remember
Johnson, who left Stanford at the end of the
1991 season.
The triangular meet in Fresno — on one of
the top outdoor ovals in Northern California
— will pit Stanford against the host Fresno
State track team and San Luis Obispo.
"Fresno State is one of the best dual meet
teams in the country," said assistant coach
Andy Gerard.

The Stanford team competes this weekend
only a week after the Notre Dame Invitational
in South Bend, Ind., and two weeks after the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Champi
onships in Reno. At the MPSFs, the Stanford
women finished fourth overall and the men
fifth.
The Stanford women finished one place
ahead of local rival California and the men tied
for fifth place with Cal.
Further away at last weekend's Notre
Dame Invitational, the sprinters and jumpers
surpassed all expectations. Freshmen Brany-
on Davis and Anthony Bookman,
and junior Jami Webb took three
of the top six times in the 55
meters to demonstrate that Stan
ford is more than a middle and dis
tance team. Webb also took fourth
in the long jump behind sopho
more Brian Manning's second
place finish. Manning and Webb
again teamed up in the triple jump
to take first and fourth places,
respectively.
The Stanford men throwers
took pride in sophomore Pete
Swanson's domination of the 35-
pound weight and shot-put, as no
competitor came close to Swan
son's NCAA provisional qualifying
throw of 63 feet, 11 and a half
inches in the weight. He joins
senior teammates Dave Popejoy
and Toby Norwood as NCAA pro
visional qualifiers in the weight.
The invitations to the NCAA
Indoor Championships in Indi
anapolis will be out this weekend,
and then Stanford should know
how many of the provisional qual
ifiers will be on their way back to
Indiana.
The Fresno State meet will be
the first chance for the team to
compete outdoors this year,
launching the longer 400-meter
oval phase of the track season.
"This is our first outdoor meet
of the season and it should be a
good assessment of what we've
done over the winter and at our
indoor meets," Lananna said.
Lananna will keep all the
NCAA provisional qualifiers out of
the meet to keep them rested,
including freshman Kortney Dun
scombe, who won the 5,000 meters
at Notre Dame in a meet-record 16
minutes, 36.44 seconds.
The sense of excitement at the
track is palpable. Senior 800-
meter runner Dan McGinn looks
forward to the competition from
the San Luis Obispo runners.
McGinn remembers his freshman
year when he also ran under John
son.
"Brooks Johnson subscribes to
the philosophy of going out hard
for 400 meters [in the 800 meters],
and if as a group we can stay with
the San Luis Obispo runners we
should be able to kick them down
in the end," McGinn said.
