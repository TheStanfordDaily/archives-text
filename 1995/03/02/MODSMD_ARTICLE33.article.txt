# Hurricane warning
## No. 3 women's tennis to battle Miami 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
East will collide with West
today on the courts of Stanford
Tennis Stadium as the third
ranked Stanford women's tennis
team plays host to the Miami
Hurricanes.
The Cardinal (9-1 overall, 2-0
in the Pacific 10 Conference's
Southern Division) looks to get
the kinks out from a fifth-place

finish at the National Team
Indoor Championships in Madi
son, Wis., last weekend. Despite
losing to UCLA 5-4 in the second
round, Stanford finished the
tournament with a 2-1 weekend
record, defeating host Wisconsin
6-0 in the opening round and
Notre Dame 6-1 in Saturday's
consolation match.
"I think coming off the week
end, not having a real tough oppo
nent on Saturday and no one on

Sunday really works in our
favor," said head coach Frank
Brennan. If it had weaved its way
to the finals last weekend, his
squad could have been playing an
incredible seven dual matches in
only 11 total days, with two more
matches this weekend against
California and Texas.
"I'm really glad we have
Miami," Brennan said. "They're
a good solid opponent, and they'll
get us focused again because the
girls are studying real hard right
now. This way we're guaranteed
a solid workout."
The Hurricanes bring to the
courts a record of one match
above .500 at 4-3 after working
through a schedule that features
five top-15 teams in the first
eight matches. They upset the
ninth-ranked Pepperdine team
by a score of 5-4.
Stanford and Miami have
played two mutual opponents
this season. Fresno State, which
the Cardinal swept 9-0, found no
more success against Miami,
which downed the Bulldogs in
their opening match, 8-1. Both
squads also met up with Arizona
State. Miami missed the upset by
one match, falling 5-4, while The
Cardinal used its 5-2 defeat of the
Sun Devils to reach the top of the
Pac-10 South.
In singles, the Hurricanes are
strongest up front, led by their
frequent No. 1 competitior,
Rachel Viollet. She has piled up
five victories in their seven
matches and has won 13 of her 14
tournament matches this season.
Assuming the Cardinal is at full

strength, she will likely play
lOth-ranked sophomore Katie
Schlukebir, who will look to get
back on track after a tough week
end where she battled with three
top-15 singles players.
Stanford should dominate fur
ther down the lineup, where most
of its strength lies. The Nos. 4, 5
and 6 matches have been virtual
ly Cardinal-infested this season.
This weekend, singles matches in
the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth
spots went 11-1 as senior Kim
Shasby, freshman Julie Scott and
senior co-captain Amy Chiminel
lo did not lose in any of their nine
combined matches. In the same
Nos. 4, 5 and 6 slots, the Hurri
canes have struggled, winning
only nine of 21 matches.
Miami's No. 1 doubles squad
of Viollet and Limor Zaltz has
been tough as well, sporting a 5-1
record. However, the Cardinal
has been coming on strong in that
position as of late. Schlukebir and
freshman Ania Bleszynski went
undefeated at the National
Indoor Championships, upending
UCLA's squad of Keri Phebus
and Susie Starrett that currently
ranks eighth nationally. "They
look like a team finally," Brennan
said.
The Cardinal's second and
third doubles tandems look to
bounce back from two defeats
against UCLA. The No. 3 squad,
frequently Shasby and sopho
more Emily Burt, may run into
Victoria Hunt and LeAnne
Gutkin who have won four out of
their five matches at that posi
tion.
