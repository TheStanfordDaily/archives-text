# Women's tumblers climbing rankings

The Stanford women's gymnas
tics team is daring someone to get
in its way.
The 14th-ranked Cardinal will
have two challengers this Satur
day as it travels to Provo, Utah, to
face Brigham Young and Utah
State.
Stanford will have its hands full
as both teams have been ranked in
the top 20 this season. The BYU
Cougars were one of last season's
12 best teams, appearing at the
U.S. Nationals.
"[BYU is] always good at
home," said Stanford coach Breck
Greenwood. "It will be a tough
meet."
Stanford is coming off one of its
finest performances of the season,
an impressive victory against
then-19th-ranked Cal State-
Fullerton. The Cardinal gymnasts
scored the third-highest score in
school history despite suffering
three falls on the balance beam.
"Last year, if we had a couple of
falls, we were dead," Greenwood
said. "When we can have a couple
mistakes and still win, it does a lot
for our confidence."
Last week's victory gave
encouraging signs to several Car
dinal gymnasts. Freshman
Christie Jones and sophomore
Ariel Passanisi vaulted well,
asserting themselves as potent
forces on the vault team. Fresh
man Misty Moore and sophomore
Katie Jennings gave inspiring per
formances on the uneven bars,
while senior co-captain Jene Elzie

demonstrated that she has fully
recovered from her sprained knee
by winning the all-around.
Several members of the squad
have also added new skills to their
routines. Moore has inserted a
giant full pirouette and a giant
blind into her bar routine, a two
tenths bonus. Senior Tina Snow
den will compete using a sukahara
with a full twist in the layout posi
tion, a vault with a starting value
of 10.0.
"I just want to go out and be
consistent," Moore said. "I need to
compete what I have been train
ing."
However, injuries have limited
the development of some of the
Stanford gymnasts. Jennings, one
of the team's best all-arounders,
has been hindered by back prob
lems and illness, keeping her from
putting in additional skills.
"I'm pretty much trying to get
back to maintenance level," Jen
nings said. "I hope to have every
thing in by Pac-lOs."
The squad has steadily
improved over the course of the
season, the result of a carefully
designed plan implemented by
Greenwood and his staff. The idea
is to slowly add difficulty, thus
allowing gymnasts to gain confi
dence and enabling them to con
centrate on individual skills. If all
goes well, the team should peak at
the end of the season, which Stan
ford is approaching quickly.
"We're pretty happy with
where we are right now," Snow
den said. "We keep on progressing
every week, and we expect to peak
at regionals."
