# "Blood Brothers'' aims for the heart — and misses

A — they're
soft," says young David Cas
sidy to his newly befriended
pal Eddie (Tiff Luckenbill) in
"Blood Brothers."
He's right. They're not only
soft but also saintly, self-sac
rificing and bitten by hard
luck.
Take Mrs. Johnston (Petula
Clark). A single mother
working as a domestic for a
rich woman, she is the kind of
welfare mother that Republi
cans love to hate. Abandoned
by a husband who calls her a
"rabbit," she gets pregnant as
often as some women change
their hairdos.

Childbirth is such a part of her routine
that at one point she cracks to her employer,
"If I have this one on the weekend, I'll only
need one day off."
But after eight kids, and the bills piling
up, she can't afford to care for her twins.
Thinking that she is giving one of her sons a
ticket to paradise, she separates the two. One
she keeps, the other she gives up to the rich,
sterile woman who employs her as a domes
tic.
Thus, the stage is set for an over-the-top,
melodramatic family saga that's high on
sugar and low on sense. Mrs. Johnston, the
self-sacrificing mother, is an archetype of
popular culture as seen in '40s "women's"
movies like "Mildred Pierce" and "Stella
Dallas" — films where the mother acts for
the good of her children, regardless of the
demands of logic or common sense.
"Blood Brothers" is a depressing experi
ence, like taking downers and watching an
episode of "All My Children" in slow mo
tion. Nearly three hours long, the show is
stuffed with Hat dialogue and unmemorable
songs.

The musical opens with "Marilyn
Monroe," a piece which sounds like
a ridiculous remix of an old Beach
Boys song. Another weak point is "Shoes
Upon the Table" which repeats itself to death
like a dirge from the chorus of a Greek
tragedy. Silly rhymes like "tea" and "free"
doth not a good show make. Aside from a
few bright moments, like Clark singing the
sad, emotional "Easy Terms," there are no
show stoppers here.
The separated twins meet again as kids,
and — unaware of their relation — end up
becoming best friends. Since each lives on a
different side of the economic fence, play
wright Willy Russell {"Educating Rita,"
"Shirley Valentine") gets the chance to ad
dress the sensitive issue of class divisions in
England, a country where there is little social
mobility. Rich kids grow up with a ticket to
"Oxbridge" (the Oxford and Cambridge col
leges), leading up to plum jobs. On the other
hand, kids like Mickey, the David Cassidy
character, suffer from injustice and lack of

opportunity.
Cassidy is an ideal seven-year old, with
his baby face and heart-throb smile. But
when the cute kid gets old and loses all of his
charm, seeing Mickey grow up on stage is as
unappealing as seeing Cassidy himself age.
The former child star who sang pre-pubes
cent love ballads in"The Partridge Family"
is now a mere shadow of his former self. The
parallels between Cassidy's true life and the
role he plays here arc depressing.
The leading female characters provide
some of the standout moments of the pro
duction. Cassidy's love interest in the play,
Linda, is an unusually full-bodied role, at
least in the context of musical theater.
Played by soap-opera veteran Yvette
Lawrence ("One Life to Live"), Linda is a
Lolita in shorter skirts. Still a schoolgirl
when she first puts the moves on Mickey,
she exudes unbridled sexuality and lascivi
ous sex appeal. Add to that her perfect fake
Liverpool accent and you have a bombshell
waiting to explode. Surprisingly, her duct

with Tif Luckenbill, "Light Romance," is
one of the highlights of the show. Intrigu
ing from beginning to end, Lawrence is
only overshadowed when Clark appears on
stage.
Clark, playing Mickey's dowdy mother, is
still as luminous as she was thirty years ago
in musicals like "Finian's Rainbow" and
"Goodbye, Mr. Chips." She's a jewel amid the
bleak, graffiti-plagued public housing that
surrounds her. Standing against brown
bricks and beneath dim lights, she's a tower
of dignity. She isn't on stage nearly enough,
however, and her many absences are deeply
felt.
Sometimes full of almost operatic fervor,
with music often exploding out of nowhere,
"Blood Brothers" moves along with delib
erate, heavy-handed pathos. It tries to tell
too much story in one evening, and soon
overstays its welcome, much like a relative
who comes for Thanksgiving dinner and is
still around at Christmas time, sitting on a
couch with a beer bottle in his hand, burp
ing and saying "Yeah! Yeah!" when the
Swedish bikini team comes on.
The musical finally climaxes in a ludi
crous scene that fails to provide adequate
catharsis. Meant to give the audience an
emotional payoff, instead it shows the
ridiculous nature of the whole situation -
it's a finale ripe for parody, the kind not
even TV miniseries would dare do, for fear
of embarrassment.
Muddled by sentimentality, cliches, con
trivances and even some anachronisms,
"Blood Brothers" flounders in a deep sea of
hysterical melodrama.
Though it's blessed with some strong
performances and does make an
important commentary on class
struggles, "Blood Brothers" does not earn
any honest emotional engagement from the
audience. Marked by the kind of corniness
best left for daytime soap-operas, "Blood
Brothers" takes itself far too seriously.
Just for the sake of a cheap S&M refer
ence, "Blood Brothers" is like being hand
cuffed to a chair and then whipped by a ma
tronly 300-pound New Jersey housewife.

ake no notice
of mothers
A — they're
soft," says young David Cas
sidy to his newly befriended
pal Eddie (Tiff Luckenbill) in
"Blood Brothers."
He's right. They're not only
soft but also saintly, self-sac
rificing and bitten by hard
luck.
Take Mrs. Johnston (Petula
Clark). A single mother
working as a domestic for a
rich woman, she is the kind of
welfare mother that Republi
cans love to hate. Abandoned
by a husband who calls her a
"rabbit," she gets pregnant as
often as some women change
their hairdos.

Childbirth is such a part of her routine
that at one point she cracks to her employer,
"If I have this one on the weekend, I'll only
need one day off."
But after eight kids, and the bills piling
up, she can't afford to care for her twins.
Thinking that she is giving one of her sons a
ticket to paradise, she separates the two. One
she keeps, the other she gives up to the rich,
sterile woman who employs her as a domes
tic.
Thus, the stage is set for an over-the-top,
melodramatic family saga that's high on
sugar and low on sense. Mrs. Johnston, the
self-sacrificing mother, is an archetype of
popular culture as seen in '40s "women's"
movies like "Mildred Pierce" and "Stella
Dallas" — films where the mother acts for
the good of her children, regardless of the
demands of logic or common sense.
"Blood Brothers" is a depressing experi
ence, like taking downers and watching an
episode of "All My Children" in slow mo
tion. Nearly three hours long, the show is
stuffed with Hat dialogue and unmemorable
songs.

The musical opens with "Marilyn
Monroe," a piece which sounds like
a ridiculous remix of an old Beach
Boys song. Another weak point is "Shoes
Upon the Table" which repeats itself to death
like a dirge from the chorus of a Greek
tragedy. Silly rhymes like "tea" and "free"
doth not a good show make. Aside from a
few bright moments, like Clark singing the
sad, emotional "Easy Terms," there are no
show stoppers here.
The separated twins meet again as kids,
and — unaware of their relation — end up
becoming best friends. Since each lives on a
different side of the economic fence, play
wright Willy Russell {"Educating Rita,"
"Shirley Valentine") gets the chance to ad
dress the sensitive issue of class divisions in
England, a country where there is little social
mobility. Rich kids grow up with a ticket to
"Oxbridge" (the Oxford and Cambridge col
leges), leading up to plum jobs. On the other
hand, kids like Mickey, the David Cassidy
character, suffer from injustice and lack of

opportunity.
Cassidy is an ideal seven-year old, with
his baby face and heart-throb smile. But
when the cute kid gets old and loses all of his
charm, seeing Mickey grow up on stage is as
unappealing as seeing Cassidy himself age.
The former child star who sang pre-pubes
cent love ballads in"The Partridge Family"
is now a mere shadow of his former self. The
parallels between Cassidy's true life and the
role he plays here arc depressing.
The leading female characters provide
some of the standout moments of the pro
duction. Cassidy's love interest in the play,
Linda, is an unusually full-bodied role, at
least in the context of musical theater.
Played by soap-opera veteran Yvette
Lawrence ("One Life to Live"), Linda is a
Lolita in shorter skirts. Still a schoolgirl
when she first puts the moves on Mickey,
she exudes unbridled sexuality and lascivi
ous sex appeal. Add to that her perfect fake
Liverpool accent and you have a bombshell
waiting to explode. Surprisingly, her duct

with Tif Luckenbill, "Light Romance," is
one of the highlights of the show. Intrigu
ing from beginning to end, Lawrence is
only overshadowed when Clark appears on
stage.
Clark, playing Mickey's dowdy mother, is
still as luminous as she was thirty years ago
in musicals like "Finian's Rainbow" and
"Goodbye, Mr. Chips." She's a jewel amid the
bleak, graffiti-plagued public housing that
surrounds her. Standing against brown
bricks and beneath dim lights, she's a tower
of dignity. She isn't on stage nearly enough,
however, and her many absences are deeply
felt.
Sometimes full of almost operatic fervor,
with music often exploding out of nowhere,
"Blood Brothers" moves along with delib
erate, heavy-handed pathos. It tries to tell
too much story in one evening, and soon
overstays its welcome, much like a relative
who comes for Thanksgiving dinner and is
still around at Christmas time, sitting on a
couch with a beer bottle in his hand, burp
ing and saying "Yeah! Yeah!" when the
Swedish bikini team comes on.
The musical finally climaxes in a ludi
crous scene that fails to provide adequate
catharsis. Meant to give the audience an
emotional payoff, instead it shows the
ridiculous nature of the whole situation -
it's a finale ripe for parody, the kind not
even TV miniseries would dare do, for fear
of embarrassment.
Muddled by sentimentality, cliches, con
trivances and even some anachronisms,
"Blood Brothers" flounders in a deep sea of
hysterical melodrama.
Though it's blessed with some strong
performances and does make an
important commentary on class
struggles, "Blood Brothers" does not earn
any honest emotional engagement from the
audience. Marked by the kind of corniness
best left for daytime soap-operas, "Blood
Brothers" takes itself far too seriously.
Just for the sake of a cheap S&M refer
ence, "Blood Brothers" is like being hand
cuffed to a chair and then whipped by a ma
tronly 300-pound New Jersey housewife.
