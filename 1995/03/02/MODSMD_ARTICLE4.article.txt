## Bill would ban dirty e-mail 
### Ben Decker 
A bill proposed in both houses of Congress last
February could mean new content-based regula
tions on e-mail in the future.
"It is clearly a poorly conceived proposal," said
Prof. Carey Heckman, the co-director of the Stan
ford Law and Technology Center. "Constitutional
rights should be viewed through a technology trans
parent lens . . . free speech is just as important on
the net as it is in the halls of Congress, or on a soap
box in White Plaza."
Heckman warned that "the dangers from propos
als like this are greater than those from the prob
lems they are trying to solve. It's scary that someone
in that position would propose to sacrifice constitu
tional rights to preserve a squeaky-clean atmos
phere."
Sponsored by Sen. Jim Exon of Nebraska and
Rep. Tim Johnson of South Dakota, the Communi
cations Decency Act is intended to "protect the pub
lic from the misuse of the telecommunications net
work."
"I want to keep the information superhighway
from resembling a red light district," Exon said in a
statement issued with the bill. "This legislation will
help stop those who electronically cruise the digital
universe to engage children in inappropriate com-
munications ... or electronically
stalk users of computer networks."
"Currently, the only major law
regulating communication is the
Communications Act of 1934. A lot
of people agree that it is outdated
and needs to be reformed," said
Dwight Fettig, Johnson's legisla
tive director. "There is legislation
prohibiting harassment over the
phone, the same sorts of standards
should be applied to the informa
tion highway."
The act amends the 1934 law,
striking the word telephone and
replacing it with "telecommunica
tions device." In addition to these
amendments, the new act would
raise penalties for prohibited com
munication to a maximum fine of
$100,000 and two years in jail.
As it is worded now, Heckman
and others worry that liability
could be placed on the service
provider. If this is the case, Heck
man fears that the only way for an
organization to comply would be to
"go out of business." He added
that, "Senator Exon does not
understand how the Internet
works."
Neither harassment nor obscen
ity is a mcyor problem at Stanford,
but it does occur. Just six months
ago the University created the
position of computer security offi

cer to deal with these sorts of prob
lems.
Steve Hansen, who now fills the
security position, estimated that he
receives about one harassment
complaint a week. However,
Hansen said, "there may be many
cases of harassment going unre
ported."
"There's not a whole hell of a lot
we can do about it," Hansen said.
"If there are threats of physical
violence, we can prosecute under
California law." Other than such
extreme cases, Stanford's power is
very limited.
"I think [the act] puts those of
us in the administration in the role
of snoopers," said Bill Bauriedel,
an information security officer at
Stanford. "None of us wants that
role. We're happy to address com
plaints, but we don't want to regu
late."
"We realize the bill we've intro
duced needs to be changed," Fettig
said. "It's really more of a starting
point." Fettig added that he real
izes many people have concerns
about the act and stressed that "we
plan to work closely with those in
the telecommunications industry
and civil rights groups which have
concerns."
According to Fettig, "there's a
reasonable chance that [the bill]
will be voted on during this ses
sion." Originally, supporters hoped
that the bill would be acted on by
spring, but the date set by Exon
and Johnson is now July 4.
