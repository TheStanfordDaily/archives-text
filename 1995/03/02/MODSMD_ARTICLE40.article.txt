# Even Hunter S. Thompson never had an adventure like this ...
## Disnep's Aladdin 
### 
Jars, cars — nothing but cars — ab
g j solute madness. Traffic central, USA.
Never, I repeat, never take anyone's
advice about how long it takes to drive to San
Francisco on a Friday night.
Sweating like a madman, stop and go, stop
and go — finally, Cow Palace, my salvation.
Late, late, late. Lean down really low in the
seat, creep stealthily into a prime $8 parking
spot while the attendants sit in a corner chew
ing the cud. Ducking down, slip out of the car
— a frantic aside to my escort: "Down!
Down, you fiend! What, do

you want to get us arrested?'"
Take a validation ticket from
under the windshield wiper of
a cherry-red BMW (Eat your
liver, rich boy!) and place
neatly under my wiper. Stand
up coolly. Everything's nice
and legal now.
Ahhhh, arrival. Just in time
to see a portly genie zipping
across the ice at maximum ve
locity.
My God. He's really blue.
How can anyone skate like
that surrounded by Styro
foam? He can't see. His eyes
are plastic. This is insane, ab
solutely insane. Complete
madness. He's heading
straight toward the barrier.
Nothing separating his
crazed, steel-bladed lunacy
from hundreds of gleeful
munchkins — unaware that
only moments from now they
will be crushed, absolutely
flattened to a pulp fiction by
this seven-foot grape popsi
cle. 1 ... I can't look — but I
must.
He tilts on a skate, per
ilously perched on one leg.
Please no! — and shazam!
Shaves of ice flash up in a fire
ball burst, and chaos, utter
chaos! The sky is aflame with
an explosion of light —
sparks everywhere ... senses
reeling — it's too, too much.
Mind's ... going ... to ex
plode. .. and ... and ... In
termission. Ahhhhhhhhrrg.

The lights brighten, and I can
catch my breath. This place is Kidsville.
Thousands, absolutely thousands of 'em as
far as the eye can see.
But who says the Disneyland of the North
can't fit in?
I push past the things to buy — there's ab
solutely no lack of things to buy: Aladdin
wingers, Genie zingers and (doesn't this
sound crcepily like "Indiana Jones and the
Temple of Doom"?) plastic Abu head cups
filled with crimson snow — and see a football
field of ice, magic ice. I cannot see my breath,
yet the ice does not melt. The ice does not
melt, yet 1 cannot see my breath — clearly a
case of high black sorcery.

Spookiness maximus.
The backdrop is two-leveled, complete
with balcony for Jasmin and a large ominous
entrance out of which all kinds of marvelous
creatures on skates emerge.
Parade, parade — this is a parade, a show
of freaks, but freaks on ice. Something's not
quite natural. Not because the rug (which
happens to be a completely enclosed hermet
ically-sealed hand woven shroud with no
head popping out) zips around upright on
the ice, not because a 15-foot tall elephant

lumbers gracefully past, not because there are
palace guards reeling about upside-down on
hand-stand skates attached to long poles, de
fying all laws of balance and equilibrium in
even the most elevated theoretical physics.
But, because they all do it so well.
/ | 11 of them, unequivocally all of
them, are brilliant. Someone drags
r out a trampoline, and then they
bust loose, snaking side to side right toward it.
A leap, a bound, and in the air, sailing higher
and higher like a hoard of graceful Arabian
geese in flight, one after the other. Then, they
fold neatly into a three-and-a-half reverse

somersault. In the tuck position, no less.
This is where they go. This is the graveyard
for all those Olympic skaters who place
fourth.
Ah yes, but all this chaos unnecessarily
churning the world unnaturally rapidly to
ward entropy, is "Aladdin."
It's all there, the entire film on ice. Three
dimensionally in all of its strange cartoon
glory. There are few clues to reveal this is not
what it seems to be. A bizarre mix of imagi
nation and reality.

The voices, all pre-recorded, blare through
the speakers at top volume. Help! I am the
man in the Maxwell cassette ad, pressed vio
lently back in my seat, hair whipping in the
wind of Robin Williams voice ranting and
raving on and on in the accent of William F.
Buckley, Jr. — too many levels of reality. At
least his Styrofoam head didn't start to
morph....
Voices speaking, Aladdin's lips moving —
yet the sound comes from somewhere further
off. And the Genie, he talks, but having lips of
Styrofoam, cannot move them. So he com
pensates with spastic waggings of the head,
his quail-like tuft springing back and forth

Graphic by Alicia Padron

atop his grotesque purple noggin, like a very
small and evil jack burst from its box.
t's all so perfect, all too perfect. Aladdin
M looks exactly like in the movie, Jafar has
\M the same twisted beard, the Sultan
walks on skates with the identical waddle as in
Disney. lust Jasmin seems different, and only
because her face is tart and frustrated with
this whole on-ice experience. And this sour
puss says "just send me back to the pleasant
Technicolor land of two-dimensional bliss."

But how does it all end?
How could eight million clams
worth of costumes, lights and
sheer Arctic hysteria top itself?
Remember the classic
Genie song "You've never had a
friend like me?" Now imagine
never having two... no, three.
.. four ... no, countless, ten
. . . fifteen . . . now thirty
friends, oh sweet Jesus, never
having thirty friends like that
— all of them blue and all of
them on blades of steel, all of
them unquestionably identi
cal, skating symmetrically
around the ice, like a whirling
propeller tempting the suicidal
fate of crashing implosively
upon itself.
Nirvana! The Godhead, I
see the Godhead: No! It can't
be. It's Walt....
Passing out, violently
crashing to cotton candy cov
ered floor, in convulsions —
utterly involuntary. Mumbling
incoherently "the iceman
cometh, the iceman cometh."
Someone has revived me,
splashing cold water on my
face, shouting: "The show is
over but are you all right? Say
something, anything!"
My face terribly contorted,
my mind in a fit, I find,
strangely, I can speak only in
rhyme — and thus my final
words....
"All vou frosh in Branner,

this show is a must,
Get the dorm together,
and pile in a bus.

All you Lambda Nu-crs,
do what you do best,
Turn on the Peter Tosh,
then put "Aladdin" to the test.
As for the rest of Stanford,
fans of Disney cannot skip,
But all should be forewarned,

Parade, parade — this is a parade, a show
of freaks, but freaks on ice. Something's not
quite natural. Not because the rug (which
happens to be a completely enclosed hermet
ically-sealed hand woven shroud with no
head popping out) zips around upright on
the ice, not because a 15-foot tall elephant

lumbers gracefully past, not because there are
palace guards reeling about upside-down on
hand-stand skates attached to long poles, de
fying all laws of balance and equilibrium in
even the most elevated theoretical physics.
But, because they all do it so well.
/ | 11 of them, unequivocally all of
them, are brilliant. Someone drags
r out a trampoline, and then they
bust loose, snaking side to side right toward it.
A leap, a bound, and in the air, sailing higher
and higher like a hoard of graceful Arabian
geese in flight, one after the other. Then, they
fold neatly into a three-and-a-half reverse

somersault. In the tuck position, no less.
This is where they go. This is the graveyard
for all those Olympic skaters who place
fourth.
Ah yes, but all this chaos unnecessarily
churning the world unnaturally rapidly to
ward entropy, is "Aladdin."
It's all there, the entire film on ice. Three
dimensionally in all of its strange cartoon
glory. There are few clues to reveal this is not
what it seems to be. A bizarre mix of imagi
nation and reality.

The voices, all pre-recorded, blare through
the speakers at top volume. Help! I am the
man in the Maxwell cassette ad, pressed vio
lently back in my seat, hair whipping in the
wind of Robin Williams voice ranting and
raving on and on in the accent of William F.
Buckley, Jr. — too many levels of reality. At
least his Styrofoam head didn't start to
morph....
Voices speaking, Aladdin's lips moving —
yet the sound comes from somewhere further
off. And the Genie, he talks, but having lips of
Styrofoam, cannot move them. So he com
pensates with spastic waggings of the head,
his quail-like tuft springing back and forth

atop his grotesque purple noggin, like a very
small and evil jack burst from its box.
t's all so perfect, all too perfect. Aladdin
M looks exactly like in the movie, Jafar has
\M the same twisted beard, the Sultan
walks on skates with the identical waddle as in
Disney. lust Jasmin seems different, and only
because her face is tart and frustrated with
this whole on-ice experience. And this sour
puss says "just send me back to the pleasant
Technicolor land of two-dimensional bliss."

But how does it all end?
How could eight million clams
worth of costumes, lights and
sheer Arctic hysteria top itself?
Remember the classic
Genie song "You've never had a
friend like me?" Now imagine
never having two... no, three.
.. four ... no, countless, ten
. . . fifteen . . . now thirty
friends, oh sweet Jesus, never
having thirty friends like that
— all of them blue and all of
them on blades of steel, all of
them unquestionably identi
cal, skating symmetrically
around the ice, like a whirling
propeller tempting the suicidal
fate of crashing implosively
upon itself.
Nirvana! The Godhead, I
see the Godhead: No! It can't
be. It's Walt....
Passing out, violently
crashing to cotton candy cov
ered floor, in convulsions —
utterly involuntary. Mumbling
incoherently "the iceman
cometh, the iceman cometh."
Someone has revived me,
splashing cold water on my
face, shouting: "The show is
over but are you all right? Say
something, anything!"
My face terribly contorted,
my mind in a fit, I find,
strangely, I can speak only in
rhyme — and thus my final
words....
"All vou frosh in Branner,

this show is a must,
Get the dorm together,
and pile in a bus.

All you Lambda Nu-crs,
do what you do best,
Turn on the Peter Tosh,
then put "Aladdin" to the test.
As for the rest of Stanford,
fans of Disney cannot skip,
But all should be forewarned,




Jars, cars — nothing but cars — ab
g j solute madness. Traffic central, USA.
Never, I repeat, never take anyone's
advice about how long it takes to drive to San
Francisco on a Friday night.
Sweating like a madman, stop and go, stop
and go — finally, Cow Palace, my salvation.
Late, late, late. Lean down really low in the
seat, creep stealthily into a prime $8 parking
spot while the attendants sit in a corner chew
ing the cud. Ducking down, slip out of the car
— a frantic aside to my escort: "Down!
Down, you fiend! What, do

you want to get us arrested?'"
Take a validation ticket from
under the windshield wiper of
a cherry-red BMW (Eat your
liver, rich boy!) and place
neatly under my wiper. Stand
up coolly. Everything's nice
and legal now.
Ahhhh, arrival. Just in time
to see a portly genie zipping
across the ice at maximum ve
locity.
My God. He's really blue.
How can anyone skate like
that surrounded by Styro
foam? He can't see. His eyes
are plastic. This is insane, ab
solutely insane. Complete
madness. He's heading
straight toward the barrier.
Nothing separating his
crazed, steel-bladed lunacy
from hundreds of gleeful
munchkins — unaware that
only moments from now they
will be crushed, absolutely
flattened to a pulp fiction by
this seven-foot grape popsi
cle. 1 ... I can't look — but I
must.
He tilts on a skate, per
ilously perched on one leg.
Please no! — and shazam!
Shaves of ice flash up in a fire
ball burst, and chaos, utter
chaos! The sky is aflame with
an explosion of light —
sparks everywhere ... senses
reeling — it's too, too much.
Mind's ... going ... to ex
plode. .. and ... and ... In
termission. Ahhhhhhhhrrg.

The lights brighten, and I can
catch my breath. This place is Kidsville.
Thousands, absolutely thousands of 'em as
far as the eye can see.
But who says the Disneyland of the North
can't fit in?
I push past the things to buy — there's ab
solutely no lack of things to buy: Aladdin
wingers, Genie zingers and (doesn't this
sound crcepily like "Indiana Jones and the
Temple of Doom"?) plastic Abu head cups
filled with crimson snow — and see a football
field of ice, magic ice. I cannot see my breath,
yet the ice does not melt. The ice does not
melt, yet 1 cannot see my breath — clearly a
case of high black sorcery.

Spookiness maximus.
The backdrop is two-leveled, complete
with balcony for Jasmin and a large ominous
entrance out of which all kinds of marvelous
creatures on skates emerge.
