Focus on:
Gombei Japanese Kitchen
by Chris Levinson

Bring cash. I tell you this now so that
when people forget — and trust me,
they will — they can't say they weren't
warned. Let's just say this is coming from ex
perience. A friend once told me he'd be pay
ing, flashed his plastic, then flashed crimson.
No credit cards, no checks. Just cash. Enough
said.
Those who know me well knew it had to
be done. Gombei is my stomping ground. A
home away from home seeped in clear broths
and teriyaki bastes. "1 think they choose to
not recognize me because I always ask for a
fork," whispers friend M. as he pushes aside
chopsticks and we slide behind our gray
topped table, one of the many that neatly line
the interior of this Japanese "kitchen." Bright
and tidy, the room vibrates with table chatter
and sizzle from the open kitchen. Tonight we
get lucky, arriving just before the crowd that
now stands with noses pressed up against the

glass, impatiently eyeing the occupants of an
occupied table still lingering over their luke
warm tea.
Some of you need no prodding — tonight
played like a Stanford "who's who" away
from the din of the dimly lit CoHo. For oth
ers, let me introduce you to a diner's heaven.
Don't let the Japanese genre conjure up im
ages of flipper on rice; this is no sushi house.
Although there are nightly sushi specials —
tonight a Yellowtail teriyaki dinner will run
you $ 12 — my advice is to read on.
The menu divides neatly between solids

and liquids. If you've come prepared — in
other words, hungry — try a combination
dinner. Choose chicken teriyaki nestled be
side deep fried shrimp ($8.75) or opt for beef
teriyaki coupled with calamari ($9); both will
arrive surrounded by the essential extras —
miso soup, rice and salad (tonight, carrots
and spinach sprinkled with sesame seeds,
ginger and soy). All this is presented on nifty
individual trays; your high school cafeteria
with a twist — this stuff is good.
If all that food proves daunting, move on
to the next option: Gombei dinners. Chicken

($7.50) or salmon ($8) teriyaki take center
stage flocked by the now familiar soup, salad
and rice piled high in a cobalt blue earthen
ware bowl. Or you can go straight. Chicken,
beef or pork Donburi translates roughly into
tangy marinated meat morsels laid to rest
over a steaming bed of rice ($7-8.50).
And that's just the left half of the menu.
What remains is for those of us who prefer to
be spoon fed. Udon (buckwheat) noodles can
be slurped up from their clear broth plain
($4.50), or accompanied by shrimp ($6.50).
And then there's my favorite. "Aren't you sick
of this yet?" asks Tiung as he sets down my
piping bowl of goodies. The broth is striped by
carrots, spinach, both oyster and onoki mush
rooms, an immaculate, almost manicured
presentation that throws in green onions, cab
bage and tofu for effect ($8.50). Healthy? Yes.
But it wouldn't touch these lips if it didn't taste
good ... and this stuff is divine.
The crowd is teeming at the door, but the
efficient service is made to order. The rapid
pace means scarce minutes separate you
from your order and fulfillment — but don't
fret, you're permitted to linger. I catch the fe
male member of that couple by the door eye
ing our table. Guilt mounts. We head for the
exit. Their turn.
