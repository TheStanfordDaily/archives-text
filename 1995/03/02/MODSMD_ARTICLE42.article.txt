The Viennese Ball not really your style?
Then check out Sanskriti's alternative
offering: "Bhangra by the Bay II." San
skriti — Stanford's Club of the Indian Sub
continent — was inspired by the new event's
tremendous success last year to expand this
year's competition. By putting up flyers, plac
ing ads in various Indian magazines and
spreading the word at other Asian events, the
club attracted teams from across the Bay Area
to perform against Stanford's two squads.
"Last year was the first year," said Anoop
Prakash, Sanskriti co-chair. "Now the public
ity has gotten out. Next year, we're hoping to
attract people from across the country."
Dancers from Fresno, Santa Clara, Milpi
tas and Berkeley, among others, will come to
Stanford to demonstrate the full diversity of
bhangra. Ten teams — double the partici
pants from last year — will compete for a
$500 prize. They will be judged on choreog
raphy, dance ability and bhangra spirit.
Bhangra is an Indian dance that originat
ed in Punjab, a state in Northern India. "Tra
ditionally, bhangra was a dance done by Pun
jabi men to celebrate at festivals, weddings
and seasonal harvest," Prakash explained. It
has migrated to England, the Caribbean and
Canada, continuously changing in the
process. Bhangra has now blended with a
medley of music styles including house, tech
no, rap, reggae, ska and hip-hop. "The music
keeps evolving, and the biggest challenge will
be to create new moves.... Bhangra repre
sents the spice, style and celebration of Indi
an culture," Prakash added.
Bhangra has always been a popular dance
in the Bay Area; many universities, especially
those with large South Asian populations,
had their own competitions. Until last year,
however, there has never been a major inter
school competition in the area.

Gita Sinha, Sanskriti co-chair, said she
hopes that people from the entire Stanford
community will attend and enjoy the compe
tition. "We're hoping this event gives Stan
ford a chance to see what Bhangra is all about
and how it has evolved from its traditional
roots in Punjab to now incorporate the ele
ments of world music," Sinha remarked.

"The party really highlights this because the
DJ mixes all kinds of music into the standard
bhangra beat."
Prakash emphasized that bhangra is not
only a dance but also a celebration. Although
it has evolved greatly over the years, bhangra
has not lost its original meaning: It is full of
color and spirit, displaying the richness of an

Indian tradition. "Sanskriti's goal is to pro
mote South Asian culture. The bhangra com
petition and party is a way of doing that, fo
cusing on Punjabis' culture and tradition. It
will expose the Bay Area to this vibrant part
of Indian culture and also to build ties be
tween the Indian communities in California."
Despite bhangra's roots in tradition,
Prakash explained that bhangra has very con
temporary qualities. "It's very much a mod
ern dance," Prakash said. "The most creative
and spirited team will most likely win. We're
getting judged on an attitude because that's
what counts," he added. "If you're not the in
the mood, you can't dance it."
Sinha agreed that the spirit is the most es
sential part to dance bhangra. "You don't
have to be able to dance bhangra to en joy this
music, but it's really easy to learn!" Sinha
said.
Restricted to taped music and an eight
minute time allotment, the teams will have
the opportunity to display their creativity.
The competition will be held at Kresge Audi
torium, followed by a party at Lagunita
Court. Sarovar Restaurant of Sunnyvale will
cater the event and Bhangra Perfections will
provide entertainment. ■
