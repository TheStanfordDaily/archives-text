# Alan Jacobs. Laura San Giacomo and Paul Rhus on what happens when:
## 'Nina Takes A Lover' 
### Elisabeth Morse 
Recording to Alan Jacobs, I aura San (iiaco
mo and Paul Rhys, their new film, "Nina
Takes a Lover," is not simply about a
young, trendy, married woman confiding
about her affair with a sew photographer to
a journalist.
"I do refer to it sometimes as a love mvs
tery," said Laura San Ciaconio, who plavs
Nina.
"You are going on a journey with [the
characters! while they .ire discovering the po
tential ol the best people that they can be. You
are going on that journey with them and like
.1 mystery, they are unraveling the people that
they can be, and you are beginning to see the
best relationship that they can have, i he au
dience and the characters are discovering it
together," San (iiacomo mused.
Similarly, the interview with the two actors
and director of "Nina lakes a Lover" pro
gressed in stages. I irst, I talked to l'aul
Rhys, who played Nina's mysterious
lover/photographer; Rhys asked me almost
as many questions as I asked him. I.xit Rhys,
and enter Alan Jacobs, the writer and director
of the film, who seemed reluctant to speak at
all. Finally, San (iiacomo, the most boister
ous of the three, joined the conversation, in
stilling it with long dialogues on all sorts of
topics — and answering my questions before
I even asked.
Paul Rhys' British accent and blue eyes ac
cented everything he said. Despite roles in
"Chaplin" and "Vincent and Theo," Rhys is
largely unknown to American audiences and
new to American film-making. The filming
of "Nina Takes a Lover" "was very different.
It was great. It was the first thing I shot on the
streets of America with American people,
you know — everyone involved was Ameri
can. 1 loved it," Rhys said.
Rhys describes his decision to make the
film as entirely without hesitation: "They
sent me the script the day 1 arrived from
London. It was the first script I read off the
plane and 1 really liked it. It was a really in
telligently written piece about people I sort
of understood, in a situation I sort of under
stood, and I was really keen to do it."
"Often in the past," Rhys continued, "I've
portrayed the parts of people who are very
far away from me, people who are very neu
rotic, psychotic, masochistic, lots of -istics.
I'his was a regular person in a situation close
to me." Though unmarried, Rhys has been
living with an actress for four years, which he
says is "virtually the same."
Playing the part of the mysterious pho
tographer didn't present a particularly diffi
cult challenge, Rhys said. "I tried to play the
honesty, the integrity of the piece. Acting is
simply a combination of your imagination,
your intelligence and your real life experi
ence, isn't it. You can mix that in varying
proportions of each thing. In this case, it was
a lot of my real life. It was a person 1 wanted
to be close to me. It wasn't 'Look how bril
liant I am, look at this accent I'm doing.' "
"Mostly," Rhys concluded, "I learned
about being a photographer. I tried to learn
how to handle a camera."

Rhys detailed his favorite parts of making
"Nina Takes a Lover": "I I iked being in
America, being in San Irancisco, and I like
that we weren't spoiled. We were just trying
to make the film, trying to tell the story, we
were really down to earth. It was not the sort
of ludicrous thing that you can sometimes
get into. Its been a pretty hands-on thing. It
was constantly relentless. Ihe filming itself
took 24 days.
With the quick pace ot the filming, it
helped that when working with Jacobs, Rhys
felt "there was never any fear at all."
The initial stages of my interview with la
cobs were rather frightening, though. "So,
this is your first film?" I asked.
"Yes."
"Do you only give one word answers?" I
tried.
"No."
Jacobs, who went to Wesleyan College
(majoring in English literature) and Stan
ford Business School ("actually, one year ot
[studying with) the program and (the next]
making a movie"), got his film experience
making commercial films for Apple Com
puter. He was also a journalist for six years
for a variety of daily and weekly papers.
I le described "getting a bug," tor making
films about two years ago. "I think it's be
cause film is able to simultaneously satisfy a
few of my needs. One of them was to be able
to write something that many people would
see. Another was to be able to work in a col
laborative medium because journalism is
often isolated, as I'm sure you know. And I
guess the third is maybe to be doing some
thing that I felt really mattered.
"It wasn't until I gave [journalism) up and
started writing fiction that I felt that I was
getting somewhere in terms of discovering
the famous quote that Picasso said, which is
that 'art is a lie which will help us realize the
truth,' and that's been my own experience.
"When you write a newspaper story, you
gather the facts and shape them into some
kind of a story so that each of the little pieces
is true, but so that the whole may not be true.
But I think that when you are creating art,
the great works of literature or film or the
ater that really touch us are the ones that
have'fictional' characters that make us see
things that we didn't see before about our
selves."
Jacobs' dedicated "Nina Takes a Lover'.' to
his son Ciil. The idea for the movie came
partly from his wife: "I had these characters
at a high school reunion. They were all com
ing back to their high school reunion, but
there wasn't a story there, there wasn't an in
teresting relationship. Then my wife sug
gested that the two main characters were
lovers but somehow that they really be
longed together."
On both writing and directing the movie,
Jacobs commented that "it makes the direct
ing a lot easier because you've written the
script and you've got the original version of
what it's supposed to be. You can see the
whole. When you are not writing, when you
are directing someone else's material (which

I've only done with plays), you're always try
ing to figure out what's the intention here. So
I had enough things to deal with without
trying to figure out: what did the writer
mean. It made it easier."
Only five significant characters emerge in
"Nina Takes a Lover"; thus, the personality
of each is carefully explored. Jacobs said the
characters weren't based on any specific peo
ple. He associates himself

r —
perhaps the most with the
photographer, but also
with the journalist.
"1 think I've been each
of the characters at differ
ent times," lacobs said.
"You know there's some

Paulie | the sleazy pick-up
artist | in me. There's some Paulie in all of us
— mischievous. Also the journalist, who is
someone who is paralyzed by his inability to
act."
"Nina Takes a Lover" does contain a sur
prise plot twist, but lacobs says the movie is
not about a twist or revelation, but about a
romance.
"A lot ol people feel that you are rooting for
these people and that you want to see them to
gether. The reaction that a lot of people have

is that they will be, that they may be."
Ht this point, Laura San Giacomo, walked
in, contrasting Alan Jacobs' sweatshirt
and jeans with a stylish well-tailored
pants suit. "Shall I sit down or do you want to
be private?" she queried.
"You can't be more public than an inter
view," replied Jacobs.
"Do you want to have a private public in-

terview?"
ask e d
San Gia-

como with a raised eyebrow.
A waiter came over and offered San (iiaco
mo coffee. "Please," she said, "hook me up."
Immediately, San Giacomo began defend
ing the film before being asked any questions.
"If'relationship' is the final frontier, then
this is one episode in the final frontier. I think
that action is emotion; an emotional film is

an action film to me, that's the roller-coaster
ride I wanna go on. And so a relationship to
me, and to a lot of people who are searching
for the relationship of their lives — or for the
few relationships of their lives, whether it be
friendships, mother-child, significant oth
ers, mates, companions — that is really the
final frontier, that is the ultimate of what we
are here to do — to find love."
Like

R h y s,

San Gia
como tried

to draw on

her own experi
ences to create Nina. "I don't think that it is
really a direct parallel to my own life, but the
bridge between me and this character is not
very long. I have been married lor three
years. I thought 1 related to [ Nina) and that I
wanted her to be reliable. 1 wanted her to be
every woman. In a sense, I thought that if I
could create that, and many women could re
late to something about her, then I had done
a good job, because I do feel that so many
women are looking for a better way to have a

relationship. And me too."
Like a relationship, "acting and directing,"
San Giacomo continued, "is not a finite
process. Okay, in a business sense, you do
add up the numbers at the end of the day, but
you just hope to tell the truth as you know it
now, because in two years, you might be a
smarter person, you might know much more
about that subject, or that emotion, or that
kind of relationship, but it's infinite, it's an

infinite

process.

But so is a rela-

tionship, it grows

and develops, up and

down. We have, you know

films that people relate to, film

that people don't relate to. So, it's

ever-changing and ever moving forward.
"I can't remember the original question,
hut I love what I just said. You must under

stand, I've been up since four o'clock and I'm
just hitting my peak," San Giacomo finished,
taking a swallow of her coffee.
San Giacomo also talked about the
process of working on her past, often racier,
characters of "Sex, l ies, and Videotape" and
"The Stand."
"1 don't really consider those gills evil
though they are often described .is 'bad
girls.' I look at it from a different perspective.
I try to figure out why they do the things tli.it
they do and not be so judgmental of them. I
am more of an audience member instead ol
inside painting the portrait. So, certainly I
[heardj all the time that C vnthia (of "Sex,
Lies, and Videotape") was a bad girl. But to
me, Cynthia is .1 little sister whose older sis
ter is gorgeous and popular. I mean, what
does that do to someone, growing up all the
time hearing 'You're Ann's little sister, you're
not as smart as Ann, you're not as pretty as
Ann, Ann's the one we want?' finally, in the
moment of the film that I think is the key to
Cynthia's character is during this videotape
[when she asks] 'Am I pretty? Prettier than
Ann?' This is like a little girl wanting some
kind of validation, to be loved. So I never saw
her as a bad girl. Then 1 looked at sexuality as
power. So I wasn't as judgmental of her as I
would be maybe if I was watching her.
"In some ways, Paul (Rhys) and I have
talked about how these characters are not so
far away from us, but in some respect, 1 feel
like I worked on this script more intimately
than a lot of things I've worked on because
there are so many levels of the film to work
through and because basically it is a two
character piece. This was .1 really intimate
portrait. Paul and my characters are so much
of the story. I've never been in something on
screen where the story has been so much
about my character that I've had time to tell
the storv."

"Nina Takes

a Lover," con-

tains some
beautiful
shots of
the San
Francisco
skyline, the

Bay bridge
and lots of
scenes inside

typical San
Francisco cof-

fee shops; it
seemed (hat the

city was the sixth character in the movie, but
Jacobs, who lives in the SoMA area, quickly
refuted the notion.
"You don't know what city you're in. We
deliberately tried to keep San Francisco out
of it. The same way Laura was trying to make
Nina any woman, I was trying to make San
Francisco any romantic West Coast town.
What 1 did is that 1 said to the cinematogra
pher, 'Things I don't want in the movie: the
Golden Gate Bridge, the cable cars, and the
Transamerica Tower. I wanted it to be San
Francisco .is seen through natives, or people
who live here, rather than the S.lll Francisco
that tourists see."
In the film, the journalist asks the photog
rapher's character what his definition of fi
delitv is, so I posed the same question to la
cobs and San Giacomo.
"I think he raises a question," said Jacobs,
"that, frankly, 1 don't have an answer to, but
it's .111 intriguing question. You want some
body and are really fantasizing that it is more
than just a fantasy that you long for some
body else. Is there betrayal there? 1 don't
know the answer to that."
He turned to San Giacomo. "Do you
know the answer to that? Would you feel be
trayed?"
"If my husband was fantasizing about
someone else?"
"Not just in a sexual sense, but a longing
to be with someone even if they never moved
to do it?" queried Jacobs. "I mean, I think my
wife sometimes fantasizes what it would be
like to be married to her first love. I mean,
maybe we all do that. I'm sure I have. I don't
know where you draw the line."
San Giacomo attempted a response: "The
mind is the personal landscape. To a certain
extent, what you think in your mind is your
own. But if you are living a lie, then you are
betraying the person that you are living with,
because if there is a lie between you, then that
lie rules the relationship.
"So the difference between fantasizing
about being intimate — whether emotional
ly or sexually with someone else, and living
the lie of being obsessed with it — and not
being happy with who you're with, [is that]
then the relationship becomes [centered on|
the lie, it can never go past the lie and then
you are betraying them. I'm sure for some
people maybe the physical act is not as potent
as staying there and living that lie [which] is
more deceitful. But maybe it's a completely
personal thing, and it's not a question that
can be answered chicken or egg."

Every film and film maker has a goal,
and Jacobs concluded the interview
and this stage of our journalist/in
terviewee relationship with his.

"What is most gratifying to me is to
make a film that people are still
thinking about clays later, or weeks
later. And in a few cases, even

months later. If you make a film that
touches people, that moves them to

genuine tears, that moves them to hug
the person that they came with, that

moves them to call their long distance

lover, then all the four years of work that I

and others have put into it has some mean

ing. Because ultimately, that's what we want.
It's not for the glory as much as it is to feel
that you've made a difference, that you've
moved somebody." ■

moves them to call their long distance

lover, then all the four years of work that I

and others have put into it has some mean

ing. Because ultimately, that's what we want.
It's not for the glory as much as it is to feel
that you've made a difference, that you've
moved somebody." ■


Recording to Alan Jacobs, I aura San (iiaco
mo and Paul Rhys, their new film, "Nina
Takes a Lover," is not simply about a
young, trendy, married woman confiding
about her affair with a sew photographer to
a journalist.
"I do refer to it sometimes as a love mvs
tery," said Laura San Ciaconio, who plavs
Nina.
"You are going on a journey with [the
characters! while they .ire discovering the po
tential ol the best people that they can be. You
are going on that journey with them and like
.1 mystery, they are unraveling the people that
they can be, and you are beginning to see the
best relationship that they can have, i he au
dience and the characters are discovering it
together," San (iiacomo mused.
Similarly, the interview with the two actors
and director of "Nina lakes a Lover" pro
gressed in stages. I irst, I talked to l'aul
Rhys, who played Nina's mysterious
lover/photographer; Rhys asked me almost
as many questions as I asked him. I.xit Rhys,
and enter Alan Jacobs, the writer and director
of the film, who seemed reluctant to speak at
all. Finally, San (iiacomo, the most boister
ous of the three, joined the conversation, in
stilling it with long dialogues on all sorts of
topics — and answering my questions before
I even asked.
Paul Rhys' British accent and blue eyes ac
cented everything he said. Despite roles in
"Chaplin" and "Vincent and Theo," Rhys is
largely unknown to American audiences and
new to American film-making. The filming
of "Nina Takes a Lover" "was very different.
It was great. It was the first thing I shot on the
streets of America with American people,
you know — everyone involved was Ameri
can. 1 loved it," Rhys said.
Rhys describes his decision to make the
film as entirely without hesitation: "They
sent me the script the day 1 arrived from
London. It was the first script I read off the
plane and 1 really liked it. It was a really in
telligently written piece about people I sort
of understood, in a situation I sort of under
stood, and I was really keen to do it."
"Often in the past," Rhys continued, "I've
portrayed the parts of people who are very
far away from me, people who are very neu
rotic, psychotic, masochistic, lots of -istics.
I'his was a regular person in a situation close
to me." Though unmarried, Rhys has been
living with an actress for four years, which he
says is "virtually the same."
Playing the part of the mysterious pho
tographer didn't present a particularly diffi
cult challenge, Rhys said. "I tried to play the
honesty, the integrity of the piece. Acting is
simply a combination of your imagination,
your intelligence and your real life experi
ence, isn't it. You can mix that in varying
proportions of each thing. In this case, it was
a lot of my real life. It was a person 1 wanted
to be close to me. It wasn't 'Look how bril
liant I am, look at this accent I'm doing.' "
"Mostly," Rhys concluded, "I learned
about being a photographer. I tried to learn
how to handle a camera."

Rhys detailed his favorite parts of making
"Nina Takes a Lover": "I I iked being in
America, being in San Irancisco, and I like
that we weren't spoiled. We were just trying
to make the film, trying to tell the story, we
were really down to earth. It was not the sort
of ludicrous thing that you can sometimes
get into. Its been a pretty hands-on thing. It
was constantly relentless. Ihe filming itself
took 24 days.
With the quick pace ot the filming, it
helped that when working with Jacobs, Rhys
felt "there was never any fear at all."
The initial stages of my interview with la
cobs were rather frightening, though. "So,
this is your first film?" I asked.
"Yes."
"Do you only give one word answers?" I
tried.
"No."
Jacobs, who went to Wesleyan College
(majoring in English literature) and Stan
ford Business School ("actually, one year ot
[studying with) the program and (the next]
making a movie"), got his film experience
making commercial films for Apple Com
puter. He was also a journalist for six years
for a variety of daily and weekly papers.
I le described "getting a bug," tor making
films about two years ago. "I think it's be
cause film is able to simultaneously satisfy a
few of my needs. One of them was to be able
to write something that many people would
see. Another was to be able to work in a col
laborative medium because journalism is
often isolated, as I'm sure you know. And I
guess the third is maybe to be doing some
thing that I felt really mattered.
"It wasn't until I gave [journalism) up and
started writing fiction that I felt that I was
getting somewhere in terms of discovering
the famous quote that Picasso said, which is
that 'art is a lie which will help us realize the
truth,' and that's been my own experience.
"When you write a newspaper story, you
gather the facts and shape them into some
kind of a story so that each of the little pieces
is true, but so that the whole may not be true.
But I think that when you are creating art,
the great works of literature or film or the
ater that really touch us are the ones that
have'fictional' characters that make us see
things that we didn't see before about our
selves."
Jacobs' dedicated "Nina Takes a Lover'.' to
his son Ciil. The idea for the movie came
partly from his wife: "I had these characters
at a high school reunion. They were all com
ing back to their high school reunion, but
there wasn't a story there, there wasn't an in
teresting relationship. Then my wife sug
gested that the two main characters were
lovers but somehow that they really be
longed together."
On both writing and directing the movie,
Jacobs commented that "it makes the direct
ing a lot easier because you've written the
script and you've got the original version of
what it's supposed to be. You can see the
whole. When you are not writing, when you
are directing someone else's material (which

I've only done with plays), you're always try
ing to figure out what's the intention here. So
I had enough things to deal with without
trying to figure out: what did the writer
mean. It made it easier."
Only five significant characters emerge in
"Nina Takes a Lover"; thus, the personality
of each is carefully explored. Jacobs said the
characters weren't based on any specific peo
ple. He associates himself

r —
perhaps the most with the
photographer, but also
with the journalist.
"1 think I've been each
of the characters at differ
ent times," lacobs said.
"You know there's some

Paulie | the sleazy pick-up
artist | in me. There's some Paulie in all of us
— mischievous. Also the journalist, who is
someone who is paralyzed by his inability to
act."
"Nina Takes a Lover" does contain a sur
prise plot twist, but lacobs says the movie is
not about a twist or revelation, but about a
romance.
"A lot ol people feel that you are rooting for
these people and that you want to see them to
gether. The reaction that a lot of people have

is that they will be, that they may be."
Ht this point, Laura San Giacomo, walked
in, contrasting Alan Jacobs' sweatshirt
and jeans with a stylish well-tailored
pants suit. "Shall I sit down or do you want to
be private?" she queried.
"You can't be more public than an inter
view," replied Jacobs.
"Do you want to have a private public in-

terview?"
ask e d
San Gia-

como with a raised eyebrow.
A waiter came over and offered San (iiaco
mo coffee. "Please," she said, "hook me up."
Immediately, San Giacomo began defend
ing the film before being asked any questions.
"If'relationship' is the final frontier, then
this is one episode in the final frontier. I think
that action is emotion; an emotional film is

an action film to me, that's the roller-coaster
ride I wanna go on. And so a relationship to
me, and to a lot of people who are searching
for the relationship of their lives — or for the
few relationships of their lives, whether it be
friendships, mother-child, significant oth
ers, mates, companions — that is really the
final frontier, that is the ultimate of what we
are here to do — to find love."
Like

R h y s,

San Gia
como tried

to draw on

her own experi
ences to create Nina. "I don't think that it is
really a direct parallel to my own life, but the
bridge between me and this character is not
very long. I have been married lor three
years. I thought 1 related to [ Nina) and that I
wanted her to be reliable. 1 wanted her to be
every woman. In a sense, I thought that if I
could create that, and many women could re
late to something about her, then I had done
a good job, because I do feel that so many
women are looking for a better way to have a

relationship. And me too."
Like a relationship, "acting and directing,"
San Giacomo continued, "is not a finite
process. Okay, in a business sense, you do
add up the numbers at the end of the day, but
you just hope to tell the truth as you know it
now, because in two years, you might be a
smarter person, you might know much more
about that subject, or that emotion, or that
kind of relationship, but it's infinite, it's an

infinite

process.

But so is a rela-

tionship, it grows

and develops, up and

down. We have, you know

films that people relate to, film

that people don't relate to. So, it's

ever-changing and ever moving forward.
"I can't remember the original question,
hut I love what I just said. You must under

stand, I've been up since four o'clock and I'm
just hitting my peak," San Giacomo finished,
taking a swallow of her coffee.
San Giacomo also talked about the
process of working on her past, often racier,
characters of "Sex, l ies, and Videotape" and
"The Stand."
"1 don't really consider those gills evil
though they are often described .is 'bad
girls.' I look at it from a different perspective.
I try to figure out why they do the things tli.it
they do and not be so judgmental of them. I
am more of an audience member instead ol
inside painting the portrait. So, certainly I
[heardj all the time that C vnthia (of "Sex,
Lies, and Videotape") was a bad girl. But to
me, Cynthia is .1 little sister whose older sis
ter is gorgeous and popular. I mean, what
does that do to someone, growing up all the
time hearing 'You're Ann's little sister, you're
not as smart as Ann, you're not as pretty as
Ann, Ann's the one we want?' finally, in the
moment of the film that I think is the key to
Cynthia's character is during this videotape
[when she asks] 'Am I pretty? Prettier than
Ann?' This is like a little girl wanting some
kind of validation, to be loved. So I never saw
her as a bad girl. Then 1 looked at sexuality as
power. So I wasn't as judgmental of her as I
would be maybe if I was watching her.
"In some ways, Paul (Rhys) and I have
talked about how these characters are not so
far away from us, but in some respect, 1 feel
like I worked on this script more intimately
than a lot of things I've worked on because
there are so many levels of the film to work
through and because basically it is a two
character piece. This was .1 really intimate
portrait. Paul and my characters are so much
of the story. I've never been in something on
screen where the story has been so much
about my character that I've had time to tell
the storv."

"Nina Takes

a Lover," con-

tains some
beautiful
shots of
the San
Francisco
skyline, the

Bay bridge
and lots of
scenes inside

typical San
Francisco cof-

fee shops; it
seemed (hat the

city was the sixth character in the movie, but
Jacobs, who lives in the SoMA area, quickly
refuted the notion.
"You don't know what city you're in. We
deliberately tried to keep San Francisco out
of it. The same way Laura was trying to make
Nina any woman, I was trying to make San
Francisco any romantic West Coast town.
What 1 did is that 1 said to the cinematogra
pher, 'Things I don't want in the movie: the
Golden Gate Bridge, the cable cars, and the
Transamerica Tower. I wanted it to be San
Francisco .is seen through natives, or people
who live here, rather than the S.lll Francisco
that tourists see."
In the film, the journalist asks the photog
rapher's character what his definition of fi
delitv is, so I posed the same question to la
cobs and San Giacomo.
"I think he raises a question," said Jacobs,
"that, frankly, 1 don't have an answer to, but
it's .111 intriguing question. You want some
body and are really fantasizing that it is more
than just a fantasy that you long for some
body else. Is there betrayal there? 1 don't
know the answer to that."
He turned to San Giacomo. "Do you
know the answer to that? Would you feel be
trayed?"
"If my husband was fantasizing about
someone else?"
"Not just in a sexual sense, but a longing
to be with someone even if they never moved
to do it?" queried Jacobs. "I mean, I think my
wife sometimes fantasizes what it would be
like to be married to her first love. I mean,
maybe we all do that. I'm sure I have. I don't
know where you draw the line."
San Giacomo attempted a response: "The
mind is the personal landscape. To a certain
extent, what you think in your mind is your
own. But if you are living a lie, then you are
betraying the person that you are living with,
because if there is a lie between you, then that
lie rules the relationship.
"So the difference between fantasizing
about being intimate — whether emotional
ly or sexually with someone else, and living
the lie of being obsessed with it — and not
being happy with who you're with, [is that]
then the relationship becomes [centered on|
the lie, it can never go past the lie and then
you are betraying them. I'm sure for some
people maybe the physical act is not as potent
as staying there and living that lie [which] is
more deceitful. But maybe it's a completely
personal thing, and it's not a question that
can be answered chicken or egg."

Every film and film maker has a goal,
and Jacobs concluded the interview
and this stage of our journalist/in
terviewee relationship with his.

"What is most gratifying to me is to
make a film that people are still
thinking about clays later, or weeks
later. And in a few cases, even

months later. If you make a film that
touches people, that moves them to

genuine tears, that moves them to hug
the person that they came with, that

moves them to call their long distance

lover, then all the four years of work that I

and others have put into it has some mean

ing. Because ultimately, that's what we want.
It's not for the glory as much as it is to feel

make a film that people are still
thinking about clays later, or weeks
later. And in a few cases, even

months later. If you make a film that
touches people, that moves them to

genuine tears, that moves them to hug
the person that they came with, that

moves them to call their long distance

lover, then all the four years of work that I

and others have put into it has some mean

ing. Because ultimately, that's what we want.
It's not for the glory as much as it is to feel
that you've made a difference, that you've
moved somebody." ■


Recording to Alan Jacobs, I aura San (iiaco
mo and Paul Rhys, their new film, "Nina
Takes a Lover," is not simply about a
young, trendy, married woman confiding
about her affair with a sew photographer to
a journalist.
"I do refer to it sometimes as a love mvs
tery," said Laura San Ciaconio, who plavs
Nina.
"You are going on a journey with [the
characters! while they .ire discovering the po
tential ol the best people that they can be. You
are going on that journey with them and like
.1 mystery, they are unraveling the people that
they can be, and you are beginning to see the
best relationship that they can have, i he au
dience and the characters are discovering it
together," San (iiacomo mused.
Similarly, the interview with the two actors
and director of "Nina lakes a Lover" pro
gressed in stages. I irst, I talked to l'aul
Rhys, who played Nina's mysterious
lover/photographer; Rhys asked me almost
as many questions as I asked him. I.xit Rhys,
and enter Alan Jacobs, the writer and director
of the film, who seemed reluctant to speak at
all. Finally, San (iiacomo, the most boister
ous of the three, joined the conversation, in
stilling it with long dialogues on all sorts of
topics — and answering my questions before
I even asked.
Paul Rhys' British accent and blue eyes ac
cented everything he said. Despite roles in
"Chaplin" and "Vincent and Theo," Rhys is
largely unknown to American audiences and
new to American film-making. The filming
of "Nina Takes a Lover" "was very different.
It was great. It was the first thing I shot on the
streets of America with American people,
you know — everyone involved was Ameri
can. 1 loved it," Rhys said.
Rhys describes his decision to make the
film as entirely without hesitation: "They
sent me the script the day 1 arrived from
London. It was the first script I read off the
plane and 1 really liked it. It was a really in
telligently written piece about people I sort
of understood, in a situation I sort of under
stood, and I was really keen to do it."
"Often in the past," Rhys continued, "I've
portrayed the parts of people who are very
far away from me, people who are very neu
rotic, psychotic, masochistic, lots of -istics.
I'his was a regular person in a situation close
to me." Though unmarried, Rhys has been
living with an actress for four years, which he
says is "virtually the same."
Playing the part of the mysterious pho
tographer didn't present a particularly diffi
cult challenge, Rhys said. "I tried to play the
honesty, the integrity of the piece. Acting is
simply a combination of your imagination,
your intelligence and your real life experi
ence, isn't it. You can mix that in varying
proportions of each thing. In this case, it was
a lot of my real life. It was a person 1 wanted
to be close to me. It wasn't 'Look how bril
liant I am, look at this accent I'm doing.' "
"Mostly," Rhys concluded, "I learned
about being a photographer. I tried to learn
how to handle a camera."

Rhys detailed his favorite parts of making
"Nina Takes a Lover": "I I iked being in
America, being in San Irancisco, and I like
that we weren't spoiled. We were just trying
to make the film, trying to tell the story, we
were really down to earth. It was not the sort
of ludicrous thing that you can sometimes
get into. Its been a pretty hands-on thing. It
was constantly relentless. Ihe filming itself
took 24 days.
With the quick pace ot the filming, it
helped that when working with Jacobs, Rhys
felt "there was never any fear at all."
The initial stages of my interview with la
cobs were rather frightening, though. "So,
this is your first film?" I asked.
"Yes."
"Do you only give one word answers?" I
tried.
"No."
Jacobs, who went to Wesleyan College
(majoring in English literature) and Stan
ford Business School ("actually, one year ot
[studying with) the program and (the next]
making a movie"), got his film experience
making commercial films for Apple Com
puter. He was also a journalist for six years
for a variety of daily and weekly papers.
I le described "getting a bug," tor making
films about two years ago. "I think it's be
cause film is able to simultaneously satisfy a
few of my needs. One of them was to be able
to write something that many people would
see. Another was to be able to work in a col
laborative medium because journalism is
often isolated, as I'm sure you know. And I
guess the third is maybe to be doing some
thing that I felt really mattered.
"It wasn't until I gave [journalism) up and
started writing fiction that I felt that I was
getting somewhere in terms of discovering
the famous quote that Picasso said, which is
that 'art is a lie which will help us realize the
truth,' and that's been my own experience.
"When you write a newspaper story, you
gather the facts and shape them into some
kind of a story so that each of the little pieces
is true, but so that the whole may not be true.
But I think that when you are creating art,
the great works of literature or film or the
ater that really touch us are the ones that
have'fictional' characters that make us see
things that we didn't see before about our
selves."
Jacobs' dedicated "Nina Takes a Lover'.' to
his son Ciil. The idea for the movie came
partly from his wife: "I had these characters
at a high school reunion. They were all com
ing back to their high school reunion, but
there wasn't a story there, there wasn't an in
teresting relationship. Then my wife sug
gested that the two main characters were
lovers but somehow that they really be
longed together."
On both writing and directing the movie,
Jacobs commented that "it makes the direct
ing a lot easier because you've written the
script and you've got the original version of
what it's supposed to be. You can see the
whole. When you are not writing, when you
are directing someone else's material (which

I've only done with plays), you're always try
ing to figure out what's the intention here. So
I had enough things to deal with without
trying to figure out: what did the writer
mean. It made it easier."
Only five significant characters emerge in
"Nina Takes a Lover"; thus, the personality
of each is carefully explored. Jacobs said the
characters weren't based on any specific peo
ple. He associates himself

r —
perhaps the most with the
photographer, but also
with the journalist.
"1 think I've been each
of the characters at differ
ent times," lacobs said.
"You know there's some

Paulie | the sleazy pick-up
artist | in me. There's some Paulie in all of us
— mischievous. Also the journalist, who is
someone who is paralyzed by his inability to
act."
"Nina Takes a Lover" does contain a sur
prise plot twist, but lacobs says the movie is
not about a twist or revelation, but about a
romance.
"A lot ol people feel that you are rooting for
these people and that you want to see them to
gether. The reaction that a lot of people have

is that they will be, that they may be."
Ht this point, Laura San Giacomo, walked
in, contrasting Alan Jacobs' sweatshirt
and jeans with a stylish well-tailored
pants suit. "Shall I sit down or do you want to
be private?" she queried.
"You can't be more public than an inter
view," replied Jacobs.
"Do you want to have a private public in-

terview?"
ask e d
San Gia-

como with a raised eyebrow.
A waiter came over and offered San (iiaco
mo coffee. "Please," she said, "hook me up."
Immediately, San Giacomo began defend
ing the film before being asked any questions.
"If'relationship' is the final frontier, then
this is one episode in the final frontier. I think
that action is emotion; an emotional film is

an action film to me, that's the roller-coaster
ride I wanna go on. And so a relationship to
me, and to a lot of people who are searching
for the relationship of their lives — or for the
few relationships of their lives, whether it be
friendships, mother-child, significant oth
ers, mates, companions — that is really the
final frontier, that is the ultimate of what we
are here to do — to find love."
Like

R h y s,

San Gia
como tried

to draw on

her own experi
ences to create Nina. "I don't think that it is
really a direct parallel to my own life, but the
bridge between me and this character is not
very long. I have been married lor three
years. I thought 1 related to [ Nina) and that I
wanted her to be reliable. 1 wanted her to be
every woman. In a sense, I thought that if I
could create that, and many women could re
late to something about her, then I had done
a good job, because I do feel that so many
women are looking for a better way to have a

relationship. And me too."
Like a relationship, "acting and directing,"
San Giacomo continued, "is not a finite
process. Okay, in a business sense, you do
add up the numbers at the end of the day, but
you just hope to tell the truth as you know it
now, because in two years, you might be a
smarter person, you might know much more
about that subject, or that emotion, or that
kind of relationship, but it's infinite, it's an

infinite

process.

But so is a rela-

tionship, it grows

and develops, up and

down. We have, you know

films that people relate to, film

that people don't relate to. So, it's

ever-changing and ever moving forward.
"I can't remember the original question,
hut I love what I just said. You must under

stand, I've been up since four o'clock and I'm
just hitting my peak," San Giacomo finished,
taking a swallow of her coffee.
San Giacomo also talked about the
process of working on her past, often racier,
characters of "Sex, l ies, and Videotape" and
"The Stand."
"1 don't really consider those gills evil
though they are often described .is 'bad
girls.' I look at it from a different perspective.
I try to figure out why they do the things tli.it
they do and not be so judgmental of them. I
am more of an audience member instead ol
inside painting the portrait. So, certainly I
[heardj all the time that C vnthia (of "Sex,
Lies, and Videotape") was a bad girl. But to
me, Cynthia is .1 little sister whose older sis
ter is gorgeous and popular. I mean, what
does that do to someone, growing up all the
time hearing 'You're Ann's little sister, you're
not as smart as Ann, you're not as pretty as
Ann, Ann's the one we want?' finally, in the
moment of the film that I think is the key to
Cynthia's character is during this videotape
[when she asks] 'Am I pretty? Prettier than
Ann?' This is like a little girl wanting some
kind of validation, to be loved. So I never saw
her as a bad girl. Then 1 looked at sexuality as
power. So I wasn't as judgmental of her as I
would be maybe if I was watching her.
"In some ways, Paul (Rhys) and I have
talked about how these characters are not so
far away from us, but in some respect, 1 feel
like I worked on this script more intimately
than a lot of things I've worked on because
there are so many levels of the film to work
through and because basically it is a two
character piece. This was .1 really intimate
portrait. Paul and my characters are so much
of the story. I've never been in something on
screen where the story has been so much
about my character that I've had time to tell
the storv."

"Nina Takes

a Lover," con-

tains some
beautiful
shots of
the San
Francisco
skyline, the

Bay bridge
and lots of
scenes inside

typical San
Francisco cof-

fee shops; it
seemed (hat the

city was the sixth character in the movie, but
Jacobs, who lives in the SoMA area, quickly
refuted the notion.
"You don't know what city you're in. We
deliberately tried to keep San Francisco out
of it. The same way Laura was trying to make
Nina any woman, I was trying to make San
Francisco any romantic West Coast town.
What 1 did is that 1 said to the cinematogra
pher, 'Things I don't want in the movie: the
Golden Gate Bridge, the cable cars, and the
Transamerica Tower. I wanted it to be San
Francisco .is seen through natives, or people
who live here, rather than the S.lll Francisco
that tourists see."
In the film, the journalist asks the photog
rapher's character what his definition of fi
delitv is, so I posed the same question to la
cobs and San Giacomo.
"I think he raises a question," said Jacobs,
"that, frankly, 1 don't have an answer to, but
it's .111 intriguing question. You want some
body and are really fantasizing that it is more
than just a fantasy that you long for some
body else. Is there betrayal there? 1 don't
know the answer to that."
He turned to San Giacomo. "Do you
know the answer to that? Would you feel be
trayed?"
"If my husband was fantasizing about
someone else?"
"Not just in a sexual sense, but a longing
to be with someone even if they never moved
to do it?" queried Jacobs. "I mean, I think my
wife sometimes fantasizes what it would be
like to be married to her first love. I mean,
maybe we all do that. I'm sure I have. I don't
know where you draw the line."
San Giacomo attempted a response: "The
mind is the personal landscape. To a certain
extent, what you think in your mind is your
own. But if you are living a lie, then you are
betraying the person that you are living with,
because if there is a lie between you, then that
lie rules the relationship.
"So the difference between fantasizing
about being intimate — whether emotional
ly or sexually with someone else, and living
the lie of being obsessed with it — and not
being happy with who you're with, [is that]
then the relationship becomes [centered on|
the lie, it can never go past the lie and then
you are betraying them. I'm sure for some
people maybe the physical act is not as potent
as staying there and living that lie [which] is
more deceitful. But maybe it's a completely
personal thing, and it's not a question that
can be answered chicken or egg."

Every film and film maker has a goal,
and Jacobs concluded the interview
and this stage of our journalist/in
terviewee relationship with his.

"What is most gratifying to me is to
make a film that people are still
thinking about clays later, or weeks
later. And in a few cases, even

months later. If you make a film that
touches people, that moves them to

genuine tears, that moves them to hug
the person that they came with, that

personal thing, and it's not a question that
can be answered chicken or egg."

Every film and film maker has a goal,
and Jacobs concluded the interview
and this stage of our journalist/in
terviewee relationship with his.

"What is most gratifying to me is to
make a film that people are still
thinking about clays later, or weeks
later. And in a few cases, even

months later. If you make a film that
touches people, that moves them to

genuine tears, that moves them to hug
the person that they came with, that

moves them to call their long distance

lover, then all the four years of work that I

and others have put into it has some mean

ing. Because ultimately, that's what we want.
It's not for the glory as much as it is to feel
that you've made a difference, that you've
moved somebody." ■
