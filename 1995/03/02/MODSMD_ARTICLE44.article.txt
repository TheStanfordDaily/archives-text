## Free Kitten's relentless growl quickly grows old 
### 
Most side projects don't like being referred
to as "side projects." The term seems to sug
gest that the group isn't actually a band, but
just a few musicians making up songs in
their time away from their "real bands.
In the case of Free Kitten, however, this
term works to the band's advantage, since
few serious groups would be able to get
away with putting out an album as silly
and cocky as this one.
Free Kitten features members of Sonic
Youth, Pavement, the Boredoms and I'ussv
Galore, but their album "Nice Ass" lacks
the inventiveness of any of those groups.
The Free Kitten approach is a straightfor
ward one, with meaty guitars and straining
vocals tossing off tunes that reek of atti
tude but frequently lack substance.
but "Nice Ass" is nonetheless an interest
ing release, in a backwards and haphazard
way. The songs are casual and unadorned,
and they become all the more appealing
when

"Nice Ass"
Free Kitten

they make you
wonder if they
are all just a
big joke.
like a
cross between

Blondie and Dr. Pre, Kim Gordon oozes
with attitude as she raps, sings, screams
and gags her way through thirty-two min
utes of bitter sarcasm and fun. In just the
first 10 seconds of "Call Back (Episode
XXI)," for instance, she takes a shot at
Michael Jackson and calls Henry Rollins
"a real cream puff."
Free Kitten's laid-back arrogance can
yield some truly enjoyable results, like the
messy and majestic "Revlon l iberation
Orchestra" or "Greener Pastures," an
indie-rock reinterpretation of the "Green
Acres" theme song.
But on other occasions, Free Kitten is
simply grating and tiresome, as the band's
cocky and abrasive formula quickly

grows stale.

"Nice Ass" would have
made an exciting HP, but
over the course of 15 tracks,
the Free Kitten joke is so re
lentlessly pounded into
your head that you thank
your lucky stars it's only a
side project.
