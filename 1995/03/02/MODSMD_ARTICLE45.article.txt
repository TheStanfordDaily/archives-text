# Digging Dag's 'Righteous' release
## 
### 
Don't let the first track on Dag's "Right
eous" turn you off. It only lasts a couple of sec
onds and then you get to the real music.
And real the music is. In the words of Vin
cent Vega from "Pulp Fiction," "You dig it the
most."
And dig Dag I do. (Try saying that 10 times
fast.) In the funky spirit ofthe Red Hot Chili Fep-
pers, this band

"Righteous"
Dag

knows how to lay
out the groovy
vibes. Although
at times they be
come too twangy
or almost ridicu
lous in their

sound, it is always in the spirit of good fun —
I )ag plays the kind of music that grows on you.
This new quartet — composed of Kenny
Soule on drums, Doug Jervey on keyboards,
Bobby Patterson on vocals and bass and Brian
Dennis on guitar — really rips it out.
but what differentiates Dag from any other
Peppers wannabe? First, there aren't many
bands out there that emulate the Chilies —
simply because it's not that easy to, and second,
they don't quote the band, even if they have the
same feel.
The finest ofthe 13 tracks on their debut
Colombia release is the title track "Righteous."
With almost whiney falsetto vocals and a
whole lotta soul you just have to shimmy to,
this is definitely not sit down music. We are
talking shake, shake, shake your bootie.
Another fine track is "Lovely Jane." This
funky ballad is similar, on some levels, to the
feel of "My Lovely Man" off of "Blood Sugar
Sex Magik." Although it lacks serious develop
ment, as some of the other songs on "Right
eous," the repetitiveness is reminiscent of a
good dance remix: enjoyable enough not to

cause you to tire of it quickly.
On another track, "Even So," Dag takes
funk back to its roots, dipping into a pure and
sweet '70s sound that accentuates the moder
nity and creativity of the rest ot the album. In
light of the hip soundtracks ofTarantino films,
"Righteous" fits right into this retro niche, but
with all the elevated lyrical egalitarianism of a
'90s sensitive male band.
With a little more maturation and self-defi
nition, Dag will clearly grow into a band apt to
stay out of the "where are they now?" file for
some time.
Perhaps the best sign about "Righteous" is
that there are only two looser tracks, the first
and the last. And with all that oh-so-soulful
stuff in between, they are entirely forgiven. Be
cause "Righteous" is nothing but that.
