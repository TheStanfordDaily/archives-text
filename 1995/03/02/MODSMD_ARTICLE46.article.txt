# Tanya Donelly's Belly demonstrates it is the band that would be 'King'
## 
### 
Tanya Donclly opens Belly's new album
"King" with obnoxious guitar feedback so
common and fake you wonder how she
(and a million other alterna-bands) can
even pretend they are making serious
music. Fortunately, Donclly appropriately
titles the first track "Puberty" and refrains

from boy-rock cliches for the rest of "King."
Although critics loved Belly's debut,
"Star," Donclly was often unable to step out
from her Throwing Muses step-sister's
shadow. Her first headline tour was also
hardly ideal — the opening band, one-hit
wonder Radiohead, attracted more mosh
readv fans than Belly.
But Donclly isn't about to waste her time
whining. She proudly voices on "Silverfish"
that "1 don't want to hear about your poor
ly-timcd rock career." Instead, she has fo
cused her energy on creating a masterpiece
album.
With a voice as sweet as an angel's and a
mind that loves to dream (most of her songs
revolve around moons, birds, monkeys, and
rockets), Donelly's fragile hymns on "Star"
sound like they are about to painfully break
apart.
The new album, on the other hand, is
about confidence and clarity; Donclly even

unabashedly prints complete lyrics on the
album sleeve.
Some arrangements on "King" are truly
mesmerizing. "Red" starts off with gloomy
guitar strums and lullaby-style vocals. And
just when the chorus comes around and you
fully expect a Pumpkins-style refrain of
screaming guitars and crashing cymbals,
Donellyand bassist (.ail (ireenwood switch
gears and begin goofing off like two cartoon
characters, la-la-ing lyrics like "redre
dred. . . coo-coo." The effect is distracting at
first listen, tolerable on the second spin —
and absolutely brilliant the more you play
the song.
"King" is not an alternative album. As
Tanya Donelly and company churn
through one stunning modern rock an
them after another, you get a feeling that
she wants to be more than a semi-well
known rock singer.
No longer satisfied with being just an
other Star, Donelly's new ambition is to be
pop's new King. On "The Bees," she proud
ly announces, "Beware of me." And with an
album as stingingly powerful as "King,"
we'd better watch out.
