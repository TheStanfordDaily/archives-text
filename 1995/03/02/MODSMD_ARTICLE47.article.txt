# St. Johnny almost finds its sound

### 
There's a song on St. Johnny's new album
called "Rip Off" in which guitarist Bill Whit
ten sings "I quit my job as a rock 'n' roll
whore." He must have recorded "Let It Come
Down" before doing so, because St. Johnny
remains one of those bands that are astute at
swiping parts

"Rip Off"
St. Johnny

of the signa
ture sounds of
other, more
distinctive
bands — but
not quite in-

corporating
them to create a sound of their own.
St. Johnny's first two albums, "High As A
Kite" and "Speed Is Dreaming," melded
Pavement-like tunefulness with huge, at
mospheric guitar walls reminiscent of Sonic
Youth, but the only thing memorable about
the music was Whitten's slurred, whiny
speak-sing vocals, which was tolerable at best
and irritating at worst. However, "Let It
Come Down" sees St. Johnny poking holes in
its walls of distortion and focusing more on
writing catchier riffs. The result is a more di
verse sound, but one that still doesn't quite
surpass that of its influences.
With the acquisition of a few synths and
samplers, St. Johnny approaches Mercury
Rev's playful drugginess on tracks like
"Scuba Diving," "Just When I Had It Under

Control" and "Deliver Me," while "Bluebird"
almost attains a preening Ween-like cheesi
ness. Slower songs like "Pin The Tail on the
Donkey" regale us with acoustic guitar,
organ, and a country-western feel directly
transplanted from Pavement's "Range Life."
In "Fast, Cheap and Out of Control," bits of
Nirvana and Beck poke through the guitar
shreds, and Whitten even sounds a little like
Beck, both vocally and lyrically.
For all these forays into other bands'
sounds, it's ironic that "Wild Goose Chasing,"
one of the better, more rocking tracks on "Let
It Come Down," harkens back to their an
themic wall-of-guitars sound of previous al
bums. "Million Dollar Bet" starts out as pret
ty standard noisy guitar-pop, but St. Johnny
throws in a surprising, pleasant twist by
adding in a gospel choir near the end of the
song. Moments like that are strewn through
most of "Let It Come Down," little quirks
that make you sit up and take notice.
After a few listens to this album, I found
myself humming along to a few songs. I say
"humming" because Whitten's slurry
singing style renders his lyrics nearly incom
prehensible, but at least his voice fits St.
Johnny's new sound more successfully than
their old one. While better than previous ef
forts, "Let It Come Down" still doesn't cap
ture a quality distinctive as St. Johnny's own.
