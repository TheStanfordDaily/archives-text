# 'Omen': carefully constructed crunch
## 
### 
Brad Laner, the evil mastermind
behind the noise-pop hand Medi
cine, is apparently the main culprit
behind Electric Company, since his
is the only name in the liner notes.
This, and the fact that "A Pert Cyclic
Omen" is released through the
hitherto-unknown label Onion
(which I can only guess is run by
Laner himself) makes Electric
Company out to be one of those
dreaded Artistic Solo Projects to be
stomached only by ardent fans of
Laner's work. However, while a
quick glance at the track titles, all
anagrams of "Electric Company,"
suggests otherwise, this is a ad
mirably well-conceived, diverse
album. Not surprisingly, however,
this is not alt-rock radio fare.
Laner has always been interested

in guitar noise, as his abrasive work with Med
icine shows. But as Electric Company he has
made an album of carefully constructed am
bient sound. The expansive, unstructured
drifting drones coupled with often arrhyth
mic drum tracks sound at times like a combi
nation of ambient-noise luminaries Aphex
Twin, Main and Brise-Glace. The sheer alien
ness of the sounds contained within sonic lay-

ers — every
thing sounds
familiar, but
you can't quite
place it — is
what gives
Electric Com-

pany is unique style. An example is "Come
Circa Plenty," which at tlrjit sounds as if Laner
did nothing more than go outside and tape a
bunch of noise off the street, eventually grows
into an entirely new listening experience, coa
lescing into a steady percussive beat.
Two types of tracks abound on this album.

First, there are tracks like "FA. Intercom
Cycle" and "Cyclic Fee Matron," which envel
op you in warm, chiming sounds, letting your
ears rest in between the music like waves on
an ocean. Then, just when you feel settled in,
the heavier percussive tracks leap on you. The
title track combines strange howls with tribal
sounding percussion that would not sound
out of place in a Nine Inch Nails album, while
"Electro Amp Cynic" sounds like a night
spent inside a lounge bar on an another plan
et, with jazzy drums reminiscent of popcorn
and strange sampled voices in the back
ground.
Electric Company makes Medicine sound
like a side-project: the few "instrumental"
tracks Laner has done with that band pale in
comparison to anything here. As a sucker for
ambient music, I enjoy studying to it. Of
course, Electric Company isn't for everyone.
However, if you like your music adventurous,
don't hesitate to pick up this disc.
