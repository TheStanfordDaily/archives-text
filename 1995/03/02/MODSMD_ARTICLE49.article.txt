# Mother May I please pass on this one?

### 
Louisville is the name of a great baseball
bat. Nashville is the name of the country
music capital. Watsonville is the name of a
city near here. What, then, is "Splitsville"? A
bad album by Mother May I.
The choruses are the thick of the lyrics.
Mother May I seems to have found a good
pattern of rhyming words that they really like
and singing the life out of them. Every two
or three-line chorus is repeated at least four
times by lead singer Damon Hennessey.
He also takes one word or line from the
chorus and sings it over and over and over
and over again. In the end, the combined
amount of time taken up by the verses is less
than the seemingly endless choruses.
For a band with a professional record
label, Mother May I has extremely immature

lyrics. Their lines are short and simple like a
child's first poem, and the rhyming is
painfully predictable.

In"In Be
tween," the
first six lines
of the song
are: "I turn the
dishes in the
sink/ And I

"Splitsville"

don't need time to think/ But 1 got nothing
left to lose/ Now I'm polishing my shoes/ So
clean/ And I'm so in between." I am not sure
what these lines mean, but I know that they
must have to do something with relation
ships —as this is Mother May Is only lyrical
theme. The group sing about couples break
ing up and all that comes with it: Looking at
pictures and reflecting about the good times;

picking up your stuff at the other's place; try
ing to be just friends; and being depressed

because she left. This is old hat — it has
been done at least five thousand times
before — and these guys do not add
anything new to it. I
Their musical technique... well, it '
was a good attempt. Mother May I re
ally loves electric guitars but unfortu-

nately they have not put in enough time to
fully develop their skills.

Like the choruses, the guitar constitutes
the bulk of the music and is accompanied by
a moronic drum beat and the same bass line
in every song. Except for a token appearance
of the harmonica in "All the Way In,"no other
instruments are used on "Splitsville."
For this album, it is negsville. Mother May
I give them a really limp Ho Tow?
