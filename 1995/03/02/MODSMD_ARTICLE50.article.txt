# Ivy's 'Realistic' bittersweet music works best when it is pretty and not precious
## 
### 
With its debut EP "Lately," the Paris
meets-New York trio Ivy made a sparkling
first impression last year. The five track of
fering featured smooth pop ditties which
were as tasty as they were tasteful. "Lately"
was a sly, slick piece of work, combining the
matured angst of French singer Dominique
Durand's vo-

"Realistic"
Ivy

cals with crisp
guitar to make
the kind of
tunes that
were pretty
without being
precious.

So Ivy's new LP "Realistic" hears the bur
den of making good on the first album's
promise. And to some degree, "Realistic"
succeeds, churning out enough charmers to
fill another EP and then some. The ingredi
ents which made "Lately" a splendid effort
are distinctively present this time around:
Durand's accented voice floating along side
the brisk rhythms, delivering lyrics from
her wounded heart in a way that belies yet
works with the pleasant music around it.
At the start, Ivy shows off the best of its
bittersweet fare with the zingy number
"Get Enough." Guitarist Adam Chase

shuffles and skitters as Durand prances
around vocally, serving up bratty lines like
"I can be a monster if I want to be" that
sound like pouts as much as threats. "No
Guarantee" follows close on the heels of
"Get Enough"; it's another skittish, lovely
dovey pop tune where Durand's at-ease
voice balances the embarrassing with the
natural, selling the gooey chorus of "1 want
you back/No guarantee forever" without
wincing. "15 Seconds" and "Beautiful" are
further proof that Ivy is good at the simple
things it does.
However, the band runs into some prob
lems when it trades in the pristine pop ditty
for the sullen ballad. It's not that these
moodier pieces aren't well-conceived; if
anything, they're more carefully and better
crafted than the punchier tunes. They just
go a little too long, become a little too repet
itive and lose the listener's attention. Songs
like "Decay" and "Point of View" have their
moments, but fade away sounding boring
more than sounding bored. They're not re
ally blemishes, rather worthy experiments
which are a bit unfocused.
Besides, who can blame a band that tries
hard to be too good?
