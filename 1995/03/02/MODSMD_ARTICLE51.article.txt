# 'Nina' — an old-fashioned romance
## 
### 
It's four in the morning; it's dark out; I've
been slaving over a French presentation for
the past four days; I'm tired and sick. I'm a
Stanford student and now I have to write a
review of a movie whose very title is dripping
with sex. I can understand why no one dates
at this school.

So here we go.
"Nina Takes a
Lover." It's pretty
self-explanatory.
Nina (Laura San
Giacomo) is a

Nina
Takes a
Lover

youngish woman — I would even venture to
say she's a yuppie — who lives in a really nice
apartment in San Francisco. She likes ball
room dancing, she runs a trendy shoe store,
she eats big, red, juicy apples for lunch every
day in the Golden Gate park by the Asian Art
Museum (ah, fond memories of past art his
tory papers).
Anyway, it's on the park benches that Nina
finds the photographer (Paul Rhys), a myste
rious, sexy, funny Brit with whom she begins
— gasp — a whirlwind affair.
He comes to her store one day when she
doesn't appear at lunch (it's raining out), and
they have sex in the back room on a ladder.
Sigh.
It's a really cute film. Nobody gets hurt,
nobody dies. Nina's friend, played energeti

cally by Cristi Conaway, runs into marital
problems when she has an affair with the
comical Paulie (Fisher Stevens), a skanky
sort of fellow who works in a coffee shop,
lives with his mother and steals Nina's un
derwear when they borrow her apartment
for a tryst. Things kind of don't work out for
Nina and her lover, but to say anything more
would give away the film's secret.
Yes, another film with an unexpected
twist. "Nina Takes a Lover" is more about re
lationships and character development than
plot, but the sudden forced change of our
perception does give it a bit of spice.
Mostly, though, we get to watch Nina and
the photographer do romantic things for and
with each other (one quite memorable scene
involves a long, red silk scarf) and talk to a
journalist (Michael O'Keefe) who is writing a
series on marriage in the '90s.
"Nina Takes a Lover," really captures the
San Francisco atmosphere (even if uninten
tionally). More importantly, I suppose, the
film is brimming with that warm, fuzzy feel
ing people get when they fall in love, have to
go through trials (insert scary music here) to
sustain passion, but triumph in the end.
Boy meets girl, boy fights for girl, boy
wins girl.
The end.
