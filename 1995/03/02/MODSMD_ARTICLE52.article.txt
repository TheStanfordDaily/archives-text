# A 						family battling the pangs of the New Zeland Urban Sprawl

Ever wonder what could have been if the
native backdrop of lane Campion's New
Zealand classic "The Piano" had come to life?
What if the little brown ones did more than

Once
Were
Warriors

divide their days between fetching heavy ob
jects for white settlers and running around
playing doctor in the forest? What if they,
dare 1 suggest it, actually had lives?
"Once Were Warriors," a tale of a contem
porary Maori family living in urban New
Zealand, gives us just that. Based on a con
troversial novel by Alan Duff, this film offers
a raw vision of the Heke family. Beth (Rena
Owen) a beautiful, strong-willed mother of
five struutiles to maintain a home for her

family while Jake (Temuera Morrison), her
over-virile husband, spends most of his time
at a local pub chugging beer with his buddies.
Home life is chaotic, and both physical
and alcohol abuse reign as the prime causes.
As a result, the three eldest children each have
their own crosses to bear. Nig (Julian Ara
hanga) decides to run with a local gang but
must pass its brutal entrance exam before
he's admitted. And after numerous encoun
ters with the law, Boogie (Taungaroa Emile),
is sent off to a state home for delinquent
boys. Even thirteen year-old Grace, resident
artist and peace keeper, is not left untouched.
When a cruel sequence of events leaves the
entire household scarred, Beth must reach
out to her extended family and for her Maori
roots to survive the trauma. The jagged edges
of this film, the raw quality of the lead per
formances and its frank examination of the
pathos of Maori urban life make it quite
powerful. While the gravity of the Heke's
connection to their indigenous past is un
evenly portrayed — the bulk appearing at the
end of the story — the film does narrowly es
cape being sentimental or preachy.
In scenes like the one where Boogie learns
ancient Maori battle techniques, we see how

ancestral practices can enrich modern life.
Aside from the sheer beauty of form, for
youths like Boogie these retentions arc cru
cial to a conception of the self. In the end, we
are left with a compelling meditation on the
lives of a people who, once, were warriors.
