## 'Tom and Viv' gives stirring depiction of the unraveling of Eliot's marriage 
### 
In the new film "Tom and Viv" the
macabre modernist preoccupation with
____________ the notions of

Tom
and Viv

disease and
insanity, cou
pled with the
unspeakable
legacy of the
first world

war, provide chilling elements that con
found the boundaries between daily life
and poetic art of the movement's celebrat
ed proponent, T.S. Eliot (Willem Dafoe).
"Tom and Viv" finds angstful connec
tions in Eliot's marriage to Vivienne
Haigh-Wood (Miranda Richardson) be
tween 1914 and 1947. Outspoken and po
litically ahead of her time, Viv is a viva
cious young woman whose upper-class
family nonetheless represents the old
school British stock that Americans long
feverishly to be a part of.
In a fascinating role reversal, it is the in
domitable energy of the Briton teetering
on the brink of breakdown that constantly
unnerves the Yankee's stiff-upper-lip pre
tensions. Beset with menstrual bleeding
due to hormonal imbalances, Viv seeks
desperate relief in prescribed drugs at the
cost of mental side-effects.
To learn the part of the proper English
man demands Eliot to balk speechlessly at
the sheets soiled by a bout of Viv's affliction
during their honeymoon. Afterward, Eliot
takes a stroll to the beach and returns with
his shoes dripping wet, presumably having
purged his soul of unclean sexuality.
Terrorized by the unabated forces of gy
necology. Eliot's eventual conversion to

the pious doctrines of the Anglo-Catholic
church seems inevitable. That the church
may be the safest refuge from the messier
manifestations of the human condition
makes for considerable irony in Eliot's
case, for his is a gesture of intellectual re
gression from modernity that harkens cen
turies back to the medieval age.
Commendably, Dafoe's Eliot is a finely
crafted mask of inscrutability, one which
does not let up even late in the film as Eliot
and brother-in-law Maurice decide to in
stitutionalize Viv in order to preserve the
social standings commanded by the
Haigh-Woods and the now-famous poet.
Eliot's ascent in the tightly-guarded circles
of London high society is thus gained at
the expense of its necessary excommunica
tion of Viv, who is now widely acknowl
edged for her input in Eliot's work "The
Waste Land."
The Oscar nominations garnered by
Richardson as Viv and Rosemary Harris as
her remarkable mother Rose are two of the
saner choices made by the Academy this
year. Perhaps recognition for the former's
performance can be justified by the singu
lar, shattering moment in the film when
Viv calmly faces the medical personnel set
upon her by Eliot and Maurice to prove her
"moral insanity."
Writer Michael Hastings adapts his inci
sive, literate script from his play, which was
one of the first exposes on Eliot's little
known first marriage. Thanks to director
Brian Gilbert's workmanlike but quietly stir
ring interpretation, the suppression of Vivi
enne Eliot's existence by the late poet's zeal
ous camp has come undone even further.
