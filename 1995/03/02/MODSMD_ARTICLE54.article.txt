# 'Billy Madison': Stupid is as stupid does
## MORE SCREENS 
### 
"Billy Madison" was supposed to be the
movie that would carry Adam Sandler from
"Saturday Night Live" to the big screen. Un
fortunately, it fails miserably.
Not only is the plot ridiculous and unin
teresting — and the supporting cast com
pletely at odds with the stale script — but
Sandler himselt comes off as annoying and
pathetic.

I he entire movie is disappointing because
Sandler has, without a doubt, a gift for com
edy. His ability to work with extremes while
maintaining a sense of control and structure
has made him one of "Saturday Night Lives"
strongest performers.
However, almost none of these gifts are
displayed in "Billy Madison." Essentially,
Sandler is trying to imitate the path Jim Car-

Billy
Madison

rey paved a year
ago with "Ace
Ventura: Pet De
tective": dominat
ing a picture with
the lead's comedic

style. But, while Carrey was able to pull this
oft easily by dipping into his reservoir of im
pressions and throwing away any semblance
of sanity, Sandler's ploy of acting loud, an
noying and offensive only works for so lone.

Even worse, the movie takes itself serious
ly. While only a fool would care about the
plot of "Ace Ventura," the story line of "Billy
Madison" is actually supposed to create au
dience sympathy.
Billy is the immature son of Brian Madi
son (Darren McGavin),a wealthy hotel mag
nate who paid Billy's way through school.
Eric Gordon (Brad Whitford), a vice presi
dent in the company, convinces Billy's father
to give him the company instead of Billy after
retiring because of Billy's immaturity.
Billy, however, arranges one last chance
with his father to inherit the family company.
If he can graduate from first grade through
high school in six months, he will inherit the
company — otherwise, it will go to Eric.
Essentially, the failure of the movie em
phasizes that Adam Sandler is best as a sup
porting comic. While not the center of atten
tion, Sandler's comedy can be refreshing and
hilarious, but when a film is written as a ve
hicle for it, the results are simply painful.
