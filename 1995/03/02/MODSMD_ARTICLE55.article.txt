## Kristie Lü Stout Get back: It's the groovin' return of superfly 
### 
His little white polyester suit still
creams my twinkie. After an iiber
long latency period, Tattoo (of "Fan
tasy Island" fame) is haunting my lucid
dreaming sessions once again. This potent
half-hunk who I worshipped in my pig tails
and Osh Kosh B'Gosh has escaped the heap
of rotting pop-trash idols in my closet. He's
back. Resurrected.
Oh I'amour: It's a retro love affair. Or per
haps it's just a love for the retro.
Not only is Tattoo haunting me. The Brady
clan (New? Improved? Vitamin-fortified!)
has escaped moth-balled syndication to make
a modern-day appearance. Marcia et al. in all
their perky pomposity infiltrated the theater
last week to showcase their degenerate singing
talent and affinity for synthetic fibers.
Davy (As Seen on TV!) Jones is back. The
most mon-chi-chi member of the Monkees

not only has a cameo in"The Brady Bunch
Movie," he also has a role in the 'Frisco pro
duction of "Grease."
But wait... there's more! I continue to
hear the voice of Neil Diamond, channeled
through Urge Overkill, telling me that I'll be
a woman soon. (I'm still waiting.)
Hut I digress.
Something is happening here that is mak
ing me convulse with flashbacks of Michael
Jackson's "Thriller" video. Whether you like it
or not, retro icons are treading back into the
mainstream in full force. Yessirree, they're
back.
Yeah, sure, there has always been a small
ish sub-culture of blaxploitation flick con
noisseurs and polyesterphilesout there, but it
wasn't until recently that membership for
retro-appreciation has reached the mega
multitudes.

This I realized upon witnessing a ten-year
old outside Gap Kids attempt to talk in retro
speak a la Jules from "Pulp Fiction." And I
quote: "I.ike, awesome, that's sooooo Kool
and the Gang." Unquote. Superfreaky.
Seeing Snoop Doggy Hogg sport an Afro
so kinky even Moses couldn't part it at the
1994 American Music Awards further af
firmed my belief that, yup, retro has gone
mucho mainstream.
Oui, mon petit chou, it's trendy to seem
untrendy. And the frocks and coifs on the
runway provide more proof of this übiqui
tous lust for the past. Newish model Chrys
tele recently flaunted her bona-fide Afro in
all her gravity-defying splendor at the Ghost
show in New York.
Besides Chrystele's Afro-eccentric ap
peal, other relics of retro-fabulousity are
groovin' in the fashion arena: Stiletto heels,

tube tops and dramatic retro make-up re
sembling that of the Human League are hot
ter than Captain & Tenille crammed in a
sauna with the Harlem Globetrotters. (But
it hasn't quite reached the intensity of KISS.
... That'll be on the catwalks in a season or
two.)
What is the deal? Why do we have this
fascination with the relics of a cultural past
that were once deemed too unbearable to
acknowledge? Do we really want to listen to
old Funkadelic hits on KSOL? Do we want
to purchase that pair of overpriced silver se
quin hot pants at Urban Outfitters? Is it out
of sentimentality? Nostalgia? Inability to
generate new trends? Or is it a long-awaited
Ralph Lauren backlash?
Whatever the reason, I brake for plat
forms. I go ga-ga for go-go. And Tattoo is just
too damn superfly. ■
