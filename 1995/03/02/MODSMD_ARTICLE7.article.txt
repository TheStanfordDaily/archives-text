# New language center coming
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
A new center for research on the study and
teaching of language will open next year, as part of
the Commission on Undergraduate Education's
recommendations for improving language instruc
tion at Stanford.
"I think it reflects the unusual, exceptional and
first-time high-level commitment of the adminis
tration ... to doing everything possible to enable
Stanford students to achieve the highest level pos
sible in foreign language study," said Ralph Hes
ter, chair of the French and Italian Department.
The director of the center will be in charge of or
ganizing workshops, developing research and
gathering resources for the Division of Literature,
Culture and Language, a new division formed this
year by combining the Departments of French and
Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, German Studies,
Asian Languages, Slavic Languages and Compara
tive Literature.
While the division has an idea of what the cen
ter's role should be, Hester said, much of the work
that goes on there will be determined by the direc
tor. The committee is looking for "a highly-reput
ed scholar and researcher in foreign language ac
quisition and foreign language pedagogy," he said.
According to the letter calling for applications to
the position, "the director will oversee all foreign
language instruction in the University, work to de
velop proficiency testing materials, encourage the
development of computer-based instructional ma
terials and develop interdisciplinary ties between
the Language Center and our programs in litera
ture, linguistics and cultural studies."
Nine finalists for the position have been invited
to visit Stanford. The search committee hopes to
nominate a director by the end of March, and the
final appointment will most likely be made by the
end of spring quarter, Hester said.
The center will be a place
"where learners, practitioners and
researchers" of language can
meet, Hester said. "There is no
place on campus with such a sim
ple thing as a room of scholarly
materials in second-language
acquisition where students and
teachers and researchers can
meet.
"This will be a site where people
concerned with language learning
... can get together," he said.
With the available resources,
language departments "do very
well," Hester said, "but they would
probably be doing even better if
they had a master faculty to orga
nize what they're doing."
Because of the "intensive" lan
guage instruction at the university

level, he said, faculty members
don't have time to organize work
shops or to travel for research,
both of which the Language Cen
ter could facilitate.
By increasing the amount of
research available and taking place
on campus, "we would like to open
up the way for an immense variety
of different strategies to see how
they can learn," Hester said.
"Learners, as well as teachers,
need to know more about the fas
cinating research that's gong on in
this field."
Gathering research worldwide
"really is in line with our ambition
to be an international university,"
said Spanish Prof. Mary Pratt.
"It's going to allow us to consoli
date areas and people of expertise
and give us access to the best inno
vation and methodology and tech
nology."
The center "will strengthen our
ability to offer instruction in more
languages than we do now," she

said.
For students, Hester said, "it
means they should have just
about as much assurance as possi
ble that they are learning in the
best circumstances that we can
find."
"We'll be more prepared to help
when help is needed, as well as to
show what are the most promising
ways to go," he added.
Hester and Pratt both said the
wide enthusiasm for the Language
Center, as well as recent Universi
ty decisions to strengthen the lan
guage requirement, show a future
of more resources and support for
languages at Stanford.
"I think that the Language
Center attests to the increased
commitment on the part of this
administration to foreign language
as part of the education here at
Stanford," Pratt said. "I think it's
a marvelous project that really is
going to strengthen language
learning here."
