# Stanford MBAs run far on Wet Feet

### Jenn Huie Contributing writer 
Almost three years ago, Gary
Alpert and Steve Pollock saw a
chance to use their recently
learned business school knowl
edge in the real world.
Based on their experiences as
students at Stanford's Graduate
School of Business, the two —
who graduated in 1993 — set
out to provide university-age job
seekers with comprehensive, eas
ily accessible information about
the employment market.
After more than a year of
extensive market exploration and
product development, Alpert and
Pollock embarked upon an inno
vative research and publishing
business, Wet Feet Press. Their
current output of reports on lead
ing businesses, the Company
Insider Series, is designed to
meet the interviewing research
needs of undergraduate and
MBA job seekers.
"When I was a grad student, I
felt that the job researching pro
cess was inefficient," Pollock
said. "Specific and accurate infor
mation was hard to find."
The company's first product
release in January 1995 consists
of extensively researched
reports profiling consulting
firms, investment banks and
high tech firms that recruit
heavily at universities and busi
ness schools.
According to Pollock, one of
the biggest obstacles in job
researching is not the quantity of
information, but the quality. The
information he found in
brochures never seemed to
answer his most important ques
tion — "What is it really like to
work for this company?"
"Rather than spending hours
at the library digging through a
computer, job seekers can find
specific information that deals
with issues relevant to the
research and interview process in
our products," Pollock said.

Wet Feet Press' potential suc
cess is built on the fundamental
basis that its product provides a
critical market need. "From a
career-management standpoint,
there is a big need for company
information," said Louie Fausti
no, career advisor at the Busi
ness School's Management Cen
ter.
"Information is a secret
weapon for a good job candidate.
Students who are well prepared
for an interview show enthusi
asm for the company; they defi
nitely have an advantage over
those who are uninformed. Wet
Feet Press' products not only
provide for this need, but they
also do it in an interesting way,"
Faustino added.
At $15 each, each Company
Insider provides 15-20 pages of
rare and comprehensive informa
tion for job seekers. In addition to
industry standing, outside com
petition and revenue statistics,
each brochure also draws on
inside sources such as personal
interviews with current employ
ees who have recently been
through the interviewing pro
cess.
"I found Wet Feet Press' prod
ucts very helpful in providing
general information," Business
School student Marty Blake said.
"It doesn't replace the need for
[people] to do their own research,
but it shortens the time a lot. I
would read over the information
the night before or even fifteen
minutes before an interview for a
good overview."
Wet Feet Press has introduced
its products to a select group of
schools, including Stanford, Har
vard, Northwestern, MIT, UC-
Berkeley, USC, UCLA and Santa
Clara University. Some of the
businesses profiled in the Com
pany Insider include McKinsey,
Goldman Sachs, Anderson Con
sulting, CSC/Index, and Intel and
Silicon Graphics. The press has
been marketing new products
weekly since its start up.

"We're looking to grow the
business right now since it's the
first quarter our products have
been on the market," said Pol
lock. "The response that we've
received has been mostly posi
tive."
Wet Feet Press exemplifies
the classic start-up business ven
ture. At this point, the excite

ment from the company is a
result of its fresh creativity as
opposed to its financial success,
Pollack said.
A portion of the proceeds from
each sale benefits Kids In Biz, a
non-profit organization serving
the educational and business
development skills of inner city
youth.
