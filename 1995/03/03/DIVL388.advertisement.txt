Dear Hoover Institute:
Tanks a lot. Your bras inside the beltway haven't an elephant's
memory. Or maybe a history professor dooms us to repeat past
mistakes!
Twenty-five years ago, pre-government intervention, the sun
never shone through the U.S. Steel haze in Gary, and river water
from American cities processed film. I suppose such environments
develop talents like Michael Jackson and bypass the cost of photo
drive-thrus, but I happen to not miss those times.
Organic chemistry post-dated Abraham Lincoln and this
alchemist stone whettles a dual-edged sword. The rail splitter,
Teddy Roosevelt, and even Dick Nixon would protect the common
well.
Regulation can drive efficiency. Costly toxic chemicals are
reutilized rather than mutating our DNA.
If you think such measures archaic, have Newt take some
Columbia salmon home to Georgia. Hanford fish will soon be great
night lights. Heinous toxins accumulate first in fat, so he and Rush
have a lot at stake.
Your Silver Surfer,
800 Hood
RS. Please reply in kind.
P.P.S. God surfs.
P.P.P.S. We all live downstream.
