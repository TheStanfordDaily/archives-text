For last relief Irom the nagging ache of taxes, we
recommend TIAA-CREF SRAs. SRAs are tax
deferred annuities designed to help build additional
assets — money that can help make the difference
between living and living «r// after your working years
are over.
Contributions to your SRAs are deducted Irom
your salary on a pre-tax basis. That lowers your
current taxable income, so you start saving on taxes
right away. What's more, any earnings on your SRAs
are also tax-delerred until you receive them as income.
That can make a big difference in how painful your tax
bill is every year.
Ensuring the future
As the nation's largest retirement system, we offer
a wide range of allocation choices —(rom TIAA's
traditional annuity, with its guarantees ol principal
and interest, to the seven diversified investment
accounts of CREF's variable annuity. What's more,
our expenses are very low,® which means more ol
your money goes toward improving your luture
financial health.
To find out more, call our planning specialists at
1 800 84'2-2888. We'll send you a complete SRA
information kit, plus a free slide-calculator that shows
you how much SRAs can lower your taxes.
