TRILOGY
To further enforce the Texas stereotype (yup- we're located in Austin)-
TRILOGY is throwing a shindig for Industrial Engineers
(undergrads, masters, phds, whatever). All the finer elements of a
Texas BBQ will be present, kind of. You can't ride a bull, but you can
ride waves of euphoria, thinking about a future with the fastest
growing software company in the country. You can't shoot animals,
but you can shoot the breeze with the former Stanford students who
founded one of Fortune's 25 Coolest Companies. You can t carry a
gun, but you can carry on a conversation about TRILOGY'S patented
technology that is hailed by the Wall Street Journal as "changing the
way the world does business". You can wear boots and a hat if that
pleases you. You can eat and drink beer.
See ya'll there.
