# North hits West Coast

### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Calling on students to take action to save their
future, Oliver North outlined his vision of the
country's needs to a capacity crowd at Cubberley
Auditorium last night.
"You must [insist] that there be three basic
elements in what the new Congress does," he
said.
"Those three basic elements I believe have to
be a balanced- budget amendment, term limits
and a line-item veto for the president, regardless
of what party that president be from,"he said.
"I believe that if we have those kinds of things
happening in this Congress regardless of who
gets reelected or unelected in 1996, your future
will be better off," he said.
A proposed balanced-budget amendment
failed to pass the U.S. Senate today by two votes.
North told the crowd that along with the suc
cess of his three elements, a "government that
takes less, intrudes less and burdens you less"
must be created.
The speech by the former head of the National
Security Council — best known for his involve
ment in the Iran-Contra scandal — was spon
sored by The Stanford Review, Stanford-in-Gov
ernment and the ASSU Speakers Bureau. North
lost a Senate race in Virginia last November.
"I would submit that even the most cynical of
political observers would agree that 1994 was
perhaps the greatest outcry for political change in
my lifetime," North said.
Even so, he added, "I do not believe that all is
going to be well on the banks of the Potomac if we
simply leave this team in town. I don't trust any
professional politician of any party more than

those they just ran out of town."
North frequently cited the Con
stitution, using it as evidence that
federal funding for the National
Endowment for the Arts and the
Corporation for Public Broadcast
ing should be cut.
"There's nobody ... I know
who wants to exterminate Barney
and Big Bird," North said. "All
they're saying is that Barney and
Big Bird ought to live in the pri
vate sector just like the rest of us."
The 10th Amendment of the
Constitution gives fundamental
support to legislation such as Cal
ifornia's Proposition 187 — a bill
passed last November which
restricts social services for illegal
immigrants — and bills to end
affirmative action, North told The
Daily after the speech.
While "legal immigrants are
important to the future of this
country," he said, "I think it's time
for the federal government to
enforce the laws of this land....
Illegal immigration is breaking the
backs of the border states."
Affirmative action, he said,
"ought to be repugnant to every
body," especially those who benefit
from it, because they are helped in
their success by ethnicity or gen
der rather than hard work and
responsibility.
During his speech, North

encouraged young people to edu
cate themselves "of the reality that
government... cannot solve every
problem it confronts in our soci
ety."
People need to understand
"that one of our responsibilities in
life is not to find government solu
tions to everything, but to be a
part of a community," he said.
North cautioned, "It is you who
will have to pay the consequences
of an unfettered debt, of bound
less energy on the part of those
who would create new govern
ment programs, of those who
would let the federal government
oversee literally every aspect of
your lives."
After his 20-minute speech,
North answered questions from
the audience ranging from his role
in the Iran-Contra affair to federal
financial aid for university stu
dents.
"I believe government-financed
aid to students ought to be paid
back by students," he said,
although he added after the speech
that students need not necessarily
be responsible for paying interest
on their loans while still in school,
as has been proposed by some
Republicans.
Although he was defeated in
the Virginia Senate race, North
said he has no plans to leave poli
tics.
He said he will probably run for
office again after his youngest
child, a freshman in high school,
graduates.
