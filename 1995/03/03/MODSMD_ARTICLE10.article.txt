### Samuel Park Contributing writer 
The best place to spot top news and enter
tainment leaders today won't be Hollywood or
Manhattan but rather the Children's Hospital
; right here at Stanford.
• Big-name media figures like NBC anchor
'Tom Brokaw and ABC Entertainment Presi
dent Ted Harbert will be at the hospital for a
conference examining the effects of the media
.on children. The two-day event is entitled
•"Shaping Children's Values: The Role of the
Entertainment Media."
"The purpose of this conference is to bring
the people responsible for what is on TV and (in)
the movies — like heads of networks and stu
dios — together with kids, academics and chil
dren's advocates so that they can talk about the
effects of their programming on children," said
Margaret Pena, associate director of communi
cations for Children Now, a children's advocacy
group which is one of the event's co-sponsors.
The conference opens this morning with a
panel examining the media's role in the shaping

of children's values. The panel will be moderat
ed by Brokaw, who "is very interested in the
subject and has been for quite some time,"
according to Pena.
The panel will be followed by a roundtable
debate on media values, for which "a number of
top industry leaders will come to talk about
what they see is their role and their responsibil
ity," Pena said. These include the presidents of
The Disney Channel, Showtime and ABC.
"What we know is that kids are more exposed
to entertainment media than ever before," Pena
said, citing a major national poll conducted by
Children Now. "Fifty-four percent of them have
a TV set in their own rooms and 58 percent
watch two or more hours of TV every day."
The poll also revealed that two-thirds of the
children polled thought that television influ
enced people their age to be disrespectful to par
ents and have sex when they were too young,
Pena said.
After the debate, these industry leaders will
be grilled by young viewers voicing their con
cerns about the media. The moderator will be
TV host and journalist Linda Ellerbee. Three

other panels this afternoon and tomorrow
morning will look at issues such as gender roles
in the media, the portrayal of ethnic minorities
and the political socialization of children.
Keynote speakers include Richard Frank,
chairman of Walt Disney Television and
Telecommunications, and Norman Lear, cre
ator of the TV shows "Maude" and "All in the
Family."
"They were all very willing to come and par
ticipate. They realize that they have a very
unique role to play" in how kids spend their
time, Pena said. "At the end of the conference
we hope to come up with some concrete solu
tions."
Stanford and the UCLA Center for Commu
nication Policy are also sponsoring the event.
Mari Bellas, senior associate of communica
tion for Children Now, said she sees the indus
try leaders' willingness to come to the confer
ence as a good sign of their desire to bring about
concrete change.
"We're hoping that the conference will have
a mutually beneficial outcome to everyone," she
said.
