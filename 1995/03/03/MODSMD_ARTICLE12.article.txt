Former premier indicted
PALERMO, Sicily (AP) — Opening a
case that could eclipse recent Italian cor
ruption scandals, a judge indicted for
mer Premier Giulio Andreotti yesterday
for allegedly consorting with the Mafia.
Andreotti, Italy's leading postwar
statesman, is the most senior political
figure to face Mafia charges and the
wrath of the nation's backlash against
the underworld.
Prosecutors have portrayed the
seven-time premier as a Mafia protector
who led a conspiracy of favor-trading
during some of the mob's bloodiest
years in the 1970s and '80s.
Andreotti says the charges are based
on a vendetta against him by Mafia
turncoats and former political allies.
If convicted, Andreotti could face up
to 20 years in prison, according to Ital
ian news reports. Prosecutors didn't
release a list of exact charges against
him yesterday.
The case could extend far beyond
Andreotti, whose Christian Democrats

dominated Italy from 1945 until the
party was wiped out by corruption scan
dals last year.
Prosecutors claim the Mafia guaran
teed the party votes and political control
of Sicily. In exchange, mob-controlled
companies received government con
tracts and protection from police crack
downs. Some Mafia members ran under
the Christian Democrat banner for local
posts in Sicily, authorities allege.
The case could also encompass sus
pected mob killings, including the 1992
slaying of Salvo Lima, a European Par
liament member and close friend of
Andreotti. Prosecutors claim Lima was
the middleman between the Christian
Democrats and the Mafia.
Andreotti, a senator-for-life who
waived immunity from prosecution,
served terms as premier between 1972
and 1992 and held other government
posts in between.
Bowles can divorce
LONDON (AP) — Camilla Parker

Bowles is eligible for her final divorce
decree today — and free to marry
again.
But the man everyone thinks she's
most likely to want shows no sign of
dissolving his unhappy union with
Princess Diana.
Prince Charles and his popular
princess have been separated more
than two years — so the law says they,
too, can divorce without swapping alle
gations and making a public fuss. But
even if they do, it is not clear that mar
riage to Mrs. Parker Bowles is in the
cards for the Prince of Wales.
Camilla and Andrew Parker
Bowles, who got their interim divorce
decree on Jan. 19, can make it absolute
today — or later. Lawyers would not
divulge their clients' intentions yester
day.
Camilla Parker Bowles, in fact,
hasn't uttered a public word about her
relationship with Prince Charles.
Prince Charles, said however, that he
and Mrs. Parker Bowles were lovers
after his marriage collapsed.
