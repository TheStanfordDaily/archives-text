# Budget amendment fails
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate yes
terday rejected the balanced-budget
amendment to the Constitution, corner
stone of a broader Republican drive to cut
spending and shrink government.
The 65-35 vote that left the amendment
just shy of the needed two-thirds majority
followed Democratic accusations that the
Republicans were threatening Social Secu
rity, a charge Majority Leader Bob Dole
sharply denied.
At the White House, President Clinton
challenged GOP leaders in Congress to
detail "how they are going to keep the
promises of their 'Contract (With Ameri
ca)' on balancing the budget and paying for
their tax cuts."
Fifty-one Republicans and 14 Democrats
voted for the amendment, while 33
Democrats and two Republicans — Mark
Hatfield of Oregon and Dole — voted no.
Dole is a firm supporter, and his vote —
after one final, futile attempt to sway Hat
field — was a parliamentary maneuver that
kept the measure alive for another possible
vote during the 1996 election season. To
bring up the amendment again, Dole had to
vote with the prevailing side this time.
"Let 'em try," Democratic leader Tom

Daschle said defiantly a few hours before
the vote. By opposing the amendment, he
said, Democrats were saving Social Securi
ty trust funds from deficit cutters.
The amendment is designed to end the
run-up in red ink that has the national debt
approaching $5 trillion. It calls for a bal
anced budget beginning in the year 2002,
unless three-fifths of both houses vote oth
erwise.
A key element of the "Contract With
America,"it cleared the GOP-controlled
House in January on a vote of 300-132.
Moments before the vote, Dole accused
Democrats of playing blatant politics. "All
this talk about protecting Social Security is
a cover for a tax increase" they voted for
two years ago, including higher levies on
wealthy Social Security recipients.
He said Republicans would soon propose
a five-year plan to put the budget on a path
toward balance by 2002. "Our plan will not
raise taxes," he said. "Our plan will not
touch Social Security."
Daschle said Democrats would gladly
join in the deficit-cutting effort, but added,
"It's the Republicans who are in the leader
ship here. ... We want to see what they've
got."
