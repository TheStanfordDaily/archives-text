## Editorial Uncivil mail service 
### 
The University should
take over the reigns at
the campus post office.

LONG LINES, misdelivered
mail, late packages and rude
service. The list of com
plaints about the Stanford Post
Office seems to never end.
With hope, all this will change as
Postal Service representatives and
University officials prepare to meet
next week to discuss the future of
the post office's 35-year-old lease,
which expires this year. Due to sev
eral complaints about poor service,
renewal of the lease is anything but
guaranteed.
The Stanford Management
Company, which leases the campus
post office as a branch of the Palo
Alto office, should seriously enter
tain other mail-delivery options as
it negotiates the renewal of the
lease.
Although Palo Alto Postmaster
Masayuki Sato recently highlight
ed many recent improvements —
such as more automated mail pro
cessing/sorting machines and new
vending machines which offer
more products — in a letter to The
Daily, one problem will probably
never be solved — the post office's
rude workers. Many of the ineffi
ciencies of the post office would
not seem so intolerable were it not
for the abrasive people behind the
counters.
With their jobs secure, federal
postal workers have no incentive
to be nice — or even decent. If the
mail delivery responsibilities
change hands, the people who
deliver the mail, just like anyone
else in the business world, could be
held accountable for their uncivil
behavior.
The Council of Presidents is
exploring several alternatives to
the current postal service. Sugges
tions include the relocation of some
or all student mail boxes to Tresid
der Union or even the installation
of a mail sorting operation there.

These options seem unnecessary,
though, since the current building
is available and sufficient.
Another proposal under consid
eration is to provide direct mail
delivery to student residences.
This plan, however, would cause
more problems than it is worth.
Many students appreciate having a
constant mailing address during
their four years here, a benefit that
would be lost if mail were delivered
to dorms. Also, direct delivery may
lead to discrepancies in service
among residences, a consequence
which no one is prepared to deal
with.
The COP has also said that it's
looking at turning the post office
into an ASSU business project or
over to the University. Given the
failures of ASSU business projects
in the past, the first option would
probably not be the wisest decision.
Placing the post office under the
University's control, however,
would be a good choice.
Since Stanford already owns the
building, taking over management
of the post office would not be
extremely expensive. In addition,
the University could offer postal
jobs to students as part of work
study financial aid packages, simi
lar to hashing jobs. This way, the
University could use government
subsidies to help pay for labor costs
of the new operation.
Furthermore, although an insti
tution as large as the Stanford is
prone to bureaucratic inefficien
cies, these hardly compare to the
inefficiencies of the civil service.
Turning delivery over to the Uni
versity would greatly increase the
speed of on-campus mailings as
mail must currently travel to the
Palo Alto office before it is
returned to campus. Finally, stu
dents workers would almost cer
tainly treat their peers with more
respect and decency than the cur
rent workers do.
As University administrators sit
down with post office representa
tives, they should consider the
advantages of having a college-run
post office.
