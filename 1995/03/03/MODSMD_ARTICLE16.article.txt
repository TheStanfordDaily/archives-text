Students should be grateful for speech code's demise

AS ONE of the law students respon
sible for writing the briefs submit
ted in the speech code lawsuit, I
feel obliged to clarify several points
raised in yesterday's article discussing
student reactions to Tuesday's court
decision.
First, concerns about harassment in
the wake of the code's demise are
unfounded. The University has had and
continues to have the legal authority to
discipline students under the Funda
mental Standard for physical and verbal
harassment that interferes with a stu
dent's personal safety or educational
experience.
What the code sought to do was to
restrain student speech where such
speech did not rise to the level of harass
ment; the court properly recognized that
Stanford has no legal right to do so.
Given Stanford's ability to act on bona
fide harassment, Steve Gonzalez's com
ments that the plaintiffs did not recog
nize students' interests in an education
al atmosphere free of harassment is sim
ply untrue. Rather, the plaintiffs made it
clear to the court that Stanford already
possesses the requisite ability to control
such conduct and thus that the speech
code unnecessarily sweeps into its ambit
;other forms of nonharassing speech. The
court's ruling that the code was overly
broad confirms our suspicions.
References to the Ujamaa incident are
similarly misleading. The events at Uja

maa were acts of student conduct that
would not have been actionable under
the speech code, even if the code had
been implemented in 1988. Law Prof.
Thomas Grey specifically alludes to this
in his Grey Interpretation by recognizing
that the Supreme Court has allowed
restrictions on fighting words, only
where the words are "directed at" an
individual or small number of individu
als. Because the Ujamaa incident failed
this "directed at" test, Stanford could not
have disciplined the perpetrators under
the speech code. Hence, Esther Chun's
suggestion that the University would be
powerless to discipline students if a simi
lar action were to arise is unfounded.
Second, Frances Morales' comment
that the decision reflects a conservative
trend in the country is wrong. Not only
was Judge Peter Stone appointed by a
democratic governor, but the decision of
any court to recognize and protect rights
inherent in the Bill of Rights is not con
servative. Free speech is perhaps the
most important right ever to be
embraced by liberal and civil rights orga
nizations, ranging from Martin Luther
King, Jr.'s marches on Washington to
other civil rights sit-ins to Vietnam War
protests. Most recently, affirmations of
the importance of free speech have been
witnessed in the protests over Proposi
tion 187, pro-choice demonstrations and
the many protests over anti-gay proposi
tions in various states. Indeed, the

ACLU ranks fighting for first amend
ment rights — even where the party
seeking to enjoy those rights in a group
of Nazis marching on Skokie — among
its most important goals.
Simply put, free speech is not a liber
al or a conservative idea; it is about lev
eling the playing field such that the lib
eral's right to be heard is equal to that
of the conservative. Students should be
wary of vesting any body with the power
to proscribe certain forms of speech
because the political make-up of that
body will certainly change with time. It
is a truism in politics that the legal
rights nearly always enjoy a longer
tenure than do the persons who wrote
them. Be careful for what you wish —
the Stanford administration of tomor
row may decide, as has that of George
town University, that homosexual
groups are not entitled to representa
tion on campus, or that religious
minorities deserve lesser protections.
Free speech is too important to be left to
the political whims of any administra
tion.
Finally, the history of speech codes
bears out the proposition that they do
not protect the minorities for whom they
are often designed. Great Britain's expe
rience with anti-fascism laws in the mid
20th century provides a clear example of
such an abuse. With the equation of
Zionism with racism, the British author
ities were able to invoke the law to

squelch free speech rights of Jews across
the country. Closer to home, the speech
code at the University of Michigan, prior
to being declared unconstitutional, was
enforced almost exclusively against
African-American students. Jewish
protesters reacting to anti-semitism on
campus were similarly disciplined for
painting swastikas on campus sidewalks.
Protection, as student Felipe Barra
gan recognizes correctly, comes not in
the form of restrictions on speech, but
through education. Stanford is a liberal
arts institution where the ability to dis
cuss and explore any and all ideas is the
hallmark of the worth of one's educa
tion. By telling certain people that their
ideas are not worth being heard, Stan
ford runs the risk of thwarting the edu
cational opportunities for all. If we
silence the bigot, he or she will leave
Stanford four years later with exactly
the same ill-conceived ideas with which
he or she arrived. Education is the pro
cess of forcing people to confront their
presuppositions and to either defend
them against attack or to recognize their
illegitimacy. Suppressing speech, no
matter how offensive, runs counter to
the express mission of Stanford. The
court recognized this on Tuesday, and it
is time for the Stanford administration
to do the same.
