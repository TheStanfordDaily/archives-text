## Our opinions of difference 
### 
AN EXCEPTIONAL country this is
— we have diversity unmatched by
any nation in any era, a twist of
fate in our own "manifest destiny."
We have reached a rough consensus
that it is wrong to discriminate; we have
not, however, come close to any agree
ment on what it means to discriminate.
By discriminate, we must mean some
thing aside from "treat differently."
Each of us treats everyone we meet dif
ferently — distinguishing family from
friend from foe. Nobody seriously con
tends that we should abolish all distinc
tions among us, least of all individuals
who have done well by the competition of
meritocracy.
There are, however, particular charac
teristics that are most volatile. For most
of us, at least three are agreed upon as
dangerous for drawing inferences: race,
religion and gender. For many of us, oth
ers are as compelling: sexual orientation
and disability. There are many more
ways we classify and divide among our
selves.
We think we know something from a
person's education, income, occupation,
home address, height, weight, clothing,
facial features and accent. Some of these
serve as explicit proxies for race, or
implicit signs of intelligence, among
other things.
Differences themselves differ. Some
are trivial, others potentially worse. They
vary as to whether they are subject to

change, inherited, visible, indicators of
membership in a group, historically
repressed or the basis of contemporary
oppression. Trying to make every evil of
discrimination resemble racism not only
does a disservice to other problems that
should be addressed, but also renders the
greatest injustices less significant.
It is worthwhile, nevertheless, to
reflect on a few of the features by which
we classify and divide. Whether we
believe it is right or wrong, we at least
should be aware of our prejudices and
practices. We can come to recognize how
our traits are socially constructed —
even, or perhaps especially, the most
basic characteristics we take for grant
ed.
Age. A newborn and a senior citizen
are not the same. We distinguish by age
— one can be "too young" or "too old" for
a relationship, a responsibility or a joke.
We impose minimum age requirements
for everything from driving to drinking
to voting, but we have formally forbidden
mandatory retirement ages.
Birth order. First-born children
might not notice the advantages they
typically are given over their younger sib
lings, but their brothers and sisters can
be acutely affected by the unfairness.
Couples. People who are half of a
couple, when alone, are not quite individ
uals. Couples, especially if they are mar
ried, gain benefits as well as acquiring
burdens. The social lives of couples and

singles are segregated.
Left-handedness. The 90 percent of
the population that is right-handed has
designed the world for itself. To be a lefty
is no longer seen as "sinister," a mark of
the devil or a defect to be corrected, so
most of us would scoff at the idea that
there is any mistreatment based on the
something as mundane as handedness.
Smoking. The activity marks its par
ticipants as rebels and risk-takers, gath
ered in a tiny group, huddled outside the
back entrance to the building, There is
something troubling, though, about the
efforts of smokers to claim for them
selves civil rights akin to those of racial
minority groups.
Beliefs. A few years ago, Scientific
American magazine fired a new writer
when it learned he was a creationist. The
magazine argued this was as justified as
the Republican party refusing to employ
Democrats. The individual argued it was
as inexcusable as discrimination faced by
his wife because she was Latina.
For some of us, a particular feature we
have, or that someone else has, is all that
matters.
What is it about these differences that
makes them matter?

Frank recommends Martha Minow's
book "Making All the Difference."
