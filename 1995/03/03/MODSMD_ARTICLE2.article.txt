# New special-fee amendment proposed
## 
### Beth Berselli Editorial staff 
ASSU Senate leaders have developed anoth
er special-fee reform amendment which lets
student organizations target a specific popula
tion for funding.
Under the proposed amendment, student
groups must choose to seek funding from one
of three populations: undergraduates only,
graduates only or the entire student body. Un

dergraduates could not vote for groups who
apply solely to graduate students for fees, and
»vice versa.
If a student group wishes to apply to just
undergraduate or just graduate students, its
members must explain why the group serves
only that population, according to the plan.
Even if a group receives fees from just one pop
ulation, it must serve all students except those
who refunded their fee from that group.
For a fee to pass, it still must garner the ap

proval of at least 15 percent of students who
can vote on that fee, as well as receive at least
50 percent "yes" votes. Students who vote
against a group's fee can still ask for a fee re
fund under the proposal.
The senate will discuss and possibly vote on
the amendment at Tuesday night's meeting,
according to Council of Presidents member
Mork Murdock, one of 10 students sponsoring
the measure. If the senate
approves the amendment by a two
thirds vote, it will be placed on the
ballot for the April general election.
If the amendment garners stu
dent support in April, it will take
effect in March 1996, said under
graduate senator Andre Vanier, a
sponsor of the amendment.
This new proposal comes just
one month after the Balanced
Funding Deal — which would have
eliminated fee refunds and split
graduate and undergraduate fees
— was defeated in a special elec
tion. Only about 50 percent of the
voters supported the amendment,
which required a two-thirds major
ity to pass.
But sponsors of the amendment
say they are confident that the new
proposal will meet with broad stu
dent support because it is much
simpler than the previous mea
sure.
"It is very simple in what it
intends," said undergraduate sena
tor Smeeta Ramarathnam, a spon
sor of the amendment. "It tells
groups they now have the power to
determine who they should serve,
who their constituents are."

"This is an excellent agreement
because it preserves the right of
the fee refund while addressing the
concerns about dividing the voting
community," Vanier said.
Many students opposed the Bal
anced Funding Deal because it
would have eliminated fee refunds,
Vanier said. However, he said that
dividing undergraduate and gradu
ate fees is less contentious.
Murdock said that the amend
ment should provide for a more
stable special-fee system because a
large number of student organiza
tions will apply only for undergrad
uate fees.
Murdock said he anticipates
that up to two-thirds of all student
groups will apply solely for under
graduate funding.
"Most special fees tend to serve
undergraduates," Murdock said,
citing Stanford-in-Government as
an example.
As a result, the graduate stu
dent fee-refund rate will likely
drop, Murdock said, adding that
this would cause the fee-refund
rate for all students to decrease to
about 10 percent, compared to the
current 22 percent.
"Graduate students take fee
refunds at a higher rate," Murdock
said. "The graduate student rate is
about three times that of under
graduates."
