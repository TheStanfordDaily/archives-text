ASSU Senate leaders have developed anoth
er special-fee reform amendment which lets
student organizations target a specific popula
tion for funding.
Under the proposed amendment, student
groups must choose to seek funding from one
of three populations: undergraduates only,
graduates only or the entire student body. Un

dergraduates could not vote for groups who
apply solely to graduate students for fees, and
Â»vice versa.
If a student group wishes to apply to just
undergraduate or just graduate students, its
members must explain why the group serves
only that population, according to the plan.
Even if a group receives fees from just one pop
ulation, it must serve all students except those
who refunded their fee from that group.
For a fee to pass, it still must garner the ap

proval of at least 15 percent of students who
can vote on that fee, as well as receive at least
50 percent "yes" votes. Students who vote
against a group's fee can still ask for a fee re
fund under the proposal.
The senate will discuss and possibly vote on
the amendment at Tuesday night's meeting,
