Looking for a good way to
escape the stress of your daily life?
Getting hypnotized might just be
the answer.
Researchers in the Stanford
Psychiatry Department are trying
to fmd out the effect of hypnosis on
lowering stress and relieving pain,
said postdoctoral fellow Paul
Jasiukaitus, one of the leaders of

the experiment.
"We are trying to see if stress
hormones can be manipulated and
go down through hypnosis, as well
as see how effective hypnosis can
be in controlling pain," Jasiukaitus
said.
"Many people have chronic pain
and after taking drugs for a long
time, they develop tolerance to the
drugs," he added. "The drugs can
stop working or become weaker.
Chronic pain can present a prob

lem to these people and maybe hyp
nosis can help them."
More than 100 Stanford under
graduates have participated in hyp
nosis experiments in the past two
years. Recruited by the Medical
Center through campus advertise
ments, they undergo a variety of
different tests.
One of these procedures
requires that the subject sit in
front of a computer monitor and
press buttons in response to letters
flashing on the screen. The letters
provide a short-term hypnotic
trance. A cap worn by the partici
pants shows the changes in brain
waves due to electrons connected
to the cap leading to an amplifier.
"We're looking at the effects of
hypnosis on visual stimuli and on
stress hormones," Jasiukaitus
explained.
Another related experiment,
one with no hypnotic procedures,
studies the connection between
hypnosis and imagery.
"We explore things such as the
localization of imagery in the brain,
and how certain processes take
place when you visualize some
thing in your brain," said postdoc
toral fellow Manuela Kogon.
"Aspects of imagery differ between
generating or naming an image;
it's one thing to think of an image
and another to keep that image in
mind in clinical hypnosis."

This experiment describes how
hypnosis can alleviate pain.
In the experiment, the subject
answers questions prompted by a
computer screen, either verbally or
in writing.
"All the questions involve
imagery," Kogon said. "For exam
ple, 'What's more yellow, a banana
or an apple?' To answer, they have
to think of a banana or an apple."
After the student imagines the
object, the experiment begins. "We
measure reaction time. It's like a
video game, and some people do it
faster than others," Kogon added.
In order to examine possible
physical changes due to hypnosis,
another participant sits on a chair
and reads a magazine while some
one takes his blood sample. That
blood sample is compared to one
taken while the participant is hyp
notized.
"We want to see the effects on
the body. If there are effects, then
you argue for hypnosis being a
mental state," Jasiukaitus said.
"The present debate is on whether
it's an actual state or not. Is there
really a state different from normal
states? Is the person just playing
along? It seems almost unanswer
able."
The study, which has run for
the past three years, is expected to
conclude in about six months,
when a report will be released.
