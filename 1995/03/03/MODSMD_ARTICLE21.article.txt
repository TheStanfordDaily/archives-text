## Beavers surprise men's hoops; women avenge loss OSU nabs early lead, never looks back

Stanford 71

CORVALLIS, Ore. — This one came out of
nowhere.
When Stanford men's basketball head coach Mike
Montgomery spoke a few days earlier about
approaching the final two weeks of the season as a
fresh, new beginning, the last thing he — or anybody
else — expected was a 90-71 bludgeoning at the
hands of Pac-10 bottom-dweller Oregon State.
That, however, was exactly what happened in last
night's contest at Gill Coliseum against the Beavers
(7-17 overall, 4-11 in the Pacific 10 Conference). The
proverbial guano hit the proverbial fan. And it sure
did stink.
"We were outplayed," Montgomery said. "Oregon
State played better than we did. This was as poor a
performance as I can remember. There was a sub
conscious idea that somehow, some way, we don't
quite have to do as much against a team that's not as
good.
"I don't know where that comes from because it's
something we absolutely have to get over. We have
to go out and establish our level of play. We have to

go out and play as hard as we can. If you played like
we did, then the results are going to be like they
were."
Both the play and the results were, for the lack of
a better word, atrocious. The 20th-ranked Cardinal
(17-7, 8-7 in the Pac-10) was in it for, oh, about the
first two minutes. Then, everything from Stanford's
jumpshots to lay-ins to passes went downhill fast.
"I thought we were totally ready to play," said
Cardinal senior forward Andy Poppink. "I have no
idea why we played so poorly. I know why we lost.
We just didn't play very aggressively. We didn't play
good team basketball. We didn't pass the ball very
well. We didn't get any breaks."
A swooping slam dunk by Poppink gave the Car
dinal an early — very early — 4-3 advantage, and it
appeared that the NCAA tournament hopefuls from
Palo Alto were well on their way to solidifying their
invitation to the Big Dance.
Things turned sour fast, however, as Oregon
State went on an 18-4 run. In that span, the Cardi
nal made just l-of-12 from the field. That Beaver
run was quickly followed by another as Oregon State
tore off another 10 points to Stanford's two. You get
the idea.
"Oregon State made some shots early," Mont
gomery said. "They got us back on our heels. Men
tally, we just were not very good."
The Cardinal shot a miserable 32.1 percent in the
first half, and had as many field goals, nine, as

turnovers. Meanwhile, the rabid
Beavers from hell converted a
scorching 60.7 percent from the
field and 4-of-5 from three-point
land.
Head Beaver, forward Brent
Barry, had the Gill Coliseum
goons on their feet with his long
range bombs and high-flying jams.
Barry, a very likely first-round
NBA draft pick, had 19 first-half
points en route to a career-high 33
points for the game.
"We allowed Barry to get 33,"
Montgomery said. "That was
something that we really tried to
make a priority of— defending
him, but we did not answer there."
There was little relief for Stan
ford in the second half. While Ore
gon State's shooting cooled down
to 37 percent, the Cardinal's woes
continued with missed lay-ups and
errant passes.
The closest the Cardinal ever
got was within 11 with 14:35 left
to play in the game. But costly mis
takes by Stanford and timely treys

by Barry sealed the Cardinal's dis
mal fate.
The Cardinal finished with 21
turnovers against just 22 field
goals and 10 assists. The lone
bright spot was point guard Brevin
Knight's 26 points and six assists.
But even Knight, who at times
appeared to be single-handedly
carrying the team, struggled with
six turnovers.
"You never see a loss coming,"
Knight said. "I thought we were
ready to play, but I guess we
weren't. They played well, but we
just didn't play the way Stanford
plays. I don't know why or what
happened. They just beat us."
This was something that the
Cardinal neither wanted nor
expected.
"Obviously, we weren't pre
pared, and that's my job, my
responsibility," Montgomery said.
"We weren't ready to play. I hon
estly thought we understood what
we needed to get done and how
important this was, but that
wasn't the case. It's discouraging
from my standpoint because it
looks like we've never been on a
practice floor. We looked like we
hadn't been trained to do any
thing.

"Important" is an understate
ment. With the NCAA tourna
ment selections scheduled to be
released in less than two weeks,
Stanford was hoping to establish
itself as a big-time squad. That did
not happen last night. With a
tough match up against Oregon
Saturday night, the defeat to the
Beavers was not just ill-timed, but
probably the worst thing that
could have happened.
"[The loss] could be the kind of
game that puts us in the bubble,"
Poppink said. "Hopefully, it won't
mean a whole lot. It gives us a
sense of urgency. It wakes us up a
little bit in that we do have to play
good ball and win the last games."
The Ducks (17-7, 9-7 in the
Pac-10) are coming off a 13-point
victory against Cal, and they too
have their eyes set on an NCAA
tournament berth. A game that
was important to begin with, espe
cially for the Ducks, now has mon
umental consequences to both
teams because of the Cardinal's
10S8.
"This makes all last three
games important," Knight said. "I
refuse to play in the NIT again.
It's all about what we want to do.
We want to play in the NIT, we'll

blow all these games. We want to
play in the NCAAs, we'll win."
And as if the stakes weren't
high enough already, Saturday
night's game will be the final home
game for eight Oregon seniors.
What that means is Stanford will
also have to contend with a rau
cous McArthur Court (also known
as the Pit) crowd that will no
doubt be pumped up for its Senior
Salute night.
"The Oregon game is even a
little more important now from
the standpoint of what we need to
do," Montgomery said. "We need
to reestablish ourselves as a qual
ity team. Not only does the effort
have to be there, but our execu
tion has to be there. We can't go
into Oregon and just because we
play hard, all of a sudden expect
them to roll over. We have to do
all kinds of things that we didn't
do tonight [against Oregon
State]."
The Ducks — and especially
their seniors — probably won't be
playing dead too much. Williams,
who along with backcourt mate
Kenya Wilkins, was badly embar
rassed in a 92-87 loss earlier this
season to Stanford. Supposedly
one of the premier guard combi

nations in the league, Williams
and Wilkins were outscored by
Stanford's own dynamic guard
duo of Knight and Dion Cross 57-
20.
In a game which is beginning to

look frighteningly like a make-or
break game for both teams, a
repeat would be most welcome.
Holding on to a few old things
might serve Stanford well, even in
if it is a "new" two-week season.

Oregon State 90
Stanford 71

CORVALLIS, Ore. — This one came out of
nowhere.
When Stanford men's basketball head coach Mike
Montgomery spoke a few days earlier about
approaching the final two weeks of the season as a
fresh, new beginning, the last thing he — or anybody
else — expected was a 90-71 bludgeoning at the
hands of Pac-10 bottom-dweller Oregon State.
That, however, was exactly what happened in last
night's contest at Gill Coliseum against the Beavers
(7-17 overall, 4-11 in the Pacific 10 Conference). The
proverbial guano hit the proverbial fan. And it sure
did stink.
"We were outplayed," Montgomery said. "Oregon
State played better than we did. This was as poor a
performance as I can remember. There was a sub
conscious idea that somehow, some way, we don't
quite have to do as much against a team that's not as
good.
"I don't know where that comes from because it's
something we absolutely have to get over. We have
to go out and establish our level of play. We have to

go out and play as hard as we can. If you played like
we did, then the results are going to be like they
were."
Both the play and the results were, for the lack of
a better word, atrocious. The 20th-ranked Cardinal
(17-7, 8-7 in the Pac-10) was in it for, oh, about the
first two minutes. Then, everything from Stanford's
jumpshots to lay-ins to passes went downhill fast.
"I thought we were totally ready to play," said
Cardinal senior forward Andy Poppink. "I have no
idea why we played so poorly. I know why we lost.
We just didn't play very aggressively. We didn't play
good team basketball. We didn't pass the ball very
well. We didn't get any breaks."
A swooping slam dunk by Poppink gave the Car
dinal an early — very early — 4-3 advantage, and it
appeared that the NCAA tournament hopefuls from
Palo Alto were well on their way to solidifying their
invitation to the Big Dance.
Things turned sour fast, however, as Oregon
State went on an 18-4 run. In that span, the Cardi
nal made just l-of-12 from the field. That Beaver
run was quickly followed by another as Oregon State
tore off another 10 points to Stanford's two. You get
the idea.
"Oregon State made some shots early," Mont
gomery said. "They got us back on our heels. Men
tally, we just were not very good."
The Cardinal shot a miserable 32.1 percent in the
first half, and had as many field goals, nine, as

turnovers. Meanwhile, the rabid
Beavers from hell converted a
scorching 60.7 percent from the
field and 4-of-5 from three-point
land.
Head Beaver, forward Brent
Barry, had the Gill Coliseum
goons on their feet with his long
range bombs and high-flying jams.
Barry, a very likely first-round
NBA draft pick, had 19 first-half
points en route to a career-high 33
points for the game.
"We allowed Barry to get 33,"
Montgomery said. "That was
something that we really tried to
make a priority of— defending
him, but we did not answer there."
There was little relief for Stan
ford in the second half. While Ore
gon State's shooting cooled down
to 37 percent, the Cardinal's woes
continued with missed lay-ups and
errant passes.
The closest the Cardinal ever
got was within 11 with 14:35 left
to play in the game. But costly mis
takes by Stanford and timely treys

by Barry sealed the Cardinal's dis
mal fate.
The Cardinal finished with 21
turnovers against just 22 field
goals and 10 assists. The lone
bright spot was point guard Brevin
Knight's 26 points and six assists.
But even Knight, who at times
appeared to be single-handedly
carrying the team, struggled with
six turnovers.
"You never see a loss coming,"
Knight said. "I thought we were
ready to play, but I guess we
weren't. They played well, but we
just didn't play the way Stanford
plays. I don't know why or what
happened. They just beat us."
This was something that the
Cardinal neither wanted nor
expected.
"Obviously, we weren't pre
pared, and that's my job, my
responsibility," Montgomery said.
"We weren't ready to play. I hon
estly thought we understood what
we needed to get done and how
important this was, but that
wasn't the case. It's discouraging
from my standpoint because it
looks like we've never been on a
practice floor. We looked like we
hadn't been trained to do any
thing.

"Important" is an understate
ment. With the NCAA tourna
ment selections scheduled to be
released in less than two weeks,
Stanford was hoping to establish
itself as a big-time squad. That did
not happen last night. With a
tough match up against Oregon
Saturday night, the defeat to the
Beavers was not just ill-timed, but
probably the worst thing that
could have happened.
"[The loss] could be the kind of
game that puts us in the bubble,"
Poppink said. "Hopefully, it won't
mean a whole lot. It gives us a
sense of urgency. It wakes us up a
little bit in that we do have to play
good ball and win the last games."
The Ducks (17-7, 9-7 in the
Pac-10) are coming off a 13-point
victory against Cal, and they too
have their eyes set on an NCAA
tournament berth. A game that
was important to begin with, espe
cially for the Ducks, now has mon
umental consequences to both
teams because of the Cardinal's
10S8.
"This makes all last three
games important," Knight said. "I
refuse to play in the NIT again.
It's all about what we want to do.
We want to play in the NIT, we'll

blow all these games. We want to
play in the NCAAs, we'll win."
And as if the stakes weren't
high enough already, Saturday
night's game will be the final home
game for eight Oregon seniors.
What that means is Stanford will
also have to contend with a rau
cous McArthur Court (also known
as the Pit) crowd that will no
doubt be pumped up for its Senior
Salute night.
"The Oregon game is even a
little more important now from
the standpoint of what we need to
do," Montgomery said. "We need
to reestablish ourselves as a qual
ity team. Not only does the effort
have to be there, but our execu
tion has to be there. We can't go
into Oregon and just because we
play hard, all of a sudden expect
them to roll over. We have to do
all kinds of things that we didn't
do tonight [against Oregon
State]."
The Ducks — and especially
their seniors — probably won't be
playing dead too much. Williams,
who along with backcourt mate
Kenya Wilkins, was badly embar
rassed in a 92-87 loss earlier this
season to Stanford. Supposedly
one of the premier guard combi

nations in the league, Williams
and Wilkins were outscored by
Stanford's own dynamic guard
duo of Knight and Dion Cross 57-
20.
In a game which is beginning to

look frighteningly like a make-or
break game for both teams, a
repeat would be most welcome.
