## Beavers surprise men's hoops; women avenge loss OSU nabs early lead, never looks back

Stanford 71

CORVALLIS, Ore. — This one came out of
nowhere.
When Stanford men's basketball head coach Mike
Montgomery spoke a few days earlier about
approaching the final two weeks of the season as a
fresh, new beginning, the last thing he — or anybody
else — expected was a 90-71 bludgeoning at the
hands of Pac-10 bottom-dweller Oregon State.
That, however, was exactly what happened in last
night's contest at Gill Coliseum against the Beavers
(7-17 overall, 4-11 in the Pacific 10 Conference). The
proverbial guano hit the proverbial fan. And it sure
did stink.
"We were outplayed," Montgomery said. "Oregon
State played better than we did. This was as poor a
performance as I can remember. There was a sub
conscious idea that somehow, some way, we don't
quite have to do as much against a team that's not as
good.
"I don't know where that comes from because it's
something we absolutely have to get over. We have
to go out and establish our level of play. We have to

go out and play as hard as we can. If you played like
we did, then the results are going to be like they
were."
Both the play and the results were, for the lack of
a better word, atrocious. The 20th-ranked Cardinal
(17-7, 8-7 in the Pac-10) was in it for, oh, about the
first two minutes. Then, everything from Stanford's
jumpshots to lay-ins to passes went downhill fast.
"I thought we were totally ready to play," said
Cardinal senior forward Andy Poppink. "I have no
idea why we played so poorly. I know why we lost.
We just didn't play very aggressively. We didn't play
good team basketball. We didn't pass the ball very
well. We didn't get any breaks."
A swooping slam dunk by Poppink gave the Car
dinal an early — very early — 4-3 advantage, and it
appeared that the NCAA tournament hopefuls from
Palo Alto were well on their way to solidifying their
invitation to the Big Dance.
Things turned sour fast, however, as Oregon
State went on an 18-4 run. In that span, the Cardi
nal made just l-of-12 from the field. That Beaver
run was quickly followed by another as Oregon State
tore off another 10 points to Stanford's two. You get
the idea.
"Oregon State made some shots early," Mont
gomery said. "They got us back on our heels. Men
tally, we just were not very good."
The Cardinal shot a miserable 32.1 percent in the
first half, and had as many field goals, nine, as
