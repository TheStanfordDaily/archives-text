# Up against some streakers

What is sometimes more
dangerous than playing a good
team? Playing one that's only
sometimes very good. This
weekend, the No. 2 Stanford
men's volleyball team will face
two underachieving teams
which possess the potential to
lash out unexpectedly.
The University of the Pacific
challenges Stanford (9-2 overall,
6-1 in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) in Burnham
Pavilion at 7 p.m. on Friday,
while Cal State-Northridge
comes to the Farm on Saturday
at 5 p.m.
Unranked Pacific (3-7, 1-7 in
the MPSF) is one of the most
recent additions to the federa
tion and has only existed as a
varsity program for three years.
However, within that short
span of time, Pacific has devel
oped into a squad that top
teams must contend with.
"They're a dangerous team,"
said coach Ruben Nieves. "They
have some very good players
who if they get going can really
hurt you. We have to make sure
not to take them lightly. Actual
ly, it surprises me that they
haven't won more league
matches — they have good per
sonnel and an outstanding
coach, but they just haven't put
things together yet."
Pacific fields a very physical
middle blocker in Matt Suttie, a

player Nieves compares to
Hawaii's dominating Jason
Olive. Playing opposite Suttie is
Greg Wakeham, a highly skilled
and athletic player who was a
top recruit two years ago.
Last season, the Cardinal
took five games before finally
putting away the Tigers in a
match Stanford needed to win
in order to secure the Pacific
Division championship. Since

this experience, the Cardinal
has remained wary of the
Tigers' bite.
"We have to keep them from
getting hot," said sophomore
outside hitter Matt Fuer
bringer. "If we give them confi
dence early on, we could be in
for a long night."
