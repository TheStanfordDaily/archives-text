# Up against some streakers

What is sometimes more
dangerous than playing a good
team? Playing one that's only
sometimes very good. This
weekend, the No. 2 Stanford
men's volleyball team will face
two underachieving teams
which possess the potential to
lash out unexpectedly.
The University of the Pacific
challenges Stanford (9-2 overall,
6-1 in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) in Burnham
Pavilion at 7 p.m. on Friday,
while Cal State-Northridge
comes to the Farm on Saturday
at 5 p.m.
Unranked Pacific (3-7, 1-7 in
the MPSF) is one of the most
recent additions to the federa
tion and has only existed as a
varsity program for three years.
However, within that short
span of time, Pacific has devel
oped into a squad that top
teams must contend with.
"They're a dangerous team,"
said coach Ruben Nieves. "They
have some very good players
who if they get going can really
hurt you. We have to make sure
not to take them lightly. Actual
ly, it surprises me that they
haven't won more league
matches — they have good per
sonnel and an outstanding
coach, but they just haven't put
things together yet."
Pacific fields a very physical
middle blocker in Matt Suttie, a

player Nieves compares to
Hawaii's dominating Jason
Olive. Playing opposite Suttie is
Greg Wakeham, a highly skilled
and athletic player who was a
top recruit two years ago.
Last season, the Cardinal
took five games before finally
putting away the Tigers in a
match Stanford needed to win
in order to secure the Pacific
Division championship. Since

this experience, the Cardinal
has remained wary of the
Tigers' bite.
"We have to keep them from
getting hot," said sophomore
outside hitter Matt Fuer
bringer. "If we give them confi
dence early on, we could be in
for a long night."

poses even more of a potential
threat. Despite losses to lower
ranked teams such as Loyola
Marymount University, the
Matadors have also gunned
down big game such as Brigham
Young. Northridge was the
NCAA runner-up in 1993 and
has been ranked as high as No. 3
this season.
The Matadors (5-5, 5-4 in the
MPSF) are led by middle blocker
Oliver Heitmann, a player on the
German National Team who has
extensive international volley
ball experience. Outside hitter

Jason Hughes fires wicked jump
serves and poses a serious threat
to Stanford from the service line
— he leads the league in ace per
centage with .478.
"Northridge is also a team
with a lot of individual talent,"
Nieves said. "They're kind of
streaky, like us before last week
end. Who knows which
Northridge team will show up."
On Stanford's side of the net,
primary objectives for this week
end will include serve-reception,
especially against jump-serves.
Passing has been the primary
reason the Cardinal has run into
trouble in past matches.
"We have to execute on our
side," Fuerbringer said. "Both
teams have a fair amount of

jump-servers, so we've been
working a lot on that."
Against some of the big,
aggressive hitters of Pacific and
Northridge this weekend, Stan
ford must have another strong
blocking performance.
"We'll deal with them like we
deal with other top players," said
freshman middle blocker
Keenan Whitehurst. "We're
pretty confident that we can
shut down their team's top play
ers and contain them. Our block
ing worked great against USC
last weekend. Like with [oppo
site hitter Jason] Mulholland,
even if we didn't block him, we
got a touch on the ball and
slowed it down. We need to do
that again."
