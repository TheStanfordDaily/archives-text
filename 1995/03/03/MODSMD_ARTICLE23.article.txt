# Paye's defense sparks victory
## 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
You've heard it time and time
again: Offense wins games, but
defense wins championships.
The Stanford women's basket
ball team proved this cliche to be
true last night as the Cardinal
stepped up its second-half defense
to earn a 76-66 win over Oregon
State and a share of the Pacific 10
Conference title.
Stanford got off to a slow start
offensively, and seemed to watch
and admire as Tanja Kostic ran
off nine points in the first seven
minutes.
Then Stanford made a change.
"They switched and put a
shorter person on me," said Kos
tic. "And she stopped my penetra

tion."
Kostic quickly found out what
Stanford fans already knew —
that no one plays bigger than
senior Kate Paye (the shorter
person) defensively.
Paye, who is six inches shorter
than Kostic, got in the Beaver
forward's face and held her to
only eight points for the final 13
minutes of the half, as well as
forcing Kostic to walk twice.
"The first thing I tried to do
was keep [the person she was
guarding] from getting the ball,"
Paye said nonchalantly of her
defensive effort. "And then if
they do get the ball, I just tried to
keep them in front of me."
Cardinal head coach Tara
VanDerveer was quick to point
out that Paye was used to try and
stop just about all of the OSU
players.
"Whoever was getting going
[for OSU], she'd guard," Van-
Derveer said. "I wish we could
clone a couple of Kate Payes."

Paye not only played well
defensively; she also had 11
points, nine assists and no
turnovers. VanDerveer, however,
continued to speak to the guard's
defensive ability.
"She obviously realizes the
importance of playing defense
and that's how she made her
mark on our team," VanDerveer
added. "She's someone you don't
want guarding you."
Paye's first half defense,
which contributed to a 20-6 run
to close out the first half, sparked
the rest of the team in the second
half.
The Cardinal women, who
were seeking revenge for their
earlier loss to the Beavers this
season, held OSU to only 28
points in the second half on 31
percent shooting from the field.
Even more impressive was the
fact that Kostic and Anetta
Mollerstrom, who both had 17
points in the first half, only
scored eight points combined in
the second half.
"We had some opportunities
down there late," said OSU assis
tant coach Michael Abraham,
"but they came up with some big

defensive stops."
And when he says big, he
means big.
The Cardinal was nursing
only a four point lead when
Mollerstrom made a move to the
basket with 1 minute, 13 seconds
left. Just as the shot was
released, Cardinal guard Kate
Starbird came in from the side to
swat the shot away.
What Starbird didn't realize
was that her block would ignite
one of the best minutes of
defense the Stanford faithful
have ever seen.
Over the last minute, the
Beavers had three straight pos
sessions to make a run at Stan
ford. But they couldn't even get
the ball near the basket.
Charmin Smith had the first
swat. Starbird added another.
And Folkl finished the Beavers
off with a rejection reminiscent
of one of her volleyball kills.
The defensive effort gave the
Cardinal a 10 point victory and
the confidence it needed in play
ing a close game. It's now time to
see if this team can prove the
clich6 true when it comes to a
national championship.
