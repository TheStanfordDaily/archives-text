Stanford 77
Oregon State 66

The Stanford women's basket
ball team accomplished the two
goals it set for last night. The Car
dinal avenged a loss at Oregon
State and recaptured the Pacific
10 Conference title from USC.
Turning up the intensity late
in the first half, Stanford (23-2
overall, 14-1 in the Pacific 10
Conference) clamped down on the
Beavers (18-6,10-5 in the Pac-10)
defensively to emerge the winners
in the 76-66 battle. The Cardinal,
which overcame a rare first-half
deficit, followed senior Kate
Paye's lead on the court and
clinched at least a share of the
Pac-10 championship.
"We didn't play the type of

defense we wanted to [in the
beginning of the game]," coach
Tar a VanDerveer said. "We put
Paye on [Oregon State forward
Tanja] Kostic and that's where
we turned it around."
The Stanford defense was
most prominent in the second
half. The Cardinal, after allowing
the Beavers to shoot 57.1 percent
from the floor during the first 20
minutes, held OSU to 31.3 per
cent after the intermission.
The tight "D" kept the Beavers
from ever taking the lead in the
second half. Four times OSU cut
Stanford's lead down to one, but
all four times the Beavers failed
to take control. The last time the
margin rested at one was with 11
minutes, 57 seconds to go in the
game. The Cardinal then went on
a 14-4 run to bring the lead to the
largest it was all game at 11.
The spree was highlighted by a
pair of three-pointers from sopho
more Kate Starbird and Paye and
ended with two free throws from
Paye.
Foul shots and blocked shots

sealed the victory for Stanford!
OSU, forced to foul with less than
three minutes to go in the game,
eventually cut the lead down to
four with 1:13 to go. However,
four blocked shots — two by Star
bird, one apiece from sophomore
Charmin Smith and freshman
Kristin Folkl — and the Cardinal
making the final six free
prevented the Beavers from get
ting closer.
"That was very frustrating in
the end," assistant coach Michael
Abraham said. "We got the
missed free throws we wanted but
we couldn't convert."
Junior forward Anette Moller
strom and Kostic led the Beavers
with 21 points each. Kostic, an All
Pac-10 team member last year,
played all 40 minutes.
The Cardinal was led offen
sively by senior Anita Kaplan, the
Pac-10 Player of the Week, who
scored 18 points. Starbird scored
13 points, grabbed eight rebounds
and had a career-high nine

assists, but also committed eight
turnovers. Other Stanford players
who scored in double figures includ
ed Paye, who added 11 points and
also dished out nine assists while
playing all 40 minutes, and fresh
man Naomi Mulitauaopele, who
contributed 11 points.
VanDerveer felt that the offense
could have played better.
"Our strength [offensively] is
the transition game, and we were
not running well," she said. "Our
halfcourt offense looked terrible."
The Cardinal did shoot 48.2 per
cent from the floor, which is close
to the 49.2 mark the team is aver
aging on the season. However,
Stanford did make 20 turnovers
and looked rushed at times.
Kostic had the hot hand first.
She scored 15 of OSU's first 25
points. When Paye switched over
to guard Kostic, Mollerstrom took
over the bulk of the scoring.
With the score tied at 25 with
8:16 left in the half, Mollerstrom
led the Beavers on a 7-0 run. She
made a layup and a three-pointer,

stole the ball and eventually made
another layup.
With the scene looking bleak
and the crowd quiet, the Stanford
defense finally took hold.
During the final 6:21 of the first
half, the Cardinal went on a scor
ing spree. Stanford outscored OSU
by 14, 20-6, to reach intermission
with the seven point lead.
Kaplan, who contributed 12 of
the Cardinal's first 25 points, left
the game and was replaced by
Mulitauaopele, who then assumed
the role of Stanford spark plug.
She proceeded to steal the ball
and pass it to junior Bobbie Kelsey
for a layup, made a layup of her
own and hit the first free throw of
a one-and-one. Mulitauaopele then
hit a short jumper and followed up
with a hook. During a 2-minute, 9-
second stretch, she poured in seven
of the Cardinal's nine points.
With the victory, the Cardinal
now holds a three-game lead over
Washington with three games left
on the schedule. The final regular
season home game for the seniors
— Paye, Kaplan and Rachel Hem
mer — is on Saturday night
against Oregon. With a victory,
Stanford can clinch the Pac-10
title outright.

a one-and-one. Mulitauaopele then
hit a short jumper and followed up
with a hook. During a 2-minute, 9-
second stretch, she poured in seven
of the Cardinal's nine points.
With the victory, the Cardinal
now holds a three-game lead over
Washington with three games left
on the schedule. The final regular
season home game for the seniors
— Paye, Kaplan and Rachel Hem
mer — is on Saturday night
against Oregon. With a victory,
Stanford can clinch the Pac-10
title outright.
