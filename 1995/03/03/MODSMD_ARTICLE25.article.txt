# Ready for Battle of the Bay?

### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
After a five-week roller coaster ride through col
lege baseball, the 12th-ranked Stanford baseball
team finally finds itself in familiar territory.
The Cardinal (11-8 overall, 2-1 Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division) will take on arch-rival UC-
Berkeley (7-9, 0-0 in the Six-Pac) in a three-game
series over the weekend starting today at Sunken
Diamond at 2 p.m. Stanford will travel to Berkeley
to take on the Golden Bears on Saturday at 1 p.m.
before returning home for the series finale on Sun
day.
Cal brings one of the top offenses in the Six-Pac
into this weekend's series to challenge a Stanford
squad which has struggled at the plate throughout

1995. The Bears are hitting nearly .300 as a team
while Cardinal batters have amassed just a .267 bat
ting average through their first 19 games.
"Cal has a really good hitting team and it's going
to be tough to shut them down," said junior left
hander Dan Reed. "They're hitting 40 points better
than their opponents and they also have four or five
steal attempts a game."
However, Stanford clearly outdistances its Bay
Area nemesis on the mound, where Cardinal pitch
ers — despite not being able to reach lofty preseason
expectations — have a 3.86 ERA and are holding
opponents to a .254 batting average. California's
ERA hovers at 5.12.
"In our conference, pitching and defense seem to
be the keys to winning," junior
catcher A.J. Hinch said. "Cal's
got a lot of young pitchers and
it's going to be interesting to see
how they improve this year.
Offensively, they have a great
team and we have to be on our
toes defensively."
Reed (1-2) will start for Stan
ford this afternoon, facing off
against the Bears' Mike Wolger
(1-1). Reed has been impressive
early in this season, posting a
3.86 ERA and striking out 25
while walking just nine. Wolger,
on the other hand, has struggled
thus far, bringing a 9.58 ERA
into today's game while surren
dering twice as many walks as
strikeouts.
Sophomore Jason Middle
brook will go against Cal fresh
man Ryan Drese on Saturday;
freshman phenom Kyle Peter
son will take to the hill for the
Cardinal opposite Keith Evans
on Sunday. Peterson comes into
the weekend on a roll, having
tossed consecutive complete
games against Santa Clara and
UCLA.
"There's really only a couple
of guys on our pitching staff
that have been playing really
well — Peterson and [Mike]
Robbins," Reed said. "Middle
brook and I combining for one
win this late in the season is
pretty disappointing, but we
know that we're talented and
it's just a matter of focus."
Stanford comes off an up
and-down week after taking two
of three from UCLA and drop
ping a non-conference game to
the University of the Pacific.
The Cardinal — the preseason
No. 1 team in the nation — has
experienced a turbulent start to
the 1995 season, playing bril
liantly at times while coming
out fiat at others.
This weekend Stanford takes
on a squad which has yet to win
a series this year. The Bears
were swept at Fresno State early

in the season and have since
dropped two of three to Hawaii,
Pepperdine and Long Beach
State. But Cal has also been
impressive at times, including
last Sunday at Long Beach State
where the Bears pounded the
49ers 15-4.
When the Cal offense erupts,
it erupts in a big way. In their
last three victories, the Bears
have totaled 43 runs. And it's
not hard to see why.
Seven of the nine Cal starters
are hitting over .300, including
three players over .350. Infield
ers John Furstenthal and Ivan
Lewis have been leading the
charge, coming into today's
game with .362 and .358 aver
ages, respectively.
And the Bears' order doesn't
drop off much from that point.
Five more hitters come in with
.300-or-better clips, including

'Cal's got a lot of
young pitchers and
its going to be inter
esting to see how
they improve this
year.'
— A.J. Hinch

outfielder Jonathan Petke, who
leads the team in runs, hits and
total bases. From top to bottom,
the Cal order is one that could
give the Cardinal problems if
Stanford isn't mentally focused.
"A lot of times we play teams
that get really up for the games
and want to say that they beat
Stanford," Reed said. "We have
to want to win just as bad as
they do."
Today's game was originally
scheduled to be the first night
game ever played at Sunken Dia
mond but a delay in the con
struction of lights has pushed
first pitch up to 2 p.m. The first
game under the lights has been
tentatively rescheduled for April
13 against USC.
