## Women golfers host nation's best 
### John Lawson Staff writer 
Stanford is home to some of
the nation's best college athletes
and often plays host to many
other great athletes and teams.
But rarely, if ever, do the top five
teams in the country in one par
ticular sport congregate on the
Farm at the same time.
There are a few exceptions,
however; this weekend's 31st
annual Stanford Women's Invita
tional golf tournament is one of
them.
The No. 3-ranked Cardinal will
host No. 1 Arizona State, No. 2
San Jose State, No. 4 Tulsa and
No. 5 UCLA along with 10 other
teams from around the nation in

the 54-hole, three-day event.
Stanford is coming off its worst
tournament finish of the year, a
tie for fourth place in last week's
Arizona Invitational in Tucson.
Of the five other tournaments
that the Cardinal has entered, it
has garnered three firsts, one sec
ond* and one third-place showing.
The team expects to return to
its winning ways this weekend,
and hopes playing at home for the
first time this year will help.
"It's great to stay at Stanford
and play," said senior Amy
Lawrence. "We rarely get a
chance to play our own course in
competition, and we obviously
will have a little 'home course

advantage.' "
How much advantage the
Cardinal will actually have is
questionable, however. The golf
course has been under repair
throughout the year to improve
the drainage of the greens and
some fairway bunkers.
As a consequence, temporary
greens have been constructed at
the end of every fairway. This
$1 million project is still not
complete; while the new greens
will be open for the first time
this weekend, they will then be

off limits again for approximate
ly another month.
"There just hasn't been
enough sun," said head coach
Tim Baldwin. "The weather
really hasn't helped us out so far
this year. We've also lost a lot of
practice time to it."
Weather permitting, the
tournament will commence each
day at 9 a.m. as each team
begins play at the same time in
what is known as a "shotgun
start." In a striking coincidence,
ASU, San Jose State and Stan
ford — the nation's top three
teams — are paired together for
today's first round. They will
begin play on the 10th, 11th and
12th holes.
Teeing it up for the Cardinal

will be seniors Lawrence and
Jamille Jose, junior Vicky Stra
da and sophomores Andrea Bax
ter and Mhairi McKay.
As is usual in NCAA golf, the
highest individual score at the
end of each round is dropped
and the remaining four scores
are tabulated to get the team's
result.
"Arizona State has a very
good team [evidenced by their
48-stroke victory in last week's
tournament], but we have the
talent and the balance to play
with them and beat them,"
Baldwin said. "We led them
after two rounds once this fall."
Baldwin and his team hope to
have the lead after three rounds
this time.
