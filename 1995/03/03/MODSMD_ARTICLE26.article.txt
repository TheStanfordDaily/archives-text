### John Lawson Staff writer 
Stanford is home to some of
the nation's best college athletes
and often plays host to many
other great athletes and teams.

teams in the country in one par
ticular sport congregate on the
Farm at the same time.
There are a few exceptions,
however; this weekend's 31st
annual Stanford Women's Invita
tional golf tournament is one of
them.
The No. 3-ranked Cardinal will
host No. 1 Arizona State, No. 2
San Jose State, No. 4 Tulsa and
No. 5 UCLA along with 10 other
teams from around the nation in

the 54-hole, three-day event.
Stanford is coming off its worst
tournament finish of the year, a
tie for fourth place in last week's
Arizona Invitational in Tucson.
Of the five other tournaments
that the Cardinal has entered, it
has garnered three firsts, one sec
ond* and one third-place showing.
The team expects to return to
its winning ways this weekend,
and hopes playing at home for the
first time this year will help.
"It's great to stay at Stanford
and play," said senior Amy
Lawrence. "We rarely get a
chance to play our own course in
competition, and we obviously
will have a little 'home course
