# Last chance for NCAAs
## Swimmers trying to make Nationals 
### Ezra Baylin Contributing writer 
Six members of the Stanford
women's swimming team will
have their last chance to qualify
for the NCAA Championship at
deGuerre Pool on Saturday.
Nineteen Stanford swimmers
have already qualified for the big
meet in Texas, but head coach
Richard Quick will use this meet
to give the rest of his team a
chance to prove they can make
the national cut.

One of the many hopefuls this
weekend is freshman surprise
Kristin Nyweide, a walk-on from
Wilmette, 111. She is unlike any of
the other freshmen on the team
this year because Nyweide was
not a superstar recruit. In fact,
she only met with Quick once last
year to talk briefly about the pos
sibility that she might swim for
the Cardinal.
"Last May I visited the campus
with a friend and I just liked the
feeling of the place," Nyweide said.
"It was a hard choice to come here
over Harvard and Princeton. I
wasn't sure where I wanted to go."
Swimming was not the priority
for Kristin when she decided to
come to Stanford because she
knew how hard it would be to
make the No. 1-ranked team in
the country. However, she made
the decision to come out for the
team anyway.
"She was a walk-on in the fall,"
Quick said. "Now she has a
chance to make the NCAA Cham
pionship meet in the 100-yard
breast stroke. That's an amazing
story."
Even in the beginning of the
year, assistant head coach Ross
Geary looked to Nyweide to con
tribute in the relays and described
her as a real oversight in the
recruiting process last year.
"Kristin has been a real bless
ing because she is developing into
the sprint breat-stroker on our
relay teams," Quick said. "It is
neat to have a swimmer progress
so far in one year."

As for Nyweide, she is just
happy to have the chance at mak
ing the national championship
delegation.
"It's just super exciting to have
the chance to compete," said
Nyweide. "I never expected to be
in contention for a spot on [the
championship] team."
As Nyweide looks to complete
her storybook season, other Stan
ford swimmers are also hoping to
make the national cut this week
end.
"Freshman Michelle Collin's
times are the closest to the cham
pionship cut-offs," Quick said.
"She has the best chance to quali
fy in the 100- and 200-yard but
terfly events."
"Michelle has done a real, real
good job for us. She has improved
a lot over the season," he contin
ued. "I know that she will be a
wonderful swimmer here at Stan
ford, and I look for her to con
tribute significantly next year."
Collins and Nyweide are the
swimmers with the greatest
chance to qualify this weekend,
but freshman Evi-Lynn Byer,
junior Allison Higson, sophomore
Jane Kelsey and sophomore
Amanda White will also swim in
the meet.
