# Schlukebir's illness can't save Hurricanes

Stanford 5
Miami 1

The winds were twisting and
swirling, but there was no place
like home yesterday at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium as the
women's tennis team (10-1 over
all, 2-0 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division) soundly
defeated the Hurricanes from the
University of Miami, 5-1.
The third-ranked Cardinal
dropped only the No. 1 singles
match on its way to securing its
second consecutive dual-match

victory. Stanford took matches
two through five, thereby clinch
ing the victory without doubles
competition.
The solid workout perfectly fit
the Cardinal's prescription, as the
team came off a long weekend at
the National Team Indoors and
now heads into a significant one
with matches against No. 2 Cali
fornia and No. 4 Texas.
The lone victory for Miami (4-
5) saw Rachel Viollet defeat
sophomore Katie Schlukebir 6-2,
6-2 in a match where the Cardinal
Ail-American never really got
going due to illness; she fell to 7-
3.
"That was bad coaching on my
part, I probably should have
pulled her," said head coach

Frank Brennan. "The wimpy ones
tell you every time they blow their
nose, but girls like Katie don't tell
you until you talk to them. It was
too bad that she had to take the
loss, but that's the type of player
she is — she's not going to hide
behind anything."
Viollet's quickness took advan
tage of Schlukebir's fatigue, and
the No. 1 Lady Hurricane adjusted
well every time Schlukebir seemed
to gain momentum.
The Cardinal rallied around
Schlukebir, however, beginning
with freshman Ania Bleszynski (6-
2) in the No. 2 match. Bleszynski
fell behind early 1-3 but then
turned her game up a notch. "I
think I really got into the match a
lot more when I got down early,"
Bleszynski said.
The freshman displayed her
athleticism in the rest of the first
set, scoring pinpoint winners and
overpowering her opponent, Caro

line Hora, at the net.
"It was windy, and I thought I
played the wind real well," said
Bleszynski, who finished the
match 6-3, 6-4.
Senior Kim Shasby (8-1) also
stepped it up after a tough first set
in which she and Miami's IjeAnne
Gutkin traded games until Shasby
pulled it out, winning three con
secutive games after being down
4-5. Shasby then went on to claim
the all-important first match of
the second set and didn't look
back, capturing the match 7-5, 6-
1.
"Winning the first game of the
second set may not sound like a
big deal.. . but it's a huge game,"
Brennan said.
Sophomore Sandra De Silva (8-
1) shook off a 4-6 setback in the
first set to dominate her opponent,
Ashley Miller, in the next two, 6-1,
6-1. Freshmen Julie Scott (10-1)
continued to roll, seizing her fifth
straight victory against Victoria
Hunt 6-0, 6-3 while senior Amy
Chiminello (11-0) continued to
eschew defeat, wiping out Sophie
Cortina 6-0, 6-2.
