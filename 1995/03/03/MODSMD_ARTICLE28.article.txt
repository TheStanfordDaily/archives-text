The winds were twisting and
swirling, but there was no place
like home yesterday at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium as the
women's tennis team (10-1 over
all, 2-0 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division) soundly
defeated the Hurricanes from the
University of Miami, 5-1.
The third-ranked Cardinal
dropped only the No. 1 singles
match on its way to securing its
second consecutive dual-match

victory. Stanford took matches
two through five, thereby clinch
ing the victory without doubles
competition.
The solid workout perfectly fit
the Cardinal's prescription, as the
team came off a long weekend at
the National Team Indoors and
now heads into a significant one
with matches against No. 2 Cali
fornia and No. 4 Texas.
The lone victory for Miami (4-
5) saw Rachel Viollet defeat
sophomore Katie Schlukebir 6-2,
6-2 in a match where the Cardinal
Ail-American never really got
going due to illness; she fell to 7-
3.
"That was bad coaching on my
part, I probably should have
pulled her," said head coach
