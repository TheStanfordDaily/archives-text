# But will it hurt Stanford this weekend?
## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
No need to wait for tip-off;
March Madness has arrived. The
insanity will take over the courts
of the Stanford Tennis Stadium
this weekend as the third-ranked
Stanford women's tennis squad
(10-1 overall, 2-0 in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division)
will take on the fourth-ranked
California Golden Bears (5-2, 0-2
in the Pac-10 South) on Friday
and the second-ranked Texas
Longhorns (6-1, 2-0 in the South
west Conference) on Sunday.
The Cardinal steps up to the

net against the Bears after defeat
ing the Miami Hurricanes 5-1 yes
terday at home. The Bears did
likewise on Wednesday, initiating
the Hurricane's woes with a 5-1
victory.
Stanford hopes to be at full
strength for the match against its
nemesis, but No. 1 Ail-American
sophomore Katie Schlukebir
remains questionable due to an
illness that affected her play yes
terday in a 6-2, 6-2 loss.
"She's pretty important," said
head coach Frank Brennan. "Los
ing your No. 1 player is not like
losing your No. 1 quarterback. It's
like losing your No. 1 quarterback
and your halfback moves to quar
terback, and your tailback moves
to halfback ... It shuffles every
thing around, not just one posi
tion. So, I wouldn't like to do
that."
Despite a No. 4 preseason rank
ing, the Bears have not been at the
top of their game. They have
dropped two significant matches
against Pac-10 South members
Arizona (7-2) and Arizona State
(5-2), both of whom the Cardinal
defeated soundly.
"They could be like that the
rest of the year, or tomorrow they
could come out playing Stanford
and get right back up," Brennan
said. "Cal has not performed up to
their preseason expectations but
the season is pretty early and we

don't want to disturb the sleeping
Bear."
The competition should at the
very least help warm the Cardinal
up for Sunday's clash against the
visiting Longhoms. As opposed to
Cal, Texas has fulfilled its expecta
tions for success but has yet to be
officially tested. The Longhorns
did defeat a solid Kentucky team
7-0, but fell 6-1 to the Georgia
Bulldogs, the top-ranked team in
the nation and last weekend's
National Indoor Champions.
"They have not played the
quality of teams that we have,"
Brennan said. "We'll see. We don't
bump into them too much."
The weekend as a whole looms
large for Brennan and the team,
who are coming off a fifth-place
finish at the National Team
Indoors.
"It would be great to come off
the Indoors and get back on the
winning track," Brennan said. "It
would put us in really good shape
for the rest of the season.
