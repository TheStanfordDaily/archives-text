# White Plaza evangelists provoke heated responses from students
## 
### Kristie Lilje 
A crowd of about 50 students gathered
around evangelist Jed Smock and his wife
yesterday in White Plaza, primarily to ex
press objections to the couple's philoso
phy regarding spirituality.
Presenting what they called the
"Christian perspective" on issues ranging
from secular education to moral beliefs,
the couple provoked heated refutation
from onlookers. The Smocks' shouted
commentary also elicited adamant oppo
sition from the crowd.
Senior Leona Wicks responded to
Smock's assertions by shouting back that
he should "ask God for a better way to
communicate with us."
Later, Wicks questioned the effective
ness of Smock's technique. "I believe in
God, but he's approaching these issues the
wrong way. He's turning students off."
As Smock discussed the educational

"brainwashing" and ignorance of college
students, several students walked past
with rolling eyes, some urging him to "go
get a real job."
Damon Jordan, a Law School student,
said that "Jed's a regular at UCLA."
"There, as well as at Stanford, stu
dents make fun of him, staying around to
be entertained," he said. "No one takes
him seriously."
Students expressed such a disposition
yesterday when Smock boldly asserted
that if women insist on being promiscu
ous, they should "at least make some
money doing it."
Smock handed out a free copy of his
book, "Who Will Rise Up?" to senior Guy
Kulman.
"Don't worry," Kulman assured the
crowd. "I'll be sure to put it on reserve in
Meyer."
Jim Hammel, a senior who listened to
the entirety of Smock's speech, said he

found meaning in Smock's comments
about God's judgment on homosexuali
ty.
"I'm glad he's on campus today," Ham
mel said. "He's here showing the evils of
the religious right — showing that just be
cause you're religious, you don't necessar
ily know the definition of love."
Smock admits that he doesn't appeal to
everyone. Even so, he feels his preaching
"influences people to believe as much as it
turns people off."
That, however, did not seem to be the
sentiment of yesterday's White Plaza
crowd.
Smock and his family have toured over
600 campuses across the nation with
Campus Ministry USA, and yesterday
was a return visit to Stanford.
Their tour began this year around the
second week of January, sending the fam
ily from the south to the west with their
message of "turn or burn."
