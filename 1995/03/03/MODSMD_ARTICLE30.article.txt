# Sailing battles powerhouses

The Stanford Team Race Intersectional will bring
11 of the top 20 sailing programs in the nation to the
shores of the Stanford sailing complex in Redwood
City this weekend. The stiff competition will provide
the host Cardinal with ample opportunities to gain
experience in the strategically complicated form of
team racing.
Team racing is an area in which the Stanford
team is relatively inexperienced; the Cardinal will be
sailing freshmen in four out of six spots this week
end. The regatta's tactics will focus on teamwork
and success as a unit, as opposed to the individual
emphasis of fleet racing.
"If fleet racing is checkers, team racing would be
three-dimensional chess," said director of sailing
Blake Middleton.
Stanford will be able to prove its skill against sue
of the top 10 squads in the nation. Saturday's round
robin competition will match the Cardinal against
perennial powerhouses such as No. 1 Navy and No. 6
St. Mary's.
The presence of the Midshipmen, Seahawks and
No. 16 Yale marks the first time more than two East
Coast programs have participated in the fourth
annual event. Stanford coach Steve Bourdow wel
comes the challenge and considers the East's
stronger presence a signal of increased respect for
Western District sailing.
Sailing the three boats for the Cardinal will be the
teams of senior skipper Charles Meade and fresh
man crew Betsy Carmichael, freshman skipper
Danny Zimbaldi and freshman crew Heather Rogers
and junior skipper Adam Lowry with freshman crew
Mara Holian.
Saturday's initial 20-team round-robin competi
tion will yield Sunday's final four. The remaining
four schools will carry their round-robin records
into the championship round, stressing the impor
tance of a consistent performance in the preliminary
races.
Bourdow's goal for the team is to reach the final
four. Stanford's strength of three solid boats will
give the Cardinal an advantage over many leaner
schools. To realize its primary goal, llth-ranked
Stanford will have to edge out higher-ranked No. 5
Old Dominion and No. 7 UC-Irvine. Should Stanford
reach the final four, the team's objective would be to
win at least half its races in the championship round.
"We are a young team. I wouldn't consider us at
the level of the Naval Academy or St. Mary's," Bour
dow said. "We have a good solid three crews. We def
initely could make it to the final four."
