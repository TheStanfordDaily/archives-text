# Softball skins Gators twice
## 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
In an impressive repeat of an earlier doublehead
er sweep, the Stanford softball team took to the road
and demolished the San Francisco State Gators on
Wednesday 9-0 in the first game and 14-1 in the sec
ond.
Displaying the consistency that the team has
sought this season, the Cardinal (7-7 overall, 0-2 in
the Pacific 10 Conference) received excellent pitch
ing performances from freshman Jessica Schulman
and sophomore fireballer Angela Webb. San Fran
cisco State managed only 10 hits and one run during
the doubleheader, while Cardinal pitchers recorded
10 strikeouts.
"We hit really well," Schulman said. "Once we
started hitting the ball, things [began] to go our
way."
Game one remained close through the first two
innings, as neither team was able to score. In the
visitors' half of the third, however, Stanford explod
ed for eight runs.
Schulman (4-3) displayed her strength through
out, scattering four hits over five innings en route to
her fourth complete-game shutout of the season.
The freshman struck out four Gators while walking
only one.
"I did all right," Schulman said. "I made a few
mistakes that would have hurt me against better
teams. I'm happy with the wins but I keep learning
every time I pitch."
The Cardinal dominated game two, scoring in six
of seven innings. After Stanford plated single runs
in the top half of the first and second frames, the
Gators scored their lone run in the bottom of the
second. The Cardinal came right back, however,
scoring a run in the third, two in the fourth and

three in the sixth. Stanford provided an exclamation
point to the victory with a six-run outburst in the
top of the seventh.
Summer Lee, Stanford's lead-ofT hitter, sparked
the Cardinal all afternoon long, going 4-for-5 in the
second game. Lee also scored three runs and had two
RBIs in the romp. Combined with her l-for-2 per
formance in the opener, the sophomore shortstop
raised her team-leading batting average to .535.
Even more important for the Cardinal, Lee has gone
6-9 (.667) since being moved to the lead-ofT spot in
the lineup.
"We started switching things around against UC-
Davis [last week]," said Stanford coach Sandy
Pierce. "With the new lineup, we started hitting the
ball much better."
"I don't know if it was just [moving Lee to lead
ofT] that helped," Schulman said. "[Having] Amanda
[Renteria] in the [ninth spot] protected her, and
Amanda hit really well."
Renteria maintained her hot hitting in game two,
registering a 3-for-4 performance in which she
scored three times and drove in a run. Katie Beattie,
junior catcher Lynn Anderson, senior first baseman
Caryn Okinaga and junior center fielder Toni
Marengo each had two hits for the Cardinal. Beattie
and Marengo had two RBIs apiece, while Okinaga
scored two runs.
Taking the mound for the Cardinal, Angela Webb
gave up six hits in seven innings of work. For the
game, Webb struck out seven Gators while walking
none. She even helped her own cause at the plate,
smacking a bases-loaded double to drive in three
runs during the seventh-inning rally.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal begins a double-header
weekend, hosting the Loyola Marymount Lions at
noon at El Camino field. Stanford entertains St.
Mary's at noon on Sunday.

A Cardinal batter smashes a line drive earlier in
the year. Stanford crushed San Francisco State on
Wednesday and looks for more of the same this
weekend in two double headers against the Lions
of Loyola Marymount and the Gaels of St. Mary's.
