# Fencers look to dominate Western Regionals
## 
### Jason Weintraub Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's and women's
fencing teams have dominated West
Coast opponents all season, posting an
undefeated record against both colle
giate and club squads. This weekend,
the Cardinal fencers will attempt to
solidify their status as best in the West
at the NCAA Western Regional Tour
nament in Long Beach.
The West Coast's representatives in
the national tournament are selected
on the basis of performance at the
Regionals. Consequently, this week

end's event represents the culmination
of the teams' season-long efforts.
Although the NCAA no longer sanc
tions team national championships, it
hosts individual tournaments in the
epee, foil and saber divisions for men
and in epee and foil for women.
Joining Stanford and host Long
Beach State at the tournament will be
UC-San Diego, UC-Santa Cruz, Cal
State-Fullerton and the Air Force
Academy. In previous competition,
Stanford has crushed all of these
schools except for Air Force, which the
Cardinal has yet to fence this year.
"We've beat all these teams this

year, so we should beat them again,"
said senior women's foilist Michelle
Butler. "We don't know much about
Air Force, but if we fence like we have
all year long, we should win."
The only barrier Stanford may
actually face is that NCAA rules pro
hibit any one school from sending
more than two students [out of a pos
sible three] to nationals in any one
weapon. The Cardinal hopes to qualify
two fencers in all three men's divisions
and in the women's epee division.
The men are led by freshman foil
phenom Sean McClain and senior
standout Geoff Donaker. Both should

have no trouble with the West Coast
competition.
"No one [on the West Coast] is bet
ter than Stanford. We could send all
three fencers if they let us," said men's
coach Zoran Tulum. "I expect Sean to
win the NCAA title in men's foil this
year."
In men's epee, senior Doug Vander
bilt and sophomore Chris Connell
should quickly dispose of their oppo
nents, while juniors Clark Bailey and
Ed Jen lead a sabre team that has also
fared well against the California
schools this year.
"We're by far the best program
on the West Coast," Tulum said.
"We're a level above everybody
else. Our red test will be the com
petition at Nationals."
The strength of the women's
team is the epee squad, led by
juniors Morgan Hoch and
Stephanie Wien. Hoch is coming
off a 14-2 performance in a recent
tournament at Duke against the
toughest competition in the coun
try. Her record gives her an excel
lent shot at competing for the
national epee title.
Among the women's foilists,
Butler has the best chance to
qualify. In a West Coast tourna
ment held at UC-San Diego earli
er this quarter, Butler won 17 of
her 19 matches.
"I think I [have a good
chance]," Butler said. "[The foil
team] struggled against Cal State
Fullerton in one match, but that
was just a fluke. We came right
back and beat them in the next
match."
