# Fencers look to dominate Western Regionals
## 
### Jason Weintraub Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's and women's
fencing teams have dominated West
Coast opponents all season, posting an
undefeated record against both colle
giate and club squads. This weekend,
the Cardinal fencers will attempt to
solidify their status as best in the West
at the NCAA Western Regional Tour
nament in Long Beach.
The West Coast's representatives in
the national tournament are selected
on the basis of performance at the
Regionals. Consequently, this week

end's event represents the culmination
of the teams' season-long efforts.
Although the NCAA no longer sanc
tions team national championships, it
hosts individual tournaments in the
epee, foil and saber divisions for men
and in epee and foil for women.
Joining Stanford and host Long
Beach State at the tournament will be
UC-San Diego, UC-Santa Cruz, Cal
State-Fullerton and the Air Force
Academy. In previous competition,
Stanford has crushed all of these
schools except for Air Force, which the
Cardinal has yet to fence this year.
"We've beat all these teams this

year, so we should beat them again,"
said senior women's foilist Michelle
Butler. "We don't know much about
Air Force, but if we fence like we have
all year long, we should win."
The only barrier Stanford may
actually face is that NCAA rules pro
hibit any one school from sending
more than two students [out of a pos
sible three] to nationals in any one
weapon. The Cardinal hopes to qualify
two fencers in all three men's divisions
and in the women's epee division.
The men are led by freshman foil
phenom Sean McClain and senior
standout Geoff Donaker. Both should

have no trouble with the West Coast
competition.
"No one [on the West Coast] is bet
ter than Stanford. We could send all
three fencers if they let us," said men's
coach Zoran Tulum. "I expect Sean to
win the NCAA title in men's foil this
year."
In men's epee, senior Doug Vander
bilt and sophomore Chris Connell
should quickly dispose of their oppo
nents, while juniors Clark Bailey and
Ed Jen lead a sabre team that has also
fared well against the California
