## (*Stays crispy in milk) Mating calls: Sex and the single squirrel 
### 
The squirrel outside my window is
looking to hook up. Fooled by Ma
Nature's recent Spring fake-outs
he thinks it's Nookie Time. And there's
no telling him otherwise.
Every morning since his testicles
descended, I wake up to the wheezy,
horking sound he broadcasts from the
ledge beside my window. In incessant
four-count, he resonates and churns.
Like the unnerving grind of an ignition
key turned on a car that's already start
ed, he announces to rodents everywhere:
I MAKE SPERM.
He wants to bonk, the little bugger.
And in between the fear of waking up
with Jerry trying to mount my nose (I've
named him Jerry after a high school
friend who's getting married come
spring just so he can finally get on his
girlfriend), I wonder if his condition is
not so unlike our own.
So many of us claim to be on a quest.
Seeking some (supposedly) higher order
of attachment, we perform similarly
strange rituals. We tuck in our shirts; we
paint our eyes; we wear jean shorts; we
sing a cappella; we eat pasta.
For Jerry it's simpler: He sits on a

ledge, and he pants.
"Hey baby, let's get
it on!" he calls as loud
as his squirrel lungs
allow.
But still, some
thing restless inside
him — a hormonal
quirk that he doesn't
even understand —

drives him to that ledge with joyous
promises of love and rabid squirrel-sex.
"No need to go chasing," say the
androgens, coaxing his ego and percolat
ing his gonads. "If she wants you, she'll
climb the drainpipe. Just stay here and
sing. And if no one comes, you can
always go hump that cute bike seat in
the parking lot."
But it's been a few weeks already and,
strangely, Jerry's still there, day after
day, with that heady horndog howl. I've
even seen him turn down offers from
what seemed to me like perfectly attrac
tive young squirrelettes. So I'm starting
to wonder just who he's looking to
attract with that whole phlegmy display.
Is he, like a good CS major, looking to
bed whoever'll have him? Or is he look-

ing for a single, spe
cial mate? Could he
be looking for more
than just consent?
I've been
watching him on
that ledge, I've been
following his moves.
And I think my
Jerry is a Seeker.

"She's out there ... somewhere," he
thinks as he squawks.
The question of his tenacity comes to
mind. After all, should there even exist
such a perfect, divinely selected pookie
for the horny bastard, would he actually
wait for her?
Would he really spend the rest of win
ter, a lonely spring and a vicious summer
waiting for"The One" to shimmy up the
drainpipe into his eager paws? Or, when
his epididymis gets so bloated with
squeezecheeze he can't take it anymore,
will he just jump whoever is near and do
what, despite her not being his heavenly
designated other, comes naturally?
Even scarier are the questions of
what happens if he does, indeed, find
that long awaited squirrelmate. To date,

so much of what Jerry is has been
defined by this pursuit that, were he
finally to achieve the sacred paradise of
an unhooked hamster-sized Wonderßra,
his individuality may be squelched.
Could he be the same cute Jerry the
Squirrel without the pursuit? It has been
his core for so long, his presentations
may define him.
Desire being his chief characteristic of
late, will his world be changed when the
semen drains from behind his eyes? Will
it look prettier, or does the glaze paint
the world a perkier color than the drab
reality of those without passion?
And who's to say that getting what he
thinks he wants will make him happy?
But none of these philosophical issues
seem to matter to the rodent in question.
Jerry the Squirrel is not distracted by
the unsubtle pragmatics of love's attain
ment. All he knows is that something, or
rather, someone, is lacking in his life
(and that he would very much like to rub
up against her).
And until that special squirrel-babe,
that furry mystical mama who recog
nizes her future in his black-jelly-bean
eyes, scurries on up, he'll wait.
