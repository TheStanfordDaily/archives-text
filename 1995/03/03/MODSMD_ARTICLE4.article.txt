# Shippin' in the snow
## Non-alcoholic snow party will promote a drier Greek image 
### Emily Bazar Staff writer 
For students who weren't able to make
it to Tahoe in January to get a healthy
dose of white powder and winter sports,
an opportunity to revel in snowy delight
will be closer than they think this week
end.
On Saturday night, 2,800 pounds of
man-made snow will cover the backyard
of the Phi Delta Theta house for Stan
ford's first-ever non-alcoholic snow-fest.
The "Dry Snow Party" — sponsored
by the Interfratemity and Intersorority
Councils and the Stanford Community

Partnership for Alcohol and other Drug
Abuse Prevention — is an attempt to dis
prove the stereotype that Greek-spon
sored parties always involve alcohol.
"The Greeks are stigmatized by an
'Animal House' image" said senior Belin
da Young, a member of the Chi Omega
sorority.
"We want to overcome that by having a
positive image event, especially before
Rush," she said.
Young is the Greek community intern
for the Partnership, which was conceived
in December 1993 when Stanford re
ceived a $147,000 grant from the U.S. De
partment of Education's Funds for the

Improvement of Post-Secondary Educa
tion.
The Partnership addresses alcohol and
other drug abuse problems in each of 10
different campus communities, which in
clude ethnic communities, the women's
community and the Greek community.
Each intern researches his or her com
munity and organizes appropriate inter
vention activities and social events
unique to its needs, said Heather Dunn,
assistant director of student activities and
fraternal affairs adviser.
