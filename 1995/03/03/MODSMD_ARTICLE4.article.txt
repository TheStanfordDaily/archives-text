# Shippin' in the snow
## Non-alcoholic snow party will promote a drier Greek image 
### Emily Bazar Staff writer 
For students who weren't able to make
it to Tahoe in January to get a healthy
dose of white powder and winter sports,
an opportunity to revel in snowy delight
will be closer than they think this week
end.
On Saturday night, 2,800 pounds of
man-made snow will cover the backyard
of the Phi Delta Theta house for Stan
ford's first-ever non-alcoholic snow-fest.
The "Dry Snow Party" — sponsored
by the Interfratemity and Intersorority
Councils and the Stanford Community

Partnership for Alcohol and other Drug
Abuse Prevention — is an attempt to dis
prove the stereotype that Greek-spon
sored parties always involve alcohol.
"The Greeks are stigmatized by an
'Animal House' image" said senior Belin
da Young, a member of the Chi Omega
sorority.
"We want to overcome that by having a
positive image event, especially before
Rush," she said.
Young is the Greek community intern
for the Partnership, which was conceived
in December 1993 when Stanford re
ceived a $147,000 grant from the U.S. De
partment of Education's Funds for the

Improvement of Post-Secondary Educa
tion.
The Partnership addresses alcohol and
other drug abuse problems in each of 10
different campus communities, which in
clude ethnic communities, the women's
community and the Greek community.
Each intern researches his or her com
munity and organizes appropriate inter
vention activities and social events
unique to its needs, said Heather Dunn,
assistant director of student activities and
fraternal affairs adviser.
After assessing the results of a survey
given to members of the campus
Greek community (not including
the ethnic fraternities and sorori
ties), Young and Dunn decided that
a non-alcoholic, all-campus party
would be an effective way to
address alcohol and drug abuse
among Greek students.
"Out of a needs assessment, we
recognized that Greeks needed
social events that were not alcohol
focused," said Dunn, who also
serves as the program coordinator
for the partnership.
Dunn estimated that it has been
at least two years since a fraternity
or sorority threw a party without
serving alcoholic drinks.
"We need to strengthen the
idea that you can have successful
social events without alcohol," she
said.
Young suggested that this type
of social event will also strengthen
the image of Greeks on campus.
"This party will be a fresh
chance to see Greeks in another
light," she said. "The campus in
general will be able to see a public
display of Greek cooperation and
healthy socializing."
With $500 from the Partnership

and additional funds donated by
each fraternity and sorority, Young
organized a dry party with a winter
lodge theme, complete with spiced
cider, hot chocolate, non-alcoholic
brew, virgin mixed drinks and 70
40-pound bags of snow to chill the
festivities.
Young said she expects the man
made snow — which was ordered
from the Mountain View Ice Co. —
to arrive at the Phi Delt house
around 5 p.m. on Saturday.
After the snow is spread around
the back yard, its use will be left up
to party-goers, Young said. She
added that she expects snow-vol
leyball games, sledding on trash
can lids and an inevitable snowball
fight or two.
And, if conditions are favorable,
the snow could last throughout
the weekend. "That snow will be
there until Monday or Tuesday if
it doesn't rain," said Ted Canter,
owner of the Mountain View Ice
Co.
Organizers expect 400 to 500
students to attend the party.
The party is part of Greek
Week, which was revived after an
absence of at least four years,
Dunn said. Greek Week serves to
introduce the Greek system to
prospective freshmen or anyone
else who wants to rush, Dunn
said.
