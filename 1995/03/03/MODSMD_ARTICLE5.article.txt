# Try to appeal, suggests Grey
## Speech code author calls policy legal 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
Novv that the Stanford speech
code has been declared unconstitu
tional, the author of the Grey Inter
pretation of the Fundamental
Standard said he hopes the Univer
sity will pursue an appeal.
But others say it would be a mis
take, citing monetary concerns and
time constraints. The University
has 90 days to decide whether it will
appeal.
University officials are uncer
tain about filing one. Assoc. Gener
al Counsel Iris Brest said she does
not know if Stanford should argue
against the court ruling.
Law School Prof. Thomas Grey,
however, said the University has
"solid, bgal grounds for an appeal."
Grey, who authored the Grey In
terpretation five years ago, said he
would like to see the University ap
peal — "partly to protect free
speech' — and that he would offer
his services as an adviser to Univer
sity lawyers.
The Grey Interpretation, which
constitutes Stanford's speech code,
was struck down by Santa Clara
Superior Court Judge Peter Stone
Tuesday. In his ruling, Stone said
the code was impermissible be
cause it only limited fighting words
that were based upon sex, race,
color and the like.
By ordering a preliminary in
junction against the Grey Interpre
tation, Stone upheld California's
Leonard Law — which guarantees
First Amendment protections to
students at private universities.
Grey, however, called Stone's
reasoning in striking down the
speech code "a mischaracteriza
tion."
In his ruling, Stone said that an
"examination of the speech code re
veals no mention of conduct or ha
rassment as being proscribed."
Stone turned to a previous deci
sion, R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul,
which enumerated that a speech
code cannot single out discrimina-

Tory epithets based on race, sex or
religion.
According to Grey, Stone would
have let the interpretation stand
had it applied more generally —
rather that singling out specific
types of discrimination.
Although the court says the
speech code does not meet the nec
essary guidelines, Grey said his in
terpretation is explicit, defining
speech very clearly and narrowly
and warranting an appeal.
But University President Emer
itus Donald Kennedy disagreed
about the possibility of appealing
the decision on the code, which
was passed during his tenure as
president.
"[Appealing] is a very expensive
and time-consuming process,"
Kennedy said. Furthermore, there
is "no clear consensus it's a win
___ ft
ner.
Brest refused to comment on
the cost of the trial, although Grey
did admit that it "costs a lot of
money."
Law School Prof. William
Cohen agreed with Kennedy, say
ing it would be a "terrible mistake"
to pursue an appeal on the
grounds that the Leonard Law
might be unconstitutional.
The speech code ruling was the
first test of the Leonard Law's
validity. California is the only state
that has such a law.
Instead of battling the interpre
tation out in the courts, Kennedy

said it might be better if the Uni
versity "stayed with the language
[of the interpretation] as a commu
nity standard."
"Community disapproval is a
more powerful sanctity," Kennedy
added.
In its almost five years as the
official speech code, the Grey
Interpretation — originally draft
ed by Grey to provide the Universi
ty with a legal basis for Funda
mental Standard decisions — was
never used against students.
Despite this fact, Grey said he
looks on the interpretation as a
success, pointing to its deterrent
value.
Brest said that because Star
ford is still analyzing the case, she
does not know when the Universi
ty will reach a decision about an
appeal.
Both University President
Gerhard Casper and General
Counsel Michael Roster are out of
town until Monday and unavail
able to comment on the court
decision. Provost Condoleezza
Rice did not return phone calls
yesterday.
