# Try to appeal, suggests Grey
## Speech code author calls policy legal

Novv that the Stanford speech
code has been declared unconstitu
tional, the author of the Grey Inter
pretation of the Fundamental
Standard said he hopes the Univer
sity will pursue an appeal.
But others say it would be a mis
take, citing monetary concerns and
time constraints. The University
has 90 days to decide whether it will
appeal.
University officials are uncer
tain about filing one. Assoc. Gener
al Counsel Iris Brest said she does
not know if Stanford should argue
against the court ruling.
Law School Prof. Thomas Grey,
however, said the University has
"solid, bgal grounds for an appeal."
Grey, who authored the Grey In
terpretation five years ago, said he
would like to see the University ap
peal — "partly to protect free
speech' — and that he would offer
his services as an adviser to Univer
sity lawyers.
The Grey Interpretation, which
constitutes Stanford's speech code,
was struck down by Santa Clara
Superior Court Judge Peter Stone
Tuesday. In his ruling, Stone said
the code was impermissible be
cause it only limited fighting words
that were based upon sex, race,
color and the like.
By ordering a preliminary in
junction against the Grey Interpre
tation, Stone upheld California's
Leonard Law — which guarantees
First Amendment protections to
students at private universities.
Grey, however, called Stone's
reasoning in striking down the
speech code "a mischaracteriza
tion."
In his ruling, Stone said that an
"examination of the speech code re
veals no mention of conduct or ha
rassment as being proscribed."
Stone turned to a previous deci
sion, R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul,
which enumerated that a speech
code cannot single out discrimina-

Tory epithets based on race, sex or
religion.
According to Grey, Stone would
have let the interpretation stand
had it applied more generally —
rather that singling out specific
types of discrimination.
Although the court says the
speech code does not meet the nec
essary guidelines, Grey said his in
terpretation is explicit, defining
speech very clearly and narrowly
and warranting an appeal.
