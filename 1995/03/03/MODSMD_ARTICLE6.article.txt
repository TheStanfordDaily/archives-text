# Comparing our code with others

Among Stanford's closest
competitors in the Ivy League,
the University's speech code \&
a lone soul.
Stanford's Grey Interpreta
tion of the Fundamental Stan
dard stands out as one of the
most detailed speech codes in
the country â€” and for many
elite private universities, the
concept of a speech code is al
most non-existent.
Neither Cornell University
nor Columbia University, for
example, has a speech code.
At Yale University, the ad
ministration went one step
further, adopting an "anti
speech-code" code in 1972 that
states: "To curtail free expres
sion strikes twice at intellectu
al freedom, for whoever de
prives another of the right to
state unpopular views neces
sarily also deprives others of
the right to listen to those
views."
Similarly, Harvard Univer-
sity ratified in November the
"Cambridge Declaration," a set of
beliefs and recommendations that
opposes speech codes among other
policies.
Outside of Stanford, speech
codes have been both criticized and
found unconstitutional. Courts
have struck down speech codes at
several public schools, including
the University of Michigan, the
University of Wisconsin, Central
Michigan University and George
Mason University.
Three years ago, Rep. Henry J.
Hyde (R-Ill.) introduced a bill
endorsed by the American Civil
Liberties Union to allow students
to challenge speech codes at private
universities that received federal

funds. However, the bill died in the
U.S. House of Representatives.
Tuesday's court ruling has
brought praise from outside insti
tutions.
At Vanderbilt University, Paul
McMasters, the executive director
of the Freedom Forum First
Amendment Center said, that "the
big tree in the forest of speech
codes has fallen."
"Stanford University has been a
pioneer in working for inclusive
ness and sensitivity in the increas
ingly diverse campus community,"
he said. "It had some of the best
legal minds trying to craft a speech
code that did not violate the First
Amendment, but they failed.
"Now college officials across the
nation can move on to the hard
work of eliminating hateful speech
and harmful incidents on the
nation's campus," McMasters
added.
