John Steinbeck: A Eic&ranhy
by Jay Parini
"This astute and generous biography offers a vivid portait of a driven and difficult
man." -Sunday Times
From Chapter 11, The Stanford Years: Steinbeck arrived in Palo Alto in the Fall of
and attended Stanford intermittently for the next six years, leaving without a
degree. "Once in college 1 ... got to going to the library and reading what I wanted
instead of what was required. I got so far behind that I could not possibly catch up.
... The rough-and-tumble side of male dormitory life appealed to Steinbeck, with
its all-night bull sessions, endless poker games, bawdy jokes, and generous supply
of whiskey, gin, beer and wine." Two of Steinbeck's stories "were published in the
... Stanford Spectator in 1!)24. These may be considered his first real publications."
