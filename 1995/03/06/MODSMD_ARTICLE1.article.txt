## Ethnic program to work with others 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
The proposed new program in
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity can both work with and
learn from other ethnic and area
studies programs at Stanford, said
directors of currently existing pro
grams.
The existing programs and the
new program overlap in several
areas and "not to include them is
potentially very troublesome," said
History Assoc. Prof. Richard
Roberts, director of the Center for
African Studies.
A collaboration could help
"draw out the connections... that
studies of ethnicity and identity
can have," Roberts said, especially
if the new interdisciplinary pro
gram — proposed in a report by
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
John Shoven at the Feb. 23 Facul
ty Senate meeting — is broadened
to an international focus.
A look at other programs also
may address concerns about ad
ministrative support for the new
program: while directors of similar
programs said University support
has been fairly good over the years,
many noted that they look for out
side sources of funding as well.
