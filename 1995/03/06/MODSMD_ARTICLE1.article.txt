# New race relations
## Ethnic program to work with others 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
The proposed new program in
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity can both work with and
learn from other ethnic and area
studies programs at Stanford, said
directors of currently existing pro
grams.
The existing programs and the
new program overlap in several
areas and "not to include them is
potentially very troublesome," said
History Assoc. Prof. Richard
Roberts, director of the Center for
African Studies.
A collaboration could help
"draw out the connections... that
studies of ethnicity and identity
can have," Roberts said, especially
if the new interdisciplinary pro
gram — proposed in a report by
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
John Shoven at the Feb. 23 Facul
ty Senate meeting — is broadened
to an international focus.
A look at other programs also
may address concerns about ad
ministrative support for the new
program: while directors of similar
programs said University support
has been fairly good over the years,
many noted that they look for out
side sources of funding as well.
Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity would offer rmyors
and minors in Chicano Studies,
Asian-American Studies and
African and Afro-American Stud
ies, as well as focuses on compara
tive topics such as immigration,
higher education or Chicano and
Asian-American relations.
'Intellectual neighbors'
"The new [program] will have
many intellectual neighbors at
Stanford and we will have to be
mindful of the opportunities for
cooperative programs," Shoven
said in his report.
Shoven lists Jewish Studies,
Feminist Studies, Urban Studies,
American Studies, African Studies,
Latin American Studies and East
Asian Studies as possible coopera
tive ventures. Stanford also has cen
ters for European Studies and Rus
sian and East European Studies.
"It is possible that in the future
we will expand the new [programJ
to include some of these programs
as full partners," the report said.

"There are a lot of overlapping
areas," said Kathleen Morrison,
associate director of the Center for
Latin American Studies. "Focusing
in on some of those issues in a com
parative perspective would certain
ly be of interest to us and we would
hope to contribute with that kind
of an approach."
Because most ethnic and area
studies courses are already offered
through other departments, such
as history, political science and
anthropology, many will count for
degrees in Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity as well as
degrees or certificates from the
other programs, directors said.
"There will certainly be courses
we teach that we would naturally
assume would be cross-listed," said
Histoiy Prof. Steven Zipperstein,
director of the Program in Jewish
Studies.
Although broader than an eth
nic or area studies program, Jewish
Studies could contribute positively
to the new program, Zipperstein
said.
"Given the way in which our
program already exists indepen
dent of ethnic studies at Stanford,"
he said, "we would have a relation
ship very similar to that of Femi

nist Studies," a relationship which
he said he hopes will be "close and
intellectually nurturing."
Jewish Studies already has a
good working relationship with the
African and Afro-American Studies
program, a relationship Zipper
stein said he expects to continue
with the development of new
courses. "We for example hope to
have a course on blacks and Jews at
some point," he said.
"I think the greatest opportuni
ties for mutual advantage (between
the new program and another area
of studies) are in the context of the
development of new courses," said
Urban Studies Director and Civil
Engineering Prof. Leonard
Ortolano.
The Urban Studies program,
which does not have its own facul
ty, has helped develop or encourage
classes in other departments on
issues including minority voting
and urban cultures that would be
likely candidates for inclusion in
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity, Ortolano said.
"Many of the courses that we
list in our core deal with issues
related to race and minority," he
said. "If you go down our core, my
guess would be about a third of our

courses relate to ethnicity."
Origins of programs
Support for the new interdisci
plinary program is a concern
among students and faculty —
especially those involved with last
year's protests and hunger strike
that led to the formation of com
mittees to develop programs in
Chicano Studies and Asian-Ameri
can Studies.
Directors for the ethnic and area
studies programs said administra
tive support has been fairly good
over the years. However, many
look for other sources of funding as
well.
Since its modern origin in the
late 1950s and the beginning of its
degree programs in the 19605, the
Center for Latin American Studies
— which was initially founded by
Stanford's second president, John
Casper Branner, to study Brazil —
has found "a sympathetic ear in the
administration," Morrison said.
"Certainly, like everyone in these
tight economic times, more of the
burden has been on us to generate
outside sources of revenue," she
added.
The Stanford budget affects the
Center for African Studies less.

because it has been funded since
1979 by the Department of Educa
tion as a joint center with UC-
Berkeley, Roberts said. The center
was founded in the early 1960s
with a grant from the Ford Foun
dation.
The University has been "care
ful in continuing its support" by
replacing departed faculty, but the
center hasn't grown, he said, until
this year when two new appoint
ments were made. African hum;in
ities specialists Valentin Mudimbe
and Elisabeth Mudimbe-Boyi, orig
inally from Zaire, recently received
joint appointments in French and
comparative literature and will
begin teaching spring quarter,
Roberts said.
In its seven-year history, Jewish
Studies has also been supported by
the administration, Zipperstein
said, but remains somewhat self
reliant in its budget. After the pro
gram was "launched at Stanford as
part of a major initiative on the
part of faculty and alumni," the
alumni "helped raise a significant
endowment that allowed Jewish
Studies ... to grow and flourish,"
he said.
University support of the Urban
Studies program has been "quite

satisfactory," Ortolano said.
Because the program works in a
large degree through other depart
ments, it doesn't require as many
resources, he said. The Urban
Studies program was developed in
the 1960s as a grassroots effort
that "came from students who saw
the problems of cities in the late
1960s as being among the top
domestic problems facing the coun
try," Ortolano said.
But with the new interdisci
plinary program, urban and other
ethnic and area studies will grow,
he said, adding that when pro
grams begin to offer minors, many
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity majors may want to
minor in Urban Studies.
Curriculum and final approval
for the new program are not yet in
place, but dialogue needs to be
opened about the relationships
among the various programs, Mor
rison said.
"I think that [collaboration] will
be desirable, and it's important
that conversations ensue from the
outset," she said. "I think any new
effort needs to reach out and be
embraced in the broader curricular
community . . . We're certainly
eager to do that."

Histoiy Prof. Steven Zipperstein,
director of the Program in Jewish
Studies.
Although broader than an eth
nic or area studies program, Jewish
Studies could contribute positively
to the new program, Zipperstein
said.
"Given the way in which our
program already exists indepen
dent of ethnic studies at Stanford,"
he said, "we would have a relation
ship very similar to that of Femi

nist Studies," a relationship which
he said he hopes will be "close and
intellectually nurturing."
Jewish Studies already has a
good working relationship with the
African and Afro-American Studies
program, a relationship Zipper
stein said he expects to continue
with the development of new
courses. "We for example hope to
have a course on blacks and Jews at
some point," he said.
"I think the greatest opportuni
ties for mutual advantage (between
the new program and another area
of studies) are in the context of the
development of new courses," said
Urban Studies Director and Civil
Engineering Prof. Leonard
Ortolano.
The Urban Studies program,
which does not have its own facul
ty, has helped develop or encourage
classes in other departments on
issues including minority voting
and urban cultures that would be
likely candidates for inclusion in
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity, Ortolano said.
"Many of the courses that we
list in our core deal with issues
related to race and minority," he
said. "If you go down our core, my
guess would be about a third of our

courses relate to ethnicity."
Origins of programs
Support for the new interdisci
plinary program is a concern
among students and faculty —
especially those involved with last
year's protests and hunger strike
that led to the formation of com
mittees to develop programs in
Chicano Studies and Asian-Ameri
can Studies.
Directors for the ethnic and area
studies programs said administra
tive support has been fairly good
over the years. However, many
look for other sources of funding as
well.
Since its modern origin in the
late 1950s and the beginning of its
degree programs in the 19605, the
Center for Latin American Studies
— which was initially founded by
Stanford's second president, John
Casper Branner, to study Brazil —
has found "a sympathetic ear in the
administration," Morrison said.
"Certainly, like everyone in these
tight economic times, more of the
burden has been on us to generate
outside sources of revenue," she
added.
The Stanford budget affects the
Center for African Studies less.

because it has been funded since
1979 by the Department of Educa
tion as a joint center with UC-
Berkeley, Roberts said. The center
was founded in the early 1960s
with a grant from the Ford Foun
dation.
The University has been "care
ful in continuing its support" by
replacing departed faculty, but the
center hasn't grown, he said, until
this year when two new appoint
ments were made. African hum;in
ities specialists Valentin Mudimbe
and Elisabeth Mudimbe-Boyi, orig
inally from Zaire, recently received
joint appointments in French and
comparative literature and will
begin teaching spring quarter,
Roberts said.
In its seven-year history, Jewish
Studies has also been supported by
the administration, Zipperstein
said, but remains somewhat self
reliant in its budget. After the pro
gram was "launched at Stanford as
part of a major initiative on the
part of faculty and alumni," the
alumni "helped raise a significant
endowment that allowed Jewish
Studies ... to grow and flourish,"
he said.
University support of the Urban
Studies program has been "quite

satisfactory," Ortolano said.
Because the program works in a
large degree through other depart
ments, it doesn't require as many
resources, he said. The Urban
Studies program was developed in
the 1960s as a grassroots effort
that "came from students who saw
the problems of cities in the late
1960s as being among the top
domestic problems facing the coun
try," Ortolano said.
But with the new interdisci
plinary program, urban and other
ethnic and area studies will grow,
he said, adding that when pro
grams begin to offer minors, many
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity majors may want to
minor in Urban Studies.
Curriculum and final approval
for the new program are not yet in
place, but dialogue needs to be
opened about the relationships
among the various programs, Mor
rison said.
"I think that [collaboration] will
be desirable, and it's important
that conversations ensue from the
outset," she said. "I think any new
effort needs to reach out and be
embraced in the broader curricular
community . . . We're certainly
eager to do that."
The proposed new program in
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity can both work with and
learn from other ethnic and area
studies programs at Stanford, said
directors of currently existing pro
grams.
The existing programs and the
new program overlap in several
areas and "not to include them is
potentially very troublesome," said
History Assoc. Prof. Richard
Roberts, director of the Center for
African Studies.
A collaboration could help
"draw out the connections... that
studies of ethnicity and identity
can have," Roberts said, especially
if the new interdisciplinary pro
gram — proposed in a report by
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
John Shoven at the Feb. 23 Facul
ty Senate meeting — is broadened
to an international focus.
A look at other programs also
may address concerns about ad
ministrative support for the new
program: while directors of similar
programs said University support
has been fairly good over the years,
many noted that they look for out
side sources of funding as well.
Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity would offer rmyors
and minors in Chicano Studies,
Asian-American Studies and
African and Afro-American Stud
ies, as well as focuses on compara
tive topics such as immigration,
higher education or Chicano and
Asian-American relations.
'Intellectual neighbors'
"The new [program] will have
many intellectual neighbors at
Stanford and we will have to be
mindful of the opportunities for
cooperative programs," Shoven
said in his report.
Shoven lists Jewish Studies,
Feminist Studies, Urban Studies,
American Studies, African Studies,
Latin American Studies and East
Asian Studies as possible coopera
tive ventures. Stanford also has cen
ters for European Studies and Rus
sian and East European Studies.
"It is possible that in the future
we will expand the new [programJ
to include some of these programs
as full partners," the report said.

"There are a lot of overlapping
areas," said Kathleen Morrison,
associate director of the Center for
Latin American Studies. "Focusing
in on some of those issues in a com
parative perspective would certain
ly be of interest to us and we would
hope to contribute with that kind
of an approach."
Because most ethnic and area
studies courses are already offered
through other departments, such
as history, political science and
anthropology, many will count for
degrees in Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity as well as
degrees or certificates from the
other programs, directors said.
"There will certainly be courses
we teach that we would naturally
assume would be cross-listed," said
Histoiy Prof. Steven Zipperstein,
director of the Program in Jewish
Studies.
Although broader than an eth
nic or area studies program, Jewish
Studies could contribute positively

said.
