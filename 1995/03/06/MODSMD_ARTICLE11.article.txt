Dole would step down
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Bob Dole said
yesterday he would consider stepping down from
his post as Senate majority leader if early wins in
Republican primaries next year make him the
front-runner in the GOP presidential race.
The candidate who can capture the presiden
tial contests in lowa and New Hampshire is prob
ably going to win the nomination, the Kansas
Republican said on CBS's "Face the Nation."
"If I lose those two states, I can be full-time
majority leader. If I win those two states, then I
think I'd take a hard look at stepping aside," he
said.
Dole said he expected the outcome of the pres
idential race to be decided fairly quickly once the
primary season begins in the spring of 1996. "It
might be that you could just take a leave of
absence for 30 days, but I'll address that later."
At least three other Republican senators —
Phil Gramm of Texas, Richard Lugar of Indiana
and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania — are expect
ed to run against Dole, as is former Tennessee
Gov. Lamar Alexander.
Cyberspace meets outer space
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - For the
first time, NASA is providing public computer
access to virtually all aspects of a space shuttle
flight via the Internet, including occasional
exchanges with Endeavour's seven astronauts
and continuous updates on their astronomical
observations.

Computer users can even "Come Aboard," and
receive pictures and audio tapes of the crew.
More than 350,000 requests for mission infor
mation have poured in since Endeavour blasted
off Thursday.
Among the information available on the World
Wide Web: Endeavour's exact location over
Earth, stellar observations by the Astro tele
scopes and sky charts, crew and ground control
team photographs, snapshots of the cockpit,
taped conversations from four of the astronauts,
even NASA-TV broadcasts of the mission that
appear in a one-inch square.
About the only thing missing is a live view out
the shuttle windows.

Rains collapse hillside
LA CONCHITA, Calif. (AP) — A soggy hillside
that collapsed on part of a seaside hamlet in a
wave of mud and rock shifted yesterday and
threatened more homes as rain pelted the region.
Tons of earth that have loomed menacingly
over homes for decades broke loose Saturday,
destroying or damaging nine houses and forcing
dozens of evacuations. No one was injured and no
one was reported missing.
The slide created a massive crater in the hill,
which filled with water from weekend heavy
rains, said Ventura County sheriff s officials.
He said up to 25 additional houses were
threatened in the town of about 700 people.
