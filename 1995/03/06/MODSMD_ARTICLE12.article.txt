# Barings may have known risk
## 
### 
LONDON (AP) — Barings may
have violated Britain's banking
rules when it transferred $1.3 bil
lion to back a Singapore trader's
financial gambles in the weeks
before the bank's crash, two
British newspapers reported yes
terday.
There is also growing evidence
that Barings knew about trader
Nick Leeson's risky dealings,
ignored warnings of a possible dis
aster and may have misled the
Bank of England when it asked for
help in putting together a rescue
package.
Leeson is believed to have lost
at least $1 billion by wrongly bet
ting that Tokyo stock prices would
rise last month.
The Observer newspaper
reported American regulators
threatened to close Barings' New
York brokerage office last year
because of serious failures in man
agement.
Barings insiders were quoted by
the paper as saying that was
another example of the bank's lax
supervision of its overseas opera
tions, which allowed Leeson to
bust Britain's oldest investment
bank.
Meanwhile, the ING Group of
the Netherlands won its bid to
take over Barings, court-appointed
administrators announced yester

day in London.
A source who spoke with The
Associated Press on condition of
anonymity said the Dutch banking
and insurance group would take
over Barings' asset management
firm, a corporate finance arm and
a securities brokerage with exper
tise in the developing markets of
Latin America and Asia.
A report released Saturday by
Price Waterhouse accountants in
Singapore said Barings trans
ferred $890 million from its Lon
don head office in January and
February in mandatory up-front
money to back Ix?eson's futures
trading.
The Sunday Telegraph said
bankers in London insist that $1.3
billion was transferred to Singa
pore. It quoted top financial
sources as saying the bank sent
the money from London to Singa
pore and opened a special account
in the Cayman Islands, a
Caribbean tax haven, to cover Lee
son's dealings in the Osaka stock
market in Japan.
The huge transfers to Singa
pore represented more than twice
the bank's capital, estimated at
around $560 million.
Britain's 1987 Banking Act pro
hibits banks from putting more
than 25 percent of their money
into any single "basket" without

authorization from the Bank of
England's supervisory committee.
It appears unlikely that Barings
sought such permission because
Bank of England Governor Eddie
George said at the time of Barings'
collapse that bank executives told
him they had not known they had
a problem until Feb. 23.
Investigators in Singapore said
Saturday that Barings was warned
seven months ago that Leeson
held too much power with too little
supervision. They also made pub
lic a letter showing Barings was
told of the potential problem as far
back as 1992.
Court-appointed administra
tors took over the bank on Feb. 27
after the Bank of England couldn't
put together a rescue package.
The Sunday Mirror quoted an
unnamed friend of Leeson's in the
banking business as saying "Nick
is clear that his losses were noth
ing like [$1 billion]. He is responsi
ble for around 150 million pounds
[$240 million]. The rest is not
down to him."
Peter Baring, chairman of the
232-year-old bank which financed
the Napoleonic Wars and counts
Queen Elizabeth II among its cus
tomers, said last week that Leeson
may have qonspired with an
unknown partner to break the
bank.
