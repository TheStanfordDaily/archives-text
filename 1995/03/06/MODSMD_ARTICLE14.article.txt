Kudos to University for
innovative program on
race and ethnic studies

THE UNIVERSITY has
made an excellent decision
in creating a new interdis
ciplinary program — Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnici
ty. The major should satisfy the
demand for more ethnic studies
of students while enhancing
Stanford's social sciences and
humanities in general.
It's clear that a significant and
vocal portion of the student body
was in favor of adopting an ethnic
studies program. In last May's
hunger strike in the Quad, for
example, the creaticn of a Chi
cano Studies program was one of

the protesters' demands;
the following week, stu
dents disrupted a meeting
of the Faculty Senate —
eventually forcing its
adjournment — to demand
the creation of an Asian-
American Studies major.

Whereas ethnic studies
programs at other universities
often focus on the history and lit
erature of different ethnic
groups, Stanford has once again
proven itself a standout by plac
ing the same emphasis on the
social sciences as on the humani
ties. This decision — which
should greatly strengthen the
new program — is sensible given
the fact that, by nature, issues in
ethnic studies overlap with the
social sciences.
In addition, the new program
will benefit Stanford's social sci
ences departments — as well as
humanities — by adding inter
esting and innovative professors
and courses. While the Universi
ty's science and engineering
departments are unquestionably
among the best, if not the best, in
the world, Stanford's prestige
would be even further enhanced
if it could bring its humanities

and social sciences to the same
level. The new Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity is
clearly a step in the right direc
tion.
Furthermore, with the previ
ously existing African and Afro-
American Studies program Stan
ford would have been hypocritical
not to support similar programs
in Chicano and Asian-American
Studies. Incorporating all three
fields of study into the new pro
gram will justly equalize the rep
resentation of significant minori
ty groups on campus in academic
departments.
Stanford should be sure, how
ever, to put its money where its
mouth is. Students are concerned
about the University's level of
financial commitment to the new
program; Stanford should soothe
their fears by promising adequate

funding to Comparative
Studies in Race and Eth
nicity.
The University's proposal
for a research institute for
studies in race and ethnici
ty is also commendable.
Race relations are clearly

one of the greatest prob
lems facing today's society; the
more intellectual leadership
Stanford can produce in terms of
providing solutions to ethnic con
flicts the better. Since the insti
tute's future depends largely on
the financial support it receives,
hopefully those who support the
program will contribute signifi
cant funds to guarantee its pros
perity.
Yet another important quality
of the new program is its flexibil
ity. Students can expand their
field of study to concentrate on
broad national and international
issues in race and ethnicity or
relations between many different
ethnic groups.
When it is implemented, Stan
ford students should take advan
tage of this excellent new pro
gram to make life in a diverse
world as understanding and
peaceful as possible.
