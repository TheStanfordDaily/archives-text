## Summer jobs and Safeway 
### 
THE COMMISSION on Undergrad
uate Education missed one impor
tant part of our undergraduate
experience â€” the four-month hiatus from
Stanford called summer. When the final
pencil hits the desk after spring quarter's
last exam, we disperse to our separate
summer worlds: URO grants to study in
faraway corners of the globe, high-power
internships in D.C., or perhaps the home
town job we've had since age 16.
Stanford does an incredible job assist
ing us to move up in the world. The
internship and summer job opportunities
available often accomplish the same as
our school-year academics: taking us to a
new level and leaving what we've done
before in the past. There is a strong
undercurrent of competition here. While
not immediately discernible from the
Ultimate Frisbee games and casual con
versations in the CoHo, it's there under
neath it all. It's what makes all of us hes
itate before taking off to the City for an
entire day. It's what makes us feel embar
rassed to admit that we're going back
home for the summer to work in a grocery
store.
Does anyone else out there wish they
could enjoy the sights and sounds of the
country road before entering the express
way of our futures beyond Stanford? How
many of us have already worked for mini
mum wage for the last time?
Let's institute a requirement that all
of us here work in what's been stigma

tized as a blue-collar job for one summer
during our time at Stanford. The Univer
sity could subsidize any money that
would be lost from potentially higher
summer earnings needed to make ends
meet during the school year. Surely our
advisors could help us find one of these
jobs just as easily as they could exploit
their high power connections. They could
hook us up with their employers from
their high school and early college days.
And maybe the person who hired you for
the summer before your junior year in
high school would want you back.
Then we could be proud to declare that
we're going home for the summer to stock
milk, eggs, bread and beer at Safeway. I
always believed in the value of what I was
setting out to do last summer, but I was
often afraid to disclose to any of my Stan
ford friends just exactly what it was that I
would be doing from June to September.
Looking back, I learned a lot about real
people, from the demanding tourists who
perused the aisles to my fellow Safeway
employees who set out every day to make
a living. These are the women and men
who make our world spin just as much
anyone else . .. and we often forget about
this.
The lessons of CIV didn't escape me
while keeping the shelves full and the
line moving quickly through the check
stand. Not only did I memorize every sin
gle flavor of yogurt in the dairy cooler,
but I also pondered the thoughts from

those reading lists at Stanford. Was it
truly Freud's "Civilization and Its Dis
contents" around me as I lugged the gal
lons of low-fat milk into the cooler? What
would Marx say about the 20th Century
grocery store?
Even more important than these intel
lectual questions were the lessons gained
from the experience itself. Sweeping the
floor in the back room proved to be hard
work, in a different way from writing a
term paper here. Interacting with all of
the people in the store, from the vendors
to the customers to my fellow employees,
taught me new lessons.
Even if we do dedicate ourselves to
these new summer jobs, what does that
say about us in the long run? Won't we
still return to Stanford in September and
continue the fast-track pursuit of bigger
and better jobs? Most likely we will, but
perhaps we might realize that our future
jobs aren't necessarily bigger and better,
but just different.
Perhaps we'll decide not to run for
reelection when the time comes and
instead apply to work at the local grocery
store. When we spill milk all over the floor
in the produce department, then we will
realize our shared imperfection.
