Columbae 'freaks' debate Betsy and Stew's column

I HAVE DOCUMENTED a conversa
tion between myself and a fellow
Columbae resident (both freaks)
regarding The Daily which took place
after we both read last week's "Tuesday
Thoughts." Of course, it doesn't quite
qualify as a fitting response to the excel
lent social commentary-cum-kneeslap
ping party-for-all authored by Stewart
Richardson and Betsy Kennedy that The
Daily chose to print; however, I thought
readers might be interested anyway.
Dan:
The Stanford Daily is an exceptional
newspaper. By exceptional, I mean a
newspaper which everyone looks to for
serious news, a newspaper that isn't
afraid to print what some people might
not want to read. Take, for example, the
half-page dialogue about the alternative
scene at Stanford. First of all, by tack
ling such controversial issues as Bolivian
dykes and "hairpie" Pi Phis, The Daily is
pushing the limits of some of our
notions about what campus news should
be — what campus news could be.
Actually, I realize that dykes and pies
weren't the only tough issues — others
were diversity, tolerance, and matching
attire — but the inclusion of them is the
spark that makes the article brilliant.
Tackling such heavy topics with such a

keen sense of humor is truly avant
garde! I realize, certainly, that The Daily
editors can't hog the credit for this coup;
we were all aghast by Review nasty-boy
Aman Verjee long before.
Betsy and Stew tickled themselves,
and all of us, by talking about — it gives
me goosebumps — doing drugs. I
blushed right down to my pierced scro
tum when I read Betsy's scathing send
up of Theta Chi's showers; it's almost
touching that a Pi Phi could feign such
modesty. (But seriously, although I'm a
liberal, Betsy, I'm no ingrate. I'm actual
ly very happy that I transferred from a
state university in Mississippi — a place
where women, especially sorority girls,
expect to be taken seriously — to Stan
ford, where the chicks allow guys to
stereotype them as sexual objects on the
pages of the campus newspaper.) Beyond
the controversy and humor, only a truly
exceptional newspaper could devote a
full half-page to a gag that other, lesser,
papers might fear would fall flat after,
say, eight lines.
Clark:
How ridiculous, Dan — the flaring
wit of the "Tuesday Thoughts" column
doesn't belong anywhere near the pale
pages of The Stanford Daily. Observa
tions of such stunning insight complete

ly transcend the narrow limits of The
Daii.y's little ditty. Betsy and Stew's
gripping analysis of the alternative
lifestyle on campus cannot possibly be
placed next to such petty news tidbits as
the budget amendment, tuition hikes
and wars, without casting them into the
shadowy depths of Chaparral material. I
for one was so overwhelmed to see my
very own "alternative" freak lifestyle
reflected in Stew's perfect porcelain
prose, that I would like to invite him to a
big cross-dressing, nipple-piercing, drug
toting orgy at Columbae.
But the real beauty of the article was
that both sides had something profound
and informative to contribute to the fray
— even though my sympathies truly lie
with Stew's defiant Socratic stand, I was
nevertheless swayed by the persuasive
conservatism of Miss Kennedy. Some
times I do feel my flaming liberalism
needs to be toned down by further asso
ciation with the careful conservative rea
soning the Greek system has always rep
resented on this campus. In fact, if I
wasn't such an alternative freak perhaps
I would rush this year in an attempt to
discover the complex penses underlying
the latest developments in beer-guzzling
technology.
Unfortunately, my time is occupied
ferreting out new glands to pierce, find

ing new corners of the coffee house to
infest, and planning the next commu
nist revolution, so I'll probably just
remain trapped within the freak-infest
ed confines of Columbae. In any case, I
would like to thank both authors for
treating such a weighty subject with
depth, clarity, and above all style — and
I would like to chastise the narrow
minded editors for not devoting the
entire Tuesday edition to elaborating
the thought of these two major intellec
tual figures.
We jointly applaud the stylistic exper
tise of Betsy and Stewart and their
tongue-in-cheek discussion of sometimes
humorous issues. They play their parts
well. Some things however, just aren't
funny in some contexts. Within the
"Tuesday Thoughts" dialogue, issues
such as lesbianism and the homogeneity
of the Stanford campus are vulgarized,
not illuminated, by the authors' degrad
ing and facetious manner. If fostering
such a low level of discourse is The
Daily's goal, then we applaud your suc
cess, and present you with the Amar
Verjee Award for Inane Journalism.
