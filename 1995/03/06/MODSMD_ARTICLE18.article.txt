# State math framework teaches 'how and why mathematics works'
## 
### 
In response to The Daily's Feb. 22
story "Expressing their wrath against the
new math," I would like to offer some
clarification regarding misconceptions
about mathematics education in the Palo

Alto Unified School District.
Your article correctly identifies that
the Palo Alto Unified School District fol
lows the California State Mathematics
Framework. What it does not mention is
that the framework is the accepted guide
line for the teaching of mathematics in
the state of California. It also upholds the
standards established by the only nation
al association for mathematics teachers,
the National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics. This is no small faction of
radical educators. The framework empha

sizes that students be responsible for for
mulating, solving, thinking, and commu
nicating about important mathematical
ideas. Who wouldn't want that for their
children or for the children of the next
generation?
As a teacher in both a high school and
a middle school in the Palo Alto Unified
School District, I witness mathematics
education at it finest. Not only are stu
dents learning the basics, but they are
also learning how and why mathematics
works. In the seventh grade, for example,

students model linear functions, graph
and analyze survey data, critique the
national budget, and build a scaled ver
sion Jurassic Park. This is not "fuzzy
math."
We must also remember to keep this
show in perspective. Only five parents
protested the math changes. The majority
of parents seem veiy pleased with the
mathematics education that their chil
dren are receiving.
