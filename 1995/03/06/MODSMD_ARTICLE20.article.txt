## Men's loss is just the Pits Stanford on bubble

EUGENE, Ore. — There are peach pits and plum
pits. There are even orchestra pits. But on Saturday
night, the Stanford men's basketball team played in
Oregon's Pit. It's an alter ego for the Ducks' home
floor McArthur Court — just three letters long,
short, sweet and concise.
The Cardinal found out just how apt the name is.
As many an opposing team has discovered this year,
including top-ranked UCLA, you walk in and all
that happens is you fall and fall and fall. .. .
The 20th-ranked Cardinal squad (17-8, 8-8 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) had already done plenty of
tripping and stumbling and fumbling as of late,
dropping four of its last six games. But make that
five of seven now after a 89-80 loss to the Ducks (18-
7, 10-6 in the Pac-10).
Entering the contest, the Cardinal's fortunes
already appeared somewhat bleak. The Ducks start
ed out riled up in a frenzy prior to the game not only
because of NCAA-tournament aspirations, which
hinged on the game, but also because it was Senior
Night for an Oregon team that had eight soon-to-be
graduates.
In addition, it was Stanford which entered the
game lame coming off an embarrassing drubbing by
Oregon State. To many, there was little resem
blance between this floundering late-season Cardi
nal club and the one that won 10 straight at the
beginning of the season.
"The things that we did to get us here, we're not
doing right now," said Stanford head coach Mike
