## Men's loss is just the Pits Stanford on bubble

Stanford 80
Oregon 89

EUGENE, Ore. — There are peach pits and plum
pits. There are even orchestra pits. But on Saturday
night, the Stanford men's basketball team played in
Oregon's Pit. It's an alter ego for the Ducks' home
floor McArthur Court — just three letters long,
short, sweet and concise.
The Cardinal found out just how apt the name is.
As many an opposing team has discovered this year,
including top-ranked UCLA, you walk in and all
that happens is you fall and fall and fall. .. .
The 20th-ranked Cardinal squad (17-8, 8-8 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) had already done plenty of
tripping and stumbling and fumbling as of late,
dropping four of its last six games. But make that
five of seven now after a 89-80 loss to the Ducks (18-
7, 10-6 in the Pac-10).
Entering the contest, the Cardinal's fortunes
already appeared somewhat bleak. The Ducks start
ed out riled up in a frenzy prior to the game not only
because of NCAA-tournament aspirations, which
hinged on the game, but also because it was Senior
Night for an Oregon team that had eight soon-to-be
graduates.
In addition, it was Stanford which entered the
game lame coming off an embarrassing drubbing by
Oregon State. To many, there was little resem
blance between this floundering late-season Cardi
nal club and the one that won 10 straight at the
beginning of the season.
"The things that we did to get us here, we're not
doing right now," said Stanford head coach Mike

Montgomery. "We need to shoot
better. We need to execute a little
better, play defense a little better,
board a little harder."
If it's any consolation, howev
er, the right Stanford team did
appear — at least for a while.
After a three-pointer by Duck
guard Orlando Williams gave
Oregon a 26-20 lead, the Cardinal
charged right back, scoring eight
straight capped by a Dion Cross
floating jumper off-the-glass.
"At least we played with some
more emotion and purpose
tonight," Montgomery said. "We
played hard."
The only problem was that 28-
26 would be the first and only
time Stanford led. After that, it
was a one-way trip for the Cardi
nal at the Pit, and it was the
wrong way — down.
Fueled by a barrage of
Williams' treys, Oregon scored 14
unanswered points, to lead by 12,
and ultimately took a command
ing 44-33 advantage into half

time. Much like in the Oregon
State game, the Cardinal offense
was nowhere to be found convert
ing just 39.2 percent of their field
goal attempts.
"Right now, we just aren't
shooting the ball very well," Mont
gomery said. "This is the second
game in a row we've been under 40
percent. And on the road, that's
expecting a lot to shoot 40 percent
and win. We got a lot of good looks
early on. We just couldn't get the
ball in the hole."
Stanford's not so merry
descent down a seemingly bot
tomless Pit continued in the sec
ond half. The Ducks blazed out to
a 51-33 lead, but the Cardinal
scraped and clawed its way back
slowly ... in more ways than one.
After a bevy of trash talking
broke out at the end of the first
half, resulting in a rear scuffle
involving players and coaches,
tempers flared again between sev
eral players including Knight,
Cross and Ducks Darryl Parker
and Damon Runyon.
"Mac Court's our home," Ore
gon guard Kenya Wilkins said.
"They tried to come in and be
physical with some bump and

grind, but we came right back at
them."
But it wasn't all chaos and car
nage in canard land. With Stan
ford's leading scorer Cross strug
gling in a recent slump — seven
points against the Beavers and
two points in the first half vs. the
Ducks, point guard Brevin
Knight, as he has so done many
times in the past, picked up the
slack along with center Tim
Young.
Knight and Young combined
for 40 of the Cardinal's 80 points.
The Stanford big man also had a
career-high 17 rebounds and two
blocks.
Nevertheless, it was Cross who
came alive late in the game to
close the lead to 10 points with a
three-pointer from the left cor
ner. Oregon, which had led by
more than 10 throughout the sec
ond half, seemed to be crumbling
against this last ditch effort by
Stanford. But with just over three
minutes to play, was it too little,
too late?
"When Dion Cross hit some of
those three's, I was getting a little
insecure," Williams said. "He
hadn't been making them all

night and now in crunch time, he
was hitting them, and they were
getting back in it."
Young's put-back followed by
free throws by Knight and Pop
pink drew the lead to five. With
the clock ticking and the Ducks
doing their best to keep it that
way, the Cardinal was forced to
foul.
And as advertised, with the
Ducks entering the game shoot
ing a Pac-10 best 80.6 from the
charity stripe, these fowl certain
ly knew a thing or two about foul
shooting. Down the stretch, Ore
gon converted 18-of-20 free
throws.
"Free throws are an individual
thing," Williams said. "And in a
game like this, it's important for
individuals to step up. Once we
knocked down those free throws,
1 felt a little more comfortable."
Despite efforts by Cross,
Knight and Poppink, who had a
career-best six steals, five points
would be as close as it ever did
get. And for Stanford, who began
the road trip in Oregon with
sunny optimism, things became a
whole lot darker at the bottom of
the abysmal Pit.

As many an opposing team has discovered this year,
including top-ranked UCLA, you walk in and all
that happens is you fall and fall and fall. .. .
The 20th-ranked Cardinal squad (17-8, 8-8 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) had already done plenty of
tripping and stumbling and fumbling as of late,
dropping four of its last six games. But make that
five of seven now after a 89-80 loss to the Ducks (18-
7, 10-6 in the Pac-10).
Entering the contest, the Cardinal's fortunes
already appeared somewhat bleak. The Ducks start
ed out riled up in a frenzy prior to the game not only
because of NCAA-tournament aspirations, which
hinged on the game, but also because it was Senior
Night for an Oregon team that had eight soon-to-be
graduates.
In addition, it was Stanford which entered the
game lame coming off an embarrassing drubbing by
Oregon State. To many, there was little resem
blance between this floundering late-season Cardi
nal club and the one that won 10 straight at the
beginning of the season.
"The things that we did to get us here, we're not
doing right now," said Stanford head coach Mike

Montgomery. "We need to shoot
better. We need to execute a little
better, play defense a little better,
board a little harder."
If it's any consolation, howev
er, the right Stanford team did
appear — at least for a while.
After a three-pointer by Duck
guard Orlando Williams gave
Oregon a 26-20 lead, the Cardinal
charged right back, scoring eight
straight capped by a Dion Cross
floating jumper off-the-glass.
"At least we played with some
more emotion and purpose
tonight," Montgomery said. "We
played hard."
The only problem was that 28-
26 would be the first and only
time Stanford led. After that, it
was a one-way trip for the Cardi
nal at the Pit, and it was the
wrong way — down.
Fueled by a barrage of
Williams' treys, Oregon scored 14
unanswered points, to lead by 12,
and ultimately took a command
ing 44-33 advantage into half

time. Much like in the Oregon
State game, the Cardinal offense
was nowhere to be found convert
ing just 39.2 percent of their field
goal attempts.
"Right now, we just aren't
shooting the ball very well," Mont
gomery said. "This is the second
game in a row we've been under 40
percent. And on the road, that's
expecting a lot to shoot 40 percent
and win. We got a lot of good looks
early on. We just couldn't get the
ball in the hole."
Stanford's not so merry
descent down a seemingly bot
tomless Pit continued in the sec
ond half. The Ducks blazed out to
a 51-33 lead, but the Cardinal
scraped and clawed its way back
slowly ... in more ways than one.
After a bevy of trash talking
broke out at the end of the first
half, resulting in a rear scuffle
involving players and coaches,
tempers flared again between sev
eral players including Knight,
Cross and Ducks Darryl Parker
and Damon Runyon.
"Mac Court's our home," Ore
gon guard Kenya Wilkins said.
"They tried to come in and be
physical with some bump and

grind, but we came right back at
them."
But it wasn't all chaos and car
nage in canard land. With Stan
ford's leading scorer Cross strug
gling in a recent slump — seven
points against the Beavers and
two points in the first half vs. the
Ducks, point guard Brevin
Knight, as he has so done many
times in the past, picked up the
slack along with center Tim
Young.
Knight and Young combined
for 40 of the Cardinal's 80 points.
The Stanford big man also had a
career-high 17 rebounds and two
blocks.
Nevertheless, it was Cross who
came alive late in the game to
close the lead to 10 points with a
three-pointer from the left cor
ner. Oregon, which had led by
more than 10 throughout the sec
ond half, seemed to be crumbling
against this last ditch effort by
Stanford. But with just over three
minutes to play, was it too little,
too late?
"When Dion Cross hit some of
those three's, I was getting a little
insecure," Williams said. "He
hadn't been making them all

night and now in crunch time, he
was hitting them, and they were
getting back in it."
Young's put-back followed by
free throws by Knight and Pop
pink drew the lead to five. With
the clock ticking and the Ducks
doing their best to keep it that
way, the Cardinal was forced to
foul.
And as advertised, with the
Ducks entering the game shoot
ing a Pac-10 best 80.6 from the
charity stripe, these fowl certain
ly knew a thing or two about foul
shooting. Down the stretch, Ore
gon converted 18-of-20 free
throws.
"Free throws are an individual
thing," Williams said. "And in a
game like this, it's important for
individuals to step up. Once we
knocked down those free throws,
1 felt a little more comfortable."
Despite efforts by Cross,
Knight and Poppink, who had a
career-best six steals, five points
would be as close as it ever did
get. And for Stanford, who began
the road trip in Oregon with
sunny optimism, things became a
whole lot darker at the bottom of
the abysmal Pit.
