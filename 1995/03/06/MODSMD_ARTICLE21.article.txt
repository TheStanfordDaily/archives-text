## Rain, Reed deal Cal scoreless weekend 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Stanford 7
California 0

For a brief moment on Sat
urday afternoon, all of the
pieces came together for the
12th-ranked Stanford baseball
team.
The Cardinal (12-8 overall,
3-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) manhan
dled the California Golden
Bears (7-10, 0-1 in the Six-Pac)
to the tune of a 7-0 count at
Berkeley's Evans Diamond. In
the only game over the weekend
not canceled due to rain, Stan
ford could do no wrong.
The Cardinal got an out
standing pitching performance
from its ace, junior left-hander
Dan Reed (2-2), while maintain
ing solid offensive production
and playing mistake-free in the

field to cruise to its third con
ference victory in four games.
Stanford will meet the Golden
Bears again this afternoon at 2
p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
"That was the Stanford team
that was ranked number one at
the beginning of the year," said
Reed. "We played solid defense
and hit the ball real well. We
know that we're capable of
playing that way all the time
and that's what we hope to do."
Reed had his best outing of
the season on Saturday, looking
more like the southpaw that
dominated the Six-Pac in 1994
then the one who opened 1995
with a 1-2 record. The junior
went the distance for the Cardi
nal, scattering six singles while
notching 10 strikeouts — one
short of a career high — to
record the shutout.
"Every time I go out there,
I'm looking to pitch a game like
[Saturday]," Reed said. "I've
had some mechanical problems
the past few weeks, especially
with my curveball, and I'm glad
I worked out what was wrong."
Stanford batters also appar
ently worked out what was
wrong as the Cardinal — which
came into the game hitting .257
as a team — banged out 14 hits
and capitalized on nearly every
opportunity to score. Stanford
scored in six separate innings on
Saturday to provide Reed with
more support than he needed.
"We knew going in that their
pitcher was going to throw fast
balls," right fielder Rich Crowe
said. "We decided to be more
aggressive at the plate and look
for more base hits instead of try
ing to draw walks. It worked for
us on Saturday."
Freshman center fielder Joe
Kilburg led the charge, going 3-
for-4 at the plate in his first
game in the leadoff position. Kil
burg did everything expected
from a leadoff man, reaching
base four of the five times he
came to bat while scoring three
runs and collecting four stolen
bases.

Kilburg wasted no time in get
ting things started in the Cardi
nal's half of the first. The Bay
Village, Ohio native led off the
game with a single to right field
off Rears starter Ryan Drese (1-
4) and promptly stole second
base. Junior catcher A.J. Hinch
plated Kilburg with an RBI sin
gle up the middle to stake Stan
ford to a 1-0 lead it would never
relinquish.
Hinch finished the afternoon
with three RBIs and two base
hits while also throwing out two
Cal base-runners trying to steal.
The junior had a sacrifice fly in
the third and an RBI single in
the fourth to increase the Cardi
nal advantage to 3-0.
And Hinch and Kilburg
weren't the only Stanford bat
ters who rose to the occasion.
Junior left fielder Cale Carter
went 3-for-4 on the afternoon
with a triple and two RBIs. First
baseman Troy Kent also quietly
added two hits on a day that
clearly belonged to the Cardinal.
Stanford also excelled on the
base paths on Saturday, execut
ing two textbook hit-and-runs
while being successful on six of
seven base stealing attempts.

The Cardinal was also flawless
in the field, as Stanford's out
fielders made several spectacular
catches to keep the Bears at bay.
"Anytime you play Cal, espe
cially at their place, you know
it's going to be a big game," said
Crowe, who robbed third base
man Jason Rianda of a hit with a
diving catch in the fifth. "They
usually have a lot of fans and
this was definitely a big win for
us."
Cal's only threat to score
came in the bottom of the third
when Ivan Lewis and John
Furstenthal hit back-to-back
singles before a double steal put
runners on second and third.
But Reed responded to the chal
lenge, catching shortstop Dan
Cey looking at a 3-2 pitch to end
the inning.
As if Cardinal fans didn't
have enough to be happy about
on Saturday, senior Dusty Allen
finally returned to the lineup
after nursing a hand injury all
season long, playing the first two
innings in the outfield.
For the first time all year, the
preseason No. 1 team in the
nation got a glimpse of how good
they were supposed to be.
