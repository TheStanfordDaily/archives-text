Stanford 7
California 0

For a brief moment on Sat
urday afternoon, all of the
pieces came together for the
12th-ranked Stanford baseball
team.
The Cardinal (12-8 overall,
3-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference

Bears again this afternoon at 2
p.m. at Sunken Diamond.

playing that way all the time
and that's what we hope to do."

with a 1-2 record. The junior
went the distance for the Cardi
nal, scattering six singles while
notching 10 strikeouts — one
short of a career high — to
record the shutout.
"Every time I go out there,
I'm looking to pitch a game like
[Saturday]," Reed said. "I've
had some mechanical problems
the past few weeks, especially
with my curveball, and I'm glad
