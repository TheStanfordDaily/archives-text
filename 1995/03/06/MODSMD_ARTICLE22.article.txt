The third-ranked Stanford
women's tennis squad (11-2 over
all, 3-0 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's Southern Division) threw
down the Bears but got hooked by
the Longhorns as they split a
weekend of championship tennis
with California (5-4, 0-3 in the
Pac-10 South) and Texas (8-1) on
Friday and Sunday at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.
Despite wrestling with the
fourth-ranked Golden Bears for a
5-3 triumph, the Cardinal fell to
the second-ranked Texas team,
ending Stanford's 31-match win
ning streak at the Stadium. The
previous loss had actually come at
the hands of the Longhorns as
well in the 1992 NCAA semifinals
held at Stanford.
"I think Texas is the better
team," said head coach Frank
Brennan. "I think we played pret
ty well. All I can think of is that

they were a little tougher than we
were because we had a lot of game
points, and we didn't seem to win
those games. It must be that
they're a little more mentally
tough than we are or confident or
something."
Brennan looked forward to the
weekend as a major test for the
squad that was embarking upon
the crux of their dual-match
schedule. "I think we're young,
but it's the end of winter quarter;
we're not young anymore. We
know what the good teams look
like, and I think we're one of
them. Clearly we're not in the top
three, but I think we can probably
be four."
The Texas victory rounded out
a very successful West Coast vic
tory for the Longhorns, as they
defeated Cal yesterday 8-0 in
Berkeley. Eighteen-year head
coach Jeff Moore praised his
squad that essentially proved its
case to remain near the top of the
polls in this week's updated rank
ings.
"I thought the whole team put
in a 9-0 effort, meaning that our
three set losses were every bit as
important to us in terms of
momentum," said Moore. "Some

thing tells me that we will be meet
ing the Cardinal again. They're
very tough and will only improve
as the year goes along."
The experience factor came into
play in the top two matches as
senior Longhorn Kelly Pace,
ranked in the nation, matched
up against sophomore Katie
Schlukebir (8-4) in the No. 1
match. Schlukebir jumped out
early for a 3-0 lead in the first set,
but dropped five straight games as
Pace maintained her control and

took the first set, 6-4.
That first set comeback took the
wind out of the still-recovering
Schlukebir, who fell in the second
set, 6-1.
Freshman Ania Bleszynski (6-4)
played Longhorn senior Lucie
Ludigova, who was rated No. 1 in
the preseason and currently sits at
No. 4. Ludigova exploited Bleszyn
ski's youth in a 6-2,6-2 straight set
victory. "It seemed a lot closer than
that because I had a lot of game
points that I just did not convert,"
Bleszynski said.
Senior Kim Shasby (8-3) had
the age factor in her corner against
Farley Taylor, tied for No. 34 in
collegiate tennis. Shasby mounted
a comeback after a first set 6-3
defeat, but Farley toughened up
after splitting the first two sets to
win, 6-3, 3-6,6-4.
Sophomore Sandra De Silva's
(9-2) No. 4 match represented the
Cardinal's only straight-set victory
of the day; she defeated 13th
ranked Anne Pastor, 6-3, 6-4.
Freshman Julie Scott (11-2),
who chose Stanford over the
Longhorn program, lost for only
the second time this year in the No.
5 match to fellow frosh Cristina
Moros, who is ranked No. 18
nationally. Scott fell in straight
sets 6-4, 6-4 despite owning a 4-0
lead in the second set.
"These phenomena are proba
bly the sign of a young team,"
Brennan said. "A team that
doesn't quite have their confidence
or sense of identity yet."
Senior Amy Chiminello dis
played the significance of experi
ence and confidence in her three
set victory, 3-6, 7-5, 6-2 over
Texas's Jennifer Nasser.
The Longhorns clinched their
fifth consecutive dual-match victo
ry after a three-set triumph in the
No. 1 doubles match. Pace and
Moros teamed up to put down
Bleszynski and Schlukebir (7-3), 4-
6, 6-2, 6-3. The Cardinal duo, who
had finally started gelling with
three consecutive victories, also

squandered a first set lead in
falling in the second and third.
The No. 2 doubles squad of
Chiminello and Scott (7-2) fell in
straight sets, 6-4, 6-4 while Shasby
and doubles specialist Emily Burt
completed Stanford's third victory
of the day, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.
The weekend was not without
success â€” or, for that matter, jubi
lation, as the Cardinal downed
archrival and perennial power
house Cal on Friday, 5-3. The Car
dinal was actually again only wast
ed opportunities away from a victo
ry in singles.
Schlukebir dispelled all rumors
of her weakened state due to illness
with a 6-1,6-4 straight set domina
tion of Cal's Jennifer Poulos.
Bleszynski came three match
points away from upsetting Pam
Nelson in the No. 2 match but
could not hold on in the third set
tie-breaker 6-7, 6-2, 7-6. Shasby
also had opportunities to take her
No. 3 match from Keirsten Alley 4-
6, 7-6, 7-6.
De Silva never got going in her
No. 4 match against Nicole Elliott,
losing 6-2, 1-6, 6-3. Scott came
back from a 3-6 first set defeat
against Valerie Poulos to capture
her tenth victory of the season, 3-6,
6-2,6-1.
Doubles competition clinched
the match and sent Cal to the cellar
of the Pac-10 South as Schlukebir
and Bleszynski paid no attention to
Alley and Nelson's No. 2 national
ranking, upending them in
straight sets 6-2, 6-2.
Burt and Shasby's match at the
No. 3 position was suspended at 7-
6, 1-1 as Chiminello and Scott
downed the Pouloses for a 6-1, 6-2
triumph that seized the victory and
sealed bragging rights over Bay
Area tennis.
"I was most pleased with our
two doubles wins at No. 1 and No.
2," said Brennan. "Those were
extraordinary, especially at No. 1.1
didn't think we'd have that type of
performance against the No. 2
ranked team in the nation."
