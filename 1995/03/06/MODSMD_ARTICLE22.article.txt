The third-ranked Stanford
women's tennis squad (11-2 over
all, 3-0 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's Southern Division) threw
down the Bears but got hooked by
the Longhorns as they split a
weekend of championship tennis
with California (5-4, 0-3 in the
Pac-10 South) and Texas (8-1) on
Friday and Sunday at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.
Despite wrestling with the
fourth-ranked Golden Bears for a
5-3 triumph, the Cardinal fell to
the second-ranked Texas team,
ending Stanford's 31-match win

previous loss had actually come at
the hands of the Longhorns as

held at Stanford.
"I think Texas is the better
team," said head coach Frank
Brennan. "I think we played pret
ty well. All I can think of is that

they were a little tougher than we
were because we had a lot of game
points, and we didn't seem to win
those games. It must be that
they're a little more mentally
tough than we are or confident or
something."
Brennan looked forward to the
weekend as a major test for the
squad that was embarking upon
the crux of their dual-match
schedule. "I think we're young,
but it's the end of winter quarter;
we're not young anymore. We
know what the good teams look
like, and I think we're one of
them. Clearly we're not in the top
three, but I think we can probably
be four."
The Texas victory rounded out
a very successful West Coast vic
tory for the Longhorns, as they
defeated Cal yesterday 8-0 in
Berkeley. Eighteen-year head
coach Jeff Moore praised his
squad that essentially proved its
