## Seniors help wound Ducks

Oregon 55
Stanford 97

As freshmen on the Stanford
women's basketball team four
years ago, they cut the nets after
winning the Pacific 10 Confer
ence and the NCAA champi
onships in Los Angeles. This year,
they started the process again.
Anita Kaplan, Rachel Hemmer
and Kate Paye, honored at Satur
day's Senior Recognition Night
for their accomplishments and
contributions, capped the evening
by climbing up a ladder and cut
ting a piece of the Maples Pavilion
net for themselves. With the
Stanford victory over Oregon (16-
9 overall, 9-7 in the Pac-10), the
Cardinal (24-2, 15-1 in the Pac
-10) clinched an outright confer
ence championship for the third
time in the trio's four years on
campus. During those four years,
Stanford has compiled a 105-17
record including a 36-0 record at
home in Pac-10 conference
games.
While the 97-55 victory to cap
ture the Pac-10 crown was impor
tant, the Cardinal has another
title in its sights.
"One of [the team's] first goals
was to take care of the Pac-10
championship," Hemmer said.
"Then the national champi
onship."
Stanford had already ensured
itself a share of the conference

championship before the game
against the Ducks with the victo
ry over Oregon State Thursday
night. It took only a few minutes
before the outright title became
guaranteed.
"On senior night, [sometimesl
it's so emotional you really don't
start out well," coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "Our start won the
game for us."
After trading baskets to start
the game, the Cardinal reeled off

a 38-10 run to seal the victory. All
five starters and freshman Naomi
Mulitauaopele took part in the
festivities, led by sophomore Kate
Starbird and Kaplan. Kaplan
scored 15 points while Starbird
scored nine points, stole a pass
and assisted on two of Kaplan's
baskets. Paye also played stellar
defense with two steals, and
added six points. Sophomore
