Oregon 55
Stanford 97

As freshmen on the Stanford
women's basketball team four
years ago, they cut the nets after
winning the Pacific 10 Confer
ence and the NCAA champi
onships in Los Angeles. This year,
they started the process again.
Anita Kaplan, Rachel Hemmer
and Kate Paye, honored at Satur
day's Senior Recognition Night
for their accomplishments and
contributions, capped the evening
by climbing up a ladder and cut
ting a piece of the Maples Pavilion
net for themselves. With the
Stanford victory over Oregon (16-
9 overall, 9-7 in the Pac-10), the
Cardinal (24-2, 15-1 in the Pac
-10) clinched an outright confer
ence championship for the third
time in the trio's four years on
campus. During those four years,
Stanford has compiled a 105-17
record including a 36-0 record at
home in Pac-10 conference
games.
While the 97-55 victory to cap
ture the Pac-10 crown was impor
tant, the Cardinal has another
title in its sights.
"One of [the team's] first goals
was to take care of the Pac-10
championship," Hemmer said.
"Then the national champi
onship."
Stanford had already ensured
itself a share of the conference

championship before the game
against the Ducks with the victo
ry over Oregon State Thursday
night. It took only a few minutes
before the outright title became
guaranteed.
"On senior night, [sometimesl
it's so emotional you really don't
start out well," coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "Our start won the
game for us."
After trading baskets to start
the game, the Cardinal reeled off

a 38-10 run to seal the victory. All
five starters and freshman Naomi
Mulitauaopele took part in the
festivities, led by sophomore Kate
Starbird and Kaplan. Kaplan
scored 15 points while Starbird
scored nine points, stole a pass
and assisted on two of Kaplan's
baskets. Paye also played stellar
defense with two steals, and
added six points. Sophomore

Jamila Wideman also assisted on
four baskets and contributed three
of Stanford's points.
The highlights of the stretch
were two coast-to-coast drives by
Wideman and Mulitauaopele. On
the first, Wideman dribbled the
length of the court, split the Duck
defenders and made a scooped two
handed underhand layup. The sec
ond time occurred when Muli
tauaopele stole the ball from Sandie
Edwards and broke away for the
uncontested layup which brought
the 7,113 in the crowd to its feet.
The Cardinal went on one more
run at the end of the half. During
the half's final 2 minutes, 39 sec
onds, Stanford outscored Oregon 8-
0 to build the lead up to 33. With
one second remaining on the clock,
freshman Kristin Folkl nailed a
jumpier. The first half ended with
the score resting at 54-21.
Kaplan led the Cardinal with 17
points at the half. In a performance
reminiscent of her game against
USC on Jan. 28, she made all eight
of her attempts from the floor.
Nearly as impressive was the entire
Stanford team. Of the 11 players
who spent time on the court, 10 of
them scored. The Cardinal shot
63.3 percent from the floor and
committed only five turnovers. In
addition, Stanford dominated the
boards. The Cardinal out-rebound
ed the Ducks by 20, 27-7.
"We had an excellent first half,"
VanDerveer noted." Anita was fin
ishing really well. When they have
a player as good as [junior Renae]
Fegent, when she picks up two
quick fouls, that's going to change
the game."
Many of Oregon's players
encountered foul trouble early. The
Ducks were called for 15 fouls in
the half, with three players tallying
three apiece and another three

with two. Only seven members of
Oregon's team played in the half
(and in the game).
With the Ducks playing their
starters most of the game, the Car
dinal second team still defeated
Oregon 43-34.
One of the players that shone in
the second half was freshman
Heather Owen. She played almost
half of the game and scored a
career-high 13 points. Owen con
verted two three-point plays and
grabbed six rebounds while making
four of five from the floor.
Junior Bobbie Kelsey also had a
solid game scoring 11 points and
hitting a long three pointer. Muli
tauaopele ended the contest with
10 points on 5-of-6 shooting. Wide
man contributed nine points and
led the team with five assists.
Leading the team in rebounds for
the second consecutive game was
Folkl, who finished with eight
boards while scoring four points
and assisting on three other bas
kets.
However, the night belonged to
the seniors, especially Kaplan. She
finished with 24 points to lead the
Cardinal on 11-of-14 from the
floor. Paye helped out with seven
points and three steals and Hem
mer, although she scored only
three points, was a presence on the
court and inside with four
rebounds and three assists.
After the game, Kaplan reflected
on the team and what it means to
everyone associated with it.
"The team is like a second fami
ly for everyone," she said. "It's not
over yet but... Rachel, Kate and I
are going to be moving on and
that's a happy / sad situation."
Hemmer has a goal of playing a
few more games with the team in
her Stanford career.
"We're going to be playing on
the road a lot," she said. "This is
not good enough. We're not going
to be satisfied until we're cutting
down the nets in Minneapolis [the
site of the 1995 Final Four]."

winning the Pacific 10 Confer
ence and the NCAA champi
onships in Los Angeles. This year,
they started the process again.
Anita Kaplan, Rachel Hemmer
and Kate Paye, honored at Satur
day's Senior Recognition Night
for their accomplishments and
contributions, capped the evening
by climbing up a ladder and cut
ting a piece of the Maples Pavilion
net for themselves. With the
Stanford victory over Oregon (16-
9 overall, 9-7 in the Pac-10), the
Cardinal (24-2, 15-1 in the Pac
-10) clinched an outright confer
ence championship for the third
time in the trio's four years on
campus. During those four years,
Stanford has compiled a 105-17
record including a 36-0 record at
home in Pac-10 conference
games.
While the 97-55 victory to cap
ture the Pac-10 crown was impor
tant, the Cardinal has another
title in its sights.
"One of [the team's] first goals
was to take care of the Pac-10
championship," Hemmer said.
"Then the national champi
onship."
Stanford had already ensured
itself a share of the conference

championship before the game
against the Ducks with the victo
ry over Oregon State Thursday
night. It took only a few minutes
before the outright title became
guaranteed.
"On senior night, [sometimesl
it's so emotional you really don't
start out well," coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "Our start won the
game for us."
After trading baskets to start
the game, the Cardinal reeled off

a 38-10 run to seal the victory. All
five starters and freshman Naomi
Mulitauaopele took part in the
festivities, led by sophomore Kate
Starbird and Kaplan. Kaplan
scored 15 points while Starbird
scored nine points, stole a pass
and assisted on two of Kaplan's
baskets. Paye also played stellar
defense with two steals, and
added six points. Sophomore

Senior guard Kate Paye battles Oregon's Cindie Edamura (21) and
Jessica Schutt (30) for a loose ball.
Jamila Wideman also assisted on
four baskets and contributed three
of Stanford's points.
The highlights of the stretch
were two coast-to-coast drives by
Wideman and Mulitauaopele. On
the first, Wideman dribbled the
length of the court, split the Duck
defenders and made a scooped two
handed underhand layup. The sec
ond time occurred when Muli
tauaopele stole the ball from Sandie
Edwards and broke away for the
uncontested layup which brought
the 7,113 in the crowd to its feet.
The Cardinal went on one more
run at the end of the half. During
the half's final 2 minutes, 39 sec
onds, Stanford outscored Oregon 8-
0 to build the lead up to 33. With
one second remaining on the clock,
freshman Kristin Folkl nailed a
jumpier. The first half ended with
the score resting at 54-21.
Kaplan led the Cardinal with 17
points at the half. In a performance
reminiscent of her game against
USC on Jan. 28, she made all eight
of her attempts from the floor.
Nearly as impressive was the entire
Stanford team. Of the 11 players
who spent time on the court, 10 of
them scored. The Cardinal shot
63.3 percent from the floor and
committed only five turnovers. In
addition, Stanford dominated the
boards. The Cardinal out-rebound
ed the Ducks by 20, 27-7.
"We had an excellent first half,"
VanDerveer noted." Anita was fin
ishing really well. When they have
a player as good as [junior Renae]
Fegent, when she picks up two
quick fouls, that's going to change
the game."
Many of Oregon's players
encountered foul trouble early. The
Ducks were called for 15 fouls in
the half, with three players tallying
three apiece and another three

with two. Only seven members of
Oregon's team played in the half
(and in the game).
With the Ducks playing their
starters most of the game, the Car
dinal second team still defeated
Oregon 43-34.
One of the players that shone in
the second half was freshman
Heather Owen. She played almost
half of the game and scored a
career-high 13 points. Owen con
verted two three-point plays and
grabbed six rebounds while making
four of five from the floor.
Junior Bobbie Kelsey also had a
solid game scoring 11 points and
hitting a long three pointer. Muli
tauaopele ended the contest with
10 points on 5-of-6 shooting. Wide
man contributed nine points and
led the team with five assists.
Leading the team in rebounds for
the second consecutive game was
Folkl, who finished with eight
boards while scoring four points
and assisting on three other bas
kets.
However, the night belonged to
the seniors, especially Kaplan. She
finished with 24 points to lead the
Cardinal on 11-of-14 from the
floor. Paye helped out with seven
points and three steals and Hem
mer, although she scored only
three points, was a presence on the
court and inside with four
rebounds and three assists.
After the game, Kaplan reflected
on the team and what it means to
everyone associated with it.
"The team is like a second fami
ly for everyone," she said. "It's not
over yet but... Rachel, Kate and I
are going to be moving on and
that's a happy / sad situation."
Hemmer has a goal of playing a
few more games with the team in
her Stanford career.
"We're going to be playing on
the road a lot," she said. "This is
not good enough. We're not going
to be satisfied until we're cutting
down the nets in Minneapolis [the
site of the 1995 Final Four]."
