# Men win Pac-10s with record point total
## Swimmers' 14th straight league crown also sets new mark

Stanford: 1042. Arizona State: 509.
Let the numbers speak for themselves. In Long
Beach this weekend, the Stanford men's swimming
team more than doubled the point total of the sec
ond-place Sun Devils on its way to setting a new
Pacific 10 Conference record for total points and,
with its 14th in a row, a new league mark for con
secutive team championships in a sport.
Former UCLA basketball head coach John
Wooden was present Saturday to present the award
to the Cardinal — it was the Bruins' string of 13
championships that the Cardinal beat.
"It means an awful lot to [head coach Skip Ken
neyj," said assistant coach Ted Knapp. "I didn't go
through his first two years when we weren't win
ning, but he has a little more perspective. Obvious
ly, it's an incredible accomplishment."
For the swimmers, it was hard to really put the
victory in perspective, especially since it's a sec
ondary goal to the national championship.
"That was a neat honor for [Wooden] to show
up," said senior Dan Kanner. "It was kind of a spe
cial moment — something I'll reflect on more when
I'm much older. It's something we share with all of
the swimmers back to the early '80s. There should
have been 1000 Stanford swimmers there to accept
the award."
For freshman Scott Claypool, it was a reminder
of Stanford tradition.
"We've talked a lot about the shoulders we're
standing on," Claypool said. "I was really excited to
contribute."
Beyond the record, Stanford had many other
objectives this weekend — namely, NCAA Champi
onship preparation.
"I walked away from the weekend feeling really
good about our chances at NCAAs," said senior co-
