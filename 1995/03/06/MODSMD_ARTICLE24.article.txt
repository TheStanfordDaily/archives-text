# Men win Pac-10s with record point total
## Swimmers' 14th straight league crown also sets new mark 
### John Fabian Contributing writer 
Stanford: 1042. Arizona State: 509.
Let the numbers speak for themselves. In Long
Beach this weekend, the Stanford men's swimming
team more than doubled the point total of the sec
ond-place Sun Devils on its way to setting a new
Pacific 10 Conference record for total points and,
with its 14th in a row, a new league mark for con
secutive team championships in a sport.
Former UCLA basketball head coach John
Wooden was present Saturday to present the award
to the Cardinal — it was the Bruins' string of 13
championships that the Cardinal beat.
"It means an awful lot to [head coach Skip Ken
neyj," said assistant coach Ted Knapp. "I didn't go
through his first two years when we weren't win
ning, but he has a little more perspective. Obvious
ly, it's an incredible accomplishment."
For the swimmers, it was hard to really put the
victory in perspective, especially since it's a sec
ondary goal to the national championship.
"That was a neat honor for [Wooden] to show
up," said senior Dan Kanner. "It was kind of a spe
cial moment — something I'll reflect on more when
I'm much older. It's something we share with all of
the swimmers back to the early '80s. There should
have been 1000 Stanford swimmers there to accept
the award."
For freshman Scott Claypool, it was a reminder
of Stanford tradition.
"We've talked a lot about the shoulders we're
standing on," Claypool said. "I was really excited to
contribute."
Beyond the record, Stanford had many other
objectives this weekend — namely, NCAA Champi
onship preparation.
"I walked away from the weekend feeling really
good about our chances at NCAAs," said senior co-

points.
captain Clay Tippins.
All the Cardinal did was win all
five relays in the three-day meet,
and 10 of 13 individual events.
The 400-yard medley relay team
of seniors Brian Retterer, Kurt
Grote, Tippins and junior Joe
Hudepohl set a new Pac-10
record, despite the fact that all
four were swimming unshaved.
Stanford captured the top
three places in the 200-yard indi
vidual medley and the 100-yard
backstroke. These feats are
impressive in a dual meet, but
much more impressive with five
other teams, three of them
ranked in the top 10.
The Cardinal had four double
winners of individual events,
including freshman Tom Wilkens
(200- and 400-yard IM), Hude
pohl (100- and 200-yard
freestyle), Grote (100- and 200-
yard breaststroke) and Retterer
(100- and 200-yard backstroke).
Most importantly, however,
the Cardinal's goal this weekend
was to qualify as many swimmers
as possible for the NCAA champi
onships March 23 to 25. While
No. 1 Michigan qualified 12 swim
mers, the Cardinal had hoped to
take more members along to Indi
anapolis to score more points.
"The team went in and accom
plished most of its objectives,"
Kanner said.
Although Stanford will have to
wait for notice from the NCAA,

the Cardinal expects that 16 of its
swimmers will be invited, to go
along with Jamie Edwards and
David Johns of the diving team.
Perhaps the best result of last
weekend was the performance of
the Cardinal freshmen. Although
Michigan's freshmen are highly
touted, Stanford's young crop is
more than ready to take them on.
"Michigan's freshman class
was the reason they are favored,"
Knapp said. "But they are taking
three and we are taking five. I
believe ours will contribute
more."
The five freshmen include
Wilkens, Sabir Muhammad, who
won the 100-yard butterfly this
weekend, Scott Claypool, who
took first in the 50-yard free and
was runner-up in the 100-yard
free, Andre Salles-Cunha and
Chris Olson.
"The biggest surprise was the
freshmen," Tippins said.
"They've gone really far towards
equalizing what was seen as
Michigan's advantage."
Claypool offers a lot of the
credit for his and his classmates'
performances to the closeness
and support of the team.
"Everyone's learning to pull
their own weight," Claypool said.
"This weekend everyone made me
believe I could do it. I surprised
myself, but not my teammates.
Their belief made the difference."
Finally, Stanford's success this
weekend let Michigan know that
the three-time defending national
champion Cardinal is going to be
a force to be reckoned with at the
NCAAs.
