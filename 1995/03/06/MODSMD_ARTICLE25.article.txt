Stanford 16 15 15

This weekend could have ended like a Cin
derella fairy tale for the No. 2 Stanford
men's volleyball team; instead, it turned out
to be closer to a Shakespearean tragedy.
After trouncing the University of the
Pacific (16-14, 15-13, 15-2) on Friday night,
the Cardinal (10-3 overall, 7-2 in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) lost the next
night to No. 8 Cal State-Northridge in a dis
appointing five game match (12-15, 15-11,
15-12, 10-15, 17-19). The loss to the Mata
dors sets Stanford back to second place in the
Pacific Division behind Hawaii.
Against the tough but unranked Tigers
(3-8, 1-8 in the MPSF), the Cardinal did not
look sharp early on in its passing or hitting,
committing uncharacteristic errors, but
ended the night with strong numbers.
"We struggled a little early on," said coach
Ruben Nieves. "I didn't think we did the job

defensively, but our passing was good. There
were a lot of bright spots."
Junior swing hitter Mike Lambert collect
ed 27 kills and a .579 hitting percentage.
Sophomore swing hitter Matt Fuerbringer
hit .400 for 19 kills and opposite hitter Brian
Moore followed with 18 kills and a .519 per
centage. On the Tigers' side of the net, oppo
site hitter Greg Wakeham tallied 24 kills but
only hit .261.
"[Pacific] came out and played well,"
Fuerbringer said. "We didn't play bad, but
we didn't capitalize on all their mistakes.
Our side-out game stayed pretty steady,
though, and all of the other stuff, Like block
ing plays, really came together in the third
game."
After definitively taming the Tigers, Stan
ford entered Saturday night's match vs.
Northridge (6-5, 6-4 in the MPSF) with high
hopes of reinforcing their position as No. 1 in
the Pacific Division. With a win, the Cardinal
would be 8-1 in the league versus Hawaii's 7-

sse

1. Also, Ball State swept No. 1 UCLA Friday
night, so a win for Stanford would most like
ly have garnered it some number one votes.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal did not capi
talize on this opportunity and fell to the revi
talized Matadors.
"We were clearly the better team," said
freshman middle blocker Keenan White
hurst. "But, we didn't get the job done when
we needed to — we had so many chances to
put them away. It's a real tough loss."
Northridge came out in game one and
established its jump serving early, led by out
side hitter Jason Hughes, the No. 1 server in
the country with a .478 ace average. The
Cardinal passers could not handle the bar
rage and even though it was ahead 10-8, the
Matadors quickly ended the game.
To counter Northridge's serving, Stanford
made a key lineup change to establish
stronger passing by substituting freshman
swing hitter Tad Hoffman for
Moore.
"We were down 0-4 when I Hoff
man | went in," Nieves said, "but we
came back and won the game. Tad
did his job and stabilized our pass
ing, we were able to turn the match
around and take games two and
three."
In the critical fourth game, Stan
ford held a sizable lead on three dif
ferent occasions, but in all cases let
Northridge back into the game. At
10-6, the Cardinal faltered for one
key spell that eventually cost it the
match. The Matadors' serving, on
top of Stanford errors with hitting,
mishandled halls and passing, let it

blaze from six points to 14 in a short
space of time.
With the match tied at two
games apiece, the Cardinal entered
game five strong and pulled to a
convincing 12-9 lead; three sideouts
would have been enough for a win.
However, at a critical juncture, both
Lambert and Fuerbringer missed
hits and let Northridge score off
their serving. From 14-13 on, Stan
ford never regained match point
again.
"They made just the one or two
extra plays it Lakes to win a close
match," Nieves said. "It was a
match that we could have and
should have won, but we just didn't
have that killer instinct. We had
them on the ropes but we let them
ofF the hook.
"It's a disappointing loss for us
— it doesn't kill us. but it hurts."
