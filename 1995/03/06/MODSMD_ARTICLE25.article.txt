This weekend could have ended like a Cin
derella fairy tale for the No. 2 Stanford
men's volleyball team; instead, it turned out
to be closer to a Shakespearean tragedy.
After trouncing the University of the
Pacific (16-14, 15-13, 15-2) on Friday night,
the Cardinal (10-3 overall, 7-2 in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) lost the next
night to No. 8 Cal State-Northridge in a dis
appointing five game match (12-15, 15-11,
15-12, 10-15, 17-19). The loss to the Mata
dors sets Stanford back to second place in the
Pacific Division behind Hawaii.
Against the tough but unranked Tigers
(3-8, 1-8 in the MPSF), the Cardinal did not
look sharp early on in its passing or hitting,
committing uncharacteristic errors, but
ended the night with strong numbers.
"We struggled a little early on," said coach
Ruben Nieves. "I didn't think we did the job

defensively, but our passing was good. There
were a lot of bright spots."
Junior swing hitter Mike Lambert collect
ed 27 kills and a .579 hitting percentage.
Sophomore swing hitter Matt Fuerbringer
hit .400 for 19 kills and opposite hitter Brian
Moore followed with 18 kills and a .519 per
centage. On the Tigers' side of the net, oppo
site hitter Greg Wakeham tallied 24 kills but
only hit .261.
"[Pacific] came out and played well,"
Fuerbringer said. "We didn't play bad, but
we didn't capitalize on all their mistakes.
Our side-out game stayed pretty steady,
though, and all of the other stuff, Like block
ing plays, really came together in the third
game."
After definitively taming the Tigers, Stan
ford entered Saturday night's match vs.
Northridge (6-5, 6-4 in the MPSF) with high
hopes of reinforcing their position as No. 1 in
the Pacific Division. With a win, the Cardinal
would be 8-1 in the league versus Hawaii's 7-

sse

1. Also, Ball State swept No. 1 UCLA Friday
night, so a win for Stanford would most like
ly have garnered it some number one votes.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal did not capi
talize on this opportunity and fell to the revi
talized Matadors.
"We were clearly the better team," said
freshman middle blocker Keenan White
hurst. "But, we didn't get the job done when
we needed to — we had so many chances to
put them away. It's a real tough loss."
Northridge came out in game one and
established its jump serving early, led by out
side hitter Jason Hughes, the No. 1 server in
the country with a .478 ace average. The
Cardinal passers could not handle the bar
rage and even though it was ahead 10-8, the
Matadors quickly ended the game.
To counter Northridge's serving, Stanford
made a key lineup change to establish
stronger passing by substituting freshman
