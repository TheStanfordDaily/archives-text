## Six swimmers not fast enough 
### Ezra Baylin Contributing writer 
Disappointment, yearnings for one
more chance and despair that the times
just could have been a little faster char
acterized the reaction to this weekend's
Stanford Invitational swimming meet.
Six members of the top-ranked Cardinal
women's swimming team looked to
make national championship qualifying
cuts but none of the athletes succeeded.
"It was a disappointment because
none of us made the times we were look
ing for," said freshman Kristen Nywei
de. "I went the same time I did at Pac
10s last weekend, but at least it is still a
provisional cut in the 200-yard breast."
To go to the NCAA Championships, a
swimmer can qualify in one of two ways.
The NCAA posts an automatic qualify
ing standard time at the beginning of the
year, and any swimmer who swims
faster than that cutoff during the regu
lar season gets a chance to swim in that
event at the national championships.
However, the NCAA also creates a
time cut-off slightly slower than the
automatic cut for each event, called the
provisional standard. A swimmer who
makes the provisional standard may or
may not be invited to swim at the nation
al meet.
A committee meets to decide how
many of the provisional qualifiers to
invite, and they have the discretion to
invite as many or as few provisional
qualifiers as they want. Generally, the
number of provisional qualifiers that
gets invited depends on how many swim
mers make the automatic cut. Obvious
ly, a higher number of automatic quali

fiers means that less provisional swim
mers get a chance to compete.
Stanford's swimmers were trying to
improve their provisional cuts to auto
matic qualifying times, but even fresh
man hopefuls Nyweide and Michelle
Collins could not break the NCAA barri
er. Collins was able to post a personal
best in the 100-yard butterfly, but both
swimmers will have to wait and see if
their provisional times are good enough
this year.
"I'm happy with them because they
swam hard," said head coach Richard
Quick. "I just wish for their sakes that
they had swam a little faster, but they all
did well."
Both Collins and Nyweide could still
be part of the national team, but Quick
also emphasizes that they are both
freshmen with three years left to con

tribute. "There are real possibilities for
these girls next year," Quick said.
None of the other swimmers who
attempted to beat the NCAA's fastest
cut were successful this weekend either.
Freshmen Evi Byer, junior Allison and
sophomores Jane Kelsey and Amanda
White all came just short of their NCAA
goals.
However, the real challenge for the
team lies ahead, as the Cardinal puts its
No. 1 ranking on the line at the NCAA
Championships in Austin, Texas on
March 14.
"We have a strong team this year, but
it is going to be a tough team battle
between USC, Michigan and us." Quick
said. "Even though USC did not do too
well at the conference meet, they have
great athletes and will be tough competi
tion for us."
