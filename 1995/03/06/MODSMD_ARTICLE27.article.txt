# Doubles pairs will battle each other
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
They say it never rains in Southern
California, but don't tell that to the
Stanford men's tennis team (12-0).
Two Cardinal doubles teams
advanced to the semifinals of the Pacif
ic Coast Men's Doubles Championships
in La Jolla, Calif., yesterday, only to be
forced to fly back to school after the
day's matches were postponed due to
rain.
"After missing a week of school to
play [at National Team Indoor Champi
onships] in Louisville, and then leaving
Thursday for La Jolla, we really needed
to catch up on our studies," said Stan
ford sophomore Grant Elliott, adding,
"We're student-athletes, you see. Stu
dents first, then athletes."
The other two doubles teams remain
ing in the mostly collegiate doubles
tournament also could not stay for a
Monday makeup match because they
too had to return to classes at Pepper
dine and USC.
What all this means is that one of the
semifinal matches will be made up on
the courts of Stanford Tennis Stadium
today at 2:30 p.m., as the top-seeded
Stanford duo of Scott Humphries and
Paul Goldstein will take on lOth-seeded

teammates Jeff Salzenstein and Elliott.
The winner of today's match will take
on the victor of a semifinal match to be
played about 400 miles south between
second-seeded Troy Budgin and Brad
Sceney of Pepperdine and ninth-seeded
Trojans Adam Peterson and Lukas Hov
orka. The Final-round match will be
played at a mutually convenient time
and place in the near future, possibly
when Stanford next meets Pepperdine
or USC in a dual match.
Whatever the outcome of today's
match, Stanford head coach Dick Gould
will be pleased with the overall perfor
mance of his doubles teams in the 106-
year-old tournament, especially after
they struggled during last week's
important Indoors, winning just four
out of nine doubles matches against top
ranked teams.
"Coming in off the Indoors, you
would have expected a little letdown
from these guys," Gould said. "But you
didn't see it."
The team's sub-par performance in
previous doubles matches prompted
Gould to switch the sides played by both
his Nos. 1 and 3 doubles players.
"It worked," Gould said of the
switch.
Playing well on their new sides of the
court, Humphries and Goldstein rolled

into the semis, winning their second
round match against Pennsylvania's
lan Enverda and Andreas Olofsson, 6-1,
6-2; defeating Pepperdine's John
Lundquist and Hide Sakamoto in the
third round, 6-1, 6-0; and beating sixth
seeded Brett Hansen and Fernando
Samayor of USC, 6-4, 6-4.
Salzenstein and Elliott advanced by
defeating the Quakers' J.J. Cramer and
Brad Goldberg, 7-5, 6-1, followed by a
third-round victory over San Diego's
Randy Nixon and Frank Gannis, 6-4, 3-
6, 7-5; and a 6-4, 6-2 quarterfinal defeat
of 17-year-old twins Bob Bryan and
Mike Bryan, National Team members
who might wear Cardinal red during
their collegiate years.
"We were playing good doubles,"
Elliott said, "which was nice because we
haven't played well in awhile."
Stanford's No. 2 tandem of Jim
Thomas and Ricky Becker, seeded
eighth, won their first two matches but
bowed out in the quarters to Aussies
Budgin and Sceney, 6-4, 2-6, 6-2.
"We had the momentum after win
ning the first set," Thomas said, "but
they broke us first in the third, and that
helped them because they were the type
of team that tightens up when they're
down, and relaxes and plays better
when they're ahead."
