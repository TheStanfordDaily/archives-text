# Golf finishes 3rd, ASU romps

### John Lawson Contributing writer 
Things ran true to form this weekend at
the Stanford Golf Course.
The top- ranked and two-time defending
national champion Arizona State Sun Dev
ils posted the lowest scores for each of the
three rounds of the Stanford Women's
Intercollegiate tournament en route to an
four-under-par team score of 872.
No. 2 San Jose State gave Arizona State
their only real competition of the tourna
ment, golfing their way to the second lowest
scores of each round and finishing with a
final tally of 883.
No. 3 Stanford, playing on its home
course for the first time this year, fired a
905 and finished in third place.
In NCAA golf, five players compete in
every round of a tournament. The highest
individual score for each round is dropped,
and the final team score is tabulated by
adding the remaining four golfers' scores
together.
"We played well for the first 15 or 16
holes of each round," said head coach Tim
Baldwin. "But we lost a lot of strokes to Ari
zona State and San Jose State in those last
couple of holes. We know we can play with
those top schools; we just need to close out
our rounds well."
Sun Devil first-team All-Americans
Heather Bowie and Wendy Ward, who
placed first and second, respectively, at last
week's Arizona Invitational in Tucson, ran
away from the field and shared individual
title honors with four-under-par scores of
215.

Sophomore Mhairi McKay (223), who
tied for sixth, and junior Vicky Strada
(224), who finished in eighth, led the way
for the Cardinal. Senior Jamille Jose (230)
and sophomore Andrea Baxter (230) fin
ished in a four-way tie for 22nd, while
senior Amy Lawrence (235) placed in a
three-way tie for 35th.
"Arizona State is an outstanding team
with extremely talented players," Baldwin
said. "What I'm impressed with is the play
of San Jose State's two freshmen, Monica
Stratton and Cecilia Aim [who finished in
third and fifth place, respectively]. They
have really improved since we played them
last fall. If they keep playing like that, then
we're going to have our work cut out for
us."
Fifteen teams in all competed in the 31st
annual Stanford Intercollegiate, including
the top five ranked teams in the nation,
according to Golf World magazine (No. 4
Tulsa finished sixth and No. 5 UCLA
fourth).
Eighty-four golfers staked a claim at the
individual title, including nine who played
as "individuals" — alternates whose scores
did not factor into their team's. For the
Cardinal, juniors Julie Bowen (236) and
Kathpoi Weber (239) finished tied for 38th
and tied for 43rd, respectively.
Stanford is home for several weeks
before traveling to Tempe, Ariz., to take
part in the Sun Devil Invitational from
March 31 to April 2. These precious days off
from tournaments should give the golfers
time to practice their golf game and catch
up on something just as important — their
studies.
