# No. 2 linksters are favored to dominate at Duck Invite
## 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
In and of itself, the men's golf tourna
ment hosted by the University of Oregon
today and tomorrow doesn't hold a
tremendous amount of significance as far
as the whole season is concerned. Even its
name, the Duck Invitational, seems a bit
innocuous.
"This really isn't one of our biggest
tournaments," said senior All-American
Steve Burdick.
For the most part, the tournament,
held in Eugene, Ore., lacks a truly com
petitive field. The No. 2 Cardinal will bat
tle a number of schools, but none are seri
ous rivals. The two-day, 54-hole invita
tional features eight of the Pacific 10 Con
ference schools, but lacks top-10 teams
Arizona and Arizona State.
For Stanford, the tournament provides
a chance for the squad to strengthen its
standing on the West Coast against
schools that will be competing against the
Cardinal for spots in the NCAA regional
tournament.
"Looking ahead to regionals, I'd say
that we are almost certainly assured a
spot in the tournament," said head coach
Wally Goodwin. "Still though, it's always
a confidence booster to beat these teams
beforehand and I think that's all we can
try to do."
The squad also hopes to regain some of
the respect that it has lost in the last two
weeks after two rough performances in
Hawaii. For the first time this season, the
Stanford men's team is no longer the top
ranked team in the country, recently los
ing that distinction to Oklahoma State.

"Clearly, we would like to go out and
dominate," Burdick said. "It'd be great to
play our best and show everyone what
we're capable of.
"I think for the most part, though,
we're looking to just have a good all
around trip and to kind of get back on
track."
For two Stanford golfers, the tourna
ment holds a special importance — it is a
homecoming of sorts.
For senior All-American Casey Martin,
it is a homecoming in the literal sense.
Coming to Stanford from Eugene, Martin
returns to his true home course at the
Eugene Country Club.
The tournament will serve as the first
occasion that Martin will have returned to
his home course as a member of the Car
dinal. While the Duck Invitational has
been held every year, head coach Wally
Goodwin has always been hesitant to
include it in the schedule because of the
unpredictable weather there.
"I'm really looking forward to this
one," Martin said, "I grew up there so it
means a lot to me to play in front of my
family and friends."
The experience for Jerry Chang will be
markedly different. The senior is playing
with the varsity squad for the first time
since his sophomore year. Sidelined by a
back injury last season, Chang has under
gone a slow and painful recovery to top
form.
"I feel like I'm coming home, getting to
play top notch collegiate golf again,"
Chang said. "I really missed the game a
lot and now sort of realize how much I
took it for granted."
Chang defeated sophomore
Conrad Ray and junior David
Garcia in the two-round qualifier
used to determine who would
replace senior All-American Will
Yanigasawa, who is staying at
school this week to concentrate on
academics.
"Both Conrad and David are
great players," Chang said. "I was
just on my game and was able to
nick David by one."
The trio leads what is arguably
the most talented junior varsity
squad in the nation. Many of the
players could be top players at
other schools, but on a team with
four returning Ail-Americans and
freshman phenom Tiger Woods,
the task of breaking into the
starting five is daunting to say the
least.
"As far as the team is con
cerned, I think that this is an
opportunity to show our depth,"
Chang said. "With all the press
that the top five get, it's a chance
to put some of the spotlight on the
JV guys."
