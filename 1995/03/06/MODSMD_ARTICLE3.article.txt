# Hate crime
## Young males shout out slurs at Genderfuk 
### Gabriela Teodorescu Contributing writer 
Hate crime is the label campus police are
giving a incident in which five unidentified
juvenile males shouted offensive comments
to guests at the Feb. 25 Genderfuk party put
on by the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance
at Stanford.
"For about 20 minutes, the juveniles were
yelling homophobic slurs, screaming and
challenging people to fight," said Stanford
Police Sgt. John McMullen. The incident oc
curred at the Elliott Program Center around
2 a.m.
Because the juveniles challenged partygo
ers to fight, police will be able to charge them
under the hate crime statute. According to
California Penal Code, a hate crime involves
the violation of someone's civil rights by the
threat or use of force or intimidation.
While many called last year's vandalism of
Stanford's "Gay Liberation" statue a "hate
crime," the district attorney was unable to
charge the vandals under the statute because
Stanford is an institution and does not have
civil rights.
And even though Stanford's speech code
was still in effect at the time of the incident,
the code applies only to Stanford students

and would not apply to the juveniles.
Senior Frank Salisbury, a representative
of the alliance, said the juveniles "looked like
high schoolers. . . . They were using a lot of
offensive language."
"They were obviously drunk, and they
said they had just returned from a campus
party," he added.
The approximately 40-person crowd
which was gathered on the back patio asked
them to leave, Salisbury said.
Salisbury said the "ringleader" was con
stantly using words like "faggot" and "bitch "
"They began to call guys 'fags,' they start
ed making a lot of rude comments about
women's breasts and would say things like,
'That faggot hit me.' " he said.
"There were some people in drag there,
and I think that really confused these guys.
I'm not sure they realized [party guestsl were
in drag," Salisbury added.
Guests, fearing a fight, stayed to make
sure the incident was peacefully resolved, he
said.
According to Salisbury, the crowd argued
with the juveniles for about 20 to 30 minutes.
During this time, there was a lot of back and
forth between the juveniles find party guests,
