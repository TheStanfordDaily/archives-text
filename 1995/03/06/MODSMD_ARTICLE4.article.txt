# Women 'strike a balance' in looking at their history
## 
### Gabriela Teodorescu Contributing writer 
Discussing the history of women's rights on
Friday night, Aileen Hernandez, second presi
dent of the National Organization for Women,
stressed not only how far women have come
but also how far they still have to go.
The speech was the keynote address of the
third annual Women's Leadership Confer
ence, which this year had a theme of "Strik
ing a Balance."
The event was expanded and improved
this year, said junior Megan Debell, one of the
conference organizers. "This year, the con
ference is a two-day event and we have 70 del
egates, compared to 30 last year," she said.
This is also the first time the conference
has hosted a nationally l-ecognized speaker.
Hernandez, now an urban consultant and
co-chair of the National Urban Coalition,
began her lengthy speech by looking at the
history of women's rights in the 20th centu
ry. She linked early 20th century mechaniza
tion with women's entrance into the work
force.
"The mvth was that women love to do bor

ing, routine, tedious work — and so women
would love to be secretaries," Hernandez
said.
She described how laws that were at first
meant to protect women actually ended up
keeping them out of the work force. "The
Supreme Court allowed protective laws be
cause, by regulating women's health, they
were regulating the health of [their chil
dren]," she added.
Some laws, for example, said that women
could not lift more than ten pounds. "I
thought, 'How ridiculous, my purse weighs
more than ten pounds,"' Hernandez said,
drawing laughter from the crowd.
These protective laws became restrictive
to women, meaning they were barred from
traditionally male professions, she said.
"The only time there was a break in these
restrictions was during wartime — when the
nation needed women to take men's jobs,"
Hernandez said. She mentioned how the
work force began to accommodate women by
training and instituting massive child care
centers during this period.
"Then the end of the war came
and all women were supposed to go
back home," she said.
Leading in to the Civil Rights
movement, Hernandez began to
focus on one of her major topics —
the intersection between minority
and women's rights. "During this
time, a minority woman had to
work on both issues or become
schizophrenic. The movements
became veiy closely linked," she
said.
Hernandez also stressed that
women have had open opportuni
ties for only about 20 years, since
laws restricting women's access to
jobs were still around in the 19705.
Insisting that the gains women

have made are still not enough,
Hernandez said, "There are almost
no women at the top of the corpo
rate structure, and there are few
women in Congress and even fewer
in state legislatures," she said.
Her assertion that it is still
important to focus on women and
minority issues was backed up by
an example. "I am working with an
investment company, and out of
100 companies, two-thirds did not
have a female or a minority mem
ber on the board or in the first
three management positions," she
said.
She ended her speech by insist
ing that women in leadership posi
tions have to help each other and
that women have to be involved in
changing society.
The two-day conference includ
ed workshops on leadership skills,
assertiveness and public speaking.
