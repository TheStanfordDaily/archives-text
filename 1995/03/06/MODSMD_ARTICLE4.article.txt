Discussing the history of women's rights on
Friday night, Aileen Hernandez, second presi
dent of the National Organization for Women,
stressed not only how far women have come
but also how far they still have to go.
The speech was the keynote address of the
third annual Women's Leadership Confer
ence, which this year had a theme of "Strik
ing a Balance."
The event was expanded and improved
this year, said junior Megan Debell, one of the
conference organizers. "This year, the con
ference is a two-day event and we have 70 del
egates, compared to 30 last year," she said.
This is also the first time the conference
has hosted a nationally l-ecognized speaker.
Hernandez, now an urban consultant and
co-chair of the National Urban Coalition,
began her lengthy speech by looking at the
history of women's rights in the 20th centu
ry. She linked early 20th century mechaniza
tion with women's entrance into the work
force.
"The mvth was that women love to do bor

ing, routine, tedious work — and so women
would love to be secretaries," Hernandez
said.
She described how laws that were at first
meant to protect women actually ended up
keeping them out of the work force. "The
Supreme Court allowed protective laws be
cause, by regulating women's health, they
were regulating the health of [their chil
dren]," she added.
Some laws, for example, said that women
could not lift more than ten pounds. "I
thought, 'How ridiculous, my purse weighs
more than ten pounds,"' Hernandez said,
drawing laughter from the crowd.
These protective laws became restrictive
to women, meaning they were barred from
traditionally male professions, she said.
"The only time there was a break in these
restrictions was during wartime — when the
nation needed women to take men's jobs,"
Hernandez said. She mentioned how the
work force began to accommodate women by
training and instituting massive child care
centers during this period.
