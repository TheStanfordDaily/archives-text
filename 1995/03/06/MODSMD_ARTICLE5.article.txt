# Rivaling parties run for new COP
## Four will seek Platform nomination 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Brian Singer Contributing writers 
This year's Council of Presidents
election will see slates fronted by
two student-government political
parties for the first time since 1991.
Two ASSU senators and two
other student leaders announced
Saturday that they would seek the
endorsement of the People's Plat
form party for the COP race. The
candidates, who will ask for the
party's blessing tonight, are Deputy
Senate Chair Michael Choo, under
graduate senator Nicole Vazquez,
Stanford-in-Government Treasur
er Jon Oram and COP Executive
Cabinet member Rich Stolz.
The rival Students' Alliance
party will also be fronting a slate,
said ASSU senator Andre Vanier,
though he would not say who the
candidates were. He added, howev
er, the slate will have a "true" grad
uate student member.
The last four years have repeat
edly seen one political slate facing
off against other groups, such as the
Chaparral. In 1992, students elect
ed a slate entitled "I Prefer Not to
Have a COP," whose members ran
on a promise not to serve, then kept
their word.
The current COP members are
part of the People's Platform party.
"If you look at the four of us,

we're out there willing to work
hard," Oram said. "We work harder
than anyone else for the students."
Oram criticized Students' Al
liance, claiming that "they do not
believe in a proactive role for the
ASSU."
Vazquez added that Students'
Alliance is "aggressively reac
tionary" while the People's Plat
form is "aggressively proactive."
Running under the appellation
"We Deserve Better," one of the
candidates' main issues is to exam
ine how the ASSU spends its
money.
"We want to bring fiscal respon
sibility back to the ASSU," Oram
said. "Students are concerned that
the ASSU is wasting their time and
their money. We want to look at the
service projects and see which ones
aren't working and what money is
being wasted."
As a relative outsider to the
ASSU, Oram said he would bring to
the COP his experience as treasurer
of SIG â€” the budget of which he re
cently cut by one-third.
"I'm very interested in coming in
here next year and, like Ross Perot
said, getting under the hood and
seeing what I can fix," he said.
In order to enact fiscal restraint,
Choo said, ineffective projects need
to be cut and others should be com
bined to maximize investment and
