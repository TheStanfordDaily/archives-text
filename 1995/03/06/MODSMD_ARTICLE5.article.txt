# Rivaling parties run for new COP
## Four will seek Platform nomination 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Brian Singer Contributing writers 
This year's Council of Presidents
election will see slates fronted by
two student-government political
parties for the first time since 1991.
Two ASSU senators and two
other student leaders announced
Saturday that they would seek the
endorsement of the People's Plat
form party for the COP race. The
candidates, who will ask for the
party's blessing tonight, are Deputy
Senate Chair Michael Choo, under
graduate senator Nicole Vazquez,
Stanford-in-Government Treasur
er Jon Oram and COP Executive
Cabinet member Rich Stolz.
The rival Students' Alliance
party will also be fronting a slate,
said ASSU senator Andre Vanier,
though he would not say who the
candidates were. He added, howev
er, the slate will have a "true" grad
uate student member.
The last four years have repeat
edly seen one political slate facing
off against other groups, such as the
Chaparral. In 1992, students elect
ed a slate entitled "I Prefer Not to
Have a COP," whose members ran
on a promise not to serve, then kept
their word.
The current COP members are
part of the People's Platform party.
"If you look at the four of us,

we're out there willing to work
hard," Oram said. "We work harder
than anyone else for the students."
Oram criticized Students' Al
liance, claiming that "they do not
believe in a proactive role for the
ASSU."
Vazquez added that Students'
Alliance is "aggressively reac
tionary" while the People's Plat
form is "aggressively proactive."
Running under the appellation
"We Deserve Better," one of the
candidates' main issues is to exam
ine how the ASSU spends its
money.
"We want to bring fiscal respon
sibility back to the ASSU," Oram
said. "Students are concerned that
the ASSU is wasting their time and
their money. We want to look at the
service projects and see which ones
aren't working and what money is
being wasted."
As a relative outsider to the
ASSU, Oram said he would bring to
the COP his experience as treasurer
of SIG â€” the budget of which he re
cently cut by one-third.
"I'm very interested in coming in
here next year and, like Ross Perot
said, getting under the hood and
seeing what I can fix," he said.
In order to enact fiscal restraint,
Choo said, ineffective projects need
to be cut and others should be com
bined to maximize investment and
reduce operating costs.
Me suggested, as an example of
cutting costs, that ASSU lecture
notes be placet! on the World Wide
Web with students paying for a
password rather than for copies.
The emphasis on fiscal restraint
will not stop the creation of new,
necessary service projects, Choo
said. lie praised the ASSU's work
on its Bus Back the Axe service pro
ject, which provided buses to Big
Game for 850 students. He also
proposed a bike theft insurance
project for next year.
Vazquez said she wants to make

the ASSU "relevant to student life
and the Stanford community at
large." She proposed, as an exam
ple, a review of Food Service and
making meal plans more flexible
and less expensive.
More student-administration
interaction is also needed, Choo
said. He praised the creation of the
joint task force which recently
crafted the new Stanford Fund
alumni-giving policy.
"We deserve a real voice in Uni
versity decision-making. We will
push for a student on the Universi
ty Cabinet," Choo said. "We want
to have an open town hall meeting
with the trustees to talk about
tuition and financial aid."
The slate will also work on aca
demic issues and attempt to

improve teaching and advising by
putting course evaluations on the
World Wide Web and giving awards
to professors for outstanding
teaching and advising, Vazquez
said.
To deal with graduate issues,
Choo said, they will circulate a
needs assessment survey to all
graduate students this spring.
"This will demonstrate our com
mitment and focus to graduate
issues," Vazquez said, adding that
graduate student housing is a
major issue which needs to be
examined.
Campus safety will also be an
important campaign issue Choo
said, adding that more lights and
phones are necessary.
In order to learn students' opin

ions on issues, Choo suggested
instituting a monthly poll conduct
ed jointly by the ASSU and The
Daily.
He said that the poll will provide
"an accurate mechanism to get stu
dent input on issues." The poll
would be run by students, utilizing
the statistical expertise of profes
sors, he said.
The poll will also ameliorate past
problems in communication
between the COP and the students,
Vazquez said. "Students have been
disempowered in the past," she
added.
The candidates said they woul(l
campaign by knocking on doors and
talking directly with students.
"This will not be a flyer campaign,"
Vazquez said.
