Four Oakland youths confronted top
level entertainment executives about
the quality of the media as part of this
weekend's second annual conference on
the role of the entertainment media in
the lives of children.
"We need to see a better job of inte
grating morality issues and the good
parts of TV into the programming of the
kids we need to reach," concluded Justin
Vandenberg, a 17-year-old high school

junior.
The event, which ran Friday and Sat
urday at the Children's Hospital, was
sponsored by Children Now, a national
advocate of children's issues. UCLA and
Stanford co-sponsored the conference.
Over 100 executives, from news re
porters to filmmakers to network presi
dents, attended six panel discussions as
well as a keynote address by Richard
Frank, who is both president of the
Academy of Television Arts and Sciences
and chairman of Walt Disney Television
and Telecommunications.

Noted attendees were Ted Harbert,
president of ABC Entertainment, John
Agoglia, president of NBC Productions,
George Vradenburg, executive vice pres
ident of Fox and NBC anchor Tom
Brokaw.
From the outset, it was evident that
the children — who ranged in age from
12 to 17 — did not equate television with
reality.
"I like 'Full House' even though it's
unrealistic," said 12-year-old Sarah
