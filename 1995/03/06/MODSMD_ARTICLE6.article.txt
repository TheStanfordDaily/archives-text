### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Four Oakland youths confronted top
level entertainment executives about
the quality of the media as part of this
weekend's second annual conference on
the role of the entertainment media in
the lives of children.
"We need to see a better job of inte
grating morality issues and the good
parts of TV into the programming of the
kids we need to reach," concluded Justin
Vandenberg, a 17-year-old high school

junior.
The event, which ran Friday and Sat
urday at the Children's Hospital, was
sponsored by Children Now, a national
advocate of children's issues. UCLA and
Stanford co-sponsored the conference.
Over 100 executives, from news re
porters to filmmakers to network presi
dents, attended six panel discussions as
well as a keynote address by Richard
Frank, who is both president of the
Academy of Television Arts and Sciences
and chairman of Walt Disney Television
and Telecommunications.

Noted attendees were Ted Harbert,
president of ABC Entertainment, John
Agoglia, president of NBC Productions,
George Vradenburg, executive vice pres
ident of Fox and NBC anchor Tom
Brokaw.
From the outset, it was evident that
the children — who ranged in age from
12 to 17 — did not equate television with
reality.
"I like 'Full House' even though it's
unrealistic," said 12-year-old Sarah
Mirabelli. "I'm smart enough to
know not to pick things up."
Julie Sohn, 15, concurred. "I
don't think the shows I watch are
really like my life."
These comments set the tone for
what was to be a grilling session,
putting Vradenburg, Harbert and
Showtime and Viacom President
Winston Cox on the spot.
The youths did not hold back
from expressing their opinions, at
times drawing audience reactions
from surprise to applause.
"You do a very poor job of actu
ally talking in a kid's manner," said
Vandenberg, whose favorite show
is "Seinfeld" because it deals with
more "mundane problems like

balding and bad conversational
ists."
"You end up having a show with
no meaning to kids," he said.
Vandenberg said that, although
he grew up watching "G.I. Joe," he
was not adversely affected because
he "had parents who had the time
to explain these things to me.
That's not always the case right
now."
Harbert, however, refused to
accept their opinions as necessarily
representative of children as a
whole.
"Not everybody your age is the
same way," he said.
The teens criticized afternoon
shows for always waiting until the
last few minutes to preach a mes
sage and for creating a dichotomy
between a show's plot and its
moral.
Harbert agreed by adding, "We

just have to do a better job of not
being so obvious."
Other panel topics included role
and responsibility, and gender and
ethnic roles in the media.
Throughout the discussions,
panelists praised some produc
tions, such as the basketball docu
mentary "Hoop Dreams." Most
time, however, was spent criticiz
ing the amount of violence in
shows.
Producers in the audience oflen
found themselves vigorously
defending their shows against the
allegations made by panel mem
bers. Charles Maslin, executive
producer of "Beverly Hills, 90210,"
at one point asked threateningly if
Vradenburg was insulting his
show.
Maslin later took heavy criti
cism from Carole Simpson, senior
correspondent and anchor of World

News Sunday for ABC News, for
not including enough Hispanics in
the show and for portraying
African-Americans in a stereotypi
cal manner.
Winnie Holzman, creator of
ABC's "My So-Called Life," said,
"If we have violence on television,
it is a reflection on the violence
we're having in society. It's not TV,
it's the fact that TV is reflecting
some things that have been
ingrained."
Cox said two responsibilities
television must bear in the future
are to "de-glamorize violence" and
to "inform viewers about the
nature of a show."
In his keynote address, Frank
said the media's main problem is
sending mixed messages to chil
dren. Although admitting that the
television industry was not solely
at fault, he said that "it is possible

to entertain educationally and to
educate entertainingly."
Frank proposed a system man
dating a certain number of weekly
rating points for educational televi
sion to replace the current system
of a mandatory number of hours of
air time. This system could ensure
that "the same number of children
would be reached."
He said this would provide an
incentive to networks to produce
higher-quality shows, thereby
decreasing the number of hours
of required educational televi
sion.
Frank admitted that this system
would "risk bringing a bureaucrat
ic mindset. A Pandora's box could
be opened if the government has to
enforce it."
He rhetorically posed a brain
teaser similar to the proverbial tree
falling in an deserted forest: "If a

government-mandated educational
show is broadcast and no one
watches it, does it really air?" he
asked.
Vradenburg disagreed with
Frank's plan. "It sounds as if it
were suggestive of government
intervention," he said. "I would
oppose it."
Harbert said the plan is "very
interesting," but added that it
would not affect ABC because "we
already fulfill the Irating points]
requirement."
President Bill Clinton, in a video
address to the conference, exhorted
the media to be concerned with its
effect on society. "| Hillary and I] do
ask you, and we should ask you, to
exercise responsibility and good
judgment," Clinton said.

Donald Kennedy served as co-chair

shows for always waiting until the
last few minutes to preach a mes
sage and for creating a dichotomy
between a show's plot and its
moral.
Harbert agreed by adding, "We

just have to do a better job of not
being so obvious."
Other panel topics included role
and responsibility, and gender and
ethnic roles in the media.
Throughout the discussions,
panelists praised some produc
tions, such as the basketball docu
mentary "Hoop Dreams." Most
time, however, was spent criticiz
ing the amount of violence in
shows.
Producers in the audience oflen
found themselves vigorously
defending their shows against the
allegations made by panel mem
bers. Charles Maslin, executive
producer of "Beverly Hills, 90210,"
at one point asked threateningly if
Vradenburg was insulting his
show.
Maslin later took heavy criti
cism from Carole Simpson, senior
correspondent and anchor of World

News Sunday for ABC News, for
not including enough Hispanics in
the show and for portraying
African-Americans in a stereotypi
cal manner.
Winnie Holzman, creator of
ABC's "My So-Called Life," said,
"If we have violence on television,
it is a reflection on the violence
we're having in society. It's not TV,
it's the fact that TV is reflecting
some things that have been
ingrained."
Cox said two responsibilities
television must bear in the future
are to "de-glamorize violence" and
to "inform viewers about the
nature of a show."
In his keynote address, Frank
said the media's main problem is
sending mixed messages to chil
dren. Although admitting that the
television industry was not solely
at fault, he said that "it is possible

to entertain educationally and to
educate entertainingly."
Frank proposed a system man
dating a certain number of weekly
rating points for educational televi
sion to replace the current system
of a mandatory number of hours of
air time. This system could ensure
that "the same number of children
would be reached."
He said this would provide an
incentive to networks to produce
higher-quality shows, thereby
decreasing the number of hours
of required educational televi
sion.
Frank admitted that this system
would "risk bringing a bureaucrat
ic mindset. A Pandora's box could
be opened if the government has to
enforce it."
He rhetorically posed a brain
teaser similar to the proverbial tree
falling in an deserted forest: "If a

government-mandated educational
show is broadcast and no one
watches it, does it really air?" he
asked.
Vradenburg disagreed with
Frank's plan. "It sounds as if it
were suggestive of government
intervention," he said. "I would
oppose it."
Harbert said the plan is "very
interesting," but added that it
would not affect ABC because "we
already fulfill the Irating points]
requirement."
President Bill Clinton, in a video
address to the conference, exhorted
the media to be concerned with its
effect on society. "| Hillary and I] do
ask you, and we should ask you, to
exercise responsibility and good
judgment," Clinton said.
Former University President
Donald Kennedy served as co-chair
of the conference.
