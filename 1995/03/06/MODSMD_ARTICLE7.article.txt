## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Tom Brokaw, managing editor and anchor of NBC
Nightly News, visited Stanford briefly Friday to con
duct a panel discussion on the role of the media in
shaping children's values.
Brokaw's role turned from neutral moderator to
slightly biased mediator in a verbal exchange over the
value of "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers."
The discussion was part of a conference sponsored
by the children's advocacy group Children Now. The
panel included pollster Paul Maslin, Stanford Com
munication Dept. Chair Donald Roberts, YMCA Asst.
Director Ron Kinnamon and Director of the Center
for Media Literacy Elizabeth Thoman.
"We can't pretend we don't have an enormous im
pact," Brokaw said before the discussion began. "We
do play an enormously important role in shaping the
lives of children."
Brokaw emphasized the need for more discussion
on the effects of media on all of society — not just on
children. Based on his experiences as a parent and a
member of the media, Brokaw's rhetoric often drew
laughter from an audience of about 100 at the Chil
dren's Hospital.
The discussion focused on what the media is teach
ing children compared with what it should be doing.
"The dominant message for the last 20 years is
that 'no' does not mean no," Roberts said. "I think the
media promulgates that lesson hour after hour."
"The media needs to emphasize tolerance and per
sonal accountability," Brokaw added.
The role of the parent was also heavily discussed,
with most panelists agreeing that parents need to
play a larger role in what their children watch and
what they watch in their children's presence.
Though he admitted that "teenagers have the
power to shut the door and watch what they want to
watch," Maslin said, "Parents have to talk the talk
and walk the walk. At some point, it's out of our con
trol."
"The fastest way (for parents) to connect to their
child is to buy them a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger

if they can find the damn thing,"
Brokaw said, drawing laughter
from the crowd — with the excep
tion of Fox Executive Vice Presi
dent George Vradenburg and the
three producers of "Mighty Mor
phin Power Rangers."
A debate ensued over the values
the show teaches children — the
first of three debates over the show
to occur during the program's dis
cussions that day.
Vradenburg — whose company
bought the show from Saban Pro

ductions — said there is a lot of ten
sion between capitalism and values.
But he argued that "Mighty
Morphin Power Rangers" teaches
children "the values Americans
want" such as teamwork and toler
ance.
Roberts said good intentions to
instill values in children are not
important. Rather the key is what
children actually learn when the
show ends, he said.
Children are "walking away
with a way to solve problems by
beating the hell out of someone,"
Roberts added.
"One of the concerns (with the
show) is that there is an extraordi
nary amount of violence," Brokaw

said.
"We try to be responsible," said
Ellen Levy-Sarnoff, co-producer of
"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers."
"It is a good example of a show
which entertains and provides val
ues. We're pretty proud of the
show," she said.
"One of the things [children 1
like is that they get messages, posi
tive messages," she said following
the discussion.
Carole Simpson, senior corre
spondent and anchor of World
News Sunday for ABC News,
asked, "What is the deal with the
black man in the black suit, the
Asian in the yellow suit and the girl
in the pink suit?"

Ijevy-SarnofT responded: "A lot
of our bad guys were Oriental. We
felt there needed to be balance. It is
just a coincidence that she
appeared in a yellow suit."
Simpson later said she did not
accept Levy-SarnofFs explanation
and accused the show of "blatant
stereotyping."
Brokaw concluded the discus
sion with a reality check.
"The challenges for all of you are
ever greater and no less," he said.
"The business interests that have
always been paramount in commu
nication will be ever more so. Tele
vision, in whatever form, is a mar
ket. It will be more of a market [10
years from now]."
