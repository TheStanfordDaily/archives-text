### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Tom Brokaw, managing editor and anchor of NBC
Nightly News, visited Stanford briefly Friday to con
duct a panel discussion on the role of the media in
shaping children's values.
Brokaw's role turned from neutral moderator to
slightly biased mediator in a verbal exchange over the
value of "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers."
The discussion was part of a conference sponsored
by the children's advocacy group Children Now. The
panel included pollster Paul Maslin, Stanford Com
munication Dept. Chair Donald Roberts, YMCA Asst.
Director Ron Kinnamon and Director of the Center
for Media Literacy Elizabeth Thoman.
"We can't pretend we don't have an enormous im
pact," Brokaw said before the discussion began. "We
do play an enormously important role in shaping the
lives of children."
Brokaw emphasized the need for more discussion
on the effects of media on all of society — not just on
children. Based on his experiences as a parent and a
member of the media, Brokaw's rhetoric often drew
laughter from an audience of about 100 at the Chil
dren's Hospital.
The discussion focused on what the media is teach
ing children compared with what it should be doing.
"The dominant message for the last 20 years is
that 'no' does not mean no," Roberts said. "I think the
media promulgates that lesson hour after hour."
"The media needs to emphasize tolerance and per
sonal accountability," Brokaw added.
The role of the parent was also heavily discussed,
with most panelists agreeing that parents need to
play a larger role in what their children watch and
what they watch in their children's presence.
Though he admitted that "teenagers have the
power to shut the door and watch what they want to
watch," Maslin said, "Parents have to talk the talk
and walk the walk. At some point, it's out of our con
trol."
"The fastest way (for parents) to connect to their
child is to buy them a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger
