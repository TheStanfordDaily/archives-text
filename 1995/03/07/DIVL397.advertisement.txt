For last relief from the nagging ache of taxes, we
recommend TIAA-CREF SRAs. SRA s are tax
deferred annuities designed to help build additional
assets—money that can help make the difference
between living and living h*// after your working years
are over.
Contributions to your SRAs are deducted Irom
your salary on a pre-tax basis. That lowers your
current taxable income, so you start saving on taxes
right away. What's more, any earnings on your SRAs
arc also tax-deferred until you receive them as income.
I hat can make a big difference in how painful your tax
bill is every year.
Ensuring the future
As the nation s largest retirement system, we oiler
a wide range ol allocation choices — from TIAA's
traditional .innuity, with its guarantees ol principal
and interest, to the seven diversified investment
accounts ol C REI - s variable annuity. What's more,
our expenses are very low, 0 which means more of
your money goes toward improving your future
financial health.
I o find out more, call our planning specialists at
1 800 842-2888. We II send you a complete SRA
information kit, plus a free slide-calculator that shows
you how much SRAs can lower your taxes.
