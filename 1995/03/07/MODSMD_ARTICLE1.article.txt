# Cutbacks at Hoover
## 13 fellowships will be axed 
### Ben Decker Contributing writer 
Next year, the Hoover Institu
tion will have 13 fewer fellows.
As part of a continuing budget
freeze, Hoover will cut six senior fel
lows and seven senior research fel
lows. The institution will also use
the reduction to implement a corre
sponding decrease in secretarial
and other support personnel, ac
cording to John Raisian, the insti
tution's director. The combined
savings should total $1.8 million
annually.
The six senior fellows have ac
cepted retirement plans offered by
the University under the Faculty
Incentive Retirement Plan, put into
effect in 1994. The plan will give
some fellows as much as $350,000
in the next two years, including a
$100,000 stipend to continue their
research, according to Hoover offi
cials.
"We've been doing some belt
tightening and budget reduction
over the last five years," Raisian
said. "We wanted to accomplish it

quickly instead of gradually."
The seven senior research fel
lows will also have their appoint
ments terminated or not renewed.
Senior fellows usually retain their
positions for life, while research fel
lows are appointed for three to five
years.
In addition, two or three senior
research fellows have been told they
will have to raise some of their own
funds or their future at Hoover may
be in question, Raisian said.
"Every fellow has clerical and
secretarial support that will be cut
as well," he said, adding that he did
not have specific numbers regard
ing possible future layoffs.
The cuts are part of a continu
ing program initiated by Raisian,
which seeks to curb Hoover
spending. "When I took over in
1990 I inherited a $3.5 million
structural deficit, so I froze ex
penditures at $17 million and
tried to raise more funds â€” but
we weren't able to raise enough,"
he said.
