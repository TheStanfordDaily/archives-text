# Cutbacks at Hoover
## 13 fellowships will be axed 
### Ben Decker Contributing writer 
Next year, the Hoover Institu
tion will have 13 fewer fellows.
As part of a continuing budget
freeze, Hoover will cut six senior fel
lows and seven senior research fel
lows. The institution will also use
the reduction to implement a corre
sponding decrease in secretarial
and other support personnel, ac
cording to John Raisian, the insti
tution's director. The combined
savings should total $1.8 million
annually.
The six senior fellows have ac
cepted retirement plans offered by
the University under the Faculty
Incentive Retirement Plan, put into
effect in 1994. The plan will give
some fellows as much as $350,000
in the next two years, including a
$100,000 stipend to continue their
research, according to Hoover offi
cials.
"We've been doing some belt
tightening and budget reduction
over the last five years," Raisian
said. "We wanted to accomplish it

quickly instead of gradually."
The seven senior research fel
lows will also have their appoint
ments terminated or not renewed.
Senior fellows usually retain their
positions for life, while research fel
lows are appointed for three to five
years.
In addition, two or three senior
research fellows have been told they
will have to raise some of their own
funds or their future at Hoover may
be in question, Raisian said.
"Every fellow has clerical and
secretarial support that will be cut
as well," he said, adding that he did
not have specific numbers regard
ing possible future layoffs.
The cuts are part of a continu
ing program initiated by Raisian,
which seeks to curb Hoover
spending. "When I took over in
1990 I inherited a $3.5 million
structural deficit, so I froze ex
penditures at $17 million and
tried to raise more funds — but
we weren't able to raise enough,"
he said.
Raisian blames most of Hoover's


Raisian
troubles on the deficit, which he
inherited from his predecessor, W.
Glenn Campbell. According to
Raisian, the institution withdrew
from its endowment "over and
above the withdraw rate prescribed
by the University" during Camp
bell's reign.
Campbell denies any responsi

bility for Hoover's current fiscal
problems. Raisian is "just fudging
figures," said Campbell. "I'm tired
of him blaming this on me. I built
this damn place from an endow
ment of $2 million to $130 million."
Campbell claims that one-third
of Hoover's projected gifts is wast
ed on bureaucracy.
"I'm not saying this because I
don't like my successor, I'm saying
this because I like the Hoover Insti
tution," Campbell said. "I spent 30
years building the place and I don't

want to see it torn down."
Stanford policy requires that
Hoover withdraw a maximum of
5.25 percent from its $140 million
endowment.
However, because much of the
money is in special funds over
which institution officials have
power, Hoover has exceeded that
level in the past.
"When I took over we were with
drawing 7.8 percent. It's been whit
tled down to 6.5 percent over the
last five years," said Raisian. "Next

year we will be at 5.25 percent."
Raisian asserts that he has not
only cut costs, but also increased
fund raising. Over the last five
years, Hoover has raised $34.3 mil
lion. During the five previous
years, when Campbell was direc
tor, the total was only $26 million,
Raisian said.
This year will be the last for
cuts, Raisian said. "This should do
it for us," he said. "Now that we
are down to 5.25 percent, with
fund raising going up, we should be

able to resume modest growth by
next year."
Some senior fellows said they
were happy with their retirement
packages.
"Never before has anyone
offered people over 65 at this Uni
versity this much," said economist
Rita Ricardo-Campbell, one of the
retiring fellows and Campbell's
wife. "I'd already thought of retir
ing; this plan was the final push."
According to Raisian, other
retiring senior fellows include

economist Henry Rowen, sociolo
gist Alex Inkeles, political scientist
Peter Duignan, European histori
an Lewis Gann and arms control
expert Richard Starr.
"It's good from everybody's
standpoint," Rowen said. "It's a
win-win thing. It gives us a good
deal, and it gives the institution an
opportunity to get some younger
people."
Retiring senior fellows will con
tinue to use their offices, and are
encouraged to finish their research.
