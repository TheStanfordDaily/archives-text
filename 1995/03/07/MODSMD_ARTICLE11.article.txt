Prosecutor arrested
MEXICO CITY (AP) — Bruising its
already tarnished image, the govern
ment yesterday accused a former pros
ecutor of covering up his own brother's
assassination and said he should be
brought home from the United States
for trial.
The Attorney General's Office said a
Mexican judge late Sunday ordered the
arrest of Mario Ruiz Massieu, a former
deputy attorney general who was
arrested in New Jersey last week. Such
a move is a necessary step for extradi
tion in Mexico.
A statement said he was suspected
of altering depositions to protect Raul
Salinas, the brother of former Presi
dent Carlos Salinas de Gortari, in his

investigation into the Sept. 28 murder
of his older brother, Jose Francisco
Ruiz Massieu, the No. 2 leader of Mex
ico's governing party.
Ruiz Massieu was arraigned before a
federal judge in Newark, N.J., yester
day on a charge of failing to declare
more than $43,000 in cash when he
entered the United States last Friday.
In Mexico City, Attorney General
Antonio Lozano Gracia confirmed
Mexico would seek extradition.
Ruiz Massieu's attorney denounced
the Mexican charges.
"To suggest that Mario Ruiz
Massieu would cover up the assassina
tion of his own brother is illogical and
stupid," Michael L. Santangelo said
after the brief court hearing in
Newark.
