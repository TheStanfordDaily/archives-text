# Poor states ask for UN aid

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — An
international poverty conference opened yes
terday with poor nations pressing for more
aid and the U.N. chief warning that the
meeting could run aground on indifference.
"The problem of the United Nations is to
cope with ... donor fatigue, conference
fatigue," said U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
"Fatigue will provide something more
dangerous, which is indifference," he said.
"Our goal is to show ... we are all of the
same community. We must help each
other."
In an emerging standoff bet ween wealthy
and poor countries, delegates at the 183-
nation meeting argued behind closed doors
over setting up a fund to help eradicate
poverty.
A proposal for "new and additional" aid
to poor nations is among the most con
tentious — and U.S. delegates said privately
they would not accept it. But a caucus of

more than 130 developing countries indicat
ed that it would fight for the aid.
"We enjoin creditor nations and multina
tional financial institutions to take more
meaningful steps toward debt reduction,"
said the caucus leader, Cielito F. Habito of
the Philippines.
The stalemate did not bode well for any
agreement on action in the summit's final
document, to be signed March 12 by nearly
120 leaders.
The United Nations said success at the
poverty summit should be measured in the
convergence of ideas, rather than hard com
mitments, as it tried to justify the assem
bly's $28 million cost.
But the summit was tinged with an air of
futility, compounded by the absence of key
leaders, notably President Clinton.
"The world will not have changed much
by (next) Monday," admitted Germany's
minister for labor and social affairs, Norbert
Bluem.
