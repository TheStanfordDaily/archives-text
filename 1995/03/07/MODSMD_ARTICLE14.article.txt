## Constitutional rules 
### 
The ASSU should form
committee to interpret
Constitution's meaning

Arbitrary power is near
ly always a bad thing. In the
wrong hands, it is even worse.
The so-called "sweatshirt rule"
— which constitutionally requires
ASSU Senators to wear a sweat
shirt uniform on the days they meet
— may be ridiculous, but it is law as
far as the ASSU is concerned.
While the ASSU Constitution
does give the representative body
the power to govern its own elec
tions and interpret its own constitu
tion, nobody should have the power
to alter the basic intent of its con
stituents.
At last week's senate meeting,

senate unair iNawwar i\as
rawi made the decision to
suspend the Constitution
and not to require senators
to heed the sweatshirt rule.
This decision comes sever
al meetings after Kasrawi
invoked the very same rule to
ensure the senate's passage

of CA-1, the Balanced Funding Deal
and related measures which spent
thousands of dollars of ASSU
money to hold a special election.
At that meeting, Kasrawi used
the sweatshirt rule to strip two sen
ators of the right to vote — an act
which caused little consternation
outside of the senate.
Now that the rule's enforcement
has been suspended, students
should question the legitimacy of a
process which allows the senate
chair to enforce or overrule a mea
sure ratified by more than two
thirds of the student body depend
ing upon what he sees as his politi
cal interest.
Kasrawi may attempt to mask
his actions by declaring that he is
merely exercising the senate's
power to interpret the ASSU Con
stitution, but such an argument
leads to ridiculous conclusions.
After all, can the Supreme Court

of the United States rule that the
framers of the U.S. Constitution
actually wanted two presidents
instead of one? Some parts of any
constitution must be so clear-cut
that interpreting them to mean
something other than what was
intended is a farce.
For this reason, the issue extends
beyond the sweatshirt rule. Kas
rawi has set a bad precedent for the
organization as a whole. Who is to
stop the senate chairs of the future
from overruling the student special
fee election?
To eliminate this possibility, the
ASSU should form a body of stu
dents to rule on the constitution
ality of actions taken by the sen
ate, the Council of Presidents, the
senate chair and other ASSU offi
cers.
A constitutional council could
consist of non-partisan students

elected in the spring election,
and it could consult with pro
fessors in the Law School on
more involved issues.
All bodies in the ASSU
would be bound by the deci
sions of the council, and only
the students — not the sen
ate — would have the power

to recall its members.
Such a group has been proposed
before, and the idea has always been
attacked as a needless addition to
the ASSU's bureaucracy — not to
mention the difficulties likely to
arise in finding students to serve on
such a council.
Unfortunately, Kasrawi's actions
signal an alarming trend toward
control over student resources by a
very small group of people. Such
centralization runs counter to the
spirit of the ASSU Constitution,
which refers all important issues —
such as amendments and special
fees — to the student body for ref
erenda.
The senate should put an amend
ment to create such a constitutional
council on this spring's general elec
tion ballot. The students will then
be able to vote on whether they feel
the ASSU has become too central
ized.
