## Workers deserve our respect 
### 
HERE'S A PIECE of a conversation
that I had when a friend of mine
who lives in a self-op came over to
my co-op for dinner:
Friend: You know, every time I come
over here, I realize how great it is to live
in a self-op.
Me: Uh, yeah, why's that?
Friend: Look at this place. It's filthy.
Newspapers everywhere and people's
dirty dishes all over the kitchen. People
are so much cleaner in my house.
Me: The people in your house make
the nastiest messes ever. I've seen them
stacking up their dirty dishes in the water
fountain before. You honestly think
that's cleaner than this?
Friend: Well, we have kitchen people
to clean up our stuff. It's worth it to not
have our house look like this.
Me: Kitchen people?
Friend: Yeah, the cook and the people
who work in the kitchen full-time, and
the people who clean our house for us.
On the surface, this seems like a pretty
normal conversation. So, there are people
who work in the kitchens on campus.
That's pretty standard for any university.
What's slightly disturbing is the way that
Stanford students tend to forget that
hundreds of people are hired by the Uni
versity to prepare our food, wash our
dishes, clean our bathrooms, maintain
University buildings and landscape the

campus. What we are forgetting is not
only that other people are working so that
we can be treated like five-year-olds, but
that these people are human.
The majority of students on this cam
pus have worked in similar jobs at one
time or another. I remember times during
my summers as a cashier, receptionist
and salesperson that I started acting like
an robot simply because customers tend
ed to treat me that way. Like a nonentity,
a being put in a store just to hand back
the correct change or make sure that the
receipt was in the bag.
During those summers, I also remem
ber thinking how glad I was that I only
had to suffer through those jobs for 10 or
12 weeks. I wondered how people could
hold such jobs for 20 years, as some of my
co-workers had. I wonder the same thing
about the people who work at this univer
sity.
Perhaps it's even more difficult to
work here at Stanford, seeing so many
students with such overwhelming eco
nomic privilege who clearly take so much
for granted. Not only are we privileged,
but we are also younger than most of the
people who work here and we are often
insolent. I can't even count the times that
I have seen someone make an utterly dis
gusting mess of their plates and trays in a
dorm dining hall or spill trash on the
bathroom floor without giving a second
thought to the fact that someone has to
clean up after him or her.

Granted, the facilities and food service
personnel that the University hires are
paid to perform these duties. I'm not say
ing that we should do their jobs for them
or that all of us should live in co-ops or
off-campus. All that I am advocating is a
touch of humanity in our treatment of
these people with whom we share our
campus.
This awareness and humanity could
come in many forms. There are groups
that argue with the University on behalf
of workers' rights, benefits and privileges.
Or perhaps you could check out one of the
groups that organizes tutoring in English
language and literacy for interested work
ers.
If these options seem like too much of
a commitment, then try starting with
yourself. We are all being pampered here.
Unlike in our own homes, most of us
don't have to wash a plate, mow a lawn or
clean a bathroom. So wave hello, start a
conversation and treat people as equals.
It's not that hard â€” we learned all of this
when we were about three years old.
Respect the fact that we are being treated
with privilege, and treat the people who
take care of us with dignity and respect.
They are, just like us, only human.

Thanks to Ruby, Oscar, Tanja and Ma-tc
