Muslim network tried to dispel misconceptions about Islam

MOST AMERICANS, even on
such an illustrious campus as
this, harbor false stereotypes
about Muslims and Islam. What is
known about Islam usually results
from misinformation and educational
inadequacies and is further colored by
the biases of the American media.
Muslims in this country can only hope
for a "least-biased" report when they
are portrayed by the media, instead of
one that is accurate and fair.
Ronen Brafman presents a classic
example of the misconception preva
lent in American society. On Feb. 28,
Brafman criticized the Muslim Stu
dent Awareness Network (MSAN) as a
"terrorist" organization. Why does he
say this? Is it because we criticize the
Israeli goverenment? What have we

done to warrant this epithet? On
March 2, Mr. Brafman reinforced his
original message, classifying our orga
nization as "hateful" and "biased."
It is to counter misconceptions such
as these that we created the Muslim
Student Awareness Network earlier
this year. We are working to dispel the
misconceptions about Islam and Mus
lims and provide a more accurate
description of Islam than the media
portrayal suggests. The half-page ad
that we placed in The Daily on Feb. 27
was meant to do exactly this — make
people aware of the terrible injustices
against Muslims perpetrated by the
Israeli government. In placing this ad,
our goal was to inform the public with
facts that are rarely publicized by the
American media.

The fact is that injustice against
Muslims will not and cannot go away
without making people aware of the
fact that it is occurring — peace does
not involve silence in the face of bru
tality. Instead, justice requires that
all sides of an issue are presented
before making a judgement; because
the American media presents Muslims
as terrorists, the MSAN feels that it
is necessary to present the other side
of the issue.
In particular, most Americans do
not realize the tremedous and heinous
crimes the Israeli government has
committed and is still committing as
we speak. Over the course of the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict, approxi
mately 10 times more Palestinians
have died than Israelis. Ten times. In

printing the advertisement, we pre
sent the other side to the Stanford
community, in the hope that it will
think before it automatically vilifies
Muslims.
We are united but not by hate.
What unites us is the fact that all
over the world, Muslims are being
treated unfairly and with prejudice.
The elimination of this injustice
through education and awareness is
our goal.
