# Letter supporting the 'Contract With America' ignored crucial issues
## 
### 
At the end of reading his March 1 let
ter supporting the "Contract With
America,"it was hardly a surprise to dis
cover that the author, James W. Reiner,
is a Ph.D. candidate in physics and an
avowed conservative. After urging us to
consider economic and political issues
more carefully, Reiner nevertheless pro
ceeds to serve up a prodigious dish of
rhetoric while completely ignoring an
undeniable truth â€” that the amount of
money spent by programs on the cutting
block amount to a very small percentage
of the overall budget.
If you were to sum up the savings
achieved by cutting programs such as
student aid, the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, Americorps, AIDS
research, bilingual education and Head
Start, the total would be insignificant to
the point of irrelevance compared to the
catastrophic consequences down the

road of eliminating of the significant cul
tural and social resources provided by
these programs.
I assume that even a conservative
trumpeting budget cuts must realize
that the combined costs of welfare and
foreign aid alone comprise only three
percent of the national budget. I would
assume that funding for CPB, student
aid and other mentioned programs have
a similar or lower combined cost.
Whereas defense (18 percent of the
budget), Social Security and Medicare
(32 percent) and interest payments on
the national debt (15 percent) make up
65 percent of the total costs, Republi
cans want to cut infinitesimal programs
such as CPB while proposing an increase
of spending on defense in the National
Security Revitalization Act (in the "Con
tract With America") and propose little
to deal with the fiscal crisis of the Social
Security shortfall in the near future.
Instead, it is clear that Reiner is sim
ply sticking to the conservative party
line, which at the moment requires wip
ing off some powdered sugar yet publi
cizing grandiose efforts to cut down the
size of the budget pie. It seems that

Reiner would like us to believe that
these token efforts will crucially affect
the fiscal crisis facing our national gov
ernment.
I encourage you to educate yourselves
about the budget. Use Lynx or

detailed figures on the nation's 1996 fis
cal budget.
