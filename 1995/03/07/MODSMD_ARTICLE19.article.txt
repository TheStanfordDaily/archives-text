# Kennedy shouldn't have defended speech code
## 
### 
Although Biology Prof. Don Kennedy
resigned as Stanford's president some
time ago, his voice still carries weight as
a senior spokesman for this institution.
Therefore, it is particularly dispiriting to
see him emerge periodically to defend a
blemished legacy.
When the University was finally
charged more than a million dollars for
the indirect cost fiasco, Kennedy felt

"vindicated."
While Kennedy denied the existence
of grade inflation at Stanford in a New
York Times op-ed piece, the Dean of
Education at the School of Medicine was
writing that the grading policy there was
a "national joke" and the Faculty Senate
of the University was re-installing the
"fail" grade.
And now that the courts have
declared the Grey Interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard illegal and
unconstitutional, Kennedy is quoted in
The Daily on March 3 supporting main
tenance of such censorship rules "as a
community standard."
Surely we can all agree that among a
great university's priorities should be
fiscal integrity, fair recognition of excel
lence and unfettered free speech. Poli
cies or practices which frustrate or com
promise these goals are best rectified or
abandoned, not justified. I submit that
Prof. Kennedy would have served his
reputation — and Stanford's — far bet
ter in each instance had he remained
silent.
