### Rachel Kolman Marshak Brian Singer Contributing writers 
The People's Platform party
endorsed a Council of Presidents
slate and 15 senate candidates last
night at a meeting which focused
primarily on ethnic issues despite
the party's new mission statement
to expand its focus.
Out of 16 undergraduates who
applied for recommendation — 10
of them freshmen — 14 received
endorsement. One graduate sena
tor, senior Alane Murdock, sought
and received the endorsement.
"That's the way it usually is,"
said current COP member Vanes
sa Alvarado. "It's a good idea to
have a lot of freshmen, because it's
good consistency."
Freshmen Christy Ramon,
Thomas Leung, Armen Panoss
ian, Wade Pyun, Bill Shell, Brie
Franco, Angela Parker, Lamar
Baker and Jonathan Bobb; sopho
more Kimberly Bayer; and juniors
Esther Chun, Duane Beasley and
twin brothers Joaquin and Julian
Castro all received endorsement

from a voting pool of approximate
ly 50.
The slate "We Deserve Better,"
composed ofjuniors Michael Choo,
Jon Oram, Nicole Vazquez and
Rich Stolz, received recommenda
tion for COP.
After giving two-minute open
ing addresses, prospective sena
tors were quizzed by current Plat
form members about future sen
ate plans and overall ideals.
"I'm very confident that the
people and the views expressed
here are what the people at Stan
ford want," Baker said. "I think all
the people endorsed will make it to
the senate."
Baker emphasized senate im
pact in student-related issues.
"This is my University and this is
your University. I feel that I have
very little control over what hap
pens at this University," he said.
Not receiving endorsement
were freshman Becky Zimmerman
and sophomore Mike Pace.
Zimmerman said she is now un
sure of her campaign plans. "Poli
ticking and government is what I
love to do. The drawback is that
I'm not sure that this is how I
want to do it. The question is how
I want to spend my time and is
this the path I want to take?"
Current People's Platform
members asked virtually all can

didates about their commitment
to University ethnic centers —
historically the focus of People's
Platform — in spite of the party's
new mission statement which
broadens its focus beyond ethnic
issues.
Most of the party's members
are affiliated with campus ethnic
centers.
"People asked specific ques
tions addressing issues important
to them," said Platform member

and ASSU Senate Chair Nawwar
Kasrawi.
However, he said, there are
other significant issues to consid
er besides commitment to ethnic
centers.
The candidates now "will begin
the campaign process as a group
helping each other out as well as
educating the public about what
the People's Platform [will] stand
for next year," said current sena
tor Phil Lin.

No current People's Platform
senators will run for reelection
with the party's endorsement.
"Most senators have a high
degree of burnout," Lin said.
"Across the board, this past year's
senate only returned three
incumbents and one resigned.
There's never been a pattern of
incumbency."
Before the vote, party mem
bers discussed all the candidates
in a closed session.
