The mail man
I think the guy working in the post
office who has the four star haircut
and keeps a silver comb in his back
pocket at all times should be elevated
to a position of higher authority
within the Stanford system â€” per
haps to University President or to
the Board of Trustees.
Bless me
I'd really like to know why there are
no tissues kept in the lobby or wait
ing room of Cowell, considering Cow
ell is filled with a million sniffling,
sick people, including myself.
In need of a tourniquet
Quick, somebody call a medic. Sudha
Setty's and Frank Wu's hearts are
bleeding all over the place.
