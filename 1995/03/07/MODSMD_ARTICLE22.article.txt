## Students should fight proposed cut of loan exemption 
### 
WE ALL KNOW
that an educa
tion is already
incredibly expensive,
especially at a private
institution like Stan
ford. For many of us,
student loans are what
make higher education
affordable or even pos
sible.

Currently, the federal government
pays the interest accrued while students
are enrolled and for the first six months
after they graduate. However, as part of
the federal budget reduction proposed
by the Republicans' "Contract With
America," our Congress is considering
eliminating the in-school student inter
est exemption for undergraduate and
graduate/professional student loans.
Proposals under consideration by House
leaders Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey
would add this additional interest to stu
dents' loan principal, which could
increase total student indebtedness and

monthly payments by up to 50 percent.
Furthermore, eliminating the inter
est exemption has a greater negative
effect on students the longer they stay in
school and as such, most severely affects
students seeking graduate and profes
sional degrees. Effectively, this would
result in the largest increase in the cost
of graduate and professional education
in the nation's history.
For example, a student on financial
aid who receives a four-year undergrad
uate degree and subsequently spends six
years earning a Ph.D. would owe over
$68,000 in the cost of loans and an addi
tional $33,000 if the in-school interest is
charged. This 48 percent increase in
educational debt would leave the stu
dent owing $101,000 at the start of
repayment, increasing monthly pay
ments from $818 to $1,204. As a result
of eliminating the interest exemption,
the extra cost over the life of the loan
would be about $48,000.
If politicians and public opinion claim
to make higher education a priority,

then the dollars should exist to back it
up. Cutting programs like the student
interest loan exemption in favor of tax
cuts and increased military spending
certainly do not reflect a commitment to
education on the part of Congress. Per
haps we as students have taken it for
granted that our elected officials have
our best interests and, oftentimes,
shaky finances in mind when they deter
mine the affordability of education â€”
the same education that has been hailed
as the key to a successful future for our
society.
Rendering our education a popular
slogan and then making funding for that
education more difficult to attain sends
students a message. We aren't organized
and we aren't being heard, but our pock
etbooks and our future incomes are
being manipulated to produce revenue
for a government that claims to pursue
fiscal responsibility. Do students
deserve to absorb the costs of budget cri
sis initiatives? Where were the lobbyists
for student voices when these proposals

were being developed?
The best way for students to effec
tively organize is through student gov
ernment, namely the ASSU Senate and
the Council of Presidents.
If the ASSU should not have the
power to speak for students on these
issues, then how can we ever present a
unified outcry to policies which drasti
cally affect student interests? Perhaps
the ASSU isn't perfect, but for students,
it's the best voice we've got. If you tie
the hands of the senate and the COP,
then who will help us organize collec
tively? Who will speak out on our
behalf? Who will defend student inter
ests?
Limiting the role of the ASSU to
debating whether senators need to wear
sweatshirts in the shower leaves stu
dents feeling that our student govern
ment is irrelevant and ill-equipped to
deal with serious student needs.
