Continuing to raise expecta
tions for the upcoming Pacific 10
Conference season, the Stanford
Softball team (8-8) split a double
header with a tough Loyola Mary
mount team at El Camino Field
on Saturday, taking the first
game 8-4 and dropping the night
cap 6-1.
Stanford continued to show
improvement at the plate, smack
ing 15 hits in the opening game
and seven more in the second
game. Also emerging as a staple of
Stanford softball is solid pitching
by freshman phenom Jessica
Schulman (5-3), who captured the
victory in game one after yielding
just four unearned runs.
Game one was marked by two
large shifts in momentum. Loyola
began the game with an emotion
al boost, scoring three times in
the top of the first; the Lions
couldn't hold on to the lead, how
ever, as the Cardinal came right
back to score four runs in the bot

torn half of the inning.
"It really helped to come back
in the first," Schulman said. "It
totally changed the momentum of
the game. We just felt like there
was no way we would lose after
that."
Stanford kept the pressure on,
scoring three more times in the
third and once in the fifth. Loyola
added a fourth run in the top of
the sixth, but it wasn't enough to
outscore the Cardinal. Brooke
Holliday (1-3) took the loss for the

Lions.
The Stanford hitting parade
began with leadoff hitter Summer
Lee. The sophomore shortstop
from San Mateo went 3-for-4 with
2 RBIs, raising her team-leading
batting average to an amazing
.553. Sophomore left fielder Katie
Beattie also had a big afternoon,
finishing with four hits in four
bats while driving in two runs.
"We just had a solid hitting

performance [in game one],"
assistant coach Andy Pearce said.
"We had twelve hits in the first
three innings, and we did a great
job of coming back in the bottom
of the first. It was a really exciting
game."
Sophomore second baseman
Amanda Renteria continued to
hit well in the ninth spot, going 2-
for-3 in the opener. Freshman
third baseman Dawn Kobata and
junior catcher Lynn Anderson
had two hits apiece for the Cardi
nal.
In addition to her offensive
effort, Anderson was solid behind
the plate, calling a game that drew
high praise from her battery mate.
"Lynn helps me so much
[behind the plate]," Schulman
said. "She calls a great game. She
remembers all the hitters and
what they did their last time up.
She's just really smart back
there."
Stanford got off to a slow start
in game two. The Cardinal didn't
get its first hit until the bottom of

the fourth inning. The Lions, on
the other hand, slowly built a lead,
scoring single runs in each of the
first two innings and erupting for
four more runs in the top of the
fourth.
"We just didn't hit well the first
three innings," Pearce said.
"Their pitcher wasn't that strong,
[but 1 we just couldn't get any
thing going."
Stanford managed seven hits
over the final four innings of play,
but the Cardinal could only score
once, leaving seven runners on
base. In the fourth, Stanford
stranded runners at second and
third after scoring its only run of
the game. In the sixth, Loyola
Marymount turned a back-break
ing double-play to end a threat as
Stanford left two more runners in
scoring position. Finally, in the
bottom of the seventh inning,
Stanford left the bases loaded in
its last chance to climb back in the
game.
Sophomore Angela Webb (2-5)
took the loss for the Cardinal,
while Sheri Bergeron (3-1) record
ed the win for the Lions.
"We had our chances to win,"
Pearce said. "We just left too
many runners on base."
