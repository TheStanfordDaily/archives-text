Continuing to raise expecta
tions for the upcoming Pacific 10
Conference season, the Stanford
Softball team (8-8) split a double
header with a tough Loyola Mary
mount team at El Camino Field
on Saturday, taking the first
game 8-4 and dropping the night
cap 6-1.
Stanford continued to show
improvement at the plate, smack
ing 15 hits in the opening game
and seven more in the second
game. Also emerging as a staple of
Stanford softball is solid pitching
by freshman phenom Jessica
Schulman (5-3), who captured the
victory in game one after yielding
just four unearned runs.
Game one was marked by two
large shifts in momentum. Loyola
began the game with an emotion
al boost, scoring three times in
the top of the first; the Lions
couldn't hold on to the lead, how
ever, as the Cardinal came right
back to score four runs in the bot

torn half of the inning.
"It really helped to come back
in the first," Schulman said. "It
totally changed the momentum of
the game. We just felt like there
was no way we would lose after
that."
Stanford kept the pressure on,
scoring three more times in the
third and once in the fifth. Loyola
added a fourth run in the top of
the sixth, but it wasn't enough to
outscore the Cardinal. Brooke
Holliday (1-3) took the loss for the

Lions.
The Stanford hitting parade
began with leadoff hitter Summer
Lee. The sophomore shortstop
from San Mateo went 3-for-4 with
2 RBIs, raising her team-leading
batting average to an amazing
.553. Sophomore left fielder Katie
Beattie also had a big afternoon,
finishing with four hits in four
bats while driving in two runs.
"We just had a solid hitting
