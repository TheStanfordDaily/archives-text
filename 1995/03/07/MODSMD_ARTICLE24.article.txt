# Top-ranked Navy among Cardinal victims
## Sailing tops Stanford Invite 
### Mike Jensen Contributing writer 
Stanford sailing used the weekend to deliver a
strong message to the rest of the college sailing com
munity. Against the best competition in the nation,
the host Cardinal captured its second consecutive
Stanford Intersectional Team Race championship.
Saturday's poor weather and weak winds forced
the postponement of much of the preliminary
round-robin competition. What the regatta lacked in
action on the first day, however, it more than made

up for on Sunday.
As the wind gathered strength on Sunday, so did
the intensity of the competition. Having to sail more
than 60 team races, the regatta saw sailors hitting
the water early in the morning and not hitting land
until after the sun set. The grueling competitiion
served as the perfect setting for an 1 lth-ranked Car
dinal team wishing to remove doubts of inexperience
and establish its name in team racing.
Stanford started off slowly with a disappointing
early loss to California. However,
Stanford was able to recover in
time to defeat team racing power
houses, such as top-ranked Navy,
No. 4 Old Dominion and No. 6 St.
Mary's (Md.). The Cardinal's suc
cessful performance in round
robin competition earned the
team a birth in the regatta's final
four, its goal going into competi
tion. Joining Stanford in the final
four were the higher-ranked Mid
shipmen, Monarchs and Sea
hawks.
"They are probably at a higher
level, but we were not intimidat
ed," said coach Steve Bourdow,
discussing the schools from the
East Coast.
Senior skipper Charles Meade
led the Cardinal push into the
final round. The elder statesman
on a young team, Meade has con
sistently provided the Cardinal
with exceptional sailing. Fresh
man Betsy Carmichael crewed
with Meade.
"Charles Meade is definitely
our leader, he has the most expe
rience on our team," Bourdow
said. "He is able to pick up more
than his third of the responsibili
ty."
Freshman skipper Danny Zim
baldi overcame a limiting knee

iiyury to team with fellow fresh
man Heather Rogers to maneu
ver Stanford's second boat
throughout the three-boat es.
Stanford's third boat saw split
duty. Junior skipper Adam Lowry
excelled in Saturday's light winds
but was unable to carry his suc
cess over to Sunday's changed
conditions. Bourdow moved
freshman John Meade and sopho
more crew Megan Ireson into the
third spot.
Bourdow's decision paid divi
dends; the younger Meade imme
diately turned it up a notch and
his chemistry with older brother
Charles gave the Cardinal a defi
nite advantage.
"John went in and flew. He
and his brother sail well togeth
er," Bourdow said.
Stanford's success surpassed
expectations, with the team los
ing only three out of a total of 17
races. St. Mary's also equaled the
regatta low of three losses; how
ever, the Cardinal claimed first
place, taking two out of three
against the Seahawks.
The same depth that allowed
the program to put on a great
event, also proved to be the deci
sive edge for the team on the
water. Many of the other schools
possessed two strong boats, but
that simply isn't enough to com
pete against a Cardinal team
capable of putting five different
teams on the water.
