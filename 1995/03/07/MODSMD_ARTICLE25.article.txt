# Hockey skates to unlikely third
## Highest-ever finish for seventh-seeded Stanford 
### Rajen Sheth Contributing writer 
With a strong effort at the
National Club Hockey Tourna
ment in Ft. Collins, Colo., the
Stanford hockey team finished as
the third-ranked team in the
nation, its best finish ever. Going
into the tournament as the sev
enth-seeded team in the eight
team field at Nationals, Stanford
powered into the semifinals
behind a strong team effort and
the scoring of graduate student

Renato Cedolin.
"I'm very pleased with our
effort," said Coach Ernie Ferrari.
"Honestly, I didn't even expect us
to make nationals at the begin
ning of the season. But, this has
been a great group."
Stanford started off the pre
liminary round robin with a very
physical 6-4 win over Illinois, the
second-ranked team in the
nation. While the victory was
impressive, the game was high
lighted by a cheap shot which
sidelined Stanford junior wing

Stefan Teitge, the team's second
leading scorer. The knee injury
forced Teitge to sit out until the
last two games of the tournament
in which he played only at 70 per
cent of his normal capacity
according to Ferrari. "Illinois was
definitely dirty, cheap and foul,"
Ferrari said.
Hurt by the injury, the Cardi
nal lost its second game 8-2
against third-ranked Indiana.
The Hoosiers jumped out to a 3-0
