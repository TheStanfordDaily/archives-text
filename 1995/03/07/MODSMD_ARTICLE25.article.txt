# Hockey skates to unlikely third
## Highest-ever finish for seventh-seeded Stanford 
### Rajen Sheth Contributing writer 
With a strong effort at the
National Club Hockey Tourna
ment in Ft. Collins, Colo., the
Stanford hockey team finished as
the third-ranked team in the
nation, its best finish ever. Going
into the tournament as the sev
enth-seeded team in the eight
team field at Nationals, Stanford
powered into the semifinals
behind a strong team effort and
the scoring of graduate student

Renato Cedolin.
"I'm very pleased with our
effort," said Coach Ernie Ferrari.
"Honestly, I didn't even expect us
to make nationals at the begin
ning of the season. But, this has
been a great group."
Stanford started off the pre
liminary round robin with a very
physical 6-4 win over Illinois, the
second-ranked team in the
nation. While the victory was
impressive, the game was high
lighted by a cheap shot which
sidelined Stanford junior wing

Stefan Teitge, the team's second
leading scorer. The knee injury
forced Teitge to sit out until the
last two games of the tournament
in which he played only at 70 per
cent of his normal capacity
according to Ferrari. "Illinois was
definitely dirty, cheap and foul,"
Ferrari said.
Hurt by the injury, the Cardi
nal lost its second game 8-2
against third-ranked Indiana.
The Hoosiers jumped out to a 3-0
at the end of the first period. After
Stanford countered with a quick
goal to start the second period,
Indiana scored four unanswered
goals to make the score 7-1, and
the game was out of reach midway
through the second period. "Indi
ana is a very good team and we
didn't have all our horses out
there," Ferrari said.
Stanford came back in the final
game of the preliminary round
with a 6-2 victory over Northern
(N.D.) State, the sixth-seeded team
in the tournament. The game was
close throughout the first period,
which ended with Stanford ahead
2-1. But the Cardinal broke the
game open in the second and third
periods. The game was highlighted
by a hat trick from Cedolin, Stan
ford's leading scorer in the tourna
ment, and a strong game in the net
by freshman Sami Jo Small.
After the game, Small flew back
to Stanford to join the Stanford
track and field team; she ended up
throwing her personal best in the
javelin throw giving her the NCAA
top ranking in women's javelin.
With a 2-1 record in the round
robin, Stanford advanced to the
semifinals to play Colorado State,

the defending national champions
and host of the tournament. Stan
ford kept the game close in the first
period, holding Colorado State to a
2-1 lead. However, the Rams
scored two quick goals at the end of
the period to expand their lead to
4-1. "Those goals changed the
shape of the game, and I wish we
had them back," Ferrari said.
Stanford cut the lead to 5-2 but
then ran out of steam as Colorado
State went on to win 7-2, eliminat
ing Stanford from the tournament.
The team finished third in the
tournament behind Colorado State
and Indiana. "We know we played
as well as possible in that game,
and we gave it everything," Ferrari
said. "We were hopeful of a cham
pionship, but Colorado State and
Indiana are definitely better
teams, and they would beat us
eight out of ten times."
Colorado State played Indiana
in the finals, winning 5-3 to retain
the championship. Ferrari feels
that Colorado State was definitely
helped by the home crowd. There
is a possibility that Stanford may
host the next national tourna
ment.
"I'm confident that we have a
fantastic future," Ferrari said. As
it looks ahead, the Cardinal will
aim to build on this stellar season
in an effort to finally attain its
national championship hopes.
