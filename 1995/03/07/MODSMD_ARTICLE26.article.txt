# Blood, guts and glory
## Violence, sports often mix 
### 
During this year's professional foot
ball season, there were an unusually
high number of concussions and
spinal injuries. Just last week, boxer Ger
ald McClellan literally had his brains
scrambled in the ring, suffering life-threat
ening hemorrhaging. This recent rash of
serious head injuries brings up a difficult

question: Should these relatively violent
sporting events be banned?
Since I tend to avoid difficult questions,
I would like to put off answering it for a bit
and examine some controversial athletic
events of the past. While football and box
ing have more than their share of crippling
and life-endangering injuries, they don't
have a thing on some of the sports people
used to enjoy watching.
Lions vs. Christians: No, this a not a
story about Detroit's gridiron warriors and
some now-defunct NFL team. In the first
century A.D., the Romans liked to toss a
few unarmed Christians in with some suf
ficiently provoked lions and sit back to
watch the ensuing carnage. While there are


Seth
Goldstein
a few stories about some mighty
fellow strangling one of the cats
to death, I don't think the out
comes of such contests were ever
really in doubt. (Although if I
were a betting man, I probably
wouldn't give the Christians as
many points as the Chargers got
in the Super Bowl.)
Ollama: The early Aztecs'
most popular game was sort of a
cross between racquetball, soccer
and basketball. On either side of
an I-shaped arena, a stone ring
jutted out at a height of six feet.
The object was for a team's play
ers to pass a hard, rubbery rac
quetball-like object through the
ring using only their hips and
elbows. Once a team accom
plished this, the game was over. It
must have been a rather difficult
task considering that some games
took two or three days.
It isn't a particularly brutal
sport, unless you take into
account what happened to mem
bers of the losing side. After the

match, they were summarily
beheaded. Some historians have
actually reported that the win
ners — not the losers — were put
to death. While I have some diffi
culty believing that any rational
human would play for the honor
of being sacrificed, this could
explain why the games took so
long. Would you try that hard to
score if the reward was the wrong
end of a sword?
Ancient soccer: Some of the
nomadic tribes of China and Mon
golia had their own interesting
version of the World Cup sport.
After routing an enemy tribe in
battle, the victorious warriors
would celebrate by kicking
around one of the decapitated
heads of the opposition. While
this might be fun after the heat of
battle, I'd hate to be the goalie.
The Joust: While jousting
tournaments often bring up
images of medieval pageantry and
chivalry, there's another side.
Some guy dresses up in a rusty
metal suit, climbs up on a horse
and charges across a field towards
his opponent while holding a
metal-tipped wooden pole. If the
blow doesn't manage to break the

guy's sternum or ribs, the fall
from the horse could lead to any
number of injuries. Throw in the
possibility that he could be tram
pled by either of the two horses
and the bad guy is looking a lot
like President Clinton after the
mid-term elections.
Rugby: Name a rugby player.
Now name a rugby player that
hasn't been temporarily crippled
or involved in an incident that
crippled some other player.
Gotcha. Football may be violent
but compared to its ancestor it's
like knitting. C'mon guys — no
pads and no helmets equals no
common sense.
As much as I may malign my
rugby-playing friends, it's impor
tant to remember that it's a vol
untary sport. No one's holding a
gun to their head saying, "Get
into that scrum or die." These
guys know what they're getting
into. They know the risks
involved. And they still want to
play.
In all of the cases above (except
for the Christians), the athlete's
participation is his decision.
While our definition of barbarism

has changed — and we've become
less and less tolerant of violence
in sports, not more — the ath
letes have always made their own
choice.
If the athletes and their oppo
nents are volunteers, then what's
the problem? Are we becoming so
paternalistic that we can't allow
people to make decisions that
only affect themselves?
In conclusion, when football
and boxing become too violent,
we'll know. How? The risks will
begin to outweigh the gains or
our definition of too much vio
lence will change. No one will
want to play anymore and no one
will want to watch anymore.
That's how those other sports fell
by the wayside. No bans were
needed, just time. There may
come a day when we as a society
can no longer tolerate football or
boxing and they'll go the way of
the dodo bird. But it's not today.
So until that day, let them play,
let them fight (and let me enjoy
it).
