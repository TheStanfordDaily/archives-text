### Ben Hur Staff writer 
No record is safe with these gymnasts.
The Stanford women's gymnastics team
finished second at a meet at Brigham Young
on Saturday. The Cardinal scored a 192.225,
just four-tenths of a point behind BYU. Utah
State finished third with 190.4750.
Stanford performed well throughout the
meet, winning the vault, balance beam and
uneven bars en route to the Cardinal's
fourth competition in a row where it has
scored at least 190 points, a mark which
places Stanford among the nation's elite

schools. Squads that typically qualify for
Nationals consistently score between 190
and 195 points.
The highlight of the evening for the Car
dinal team came on the vault. For the second
week in a row and the third time in the last
four meets, Stanford set a new vaulting
record, scoring a 48.775.
Freshman Keri Monahan won the event,
earning a 9.85, the second best individual
score in school history and just .05 points
less than the mark she set last week. Sopho
mores Katie Jennings and Ariel Passanisi
and freshman Christie Jones each
registered a career high 9.725,
while senior co-captain Jen 6 Elzie
racked up a 9.750. Senior Tina
Snowden, vaulting for the first
time all season, landed both of
her vaults.
The Cardinal also took first on
the uneven bars despite counting
a fall. Jennings tied BYU's Kelli
Rose for the highest score, record
ing a 9.800. Freshman Misty
Moore's 9.675 was the best of her
Stanford career, while Jones and
Elzie continued their steady
excellence, registering a 9.700
and 9.750 respectively.
Moore took first on the balance
beam, barely edging Elzie with a
9.800. Passanisi, despite suffer
ing from knee problems that she

has dealt with most of the season,
once again showed her prowess
by recording a 9.650.
"I felt really solid when I was
doing my routine," Moore said.
"The whole team was full of ener
gy and we stayed excited through
out the meet."
However, the Cardinal ran
into trouble on the floor exercise.
Miscues coupled with some
watered-dnwn routines hurt
Stanford and gave an avenue for
BYU to pull out the victory. By
winning the floor by 1.25 points,
the Cougars were able to move
ahead of the Cardinal despite fin
ishing behind it in the other three
events.
Elzie won the all-around for
the second week in a row, record
ing 38.9 points. BYU's Nanette
Walker finished second.
The Cardinal faces BYU again
this Friday in the Chili's Red Hot
Invitational at Maples Pavilion.
