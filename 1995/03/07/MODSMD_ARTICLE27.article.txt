# Women tumblers scare BYU
## Fourth straight 190-plus point performance 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
No record is safe with these gymnasts.
The Stanford women's gymnastics team
finished second at a meet at Brigham Young
on Saturday. The Cardinal scored a 192.225,
just four-tenths of a point behind BYU. Utah
State finished third with 190.4750.
Stanford performed well throughout the
meet, winning the vault, balance beam and
uneven bars en route to the Cardinal's
fourth competition in a row where it has
scored at least 190 points, a mark which
places Stanford among the nation's elite

schools. Squads that typically qualify for
Nationals consistently score between 190
and 195 points.
The highlight of the evening for the Car
dinal team came on the vault. For the second
week in a row and the third time in the last
four meets, Stanford set a new vaulting
record, scoring a 48.775.
Freshman Keri Monahan won the event,
earning a 9.85, the second best individual
score in school history and just .05 points
less than the mark she set last week. Sopho
