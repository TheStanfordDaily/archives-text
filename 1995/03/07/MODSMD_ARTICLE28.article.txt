The 14th-ranked Stanford
baseball team learned a valuable
lesson in yesterday's 6-4 loss to
the California Golden Bears:
When you have a guy on the ropes
early, it's best to knock him out.
Despite looking shaky in the
early-going, California's right
handed starter Keith Evans (2-2)
survived a critical first inning and
went on to shut down the Cardi
nal yesterday afternoon at
Sunken Diamond. Stanford hit
ters rallied for two runs in the
bottom of the first but were
unable to chase Evans and it
came back to hurt them.
The sophomore hurler got
stronger as the afternoon wore
on, earning the first complete
game victory of his college career
as the Golden Bears (8-9 overall,
1-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) split a two
game series with the Cardinal
(12-9, 3-2 in the Six-Pac).

"This was a huge win for us,"
said Evans, who struck out a
career-high nine batters while
walking just two. "Stanford really
dominated us last year and we
needed this win emotionally to
feel a little bit better about our
selves."
Early on, it appeared as if the
Cardinal, 7-0 winners at Berkeley
on Saturday, once again had Cal's
number. The first four Stanford
batters of the game reached base
and the Cardinal seemed poised

to capture its fourth conference
win in five tries.
Stanford benefited from three
hit batsmen and a Pete Gconomos
error to grab a 2-0 lead in the bot
tom of the first. But the Cardinal
could not break the game open as
Evans got junior second baseman
Brian Dallimore to hit into a
bases-loaded double play to
escape the first inning scare.
