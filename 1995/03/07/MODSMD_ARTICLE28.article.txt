The 14th-ranked Stanford
baseball team learned a valuable
lesson in yesterday's 6-4 loss to
the California Golden Bears:
When you have a guy on the ropes
early, it's best to knock him out.
Despite looking shaky in the
early-going, California's right
handed starter Keith Evans (2-2)
survived a critical first inning and
went on to shut down the Cardi
nal yesterday afternoon at
Sunken Diamond. Stanford hit
ters rallied for two runs in the
bottom of the first but were
unable to chase Evans and it
came back to hurt them.
The sophomore hurler got
stronger as the afternoon wore
on, earning the first complete
game victory of his college career
as the Golden Bears (8-9 overall,
1-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) split a two
game series with the Cardinal
(12-9, 3-2 in the Six-Pac).

"This was a huge win for us,"
said Evans, who struck out a
career-high nine batters while
walking just two. "Stanford really
dominated us last year and we
needed this win emotionally to
feel a little bit better about our
selves."
Early on, it appeared as if the
Cardinal, 7-0 winners at Berkeley
on Saturday, once again had Cal's
number. The first four Stanford
batters of the game reached base
and the Cardinal seemed poised

to capture its fourth conference
win in five tries.
Stanford benefited from three
hit batsmen and a Pete Gconomos
error to grab a 2-0 lead in the bot
tom of the first. But the Cardinal
could not break the game open as
Evans got junior second baseman
Brian Dallimore to hit into a
bases-loaded double play to
escape the first inning scare.
"We had a chance to score a lot

of runs in the first and we couldn't
do it," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "That double
play ball was really the turning
point of the game. From that point
on we didn't get much going."
After surviving the first inning,
Evans settled into a groove, setting
down 16 of the next 18 Cardinal
batters he faced. The sophomore
picked up his second win of the
year while allowing just five base
hits and two walks.
"Keith [Evans] has been a real
slow starter for us in the past,"
said California head coach Bob
Milano. "But we always felt that if
he can get out of the first few
innings without giving up a lot of
runs, he's going to really be a pro
ductive force for us."
Early in the game it looked as if
the two first-inning runs might
have been enough for sophomore
Jason Middlebrook, the Stanford
starter. Middlebrook struck out
five Bears' batters over the first
three innings and carried a
shutout into the fifth.
But the hard-throwing sopho
more was once again unable to
pick up his first victory of the sea
son as he surrendered two runs in
the top of the fifth before leaving
the game in the seventh.
After hitting center fielder Gary
Johnson with one out in the fifth,
Middlebrook gave up a double to
Economos to put runners on sec
ond and third. An Ivan Lewis dou

ble down the first baseline cut the
Cardinal lead to 2-1 before Middle
brook was called for a balk to tie
the game.
"Middlebrook pitched pretty
well but the bottom line is that
we're not satisfied unless we win,"
Marquess said. "We haven't given
him much of a cushion and in the
big spots he hasn't been able to
come through."
Cal took the lead in the top of
the seventh before breaking open
the game with back-to-back run
scoring doubles.
Once again, the fireworks start
ed courtesy of a hit batsman when
Middlebrook plunked Johnson to
open the inning. After Economos
sacrificed Johnson to second,
Lewis singled off of junior Mario
Iglesias to put the Bears on top, 3-
2. A Pat O'Hara double down the
right field line and a Jonathan
Petke two-bagger to the wall in
center gave Cal a 6-2 lead.
Stanford would not give in easi
ly, however, cutting the lead to 6-4
in an attempt to capture its fourth
ninth-inning comeback win of the
season. Senior third baseman
Steve Carver came to the plate
with A.J. Hinch aboard, but Evans
struck out Carver on three pitches
to end the game.
"I tried to establish my inside
fastball in the first inning and it
ended up hurting me when I hit
some people," Evans said. "But I
have good endurance and I get
stronger towards the middle and
late innings. I just went out there
and tried to get the other team to
put the ball in play and get outs â€”
[yesterday] it worked."
