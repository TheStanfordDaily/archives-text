# Hungry Wolf Pack bats next
## 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The Big West Conference is
noted for its offense and Neva
da, last year's co-champion, is
no different.
The 17th-ranked Wolf Pack
(14-3), who tied last year with
Cal State-Fulierton and Long
Beach State for the conference
crown, brings two players to
Sunken Diamond today at 2
p.m. with as many home runs as
the entire 14th-ranked Stanford
(12-9) team.
"We have the possibility of

putting a lineup out there that is
capable of putting up some big
numbers," Nevada coach Gary
Powers said before the season.
"We should be able to generate
more power than last year with
a chance to utilize some more
speed."
While five players were draft
ed from last year's team, Neva
da reloaded and the power for
Wolf Pack is not lacking. Neva
da, with designated hitter Chris
Briones and first baseman
Justin Drizos, will challenge the
pitching staff of the Cardinal in
the first meeting between the
two teams. Briones, a senior
transfer from last year's national
champion Oklahoma, and Drizos,
another senior, both have home
red five times in this young sea
son. Briones also sports a .354
batting average and has knocked
in 20 Wolf Pack baserunners.
Drizos leads the team with 21
runs batted in and also has a
team-high 18 walks while his bat
ting average stands at .351. In
addition, Drizos has a slugging
percentage of .702.
The pair are not the only slug
gers for Nevada. The leading hit
ter is junior outfielder Shane
Slayton. He is currently hitting
.426 with three home runs and
18 RBIs after batting .347 last
year with 10 homers and 54
RBIs. Slayton has walked nine
times so far to give him a team
high on-base average of .514. Sec
ond baseman Wade Jackson, a
junior college transfer, won the
starting position and is second on
the team in hitting and slugging
with a .412 batting average and
.676 slugging percentage.
As a whole, the team has a bat

ting average of .301, 28 points
higher than the Cardinal. The
Wolf Pack is also over 100 points
higher than Stanford in slugging
percentage with a .486 average.
Amazingly, the on-base percent
age for Nevada is higher than the
Cardinal's slugging average of
.364. The difference between the
two offenses can be observed in
scores of the games both teams
played against St. Mary's. Stan
ford tallied 11 runs in its two
game set while the Wolf Pack bet
tered that mark in each of its
three games. Nevada scored 15,
21 and 12 runs respectively in
the series.
Freshman Kyle Peterson will
do the honors for Stanford as he
puts his scoreless inning streak
on the line. The last time out,
Peterson threw a shutout against
UCLA; his record stands at 3-0
with a 2.10 ERA. He has pitched
34.1 innings thus far and given
up only 27 hits and six walks
while striking out 23.
Josh Bendik will start for the
Wolf Pack for the first time this
year. Bendik, a lefty transfer
from a junior college, has
appeared in five games this sea
son with a 1-0 record and a 3.38
ERA in eight innings. He has
been plagued by wildness, giving
up seven walks and throwing one
wild pitch.
