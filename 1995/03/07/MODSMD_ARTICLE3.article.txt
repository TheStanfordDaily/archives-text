# Colleges question ethnic studies
## Easterners tend to be wary, but is Stanford's plan the future? 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
As Stanford prepares a new interdisciplinary
program in Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity, some of the University's biggest com
petitors have raised questions about Stanford's
approach to studying different ethnicities.
In particular, Stanford's Ivy League counter
parts said the new program may lack depth and
faculty resources. They also noted that there is
not enough scholarship in the comparative field
to warrant an entire program.
While University of California administra
tors— traditionally at the forefront of racial and
ethnic studies — offered praise for Stanford's

new program, some accused the University of
combining programs to conserve money.
All schools emphasized the need for some sort
of study of different ethnicities. Most UC schools
offer studies of several ethnicities, while many
Ivy League universities offer only African-Amer
ican Studies.
Despite their criticisms, administrators from
other universities often mentioned that Stan
ford's program may in fact be the wave of the fu
ture, both because it conserves money and be
cause outside research is increasingly being con
ducted in these fields.
Although Stanford currently has a program
in African-American Studies, Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences John Shoven proposed the

comparative program — which would combine
Chicano, Asian-American and African-Ameri
can Studies — at the Feb. 23 Faculty Senate
meeting, in part as a response to student de
mand.
Interest, not resources
Among Stanford's closest Ivy League rivals —
Harvard, Princeton and Yale Universities —
opinions on comparative studies are mixed, al
though all three schools boast majors in African-
American studies.
At Princeton, administrators said the
chances for an ethnic studies program are slim.
