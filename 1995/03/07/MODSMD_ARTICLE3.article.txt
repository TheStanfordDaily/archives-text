# Colleges question ethnic studies
## Easterners tend to be wary, but is Stanford's plan the future? 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
As Stanford prepares a new interdisciplinary
program in Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity, some of the University's biggest com
petitors have raised questions about Stanford's
approach to studying different ethnicities.
In particular, Stanford's Ivy League counter
parts said the new program may lack depth and
faculty resources. They also noted that there is
not enough scholarship in the comparative field
to warrant an entire program.
While University of California administra
tors— traditionally at the forefront of racial and
ethnic studies — offered praise for Stanford's

new program, some accused the University of
combining programs to conserve money.
All schools emphasized the need for some sort
of study of different ethnicities. Most UC schools
offer studies of several ethnicities, while many
Ivy League universities offer only African-Amer
ican Studies.
Despite their criticisms, administrators from
other universities often mentioned that Stan
ford's program may in fact be the wave of the fu
ture, both because it conserves money and be
cause outside research is increasingly being con
ducted in these fields.
Although Stanford currently has a program
in African-American Studies, Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences John Shoven proposed the

comparative program — which would combine
Chicano, Asian-American and African-Ameri
can Studies — at the Feb. 23 Faculty Senate
meeting, in part as a response to student de
mand.
Interest, not resources
Among Stanford's closest Ivy League rivals —
Harvard, Princeton and Yale Universities —
opinions on comparative studies are mixed, al
though all three schools boast majors in African-
American studies.
At Princeton, administrators said the
chances for an ethnic studies program are slim.
"There is a great deal of interest,
but in general what Princeton
tends to do is spread its courses
over the curriculum" rather than
focusing on a major, said Eva
Grossman, associate dean of the
university.
Although there is enough stu
dent interest at Princeton for such
an ethnic studies program, Gross
man said "demand is only one line
in the triangle. You've got to have
faculty strength and scholarship as
well."
Grossman said she sees the
amount of scholarship and faculty
strength as too small for Princeton
to consider comparative ethnic
studies a legitimate discipline. But

she added that "the West Coast is
richer in faculty strength."
She said she hopes Stanford's
ethnic studies program doesn't
"become a Chinese menu ... where
students taste a lot of different
thingß."
At Yale, while African-American
Studies receives a lot of attention,
there is "no umbrella program,"
Director of African-American Stud
ies Mel Ely said, students can take
individual ethnic studies courses.
"I think it ought to be possible
to study all different kinds [of eth
nicities]," Ely said. "But I don't see
[Asian-American Studies] going
anywhere except for the creation of
a few courses."
Harvard's plans for the future
are closer to Stanford's. Dean of
Harvard College Fred Jewett said
he shares some similar concerns
over faculty strength and scholar

ship, but there has "been a request
for an ethnic studies program"
which Harvard is investigating.
Even though Harvard's minori
ty populations aren't as high as its
counterparts in California, Jewett
said there are "fairly substantial
populations of Asian-Americans
and Hispanics."
If Harvard were to establish
such a program, it wouldn't be the
only Ivy League school with more
than an African-American Studies
option in the Ivy League. Current
ly, for example, Cornell University
offers an Asian-American Studies
major and a Hispanic Studies con
centration, in addition to African-
American Studies.
The money crunch
Criticisms of Stanford's ethnic
studies program raised by West
Coast schools are focused less on

the legitimacy of the discipline and
more on monetary concerns.
Sucheng Chan, director of
Asian-American Studies at UC-
Santa Barbara, said Stanford's eth
nic studies program may have a
hidden agenda — to save the Uni
versity money.
According to Chan, the "admin
istration cleverly tells you it's the
way of the future," since many
schools are in financial trouble.
Despite the critique, however, she
lauded Stanford for establishing
the ethnic studies program, saying
"it is a very good approach."
In the University of California
system, UC-Santa Barbara and
UCLA both offer Asian-American
and Chicano Studies programs in
addition to African-American Stud
ies programs. UC-San Diego offers
an ethnic studies program that is
solely comparative.

On the undergraduate level,
UC-Berkeley offers majors in
African-American, Asian-Ameri
can, Chicano or Native American
Studies, as well as a comparative
studies program. At UC-Santa
Barbara, Chan said there have
been three programs since the
1970s in Asian-American, Chicano
and African-American Studies.
Michael Omi, coordinator of
UC-Berkeley's Asian-American
Studies program, said that compar
ative ethnic studies is "an emerg
ing field.... Most of the innovative
work is being done in comparative
ethnic studies."
Claims like Princeton's, which
say there isn't enough scholarship
or faculty "are rather weak," Omi
said. "There is an enormous body
of life."
African-American dilemma

Although the Ivy League
schools do not offer comparative
ethnic studies programs, directors
of African-American Studies pro
grams said they would criticize
such a program if it lessened the
influence of their own discipline.
"African-American Studies is
clearly in a separate program,"
Grossman said.
Pointing to the history of the
Yale African-American Studies
program, Ely said that students
"ought to have the option to msyor
in specific studies in addition to
comparative ethnic studies."
If a comparative ethnic studies
program were to be established at
Yale, Ely said he would "be hesi
tant to cede any of [his program's]
autonomy." Yale's African-Ameri
can program is almost a quarter
century old, one of the oldest in the
countiy, Ely said.
