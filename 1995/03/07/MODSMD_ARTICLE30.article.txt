### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
The rains didn't come to Fresno until late after
noon, but then again, things often are a little slower
in the Central Valley. Unfortunately for the Stan
ford track team, the Fresno State Bulldogs were not.
The Cardinal had a strong if not victorious show
ing Saturday in the triangular meet at host Fresno
State with Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo. In dual-meet
scoring, Stanford finished closely behind the Bull
dogs on the men's and women's sides, and both
teams handily defeated the Mustangs in the first
outdoor meet of the season.
"We did what we expected to do," head coach Vin
Lananna said. "There were a lot of tough perfor
mances in many events. It was vtry good for a first
meet."
Veteran and new competitors contributed in a
well-balanced performance by the Cardinal squad.
The throwers started the meet on a high point as
freshman Adam Connolly threw the hammer 196
feet, 5 inches and sophomore Justin Strand 187-8 to
take one-two in the hammer throw. In her first
competition of the year freshman Sami Jo Small
sailed the javelin to a NCAA automatic qualifying
distance of 175-11 to win the event and top her per
sonal best by almost 20 feet.
Junior Monica Hoggatt led a one-two finish for
the Cardinal in the 400 meters as she blazed the
Warmerdam Field track in a personal best 56.07 sec
onds, just ahead of freshman Heather Miller.
"At the start I was a little nervous because the
Fresno State girls were supposed to be really fast,"
Hoggatt said. "But at the end I looked behind me
and saw Heather and I was really glad that we got so
many points for the team."
In the 800 meters freshman Sara Moore took con
trol of her race to win in 2:12.91. But the Cardinal
women were not finished with their winning ways.
Freshman Gwen Williams and sophomore Leila

Burr fought off a determined Bulldog team in the
1500 meters to finish in the top two spots.
The men benefited from the spirited running in
several different events. Junior Branyon Davis con
tinued to impress his coaches by winning a close 200
meters in a fast 21.98.
Sophomore Jimmie Johnson took control of the
400 meters from the start, overcoming the stagger
