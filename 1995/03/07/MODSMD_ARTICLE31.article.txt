Rain fell. Cleats and chests slid through bog.
Cries for blood, slugs, black tide and super flies
echoed amid the mobs. And somewhere, high
above Gotham City, the Riddler planned his next
move.
At this weekend's Stanford Invitational —
the largest West Coast college ultimate tourna
ment this year — the Stanford men battled an
18-team field while the women faced a group of
10 squads. By the finals, these 28 teams from
across the nation boiled down to just four and, as
darkness fell on Sunday, the UC-Santa Barbara
Black Tide and the UC-Santa Cruz Slug Sistahs
were victorious over the Stanford men and
women.
Pool play started with underdog Yale dealing
first-seeded Stanford a wake-up call defeat. The
flat Stanford team battled through the rest of
Saturday unable to put away teams. Drops and
poor throwing decisions made even easy games
taxing. The Scrubs dodged a bullet fired by the
Oregon Ducks, fending off several game points
to win 14-13. A series of narrow victories, save a
20-minute beating of California, preserved the
men's No. 1 seed going into Sunday's quarterfi
nals.
The quarters brought long-time rival UC-
Santa Cruz to the chopping block. In the spirit of
Saturday's barnburners, the Scrubs traded
points with UCSC, then allowed the Slugs to pull
ahead late. Facing double match point, Stanford
dug deep to put together back-to-back scores.
With the first-to-13 game tied at 12-12, the Slugß
had possession of the disc and the pressure was
on Stanford to force the turnover and score.
Co-captain Andrei Straumanis called in the
six hottest layout D players, but surprised every
one by calling rookie Cabral Bonner to fill the
seventh spot. "His blazing green head caught my
attention. I took a closer look and saw fire in his

eyes," Straumanis said. Deep in
Santa Cruz territory, the green
haired rookie went horizontal for
the clutch D of the tournament
and abruptly landed in a smallish
lagoon.
When asked later about his
prophetic selection of the rookie
in such a huge point, Straumanis
said "It's my job to notice when a
player is ready to start a fire that
can't be put out." Stanford took
advantage of the turnover and
punched it in for the winning
score.
The semis featured a less
intense UC-Davis team. Gunning
huck for huck, Stanford main
tained a narrow lead throughout
the match.
In the finals, Stanford showed
its potential with moments of
brilliance, but failed to play a
coherent game from beginning to
end. The white game disc lost its
luster in the waning sunlight and

the game was cut short, affording
the Black Tide a 13-10 victory.

match against the defending
national-champion Slug Sistahs,
resulting in a hard-fought, 17-13
Santa Cruz victory.
