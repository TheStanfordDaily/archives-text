# Fencers control West Region
## 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
In a fitting conclusion to one of
the most successful seasons in
the history of Stanford fencing,
the Cardinal qualified six fencers
to the NCAA Championships
with an impressive showing at
the Western Regional Tourna
ment held this past weekend on
the campus of Long Beach State.
As has been the case all year
long, the men were led by foil
standouts freshman Sean
McClain and senior Geoff Don
aker.
The tourney utilized an odd
round-robin. "It's kind of a funny
format," men's coach Zoran
Tulum said. "They want to cut
down on cheating, so they make
you fence your own school first.
Otherwise, if two of your fencers
meet in a later round, you can
play with the results [to better

match up your fencers with top
opponents]."
As a result, Donaker and
McClain, the top two foilists in
the western region, fenced each
other in the very first bout. Don
aker, in a surprising upset, bested
his national champion teammate.
"It was an amazing bout for
Geoff," Tulum said. "To beat a
[club] national champion is an
excellent accomplishment."
After their epic duel, neither
fencer lost again. Donaker
claimed the championship and
McClain took second.
In men's epee, senior Doug
Vanderbilt took sixth place.
Despite this lower-than expected
finish, Vanderbilt still qualified
for NCAA nationals based on his
performance throughout the year.
The men's sabre team will also
send a representative to nation
als, as junior Ed Jen finished
third over the weekend. Junior

Errol Hunter took sixth and is
the first alternate for the West
ern Region. Hunter can still qual
ify if he is voted in as a wild card
by a panel of coaches from around
the country.
The women were led by their
strong epee squad, as juniors
Stephanie Wien and Morgan
Hoch both qualifed for the
national tournament. Wien took
second, losing just one bout.
Hoch placed fourth, yet she easily
qualified.
In women's foil, senior
Michelle Butler finished in sixth
place, losing a bout that would
have sent her to nationals when
her opponent registered a touch
with three seconds left to go. But
ler is the first alternate and is
also eligible for a wild-card berth.
"We qualified six out of a pos
sible 10 spots in the tournament,
by far the most of any West Coast
school," Tulum said.
