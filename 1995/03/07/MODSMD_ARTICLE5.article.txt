### Gabriela Teodorescu Contributing writer 
A Stanford student was battered amid chaos
and confusion Saturday night in Lagunita Din
ing Hall.
The assault — possibly gang related — oc
curred at a crowded party thrown by Sanskriti,
Stanford's Club of the Indian Subcontinent. The
male victim asked not to be named for fear of
reprisals.
"The victim was trying to close a door to pre
vent unauthorized guests from entering," Stan

ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said. Upon
trying to shut the door, he was accosted by be
tween four and eight East Indian males,
Niemeyer said.
"The subjects didn't want him to close the
door, and the victim replied that he had to,"
Niemeyer said. Then, one of the unwanted
guests smashed the window and pushed the door
open, Niemeyer added.
"The victim tried to stop them, so one of the
males struck him several times in the face and
then the males proceeded to gang punch him,"
Niemeyer said.

The wounded student was treated at the
emergency room for a three-inch shallow cut to
the back of the head, a cut on his nose and sever
al bruises on his face, Niemeyer said.
The fight broke out amid the general hubbub
of the party. According to Harith Rajagopalan, a
freshman partygoer, Lagunita was "totally
packed. There was very little room to move
around and it was very hot and humid inside the
room." The capacity of the dining hall is 723, and
police said between 700 and 800 people were at
the party.
Sanskriti Chair Anoop
Prakash, a senior, called the police
at 11:40 p.m. and told them help
would be needed soon to control
the crowd. Groups of 40 to 50 peo
ple arrived and gate-crashed the
party, said senior Gita Sinha, a
Sanskriti member.
The battery occurred after the
police were called. When police
arrived at about 12:05, they were
told by partygoers that at least four
fights had broken out at the party,
said Stanford Police Capt. Marvin
Moore.

A chandelier also fell on an
unknown partygoer's head, Moore
said. "A couple of guys dancing on
top of each others' shoulders pulled
down the chandelier," Prakash
said.
Many people outside still threat
ened to fight after the party was
dispersed. They "had loose gang
affiliation and may have been from
Fremont," Moore said.
"We had eight or nine
deputies there who proceeded to
close down the party at 1 a.m.,
and at about 1:40, members from
[that party] were barred from
entering the Viennese Ball,"
Moore said.
Moore said that the same party
last year also got out of hand.
