## Recent graduate Jain eases into new post

Most students only venture near Cowell
Student Health Center when they get sick.
But Seema Jain, Cowell's half-time stu
dent projects coordinator, is hoping to
change all that. Putting together Stanford's
celebration of National Health and Wellness
Week is just one of the ways she's trying to
increase students "non-sick" role with Cow
ell.
Jain, who has held the coordinator posi
tion since November, said she aims to in
crease participation with campus peer
health education groups and coordinate new
programs for students with questions about
health and wellness issues.
"The primary objective of my job is to ini
tiate ideas and make things go," she said.
Hoping to drum up enthusiasm and in
terest, Jain is coordinating an information
fair to be held Friday in White Plaza in com
memoration of National Health and Well
ness Week.
Elise Lenox, coordinator of Cowell's Alco
hol and Drug Prevention Program, said the
fair is geared to inform students about the
wide range of health services available to

members of the Stanford community.
"We're including a variety of student or
ganizations in getting support for this pro
ject," said Lenox. "Groups from the ethnic
centers to disabled students to Greeks have
filled out surveys and participated in the co
ordination of health-promotion events," she
added.
But Jain's efforts as student projects co
ordinator are not limited to this week's fair.
In addition to increasing communication be
tween health and sex education groups on
campus, Jain has put together new pro
grams.
Jain, a 1994 Stanford graduate, said she
received funds from the University to help
make the existing health resource library at
Cowell more accessible to students by mov
ing it to the first floor. The library is de
signed to assist students with health ques
tions who are confused about where to begin
looking for health information.
Jain said she has located her office next to
the library so students can stop in with their
questions and concerns and she is working
with residential peer health educators to de
velop nutrition programs.

dents," said Jain. "I was a [resident
assistant] last year, and this is like
a continuation of involvement for
me.
"She's breathed new life into
the program," said Carole Pertof
sky, Cowell's director of health
promotion. "Her insight and ere

ative energy in solving problems
and getting student input and
involvement [is invaluable]. We are
very fortunate to have her on
board with us," she said.
Jain said settling into her posi
tion has been a unique experience.
"Being in this newly created
position, there are a lot of gray
areas. I'm still trying to feel out my
responsibilities," she said. "There
are no protocols, so it gives me a lot
of autonomy in what I do."
