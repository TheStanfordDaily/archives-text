## COP, Dining Services form advisory group 
### Martin L. Yeung Contributing writer 
Complaints about dorm food
have been echoed by generations
of Stanford students. But a new
partnership between students
and food service administrators
hopes to change this.
At an ASSU press conference
yesterday, Council of Presidents
member Mork Murdock an
nounced the formation of a new
committee, called the "Working
Group," to conduct in-depth stud
ies on the strengths and problems
with University Dining Services.
"The point of this is to create
new structures for students and
Dining Services to work together
and continually improve the qual
ity of services," Murdock said.
The new advisory committee is
composed of dinning services ad
ministrators and students. It will
include three Dining Services se
nior managers, two COP mem
bers, one resident fellow and four
students selected at large.
