# Fixings for food service
## COP, Dining Services form advisory group 
### Martin L. Yeung Contributing writer 
Complaints about dorm food
have been echoed by generations
of Stanford students. But a new
partnership between students
and food service administrators
hopes to change this.
At an ASSU press conference
yesterday, Council of Presidents
member Mork Murdock an
nounced the formation of a new
committee, called the "Working
Group," to conduct in-depth stud
ies on the strengths and problems
with University Dining Services.
"The point of this is to create
new structures for students and
Dining Services to work together
and continually improve the qual
ity of services," Murdock said.
The new advisory committee is
composed of dinning services ad
ministrators and students. It will
include three Dining Services se
nior managers, two COP mem
bers, one resident fellow and four
students selected at large.
One at-large student will be
selected from each of four cate
gories: athletes, vegetarians, a la
carte customers and board plan
members.
"The Working Group will be a
proactive group dealing with very
current issues," said Assoc. Direc
tor of Housing and Dining Ser
vices Shirley Everett.
Everett cited several topics the
group will consider, from the
removal of Snapple drinks due to
cost considerations to creating a
more consumer-friendly Dining

Services brochure informing stu
dents of the wide variety of
options within the existing sys
tem.
"The complaints we receive
on a regular basis have to do
with issues of quality, the con
sistency of quality in the food
and price," said Craig Mitchell,
food service operations manager
for Manzanita and Ricker dining
halls.
Everett said that preliminary
results from surveys taken at var
ious dining halls provide some
direction for the group.
Most students who responded
to the surveys said that food ser
vice was "good." Also, 58 percent
of students preferred the "all-you

can-eat" meal plan to the declin
ing balance points plan.
"Students' experiences and
tastes differ," Everett said. "We
would like to look at and get input
on what the trends are and which
of the current dining plans and
options work best.
"Our goal is to get the good
rating up to excellent all the
time."
The main hope is that the
meetings will be an opportunity
for both students and managers
to exchange ideas for improve
ment.
Because the advisory group
includes actual administrators, it
is hoped that the suggestions
made in the weekly meetings will

be implemented without bureau
cratic delays.
"|Wel emphasize that this a
partnership between the adminis
tration and students," said Mur
dock. "It's proactive manage
ment."
Both Murdock and Everett
said they hope the new group will
come up with long-term recom
mendations and help with imple
mentation by becoming an on
going group.
"We're hoping that the Work
ing Group will be an ongoing
structure that will continue to
provide input and advice on the
subject of food service quality and
service in the future," Murdock
said.
