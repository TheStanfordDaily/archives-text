The newly formed Canadian Club
provides Canadians at Stanford with
the opportunity to meet fellow
Canadians and share in the distinct
culture and society of Canada.
Join us for our next event: we have
been invited by the Canadian
American Chamber of Commerce
to hear David Suzuki speak on "The
Challenge to Change: Achieving a
Delicate Balance." This will take
place on the 10th of March at 8:00
pm in the Mark Hopkins Hotel in
San Francisco.
Please contact uv at true-north
