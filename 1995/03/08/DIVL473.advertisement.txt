Bet you never thought
you'd hear that. But just
by being a student, you can
get special educational
prices on IBM computers
that will help you through
school, and long after you
get out. IBM offers a
variety of Computer
Solutions
including
entry-level
models,
power-user machines, and lightweight ThinkPads. And with an IBM Right
Start Loan, you can borrow money to buy your IBM and get low interest
rates and flexible terms. So while the price of college keeps going up, at
least the price of succeeding is on its way down.
Come By the Stanford Bookstore Microdisc Department
to see the latest in
IBM
ThinkPads & Personal Computers!
