# Profs debate speech code suspension

### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
Constitutional experts Thomas Grey and Gerald
Gunther became speech code "warriors" yesterday,
arguing with each other over the legality of the recent
superior court decision to strike down Stanford's
speech code.
Grey and Gunther, both professors at the Law
School, were joined by fellow Law Profs. William
Cohen, Kathleen Sullivan and Paul Brest for a panel
discussion at the Law School examining the discrim
inatory harassment provision of Stanford's Funda
mental Standard.
First Amendment rights and the sovereignty of in
dependent institutions were the focus of the debate,

which resembled a first-year consti
tutional law class, thanks to an audi
ence of more than 150 lunch-toting
law students.
In an introductory speech, Sulli
van outlined the two essential argu
ments in the case, which was decided
on Feb. 28. The first part of the case,
she said, was a challenge to the Grey
Interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard.

"The Grey Interpretation was deemed unconstitu
tional because it was not aimed at protecting a group
of people but at prohibitinga class of words," Sullivan
said.
Grey contended, though, that his interpretation
did not prohibit an illegitimate subset of words. "In
the interpretation, harassment is defined in very nar
row terms. We limit it to racial epithets and other dis
criminatory slurs delivered face to face."
The Fundamental Standard had served as a form
of campus common law until Grey more narrowly de
fined "the point where free speech ends and discrim
inatory harassment begins," he said.
The second argument in the case said that under
California's Leonard Law, Stanford was required to
extend First Amendment rights to students.
In Grey's opinion, no one would have objected if
the University had explicitly stated that it prohibited
discriminatory harassment and supported free
speech. But, this was deemed too vague by the Uni
versity since the students were not given specific
guidelines to follow.


Sullivan
With the recent court decision,
the University has essentially
returned to using the Fundamen
tal Standard as its disciplinary
code. Grey, however, believes
that the standard — without his
interpretation — is more an
affront to civil liberties precisely
because it is so vague.
He was quick to support his
interpretation of the Fundamen
tal Standard. "I feel that the pro
vision as drafted is fully in line
with the First Amendment," he
said.
Gunther was just as quick to
condemn the interpretation.
Gunther characterized himself as
a "warrior" in the battle against
protective speech codes. He said
that such codes had a chilling

effect on free speech, which was
restrictive to dialogue and aca
demic questioning.
"The chilling effect is due to
the fact that this is a symbolic
act," Gunther said. "The speech
code has no practical applications
to the University. It was only
enacted to make people feel good
about enacting it."
However, this "feel-good"
approach may not be so wrong,
some said. According to first-year
law student Natasha Minsker,
"All these hate speech codes I
think are good things as symbolic
statements of what is appropriate
and what is not appropriate."
But another audience mem
ber, second-year law student
Veronique Lanthier, said that
speech codes have a minimal
effect on student behavior. "In
the long run, people will be more
influenced by student norms,"
she said.
