# Roble Studio features 'jamming' feet
## Jammix, a new party, provides monthly forum for dedicated dancers 
### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
Fraternity parties are too
crowded to do it. And not much
of it goes on in the dorms. That is
why a new party, Jammix, has
been created specifically for it.
Finally, Stanford students have a
place to go for the sole purpose of

dancing.
Richard Powers, a Stanford
social dance instructor, is the
mastermind behind Jammix. He
said he developed the idea for a
dance party late last quarter
when he noticed a "surge of
interest among students in the
social dance classes to have a
time when they could just

dance.
Since January, Roble Dance
Studio has housed Jammix on
the second Friday of each month
from 8:30 to 11:30 p.m. Admis
sion is free, though a collection
plate is passed during the
evening to pay for the rental of
the studio, which Powers claims
is "one of the best dance floors in
all of Northern California."
Powers acts as the disc jockey
for each Jammix party with his
own collection of music, consist
ing of more than 1,000 CDs. He
said the music variety provides
for "eclectic dancing where any
thing goes."
The music includes "swing,
rock, tango, waltz, salsa, hip-hop,
Latin, jazz, blues, '70s, '80s,
disco, techno, house, reggae, hus
tle, fox trot, oldies, punk, polka,
retro, lounge and country," Pow
ers said. "So far, we have not
missed any of those in an
evening."
The striking stylistic differ
ences in each song played adds to
the excitement, according to
Powers. "We go from Beastie
Boys to Offenbach and the stu
dents love them all," he said.
"There is something for every
one and something to offend
everyone."
Unlike the formality of events
like the Viennese Ball, Jammix is
a very laid-back affair. With no

food, dnnk or decorations, it is
clearly a casual party with danc
ing as its sole purpose.
Some of the biggest support
ers of Jammix have been a group
of Powers' social dance students
known as the Gang of Thirteen.
The Gang of Thirteen was creat
ed last year to set up the annual
Big Dance, a 13-hour dance
marathon held in May.
"Jammix is just a little taste of
what the Big Dance will be like,"
said junior Alex Morgan.
Morgan added that the infor
mal atmosphere of Jammix is a
real benefit. "A lot of people want
to just have a place to dance and
have space. You can wipe your
blues away from the week."
Senior Jean Chao, a member
of the Gang of Thirteen, agreed
that the casual atmosphere is
part of the party's appeal. "The
goal of Jammix is to expose peo
ple to more dancing," she said.
"It is more of a social gathering
than anything else."
The casual scene and music
variety provide the perfect place
for absolutely any style of danc
ing, according to Morgan. From
waltzing to modern dancing, it
all happens at Jammix.
Powers said he is pleased with
this. "We like to encourage cre
ative ways of dancing," he said.
Junior Ryan Knotts, another
Gang of Thirteen member, said

JammLx fulfills an important
need on campus. "It is a really
good outlet for informal dance
that has become really popular
here at Stanford within the past
couple of years," he said, citing
the overwhelming number of
attendees at both the Ragtime
Ball and the Viennese Ball as evi
dence of this new popularity.
So far, Jam mix h cLS received
very favorable response, Knotts
said, noting that "the turnout
has been absolutely wonderful."
Two hundred people attended
the first dance in January and
300 came in February.
In fact, Powers has had stu
dents request that JammLx be
held more often, though no plans
to do so have been discussed yet.
Students afraid of missing
other Friday night events need
not worry, Gang of Thirteen
members said. Since Jammix is
over by 11:30 p.m., people can
continue their dancing elsewhere
afterwards. Morgan said that by
attending Jammix first, students
can "get warmed up by working
up a good sweat and then go to
the frat parties."
Knotts said he encourages
more people to come to Jammix.
"It's a lot of fun and doesn't
conflict with anything else that
happens at Stanford," he said.
"Just come, pick up random peo
ple and dance with them."
