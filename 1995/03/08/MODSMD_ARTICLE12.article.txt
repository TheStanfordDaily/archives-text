WASHINGTON (AP) - A day
after his lesbian sister lobbied Capi
tol Hill on gay rights, House Speak
er Newt Gingrich criticized school
programs that portray homosexu
ality favorably, particularly any
using "active homosexuals" to
counsel teenagers.
Speaking yesterday at his daily
news conference, Gingrich said
some school programs offered to
counter discrimination give homo
sexuals a forum for promoting their
way of life.
"I don't think we want people
out with 'Heather Has Two Mom
mies,' in first grade explaining that
homosexuality is a reasonable alter
native in lifestyle," Gingrich said.
The book he mentioned, by
Leslea Newman, is a story about
lesbian parents. It was second on
the American Library Association's
1994 list of books people tried to
ban.
Gingrich's concern was not lim
ited to the primary grades.
"You have had, clearly, examples
of what is in effect recruitment in
so-called counseling programs,"

Gingrich said. "So I'm very cau
tious about the idea that you want
to have active homosexuals in
junior high school and high school
explaining to young people that
they have all these various wonder
ful options."
A 1 Ferreira, director of the Cam
bridge, Mass., public schools' Pro
ject Ten-East — a counseling and
education program that focuses on
homosexuality — rejected Gin
grich's assertions.
"I would hope that people
wouldn't comment on a topic they
obviously know nothing about,"
Ferreira said. "When you hear
political leaders making such hate
filled comments, that's really
scaiy."
Ferreira said of his program,
"No, it's not Homosexuality 101."
Rather, the program provides coun
seling for gay teens facing animosi
ty in their families or among friends
and includes presentations to class
es "working toward an open and
affirming learning environment for
all children, regardless of their sex
ual orientation."

But Kristi Hamrick of the Fami
ly Research Council, a Washington
based public policy organization,
said Gingrich "speaks with the vast
majority of Americans" on the issue
of homosexuality.
"We have seen some school cur
riculum such as Project Ten put
forward with the goal of giving chil
dren very harmful and false mes
sages about homosexuality and
encouraging them to explore that
lifestyle," Hamrick said. "It's pre
sented in a neutral way in a laundry
list of sexual options."
Gingrich's comments came a
day after he met with his lesbian
half-sister, Candace Gingrich, who
had come to the Capitol to lobby.
The two said they have a strong
relationship but Ms. Gingrich sug
gested her half-brother was ill
informed about gay rights issues.
Gay rights activists, who are
meeting with lawmakers this week
on such issues as AIDS funding and
protection against discrimination,
said Gingrich's comments yester
day reflected a caricature of sex
education, not the reality.
