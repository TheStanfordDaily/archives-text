# Mexican peso hits new low again
## 
### 
MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico's economic crisis
deepened yesterday as the peso sank again and the
central bank was forced for a third straight week to
abandon its auction of government bonds for lack of
demand.
Meanwhile, the Mexican Congress began debating
a $20 billion U.S. bailout package late yesterday in a
special session. Opposition lawmakers objected to
stringent conditions attached by Washington to the
loan guarantees.
The peso closed at 6.795 to the dollar — hitting a
new low for the third straight day. It closed at 6.575
Monday. The peso has lost almost half its value
against the dollar since Dec. 20 — and even more
against other currencies such as the German mark
and Japanese yen.
Analysts said efforts to boost the peso are being
hurt by the weakening U.S. dollar, which has fallen
amid signs that U.S. interest rates might not head

higher in the near future.
"The dollar is under so much pressure that the U.S.
can't keep its promises to boost the peso," said Kevin
Harris, an economist with MCM Currency Watch.
Meanwhile, the Mexican stock market was little
changed, closing up 0.10 percent at 1,524.20.
Investors have said they were increasingly skittish
over delays by the government of President Ernesto
Zedillo in presenting a new wage and price control plan
to confront the economic emergency.
Zedillo had said such a plan would be unveiled as
soon as Congress, dominated by his governing party,
formally approves the $20 billion bailout package
offered by the Clinton administration.
Critics have said the plan will leave Mexico in even
greater debt and also force the country to abide by U.S.
loan conditions that would cede some control of the
economy to the United States — a charge supporters
deny.
