# House sets limits on lawsuits

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans yesterday
muscled through the House passage of a business
backed measure designed to pressure combatants in
lawsuits to settle their differences short of costly tri
als. The bill was strongly opposed by trial lawyers.
The measure, approved 232-193 in a near-party
line vote, was the first of three bills expected to clear
the House this week in a Republican effort to cut
down on what they consider frivolous lawsuits clog
ging the nation's courts.
Supporting the measure were 216 Republicans
and 16 Democrats. Voting against were 181
Democrats and 11 Republicans, a political cleavage
that contrasted sharply with the bipartisan support
for most elements of the "Contract With America"
that had cleared the House earlier.
In a bid to dramatize a need for changes in the
legal system, Rep. Robert Goodlatte, R-Va., said the
Girl Scouts of Washington must sell 87,000 boxes of
cookies each year to pay for liability insurance. "This
is not a problem that deals with corporate America
alone," said Goodlatte.
But Girl Scout officials said the cookie statistic is
unfounded and that damage suits aren't a big prob
lem. The Washington-area council has never been
sued and the national organization takes no position
on the pending legislation.
Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said the Girl
Scouts want no part of the debate. Their message is:
"Please, please, this is not our legislation," she said.
Opponents of the measure, including consumer

advocates, said it would tilt the system too heavily in
favor of corporations, some of which have contribut
ed to a huge lobbying campaign on behalf of the three
bills.
The most hotly contested provision of yesterday's
measure marked a retreat from the "Contract With
America" proposal for the loser in a lawsuit to pay
the legal costs of the winner.
In its place is a provision that encourages the two
sides to settle short of trial. It can require the winner
in a suit to wind up paying a portion of the legal costs
incurred by the loser.
The measure says that in certain types of federal
cases, if one side spurns a settlement offer by the
other — and then loses the case or wins less than the
settlement offer — that side is required to pay a por
tion of the other side's costs, including attorney fees.
"Loser pays" is a concept firmly rooted in English
law, and at the White House, spokesman Mike
McCurry mocked the measure as something that
"comes from a system in which justices wear pow
dered wigs."
While McCurry said President Clinton favors
measures to reduce the number of lawsuits, he con
tended the GOP-backed bill "might disrupt the abili
ty of middle-income [people], the elderly, the indigent
who need that type of justice, that type of remedy."
With one bill cleared, the House turned immedi
ately to a measure that would make it easier for cor
porations and stockbrokers to prevail in defending
against lawsuits charging securities fraud.
