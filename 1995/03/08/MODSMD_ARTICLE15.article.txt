Death penalty reinstated
ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Using the pens of two
slain police officers, Gov. George Pataki brushed
aside 12 years of Mario Cuomo's vetoes and
signed a bill yesterday to make New York the 38th
state with a death penalty.
He did so surrounded by the relatives of mur
der victims, law enforcement officials and politi
cians.
"Our state has traveled a long and arduous
road to arrive at this point in history," the Repub
lican governor said. "That long road is now over.
Justice will now be served."
The state Legislature had approved capital
punishment bills for 18 straight years, only to see
them vetoed by Cuomo and his predecessor, Hugh
Carey, both Democrats.
"It's a shame. It truly is a shame," Cuomo said
yesterday, acknowledging that opposition to the
death penalty may have cost him last year's elec
tion.
The former governor also said he hoped courts
would find the new law unconstitutional.
"It's from fear, anger, shortsightedness and
some cynicism coming together to overwhelm
intelligence," Cuomo said. "It's more than just
sad, it's frightening."
Pataki had campaigned on a promise to restore
the death penalty as one of his first acts.
He signed the bill seven hours after it was
passed by the state assembly early yesterday.
"We are sending out a message across the coun
try," said Republican state Sen. Dale Volker, a for
mer police officer and chief sponsor of the bill.
However, none of the 12 states without capital
punishment appears on the verge of reversing
that stance. In lowa, a death penalty bill was
defeated in the state senate last week.
New York's law will take effect with crimes
committed on or after Sept. 1.
Lethal injection will replace the electric chair
that took the lives of 695 people in New York
between 1890 and 1963.
The law establishes more than 10 crimes pun
ishable by death, mainly intentional murders
committed during violent crimes such as rape,
robbery or kidnapping. Also covered are serial
killings, murders of judges, on-duty police officers
and prison guards, and murders involving torture
or terrorism.
Poverty summit stalls
COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) - Discord
over money and how to spend it stalled progress

yesterday at a summit on poverty as delegates
jostled over ways to raise global living standards.
After two days of the U.N. World Summit for
Social Development, delegates were still trying to
work out provisions on foreign aid, debt relief and
education funding.
The issues were among the most contentious
at the summit, the first attempt to reach global
consensus on fighting poverty and unemploy
ment.
Nearly 9,000 delegates from 183 nations
flowed through the sprawling convention center,
making a central hall look more like an interna
tional train station than a summit meeting.
Piles of colorful brochures, posters and book
lets were scattered in corridors, forming an
obstacle course of issues — literally and figura
tively — for delegates and journalists at the
weeklong session.
The summit is supposed to hammer out a final
document to be signed Sunday by nearly 120
national leaders, including Vice President A 1
Gore, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and more
than 100 other leaders.
NYPD Nude
NEW YORK (AP) - The city's No. 1 naked
crimefighter was fired yesterday by the police
commissioner, who said she used her badge to
make a quick buck in Playboy magazine's "NYPD
Nude" pictorial.
Carol Shaya, who made $100,000 posing in
and out of uniform last August, was dismissed by
Commissioner William Bratton, who overruled a
departmental recommendation that she lose one
month's pay and spend a year on probation.
"The reputation of the New York Police
Department is not for sale, and there's no room
in our organization for anyone who would
attempt to do so," Bratton said.
Playboy spokeswoman Diane Stefani said
Bratton's decision might reflect his personal feel
ings.
"We believe looking at pictures of beautiful
women nude is a good thing, and positive," she
said. "But many of us are frightened by the
human body unclothed."
Shaya, 25, was shown posing with handcuffs,
gun and nightstick in some pictures, and without
them in others.
After a departmental trial in January, the
four-year NYPD veteran was found guilty of
"engaging in conduct detrimental to the good
order, efficiency and discipline of the depart
ment."
