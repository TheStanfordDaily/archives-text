						bad interpretation 
### 
University should not
waste time and money
on an appeal of Grey

NOW THAT a superior court
judge has ruled that the
Grey Interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard — Stan
ford's "speech code" — is unconsti
tutional, the University has two
options: defend the code with an
appeal or put it behind us.
The choice is not an easy one.
Mounting an appeal would be an
expensive undertaking, but if Stan
ford backs off it could face criticism
for abandoning a code that some
campus groups feel is necessary.
Faced with a tightening budget
and more important priorities,
however, the University should cut

its losses by choosing the lat
ter.
During its five-year exis
tence, the Grey Interpreta
tion — which the University
never used — faced growing
student opposition, includ
ing a 1992 attempt by sever
al ASSU senators to repeal

the senate's endorsement of the
code.
Although that attempt failed,
one of the senators behind it, for
mer Law School student Rob
Corry, went on to file a suit in 1994
that contested the legality of the
code in light of a 1992 California
statute — the Leonard Law —
which extends First Amendment
protections to students at private
universities.
Last Tuesday, Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge
Peter Stone ruled on the suit. He
rejected the Grey Interpretation
using the argument that the code
prohibits more than just "fighting
words" — which are not protected
by the First Amendment — by also
barring speech that would not
incite immediate violence.
In addition, Stone ruled that the
code also directly violates the First
Amendment by prohibiting speech

based on content rather than con
text.
Although reaction from the
community was mixed, the author
of the code, Law School Prof.
Thomas Grey, defended the legality
of his interpretation and encour
aged the University to appeal —
"partly to protect free speech."
Grey might be right in that the
speech code could be successfully
defended, but the University
should not feel compelled to appeal
so one of its professors can save
face. Lawsuits are expensive —
Grey himself admitted that they
cost "a lot of money" — and, in
these times of tight budgets, Stan
ford should not have to waste its
scarce funds on an appeal.
The rationale for letting the
speech code die extends beyond the
budget. A college campus is sup
posed to be a place that encourages

free expression, a place that
shouldn't even need a
speech code. In fact, when
the Grey Interpretation was
debated and implemented in
1990, it wasn't even
referred to as such; the
change was just considered
an amendment to Stan-

ford's Fundamental Standard.
Unfortunately, since its imple
mentation in 1990, the Grey Inter
pretation — in spite of its author's
apparent good intentions — has
been considered by many to be an
infringement on that right. That
appearance defeated the purpose of
the interpreytation altogether.
Quite simply, there are better
ways to fight hate speech than a
speech code that is perceived as
stringent and oppressing. In the
words of former University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, "Communi
ty disapproval is a more powerful
sanctity"; it certainly worked
against the violators of the Gay
Liberation statue last year
After Judge Stone's decision,
much of Stanford breathed a col
lective sigh of relief. We hope that
the University doesn't force us to
hold our breath again by appealing
the code.
