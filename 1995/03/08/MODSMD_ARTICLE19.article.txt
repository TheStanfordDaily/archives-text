Students clarify facts about Middle East peace process

WE WOULD LIKE to congratulate
Robert Blecher and Stanford
Middle Epst Focus for their let
ter published in The Daily on March 2.
We were pleased to discover that the
organization no longer holds Israel
responsible for the terrorist attacks
launched against itself by Palestinian
extremists, as was the claim in Rebecca
Stein's Feb. 24 letter. In addition, the
"daily incidents" of Jewish settler vio
lence presented in Stein's letter have
been reduced to "numerous cases"; the
"army collusion" with the attack on the
Hebron Mosque suggested by Stein has
now been reevaluated by Blecher et al as
inadequate security measures taken by
the Israeli army. To facilitate the rapid
progress demonstrated by Middle East
Focus in adjusting its claims, may we
suggest that the learned members of the
organization now turn their attentions
to actually reading the documents and
agreements they cite endlessly in their
letters, as this might prove helpful in
constructing their next "readjusted"
opinion.
Blecher claims that "7,000 Palestini
ans remain in Israeli prisons despite the
terms of the Oslo accords." Unfortunate
ly for Blecher, the accords cited neglect
ed to include any reference to release of
Palestinian prisoners. Perhaps Blecher
was confused, and actually meant to
refer to the Gaza-Jericho agreement
(signed on May 4, 1994). In Article XX of

this agreement, Israel commits to the
release of "5,000 Palestinian detainees
and prisoners." Blecher may be unaware
of the fact that Israel fulfilled this obli
gation. Similarly, Israel and the PLO are
engaged in ongoing negotiations regard
ing redeployment of Israeli forces on the
eve of a Palestinian election, in complete
accordance with the Oslo accords (Arti
cle XIII). Rabin's refusal "to withdraw
any Israeli troops from the occupied ter
ritories" exists only in Focus's letter,
and once again, Israel's violation of the
accord is a figment of Blecher's imagina
tion. If Middle East Focus is intent on
uncovering violations of the Oslo accord,
perhaps they should refer to Yasser
Arafat's promise to Israel (in a letter to
Rabin dated Sept. 13, 1995) to change
Article XV of the Palestinian National
Covenant that calls for"the elimination
[actually liquidation in the original Ara
bic] of Zionism in Palestine." Arafat has
yet to fulfill this commitment.
The one-sided argument presented by
Middle East Focus in both their letters
leads us to the (unfounded, we hope)
suspicion that the organization is taking
a somewhat slanted approach to the con
flict, thereby abating its academic credi
bility. For example, Blecher et al claim
that "since taking office, Rabin's govern
ment has seized 27,500 additional acres
of Palestinian territory," yet neglect to
mention that Rabin's government has
withdrawn from 365 square kilometers

in the Gaza strip and 65 square kilome
ters in Jericho, an area equivalent to
107,500 acres. They mention that 100
Palestinians are believed to have been
killed by Israeli settlers since 1988, but
decline to report that over 111 Israeli
citizens have been killed by Palestinian
terrorists since September 1993.
Middle East Focus blames Israel for
taking inappropriate measures to battle
settler violence. Apparently, they feel
that the measures taken by the Pales
tinian authority to battle the far more
prevalent terrorism against Israel, mea
sures described by Palestinian Minister
of Planning and International Coopera
tion, Nabil Sha'ath, as "a show that lasts
two or three days," are more adequate.
According to Hamas spokesman Ibrahim
Ghawshah, Arafat indicated to Islamic
leaders in a recent meeting in Cairo that
he does not oppose the activity of the
Hamas' terrorist wing Iz a-Din al-Qas
sam, as long as these activities are aimed
at Israel, and not at the Palestinian
Authority (Sawt al-Sha'b, Jan. 19,
1995). At best, such a statement can be
interpreted as an admittance by Arafat
that he cannot control the terrorist orga
nizations. At worst, it suggests the cyni
cal gains Arafat hopes to make as a
result of terrorist attacks, in terms of
forcing Israeli concessions.
We would like to emphasize that we
do not deny the fact that settler violence
against Palestinian civilians exists, nor

that such violence is detrimental to the
peace process. However, to point out this
violence as the main obstacle to peace,
while ignoring such "minor" factors as
Palestinian terrorism and Arafat's
inability to gain control over his own
council, let alone establish his leadership
over the Palestinian people, cannot con
stitute the basis for a serious and schol
arly discussion of the issues.
It is unfortunate that Blecher and
Stein signed their letters as representa
tives of Stanford Middle East Focus, for
while such bias could be excused in the
case of personal opinion, it is inexcusable
in the case of a "professional" forum,
undermining the academic integrity and
credibility of the entire organization.
Since we would like to believe that Mid
dle East Focus's research is driven by
purely academic (as opposed to, say, pro-
motives, we are forced to
conclude that the members of the orga
nization lack access to crucial informa
tion and authentic primary sources. In
the interest of the successful completion
of the Ph.D. candidacies of several of
Middle East Focus's members, we
encourage them to make use of such
sources, and are more than willing to
supply them with the necessary docu
mentation.
