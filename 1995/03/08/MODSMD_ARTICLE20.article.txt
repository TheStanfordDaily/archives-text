# Kennedy explains his feelings on speech code
## 
### 
Mark Perlroth, in The Daily of
March 7, writes that I "defended Stan
ford's speech code" in an earlier Daily
treatment of the recent court decision.
The hostile personal tone of his letter
— and of previous correspondence
from him on other subjects — would

suggest that his anger at me reflects a
past history quite unrelated to the
matter at hand. Indeed it does.
Nevertheless, his letter provides a
welcome opportunity to explain an
important distinction. As to history: as
the then-chair of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council will testify, I had
significant reservations about the Grey
standard, although I thought it a care
fully-conceived effort to leave the First
Amendment intact. I declined to veto
it because the process had provided

something both the Faculty Senate
and the ASSU Senate approved; this
community has, after all, a right to
self-government — in the interest of
which, presidential veto of such mea
sures is reserved for exceptional cir
cumstances.
As to the present: Dr. Perlroth's
claim is somewhat dulled by the fact
that — in the same article to which he
referred — I recommended against an
appeal. Nevertheless, I think we ought
to have a community standard that

will lead us to deplore hate speech.
The distinction I made is between a
rule, violations of which may result in
sanctions, and a standard, violations of
which may result in community disap
proval. The court speaks only to the
former. We still have the capacity to
disapprove, and I hope we will not hes
itate to use it.
