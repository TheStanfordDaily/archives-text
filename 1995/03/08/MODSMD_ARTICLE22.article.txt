## Palo Alto is a dumb place 
### 
I THINK the title pretty much sums
up this column, so for those of you
with better things to do than read
the typically insipid words of a Daily
columnist, you may stop reading and
check your e-mail now.
That being said, let's talk about that
fine town that everyone knows and
loves, Palo Alto. As of 5:36 p.m., March
6, Palo Alto is the most boring place in
California, perhaps even the world. The
term "Palo Alto" is Esperanto for
"bland suburb." I find it no wonder that
students don't get off campus that often
when all they are offered in the immedi
ate vicinity is a string of bagel shops and
fancy wind-chime stores. Oh yes, let's
not forget — there's a Burger King as
well.
Let us face the God-awful facts: Palo
Alto does not offer us very much. In
fact, the only good thing that it does
have is a Caltrain station so that we can
get the hell out of here when we need to.
What does Palo Alto consist of? I'll tell
you. There's University Avenue, Cali
fornia Avenue and Paly High, none of
which are very exciting places to be.
Who can honestly say that they would
like to spend a day at the House of
Foam?
Each time I go to Palo Alto to pick up
my monthly supply of Styrofoam
peanuts and lemons, I notice that I keep
seeing the same people that I see every
day on campus. They are all young,

trendy, have nice haircuts — and are
eating bagels. Sometimes there is a gen
tleman openly playing with himself in
front of Burger King. That's when it
strikes me: I'm still on campus! I never
left!
Yes, folks, it's true. Palo Alto is just a
clever extension of Stanford University.
It's designed to keep us caged in, to
make us feel that we are taking a break
from campus — yet it's all a facade.
We're trapped like rats in this maze of
palm trees and sidewalks. Just like the
little Pillsbury Dough-Boy, we also must
giggle with joy as they prod us in our
soft — yet oh-so delicious — bellies. Is
anyone reading this? Please, send help.
The editors haven't fed me for days. My
eyeballs are beginning to sweat.
Where was I again? Oh, thank you,
Mymek, my only friend. ... As I was
saying, Palo Alto is a hideous place,
straight out of an "Outer Limits"
episode.
And another thing — why is it that
everything in Palo Alto closes at 10 in
the evening? Stanford is a college, isn't
it? Then I would assume that would
make Palo Alto a so-called college town.
It would make much more sense to me if
some of the local merchants tried to
keep there shops open a little later to
cater to a student clientele. Here's a
pop-quiz for you.
Q: What is the one business in Palo
Alto that stays open 24 hours?

A: Kinko's Copies.
Right on! My idea of a fun, late-night
is hanging out with Jerry, the employee
of the month at Kinko's. If the boss isn't
around, maybe he'll let me play with the
color copierl But seriously, if Kinko's
can manage to operate all night, surely
Printer's Inc. can. Hell, I'd even settle
for an all-night bagel shop.
Speaking of late-night hangouts,
things aren't much better on campus,
either. We've got the Coffee House, but
that place quickly loses charm, especial
ly after your third Monster Burrito;
plus, it closes at midnight. The only all
night congregation areas on campus are
the study room at Meyer, the offices of
the Stanford Review and Xanadu room
211 (tell 'em T.J. sent you). This is not
the sign of a healthy campus.
So that's all I have to say about that.
Before I go however, I'd like to ask a
favor of you students. For an upcoming
column, I'd like student input. I want
everyone out there to call 723-1468 and
leave a message telling me what your
worst nightmare is. Leave your name,
and try to do it all while impersonating
Mickey Rourke.

Sean has never worked at Safeway and
never will. He does not enjoy mopping
up vomit.
