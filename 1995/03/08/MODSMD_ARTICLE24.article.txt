## Ronald Hilton Situation in Chiapas is much more complicated than it appears 
### 
There is through
out Latin America
a plan to wreck
the present economic
ties with the United
States. The events in
Chiapas, which were
headlined on Feb. 10
when President Zedillo
decided to take military
action against the Zap-

atista National Liberation Army, were
the culmination of a process which had
gone unnoticed in the United States.
Unkind commentators have said that he
was simply trying to assert his power,
but there is much more to it than that.
The long-prepared crackdown occurred
a few days after unusual ceremonies
were held throughout Mexico to cele
brate the constitution of 1917. The pur
pose of these celebrations was to assert
respect for the constitution, which was
the work of anti-American President
Venustiano Carranza. It was thus a
Mexican constitution, embodying the
ideals of the Mexican Revolution.
Subcomandante Marcos should work
through it; the Revolution has been
institutionalized, no new revolution was
needed. The Revolution was anti-cleri
cal, and therefore Bishop Samuel Ruiz of
San Cristobal de las Casas, posing as an
intermediary but accused of siding with
the Zapatistas, should keep his nose out
of the affair. When the crackdown
occurred, he shut himself up in his
church and refused to talk with
reporters. Subcomandante Marcos was
trained by the Jesuits, who are charged
with supporting the rebels in El Sal
vador.
Behind this much-publicized Mexican
crackdown there is a continent-wide
grand design. In the past, anti-Ameri
canism in Latin America took two
forms, the popular and the cultural. The
latter was characteristic of literati who
took France as a model, while the more
conservative appealed to the Spanish
tradition. Now economic concerns have
replaced cultural values, and anti-Amer
icanism has become one phenomenon.
Americans are generally unaware of
this, since Latin American government
spokesmen choose their words carefully
when addressing Americans, masking
realities. The result is mass-scale

hypocrisy.
California Proposition 187 and the
Mexican peso bailout have exacerbated
anti-Americanism in Mexico, as has
been evident in speeches to Mexican
crowds, including those at meetings cel
ebrating the 1917 Constitution. Speak
ers have harangued against Proposition
187, with no mention of the harsh Mex
ican measures against illegal immigra
tion from Guatemala, for example. I
first traveled through Chiapas and
Guatemala in 1943 and was struck by
the social injustice which now has led to
a virtual civil war.
However, the issue is much more
complex than Americans think. There is
a Cuban involvement which scares the
Mexican government. The Chiapas trou
bles, an extension of those in Central
America, have spread to neighboring
Tabasco, whose capital Villahermosa is
in the Grijalba estuary, where the jungle
rivers running down from Chiapas con
verge. Communications between the
Yucatan coast and Cuba are hard for the
Mexican government to control. The plot
embraced the state of Veracruz, and
indeed the whole Caribbean coast; Sub
comandante Marcos is from Tamaulipas.
President Lazaro Cardenas, who
nationalized Mexican oil, is a popular
hero and a symbol of anti-Americanism,
as is Emiliano Zapata, a national figure
whose name was taken by the Chiapas
revolutionaries. The use of Chiapas as a
base was meant to hide their nationwide
aims, in alliance with Cuauhtemoc
(named after the Aztec martyr chief)
Cardenas, son of President Cardenas
and leader of the left-wing Party of the
Democratic Revolution, to make com
mon cause with him. The committing of
Mexican oil revenues as collateral for
the peso bailout has given new life to the
old slogans about oil. While Mexican
spokesmen were trying to reassure
American bankers that their dollars
were safe, popular speakers throughout
Mexico used the celebrations commemo
rating the 1917 Constitution to rail
against the threat to Mexico's oil. A
speaker at a mass meeting in Mexico
City's main square, the Zocalo, was
especially vehement.
Cuba's new role in Latin America has
scarcely been noticed. Having lost his
Soviet backers, Castro is cultivating

Spain, which "remembers the Maine,"
but not as the old American battle cry
meant it. For Spain, it heralded humili
ating defeat at Yankee hands, just as it
condemned Cuba to colonial status.
Both countries have a common, linger
ing resentment. Latin America and
Spain feel humiliated by the imperial
role of the U.S. in Latin America, as
embodied in the Monroe Doctrine. For
them the Americas meeting convened in
Miami by President Clinton had
unpleasant overtones.
Just days before the Mexican crack
down, there was a strange "cultural"
event: Madrid-based Ibero-American
Educational Television cooperated with
Cuba in staging a three-day TV talk-in
at Havana's Conventions Palace. It was
featured on Spanish and Cuban televi
sion, and also in many parts of Spanish
America. Technically it was impressive.
From all over Spanish America teachers
and students at schools of education
sent in their messages by phone, fax or
e-mail. In Havana there was a panel of
three: an anchor woman, a Cuban and a
Spanish or Spanish American intellec
tual. Spanish is a beautiful language,
and the participants rejoiced in it, at the
expense of substantive discussion.
Especially revealing was the day
when the two male participants were
the Cuban Minister of Education (a
black), and the Latin American field
representative of UNESCO. In view of
the fact that we are this year celebrating
the 50th anniversary of the founding of
the U.N. and implicitly of its special
agencies, his performance was evidence
that UNESCO has not been depoliti
cized, as the U.S. demanded. Since the
U.S. is no longer an active member and
does not pay dues, the representative
felt free to imply that the U.S. was the
enemy of Latin America, whose cultural
unity he stressed in eloquent terms,
with the implication that the U.S. was
totally alien. He did not go so far as to
propose that there is an Ibero-American
mathematics, but he proclaimed that
Latin America must have its own eco
nomic system. He trotted out old left
wing talk about (neo-colonial) depen
dency, and criticized the role in Latin
America of Milton Friedman and his
boys, which sounded like an oblique ref
erence to Mexican President Zedillo and

his U.S.-trained economists, including
Stanford-trained Secretary of Economy
Guillermo Ortiz.
The hypocrisy of this anti-American
ism was evident in that there was no
open criticism of Latin American gov
ernments. Especially obvious was the
total absence of any reference to Cas
tro's shortcomings. The aim was clearly
to influence Latin American teachers,
and through them the next generation
of Latin Americans.
Talking about the need for wise lead
ers, the UNESCO man quoted Confu
cius, whom the present Chinese regime
is exalting as its inspiration. This would
please both the Chinese and Fidel Cas
tro, who looked to Beijing when the
USSR and its aid collapsed. Beijing was
more than happy to respond. After the
November 1994 Seattle meeting of
Pacific states leaders convened by Pres
ident Clinton, Jiamg Zemin went to
Havana, obviously not to try the marti
nis. The Chinese aim was similar to that
of the USSR: to support Castro as a
thorn in the side of the U.S.. Castro has
accepted an invitation to go to Beijing
this year.
The role of Beijing in Latin America
generally is little known; it quietly backs
the Sendero Luminoso in Peru, which
defines itself as Maoist, but in general it
keeps its activities secret. At the very
least, it sympathizes with the revolu
tionaries in Central America. In con
trast, Taiwan has been openly courting
the Central American governments,
hoping that loans will gain their support
in its efforts to obtain recognition and
admission to the United Nations.
Strangely, behind all this stands
Japan, which is playing a double role.
Officially, it has correct relations with
the U.S., but, like China, it is not unhap
py with U.S. difficulties in Latin Ameri
ca. An important article on "Japan's new
nationalists" appeared in The
Economist of Jan. 14, 1995. They reject
the U.S. model and are seeking world
wide support for their ideas, especially in
China, which has responded with enthu
siasm; the idea that the governing party
can stay in power with this new nation
alism appeals to many leaders around
the world. We thus have two Japans, the
official Japan and the anti-U.S. Japan,
living in symbiosis. Quaddafi of Libya

played on Japanese feelings by issuing a
statement that the Kobe earthquake was
God's punishment for Japan's aligning
itself with the U.S.
To use a trite phrase, the Chiapas
troubles are but the tip of a huge iceberg.
History has not ended; to the foolishness
of thinking so must be added ignorance
of the situation described here. Both
have been evident in much of our report
ing on Chiapas and its Zapatistas, who
have the support (or more) of many of
our Latin Americanists, some deeply
involved. They rightly denounce the
plight of the Indians. Stanford named its
Mexican-American residence "Zapata
House." Behind that lies a story which is
too long to tell here, but it confirms the
information given here.
The role of Cuba in the Chiapas
imbroglio became clearer on Sunday,
Feb. 19, when three separate but related
events took place. Sandinista leader
Daniel Ortega returned to Managua
from Havana , where he had spent three
months allegedly for medical treatment
(he looked perfectly healthy and said he
felt fine). On his arrival in Managua, he
and other Sandinistas made rousing
speeches proclaiming that the struggle
would continue. A Cuban "commercial"
delegation arrived in Costa Rica. In San
Cristobal de las Casas a government
mob attacked the Episcopal palace of
Bishop Samuel Ruiz, whom the govern
ment accused of supporting the rebels.
He is in contact with the Jesuits of the
Central American University in San
Salvador, which has long been feuding
with the American Embassy. All of this
information holds together. Chiapas,
strategically located, is the center of a
much larger area threatened with seri
ous instability. Whatever our attitude
toward the Indians' complaints, this
must be recognized.

There is through
out Latin America
a plan to wreck
the present economic
ties with the United
States. The events in
Chiapas, which were
headlined on Feb. 10
when President Zedillo
decided to take military
action against the Zap-

atista National Liberation Army, were
the culmination of a process which had
gone unnoticed in the United States.
Unkind commentators have said that he
was simply trying to assert his power,
but there is much more to it than that.
The long-prepared crackdown occurred
a few days after unusual ceremonies
were held throughout Mexico to cele
brate the constitution of 1917. The pur
pose of these celebrations was to assert
respect for the constitution, which was
the work of anti-American President
Venustiano Carranza. It was thus a
Mexican constitution, embodying the
ideals of the Mexican Revolution.
Subcomandante Marcos should work
through it; the Revolution has been
institutionalized, no new revolution was
needed. The Revolution was anti-cleri
cal, and therefore Bishop Samuel Ruiz of
San Cristobal de las Casas, posing as an
intermediary but accused of siding with
the Zapatistas, should keep his nose out
of the affair. When the crackdown
occurred, he shut himself up in his
church and refused to talk with
reporters. Subcomandante Marcos was
trained by the Jesuits, who are charged
with supporting the rebels in El Sal
vador.
Behind this much-publicized Mexican
crackdown there is a continent-wide
grand design. In the past, anti-Ameri
canism in Latin America took two
forms, the popular and the cultural. The
latter was characteristic of literati who
took France as a model, while the more
conservative appealed to the Spanish
tradition. Now economic concerns have
replaced cultural values, and anti-Amer
icanism has become one phenomenon.
Americans are generally unaware of
this, since Latin American government
spokesmen choose their words carefully
when addressing Americans, masking
realities. The result is mass-scale

hypocrisy.
California Proposition 187 and the
Mexican peso bailout have exacerbated
anti-Americanism in Mexico, as has
been evident in speeches to Mexican
crowds, including those at meetings cel
ebrating the 1917 Constitution. Speak
ers have harangued against Proposition
187, with no mention of the harsh Mex
ican measures against illegal immigra
tion from Guatemala, for example. I
first traveled through Chiapas and
Guatemala in 1943 and was struck by
the social injustice which now has led to
a virtual civil war.
However, the issue is much more
complex than Americans think. There is
a Cuban involvement which scares the
Mexican government. The Chiapas trou
bles, an extension of those in Central
America, have spread to neighboring
Tabasco, whose capital Villahermosa is
in the Grijalba estuary, where the jungle
rivers running down from Chiapas con
verge. Communications between the
Yucatan coast and Cuba are hard for the
Mexican government to control. The plot
embraced the state of Veracruz, and
indeed the whole Caribbean coast; Sub
comandante Marcos is from Tamaulipas.
President Lazaro Cardenas, who
nationalized Mexican oil, is a popular
hero and a symbol of anti-Americanism,
as is Emiliano Zapata, a national figure
whose name was taken by the Chiapas
revolutionaries. The use of Chiapas as a
base was meant to hide their nationwide
aims, in alliance with Cuauhtemoc
(named after the Aztec martyr chief)
Cardenas, son of President Cardenas
and leader of the left-wing Party of the
Democratic Revolution, to make com
mon cause with him. The committing of
Mexican oil revenues as collateral for
the peso bailout has given new life to the
old slogans about oil. While Mexican
spokesmen were trying to reassure
American bankers that their dollars
were safe, popular speakers throughout
Mexico used the celebrations commemo
rating the 1917 Constitution to rail
against the threat to Mexico's oil. A
speaker at a mass meeting in Mexico
City's main square, the Zocalo, was
especially vehement.
Cuba's new role in Latin America has
scarcely been noticed. Having lost his
Soviet backers, Castro is cultivating

Spain, which "remembers the Maine,"
but not as the old American battle cry
meant it. For Spain, it heralded humili
ating defeat at Yankee hands, just as it
condemned Cuba to colonial status.
Both countries have a common, linger
ing resentment. Latin America and
Spain feel humiliated by the imperial
role of the U.S. in Latin America, as
embodied in the Monroe Doctrine. For
them the Americas meeting convened in
Miami by President Clinton had
unpleasant overtones.
Just days before the Mexican crack
down, there was a strange "cultural"
event: Madrid-based Ibero-American
Educational Television cooperated with
Cuba in staging a three-day TV talk-in
at Havana's Conventions Palace. It was
featured on Spanish and Cuban televi
sion, and also in many parts of Spanish
America. Technically it was impressive.
From all over Spanish America teachers
and students at schools of education
sent in their messages by phone, fax or
e-mail. In Havana there was a panel of
three: an anchor woman, a Cuban and a
Spanish or Spanish American intellec
tual. Spanish is a beautiful language,
and the participants rejoiced in it, at the
expense of substantive discussion.
Especially revealing was the day
when the two male participants were
the Cuban Minister of Education (a
black), and the Latin American field
representative of UNESCO. In view of
the fact that we are this year celebrating
the 50th anniversary of the founding of
the U.N. and implicitly of its special
agencies, his performance was evidence
that UNESCO has not been depoliti
cized, as the U.S. demanded. Since the
U.S. is no longer an active member and
does not pay dues, the representative
felt free to imply that the U.S. was the
enemy of Latin America, whose cultural
unity he stressed in eloquent terms,
with the implication that the U.S. was
totally alien. He did not go so far as to
propose that there is an Ibero-American
mathematics, but he proclaimed that
Latin America must have its own eco
nomic system. He trotted out old left
wing talk about (neo-colonial) depen
dency, and criticized the role in Latin
America of Milton Friedman and his
boys, which sounded like an oblique ref
erence to Mexican President Zedillo and

his U.S.-trained economists, including
Stanford-trained Secretary of Economy
Guillermo Ortiz.
The hypocrisy of this anti-American
ism was evident in that there was no
open criticism of Latin American gov
ernments. Especially obvious was the
total absence of any reference to Cas
tro's shortcomings. The aim was clearly
to influence Latin American teachers,
and through them the next generation
of Latin Americans.
Talking about the need for wise lead
ers, the UNESCO man quoted Confu
cius, whom the present Chinese regime
is exalting as its inspiration. This would
please both the Chinese and Fidel Cas
tro, who looked to Beijing when the
USSR and its aid collapsed. Beijing was
more than happy to respond. After the
November 1994 Seattle meeting of
Pacific states leaders convened by Pres
ident Clinton, Jiamg Zemin went to
Havana, obviously not to try the marti
nis. The Chinese aim was similar to that
of the USSR: to support Castro as a
thorn in the side of the U.S.. Castro has
accepted an invitation to go to Beijing
this year.
The role of Beijing in Latin America
generally is little known; it quietly backs
the Sendero Luminoso in Peru, which
defines itself as Maoist, but in general it
keeps its activities secret. At the very
least, it sympathizes with the revolu
tionaries in Central America. In con
trast, Taiwan has been openly courting
the Central American governments,
hoping that loans will gain their support
in its efforts to obtain recognition and
admission to the United Nations.
Strangely, behind all this stands
Japan, which is playing a double role.
Officially, it has correct relations with
the U.S., but, like China, it is not unhap
py with U.S. difficulties in Latin Ameri
ca. An important article on "Japan's new
nationalists" appeared in The
Economist of Jan. 14, 1995. They reject
the U.S. model and are seeking world
wide support for their ideas, especially in
China, which has responded with enthu
siasm; the idea that the governing party
can stay in power with this new nation
alism appeals to many leaders around
the world. We thus have two Japans, the
official Japan and the anti-U.S. Japan,
living in symbiosis. Quaddafi of Libya

played on Japanese feelings by issuing a
statement that the Kobe earthquake was
God's punishment for Japan's aligning
itself with the U.S.
To use a trite phrase, the Chiapas
troubles are but the tip of a huge iceberg.
History has not ended; to the foolishness
of thinking so must be added ignorance
of the situation described here. Both
have been evident in much of our report
ing on Chiapas and its Zapatistas, who
have the support (or more) of many of
our Latin Americanists, some deeply
involved. They rightly denounce the
plight of the Indians. Stanford named its
Mexican-American residence "Zapata
House." Behind that lies a story which is
too long to tell here, but it confirms the
information given here.
The role of Cuba in the Chiapas
imbroglio became clearer on Sunday,
Feb. 19, when three separate but related
events took place. Sandinista leader
Daniel Ortega returned to Managua
from Havana , where he had spent three
months allegedly for medical treatment
(he looked perfectly healthy and said he
felt fine). On his arrival in Managua, he
and other Sandinistas made rousing
speeches proclaiming that the struggle
would continue. A Cuban "commercial"
delegation arrived in Costa Rica. In San
Cristobal de las Casas a government
mob attacked the Episcopal palace of
Bishop Samuel Ruiz, whom the govern
ment accused of supporting the rebels.
He is in contact with the Jesuits of the
Central American University in San
Salvador, which has long been feuding
with the American Embassy. All of this
information holds together. Chiapas,
strategically located, is the center of a
much larger area threatened with seri
ous instability. Whatever our attitude
toward the Indians' complaints, this
must be recognized.
