# A 						chance to learn from Stanford's best
## 50 frosh to earn spots in Sophomore College pilot program led by Rice, Saldívar 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
A new summer program will allow 50 cur
rent freshmen to take classes from such well
known University faculty members as Provost
Condoleezza Rice and Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Ram6n Saldivar.
The new Sophomore College — a three-week
educational program to be held in September —
will optimally "open the door" to close student
interaction with senior faculty and stronger
sophomore advising networks, said Saldivar,
the program's director.
The college will introduce sophomores to aca
demic disciplines in the humanities and the
social and natural sciences — within the context
of a community consisting of faculty mentors,
peer advisers and concentrated resources.
In short, the college will hopefully "create an
intellectual atmosphere that's certainly there at
Stanford but sometimes needs some nurtur
ing," Saldivar said.
The college will be available to students at no
cost, as the University will fund the program,
Saldivar added.
Students will be chosen for September's pro
gram through self-nominations and suggestions

from faculty, resident fellows and deans of eth
nic centers. This selection process will hopefully
result in a broad cross-section of the student
population, Saldivar said.
The exact criteria for selection have not yet
been formalized, but Saldivar said enthusiasm
and interest will be important qualities.
Saldivar said administrators hope to expand
the program each year, perhaps to the point
when it might someday encompass all sopho
mores.
This is purely "wild speculation," said Saldi
var, but he added that it is not entirely unfeasi
ble.
Selected sophomores will arrive on campus
in early September to engage in one of five aca
demic projects, ranging from Field research to
laboratory experiments to in-depth tutorials.
In particular, the college will address issues
surrounding sophomore advising. Sophomores
are popularly perceived as being in a "black
hole" in terms of lacking advisory direction,
Saldivar said, adding that the dearth of effective
advising helped motivate the formation of the
college.
Rice — one of five faculty members commit
ted to this fall's venture — said she sees the col
lege as bridging the gap between the freshman

and sophomore years.
Joining Rice as college faculty will be Saldi
var, Senior Assoc. Dean of Engineering John
Bravman and Law School Prof. Robert Weis
berg. One more faculty member will be chosen
at a later date.
The prominence of these faculty members
reflects the University's desire to improve
sophomores' relationships with faculty, Saldi
var said.
Rice said she decided to tackle this additional
project on top of her provostial duties simply
because, "I love to teach." She said she looks for
ward to the experience of teaching sophomores
in a small-group setting.
The College is Saldfvar's elaboration on the
Commission on Undergraduate Education's
recommendation to link the existing Honors
College — when students working on honors
theses gather in small groups with professors —
to the dilemmas of sophomore advising.
Asst. Dean of Humanities and Sciences Ellen
Woods, who first fleshed out this connection,
said she sees the college as an opportunity for
students to share the excitement of working on
substantive projects together.
Two student advisers, who will probably be
upperclassmen, will work with each core group
