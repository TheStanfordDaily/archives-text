## Bug on bugs Why love-seeking insects like to swarm around us 
### Cris Neill Staff Writer 
Q'J've noticed this big swarm of bugs in
the same place a couple of days in a row.
How come they do this?

A: Have you ever noticed in the spring and
summer that whenever you walk out into
a big field, you suddenly get a tremen
dous cloud of bugs around your head? Even if
they aren't mosquitoes or something that
wants to make a meal out of you, they seem to
amuse themselves by getting into your eyes,
nose, mouth, etc.
It turns out that these swarms all form for
the same reason — sex. The swarms are made
up of a bunch of males who find a suitable land
mark, and then hover around waiting for a
female to come along and mate with them. It's
kind of like a fraternity party, without all the
beer and testosterone.
If a female is in the mood, she flies up to the
swarm, grabs onto a male and pulls him down
to the ground, where they do the nasty and
move on. Typical sex ratios in these clouds (as

evidenced by a sweep of the
net) are 4300 males to 22
females, even worse than
Exotic Erotic.
However, this is actually
good for both sexes. As
everybody knows, guys are
always ready, so they can
just wait in the crowd for
the females to come to
them. If they were to strike
out on their own, their
chances of finding a willing
female would be pretty
small — it's better to let the
women seek them out. In
fact, many species of

insects, from gnats and mosquitoes up to
mayflies and horseflies, have resorted to their
own form of the Greek system for a social life.
So how do they know where to hang out? At
Stanford, there are the obvious choices for a
chance rendezvous . . . the CoHo, the Dish or
the South Stacks of Green.
But it's even easier for these insects. They
just find any object they can use as a landmark.
Entomologists have found swarms forming
over everything from bushes, chimneys and
patio stones to beer cans and cornstalks. They
just position themselves over the landmark,
and then fly in a repetitive pattern that keeps
them in the same location until the female of
their dreams comes along.
So the bugs aren't just swarming around
each other — they really use this landmark.
This has been proven with a cool mind trick a
couple of entomologists used on the insects.
They put out a white sheet, and inevitably,
the bugs start swarming around it. Then they
cut the sheet in half and moved these pieces
apart, and presto, the swarm splits into two,
one above each sheet. They cut the sheet again,
and got two more swarms. If you do this enough
times, you can reduce this huge cloud down into
a whole bunch of tiny swarms, each over its
own little piece of the original cloth. In their
mindless swarming, they don't even realize
what has happened.
This explains why the clouds suddenly form
over your head. In the middle of a field, you're
probably one of the biggest landmarks. And if
you've seen the swarm in the same place every
day, it probably means that there's a pretty
good landmark around there.
Some species get even more sophisticated.
Some mosquitoes actually form two swarms —
a pancake-shaped swarm directly over a per
son's head and another column about a meter
above that. It is believed that the lower swarm
consists of miles waiting to pick up a female
who is headed in to make a meal out of the juicy
human; it's unknown why the rest of the males
bother forming the cloud above that.
There are also tricks to being the first male
to meet the female when she enters the swarm.
Mosquitoes actually have special antennae,
consisting of a long stalk with feathery side
branches, which are specifically tuned to pick
up the buzz of a female's wings. That annoying
whining noise in your ear is actually the "Stair
way to Heaven" for many a lovelorn mosquito.
Experiments have demonstrated this effect
using a tuning fork at just the right frequency,
and the males come swarming. Apparently,
some entomologists get their kicks by humming
at the right frequency and summoning the
mosquitoes like a Pied Piper of the ; nsect
world.
Some other swarming flies have developed
bifocals to help them out. The lower half of the
eye takes care of day-to-day activities, while the
upper half is specially designed to scope out the
airspace above them for potential mates. A
"babe-cam," if you will.
But it's not all fun and games in the insect
dating world. You even get the insect equiva
lent of "Basic Instinct." A female midge enters
a swarm of another species, grabs a male and
pulls him down, but then sticks her proboscis
into his head and makes a meal out of him.
Some are even clever enough to find a potential
landmark and wait for a swarm to form around
them.
So, the next time you see one of those
swarms, you'll know that it's the beginning of
spring, the season of love ... at least for bugs.
