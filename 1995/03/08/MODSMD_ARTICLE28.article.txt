# Stanford doctor feels specificity in T-cell reaction may hold answers to HIV virus

For a long time, scientists have relied on certain
immunological signals to examine the status of
AIDS and the HIV virus. Now, a Stanford immu
nologist says researchers may be measuring the
wrong signs.
CD4 cells, also known as helper T-cells, have
served as the traditional victims of AIDS at the
cellular level. Supposedly indicating the deficiency
of the immune system, their density (measured in
cells per milliliter of blood) is around 1000 in most
uninfected humans; in AIDS the density drops to
below 200.
But new evidence indicates that this measure
may be misguided. "We had been doing studies on
AIDS for five years," said Mario Roederer, an
immunologist at the Stanford Medical Center.
"We had been getting unusual types of measures.
There was a missing population of CDB cells in
HIV positive patients."
There are two major types of cells in Roederer's
research, CD4 and CDB. CD4 cells are the scouts of
the immune system; they warn other cells that a
foreign presence has infiltrated the body's defens
es. CDB cells are the soldiers of the system, ridding
the body of unwanted materials.
The last number of each name refers to the rel
ative percentages of each cell in the blood. CD4
cells form 70% of the body's immunological popu
lation, whereas CDB cells are a mere 30%. This
balance is remarkably constant across the human
race. "This proves that the body is somehow
counting the cells," said Roederer. "But we're not
sure how that works."
And this balance, which has been ignored in
favor of counting the CD4 cells, may be more
important than previously believed. "The func
tionality of an AIDS patient's immune system is
very different than an HIV-negative person,"
Roederer said. "It's been thought that this indi
cated a difference in each type of cell. But they
failed to take the ratios of distinct subsets into
account." In other words, the balance of cells in
the immune system may be just as indicative of
the virus as the absolute number of CD4 cells.
Each type of cell is further divided into two
categories — naive and memory cells. When a for
eign agent enters the body, it is accosted by naive
T-cells, which form antibodies tailored for that
specific agent. The next time the same type of
agent enters the body, these cells have formed a
"memory" of its properties and how to deal with
it. It is now called a memory cell. "It's an irre

versible process — you might say that the defini
tion of a memory cell is one that has specialized
past the point of no return," Roederer said.
For example, when you get the measles, the

body takes about a week to form
memory cells against the measles
virus and then another week to get
rid of it. The next time the virus
meets the immune system, the
memory cells are prepared; the first
time usually becomes the last time.
So the naive cells are crucial in
responding to new types of threats.
And in AIDS patients, the naive cell
population drops a great deal. Usu
ally they form about half of the
population of the CD4 and CDB
populations (35% and 15% of the
total populations, respectively).
In AIDS, their combined total
drops to below 20%. Furthermore,
the population of CDB cells grows
to more than 80% of the entire
immune system. This is not really
surprising — it is known that the
HIV virus cannot infect CDB cells,
and killing off the CD4 cells might
produce such a ratio.
But the ratio of naive to memory
cells is no longer one to one;
instead the memory CDB cells
dwarf the naive CDB cells by a con
siderable margin. The naive CDB
cells seem as vulnerable to the HIV
virus as the naive CD4 cells. "Even
in children with AIDS, whom you
would expect to have mostly naive
cells, the naive cell population has
dropped even below the memory
cell population."
"There are various theories con
cerning the rise in the population
of CDB cells," Roederer explained.
"It was thought that maybe the
CDB cells filled the hole in the
immune system left by the missing
CD4 cells. But why would the naive
CDS cells go away as well? Some
how in AIDS, production of new
naive T-cells is destroyed."
The balance is so fundamentally
critical, Roederer suggests, that
you could "almost argue that
restoring naive T-cells might take
care of the virus, or suppress it.

Let's face it — AIDS will probably not be cured.
It's like herpes. But we might be able to suppress
it very well. The goal is to find therapies that allow
patients to lead healthy, normal lives."
