# Researcher examines patterns of Palo Alto birds
## 
### Stacey Harp Contributing writer 
In 1798, Captain George Vancou
ver described what is thought to be
the Palo Alto area on his exploration
of America.
"For almost 20 miles it could be
compared to a park which had origi
nally been planted with the true
English oak," he wrote. "The lofty
ranges that bounded the prospect,
required only to be adorned with
neat habitations of an industrious
people to produce a scene not inferi
or to the most studied effect of taste
in the disposal of grounds."
The area has changed a great deal
since then. Captain Vancouver could
not have predicted how industrious
a people would eventually settle in
what has become known as Silicon
Valley, or that it would be the center
of high technology that it is today.
There is only scattered evidence
remaining of the park-like scene
Vancouver must have encountered.
The picture has become crowded
with cities, houses and businesses.
What is the cost of this urbaniza
tion? How have we modified the
habitat of the native species here
and what is the effect of such distur
bance?
Robert Blair, a postdoctoral fel
low in the Center for Conservation
Biology at Stanford, is interested in
these questions. "I have always

thought it important to look at what
is in your own backyard," Blair
explained.
While other researchers venture
to exotic, far-off places to do their
work, Blair has remained at Stan
ford, doing most of his research on
land owned by the University. "I
have to be in contact with the area
all the time, see it daily and
throughout the year, to see how it
changes with the seasons," he
added. "Many ecologists want to
work in pristine environments
because they want to know how the
natural world works, but the world
is not pristine."
Instead of finding a pristine area
in which to work, Blair has been
looking at the effect of increasing
urbanization on bird communities
in the Stanford area.
Blair began his study by identify
ing six sites of differing urbaniza
tion. He obtained aerial photographs
of each site. Using these pho
tographs, he determined the area of
land covered by trees and shrubs,
grassland, lawn, pavement and
buildings at each site.
The sites, ordered from most pris
tine to most urban, were the biolog
ical preserve at Jasper Ridge, the
open-space recreation area around
the Dish, the Stanford golf course, a
residential area within the faculty
housing area, a business park and
downtown Palo Alto.

Analysis of the data included
determination of the number of bird
species, types of species, bird
biomass and the number of native
species found at each site. The
native population was defined as
those birds living at the preserve.
"When looking at native bird
species, it was striking, although not
surprising, to find that as the level
of development increased from the
preserve to the residential area to
downtown, there was a marked
decrease in the number of these
species found at each site," Blair
said. Of the 21 native species spotted
at the preserve, 14 remained at the
recreation area, 12 at the golf
course, 10 in the residential area,
nine in the office park and only
three in the downtown area.
However, when Blair compared
the number of species, including
invasive species — those not native
to the area that have moved in from
neighboring areas, such as the
white-throated swift or exotic
species from other countries — he
found a surprising trend. The num
ber of different species peaked at the
golf course.
In order to understand Blair's
hypothesis for why this is the case, it
is important to understand the
"edge effect". The edge effect refers
to the idea that where two types of
habitat meet, an edge is created.
"Traditionally," Blair explained,
"edges are very species-rich where
bushes meet field or where woods
meet pasture because they provide a
mixture of resources."
Blair uses the edge effect concept
to explain why golf courses are
attractive to many different species.
"If you develop a little bit, you are
bringing in new resources. You are
watering to keep the vegetation
growing year round and bringing in
different species of plants," Blair
said. "You are bringing in resources
that species can use and on top of
that, you are chopping up habitat,
creating more edges."
In the coming months, Blair's
paper, "Land use and species diver
sity: bird communities along an
urban gradient" will be published in
the journal Ecological Applications.
In that paper, Blair explains that
"the apparent increase in species
richness results from the addition of
widely-distributed species at the
expense of species from the native
bird community."
It has been observed that native
species tend to be "interior species":
they often live in the center of a
habitat rather than at the edges.
"This chopping up tends to bring in

just the widespread species," Blair
added. "For example, the heavily
wooded area at Jasper Ridge does
not have starlings in the middle, but
there are starlings at the edge.
When you chop up habitat, you
allow more of these 'weedy' species,
but you are losing those species that
need big areas of woods."
Why should we make an effort to
conserve our native bird species?
"Invasive species tend to be invasive
all over the world," Blair said. "One
set of very hardy species is excluding
the others so we are losing a lot of
diversity and species that evolved in
specific areas. Some people say that
this is natural, but it has definitely
been hastened by humans since the
industrial revolution."
Blair suggests a number of ways
in which developmental practices
could be modified to minimize the
impact on native species. "My work
really advocates clustered develop
ment," Blair said. "Instead of hav
ing research parks with nice green
areas separated by big, wide parking
lots, make everything into a dense
commercial district. Instead of hav
ing half acre lots, have clustered
housing and leave as much of the
surrounding area in its natural state
as possible."
Many developers and urban plan
ners are also in favor of this type of
development, although their con
cerns are primarily with aesthetics
and transportation problems.
Increasingly, however, planners
must consult with ecologists and
conservation biologists in order to
ensure that their projects will not be
halted due to concern over the
native wildlife of the area.
Blair said that his work clearly
demonstrates the deleterious effects
of urbanization on native species,
but that it is also evident that the
areas supporting the greatest num
ber of species are those of intermedi
ate development.
He said there is definite potential
for this information to be used to
the detriment of native species. "If
you wanted to set a site aside as a
place to save biodiversity," Blair
explains, "the natural reaction
would be to pick the place with the
most biodiversity. That means you
would be preserving the golf course.
In reality, however, the golf course
only carries 50 percent of the native
woodland species."
