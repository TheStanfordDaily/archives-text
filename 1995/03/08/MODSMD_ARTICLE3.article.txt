## International security expert Harvey moves to Washington for defense post 
### Beth Berselli Editorial staff 
The Pentagon announced yesterday that
Stanford scholar John Harvey has been ap
pointed to a high-level position in the U.S.
Department of Defense.
Harvey — who has served as the director
of the science program at Stanford's Center
for International Security and Arms Control
since 1990 — will assume his new post as
deputy assistant secretary of defense for
forces policy on March 21.
He is the second Stanford scholar to ac
cept a top post in the Defense Department
during the Clinton Administration. William
Perry, a professor of engineering-economic
systems, was appointed secretary of defense
in January 1994.
Harvey — who was brought to Stanford

by Perry — said it will be "an honor" to work
with Perry once more. "I think very highly of
him and am excited to work with him again,"
Harvey said.
In his new position, Harvey will oversee
for a variety of policies and programs relat
ing to nuclear arms and defense.
"I will be responsible for developing over
all national policy for our strategic and the
ater nuclear forces, including our interconti
nental ballistic missiles and submarine
launched ballistic missiles," he said.
Harvey said he sees several challenges in
his new role, which include considering fu
ture measures to reduce the threat "that
these weapons might some day be used."
But at the same time as this planning oc
curs, Harvey said, "we still need to maintain
the safety and security of our
remaining weapon stockpiles as we
de-emphasize nuclear weapons at
the end of the Cold War."
He added that his work at Stan
ford will aid him in his new posi
tion.
"My experience and activities at
Stanford at the center have been
an excellent preparation for this
job," Harvey said. "I can't think of
a better place than Stanford to do
research about these areas."
Harvey's colleagues were quick
to praise his appointment, citing his
skill and experience'as evidence
that he will succeed in his new post.
Political Science Prof. David

Holloway, co-director of the center,
said Harvey has done extensive
research on issues related to force
planning, theater defense against
ballistic missile attacks, the prolif
eration of weapons technology and
export controls on dual-use tech
nologies.
"He has been studying these
issues for a number of years," said
David Bernstein, a research associ
ate at the center. "He's recognized
as an authority in the field. He has
a broad-balanced perspective about
them, he is very open-minded . ..
he will do a great job."
Harvey said he plans to return
to the University one day and is
only taking a "leave of absence"
from his Stanford position.
Holloway said the center will
search for an interim replacement
for Harvey's position.
