## Peterson can't save the day Wolfpack drags down Cardinal 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Stanford 4
Nevada 7

For the fourth time this sea
son the Stanford baseball team
looked to freshman pitcher Kyle
Peterson to end a losing skid.
This time, however, not even
Peterson could stop the bleed
ing.
No. 17 Nevada (15-3) scored
six runs over a four-inning
stretch to post a 7-4 victory over
the No. 14 Cardinal (12-10) yes
terday afternoon at Sunken
Diamond. Peterson (3-1) — who
had posted three consecutive
wins following Stanford losses
going into yesterday's game —
was saddled with the first loss

of his collegiate career.
"I was real disappointed with
my performance today," said
Peterson, who allowed six runs
in six innings pitched. "These
are the types of days that you
just have to work through. I felt
like I had good stuff out there
but I just had trouble getting
guys out."
The Wolfpack struck for two
runs in the second, third and
sixth before the Cardinal
mounted a comeback which
would eventually fall short.
Nevada opened the scoring in
the second with a clutch two
out rally.
After retiring the first two
men of the inning, Peterson ran
into uncharacteristic control
problems, hitting third base
man Andy Dominique before
walking right-fielder John
Arnold. Both men came around
to score on singles from the bot
tom of the Wolfpack order, break
ing a string of 18 consecutive
scoreless innings from Peterson.
Nevada doubled its lead with a
triple and a home run before the
Cardinal could get on the board
in the third. Stanford scored two
runs in the bottom of the inning

on RBI singles from freshman
catcher Jon Schaeffer and junior
left fielder Cale Carter.
But the Wolfpack regained its
four-run advantage with another
two-out rally in the top of the
fifth.
Four straight Nevada hitters
singled after the first two batters
of the inning were out. Left field
er Shane Slayton, designated hit
ter Chris Briones and Dominique
had consecutive bloop singles to
put the Cardinal in a daunting 6-

2 hole.
"You throw strikes against
this team and you know they're
going to hit the ball," Peterson
said. "But it's my job to get them
out and whether they were hit
ting lasers or bloopers, I didn't do
a good enough job."
Peterson, who came into yes
terday's game as the most consis
tent pitcher on the Stanford
staff, gave up nine hits and
walked two while recording three
strike-outs.
The Cardinal crept back into
the game in the bottom of the
sixth when junior Brodie VanWa
genen launched his first home
run of the year. VanWagenen
sent a 1-2 pitch from Josh
Bendik, the Wolfpack's starter,
high over the left field wall to give
Stanford its first home run at
Sunken Diamond since Feb. 7.
"It's been frustrating all year
for me with my foot injury," said
VanWagenen, who has played in
just five games for the Cardinal
in 1995. "I hope that this is the
start of good things to come."
Despite having just 12 at-bats
on the year, VanWagenen has
come through in the clutch. The
junior belted a two-out RBI single
against Santa Clara which
brought home the winning run
for Stanford earlier this year.
"I've been in some big spots
before and the bigger the situa
tion the more I want to be in the
game," VanWagenen said. "Hope
fully if I can get a few hits that
will really help the team out."
VanWagenen, who finished
the day 2-for-4, also added a sin
gle in the eighth when the Cardi
nal threatened to get back in the
game. Sophomore shortstop Eric
Sees followed VanWagenen with
a single to put runners on first
and second and bring junior Rich
Crowe to the plate with just one
out and Stanford trailing 6-4.
Cardinal head coach Mark
Marquess called for a hit-and-run
but Crowe couldn't make contact
and VanWagenen — bad foot and
all — was gunned down at third
to end the rally.
"We were hoping he would hit
the ball and obviously it didn't
work out," VanWagenen said. "I
feel like I can run pretty well and
I would guess that my foot's at
about 90 percent."
The Wolfpack — who won the
Big West title last season and
have begun 1995 on a tear —
added an insurance run in the
ninth to squash any comeback
hopes Stanford may have had.
Bendik, who pitched seven
innings and allowed three runs,
picked up his second win of the
vear.
