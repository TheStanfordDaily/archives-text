This time, however, not even
Peterson could stop the bleed
ing.
No. 17 Nevada (15-3) scored
six runs over a four-inning
stretch to post a 7-4 victory over
the No. 14 Cardinal (12-10) yes

Diamond. Peterson (3-1) — who
had posted three consecutive
wins following Stanford losses

my performance today," said
Peterson, who allowed six runs
in six innings pitched. "These

The Wolfpack struck for two
runs in the second, third and
sixth before the Cardinal
mounted a comeback which
would eventually fall short.
Nevada opened the scoring in
the second with a clutch two
out rally.
After retiring the first two
men of the inning, Peterson ran
into uncharacteristic control

man Andy Dominique before
walking right-fielder John
Arnold. Both men came around
