# Sports' real home is in the Big Apple
## 
### 
Stanford's athletic teams pro
vide minimal excitement
compared to those that play
in the sports capital of the world,
New York City. Case in point: In
N.Y.C., grumblings about prime
seating taken up by rich and ine

briated fans at basketball games
has never been the stuff front
page news is made of. New York
ers know that their teams — not
their teams' fans — provide news
enough. This column pays
homage to the Big Apple's never
dull teams and provides critical
information for the thousands of
native N.Y. sports fans who are
stuck on the Farm with only the
lackluster sports section of the
N.Y. Times to guide them in their
quest for knowledge of the goings
on back in the Empire State.
Let's begin with the soon-to-be


The Real
Deal

Joe
Bialowitz
NBA champion New York
Knicks. After the Orlando Magic's
Anfernee Hardaway left Pat Reilly
scratching his head last week, the
Knicks' usually indefatigable
helmsman remarked that now he
knows how the opposing coaches
felt when they tried to defend
Magic Johnson. But have no fear,
Madison Square Garden patrons:
Anthony Mason is on a tear.
Though previously known to live
up to his name by dabbling in
bricklaying, Mase-in-your-face has
been lighting it up on the offensive
end as of late.
The news has not been as good
for the New York Mets. They
were no-hit by five Atlanta Braves
last Monday. When Mets manager
Dallas Green was asked if he knew
who those pitchers were, his reply
was indicative of the no-nonsense
style that makes him perfect for
New York: "No — and I don't care,
either. All I know is a lot of them
were named Brown." Green's
indifference might have insulted
replacement hurlers Keith and
Daren Brown, but the best Mets
manager since Davey Johnson
should really be asking the more
serious question of how the Braves

consistently find the best young
pitchers, pros or scabs regardless.
One thing's for sure: the old adage
about hitters being ahead of the
pitchers early in spring training
must not hold true for replacement
players.
And by the way, has anybody
caught those whimsical Bay Area
sports casters changing the names
of replacement baseball teams?
Referring to the S.F. Giants as the
"Midgets" makes sense, but there's
no way the Colorado Rockies
should be called the "Pebbles."
Everyone knows the "Rockettes" is
much more catchy and apropos.
The New York Jets have been
doing some major moving and
shaking, releasing Ronnie Lott and
Art Monk and signing free agent
Dexter Carter. What I'm waiting
for, however, is the signing of free
agent wide receiver Alvin Harper,
who worked out for the Jets two
weeks ago. The gifted Cowboy
could team with Rob Moore to cre
ate a receiving corp the likes of
which has not been seen in New
York since A 1 Toon and Wesley
Walker played together.
If you haven't done so already,
send your condolences to your
friends and family if they are New
York Giant fans. They lost a great
one last week in David Meggett,
who decided to be reunited with
the great Bill Parcells in New Eng

land. The Patriots will pay Meggett
$13 million over five years to be a
Jets-killer in the AFC East.
According to his friends, Meggett's
decision to leave was motivated by
Parcells' penchant for keeping vet
erans on his roster. Meggett appar
ently feared the fate of Pepper
Johnson, a veteran and friend who
was released by current head coach
Dan Reeves.
Finally, no New York sports
report would be complete without
the obligatory diss of the folks from
New Jersey. They really showed
their stripes last month when 150
Rutgers students decided to force
the postponement of a basketball
game in which they were leading
31-29 against national powerhouse
UMass. The students took to the
court at halftime in protest of some
controversial comments made by
Rutgers* president. Granted, the
protest needed to occur sometime,
but why do it when your team is
about to pull off a major upset? As
it turned out, the game was com
pleted on March 3 in Philadelphia,
where the Minutemen won 77-62
thanks to the services of Marcus
Camby, who had been injured when
the game was played originally.

Joe will get back on the Stanford
sports bandwagon as soon as the
men's basketball team starts win
ning again.
