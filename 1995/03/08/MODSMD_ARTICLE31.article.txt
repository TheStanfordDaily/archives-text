# Sports' real home is in the Big Apple

### 
Stanford's athletic teams pro
vide minimal excitement
compared to those that play
in the sports capital of the world,
New York City. Case in point: In
N.Y.C., grumblings about prime
seating taken up by rich and ine

briated fans at basketball games
has never been the stuff front
page news is made of. New York
ers know that their teams — not
their teams' fans — provide news
enough. This column pays
homage to the Big Apple's never
dull teams and provides critical
information for the thousands of
native N.Y. sports fans who are
stuck on the Farm with only the
lackluster sports section of the
N.Y. Times to guide them in their
quest for knowledge of the goings
on back in the Empire State.
Let's begin with the soon-to-be


The Real
Deal
