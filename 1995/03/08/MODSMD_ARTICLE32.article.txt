# Moore has help on road to recovery
## Higher power speeds up the healing process

It's interesting how tragedy
sometimes makes people
stronger. By the way she flips and
turns, it is hard to imagine that
six years ago Stanford gymnast
Misty Moore had trouble walk
ing.
Born in Austin, Texas, Misty is
the youngest of three children
and the only daughter born to
John and Diana Moore. She start
ed taking ballet lessons at the age
of three, and a few years later she
enrolled in a tumbling class.
Noticing that Misty had some tal
ent, the instructor suggested that
she try her hand at gymnastics.
As it turned out, Moore
became a star. Entering gymnas
tics at the age of seven, she quick
ly moved up the ranks and was
competing in the Elite division by
the time she began sixth grade.
She made the U.S. Junior
National Team at the age of 13,
meaning that she was one of the
12 best gymnasts in her age
group in the entire country.
Moore held her own against
the likes of former Olympians
Kim Zmeskal and silver medalist
Shannon Miller, and the three
were prodigies destined for
Barcelona. She often met
Zmeskal head to head, and the
two of them constantly traded all
around titles.
However, Misty's own
Olympic dreams were dashed one
March afternoon in 1989. Warm

tine at a meet in Oklahoma,
Misty over-rotated her dismount
and landed directly on her back.
Pain shot through her body.
Being the competitor that she
is, Moore finished the meet, dis
covering when she arrived home
that she had ruptured and bulged
discs in her back. To make mat

nerve running down her left leg,
affecting her ability to walk.
This star athlete with an enor
mous future now struggled to per
form even the most basic tasks.
"I couldn't even lay flat on the
bed," Moore said. "I could only go
to a half day of school because sit
ting in a chair hurt so badly."
As if this problem was not
enough, Misty's parents had
recently gone through a divorce, a
painful experience for children and
parents alike.
"Her self-esteem was pretty

low," Diana Moore said. "But then
she realized that God was every
thing and that God didn't make
junk."
Doctors gave Misty the option
of having surgery to have her disks
removed and have her vertebrates
fused together, but she declined.
She knew that this would definite
ly end her career, and instead she
opted for physical therapy. Howev
er, little did Misty know that her
doctor didn't think returning to
competitive gymnastics would he
possible anyway.
"He never told Misty this, but
the doctor told me that she would
never be able to do gymnastics
again," Diana Moore said. "Our
goal was that she would walk nor

mally."
During this time, Misty found
solace in a place so simple yet so
often overlooked. She had been
attending First Baptist
Pflugerville, and along with the
support of her friends at church
and her mother, Misty learned to
place her trust in God. A little less
than two years later, she was back
in the gym, performing once again.
"I believe that God healed me,"
Moore said. "The injury was a real
humbling experience, it made me
realize who was in control. I
learned to have total faith in Him,
because there was nothing that I
or the doctors could do."
Once physically able to perform,
Misty found herself having to start

all over again. Maneuvers that she
had done so effortlessly in the past
now seemed to evade her. Howev
er, her determination eventually
paid dividends. In 1992, less than
three years after her injury, Moore
came full circle, qualifying for the
United States National Team once
again. Only this time, it was as a
member of the senior squad.
Although she did not qualify for
the 1992 Olympics, by her senior
year Moore had received countless
scholarship offers from colleges
around the nation. Her decision to
come to the Farm contributed to
Stanford's top-rated recruiting
class.
"I never dreamed of being at a
school like this," Moore said. "It

has really been a blessing coming
here."
Moore has proved her worth
thus far this season, contributing
significantly to the Cardinal pro
gram. Her emergence as one of the
top beam scorers on the squad
along with her ability to quickly
implement her bars routine has
been a relief for coach Breck
Greenwood.
"It's been a huge boost for us,"
Greenwood said. "We were hurt
ing in that spot (bars), and it has
really helped us from a scoring
stand point."
Moore's success in gymnastics
has given her the opportunity to
receive a top-notch education;
missing out on the chance for

international glory does not linger
in her mind. Many athletes might
become bitter over having their
Olympic hopes shattered by an
injury, but Misty has not.
"I would go through it all over
again because of how much I
learned and how close I got to
God," Moore said. "I don't have
faith because my back was healed.
I would rather be in a wheelchair
for God than win a gold medal for
me.
Although some may not under
stand the reasons for Misty's faith,
perhaps it is because they don't
comprehend the source of her
strength.
"To God be the glory," Moore
said.
