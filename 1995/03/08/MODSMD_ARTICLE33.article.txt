team's leadoff hitter and she has definitely
helped Stanford keep the bases filled with
runners this year. Her .529 batting average
has led the Cardinal to an 8-8 record, Stan
ford's best start in team history. Lee's five
doubles and 15 RBI are also tops on the
squad.
On Saturday, Lee led the Cardinal's
offensive attack in an 8-4 victory over the
Lions of Loyola Marymount with three hits
in four trips to the plate and two RBIs. In
the second game of the doubleheader, Stan
ford did not fare as well in a 6-1 loss, but she
kept up the hot hitting with two singles.

team destroyed the rest of the field over the
weekend at the Pac-10 Conference Champi
onships. The sultans of swim posted a total
of 1042 points, breaking their own record
for the most points scored in such a contest.

than half the Cardinal mark.
The victory gave the human fish their
14th straight league title, breaking the
mark of 13 set by John Wooden's UCLA
basketball squad. Wooden was on hand to
present the trophy to the team.
