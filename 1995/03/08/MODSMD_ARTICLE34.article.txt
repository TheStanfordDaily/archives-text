# Hey! Support your Cardinal hoopsters

### 
It's as simple as a cheap sneak
er slogan: Just do it! Just go to
tomorrow's and Saturday
night's men's basketball games.
"Cardinal hoop fans of the world
unite!" (I believe that Marx him
self was a great proponent of
Stanford basketball.) Chip in and
help the squad capture an NCAA
tournament bid.

I am quite aware that, as a
journalist, using a column to gen
erate fan interest can be seen as
rather unorthodox and perhaps a
wee bit tacky. This extra plug for
the men will also probably draw
the ire of some other sports
departments (you know who you
are), but desperate times call for
desperate measures. And these
are indeed desperate times for the
Stanford men's basketball team.
After the Oregonians brought
out the brooms last weekend
against us (I say "us" because
underneath Dion Cross's deadly

jumpers and Brevin Knight's
smooth drives, we all still bleed
the same Cardinal red), the tour
nament berth that seemed a cinch
just a week ago now seems to be
fading like a bad case of home
made tie-dye.
Even Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery, not one to
frivolously employ hyperbole, has
said that his squad "absolutely"
must sweep these last two games.
The first is against Washington
State on Thursday night, and the
second is on Saturday versus
Washington. More details on the
individual matchups in upcoming
issues.
Alas, it was never supposed to
be like this. If the team had just
done its job and trashed the Ore
gon State Beavers like it was sup
posed to, none of this would have
happened and there would be no
need for me to waste our time by
writing this here column.
Sadly, that's not the case. We
lost to the Beavers. We're defi
nitely behind the eight ball, and
you're reading this column.
But if there's one lesson I
learned up in Oregon, it's about
the grandeur of the home court
advantage. Seeing the Oregon
Ducks at the Pit, I gained a sense
of this amazing phenomenon. The
