# Hey! Support your Cardinal hoopsters
## 
### 
It's as simple as a cheap sneak
er slogan: Just do it! Just go to
tomorrow's and Saturday
night's men's basketball games.
"Cardinal hoop fans of the world
unite!" (I believe that Marx him
self was a great proponent of
Stanford basketball.) Chip in and
help the squad capture an NCAA
tournament bid.

I am quite aware that, as a
journalist, using a column to gen
erate fan interest can be seen as
rather unorthodox and perhaps a
wee bit tacky. This extra plug for
the men will also probably draw
the ire of some other sports
departments (you know who you
are), but desperate times call for
desperate measures. And these
are indeed desperate times for the
Stanford men's basketball team.
After the Oregonians brought
out the brooms last weekend
against us (I say "us" because
underneath Dion Cross's deadly

jumpers and Brevin Knight's
smooth drives, we all still bleed
the same Cardinal red), the tour
nament berth that seemed a cinch
just a week ago now seems to be
fading like a bad case of home
made tie-dye.
Even Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery, not one to
frivolously employ hyperbole, has
said that his squad "absolutely"
must sweep these last two games.
The first is against Washington
State on Thursday night, and the
second is on Saturday versus
Washington. More details on the
individual matchups in upcoming
issues.
Alas, it was never supposed to
be like this. If the team had just
done its job and trashed the Ore
gon State Beavers like it was sup
posed to, none of this would have
happened and there would be no
need for me to waste our time by
writing this here column.
Sadly, that's not the case. We
lost to the Beavers. We're defi
nitely behind the eight ball, and
you're reading this column.
But if there's one lesson I
learned up in Oregon, it's about
the grandeur of the home court
advantage. Seeing the Oregon
Ducks at the Pit, I gained a sense
of this amazing phenomenon. The
capacity hometown crowd of


Daniel
Kao
10,000-plus was ripping and roar
ing. The suspended scoreboard
was swinging and swaying. And,
believe me, you felt all four stories
of the building rocking and
rolling. It was collective, commu
nal power at its best.
Now it's your turn.
If you've been to a game
before, then you already know all
about the excitement of Pac-10
hoops. Even when the play gets
ugly, which happens sometimes
— see USC — it's still never bor
ing. To cop a phrase from some
second-rate movie: "Pac-10 bas
ketball's like sex and pizza. ...
Even when it's bad, it's still pret
ty good."
No matter how dull or ugly a
game gets, an Andy Poppink jam
is still an Andy Poppink jam. And
if you think dunks, three-point
ers, and no-look passes are
soporific, then you should turn
the page and skip ahead to the
crossword puzzle.
It's not even a case anymore of
Stanford basketball being
mediocre. This year's squad pos

sesses tremendous game. The
team has been ranked nationally
most of the season and has shown
more than just a few flashes of
brilliance. It shouldn't be a situa
tion about going to see UCLA,
Arizona or Cal basketball. It's
about going to see Stanford bas
ketball.
Now is as good a time as any to
make yourself a part of the Cardi
nal hoops family. We'll be a force
for the next few years as well with
Knight only a sophomore and all
starters returning next year. A
basketball tradition is being built
in front of your very eyes and
there's plenty of room on the
wagon. Don't sprain your ankle,
fracture your leg, or break your
neck jumping on and off the band
wagon. Remember, if you get on,
stay on.
Which brings me to another
issue. For some of the more high
ly-hyped games, Maples has sold
out. But at others, Maples has
been a silent cavern. It's time for
Stanford fans to become hard
core fans. It should no longer be a
case of hopping on the bandwagon
when the team's ranked or when
the team's playing big, bad
UCLA. Stanford is quality too,
and if you're a quality sports fan,

you'll go to all games to see your
team. Besides, how can you pass
up the pageantry and ambience of
a college basketball game?
Also, when you do go (I know
you will), don't believe a word of
what your mother said to you
during all those lazy weekend
afternoons spent in front of the
TV engrossed in sports. Contrary
to what Mom believes, when you
cheer, you do indeed affect your
team's performance. Theoretical
ly, your presence and support is
just as important as Tim Young's
presence and performance.
The technical term for this is
the "oomph" effect. Don't under
estimate the power of this
"oomph" you give to the weary
bodies of Cardinal players every
time you yell and holler cheers for
them and epithets at the visitors.
Just make sure to keep it in rela
tively good taste. No incidents k la
Vernon Maxwell.
If all of this still has yet to con
vince you to show up, how about
this. If the team doesn't go to the
Big Dance, I don't get to go. Now,
will you go? Please?

Coach, I did my job to get students
to go. Now, just get us the win,
OK? Please?
