# Softball gears up for rematch with Bears
## 
### Jason Weintraub Contributing writer 
On Feb. 8, the Stanford soft
ball team traveled to Berkeley for
its first-ever Pacific 10 Confer
ence game. Stanford's inexperi
ence — the team is only in its sec
ond season as a varsity sport —
left the Cardinal overmatched
against the highly-touted Wee
nies. The Cardinal lost both
games of a doubleheader to the
Bears by scores of 4-1 and 11-1.
Today, Stanford seeks revenge as
the Bears invade the friendly con

fines of El Camino Field for a 1
p.m. doubleheader.
Stanford (8-8 overall, 0-2 in
the Pac-10) is hot of late, winning
three of its last four games and
four of its last six. As the team's
record suggests, the youthful
Cardinal has played inconsistent
ly this year, rarely excelling in all
phases of the game.
At times, however, the team
has shown flashes of brilliance,
mostly from the arm of freshman
pitcher Jessica Schulman and the
bat of sophomore shortstop Sum
mer Lee. In an up-and-down year,
Schulman and Lee have provided
some much-needed stability.
Schulman (5-3) improves with
each game she pitches. A shutout
against San Francisco State two
weeks ago and a solid perfor
mance against Loyola Mary
mount has lowered Schulman's
team-leading ERA to under 1.00.
"[Schulman has] been doing a
nice job of mixing up her pitches
and changing speeds," said Stan
ford head coach Sandy Pearce.
"We've been getting some excel
lent performances from her."
Leadoff hitter Lee has led the
Cardinal all year long, carrying a

lofty .550 batting average into
today's action. Lee's average has
increased since she was moved
into the leadoff spot three weeks
ago.
The lineup change has
strengthened an offense that
struggled early in the season.
Moving hot-hitting Amanda
Renteria, the club's sophomore
second baseman, down to the
ninth spot in the lineup has pro
tected Lee and caused her to see
better pitches. Lee's hitting, in
turn, brings fastballs to the mid
dle of the lineup.
"We're really hitting the ball
well lately," said Stanford assis
tant coach Andy Pearce. "We just
have to maintain that level [of
offense] throughout the game."
The key match-up for Stanford
against the Bears will be Berke
ley's high-octane offense against

the pitching of Schulman and
sophomore Angela Webb.
"The one thing we know about
Cal is that they usually score five
or six runs a game," Sandy Pearce
said. "On the flip side, we know
that teams have scored on them
this season. They win a lot of
games 6-5 and 4-3."
The Bears are just the begin
ning of a grueling Pac-10 schedule.
"The Pac-10 is by far the best
conference in the country," Andy
Pearce said. "Arizona and UCLA
are one and two, Cal is seventh,
and Washington is 23rd." Despite
these rankings, Stanford refuses
to be intimidated.
"Cal will be a good test for us,"
Schulman said. We gave them a
tough [first] game last time in
only our second game of the year.
We're a lot better than we were
then. "
