# California, Chico State can't deal with pressure
## Women's lacrosse cruises to two easy wins 
### Seth Goldstein Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's lacrosse team
hopes to breeze through its final examina
tions as easily as it handled California and
Chico State this past weekend. The Cardi
nal dismantled the Bears 18-1 on Satur
day and followed up with an encore per
formance, a 17-2 pounding of the Wild
cats.
Neither squad had been expected to
give Stanford a great deal of competition.
However, the final scores were still rather
surprising.
"I expected Berkeley to be much
tougher," said attack player Wendy Kula.
"They almost beat us last year and they
got a player from England who was sup
posed to cause problems for us this year."
It did not appear that the Old World
charm helped Cal at all, as the Cardinal
ran out to a large lead. The team never
afforded the Bears any chance with all
Stanford players getting into the act.
"We passed really well," Kula said.
"Goal distribution was really even. No one
player did everything. That's really char
acterized all our games this year."
California also suffered from severe
defensive lapses, as demonstrated by the
number of goals the Cardinal defensive
line scored. It is not very often that a line
player manages to cross the entire field
unaccosted to toss one into the opposi
tion's goal.
"They didn't have the game sense to
know what was going on," said junior
defensive player Hannah Flatau. "So I

just took advantage of that and left my
man. It's fun to play in games where you
get to do things you don't normally do."
Overall, the team's opinion of the Bears
was not very high.
"The Cal players could run really fast,
but they didn't look like they had any
skill," said senior midfielder Wendy Gold
en.
The Chico State contest was marred by
the rough and tumble tactics of a Wildcat
who took her frustration with her team's
play out on members of the Cardinal
squad.
"Honestly, there was something wrong
with her," Flatau said. "I came away with
an interception and she blind-sided me. As
I got up, I heard her laughing."
"Her teammates apologized to me, but
later, after I got called for an illegal check,
she said, 'You better stop or I'll trip your
ass again.' "
Despite the violent Chico approach to
the contest, Stanford ran out to an 11-1
halftime lead, prompting head coach Kay
Cowperthwait to order her players to play
opposite-handed in order to improve their
games.
The team will not see action again until
spring break, when it will travel to Florida
to battle powerful East Coast schools Har
vard and Middlebury.
"Last year, Middlebury beat us 12-1. I
think we'll be able to gauge how far we've
come over the past year when we look at
the score of this year's game," Flatau said.
"How we compare to the Eastern schools
will show us what to expect in the years to
come."
