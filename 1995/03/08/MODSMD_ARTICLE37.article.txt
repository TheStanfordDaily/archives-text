# Men's lacrosse on a roll after victories

With the playoffs looming right
around the corner, it finally
appears that the men's lacrosse
team has come together and is
peaking at the right time. Three
big wins during the last two weeks
against Claremont McKenna,
Chico State and, most impressive,
UCLA, have improved the team's
overall record to 5-3 after a slow
paced start.
"So far, we've been winning the
games we're supposed to win," said
coach Dan Williams. The 24-0
blowout of the University of Pacif
ic almost a month ago is a perfect
example.
"However, up to this point,
UCLA has really been the high
light of our season, in that we
really had to work to win,"
Williams added. "After the UCLA
game, the whole team's spirits got
up, and we knew that we accom
plished something very positive
with the win."
UCLA, a perennial powerhouse
in the Division One South bracket,
has always given Stanford prob
lems with its size. This time,
things were different as the Cardi
nal used its quickness to out-hustle
the larger Bruin squad on their
home field and come out with a
win.
One of the main reasons for the
team's newfound success is the
sense of leadership that has blos
somed in a few key players. Co-cap
tains senior Mike Todd and Matt
Jones have stepped up their games

and have provided the guidance
necessary with any young team.
"Both Mike and Matt have been
outstanding as far as leadership is
concerned," Williams said.
Another member of the team
that has proven vital to the team's
success is goalkeeper Dan Garza.
A first-year medical student,
Garza is playing out his final year
of eligibility. Both players and
coaches realize how valuable he is
to the team, as he can usually
make the difference between a win
or a loss.
"Even when we lose, Dan still
makes a difference. When we lost
to Santa Barbara 15-10, things
could have been a lot worse were it
not for Dan's great play," Williams
said.
The lacrosse team has two big
home games this week that can
make or break its playoff chances.
Today at 3:30 p.m. at Maloney
Field five, the team faces off
against St. Mary's, a local Division
One North opponent. This game
should provide the players with an
opportunity to sharpen up their
skills for their next big game on
Saturday against Whittier at 1
p.m.
"If we win these next two
games, we'll most likely advance to
the playoffs," Williams said.
After this week, the team has
almost a month-long break before
the next game. Two wins over the
next few days will definitely pro
vide a big boost going into the
break and coming back into the
homestretch of the season.
