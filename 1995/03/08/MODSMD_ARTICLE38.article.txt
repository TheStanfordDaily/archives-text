The Stanford polo team played UC-Davis in a
unique tournament this past weekend in Modesto,
Calif. The unusual match format began with three
chukkers of coed play followed up by four chukkers
of men's play, and concluded with another chukker
of coed play.
The scores from the coed play were tallied sepa
rately from the scores of the all-men's chukkers, but
neither result favored Stanford. The Cardinal men
lost 14-4 while the coed team fell 8-7.
"Because we were switching around five players,
it was hard to get into a rhythm," said junior Jeff
Heeder, captain of the men's team. In a normal
game, three players compete for the entire match of
four chukkers.
Against Davis, players rotated frequently. The
men's team of Heeder, sophomore Adam Strom,
junior Jason Knight and graduate students Vinod
Baya and Nico Luko substituted for each other a
creat deal.

Although Luko and Baya will not play in the
regionals, they were a positive influence this week
end. "It was good that Nico and Vinod played," said
Heeder. "Vinod's an excellent player, and it was an
opportunity [for the rest of the team] to learn."
Despite losing 14-4, the team felt good about the
game. We played better than we did two weeks ago
[also against Davis]," said Heeder. "There was one
blazing chukker where we won 3-1. If we can keep
up that style of play, we'll be tough to beat."
The coed team consisted of Luko, Baya, Strom,
freshman Alexa Christy and sophomore Courtney
Riggle. The squad was ahead after the first three
chukkers, but Davis overtook the Cardinal in the
final round. The coed play was interrupted by the
four chukkers of men's play, and this may have bro
ken their rhythm.
Luko, a graduate student in civil engineering,
made some observations about the team: "[The reg
ular roster players] definitely have a lot of skill and
know the game better than a lot of other teams. They
can do well, if they keep their heads in the game."
