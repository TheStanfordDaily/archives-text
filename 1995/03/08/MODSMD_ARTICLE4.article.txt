# News Service's Seawell dies
## 'Her elegant writing gave the paper class' 
### Jesse Oxfeld 
Mary Ann Seawell, a
writer and editor for the
Stanford News Service,
died of cancer on Saturday,
March 4. She was 53 years
old.
A Stanford alumna, Sea
well worked as a writer for
the Washington Post and as
a writer and columnist for
the Palo Alto Times (later

the Peninsula Times-Tribune) before re
turning to Stanford in her position with
News Service. Her colleagues both at News
Service and at the Times-Tribune praised
her writing abilities.
"Her elegant writing gave the paper class
and importance each time her work ap
peared," said Mary Madison, a colleague

from the Peninsula Times-Tribune, now a
freelance writer and a contributor to the San
Francisco Chronicle. "She wrote gracefully
and with wit... it was hard not to read every
word of every story she wrote."
"She had a wonderful wit and this came
through in her writing," commented Car
olyn Snyder, Seawell's supervisor at the
Times and now special sections editor at the
San Jose Mercury News. "She was very pro
fessional in everything she did."
Her colleagues from News Service echoed
these sentiments.
She had a "tremendous devotion to the
written word," as well as "an ability to take a
complicated story and do justice not just to
the research but also to the reader," said
Doug Foster, director of News Service.
"She did an excellent job of covering hu-


Seawell
manities at Stanford. She was
extremely hardworking, literary
and conscientious," said Bob Bey
ers, former director of News Ser
vice. "She did some very fme work
profiling people who had done
work in areas not usually covered
by the news media, such as litera
ture and the performing arts."
Snyder spoke of Seawell's
devotion to the woman's move
ment, saying that Seawell was
instrumental in changing that
paper's Women's Section to a
Lifestyle Section. "She was the
first woman I knew to wear a
pantsuit to work," remembered
Snyder.

Madison also spoke of Sea
well's advocacy for feminism,
mentioning that when well
known feminists came to the Bay
Area, Seawell was almost always
the first to interview them, writ
ing articles on Gloria Steinem,
Bella Abzug and Kate Millett.
Considered by her News Ser
vice colleagues to be am encyclope
dic resource on all sorts of facts,
Seawell was an avid reader, trav
eler and movie-goer. Few were
surprised when she won a trip to
Mexico on the television program
"Jeopardy!"
A San Francisco native, Sea
well graduated from Stanford in
1963 with a bachelor's degree in
communication. A memorial ser
vice for her will be held at 3 p.m.
on Friday, March 17, in Memorial
Church.
