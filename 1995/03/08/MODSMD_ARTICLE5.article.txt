# ASSU says University to fund SURE Escort
## Senate clears Russell, rules on sweatshirts 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate took a step toward in
creasing student safety last night when it
announced that the SURE Escort Service —
which is currently supported by a special fee
— will be funded by the University next
year, pending approval by the Board of
Trustees.
The meeting also saw the exoneration of
undergraduate senator Stephen Russell,
Students' Alliance and Associated Students
Consulting (ASC) over the ASK Stanford
publication controversy, as well as a deci
sion on the sweatshirt rule which assumes
that senators answering the roll call have
worn their senate sweatshirts all day.

The University was asked to fund the es
cort service in order to ensure its funding
each quarter, according to Council of Presi
dents member Vanessa Alvarado. "SURE
escort should have stable income," she said.
"SURE escort is very significant to cam
pus," Alvarado said. "SURE escort has con
tributed to safety that we have had at Stan
ford for the past years. A lot of people take
for it granted, but without it we would have
a huge gap in safety."
She said the fee-refund process has af
fected the escort service in the past. "SURE
has not been denied funding, but it has been
affected by the amount of refunds," Alvara
do said.
Currently the SURE special
fee totals $54,259.19, Alvarado
said. With the fee-refund buffer,
the special fee total is $72,648.69.
"These issues (of rape preven
tion) should not be left to the
whims of the special-fee process,"
said deputy senate chair Michael
Choo. "Providing for safety of stu
dents should be a central mission
of the University administration
and trustees."
If the administration funds
the escort service, each student
will save approximately $5, Choo
said.
Alvarado was confident that the
Board of Trustees would approve
funding for the escort service.
The issue of campus safety was
also addressed in a report written
by senate associate Bill Shen,
ASSU secretary Alane Murdock,
Choo and undergraduate senator
Nicole Vazquez.
The report calls for the installa
tion of campus phones in resi
dences and in public areas, aiming
to have a campus phone every 200

yards, Murdock said.
"Essentially there are two rea
sons for phones — personal safety
and preventing thefts and burglar
ies," Shen said. "The installation
of courtesy telephones will insure
student safety and insure the secu
rity of all campus residences."
The senate will vote on a bill to
endorse the recommendations at
its next meeting.
Additionally, a special legisla
tive committee formed a month
ago in response to a report by
ASSU Financial Manager Gabe
Lucas issued its final report which
cleared Russell, ASC and Stu
dents' Alliance of wrong-doing in
connection with ASK Stanford, a
publication of the Students'
Alliance.
Russell had been accused of
misrepresenting the intent of ASK
Stanford as a nonpartisan publica
tion in its mission statement to the
Pub Board, and of using his influ
ence as former Pub Board director
to obtain the board's funding for
the publication.
Russell was elated by his exon
eration, but said that felt that the
whole process had been a witch
hunt.
"I was investigated in the hope

that something might be found
that I did wrong," Russell said. "I
have been investigated for a
month in an abuse of power by a
few senators more concerned with
the fact that I attacked the bal
anced Funding Deal."
The committee's report criti
cized the listing of ASC under the
ASSU in the Stanford Directory.
In his defense, Russell, who was
the Directory's business manager,
said that listings was not his
responsibility, but that of the edi
tor-in-chief and the project manag
er of the Directory.
The report did find, however,
that Pub Board Director Danny
Bressler had violated the board's
by-laws in the funding interview
process, since only he and sopho
more Andre Vanier, currently the
Students' Alliance chair, were pre
sent during the interview for ASK
Stanford.
Bressler said that while the pro
cess is not perfect, it is acceptable.
"One member of the finance
committee did not show up,"
Bressler said. "We do the best we
can. In the past, there was no
finance committee — the Pub
Board director simply decided."
Bressler questioned the

hypocrisy of the senate, which he
said does not enforce its own
laws, and the objectivity of the
chair of the special legislative
committee.
"A senate which violates its
own constitution should not cast
stones," Bressler said, in reference
to the senate chair's suspension of
the senate sweatshirt rule last
week.
"The committee chair (gradu
ate senator Mike Bailey) also had
an interest in a publication
which did not receive (Pub
Board) funding," Bressler said,
alleging bias against him by the
committee.
The meeting also saw a final
ruling on the implementation of
the controversial sweatshirt rule
by Senate Chair Nawwar Kasrawi,
who suspended the rule last week.
The rule prohibits senators who
have not worn their sweatshirts all
day from voting.
"The best way to deal with
enforcement is to make it contin
gent on adherence to the Funda
mental Standard," Kasrawi said.
"When you say you are present
you are saying that you have met
the requirements. It will be up to
the honor of each senator."

week.
"The committee chair (gradu
ate senator Mike Bailey) also had
an interest in a publication
which did not receive (Pub
Board) funding," Bressler said,
alleging bias against him by the
committee.
The meeting also saw a final
ruling on the implementation of
the controversial sweatshirt rule
by Senate Chair Nawwar Kasrawi,
who suspended the rule last week.
The rule prohibits senators who
have not worn their sweatshirts all
day from voting.
"The best way to deal with
enforcement is to make it contin
gent on adherence to the Funda
mental Standard," Kasrawi said.
"When you say you are present
you are saying that you have met
the requirements. It will be up to
the honor of each senator."
