# ASSU says University to fund SURE Escort
## Senate clears Russell, rules on sweatshirts 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate took a step toward in
creasing student safety last night when it
announced that the SURE Escort Service —
which is currently supported by a special fee
— will be funded by the University next
year, pending approval by the Board of
Trustees.
The meeting also saw the exoneration of
undergraduate senator Stephen Russell,
Students' Alliance and Associated Students
Consulting (ASC) over the ASK Stanford
publication controversy, as well as a deci
sion on the sweatshirt rule which assumes
that senators answering the roll call have
worn their senate sweatshirts all day.

The University was asked to fund the es
cort service in order to ensure its funding
each quarter, according to Council of Presi
dents member Vanessa Alvarado. "SURE
escort should have stable income," she said.
"SURE escort is very significant to cam
pus," Alvarado said. "SURE escort has con
tributed to safety that we have had at Stan
ford for the past years. A lot of people take
for it granted, but without it we would have
a huge gap in safety."
She said the fee-refund process has af
fected the escort service in the past. "SURE
has not been denied funding, but it has been
affected by the amount of refunds," Alvara
do said.
