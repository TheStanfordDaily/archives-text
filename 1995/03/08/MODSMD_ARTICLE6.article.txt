# Lack of accountability leads to loss of money
## Senate denies Pub Board new equipment funding 
### September Trevi√±o Staff writer 
A bill that would have allocated more
than $10,000 to the Publications Board to
purchase computer equipment failed in the
ASSU Senate last night by a margin of near
ly 2-1.
"The bill was important for the contin
ued growth of the Publications Board," said
Pub Board Director Danny Bressler, a co
author of the bill. "What I really wanted to
do was help student publications to publish
and . . . build a publishing community."
The Senate bill proposed to transfer
funds from the Pub Board reserves to its
funded account to purchase $8,460 worth of
new computers and accessories, such as
hard disks and keyboards. The bill would
also transfer $1,750 to fund discretionary
computer hardware, maintenance and facil
ities improvements.
According to the senate proposal, au

thored by Bressler and undergraduate sena
tor Andr6 Vanier, the extra funds would
allow the Pub Board to purchase a World
Wide Web server and an extra layout sta
tion. The Pub Board would also apply the
money toward such discretionary costs as
toner, software and phone lines. The budget
currently allots $500 for discretionary
spending, Bressler said.
The Pub Board proposal faced heated op
position on the senate floor. ASSU Finan
cial Manager Gabe Lucas expressed concern
over past equipment expenses, suggesting
that the Pub Board may be mismanaging
funds.
According to Lucas, the Pub Board has
spent more than $53,000 within the last
three years, a figure he said has not been
matched by any other ASSU department
even over the past five years. He opposed ap
proval of the bill, citing lack of "proper fiscal
management and a coherent
long-term spending plan."
Graduate senator Donald
Aingworth also voiced some
objections to the bill. "They
haven't clearly established that
they need an extra $10,000 worth
of computers," he said, suggest
ing that some of the requests
made in the proposal could have
been consolidateid with the com
puter needs of other ASSU com
ponents.
Bressler, however, rejected
the senators' arguments about
accountability. "The bill item
ized expenditure and how
money would be spent. What

more could they ask for?" he
said.
"It surprises me that the bill
was amended to put checks and
balances in place ... and it still
failed," Bressler said. "It makes
me wonder what checks they
were after."
The members initially voted to
postpone the bill indefinitely, but
after hearing an objection from
Vanier, accepted a motion to
reconsider, which put the bill
back on the agenda.
Two amendments were
attached to the bill to address the
issue of accountability, but the
Senate defeated the bill anyway,
by a margin of 9-4.
Although the proposal failed,
Bressler isn't giving up hope. "I
plan to try again next year and I'll
keep trying," he said.
