# 'For me, life becomes real when I write it.'
## Allende speaks on fiction, life 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
While working with learning-disabled children in
Venezuela in the 19705, author Isabel Allende once
collapsed after trying unsuccessfully to calm the
children, saved only by a woman who came in to
clean the room.
"She said, 'Once upon a time.." Allende said.
"She had them. The horrible creatures sat down in
silence as she started to tell a story. That day I de
cided I wanted that power. 'Once upon a time.."
Allende, author of the best-selling books "The
House of the Spirits" and"The Infinite Plan," dis
cussed the meaning and implications of that power
before a crowd of about 1,200 at Memorial Auditori
um last night.
Writing fiction, she said, is about allowing the
reader to enter another dimension. "As a species, we
need stories to deal with the collective spirit," Al
lende said.
Allende began writing fiction in 1981 while exiled
from her native Chile after the military overthrow
of her uncle, former Chilean President Salvador Al
lende.
Salvador Allende was the only member of her fa
ther's family she was close with, Allende said, and
his assassination in the coup "changed me com
pletely."
"I realized for the first time that there is a di
mension of violence always present in our lives," she
said. "I think in many ways it triggered my writing,"
by subjecting her to solitude and the "desire to re
build the spirit I had lost."
Just as the events in Chile in the 1970s led even
tually to "The House of the Spirits," each of her
books is connected to her life, Allende said.
"It seems that everything I write corresponds to
a moment of my life, to a feeling," she said after her
speech.
"The House of the Spirits" grew out of homesick
ness, she said, while her second novel, "Of Love and
Shadows," was an angry response to dictatorships
in Latin America. "Eva Luna" came from Allende's

acceptance of herself as a woman,
and"The Infinite Plan," based on
the true story of her husband's
life, describes her reaction to
"moving to the United States and
following the man I loved," she
said.
Allende read from two chap
ters of her next work, "Paula," a
memoir about her struggles dur
ing her daughter Paula's recent
illness and death.
The book, which will be pub
lished in the United States in a
few weeks, is a "tragic story of the
untimely death of a young
woman, and it's a celebration of
life," she said.
Weaving together her daugh
ter's death and her future,
Allende explained that while
Paula was in a coma, "slowly, I
learned to see the patterns of
existence and ask myself all the
fundamental questions."
During her daughter's illness,
Allende said, she wrote 190 let
ters to her mother explaining the
emotional changes she went
through, while also making notes
on a yellow pad.
"I wrote to distract death," she
said. "I wrote to escape from mad
ness. In this way, word by word,
tear by tear, this book was writ
ten."
Allende read a humorous
account of her childhood trips to
boxing matches with her uncle,
switching mood in a reading from
the book's final chapter that
described the emotions that arose
from illness and death.
"Recently I have been empty,"
she read. "Ever since you've been
ill, Paula, a dark curtain has sep
arated me from the fantasy world
in which I moved so freely."
Until her daughter's illness
struck, Allende read, "I had lived
in action and struggle. . . . Now I
was forced to inaction and
silence."
But the silence allowed her to
re-examine her life, Allende said.
"Paula gave me silence to return
to my path in the world," she
read. "Absent, mute, paralyzed,
my daughter was my guide."
Since Paula's death, Allende
said she hasn't written any fiction
and doesn't know if she will
return to the form she took up
after beginning her career in jour
nalism.
But writing still remains an
important form of expression, she
said.
"I forget a lot. My mind
betrays me," Allende said. "For
me, life becomes real when I write
it."
