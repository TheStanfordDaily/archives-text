# 'For me, life becomes real when I write it.'
## Allende speaks on fiction, life 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
While working with learning-disabled children in
Venezuela in the 19705, author Isabel Allende once
collapsed after trying unsuccessfully to calm the
children, saved only by a woman who came in to
clean the room.
"She said, 'Once upon a time.." Allende said.
"She had them. The horrible creatures sat down in
silence as she started to tell a story. That day I de

of her uncle, former Chilean President Salvador Al

said. "I think in many ways it triggered my writing,"
by subjecting her to solitude and the "desire to re
build the spirit I had lost."
Just as the events in Chile in the 1970s led even
tually to "The House of the Spirits," each of her
books is connected to her life, Allende said.
"It seems that everything I write corresponds to
a moment of my life, to a feeling," she said after her
speech.
"The House of the Spirits" grew out of homesick
ness, she said, while her second novel, "Of Love and
Shadows," was an angry response to dictatorships
in Latin America. "Eva Luna" came from Allende's
