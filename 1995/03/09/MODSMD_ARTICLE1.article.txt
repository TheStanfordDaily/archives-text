# Assault coalition regroups
## 
### Beth Berselli Editorial staff 
After a year of relative inactiv
ity, the Coalition Against Sexual
Assault is attempting to restruc
ture and revitalize Stanford's
student-run prevention and edu
cation program by hosting a re
treat this Saturday.
Senior Jeff Cory, a coalition
member, said that at the retreat
he will present a plan for poten
tially restructuring the coalition
in such a way to make it a "cohe
sive, centralized whole, rather
then a separate, spread-out
structure."
Currently, the coalition serves
as an umbrella organization over
a number of student prevention
education groups, including the
Rape Education Project, Greek
Rap, the Stanford Men's Collec
tive and Project Heighten Educa
tion on Acquaintance Rape
(HEAR).
However, while these different
groups "are hypothetically under
the coalition, in reality they don't
have anythingto do with it," Cory
said. For example, members of
the various groups "rarely have
any contact with each other" and
"there is not a sense of the coali
tion as a unified whole."
Cory said his plan — which he
admits is "malleable" and open to
suggestions — would clarify the
coalition's role as a true umbrella
organization. "Now the other
groups really would be a part of
the coalition," he said. "Whereas
before people would identify more
with the individual groups, under
the new structure you would be
first and foremost a coalition
member."
The different student groups
will not be dissolved, but will
operate under the coalition's lead
ership and coordination, Cory
said. He added that he envisions
the coalition's new structure as

similar to the Bridge and its vari
ous subcommittees.
These structural changes will
hopefully resolve previous prob
lems with the coalition's opera
tion, Cory said.
In the past, the decentralized
structure of the coalition has
caused confusion, culminating in
last spring's loss of special-fee
funding for both the coalition and
the Rape Education Project.
Last spring, the coalition
requested $55,731 in special-fee
funding to pay for the position of
sexual assault prevention educa
tor, the Sexual Assault Resource
Center in Cowell Student Health

Center and campus education
programs, including the Orienta
tion program "Sex in the '905."
Even though 55 percent of stu
dents voted for the funding, the
fee was denied because the coali
tion's "yes" vote did not reach the
required level of 15 percent of the
student body.
The Rape Education Project —
which sponsored Rape Awareness
Week — was also denied its
request for special-fee funding
last spring.
As a result of the loss of special
fee funding last spring and other
internal organizational problems,
the coalition has been dormant so
far this year, Cory said.
"People were confused about
where their special-fee money was
going," Cory said. "It was not
clear that the coalition was an
umbrella organization for the
other student groups."
In addition, by unifying all of
the separate student groups
under the coalition, students will
be provided with a base level of

training, Cory said.
Sexual Assault Prevention
Coordinator Sally Baird said she

is willing to
coordinate this
training, which
she says will
provide stu
dents with "a
foundation of
necessary infor
mation."
Baird, who
started her job

early this quarter, said she is
excited about the restructuring
possibilities.
"Given the uncertainty of the
times, we're looking to create
more cohesive, streamlined pro
gramming," Baird said. She
added that Cory's plan for
restructuring the coalition will
not only "make it clearer what the
organization is" but also clarify
for students how to join sexual
assault prevention education pro
grams.
"A lot of people want to get

involved with sexual assault pre
vention but don't necessarily
know how to," said senior Vir
ginia Duplessis, a coalition mem
ber. "The restructuring should
hopefully clarify that for them."
Also at Saturday's retreat,
coalition members say they hope
to garner the "people-power" nec
essary to keep the student pro
gram alive and active in future
years, especially considering that
many coalition members are grad
uating this spring.
"We just need to get our
momentum built up again, and
hopefully the retreat will accom
plish this," Duplessis said.
The coalition has suffered
from a lack of student involve
ment this year, Cory said.
"We've had a strong attrition
of people who, for whatever rea
son, aren't as involved with the
coalition as they were last year,"
he said.
In addition, coalition members
say they hope the retreat will
allow them to get input from a

wide variety of communities on
campus.
"We want to try to get a sense
from people in different commu
nities what their needs in sexual
assault prevention education
are," Cory said.
In hopes of accomplishing this
goal, the coalition has invited rep
resentatives from a wide variety
of groups on campus, including
sororities, the Women's Center,
the Athletic Department and the
ASSU. Baird said she has received
about 15 replies for the weekend
event already.
Baird added, however, that
students don't need to belong to a
specific group in order to come to
Saturday's event. "You can just
come and represent yourself," she
said.
The retreat will be held in
Manzanita Dining Room from
noon to 4 p.m. on Saturday. Stu
dents can go to the Health Aware
ness Fair in White Plaza tomor
row to obtain more information
about the retreat.
