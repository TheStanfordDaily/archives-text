# Earth sciences class gets real world focus
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Contributing writer 
Stanford undergraduates sometimes com
plain the classes they take have no relevance
outside academia.
But starting this spring quarter, the Depart
ment of Earth Sciences will offer a new class
integrating aspects of economics, engineering
and conservation for use in"the real world."
What makes this class unique is that it was
the result of student and faculty cooperation.
Students in Earth Systems 10 urged their
instructor, Biology Prof. Stephen Schneider, to
take his teachings further, applying them to
Stanford in a practical manner.
As a result of his students' encouragement,
Schneider will teach next quarter a course
titled, "Energy Systems: Achieving Energy
Efficiency in the Real World."
Schneider said the class will offer students a
well-rounded curriculum by having them
design projects and make recommendations
that can be implemented at low cost, saving
money through energy efficiency.
"It gives the students a chance to get their
hands dirty and focuses on existing solutions to
gain energy efficiency," he said.

Eric Selmon, an engineering coterminal stu
dent who helped to create the class, said there
are few classes in Earth Sciences that give stu
dents the opportunity to put their theories and
recommendations to use. Selmon added that he
hopes the course will provide a forum for
exchanging ideas.
"The centerpiece of the class will be students
doing projects analyzing the problems and
obstacles of implementing cost-effective energy
conservation measures," he said.
In addition to the term project, students will
hear lectures from a variety of faculty and pri
vate-sector members who are familiar with the
subject.
"The class takes on aspects of economics,
engineering, public policy, sociology and psy
chology," said Selmon. "It's definitely an inter
disciplinary class," he added.
Among the "real world" lecturers that stu
dents will hear is Stanford Utilities Manager
Kathleen Cruise.
Schneider recalled how one simple idea for
saving energy and money came from an experi
ence he had while having lunch at Tresidder
Union.
"There we were, having lunch right after a
class on energy efficiency, and we were eating

under inefficient incandescent bulbs," he said.
Schneider said he thought it would be easy
for maintenance personnel to use energy-effi
cient compact fluorescent bulbs. Although they
would cost slightly more, they would have
resulted in long-term efficiency savings, he
said.

"It gives stundents a chance to
get their hands dirty and focus
es 0n... energy efficiency."

"Students in my Earth Systems 10 class
came up with a variety of reasons why such a
simple solution wasn't so easily implemented
— everything from the new bulbs didn't look
'homey' to poor communication between
administrators and maintenance personnel,"
Schneider said.
"When you have a truck full of incandes
cents, you're not going to go out of your way to
get a compact fluorescent," Schneider said.
