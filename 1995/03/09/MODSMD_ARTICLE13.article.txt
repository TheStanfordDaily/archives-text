GOP senator won't be punished
WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republicans
decided yesterday to spare Sen. Mark Hatfield
from punishment for casting the decisive "no"
vote on the balanced-budget amendment, a top
GOP priority.
"No action was taken on any resolution to
remove Mark Hatfield as chairman of his commit
tee. No such proposal was made by any member of
the conference," said Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss.,
the No. 3 GOP leader in the Senate.
Hatfield, of Oregon, chairs the Appropriations
Committee.
But the drive ebbed as Hatfield's colleagues —
not all of them party-line voters themselves —
began defending his right to stand on his princi
ples. In the end, venting overtook vengeance at
the private session forced by those seeking to pun
ish him.

The effort to exact a price from Hatfield was led
by Sens. Connie Mack, R-Fla., and Rick Santo
rum, R-Pa.
Two killed in Pakistan
KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) - Two U.S. Con
sulate employees were killed and another injured
yesterday following a terrorist shooting in the
streets of Karachi.
No one claimed responsibility for yesterday's
attack, which Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto called "part of a well-planned campaign of
terrorism." Nor was the motive clear.
Jackie Van Landingham, 33, a secretary from
Camden, S.C., and Gary C. Durell, 45, a commu
nications technician from Alliance, Ohio, were
killed. U.S. officials said Mark McCloy, 31, a
postal worker from Framingham, Mass., was in
stable condition.
