# Dollar stabilizes after decline

WASHINGTON (AP) - The
plummeting dollar stabilized yes
terday after Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan called
the decline unwarranted and
sought to stiffen Congress'
resolve to attack the federal bud
get deficit.
After going into a near free-fall
for four straight days, setting
record lows against the German
mark and the Japanese yen, the
dollar rebounded following
Greenspan's testimony.
Some economists viewed this
as a signal that the latest crisis is
over. Others cautioned that the
dollar is likely to remain under
downward pressure because of
worries over the soaring U.S.
trade imbalance, economic chaos
in Mexico and the uncontrolled
federal budget deficit.

"I don't think the dollar is out
of the woods. It remains quite vul
nerable," said Allen Sinai, chief
economist at Lehman Brothers
Global Economics in New York.
Testifying before the House
Budget Committee, Greenspan
called the recent decline in the
dollar "very likely overdone" and
decried it as "both unwelcome
and troublesome."
He said the weakness pointed
to "underlying problems con
fronting the longer-term health of
the economy: inadequate national
savings, continuing large budget
deficits and a persistent current
account (trade) imbalance."
Many economists noted that
Greenspan's carefully chosen
words promised no specific action
on the part of the central bank to
fight off currency speculators.

But he did seek to undo dam
age ascribed to his testimony two
weeks ago, which was widely
viewed by currency markets as
signaling the central bank was
finished raising interest rates and
might even consider some rate
reductions if the economy slowed
too much.
Greenspan said he found the
market's interpretation of his
previous comments "a little bit
startling. It led me to conclude
that Fed-speak may be more
obscure than it should be at cer
tain times."
That comment soothed curren
cy traders, who had worried that
lower interest rates in the United
States could push the dollar down
as foreign investors bailed out of
dollar-denominated investments
in search of higher yields.
