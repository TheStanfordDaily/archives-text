## Change from inside 
### 
For those of you who
may not know, ASSU stands
for Associated Students of
Stanford University. That's associ
ated, as in all of us together. That's
students, as in you.
The trouble is, the people who
end up running the ASSU tend to

be the same sort of folk,
year after year. It's not that
they're a bad sort, neces
sarily. It's just that it
doesn't lead to a lot of
diversity.
Fortunately, you have a
chance to change all that.
You — any of you stu
dents, graduate or under

graduate — can run to be an ASSU
senator, a member of the Council
of Presidents or a member of the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council (a judicial body that hasn't
met in years). Freshmen, sopho
mores and juniors can also run to
be a class president next year.
All you have to do to run is

attend a meeting tonight at 10
p.m. in the Cypress Room on the
second floor of Tresidder. Then, by
tomorrow at 4 p.m., you have to
have all your campaign forms
turned in to the ASSU office.
How do you know if you're qual
ified? All you need is a little time,

intelligence and the desire to
make Stanford a better
place. You don't need a life
time of shaking hands or
kissing babies. You don't
even need a cool name like
Rupali or Phil Lin (although
it never hurts in the senate
race).
Ah, but we hear the

naysayers: "So what? The ASSU is
nothing but a group of self-impor
tant nabobs. All they ever do is
talk." Well, here's your chance to
do something about it. If you're
unhappy with the status quo, the
way to change is from the inside.
So run, baby, run, before your
whining rights are removed.
