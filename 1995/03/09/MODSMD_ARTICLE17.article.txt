# Don't review Hoover
## 
### 
RECENTLY, Profs. Ronald
Rebholz and John Manley
called on University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper to form a
committee to investigate and
review the Hoover Institution's
independent status. Why? Because
Hoover Director John Raisian was

quoted in the San Francisco
Chronicle as saying that the
think tank tends to favor
conservative ideals and that
people with differing views
do not fit in well at Hoover.
Hardly an earth-shatter
ing revelation, this com
ment does not warrant a

review committee investigation.
It's hard to imagine a depart
ment receiving the same backlash
for helping more liberal causes.
Rebholz claims that Hoover's
"partisan political activities such
as research and advice" have
helped GOP electoral advances. He
cites the "Contract With America"
and tax policy recommendations to

Gov. Pete Wilson as examples. In
theory, however, any time Stanford
advises the government, it is
potentially helping the politician
who uses the advice.
Besides, this campus already has
too many committees. Every time
anything happens, Stanford forms

a new one. We even have a
committee on committees.
Not all are bad — indeed,
some are useful — but there
must be moderation. We
need to be suspicious of more
and bigger committees. Peo
ple who look to the commit

tee to solve problems are not
the type who will fit well with this
needed mindset.
Raisian's comments do raise
concern. But we cannot look at
Hoover in a vacuum — if we want
to take up this issue at all, we
should look at the overall level of
political involvement that has
almost become expected at promi
nent national universities.
