# Julie Cantor
## And here's your host... 
### 
I HAVE THIS need for fame. Natural
ly, it's not my fault. It's my mom's.
Whatever I did got a "Yay for baby
Julie" response from my parents. And
when eating, breathing, and everything
else you do elicits claps and smiles, you
never want the attention to end. Why
give up the personal cheering section?
That's all celebrity is anyway. Aver
age boobs burying themselves in People
magazine, following your life and cheer
ing.
Want in? Of course they'll watch you,
too. And you might not even need a
Greek goddess bod if there's some other
redeeming quality you offer.
Like the talk show hosts. You can't
tell me that any one of them has a great
body. But they're on TV, and by defini
tion, TV people's lives are just more
interesting than our own.
And these days, everyone has a talk
show. Look what that Donahue started.
Vanessa Huxtable's in (guess she didn't
get on the compelling "Cosby Myster
ies"). Andrea's making the move from
"90210." Thank God daddy didn't buy
Tori one. Yet.
Well, damn, I want my own show too.
Not just your typical daytime show that
reaches new lows of stupidity every day.
An intelligent one.
See, I want to be like Ted. But with
good hair. I just need a station to throw
an hour and an audience my way.
How hard can it be? Read the card,

state the problem and you're off. As long
as I don't have to get fat two or three
times, I'll do it. Well, maybe I'd get fat
once.
So you need to casually cut to com
mercial. Big deal. I'm sure at some point
I've said to someone in hysterics, "I'd
love to hear this, but right now I've got
to pee. Be back in a sec." Same differ
ence.
But I've got a name problem. It's not
catchy enough. Just Julie won't win rat
ings. Gerry sold out to Geraldo, Ricki's
got that 'i.' That'll leave me changing
my name altogether:
"Hi, and welcome back to The
Junipero Serra Show."
Or maybe the "line" motif — "Night
line," "Dateline," "Frontline" — I could
do "Noonline," "Borderline," or just
plain "Line."
Still, if you think about it, American
culture must look so pathetic from over
seas. Tweak the satellite to another
seemingly undisturbing tale of molested
transvestites who marry their social
workers after another face-lift. We
entertain the world like a bunch of ego
tistical freaks with all our soul-baring
nakedness. And we don't even try.
The typical talk show is indicative of
our wackiness. The pathos is that we
need the bizarre forums to talk. People
will divulge to Jenny or banter with
Sally — and a few million of their closest
friends — but not with each other.

Oprah got the Virgin Michael to be a
poster child for True Love Waits. Bar
bara coddled Greg into admitting that
he has AIDS. And everyday, average
folks scream about the problems that
have been festering for years. These
days, that's what it takes.
It's group therapy to an extreme,
with everyone watching and empathiz
ing. Or laughing. Unless, of course, it's a
smart show. Like mine.
It may be a childhood leftover that I
was supposed to grow out of three devel
opmental stages ago, but it's the brush
with those elusive 15 minutes that still
grabs me. Fame is a matter of place and
time, like a communicable disease. A
gonorrhea of sorts, except you want it,
and it's more fun. Magazine covers,
flirting with "Late Show" appearances,
whining about how you want privacy.
And with all the fanaticism outside of
that L.A. court room — the T-shirts, the
made-for-TV movie, the stupid board
game — it sure doesn't deter anyone out
there who's clawing at fame from think
ing about committing something gory.
A talk show is just a whole lot neater.

Tom Brokaw didn't invite Julie to
lunch when he was here. It was a three
Prozac moment, but today she's doing
just fine.
