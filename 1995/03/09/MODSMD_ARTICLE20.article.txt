Appeal speech code decision to prevent harassment

THIS LETTER is in response to the
article regarding Stanford's
speech code being struck down in
Santa Clara County Superior Court. As
concerned black students on campus, we
feel that this decision has infringed
upon the rights of students to have
recourse in cases of verbal harassment
on the basis of race, sex or national ori
gin.
Promoting the concept of freedom of
speech is a noble cause; however, when

it comes at the expense of individual's
rights to live in an environment that is
free of overt racial hostility, it must be
limited. Verbal harassment cannot be
shrouded in a gauze of intellectual dis
course. We fail to see exactly what type
of free speech is being sought by the
plaintiffs. We are not attempting to sti
fle intellectual discussion, discourse or
dialogue of any sort. However there is
no intellectual knowledge to be gained
from a personal assault based on "sex,

race, color, handicap, religion, sexual
orientation, or national and ethnic ori
gin.
The absence of legal appeal in
response to these slanders will cause
Stanford to become a hostile environ
ment for anyone who fits into the afore
mentioned categories. How many Keith
Raboises or Ujamaa flier incidents will
occur now that there are no barriers to
prevent this kind of senseless activity?
We demand that the University

appeal this court ruling and find an
alternative policy to replace the code in
the meantime. We cannot allow hatred
to manifest itself in personal attacks
and vilifications without legal recourse.
