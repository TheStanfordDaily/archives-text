# Raisian is building an expensive bureaucracy at Hoover Institution
## 
### 
The Daily's story "Cutbacks at
Hoover" is in my opinion the best
story written yet.
If John Raisian wants to play the
game of who raised how much
money, he might go back to academic
year 1978-79 when my colleagues
and I raised $12.5 million, which in
real terms is probably greater than
the total amount he has raised in the
last five years.
For the fiscal year 1994-95, devel
opment expenditures are projected

at $933,000, or five percent, and
administration expenditures are pro
jected at $1,243,000, or seven per
cent, making a total of $2,176,000,
or 12 percent of total outlays. If
gifts for 1994-95 reach $6 million
instead of the $5.7 million which
was raised in 1993-94, this will
mean that well over one-third of the
gift total will be spent for an ever
growing bureaucracy in fundraising
and administration. Even if gifts
reach $7 million the total would still
be almost one-third of the projected
expenditure total.
One thing John Raisian cannot
deny viz he is building a large
bureaucracy, irrespective of whether
it is productive or not!
