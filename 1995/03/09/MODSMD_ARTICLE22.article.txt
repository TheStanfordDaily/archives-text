# Professor Kennedy is still embracing ideas of student censorship
## 
### 
I am pleased to see that Prof. Don
ald Kennedy takes my criticism of his
record seriously enough to respond
with alacrity. I shall not follow his
example of ad hominem argument. I
wish simply to point out that his self
defense is both partial and disingenu
ous.
Kennedy begins by acquitting him
self of a charge which was never made
â€” namely, calling for a judicial appeal
He then goes on to support the notion
that the University "stay with the
[language of the Grey Interpretation]

as a community standard." The dis
tinction between a "University com
munity standard" of speech censored
by the Stanford community and a Uni
versity fundamental standard which
includes censorship and sanctions, is
gray (Grey?) indeed.
But perhaps Kennedy meant well.
If he is saying merely that rude
speech on our campus deserves a
prompt verbal rebuke from one's
auditors, then we are in agreement.
But if he is again embracing censor
ship and official sanctions, as he
acknowledges he did while chair of
the Student Conduct Legislative
Council,, then we are not, and his
(uncensored) speech will continue to
burden us all.
