## Wednesday night at 'the Nose' — no wristband required 
### 
OXFORD, ENGLAND
IT IS A LITTLE past 10 p.m., and the
patrons of the Brasenose College Bar
are just beginning to filter in. The
Nose, as regulars affectionately call it, is
a bright, cavernous place located
beneath the college's inner quad. The
vaulted ceilings and long wood benches
make the bar seem as appropriate for
monastic discourse as merry drunken
ness. Things will remain relatively
sedate until just before last call, and in
the meantime, there is enough room to
stretch out and chat and leisurely sip a
few pints of dark English beer.
Surroundings aren't all that differen
tiate the Nose from the average Ameri
can watering hole. For one, the clientele
is young and fresh-faced; many would be
turned away at the Goose, even with a
passable ID. The noise rarely rises above
a mild din, despite the strains of British
glam-pop pulsating in the background.
Most strikingly, though, the Nose brims
with life even on this generally cold and
quiet Wednesday evening, with more
than a few students stopping in for a
drink — or three — after time well
spent "mugging" for upcoming exams.

And so it goes throughout this
revered bastion of thought, where the
only drafts students seem to work on
are the ones with thick, foamy heads. At
Oxford, students need not roam far for
alcohol, as each college has its own
Nose, most complete with recreational
essentials like foosball and darts and
jukeboxes, and all stocked with enough
alcohol to satisfy the most red-nosed of
budding teetotalers. Take your average
fraternity party, subtract the sweat and
lines for beer, put one in every campus
dorm and open it up for customers, and
you get an idea of what goes on as soon
as the dining halls close in Oxford. And
you don't have to wait for Thursday
night.
Forget the black gowns and dinner
jackets, the manicured lawns and crew
congested River Thames, the intellectu
al pretensions and the American pre
tenders. It's all a front. The thing that
stirs Oxford's drink is, to be frank,
drink. Sure, everyone consumes legally,
and unlike at Sigma Chi, a little plastic
wristband doesn't get you free beer. But
the stuff is still everywhere. At
Brasenose, students can pay a pound
and order a cold one, served in sterling

silver tankards, to accompany their
meals in the college dining hall. The
most pampered members of Oxford col
leges are the professors, who customari
ly sip sherry before emerging for supper
at the formal dining time, then retire to
a "smoking" room to throw back a few
more glasses of port. The nightly rendi
tions here of "Singing in the Rain" belt
ed out by revelers, returning home from
the bar or some other debaucherous
locale, would make the Three Tenors
blush.
Unadulterated hedonism seems to
infect everyone, including the stiffest,
most straight-laced graduate students.
Several weeks ago, a friend invited me
to dinner at New College. It was a
"guest" meal, and most of the diners
were graduates, mulling over disserta
tions and job interviews. After the meal
we adjourned to the Senior Commons
Room, a rather drab excuse for a dorm
lounge. I noticed that the British stu
dents huddled together in circle, while
the Americans stood and talked, but
everyone seemed to be waiting for some
thing. Within minutes, a bowl of ice,
some plastic cups and several bottles of
hard alcohol appeared on the counter. It

didn't take long for everyone to pour
themselves a few gin and tonics, and I
left before the Rhodes Scholars tried to
challenge their British counterparts in
quarters.
Most Americans, though, find the
whole scene a little overwhelming, and
even the stoutest Stanford livers would
have a hard time matching English con
sumption, pint for malted pint. It's
understandable. While 18-year-old
Oxford freshers descend to the bar for
lagers on Tuesday night, American uni
versities fret about the purportedly
"new" scourge of weekend binge drink
ing. And well they should. People, espe
cially college students, do silly and dan
gerous things when they drink. They get
behind steering wheels. They compro
mise themselves and each other. They
defame public art.
But the solution, it seems, is not for
Stanford administrators to assume a
position of in loco parentis. Perhaps
Oxford can provide help. That doesn't
mean opening a bar at Stern Late Night,
but it might mean an honest acceptance
of alcohol as a part — not an integral
part, but an undeniable one — of under
graduate life that needs to be moderat-

Ed, not prohibited. True, the average
Oxford student is likely to consume a
fair amount of alcohol during a given
week. It is altogether unlikely, however,
that all, or even most, of that alcohol
would be consumed in one 20-minute
pound-fest. It comes down to maturity,
in the end, and while they may get a lit
tle red in the face, Oxford students cer
tainly don't play drinking games.
And why does "having a few" have to
mean imbibing until the keg is empty?
At the Nose, the taps shut off at 11
p.m., and the college's junior dean —
fittingly, an American — cheerily
directs people to the door. The early
closing time elicits hardly a whimper.
The students empty their glasses,
linger a bit and then head out, perhaps
for a chicken kebab, or back to the
library, or even to bed. It is Wednesday
night, after all. Tomorrow will be here
soon enough.
