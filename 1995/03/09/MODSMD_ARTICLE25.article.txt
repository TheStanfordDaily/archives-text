## Men's basketball season reaches boiling point Cardinal squad needs victory over Cougars to keep NCAA tournament dreams alive 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
After four months on the practice floor, two exhi
bition contests and 25 regular season games, it all
boils down to this. For the Stanford men's basketball
team, the next three days will determine whether or
not the season was successful. Throw everything
else out the window, because it's all on the line now.
All of it.
It's all about that treasured NCAA tournament
berth that the Cardinal has chased all season long.
Just one week ago, it seemed as certain as sunrise
that Stanford was in. The team was sitting pretty
with a national ranking and vying for a possible
third place in the Pacific 10 Conference.
All that has changed now. After a disastrous road
trip to Oregon, the Cardinal finds itself unranked in
the Associated Press poll for the first time in over
eight weeks, and — more important — Stanford has
now dropped to sixth in the Pac-10 and is, as they
say, "on the bubble." That means the final judge
ment on the men's season is on the bubble as well.
"It would be a big disappointment if we didn't
make the tournament," said Stanford guard Dion
Cross. "It's like everything we've worked for [would
be] irrelevant. [The tournament] is what we've
worked for."
Stanford (17-8 overall, 8-8 in the Pac-10) is on the
wrong side of the tournament looking in. The key to
opening that gateway to the promised land resides in
the next two games versus Washington State and
Washington.
"Everybody knows the situation that we're in,"
said Cardinal point guard Brevin Knight. "We know
we have to win two in order to make it to the NCAAs.
I think that's what we'll go out and do. Our people
are really focused towards that, and that's the job we
have to take care of."
When asked the questions of whether or not his
team had to sweep, Cardinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery replied with an adamant "absolutely."
"We have to win some games," Montgomery said.
"I don't really care what everybody else does, but we

need to win some games."
Washington State (15-10, 9-7 in the Pac-10),
which the Cardinal faces tonight, is the bigger hur
dle of the two. This is the same Cougar team that
handed Stanford its first loss of the season up in
Pullman, Wash., earlier this year, and it was also
Washington State who, towards the end of last sea
son, dealt Stanford a fatal blow to its hopes to go to
the Big Dance.
The Cougars once again have the chance to issue
another knock-out punch — and don't think Cardi
nal players aren't aware of that.
"That's the first thing that coach told us," Knight
said. "We had to go up there and beat them, but we
didn't. Washington State came out and played very
hard. We have to do the same here. We have to come
out and play hard. We're at home. Now, they're on
the road. The tides are turned, but we still have to go
out and perform."
Washington State is also clamoring for a tourna
ment bid. The Cougars nearly beat Arizona last
weekend, losing in a double-overtime thriller, but
were still able to bounce back and play well enough
to defeat Arizona State 84-71. The Cougars definite
ly have some bite, so the home-court edge will need
to be backed up by some well-played basketball if the
Cardinal is to triumph.
"Being at home is always more comfortable than
playing on the road," Knight said. "That will be a big
advantage for us, but we still have to play hard
because Washington State knows that they're play
ing for the same thing we're playing for.
"We have to win both. With Washington State,
though, if we lose to them, I feel we'll be in the NIT
especially if we lose to a team that's at the same level
as us and has beaten us once already. We need to get
that win back. But also, we just have to win two
games to get into the tournament."
Scoring has been the Cardinal's latest struggle,
having shot below 40 percent the last two games.
"The problem [in Oregon] was we couldn't knock
down shots," said senior swingman David Harbour,

the Cardinal's energizer off the
bench who provided minimal
spark last week with a dismal 1-

of-7 shooting performance at Ore
gon. "That's what it all comes
down to. We need to create better
rhythm by running our offense
more crisply and efficiently."
Cross who leads the team in
scoring (17.5 points per game) has
also been in a mini-slump, scoring

just seven against the Beavers and
two in the first half against the
Ducks. The Cardinal sharpshoot
er, however, hit four three-point
ers late in the Oregon game.
"My confidence level is still
very high," Cross said. "Every
player has had games where
they're not going to shoot so well.
I'm just putting that behind me
and looking forward to the games
that are coming up.
"I struggled against Oregon
State, but just to come out
[against Oregon] and hit four
three-pointers like that is a big
confidence booster because now I
think that I am out of that slump
that I was in."
Defense, however, will also be
a commodity for Stanford consid
ering Washington State leads the
Pac-10 in field goal accuracy at
51.9 percent. The Cougars are led
by guard Isaac Fontaine (17.8
points per game) and forward
Mark Hendrickson (16 points,
nine rebounds per game) who
leads the Pac-10 with a 64 percent
field-joal shooting mark.
Washington State employs a
three-guard line up featuring
Fontaine, Donminic Ellison (7.1
assists per game), and Shamon
Antrum (14 points per game). It
was Antrum who exploded for 15
points in the first half of the sea
son's earlier contest between the
two teams. Antrum's hot perime
ter shooting (4-of-4 from three
point land) drove a stake into the
heart of the Cardinal early on in
that 77-63 defeat.
"We're not going to let Antrum
get off as well as he did up there,"
Knight said. "He kind of killed us
early. Just that whole three
guard alignment was something
different for us. We'll play defense
harder, and we'll just come out
and play better.
"It's a whole different thing
now. We're playing for more, and
we'll be ready. It'll come down to
whoever wants it more. Who goes
out and plays the hardest and
wants to win."
