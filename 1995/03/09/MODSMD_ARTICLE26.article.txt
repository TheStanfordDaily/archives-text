# Already in, but hoping for more
## Women look for top seed in Washington 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
Even with the Pacific 10 Con
ference championship and a guar
anteed NCAA tournament berth,
the Stanford women's basketball
team still has much to play for,
such as a number one seed.
The Cardinal (24-2 overall, 15-
1 in the Pac-10) commences a
road trip of epic proportions
when it takes on Washington
State (15-10, 8-8 in the Pac-10)
tonight. Because Stanford is cur
rently standing fifth in the AP
poll and fourth in the coach's
poll, a number one regional seed
is not certain. With four teams,
Connecticut, Tennessee, Col
orado and Louisiana Tech,

ranked higher than the Cardinal
and many other teams close
behind, it is imperative that
Stanford wins both games in
order to keep the team in the run
ning for a top seed.
"This will be our toughest road
trip," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "Two wins would
really give the team a big boost."
The Cougars play very tough
at home, with a 6-1 Pac-10 home
record. Washington State
includes a victory over Washing
ton in its collection of triumphs.
Led by junior swingplayer Jenni
Ruff and senior forward Kireen
Ellis, the Cougers would have to
win their final two games to have
any chance of being included in the
tournament.
The Cougars will play a variety
of defenses in its attempt to knock

off the Cardinal. WSU coach
Harold Rhodes employs both zone
and player-to-player defenses in
his game plan and switches
between them constantly.
VanDerveer believes that Stan
ford should handle everything the
Cougars send at the Cardinal.

"We're playing well," she said.
"[The two contests] are really
going to sharpen our games."
Many members of the Stanford
team have stepped up in the last
few games. Freshman Naomi Muli
tauaopele has come off the bench
and supplied some crucial offense
as well as spirit to the team. She
exploded for a career-high 21
points against California and also
scored 11 points against Oregon
State. Her shooting percentage has
steadily crept up and now stands at
62 percent to lead the team. She
also is an important part of the
team off the court.
"I can't imagine where I'd be
without Naomi," VanDerveer said.
"She's so funny."
Another Cardinal who has
played a major role recently is
freshman Kristin Folkl. After the
injury to freshman Olympia Scott
left a void in Stanford's rebounding
ability, Folkl stepped in to fill the
gap. During the games against
Oregon State and Oregon, Folkl
grabbed nine and eight rebounds,
respectively, to lead the team. In
the seven games Scott has been
injured, Folkl leads the team with
42 rebounds.
After the victory over Oregon to
capture the Pac-10 crown outright,
team morale is high. In addition,
there is an added boost to the Car
dinal's spirit, as some of Stanford's
players hail from the state of
Washington and are looking for
ward to playing close to home.
"We are excited about winning
the Pac-10," VanDerveer said. "A
lot of players are going back home.
They seem to really play well when
they go back home. [Sophomore
Tara] Harrington played well in
Oregon and [redshirt freshman]
Vanessa [Nygaard] played well in
L.A"
Freshmen Regan Freuen and
Heather Owen are both from
around the eastern Washington
area. Freuen hails from Spokane
while Owen is from across the bor
der in Moscow, Idaho. The other
two Washington natives, sopho
more Kate Starbird and Muli
tauaopele, are from the Seattle
area.
The two remaining games on
the regular season schedule will be
used by the Cardinal to prove
something to the NCAA tourna
ment committee and itself.
"We know we're the best team
in the Pac-10," VanDerveer said.
"Now we need to prove that we're
the most consistent."
