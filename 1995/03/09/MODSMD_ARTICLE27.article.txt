"Spring training begins in two
weeks — here's a list of players
we'll be inviting to camp."
"I never heard of half of these
guys and the ones I do know are
way past their prime."
"Most of these guys never had a
prime."

Major Bust: The movie
"Major League" was
funny — I'm not sure
how funny it is as reality. I'm
excited for baseball to begin. I've
been thinking, baseball is base
ball, no matter who is out there.

Wrong. Have you looked at a
spring training box score lately?
It's just not worth it if you can't
find your favorites.
Put Me In, Coach: You hear
about NBA players griping about
not getting enough minutes and
baseball players not happy with
their playing time. Monday, the
San Francisco 49ers lost a player
who might have had the most bor
ing job in football, a personal
favorite of mine, punter Klaus
Wilmsmeyer. The 49ers punted
54 times in 1994, compared to the
NFL average of 78. Wilmsmeyer
will make $328,000 with the New
Orleans Saints in '95. By the way,
the top-paid punter in the league,
Indianapolis Colt Chris Gardocki,
will make $1,050,000 in salary
and bonuses in '95. Not bad.
Going Down Under: "I think
we're gonna sink." "Yes, we're
gonna sink." That was the con
versation between helmsman Rod
Davis and crewman lain Murray
as the $3 million, 75-foot yacht

Goin' Dancin': Florida Inter
national University is an example
of why the NCAA basketball tour
nament is a ton of fun. FIU, with
an 11-18 record, is going to the Big
Dance after winning the
TransAmerica Athletic Conference
tournament with a 68-57 victory
over Mercer. The Golden Panthers
will likely be a 16th seed and get
murdered by a No. 1 seed, but the
excitement of the tournament will
definitely be felt on campus. The
64-team field will have its usual
great stories of players, coaches
and programs. That's what makes
this championship so great for col
legiate athletics.
Cross Your Fingers: Stan
ford's men's team could be in trou
ble, even if it finishes off the season
with a pair of wins this week. The
Cardinal fell out of the AP's top 25
and slipped to No. 24 in the USA
Today/CNN poll. But what could
hurt Stanford more is its position
in the Ratings Percentage Index,

one Australia became the first in
the 144-year history of the Ameri
ca's Cup to go under. After a loud
crack, the boat — which was made
of carbon fiber — began to fold like
a sheet of cardboard in the center
and was gone in two minutes.
Dumped into the Pacific, the crew
was stunned but safe.
Does This Bother Anyone
Else? Dept.:The San Francisco
Examiner sports section was
named among the top ten papers in
daily, Sunday and special sections
by the Associated Press Sports Edi
tors. I like the Examiner sports
page, but could someone explain to
me why it insists on calling Stan
ford teams the "Cards"? The
trusty Stanford Daily Styleguide
would confirm the correct usage is,
of course, "Card."

which ranks every Division I team
based on a strength-of-schedule
formula. The Cardinal fell from
34th to 56th after losing a pair of
games on the road in Oregon last
week.
Keefe Update: The last time
the Cardinal men made it to the
tourney, the big red-head Adam
Keefe was Stanford's star. In case
you've lost track of Keefe's NBA
career, here's an update on his
1994-95 season: 51 games, 15 min
utes per game, 5.9 points and 3.8
rebounds for the Utah Jazz. Not
exactly huge numbers for a former
lottery pick, but Keefe has never
really gotten quality minutes,
playing behind Dominique Wilkins
and Kevin Willis in Atlanta, and
now behind Karl Malone with the
Jazz.

played last year, but I'm sure he
did a hell of a job." — Announcer
