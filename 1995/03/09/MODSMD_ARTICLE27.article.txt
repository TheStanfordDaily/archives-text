# Major League blues

"Spring training begins in two
weeks — here's a list of players
we'll be inviting to camp."
"I never heard of half of these
guys and the ones I do know are
way past their prime."
"Most of these guys never had a
prime."
— "Major League"

Major Bust: The movie
"Major League" was
funny — I'm not sure
how funny it is as reality. I'm
excited for baseball to begin. I've
been thinking, baseball is base
ball, no matter who is out there.

Wrong. Have you looked at a
spring training box score lately?
It's just not worth it if you can't
find your favorites.
Put Me In, Coach: You hear
about NBA players griping about
not getting enough minutes and
baseball players not happy with
their playing time. Monday, the
San Francisco 49ers lost a player
who might have had the most bor
ing job in football, a personal
favorite of mine, punter Klaus
Wilmsmeyer. The 49ers punted
54 times in 1994, compared to the
NFL average of 78. Wilmsmeyer
will make $328,000 with the New
Orleans Saints in '95. By the way,
the top-paid punter in the league,
Indianapolis Colt Chris Gardocki,
will make $1,050,000 in salary
and bonuses in '95. Not bad.
Going Down Under: "I think
we're gonna sink." "Yes, we're
gonna sink." That was the con
versation between helmsman Rod
Davis and crewman lain Murray
as the $3 million, 75-foot yacht
