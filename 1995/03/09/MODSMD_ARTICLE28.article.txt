# Golf team king at Duck Invitational
## Begay takes tournament title 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
Last Saturday night, the No. 2
Stanford men's golf team was on
hand in Eugene, Ore., to watch as
Oregon crushed the men's basket
ball team. On the links of the
Eugene Country Club and the
Emerald Valley golf course, how
ever, it was the Cardinal who did
all the crushing.
The team dominated a field of
16 teams en route to defeating a
surprising San Jose State squad
by eight strokes and easily outdis
tancing third-place host Oregon
by 19. It was Stanford's first win
after a two-month winter layoff.
Last week, the team kicked off the
second half of its season in
Hawaii, finishing second and third
respectively in the John Burns
and TaylorMade Invitationals.
"We looked pretty good up
there," said head coach Wally
Goodwin. "The competition
wasn't the best [Oklahoma State
wasn't there], but I think we're
starting to get on track now."
Oklahoma State defeated Stan
ford in both tournaments last
week, knocking the defending
NCAA champion Cardinal out of
the top spot for the first time since
the season began last August.
"It was an OK tournament for
us," said senior Jerry Chang. "We
were favored to win, but there are
lots of areas where we can
improve and we definitely didn't
play our best."
Individually, senior All-Ameri
can Notah Begay 111 led all play
ers, firing a two-round 138 to fin
ish seven-under par and three
strokes ahead of San Jose State's
Steve Woods. The title was
Begay's second straight following
his first-place finish at the Burns
Invitational.
Freshman Tiger Woods placed
fourth overall, faltering a bit on
the second day with a two-over

par 75 and finishing with an even
par total of 145. Senior All-Ameri
can Steve Burdick tied for 14th
place, showing marked improve
ment in his game after a disap
pointing week in Hawaii.
Senior All-American Casey
Martin, who hails from Eugene,
couldn't quite seem to find his
rhythm on his home course, tak
ing 10th place.
"T have a feeling Casey is going
to start making a run," Goodwin
said. "He didn't look his strongest
this week, but he's made a lot of
changes in his game and he's still
getting used to it all. Once things
come together, his level of play
will really start to come up."
"Things were tough for Casey
in Oregon," Chang said. "There
was a lot of pressure for him play
ing in front of his family and
friends."
With senior Ail-American Will
Yanigasawa remaining at Stan
ford to concentrate on academics,
Goodwin held a two-round qualifi
er in which Chang outdueled
sophomore Conrad Ray and junior
David Garcia to win the spot.
For Chang, the tournament
was a chance to return to varsity
ranks for the first time since his
sophomore year. After sitting out
his entire junior season due to a
back injury, he faced a difficult
decision in deciding to even play
golf his final year.
"I really didn't decide whether
I was going to play until the end of
August," Chang said. "With the
caliber of the team we were going
to field this year, I wanted to work
all summer and see whether I
could bring my level of play back
to where I felt like I could con
tribute. After practicing a lot and
winning a tournament, I felt pret
ty confident about returning for
my senior season."

overcoming a first-round 80 to
come back and post a one-over-par
74 at par-73 Emerald Valley on
Tuesday. In what is certain to be
the subject of good-natured teasing
by the team, Chang edged out
teammate Woods in the second
round, placing his score among the
four that counted towards the
team total and leaving the fresh
man in an unfamiliar position as
the odd man out.
"I had a great time coming back
and competing on varsity," Chang

said. "My first-round play was dis
appointing, but things improved
later on and generally it felt great
to be back."
An inescapable I'oe for tne Car
dinal, the weather once again cre
ated problems. Originally, the
tournament was intended to be a
54-hole affair with two rounds
scheduled for Monday, but morn
ing frost nixed such plans and play
was limited to 18 holes on each day.
A second round at the Eugene
Country Club began on Monday,
but the frost delayed the first
round nearly two hours and the
teams were unable to complete
play due to darkness.
"The frost caused a few prob

lems and definitely limited our
playing time," Goodwin said, "but I
don't think it had any real effect on
our performance.
"Obviously, the teams that were
playing well would like to have
played that second round and the
teams playing poorly wouldn't, but
I don't think we can really worry
about stuff like that."
Thus far this winter, the team
has had its practice time cut sub
stantially by rain in the Bay Area.
Greens and fairways have been
either thoroughly soaked or under
water. Even away from home, a
final-round charge by the squad
last week was halted as rain forced
play to be canceled after nine holes.
