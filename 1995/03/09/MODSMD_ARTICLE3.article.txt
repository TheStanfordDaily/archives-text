# Alliance prepares for race
## Senate candidates, COP and initiative announced 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Vowing to "put the power back
into the hands of the people," the
Students' Alliance party yester
day announced its Council of Pres
idents slate, its senate candidates
and the creation of the Student
Rights Initiative — a series of con
stitutional amendments which
aim to limit the power of the
ASSU.
Former Interfraternity Coun
cil President Tom Baranowski,
graduate senator Curtis Kin, un
dergraduate senator Michelle Gee
and COP cabinet member Rachel
Hall will form the Students' Al
liance COP slate.
"In general, they back the Stu
dent Rights Initiative, represent
the entire campus — graduate and

undergraduate — and stress stu
dent issues and services," Stu
dents' Alliance co-chair Andr6
Vanier said.
Vanier said the slate is com
posed of "involved, dynamic stu
dent leaders who care about Stan
ford. They care about the campus
and the student body."
None of the COP candidates
could be reached for comment
early this morning.
Juniors Stephen Russell and
Bud Vigil, sophomores Vanier,
Oliver Miao, Amy Mac Arthur, El
liot Brown and Victoria Markova
and freshmen Brad Smiedt, Marci
Reichbach and Danny Bramzon
will also be running for the senate
in what is shaping up to be the
first election in four years with
two strong political parties.
Russell and Vanier currently

serve as undergraduate senators.
Vanier added that five graduate
senators will also be endorsed by
the Alliance.
"It's time for a change in gov
ernment," Smiedt said. "Our
party can deliver that."
The centerpiece of the Al
liance's platform will be the Stu
dent Rights Initiative, which will
create a judicial branch of the
ASSU, enact a freedom of infor
mation act, constitutionally guar
antee special-fee refunds and
make it easier for senators to hold
referenda on issues decided by the
senate.
Members of the Alliance will
put the initiative on the spring
election ballot by collecting about
1,000 signatures.
The judicial branch, Vanier
said, "will decrease the power of
the senate and increase the
power of the student body."
It will be composed of seven
students, three of whom will be
chosen by the ASSU Committee
on Committees and four of
whom will be elected in the gen
eral election. No more than four
members can be either graduate
or undergraduate students.
The Council of Presidents
will be responsible for enforcing
the committee's decision.
"This will be similar to legis
lation to be voted on by the sen
ate on Tuesday," Vanier said.
"However the People's Platform
and [senate chairj Nawwar
(Kasrawi] have shown an
unwillingness to support it, so
we will take it directly to the
student body."
If the bill does pass the sen
ate, then the Student Rights
Initiative will supersede it,
Vanier added.
The proposal also includes a
freedom of information consti
tutional amendment, Vanier

said. This proposal would
extend the rights students have
under the ASSU bylaws.
"This would give students the
right to attend every meeting
attended by officers of the sen
ate and the COP unless the sen
ate votes by a two-thirds major
ity [to close it]," Vanier said.
"Meetings could also be closed
because of legal requirements."
Also, the right to special-fee
refunds would be constitution
ally guaranteed under the plan,
Vanier said. Currently, refunds
are merely part of the special
fee procedure.
"We would clearly show we
are committed to fee refunds
and make it more difficult to
infringe upon them," Vanier
said.
The plan would also change
the rules on referenda — mak
ing it easier for a minority group
of senators to take issues direct
ly to the students, Vanier said.
If adopted, only a two-fifths
absolute majority would be
required to hold a referendum
to be voted on in the general
election.
"This is designed to protect
the minority interest in the sen
ate," Vanier said. "Currently, if
something controversial passes,

I there is no recourse. [Under this
! bill,] the student body reserves
the final right."
s The Students' Alliance is
; more concerned with the stu
dents than the People's Plat
form, which works mainly for
special interests, said senate
candidate Amy Mac Arthur.
I Senate associate and People's
Platform senate candidate Bill
! Shen disagreed, calling the
Alliance "stooges of the Stan
ford Review."
s "Students' Alliance does not
adequately represent the needs
and interest of students," he
! said. "If you compare their can
i didates to the People's Platform
i candidates, it is obvious who are
the most qualified candidates
and who will take the initiative
! to make Stanford a better place
for students."
» However, Vanier said the
Platform "talks a good game,
but we're the ones out there
i working for the students."
"We have not only embraced
issues that concern students, we
have embraced graduate issues
as well as undergraduate
issues," he said. "We are making
a course book for students, and
members of Students' Alliance
initiated the post office inquiry

and the Stanford Fund task
force."
The Alliance represents all
students, said Alliance co-chair
Smeeta Ramarathnam, a junior.
"People who work in Students'
Alliance do not focus on just one
issue," she said. "You can form a
coalition with Students'
Alliance whether you are a grad
uate or an undergraduate. We
are bringing together people
interested in true reform."
It was the Alliance, Rama
rathnam said, which provided
the impetus for most of the
action taken by the ASSU this
year.
Candidates said they thought
the Alliance had a good chance
to win.
"I'm feeling confident," she
said. "A lot of what we say
makes sense," Reichbach said.
"As long as people get the mes
sage, we will be successful."
Shen disagreed. "When stu
dents examine the issues, the
decision will be clear," he said.
"We are obviously more quali
fied and more representative of
students. We are here to serve
them, not our own interests. I
am absolutely confident that the
People's Platform will sweep the
senate and take the COP."
