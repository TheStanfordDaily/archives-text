## Senate candidates, COP and initiative announced 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Vowing to "put the power back
into the hands of the people," the
Students' Alliance party yester
day announced its Council of Pres
idents slate, its senate candidates
and the creation of the Student
Rights Initiative — a series of con
stitutional amendments which
aim to limit the power of the
ASSU.
Former Interfraternity Coun
cil President Tom Baranowski,
graduate senator Curtis Kin, un
dergraduate senator Michelle Gee
and COP cabinet member Rachel
Hall will form the Students' Al
liance COP slate.
"In general, they back the Stu
dent Rights Initiative, represent
the entire campus — graduate and

undergraduate — and stress stu
dent issues and services," Stu
dents' Alliance co-chair Andr6
Vanier said.
Vanier said the slate is com
posed of "involved, dynamic stu
dent leaders who care about Stan
ford. They care about the campus
and the student body."
None of the COP candidates
could be reached for comment
early this morning.
Juniors Stephen Russell and
Bud Vigil, sophomores Vanier,
Oliver Miao, Amy Mac Arthur, El
liot Brown and Victoria Markova
and freshmen Brad Smiedt, Marci
Reichbach and Danny Bramzon
will also be running for the senate
in what is shaping up to be the
first election in four years with
two strong political parties.
Russell and Vanier currently

serve as undergraduate senators.
Vanier added that five graduate
senators will also be endorsed by
the Alliance.
"It's time for a change in gov
ernment," Smiedt said. "Our
party can deliver that."
The centerpiece of the Al
liance's platform will be the Stu
dent Rights Initiative, which will
create a judicial branch of the
ASSU, enact a freedom of infor
mation act, constitutionally guar
antee special-fee refunds and
make it easier for senators to hold
referenda on issues decided by the
senate.
Members of the Alliance will
put the initiative on the spring
election ballot by collecting about
1,000 signatures.
