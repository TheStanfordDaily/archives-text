Today's previously scheduled home dual match against UC-Irvine has been cancelled due to the
inclement weather and will not be rescheduled.
On Monday, the No. 1-seeded doubles team of Scott Humphries and Paul Goldstein defeated No. 10-
seeded teammates Jeff Salzenstein and Grant Elliott, 6-1, 6-7 (7-3), 7-6 (8-6), in a semifinal match of
the Pacific Coast Men's Doubles Championship played at Stanford Tennis Stadium.
Humphries and Goldstein fought off two match points at 6-4 and 6-5 during the third-set tiebreak.
They won the first big point on a return of serve that was shanked by Goldstein but managed to sail
over the racquet of an approaching Salzenstein.
"It's tough to go out and play someone from your own team," Humphries said.
The match was a makeup of a postponed match from Sunday in La Jolla, Calif. The championship
match will be played at a later date, depending on who wins the other semifinal match between teams
from Pepperdine and USC.
