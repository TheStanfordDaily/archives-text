# ARCHERS
## of LOAF 
### Mike Noren 
For years, rock's most popular Loaf has
been a big guy named Meat, but North
Carolina's Archers of Loaf have the tal
ent, vision and drive to change that.
After a solid debut and a stunning F.P, the
Archers of Loaf this week release "Vee Vee,"
their second album and their most dazzling
and diverse project to date.
Eric Bachmann, Eric Johnson, Matt Gen
tling and Mark Price have been playing togeth
er for just over three years, but in that time

they've made a big splash in the indie world,

drawing more Superchunk, Pavement -

and Dinosaur Jr.
comparisons than
the band probably
cares to hear.
But with the
new album, the

overly simple

, r
compar- i
isons can

be put to
rest, as the

Archers have
carved out an
identity of their
own, a playful
identity of emo
tional nonsense
and cloudiness,
twisted and
warped in the
band's own
unique way.
"Vee Vee"
showcases the
band's knack for
crisp guitar-pop
nuggets that are
rough and laid
back, but spiced
with enough jolts
and perks to keep
you alert. The
songs are pur
posefully vague,
but insightful
nonetheless.
"They mean
stuff," guitarist
Eric Johnson says,
"but not like any
thing in particu
lar."

The story of the Archers of Loaf begins on
a bus in 1990 when Johnson and gui
tarist/vocalist Eric Bachmann met while
going to school at the University of North Car
olina at Chapel Hill.
"We were riding the same bus to class one
day and I just went up and talked to him,"
Johnson says."I knew who he was in high
school because he was in this really funny band.
I had heard that he was looking for people to
play with, but I didn't know him. But since we
were from the same hometown, we had mutu
al friends. So I found out and I was like 'Shit, I'll
just go up to him and see if he wants to play.'"
The two decided to form a band, eventually
adding Matt Gentling on bass and Clay Boycr
on drums. Shortly after the band's formation,
Boyer left and current drummer Mark Price
took his place.
The band's name comes from an odd story
about Gentling's former next-door neighbor.
"He had a longbow, and he would sit out in the
backyard and shoot targets and stuff," Johnson
explains. "Apparently he was pretty good. But

one day Matt was out there and apparently the
guy didn't know that Matt was there, and he
was like shooting a loaf of bread at a target 20
yards away. He would shoot it, and it would of
course just hit the ground about 10 feet away,
and he'd go pick it up. It was just kind of
strange."
Other possible names were similarly weird.
"We thought about Fantasy Truck Stop,

but we thought that sounded too

much like the Spin Doctors or
something," he says. "We thought
about Amy Carter — we just

thought it sounded neat."
In 1993, after they had a name, a single and
a modest reputation, the Archers went to Krap
tone Studios in Chapel Hill and recorded their
debut album "Icky Mettle," a collection of
charming garage rock along the lines of early
Replacements or Flaming Lips.
The album begins with "Web In Front," a
flash of pop brilliance and one of the catchiest
cuts in memory despite relatively little com
mercial radio play. Beyond the opening track,
"Icky Mettle" dishes out song after song of
reckless and unrefined rock that offered a taste
of the hand's budding creative spirit.
"I think the songs are good on 'Icky Mettle,'
but I don't think they're as good as the ones on
'Vee Vee,"' Johnson says. "We just hadn't played
enough together to do more interesting things
at that point."
Since then, Johnson says the Archers have
matured as a band, a direct result of their last
few years of steady recording and touring. Last
June, the group recorded the EP "The Archers
of Loaf vs. The Greatest of All Time," which
whetted fans' appetites for the follow-up full
leneth "Vee Vee."

In the following months, the hype machines
started cranking, and rumors were circulating
about the band signing with Geflfen or other
major labels. Since then "Vee Vee" has proved
worthy of all the hype, but the label rumors
have proved false.
"We talked to about three or four record
companies, but not with any intention of
going," he says. "We don't even have the legal
right to go. We were just curious, and they took
us out to dinner and gave us free albums."
The Archers remain with the California
indie label Alias, with whom they have a four

record deal, the new record "Vee Vee" being the
second.
The new album delivers an engaging variety
of moods and styles, remaining consistently
ambitious and inventive yet also loose and re
laxed.
"Vee Vee" begins with "Step Into the Light,"
a sweet and hopeful introduction that gently
sets you up just to be knocked down by the
straight-ahead rock of the next track "Har
nessed In Slums." Throughout the album, the
band playfully bats you around, continually
piling on and peeling away layers of noise,
melody, thought and emotion with a style
that's brilliant in the most modest and aimless
way possible.
To support the new album, the Archers will
perform March 10 in Palo Alto's Cubberley Au
ditorium, before starting a nation-wide tour
opening for Wcezer.
"I'm really excited about it," Johnson says
regarding the tour with Weezer. "We've only
done one big opening thing, and that was with
the Lemonheads. It was great, because you get
everything you ask for on the rider. You get fed
every night, you get nicer places to stay.... You
get treated special."

Sometimes, this includes a few unexpected
perks, as it did during the Lemonheads tour.
"They would have hotel rooms, and their bus
driver would drive them to the next gig at
night, so we'd get their hotel rooms," Johnson
says. "Usually we just crash on people's floors."
In addition to the special treatment, being
the opening band for a bigger group also
has the advantage of earlier bedtimes.
"We've basically been doing headlining stuff,
and that's cool, but it gets old," he says.
"When your bedtime is 4 a.m., it can wear

you thin. |On this
tour] we'll proba
bly be done every
night by 11 :()0 or
11:30."
But Johnson
admits that expo
sure is the main
reason for the
tour with Weezer.
In the coming
months, count
less mainstream
Weezer fans will
get their first taste
of the Loaf, which
could easily set
the band up for a
major break
through on the
alternative scene.
When the
Flaming Lips
opened for Can
dlebox last fall,
the Lips were cat
apulted from
oddball cult band
to MTV Buzz Bin
favorites. The

Archers'
tour with

Weezer could
have a similar effect,

though Johnson makes
sure to point out, "I would

take one Weezer over a million
Candleboxes."

At any rate, the Archers rock harder than
Candlebox, are just as catchy as Weezer, and
have double the imagination of cither of those
groups.
With a growing reputation, huge new audi
ences and a great new album, this Loaf could be
lined up for the bullseye.
WHAT: Archers of Loaf with Frightwig.
WHERE: Cubberley Community Cen
ter, 4000 Middlefield Road in Palo Alto.

WHEN: Friday, March 10. Doors open
at 7 p.m., show starts at 8.

For years, rock's most popular Loaf has
been a big guy named Meat, but North
Carolina's Archers of Loaf have the tal
ent, vision and drive to change that.
After a solid debut and a stunning F.P, the
Archers of Loaf this week release "Vee Vee,"
their second album and their most dazzling
and diverse project to date.
Eric Bachmann, Eric Johnson, Matt Gen
tling and Mark Price have been playing togeth
er for just over three years, but in that time

they've made a big splash in the indie world,

drawing more Superchunk, Pavement -

and Dinosaur Jr.
comparisons than
the band probably
cares to hear.
But with the
new album, the

overly simple

, r
compar- i
isons can

be put to
rest, as the

Archers have
carved out an
identity of their
own, a playful
identity of emo
tional nonsense
and cloudiness,
twisted and
warped in the
band's own
unique way.
"Vee Vee"
showcases the
band's knack for
crisp guitar-pop
nuggets that are
rough and laid
back, but spiced
with enough jolts
and perks to keep
you alert. The
songs are pur
posefully vague,
but insightful
nonetheless.
"They mean
stuff," guitarist
Eric Johnson says,
"but not like any
thing in particu
lar."

The story of the Archers of Loaf begins on
a bus in 1990 when Johnson and gui
tarist/vocalist Eric Bachmann met while
going to school at the University of North Car
olina at Chapel Hill.
"We were riding the same bus to class one
day and I just went up and talked to him,"
Johnson says."I knew who he was in high
school because he was in this really funny band.
I had heard that he was looking for people to
play with, but I didn't know him. But since we
were from the same hometown, we had mutu
al friends. So I found out and I was like 'Shit, I'll
just go up to him and see if he wants to play.'"
The two decided to form a band, eventually
adding Matt Gentling on bass and Clay Boycr
on drums. Shortly after the band's formation,
Boyer left and current drummer Mark Price
took his place.
The band's name comes from an odd story
about Gentling's former next-door neighbor.
"He had a longbow, and he would sit out in the
backyard and shoot targets and stuff," Johnson
explains. "Apparently he was pretty good. But

one day Matt was out there and apparently the
guy didn't know that Matt was there, and he
was like shooting a loaf of bread at a target 20
yards away. He would shoot it, and it would of
course just hit the ground about 10 feet away,
and he'd go pick it up. It was just kind of
strange."
Other possible names were similarly weird.
"We thought about Fantasy Truck Stop,

but we thought that sounded too

much like the Spin Doctors or
something," he says. "We thought
about Amy Carter — we just

thought it sounded neat."
In 1993, after they had a name, a single and
a modest reputation, the Archers went to Krap
tone Studios in Chapel Hill and recorded their
debut album "Icky Mettle," a collection of
charming garage rock along the lines of early
Replacements or Flaming Lips.
The album begins with "Web In Front," a
flash of pop brilliance and one of the catchiest
cuts in memory despite relatively little com
mercial radio play. Beyond the opening track,
"Icky Mettle" dishes out song after song of
reckless and unrefined rock that offered a taste
of the hand's budding creative spirit.
"I think the songs are good on 'Icky Mettle,'
but I don't think they're as good as the ones on
'Vee Vee,"' Johnson says. "We just hadn't played
enough together to do more interesting things
at that point."
Since then, Johnson says the Archers have
matured as a band, a direct result of their last
few years of steady recording and touring. Last
June, the group recorded the EP "The Archers
of Loaf vs. The Greatest of All Time," which
whetted fans' appetites for the follow-up full
leneth "Vee Vee."

In the following months, the hype machines
started cranking, and rumors were circulating
about the band signing with Geflfen or other
major labels. Since then "Vee Vee" has proved
worthy of all the hype, but the label rumors
have proved false.
"We talked to about three or four record
companies, but not with any intention of
going," he says. "We don't even have the legal
right to go. We were just curious, and they took
us out to dinner and gave us free albums."
The Archers remain with the California
indie label Alias, with whom they have a four

record deal, the new record "Vee Vee" being the
second.
The new album delivers an engaging variety
of moods and styles, remaining consistently
ambitious and inventive yet also loose and re
laxed.
"Vee Vee" begins with "Step Into the Light,"
a sweet and hopeful introduction that gently
sets you up just to be knocked down by the
straight-ahead rock of the next track "Har
nessed In Slums." Throughout the album, the
band playfully bats you around, continually
piling on and peeling away layers of noise,
melody, thought and emotion with a style
that's brilliant in the most modest and aimless
way possible.
To support the new album, the Archers will
perform March 10 in Palo Alto's Cubberley Au
ditorium, before starting a nation-wide tour
opening for Wcezer.
"I'm really excited about it," Johnson says
regarding the tour with Weezer. "We've only
done one big opening thing, and that was with
the Lemonheads. It was great, because you get
everything you ask for on the rider. You get fed
every night, you get nicer places to stay.... You
get treated special."

Sometimes, this includes a few unexpected
perks, as it did during the Lemonheads tour.
"They would have hotel rooms, and their bus
driver would drive them to the next gig at
night, so we'd get their hotel rooms," Johnson
says. "Usually we just crash on people's floors."
In addition to the special treatment, being
the opening band for a bigger group also
has the advantage of earlier bedtimes.
"We've basically been doing headlining stuff,
and that's cool, but it gets old," he says.
"When your bedtime is 4 a.m., it can wear

you thin. |On this
tour] we'll proba
bly be done every
night by 11 :()0 or
11:30."
But Johnson
admits that expo
sure is the main
reason for the
tour with Weezer.
In the coming
months, count
less mainstream
Weezer fans will
get their first taste
of the Loaf, which
could easily set
the band up for a
major break
through on the
alternative scene.
When the
Flaming Lips
opened for Can
dlebox last fall,
the Lips were cat
apulted from
oddball cult band
to MTV Buzz Bin
favorites. The

Archers'
tour with

Weezer could
have a similar effect,

though Johnson makes
sure to point out, "I would

take one Weezer over a million
Candleboxes."

At any rate, the Archers rock harder than
Candlebox, are just as catchy as Weezer, and
have double the imagination of cither of those
groups.
With a growing reputation, huge new audi
ences and a great new album, this Loaf could be
lined up for the bullseye.
