« ■yt started in an
I art gallery of all
JLplaces," Ric Sali
nas says of his comedy
group Culture Clash. "It
was the creation of a cu
rator in the Mission Dis
trict." They came togeth
er to do something dif
ferent for Cinco de
Mayo, to have a comedy
night. There were six of
them then, and the
group was called Come
dy Fiesta. That was in
1985.
Life went on.
Some left the group and

went on to do other things. Then there were
three. And now, seven years later, there are
still three: Salinas, Herbert Siguen/.a and
Richard Montoya. They call themselves Cul
ture Clash, and the trio write, produce, direct
and perform their own comedy shows.
Of the three, Salinas calls himself the
"street-smart" one. He performs a lot of the
physical comedy for their shows. He says
Montoya, as "the man of a thousand faces,"
can act any part, and Siguen/.a is the poet. "I
guess that all adds up to something."
Culture Clash focuses on issues sur
rounding the Chicano population:
gangs, stereotypes, dysfunctional
families, racism, Proposition 187 and the Re
publicans that now control Congress. Sound

grim? Surprisingly, they're not grim at all.
They're really quite funny. Ah, you think, ir
reverence. No, not that either.
It's actually a blend of political satire and
parody. By exaggerating and playing on soci
etal prejudices, these three Latino men are
trying to illustrate the occasional ridiculous
ness of our actions. "We think of comedy as a
double-edged sword," Salinas explains.
"There's the side that laughs and there's the
other side that says, 'Oh, my gosh, I'm laugh
ing at these stereotypes.'"
The group has attacked racism through
the power of comedy for over seven years.
"We're really politically conscious," Salinas
says of the group's standing in the communi
ty. "We respect our elders. We gotta do right;
we can't do wrong and we're very respectful

of that."
Culture Clash first made
headlines in 1990 in Los An
geles with its semi-autobio
graphical play, "The Mis
sion." They returned in 1991
with another play, "A Bowl
of Beings" which later aired
on PBS's "Great Perfor
mances."
Since then, they've written
three more plays and numer
ous skits. They've performed
live across the country, and
have had their own television
show on Fox. Although the
show never aired nationally,
it inspired other Chicano
television shows such as
"House of Buggin'."
"We're invisible. It's pathet
ic," Salinas remarks. Accord
ing to Salinas, Latinos make
up only one percent of televi
sion characters. Perhaps with
the influence of acts like Cul
ture Clash, more Chicano
shows will begin to break out.
"We were the first ones to do
a show where the actors, pro
ducers and writers were Lati
nos."
The group has also made a
name for itself outside of the
Chicano community. The
trio's performances have
often been compared to "Sat
urday Night Live" and"In
Living Color," but Salinas is
skeptical about the similari
ties.
"You always get labeled,"
Salinas says."It helps people
relate better." He admits,
however, that these two
shows — along with "The
Brady Bunch," "Gilligan's Is
land" and"I Love Lucy" —
have influenced the group.
Over the years, the
group has become
more professional.

"We realize that we shouldn't settle for less,"
Salinas explains. So they have sharpened
their image, transforming the once im
promptu comedy troupe to an established
act. In the process, they've improved their
ability to convey the point more clearly and
more quickly. "We've been able to get to the
point a lot faster," he adds.
In choosing to portray Latino life, the
group hopes to provide Chicanos an oppor
tunity to laugh at themselves. Seeing the
humor in hurtful situations helps to remove
some of the pain of discrimination.
"Humor heals," Salinas quotes in Spanish.
It allows Latinos to laugh at Americans, at the
absurdity of the stereotypes. It lets them also
appreciate the "irony of the U.S. not wanting
Latinos when we've been here all along," Sali
nas comments.
Non-Latinos often hear "one word in
Spanish and think they can't understand the
whole thing," Salinas says. But Salinas insists
that Culture Clash is just as accessible to
members of other ethnic groups. Though it's
hard to accept unpleasant truths about our
selves, to realize our prejudices, Culture
Clash's direct and humorous approach forces
us to acknowledge them. To increase aware
ness, Salinas finds humor more effective
"than hitting people over the head."
Of course, it's not always easy. "A lot of
people look at us and think we're playing on
the stereotypes... " Salinas says.
There are also those issues too serious to
laugh at. And Salinas acknowledges the limi
tations. "But we walk that fine line," Salinas
says.
"Comedy is so personal. People think
we're too offensive and too political. And
they either walk out or sit there and say they
don't like it. And then some people don't get
it.... It's just not their cup of tea." But that
doesn't seem to bother him much. "We do it
for ourselves," he adds.
Although the group has been working
lately on their first screenplay, they
will be taking a break to perform at
Stanford. They will be commemorating '60s
activist Cesar Chavez tomorrow at Dinkel
spiel Auditorium along with Ballet Folklori
co de Stanford and the Teatro Xicano.
"We believe in what he fought for and
lived for," Salinas says of Chavez. And they
will honor him in true Culture Clash style —
with sharp humor and satire.

memorative Celebration" featuring
Culture Clash, Teatro Xicano and Bal
