# 'The Castle Spectre' haunts for fun with melodrama

right light enters and breaks the
darkness, and slowly more shining
white lights follow and introduce
themselves into the blackness of the space.
Light and dark — this contrast in color,
meaning and behavior begin and end "The
Castle Spectre," the new Drama Department
production playing at The Nitery.

This 18th-century melodrama includes
all the conventions of the now rarely-per
formcd form: medieval castles, murders,
vengeance, ghosts, dungeons and daggers.
The play was written as the first Gothic
melodrama in 1797 by Matthew G.
("Monk") Lewis.
The characters in the play are certainly
stock characters — there is little subtlety and
psychological complexity. But that is the way
a melodrama is supposed to be.
Each character is either black or white,
and nothing in this piece can be considered
gray. The play boasts a virginal captive maid
en, Angela — who is as innocent as her an
gelic name professes — played by Sonja
Kuftinec.
The opulent costumes, designed by prod
uct design graduate student Stephanie Fel
ton, signify the characters' moral color. The
dastardly villain, Karl Osmond (Thomas
Freeland), is just as evil as his black cape. He
holds Angela prisoner in order to force her to
give him her hand. She, of course, will not
sully her purity because she loves another.
Enter the dashing Byronic hero, Percy
(Abhi Katyal), whose character perfectly
symbolizes courage, nobility and just the
right amount of pride. Percy loves Angela,
and suffers many an inconvenience to save
her.
To add to this tangle, the past murder of
Osmond's brother Reginald and Reginald's
wife and daughter must be solved and
avenged. And there are many sprinklings of
sword tights and comedy to adorn the stark
nes« of behavior.
"Melodrama certainly won't take us into
the complexities of world social problems,"
Kuftinec said, "But in a way it's so black and
white that it shows how this simplification of
things is so obviously not reality.
"The extremeness of things makes you re
alize that this is not a way you can construct
reality," she added.

Originally, this play was staged as larger
than-life, bravura-style acting in very large
space.
The actors studied engravings of 18th-
Century acting and copied gestures from the
period as "starts," which very briefly stop the
motion of a particular acting expression.
This style differs from today's focus on natu
ralistic detail.
The acting style focuses much more on
gesture and large movements. "As an actor it
requires a lot of use of body, which makes it
a lot of fun for the actors," Kuftinec said.
"The style is less psychological or internal
— it's very external," she said. "You arc real
ly trying to demonstrate your emotions and
exhibit what you are doing."
The energy and the fun involved in stag
ing this play was obvious in the pre-show
joking and laughter that went on between
the actors, some commenting on the con
straints of the costumes and the difficulty of
moving in them.

In the warm-ups before the play, the ac
tors had to practice strong melodramatic
movements which stopped in very expres
sive positions, underlining the importance
of body in the melodrama form.

Director Richard Schoch studied the
piece for his Ph.D. orals and said "one of the
positive things about producing it is that it
has that allure of never being done. In fact, I
don't know of a production of it in the Unit
ed States."
Schoch emphasized that melodrama was

originally a musical drama (melody and
drama). Stark, eerie organ music under
scores the action, purposefully affecting the
audience's emotions.
The music is very effective in steering the
spectators and setting the moods: It signals
the entrance of the villain, applauds the hero
and celebrates the saintliness of the heroine.
Other effects, too, heighten extremes and
emphasize emotion.
"Since we're in this small space, we used
different set conventions to emphasize the
18th-Century melodrama form," Schoch
said. "The physical set is entirely made up of

doors, so that there are no walls, and the au
dience sees these large gold sets standing out
against the dark." The set was designed by
drama graduate student Aleksandra Wolska.
To visually play upon the light and dark, a
pale ghost enters from the past and wreaks
havoc on the darkened scene — a necessary
element of the Gothic form. The lighting
creates a certain melodramatic mood. "We
used a lot of footlights and unnatural light
effects to make people look bigger and more
dramatic and also to create shadows,"
Schoch said.

Despite it's professedly unrealistic no
tions, the play does express some brief social
commentaries which relate to the historical
context in which the play was written.
One of the slaves, Hassan (Kurt Velguth),
often mentions how he was torn from his
wife and his native Africa and how much he
enjoys seeing the white man suffer.
The other characters such as the Shake
spearean clown Motley (Abe Newman), the
corpulent worldly Father Philip (Jordan
Gelber), the gossipy maid Alice (Melissa
Colleen Stevenson), and the conniving
slaves all serve to give a more rounded-out
picture to the play.
Kenric (Cenon Advincula), at first a black
character as shown by his black garb, repents
at the end and takes off his black jacket re
vealing a white shirt.
The corrupt head slave, Saib (Hristo
Stephanov), who serves Earl Osmond, still
expects the other two slaves to wait on him.
This is shown in a visually magnificent scene
where the two slaves carry pillows on their
heads and wait for Saib to fall in their arms
and then lay him down on the satin pillows.

For the audience, viewing this play can be
somewhat disconcerting because the form is
so different from what is usually seen on the
theater stage.
"It is a form that has fallen out on the le
gitimate stage, but it can be very exciting for
the audience to watch," Schoch said.
Kuftinec emphasizes how melodrama
does show up in other art forms. "Movies
have taken a lot from the melodrama, and a
melodrama really milks an audience," she
said. "The audience really should root for
the hero and hiss at the villain, though we
haven't taken it to that point."
The last scene is raucously funny, and it
allows the audience not only to come back to
reality, but to realize how much fun is in
volved for the actors and for the audience in
this piece.
"The Castle Spectre" has a great mix ot
comedy, melodramatic acting, and fun
which allow the audience to forget about the
real world and view a unique piece rarely
performed. The energy and excitement in
"The Castle Spectre" provide for a unique
evening well-spent.

Originally, this play was staged as larger
than-life, bravura-style acting in very large
space.
The actors studied engravings of 18th-
Century acting and copied gestures from the
period as "starts," which very briefly stop the
motion of a particular acting expression.
This style differs from today's focus on natu
ralistic detail.
The acting style focuses much more on
gesture and large movements. "As an actor it
requires a lot of use of body, which makes it
a lot of fun for the actors," Kuftinec said.
"The style is less psychological or internal
— it's very external," she said. "You arc real
ly trying to demonstrate your emotions and
exhibit what you are doing."
The energy and the fun involved in stag
ing this play was obvious in the pre-show
joking and laughter that went on between
the actors, some commenting on the con
straints of the costumes and the difficulty of
moving in them.

In the warm-ups before the play, the ac
tors had to practice strong melodramatic
movements which stopped in very expres
sive positions, underlining the importance
of body in the melodrama form.

Director Richard Schoch studied the
piece for his Ph.D. orals and said "one of the
positive things about producing it is that it
has that allure of never being done. In fact, I
don't know of a production of it in the Unit
ed States."
Schoch emphasized that melodrama was

originally a musical drama (melody and
drama). Stark, eerie organ music under
scores the action, purposefully affecting the
audience's emotions.
The music is very effective in steering the
spectators and setting the moods: It signals
the entrance of the villain, applauds the hero
and celebrates the saintliness of the heroine.
Other effects, too, heighten extremes and
emphasize emotion.
"Since we're in this small space, we used
different set conventions to emphasize the
18th-Century melodrama form," Schoch
said. "The physical set is entirely made up of

doors, so that there are no walls, and the au
dience sees these large gold sets standing out
against the dark." The set was designed by
drama graduate student Aleksandra Wolska.
To visually play upon the light and dark, a
pale ghost enters from the past and wreaks
havoc on the darkened scene — a necessary
element of the Gothic form. The lighting
creates a certain melodramatic mood. "We
used a lot of footlights and unnatural light
effects to make people look bigger and more
dramatic and also to create shadows,"
Schoch said.

Despite it's professedly unrealistic no
tions, the play does express some brief social
commentaries which relate to the historical
context in which the play was written.
One of the slaves, Hassan (Kurt Velguth),
often mentions how he was torn from his
wife and his native Africa and how much he
enjoys seeing the white man suffer.
The other characters such as the Shake
spearean clown Motley (Abe Newman), the
corpulent worldly Father Philip (Jordan
Gelber), the gossipy maid Alice (Melissa
Colleen Stevenson), and the conniving
slaves all serve to give a more rounded-out
picture to the play.
Kenric (Cenon Advincula), at first a black
character as shown by his black garb, repents
at the end and takes off his black jacket re
vealing a white shirt.
The corrupt head slave, Saib (Hristo
Stephanov), who serves Earl Osmond, still
expects the other two slaves to wait on him.
This is shown in a visually magnificent scene
where the two slaves carry pillows on their
heads and wait for Saib to fall in their arms
and then lay him down on the satin pillows.

For the audience, viewing this play can be
somewhat disconcerting because the form is
so different from what is usually seen on the
theater stage.
"It is a form that has fallen out on the le
gitimate stage, but it can be very exciting for
the audience to watch," Schoch said.
Kuftinec emphasizes how melodrama
does show up in other art forms. "Movies
have taken a lot from the melodrama, and a
melodrama really milks an audience," she
said. "The audience really should root for
the hero and hiss at the villain, though we
haven't taken it to that point."
The last scene is raucously funny, and it
allows the audience not only to come back to
reality, but to realize how much fun is in
volved for the actors and for the audience in
this piece.
"The Castle Spectre" has a great mix ot
comedy, melodramatic acting, and fun
which allow the audience to forget about the
real world and view a unique piece rarely
performed. The energy and excitement in
"The Castle Spectre" provide for a unique
evening well-spent.
