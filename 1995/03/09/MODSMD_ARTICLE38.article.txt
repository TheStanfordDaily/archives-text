# The 						art of art within art: 'The Play's the Thing'

### Sam Park 
Al 926 comic farce by a Hungarian play
wright. Sounds absolutely irresistible,
doesn't it? Well, my RA thought so and
away we went into the City to discover what
the latest thing the ACT was cooking up.
It turns out the farce wasn't so farcical and
the Hungarian playwright not so Hungarian.
All for the better. What awaited was a clever,
often brilliant comedy examining the relation
between life and theater, acting and living.
Those dichotomies are mirror images of
each other, according to playwright Ferenc
Molnar. For the theater people who populate
this farce, every movement is larger-than-life,
and every situation is a matter of life or death.
"Life isn't all theater," says one of the char
acters in the opening scene.
"Yes, it is — if you write plays," says the
playwright, Sandor Turai (Ken Ruta).
The structure of the play works so that
Sandor practically writes the whole story be
fore our eyes. He introduces himself to the au
dience as he ponders the perfect way to start a
play. The ideal way, of course, is with the char
acters establishing a sense of time and setting.
Accordingly, we're told that this is the be
ginning of a promising weekend spent at a
classy Mediterranean palazzo. Sandor's pro
tege, Albert (Don Burroughs), is engaged to
"the prima donna," a Norma Desmondish
type named llona Szabo (Kimberly King).
Wedding bells soon shall ring, oh happy
happy joy joy.

Problems begin (don't they always?) when
Albert overhears his future fiancee being ro
manced in her room by a former lover. Faced
with betrayal, the boy is about to cut his wrists
with a butter knife when Sandor intervenes
and thinks up a plot to save Albert and Ilona's
engagement. The plot, of course, involves the
writing of a play, a machination wonderfully
pulled off by Sandor.
Sandor's play-within-a-play (reason for
the title's reference to "Hamlet"), pro
vides Molnar with the chance to put life
under a magnifying glass and reveal the intri
cate connections between the supposed reali
ty of life and the illusion of theater. Through
the play-within-a-play, the boundaries be
tween life and representation become so in
termingled that there is no telling which is
which.
After all, Molnar seems to ask, what consti
tutes real life? He manipulates the action so
that at one point we have one of the characters
being forced to play "himself" onstage, so that
we have an actor playing an actor who is play
ing himself.
This strange situation plays with the idea
of what is the difference between people made
of flesh and blood and those made by a
writer's pen. Molnar proves that there is very
little difference between the two. A represen
tation of reality can be just as real as life itself.
But what is life, Molnar asks time and
again. For him, as shown through the play, it

is a series of stage entrances and exits, fade-ins
and black-outs, witty dialogue and continu
ous action.
The people in the play have come to think
of life as one great play with all the boring
parts cut out. Their witty banter is measured
by the same standards as a critic reviewing a
play, so that they talk as if life were an eternal
rehearsal and a succession of opening nights.
The characters have perfected their en
trance into the surreal world of theater so well
that for them, the ending of a conversation
should be followed by a fade-out, and a witty
comment begs for applause.
Whereas another play, like say, "Angels in
America," would try to imitate life and pre
tend what is happening onstage is natural and
real and contemporary, "The Play's the
Thing" goes the other way around and por
trays life as theater itself.
This is where the play gains significance.
For these characters accept the conventions of
theater as life itself, respecting its twists and
turns. They pretend that life is a play, and
though this may sound deluded, at least it's an
honest approach to life.
After all, the real stuff, the deep stuff, the
desperate revelations climbing their way to
someone's lips — all that only happens after
the living is done with and the acting begins;
all this can only begin when we move away
from the real, touchable world and transcend
to a surreal plateau.

What Molnar is tapping at is that life is
only good when it exists beyond an
everyday, superficial level and takes
off into the realm of theater. It's only when
emotions overwhelm us and the situation de
mands it that all the "acting" stops, and real
life begins. That's when people really start
telling each other the truth and living honest
ly. It's this brilliant observation what gives
"The Play's the Thing" its depth and its sense
of timelessness.
First performed almost 70 years ago, and
adapted by British playwright P.G. Wode
house, "The Play's the Thing" is a comedy
with few laughs but much to say. The rela
tionships between the characters are only
slightly amusing and the jokes, precious and
funny as they are, come by only occasionally.
But the entire show is done with ACT's
usual competence and talent, performed
with great precision and care. "The Play's the
Thing" is a surprise, a revelation, a blessing.
It's not about broken engagements, or cun
ning playwrights, or desperate prima don
nas. It's about life itself.
