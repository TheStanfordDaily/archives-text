# A 						Vision of the 17th Century
## Kushner's 'Illusions' comes to life 
### Michael G. Nichols 
Most Stanford students are familiar with Tony
Kushner s Tony award-winning play "Angels
in America," However, few are familiar with
another work currently being presented by the Menlo
Players Guild at the Burgess Theater in Menlo Park. In a
very different vein, "The Illusion," a modern rendition
of a 17th Century restoration comedy, presents a witty
and entertaining side to the otherwise quite serious au
thor.
Only a short bike ride from Stanford, the Burgess
Theater features plays performed by a variety of local
talent, most typically Silicon Valley day-jobbers with a
few aspiring actors (willing to work without pay)
thrown in. But this is no typical community theater.
While the level of talent varies, all those on stage are ex
perienced, and most make acting more than a simple
sideline hobby. While this does not mean the caliber of
performance is repertory, it is certainly not plagued by
mid-life crisis victims, struggling to find the childhood
actor/actress inside them.
The intriguing story of an aging father's wish to seek
knowledge of his long-lost son before he faces death,
"The Illusion" is freely adapted from Pierre Corneille's
"L'lllusion Comique," without being painfully '90s. The
spirit of the original production is preserved while some
of the language and plot is modernized without being
contemporized. The father, as a desperate measure to
find his long-lost son who he banished from his pres
ence as a young man, seeks out the assistance of a crafty
sorceress named Alcandre who can, it is said, sculpt
shadowy visions of people and places far away in time
and space.
The visions, however, turn out to be different from
what Pridamant (the father) anticipates. Apropos of
restoration comedy, we discover a classic talc with a
modern tinge through twists and turns in language as
well as love. More than a simple card game, however,
this text has an intriguing resolution and ending that
give it the feel of Tom Stoppard.
Directed by Mark Drumm (who has also spearhead
ed productions at UC-Santa Cruz), "The Illusion" is a
play in step with the entertainment side of Ram's Head.
This goal is simple, and success is achieved. The play is
humorous, characters arc well defined and the language
of the play is delightful. If you want to see the story of a
pining lover gone awry, this is the show for you.
Two additional enjoyable elements of the production

were its careful attention to set design (George
Gimenez) and costuming (Fati Bristow), elements of
productions often underdone in community theater.
Set in the cave of the magician during the 17th Century
near Remulac (a small town in the south of France), the
"stone" of the habitat eschews the "set plunked down on
a stage" mentality, and bleeds the line of the fourth wall
(the imaginary wall between the audience and the stage)
by extending out the stone beyond the lip of the stage.
The costumes, as well, are fitting and show no trace of
closet scavenging. Moreover, the actors move naturally
and comfortably, demonstrating the benefit of assign
ing clothes not merely by size, but by personality types.
While at times overacted, the performances blend to
gether well, creating a production that, while not seam
less, was quite entertaining. And any hammy or
overzealous moments, such as the final line of the show,
are forgiven in the general sprit of the play which is, after
all, a comedy. The first lines of the show, for instance, are
a turn-off â€” projected in an oddly restrained and arti
ficial tone. Hut not to worry, this foreboding omen is
soon dispelled by the realization that it is not the actor
playing the part, but the character of the man portrayed
that is odd and uncomfortable in his situation.
The finest performances in the show were clearly de
livered by Dean Burgi, who plays the part of the sorcer
ess Alcandre, and Dennis Ludwick as the son of Pied
mont. Ludwick, a recent Berkeley graduate who has also
acted at the Royal Court in England, has all the makings
of stardom yet unrealized: a charismatic yet substantive
style, woman-swooning looks and a grand smile.
On the whole, the play has to be seen as entertain
ment and little more. Seeing however that Kushner
wrote it as a commercial enterprise to support the writ
ing of "Angels in America," this is not surprising. "The
Illusion" is a clear winner over any substanceless movie
and no more expensive. In fact, tickets are two-for-one
on Thursdays, and the student fare is a paltry $8. And
that's a cheap date with class.
