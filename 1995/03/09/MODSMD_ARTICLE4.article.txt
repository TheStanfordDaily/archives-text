# Engineering dean Gibbons moves up to new position
## 
### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
Electrical Engineering Prof.
James Gibbons will step down
from his current post as dean of
the School of Engineering next fall
to take over the newly created po
sition of special counsel for the
president and provost for industry
relations.
This new position will involve
overseeing University relations
with domestic and international
corporations. Gibbons will be in

charge of deciding the goals Stan
ford will pursue with corpora
tions, and the resources needed to
reach these goals.
The role of liaison between the
University and industry is a chal
lenging one, according to Provost
Condoleezza Rice, because "indus
tries are beginning to decide how
to relate to universities in the
business department instead of
corporate offices. ... It is becom
ing a more complicated process."
Gibbons, explaining the impor
tance of his new role, said in a

statement that "school deans and
their development officers must
carry the significant responsibility
for corporate development initia
tives, with coordination coming
from the Office of the President
and Provost." Gibbons could not
be reached yesterday for further
comment.
University President Gerhard
Casper also outlined his vision of
the new position. "The assign
ment is to respond to academic, as
well as development, needs of the
University," he said in a state
ment. "The task is to ascertain
what can be done to increase rela
tions between Stanford and
industry across all areas of the
University, but with a special
emphasis on engineering, the sci
ences, and biology and medicine."
Rice said that Gibbons was
chosen for the new position
because "he has a long history of
pursuing excellent industrial
relations in the Engineering
Department."
Gibbons will spend one-third
of his time in this position, with
the remainder of his schedule
devoted to serving on the faculty
of the School of Engineering.
Many of his engineering col
leagues said they will miss his

leadership. Anne Gaddy, the
associate dean of administration
of the School of Engineering, said
that Gibbons has proven himself
as a "fabulous, visionary leader."
Dwain Fullerton, associate
dean for the external office of
development in the School of
Engineering, echoed the senti
ment. "I think in the 10 years
that I have had the chance to
work with him that he has just
been a magnificent leader for the
Engineering School."
As to Gibbons' resignation,
Gaddy said, "It is the worst news
I've heard this year."
Gibbons' shift in position will
take place following the appoint
ment of a new Engineering dean,
which is scheduled to occur by
Sept. 1, according to Rice.
Rice said that she will ask the
Faculty Senate to form a commit
tee to appoint another dean. This
process will begin in the early
spring, she said.
