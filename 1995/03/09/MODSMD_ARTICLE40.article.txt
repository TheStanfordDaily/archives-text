## Focus on: Max's Eatz 
### Chris Levinson 
Here's the question — where is all the
parking? You know the situation. You've de
cided on an evening of excitement in greater
downtown Palo Alto, come to a full and com
plete halt at each of the strategically placed
stop signs, made it halfway up University —
only to find it packed. Where are all of these
people going? Where did they come from?
And why didn't they stay there?
Tonight was one of those nights. It was
raining, I was solo, and that Lexus that cut
me off five minutes ago just took my spot.
Max's Eatz, a brand new pint-sized spin-off
of the well known dessert mecca, Max's
Opera House Cafe, had lured me out in this
downpour with promises of good eats. It's
new; question is, is it improved....
They hit you with dessert first. This is a
self-serve set up, and before your eyes can
focus on the hanging menu, your nose is
pressed up against the display case boldly ad-

vertising Fantasy,
Chocolate Marble
Blackout and Ulti
mate Chocolate
cakes. Solid mounds
of chocolate daring
you to save room for
later.
1 order up half a
turkey sandwich,
opt for the special
vegetable soup and
they throw in a salad
for good measure
($5.75). Drinks you
pour for yourself,
which I do and then
dodge the bustling
cherubic waiters
decked out in T
shirts proclaiming
"Everything you al
ways wanted to eat"
and head for a table.
The presentation
borders on cold. Red
neon, muted shades
of tile, eccentric wire
rimmed hanging
light fixtures all add
up to what could be a
vibrating racket. But
the service is sweet,

the food rather tasty, and tonight, 6:30 on a
Thursday evening, the parking serves up the
only vexation.
As 1 wait for a delivery of the edible goods,
1 check out the surrounding food. Tonight
the Pot Roast Brisket ($7.95) is a big seller.
Nice strips of beef slathered in a caraway

gravy and paired with your choice of warm
potato salad or mashed potatoes. A sweet
will-o'-the-wisp sits sipping her iced tea as
her boy companion wrestles his lips around a
towering hot corned beef and pastrami on
rye striped with sweet mustard, red tomatoes
and crisp lettuce ($6). The post-work set to
my right are served up a mean-looking Chi

nese Chicken Salad ($5.75) in duplicate. A
perfect blend of rice noodles piled high atop
a nice portion of chopped chicken (you have
an option of fewer calories if you order the
Chicken Salad "Lite").
The hard-hacked chairs and room pitch
promise a rapid turn over. They want to
feed you — but quickly. Want something
that won't weigh you down? Go light with a
vegetarian double-stuffed potato (twice
baked and mixed with all sorts of greenery)
with salad ($5.50), or a tuna ($5), chicken
($5) or turkey breast ($5.50) sandwich. The
woman behind me is practically orgasmic
over the steamed veggies (carrots, green
beans, snow peas and broccoli) with brown
rice ($7.95). Maybe next time I'll get those.
As for that dessert. ... People always say
Max's is the place. I can't say I agree. The
apple pie ($3.25) proves to be dull lumps of
uninventive fruit layered between a dreary
crust. The fruit tart (seasonal), loaded with
strawberries and their close relatives, looks
promising, but the cheesecakes and choco
late threats look leaden and imposing. 1 say
if you're going to do it, do it right. Head up
the street for gelato, or wait a few weeks for
the Haagen-Dazs to open up next door. One
question answered — Max's proves a great
place for a quickie, although the parking
question remains open as I beat it out back
into the rain. ■
