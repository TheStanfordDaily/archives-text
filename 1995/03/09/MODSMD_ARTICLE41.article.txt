# TREK, TO LAS VEGAS:
## The 						lure of the neon, camels and Wayne Newton

Story and photos by Martin L. Yeung

-iWgHBk cmcni^cr when you were a
«.Ci bright-eyed frosh so excited
about getting away from your
parents and coming to Stanford? By now,
neurosis has replaced euphoria as you've set
tled into a plodding routine of classes and re
sume-padding activities. It may be only mid
year, but already your thoughts turn to plan
ning a holiday escape from the gilded prison
of Stanford.
So what to do for spring break? If you're
like me, you're either too poor to trot off to
Europe on some Alpine hiking trip or too
bored to go to the same old California tourist
traps. So do what I did.
Go on the ultimate in alternative spring
breaks. Go to a place your mother warned
you about.
Go to Las Vegas.
Probably half the people reading this arti
cle aren't even old enough to legally gamble
and drink, but has this stopped anyone be
fore? This holiday was designed especially
for the non-gambling, risk-adverse, poverty
stricken Stanford student. Like Mecca to the
Muslims, Las Vegas should be a place to
which every American makes a pilgrimage.
From the drive-through wedding chapels to
Elvis impersonators, Las Vegas has a style all
its own.
Money talks
OK, it's two weeks until spring break be
gins and your bank balance would make
Charles Keating laugh hysterically. But if you
have a car and $300, you can enjoy debauch
erous and sinful delights for a full five days.

It helps to take a car. Buses can connect
you with most of the major tourist attrac
tions in town and run on a regular basis at
about a buck a pop, but one complaint often
heard is that Vegas is nothing more than a
bunch of casinos stuck in the middle of a
desert. Those critics probably didn't venture
too far off "the Strip," where many of the
best-known casinos are located. And it's
hard to get off the Strip without a car.
But even if you can't drive down, Vegas is
a fairly cheap destination to tly to. Depend
ing on how far you book in advance, you can
get there for under $140 round-trip. And
with Southwest's two-for-one deal, you can
get away with flying for $70.
Once you're there, you can count on an
extensive cab system that can whisk you
from to and from anywhere in the city.
Again, the buddy system helps to split the
fee. Drivers are generally quite gregarious
and seem more than happy to chat over your

life's story on the way to the hotel. And un
less you're planning to go out on a day trip to
the Grand Canyon, the cab fare rarely ex
ceeds $20.
Rooms run anywhere from $35 a night at
Excalibur to about $157 a night at the Mi
rage. I've shared bodily warmth with five
guys in one room before — that works out to
about $7 per person per night, depending on
factors like whether you come in on a week
end or if there's a big convention in town.
And unlike Stanford Dining Services,
where prices are based on some inflationary
budget crafted on Mars, Vegas offers an
enormous variety of gourmet delights to
stimulate the palate and the pocketbook.
From 99-cent shrimp cocktails to the $2.50
steak and egg breakfast at the Golden
Nugget, food is good and cheap all over
town.
Vegas, relatively sin-free
As you check in, your senses are assaulted
by the cacophony of loud bells and dazzling
lights emanating from the casino area.
Wasn't it considerate of the management to
put the front desk so close to the casino? Go
ahead, plop a quarter in a slot machine on
the way to your room. Not trying your luck
in Vegas is like going to Paris without en
countering a rude and patronizing French
man. Unless you hit the million-dollar jack
pot, no one is going to handcuff you and cart
your ass down to the slammer.
A word of caution for those of you who
get the unstoppable urge to play a few hands
at the tables. The Strip casinos card reli
giously, so either turn 21 before spring break
or get a good fake lIX Generally speaking, the
casinos off the Strip aren't as scrutinizing

about age. So just act casual and don't make
too much of a scene when you win a hand
and you'll be all right.
But most Stanford students are not into
sitting in front of a slot machine for hours on
end feeding it coins while forgetting to feed
themselves. That sort of compulsion only
happens with hum bio majors during finals
week.
So, there are lots of other things to do in
Las Vegas besides the big "G" word. Don't
look for any major symphonies or art muse
ums, but when it comes to cheap thrills like
rock concerts, circus side-shows and even
wholesome entertainment, this place has few
equals.
If you haven't been to Vegas before, you
could probably spend your entire time
roaming Las Vegas Boulevard without tiring
of it. The Strip is the ultimate in car-cruising
avenues. In addition to the casinos that line
its streets, there are theme parks, shopping

malls, novelty stores and quaint neighbor
hoods you should only venture into during
the day.
I would suggest starting off with the Luxor
hotel located at the south end of town and
working your way north. You'll be sure to
catch all the sights, bring a good pair of walk
ing shoes because you will get a lot of exer
cise. For Stanford students used to getting
around this gigantic campus, this shouldn't
be a problem.
The odyssey begins
I'he Luxor is a replica of Khufu's pyramid
in Gi/.a, Egypt. At night, a 315,000-watt light
shines from the top, producing a beacon that
can be seen a hundred miles away while dri
ving towards Nevada. Wayne Newton per
forms here, and you're greeted at the door by
talking camels.
Among the fun rides I was treated to was a
mock boat tour of the Nile River, right inside
the pyramid. It's less costly and more excit
ing than an Egyptology lecture on campus.
And, it reminded me a lot of the sedate "It's a
Small World" ride at Disneyland.
But if you prefer a more jarring experi
ence, don't miss the action / adventure mo
tion rides on the second level. Just remem
ber, as I did, to close your eyes if it gets too in
tense.
Just next door is the Excalibur, which
looks like a LEGO set gone insane. King
Arthur's authoritative voice beckons you to
enter his realm of 4,000-plus rooms. There
are carnival rides, but the place is more a vi
sual treat where employees dressed in me
dieval garb wish you a "royal" day.
But Excalibur was outglit/.ed and outsized

last year by the opening of
the multi-billion dollar
MGM Grand across the
street. Barbara Streisand

sang here on New Year's Eve,
and Dorothy and Toto greet
you in person at the door.
Said to be the largest hotel
gaming complex on the

planet, the MGM has 5,000-
plus rooms and 3,500 slot
machines lining the Yellow <

Brick Road leading to the
buffet. Looking out over a
view of the Emerald City, I
chowed down on almost

everything under the sun,
from fresh squeezed or
ange juice to corned beef I
hash. It would have been

perfect except for the periodic
interruptions by witch cackles in

the distance and mock thunderstorms.
As you trot down Las Vegas Boulevard
and work off that substantial breakfast gut,
you'll come across Caesar's Palace and the
Forum Shops mall. You would have to be
blind to miss it. With its classical Roman
motif, Caesar's sticks out like togas at a nun
convention. •

Buff Roman centurions
roam the mall where the ceiling
— painted to look like an open-air
market — changes lighting every
half hour, turning day into night.
The shops, including Guess?,

Warner Brothers and Versace,
are pricey, but I guarantee you
will not find a mall like this
anywhere else.
Your next stop will proba

bly be the Mirage, a mock Hawai
ian paradise where illusionists
Siegfried and Roy prance around
stage doing some pretty wild
magic tricks with white tigers.
And 1 think the tropical garden
and fish collection is a must-see

for bio majors. Maybe you can
convince your profs you're
doing some valuable research

and get a few extra days off to study "the
fauna."
But perhaps the most spectacular attrac
tion at the Mirage is the simulated volcanic
explosion that lights the sky and snarls up
traffic when goofy tourists like you and me
stop to gawk while driving.

Treasure Island hotel / casino is directly
adjacent to the Mirage. Seeing that they're
owned by the same fabulously wealthy Steve
Wynn, this is no a surprise. And how appro
priate that he should choose pirates as his
motif, given the millions he is worth. The
kids love it because it's a realization of the
fantasies in Robert Stevenson's book. You'll
love it because it offers a cool place to sit
down after all the walking you've done.
The red-light area
By your second day, you'll be ready to
venture into the corridor running from the
Strip to downtown. This section isn't really a
"red light" area per se, but it's a good, seedy
place to visit if you want to go off the beaten
track. This area is littered with pawn shops
and off-the-wall places selling everything
from used clothing to old LP's and eight
track cassettes.
A word of caution, the pawn shops here
like to stick it to people on both ends so you
should definitely haggle with the shopkeep
er. Never pay full price, because you'll only
be adding to the ridiculously high profit this
pirate already makes.
Dozens of wedding chapels also occupy
the twilight zone between downtown and
the Strip. If you have the overwhelming urge
to get hitched quickly and cheaply, look no
further. You need only one week of residen
cy in Nevada to get a marriage license — or
divorce certificate — for a pret-a-porter
wedding. With flowers and organist, the bill
usually runs $200.
Going through the corridor area, you'll
also see the little advertised motels that rent
by the hour. One displayed a board reading
"3 hours for $25." They're quiet, clean and
safe, and many people do rent them by the
nightly rate. You may even want to consider
staying in one yourself. But often the rooms
are utilized for passions other than sleep.
Although prostitution is illegal in the city
of Las Vegas, brothels are permitted to oper
ate 30 miles outside town. But that hasn't
stopped the thriving escort service industry
from serving their clientele with adult enter
tainment. For $150, you can have a nearly
naked buxom female — or beefy male —
dancing in your room within the hour.
Downtown Las Vegas is good tor about
two hours of chuckles, then it gets as old as
the casinos. But for history buffs, it's the
Vegas of legend, seen in so many cheesy late
night movies and sitcoms. One place that
does merit a stop — Binion's Horseshoe,
where you can photograph yourself next to
$1 million in cash on display. Also, the food
here is cheaper than any other place in town,
so it seems the ideal way to end a day's walk
ing tour.
Have h(xits, will hike
Not all the action happens inside the city.
Contrary to popular belief, the area sur
rounding Vegas is not a Saharan sand dune,
but a rugged outback perfect for you out
door enthusiasts.
The Red Rock recreational area just out
side of town is an awesome place where you
can climb a rock face or hike up a mountain
with the Las Vegas skyline as a backdrop.
Pack a sack lunch and make it a day trip.
Or, for you water lovers, Hoover Dam,

named after the namesake of our beloved
HooTow, and the Lake Mead recreational
area is a must. With the long streak of over
cast days we've been having here lately, it's an
opportunity for you to work on that faded
tan. Since Las Vegas has an average of 55
cloudy days a year, chances are you'll need
sunblock.
Not on a budget?
If you aren't on a strict budget, Vegas is a
veritable paradise of factory outlets and cut
rate prices that would put any sale at the
Stanford Mall to shame. The great variety of
stores and specialty shops will keep you
shop-o-holics occupied for days. The Forum
Shops at Caesar's and the Fashion Show Mall
don't close until 11 p.m., giving you plenty o'
time to browse the selections.
The clubbing scene in Las Vegas is also
quite an experience. Some bars have a cover
charge, but many don't. For those of you
who would like to see how students party
outside the ivory prison, I recommend
"Tom and lerry's" and "Moose Magillicut
ty's." Both are close by the University of
Nevada-Las Vegas and you'll discover that
the local students get drunk with the same
grace and advanced technology as Stan
fordites do.

And while driving through town, you'll
see huge billboards boasting
"10-times odds," and "our slots pay
back 100 percent." Supposedly, the
Nevada Gaming Commission must certi
fy that slot machines pay out a certain per
centage of the amount you plop in. It's all
about as random as the Stanford housing
lottery so I can't say that one casino has bet
ter odds than others.
If you've never gambled before, but
would like to learn, every casino I've men
tioned has free morning lessons teach
ing you how to play everything

from poker to baccarat. I
actually recommend
this, even if you don't ever in
tend to gamble. It's like the Vi
ennese ball — you may never
waltz again in your life, but at
least you won't be completely
dumbfounded when you see

it done again.
You'll find out more
ways to bet money than
Nick Leeson did with Bar
ings' billions on the Tokyo
stock market. One room
that Leeson would have
felt particularly at home
in is the sports book.
One can be found in
every casino. Perfect

for you stockbroker
wannabes — these
rooms bear a re
markable resem
blance to the trad
ing floors of major
exchanges, com

ngt-j, win
plete with the
"spreads" and win-loss

scores of every conceivable
sports event from basketball
games to horse races all over
the country.

So there you have it, a quickie overview
and some possible ideas for a trip to a place
as American as it gets. It's a place where un
bridled capitalism meets mainstream values
without violently exploding into ideological
warfare. It's the place where your wildest
dreams can come true.
It's Las Vegas.

Story and photos by Martin L. Yeung

-iWgHBk cmcni^cr when you were a
«.Ci bright-eyed frosh so excited
about getting away from your
parents and coming to Stanford? By now,
neurosis has replaced euphoria as you've set
tled into a plodding routine of classes and re
sume-padding activities. It may be only mid
year, but already your thoughts turn to plan
ning a holiday escape from the gilded prison
of Stanford.
So what to do for spring break? If you're
like me, you're either too poor to trot off to
Europe on some Alpine hiking trip or too
bored to go to the same old California tourist
traps. So do what I did.
Go on the ultimate in alternative spring
breaks. Go to a place your mother warned
you about.
Go to Las Vegas.
Probably half the people reading this arti
cle aren't even old enough to legally gamble
and drink, but has this stopped anyone be
fore? This holiday was designed especially
for the non-gambling, risk-adverse, poverty
stricken Stanford student. Like Mecca to the
Muslims, Las Vegas should be a place to
which every American makes a pilgrimage.
From the drive-through wedding chapels to
Elvis impersonators, Las Vegas has a style all
its own.
Money talks
OK, it's two weeks until spring break be
gins and your bank balance would make
Charles Keating laugh hysterically. But if you
have a car and $300, you can enjoy debauch
erous and sinful delights for a full five days.

It helps to take a car. Buses can connect
you with most of the major tourist attrac
tions in town and run on a regular basis at
about a buck a pop, but one complaint often
heard is that Vegas is nothing more than a
bunch of casinos stuck in the middle of a
desert. Those critics probably didn't venture
too far off "the Strip," where many of the
best-known casinos are located. And it's
hard to get off the Strip without a car.
But even if you can't drive down, Vegas is
a fairly cheap destination to tly to. Depend
ing on how far you book in advance, you can
get there for under $140 round-trip. And
with Southwest's two-for-one deal, you can
get away with flying for $70.
Once you're there, you can count on an
extensive cab system that can whisk you
from to and from anywhere in the city.
Again, the buddy system helps to split the
fee. Drivers are generally quite gregarious
and seem more than happy to chat over your

life's story on the way to the hotel. And un
less you're planning to go out on a day trip to
the Grand Canyon, the cab fare rarely ex
ceeds $20.
Rooms run anywhere from $35 a night at
Excalibur to about $157 a night at the Mi
rage. I've shared bodily warmth with five
guys in one room before — that works out to
about $7 per person per night, depending on
factors like whether you come in on a week
end or if there's a big convention in town.
And unlike Stanford Dining Services,
where prices are based on some inflationary
budget crafted on Mars, Vegas offers an
enormous variety of gourmet delights to
stimulate the palate and the pocketbook.
From 99-cent shrimp cocktails to the $2.50
steak and egg breakfast at the Golden
Nugget, food is good and cheap all over
town.
Vegas, relatively sin-free
As you check in, your senses are assaulted
by the cacophony of loud bells and dazzling
lights emanating from the casino area.
Wasn't it considerate of the management to
put the front desk so close to the casino? Go
ahead, plop a quarter in a slot machine on
the way to your room. Not trying your luck
in Vegas is like going to Paris without en
countering a rude and patronizing French
man. Unless you hit the million-dollar jack
pot, no one is going to handcuff you and cart
your ass down to the slammer.
A word of caution for those of you who
get the unstoppable urge to play a few hands
at the tables. The Strip casinos card reli
giously, so either turn 21 before spring break
or get a good fake lIX Generally speaking, the
casinos off the Strip aren't as scrutinizing

about age. So just act casual and don't make
too much of a scene when you win a hand
and you'll be all right.
But most Stanford students are not into
sitting in front of a slot machine for hours on
end feeding it coins while forgetting to feed
themselves. That sort of compulsion only
happens with hum bio majors during finals
week.
So, there are lots of other things to do in
Las Vegas besides the big "G" word. Don't
look for any major symphonies or art muse
ums, but when it comes to cheap thrills like
rock concerts, circus side-shows and even
wholesome entertainment, this place has few
equals.
If you haven't been to Vegas before, you
could probably spend your entire time
roaming Las Vegas Boulevard without tiring
of it. The Strip is the ultimate in car-cruising
avenues. In addition to the casinos that line
its streets, there are theme parks, shopping

malls, novelty stores and quaint neighbor
hoods you should only venture into during
the day.
I would suggest starting off with the Luxor
hotel located at the south end of town and
working your way north. You'll be sure to
catch all the sights, bring a good pair of walk
ing shoes because you will get a lot of exer
cise. For Stanford students used to getting
around this gigantic campus, this shouldn't
be a problem.
The odyssey begins
I'he Luxor is a replica of Khufu's pyramid
in Gi/.a, Egypt. At night, a 315,000-watt light
shines from the top, producing a beacon that
can be seen a hundred miles away while dri
ving towards Nevada. Wayne Newton per
forms here, and you're greeted at the door by
talking camels.
Among the fun rides I was treated to was a
mock boat tour of the Nile River, right inside
the pyramid. It's less costly and more excit
ing than an Egyptology lecture on campus.
And, it reminded me a lot of the sedate "It's a
Small World" ride at Disneyland.
But if you prefer a more jarring experi
ence, don't miss the action / adventure mo
tion rides on the second level. Just remem
ber, as I did, to close your eyes if it gets too in
tense.
Just next door is the Excalibur, which
looks like a LEGO set gone insane. King
Arthur's authoritative voice beckons you to
enter his realm of 4,000-plus rooms. There
are carnival rides, but the place is more a vi
sual treat where employees dressed in me
dieval garb wish you a "royal" day.
But Excalibur was outglit/.ed and outsized

last year by the opening of
the multi-billion dollar
MGM Grand across the
street. Barbara Streisand

sang here on New Year's Eve,
and Dorothy and Toto greet
you in person at the door.
Said to be the largest hotel
gaming complex on the

planet, the MGM has 5,000-
plus rooms and 3,500 slot
machines lining the Yellow <

Brick Road leading to the
buffet. Looking out over a
view of the Emerald City, I
chowed down on almost

everything under the sun,
from fresh squeezed or
ange juice to corned beef I
hash. It would have been

perfect except for the periodic
interruptions by witch cackles in

the distance and mock thunderstorms.
As you trot down Las Vegas Boulevard
and work off that substantial breakfast gut,
you'll come across Caesar's Palace and the
Forum Shops mall. You would have to be
blind to miss it. With its classical Roman
motif, Caesar's sticks out like togas at a nun
convention. •

Buff Roman centurions
roam the mall where the ceiling
— painted to look like an open-air
market — changes lighting every
half hour, turning day into night.
The shops, including Guess?,

Warner Brothers and Versace,
are pricey, but I guarantee you
will not find a mall like this
anywhere else.
Your next stop will proba

bly be the Mirage, a mock Hawai
ian paradise where illusionists
Siegfried and Roy prance around
stage doing some pretty wild
magic tricks with white tigers.
And 1 think the tropical garden
and fish collection is a must-see

for bio majors. Maybe you can
convince your profs you're
doing some valuable research

and get a few extra days off to study "the
fauna."
But perhaps the most spectacular attrac
tion at the Mirage is the simulated volcanic
explosion that lights the sky and snarls up
traffic when goofy tourists like you and me
stop to gawk while driving.

Treasure Island hotel / casino is directly
adjacent to the Mirage. Seeing that they're
owned by the same fabulously wealthy Steve
Wynn, this is no a surprise. And how appro
priate that he should choose pirates as his
motif, given the millions he is worth. The
kids love it because it's a realization of the
fantasies in Robert Stevenson's book. You'll
love it because it offers a cool place to sit
down after all the walking you've done.
The red-light area
By your second day, you'll be ready to
venture into the corridor running from the
Strip to downtown. This section isn't really a
"red light" area per se, but it's a good, seedy
place to visit if you want to go off the beaten
track. This area is littered with pawn shops
and off-the-wall places selling everything
from used clothing to old LP's and eight
track cassettes.
A word of caution, the pawn shops here
like to stick it to people on both ends so you
should definitely haggle with the shopkeep
er. Never pay full price, because you'll only
be adding to the ridiculously high profit this
pirate already makes.
Dozens of wedding chapels also occupy
the twilight zone between downtown and
the Strip. If you have the overwhelming urge
to get hitched quickly and cheaply, look no
further. You need only one week of residen
cy in Nevada to get a marriage license — or
divorce certificate — for a pret-a-porter
wedding. With flowers and organist, the bill
usually runs $200.
Going through the corridor area, you'll
also see the little advertised motels that rent
by the hour. One displayed a board reading
"3 hours for $25." They're quiet, clean and
safe, and many people do rent them by the
nightly rate. You may even want to consider
staying in one yourself. But often the rooms
are utilized for passions other than sleep.
Although prostitution is illegal in the city
of Las Vegas, brothels are permitted to oper
ate 30 miles outside town. But that hasn't
stopped the thriving escort service industry
from serving their clientele with adult enter
tainment. For $150, you can have a nearly
naked buxom female — or beefy male —
dancing in your room within the hour.
Downtown Las Vegas is good tor about
two hours of chuckles, then it gets as old as
the casinos. But for history buffs, it's the
Vegas of legend, seen in so many cheesy late
night movies and sitcoms. One place that
does merit a stop — Binion's Horseshoe,
where you can photograph yourself next to
$1 million in cash on display. Also, the food
here is cheaper than any other place in town,
so it seems the ideal way to end a day's walk
ing tour.
Have h(xits, will hike
Not all the action happens inside the city.
Contrary to popular belief, the area sur
rounding Vegas is not a Saharan sand dune,
but a rugged outback perfect for you out
door enthusiasts.
The Red Rock recreational area just out
side of town is an awesome place where you
can climb a rock face or hike up a mountain
with the Las Vegas skyline as a backdrop.
Pack a sack lunch and make it a day trip.
Or, for you water lovers, Hoover Dam,

named after the namesake of our beloved
HooTow, and the Lake Mead recreational
area is a must. With the long streak of over
cast days we've been having here lately, it's an
opportunity for you to work on that faded
tan. Since Las Vegas has an average of 55
cloudy days a year, chances are you'll need
sunblock.
Not on a budget?
If you aren't on a strict budget, Vegas is a
veritable paradise of factory outlets and cut
rate prices that would put any sale at the
Stanford Mall to shame. The great variety of
stores and specialty shops will keep you
shop-o-holics occupied for days. The Forum
Shops at Caesar's and the Fashion Show Mall
don't close until 11 p.m., giving you plenty o'
time to browse the selections.
The clubbing scene in Las Vegas is also
quite an experience. Some bars have a cover
charge, but many don't. For those of you
who would like to see how students party
outside the ivory prison, I recommend
"Tom and lerry's" and "Moose Magillicut
ty's." Both are close by the University of
Nevada-Las Vegas and you'll discover that
the local students get drunk with the same
grace and advanced technology as Stan
fordites do.

And while driving through town, you'll
see huge billboards boasting
"10-times odds," and "our slots pay
back 100 percent." Supposedly, the
Nevada Gaming Commission must certi
fy that slot machines pay out a certain per
centage of the amount you plop in. It's all
about as random as the Stanford housing
lottery so I can't say that one casino has bet
ter odds than others.
If you've never gambled before, but
would like to learn, every casino I've men
tioned has free morning lessons teach
ing you how to play everything

from poker to baccarat. I
actually recommend
this, even if you don't ever in
tend to gamble. It's like the Vi
ennese ball — you may never
waltz again in your life, but at
least you won't be completely
dumbfounded when you see

it done again.
You'll find out more
ways to bet money than
Nick Leeson did with Bar
ings' billions on the Tokyo
stock market. One room
that Leeson would have
felt particularly at home
in is the sports book.
One can be found in
every casino. Perfect

for you stockbroker
wannabes — these
rooms bear a re
markable resem
blance to the trad
ing floors of major
exchanges, com

ngt-j, win
plete with the
"spreads" and win-loss

scores of every conceivable
sports event from basketball
games to horse races all over
the country.

So there you have it, a quickie overview
and some possible ideas for a trip to a place
as American as it gets. It's a place where un
bridled capitalism meets mainstream values
without violently exploding into ideological
warfare. It's the place where your wildest
dreams can come true.
It's Las Vegas.

Story and photos by Martin L. Yeung

-iWgHBk cmcni^cr when you were a
«.Ci bright-eyed frosh so excited
about getting away from your
parents and coming to Stanford? By now,
neurosis has replaced euphoria as you've set
tled into a plodding routine of classes and re
sume-padding activities. It may be only mid
year, but already your thoughts turn to plan
ning a holiday escape from the gilded prison
of Stanford.
So what to do for spring break? If you're
like me, you're either too poor to trot off to
Europe on some Alpine hiking trip or too
bored to go to the same old California tourist
traps. So do what I did.
Go on the ultimate in alternative spring
breaks. Go to a place your mother warned
you about.
Go to Las Vegas.
Probably half the people reading this arti
cle aren't even old enough to legally gamble
and drink, but has this stopped anyone be
fore? This holiday was designed especially
for the non-gambling, risk-adverse, poverty
stricken Stanford student. Like Mecca to the
Muslims, Las Vegas should be a place to
which every American makes a pilgrimage.
From the drive-through wedding chapels to
Elvis impersonators, Las Vegas has a style all
its own.
Money talks
OK, it's two weeks until spring break be
gins and your bank balance would make
Charles Keating laugh hysterically. But if you
have a car and $300, you can enjoy debauch
erous and sinful delights for a full five days.

It helps to take a car. Buses can connect
you with most of the major tourist attrac
tions in town and run on a regular basis at
about a buck a pop, but one complaint often
heard is that Vegas is nothing more than a
bunch of casinos stuck in the middle of a
desert. Those critics probably didn't venture
too far off "the Strip," where many of the
best-known casinos are located. And it's
hard to get off the Strip without a car.
But even if you can't drive down, Vegas is
a fairly cheap destination to tly to. Depend
ing on how far you book in advance, you can
get there for under $140 round-trip. And
with Southwest's two-for-one deal, you can
get away with flying for $70.
Once you're there, you can count on an
extensive cab system that can whisk you
from to and from anywhere in the city.
Again, the buddy system helps to split the
fee. Drivers are generally quite gregarious
and seem more than happy to chat over your

life's story on the way to the hotel. And un
less you're planning to go out on a day trip to
the Grand Canyon, the cab fare rarely ex
ceeds $20.
Rooms run anywhere from $35 a night at
Excalibur to about $157 a night at the Mi
rage. I've shared bodily warmth with five
guys in one room before — that works out to
about $7 per person per night, depending on
factors like whether you come in on a week
end or if there's a big convention in town.
And unlike Stanford Dining Services,
where prices are based on some inflationary
budget crafted on Mars, Vegas offers an
enormous variety of gourmet delights to
stimulate the palate and the pocketbook.
From 99-cent shrimp cocktails to the $2.50
steak and egg breakfast at the Golden
Nugget, food is good and cheap all over
town.
Vegas, relatively sin-free
As you check in, your senses are assaulted
by the cacophony of loud bells and dazzling
lights emanating from the casino area.
Wasn't it considerate of the management to
put the front desk so close to the casino? Go
ahead, plop a quarter in a slot machine on
the way to your room. Not trying your luck
in Vegas is like going to Paris without en
countering a rude and patronizing French
man. Unless you hit the million-dollar jack
pot, no one is going to handcuff you and cart
your ass down to the slammer.
A word of caution for those of you who
get the unstoppable urge to play a few hands
at the tables. The Strip casinos card reli
giously, so either turn 21 before spring break
or get a good fake lIX Generally speaking, the
casinos off the Strip aren't as scrutinizing

about age. So just act casual and don't make
too much of a scene when you win a hand
and you'll be all right.
But most Stanford students are not into
sitting in front of a slot machine for hours on
end feeding it coins while forgetting to feed
themselves. That sort of compulsion only
happens with hum bio majors during finals
week.
So, there are lots of other things to do in
Las Vegas besides the big "G" word. Don't
look for any major symphonies or art muse
ums, but when it comes to cheap thrills like
rock concerts, circus side-shows and even
wholesome entertainment, this place has few
equals.
If you haven't been to Vegas before, you
could probably spend your entire time
roaming Las Vegas Boulevard without tiring
of it. The Strip is the ultimate in car-cruising
avenues. In addition to the casinos that line
its streets, there are theme parks, shopping

malls, novelty stores and quaint neighbor
hoods you should only venture into during
the day.
I would suggest starting off with the Luxor
hotel located at the south end of town and
working your way north. You'll be sure to
catch all the sights, bring a good pair of walk
ing shoes because you will get a lot of exer
cise. For Stanford students used to getting
around this gigantic campus, this shouldn't
be a problem.
The odyssey begins
I'he Luxor is a replica of Khufu's pyramid
in Gi/.a, Egypt. At night, a 315,000-watt light
shines from the top, producing a beacon that
can be seen a hundred miles away while dri
ving towards Nevada. Wayne Newton per
forms here, and you're greeted at the door by
talking camels.
Among the fun rides I was treated to was a
mock boat tour of the Nile River, right inside
the pyramid. It's less costly and more excit
ing than an Egyptology lecture on campus.
And, it reminded me a lot of the sedate "It's a
Small World" ride at Disneyland.
But if you prefer a more jarring experi
ence, don't miss the action / adventure mo
tion rides on the second level. Just remem
ber, as I did, to close your eyes if it gets too in
tense.
Just next door is the Excalibur, which
looks like a LEGO set gone insane. King
Arthur's authoritative voice beckons you to
enter his realm of 4,000-plus rooms. There
are carnival rides, but the place is more a vi
sual treat where employees dressed in me
dieval garb wish you a "royal" day.
But Excalibur was outglit/.ed and outsized

last year by the opening of
the multi-billion dollar
MGM Grand across the
street. Barbara Streisand

sang here on New Year's Eve,
and Dorothy and Toto greet
you in person at the door.
Said to be the largest hotel
gaming complex on the

planet, the MGM has 5,000-
plus rooms and 3,500 slot
machines lining the Yellow <

Brick Road leading to the
buffet. Looking out over a
view of the Emerald City, I
chowed down on almost

everything under the sun,
from fresh squeezed or
ange juice to corned beef I
hash. It would have been

perfect except for the periodic
interruptions by witch cackles in

the distance and mock thunderstorms.
As you trot down Las Vegas Boulevard
and work off that substantial breakfast gut,
you'll come across Caesar's Palace and the
Forum Shops mall. You would have to be
blind to miss it. With its classical Roman
motif, Caesar's sticks out like togas at a nun
convention. •

Buff Roman centurions
roam the mall where the ceiling
— painted to look like an open-air
market — changes lighting every
half hour, turning day into night.
The shops, including Guess?,

Warner Brothers and Versace,
are pricey, but I guarantee you
will not find a mall like this
anywhere else.
Your next stop will proba

bly be the Mirage, a mock Hawai
ian paradise where illusionists
Siegfried and Roy prance around
stage doing some pretty wild
magic tricks with white tigers.
And 1 think the tropical garden
and fish collection is a must-see

for bio majors. Maybe you can
convince your profs you're
doing some valuable research

and get a few extra days off to study "the
fauna."
But perhaps the most spectacular attrac
tion at the Mirage is the simulated volcanic
explosion that lights the sky and snarls up
traffic when goofy tourists like you and me
stop to gawk while driving.

Treasure Island hotel / casino is directly
adjacent to the Mirage. Seeing that they're
owned by the same fabulously wealthy Steve
Wynn, this is no a surprise. And how appro
priate that he should choose pirates as his
motif, given the millions he is worth. The
kids love it because it's a realization of the
fantasies in Robert Stevenson's book. You'll
love it because it offers a cool place to sit
down after all the walking you've done.
The red-light area
By your second day, you'll be ready to
venture into the corridor running from the
Strip to downtown. This section isn't really a
"red light" area per se, but it's a good, seedy
place to visit if you want to go off the beaten
track. This area is littered with pawn shops
and off-the-wall places selling everything
from used clothing to old LP's and eight
track cassettes.
A word of caution, the pawn shops here
like to stick it to people on both ends so you
should definitely haggle with the shopkeep
er. Never pay full price, because you'll only
be adding to the ridiculously high profit this
pirate already makes.
Dozens of wedding chapels also occupy
the twilight zone between downtown and
the Strip. If you have the overwhelming urge
to get hitched quickly and cheaply, look no
further. You need only one week of residen
cy in Nevada to get a marriage license — or
divorce certificate — for a pret-a-porter
wedding. With flowers and organist, the bill
usually runs $200.
Going through the corridor area, you'll
also see the little advertised motels that rent
by the hour. One displayed a board reading
"3 hours for $25." They're quiet, clean and
safe, and many people do rent them by the
nightly rate. You may even want to consider
staying in one yourself. But often the rooms
are utilized for passions other than sleep.
Although prostitution is illegal in the city
of Las Vegas, brothels are permitted to oper
ate 30 miles outside town. But that hasn't
stopped the thriving escort service industry
from serving their clientele with adult enter
tainment. For $150, you can have a nearly
naked buxom female — or beefy male —
dancing in your room within the hour.
Downtown Las Vegas is good tor about
two hours of chuckles, then it gets as old as
the casinos. But for history buffs, it's the
Vegas of legend, seen in so many cheesy late
night movies and sitcoms. One place that
does merit a stop — Binion's Horseshoe,
where you can photograph yourself next to
$1 million in cash on display. Also, the food
here is cheaper than any other place in town,
so it seems the ideal way to end a day's walk
ing tour.
Have h(xits, will hike
Not all the action happens inside the city.
Contrary to popular belief, the area sur
rounding Vegas is not a Saharan sand dune,
but a rugged outback perfect for you out
door enthusiasts.
The Red Rock recreational area just out
side of town is an awesome place where you
can climb a rock face or hike up a mountain
with the Las Vegas skyline as a backdrop.
Pack a sack lunch and make it a day trip.
Or, for you water lovers, Hoover Dam,

named after the namesake of our beloved
HooTow, and the Lake Mead recreational
area is a must. With the long streak of over
cast days we've been having here lately, it's an
opportunity for you to work on that faded
tan. Since Las Vegas has an average of 55
cloudy days a year, chances are you'll need
sunblock.
Not on a budget?
If you aren't on a strict budget, Vegas is a
veritable paradise of factory outlets and cut
rate prices that would put any sale at the
Stanford Mall to shame. The great variety of
stores and specialty shops will keep you
shop-o-holics occupied for days. The Forum
Shops at Caesar's and the Fashion Show Mall
don't close until 11 p.m., giving you plenty o'
time to browse the selections.
The clubbing scene in Las Vegas is also
quite an experience. Some bars have a cover
charge, but many don't. For those of you
who would like to see how students party
outside the ivory prison, I recommend
"Tom and lerry's" and "Moose Magillicut
ty's." Both are close by the University of
Nevada-Las Vegas and you'll discover that
the local students get drunk with the same
grace and advanced technology as Stan
fordites do.

And while driving through town, you'll
see huge billboards boasting
"10-times odds," and "our slots pay
back 100 percent." Supposedly, the
Nevada Gaming Commission must certi
fy that slot machines pay out a certain per
centage of the amount you plop in. It's all
about as random as the Stanford housing
lottery so I can't say that one casino has bet
ter odds than others.
If you've never gambled before, but
would like to learn, every casino I've men
tioned has free morning lessons teach
ing you how to play everything

from poker to baccarat. I
actually recommend
this, even if you don't ever in
tend to gamble. It's like the Vi
ennese ball — you may never
waltz again in your life, but at
least you won't be completely
dumbfounded when you see

it done again.
You'll find out more
ways to bet money than
Nick Leeson did with Bar
ings' billions on the Tokyo
stock market. One room
that Leeson would have
felt particularly at home
in is the sports book.
One can be found in
every casino. Perfect

for you stockbroker
wannabes — these
rooms bear a re
markable resem
blance to the trad
ing floors of major
exchanges, com

ngt-j, win
plete with the
"spreads" and win-loss

scores of every conceivable
sports event from basketball
games to horse races all over
the country.

So there you have it, a quickie overview
and some possible ideas for a trip to a place
as American as it gets. It's a place where un
bridled capitalism meets mainstream values
without violently exploding into ideological
warfare. It's the place where your wildest
dreams can come true.
It's Las Vegas.
