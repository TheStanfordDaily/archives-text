Leaving Egypt:
JFK International Airport, New York, 1988
My grandmother made the El Al man ask in
Yiddish.
He said, "Are you bringing any gifts?"
"Did you pack your suitcase yourself?"
"Did anyone help you?"
And then he was done.
Gay gezunte hait. Everyone smiled.
Yes, my bag has been packed by others than my
self.
I carry the part of the Red Sea that vanished
for Moses (Now you know where it went).
I carry at least ten different tribes which I have
found,
1 carry the other three walls of the Temple and
the quiet prayers of the worshippers,
I carry the pale of settlement,
I carry the ashes of my grandfather's first
wife and children who were made silent
while I want to scream
"MY BAG IS TOO HEAVY!"
But I will still not check it
and subject it to your tosses and throws.
