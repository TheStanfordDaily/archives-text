# The 						Jewish Arts Festival: Celebrating culture THAT ENRICHES
## 
### Sangeetha Ramanujam 
Now rolling into its second
year, the Jewish Arts Festival
has emerged as a vibrant
presence in the Stanford community.
This competition offers Jewish stu
dents a new and creative way to cele
brate their religion, through any form
of visual or written medium. The fes
tival is the only campus "forum for
Jews to creatively express themselves
as Jews," explained Michael Latz, the
program director of Stanford Hillel.
Founded last year, the competition
is the brainchild of Stanford art stu
dent Jessica Cohen. "She walked in
[to the Hillel office], and said she
wanted to [establish the competi
tion]," Latz said.
Cohen downplays the impact of the
idea, simply stating that "people are
always coming in | to the Hillel center]
wanting to do things, depending on
their interests. I like art, so 1 wanted to
do something with that."
Since its conception, the competi
tion has come a long way. "We've now
done this before. It's not trial and
error anymore," Cohen remarked.
The evolution of the event has in
cluded narrowing its area of concen
tration and drawing more Stanford
faculty members to serve as judges.
"Last year, [the event] was open to
Jewish members of the entire com
munity. This year, only Stanford stu
dents are eligible," Cohn said.
In short, it has become a Stanford
event rather than a city-wide one.
"We've defined our target popula
tion," Latz explained.
Sponsored by Stanford Hillel, the
Jewish Students Association, several

members of the local art community
and other Stanford organizations, the
festival offers Jewish students an op
portunity to display their talents. The
competition is a broad one, allowing
students to represent any topic in al
most any artistic form as long it re
flects Jewish life or culture.
Possible submissions include poet
ry, personal narrative, history / non
fiction, paintings, collages, ritual ob
jects and photography. "People can
choose [to portray] any aspect of their
Jewish identity," Latz commented.
The diversity of art forms present
ed adds to the overall goals of the
competition. It allows unifies stu
dents of various backgrounds and in
terests via Judaism.
"It provides an opportunity to
bring people together," Latz said. "It's
yet another avenue for Jewish stu
dents to express their Jewish identi
ties."
The arts festival is also geared to
wards turning students' minds away
from the damaging effects of the
Holocaust. "It's something more pro
active than reactive," Cohen observed.
"It provides us with something more
positive to build on."
"It allows students to be active
agents of their own Judaism," Latz
added.
Students can submit their work to
the Hillel Office until April 10. They
will be competing for one of two
grand prize awards of 400 dollars.
Submissions will be judged on —
among other criteria — adherence to
a Jewish theme and competency in the
chosen medium, as well the emotion

al effect of their work on the audience.
"It has to be inspirational," Cohen
said.
Derek Isaacowitz, who wrote the
poem which won last year's competi
tion, encourages other Jewish stu
dents to participate in the festival. A
psychology major, he admits that he
hadn't written much poetry and had
to force himself to write his winning
poem.
"I wanted to submit something .. .
I think people who are artistically cre
ative get [too involved in] other acad
emic areas.
"I think everyone should submit.
They have to look within themselves
and discover what one thing they can
do."
Because of his interest and involve
ment in last years festival, Isaacowitz
will serve as one of the judges for this
year's competition.
Above all, the Jewish Arts Festival is
the celebration of a culture. It offers
an opportunity for Jewish students to
come together and present a state
ment about their ethnic origins and
individual talents.
"Last year — since it was during
[Pro Fro Week] — it showed [fresh
man visiting Stanford] that there is a
Jewish presence on campus," Latz
said, explaining another important
aspect of the event."And for other
ethnic groups, it shows that Stanford
does promote diversity among all cul
tures."
Not only does the competition
serve as a medium for Jewish students
to express their identities, it also en
riches the entire Stanford community.
