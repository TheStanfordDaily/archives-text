### Michael G. Nichols 
I \ lose your eyes. Picture being back in the
I I Mother Land, at your cousin Yael's wed
\J ding. The family's all around, raising large
glasses of vayn (wine) in a jolly toast. The
mood of the evening is grand and all are just a
little tipsy on good food and drink. You're with
your relatives and almost enjoying yourself.
Just when you thought the party couldn't
get any better, the band — complete with up
right bass, fiddle, slide trombone, drums, tam
bourine, coronet, piano, banjo, clarinet, man
dolin and saxophone— starts to rip it up. The
urge to dance wells up in your soul, and some
one shouts "Praise Mordecai and curse
Haitian!"
Thought its roots can be traced hack to Me
dieval Europe, Klezmer music came to Amer
ica with Jewish emigrants and was originally
heard in clubs and the Yiddish theater. Origi
nally, the music was played by traveling musi
cians, bards of sorts, who went from town to
town for festivals and Jewish cultural events.
Before coming to America, Klezmer had
evolved into a well-defined musical style that
found inspiration not only in religious ritual
and culture, but also from the secular and
non-Jewish society around it.
Once in the U.S., Klezmer changed yet
again, influenced by the discovery of new in
struments and rhythms. But while, for many
years, this was what this form of Yiddish jazz
remained, the Klezmer Conservatory Band is
working to revive and change it once again.
In a concert this past Saturday evening, the
nine proved that they are about more than just
historical music. While much of their reper

toire is tradi
tional, they re
arrange it to fit
their sense of
celebratory
style which
can be de
scribed as

nothing less than inspired revelry.
While something of the charm of the band
was lost to the vast space within which they
played, the spirit was certainly there. The band

performed a
wonderful set
of songs with
folk lyrics like
"abi gezunt,
ken men glik
lekh zayn" ("as
long as your

are healthy you can be happy"), that touches
the romantic peasant in all of us while teaching
lessons of life and truth.
Often tales of love tinged with humorous

anecdotes, Klezmer was most frequently heard
at weddings. As such, a song that starts with
the romantic crooning "semietzhkef er knakh"
("I crack sunflower seeds for her") may be fol
lowed by another sung by one mother-in-law
to another, one warning the other to tell her
son to be kind to the bride, since the newlywed
can dish out just what she gets. And speaking
of getting, these songs didn't shy away from
that other aspect of marriage either: "Ay, s'ez a
mekhaye beser ken nit zayn" ("Oh the plea
sure, it can't get any better").
ludy Bressler, a lively and boisterous
woman with perfect Yiddish, sings for the
band almost exclusively in the music's native
tongue. This ensemble numbers nine, on par
with their large, brassy sound. The two pre
mier musicians are Ilene Stahl, whose whole
body shakes like a snake charmer when play
ing the clarinet, and violinist Miriam Rabson,
whose two contemporary compositions
proved to be the highlight of the concert.
How good is Klezmer Conservatory Band?
How many other groups have the oomph to
make tight-shirted professors looking for little
more than a sedate, if pleasant, evening out ac
tually get up and dance?
Yes, it was a funny sight indeed, to see hun
dreds of strangers joining hands, parading
around in a great chain through the isles of
Mem Aud. The young were linked to the old,
Jew to Gentile, race to race. It was a wonderful
family spirit, created for a moment amongst
people who may never meet again.
It's almost enough to make this sensitive,
'90s gov cry.
