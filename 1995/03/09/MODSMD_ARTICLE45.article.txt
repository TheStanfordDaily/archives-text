Kustomized conjurcs up images of
"American Graffiti" on steroids: Nihilistic
James Dean-clone greasers cruise down the
streets of Peoria in souped-up hot rods, scar
ing elderly couples, intimidating their nerdy
peers and making the young girls swoon.
Combining elements of Cramps rockabilly,
Elvis-style bluesy snarl, a pinch of surf and
raw production, Kustomized could justifi
ably be labeled a "garage band" in the actual
sense. Likewise, "The Battle For Space" is a

"The Battle For Space"
Kustomized

big testosterone-driven album, but it's not
without a sense of humor.
The genre of garage-rock is marked by the
use of vintage tube amplifiers, dumb -ass gui
tar riffs, Neanderthal drumming an J bloody
infectious yell-along choruses. These quali
ties are prevalent throughout "The Battle For
Space." "The Day I Had Some Fun' kicks off
the album with all the bombast of an Archers
of Loaf single. Then they follow with more
simple yet dangerously seductive one-chord
wonders like "The sth" and "33 1/?."

After six quick roadburners, however,
"The Rattle For Space" takes a strange but
not altogether unpleasant turn. After getting
the listener's juices flowing, Kustomized
throws in"The Place Where The People
Meet," a mid-tempo chugger that hypnotizes
with a snake-charmer riff and brings in dark,
minor-key flutes near the end. "Phantas
magoria, Now" continues with upbeat,
droning organ from Stereolab circa "Jenny
Ondioline." "La Geune" appears to be an in
strumental continuation of "Phantasmago
ria, Now" with creepy organ noises.
While rather lopsided, "The Battle For
Space" is a diverse album by garage-rock
standards. Admittedly, Kustomized sounds
like a major-label version of a garage band,
cleaner and more drug-free than most. But
as representatives of the garage-rock genre,
they're doing a fine job of turning America's
youths into juvenile delinquents.
