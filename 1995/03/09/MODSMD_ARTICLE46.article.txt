## 'Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool' 
### 
In the pop music scene, where artists are
changeling, quality is erratic and musical
trends are as fluid as running water, the
phrase Red Hot has come to represent the
unusual combination of good music, high
profile artists and consistent activism.

"Stolen Moments:
Red Hot + Cool"
Various artists

Since its insurgent beginnings in 1989,
Rod Hot has kept itself busy in its mission to
tight AIDS through the media of popular
culture. With two albums that sold several
million copies and a controversial network
TV program, Rod Hot has proved that it is
not just another fad. To top it off, this year the
organization has pushed itself even further.
With its third album, the organization tack
les the particular impact of AIDS on black
people and employs the still-emerging fu
sion of jazz, funk and hip-hop styles to do it.
"Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool," the
third Red Hot album, is an experimental
masterpiece. Its impressive roster of artists
includes Guru, Michael Franti, Me' Shell
NdegeOcello, Carleen Anderson, Joshua
Redman and Roy Ayers. Jazz purists won't
be happy because this isn't pure jazz. Hip-

hop aficionados
may find it a mite
mellow, and
funkadelics too for

that matter. Here, the various musical cate
gories don't just stick to their own camps.
Instead, on "Stolen Moments," masterful
collaborations abound between jazz instru
mentalists, hip-hop and funk artists.
Trumpeter Donald Byrd and guitarist
Ronny Jordan join Curu on opening track
"Time is Moving On." Further along, Her
bie Hancock teams up with Me' Shell
NdegeOcello to soothe our souls with "Noc
turnal SunShinc." And then, jamming
Brooklyn-style with Digable Planets are
Lester Bowie and Wah Wah Watson.
Surprisingly enough, despite the number
of luminaries on this project, one of the
most exciting musical moments occurs with
one of its lesser known artists. French rapper
MC Solaar comes very close to stealing the
show with "Un Ange En Danger." Comple
mented by Ron Carter on double bass, So
laar's hypnotic drawl, relentless beats and
unique lyrics conspire to make the song one
of the albums best.
The words of cultural critic Cornel West
can also be found dispersed over the album
jacket. From conspiracy theories regarding
AIDS and the problem of internalized ho
mophobia to the question of unity and the
relationship of hip-hop to the black freedom
struggle, West's words arc as sharp as a
razor's edge and focus the album's discus
sion even more.
