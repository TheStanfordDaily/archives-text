# PJ Harvey brings us her love
## 
### 
I like this album. Too much, in fact.
PJ Harvey's just-released "To Bring You My
Love" is love at first listen — lively electric and
acoustic guitar tracks, blues-inspired back
beats and an unprecedented, tuneful restraint
that is so very, very palatable. But does it go
down too easy?
Until "To Bring You My Love," the beauty
of the British band's frontwoman Polly Jean
Harvey was that she was difficult to like. Let's
face it — she was kind of a bitch. And we loved
her.

"To Bring You My Love"
PJ Harvey

Wailing her guts out, turning thrash guitar
into music-defying noise and spitting out a
"fuck" derivative every fifth word, the Polly
Jean of "Rid of Me" wasn't exactly ear candy.
But for those of us who turned our stereos up
rather than off, her abrasiveness and honesty
rewarded tenfold.
So who's to blame fans of the "old" PJ Har
vey for being a bit disappointed? Here is PJ
Harvey cleaned up, toned down, musically
and emotionally mature. Even Polly Jean, who
wore furry underwear and flashed her hairy
armpit at us in her last album cover ("4-Track
Demos") appears on "To Bring You My
Love" s cover done up like a retro-Hollywood
diva, Naired pits and all.

Yet what saves "To Bring You My Love"
from damnation by dilution is that the soul of
PJ Harvey remains intact, if only contained
within a neater package. If "Rid of Me" was
the unleashing of the subdued rage in its pre
decessor "Dry," "To Bring You My Love" is
the quieter, reflective period after the out
burst.
In the title track, Polly Jean's robust, throaty
voice — punctuated by brilliant moments of
distorted vibrato — brings the almost-lethar
gic blues backbeat together, and somehow the
monotonous guitar eases us into the meaty
vocals.
"To Bring You My Love" also introduces a
quasi-religious undercurrent unfamiliar to PJ
Harvey's usual topics (sex, failed relationships,
more sex), waxing positively spiritual —
"Jesus come closer/1 think my time is near" —
only to double back to a more characteristic
flippancy: "I've lain with the devil/ Cursed
God above/ Forsaken heaven/ To bring you my
love."
The album's best tracks offer fresh revisions
of earlier songs. "Working for the Man" could
be "Rid of Me" sung at a whisper, tightly re
strained and impressively disciplined.
"Teclo" 's slow, hypnotic opening builds into a
driving, repetitive chorus like a less-atonal
"Rub 'Til It Bleeds."
And just to show that really they could still
do the old stuff, "Long Snake Moan" luxuri
ates in a noisy indulgence and a relentless cho
rus ("You — ought — a — hear — my — long
— snake — MOAN!") worthy of classic PJ

Harvey.
Not exactly an ugly-duckling-turned
swan, "To Bring You My Love" 's PJ Harvey is
more a Brillo-Pad-turned-loofah — less abra
sive, but it still scratches the itch.
