# The 						Nonce creates 'World Ultimate,' poised hip-hop with true confidence
## 
### 
True confidence exudes a quiet de
meanor. instead of shouts, The Nonce brings
us soft-spoken and rhythmic rhymes. In
place of pounding beats and overplayed
samples, The Nonce presents a refreshing
blend of relaxing jazz loops and catchy cho
ruses. The result is "World Ultimate," an
album that exhibits poise, not noise.
After listening to a few tracks on this
album, it becomes evident that The Nonce is
working with a well-developed formula.

max in a memorable chorus. The hip-hop
statement ends as gracefully as it began. By
the end of the listening experience, this relax
ing equation defies traditional mathematics;
the sum becomes greater than its musical
parts.
The single that has been receiving the

most attention on this album, "Mix Tapes,"
which actually hit the streets of Los Angeles
in July of 1994 when The Nonce was signed to
a smaller label. The track received acclaim in
both underground and mainstream listening
circles largely because of its memorable sing
a-long-chorus: "I used to sell mixed tapes,
but now I'm an MC/ I've got the rhymes and
beats...
Patient fans who remember this original
release will be equally delighted by The
Nonce's new offerings on "World Ultimate."
"Good To Go," the epitome of soothing
Nonce, is drenched in soft piano and alluring

sound effects. The blend on this track is re
markable, leaving even the most troubled
listener in peace. The chorus chant, in the
distinctive Nonce style, is delightful: "I'm
the mellow, the fellow, the one who likes to
say hello/ To a fly girl that is good to go."
Other standout songs include "On the Air,"
"Eighty Five" and "Keep It On."
Balance is maintained well throughout
this album and egos are kept in check. Don't
let the seemingly arrogant LP title, "World
Ultimate," fool you. The Nonce just knows a
good thing when they make it.
