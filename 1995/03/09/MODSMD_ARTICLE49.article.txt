# The
						Secret Life of the Waterboys' compilation deserves to be drowned out

My impression of the Waterboys' newest
release "The Secret Life of the Waterboys," a
compilation of unreleased songs between
the years of 1981 and 1985, is to leave it as
just that... a secret. For some people it is
the slow circular up-and-down rocking of a
boat that turns them green or nails on a
black board that grates on their nerves. For
me it was the constant chirping of a trum
pet in "Medicine Bow" that pierced the air
in my room, beginning a personal torture

the Water Boys"

session that lasted more than an hour and a
quarter.
My temples began to pound when the
continuous banging of a hard drum re
placed the bird-like trumpet in "That Was
the River." This perpetual beat did not stop
or falter but bounced directly out of the
speakers and into my head.
Too often a single, unchanging sound
drove a song and penetrated the emptiness
between my ears and the speakers. The
piano in "Don't Bang the Drum" sounded
like an antique upright found in an old
Western bar, while the saxophone jarred my

bones in"The Ways of Man." Similar to
smoothing my eardrums with sandpaper, a
single organ tone filled all rests in "A Pagan
Place."
Besides certain instruments that would
not quit, the lack of direction towards a res
olution helped in the personal torture.
Songs often had no particular goal towards
which they were moving but rather just
drove recklessly forward ignoring any red
lights, stop signs or yield triangles.
No sonic difference existed between the
chorus and the verses, and the only indica
tor that the chorus had been reached once
again was the familiarity of words.
1 wondered how they were going to stop
thisout-of-control train that sped along on
a track, and I guessed it had would have to
end in an awful wreck. The songs propelled
themselves forward with no hint ofslowing
down until they were about to hit a time
wall of approximately six minutes.
At this point it was a rush of instruments
and voices that tried to pull the emergency
brake before impact with the wall of time.
The result was a final blast from trumpets
or strike by a piano hammer as the song
came to rest in a pile of broken instruments.
Perhaps they should reconsider their
name, and instead of the Waterboys, become
the Lostboys and do just that — get lost.
