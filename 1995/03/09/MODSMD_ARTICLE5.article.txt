# Fac Sen to continue CIV, DR debate
## 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
As the latest step in its recent initiative
to overhaul Stanford's undergraduate
curriculum, the Faculty Senate today will
continue to deliberate over changes to the
Cultures, Ideas and Values program and
distribution requirements.
The new discussion of cultures re
quirements is the latest phase in the Fac
ulty Senate's drive to reform Stanford's
undergraduate curriculum after a year
long study by the Commission on Under
graduate Education, which released its
final report fall quarter.
The senate steering committee has
drafted a list of three "sense of the sen
ate" resolutions — senate recommenda
tions to the provost and the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies — toward the
goal of reforming the cultures core. The
resolutions will come before the senate
today "for discussion, for modification

and for approval," Senate Chair Bob Si
moni said.
The resolutions are less a creation of
the steering committee than an amalga
mation of various proposals faculty have
presented for reforming CIV, Simoni said.
"It's a consolidation of proposals that
have come from other people," Simoni
said. "[The steering committee] should
get neither credit nor blame."
The first resolution states the senate's
intention to require each CIV track to
cover, in addition to the CIV DR, one ad
ditional DR out of the World Cultures
(Area 2); American Cultures (Area 3); Lit
erature and Fine Arts (Area 7); Philo
sophical, Social and Religious Thought
(Area 8) and Social and Behavioral Sci
ences (Area 9) groups. Students would
then be required to fulfill three of the four
remaining DRs.
In addition, the resolution would
transfer responsibility for certifying
classes for three DRs — Literature and

Fine Arts; Philosophi
cal, Social and Religious
Thought and Social and
Behavioral Sciences —
from the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies
to the departments of
fering the courses.
The second resolu
tion recommends that
the School of Humani-

ties and Sciences Curriculum Committee
conduct regular reviews to determine how
well CIV meets its founding objectives
and to help smooth out differences in
workload and grading across the various
CIV tracks.
The third resolution calls on the
provost to establish a committee to per
form a deeper, more comprehensive study
of the underlying mission and objectives
of CIV and the DR system. The review


Simoni
could include an investigation of
the overall justification for cul
tures and breadth requirements,
the resolution says.
Simoni said the steering com
mittee drafted the resolutions
with the goal of "coming back and
putting something together that
we think satisfies everyone."
But the resolutions will not
satisfy everyone, Simoni said, so
they will be open for discussion at
today's senate meeting.
History Prof. Paul Seaver,
director of the CIV program, said
he had some concerns with the
first two resolutions but did not
strongly object to them.
"The first [resolution] is, I
think, not the way I would have
done it, but I think it will work,"
Seaver said.
Seaver previously proposed a
reform under which each CIV
track would cover one additional
DR — but CIV tracks could opt to
not replace the World Cultures or
American Cultures requirements.
Seaver voiced more serious
reservations about the third reso
lution calling for a new committee
to reevaluate CIV and DRs. He
said such a committee's work
would simply duplicate the work
of the Commission on Undergrad
uate Education.

"It's redoing [the commission]
all over again," Seaver said.
"What are they going to do that
[the commission] didn't do?"
Seaver added that it might be
awkward if two committees — the
review committee of the second
resolution and the provost's com
mittee of the third resolution —
conducted simultaneous investi
gations of CIV.
The Humanities and Sciences
Faculty Council similarly objects
to the third resolution, according
to History Prof. Judith Brown, a
member of the council.
"[The council] didn't like it
because they thought .. . that it
was redundant ... or at the very
least that it was premature."
Brown said the council gener
ally agreed with Seaver that the
review committee proposed in the
second resolution should be
allowed to begin its work before
the proposed provost's committee
began its evaluation.
Brown, Seaver and Simoni said
they were pleased with recent
progress in the faculty discussion
on the cultures core.
"I think [CIV] is getting the
discussion that it needs to get,
and there will be more, I'm sure,"
Brown said.
Also at the Faculty Senate
meeting, University President
Gerhard Casper is expected to
make a statement on the recent
court ruling which overturned
Stanford's speech code.
