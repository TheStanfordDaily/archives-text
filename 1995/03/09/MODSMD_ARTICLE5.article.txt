# Fac Sen to continue CIV, DR debate
## 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
As the latest step in its recent initiative
to overhaul Stanford's undergraduate
curriculum, the Faculty Senate today will
continue to deliberate over changes to the
Cultures, Ideas and Values program and
distribution requirements.
The new discussion of cultures re
quirements is the latest phase in the Fac
ulty Senate's drive to reform Stanford's
undergraduate curriculum after a year
long study by the Commission on Under
graduate Education, which released its
final report fall quarter.
The senate steering committee has
drafted a list of three "sense of the sen
ate" resolutions — senate recommenda
tions to the provost and the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies — toward the
goal of reforming the cultures core. The
resolutions will come before the senate
today "for discussion, for modification

and for approval," Senate Chair Bob Si
moni said.
The resolutions are less a creation of
the steering committee than an amalga
mation of various proposals faculty have
presented for reforming CIV, Simoni said.
"It's a consolidation of proposals that
have come from other people," Simoni
said. "[The steering committee] should
get neither credit nor blame."
The first resolution states the senate's
intention to require each CIV track to
cover, in addition to the CIV DR, one ad
ditional DR out of the World Cultures
(Area 2); American Cultures (Area 3); Lit
erature and Fine Arts (Area 7); Philo
sophical, Social and Religious Thought
(Area 8) and Social and Behavioral Sci
ences (Area 9) groups. Students would
then be required to fulfill three of the four
remaining DRs.
In addition, the resolution would
transfer responsibility for certifying
classes for three DRs — Literature and

Fine Arts; Philosophi
cal, Social and Religious
Thought and Social and
Behavioral Sciences —
from the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies
to the departments of
fering the courses.
The second resolu
tion recommends that
the School of Humani-

ties and Sciences Curriculum Committee
conduct regular reviews to determine how
well CIV meets its founding objectives
and to help smooth out differences in
workload and grading across the various
CIV tracks.
The third resolution calls on the
provost to establish a committee to per
form a deeper, more comprehensive study
of the underlying mission and objectives
of CIV and the DR system. The review
