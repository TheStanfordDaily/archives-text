# Drink up Milk: It does a party good
## 
### 
Forget apologies, Milk doesn't need
them. With a brash style that has earned him
more than enough money to satisfy his cal
cium requirements, Milk is out to make sure
that you get yours ... even it he has to force
it down your throat. "Never Dated," Milks
first solo project since parting ways with the
pioneering ensemble Audio Two, is brutally
rude and outspoken. And once you take a sip
of this curdled concoction, its creator will
gladly laugh in your face.
A quick listen to "Spam,"

which features the
Beast ie Boys' Ad

Rock in a ret
rospective

old school
rendition,
provides a
sample of
Milk's out
spoken per

sonality: "I'll spit
at the crowd and curse

at the ref/Scream on the mic till
you all go deaf." In the appropriately titled
"Rude and Cocky," Milk extends his warm
affect further: "I'll get hated, and I'll get
hype/ Get your name, address, and height/
Then take it out on your dog or your cat/
Break up your window with a baseball bat."
Underneath Milk's braggadocios and
crass rhymes are instrumental tracks that
are equally in-your-face. Each song is pow-

"Never Dated"
Milk

ered by a heavy drum beat and matter-of
fact samples, all reinforcing Milk's barbaric
musings. An exception to the rule comes to
those who wait until the end of this EP,
when the opening track, "Get off My Log,"
is reworked in a smoother

format. With the

help of female
singers The

J a z z y 112 a t -
n a s t e e s,
"Th e
Jazzyfat
woody
Remix" is

hopefully
what listeners

can expect on
Milk's next take: well

chosen jazz samples and non
abrasive drum beats.
For anyone who has problems with Milks
outspoken personality, "Never Dated" may
not be on the top of the wish list. But for
those who can enjoy a few sour sips, Milk is
the cream that rises to the top, no matter
how cocky it is.
