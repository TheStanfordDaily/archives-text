# Lilys' 'Eccsame' beautiful, addictive

I.ilys first burst onto the indie-rock scene in
1992 with the release of "In The Presence of
Nothing," a muddy sandstorm of thick guitar
effects and heavenly melodies. At the time,
they were hailed as the successors to My

"Eccsame the
Photon Band"
Lilys

Bloody Valentine's shoegazer legacy. Indeed,
the Lilys certainly owed a great deal of their
sound to MBV, but they had a different ap
proach to songwriting, one that was less Eng
lish and more American-style rock.
In 1994, any remaining references to
shoegazer were smashed to bits on the 1994 HP
"A Brief History of Amazing Letdowns," an ac
cessible collection of clean, straightforward
summer-y pop, reminiscent of Pavement,
Smashing Pumpkins and the Beatles. But

nothing can prepare listeners for what awaits
them on "Eccsame the Photon Band." The
Lilys not only reach for the stars, they soar high
above all expectations.
Instead of the edgy, suffocated guitars on
"In The Presence Of Nothing," "Eccsame the
Photon Band" sweeps all extraneous noise
away, leaving an emptier space in which to
carve out sound. They take their time doing so,
slowing down the tempo to a deliberate crawl.
Songs like "High Writer at Home" and"The
Turtle Which Died Before Knowing" feature
quiet background drones, complementing
frontman Kurt Heasley's fragile, wispy vocals
to create an impression both sad and joyful.
On the"Day of the Monkey," Beatles-esque
melodies spiral around shimmering, clean
guitars, while "Overlit Canyon" first expands
the space within the listener's head with more
reverb than the Grifters, then fills that space
with layered guitar lines, each one distinctly
memorable.
However, the centerpiece of this album is

undeniably "The Hermit Crab," a huge stratos
pheric rocker with guitars that chime like wed
ding bells. "Radiotricity" also takes a cue from
earlier work, with a twisted guitar riff, decon
structed song structure, and harmonies that
ring in your ears for days afterward.
It is the hallmark of an excellent artist to cre
ate a CD that is imperfect, yet hints at the po
tential for perfection. "Eccsame the Photon

Band" is that album for Lilys. With the excep
tion of a few short, irritating studio outtakes
that interrupt the album's continuity, this
album is the most incredible, beautiful, addic
tive thing I've heard in as long time. Teetering
on the twin edges of despair and elation, Lilys
may be the best underground band in Ameri
ca. You will not be disappointed.
