## Thrills lack depth in 'Shallow Grave' 
### 
If "Pulp Fiction" and "Natural Born Killers" had firm
ly established 1994 as the year celluloid gore became the
hippest of pop-cultural artifacts, 1995 looks set to witness
a global Quentinization of cinema that promises to leave
no local industry unscathed.
Not that the Scottish-made "Shallow Grave" fetishizes
smoldering guns with the Biblical fervor shown by Jules
in "Pulp Fiction" — all "Shallow Grave" does to its audi
ence is make sure that no visit to the neighborhood hard-

ware store will ever be the same
again.
That the movie's entire
premise is easily summarized in
one sentence has helped bring
this low-budget import to the
Gump-filled multiplex nearest

Shallow
Grave

you: Three friends find a dead body in their apartment
hut are distracted from notifying the proper authorities
hy a suitcase of cash under the bed.
The man who perishes from drug overdose — Hugo
(Keith Allen) — happens to be none other than the new
flat-mate whom the trio had agreed upon just hours be
fore. After deciding to keep the money and dispose of the
corpse, the bespectacled accountant David (Christopher
Eccleston), lands the honor of digging the grave and dis
figuring all of Hugo's identifiable remains.
What his other two pals — the journalist Alex (Ewan
McGregor), and the doctor luliet (Kerry Fox from "An
Angel at My Table") — have not bargained for is a David

who emerges de
ranged and obsessive
from the trenches
upon completion of
his gruesome task.

Soon, the dead man's shadowy past and a sus
picious police detective begin to catch up with the three
overnight millionaires.
Undeniably, "Shallow Grave" contains several delight
ful set-pieces that prove quite a treat for the senses. Set to
an arresting hi-NRG soundtrack, the opening credits are
accompanied by the camera's whirlwind, high-speed
romp through the Edinburgh avenues and alleys.
A hilarious interrogation of prospective flat-mates for
Alex, Juliet and David is then staged amid the exaggerat
ed, expressionistic interiors of their New Town apart
ment, reminiscent of the baroque color-coded splendor
of Peter (ireenaway's "The Cook, the Thief, his Wife and
her Lover."
It is a pity "Shallow Grave" then proceeds to sag no
ticeably in the middle, drowning itself in all sorts of text
book Hitchcockian cliches — spiral stairways and vertig
inous spins galore — until it decides to perk itself up at
the end. Indeed, the appropriately wicked conclusion
sheds a whole new light on the complexities of loyalty,
friendship and betrayal.
Director Danny Boyle is clearly intent on proving that
Hollywood's transatlantic rivals are equally adept at fash
ioning the pitch-dark comedy-thriller genre for far less
money, but complete with equally scant regard for char
acterization. "Shallow Grave" may boast of a sharp turn
here and a hair-raising dip there. What Boyle has yet to
master isTarantino'sthrill-a-minute metaphysical joyride
from which no passenger would want to disembark.
