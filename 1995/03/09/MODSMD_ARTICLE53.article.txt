# 'Strawberry and Chocolate' is a film feast of flavor and friendship
## 
### 
"Strawberry and Chocolate" is more
scrumptious than a triple scoop of Cherry
Garcia.
Cuban director Tomas Gutierrez Alea's lat
est flick is a light 'n' luscious treat for all cine
maniacs. It'll make you laugh. It'll make you
reflect. It'll make you feel vital enough to skin
ny-dip in Lake Lag.
In "Strawberry and Chocolate," we meet
David (Vladimir Cruz), a Cuban university
student with a penchant for Communist pro
paganda and women with hourglass figures
(you could say that he likes to play in the sand).
At the beginning of the film, the audience
immediately recognizes that things ain't
groovalicious for David. His government
sponsored education is just a rehash of mind
clouding propaganda, and his hot-babe fi
ancee has just married another man. However,
when he sits down at an outdoor cafe to enjoy

Strawberry
and
Chocolate

a cup of choco
late ice cream,
his so-called life
changes.
Spooning
away at his

melting dessert,
David is approached by a way-too-forward ho
mosexual named Diego. Diego (Jorge Peru
gorria) is a middle-aged photographer with an
affinity for strawberry ice cream, metaphysical
poets, overly flamboyant hand gestures and
firm, fresh manhood. At the cafe, he attempts
to win a bet by luring David away from his
chocolate ice cream and into his apartment.
At first, David is disgusted by Diego's be
havior and hastily ends their conversation.
However, he seeks out Diego a few days later
when he is asked to gain evidence to malign the
photographer as a counterrevolutionary.

Although Diego's original intent is to se
duce the young student, he abandons his bet.
He transforms his pursuit for a one-night
stand into a pursuit for everlasting friendship.
Although David's original intent is to malign
Diego, he abandons the investigation. He, like
Diego, transforms deception into friendship.
The formation of a lasting friendship be
tween a young, heterosexual Communist and a
middle-aged, homosexual counterrevolution
ary seems quite unlikely. However, the film
manages to depict the gradual development of
their friendship with subtle, tender and believ
able exposition. The dialogue is carefully writ
ten, revealing both the backgrounds and idio
syncrasies of the film's characters. For exam
ple, one memorable exchange in the film oc
curs when David says"Truman Capote
dropped the A-bomb ... oh, 1 mean Harry
Truman," causing Diego to passionately re

spond "Truman Capote, never! He was homo
sexual!"
Jorge Perugorria's portrayal of the counter
revolutionary Epicurean is delightful. Despite
his use of hyper-dramatic voice and body lan
guage, Perugorria's Diego is not depicted as a
campy caricature. Rather, he comes across as a
bold defender of Communist-free culture.
"Strawberry and Chocolate" reminds the
audience that individuals can love in spite of
politics ... and that bad pick-up lines over ice
cream can be the start of an incredible friend
ship.
