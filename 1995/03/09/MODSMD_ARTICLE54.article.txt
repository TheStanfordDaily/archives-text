# Stay away from 'Mouth of Madness'
## 
### 
The new John Carpenter film "In the
Mouth of Madness" is a comic horror — an
experiment gone terribly wrong.
John Trent (Sam Neill) is an insurance
fraud investigator who is a master at his
trade. As a reward, he is sent on really hot as
signment. He must track down the Stephen
King-like horror writer Sutter Cane (Jurgen
Prochnow) who disappeared just weeks be
fore he was expected to deliver his latest man
uscript. His work supposedly hypnotizes and
horrifies his readers, making them lose their
senses.
Cane's publisher (Charlton Heston in a
cameo) hires Trent to investigate the disap
pearance and bring back the manuscript.

Trent suspects that all the drama is a publici
ty stunt.
He then sets himself the task of familiariz
ing himself with Cane's works and finds him
self terrorized by the books. And while Cane's
fans are literally going nuts and attacking all
the bookstores in town screaming for the
movie's namesake novel, "In the Mouth of
Madness," Trent sets off to find Sutter Cane
with the predictably sexy editor of Cane's
books, Linda Styles (Julie Carmen). They
head toward Hobbs End, a tiny town in New
England which puzzlingly only exists in
Cane's imagination.
Until this point the audience is totally with
the director, completely enthralled in the plot

In the
Mouth of Madness

and eager to see it unfold. But alas, it never
does.
Once in Hobbs End, everything stops
making any sense. The detective duo find
Cane there. Styles progressively loses her san
ity as she comes in touch with Cane, and by
the end of the movie she is a goner.
After a series of frustrating incidents,
Trent manages to get hold of the manuscript
— that he now doesn't want — and gets out
of Hobbs End where the Doberman Pinsch
ers are more terrifying than the swiggly re

pulsive monsters.
Once in the real world, the movie turns
even more bizarre. It is time for some more
confusion and lots and lots of questions. Be
lieve me, you're not going to get the answers
by watching the movie.
At some point in the movie, the plot thins
and thins and completely disappears. It all
becomes a mesh of disjointed scenes and re
sembles a show tape of some special-effects
company. Neither the humans nor the slimy
creatures have any character. Every third
scene is a bloodily mutilated face or a man
with a bloody ax, but it doesn't make your
blood curdle at all: a huge disappointment.
Apart from some clever lines and cute cuts
the movie has little entertainment value.
