Billy Madison
"Billy Madison" flunks miserably.
The plot is ridiculous and uninterest
ing, the cast is at odds with the stale
script, and Sandler comes off as an
noying and pathetic.
The failure emphasizes Sandler is
at his best as a supporting comic.
While not the center of attention, his
comedy can be refreshing and hilar
ious, but when a film is a vehicle for
it, the results are simply painful.
Nina Takes a Lover
"Nina Takes a Lover:" Nina (Laura
San Giacomo) meets a photograph
er (Paul Rhys) — a mysterious, sexy
Brit — with whom she begins a
whirlwind affair. Nina's friend (Cristi
Conaway) has an extra-marital affair
with the comical Paulie (Fisher
Stevens), a skanky coffee shop em

ployee who lives with his mom and
steals Nina's underwear when they
borrow her apartment for a tryst.
"Nina Takes a Lover," is brim
ming with that warm, fuzzy feeling
people get when they fall in love, go
through trials to sustain passion, but
triumph in the end.
Tom and Viv
"Tom and Viv" explores Eliot's
(Willem Dafoe) marriage to Vivienne
Haigh-Wood (Miranda Richardson)
between 1914 and 1947.
Writer Michael Hastings adapted
his incisive, literate script from his
play. Director Brian Gilbert's work
manlike but quietly stirring interpre
tation undoes the suppression of
Viv's existence by the late poet's
zealous camp even further.

Once Were Warriors
Based on a controversial novel by
Alan Duff, "Once Were Warriors," a
tale of a contemporary Maori family
living in urban New Zealand, offers a
raw vision of the Heke family. Beth
(Rena Owen) a mother of five,
struggles to maintain a home for her
family while Jake (Temuera Morri
son), her husband, spends most of
his time at a local pub drinking.
While the the Heke's connection
to their indigenous past is unevenly
portrayed — the bulk of this mes
sage appearing at the end of the
story — the film narrowly escapes
being sentimental or preachy.
The film's strength lies in its por
trayal of how ancestral practices can
enrich modern life. Aside from sheer
beauty, they are crucial to a concep
tion of self. We are left with a com-

pelling meditation on the lives of a
people who, once, were warriors.
Before the Rain
Milcho Manchevski's award-win
ning debut, "Before the Rain,"
opens with a young monk (Gregoire
Colin) encountering Zamira (Labina
Mitevska), a mysterious girt hiding in
his room.
In "Faces" and "Pictures," we en
counter photo editor Anne (Katrin
Cartlidge), her lover, war photogra
pher Aleksandar Kirkov (Rade
Serbedzija), and Anne's husband
Nick (Jay Villiers).
Beautifully shot, "Before the Rain"
is a circular narrative that makes use
of three simple stories to explore the
pitfalls of ethnic conflict in the former
Yugoslavia leaving us with the in
delible power of possibility.
