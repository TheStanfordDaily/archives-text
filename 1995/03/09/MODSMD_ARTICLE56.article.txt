## Babak A. Ebrahimian Re(de)fining Art: 'Halting the contagion' 
### 
If there are two words which should
be erased from our common day vo
cabulary, they are: "art" and "cul
ture." These words have virtually lost all
meaning. Anything that enters our cultural
system and is framed can be called art. The
words "art" and "culture" no longer possess
their original significance but instead have
gained a high degree of political value. The
question today lies between art and politics,
and the politics of art. And close to politics
you can always smell something rotten: just
as all roads lead to Rome, all politics lead to
Death.
Our contemporary culture is, for the most
part, inseparable from politics — and there
fore Death. My objective here is not to try to
explain or undo the complex web of the
problems of the NEA (that would be too po
litical on my part) but rather, my aim is to
show how most of our culture today has be
come a cousin to Death.
Death, Art, Culture — the words almost
seem interchangeable. Where does one
begin? Any strand of culture you unfold will
lead to the same final destination: to a grave.
For my part, I choose the strand of film — the
most appropriated form of the arts.
How does Death exist within the art of
film? It exists in two degrees: the first degree
is the injection of Death into the frame; and
the second degree is its worshipping.
When you think of great filmmakers, de
Sica, Fellini, Chaplin, Renoir, Tarkovsky,
Wenders, Kurosawa, Capra and a dozen oth
ers come to mind. Even if each one of these
filmmakers had made only one great film, for
each of these (which no one knows, no one
wants to know or no one wants to watch)
there arc at least one hundred corresponding
deadly non-masterpieces.
These deadly non-masterpieces are pre
cisely what the public demands and enjoys.
The public finds them beautiful, extraordi
nary, entertaining and worthwhile. But
rather than giving my black list of these non

films and non-artists, I will try my best to ex
plain exactly what makes the black list black.
The fact is simple: art has become a
business and anyone can go into it.
There is no need for any craft, thought
or integrity. The rule: the product 1 in this
case film | must sell. And what sells? Anything
that is modeled after MTV + Violence + Sex.
This equation yields a multitude of well com
posed, beautiful shots (frames) that contain
sensuality or eroticism and violence. Implic
itly in the equation is a rapid pace of presen
tation — a high montage — that leaves no
room for boredom, contemplation, medita
tion or thought.
This standard formula is determined by
both the public and Hollywood. Its unfair to
simply blame the industry for this. After all,
it takes two to tango. The film "The Player,"
directed by Robert Altman (director of the
film "M* A\S*H" who was once black listed
from I lollywood), elaborates on the formula.
Altman's version of the equation: Sex + Vio
lence + Lots of stars + Rapid pace + A happy
ending. This produces a marketable film that
will win all the awards and much praise from
its viewers. Unfortunately, Altman's formula
is not so tar away from reality. Such is the
hunger of our society.
To illustrate: pay a few dollars and see the
well-acclaimed film "The Cook, The Thief,
His Wife, and Her Lover." The film is nothing
but a beautified version of the sickness of its
British director, Peter Cireenaway.Greenaway
"ripped off" Fellini's aesthetics, A to Z (using
other signatures of course — costumes by
Jean-Paul Gaultier and music by Michael
Neyman), to glorify his own illness: his pas
sion for hell, death, perverse torture and pure
excrement (literally, not metaphorically).
This defecation — though fully visible, fully
black and smelly — nevertheless was pre
sented in such a beautiful manner, in such an
aesthetically pleasing style, that it left no
space for the viewers for to reject it. The au

dience walked out praising the film while si
multaneously digesting the glorified defeca
tion.
This is where my problem starts and ends:
art is not here to stuff defecation down peo
ples' throats in the guise of beauty and
"truth." This is usually called fascism. The
role of art is to shed light upon and criticize
the human condition in a constructive man
ner; to reflect illuminations; to point to
wards truth. To use art to glorify defecation
is not far from Hitlerism, Stalinism or Mu
solinism.
Art and fascism are antonyms, and it is the
fault of today's culture when the two become
doubles. When Lynch and Kubrick make glo
rious films to criticize violence, they arc di
rectly promoting and propagating it. Rumor:
it was Kubrick himself who banned "Clock
work Orange" in England, knowing well
what contagious effect it would have on the
youth and the skinheads. Though I am a con
siderable admirer of Lynch and Kubrick as
great craftsmen — and I'll even admit that
"Clockwork Orange" is one of the most well
crafted films ever — I cannot approve of
them as great artists, nor of their films as
great art. Not everything beautiful and with
in a frame can be called art. "Beauty shall no
longer be forbidden" writes Helene Cixous.
This is true — yes. Yet one must go beyond
and realize that beauty needs to be a sec
ondary criteria.
Artists have a social responsibility, just
as doctors and first-grade teachers do.
And to be an artist, to create art, is an
immense responsibility. In the same way the
doctor has obligations towards his / hei pa
tient, the artist has a responsibility towards
his / her viewers.
The wrong medication will kill the pa
tient; the right one will cure him / her. The
wrong substance framed will disturb and de
stroy the spirit of the viewer; the right sub
stance will uplift and inspire him / her.

What goes in that frame, before being
beautified (so as to be called art), is of prima
ry importance. It can strengthen viewers or
damage them; it can elevate their spirits, or it
can numb them. Pointer: It's not religion that
is the opiate of the masses — it's contempo
rary television. Alice Walker: "If art is not
supposed to make us better human beings
what good is it for?"
From another part of the world, from a
completely different culture, the same point
is voiced by a second great artist, Federico
Fellini: "The important thing for man today
is to hang on, not to let his head droop but to
keep looking up along the tunnel, perhaps
even inventing a way of salvation through
fantasy or will power, and especially through
faith. For this reason I think that the work of
artists is really needed today."
Throughout the past five years, while
staging plays such as "The Wedding," "City
of Refuge" and "Fragments of an America,"
a fellow artist, whom I admire a great deal,
kept rejecting these works as "hollow,
empty and devoid of meaning." The last play
he saw was "The Wedding," and right before
he left he pointed out a short sentence to
me, one which made no sense at the time be
cause of a single word. The sentence was a
piece of advice Gandhi gave to a group of
artists: "Find beauty in Truth. Not Truth in
beauty."
It took me four years to understand what
"Truth" was and how it related to art, artists
and my personal life. Today, if I were to
identify the single most important rule
in art, it would be this: Art needs to be at
the service of Truth.
Truth: there's the reason why great art
never dies, why it remains forever "eter
nal." The claim that Walker and Fellini
are making cannot be sheer coincidence.
Somewhere in it there must be an ounce
of Truth.
