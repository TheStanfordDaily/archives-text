# New policy threatens some frats' housing
## Residents of frat houses must be 90% members 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
Starting this year, fraternities will
have to fill 90 percent of their house with
members in order to keep it, University
officials recently announced.
The new policy was implemented a few
weeks ago in an effort to prevent fraterni
ty houses from being overrun by non
members, who fraternities are allowed to
take in as boarders to fill their houses, ac
cording to Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Heather Dunn.
After Fraternity Rush, which takes
place the second week of spring quarter,

any fraternity not able to make the 90 per
cent will receive a warning to bring its
numbers up, Dunn said. If a fraternity
drops below 75 percent, it will lose its
house, she said.
In the past, the houses that allowed
borders tended to have more trouble,
Dunn said. "Tension in the house runs
high" when there are too many boarders,
she added, and the University doesn't
want to see fraternities become boarding
houses.
Though several fraternity presidents
agreed that their houses should be com-
prised mainly of members, some,
like Interfraternity Council presi
dent Earl Stolz and Kappa Alpha
president Adam Nash, said that
boarders weren't much of a prob
lem in their houses. However,
they added that other fraternities
had experienced trouble in the
past.
Some of the fraternity presi
dents said they were also con
cerned about the new policy's
restrictions.
"It seems like having this hard
line is inappropriate," Nash said,
calling the 90 percent policy
"ridiculous." It doesn't account
for the "seasonal fluctuations"
that a fraternity experiences, he
added.
Dunn, however, said, "It's not
a black-and-white situation any

way." The University will consid
er extenuating circumstances,
like fraternity members who are
studying overseas, when they
make decisions.
The University, she said, is
just trying to "work with students
to help them to be strong, viable
organizations."
Stolz said that although the
new policy could be "unfortunate
for current houses, [it could] be
good for fraternities that have
large memberships and are look
ing for a house."
Dunn added that she hopes no
fraternity will lose its house.
However, the new policy could
adversely affect several fraterni
ties — mainly the KAs and Beta
Theta Pi — who expect to lose
many members this year to grad
uation.
Both fraternities need a pledge
class of approximately 20 this
year to meet the new University
criteria.
