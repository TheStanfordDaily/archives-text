With a $3.1 million federal grant from
the National Institutes of Health this
year, the Department of Radiology will
continue its preeminence in the field of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tech
nology.
Radiology Prof. Gary Glover, principal
investigator for the grant, said that Stan
ford will be using the funds to increase de
velopment of MRI technology and to con
tinue research in the medical field.
"We're doing a lot of work on cardiovas
cular imaging," said Glover. "Also, we're
doing research with spectroscopy, examin
ing the chemistry of the cell, its inner
processes and neurological functions."
Other projects the grant will fund in
clude imaging and mapping of the brain
and its functions. In addition, MRIs could
eventually be used as a tool for pre-surgi
cal treatments to improve prognosis.
Glover added that the Radiology De
partment plans to develop new MRI tech
nology in cooperation with researchers
across the nation.
Stanford will serve as a national "infor
mation repository" on MRI technology,
Glover said. MRI research performed as
part of this program will be available to
anyone who needs it. The program will be

unique in that it will be the only facility in
the nation devoted to both investigation
and dissemination of MRI research infor
mation.
"NIH gave the money to Stanford to es
tablish the Lucas Center Radiological
Labs as a National Research Resource,"
Glover said. "We are one of eight total in
the country receiving grants from the NIH
to do this type of research," he said.
Glover added that this program will
provide a "fundamental building block"
for researchers who don't have access to
facilities of Stanford's caliber.
"The cost that surrounds most magnet
ic imaging research projects makes them
cost-prohibitive," Glover said. "This way,
scientists and researchers from anywhere
can collaborate and take advantage of our
information and facilities for use in their
research.
"We intend to make this resource very
open," he added.
But while the grant money is to be
spent solely on research, Glover said he
hopes that the technologies developed will
someday lead to marketplace applications.
"Our primary goal is not diminished
cost," Glover said. "Our primary responsi
bility is to researchers. But of course it is
hoped that the benefits of our research will
