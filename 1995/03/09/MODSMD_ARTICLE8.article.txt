# Author Seth explains work
## Casper invites writer to Farm 
### Soumya V. Raman Contributing writer 
Twenty years ago, a young Indian Oxford graduate
began his 11-year pursuit of a Ph.D. in economics at
Stanford, a quest that led him all the way to China. And
somewhere along the way, he decided to abandon his
dissertation to write books.
Vikram Seth returned home to Stanford this week —
his first visit since the tumultuous success of his latest
novel, "A Suitable Boy" — at University President Ger
hard Casper's personal invitation.
In a reading last night Seth engaged and entertained
a nearly full Kresge Auditorium with selected pieces of
his work and answered questions from the audience. He
also autographed copies of "The Suitable Boy."
At his reading, Seth declared that he owed a tremen
dous debt to Stanford for allowing him to labor in the
vineyards of research.
Seth owes more than an unfinished dissertation to
Stanford. It was here that he wrote "The Golden Gate,"
a novel in verse which hurled him into the limelight and
has been described as a book about life, love and lust set
in the Bay Area in the 1980s. Seth captures many things
familiar to Stanford residents in"The Golden Gate" —
like Palo Alto's Printer's Inc. Bookstore.
In his opening address, Casper joked about the size of


Teressa Trusty — Daily
Author Vikram Seth, a Stanford alumnus, came back to campus
at the request of University President Gerhard Casper to read
from his work in Kresge last night.
Seth's 1,300-page novel. "The
hard cover edition (of 'The Suit
able Boy') put my life in jeopardy,
since it occasionally fell on my
chest and almost suffocated me,"
Casper said.
In fact, Seth has a word of cau
tion for the reader. His book
begins with a "health warning"
that reads: "Buy me before your
sense insists, you'll strain your
purse and sprain your wrists." At
the reading, he suggested that
readers should buy a paperback
edition and slit up the book into
little chunks to read at their own
pace.
In an earlier interview, Seth
discussed the characters and the
setting of his new book. Since
"The Suitable Boy" is set in India
in the 19505, Seth said he is sur
prised at the overwhelming
response from the West for a
novel that has so many Indian ref
erences in it. He claims that he
did not intend to aim at any sec
tion of the world.
"I just wanted to tell a story,"

he said. According to Seth, his
book is a simple, straightforward
love story with a strong parental
influence on the people involved.
The politics, economics and reli
gious conditions of the time act
simultaneously as a kind of fore
ground and background to his
tale, he said.
Seth did not intend for the
book to serve as a crash course on
India or to focus on issues like
religious tolerance or political
unrest: "If I try to preach with my
book, it will die," he said.
"I am following the story of
these various people," Seth said.
He said he wrote about these
characters because he was
intrigued by the nature of their
lives and wanted to express their
feelings in conversations and
actions as much as he could. Seth
added that he drew a lot from peo
ple he has known in creating his
characters. "There are bits of me
in every character," he added.
Seth said that, while novels are
usually appreciated for the lan
guage, characterization, style and
history, for him the story is most
important. In the question-and
answer session following his read
ing, he refused to answer ques

tions about events in the book. "It
is cruel to give the story away," he
said pointing out that the kick
about reading a book is that the
reader doesn't know what is going
to happen next.
In the interview, Seth said that
while at Stanford he was inspired
by Timothy Steele — a former
Stanford professor who is now at
UCLA — to concentrate on his
poetry. At his reading, Seth read a
few poems from"The Color
Wheel," Steele's new book.
Seth started writing as a mat
ter of convenience. He said he
wrote an account of his trip to
China and Tibet for his friends
because he was tired of answering
their questions over and over
again.
His parents thought that it
would make an interesting story
and asked him to write to publish
ers. Since Seth didn't know any
thing about publishing, his father
suggested that he visit the British
Council Library at New Delhi and
copy addresses of publishers from
the books there.
Seth wrote to several publish
ers about his idea and many
replied saying that "it was a very
interesting story but they were

not interested." A few of their
responses were encouraging, how
ever, and so he completed the
book on his travels.
That first effort took Seth
down the road that has led him to
"The Suitable Boy," which took
him eight years to write. Seth said
that he was immensely relieved
with its popularity because this
means that he can pay off his
debts and continue writing. Its
success has given him — and
more importantly, his parents —
confidence in his writing, he said.
"They were saying 'Oh, you've
got a degree in economics from
Stanford and another one from
Oxford and you're sitting and
writing this long unsaleable book
— what will our neighbors say?' "
he said.
"The Suitable Boy" has been
translated into 14 languages, and
a television series of the book is in
the works.
And if the inspiration to do
academic writing strikes him,
Seth said he may even return to
his dissertation. After six success
ful books ranging in variety from
poetry to travelogues, however,
his return to academic writing
may be postponed indefinitely.
