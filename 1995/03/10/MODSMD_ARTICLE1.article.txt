## Stanford Law School improves to second place, Business falls in U.S. News and World Report 
### Martin L. Yeung Contributing writer 
While Stanford's position in next Mon
day's annual U.S. News and World Report
graduate school rankings is different from
last year, officials at both the University and
the magazine admit that these changes may
have little to do with the school's quality.
Depending on the point of view, the rank
ings can either be a boost or a drag on Stan
ford's academic reputation and public percep
tion.
For example, Stanford's Graduate School
of Business fell from its top-ranked position in
1994 to third this year, with MIT and the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania taking the first and
second spots respectively.

Conversely, Stanford Law School's rank
ing improved this year, tying Ivy League rival
Harvard for second-place honors.
Most of the ranking changes for this year
are due more to changes in methodology and
how U.S. News weights categories than to ac
tual differences in academic programs and
faculty.
A 1 Sanoff, managing editor of "America's
Best Graduate Schools" for the magazine,
said changes reflected in the rankings vary be
cause of different criteria used to evaluate the
various schools.
For example, SanofT said the business
school rankings were due mostly to replacing
CEO polls with recruiter polls in the survey.
"Stanford was number two
among CEOs in 1994, but only
number seven among recruiters,"
SanofT said. "Since that segment
makes up 20 percent of the total
score, you're going to get a shift."
But while changes in how U.S.
News conducted and scored its sur
vey negatively affected the Busi
ness School's ranking, survey mod
ifications benefited the Law
School.
"We gave more weight to aca
demic reputation rather than repu
tation among judges and lawyers
this year," said Robert Morse,
director of data analysis for U.S.
News.
"We placed greater emphasis on
how many graduates were
employed six months after gradua
tion as opposed to the median
incomes of graduates employed six
months after graduation," he
added.

Director of MBA Admissions
Marie Mookini said that while U.S.
News rankings offered "a quick
and useful snapshot" of a business
school, applicants would be ill
advised to base their decisions sole
ly on the basis of the rankings.
"I'd be disappointed with candi
dates who use the rankings to that
degree," said Mookini.
But Mookini said she was not
disappointed to hear that Stanford
has lost the No. 1 ranking that it
has held the past two years.
"It's still impressive, I mean if
you look at where we are in relation
to MIT, who was second last year,
and Wharton, who was fourth,
we're off by a mere fraction of a
percentage point," she said.
Asked if the lower rank would
adversely affect applications,
Mookini said, "it may affect our
yield," but she did not foresee any
significant changes in the number
of applications for next year.
Dean of the Law School Paul
Brest said he was not surprised by
the Law School's rise.
"I never take these polls very

seriously," Brest said. "We've
always been among the top three
law schools in the nation.... Of
course, [rising] certainly is prefer
able to [falling in rank], but they're
so random and they change on a
yearly basis."
But Brest said he was not going
to discount the U.S. News poll com
pletely.
"When we are ranked first, then
I will believe that the rankings are
accurate," he said.
Unlike the Law School, the
changes in the scoring criteria
adversely affected the Medical
School.
Stanford, along with the Uni
versity of Washington, fell com
pletely off the U.S. News top 10 list
of research-oriented medical
schools, to 12th place.
Don Gibbons, the Medical Cen
ter's director of communications,
said that "it's a volatile survey"
and that Stanford's rank has "been
all over the place."
"I don't think that [U.S. News]
takes into account some of the
other factors. For example, our

medical students may take longer
to finish because they conduct
research projects during their time
here," said Gibbons.
The extra time medical students
take could drag down the four-year
graduation rate, he said.
Gibbons also cited the Medical
School's large applicant pool. "Last
year, we received 7,600 applica
tions for 86 spots." he said.
However, Elliott Wolfe, associ
ate dean of student affairs at the
Medical School, said that he does
"take this news seriously."
"We plan to bring the issue up at
the meeting of the senior deans of
the medical school [today]," he
said.
Overall, Stanford did well in
many categories. Among the grad
uate departments taking home
either first-place or second-place
honors were economics, history,
and political science.
The Graduate School of Educa
tion was ranked second overall,
and the School of Engineering fell
from its second-place ranking last
year to fourth place.
