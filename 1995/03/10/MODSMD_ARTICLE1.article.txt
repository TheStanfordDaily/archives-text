## Stanford Law School improves to second place, Business falls in U.S. News and World Report 
### Martin L. Yeung Contributing writer 
While Stanford's position in next Mon
day's annual U.S. News and World Report
graduate school rankings is different from
last year, officials at both the University and
the magazine admit that these changes may
have little to do with the school's quality.
Depending on the point of view, the rank
ings can either be a boost or a drag on Stan
ford's academic reputation and public percep
tion.
For example, Stanford's Graduate School
of Business fell from its top-ranked position in
1994 to third this year, with MIT and the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania taking the first and
second spots respectively.

Conversely, Stanford Law School's rank
ing improved this year, tying Ivy League rival
Harvard for second-place honors.
Most of the ranking changes for this year
are due more to changes in methodology and
how U.S. News weights categories than to ac
tual differences in academic programs and
faculty.
A 1 Sanoff, managing editor of "America's
Best Graduate Schools" for the magazine,
said changes reflected in the rankings vary be
cause of different criteria used to evaluate the
various schools.
For example, SanofT said the business
school rankings were due mostly to replacing
CEO polls with recruiter polls in the survey.
