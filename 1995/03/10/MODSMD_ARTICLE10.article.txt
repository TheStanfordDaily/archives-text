# Former KGB agent speaks to grads, staff

### Marie Rosencrantz 
Stanislav Levchenko, a former high-ranking
KGB officer, offered a fascinating insight yes
terday into the reality of espionage during the
peak of the Cold War.
Invited by the Slavic Languages and Litera
tures Department to speak at the first table-talk
event in a planned semi-weekly series,
Levchenko asked the participants to debate a
question which has become crucial for the
future of U.S. intelligence operations in the
post-Cold War era; "Should the U.S. spy against
Russia?"
Stating that he "had to do many of the things
we see spies doing in the movies," the former
KGB agent opened his presentation by describ

ing himself as a "victim of the Cold War."
The KGB called Levchenko to be an intelli
gence officer and to conduct covert action in
Japan under journalistic cover in the early
1970s while he was a post-graduate student in
Japanese literature and history at the Universi
ty of Moscow.
In Japan, Levchenko penetrated the
Japanese Socialist Party and the Japanese
media by recruiting politicians and journalists
to work for the KGB until he defected to the
West in 1979.
According to Levchenko, Moscow exercised
almost complete control over the Japanese
Socialist Party during this period.
Stating that "many people cost less than we
think" Levchenko described how Moscow man

aged to recruit politicians from many of the
main factions of the Japanese political parties
and from all but one of the most influential
Japanese newspapers.
In contrast to the KGB — which primarily
focused on political and military intelligence
operations — Russian intelligence currently
attempts to obtain information about new U.S.
technology in order to avoid expensive patent
laws, according to Levchenko.
High-tech Russian intelligence operations
may appear less threatening to U.S. national
security interests than political espionage.
However, Levchenko pointed to the
unstable political situation in Russia and in
many other former Soviet
republics to support his claim
that it is vital for the United
States to continue to closely
watch the situation in the former
Soviet Union.
Stating that "there is no ques
tion about whether Russia will be

a superpower again," Levchenko
noted that the present situation
— where the United States and
Russia are "neither friends nor
foes" — is unprecedented in histo
ry, and that the future is current
ly more unpredictable than it ever
was during the Cold War period.
Levchenko's presentation was
well-received among his audience
of about 25 — mostly graduate
students and faculty from the
Slavic Department.

Serafima Redivilova, a Russian
Language lecturer in the Slavic
Department and the main orga
nizer of the table-talk club, was
very pleased with the event.
"The idea is to form cultural
awareness and sensitivity in stu
dents," she said, explaining that
the main purposes of the table
talk club are to add a cultural
component to language education
and to stimulate interest among
students about Slavic languages.

The Slavic Department plans
to invite speakers and organize
meetings every second Thursday
during spring quarter.
Current plans for table-talk
topics include discussions about
arranged marriages between
American men and Russian
women through American dating
services, adoption of Russian chil
dren by American families and
how it feels to be a Russian in the
United States.
