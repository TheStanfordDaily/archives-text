Jordan's back?
CHICAGO (AP) - Michael
Jordan, estranged from the
sport he adopted, is returning to
the game he once ruled, a source
told The Associated Press last
night.
"He's done with baseball,"
said the source, speaking on the
condition he not be identified.
"He's going to play basketball."
Jordan practiced again with
the Chicago Bulls on Thursday,
the third straight day he
appeared at team headquarters,
and will shortly trade in his base
ball spikes for a new pair of Air
Jordans.
"It won't be tonight, tomor
row or the next day,"the source
said. "But it will be 500n.... He's
going to take a couple of weeks to
tune up."
Jordan retired suddenly about
a month before the 1993-94 sea
son. Though he has stayed in
shape playing baseball, he "wants
to make sure he's near the top of
his game," the source said.

"There are still a few pieces to
fall into place," the source said
"He won't rush back to
improve the (team's) playoff posi
tion. It doesn't matter to him as
much whether they play the No.
1 or 2 seed as whether he's in real
good shape."
ESPN also reported last night
that Jordan is returning. The
cable network, citing a "reliable"
but unidentified source, said he
will come back, but not for a cou
ple of weeks. ESPN said Jordan is
intent on being in good shape and
wants to discuss the future of the
Bulls with team management.
Earlier yesterday, Bulls coach
Phil Jackson talked about the
prospect of Jordan's return.
"We just have to hang tight
here and wait to see what goes
on," Jackson said. "He and I
spoke about this possibility hap
pening last September and Octo
ber. It's a reality ... but it's still
not a reality. So we're not pinning
any hopes and we're not trying to
throw up a balloon or a kite that's
not ready to fly."
