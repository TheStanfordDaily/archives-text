# Republicans announce tax-cut plan

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - House
Republicans presented their long
promised tax cut for families, busi
nesses and investors yesterday,
triggering Democratic accusations
that the GOP was once again
favoring the rich over the poor.
Portraying the measure as a
boon to ordinary Americans,
House Ways and Means Commit
tee Chairman Bill Archer, R-
Texas, unveiled the package in a
speech to the conservative Family
Research Council.
"For families and for working
Americans, we will bring a new
day of hope and opportunity,"
Archer said.
Despite the pep-rally atmo
sphere, the bill's introduction
ignites what is likely to be one of
Congress' fiercest, least pre

dictable battles this year. The
political difficulties will be enor
mous as lawmakers simultaneous
ly try to slash taxes and erase the
mammoth budget deficit.
The measure's will cost $189
billion over five years, with a 10-
year cost likely to balloon to about
$700 billion.
Democrats accused the GOP of
crafting tax cuts that would bene
fit wealthy families while pursuing
reductions in school lunches, heat
ing assistance and other programs
that help the poor.
"The president rejects the idea
of targeting the most vulnerable in
our society — our children, needy
families, the homeless — in order
to pay for these tax cuts, especially
for tax cuts that are benefiting the
wealthiest," said White House

Chief of Staff Leon Panetta.
With some noteworthy excep
tions, the measure delivers most of
the tax reductions the GOP
pledged in its "Contract With
America" during last autumn's
election campaign. Its cornerstone
is a $500 per child tax credit for
families earning $200,000 annual
ly or less. It also would reduce the
capital gains tax rate for compa
nies and individuals, establish new
individual retirement accounts
and reduce levies paid by many
companies.
Majority Republicans seem cer
tain to push the measure through
the Ways and Means panel next
week, and the full House soon
afterward. But beyond that, its
future is murky.
Not only does a possible veto

fight loom with President Clinton,
but the legislation's fate in the
Senate is shaky because many
Republicans there prefer chopping
away at the federal deficit to trim
ming taxes. Balancing the budget
would take more than $1 trillion in
spending slashes over the next
seven years, a sum budget-cutters
have never before approached.
"I put a lot higher priority on
deficit reduction than I do on tax
cuts," said Senate Finance Com
mittee Chairman Bob Packwood,
R-Ore.
House Republicans have vowed
to pay for the tax measure by
revamping welfare, continuing
some restrictions on Medicare and
cutting other programs. But they
have not specified where most of
the savings would come from.
