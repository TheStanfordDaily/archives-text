# Clinton invites Adams for historic visit

WASHINGTON (AP) — Coaxing peace in
Northern Ireland, President Clinton sharply
eased travel restrictions on Irish nationalist
Gerry Adams and invited him to the White
House for a St. Patrick's Day reception.
Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, a legal politi
cal party allied with the outlawed Irish
Republican Army, also will be welcomed on
Capitol Hill, where House Speaker Newt
Gingrich originally had planned to shun him.
Clinton personally intervened on Adams'
behalf in return for Sinn Fein's commitment
to make the disposal of IRA weapons a sub
ject of talks with Britain, White House offi
cials said Thursday.
"It's a step forward on a process that we
believe needs to be nurtured and deepened,"

presidential spokesman Mike McCurry said.
As a reward, Clinton personally approved
a three-month travel visa for Adams and
agreed to let him raise funds in the United
States, dropping a prior ban.
As a condition, Sinn Fein promised that
money raised by Adams would be used only
for peaceful political purposes, not to buy
weapons, McCurry said.
The administration said Clinton's ges
tures were intended to encourage a peace
process that has been gradually unfolding.
Since last September, the IRA has observed
a cease-fire in their campaign of bombings
and assassinations aimed at ending British
rule in Northern Ireland. Protestant gun
men declared their own cease-fire in mid-

October.
Adams' meeting with Clinton is symboli
cally important, the first ever between an
American president and an IRA-associated
figure.
The British government reacted coolly to
Clinton's decision. A spokesman noted that
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick May
hew this week "reminded Americans that
the IRA still has its weapons, is still recruit
ing and training, and still engaged in brutal
punishment beatings."
As a result of Clinton's move, Gingrich
backed off an earlier pledge to bar Adams
from the St. Patrick's Day luncheon on Capi
tol Hill, planned for Thursday. Clinton also
will be there.
