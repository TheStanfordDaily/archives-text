# Moratorium implemented on government regulations

WASHINGTON (AP) - Republicans
pushed a sweeping moratorium on feder
al regulations through a Senate commit
tee yesterday, resisting arguments that
public health and safety would be jeopar
dized.
The legislation, approved on a party
line 6-5 vote by the Governmental Affairs
Committee, would put on hold until the
end of the year more than 900 regula
tions now in the pipeline, including many
that already have been issued.
The measure, similar to a freeze
already approved by the House, would be
retroactive to last Nov. 9. It now goes to
the Senate floor.
Republicans argued that voters gave
Congress a mandate in the Nov. 8 elec
tion — when the GOP took control of
both the Senate and House for the first
time in 40 years — to slow the stream of
rules and regulations from Washington.
The freeze is intended as a stopgap
measure until Congress enacts regulato
ry reforms, said Sen. William Roth, R-
Del., the committee chairman.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said regu
latory overkill is "destroying the Ameri
can family . . . and the American
dream. . . . The mandate was that they
[the voters] want these regulations
stopped."
Democrats agreed regulatory reforms
are needed, but maintained the legisla

tion was going too far because it would
cover virtually every agency action with
an economic impact of $100 million or
more.
While there are exemptions for rules
dealing with imminent threats to health
and safety, law enforcement, taxes and
military matters, the Democrats main
tained the exceptions are so narrow that
hundreds of health and safety regulations
would be bottled up.
"The bureaucracy is out of control.
We've got rules and regulations coming
down like a sledgehammer," agreed Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga. "But we're responding
in kind. We're legislating with a sledge
hammer. .. . There are just different peo
ple getting hit."
Republicans, who hold an 8-6 majority
in the committee, staved off attempt after
attempt by Democrats to narrow the
moratorium.
The panel, however, came to the res
cue of duck hunters, agreeing to exempt
any regulations involving hunting, fish
ing or camping. There was concern next
fall's duck-hunting season would have to
be canceled.
The committee also approved exemp
tions for pending regulations involving
commercial fishing, commuter airline
safety, protection from lead paint, rail
road crossing signs and medical benefits
for Gulf War veterans.
