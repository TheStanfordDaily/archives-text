Government regulation
of the Internet has very
Orwellian implications

BIG BROTHER wants to read
your e-mail. A bill recently
introduced in both houses of
Congress — the misleadingly
named "Communications Decency
Act of 1995" — would allow the
government and service providers
to censor all forms of electronic
communication on the Internet,
from public postings to your pri
vate mail.
Introduced in the Senate by Jim
Exon of Nebraska and in the
House of Representatives by Tim
Johnson of South Dakota, the bill
is intended to prevent obscenity
and harassment on the Internet.
In the words of Sen. Exon, "I want
to keep the information superhigh
way from resembling a red light
district."
The bill should get the backing
of groups and individuals who sup
port censorship of "indecent" com
munication more than the First
Amendment, as well as from people
who are generally fearful of the
Internet.
The implications of the legisla
tion, however, are much broader
than simply banning obscenity; its
inherent dangers far outweigh its
benefits.
At risk is nothing less than the
individual's right to privacy and
free speech on what is quickly
becoming a potent political force —
the Internet. In short, the bill
would send us well on our way to
an world even more Orwellian than
the one we live in.
"Free speech is just as impor
tant on the Net as it is in the halls
of Congress or on a soap box in
White Plaza," said Prof. Carey
Heckman, co-director of the Stan
ford Law and Technology Center.
He added that the Communica
tions Decency Act is "clearly a
poorly conceived proposal."
Carey is probably right; aside

from the bill's abuse of civil liber
ties, it could, as many fear, also
hold service providers — including
universities like Stanford — liable
for "inappropriate communica
tion," which would effectively force
most of them to either shut down
or greatly restrict usage.
Much of the Internet communi
ty is justifiably outraged by the bill
and is fighting hard to prevent its
passage. An electronic petition has
been widely circulated which any
one opposed to this legislation
should sign as soon as possible.
To sign the petition, send an e
mail to 5314-petition@
netcom.com with the following
message: "SIGNED (your on-line
address) (your full name) (whether
you are a U.S. citizen)." A correctly
filled-out petition should look
something like this: "SIGNED
johndoe@leland.stanford.edu
John Doe YES."
Those who believe in the free
dom of speech and right to privacy
should also contact their senators
and representatives in Washington
and urge them to strongly oppose
this legislation. According to aides
in their respective offices, Califor
nia Sens. Dianne Feinstein and
Barbara Boxer and Rep. Anna
Eshoo have not yet decided their
stances on the proposed legislation.
People who wish to further
investigate the details of the bill
can do so on the World Wide Web at

or in the newsgroup
comp.org.eff.talk.
With President Clinton and Vice
President Gore pushing hard for
legislation requiring the adoption
of the Clipper Chip — which would
give the National Security Council
the ability to decode all encrypted
electronic messages — it is clear
that the government is trying to
stick its nose where it does not
belong.
Let us take action now to stop
this trend before it's too late; if we
don't, they might start sending the
Thought Police out for us.
And that would be double
plusungood.
