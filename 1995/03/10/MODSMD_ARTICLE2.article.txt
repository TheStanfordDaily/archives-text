# Weather results in problems
## Trees, cars damaged by rain, high winds 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
Students living on the upper
half of the Row awoke yesterday
night to the hum of emergency
lights, while others throughout
campus were surprised to fmd
their cars damaged by fallen tree
branches.
The high winds knocked out
electricity in the Lou Henry
Hoover House, sections of the fac
ulty ghetto and Row residences lo
cated east of Campus Drive on
Mayfield Avenue for most of the
day, said Kathleen Cruise, utilities
manager at the Facilities Office.
According to Cruise, the office
began to receive power outage re
ports as early as 7:30 a.m.
"We haven't lost any Universi
ty-generated power," said Cruise.
"Stanford power is on-line." Out-

After nearly 12 hours of continuous rain and high winds, students emerged yesterday morning to survey
the damage of the storm, which included several fallen trees.
ages have occurred in those areas
of campus serviced by PG&E, she
said.
However, Cruise added, Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
was not without power yesterday.
The Facilities Office supplied

Hoover House with a generator
for an event last night.
In addition to interfering with
power lines, the wind forced down
several oak and eucalyptus trees,
spreading debris and causing
minor damage to vehicles across
campus.
"It reminded me of the damage
you see after a hurricane," said
Academic Grounds Supervisor
Larry Atwater. "It has been many

years since we've had rain like
this."
Since the ground is so saturat
ed with water, Atwater said if the
winds and rains persist more
trees are sure to come down.
He added that many street
lamp domes were damaged
because of the high winds.
According to Stanford Police
Sgt. John McMullen, the winds
also damaged automobiles parked

on campus.
Eight cars suffered minor to
severe damage from the storm,
including one parked near Lagu
nita Court which sustained seri
ous roof damage after a heavy
branch fell on top of it, McMullen
said.
On another side of campus, a
eucalyptus limb smashed through
the rear windshield of a car
parked outside of the French

House. The other cars sustained
only minor damages.
"Eucalyptus trees don't hold
up under wind conditions,"
McMullen said. He suggested that
students should avoid parking
underneath these trees when
storms are forecast.
While the winds caused
widespread damage, rainwater
did not provoke flooding — a
problem which plagued the cam

pus earlier in the season.
According to both Atwater and
McMullen, Facilities staff was
able to get ahead of potential
drainage difficulties early by
anticipating typical problems and
making an effort to keep drains
clear from debris.
Rain and wind are supposed to
continue today, with the possibili
ty of thunderstorms. Storms will
taper off tonight and tomorrow.
