Racial epithets don't violate rights of 'weaker 9 students

FEW THINGS THIS month have dis
turbed me more than the cries of
students and administrators over
the demise of Stanford's speech code.
These people argue that the speech code
protected the "rights of students to pur
sue and education in an atmosphere free
of harassment." However, no such rights
exist.
A right, in the true sense of the word,
is something that can be enjoyed which
requires no effort on the part on anyone
else. Rights are concrete and objective, the
violation of which must involve some type
of force, coercion or fraud. It cannot sim
ply involve the subjective feeling of some
one that something has been taken away
from them.
For example, if it can be determined
that someone took five dollars from me,
then that person has violated my property
rights, for it can be objectively determined
that an object of some worth was taken
from me. But if someone hurls an epithet
at me about the color of my skin — and
this has happened to me at least three
times in my life and once on this veiy

campus — I cannot in any honest manner
say that something has been taken from
me. If I take offense, that is simply a sub
jective reaction on my part. Thus, the
enjoyment of a subjectively-determined
privilege should not trump others' right to
freely express themselves. If it did, this
would be the beginning of totalitarianism.
Another erroneous supposition behind
the speech code is that members of certain
groups are too weak to handle being
insulted and need special protection from
the University. In an April 4,1994 inter
view with the Stanford Review, Law
School Prof. Thomas Grey said that a
white person would be prosecuted under
the speech code for calling a black person
a "nigger," but a black person would not
be prosecuted for calling a white person a
"honkey." According to Grey, white stu
dents can handle these kind of insults but
poor, weak, vulnerable and helpless black
students cannot.
Grey'B statements are patronizing and
even border on racist. When Frederick
Douglass was told that he must ride in the
Negro section of a train, he was naturally

upset at being confined and inconve
nienced. However, this did not "degrade"
him. Said the great abolitionist: "They
cannot degrade Frederick Douglass. The
soul that is within me no man can
degrade. I am not the one that is being
degraded on account of this treatment,
but those who are inflicting it upon me."
If being confined to the Negro section of a
train could not degrade Frederick Dou
glass, how much less can being called a
name degrade a student at Stanford Uni
versity?
Before it is said that the attempt to
remove the speech code is an attempt by
the campus right to "legitimize" hate
speech, let me inform you that former
Daily columnists Kwame Anku and N'Gai
Croal — not exactly fans of Ronald Rea
gan — came out against the speech code.
Anku called the code a band-aid solution,
and Croal likened the code to a teacher
washing a little child's mouth with soap
for saying bad words. Wrote Anku in an
April 1,1993 column: "I don't know about
you, but I would much rather hear some
one come out and say, 'Well, I don't think

Ivy League schools should lower their
standards for niggers' than have them
believe in this statement but instead say,
'Well, I'm not sure quotas helping
African-Americans are constitutional.' "
Wrote Croal in an April 26,1994 column:
"I thought we had outgrown that — you
know, 'sticks and stones' and all that — to
the point where we were intelligent
enough to fight bad words with other
words. But Mr. Stanford didn't seem to
think we were smart enough to do that, so
back to the sandbox we went."
Next Tuesday, I will be introducing an
ASSU Senate resolution requesting that
the administration not restrict free speech
in the future. Please call your senators
and encourage them to support my resolu
tion. Students and administrators cannot
imbue the virtue of love and civility into
bigots by subjecting them to force and
coercion. True virtue comes through gen
uine changes within the hearts and minds
of people.
