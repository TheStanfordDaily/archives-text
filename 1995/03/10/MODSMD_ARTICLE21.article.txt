# Uncivil and immature students act foolishly during Sunday Flicks
## 
### 
For the first time in my approximate
ly four and a half years at Stanford, I
ventured into Memorial Auditorium last
weekend to watch "Quiz Show" at Sun
day Flicks. It was quite an experience
.. . something which most probably will
keep me away from Flicks for the rest of
my stay at Stanford. I am beginning to
understand why I don't get involved in

most campus activities.
The fact that the movie started half
an hour later than the scheduled 10 p.m.
was the least of the problems. The excel
lent movie was overshadowed by poor
student behavior. I was initially puzzled
by the large number of people marching
into the auditorium holding stacks of
flyers and newspapers to their chests.
For approximately 45 minutes until the
movie started, people were throwing air
planes and crumpled paper with the
intensity and energy that one would
hope is spent on learning. Now I know
what happens to all the Stanford
Reviews no one picks up. Perhaps, there
should be signs saying "Your mom

doesn't work here."
If the paper throwing and trashing
the auditorium weren't enough, halfway
through the movie a couple of guys ran
back and forth stark naked on the stage.
(I suppose it helps to sit all the way in
the back.) For the life of me, I can't fig
ure out what cheap thrill one gets out of
such exhibitionism.
I am not quite sure what to make of
the whole incident. Should I ignore the
students' behavior as mere abnormali
ties in the "diversified" student body?
Or is it something juveniles naturally
and hopefully will outgrow? Should I be
concerned that these practices are preva
lent here and at other universities, and

that some day these students will be
malting; policies for the nation? Or is this
whole incident a reinforcement of what I
have come to believe over the last sever
al years — first, that education is no
substitute for character, and second,
that a university degree, particularly
from elite schools, is nothing more than
a sanction for perversity?
Whatever the case may be, it is quite
disturbing that these children, obviously
lacking in civility, have, for example, the
right to vote. Perhaps, it is no surprise
that the Stanford student body votes
overwhelmingly Democratic.
