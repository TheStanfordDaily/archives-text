## How much is free speech ? 
### 
THE FIRST AMENDMENT is a
sham. We talk about our right to
free speech, but we have no more
than a right to cheap speech. An
exchange of ideas remains only an
admirable aspiration.
There is a common misconception
that the First Amendment prohibits
censorship. The literal language and its
accepted interpretations, unfortunate
ly, limit control by the government and
nothing more. That is a significant lim
itation on the limit. A religious institu
tion, a university, an employer, an edi
tor — there are many potential censors
whose approval can be crucial.
In the modern state, it is difficult to
distinguish between denying funding to
someone and actively discriminating
against them. A grant may be taken
away from an artist in favor of another
artist who is less controversial, a deci
sion which may effectively end the work
that is deemed offensive.
The owner of the traditional printing
press has liberties constrained by the
marketplace. What is said must sell
well.
Broadcasting is a regulated realm. It
is illegal to send radio signals or run a
television station without licenses and
permits. A private or pirate broadcast
ing operation is subject to prosecution.
The First Amendment offers no protec
tion.
Higher technologies present a new

frontier of regulation. Cable television,
cellular phones and the Internet are all
under controls that could not be
imposed on the paper and ink form. The
problems of access and equality have
always existed, but have become more
apparent with the new media. It is
doubtful that the information super
highway will leave room for public
transportation.
Whether conservative or liberal, the
businesses and their agents who own
and operate printing presses, radio
transmitters and television stations,
choose and exclude individuals and
groups for an allotment of time with the
public. In presenting diverse viewpoints,
there seems to be a rule that only one
member of a minority can speak. Creat
ing a stereotype, that individual comes
to represent the entire group.
The symbolism of free speech fails to
address more serious problems of com
munication. Self-censorship ruins aca
demic and artistic works. Everything
must be major and final and unique.
There is no room for minor works, mis
takes or developing dialogues.
The domain of intellectual property
encroaches on the expanse of the First
Amendment. On top of the accepted
ideas that we inherit are the propri
etary ideas that we cannot use without
paying a fee. The copyright, the patent
and the risk of plagiarism prevent us
from following architect Mies van der

Rohe's dictum "I would rather be right
than original."
The straw man of political correct
ness stands amidst this stunted crop of
ideas. If anything, political correctness
has had a centrifugal effect. People are
pushed to the extremes so that it is
acceptable to be black or white, with no
grays or colors left between. In the pro
cess of name-calling, progressives have
skewered themselves again: left attack
ing liberal, liberal set against moderate.
As for conservatives, the more reac
tionary they are, the less risk they face.
Abused in the name of free speech,
the cry of "political correctness" shows
the emptiness of our public discourse.
In response to any charge of wrongdo
ing, even the valid claim can be deflect
ed: "You're being P.C. It was a private
conversation. I didn't know anybody
was listening, I didn't mean what I said,
I didn't intend to offend people. And
anyway, I have my right to free speech."
Nothing is left. We are facile and
glib, ironic and strategic. We have lost
sincerity, meaning, understanding — if
ever we had them within our grasp.

The First Amendment reads in relevant
part, "Congress shall make no law
abridging the freedom of speech, or of
the press."
