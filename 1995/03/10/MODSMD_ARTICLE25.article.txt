Stanford 81
Washington St. 47

Many of the wins this season
for the Stanford women's basket
ball team came about through
team efforts on defense and
offense. Last night's game was no
exception.
The fifth-ranked Cardinal (25-
2 overall, 16-1 in the Pacific 10
Conference) outplayed Washing
ton State (15-11, 8-9 in the Pac
-10) to leave Pullman with the 81-
47 victory. The outcome was
never in doubt after Stanford
dominated the Cougars during a
10-minute stretch during the first
half.
"We were not able to keep our
selves close," Washington State
coach Harold Rhodes said.
The lead ballooned to 22 at one
point in the first half. The Cardi
nal held Washington State to only
35 percent shooting and limited
the Cougars to 20 attempts from
the floor. By contrast, the Cardi
nal attempted 37 and made 16 of
its tries to lead 35-19 at halftime.
Stanford put the game away
for good after the intermission,
when the Cardinal went on a 12-0
run early in the second half.
Turnovers and a lack of rebound
ing doomed the Cougars as time
and time again Stanford grabbed
offensive rebounds and had sec

ond chances at missed shots.
"Against a great team like that,
you can't have those kinds of mis
takes," Rhodes said.
The disparity inside was evi
dent as the Cardinal snared 54
boards, 24 on the offensive end.
Every single Stanford player
grabbed a rebound. Washington
State only managed to tally 32

rebounds of its own.
Turnovers also haunted the
Cougars. Junior Jenni Ruff and
senior guard Susie Jarosch, the
main ball handlers for WSU after
Julie Wight went down with a
sprained ankle, combined for 13
turnovers and the team finished
