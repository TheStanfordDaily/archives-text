Stanford 81
Washington St. 47

Many of the wins this season
for the Stanford women's basket
ball team came about through
team efforts on defense and
offense. Last night's game was no
exception.
The fifth-ranked Cardinal (25-
2 overall, 16-1 in the Pacific 10
Conference) outplayed Washing
ton State (15-11, 8-9 in the Pac
-10) to leave Pullman with the 81-
47 victory. The outcome was
never in doubt after Stanford
dominated the Cougars during a
10-minute stretch during the first
half.
"We were not able to keep our
selves close," Washington State
coach Harold Rhodes said.
The lead ballooned to 22 at one
point in the first half. The Cardi
nal held Washington State to only
35 percent shooting and limited
the Cougars to 20 attempts from
the floor. By contrast, the Cardi
nal attempted 37 and made 16 of
its tries to lead 35-19 at halftime.
Stanford put the game away
for good after the intermission,
when the Cardinal went on a 12-0
run early in the second half.
Turnovers and a lack of rebound
ing doomed the Cougars as time
and time again Stanford grabbed
offensive rebounds and had sec

ond chances at missed shots.
"Against a great team like that,
you can't have those kinds of mis
takes," Rhodes said.
The disparity inside was evi
dent as the Cardinal snared 54
boards, 24 on the offensive end.
Every single Stanford player
grabbed a rebound. Washington
State only managed to tally 32

rebounds of its own.
Turnovers also haunted the
Cougars. Junior Jenni Ruff and
senior guard Susie Jarosch, the
main ball handlers for WSU after
Julie Wight went down with a
sprained ankle, combined for 13
turnovers and the team finished

the game with 21.
Offensively for Stanford, sopho
more swingman Kate Starbird led
the team with 16 points on 7-of-10
shooting. Senior guard Kate Paye
was the only other Cardinal to score
in double digits. She racked up 11
points and also assisted on five
other Stanford baskets. Both Paye
and Starbird made two shots from
behind the three-point arc.
"I thought we got some good
three-point shooting from Kate
Paye and Kate Starbird," Cardinal
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "They
were doubling and tripling inside
and tried to really double our posts.
While the defensive sets that
WSU used kept Kaplan from reach
ing her season average, the depth
and balance of the team over
whelmed the Cougars. Every time
WSU keyed on Cardinal post play
ers, Stanford dumped the ball out
side for open threes. The Cardinal
hit six of 14 attempts from long
range.
The only negative for the Cardi
nal was free-throw shooting. Stan

ford made only 50 percent of its
shots from the charity stripe, hit
ting on seven of its 14 attempts.
Washington State was led offen
sively by Ruff, who scored almost
half of her team's points. She made
8-of-10 attempts from the floor and
added five free throws for her 21
points. Senior Kireen Ellis con
tributed nine but was in foul trou
ble after picking up her fourth very
early in the second half. While
Jarosch scored seven points, she
made only 2-of-7 shots. The Cardi
nal defense kept the Cougars from
ever getting started as WSU shot 37
percent for the game.
On Saturday, Stanford plays its
final regular season game in Seattle
with a showdown against the 14th
ranked Washington Huskies. The
Huskies are alone in second place in
the Pac-10 and are in position to
host an NCAA sub-regional.
"If you want to see some people
who are really crazy about basket
ball, then watch that game," Van-
Derveer said. "They'll paint their
faces and be really loud. They'll be
waiting to kick our butts."
Emotion will be high for this
game as Stanford must win in order
to be considered for a No. 1 seed in
the tournament.
