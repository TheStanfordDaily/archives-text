# Baseball team travels south for three against No. 7 USC
## Stanford pitching vs. Trojan offense in Los Angeles 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Strength against strength.
One of the top pitching staffs in the nation will
attempt to shut down one of the most powerful
offenses in college baseball when No. 14 Stanford
(12-10 overall, 3-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) travels to Los Angeles to take on
No. 7 USC (15-8, 2-1 in the Six-Pac) in a three-game
set at Dedeaux field over the weekend.
The Cardinal, which earned a pre-season No. 1
ranking on the strength of its pitching, will have to
cope with a Trojan squad that boasts seven players

batting over .300 and consistently rates among the
top teams in the nation in terms of power.
"They have one of the best lineups in the country
and they're probably one of the toughest teams we'll
face all year," junior relief pitcher Mike Robbins
said. "But our pitching staff is pretty talented and I
think we'll match up pretty well."
Junior left-hander Dan Reed (2-2) will take on the
unenviable task of being the first to face USC
tonight at 7 p.m. Coming off his best outing of the
year after throwing a complete game shutout at Cal
ifornia, Reed will face the Trojan's Brian Cooper,
who is 3-1 with a 2.67 earned run
average in 1995.
USC "is the team that we def
initely have to beat if we want to
win our conference," Reed said.
"They've got a great hitting team
and a real solid pitching staff.
This series is definitely going to
be tough."
On Saturday, Stanford sopho
more Jason Middlebrook (0-4)
will be looking to pick up his first
victory of the season against
Trojan Randy Flores (3-2). Sun
day's series finale will feature
Cardinal freshman Kyle Peter

son (3-1) against the Trojans'
Ben Tucker (2-0).
No matter who takes the
mound for the Cardinal this
weekend, Stanford is sure to
have its hands full with a USC
lineup loaded from top to bot
tom. It's difficult to find a weak
ness in an order that has pound
ed out 31 doubles, four triples
and 22 home runs in 22 games
played.
"USC has one of the best
offenses I've ever seen at this
level," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "If we hope to
repeat as conference champions
we're going to have to shut them
down."
The Trojans are led by one of
the best outfield trios in the

nation — Geoff Jenkins, Walter
Dawkins and Jacque Jones. All
three players have opened the
season at a phenomenal clip,
starting every game for USC this
season.
Jenkins carries a .387 average
with 21 RBIs and six home runs
into tonight's contest. Dawkins
and Jones don't trail far behind,
batting .345 and .341 respective
ly while combining for 35 RBIs.
And the strength of the Trojan
order doesn't stop there.
Shortstop Gabe Alvarez, a
pre-season All-American, has
opened the 1995 campaign in
impressive style, boasting a .333
average with three home runs
and 19 RBIs. USC has scored 57
more runs than its opponents
this season; if the Cardinal
hopes to capture the series, the
pitching staff must hold the
Trojans in check.
"They're definitely one of the
top teams in our conference,"
Robbins said. "But we have an
unbelievable amount of talent
and if we get going and start
putting some things together, we
could string up a bunch of wins."
So far this season, Stanford
has been unable to put any kind
of run together. After dropping
two games in a row to California
and Nevada, the Cardinal comes
into this early season match-up
needing to regain some momen
tum.
"We've been playing really
poorly and we want to break out
of that," Reed said. "The prob
lem is that we've been inconsis
tent and the Cal series really
sums up our year. The first game
we played great and hit the ball
all over the place and in the sec
ond game we couldn't do any
thing and lost."
Stanford and USC were rated
as the pre-season co-favorites in
the Six-Pac and this weekend's
series will give one team the
early edge. Baseball America
magazine ranked the rivalry
between the two schools as one
of the top five in the nation; the
Trojans and Cardinal split six
games in 1994.
Stanford will be featured on
television for the first time this
season on Sunday, with Prime
covering the game beginning at 1
p.m.
