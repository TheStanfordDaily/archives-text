# Baseball team travels south for three against No. 7 USC
## Stanford pitching vs. Trojan offense in Los Angeles 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Strength against strength.
One of the top pitching staffs in the nation will
attempt to shut down one of the most powerful
offenses in college baseball when No. 14 Stanford
(12-10 overall, 3-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) travels to Los Angeles to take on
No. 7 USC (15-8, 2-1 in the Six-Pac) in a three-game
set at Dedeaux field over the weekend.
The Cardinal, which earned a pre-season No. 1
ranking on the strength of its pitching, will have to
cope with a Trojan squad that boasts seven players

batting over .300 and consistently rates among the
top teams in the nation in terms of power.
"They have one of the best lineups in the country
and they're probably one of the toughest teams we'll
face all year," junior relief pitcher Mike Robbins
said. "But our pitching staff is pretty talented and I
think we'll match up pretty well."
Junior left-hander Dan Reed (2-2) will take on the
unenviable task of being the first to face USC
tonight at 7 p.m. Coming off his best outing of the
year after throwing a complete game shutout at Cal
ifornia, Reed will face the Trojan's Brian Cooper,
