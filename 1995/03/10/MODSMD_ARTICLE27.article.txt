# Hot stuff at Maples Pavilion
## Women gymnasts host Chili's Invite 
### Ben Hur Contributing writer 
Chili's couldn't ask for any
thing hotter.
The 17th-ranked Stanford
women's gymnastics team hosts
No. 18 Brigham Young Univer
sity, No. 15 Washington and
Illinois at Chili's "Red Hot"
Invitational today at Maples
Pavilion. The home finale fea
tures three teams that have
recently played musical chairs
in the rankings.
"These are the guys who are
going to be qualifying for
nationals," said Stanford head
coach Breck Greenwood. "If we

can separate ourselves from
them, it will look good for the
NCAAs."
Stanford has sizzled as of
late, compiling a 191.05 average
over the last five meets. Break
ing several school records along
the way, the team has set new
marks on the vault and beam;
freshman Keri Monahan also
earned the highest individual
vault score ever for a Stanford
woman gymnast.
The Cardinal will be looking
to avenge last week's four
tenths-of-a-point loss to BYU.
In that meet, the Cougars
recorded their highest team
score of the season against Stan
ford, with Nanette Walker lead
ing the way by winning the all
around.
However, Walker will have a
new competitor today as Mona
han returns to that event. She
leads the Cardinal on vault,
beam and all-around, and her
high score of 38.925 places her
ninth in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence.
Washington is also coming off
its top performance of the year,
scoring a 192.900 at last week's
Husky Classic. Jamie Stauffer
leads the team on the all-around
and vault events, while Stacy
Connolly has tallied the highest
scores on the uneven bars and
the balance beam.
Although Illinois visits the
Farm unranked, the squad's
high score of 192.550 signals
that it shouldn't be taken light
ly. Stacy Redmond heads the
Illini in the all-around, balance
beam and vault while Kari
Karubs and Nicole Ward lead
the team on bars and floor,
respectively.
"We're all geared up for this
meet," said sophomore Katie
Jennings. "We would like to do
well just to end the season on a
good note."
Seniors Meegan Lannin, Tina
Snowden and co-captains Jen 6
Elzie and Clancy are also hoping
to shine in their last outing at
home. Following the meet, the
team will honor each of them
with a senior blanket, a Cardi
nal tradition.
"They have been the team
leaders for the last three years,"
Greenwood said. "They've been
the guts of the team."
However, with the Pac-10
finals, regionals and NCAAs still
to come, the season is far from
over. The seniors realize they
must take care of business
before they reflect on their
Stanford careers.
"I'm just focused on right
now," Clancy said. "The most
important parts of the season
are still left for us. Nostalgia
comes when things are over."
