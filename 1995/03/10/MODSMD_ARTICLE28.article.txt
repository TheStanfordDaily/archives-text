# Cardinal men's team faces Fighting Illini
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
It's as if things were beginning
and ending in the same competi
tion. For the Stanford men's
gymnastics team, Saturday's dual
meet against No. 10 Illinois at
Burnham Pavilion marks both
the final regular season perfor
mance as well as what the squad
views as the start of the postsea
son.
"Now we're really starting to
get serious," said head coach

Sadao Hamada. "So far, we've
been giving the guys a chance to
perform without worrying about
scores and competitions."
With six weeks remaining
before the NCAA championships,
the Cardinal shifts its focus
towards posting more competitive
scores. Stanford's No. 9 ranking
is uncharacteristic of a team that
won the national title two years
ago and has perennially finished
near the top of the collegiate field.
