# Cardinal men's team faces Fighting Illini
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
It's as if things were beginning
and ending in the same competi
tion. For the Stanford men's
gymnastics team, Saturday's dual
meet against No. 10 Illinois at
Burnham Pavilion marks both
the final regular season perfor
mance as well as what the squad
views as the start of the postsea
son.
"Now we're really starting to
get serious," said head coach

Sadao Hamada. "So far, we've
been giving the guys a chance to
perform without worrying about
scores and competitions."
With six weeks remaining
before the NCAA championships,
the Cardinal shifts its focus
towards posting more competitive
scores. Stanford's No. 9 ranking
is uncharacteristic of a team that
won the national title two years
ago and has perennially finished
near the top of the collegiate field.
Going into the meet, the team
looks to improve drastically on its
season-high total of 227.5.
"We really could hit 230 plus if
we hit all our routines," Hamada
said. "We still have a problem with
misses though so it will be diffi
cult."
The Cardinal is coming iff a
weak meet against California two
weeks ago when the squad tallied
15 misses. While Stanford escaped
with a tie, the team's performance
clearly regressed after a strong
showing in Berkeley a week earlier.
"Nothing really went right in
our last meet," Hamada said. "We
really need to cut our misses down
to about six or seven for this week
end."
Individually, sophomore nation
al team member Jamie Ellis leads
the effort. Following two strong
performances, Ellis was named the
team's MVP for the week in what
is destined to become a team tradi
tion. Fellow national team mem
bers Josh Stein and Keith Wiley
will likely join Ellis in the all
around competition this weekend.
After months of honing difficult
routines, the gymnasts hope to be
ready to unleash their best perfor
mances.
"This is typically the time in the
season when records get broken,"
said graduate assistant J air Lynch.
"The guys are starting to get in the
right frame of mind to win a cham
pionship."
In addition to the normal cast of
competitors, the squad should
receive a boost from several Stan
ford gymnasts who are recently
coming off injuries. While senior
Jason Cohen is still sidelined by a
back injuiy, junior Oliver Demree
and senior Peter Hegi have both
recently returned to full strength.
Demree will likely compete in the
floor exercise, pommel horse and
high bar while Hegi will take on
the high bar and rings.
"This meet will be crucial to
determining the postseason line
up for us," Lynch said. "Peter and
Oliver can really show what kind of

contribution they can make."
With everything the Cardinal
has to focus on, it must not forget
about the Dlini, who find them
selves on the bubble for the NCAA
regionals and desperately need to
post an impressive score this week
end.
"We really only have this meet
and the Big Ten championships
left before regionals," said Yoshi
Hayasaki, the director of men's
and women's gymnastics at Illi
nois. "Injuries have hurt us lately
and we haven't performed as well
as we would like."
When healthy, the Illinois squad

poses a formidable threat, having
beaten national powers Michigan
and Ohio State in Ann Arbor,
Mich., two weeks ago. Since then,
the team has sustained three key
injuries and has watched its rank
ing tumble from No. 2 to No. 10.
Regardless of whether Stanford
wins or loses on Saturday however,
the larger focus of the team
remains on the road to the title.
"We need to be in March Mad
ness shape," Lynch said. "Our per
formance here is most important
because it will set the tone for our
performance in the rest of the sea
n
son.
