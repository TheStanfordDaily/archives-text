## Men make their case with important win

Desire. Heart. Winning. Those
have been the buzzwords associ
ated with the Stanford men's bas
ketball team for most of this sea
son when its been winning. But
with the squad having dropped
five of its last seven games,
including two in a row last week
end in Oregon, question marks
began springing up, and doubters
started popping out of the wood
work. Obviously, it was another
late-season collapse by a star
crossed Stanford team, right?
Wrong. With an NCAA tourna
ment berth on the line in last
night's contest against Washing
ton State, Stanford did go back to
the basics. But these basics had
nothing to do with tanking, losing
or just plain stinking. In the 79-
72 victory over the Cougars (15-
11 overall, 9-8 in the Pacific 10
Conference), Stanford (18-8, 9-8
in the Pac-10) proved that these
new basics are about intensity,
grit and gusto — a simple matter
of who wanted it more. Last
night, it was Stanford.
"Last year, [Washington State]
came out, and [Cougar] Tony
Harris played his heart out so
they could get to the tourna
ment," said Cardinal sophomore
point guard Brevin Knight, who
led his club with 17 points and six
assists. "[Head coach Mike Mont
gomery] told us to take what Har
ris did and apply that to us as a
team. We went out tonight and
just played hard. We got together,
and people went out and just put
their hearts on their floor."
With a crowd of 6,309 on hand
at Maples Pavilion, the road
weary Cardinal team was ready to
enjoy some good, old-fashioned

home cooking. The Stanford team
of old was easily spotted in the
first half, playing with the same
type of defensive fervor that
fueled the club's success earlier in
the year.
"I think that's more typical of
the kind of effort that we've had
most of the year from our basket
ball team.," Montgomery said.
"We reminded them of back in
December when we played good
basketball teams, and what we
were doing, how we were
approaching the game, and how
we were just really working on
defense. And I thought we did
that tonight."
Washington State entered the
contest as the nation's top team

in field-goal accuracy, having con
verted 51.9 percent of its shots.
Montgomery's squad, however,
held the Cougars to just 31 per
cent in the first half and 38.6 per
cent for the game.
"These past few practices,
coach has stressed defense,
defense, defense," said Knight.
"Tonight, we came out and played
defense really well."
While Stanford's defensive
play was running at full speed,
the Cardinal offense sputtered as
it has done in the last few games.
The team shot just 32.1 percent
from the floor and converted zero
of-5 from three-point range.

Junior guard Dion Cross focuses on Washington State's Shamon
Antrum during last night's victory over the Cougars.
The Cougars, capitalizing on
Stanford's wheezing offense,
seized a 19-13 lead, their largest,
with 9:38 left to play in the first
half.
However, Stanford, fueled by
its suffocating defense, bounced
back and went on a 17-4 run to
overtake to take the Cougars.
"The shots that wouldn't go in
summed up our Oregon trip,"
Knight said. "But we knew we had
to hang with it, and as long as we
were playing great defense — there
was stretch in the first half where
[Washington State] was just strug
gling to score because we were tak
ing charges and they were taking
bad shots— we were in the game.
Our shots would fall eventually."
With shots falling, the Cardinal
took a 32-27 lead at halftime and
never looked back.
That's not to say, however, that
the game was not close. Stanford
avoided near disaster in the second
half when Knight, after a hard col
lision with Washington State
guard Shamon Antrum, appeared
to twist his knee.
After limping to the bench for a
brief examination, Knight's injury
was deemed minimal, and the 5-10
guard returned to the game, where
he received a standing ovation.
The crowd would have more
opportunities later on to do some
more standing and clapping.
After Washington State crept to
within one when guard Donminic
Ellison drilled a three-pointer,
tightening the Cardinal lead to 41-
40, Knight slashed to the hoop for
a lay-up. The bucket sparked a 6-0
run capped by a thundering,
crowd-rousing dunk by Stanford
senior forward Andy Poppink.
The Cougars stayed in it, how
ever. Even after Stanford senior
swingman David Harbour drilled a
trey to give his club an eight-point
advantage, Washington State
closed to within four. With 21
offensive rebounds for the game,
there was no doubt the Cougars
were not going to die easily. But a
10-2 spurt by Stanford gave the
Cardinal an insurmountable 70-58
lead with just 2:14 left to play.
"It was a tremendously hard
fought game," Montgomery said.
"Both clubs really working to
make plays. Anytime we got in
trouble we just didn't let them
have a run, a stretch where they
hit three or four. We didn't have
very many ourselves, but slowly
but surely we maintained our lead
and extended it a little bit."
There was much rejoicing for
the apparently tournament-bound
Stanford team. The Cardinal

squad had displayed a sense of
want long absent in the previous
several games. Not only did the
defense dominate, but individual
players also exhibited outstanding
individual efforts.
Knight controlled the contest
from start to finish. Junior guard
Dion Cross, while scoring just nine
points, pleased Montgomery to no
end by putting the clamps on
Antrum, who devastated Stanford
earlier this year.
"I was really pleased with
Dion," Montgomery said. "He used
his head on the shots he took. I
thought he really stuck his nose in
defensively, and took the personal
challenge with Antrum."
Harbour jump-started the team
off the bench with 15 points, hit
ting 5-of-8 from the floor including
Stanford's lone three. Poppink,
after a miserable one point in the
first half, bounced back in a big
way to score 14 points with two
crowd-frenzyingjams.
"I played terribly in the first
half," Poppink said. "I knew it. In
the second half, we just told our
selves we had to do whatever it was
going to take to win the game, and
fortunately, we did it."
Center Tim Young dominated
the interior, racking up 15 points,
11 boards and two blocks.
"I think tonight in my mind it
was all about Tim Young," Cougar
head coach Kevin Eastman said.
"Tim Young established an inside
presence that really, really hurt
our team."
Last night, the Cardinal demon
strated the type of fire and desire
to gain an invitation to the land of
March Madness: The NCAA Way.
"The better team a) won the
game, b) deserved to win the game,
and c) deserves to go to the NCAA
tournament," Eastman said.
There's just one small detail,
and its name is Washington.
"We feel as if we need one more
win," Knight said. "We know we
have to win. We're not going out
saying that we're just going to
play. We're going out to win our
final game for out seniors. They've
done a lot for us, and we want to
take them out on a winning note."
The downtrodden Huskies (9-
17, 5-12 in the Pac-10) enter Sat
urday night's regular season-end
ing showdown in Maples Pavilion
having lost three in a row to Stan
ford, including a 65-51 decision
earlier this year. But don't tell
Montgomery that the Huskies are
a gimme.
"We absolutely cannot, cannot
take Washington for granted, and
act like they aren't good because
they are a good basketball team
that's playing very well late in the
year," Montgomery said. "We have
to come out with the same intensi
ty and the same kind of concentra

tion."
With Washington showing
some bite by defeating California

- '"win,* - vniinu . "|
74-73 in an overtime thriller last
night, the Cardinal can hardly
afford a letdown of any sort.

The crowd would have more
opportunities later on to do some
more standing and clapping.
After Washington State crept to
within one when guard Donminic
Ellison drilled a three-pointer,
tightening the Cardinal lead to 41-
40, Knight slashed to the hoop for
a lay-up. The bucket sparked a 6-0
run capped by a thundering,
crowd-rousing dunk by Stanford
senior forward Andy Poppink.
The Cougars stayed in it, how
ever. Even after Stanford senior
swingman David Harbour drilled a
trey to give his club an eight-point
advantage, Washington State
closed to within four. With 21
offensive rebounds for the game,
there was no doubt the Cougars
were not going to die easily. But a
10-2 spurt by Stanford gave the
Cardinal an insurmountable 70-58
lead with just 2:14 left to play.
"It was a tremendously hard
fought game," Montgomery said.
"Both clubs really working to
make plays. Anytime we got in
trouble we just didn't let them
have a run, a stretch where they
hit three or four. We didn't have
very many ourselves, but slowly
but surely we maintained our lead
and extended it a little bit."
There was much rejoicing for
the apparently tournament-bound
Stanford team. The Cardinal

squad had displayed a sense of
want long absent in the previous
several games. Not only did the
defense dominate, but individual
players also exhibited outstanding
individual efforts.
Knight controlled the contest
from start to finish. Junior guard
Dion Cross, while scoring just nine
points, pleased Montgomery to no
end by putting the clamps on
Antrum, who devastated Stanford
earlier this year.
"I was really pleased with
Dion," Montgomery said. "He used
his head on the shots he took. I
thought he really stuck his nose in
defensively, and took the personal
challenge with Antrum."
Harbour jump-started the team
off the bench with 15 points, hit
ting 5-of-8 from the floor including
Stanford's lone three. Poppink,
after a miserable one point in the
first half, bounced back in a big
way to score 14 points with two
crowd-frenzyingjams.
"I played terribly in the first
half," Poppink said. "I knew it. In
the second half, we just told our
selves we had to do whatever it was
going to take to win the game, and
fortunately, we did it."
Center Tim Young dominated
the interior, racking up 15 points,
11 boards and two blocks.
"I think tonight in my mind it
was all about Tim Young," Cougar
head coach Kevin Eastman said.
"Tim Young established an inside
presence that really, really hurt
our team."
Last night, the Cardinal demon
strated the type of fire and desire
to gain an invitation to the land of
March Madness: The NCAA Way.
"The better team a) won the
game, b) deserved to win the game,
and c) deserves to go to the NCAA
tournament," Eastman said.
There's just one small detail,
and its name is Washington.
"We feel as if we need one more
win," Knight said. "We know we
have to win. We're not going out
saying that we're just going to
play. We're going out to win our
final game for out seniors. They've
done a lot for us, and we want to
take them out on a winning note."
The downtrodden Huskies (9-

earlier this year. But don't tell
Montgomery that the Huskies are

"We absolutely cannot, cannot

act like they aren't good because
they are a good basketball team
that's playing very well late in the
year," Montgomery said. "We have

Washington,St. 72
Stanford 79

Desire. Heart. Winning. Those
have been the buzzwords associ
ated with the Stanford men's bas
ketball team for most of this sea
son when its been winning. But
with the squad having dropped
five of its last seven games,
including two in a row last week
end in Oregon, question marks
began springing up, and doubters
started popping out of the wood
work. Obviously, it was another
late-season collapse by a star
crossed Stanford team, right?
Wrong. With an NCAA tourna
ment berth on the line in last
night's contest against Washing
ton State, Stanford did go back to
the basics. But these basics had
nothing to do with tanking, losing
or just plain stinking. In the 79-
72 victory over the Cougars (15-
11 overall, 9-8 in the Pacific 10
Conference), Stanford (18-8, 9-8
in the Pac-10) proved that these
new basics are about intensity,
grit and gusto — a simple matter
of who wanted it more. Last
night, it was Stanford.
"Last year, [Washington State]
came out, and [Cougar] Tony
Harris played his heart out so
they could get to the tourna
ment," said Cardinal sophomore
point guard Brevin Knight, who
led his club with 17 points and six
assists. "[Head coach Mike Mont
gomery] told us to take what Har
ris did and apply that to us as a
team. We went out tonight and
just played hard. We got together,
and people went out and just put
their hearts on their floor."
With a crowd of 6,309 on hand
at Maples Pavilion, the road
weary Cardinal team was ready to
enjoy some good, old-fashioned

home cooking. The Stanford team
of old was easily spotted in the
first half, playing with the same
type of defensive fervor that
fueled the club's success earlier in
the year.
"I think that's more typical of
the kind of effort that we've had
most of the year from our basket
ball team.," Montgomery said.
"We reminded them of back in
December when we played good
basketball teams, and what we
were doing, how we were
approaching the game, and how
we were just really working on
defense. And I thought we did
that tonight."
Washington State entered the
contest as the nation's top team

in field-goal accuracy, having con
verted 51.9 percent of its shots.
Montgomery's squad, however,
held the Cougars to just 31 per
cent in the first half and 38.6 per
cent for the game.
"These past few practices,
coach has stressed defense,
defense, defense," said Knight.
"Tonight, we came out and played
defense really well."
While Stanford's defensive
play was running at full speed,
the Cardinal offense sputtered as
it has done in the last few games.
The team shot just 32.1 percent
from the floor and converted zero
of-5 from three-point range.

Junior guard Dion Cross focuses on Washington State's Shamon
Antrum during last night's victory over the Cougars.
The Cougars, capitalizing on
Stanford's wheezing offense,
seized a 19-13 lead, their largest,
with 9:38 left to play in the first
half.
However, Stanford, fueled by
its suffocating defense, bounced
back and went on a 17-4 run to
overtake to take the Cougars.
"The shots that wouldn't go in
summed up our Oregon trip,"
Knight said. "But we knew we had
to hang with it, and as long as we
were playing great defense — there
was stretch in the first half where
[Washington State] was just strug
gling to score because we were tak
ing charges and they were taking
bad shots— we were in the game.
Our shots would fall eventually."
With shots falling, the Cardinal
took a 32-27 lead at halftime and
never looked back.
That's not to say, however, that
the game was not close. Stanford
avoided near disaster in the second
half when Knight, after a hard col
lision with Washington State
guard Shamon Antrum, appeared
to twist his knee.
After limping to the bench for a
brief examination, Knight's injury
was deemed minimal, and the 5-10
guard returned to the game, where
he received a standing ovation.
The crowd would have more
opportunities later on to do some
more standing and clapping.
After Washington State crept to
within one when guard Donminic
