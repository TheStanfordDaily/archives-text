Desire. Heart. Winning. Those
have been the buzzwords associ
ated with the Stanford men's bas
ketball team for most of this sea
son when its been winning. But
with the squad having dropped
five of its last seven games,
including two in a row last week
end in Oregon, question marks
began springing up, and doubters
started popping out of the wood
work. Obviously, it was another
late-season collapse by a star
crossed Stanford team, right?
Wrong. With an NCAA tourna
ment berth on the line in last
night's contest against Washing
ton State, Stanford did go back to
the basics. But these basics had
nothing to do with tanking, losing
or just plain stinking. In the 79-
72 victory over the Cougars (15-
11 overall, 9-8 in the Pacific 10
Conference), Stanford (18-8, 9-8
in the Pac-10) proved that these
new basics are about intensity,
grit and gusto — a simple matter
of who wanted it more. Last
night, it was Stanford.
"Last year, [Washington State]
came out, and [Cougar] Tony
Harris played his heart out so
they could get to the tourna
ment," said Cardinal sophomore
point guard Brevin Knight, who
led his club with 17 points and six
assists. "[Head coach Mike Mont
gomery] told us to take what Har
ris did and apply that to us as a
team. We went out tonight and
just played hard. We got together,
and people went out and just put
their hearts on their floor."
With a crowd of 6,309 on hand
at Maples Pavilion, the road
weary Cardinal team was ready to
enjoy some good, old-fashioned

home cooking. The Stanford team
of old was easily spotted in the
first half, playing with the same
type of defensive fervor that
fueled the club's success earlier in
the year.
"I think that's more typical of
the kind of effort that we've had
most of the year from our basket
ball team.," Montgomery said.
"We reminded them of back in
December when we played good
basketball teams, and what we
were doing, how we were
approaching the game, and how
we were just really working on
defense. And I thought we did
that tonight."
Washington State entered the
contest as the nation's top team

in field-goal accuracy, having con
verted 51.9 percent of its shots.
Montgomery's squad, however,
held the Cougars to just 31 per
cent in the first half and 38.6 per
cent for the game.
"These past few practices,
coach has stressed defense,
defense, defense," said Knight.
"Tonight, we came out and played
defense really well."
While Stanford's defensive
play was running at full speed,
the Cardinal offense sputtered as
it has done in the last few games.
The team shot just 32.1 percent
from the floor and converted zero
of-5 from three-point range.
