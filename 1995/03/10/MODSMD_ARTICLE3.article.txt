### Jesse Oxfeld 
The University will allow the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity to keep its house and retain its status
as a University organization, said Delt president
Doug Abts.
The fraternity was informed earlier this week
of the decision in a letter from Dean of Students
Michael Jackson and Assoc. Director of Residen
tial Education Diana Conklin, according to Abts.
"We're happy that we're keeping our house
and University recognition," said Abts, a senior.
"Overall this is really a victory for us. A lot of
people doubted that we would keep our house."
In January, a committee was formed to re
view the Delts' status as a student organization.
Director of Student Activities Nanci Howe com

mented at the time that the main reason for the
formal review was "poor house management"
and damage to the residence, including a golf
cart being driven through a glass window.
"They had a hard time running their house
well and responsibly," Howe said.
Abts expressed satisfaction with the review
process. "They've been really excellent about
not keeping us in the dark," he said.
According to Abts, Jackson and Conklin's let
ter outlined ten requirements for the Delts to
fulfill. Abts called the requirements "simple
steps we need to take to clean up our act."
Under these regulations, the Delts will not be
allowed to throw any all-campus parties with al
cohol until the end of this school year, at the lat
est. "We're trying to have fun without things

getting out of control," said Abts.
The fraternity will be required to hold four
membership-education programs each year,
which all members must attend. To fulfill this
requirement, members of the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center put on a workshop
last month, and a career counseling session is
scheduled for next week, Abts said.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Heather Dunn said
she will run a membership-education program
on collective responsibility later this year.
According to Dunn, the University's policy on
collective responsibility says that "Greek organi
zations bear a certain level of responsibility for
the individual actions of their group members
when this behavior is part of a
group activity or represents chap
ter norms."
Abts said the fraternity is will
ing to cooperate with these efforts.
"We've got a new attitude here," he
said.

Dunn agreed. "I'm very opti
mistic that this group will be able
to turn things around and continue
to make positive contributions to
the campus community," she said.
Also included among the Uni
versity's requirements for the
Delts are stronger pledge-educa
tion programs, more active alumni
involvement and a revision of the
fraternity's in-house judicial
board.
