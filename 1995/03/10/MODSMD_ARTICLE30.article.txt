# Focused Cardinal rides intensity to victory

### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
When it came down to it, with the hopes of an
entire season resting on the outcome of one game,
Stanford shook off the combined weight of last
weekend's lifeless performances in Oregon and the
looming spectre of last season's end-of-the-year
collapse to scrape together a 79-72 win over Wash
ington State last night and a near-certain NCAA
tournament bid come Sunday afternoon.
Frustrated by a lack of energy during two losses
last weekend, head coach Mike Montgomery
looked for his Stanford team to get back the inten
sity and desire it showed at the beginning of this

year, when it racked up 11 straight wins. That's
exactly what he got.
Holding the top-shooting team in the Pacific 10
Conference to only 38,6 percent from the floor last
night, the Cardinal limited the Cougars to a vari
ety of dribble penetration shots and off-balance
putbacks. Although Washington State managed to
pound the boards for 21 offensive rebounds, Stan
ford never allowed the Cougars to put together a
run.
"Our goal was to get back that hunger defen
sively," Montgomery said. "If they can't score, they
can't beat us."
Along with superb team defense,
Stanford won battles in several key
matchups. Junior Darren Allaway
drew important charges on Cougar
big gun Mark Hendrickson and
held him to very few baskets from
an offensive set. Although Hen
drickson tallied 18 points on the
night, many came off of offensive
rebounds.
"Allaway really worked hard on
Hendrickson," Montgomery said.
"He played a lot of minutes [361 but
every time I looked out there I liked
what I saw. He didn't want to come
out."
The offensive struggle contin
ued for junior Dion Cross, but he
managed to put his shooting woes
out of his mind by playing hard
nosed defense on Shamon Antrum,
who sparked the Cougars in their
77-63 win over Stanford earlier
this year.
Forced back on its heels the first
ten minutes of the game, the Cardi
nal buckled down after Washington
State jumped out to a 19-13 lead
with nine minutes, 38 seconds
remaining. Over the next 7:09, the
Cougars scored only one point as
Stanford assumed the lead for good,
26-20.
"Tonight, we played defense,"
sophomore point guard Brevin
Knight said. "It's all about who

wants to win more. Whoever goes
out there and puts forth the best
effort is the team that is going to
come out on top."
In the second half, the Cardinal
came up with a similar defensive
stand to put the game away. Up 53-
49 with 10:09 to play, Stanford sti
fled the Cougars' shooters, limiting
them to nine points over an eight
minute span. In that same time, the
Cardinal stretched its lead to 12
with a key three-point shot by
David Harbour and a steal and
breakaway dunk by Andy Poppink.
After being called for a charge
early in the game, Poppink toned
down his intensity, only scoring one
point in the first half. Indicative of
Stanford's renewed energy after
the intermission, he scored 13
points on 5-for-8 shooting in the
second half.
"I played terribly in the first
half, and I knew it," Poppink said.
"In the second half, I just decided I
had to go after it one way or anoth
er. I was definitely thinking about
going to the rack the whole second
half."
Finding a much-needed boost of
energy late in the season, Stanford
looks ready to advance to the NCAA
tournament for the first time since
1992. Having seen a tournament
bid slip from its grasp last year with
back-to-back losses to the Washing
ton schools to end the regular sea
son, the Cardinal is now doing
eveiything it can to stay focused for
Washington Saturday night.
