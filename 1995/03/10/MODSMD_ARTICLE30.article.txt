# Focused Cardinal rides intensity to victory

### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
When it came down to it, with the hopes of an
entire season resting on the outcome of one game,
Stanford shook off the combined weight of last
weekend's lifeless performances in Oregon and the
looming spectre of last season's end-of-the-year
collapse to scrape together a 79-72 win over Wash
ington State last night and a near-certain NCAA
tournament bid come Sunday afternoon.
Frustrated by a lack of energy during two losses
last weekend, head coach Mike Montgomery
looked for his Stanford team to get back the inten
sity and desire it showed at the beginning of this

year, when it racked up 11 straight wins. That's
exactly what he got.
Holding the top-shooting team in the Pacific 10
Conference to only 38,6 percent from the floor last
night, the Cardinal limited the Cougars to a vari
ety of dribble penetration shots and off-balance
putbacks. Although Washington State managed to
pound the boards for 21 offensive rebounds, Stan
ford never allowed the Cougars to put together a
run.
"Our goal was to get back that hunger defen
sively," Montgomery said. "If they can't score, they
can't beat us."
