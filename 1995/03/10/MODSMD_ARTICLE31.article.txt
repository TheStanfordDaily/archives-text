# Volleyball faces nation's top team
## No. 1 UCLA's jump-serving ability poses powerful threat 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
One question which any men's
volleyball team with aspirations
for the NCAA championship
must answer is, "Can you beat
No. 1 UCLA?"
Stanford (10-3 overall, 7-2 in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration) will answer that ques
tion tomorrow night in Pauly
Pavilion. After that match, the
Cardinal will have to collect itself
and face 12th-ranked UC-Irvine
the very next night.
After losing to Cal State-
Northridge last weekend, Stan
ford lost the No. 1 position in the
Pacific Division and fell one place
— to third — in the national
rankings. The new No. 2, Hawaii,
met the Bruins Wednesday night,
losing in five games. This week
end therefore holds particular
importance for the Cardinal,
which is working hard to regain
the Pacific crown and to prove
itself a potential national champi
on. UCLA (13-1, 9-0 in the
MPSF) is the major obstacle.
"This is definitely a big
match," said freshman middle
blocker Keenan Whitehurst. "It's
probably our biggest match so
far."
Specifically, Stanford must be
able to overcome a team that pos
sesses the most complete arsenal

in the country. The Bruins'jump
serving is their most powerful
weapon; four UCLA starters
deliver lethal serves, with middle
blocker Jeff Nygaard ranked sec
ond in the nation in aces (.474 per
game).
"The two league teams that
have beaten us have been strong
jump-serving teams," said Stan
ford coach Ruben Nieves. "UCLA
is one of the best jump-serving
teams in the country — they real
ly rely on it to set up their points.
The big question is going to be
how we handle it."
As always, passing will also be
a crucial concern for Stanford
this weekend. After strong serve
receive performances against
Long Beach State and USC, the
Cardinal lagged against Universi
ty of the Pacific and Northridge.
On top of its strong serving,
UCLA — with solid passing and a
phalanx of top hitters — also
boasts one of the most effective
side-out games in the country.
Leading the Bruins is Nygaard, a
player with the national team
who has already won a bronze
medal in the world champi
onships and will probably start in
next year's Olympics in Atlanta.
Nygaard is third in the country in
hitting percentage with .452.
