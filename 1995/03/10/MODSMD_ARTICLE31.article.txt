# Volleyball faces nation's top team
## No. 1 UCLA's jump-serving ability poses powerful threat 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
One question which any men's
volleyball team with aspirations
for the NCAA championship
must answer is, "Can you beat
No. 1 UCLA?"
Stanford (10-3 overall, 7-2 in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration) will answer that ques
tion tomorrow night in Pauly
Pavilion. After that match, the
Cardinal will have to collect itself
and face 12th-ranked UC-Irvine
the very next night.
After losing to Cal State-
Northridge last weekend, Stan
ford lost the No. 1 position in the
Pacific Division and fell one place
— to third — in the national
rankings. The new No. 2, Hawaii,
met the Bruins Wednesday night,
losing in five games. This week
end therefore holds particular
importance for the Cardinal,
which is working hard to regain
the Pacific crown and to prove
itself a potential national champi
on. UCLA (13-1, 9-0 in the
MPSF) is the major obstacle.
"This is definitely a big
match," said freshman middle
blocker Keenan Whitehurst. "It's
probably our biggest match so
far."
Specifically, Stanford must be
able to overcome a team that pos
sesses the most complete arsenal

in the country. The Bruins'jump
serving is their most powerful
weapon; four UCLA starters
deliver lethal serves, with middle
blocker Jeff Nygaard ranked sec
ond in the nation in aces (.474 per
game).
"The two league teams that
have beaten us have been strong
jump-serving teams," said Stan
ford coach Ruben Nieves. "UCLA
is one of the best jump-serving
teams in the country — they real
ly rely on it to set up their points.
The big question is going to be
how we handle it."
As always, passing will also be
a crucial concern for Stanford
this weekend. After strong serve
receive performances against
Long Beach State and USC, the
Cardinal lagged against Universi
ty of the Pacific and Northridge.
On top of its strong serving,
UCLA — with solid passing and a
phalanx of top hitters — also
boasts one of the most effective
side-out games in the country.
Leading the Bruins is Nygaard, a
player with the national team
who has already won a bronze
medal in the world champi
onships and will probably start in
next year's Olympics in Atlanta.
Nygaard is third in the country in
hitting percentage with .452.
"We've got to make sure he

doesn't have a monster match
against us," Nieves said. "The diffi
culty with UCLA is that they have
five very potent hitters, so you
can't just key in one hitter. They
also have a setter who attacks
more than most setters do."
Nieves points to tough serving
as the primary tactic to counter
such a strong offense. Stanford
must disrupt the Bruins' serve
receive in order to limit UCLA's
offensive options.
The Cardinal will also use a
somewhat ironic strategy in its
attempt to conquer UCLA, by tak
ing advantage of the fact that the
Bruins are so good.
"They're really good at playing
well all the time, but I don't think
they are challenged all the time,"
said sophomore setter Stewart
Chong. "So, they're not quite as
good at adjusting when they start
losing — we just have to rattle
them early. We need to win a game
early and see if they can come back
and beat us."
The Bruins have demonstrated
vulnerability in the last week, los
ing to unranked Ball State in three
games. Stanford hopes to add its
own dent to this chink in UCLA's
armor.
"Stanford is a talented team,"

said UCLA coach A 1 Scates, "so its
going to be another tough match. I
hope our players will keep the Ball
State loss in mind when we play
teams like UC-Irvine or UCSD, but
it doesn't have much to do with
playing a team of the caliber of
Stanford."
Despite its perennial under
achieving record, UC-Irvine (6-6,
4-6 in the MPSF) has shown
marked improvement this season.
When Stanford faces the Anteaters
Saturday night, it will have to be
on guard against a squad that has
already defeated Pepperdine twice.
"It's going to be a key match,"
Nieves said. "I consider it to be the
one we really have to win. UCI is a
very good team, and anyone who
thinks that it's going to be easy is
in for a rude awakening."
The Anteaters field a very tall
lineup featuring standout opposite
hitter Leland Quinn. A 6-foot, 9-
inch southpaw, Quinn is hard to
stop when he's hot.
More importantly than any spe
cific factors, the Cardinal will fight
a war of intensity and concentra
tion against UCI. The Anteaters
are known as an intense and tena
cious team, whereas Stanford's
inconsistent mental game has
proven one of its biggest letdowns.
"[UCI] plays the game very
hard," Nieves said. "We've failed
sometimes to keep up our intensi
ty. I hope we've learned our lesson
and I hope we're ready to play."
