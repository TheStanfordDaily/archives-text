# Getting the least out of your finals
## 
### 
It's not that your expertise is doubt
ed; it's not that you aren't the bril
liant young genius your mother still
insists you are; it's not that you would
ever even need to retake a class in order
to get into Yale Law School — it's just
that there are few tricks for getting
your eight grand's worth out of Dead
Week and finals that you might not yet
know.
The following compilation of concepts
may be of some use over the next two
weeks. Use liberally.
They're just grades
Internalize this and little of the fol
lowing will be necessary.
Grades are inherently arbitrary — let
ters randomly assigned to placate a pro
fessor's legal obligation to the bell curve.
B +'s are the mark of a TA who knows
less about a subject than you do but feels
the need to bash in order to justify a sev
enth year of postsecondary schooling.
The final designation of a grade changes
nothing about who you are or what you
have taken away from any given class.
Sometimes the absolute inanity of the
grading system is made unabashedly
obvious. Take the Hum Bio core: the
respective courses — A side and B side —
have been named so for a reason,
because that's what you're going to get
(though A side/B-minus side would be
somewhat more accurate).
Shaving
No need.
But do be careful when indulging in
apeness — sweats can cling to a set of
unshorn drumsticks like velcro and
ingrown neck hairs can become quite
infected when not promptly popped.
Lecture notes
Chances are:
a) you haven't taken any;

b) others you know have;
c) theirs are better than yours would
have been anyway;
d) you want to borrow them.
This (d) is not impossible, even with
the most competitive of pre-meds. A sim
ple technique is to spot someone who
takes their impeccable notes in a spiral
notebook. Ask if they have the notes for
February 18, or any other specific day,
and if you might please be able to borrow
them, for an hour or so, to copy them
over. (If they hesitate in the lending, dis
tract by asking "Are you dating anyone?
Because I happen to know of someone
who has a big crush on you and asked me
to find out.")
Take the notes immediately to a
Xerox machine and copy thoroughly.
Return notebook within the hour. Be
sure to say "thank you."
Appraise the notes. Mark the days that
are missing or are less than half the length
of the longest. Find someone cute who you
have wanted to talk to anyway and ask
them for the notes for those specific days.
Also ask if they are dating anyone.
Take-home tests
A deceptively favorable testing venue.
The professors' notion that they imply
more intricate detailing on the students'
part is a highly fortuitous delusion.
Treat a take-home like a paper that
does not need to be researched or written
with any style. Simply say what needs to
be said and quote extensively from the

course reader.
Extensions on take-home tests
Key words: flirt, rhower and presume.
The latter implies that one should not
so much ask for an extension as make
statements which presume that one will be
received. For example, "Well, I was having
some trouble and I thought you'd give me
some more time to make sure I wrote the
best paper I could. After all, I know you
wouldn't want me to hand in something
knowing I could improve on it."
Actually taking that test
If a TA won't answer your mid-test
questions, giving you that magic puzzle
piece you need, pull the Mom 'n Dad rou
tine: Go back to your seat and ask a dif
ferent TA ten minutes later.
Also, if you have an extra few
moments after filling out a Scantron
sheet, turn it on it's side and stare at it
for a while. Unfocus your eyes and try to
look through it. If a picture of a unicorn
appears, you know you've gotten every
thing right.
Those extra five minutes
Make no mistake, this is the crucial
time slot. More points are racked up —
nay, rescued — in this precious, stolen
infinity than at any other portion of the
test.
So if you have ten questions left, no
time on the clock and TA-man is hover
ing behind, do whatever is necessary to
score those extra moments.
If your feeling particularly unhag
gard, shameless flirtation is a good move.
"Just one more minute baby and I'll be
all yours."
Conclusion
Remember: If you don't spell your
name right on the honor code, it doesn't
count.
