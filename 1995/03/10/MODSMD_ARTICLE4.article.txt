## 
### Victor Wishna 
Stanford's Institute for Re
search on Women and Gender
will mark its 20th anniversary to
morrow with an event to bring
scholars, faculty and students to
gether in celebration.
Sherri Matteo, the institute's
deputy director, described the
theme of this year's annual bene
fit as "a 20-year retrospective
look at research and scholarship
on women and gender." Sched
uled activities include presenta
tions by former institute direc
tors on topics ranging from the
media to the economy, as well as
an evening reception hosted by
University President Gerhard
Casper and his wife Regina, a

psychiatry professor.
"This event celebrates the
birth and continued development
of a critical field of study that has
had far-reaching implications,
not only on other scholars but on
policy-makers, corporate leaders,
foundations and individuals from
every walk of life," Matteo said.
The institute, the oldest of its
kind in the nation, was founded
in 1974 by a group of Stanford
faculty and graduate students
who wanted to explore the
emerging scholarship on women
and gender issues, as well as have
"a safe place" to hold discussions,
Matteo said.
"Research on women has

helped improve the lives of
women and their families in so
many ways," Matteo said. "Twen
ty years ago, we didn't have the
words, much less the research, to
identify domestic violence, sexual
harassment, eating disorders —
just to name a few topical areas
— and so we weren't very effec
tive in helping people who fell
into those categories.
"With the avalanche of
research, we now know a great
deal more about the problems of
our society and can be more effec
tive in developing strategies for
change," she said.
This weekend's event is also
the target date for completion of
an Oral History Project on the
institute, conducted by three
Stanford undergraduates since
last summer.
Juniors Eleanor Lewis, Victo
ria Foster and Katie Peterson
completed 24 interviews with
women and men who were influ
ential in the institute's develop
ment. Grants from the Under
graduate Research Opportunities
program, as well as from the
institute and the Stanford Oral
History Project, helped fund their
research.
"It was an incredible opportu
nity to interview some of the
most important women on this
campus," said Lewis. "[They are]
some of the fust tenured women
— people who faced real struggles
to get permanent positions at the
University even though they are
incredible scholars."
Foster shared this enthusi
asm, adding that, as a history
major, she was naturally drawn
to the project. According to
Lewis, all three students
approached the project with dif

ferent academic perspectives, but
they shared a common bond.
"We're strong feminists," she
said. "And we're not afraid to say
it."
Meanwhile, the project has
evolved into something much
larger than its creators anticipat
ed — currently, the report com
prises 120 single-spaced pages.
"We wanted it to be really thor
ough — true to the interviews
and true to the amount of time
and energy and effort that these
women had put into building the
institute," said Lewis, who hopes
to have a working draft ready for
tomorrow's celebration.
Matteo praised the students'
efforts. "I think the Oral History
Project is terrific and I am grate
ful to the undergrads who made it
happen," she said.
Lewis said she feels the project
is extremely important, not only
as a record of the past, but
because of its message for the
future. The report's final section
discusses the importance of the
institute, and why it must contin
ue to exist.
"There is still a need for sepa
rate organizations for and about
women as different from men,"
Lewis said. "The differences
between women and men, regard
less of where those differences lie,
have important impacts on the
lives of women and men today."
Event speakers include cur
rent institute director and Pedi
atrics Prof. Iris Litt, and Educa
tion Prof. Deborah Rhode and
History Prof. Judith Brown, both
former directors of the Institute.
The program is open to the entire
Stanford community.
In addition to scholarly pursuits,
the institute sponsors several activ
ities in which community members
and students can participate,
including the weekly Jing Lyman
Lecture Series and Women's
Health Research Seminars.
