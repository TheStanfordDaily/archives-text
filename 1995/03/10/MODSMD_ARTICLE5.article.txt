# Casper: no appeal of Grey
## 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
Citing limited resources and a lack of
strong community support, University
President Gerhard Casper announced
yesterday that Stanford will not appeal
the recent court decision invalidating the
Grey Interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard, Stanford's policy on verbal ha
rassment.
Reading a prepared statement before
the Faculty Senate, Casper criticized the
court ruling against the Grey Interpreta
tion but said the potential benefits of an
appeal are not enough to justify spending
University resources.
"Afler consulting with others on the
matter and after listening to arguments
on both sides," Casper said, "I have ...
concluded that ... Stanford should not

appeal the decision of
the Santa Clara County
Superior Court."
Adopted in 1990, the
Grey Interpretation pro
hibited speech that in
sulted an individual or
small group with dis
criminatory epithets,
was addressed directly at
an individual and em-

ployed "insulting or 'fighting' words or
nonverbal symbols" commonly construed
as expressions of hate.
Santa Clara County Superior Court
Judge Peter Stone struck down the Grey
Interpretation last week under the
Leonard Law, a California state law which
forbids private universities like Stanford
from abridging student speech that would
be protected off campus under the First

Amendment and the state constitution.
Private institutions are normally not
subject to constitutional free-speech pro
visions.
Casper criticized Stone's decision yes
terday, saying the legal issues involved are
less clear than allowed by Stone's deci
sion, as well as the arguments of the Stan
ford students who sued the University
last year.
"I confess to possessing less certainty
about absolute positions than do the
plaintiffs," Casper said, his voice faltering
as he spoke of his own experience as a
young child in Nazi Germany, "where
racism had become government polity."
Casper questioned the reasoning of
R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, a 1992 Supreme
Court decision heavily cited in Stone's rul-


Casper
ing. In that case, the court ruled
that laws restricting speech cannot
target specific speech content, such
as race-discriminatory speech.
Casper also questioned the con
stitutionality of the Leonard Law,
suggesting it might violate First
Amendment rights to free speech
and free association by extending
government influence over the
affairs of private universities.
Though he agreed that private
universities should voluntarily
respect the rights of students,
Casper said there are certain
advantages in preserving the
autonomy of private universities.
" 'Respect for personal honor
and the rights of others as is
demanded of good citizens:' "
Casper said, quoting the Funda
mental Standard. "That a universi
ty should not be able to do some
thing in that direction ... 100
years after adoption of the Funda
mental Standard says something
about where our country has
moved."
Despite his reservations about
the court ruling, the difficulties of
pursuing an appeal outweigh the
University's interest in doing so,
Casper said.
"In a perfect world of unlimited

resources, we might test the
court's ruling further," he said.
"We do not live in that perfect
world."
Another factor, Casper said, was
that there has never been a strong
consensus behind the Grey Inter
pretation in the Stanford commu
nity.
"At the time the Grey Interpre
tation was adopted, there was a fair
amount of ambivalence on campus
about it," Casper said. "[Then-Uni
versity President] Don Kennedy
thought very hard about it, was
very troubled by it all."
Similarly, few share Casper's
view that the Leonard Law is an
unacceptable government intru
sion into University affairs, he said.
"I seem to be about the only per
son who is troubled by this intru
sion on private universities by the
state legislature," Casper said.
"Many very good people, even at
Stanford, don't appreciate my posi
tion on this point. If I have difficul
ty convincing even colleagues at
the Law School that there is an
important principle involved, then
how much greater will be my diffi
culty in convincing alumni, the
press, the public in general?"
An appeal might also make
Stanford appear awkward in the
eyes of the public, given that a civil
liberties issue is involved, Casper
said.
"Given the stance that has been

created [by the U.S. Supreme
Court]," Casper said, "I'm left in a
rhetorically impossible position if I
fight for the right to discipline stu
dents in conflict with First Amend
ment law.
"This particular case left me in a
position that was so unattractive
and so open to misunderstanding,"
he .idded.
The decision will not have as
great an effect on campus dis
course as some on both sides
believe, Casper said. Abandoning
the Grey Interpretation, he said,
will neither "unleash torrents of
hate speech" nor prevent the Uni
versity from punishing harass
ment.
"Harassment, threats and
intimidation continue to be unac
ceptable," he added. "Should they
go beyond what is protected by law,
we will invoke University disci
plinary procedures."
Casper also disputed the argu
ment that the Grey Interpretation
had a "chilling effect" on campus
discourse which will now be allevi
ated.
Even with the Grey Interpreta
tion in place, he said, "debate about
scholarly issues, as well as public
issues, has been and continues to
be uninhibited, robust and wide
open here," he said.
Law Prof. Thomas Grey, who
drafted the Grey Interpretation,
said he was not surprised that

Casper chose not to appeal the
court decision. Grey acknowledged
that appealing would have been
costly for the University and that
there was no guarantee of victory.
"There's no certainty of win
ning," Grey said, adding, however,
that he stands firm in his belief
that his interpretation was legally
viable.
Grey added that public relations
concerns also may have been a fac
tor in Casper's decision. He said
consideration of the Grey Interpre
tation has been colored by recent
national controversy over campus
hate-speech codes.
"I can understand wanting to
get that monkey off our backs,"
Grey said.
The students who filed suit
against the University were
pleased that Casper decided not to
appeal.
"We commend their decision;
Stanford did the right thing," said
plaintiff Rob Corry, a 1994 gradu
ate of the Law School.
"Stanford's motto is 'Let the
winds of freedom blow,' " Corry
said. "They are indeed blowing
today."
And despite his criticism of the
court decision, Casper's decision
not to appeal in some ways repre
sented an important change of
mind by the administration, said
another plaintiff, second-year law
student Scott Kupor.
