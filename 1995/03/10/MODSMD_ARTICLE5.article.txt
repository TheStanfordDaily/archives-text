# Casper: no appeal of Grey
## 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
Citing limited resources and a lack of
strong community support, University
President Gerhard Casper announced
yesterday that Stanford will not appeal
the recent court decision invalidating the
Grey Interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard, Stanford's policy on verbal ha
rassment.
Reading a prepared statement before
the Faculty Senate, Casper criticized the
court ruling against the Grey Interpreta
tion but said the potential benefits of an
appeal are not enough to justify spending
University resources.
"Afler consulting with others on the
matter and after listening to arguments
on both sides," Casper said, "I have ...
concluded that ... Stanford should not

appeal the decision of
the Santa Clara County
Superior Court."
Adopted in 1990, the
Grey Interpretation pro
hibited speech that in
sulted an individual or
small group with dis
criminatory epithets,
was addressed directly at
an individual and em-

ployed "insulting or 'fighting' words or
nonverbal symbols" commonly construed
as expressions of hate.
Santa Clara County Superior Court
Judge Peter Stone struck down the Grey
Interpretation last week under the
Leonard Law, a California state law which
forbids private universities like Stanford
from abridging student speech that would
be protected off campus under the First

Amendment and the state constitution.
Private institutions are normally not
subject to constitutional free-speech pro
visions.
Casper criticized Stone's decision yes
terday, saying the legal issues involved are
less clear than allowed by Stone's deci
sion, as well as the arguments of the Stan
ford students who sued the University
last year.
"I confess to possessing less certainty
about absolute positions than do the
plaintiffs," Casper said, his voice faltering
as he spoke of his own experience as a
young child in Nazi Germany, "where
racism had become government polity."
Casper questioned the reasoning of
R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, a 1992 Supreme
Court decision heavily cited in Stone's rul-
