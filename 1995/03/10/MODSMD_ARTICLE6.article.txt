# Fac Sen proposes decrease of DRs
## Also resolves to form committee designed to evaluate CIV success, effectiveness 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
passed two resolutions which
would lower the number of distrib
ution requirements and establish
regular reviews of the Cultures,
Ideas and Values program.
The first resolution aims to de
crease the total number of quarters
of DRs a student must take from 11
to nine.
Under the plan, a CIV course
would continue to count for the
Area 1 DR, in addition to fulfillinga
second DR from the areas of World
Cultures (Area 2); American Cul
tures (Area 3); Literature and the
Fine Arts (Area 7); Philosophical,
Social and Religious Thought (Area
8); or Social and Behavioral Sci
ences (Area 9).
Students would then take three
more humanities and social sci
ences courses as DRs.
The senate's Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies will now re
view the proposal and present a
plan to the senate.
The senate also passed an "alter
native" resolution to form a com
mittee to review the CIV program
within the next two years and every
five years after that.
According to the resolution's
text, "the central concern of these
reviews should be to determine the

success of CIV in meeting its pro
grammatic objectives."
After review by Dean of Human
ities and Sciences John Shoven and
Provost Condoleezza Rice, the al
ternative proposal will return to

the senate for
final approval.
The senate
passed both reso
lutions unani
mously.
English Prof.
John Bender de
veloped the alter
native resolution
in response to

widespread concern about other
proposals before the senate yester
day.
The first of these contested pro
posals recommended that Shoven
conduct regular reviews of the CIV
program and the second suggested
that a separate committee be
formed to examine the program at
a more fundamental level.
At the meeting, Bender said that
in creating the proposal he
"brought together the main con
cerns of [the contested proposals]
while simplifying those resolu
tions."
History Prof. James Sheehan,
chair of the Commission on Under
graduate Education, said he agreed
