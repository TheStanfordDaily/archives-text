# Flaming pants, nudity make Bonzon new Tree
## 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
Do you enjoy performing strip
teases? What about jumping off tall
buildings? Would you care to set
your pants on fire?
If so, we're sorry, but the job of
the Stanford Tree is now taken.
Freshman Chris Bonzon was
chosen Wednesday as the Tree —
the official mascot of the Leland
Stanford Junior University March
ing Band.
Neither the job requirements —
running wild with the band, being
mobbed by kids and occasionally
taking a few cheap shots from Oski
the Bear — nor the application
process bothered Bonzon, who has
been pulling stunts since the begin
ning of the week to get the job.
However, it wasn't until
Wednesday night that Bonzon's fu
ture become clear.
In one of the most original inter
views ever, Bonzon did "the craziest
thing I've ever seen in my life," said
former Tree Greg Siegel, who came
back just for the selection.
"He lit his pants on fire," Siegel
said. "He had this huge infrastruc
ture built up."
Normally, to become Tree, appli
cants have to go through a secret in
terview — which usually involves
some sort of stunt. Bonzon decided
to rile up his buddies in Donner and

build himself a human pyramid,
complete with ladders and other
materials, said Charles Good an, an
other former Tree. Goodan added
he could swear the pyramid was
"150 feet high."
Just for good measure, Bonzon
also set himself ablaze with ethanol.
"We've all seen 'Star Search' and
all I can say is, it was crazy," Siegel
said.
"Like, it was right out of 'The
Aeneid' or something," he added.
Actually, nothing really seemed
off limits to Bonzon, who stripped
several times during the past week,
once in Religious Studies 18 — Zen
Buddhism — which he claims he
mistook for Nudist Art. "Maybe
that was the one that pushed it over
the edge," Bonzon said.
Following tradition, the band
surprised Bonzon and his dorm
mates late Wednesday night with a
party, covering Bonzon with
sparkling cider.
Bonzon and crowd were quick to
respond, though. Stripping down to
his boxers, Bonzon danced hard
while his Donner friends chanted
"Bonzon's Tree."
Bonzon "epitomizes the Tree —
he's a madman," freshman Tom
Lee, one of Bonzon's dormmates,
told the crowd.
Bonzon did have one promise to
make, now that he's the Tree: "No
more naked bodies."
