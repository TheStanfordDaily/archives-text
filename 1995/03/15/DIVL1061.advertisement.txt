Work at a weekly newspaper in California this summer and earn a
reporter's salary!
Students can write and report the news, or work in advertising, circulation,
or production. Internships generally last about 12 weeks. Here are some
comments from past interns:
Intern for the Highlander Weeklies:
"I wrote about city budget crises, World War II veterans, female pilots, young
entrepreneurs and the opening of the county fair. I even tried my hand at
sports writing and editing." -Emily Dazar
Intern for the San Jose City Times
"All in all, I've had a great summer! I have learned many new things, met a
lot of cool people, and generally had a great time!" -Beth Berselli
Intern for South County News
"I definitely got to experience every aspect of real-world journalism during
my internship...working in a large newspaper chain was very enlightening."
