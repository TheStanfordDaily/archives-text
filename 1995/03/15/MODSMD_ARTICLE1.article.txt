# Senators OK new fee plan
## Bill would create 3 student groups

Last night the ASSU Senate
tried onee again to reform the spe

ly approving a constitutional
amendment which would split the
voters into three categories.
The amendment will now be
put on the ballot for students to
vote on in the April election.

graduate and both undergradu

junior Jon Oram, the bill's co-au

wanted to ask for funding. Only
members of that group would be
eligible to vote on that group's
special fee, Oram added.
A special fee would be ap

the votes cast within the chosen
group, and if those in favor consti

in the group, Oram added.
