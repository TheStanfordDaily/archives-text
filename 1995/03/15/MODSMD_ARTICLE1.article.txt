# Senators OK new fee plan
## Bill would create 3 student groups 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Last night the ASSU Senate
tried onee again to reform the spe
cial-fee system by overwhelming
ly approving a constitutional
amendment which would split the
voters into three categories.
The amendment will now be
put on the ballot for students to
vote on in the April election.
The senate also failed to pass
an amendment which would have
refunded the excess special-fee re
fund buffer back to students.
Both amendments were intro
duced in response to January's
defeat of the Balanced Funding
Deal, another special-fee reform
proposal. That measure received
almost 50 percent of the vote, but
failed to get the requisite two
thirds majority needed for enact
ment.
The bill — entitled the Com
mon Sense Fee-Reform Amend
ment and supported by both the
People's Platform and Students'
Alliance parties — would divide
the student body into three popu
lation groups: undergraduate,
graduate and both undergradu
ates and graduates, according to
junior Jon Oram, the bill's co-au
thor and Stanford-in-Govern
ment's treasurer.
Each student group would de
cide which of the three groups it
wanted to ask for funding. Only
members of that group would be
eligible to vote on that group's
special fee, Oram added.
A special fee would be ap
proved if it received a majority of
the votes cast within the chosen
group, and if those in favor consti
tuted 15 percent of eligible voters
in the group, Oram added.
The Common Sense Amend
ment "guarantees that the power
is in the hands of the students,"
said co-sponsor and senate associ
ate Bill Shen. "Students' rights are
protected, students' money is pro
tected, and students are protected."
Undergraduate senator Andr6
Vanier, a co-sponser of the bill,
said the new amendment is superi
or to the Balanced Funding Deal.
"It addresses the concerns of
Students' Alliance raised in Jan
uary as to the fairness and equity
of the (Balanced Funding Deal)
measure," Vanier said. "Specifical
ly, this bill preserves the right to a
fee refund."
If this plan had been in effect
last year, all groups with the excep
tion of the "You Can Make a Dif
ference" conference — which did
not receive a majority of votes

from undergraduates — would
have received special-fee funding,
Oram said.
"Student organizations which
receive special fees may not
deprive anyone of services, unless
they have taken a refund," Oram
said. "Any graduate who wants to
use an undergraduate group can
do so simply by paying the amount
of the special fee." However,
groups do not have to require this
payment.
Under the plan, Oram estimat
ed that fees would rise for under
graduates from $37 a quarter to
$40 a quarter and decrease for
graduate students from $37 a
quarter to $19 a quarter, because
most groups probably would not
ask graduates for funding.
The plan includes non-binding
recommendations that fee-refund
buffers — which are set by the
ASSU Financial Manager — be
eliminated. However, this action

would be up to the senate, Oram
said, since it involves a by-law
change.
Rather, the groups would be
allowed a line-item in the budgets
they submit which could total a
maximum of 10 percent of their
budget for buffers, Oram said.
This is about the rate at which
undergraduates refund their spe
cial fees.
Oram admitted that this provi
sion might cause problems for
groups who applied for funds from
the combined graduate and under
graduate group, since the fee
refund rate is much higher for
graduates. These groups might not
be able to buffer enough against
the higher refund rate.
In that case, the senate could
allow these groups to add a 20 per
cent fee-refund buffer, raising
undergraduate fees to approxi
mately $41 or $42, Oram said.
Vanier said he thought the bill

had a better chance of passing
than the Balanced Funding Deal
did.
Also last night, senators voted
down a proposal which would have
refunded to the students the
unused portion of student groups'
fee-refund buffers.
This amendment, however,
became obsolete with the passage
of the Common Sense bill, Vanier
said.
Undergraduate senator and co
sponsor Smeeta Ramarathnam
disagreed, saying that the amend
ment is necessary because the
Common Sense bill does not
address the fee-refund buffer
issue.
"It does not deal with the
refund buffers," she said. "It
makes recommendations, but it
cannot refund the buffers. This bill
allows refund buffers to be there,
but just refunds the money not
used back to the students."
