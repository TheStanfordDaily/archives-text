# After 18 years, Jackson trades Cardinal for Trojan
## Dean seeks challenges at USC 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
When asked if he would be able
to effectively transfer his loyalties
to the USC football team, Dean of
Students Michael Jackson refused
to comment.
After spending 18 years of his
life at Stanford, Jackson will leave
Stanford this month to assume the
position of vice president for stu
dent affairs at the University of
Southern California.
"It's time to graduate," Jackson
said as he took a moment to glance
out the window of his office on the
third floor of Old Union. Jackson
graduated from Stanford in 1972

with a bachelor's degree in anthro
pology. Later he received his doc
torate in education administration
at the University of Massachusetts
before he returned to Stanford in
1980.
"The best part about being at
Stanford is that it is an incredibly
positive place," Jackson said. "You
can't find a more engaging envi
ronment. You're always meeting
students who are about the
future."
Yet the allure and challenge of a
new environment are pulling Jack
son — and his wife Diana Akiyama,
assistant dean of Memorial Church
— down south. Akiyama will be
studying to obtain her doctorate in

religion and will teach classes in
religion and feminist studies. Jack
son will oversee 250 staff members
and 48 programs. He presently
works with a stafT of 50.
Jackson said Stanford has given
him more than he can adequately
describe. During his time at the
Farm, Jackson said he especially
eryoyed the year he spent as a resi
dent fellow in Donner.
"Living in an all-frosh dorm was
probably the most exhilarating
professional and personal experi
ence that I've had in terms of pure
deluxe fun," he said.
Yet his job has had its stresses

as well. Jackson said his most diffi
cult responsibility has been talking
to the parents of students who have
died or suffered in a serious way.
In addition, Jackson said that on
an institutional level budget cuts
have been tough on everyone in
higher education.
Over the past three years the

University has cut its budget by
approximately 40 percent, he said.
"I am proud of the efforts the
University has made just to make it
through this difficult budget-cut
ting process and maintain creativi
ty and excellence in the future,"
Jackson said.
Jackson, who grew up in Los
Angeles, is enthusiastic about
returning to the endless variety of
culture and scenery that can be
found in Southern California. He is
particularly anxious to see his fam

ily, his friends and the Dodgers.
"It will be a great test for me,"
Jackson said. "I've been gone from
L.A. for 30 years. I'm looking for
ward to living in a city. I've often
said that I wish Stanford was either
closer to or in San Francisco. Even
though I love the Farm, I've missed
going to concerts."
Jackson said he is also eager to
put to use the administrative skills
he developed during his years at
Stanford.
In his new position, Jackson will

help students take an active role in
the progress of the institution.
Jackson said he hopes to encourage
energy and creativity in the student
affairs program.
"What you have to do is take
advantage of the urban environ
ment," Jackson said. "You have to
extend the borders of the classroom
and the institution beyond the
gates of the university."
While Jackson is confident that
USC is already among the ranks of
the best universities in the nation,

he said he will still miss the sand
stone buildings and red tile roofs
that make up Stanford's unique
character.
"I will miss the environment
here," Jackson said. "It's a very
beautiful place. But I've got it pret
ty focused in my mind's eye."
Jackson said he will also miss his
Stanford friends.
"I like to keep friends in college
for life," Jackson said. "It's not
'goodbye.' It's 'See you soon, give
me a call if you need some help.' "
