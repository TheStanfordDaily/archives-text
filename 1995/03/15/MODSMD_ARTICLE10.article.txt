# After 18 years, Jackson trades Cardinal for Trojan
## Dean seeks challenges at USC 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
When asked if he would be able
to effectively transfer his loyalties
to the USC football team, Dean of
Students Michael Jackson refused
to comment.
After spending 18 years of his
life at Stanford, Jackson will leave
Stanford this month to assume the
position of vice president for stu
dent affairs at the University of
Southern California.
"It's time to graduate," Jackson
said as he took a moment to glance
out the window of his office on the
third floor of Old Union. Jackson
graduated from Stanford in 1972

with a bachelor's degree in anthro
pology. Later he received his doc
torate in education administration
at the University of Massachusetts
before he returned to Stanford in
1980.
"The best part about being at
Stanford is that it is an incredibly
positive place," Jackson said. "You
can't find a more engaging envi
ronment. You're always meeting
students who are about the
future."
Yet the allure and challenge of a
new environment are pulling Jack
son — and his wife Diana Akiyama,
assistant dean of Memorial Church
— down south. Akiyama will be
studying to obtain her doctorate in

religion and will teach classes in
religion and feminist studies. Jack
son will oversee 250 staff members
and 48 programs. He presently
works with a stafT of 50.
Jackson said Stanford has given
him more than he can adequately
describe. During his time at the
Farm, Jackson said he especially
eryoyed the year he spent as a resi
dent fellow in Donner.
"Living in an all-frosh dorm was
probably the most exhilarating
professional and personal experi
ence that I've had in terms of pure
deluxe fun," he said.
Yet his job has had its stresses
