# Students' Alliance slate aims for independence

Members of the Students'
Alliance Council of Presidents
slate know what they want to
accomplish — to be different
from the People's Platform party
running against them.
"People's Platform runs under
the supposition that they repre
sent everyone and can do every
thing everyone wants," said
undergraduate senator Michelle
Gee, one of the slate members.
"In past years, they have not
been able to do everything. Cer
tain issues have been left in the
dust."
This year's ASSU election will
see slates fronted by two serious
political parties for the first time
since 1992. In this atmosphere,
Students' Alliance knows it will
have to work to win.
Entitled "Let's Be Candid,"
the slate consists of Gee, former
Interfraternity Council President
Tom Baranowski, COP cabinet
member Rachel Hall and gradu
ate senator Curtis Kin.
"There's a lot to be done on
campus," Hall said. "We bring a
new perspective."
"The biggest thing we are
dealing with is the scaling back in

resources contributed to student
issues," Baranowski said. "The
ASSU is currently the only body
which students have to say some
thing to recapture and prevent
the erosion of student program
ming. Otherwise, we will start
losing what is special about Stan
ford."
In contrast to other COP
slates, however, this slate intends
to be honest about its limitations,
Kin said.
"We refuse to promise the
world," Kin said. "We're candid
about tangible goals — what we
promise now, we will deliver."
Baranowski agreed. "We don't
want to promise anything that
we think we can't deliver," he
said. "We have seen COPs come
and go who say they will get Taco
Bell and get sorority houses —
and nothing happens."
One of the tangible projects
which the slate will work on is a
student coursebook, Hall said.
The book would contain reviews
of courses and professors and
would aid all students, especially
freshmen, in choosing classes,
she added.
Kin said they would also make
a graduate student handbook.
