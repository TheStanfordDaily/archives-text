# Students' Alliance slate aims for independence
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Members of the Students'
Alliance Council of Presidents
slate know what they want to
accomplish — to be different
from the People's Platform party
running against them.
"People's Platform runs under
the supposition that they repre
sent everyone and can do every
thing everyone wants," said
undergraduate senator Michelle
Gee, one of the slate members.
"In past years, they have not
been able to do everything. Cer
tain issues have been left in the
dust."
This year's ASSU election will
see slates fronted by two serious
political parties for the first time
since 1992. In this atmosphere,
Students' Alliance knows it will
have to work to win.
Entitled "Let's Be Candid,"
the slate consists of Gee, former
Interfraternity Council President
Tom Baranowski, COP cabinet
member Rachel Hall and gradu
ate senator Curtis Kin.
"There's a lot to be done on
campus," Hall said. "We bring a
new perspective."
"The biggest thing we are
dealing with is the scaling back in

resources contributed to student
issues," Baranowski said. "The
ASSU is currently the only body
which students have to say some
thing to recapture and prevent
the erosion of student program
ming. Otherwise, we will start
losing what is special about Stan
ford."
In contrast to other COP
slates, however, this slate intends
to be honest about its limitations,
Kin said.
"We refuse to promise the
world," Kin said. "We're candid
about tangible goals — what we
promise now, we will deliver."
Baranowski agreed. "We don't
want to promise anything that
we think we can't deliver," he
said. "We have seen COPs come
and go who say they will get Taco
Bell and get sorority houses —
and nothing happens."
One of the tangible projects
which the slate will work on is a
student coursebook, Hall said.
The book would contain reviews
of courses and professors and
would aid all students, especially
freshmen, in choosing classes,
she added.
Kin said they would also make
a graduate student handbook.
"The fundamental concern of
graduate students is that they
don't know what goes on [in the
ASSUI," Kin said. "We would
create a graduate student hand
book for the ASSU to explain to
graduate students what the
function of the ASSU is, where
their money is going and what
services are available."
Baranowski said he would
also continue to work on getting
sorority houses.
In order to foster communi
cation among student groups
and increase awareness of cam
pus resources, a student
database would be created
which could be accessed
through the World Wide Web,
Hall said.
Slate members said they felt
that their unique combination
of experiences would allow them
to best represent Stanford stu

dents.
"We are four individuals who
can work well as a team," Kin
said. "We reach out to the resi
dence, graduate and Greek com
munities. We are much more in
touch with the student body.
When we meet with University
administrators we [will be] a
better voice for students."
Kin said that because he is a
"true" graduate student, as
opposed to a co-terminal stu
dent, he would represent gradu
ate students better.
"I come with a true graduate
perspective," Kin said. "I'm
aware of what graduate stu
dents want. The only problem
with co-terms is that they have
been at Stanford [for several
years]. They have a perspective
and an institutional memory
that are not representative of
the majority of graduate stu
dents."
Hall said her experience as a
transfer student would help her
better understand other trans

fer students and freshmen since
she could relate to the new stu
dent perspective.
However, senate associate
and People's Platform senate
candidate Bill Shen criticized
the slate for being "a bunch of
self-interested, resume-packing,
hypocritical students who we
can't trust to responsibly repre
sent the students of Stanford."
Baranowski dismissed Shen's
criticism.
Shen "has no knowledge
about what me or the other peo
ple running for COP are about,"
Baranowski said. "I hope people
could be more mature and real
ize that this is not an election
for world supremacy, but an
election for Stanford students."
Students' Alliance has
endorsed four additional senate
candidates, said party co-chair
Andr§ Vanier. The candidates
are sophomores Alex Breen and
Eve Veliz, and graduate stu
dents Scott Kupor and Richard
Barnett.
