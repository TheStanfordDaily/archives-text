Naked man seen jogging
Many have heard of sleeping or swimming in
the nude, but how about jogging in the buff?
A woman running near the Interstate 280
entrance off Junipero Serra Boulevard on March
3 witnessed the act firsthand.
The woman noticed a man wearing only white
socks, running shoes and wire-rimmed glasses
jogging toward her.
Once the naked man noticed the woman, he
quickly threw on a pair of maroon jogging shorts
that he was holding in his hand. The woman
jogged about 100 yards past the newly clothed
man and glanced back only to find that he had
taken off his shorts and was running toward her
again.
The woman hailed a couple walking their dog,
but when she attempted to point out the nude
man, he was gone.
"We do have this happen every so often," said
Stanford Police Sgt. John McMullen.
Police officials have received reports of people
riding bikes and even motorcycles naked, he
added.
The nude jogger was identified as a white male
in his late 20s or early 30s. The man is about 6
feet tall with a thin build, blond hair and a reced
ing hairline.
Peeping Tom reported
A peeping Tom took his voyeurism a bit too far

on March 2 when he peeked in on a female resi
dent taking a shower in Roble Hall.
According to Stanford Police Sgt. John
McMullen, an unidentified male snuck into the
women's shower room on the third floor about
11:30 a.m.
A woman showering at the time heard a suspi
cious noise just beyond her shower stall and
noticed the silhouette of a person coming toward
her, McMullen said. A strange man then pressed
his face against the clouded glass of the shower
door. The woman yelled at the man and he ran off,
McMullen added.
According to Stanford Police, the voyeur has
not yet been found.
Computer equipment stolen
Computer equipment was reported stolen last
Monday from the Lewis Lab located in the Beck
man Center near the Stanford Hospital.
According to Stanford Police Sgt. John
McMullen, the thief took $1,884 worth of comput
er hardware equipment, including a hard drive
and a data digital audio tape.
It took administrators within the lab a couple
weeks to realize that the equipment had been
stolen because it supports a back-up computer
system they don't often use.
Police officials said they have no leads on the
burglar.
