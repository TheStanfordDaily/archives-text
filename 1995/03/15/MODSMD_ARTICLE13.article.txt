## Storm leaves mess 
### 
CASTROVILLE, Calif. (AP)
— Residents of the "Artichoke
Capital of the World" surveyed
their mudcaked town yesterday,
sodden furniture drying on
sidewalks and possibly contami
nated water flowing from their
taps.
"I don't know if we'll come
back, but we don't have any
money to move anywhere,"
Alberta Rivera said, weeping as
she tried to salvage belongings
in the flooded home she shared
with her husband and three
children.
The grim scenario was
replayed in nearby Pajaro, in
the streets of San Jose, in
swamped Salinas Valley farm
land and beneath towering red
woods along the Russian River
to the north as a respite from
weeklong rains gave Califor
nia's flood victims a chance to
take stock and start the
cleanup.
The storms, the second to
slam California in less than
three months, are blamed for at
least 13 deaths — including five
people who died when their cars
plunged off a collapsed bridge
on Interstate 5 near Coalinga —
and three people who are miss
ing and presumed dead. About
7,000 people were evacuated,
and more than 1,000 remained
in shelters Monday night.
White House Chief of Staff

Leon Panetta and about a dozen
other federal and state officials
toured the areas hard hit by
flooding, including San Jose,
Watsonville, Monterey and
along the Russian River north
of San Francisco.
Gov. Pete Wilson yesterday
added nine additional counties
to his request for federal disas
ter assistance, bringing the
total number of counties which
have been declared to be in a
state of emergency to 48.
The state Department of
Food and Agriculture issued an
estimate of $303 million in crop
and livestock losses so far,
including $67 million in lettuce,
$65 million each in cauliflower
and broccoli and $33 million in
almonds.
Some people were able to
joke about the mess. Jack Mur
ray, a retired tire salesman, saw
the lower story of his house
flooded twice this winter by the
Russian River. The latest storm
gobbled up about 20 feet of his
yard.
"Looking on the bright side, I
have less lawn to cut," Murray
said.
Though rain fell again across
Northern California yesterday,
it was less powerful than earlier
storms and conditions were
expected to improve today and
tomorrow, the National Weath
er Service said.
