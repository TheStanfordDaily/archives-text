DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Secretary of State
Warren Christopher announced yesterday that
peace talks between Israel and Syria, stalled for
three months, are resuming with the United
States playing a more active role in the search for
an accord on the strategic Golan Heights.
Christopher said Ambassadors Itamar Rabi
novich of Israel and Walid al-Moualem of Syria
would reopen the negotiations "very soon" in
Washington and would be joined in time by mil
itary experts, including the two countries' chiefs
of staff.
Dennis Ross, the principal adviser to Christo
pher on the Middle East, will participate — mak
ing suggestions to the two sides — and go to the
region in about two weeks for further talks.
Also, a U.S. official said, a security committee
will be formed, including U.S., Israeli and Syrian
representatives, in another move to bring the

Clinton administration more directly into the
search for a peace treaty. It has eluded negotia
tors for more than 40 months while Israel struck
agreements with the Palestine Liberation Orga
nization and with Jordan.
"I am satisfied there will be give-and-take
bargaining," Christopher said.
However, he gave no indication that Israel
and Syria had agreed on the issues dividing
them. Primarily, these are the extent of a pull
back Israel would be willing to execute on the
Golan Heights and the kind of peace Syria would
extend in return.
The talks are expected to concentrate on
measures that could be taken to replace the
Israeli troops whose presence has sealed the
border for more than two decades and shielded
Israeli villages from the kind of cross-border
attacks that were common before the 1967 Six-

Day War.
"It's turned out to be one of the most satisfy
ing trips I've made to the Middle East," said
Christopher, who has been to the region 11
times in more than 25 months as secretary.
Israel has been eager to resume negotiations
with Syria, which were held between the two
ambassadors in Washington and in the last
phase involved negotiations between the Israeli
and Syrian military chiefs of staff.
Asked if Israel had to make a concession to
achieve a resumption, a senior U.S. official
replied tersely: "No."
In Jerusalem, Rabin told Israel Radio "there
is no possibility to achieve peace without with
drawal."
Assad, however, is insisting on total with
drawal from the territory Syria lost in the 1967
war.
