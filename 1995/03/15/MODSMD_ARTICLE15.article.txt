Joint mission takes off
BAIKONUR, Kazakhstan (AP) — A new
era of U.S.-Russian space cooperation
began yesterday when a Russian rocket
streaked into orbit carrying two cosmo
nauts and, for the first time, an American
astronaut.
The two nations that launched the
space race four decades ago had met in
space once previously, with the 1975 Apol
lo-Soyuz docking. But that was a one-shot
deal, a symbolic gesture in the age of
detente.
This time, both countries are committed
to a joint space program that is to lead to
construction of an international space sta
tion beginning in 1997.
"Our grandchildren will look back at
these times and read about them in the
history book as two countries began a long
process of cooperation in space," NASA

manager Tommy Holloway said at the
Baikonur Cosmodrome, 1,300 miles south
east of Moscow in Central Asia.
Four more NASA astronauts will travel
by space shuttle to the station Mir over the
next four years.
So far, two Russian cosmonauts have
flown on NASA's space shuttle.
Saving salmon
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Clinton
administration agreed yesterday to cover
the bulk of the new costs to save North
west salmon, sparing electric ratepayers
in the region additional increases in their
power bills.
The administration plan covers $90
million to $110 million of the $160 million
in additional annual costs anticipated
from the government's latest plans to save
the fish from extinction, Northwest con

gressional Democrats said at a news con
ference with Deputy Energy Secretary Bill
White.
The remaining $60 million or so would
be absorbed into the budget of the region's
federal power wholesaler — the Bon
neville Power Administration — with no
rate increases projected beyond the 5 per
cent boost recently announced, the law
makers said.
White said averting electricity rate
increases in the Northwest "has been one
of our foremost objectives" as the admin
istration has struggled with proposals to
protect the salmon, in large part by alter
ing operation of a series of hydropower
dams on the Columbia and Snake rivers.
"The administration has agreed with us
that it is unfair to make folks from Mon
tana and the Pacific Northwest shoulder
the entire cost of saving the salmon," said
Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.
