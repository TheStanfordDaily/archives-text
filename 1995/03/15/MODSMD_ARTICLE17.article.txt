# HUD head might have misled FBI

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Attor
ney General Janet Reno will seek
the appointment of an independent
counsel in order to investigate
charges that Housing Secretary
Henry Cisneros misled the FBI
about payments to his former mis
tress.
Cisneros denied all charges and
vowed to continue in office.
"Information provided by Secre
tary Cisneros concerning his pay
ments to (Linda) Medlar was false,"
Reno told a special court in docu
ments released yesterday. She
asked that the independent counsel
also investigate whether Cisneros
and Medlar conspired to conceal
information about the payments
during his confirmation to head the
Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
The three appellate judges on
the special court now must select a
counsel to decide whether Cisneros'
actions constitute a criminal viola
tion that should be prosecuted.
"I am disappointed by the deci
sion, but I ... am confident the
independent counsel will conclude
that I did not engage in criminal
wrongdoing," Cisneros told a news
conference at HUD. "I intend to
stay and to tight" for HUD pro
grams that help the poor.
Calling Cisneros "a good man
and an effective public servant,"
President Clinton said in a state
ment, "He says he regrets any mis

takes he has made. So do I. But that
does not outweigh the excellent
work he has been doing and will do
as secretary of housing and urban
development."
White House press secretary
Mike McCurry said Cisneros
offered to resign but the president
"said that would not be necessary."
During the FBI background
check before his nomination, Cis
neros acknowledged his affair with
Medlar and that he had been pay
ing her. "However, he also stated to
the FBI that he had paid her no
more than $2,500 at a time and no
more than $10,000 a year," Reno
wrote.
"In fact, he paid her more than
$2,500 at various times, and his
total annual payments to her were
between $42,000 and $60,000,"
Reno wrote. She added that Cis
neros gave his statement to the FBI
soon after he made a payment
"substantially larger than $2,500."
Medlar was not interviewed by
the FBI during Cisneros' back
ground investigation. Last Septem
ber, she sold transcripts of her tele
phone conversations with Cisneros
to the television program "Inside
Edition" and alleged that he lied to
the FBI about the amount of pay
ments.
On the transcripts, which trig
gered the Justice investigation, the
pair fretted about whether the pay
ments might derail his nomination.
