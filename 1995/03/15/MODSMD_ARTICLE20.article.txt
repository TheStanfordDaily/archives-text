HAVE YOU EVER tried to
park behind 553 Mayfield
in the middle of the day? If
you have, you know that it is
almost as hard as parking a Sub
urban in San Francisco (which, of
course, is impossible).
This campus is overrun with
cars. If the rush-hour traffic at
the intersection of Campus Drive
and Mayfield gets any worse, they
will have to put in a traffic light.
The University could build
more parking lots, make Campus
Drive into a four-lane expressway
and put in a slew of overpasses
and tunnels, putting Stanford at
the cutting edge of post-modern
urban / industrial campuses.
Or, we could try to leave as
much of "The Farm" (funny how
it looks less and less like a farm
every day) in its natural state as
possible, and try to provide better
forms of public transportation to
the Stanford community
The Marguerite shuttle, cur

rently the best form of public
transport available on the Stan
ford campus, only runs from 6:00
a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on weekdays.
And frequent riders say that the
buses are very often late.
The University should extend
the hours of Marguerite's opera
tions until at least 9 p.m. on
weekdays and expand its services
to run on weekends as well. The
addition of late-night Mar
guerites from the Caltrain sta
tion on University Avenue at
midnight (when the last train
returns from San Francisco) on
Fridays and Saturdays would let
students without cars spend the
evening in the City. Measures
should also be taken to ensure
the timeliness and reliability of
drivers.
Or, we could try to make Stan
ford look exactly like downtown
Los Angeles, which would make
all of our beloved Southern Cali
fornians feel right at home.
