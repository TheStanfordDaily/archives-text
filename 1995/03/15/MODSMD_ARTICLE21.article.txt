# Respect our speakers

HE CAME, he saw, he spoke.
A little more than a week
ago, Oliver North visited the
Farm to speak about the Republi
can takeover of Congress and his
own failed Senate race in Virginia in
a lecture sponsored by The Stan
ford Review, Stanford-in-Govern
ment and the ASSU Speakers
Bureau. Not surprisingly, the event
drew a much higher concentration
of conservative students than is
normally found on Stanford's over
whelmingly liberal campus.
North nevertheless encountered
a significant amount of criticism
from liberal students willing to give
him a piece of their minds. This
skepticism — however healthy —
unfortunately led to an unruly
question-and-answer session.
Although the former staff member
of the National Security Council
handled himself comfortably under
such attacks, the conduct of some
students was out of line.
Whether or not students agreed

with what North had to say, they
should have offered him the same
respect and courtesy that he
showed them in praising the quali
ty of the University. It is under
standable that North — best
known for his involvement in the
Iran-Contra scandal — would draw
some difficult questions from the
skeptical audience. The expectation
for such questions, however, should
in no way have been interpreted as
a license for flagrant attempts to
degrade and demean him. Several
members of the audience seemed
dead set on doing just that.
Of course, students should criti
cally examine any argument and
not apathetically sit back with sim
ple-minded acceptance. But they
should also remember that every
speaker deserves to be treated
decently, regardless of political per
suasion. We can only hope that for
mer Surgeon General Joycelyn
Elders' visit next quarter won't
arouse the same response.
