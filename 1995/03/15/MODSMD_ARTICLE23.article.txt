## Why do people do heroin ? 
### 
I THINK that most people will agree that
heroin is up there as one of the grand
daddies of all drugs. I would say that
shooting up fits in somewhere between
smoking crack and snorting cocaine. It is a
hard drug. But heroin has always had an
aura of mystery about it. Only a certain
type of individual would venture so far as to
do heroin, and I think that the culture we
live in is designed to secretly admire some
one who crosses that line.
"Bullshit," you say. "That Kennedy
idiot doesn't know what the hell he's talk
ing about." Well, it may be true that I'm
not really the best source on the logistics of
heavy drug addiction, but I don't think that
any of the other columnists (who shall
remain nameless) would provide much bet
ter insight. In fact, I don't think that most
Stanford students would even dare talk
candidly about such a subject without hav
ing a dorm program on it.
"OK, if you've ever been a junkie, cross
the line."
Why do heroin users retain a certain
glamour about themselves as opposed to
those who indulge in other hard drugs?
Most of your rock stars are junkies. Lou
Reed did heroin, made entire albums of
pure genius about it and was invited to the
White House for Clinton's inauguration.
Bowie was on smack, although the level of
talent in his recordings can be debated.
Kurt Cobain and his twitchy wife, Court
ney Love, were abusers, and the angry
teens of our nation still lick their feet, even

if one of them is six feet under. Perry Far
rel, Johnny Thunders, G.G. Allin, David
HasselhofT, Jim Morrison, the collective
members of Kiss, Rod Stewart, et cetera. I
hesitate to say Jimi Hendrix, but you never
know.
Of course, why limit ourselves to musi
cians? William Burroughs also reaped fame
and fortune by shooting up with his drug of
choice and then writing about it. Now he's
doing Nike commercials. Andy Warhol gave
everyone's genitalia a hard squeeze with
his smack-induced art. Then there's
Hunter S. Thompson, another notorious
drug user / writer who just didn't give a
fuck about anything. My God, how I
admire that.
Heroin users are often adored. It seems
that many of them end up being famous.
Or maybe it is just that famous people end
up doing heroin. In any case, you don't tend
to hear about too many rock stars doing
crack. Both crack and cocaine seem to have
stigmas attached to them. I can't exactly
think of any songs that talk about how
great it is to smoke crack. Crack is just too
scary, or at least, that is what we are told to
think.
So why heroin? Of all drugs, it has got
to be the most abhorrent in terms of get
ting it into your blood stream. The main
method of insertion is with a needle into
the arm. Just the idea itself of jamming a
hypodermic needle through your skin (not
to mention having the tourniquet fanciful
ly tied around your upper arm) and inject

ing the drug is enough to make one con
vulse.
Also, there's the ever-present dangers
connected with needles themselves. One
risks contracting diseases, such as AIDS.
Also, if a person is unskilled in administer
ing fluids from a hypodermic needle, one
air bubble could mean instant death. You
would think that everyone would stick
with much more simpler and safer meth
ods of drug use, such as smoking or pop
ping pills.
When I spent a week in Amsterdam
over winter break — another advantage of
studying overseas — I came up with a
startling theory as to why famous people
do heroin. Unfortunately, all I remember
about it is that it involved a squid-like crea
ture named Squathra, who lived at the
center of the planet. Them was the crazy
days.
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that
I don't really know why people do heroin,
or why it is often glorified in a dark way.
But again, this isn't the first time that a
Daily column has had no point.

Sean hopes you all had fun at the KA turd
party. When he graduates, he plans to
move to Amsterdam and open the James
Brouin coffee shop, where you can buy
James Brownies and listen to perpetual
funk.
