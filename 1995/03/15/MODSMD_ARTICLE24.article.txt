Author of Flicks letter should not take life too seriously

MANY A TIME during my four
and a half years here have I read
letters in this very space which
evoked within me a strong urge to
respond to the blithering moans of some
disillusioned member of our illustrious
student body. However, it was not until
I read Friday's letter from Muthu
Jeganathan that I have felt it actually
worth my while to put pen to paper in
the interest of setting the record
straight.
Let me first say that on a certain
level, I found Jeganathan's letter quite
entertaining. I am guessing that I was
not the only one for whom this letter
cor\jured up an image of a man sitting
hunched in his chair, checking his watch
every minute or so while being pelted by
a continuous barrage of paper. (Sound
familiar Muthu?) "An outrage," he

thinks as a paper airplane lodges itself
between his face and glasses. "First
thing when I get home I will write a
scathing letter to the editor. Ow, was
there a rock in that one?"
However, I believe that there is more
to it than that. As disturbing as it might
seem, I suspect that Jeganathan does
indeed represent the viewpoint of a
number of people on this campus,
indeed, in this world. To you, the stiffs
of the world, I say "Lighten up, Fran
cis." If you can't have a little fun with
yourself, what can you do? (No, "study a
lot" is not a valid answer.) Just because
you are allergic to fun doesn't mean that
you should begrudge others the opportu
nity to make light of themselves every
once in a while. And the presumption
that fun and learning are inconsistent I
find offensive, to be honest. This univer

sity is a place where one is allowed to be
ridiculous sometimes while at the same
time pursuing the loftier goals to which
you and your kind aspire.
Rather than be concerned about these
perverse practices, I suggest you take
heart in them. We are lucky that there
are places like Stanford where people
can take a couple hours out of studying
to go throw paper at a bunch of
strangers without stressing themselves
out too much. I for one am glad that
these are the people who will be making
policies for the nation instead of a bunch
of intellectuals who are out of touch
with the world and the people who live
there. Despite what you might think, we
are intelligent, able people. In fact, the
only difference between yourself and the
Flicks streakers is a layer of clothing and
an inflated sense of self importance.

Maybe you should even try it out
yourself. Who knows, maybe you'd like it
(heaven forbid). Go to a football game.
Blow off a class. Sleep naked. Don't wear
any underwear to a job interview. Try to
write your name with your pee. It might
help you to realize that life is not as seri
ous as you think and that the behavior
at Flicks is not nearly as preposterous as
the letter you wrote.
My purpose here is neither to person
ally malign Jeganathan nor is it to enter
tain and amuse the student body.
Rather, my aim is to try and convince
those of you who cringe at the thought
of acting like a child that you're not as
important as you think you are, and as
soon as you realize it, we will all be bet
ter off.
