# Hilton's column about Chiapas didn't mention America's complicity
## 
### 
Ronald Hilton's commentary entitled
the "Situation in Chiapas is much more
complicated than it appears" (March 8)
failed to say anything more substantia
te in the rest of the article. In fact, the
title left alone would probably have con
veyed more truth than the long sequence
of ill-founded and disjointed points that
followed. It was, however, sadly
anachronistic; Hilton would have per
suaded many with his albeit misleading
ideas about 10 years ago. Today there is
no evil empire, and Hilton has to appeal
to such ludicrous plots as the Cuban
involvement, Spanish resentment, Latin
American hypocrisy, Chinese secret
activities, Taiwanese courting, and final
ly the symbiotic anti-U.S. Japanese

plans to divert our attention.
Somewhere in this confusing kitchen
sink was the reference to actual plight of
indigenous people and peasants that
have exacerbated over the past decade
and half. But it was meant to be missed,
dismissed and made secondary to the
intrigues of world-historical proportions
that could have easily been extended to
the second coming. There is, in truth, a
lot under the iceberg; however, the plot
that Hilton did not mention was the
complicity of American capital in under
mining negotiations with the Zapatistas
to stall both the social uplifting of
indigenous and poor Chiapans, as well as
the democratization of the PRI-dominat
ed state apparatus.
As a recent article in The Nation well
documents, shrinking investor confi
dence resulting from poor handling of
the exchange rate crisis and the general
problems associated with poorly devel
oped yet unregulated capital markets led
American analysts working for firms
such as Citibank to call for the smashing

of the Zapatistas as a symbolic and com
pensatory legitimization of the Zedillo
government. If any plot exists, it is the
attempt to gain short term political and
financial stability based on the further
social exacerbation and derailment of
the democratization process in Mexico.
It justifies PRI dominance by portraying
the current regime as at least more
responsible than the alternatives such as
Cuauhtemoc C&rdenas who are anti-
American; and by a series of these reduc
tionist binaries, it attempts to justify
oppression.
At a time when Mexico is embroiled in
a plurality of crises, arising perhaps of
the common underlying problem of lack
of popular participation in decision mak
ing, it is tragic and academically irrespon
sible for Hilton to belittle the true dimen
sions of the problem by falsely linking
opposition leaders with foreign allies with
mythical geopolitical ambitions.
