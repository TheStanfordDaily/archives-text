# Visitor was nearly hit by bikers three times
## 
### 
I was a visitor on your campus the
weekend of Feb. 10. Truthfully, I was
very impressed with the campus itself.
It was fairly clean and pristine.
However, you have to do something
about your bicyclists. At least three
times I was nearly knocked over. I
understand that they had to get some
where, but running over someone isn't
going to speed them up. Half the time
I was jumpy, almost expecting to get
hit.
I'm not asking for personal compen
sation â€” there's no point in that.
Instead, I ask for a general compensa
tion. Post signs, start a bike patrol, do
anything. But get those cyclists to slow
down. Someone's life may be depend
ing on it.
