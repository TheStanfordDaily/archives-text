Thanks for the appreciation
As a Stanford employee, I would
like to congratulate Sudha Setty on
her well-written column from the
March 7 Daily. It's nice to see some
worker recognition from a student's
perspective.
Rad or sad?
Tuesday Thoughts is rad. Please
don't let it degenerate to printing the
kind of pap, empty, muddled argu
mentation and useless chatter like
that alternative scene article.
Give Niemeyer a gun
Bike thieves should all be shot.
A letter and a code
I wonder if speech code advocates
read Scott Kupor's letter to The
Daily — and if so, how they can pos
sibly maintain their position after
reading it. Whether they're even
capable of understanding rational
arguments is another question.
Drop the news
I think that The Daily wastes its
space on any article that has to do
with the ASSU or the Hoover Insti
tution. Nobody cares about these
issues. Also, I'd like to see more con
troversy to spark student readers'
interest.
Give the ASSU a sweep
I for one believe that the People's
Platform feel-good, big brother, tax
and-spend, ethnic centers schtick has
gotten tiresome. Let's hope that this
spring the students of Stanford will
take a mighty big broom and sweep
them all out of office.
Sibling rivalry?
Riddle me this: Is there any rela
tion between that crazy captain of
kook Sean Kennedy and that crass
conservative Betsy Kennedy?
Thumbs up for humor
Stew and Betsy's Tuesday
Thoughts were some of the funnier
things I've ever read in The Daily,
and I think the whole dialogue
should be continued with any more
responses. It's good to see The Daily
make the effort to incorporate
humor into the paper.
