## Tuition hikes: Trustees aim to strike a balance 
### 
IN DECIDING on
tuition charges,
the trustees must
balance the need to
maintain the quality
of the academic pro
gram while keeping a
Stanford education
affordable. It is an

John Freidenrich annual dilemma we
approach very seriously, and this year
was no exception.
While no one likes tuition increases,
I believe the trustees' decision to
increase tuition for 1995-96 was true
to those twin objectives of quality and
affordability. Let me identify several
issues which were important in our
deliberations and which The Daily
overlooked in its editorial on the sub
ject on Feb. 15:
• Tuition does not cover the full cost
of a Stanford education. Full tuition
covers only about 60 percent of the
cost of an undergraduate education at
Stanford. Because we do not receive a
state subsidy, the difference between
the cost of providing an education and
the price charged in the tuition is
borne by Stanford's benefactors and
by other institutional resources, such

as the endowment. So it is quite clear
that every student receives some form
of financial support from the Universi
ty.
• Stanford will maintain its finan
cial aid policy and will increase aid in
1995-96. The tuition increase will be
accompanied by increases in financial
aid. Stanford is proud to be one of the
few universities left in the country
where admission decisions are not
influenced by a student's financial cir
cumstances. And we will continue to
meet the demonstrated need of all
admitted undergraduates as long as
we can, a long held policy to which the
Board of Trustees is deeply commit
ted.
• Students are involved in the
tuition decision with the Board of
Trustees. The Daily asserts in its edi
torial that students are not involved in
Board discussions of tuition. This is
simply inaccurate.
There are full voting members of
the Finance Committee and the Aca
demic Policy, Planning and Manage
ment Committee, the two committees
of the Board of Trustees where the
tuition recommendation was discussed
extensively. Those members were pre-

sent at the meeting.
• A tuition increase is criti
cal to the effort to maintain
Stanford's quality. The prin
cipal reason for increasing
tuition is to maintain — and
selectively improve upon —
the quality of the University.
This means that we must be
able to attract and retain the
best faculty in the world and
to support them and our stu
dents in a cost effective man
ner.
The costs of a high-quality
university are largely com
prised of salaries and bene
fits, and historically such
costs tend to rise somewhat
faster than inflation. We will,
however, continue to search
for ways to reduce our cost
structure without sacrificing

academic quality. Over the last several
years, approximately $50 million in
costs have been eliminated, principally
in administrative areas.
The trustees will continue to be vig
ilant in our responsibilities: to protect
the quality of a Stanford education, to
stress the need for cost-effective ways

to improve on the delivery of that edu
cation and to be certain that financial
considerations will not affect our abil
ity to enroll and retain the best stu
dents in the country.
