# Visitor plunges from Roble banister
## Man injured after falling four floors 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
In an incident that raised fur
ther questions about the effective
ness of the University's alcohol
policy, a 19-year-old Petaluma
man attending a Roble Hall party
last Saturday night suffered seri
ous injuries in a four-story fall
Stanford police believe was pre
cipitated by alcohol use.
The man, who is not a Stanford
student, survived the fall from
Roble's third floor stairwell to its
basement and is currently listed
in stable condition at Stanford
Hospital.

The man — described as white,
6 feet 2 inches tall and weighing
approximately 270 pounds — sus
tained a head laceration, a possi
ble concussion and one broken
vertebra, said Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"He's very lucky he wasn't
killed," Niemeyer said.
The man attended a party in
Roble's B-Wing with a Stanford
friend after Saturday's men's bas
ketball game against the Univer
sity of Washington.
Around 11:30 p.m. that night,
the man sat on the wooden banis
ter of the third-floor stairwell,
preparing to slide down, Niemey
er said.
He lost control and fell over
the side of the banister, bumping
into the walls on his way down
and ultimately landing in the
basement.
The man admitted to drinking
one to two beers that night, but
Stanford Police believe he con
sumed more than that amount,
Niemeyer said.
"The moral to this story is: if
you are under 21, you should not
be drinking," Niemeyer said.
'And you shouldn't be sliding
down banisters either."
The University's formal alco
hol policy, revised in October
1990, strictly prohibits underage
Irinking, including serving alco
hol to minors at campus parties.
I he change was made in response
to a 1990 federal law that threat
ened to cut federal funding to
post-secondary institutions that
failed to institute anti-alcohol

rules for underage drinkers.
Instead of having residential
advisers actively monitor alcohol
consumption, though, the Uni
versity has generally opted for a
"safety net" approach in which
resident fellows and resident
assistants are encouraged to
counsel and educate about alcohol
consumption, rather than strictly
prohibit students from drinking.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said yesterday that the
University may revisit its alcohol
policy, and that an administrator
is currently "looking into" Satur
day night's incident, though the
man is not a Stanford student.
Lisa Webb, Roble's residence
dean, is currently investigating
"what happened at that specific
party and what role alcohol had,"
said Jackson. Webb did not
return phone calls yesterday.
The Roble RFs and RAs held a
house meeting following Saturday
night's incident, Jackson said.
Senior David Cohen, a Roble
resident, said the meeting pri
marily covered students' feelings
about the incident. "We talked
about what happened and peo
ple's reactions to it,"he said.
