# Students should be more active in tuition debate

Decreases in
federal research
funding and
damages from the 1991
earthquake have com
pounded the fiscal
problems currently
confronting Stanford.
In response to these

Rachel Hall growing financial
needs, the Board of Trustees has, with
the endorsement of the current Council
of Presidents, recently proposed a 5.5
percent increase in student fees for the
1995-96 academic year. This accretion
rate exceeds the current Consumer
Price Index of approximately 3.5 per
cent by 2 points.
COP members have celebrated this
agreement as a means of containing
increases in student costs within specif
ically defined parameters. The unfortu
nate reality, however, is that the pro
posal is not in the best interest of the
student body. Specifically, there are
three fundamental flaws with the COP
sponsored plan: uncontrollable future
tuition increases, lack of effective stu
dent input and limited financial aid con
siderations.
While 5.5 percent may appear to be a

manageable cost increase upon initial
consideration, this policy would, in fact,
double Stanford tuition every 12 years.
By endorsing this proposal, the COP
has encouraged the institution of a sys
tematic fee increase that is no longer
subject to annual reassessment and
adjustment based on fluctuating fiscal
circumstances.
These far-reaching ramifications are
more troublesome in light of the fact
that this initiative was endorsed by the
COP prior to the solicitation of student
input. As representatives of the Stan
ford student body, the COP had the
responsibility of seeking student
involvement in this issue and soliciting
student input during the development
of this proposal.
Furthermore, this agreement
neglects to consider the needs of stu
dent financial aid recipients and job
holders. Fee increases that supersede
inflation weaken the value of dollars
earned by students who maintain part
time or full-time jobs to finance educa
tional expenses. Therefore, increases
exceeding this rate must be accommo
dated by additional work hours. This is
not a feasible option for many students
who already juggle heavy work sched

ules with full-time academic course
loads.
Financial aid resources are similarly
insufficient to offset rising tuition costs.
Any possibility of compensatory aid
increases will be eliminated by the
upcoming implementation of a new
statewide financial aid review board.
The federal government has mandated
the establishment of such review boards
in each state. The California version of
this body is slated to be administered
through the California Post-Secondary
Education Commission. This commis
sion has gone on record publicly stating
that proposals for increasing direct stu
dent aid expenditures will be shelved
until the state review board has been
fully implemented. When this will hap
pen is anyone's guess. Given these cir
cumstances, increases in student aid are
unlikely to be considered in the foresee
able future. The approximately 65 per
cent of Stanford students receiving
financial aid can anticipate aid short
falls rather than compensatory funding
should the COP-supported plan be
implemented.
Funds derived from student tuition
comprise only one-fourth of Stanford's
total operating budget. As such, the lim

ited benefit derived by the University
from these fee increases is outweighed
by the disproportionately negative
impact they have on students.
While Stanford's financial shortfalls
clearly must be financed in order to
maintain University operations, tuition
increases in excess of the current infla
tion rate are not a philosophically rea
sonable or fiscally sound option. This
proposal compromises accountability to
students by placing upon them a dispro
portionate financial burden.
That the University is implementing
long-term plans to increase the number
of alumni donors indicates that tuition
hikes are not the only available option.
Indeed, it appears that the COP
assumed the inevitability of student fee
increases prior to thoroughly evaluating
alternative options. While a tuition
increase equal to the current inflation
rate could arguably be an institutional
necessity in the short-term, continual
fee hikes exceeding that level can hard
ly be considered a victory.
Let's be candid. Students deserve
better.
