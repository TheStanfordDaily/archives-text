## Oxford 's intellectual stagnancy and pedagogic traditions 
### 
OXFORD, ENGLAND
THERE IS something about this
place that is incredibly depress
ing," an old acquaintance said to
me as we ate breakfast one dreary, wet
morning in the Magdelen College dining
hall, an expansive and dim cavern of
dark, aged wood. As a Rhodes Scholar, he
is completing his second stint at Oxford,
having spent two terms here while a
Stanford undergraduate. Although he
has another year left before he earns his
doctorate, my friend won't be back next
fall, and the reason is simple: He is fed up
with Oxford.
What has caused his disaffection?
Homesickness? English cuisine? Rain?
Separate hot and cold water taps? All
plausible if peripheral explanations, but
his criticisms of the university strike
much deeper. At Oxford, he has found
inaccessible and inattentive supervisors,

Byzantine bureaucracies and nauseating
formality, limited research facilities and
virtually no classroom bonhomie. One
final charge seemed to me the most
damning — the weakness, or even lack,
of Oxford's "intellectual environment."
No intellectual environment? At
Oxford, the place that produced Locke
and Auden and most of the Clinton
administration? It's like saying not
enough frisbee is played at Stanford. But
my friend's opinions are shared by sever
al, if not most, of the foreign students I
have talked to here. Many came with the
typical Oxford mythologies in tow,
images of urbane students and profes
sors strolling about in flowing robes,
relentlessly pondering the world's
weightiest matters. What they, and I,
have realized, though, is that the myth of
Oxford is just that. Sure, you see a lot of
robes, but underneath, the professors
have no clothes.

A disclaimer is necessary — I have
spent but six months at a university that
has been around for nearly a millennium.
And this is by no means an attack on
Oxford's students. Nearly all the stu
dents I met were eminently likable, intel
ligent, articulate and generous, with
broad and ranging interests, well-devel
oped even before they arrived here.
No, the problem isn't the students; it's
what Oxford does — or does not do — to
them. One oddity is that the university's
undergraduates actually spend the
majority of the year away, with eight
week terms followed by six-week holi
days. Other pedagogic traditions remain,
despite their obvious limits. Undergradu
ates' course schedules are made up solely
by classes related to their majors, which
they declare when they apply to Oxford.
And all those classes, for the duration of
the undergraduate degree, take the form
of the vaunted tutorial — an individual

tete-a-tete with a professor.
There are arguments to be made for
all of the above educational methods, the
most common and cloying being that
they represent the "Oxford way." But
this system seems to choke off, rather
than broaden, students' horizons. A biol
ogy student won't study Hegel here, and
a literature major won't take statistics.
Nor will they benefit from the dynamics
of classroom discussion with their peers,
since the only kind of learning the tutori
al system allows for is that which is dis
pensed by the tutor (and the books he
prescribes). The result is a kind of stag
nancy, nay, complacency among stu
dents. It is not uncommon for students
to freely plagiarize each other's weekly
tutorial papers. And one rarely hears any
real excitement from Oxfordians about
their studies — no burning desire to, say,
design a major or write a thesis or do
research in Madagascar. The main topic

of dinner conversation still tends to be
who shagged whom at the "bop" Friday
night.
Of course, the reasons for such smug
ness are manifold. These students go to
Oxford, and in Britain, that name still
opens more doors than a freshman on a
first date. Fittingly, the major gown-and
champagne ceremony for undergradu
ates is not graduation but matriculation,
which happens during their first week at
Oxford. "You're in, lad," the old
poohbahs must say, "now relax." Why
shouldn't they? The Oxbridge Conspira
cy, as a recently published critique
dubbed it, still carries the day. Oxford
and Cambridge alumni dominate every

important political, intellectual,
professional and cultural post in
Britain, from Westminster to
Barclay's to Hugh Grant.
None of this would matter
much if the only vestiges of
Oxford elitism and pomposity
were the Latin prayers before
dinner and students wearing
tuxedos to take exams. But they
aren't. The student body remains
strikingly white, and the faculty
even more so, with most colleges'
high tables looking as diverse as
an Oklahoma trailer park.
Women are similarly unrepre

sented, not just at high table but
at all-male student drinking soci
eties, and, most embarrassing to
Oxbridge, at the Oxford and
Cambridge Club. It does not seem
surprising that in a recent sur
vey, 16 percent of Oxford men
earned first-class degrees, com
pared to 9.1 percent of the
women.
Will such "traditions" contin
ue? For Oxford's sake, hopefully
not. As it is, several colleges are
teetering on the brink of fiscal
collapse. And how long can the
university's library, the
Bodleain, continue not to let a
single book out of its buildings
before some unstable graduate
student torches the place? In a
recent, excoriating memoir of

Oxford, Rosa Ehrenreich, an
American Marshall Scholar,
wrote that "you can only get by
for so long on tradition and a pile
of nice, old buildings. Sooner or
later more is required: compas
sion, imagination, energy."
Those are the things that Oxford
and its students seem to have
lost — a sense of possibility,
innovation and insight beyond
what color bow tie to wear to the
next drinks party.
The world has caught up with
Oxford, and that's a good thing.
One hopes Oxford can now rein
vent itself and keep pace, for this
week's spring thaw serves
reminder of how glorious the
place can be. (Two rays of light:
Oxford officials recently voted to

abolish the university's entrance
examination, claiming it was
biased toward "public" — mean
ing, in Britspeak, private —
school students, and have formed
a CUE-esque "Commission of
Inquiry" into the future of the
university.)
Many years ago, Shakespeare
called Oxford "so famous, so
excellent in art, and still so ris
ing." Even today, few would
argue with the veracity of the
first two qualities. It is the last
one that Oxford should be worry
ing about.

Romesh Ratnesar thanks the stu
dents at 65 High Street for their
insights. He is returning to Stan
ford spring quarter.
