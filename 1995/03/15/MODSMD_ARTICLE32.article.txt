## Belching fire The 						Bug probes the depths of flaming bodily functions 
### Cris Niell Staff writer 
Q: "Is there anything I can eat or drink thai
would make my burps flammable?"
— spitting fire
A:This is one of the most creative ideas I have
heard in my four years here at Stanford. Stop
all the cancer research, no need for AIDS
funding — whoever solves this problem will win the
Nobel Prize for Cool. The ultimate party trick.
Unfortunately, the research effort in this area is
lacking. However, I'll review the current knowledge
to start you on your quest for the pyrotechnic eruc
tation. (Eructation is the word you use for burps if
you need the people at the Stanford Medical Center
to take you seriously.)
The problem is challenging. You see, unless you
have a serious gastro-intestinal disorder, the air that
you belch is pretty much just air that you have
somehow swallowed. The air goes down into the
stomach and a little while later gets pushed back up
the way it came.
There are several ways you can get air into your
stomach. The most common is just accidentally

swallowing air with your food as you eat. Known as
aerophagia, this is a particular problem for people
who talk while they eat.
As anyone who went to elementary school knows,
you can also force air down into your stomach by
swallowing with nothing in your mouth. This is the
technique generally accepted among adolescents for
creating fake burps.
Here arises one possible technique for incendiary
belches. If you stuck your mouth on one of those gas
jets in the chemistry lab, and forced the air into your
stomach in the fake burp manner, you might be able
to ignite the resultant belch. However, this seems to
be a rather hazardous method, like sucking on a
car's exhaust pipe.
Carbonated beverages are another way of getting
gases into your stomach. Coke and other such bev
erages contain carbon dioxide, dissolved in the
drink. When you open up the can, the carbon dioxide
begins expanding into a gas. As this process contin
ues in your stomach, gas builds up until it erupts
into a belch.
There are also medical conditions that cause
excessive belching. Ulcers and other digestive prob
lems can seriously disrupt your plumbing to the
point that gas that should be coming out the other
end comes out your mouth.
Lactose intolerance can also be responsible for
excessive belching. For people who do not posses the
enzyme to break down the sugar in milk (about 80%
of the world's population), the sugars pass through
undigested. They eventually get broken down by
bacteria in the gut and the gas that is produced can
come out as a belch.
There is also the distant possibility that you could
come up with a substance that is broken down by
some enzyme in the stomach to produce a
flammable gas. As long as this was broken down
soon enough in the digestive tract, it could come out
as a belch. Alas, this seems a very unlikely possibili
ty.
This leads us on to the obvious next question ...
are farts really flammable? Everyone has heard the
jokes, but I personally have never witnessed the infa
mous blue flames.
So I ended up talking with Dr. Michael Levitt in
Minneapolis, known as the world's expert on flatu
lence. Indeed, he confirmed the flammability of
farts. Any food that does not get fully digested —
such as complex carbohydrates and fiber — passes
into the intestines and colon, where the microbial
denizens go to work breaking it down.
These bacteria produce a variety of gases as
breakdown products. Among these are the odorless
Cs hydrogen and methane, both of which are
mable. However, hydrogen is actually the pri
mary culprit in rectal fireworks, since it is much
more flammable and is produced in higher amounts.
Although this flammability is not too dangerous
on an everyday basis (even if you're purposely ignit
ing your flatus, there isn't much danger of the
flames running up your insides), it can be a problem
during colon surgery. Levitt mentioned several cases
where people's colons exploded when a spark was
brought too close.
But the amount of various gases you create varies
from person to person. Methane production, for
example, varies by up to a million-fold, so not every
body has flammable farts.
Furthermore, the ability to light your farts runs
in families, since this depends on populations of var
ious bacteria in your gut, and most of these bacteria
are transmitted in the womb.
While on this fiery topic, Levitt suggested his own
possibility for the flammable burp. If you could
domesticate these hydrogen or methane-producing
bacteria to live in the stomach, rather than in the
intestines, then the incendiary gases they create
could come out as a belch. This phenomenon actual
ly produces flammable burps for cows, who hold
food in their stomach for digestion. However, it's a
long shot for humans, since most bacteria couldn't
survive the acidity of the stomach. Plus the whole
process of cultivating bacteria in your stomach isn't
too safe.
So, while I can't offer any quick and easy way for
you to breathe fire, I hope you will be content
knowing that the body still can produce its own
fireworks.
