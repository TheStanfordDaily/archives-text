# 'SCID' mice help shed light on DNA repair
## Research pinpoints severe combined immunodeficiency gene, could affect cancer treatment

Using sick mice as model carriers of a human
gene that causes rare immune diseases, scientists
at Stanford Medical Center have found the gene
responsible for severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID).
Cordula Kirchgessner, a postdoctoral research
associate who worked on the project for two years,
said the identification of the gene is important
because it may shed light on the DNA repair mech
anism for double-strand breaks. It will also affect
how cancer patients receive treatment.
DNA double-strand breaks, one of the highest
forms of genomic instability, can be repaired in
mammalian cells by a certain pathway. Inherent in
this pathway is the primary function of processing
the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes
from gene segments by recombination of DNA.
However, "SCID mice" contain a deficiency in
this pathway. Due to this abnormality, the mice
lack both Band T-cell immunity and are sensitive
to ionizing radiation.
Four years ago, research showed that mice
inflicted with SCID are defective in making
immune cells. SCID also impairs the mice's ability
to repair DNA damage caused by radiation.
"We have known for a long time that these mice
are very radio-sensitive. They are very inefficient
in repairing DNA breaks," Kirchgessner said.

These DNA repair proteins are vital because they
enable cells to be immune from radiation levels.
This lack of Band T-cell immunity can lead to
a variety of disorders which the body will not be
able to fight off, including the mechanism to make
immune cells or repair damage to DNA.
Many researchers have attempted to clone the
human gene that can complement SCID, but
Kirchgessner and her colleagues chose a different
procedure to isolate the gene. "So many labs have
intensely tried to clone this gene and failed," she
said.
The procedure to test for the gene used cell lin
ing from the SCID mice. The researchers created
hybrid offspring of the SCID cell lining by using
the human chromosome 8. Cell lining was taken
out of the mouse, injected with human chromo
somes and placed in a petri dish, a procedure which
made testing easy because "it allowed us to have a
phenotype in a dish," Kirchgessner said.
Using this cell lining, the researchers began
their search for the region on the human chromo
some that contained the desired protein.
Researchers zeroed in on human chromosome 8
because it was the only chromosome that con
tained the gene fragment which complemented the
SCID defect.
After identifying the human chromosome with
the deficiency gene, scientists at Stanford begin
searching for the specific region on the chromo

some that contains SCID. They mapped SCID to
the long arm of chromosome 8, called p350. To
reinforce this find, Kirchgessner and colleagues
tried to test for the expression of human p350 in
SCID cells. The expression of p350 was only found
in two independent SCID cell lines carrying
human chromosome 8.
This location on p350 will affect the way cancer
patients receive treatment. By identifying the gene
that is defective in SCID carriers, doctors can then
search for the gene in patients to see which tumors
could respond to radiation therapy.
If the cancer has a SCID mutation, radiation
therapy would be more effective because it could be
killed easily by the radiation — a fact that is
proven by the data showing that mice with the
SCID defect are not immune to radiation. Cancer
cells with the normal gene — which lacks the SCID
mutation — would not be likely candidates for
radiation because the tumor would be resistant,
Kirchgessner said.
The research work still has not come to an end.
The team will now focus on researching the other
functions of p350, which Kirchgessner said is "a
very big region with many base pairs."
Researchers will also focus on gaining more
information about the process of DNA double
strand break repair. Expressing some frustration,
Kirchgessner noted that information in this area is
still lacking.
