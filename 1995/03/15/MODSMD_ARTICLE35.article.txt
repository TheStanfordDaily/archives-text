# Girard, creator of the theory of 'mimetic desire,' retires

### Michael Nichols Tyler Graham 
Renowned theorist Ren6
Girard, professor of French and
Italian and comparative litera
ture, retired on Monday after
teaching his final class, on "Myth
and The Bible."
Known primarily for his theo
ry of "mimetic desire," Girard is
also a prominent literary critic, a
pioneer of "interdividual psychol
ogy" and a radical theologian.
"Professor Girard's presence
on this campus is one that I can
not overemphasize," said French
and Italian Prof. Emeritus John
Freccero, who has worked with
Girard since 1956. "It is ironic
that Stanford University is
known throughout Italy, France
and the whole of Europe as the
University of Rene Girard, even
when his area of study is not what
the University considers most
central."
At Stanford, as in the interna
tional scene, Girard has a large
following. The Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Con
trol holds bi-weekly conferences
with Girard, and next year Stan
ford will host a grand colloquium
on him. There is also a rotating
annual Girardian meeting,
COVAR (Colloquium on Religion
and Violence).
Girard's theory focuses on
mimetic — or imitative — desire,
a concept he maintains is funda
mental to human behavior and
society.
"I may have been the first to
name 'mimetic desire,' but it has
been there for a long time," he
said. "The entire mimetic theory
is best illustrated in the Gospels.
They not only reveal the system,
but also show how it can be
stopped."
Girard is reluctant to take
credit for his own discoveries.
With a smile he asserts, "Just
read Shakespeare. It's all there.
He understood it better than any
one else. For example, he is
speaking of mimetic desire when
he says: 'love by another's eye,'
'love that stood upon the choice of
friends,' 'love by hearsay.' You
see what I mean?"
Many faculty members agree
that Girardian theory has been
very influential in the academic
circles.
"Ren6 Girard has made a real
difference in how people read lit
erature," said English Prof. Mar
jorie Perloff. "He has formulated
theses that have now become part
of everyone's critical vocabulary."

French and Italian Prof. Jean-
Pierre Dupuy, director of CREA,
a philosophical research center in
Paris, said that Girard's work is
far-reaching.
"Girard's influence is vast —
vast," said Dupuy, who will teach
a course on Girardian theory next
year entitled "Violence and the
Sacred."
"What people fail to realize is
that Girard has had an incredible
influence on fields outside of liter
ature, such as economics, psy
chology, philosophy and sociolo
gy," Dupuy said.
Aside from the world-wide fol
lowing of Girardians, local stu
dents said Girard is a teacher few
can forget.
Senior Josh Correll, who took
Girard's Shakespeare class four
years ago, still remembers: "I
didn't miss a single lecture. He
would have so much fun with
'Midsummer' and 'Troilus.'...
That man taught me more about
love and the psychology of human
relationships than any psych
class ever did."
Matt Kratter, a UC-Berkeley
graduate student in English who
had Girard as an undergraduate
at Stanford, recently has been
commuting to attend Girard's
classes.
"There is so much nonsense
out there in the humanities that
it is refreshing to hear a true
scholar and thinker," Kratter
said. "You understand what true
brilliance is when you see and
hear Girard. There is a big differ
ence between him and most other
professors."
Slavic languages and litera
tures doctoral student Andrey
Ustinov remarked, "Girard does
not cater to contemporary fads (in
literary theory).. . . His ideas are
an entire school of thought unto
themselves."
Born on Christmas Day, 1923
in Avignon, France, Girard origi
nally trained as a medievalist at
the Ecole des Chartes. He came to
America in 1947 and received his
second doctorate in history from
Indiana University. He taught at
Duke University, Bryn Mawr Col
lege, the State University of New
York at Buffalo and Johns Hop
kins before coming to Stanford in
1981.
Girard's academic honors
include being a two-time Guggen
heim Fellow (in 1960 and 1967)
and winning the Academie
Frangaise award for his 1973
book "Violence and the Sacred."
He is also a member of the French
Legion of Honor (1984).

Girard is the author of twelve
books, with translations in fifteen
languages. "Violence and the
Sacred" was his first world-wide
success and created a great con
troversy in the academic milieu: it
reinterpreted and criticized
accepted anthropology, psycholo
gy and structuralism.
More controversial was
"Things Hidden Since the Foun
dation of the World" (1978). In
this crucial book, Girard and two
prominent psychiatrists mapped
out the concept of "interdividual
psychology," with all the func
tions, properties and laws of
mimetic desire. The book created
further havoc by offering a non
sacrificial reading of the Judeo-

Christian Scriptures. Girard faces
the difficult challenge of being an
intellectual who not only believes
in science but also believes in God
and proposes theological insights.
Among his other important
books are: "Deceit, Desire, and
the Novel," "Shakespeare, A The
atre of Envy," "The Scapegoat"
and "Job, the Victim of his Peo
ple."
Many people expressed how
Girard will be missed and feel he
will come back. Ralph Hester,
chair of French and Italian,
remarked, "Although Ren6
Girard may not teach on a regular
basis, I think that he will no more
retire than one can retire his
scholarship and ideas."
