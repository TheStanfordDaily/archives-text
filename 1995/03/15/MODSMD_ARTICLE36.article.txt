# Girardian Theory for beginners

### 
What is Girardian Theory
and its "mimetic desire?" Juet
as E—mc s is an elementary
equation demanding extensive
explanation, "mimetic desire"
is a simple principle capable of
generating complexity. Here is
a quick glance at Girardian
Theory.
"Mimetic theory" starts with
desire. Rather than see desire
as linear, this system views its
path as triangular due to
desire's mimetic (imitative)
nature: a subject desires X
because he sees that his model
desires X. This want can be
anything concrete or metaphys
ical — such as an object, a per
son or prestige, A concrete
example can be seen with fads:
Jane wears bell-bottom pants.
Sally admires (or envies) Jane
and imitates her desires. The
next day she buys a pair.
Triangular desire contains
the possibility of a rapid — and
usually horrific — oscillation
which brings about a "mimetic
rivalry. 0 A simple example is
the "Keeping up with the Jone
ses" phenomenon. Here, the
more the neighbor desires and
acquires, the more you desire
and acquire.
This rivalry is often negative
and usually leads to what
Girard calls "vicious or mon
strous doubles," depression,
psychosis or a "horrid circle of
envy." The most extreme form
of the mimetic crisis is known
as the "crisis of undifferentia
tion" or "sacrificial crisis."
In this case, mimetic desire
has spread and infected an
entire community so that all
forms of "degree" (social dis
tinctions) have broken down.
When degree is eliminated the
crisis of undifferentiation set
tles in. The trait of such crises
is violent disorder and chaos,
which can only be appeased by
sacrifice. Hence the term "sac
rificial crisis."
At the height of this crisis,
all the hatred converges on a
single member of the communi
ty, the culprit or victim. The
victim, in reality, is no more
responsible than anyone else
for the crisis. He must, howev
er, be blamed as its sole cause.
The community unites, labels
him as the culprit and sacrifices

him. According to Girard, "this
occurs fully in archaic societies
which have sacrifices, but only
remnants exist in our society."
When the sacrifice has taken
place, the community's violence
is appeased, order is re-estab
lished and life progresses nor
mally until the next crisis. The
short story "The Lottery" illus
trates this poignantly: Once a
year all villagers gather to play
the lottery. The winner of the
lottery is then surrounded by
everyone else and stoned. This
"victimage mechanism" is also
known a3 "scapegoating" the
innocent culprit.
Girard points out that the
scapegoating mechanism is
generative — it is a fundamen
tal principle of our civilization
which has existed since the
foundation of the world, since
Cain murdered Abel. Like an
ocean's waves, scapegoating
appears and recedes, pushing
civilization forward.
Girard's three pillars of cul
ture come with order restored
after a sacrifice: Myth (the
story of the victim as both pure
ly evil — by causing chaos —
and good, by bringing peace),
Ritual (symbolic re-enactment
of the victim's actions in order
to recreate peace) and Prohibi
tion (forbidding the mimetic
actions that led to the crisis).
This mechanism is fully illus
trated by the Judeo-Christian
Scriptures.
The Bible illustrates how the
scapegoat is innocent. Myth, on
the other hand, always main
tains that the victim is guilty in
order to sacrifice him. Beyond
this revelation of arbitrary
selection versus innocence, the
Bible offers a cure to the
mimetic system.
First, Girard says, Christ's
crucifixion on the cross was an
act to end all sacrifices and
scapegoating by revealing their
mechanisms. Furthermore,
Girard maintains, following
Christ and the rules of the
Kingdom of God will avert the
mimetic crisis. For example,
commandments such as "turn
notions of revenge and contin
ued rivalry.
