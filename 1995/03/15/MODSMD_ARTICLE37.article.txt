# Task Force to complete sexual assualt policy by spring quarter's end
## Change in federal legislation neccesitates more specific policy, including reporting procedures and rape-awareness education 
### Neha Gupta Contributing writer 
Slated to be completed by the end of
next quarter, the University's sexual
assault policy is being updated — mainly
to detail and clarify the reporting and
information process — by the Sexual
Assault Task Force to comply with new
federal legislation.
The task force was commissioned by
Vice Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds last summer and
has been working on the policy since the
beginning of this school year, according
to Ira Friedman, director of health ser
vices at Cowell Student Health Center.
The need for the policy change stems
from the Ramstad Amendment, passed
by the 102 nd U.S. Congress, which
places stricter regulations on what uni

versity sexual assault policies should
encompass.
It mandates that these policies should
detail specifics such as the exact proce
dures to follow once a sex offense has
occurred, the types of reporting proce
dures and rape-awareness education pro
grams to be established, the rights of the
accuser and the accused and the extent of
counseling services available around
campus.
One problem with the University's
current system is that it is very decen
tralized, with several sources around
campus to whom a sexual-assault sur
vivor could turn, Friedman said. Task
force members are debating whether or
not to centralize the system by having
just one authoritative source on campus
to deal with the issue.
"The problem with this is that it

assumes that everyone will know about
this central place and bring their con
cerns there," Friedman said. "Also, what
happens when, because of a previous
experience, someone does not like the
central organization or person?"
Friedman said he did not expect signif
icant revisions to the current policy.
Rather, he said, it will become more spe
cific, explicitly detailing procedures and
resources.
The goal, he said, is to create a fairly
brief and succinct policy and then sup
plement the policy with a user guide to
answer students' questions. He said the
user guide will also make the procedure
smoother and less variable, so that stu
dents will know exactly what to expect.
"If I had three words to advise some
one, it would be 'Get information
early,' " said Friedman. "Find out what

your options are regarding counseling,
reporting and prosecuting ... on how to
make your life normal again," added
Friedman.
The final policy, he said, should be
more useful to students, faculty and
staff, because it will make survivors more
aware of the options available.
"We are going above and beyond the
legal mandate," said Felicia Lee, coordi
nator of the Women's Center.
The task force, which includes the
associate dean of Memorial Church and a
representative from the student-run
Coalition Against Sexual Assault, is also
trying to get student input on the
changes.
A general questionnaire will be dis
tributed to the entire student body
through e-mail, Lee said, while specific
questionnaires will be distributed to tar

get groups such as the Women's Center,
ethnic centers, athletes and the Greek
system.
"We want to find out what informa
tion students would find most useful and
if the University is doing enough to get
the information out there," Lee said.
The task force will also have two to
three open forum meetings, to which spe
cific target groups will also be invited, she
said.
Although the Ramstad Amendment
was passed a few years ago, the Depart
ment of Education did not publish its
final regulations until last summer after
an extensive period of evaluating how to
implement regulations with considera
tion to public comments.
The last time the sexual assault policy
was examined was in March 1994, when
some minor revisions were made.
