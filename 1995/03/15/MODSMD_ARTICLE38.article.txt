## Bldg. 70 occupants vacate for earthquake repairs 
### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
Professors with offices in Building 70 are busy
packing, but not for spring break vacations.
Instead, they are moving — professionally speak
ing. All the inhabitants of Building 70 must be com
pletely moved out by March 25 in preparation for
earthquake damage repairs.
In addition to individual professors, American
Studies, Humanities Special Programs and Modern
Thought and Literature will relocate to Encina Hall.
Monica Moore, programs administrator for the
three academic disciplines, said that returning to a
renovated building will be worth the hassle of mov
ing out. "They are making some improvements
which I'm excited about," she said.
Gabrielle Lee, assistant project manager, said the
repairs will be extensive and take about nine
months.
"We will be putting in a new steel reinforced
structure, a new fire alarm and sprinkler system,
replacing the heating system and installation, and
putting in handicap-accessible bathrooms on the
first floor," she said.

Moore added that the aesthetic changes will also
be appreciated. "The building hasn't been redone
since the 19505," she said. "It needs a new decorat
ing motif."
However, Moore expressed her concern over
being relocated to Encina Hall, even temporarily.
"I'm not too happy about it. Obviously moving is not
fun. Encina Hall is not the center of the campus,"
she said.
She said she fears Encina Hall will be out of the
way for students who want to find out more about
American Studies, Humanities Special Programs or
Modern Thought and Literature. "We will have to
make ourselves a little more visible," she said.
However, English Prof. Regenia Gagnier, who
has an office in Building 70, did not express concern
over the move. "I don't mind. I've got another office
in the English Department where I'm comfortable.
And the movers are being helpful," she said.
Building 70 is one of many academic centers
scheduled to undergo earthquake repair. The Lan
guage and Geology Corners of the Quad are current
ly under repair. In the future, repairs and upgrades
will be made on Buildings 10, 20, 90, 100 and 110,
Lee said.
