# Car burglars increase activity
## Police warn owners to protect stereos, personal property 
### September Trevi√±o Staff writer 
Car owners parking on cam
pus may need to take extra pre
cautions to safeguard their vehi
cles against break-ins. According
to Stanford Police reports, the
number of car burglaries has
gone up significantly during the
past three weeks.
Since Feb. 22, Stanford Police
have recorded nearly 20 car bur

glaries in which car stereos and
personal property have been
stolen, said Stanford Police Sgt.
John McMullen.
"We're really getting ham
mered," said Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer. "We usu
ally don't have this many bur
glaries" within such a short time
period.
Both Niemeyer and McMullen
agreed, however, that the cam
pus occasionally sees a dramatic

increase in the number of car
burglaries. "This happened sev
eral years ago and we got abso
lutely peppered," Niemeyer said.
According to McMullen, cer
tain vehicle owners are especially
at risk of having their cars bur
glarized. He suggested that jog
gers who drive to the Foothills to
run and owners of foreign
imports should take extra pre-
cautions to protect their vehicles
against break-ins.
"There are higher incidences
along jogging trails," McMullen
said. People who jog in the
Foothills often leave their cars
along the roadside, making them
prime candidates for break-ins.
Typical problem areas are
those streets that join Junipero
Serra Boulevard, such as Campus
Drive, Frenchman's Road and
Stanford Avenue, Niemeyer

added.
According to McMullen, the
old trick of hiding personal
belongings like wallets and purs
es under seats simply won't fool
professional burglars. "Covering
up things with a blanket doesn't
work either," he said. "These
guys know what you're up to, so
lock things up in the trunk."
Owners of Japanese and Ger
man cars should also take pre
cautions, McMullen said. Bur
glars stealing car stereos tend to
target these imports, especially
Hondas and Volkswagens.
Most burglars enter the vehi
cles via smashed windows, while

others use what police call the
"door punch" method, which
entails breaking the door lock
and simply pulling the door open.
The method of entry is cru
cial, McMullen said. "We can
catch burglars based upon how
they break in the cars." he said.
Police can often link a certain
suspect to other crimes in which
break-in patterns are similar.
To deal with the recent break
ins, Stanford police officers are
stepping up patrolling efforts,
said Niemeyer. Patrol units will
concentrate on targeted areas to
hopefully catch the thieves and
serve as a deterrent force.
