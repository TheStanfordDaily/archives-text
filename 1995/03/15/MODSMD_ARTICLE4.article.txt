# Six professors honored
## Engineers elected to National Academy 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Honored with the most respect
ed professional membership in
their field, six Stanford professors
have been elected members of the
National Academy of Engineering
— a group that includes Stan
ford's first female member.
Electrical Engineering and Sta
tistics Prof. Thomas Cover, Me
chanical Engineering Prof.
Thomas Hughes, Industrial Engi
neering Prof. Elisabeth Pat6-Cor
nell, Mechanical Engineering
Prof. Charles Steele, Aeronautics

and Astronautics Prof. Stephen
Tsai and Electrical Engineering
Prof. Bernard Widrow were all se
lected for membership last month.
Out of the 77 members elected
this year, more new members
were chosen from Stanford than
from any other institution. Stan
ford now has 73 of the academy's
1,790 total members.
A record number of women
were also elected this year — with
Pat6-Cornell as one of five chosen.
Total female membership in the
academy is now 34.
Pat6-Cornell studies how peo
ple affect the performance and
physics of systems in environ
ments and has focused on vari
ous subjects, from the space
shuttle to offshore oil platforms
and operating rooms.
In her study of the space
shuttle, she found out which
ceramic tiles were critical to
maintaining the shuttle's heat
shield and made recommenda
tions to reduce the risk of acci
dents.
Pat6-Cornell's recent study of
anesthesiologists led her to
make a series of recommenda
tions as to how they could
improve their performance.
Cover, however, has focused
his research on the areas of
information theory, pattern
recognition and complexity. He
is also the director of the Infor
mation Systems Laboratory.
His recent research has
focused on data-compression
techniques that can be applied to
predict the next-day prices of
stocks.
"I was surprised to be elect
ed," Cover said. "I just put one
foot in front of the other . . . you
don't have a clue that they are
considering you."
Election to the academy is
"the ultimate honor in engineer
ing," Cover added.
"It's a big honor. I'm elated,"
said Hughes, whose work is
focused on theories which have
helped to increase the power of
computer simulations — making
it easier for scientists to do tests
on computers, rather than with
physical models.
Hughes said he thought it
would be "useful to get some
younger blood in the academy or
set up some mechanism so that
those voices are heard.
"It is important that the voic
es of new technology be there,"
he added.
The new members will be for
mally admitted to the academy
at a black-tie ceremony held in
Washington, D.C. in September,
Cover said.
