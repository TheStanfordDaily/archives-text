## 17 candidates eschew parties in ASSU Senate race, tackle similar issues 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
One new COP slate and a bevy of under
graduate senator would-bes have decided to
run in the ASSU election outside political
party lines.
The Hammer and Coffin Party has
announced that it will run a Council of Presi
dents slate in April's election. The party,
which is connected to the Chaparral humor
magazine, is a frequent COP contender.
The Chappie's slate, called "The Very Seri
ous Clowns," consists of sophomores Chris
Onstad and Eric Saxon and junior Scott Gag
ner. Saxon said the fourth slate member has
not yet been chosen. If elected, he said, the
quartet would try to make campus more fun.
According to Saxon, the slate chose its
name because "basically we view the ASSU as
a circus and as clowns we naturally inherit the
leadership r01e5.... We do actually think we
have a good chance (to win) because people
love clowns."
The Hammer and Coffin slate joins the
slates of two political parties — People's Plat
form and Students' Alliance — in the COP
race.
The senate race has also broadened. Elec
tion Commissioner Jonathan Berent

announced on Saturday that 17 undergradu
ates will run independently for ASSU Senate
this spring, bringing the total number of
undergraduate candidates to 43.
While most of the independents said they
do not plan to ally with other independents,
their campaign issues — post office inefficien
cy, campus security and undergraduate-grad
uate relations — are virtually the same as
those of the two established parties, People's
Platform and Students' Alliance.
Several of the candidates said they were
running as independents because the parties
are too constraining. "I felt that both groups
had formed parties based on extremes. Most of
the answers to this University lie somewhere
in the middle," said junior Monica Bhargava.
Junior Ryo Shohara concurred. "I felt that
by not being part of another party, I could
function independently and not be prone to
party politics," he said.
Shohara admitted that the parties "have
the advantage in that they can all pool their
resources. However, students are inclined to
vote independently, not by party, but for
what's best."
Sophomore Michael Pace said he is wary of
the parties because they ask candidates to
"conform to other people's ideals and stan
dards," something he said he refuses to do.

Although he originally sought the endorse
ment of the People's Platform party, Pace said
he really only wanted an affiliation, and mis
communication with party members led him
to attend the slating meeting unprepared. "I
perhaps shouldn't have been at that meeting,"
he said.
Pace said he hopes to make Dead Week
classes optional and prevent new material
from being introduced. He said he will also
attempt to lower food service prices by work
ing with the administration. "If you have
points, you're paying too much money," he
said.
Freshman Bruce Gibney, who said he is
running under the "Friends of Gerhard"
party, was candid in describing his plans if
elected: "I plan to do precisely what all the
other candidates plan to do: nothing. Only I'm
not going to lie about it,"he said.
Other candidates running for the 20 under
graduate senator spots include: freshmen Alex
Scherbakovsky, Andrew Vardanian and Brian
Lee; sophomores Bill Chiu, Johnny Tu, Kai-
Ming Fu, Howard Loo and Gil Serrano;
juniors Imran Maskatia, Gregor Gentschev
and Eric Logan; and seniors Juan Henao and
David Cohen.
In other election news, Berent
also announced the candidates for
class presidents.
Slates running for senior class
president are: Angela Booker,
Sarah Cranston, Andre Javier and
Aaron Lehman; Liane Nomura,
Tom Sharpe, Nancy Salas and L.
Reed Kennedy; and Jeffrey Dah
mus, Christopher Ruiz de Esparza,
Mercedes Carnethon and Carol
Cocker.

The slates running for junior

class president consist of: Rupali
Gandhi, Mark Cordoba, Jason Liu
and Charles Katz; Sky Meltzer,
Aymeric Fraise, Aisha Jeter and
Soraya Yanar; and Brad Davies
Tarina Kang, Meghvi Maheta and
Cabral Bonner.
Slates running for sophomore
class president are: Alex Leung,
Stanley Yung, Pete Marsh and
Matthew Lippert; Andrew Black
burn, Rebecca Dodds, Ramesh
Srinivasan and Andrew Howard;
Kruti Patel, Kimberly Shapiro,
Joe Kwok and Praveen Rang
nath; and Greg Vosganion, Andy
Lane, Rachel Ochoa and Kara
Dußray.
