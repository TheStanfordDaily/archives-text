# Students, citizens find ways to chop budget in political workshop
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
If everyone is willing to give a
little, the federal budget can be
balanced, a group of more than
100 citizens and students decided
Saturday.
Each of the 14 groups partici
pating in the political workshop,
"Exercise in Hard Choices," were
able to design hypothetical pro
posals to bring the federal budget
under control by the year 2000.
Stanford-in-Government
helped sponsor the workshop by
The Concord Coalition, a national
non-partisan group dedicated to
informing the public about the
need to balance the budget. The
coalition paid the way for 10
Stanford students to participate.
At the successful end of four
hours of debate, junior Ur Jaddou
said the exercise "made people
feel.. . things are not as unman
ageable as they seem."
The budget-cutters were faced
with the task of finding ways to
reduce the total federal budget
deficit from $1.1 trillion to $434
billion over the next five years.
Most groups completed the day
with well more than the mini
mum $675 billion in cuts, includ
ing several groups that cut up to
$1.3 trillion for a surplus.
In reports at the close of the
session, participants discussed
the most difficult and least diffi
cult areas to cut. Health care
came in at the top of the difficult
list. Areas such as farm subsidies,
science and technology and feder
al parking spaces were cut with
little debate, but arguments over
the importance of national
defense varied from group to
group.
"It was a very interesting exer
cise," said graduate student Tom
Todaro. "I was surprised how

willing people were to cut [fund
ing to eliminate] social problems,
but I was impressed that we could
cut from both the revenue and
expenditure sides."
Todaro said he signed up for
the workshop because "I was
interested to see if I could do
what so many other people are
having difficulty doing."
Although he found success,
Todaro said the groups' conclu
sions — arrived at without the
pressure of lobbyists or the media
— might not be practical in polit
ical situations. What politicians
should pay attention to, he said,
is "the knowledge that the major
ity of people do seem willing to
look beyond personal benefit."
Todaro and Jaddou said they
felt the students' voice was
important even though debate in
their groups was often divided
along gender lines rather than
age. Sometimes the older and
younger participants broke
stereotypes, they added.
The results of the Social Secu
rity debate, for example, sur
prised Jaddou, she said. "I didn't
want Social Security cut," she
said, "but [the older participants]
wanted to cut it."
Including students "certainly
adds a different perspective,"
said sophomore Jim Finsten,
SlG's director of public policy
forums. "I wish we had been able
to get more students involved.
It's a good chance to get the stu
dents and the community to
interact."
And through this cooperation,
everyone involved learned what
the coalition hoped they would,
said coordinator Tim Mazur —
that a balanced budget is a real
possibility.
"A lot of people are more confi
dent that we can get the deficit to
zero," Mazur said.
