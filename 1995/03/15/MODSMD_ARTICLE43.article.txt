# Thanks to lots of rain, Lake Lag to be filled

Due to to heavy, regular rains this win
ter, Lake Lagunita will be filled next quar
ter, allowing students to sail and windsurf
on campus for the first time since the
spring of 1993.
The decision to fill Lake Lag was made
earlier this week by the University's Lake
Commission, which is composed of staff
members whose departments — such as
Facilities and the Dean of Students Office
— are affected by the lake's operations,
said Asst. Director of Student Activities
Heather Dunn.
The process of filling Lake Lag should
begin within the next week. Due to heavy
rainfall in the last few days, the lake cur
rently holds seven feet of water and only
requires an additional two feet in order to
be completely full, said Larry Andrews, the
University's water and sewer superinten
dent.
In making its decision, the commission
considered all the implications of having

the lake filled, including available water
supply and the effect on the endangered
California tiger salamanders, Dunn said.
Whether or not to fill Lake Lag is "heav
ily reliant on rainfall to the area," Dunn
added.
According to Andrews, Stanford has
received 17.43 inches of rainfall since last
June, compared to 9.08 inches in 1993-94.
The rainfall total at Stanford is normally
about 16 inches per year.
The decision to fill the lake does not
depend on a minimum amount of rainfall,
but rather on "how and when it comes,"
said Utilities Manager Kathleen Cruise.
The rain this winter was continuously
distributed, rather than the result of one
deluge, and this helped improve the likeli
hood of filling Lake Lag, Cruise said.
In deciding whether to fill the lake, Uni
versity personnel looked at the water levels
in nearby Felt Lake — which is currently
overflowing — and San Francisquito
Creek, Andrews said. Since those levels
were sufficient to meet campus irrigation
