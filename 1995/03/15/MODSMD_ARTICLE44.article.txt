# Honoring a legacy
## Founders honored in church 
### Martin L. Yeung Contributing writer 
Jane and Leland Stanford's
legacy has grown beyond their
original vision but the University
still adheres to its founders' per
sonal convictions of what a liber
al arts education should be,
speakers said at the annual
Founders' Day celebration on
Sunday.
Members of the Stanford His
torical Society and the Alumni
Association gathered in Memorial
Church to commemorate the day,
which recognizes the Stanfords as
the University's principal bene
factors.
About 250 people gathered to
hear Dean of the Chapel Robert
Gregg deliver Sunday mass. In his
sermon, Gregg said the Stanfords
had hoped that students of their
University would not merely be
book smart, devoid of any "real
world" morality and skills.
"The chief purpose of a good
education is to go beyond our per
ception of reality," he said. "The
vision of the Stanfords was to
offer not only a place of academic
and intellectual education, but a
place where moral community
and convictions would be devel
oped."
Gregg said the University was
the ultimate example of the Stan
fords' conviction that people
should give back to society.
The University "was a gift for
the benefit of the community and
especially the children," he said.
Gregg's speech was followed by
remarks from senior class co-pres
ident Sarah Marie Martin. She
reflected on her experiences at
Stanford for the past three years
and offered her interpretation of
the legacy that the Stanfords left
behind by establishing the Uni
versity.
"From the academic institution
that Jane and Leland Stanford
founded, this University has
grown to be emulated and
respected around the world," she
said.
Martin said she has met and
befriended a wide range of people
during her undergraduate career
— a diversity that makes Stan
ford unique and great.
"Stanford students, through
positive peer pressure and a deep
commitment . . . mold well
rounded and contentious stu
dents," said Martin.
Bruce Wiggins, class of '48,
spoke on the experiences of past
students. An English who
hashed and washed dishes in
Lagunita Dining Hall to make
ends meet, Wiggins brought
examples from the past and pre
sent to snow how Stanford had
developed and expanded from a
provincial college to an elite Uni

vereity.
Wiggins held up a copy of the
alumni directory from 1920 and
compared it to a 1995 volume.
Then he held up a copy of the
1995 Stanford Directory and
compared it to the one from his
student days. The old editions
were considerably smaller than
the current ones.
He noted other changes that
showed how the University had
grown, recalling how he used to
go and listen to the San Francisco
symphony play in what is now
Building 120, McClatchy Hall.
Where Escondido Village is now
located, there was once an airport
where air shows and barnstorm
ing events would be held, he
remembered.
At the end of the church obser
vance, a wreath of flowers in Stan
ford colors was set in the center of
the Memorial Church stage. The
annual procession out to the Mau
soleum, where the flowers will
eventually be laid, was canceled
due to last week's rain.
