# Dining Services puts Snapple back on shelves at same price

Snapple is back.
After a two-week disappearance, the flavored
drink enjoyed by students across campus has
returned home to University dining hall shelves â€”
and it hasn't gone up in price, thanks to Dining Ser
vices' new contract with Snapple's distributor.
Earlier this quarter, Dining Services dropped its
price on Snapple from $1.65 to $1.30 to comply with
student requests. The lower price, however,
strained Dining Services' finances, forcing it to dis
continue the purchase of Snapple.
But now, according to Dining Services Opera
tions Manager Craig Mitchell, the University has
"the best price anyone is getting in the region."
Mitchell, however, refused to comment on the
wholesale price of Snapple, saying only that Dining
Services' "finances are complex and we have made
arrangements to sell Snapple at the lower price" of
$1.30.

He said Dining Services had been looking for a
lower price on Snapple or substitute drinks before
Snapple purchases were discontinued.
About a week ago, Mitchell said, Dining Ser
vices was able to use its high-volume purchases of
Snapple as a chip to renegotiate its contract with
Course West, Snapple's distributor, to keep prices
low.
Several students were thrilled by the return of
the "best stuff on earth" to dining hall shelves.
Freshman Roberto Ochoa, a Snapple enthusiast
who once had five cases of the drink in his room,
said he is happy about the return.
Dining Services currently "doesn't have a lot of
variety" on the shelves, Ochoa said, but he is pleased
that "they are finally listening to us."
"As soon as they start bringing in the variety, it
will be time to bulk up again," he said.
But Mitchell said that no students called Dining
Services to complain about the lack of Snapple, and
the topic was never brought up at the meeting of
Dining Services' Student Advisory Board.
