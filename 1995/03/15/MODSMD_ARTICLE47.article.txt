## NCAA says yes but men will go East 10 seed to battle UNC-Charlotte 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Break out those dancing shoes and dust off that
tux because the Stanford men's basketball team is
going to the Big Dance. It's time for the wild, the
wacky, the crazy — the Madness of March.
After finishing the season with a 19-8 overall
record and a 10-8 mark in the grueling Pacific 10
Conference, the Cardinal men learned Sunday
afternoon that their season-long goal to reach the
NCAA tournament had been reached.
"We're excited," said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "We were nervous. No question, I
think the kids had a lot of nervous energy. Part of
you said we're going, but until they put your name
up on the board, you're nervous about it, and you
just don't know. I feel great for the kids. They
worked real hard."
The Cardinal, as a 10th seed, is slated to face
the seventh-seeded 49ers of North Carolina-Char
lotte in a first round game in the East Regional.
The game will be held at Knickerbocker Arena in
Albany, N.Y.
The bad news is that Albany was the farthest
place the Cardinal could have been placed. And
with Dead Week and finals on hand, travel plans
could cause things to be rough. On the other hand,
instead of a Thursday game, the game will be 9:30
a.m. PST Friday morning, giving players more
time to get acclimated. No matter what, they're
just happy they got there.
"The kids are really excited about having this
opportunity," Montgomery said. "Now it's a mat
ter of us taking advantage of this opportunity and
going out and playing the best basketball we're
capable of."
Stanford may have lucked out in terms of play
ing a seven seed when comparing the 49ers to the
other more illustrious seven seeds — Cincinnati,
lowa State and Syracuse.

Like Stanford, the 49ers have an overall record
of 19-8. UNCC's 8-4 conference mark was enough
to give the 49ers the regular-season title in the
Metro Conference — a league that sent all of its
seven teams to the postseason. But the 49ers have
floundered as of late, dropping three of their last
four games, including a first-round game to
