## NCAA says yes but men will go East 10 seed to battle UNC-Charlotte 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Break out those dancing shoes and dust off that
tux because the Stanford men's basketball team is
going to the Big Dance. It's time for the wild, the
wacky, the crazy — the Madness of March.
After finishing the season with a 19-8 overall
record and a 10-8 mark in the grueling Pacific 10
Conference, the Cardinal men learned Sunday
afternoon that their season-long goal to reach the
NCAA tournament had been reached.
"We're excited," said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "We were nervous. No question, I
think the kids had a lot of nervous energy. Part of
you said we're going, but until they put your name
up on the board, you're nervous about it, and you
just don't know. I feel great for the kids. They
worked real hard."
The Cardinal, as a 10th seed, is slated to face
the seventh-seeded 49ers of North Carolina-Char
lotte in a first round game in the East Regional.
The game will be held at Knickerbocker Arena in
Albany, N.Y.
The bad news is that Albany was the farthest
place the Cardinal could have been placed. And
with Dead Week and finals on hand, travel plans
could cause things to be rough. On the other hand,
instead of a Thursday game, the game will be 9:30
a.m. PST Friday morning, giving players more
time to get acclimated. No matter what, they're
just happy they got there.
"The kids are really excited about having this
opportunity," Montgomery said. "Now it's a mat
ter of us taking advantage of this opportunity and
going out and playing the best basketball we're
capable of."
Stanford may have lucked out in terms of play
ing a seven seed when comparing the 49ers to the
other more illustrious seven seeds — Cincinnati,
lowa State and Syracuse.

Like Stanford, the 49ers have an overall record
of 19-8. UNCC's 8-4 conference mark was enough
to give the 49ers the regular-season title in the
Metro Conference — a league that sent all of its
seven teams to the postseason. But the 49ers have
floundered as of late, dropping three of their last
four games, including a first-round game to

Southern Mississippi in their con
ference tourney.
UNCC's main man is big 6-
foot-7, 235-pound power forward
Jams Lang. Lang averaged 16.2
points and 8.7 rebounds per game.
A high-riser who can also shoot it
from outside, Lang converted 43.2
percent of three-point attempts.
As an All-Conference member for
the fourth straight year, Lang
also earned Metro Conference
Player of the Year Honors.
Junior Cardinal forward Dar
ren Allaway who has displayed a
penchant for playing tough
defense against players like Lang
will draw the lofty assignment of
guarding the 49er strongman.
"This game is tailor-made for
Darren as far as guarding Jarvis
Lang," Montgomery said. "Lang's
a player like Virginia's Junior
Burroughs. He's very strong, a
bull of a player and the MVP of
their conference. This will be a
good test for Darren."
Lang is joined in the frontcourt
by 7-0 senior center Jermaine
Parker. Parker (10.1 points per
game, 6 rebounds per game) has
been effective in the pivot convert
ing 59.7 percent of his field goal
attempts and proving to be the
conference's preeminent rejection
artist, swatting 3.4 shots a game.
With Parker's backup DeMar
co Johnson having earned a spot
on the conference All-Freshman
team coming off the bench,
there's no question Stanford All-
Pac-10-Freshman center Tim
Young, who has steadily improved
and put together three consecu
tive double-doubles, will be put to
the test.
The backcourt is more of a
question mark as 49er head coach
Jeff Mullins has rotated five dif
ferent guards into the starting
lineup throughout the season.
Nothing like that for the Cardi
nal. In All-Pac-10 guards Dion
Cross and Brevin Knight, Stan
ford brings a high-caliber back
court into a tournament where
strong guard play almost always
equals success.

"Brevin takes care of a lot of lit
tle ills that you worry about,"
Montgomery said. "Guard play is
always critical when you play a
team you don't know much about
because your point guard controls
the ball and runs your club, and
Brevin is certainly a guy we feel
comfortable with."
Despite a suspect backcourt,
what UNCC does have is depth.
With nine players averaging dou
ble figures in minutes, the 49er
bench has outscored the opposi
tion's reserves 26.8 to 12.8. With
UNCC struggling at times offen
sively, shooting field goals at a
44.4 percent clip, the bench scor
ing constitutes 38 percent of the
49er offense. The defense has
been sound as well, holding oppo
nents to 41.3 percent and have
out-rebounded them an average of
6.2 boards a game.
Stanford brings similar statis
tics to the table, struggling at times
on offense (seventh in the Pac-10
in field goal percentage at 45.0),
but nevertheless pounding the
boards (third in the Pac-10 with a
rebound margin of 3.1) and playing
tough, efficient, no-frills defense
(third in both scoring defense and
field goal defense in the Pac-10).
Both teams also run a variety of set
offenses and primarily a man-to
man defense. It could simply come
down to the basics: mistake-free
execution, hard-nosed defense and
physical intensity.
While the Cardinal's trip to the
promised land may not have been
as tortuous as Moses', it's still a
road less taken. After winning 10
straight to start the season, Stan
ford hit more than its fair share of
bumps — the biggest being the
Oregon train wreck two weeks ago
— on its road to the tournament.
However, the Cardinal has
learned to win, even if it means
winning ugly. Liken the Cardinal
to being the person that doesn't
go to the prom as the best looking
date, but nevertheless is fully
intent on stirring things up.
"Now, we feel like we're start
ing to play better," said senior for
ward Andy Poppink. "We're kind
of on a roll going into the tourna
ment. We feel confident about
playing well, and doing something
in the tournament."

A Cardinal victory would most
likely pit Stanford against the sec
ond-seeded Minutemen of Mas
sachusetts. Atlantic 10 champion
UMass, with an overall mark of
26-4, touts two of the nation's
premier frontcourt players in
NBA prospects forward Lou Roe
(17.0 points, 8.2 rebounds per
game) and center Marcus Camby
(13.7 points, 6.3 rebounds, 3.3
blocks per game).
While UMass would be heavily
favored in such a matchup, the
Cardinal has faced highly rated
squads before.
"You see that UCLA is going as
the No. 1 team in the country, and
that's a team that we've played
pretty tough the two times we've
played them," Poppink said. "You
see teams like that being seeded so
high, and a team that we might be
matched up with won't seem like
the big giant."
The lack of preparation time
that comes along with tourna
ment play will work in Stanford's
favor. Towards the end of the con
ference season, with teams get
ting a chance to examine Stanford
first-hand, they were able to take
away some of the Cardinal's capa
bilities. Teams in the tournament
will have no such opportunity.
"I think some of our success
early in the season was because
teams didn't have a chance to
scout," said senior center Bart
Lammersen. "I think that's one of
our advantages going into the
tournament."
Not since the glorious champi
onship season of 1942 has the
Cardinal won an NCAA tourna
ment game. Lammersen and Pop
pink, along with seniors Warren
Gravely and Todd Manley, were
on the Cardinal's last NCAA tour
nament squad in 1991-92, which
was seeded 12th and lost in the
first round to fifth-seeded Alaba
ma. The team knows how pre
cious the invitation is, and
although the goal has been
achieved, the season is by no
means finished.
"Hopefully, we can get some
renewed energy," Montgomery
said. "It's like a new season. You
wear down from playing in confer
ence and trying to battle to get in
the top half. That's all done now.

Cross and Brevin Knight, Stan
ford brings a high-caliber back
court into a tournament where
strong guard play almost always
equals success.

"Brevin takes care of a lot of lit
tle ills that you worry about,"
Montgomery said. "Guard play is
always critical when you play a
team you don't know much about
because your point guard controls
the ball and runs your club, and
Brevin is certainly a guy we feel
comfortable with."
Despite a suspect backcourt,
what UNCC does have is depth.
With nine players averaging dou
ble figures in minutes, the 49er
bench has outscored the opposi
tion's reserves 26.8 to 12.8. With
UNCC struggling at times offen
sively, shooting field goals at a
44.4 percent clip, the bench scor
ing constitutes 38 percent of the
49er offense. The defense has
been sound as well, holding oppo
nents to 41.3 percent and have
out-rebounded them an average of
6.2 boards a game.
Stanford brings similar statis
tics to the table, struggling at times
on offense (seventh in the Pac-10
in field goal percentage at 45.0),
but nevertheless pounding the
boards (third in the Pac-10 with a
rebound margin of 3.1) and playing
tough, efficient, no-frills defense
(third in both scoring defense and
field goal defense in the Pac-10).
Both teams also run a variety of set
offenses and primarily a man-to
man defense. It could simply come
down to the basics: mistake-free
execution, hard-nosed defense and
physical intensity.
While the Cardinal's trip to the
promised land may not have been
as tortuous as Moses', it's still a
road less taken. After winning 10
straight to start the season, Stan
ford hit more than its fair share of
bumps — the biggest being the
Oregon train wreck two weeks ago
— on its road to the tournament.
However, the Cardinal has
learned to win, even if it means
winning ugly. Liken the Cardinal
to being the person that doesn't
go to the prom as the best looking
date, but nevertheless is fully
intent on stirring things up.
"Now, we feel like we're start
ing to play better," said senior for
ward Andy Poppink. "We're kind
of on a roll going into the tourna
ment. We feel confident about
playing well, and doing something
in the tournament."

A Cardinal victory would most
likely pit Stanford against the sec
ond-seeded Minutemen of Mas
sachusetts. Atlantic 10 champion
UMass, with an overall mark of
26-4, touts two of the nation's
premier frontcourt players in
NBA prospects forward Lou Roe
(17.0 points, 8.2 rebounds per
game) and center Marcus Camby
(13.7 points, 6.3 rebounds, 3.3
blocks per game).
While UMass would be heavily
favored in such a matchup, the
Cardinal has faced highly rated
squads before.
"You see that UCLA is going as
the No. 1 team in the country, and
that's a team that we've played
pretty tough the two times we've
played them," Poppink said. "You
see teams like that being seeded so
high, and a team that we might be
matched up with won't seem like
the big giant."
The lack of preparation time
that comes along with tourna
ment play will work in Stanford's
favor. Towards the end of the con
ference season, with teams get
ting a chance to examine Stanford
first-hand, they were able to take
away some of the Cardinal's capa
bilities. Teams in the tournament
will have no such opportunity.
"I think some of our success
early in the season was because
teams didn't have a chance to
scout," said senior center Bart
Lammersen. "I think that's one of
our advantages going into the
tournament."
Not since the glorious champi
onship season of 1942 has the
Cardinal won an NCAA tourna
ment game. Lammersen and Pop
pink, along with seniors Warren
Gravely and Todd Manley, were
on the Cardinal's last NCAA tour
nament squad in 1991-92, which
was seeded 12th and lost in the
first round to fifth-seeded Alaba
ma. The team knows how pre
cious the invitation is, and
although the goal has been
achieved, the season is by no
means finished.
"Hopefully, we can get some
renewed energy," Montgomery
said. "It's like a new season. You
wear down from playing in confer
ence and trying to battle to get in
the top half. That's all done now.
Break out those dancing shoes and dust off that
tux because the Stanford men's basketball team is
going to the Big Dance. It's time for the wild, the
wacky, the crazy — the Madness of March.
After finishing the season with a 19-8 overall
record and a 10-8 mark in the grueling Pacific 10
Conference, the Cardinal men learned Sunday
afternoon that their season-long goal to reach the
NCAA tournament had been reached.
"We're excited," said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "We were nervous. No question, I
think the kids had a lot of nervous energy. Part of
you said we're going, but until they put your name
up on the board, you're nervous about it, and you
just don't know. I feel great for the kids. They
worked real hard."
The Cardinal, as a 10th seed, is slated to face
the seventh-seeded 49ers of North Carolina-Char
lotte in a first round game in the East Regional.
The game will be held at Knickerbocker Arena in
Albany, N.Y.
The bad news is that Albany was the farthest
place the Cardinal could have been placed. And
with Dead Week and finals on hand, travel plans
could cause things to be rough. On the other hand,
instead of a Thursday game, the game will be 9:30
a.m. PST Friday morning, giving players more
time to get acclimated. No matter what, they're
just happy they got there.
"The kids are really excited about having this
opportunity," Montgomery said. "Now it's a mat
ter of us taking advantage of this opportunity and
going out and playing the best basketball we're
capable of."
Stanford may have lucked out in terms of play
ing a seven seed when comparing the 49ers to the
other more illustrious seven seeds — Cincinnati,
lowa State and Syracuse.

Like Stanford, the 49ers have an overall record
of 19-8. UNCC's 8-4 conference mark was enough
to give the 49ers the regular-season title in the
Metro Conference — a league that sent all of its
seven teams to the postseason. But the 49ers have
floundered as of late, dropping three of their last
four games, including a first-round game to

night's win.
Southern Mississippi in their con
ference tourney.
UNCC's main man is big 6-
foot-7, 235-pound power forward
Jams Lang. Lang averaged 16.2
points and 8.7 rebounds per game.
A high-riser who can also shoot it
from outside, Lang converted 43.2
percent of three-point attempts.
As an All-Conference member for
the fourth straight year, Lang
also earned Metro Conference
Player of the Year Honors.
Junior Cardinal forward Dar
ren Allaway who has displayed a
penchant for playing tough
defense against players like Lang
will draw the lofty assignment of
guarding the 49er strongman.
"This game is tailor-made for
Darren as far as guarding Jarvis
Lang," Montgomery said. "Lang's
a player like Virginia's Junior
Burroughs. He's very strong, a
bull of a player and the MVP of
their conference. This will be a
good test for Darren."
Lang is joined in the frontcourt
by 7-0 senior center Jermaine
Parker. Parker (10.1 points per
game, 6 rebounds per game) has
been effective in the pivot convert
ing 59.7 percent of his field goal
attempts and proving to be the
conference's preeminent rejection
artist, swatting 3.4 shots a game.
With Parker's backup DeMar
co Johnson having earned a spot
on the conference All-Freshman
team coming off the bench,
there's no question Stanford All-
Pac-10-Freshman center Tim
Young, who has steadily improved
and put together three consecu
tive double-doubles, will be put to
the test.
The backcourt is more of a
question mark as 49er head coach
Jeff Mullins has rotated five dif
ferent guards into the starting
lineup throughout the season.
Nothing like that for the Cardi
nal. In All-Pac-10 guards Dion
Cross and Brevin Knight, Stan
ford brings a high-caliber back
court into a tournament where
strong guard play almost always
equals success.

"Brevin takes care of a lot of lit
