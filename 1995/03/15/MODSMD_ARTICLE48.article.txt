# Win over Huskies puts Cardinal in

Washington 65
Stanford 75

All season long, the Stanford
men basketball team has done
things the only way it knows
how. The hard way.
And in last Saturday night's
regular season finale against

Washington, the Cardinal held
true to form and lived life fol
lowing Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery's edict,
"When it becomes easy, some
thing's wrong."
In that case, everything was
just fine against the Huskies
because nothing came easy in
the Cardinal's 75-65 victory.
Call it a fitting end to a fitting
season.
"Washington got off to a
great start," said Montgomery.
"They shot the ball in. [Theyl
made about their first four or

five shots in a row. Fortunately,
we got it turned around a little
bit as far as playing some
defense and trying to get down
and making something happen."
Emotions and expectations
were high prior to the game.
With a tournament berth on the
line and Senior Night festivities
before tip-off, the near-capacity
Maples Pavilion crowd of 7,451
was anxiously anticipating a
good old-fashioned blow-out
against the bottom-dwelling
Huskies (9-18, 5-13 in the Pac
-10).
If it were only that easy. Wash
ington jumped out to an early 25-
10 lead, riding the hot shooting of
Husky freshman forward Mike
Sanford.
"The first half was not so
good," Montgomery said. "We
turned the ball over 11 times
against really no pressure. We
were trying to force things.
"We got impatient. We wanted
to win now. We wanted to make
plays now without realizing we
had to play 40 minutes. We just
needed to play more patiently and
let things flow."
Sanford, a selection to the All-
Pac-10 freshman team, hit 3-of-4
from behind the arc in the first
half and fmished the game with
24 points.
"Sanford was kind of a three
man who plays four for them and
moves away from the basket,"
Montgomery said. "He was not a
good match-up for us. We had
problems with that early on try
ing to defend him in their motion
offense."
But Stanford's own All-Pac-10
freshman, center Tim Young,
provided a boost late in the open

ing half to tie the contest 34-34 at
intermission.
With Cardinal star sophomore
point guard Brevin Knight ham
pered by foul trouble, Young did
it all on both ends of the court in
the Cardinal's 12-2 run. With just
over two minutes to play in the
first half, the 7-foot-1 Cardinal
drained a 12-foot jumper. Then
on Stanford's next offensive
series, Young threw down a mon
ster dunk, his second of the night,
to close the Husky lead to five.
The jam was followed by a Young
rejection of Washington's Bryant
Boston which led to a lay-up by
Stanford swingman David Har
bour.
"Luckily [the slow start] was
early in the game," Harbour said.
"I wasn't too worried about it. I
knew we would make our run
sooner or later. It was just a mat
ter of us picking up the tempo
and getting it going a little bit. It
seems lately we just haven't
started the game off impressive
ly, and we just can't continue to
do that."
With the Cardinal down by
three, Young made a lay-up
despite being fouled by Sanford
and converted the ensuing free
throw to tie the game. Young
completed the game with his
third-straight double-double, 14
points and 13 rebounds. Young's
13 boards led the Cardinal's over

all domination of the glass, outre
bounding the Huskies 45-26.
The dogfight continued in the
second half with Washington
again jumping out to an early
lead. It was short-lived, however,
as a Knight jumper from the top
of the key sparked a 12-0 run, giv
ing Stanford a 56-49 lead.
Sanford scored four straight
points, including a spectacular
alley-oop from Boston to tie the
score, but a timely three-pointer
by junior guard Dion Cross ignit
ed another Cardinal rally.
Two free throws by Knight,
who shot 14-of-14 from the line
and finished with 22 points, gave
Stanford a 67-59 advantage, and
there was no looking back for the
tournament-bound Cardinal.
"We just wanted to let the
game come to us," Knight said.
"We just went out and did what
we had to do to win, and it worked
out for us in the end."
The results were fine, but in
typical Stanford fashion, it wasn't
pretty with the Cardinal shooting
just 42.1 percent from the floor.
Washington, however, shot just
41.7 percent. That, along with the
board work, gave Stanford just
enough for the win.
"It was a tough gritty, grind-it
out type of an effort," Mont
gomery said. "And we got the
thing done."
But it didn't come easy.
