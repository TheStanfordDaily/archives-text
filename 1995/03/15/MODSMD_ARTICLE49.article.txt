# Women denied No. 1 seed
## Vanderbilt shipped West with six losses 
### Emery Chen Jeremy Stone Staff writers 
After posting a 26-2 record and
steamrolling through a tough
Pacific 10 Conference schedule,
the Stanford women's basketball
team figured it had done every
thing in its power to secure a No.
1 seed in the NCAA tournament.
The all-powerful selection
committee, however, saw things
differently. While keeping the
Cardinal in the West Regional,
the NCAA elected to ship SEC
tournament champion Vanderbilt
and its six losses out West as the
top seed.
"I'm never surprised by the
NCAA," said Coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "Sometimes you just
wonder what you have to do."
The Lady Commodores' upset
win over Tennessee (29-2) in the
SEC tournament championship

apparently put Vanderbilt over
the top. With a 15-6 record in
games against tournament teams
(as opposed to the Cardinal's 10-
2), the Lady Commodores gar
nered the nod.
Stanford, one of five Pac-10
squads to receive a bid, will take
on 15th-seeded UC-Irvine (19-10)
at 8:30 p.m. tomorrow in the late
game of a subregional at Maples
Pavilion. The 6 p.m. match-up
pits seventh-seeded Southern
Mississippi (21-8) and Southern
Methodist (20-9), the No. 10 seed.
The winners of the two contests
will square off Saturday evening
at 7:30 p.m. for the right to travel
to Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles
for the West Regional.
The Golden Eagles were one of
a surprising four teams from the
Metro Conference to earn a bid
after knocking off Louisville 95-
83 in the finals. SMU secured an
at-large bid by finishing second in

the Southwest Conference, losing
for the third time to champion
Texas Tech in the SWC Champi
onship. The Mustangs sport a 1-6
record against tournament
squads.
The Anteaters earned an auto
matic bid by capturing the Big
West tournament. After finishing
third in the regular season, UC-
Irvine defeated Long Beach State
71-60 in the first round, Cal
State-Fullerton and Pacific.
Colleen Matsuhara's Anteaters
squeaked by the Titans by two
points, 69-67, and won 65-53 in
the finals. By contrast, in a non
conference battle with Fullerton
earlier this year, the Cardinal
matched its Pac-10 record for sin
gle-game scoring in a 122-80
romp.
"They are very athletic," Van-
Derveer said. "They have some
