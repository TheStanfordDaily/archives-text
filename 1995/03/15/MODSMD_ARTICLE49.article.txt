# Women denied No. 1 seed
## Vanderbilt shipped West with six losses 
### Emery Chen Jeremy Stone Staff writers 
After posting a 26-2 record and
steamrolling through a tough
Pacific 10 Conference schedule,
the Stanford women's basketball
team figured it had done every
thing in its power to secure a No.
1 seed in the NCAA tournament.
The all-powerful selection
committee, however, saw things
differently. While keeping the
Cardinal in the West Regional,
the NCAA elected to ship SEC
tournament champion Vanderbilt
and its six losses out West as the
top seed.
"I'm never surprised by the
NCAA," said Coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "Sometimes you just
wonder what you have to do."
The Lady Commodores' upset
win over Tennessee (29-2) in the
SEC tournament championship

apparently put Vanderbilt over
the top. With a 15-6 record in
games against tournament teams
(as opposed to the Cardinal's 10-
2), the Lady Commodores gar
nered the nod.
Stanford, one of five Pac-10
squads to receive a bid, will take
on 15th-seeded UC-Irvine (19-10)
at 8:30 p.m. tomorrow in the late
game of a subregional at Maples
Pavilion. The 6 p.m. match-up
pits seventh-seeded Southern
Mississippi (21-8) and Southern
Methodist (20-9), the No. 10 seed.
The winners of the two contests
will square off Saturday evening
at 7:30 p.m. for the right to travel
to Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles
for the West Regional.
The Golden Eagles were one of
a surprising four teams from the
Metro Conference to earn a bid
after knocking off Louisville 95-
83 in the finals. SMU secured an
at-large bid by finishing second in

the Southwest Conference, losing
for the third time to champion
Texas Tech in the SWC Champi
onship. The Mustangs sport a 1-6
record against tournament
squads.
The Anteaters earned an auto
matic bid by capturing the Big
West tournament. After finishing
third in the regular season, UC-
Irvine defeated Long Beach State
71-60 in the first round, Cal
State-Fullerton and Pacific.
Colleen Matsuhara's Anteaters
squeaked by the Titans by two
points, 69-67, and won 65-53 in
the finals. By contrast, in a non
conference battle with Fullerton
earlier this year, the Cardinal
matched its Pac-10 record for sin
gle-game scoring in a 122-80
romp.
"They are very athletic," Van-
Derveer said. "They have some
pretty good size inside and finished
strong and won the tournament."
After sporting a combined record
of 12-69 in the three previous cam
paigns, UC-Irvine rebounded this
year thanks largely to the efforts of
its low-post combo. Junior center
Allah-mi Basheer leads the way
with 15.8 points and 7.9 rebounds
per outing, while senior power for
ward Jinelle Williams is runner-up
with 12.0 and 7.8 respectively.
However, the Anteaters have
seldom encountered size such as
the Cardinal offers. At 6-2, Basheer
gives up three inches to Stanford's
Anita Kaplan. Cardinal power for
ward Rachel Hemmer has a half
foot advantage over Williams. No
other Irvine starter is over 5-10,
and the bench features nobody
taller than an even six feet.
On the other hand, Vanderbilt
will have no such size difficulties.
With 6-7 starting center Angela
Gorsica, Jim Foster's team is
expected to rout bottom-seed
Northern Illinois (17-13), the Mid
western Collegiate champion. The
Huskies are one of seven teams
making their initial appearance in
the NCAAs. They then await the
winner of Memphis (21-7) against
USC (18-9) in the eight-nine
matchup.
The West's No. 5 seed, WAC reg
ular-season titlist San Diego State
(24-5), lucks out as the only team
not seeded in the top four to host a

subregional. The fourth seed, Big
Ten runner-up Purdue (21-7), can
not serve as host because the Indi
ana state girls high school champi
onships are in Mackey Arena.
In Stanford's half of the region
al, the defending national champi
ons anticipate a regional semifinal
showdown with the Cardinal. No. 3
seed North Carolina (28-4), the
ACC tournament champions, fea
ture superstar Charlotte Smith and
speedy Marion Jones but played a
light non-conference schedule.
While disappointed with the No.
2 seed, VanDerveer noted that the
situation may be beneficial for the
Cardinal.
"To tell you the truth, I might
rather play North Carolina than
Purdue," VanDerveer said. "The
West is loaded. I feel good about our
bracket, but not real good."
If Stanford cuts down the nets in
Pauley Pavilion next weekend, they
will face the champion of the East
Regional in the national semifinal.
Top seed Connecticut holds the
inside track for its first Final Four
appearance.
The Huskies, the only undefeat
ed team in the nation, have been
ranked No. 1 since mid-January
after defeating Tennessee 77-66.
Like the Lady Volunteers, UConn
also hosts its regional.
As expected, Tennessee (29-2)
and Colorado (27-2) garnered the
top seeds in the Mideast and Mid
west regions, respectively. While
the middle of the Mideast seems
tough, the Lady Buffaloes appear to
have drawn the simplest ticket to
the Final Four.

"If I had to pick any region that
stands out, the Midwest looks a lit
tle light to me," VanDerveer said.
In the Midwest are two of the
seven SEC squads, Georgia and
Mississippi. VanDerveer criticized
the conference's schedule, as each
team faces each other only once in
the 12-team league.
"The last time an SEC team won
[the national championship] was
[Tennessee] in 1991," VanDerveer
said. "I think that their records are
inflated because they don't play a
double round robin.
"I'd rather have our record [26-
2] than [Vanderbilt's] with six loss
es."
VanDerveer hopes the team's
slighting for a top seed will serve to
motivate the squad through the
tournament.
"I hope it will be a positive thing
for our team," VanDerveer said.
"Maybe it will make them work a
little harder to try and prove some
body wrong. I know it makes me
work harder."
While still confident that Stan
ford is the best team in the region,
VanDerveer clearly expected the
NCAA would find the Cardinal
deserving of the top spot in the
West.
"It's kind of like being a little kid
on your birthday and you were
eager to open your gifts," Van-
Derveer said. "You thought you
were going to get a puppy but
instead you got a gerbil."
If Stanford takes its third
national title of the '90s, Van-
Derveer can have all the puppies
she wants.
