# Judicial reform bill drowned in senate
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
In a poorly attended meeting, the ASSU
Senate last night defeated a constitutional
bill creating a seven-member judicial re
view board to ensure the ASSU conforms
to its constitution.
"At present, we have a parliamentary
system with no independent organization
which exercises judicial oversight. We
have a system where the constitution is
optional," said undergraduate senator Ed
Malone, the only one of the biils three au
thors present at the meeting.
Malone said he was concerned with
three senate actions in particular. First,
he said, the senate endorsed a bill in No
vember opposing California Proposition
187. This endorsement provoked a consti
tutional debate because the senate is only
allowed to pass bills which affect Stanford
students solely in their capacity as Stan
ford students.
Second, Malone criticized the handling
of last November's Publications Board
space-allocation controversy, during
which the Council of Presidents attempt-

Ed to fire Pub Board Di
rector Danny Bressler.
Finally, Malone dis
counted the constitution
ality of Senate Chair
Nawwar Kasrawi's re
cent suspension of the
controversial sweatshirt
rule. "This case was a bla
tant violation [of the con
stitution!," he said. "The

Senate Chair said, 'I will not enforce the
constitution.' With the consent of the sen
ate, he didn't have to."
"I do not trust the morals of the sena
tors," Malone said. "They may take some
implicit oath to uphold the constitution,
but they don't have to if they don't want
to."
The bill would have vested execution of
the board's decisions in the COP and cre
ated a three-branch system similar to the
checks and balances of the U.S. federal
government.
However, the bill did not receive the
support of either the People's Platform or
