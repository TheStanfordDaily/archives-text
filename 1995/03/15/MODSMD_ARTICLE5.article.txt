# Judicial reform bill drowned in senate
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
In a poorly attended meeting, the ASSU
Senate last night defeated a constitutional
bill creating a seven-member judicial re
view board to ensure the ASSU conforms
to its constitution.
"At present, we have a parliamentary
system with no independent organization
which exercises judicial oversight. We
have a system where the constitution is
optional," said undergraduate senator Ed
Malone, the only one of the biils three au
thors present at the meeting.
Malone said he was concerned with
three senate actions in particular. First,
he said, the senate endorsed a bill in No
vember opposing California Proposition
187. This endorsement provoked a consti
tutional debate because the senate is only
allowed to pass bills which affect Stanford
students solely in their capacity as Stan
ford students.
Second, Malone criticized the handling
of last November's Publications Board
space-allocation controversy, during
which the Council of Presidents attempt-

Ed to fire Pub Board Di
rector Danny Bressler.
Finally, Malone dis
counted the constitution
ality of Senate Chair
Nawwar Kasrawi's re
cent suspension of the
controversial sweatshirt
rule. "This case was a bla
tant violation [of the con
stitution!," he said. "The

Senate Chair said, 'I will not enforce the
constitution.' With the consent of the sen
ate, he didn't have to."
"I do not trust the morals of the sena
tors," Malone said. "They may take some
implicit oath to uphold the constitution,
but they don't have to if they don't want
to."
The bill would have vested execution of
the board's decisions in the COP and cre
ated a three-branch system similar to the
checks and balances of the U.S. federal
government.
However, the bill did not receive the
support of either the People's Platform or


Choo
the Students' Alliance parties.
The Alliance has garnered
enough signatures to place a
similar initiative on the spring
ballot which would have super
seded Malone's bill.
Though he accused the
Alliance of stealing his idea,
Malone said he still supports
the "Students' Rights Initia
tive" Alliance's. "Hopefully
their version of the judicial
review will pass," he said.
In other action last night, the
senate passed a bill giving the
Pub Board $12,500 over the
next two years to buy new com
puter equipment.
Last week, the senate struck
down a bill which would have
given all the money to the Pub
Board this year.
The bill allocates $6,000 to be
spent this year on a new layout
station and computer and facili
ties maintenance. The remain
ing money will be distributed
equally over the next two fall

quarters and be used for further
computer purchases, upgrades
and maintenance.
Undergraduate senator
Andr6 Vanier attributed last
week's failed bill to partisan
politics. "The new bill passed
because it received the support
of the [ASSU] Financial Manag
er, which was crucial to its sup
port," he said.
Deputy Senate Chair Michael
Choo, however, said the bill
passed solely because it was a
better bill.
"Last week's bill was
unclear, general, vague and did
not itemize the proposed
expenses. The new bill phases in
purchases over the next two
years," he said.
Bressler said the Pub Board
is in need of further resources,
the result of an increased num
ber of publications. The Pub
Board is unique, he said,
because it "is the only service
project charged with its own
maintenance."
Also last night, Choo gave
further details about recom
mendations resulting from a
senate study of campus safety.

Choo said he will work hard to
ensure administrative action on
the issue.
The report, released last
week, calls for the installation
of campus phones in residences
and in public areas.
The senate approved the rec
ommendations of the group,
which consisted of Choo, ASSU
secretary Alane Murdock, sen
ate associate Bill Shen and
undergraduate senator Nicole
Vazquez. The report will now be
sent to Provost Condoleezza
Rice, Choo said.
"Each dorm — as defined by
an autonomous key system —
needs a phone," Murdock said.
"The current plan that Stern
and Wilbur receive only one
phone is not adequate. We need
eight phones in Wilbur and four
phones in Stern to adequately
cover that."
She also said that a maxi
mum distance of 400 yards
between phones needs to be
established so students do not
have to walk more than 200
yards to find a phone.
"The purpose of having more
phones [at] residences would be

to provide a way for people to
call the police when necessary,
to call SURE Escort when they
are waiting outside by them
selves, and to make sure resi
dents don't prop open doors,"
Choo said.
Vanier also announced that
SCBN plans to televise senate
meetings next quarter, some
thing which has never been
done before.
"It will improve the level of
decorum," he said. "Some will
watch it, not a lot. Those who
are really interested will watch.
But those who are really inter
ested are the people who will
vote."
Choo said all senate meetings
should be televised, especially
those involving administrators
not normally in contact with
students.
"Certain administrators
from Housing and Dining,
members of the police depart
ment and managers of Cowell
should be accountable to the
student body. Those meetings
where they are present should
be broadcast to the student
body," he said.
