Stanford 55
Washington 50

The fifth-ranked Stanford women's basketball
team (26-2 overall, 17-1 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) waltzed its way into the Big Dance last week
end with a 55-50 victory over rival Washington (23-
8, 13-5 in the Pac-10) in front of a packed house at
Hec Edmundson Pavilion.
The Cardinal shook off its lowest point total
since the 1987-88 season and its lowest shooting
percentage of the year (32.1 percent) to pur its
ninth straight victory under its belt. Stanford com
pensated for its offensive woes with tenacious
defense that held the Huskies to only 30 percent
shooting of their own.
"I think both teams put out a great effort," said
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "Both teams played
very hard, especially the seniors including Rachel
[Hemmer], Anita [Kaplan] and Kate Paye and
[Katia] Foucade and [Rhonda] Smith for Washing
ton."
The Cardinal dispelled the skeptics that doubted
Stanford's ability to perform in close games due to
its inexperience in such matches. The five-point
margin was one of only two single-digit games in
the Cardinal's season. Stanford lost the other, a
five-point decision to Oregon State.
Stanford proved its mettle in a close game by
shutting down Washington's offense down the
stretch as the Cardinal held the Huskies scoreless
in the final two-and-a-half minutes. The Cardinal
also converted nine of its final 10 free throws,
including the last six.
