Stanford 55
Washington 50

The fifth-ranked Stanford women's basketball
team (26-2 overall, 17-1 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) waltzed its way into the Big Dance last week
end with a 55-50 victory over rival Washington (23-
8, 13-5 in the Pac-10) in front of a packed house at
Hec Edmundson Pavilion.
The Cardinal shook off its lowest point total
since the 1987-88 season and its lowest shooting
percentage of the year (32.1 percent) to pur its
ninth straight victory under its belt. Stanford com
pensated for its offensive woes with tenacious
defense that held the Huskies to only 30 percent
shooting of their own.
"I think both teams put out a great effort," said
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "Both teams played
very hard, especially the seniors including Rachel
[Hemmer], Anita [Kaplan] and Kate Paye and
[Katia] Foucade and [Rhonda] Smith for Washing
ton."
The Cardinal dispelled the skeptics that doubted
Stanford's ability to perform in close games due to
its inexperience in such matches. The five-point
margin was one of only two single-digit games in
the Cardinal's season. Stanford lost the other, a
five-point decision to Oregon State.
Stanford proved its mettle in a close game by
shutting down Washington's offense down the
stretch as the Cardinal held the Huskies scoreless
in the final two-and-a-half minutes. The Cardinal
also converted nine of its final 10 free throws,
including the last six.

Freshman Kristin Folkl comes away with the rebound
despite being mugged by OSU's Tanja Kostic.
Kristin Folkl, who was joined
on the All-Pac-10-Freshman team
by Naomi Mulitauaopele, led the
Cardinal with a career night, reg
istering her first double double
with 16 points and 10 rebounds,
both career highs. "I thought that
our advantage was Kristin at the
three [position]," said Van-
Derveer, the Pac-10 Coach of the
Year for the third time. "Her leap
ing ability is unparalleled."
Senior Anita Kaplan, who gar
nered Ail-Pac-10 honors for the
second straight year, also hauled
down 11 rebounds of her own,
leading Stanford to a 52-34
rebounding advantage. The Car
dinal now stands at 24-0 when
Stanford out-rebounds its oppo
nents.
The tremendous rebounding
margin made up for cold Cardinal
shooting, epitomized by a season
low 27.6 percent clip in the second
half and 25 total turnovers, the
most of the year.
"Whenever you play Washing
ton they basically tell you that if
you can lob the ball in, you can get
a lay-up," said VanDerveer. "But
they make those passes very
tough to complete."
The Cardinal looked up to its
old tricks early in the first half by

jumping out to early leads at 9-2
and at 17-9. However, the
Huskies clawed back into it by
halftime, entering the locker
room down by six at 28-22.
"We really hurt ourselves in
the first half when we missed five
front ends of one-and-ones, but
we were able to hit nine of 10 free
throws down the stretch includ
ing some clutch ones by Kate
Paye and Kristin," VanDerveer
said.
Despite a slow first half,
Smith, the Huskies' leading scor
er, caught fire in the second,
keeping Washington in the game
with 7-of-14 shooting for 16
points. Smith was the only player
to shoot at least 50 percent from
the field. Foucade added 10 points
of her own on a dismal 5-for-19
shooting afternoon.
All-Pac-10 sophomore Kate
Starbird led the Cardinal with
five assists in her homecoming to
Washington. "Kate Starbird hit
some big baskets for us. It was
exciting for her to come home.
She has a lot of poise," Van-
Derveer said. Starbird finished
the game with nine points.
The Cardinal ends the regular
season with momentum for the
postseason. Stanford has current
ly won nine straight, including of
a sweep of the second half of the
Pac-10 schedule, a feat the Cardi
nal accomplished for the second
straight year.
