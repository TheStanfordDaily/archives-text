Am I going to have to sell my soul to
the devil in order to beat these guys?
This thought must haunt the
minds of swimming coaches across the
nation as the No. 2 Stanford men's
swimming team prepares to embark
next week for Indianapolis for the
NCAA championships March 23 to 25.
Even favored Michigan, who fell vic

The Cardinal victory clearly shows
that the Wolverines are going to have to
do more than just show up in Indi

the Stanford squad will no longer have
the element of surprise on its side.
"The victory was good and bad," said
junior Scott Gagner. "It gave us a huge
