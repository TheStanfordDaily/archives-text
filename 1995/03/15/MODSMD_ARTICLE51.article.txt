# Men's swimmers seek fourth straight NCAA championship ring
## This time, top-ranked Michigan comes in as favorite

Am I going to have to sell my soul to
the devil in order to beat these guys?
This thought must haunt the
minds of swimming coaches across the
nation as the No. 2 Stanford men's
swimming team prepares to embark
next week for Indianapolis for the
NCAA championships March 23 to 25.
Even favored Michigan, who fell vic
tim to the Cardinal in a lopsided
defeat in January, has reason to be
worried.
Stanford has won the last three
championships and is anxious to com
pete for its fourth straight. All year, the
Cardinal has been looking forward to
this point, and they can't wait for the

excitement to start.
"Everyone's getting restless," said
senior co-captain Clay Tippins. "There
is a clock counting down until the time
bomb goes off. At this point it's just a
frenzy."
It has been a strange season for the
Cardinal. In years past, Stanford has
always been expected to win, but with
the loss of last year's great senior class,
this year has been a struggle. Stanford
was not expected to be a serious con
tender with Michigan. But things have
changed.
"Early in the season," said senior
Brian Retterer, "we wanted to be within
50 points at the end of the first day (of
NCAAs). Now we want to be ahead after
the first day, even though that's our
weakest day."

The big turning point for the Cardi
nal was a victory in January over Michi
gan. Since then, Stanford's confidence
has grown, and the squad has improved
considerably with each meet.
"Michigan has gone from a team
knowing they're going to win to having
some questions," Retterer said.
The Cardinal victory clearly shows
that the Wolverines are going to have to
do more than just show up in Indi
anapolis. However, it also means that
the Stanford squad will no longer have
the element of surprise on its side.
"The victory was good and bad," said
junior Scott Gagner. "It gave us a huge
confidence boost, but it was a wake up
call for them as well. So although it

helped us, it helped them too for
NCAAs."
A large part of the Cardinal's
newfound confidence and chang
ing expectations has been the
growth of the freshman class, a
group which is sending five swim
mers to the Big Dance.
"We really are looking to the
freshmen now more than ever for
big points," Gagner said. "At the
beginning of the year, our expecta
tions weren't as high, but they've
come through. That's part of the
reason we've risen in the rankings
and changed our expectations."
The Cardinal freshmen have
emerged this season as a force to
be reckoned with. Sabir Muham

mad stepped up with a great meet
against California, and Scott Clay
pool won the 50-yard freestyle last
week at the Pacific 10 champi
onships, gaining a No. 1 seed.
However, they must realize that
they enter next weekend with a
clean slate.
"We have to know," said head
coach Skip Kenney, "if they're
going for experience or are they
going to score points. ... We're
expecting big things. Without
them, we have no chance. Their
freshman season is over. Now it's
big time — they have to come
through."
The older swimmers are help
ing the younger ones to prepare
for the challenge and the entire
team is getting ready for a long,
painful meet.
"We tell the freshmen, 'You

haven't done anything yet,' " Tip
pins said. "*You just don't know
'til you see who shows scro' at the
big show.' I remember Pablo
[Moralesl telling me that my
freshman year."
Over the course of three gruel
ing days, the Cardinal swimmers
will swim in an extremely large
number of events, wearing them
selves down so that it will take
weeks to recover.
"I'll have 14 swims," Retterer
said. "It's really tiring and
exhausting. If it hurts, we draw
strenth from the team. I say,
'Thrive on the pain.' "
With a less dominant lineup
than in previous years, the Cardi
nal is going to have to be prepared
in order to win.
"It's not a given," Tippins said.
"We have to get our act together.

The main difference between us
winning and Michigan beating us
is we can't have any swims that
are off. We need everyone that
swims to score."
The Cardinal's ace in the hole is
its strength as a team. The Stan
ford men believe that their close
ness and chemistry enables them
to go beyond their individual abili
ties.
"Chemistry helps you get what
you had and a little more," Tippins
said. "It ensures 100 percent, and
enables 110 percent."
If Stanford uses that 110 per
cent and is in contention after the
second day of events, the team
could easily climb out of the pool
with the championship. The Car
dinal has a number of advantages
if this situation arises.
First, it is Stanford's best day of

events.
Second, the Cardinal is the
defending champion — Stanford
knows what needs to be done for
the win.
Finally, when the other individ
ual competitors are wearing down
in the final stretch, the Stanford
team will be drawing strength
from one another.
"There are three aspects of
swimming — physical, mental and
emotional," Gagner said. "Michi
gan has lots of the physical, and
perhaps some of the mental, but
what they're lacking in emotion
we pick up. And a lot of emotion
goes into it. You've got to stay up
— it's easy to get tired. Often on
the last day the only thing pulling
you through is the team. That's
what carries you through the last
lap."
