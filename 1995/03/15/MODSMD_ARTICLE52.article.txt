# Senior women can swim to perfect career
## 
### Ezra Baylin Contributing writer 
Dominance and perfection. No two
words better characterize Stanford
women's swimming in recent years.
The team has won three consecutive
national titles, nine consecutive Pacific
10 Conference crowns, and 52 dual
meets in a row, but its season still
comes down to one three-day showdown
in Texas.
The top ranked Cardinal travels to
the NCAA championship meet tomor
row to complete a dynasty and win a
fourth national title.
"We are the team that should win
the meet," said head coach Richard
Quick. "We qualified the maximum
number of swimmers, 17, and our
divers should be strong as well."
The big challenge for Stanford
should come from second-ranked Michi
gan, but poor diving performances have

haunted the Wolverines all season.
Though they qualified 17 swimmers —
matching the Cardinal's total — no
Michigan divers are scheduled to com
pete in the meet.
Essentially, Michigan will not score
any points in the three diving events so
Wolverine swimmers will have to beat
Cardinal powerhouses like senior Jenny
Thompson and sophomores Sarah
Anderson and Claudia Franco to make
up for the lost points.
However, Star ford can not take this
challenge lying down since Quick's
squad only beat Michigan by two points
earlier this year.
"Michigan is big competition. No
question about it," Quick said.
With Michigan nipping at their
heels, Cardinal swimmers are pulling
together to ensure that no one surpris
es them in Texas. Barring any big
bombshells, two-time Olympic champi
on Thompson would have taken the 50-

yard freestyle, but she chose to swim
the 200-yard individual medley because
her team needs a strong performance
there.
Thompson will face the defending
NCAA and world champion in the 200
individual medley, but Quick believes
that his star swimmer will step up.
"Jenny Thompson is the main per
son our team hangs their hats on,"
Quick said. "She responds to any chal
lenge we ask of her, and I think the 200
IM will be the best matchup in the
meet. Jenny's contributions just seem
to make a big difference in our team's
psyche."
Other athletes to watch this weekend
include senior diver Eileen Richetelli.
Richetelli sat out last season with a
back injury, but she has earned NCAA
Diver of the Year honors twice.
Though Richetelli had some tough

onships this weekend in Houston
dual meets this year, her perfor
mance in championship meets
has been extraordinary. The top
individual point scorer at the
Pac-10 meet last month,
Richetelli is a big meet per
former, and the Cardinal needs
her to rise to the occasion in
Austin.
Newcomers will also con
tribute to the Cardinal's potent
arsenal. Franco, a transfer from
Florida, is second only to
Thompson in the sprint free
events. Franco won the 50-yard
free at the Pac-10 champi
onships and was a member of all

four conference-champion relay
squads.
Stanford's freshmen also look
to make a big impact at the
meet. Lindsay Gassner and
Becky Bicknell round out one of
the strongest sprint free attacks
in the country.
"With the sprint free so
important in intercollegiate
swimming, it is a comfort to
know that we have eight quality
sprint free people," Quick said.
"The depth in our sprint free
program is the best I have ever
seen as a coach."
Though first-year talent
should contribute substantially
this weekend, Stanford's seniors
represent the core of the team.
Co-captains Becky Crowe and
Kendra Thayer, along with

Thompson and Julie Kole, have
never lost a meet in their tenure
as Stanford swimmers.
In fact, these seniors have
won 27 dual meets, four Pac-10
titles, and three national cham
pionships. With a win in Texas,
they will be the only athletes on
campus to close their careers
without losing a competition.
Though the rest of the swim
ming world is watching Stan
ford's unprecedented winning
streak, it is not an issue for the
team.
"This team is not affected by
streaks," Quick said. "They have
got to perform for three days
and they know they can't let up.
If we go out and take care of
business, we should win the
meet."
