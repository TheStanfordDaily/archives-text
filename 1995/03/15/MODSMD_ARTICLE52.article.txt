# Senior women can swim to perfect career

Dominance and perfection. No two
words better characterize Stanford
women's swimming in recent years.
The team has won three consecutive
national titles, nine consecutive Pacific
10 Conference crowns, and 52 dual
meets in a row, but its season still
comes down to one three-day showdown
in Texas.
The top ranked Cardinal travels to
the NCAA championship meet tomor
row to complete a dynasty and win a
fourth national title.
"We are the team that should win
the meet," said head coach Richard
Quick. "We qualified the maximum
number of swimmers, 17, and our
divers should be strong as well."
The big challenge for Stanford
should come from second-ranked Michi
gan, but poor diving performances have

haunted the Wolverines all season.
Though they qualified 17 swimmers —
matching the Cardinal's total — no
Michigan divers are scheduled to com
pete in the meet.
Essentially, Michigan will not score
any points in the three diving events so
Wolverine swimmers will have to beat
Cardinal powerhouses like senior Jenny
Thompson and sophomores Sarah
Anderson and Claudia Franco to make
up for the lost points.
However, Star ford can not take this
challenge lying down since Quick's
squad only beat Michigan by two points
earlier this year.
"Michigan is big competition. No
question about it," Quick said.
With Michigan nipping at their
heels, Cardinal swimmers are pulling
together to ensure that no one surpris
es them in Texas. Barring any big
bombshells, two-time Olympic champi
on Thompson would have taken the 50-

yard freestyle, but she chose to swim
the 200-yard individual medley because
her team needs a strong performance
there.
Thompson will face the defending
NCAA and world champion in the 200
individual medley, but Quick believes
that his star swimmer will step up.
"Jenny Thompson is the main per
son our team hangs their hats on,"
Quick said. "She responds to any chal
lenge we ask of her, and I think the 200
IM will be the best matchup in the
meet. Jenny's contributions just seem
to make a big difference in our team's
psyche."
Other athletes to watch this weekend
include senior diver Eileen Richetelli.
Richetelli sat out last season with a
back injury, but she has earned NCAA
Diver of the Year honors twice.
Though Richetelli had some tough
