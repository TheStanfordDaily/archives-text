# Fencers head off to NCAAs

Most Stanford students are spending this week
preparing for next week's final exams. On Friday,
March 24, a collective sigh of relief will be heard all
over campus as spring break arrives. For six members
of the Stanford men's and women's fencing teams,
however, the real test begins the very next day.
Cardinal jousters will celebrate the end of winter
quarter by competing against the best fencers in the
nation at the NCAA tournament. Held on the campus
of Notre Dame, the tournament will offer each Stan
ford fencer an opportunity to bring home an individual
national title.
Stanford's best opportunity for a national champi
onship rests with freshman Sean McClain, a candidate
to win the NCAA title in men's foil. McClain is cur
rently competing in Argentina at the Pan American
Games as part of the United States national team.
"Sean will win the [NCAA title] in men's foil. No one
at the collegiate level is as good as him," said men's
coach Zoran Tulum.
The fencer with the highest hopes of upsetting
McClain may also fence for Stanford. Cardinal senior
Geoff Donaker is coming off a first-place finish at last
weekend's Western Regional Tournament at Long
Beach State. Donaker, who went undefeated during the
tournament, dealt McClain his only loss en route to
claiming the title.
"[The match against] Sean was a big win for Geoff,"
Tulum said. "It increased his confi
dence a great deal. He could do very
well at nationals."
In men's epee, senior Doug Van
derbilt will represent Stanford.
Vanderbilt hopes to rebound from a
disappointing sixth-place finish at
Western Regionals. The epee spe
cialist managed to qualify for the
tournament by virtue of his success
at prior events, but he will need to
return to mid-season form to avoid
the losses that plagued him last
weekend.
The tournament's round robin
format could prove advantageous
to Vanderbilt and the other Cardi
nal hopefuls. Rather than using
elimination bouts, each fencer
fences every other fencer in his or
her division. At the end of the day,
the fencer with the best record
takes home the trophy.
"With the round robin, one fluke
loss like those that hurt Doug [last
week] won't kill you. Still, you need
to be consistent to win," Tulum
said.
The final men's representative
is junior Ed Jen, a saber standout
who finished third at Western
Regionals. Junior Errol Hunter fin
ished sixth at the tournament and
is still waiting to see if he will
receive an at-large bid to nationals
from committee made up of coach
es from around the nation.
The women's team is led by
junior epee specialists Morgan
Hoch and Stephanie Wien. Wien
took second at the Long Beach
tournament, losing only once dur
ing the weekend. Hoch, expected to
win the tournament, finished a dis
appointing fourth and is deter
mined to improve her showing at
Notre Dame.
Despite her recent woes, Hoch is
a candidate to win the national epee
title. At a mid-season tournament
at Duke, Hoch went 14-2 against
the best competition in the country.
Also waiting on an at-large bid is
senior foil specialist Michelle But
ler, who missed a chance to qualify
at Regionals by one touch scored
against her with three seconds left
in her final match.
As a team, Stanford struggled
against national powerhouse Notre
Dame at the Duke tournament ear
lier in the year. With another
month of preparation, the team
hopes to finish the quarter by pass
ing the ultimate test.
