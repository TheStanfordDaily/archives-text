Round one goes to the Cardi
nal.
In what promised to be a pre
view of the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division race, the
14th-ranked Stanford baseball
team got the early advantage
over No. 7 USC. The Cardinal
(14-11 overall, 5-3 in the Six-
Pac) took two of three from the
Trojans (16-10, 3-3 in the Six-
Pac) in a weekend series
squeezed in between the rain in
Los Angeles.
The top two teams in the Six-
Pac split a doubleheader on Sun
day before Stanford, behind
freshman pitcher Kyle Peterson,
pounded USC 9-1 in the rubber
game at Dedeaux Field.
"USC has some great hitters

and if you make a mistake they'll
really make you pay for it,"
Peterson told KZSU. "This was
definitely a big [series! "win for
us."
Peterson (4-1) shut down the
powerful Trojan offense on Mon
day while Cardinal bats scored
eight runs in the fifth and sixth
innings to capture the series
finale. Stanford trailed 1-0 enter
ing the fifth before breaking the
game open.
Freshman center fielder Joe
Kilburg led off the inning with a
single before Ben Tucker, the
Trojans' starter, walked three of
the next four batters to tie the
game at one. Designated hitter
Jon Schaeffer, another fresh
man, cleared the bases with a
double before coming around to
score on a throwing error to give

Freshman pitcher Kyle Peterson picked up his fourth win of the season against
seventh-ranked USC on Monday. The Cardinal won two of three games to grab
an early lead on its Six-Pac rivals.
the Cardinal a 5-1 advantage.
Stanford added three more runs
in the sixth on a two run single by
junior third baseman Steve Carver
and another Schaeffer RBI single.
SchaefTer had his best day in his
college career on Monday, going 3-
for-4 with four RBIs.
"I knew that with Peterson on
the mound we had a good shot to
win the game," SchaefTer said. "I
was just trying to hit the ball hard
and get something going."
That run support was more than
enough for Peterson, who rebound
ed from his first loss of the year last
week against Nevada with a com
plete game performance. Peterson
scattered just six USC hits while
striking out five to notch his third
complete game win of the year.
"I was able to get my curve ball
over for strikes and that helped a
lot," Peterson said. "It set up a lot
of my other pitches and made the
day a lot easier."
The Cardinal also rallied from a
three-run deficit to capture the
front end of the doubleheader on
Sunday afternoon 5-4. Stanford
scored three runs in the fifth inning
to tie the game before adding the
lead run in the sixth to capture the
victory.
The Cardinal entered the top of
the fifth trailing the Trojans 4-1
but strung together three straight

base hits to climb back into the
game. Junior right fielder Brodie
VanWagenen led things off with an
infield single to third. VanWagenen
had three hits in the series opener.
Sophomore shortstop Eric Sees
followed with another infield single
before Kilburg was hit by a pitch to
load the bases with nobody out for
junior left fielder Cale Carter.
Carter did not disappoint, lining a
double off the outfield wall to close
the gap to 4-3.
A groundout from junior catcher
A.J. Hinch knotted the game at
four before Stanford moved in
front in the top of the sixth with the
help of a USC defensive miscue.
With the bases loaded and two
outs, Trojan Ail-American short
stop Gabe Alvarez couldn't field a
ground ball from Hinch and Van-
Wagenen came across the plate
with the Cardinal's lead run.
Junior lefty Dan Reed (3-2) did
all the work from there, retiring 15
of the last 17 Trojans he faced.
Reed worked his second consecu
tive complete game, scattering
eight hits while striking out four to
pick up the victory.
"I had some relatives in the
stands and I was glad they saw me
play," Schaeffer said. "It feels good
to come down to LA and play well
and have the team play well."
USC came right back in the sec
ond half of the twinbill with a little
bit of spectacular pitching of its
own to upend the Cardinal 5-1.
Trojan left-hander Randy Flores
(4-2) outdueled Stanford's Jason

Middlebrook (0-5) in a battle of
sophomore sensations. Middle
brook, who seemed in control
despite allowing four runs in seven
and-a-third innings pitched,
couldn't break out of his season
long slump.
And Cardinal hitters didn't give
him much help, managing just six
hits — five of them singles — and
no walks as Flores dominated.
USC's offensive attack was led
by center fielder Walter Dawkins,
who went 3-for-4 in the game with
two doubles and a triple. The Tro
jans gave Flores all the run support
he would need in the bottom of the
third, jumping out to a 2-0 lead
with a two-out rally.
Stanford cut the lead to 2-1 but
the Trojans put the game away
with a run in the sixth and two
more insurance runs in the bottom
of the eighth.
The Cardinal will not take the
field again until spring break, when
Arizona State travels to Sunken
Diamond for a three-game set
beginning Saturday, March 25 at 1
p.m.. The Sunday and Monday
match-ups will also be at 1 p.m.
Stanford then travels east to
face Big West power Nevada on
Tuesday, March 28 at 2 p.m.,
before heading to Arizona for a Fri
day-Sunday series against the
Wildcats. The March 31 and April 1
contests will be under the lights at
6 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, while
the April 2 finale is slated for a 1
p.m. PDT (set forward the clocks)
first pitch.
