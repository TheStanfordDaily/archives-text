Southern Division race, the

squeezed in between the rain in
Los Angeles.
The top two teams in the Six-
Pac split a doubleheader on Sun
day before Stanford, behind
freshman pitcher Kyle Peterson,
pounded USC 9-1 in the rubber
game at Dedeaux Field.
"USC has some great hitters

and if you make a mistake they'll
really make you pay for it,"
Peterson told KZSU. "This was
definitely a big [series! "win for
us."
Peterson (4-1) shut down the
powerful Trojan offense on Mon
day while Cardinal bats scored
eight runs in the fifth and sixth
innings to capture the series
finale. Stanford trailed 1-0 enter

game open.
Freshman center fielder Joe
Kilburg led off the inning with a
single before Ben Tucker, the
Trojans' starter, walked three of
the next four batters to tie the
game at one. Designated hitter
Jon Schaeffer, another fresh
man, cleared the bases with a
double before coming around to
score on a throwing error to give
