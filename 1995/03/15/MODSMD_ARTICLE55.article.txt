# No. 9 gymnasts come back
## Distracted Stanford team still wins fight with Illini 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
Going into Saturday's men's gymnastics meet
against No. 10 Illinois, the Stanford gymnasts had a
single goal â€” to post a score above 230. They fell one
gymnast short of attaining it.
Without freshman Tim Dalrymple, who suffered
a first degree concussion during the warm-up, the
ninth-ranked Cardinal overcame a rough start to
sweep past the Illini 227.20 to 225.475. In the all
around, senior national team member Josh Stein
took the individual title with a 56.30.
"It was just one of those nights," said freshman
Clarence Miao. "We were able to win, but with Tim's
injury and our lack of consistency we just weren't
completely at our best.
"It wasn't that important for us to beat Illinois,"
Miao continued. "The score was more important and
a high score could have been a real confidence boost
ft
er.
Much of the inconsistency that plagued the Car
dinal could be attributed to fatigue. With finals fast
approaching, all of the gymnasts find their atten
tions divided and their time limited.
"With Dead Week and finals coming, it's very dif
ficult for the guys to stay focused," said head coach
Sadao Hamada.
Despite the team's disappointment over the
results, the low point of the evening was clearly the
injury during warm-ups. In what was one of the
scariest moments of the season, Dalrymple injured
himself while warming up for the floor exercise.
Unable to complete a double full, which entails a
flip with two twists, the freshman landed on his
head and neck and was taken to the emergency
room. Fortunately, the concussion was mild and
Dalrymple was released the same evening.
"It was a big letdown to lose him," Hamada said,
"but the important thing is that Tim's OK."
The loss of Dalrymple was key for the Cardinal.
One of the squad's top specialists, Dalrymple has
worked hard to succeed at the level that he did in the
junior division of the sport, where he finished sec
ond in the nation last year.
"We basically had a 230-point performance if Tim
had been with us," Hamada said. "The replacement
guys were strong and they really showed our depth,
but it was really hard for them to focus after Tim got
hurt.
"It was kind of good that we didn't get it though,"
Hamada said. "The guys are disappointed and that
should keep them from slacking off."
Dalrymple's events were split between Miao and
fellow freshman Gabe Edelman. "Clarence really

showed a lot of poise," Hamada said. "He really did
great on the pommel horse."
Miao was not alone in performing well. In a meet
where the team was less than satisfied with its
effort, the few bright spots included juniors Peter
Hegi and Andrew Manson who continued to move
closer to top form as they recover from injuries. In
addition, senior Evan Wells marked his final home
appearance by showing well in all his events and
winning the team's MVP award.
"I finally hit my sets," Wells said. "I hadn't done
that in any of the previous competitions."
Sophomore national team member Jamie Ellis
also continued to look sharp, finishing just one
tenth of a point off the pace in the all-around, even


Junior Andrew Manson turns the world upside
down at Saturday's meet against Illinois.
