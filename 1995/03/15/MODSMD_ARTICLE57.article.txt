# Double trouble befalls softball
## Sonoma State holds Cardinal to just three runs

Stanford 2 1

Continuing a season-long pat
tern in which the team plays well
but fails to win close games, the
Stanford softball squad dropped
both games of a doubleheader to
Sonoma State on Sunday at El
Camino Field. Stanford lost the
opener 3-2 in 11 innings, and
Sonoma State took the second
contest 4-1.
In another developing pattern,
the Stanford offense hit the ball
well but couldn't score enough
runs. In game one, the Cardinal
collected seven hits. The team
failed to score, however, until the
10th inning of play. Likewise, the
offense managed only one run on
five hits in the nightcap.
Game one was a classic pitch
er's duel, as neither team could
score through seven innings of
regulation play. After two extra

innings without either team
crossing the plate, the interna
tional tie-breaker began in the top
of the tenth.
Under international rules,
each team begins its turn at bat
with a runner at second base.
Sonoma State took advantage of
the situation, scoring one
unearned run in its half of the
10th inning. Stanford (8-10)
matched the Cossacks with a run
in the bottom of the 10th on an
RBI single by hot-hitting junior
Amanda Renteria, who extended
her hitting streak to seven games.
In the second inning of the
tiebreaker, the Cossacks scored
two more unearned runs. In the
home half of the inning, the Car
dinal scored one run before load
ing the bases. Stanford was
unable to push a run across, how
ever, losing a heartbreaker by one
run.
"We're making great [individu
al] plays, but we're not making
the plays we need to win," Stan
ford Coach Sandy Pearce said.
"Three unearned runs just kills
us. We don't score enough runs to
allow that."
Freshman phenom Jessica

Schulman (5-5) took the loss for
Stanford despite pitching bril
liantly. Schulman scattered six
hits in 11 innings of work while
not allowing an unearned run.
"For maybe the first time all
season, I was really happy with
the way I pitched," Schulman
said. "We just didn't capitalize on
some opportunities we had, par
ticularly at the [plate]. We [also]
made a couple of [costly] mistakes
at the end."
Poor defense continues to
plague the Cardinal. The two
errors in the opening game fol
lowed an eight-error showing in a
doubleheader against Loyola
Marymount last week. Stanford's
inability to consistently score
runs magnified the significance of
each unearned run.
"A lot of [our problems are]
because we're a young team,"
Pearce said. "Most of the mis
takes are mental rather than
physical! The team just needs to
improve its mental toughness,
and that comes with experience."
Game two opened with Sono
ma State jumping out to a 2-0 lead
in the top of the first inning. Con
tinuing to show the resilience
that has characterized the young
team, the Cardinal bounced back
with a run in the bottom of the
inning. As she has done all year
long, sophomore shortstop Sum
mer Lee ignited the rally, getting
on base and scoring Stanford's
only run.
Stanford was unable to sustain
the rally, however, as the Cos
sacks came right back to score a
run in the top of the second.
Sonoma State extended the mar
gin to 4-1 in the top of the fifth,
and pitcher Cecilia Villegas
improved to 4-1 on the year by
silencing the Cardinal bats the
rest of the way.
Schulman again took the loss
for the Cardinal, pitching both
ends of a doubleheader (a com
mon feat for most big-time college
pitchers) for the first time in her
Stanford career.
"The second game was a whole
different story [than the first],"

Schulman said. "After losing the
first game the way we did, after
battling and battling, we kind of
had a mental breakdown. It took
a lot out of us and we just didn't
play as well."
Coach Pearce echoed her
pitcher's concerns.
"We're playing OK as a team,
but we need to make more plays
at the end of the game when we
really need them. We really need
ed to get [a couple of] wins before
[Pacific 10 Conference] play heats
up. It will be tough to go into con
ference action with these two
losses on our minds."
The Cardinal makes up a post
poned doubleheader against St.
Mary's on March 28 before begin
ning a long stretch of Pac-10
games with a home doubleheader
against Washington on March 30.
"I'm pretty excited about [Pac
-10 play]," Schulman said. "No
one expects us to beat anybody, so
we can look at it one of two ways.
We can either come out and play
tough or we can play like we
expect to lose. I think we'll come
out and play hard. [The tough
competition] will build a lot of
character."
