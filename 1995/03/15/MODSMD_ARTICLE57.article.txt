# Double trouble befalls softball
## Sonoma State holds Cardinal to just three runs

Stanford 2 1

Continuing a season-long pat
tern in which the team plays well
but fails to win close games, the
Stanford softball squad dropped
both games of a doubleheader to
Sonoma State on Sunday at El
Camino Field. Stanford lost the
opener 3-2 in 11 innings, and
Sonoma State took the second
contest 4-1.
In another developing pattern,
the Stanford offense hit the ball
well but couldn't score enough
runs. In game one, the Cardinal
collected seven hits. The team
failed to score, however, until the
10th inning of play. Likewise, the
offense managed only one run on
five hits in the nightcap.
Game one was a classic pitch
er's duel, as neither team could
score through seven innings of
regulation play. After two extra

innings without either team
crossing the plate, the interna
tional tie-breaker began in the top
of the tenth.
Under international rules,
each team begins its turn at bat
with a runner at second base.
Sonoma State took advantage of
the situation, scoring one
unearned run in its half of the
10th inning. Stanford (8-10)
matched the Cossacks with a run
in the bottom of the 10th on an
RBI single by hot-hitting junior
Amanda Renteria, who extended
her hitting streak to seven games.
In the second inning of the
tiebreaker, the Cossacks scored
two more unearned runs. In the
home half of the inning, the Car
dinal scored one run before load
ing the bases. Stanford was
unable to push a run across, how
ever, losing a heartbreaker by one
run.
"We're making great [individu
al] plays, but we're not making
the plays we need to win," Stan
ford Coach Sandy Pearce said.
"Three unearned runs just kills
us. We don't score enough runs to
allow that."
Freshman phenom Jessica

Schulman (5-5) took the loss for
Stanford despite pitching bril
liantly. Schulman scattered six
hits in 11 innings of work while
not allowing an unearned run.
"For maybe the first time all
season, I was really happy with
the way I pitched," Schulman
said. "We just didn't capitalize on
some opportunities we had, par
ticularly at the [plate]. We [also]
made a couple of [costly] mistakes
at the end."
Poor defense continues to
plague the Cardinal. The two
errors in the opening game fol
lowed an eight-error showing in a
doubleheader against Loyola
Marymount last week. Stanford's
inability to consistently score
runs magnified the significance of
each unearned run.
"A lot of [our problems are]
because we're a young team,"
Pearce said. "Most of the mis
takes are mental rather than
physical! The team just needs to
improve its mental toughness,
and that comes with experience."
