As heavy showers pelted UCLA's Wooden Cen
ter last Friday night, the No. 1 Bruins rained out
third-ranked Stanford men's volleyball team in
three straight games (15-7, 15-9, 15-10). However,
the storm clouds and Stanford's ill fortune cleared
the next night as the Cardinal clobbered No. 12 UC-
Irvine 15-9, 15-12, 13-15, 15-10.
Stanford (11-3, 8-3 in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) kept up with the Bruins (16-1,
12-0 in the MPSF) well at the beginning of the
heated match, with both sides scoring points quick
ly. Junior swing hitter Mike Lambert emerged as
the Cardinal's hot player, putting balls away from
all angles and ending with 24 kills and a .410 hit
ting percentage. However, UCLA's jump servers
started teeing off from the service line and Stanford
lost its composure. Bruin swing hitter Kevin Wong
did irreparable damage and served out the first
game in a hurry.
"They seem to have a hard time passing with
[sophomore opposite hitter] Brian Moore in," Wong
said. "But, we came out really fired up and we
served tough for the win."
The Cardinal went away from its tall lineup by
sterling freshman swing hitter Tad Hoffman for
Moore in game two. The improved passing expected
from this move did not materialize as the Bruins
continued to barrage Stanford. Setter Stein Met
zger, middle blocker Jeff Nygaard and back-row
specialist Trong Nguyen joined Wong*s assault.
UCLA displayed tenacious defense and a well
greased offensive machine, hitting .405 as a team.
Stanford's inability to slow down the Bruin attack
was partly due to the surprising number of combi
nation plays UCLA ran, instead of setting its quick
hitters. Opposite hitter Paul Nihipali dominated
with 24 kills and an impressive .556 hitting per
centage. The Cardinal hit only a subpar .294 and
could not convert on its opportunities — a big
comeback in game three fizzled quickly.
"Our problems began with the jump serve,"
Coach Ruben Nieves said. "But as the match pro
gressed, they outplayed us in several areas. There
were too many hitting errors and the ball control
just wasn't good enough."
Considering the wealth of talent Stanford has,
middle blocker Michael Hoefer cites mental reasons
as a key to the loss.
"I just think lots of us were really nervous," Hoe
fer said. "They were good, but we didn't play our
best."
The Cardinal steeled itself after this setback and
adjusted its attitude to face the Anteaters Saturday
night. "We came in with the right mental frame of
mind," Nieves said. "We mentally prepared our
selves for a battle."
