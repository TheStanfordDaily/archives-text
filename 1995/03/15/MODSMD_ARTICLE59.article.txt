# Jackson and Aguirre remain friends through the battle
## Despite four-year contest for 134-1b. slot 
### Ratha Harntha Staff writer 
When a bull and a cat constant
ly battle for territory, they usually
don't end up as the best of friends.
But after a four-year struggle
between Jay Jackson and Jimmy
Aguirre for the 134-pound starting
position on the Stanford wrestling
team, the results have not been the
usual.
When the bull attacks, it over
powers its prey using a brute phys
ical style. The cat relies on its
quickness and strategy. Jackson's
bull and Aguirre's cat are a con
trast in wrestling styles, but they
have managed to make the transi
tion from rivals on the mat to
friends off of it.
Wrestling, a combat sport, is
very different psychologically to
other sports, according to wrestling
head coach Chris Horpel. Typical
ly, athletes make their opponents
the enemy both on and off the mat.
That is what makes Jackson and
Aguirre's relationship so unique.
"It's not in our nature to turn
our opponent into an enemy,"
Aguirre said. "We talked more
about competing for a spot."
"Jimmy's one of my best friends
here at Stanford," said Jackson. "I
don't think a spot on the team can
change that."
Although they have completely
different wrestling styles, they are
very hard to separate away from

the mat. In their four years togeth
er at Stanford, they have roomed
together, shared the captain's role
the last two years and joined the
same fraternity. Both have also
developed a deep devotion to
Catholicism.
Their relationship began five
years ago when, as a freshman,
Jackson hosted Aguirre on a
recruiting trip. At the time, Jack
son, who had entered the Stanford
program as the Washington state
champion, was the starter at 126
pounds.
The next year, Aguirre joined
the team, entering as one of the
nation's top recruits. He won the
California State title three years in
a row and was the junior national
champion his senior year in high
school. Expecting to start immedi
ately, Aguirre lost challenge
matches to Dave Norwick for the
126-pound spot and Jackson for
the 134-pound spot and found him
self out of the starting lineup.
"That hit my ego pretty good,"
Aguirre said. "That's college
wrestling. They forget who you
were [in high schooll. I was taught
humility."
In their first, year together,
Jackson started at 134 pounds and
Horpel convinced Aguirre to red
shirt his freshman year so that he
could concentrate on being more
physical. The following year, in the
1992-93 season, Jackson redshirt
ed to give himself five years to

develop as a college wrestler and
Aguirre obtained the 134-pound
spot.
"I talked to a lot of coaches and
they said redshirting junior year is
the best time to do it," Jackson
said. "And with Jimmy [taking the
spot], there was no drop-off [in the
talent level]."
Aguirre began the year slowly
but came on strong at the end of
the year. At the Pacific 10 Confer
ence championships in 1993,
Aguirre won the 134-pound divi
sion and was named the tourna
ment's Outstanding Wrestler. He
went on to place 13th at the NCAA
championships.
The next year, Horpel wanted
Aguirre to move up to 142 pounds
and keep Jackson at 134 because
Aguirre is taller and has a bigger
frame. Aguirre had mixed results
at this higher weight. He built up
his weight to 150 pounds but was
still overpowered by 142-pounders.
As the year progressed, Aguirre cut
back down to 134 pounds.
Eventually, the time came for
Aguirre and Jackson to battle it out
for the 134-pound spot at the Pac
-10 championships. However,
Aguirre developed a herniated disk
in his neck, ending his season.
Jackson placed fourth at the Pac
-10 championships and took ninth
in his first appearance in the
NCAA tournament.
This season, an injury or an ill
ness has always prevented the two

athletes from wrestling each other.
During the first half of the year,
Aguirre could not compete because
his neck had not fully healed yet
and Jackson wrestled at 134
pounds. Aguirre returned to com
petition at the Country Classic
Open on Jan. 8 where Jackson won

the tournament and Aguirre fin
ished second. The two did not wres
tle because Aguirre felt he was not
at 100 percent and he forfeited the
final.
On Jan. 14, Aguirre won the
Aggie Open but again avoided a
match with Jackson, who was

upset in the semifinals and placed
fourth. Horpel then decided to go
with Aguirre at 134 pounds and
Jackson at 142 pounds for strength
in the dual meets.

mat, despite the fact that they have constantly competed for the same spot in the lineup.
