# Administrators discuss Native American issues
## Stanford leads colleges with 88% retention 
### Martin L. Yeung Contributing writer 
Last week in Santa Fe, N.M., adminis
trators from 53 colleges and universities
from across the nation discussed issues
surrounding recruitment and retention of
Native American students.
Stanford led the way.
Stanford and Dartmouth College lead the
nation in retention rates with 88 percent of
Native American students returning for a
second year, according to Benny Shendo, as
sociate director for Stanford's American In
dian Program Office. Most other schools
lose more than 50 percent of Native Ameri
can students by the end of the first year.
"The effort to recruit a student does not
end with just bringing a student to cam
pus," Shendo said. "Stanford has led the
way in developing support and networking

programs for Native (American) students
who come from a variety of backgrounds,
whether the students are from urban
(areas), rural (areas) or the reservations."
Shendo said one reason for Stanford's suc
cessful retention rates is the three-week
orientation program the Native American
Cultural Center runs for incoming stu
dents.
"The American Indian Summer Immer
sion Program was designed to smooth the
transition from the student's old environ
ment to the academic rigors of Stanford,"
Shendo said. "We try to create a strong
sense of community before everyone ar
rives, and it has been very successful."
Shendo said the support programs suc
cess is evident in the retention rates.
