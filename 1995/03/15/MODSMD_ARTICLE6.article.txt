# Administrators discuss Native American issues
## Stanford leads colleges with 88% retention 
### Martin L. Yeung Contributing writer 
Last week in Santa Fe, N.M., adminis
trators from 53 colleges and universities
from across the nation discussed issues
surrounding recruitment and retention of
Native American students.
Stanford led the way.
Stanford and Dartmouth College lead the
nation in retention rates with 88 percent of
Native American students returning for a
second year, according to Benny Shendo, as
sociate director for Stanford's American In
dian Program Office. Most other schools
lose more than 50 percent of Native Ameri
can students by the end of the first year.
"The effort to recruit a student does not
end with just bringing a student to cam
pus," Shendo said. "Stanford has led the
way in developing support and networking

programs for Native (American) students
who come from a variety of backgrounds,
whether the students are from urban
(areas), rural (areas) or the reservations."
Shendo said one reason for Stanford's suc
cessful retention rates is the three-week
orientation program the Native American
Cultural Center runs for incoming stu
dents.
"The American Indian Summer Immer
sion Program was designed to smooth the
transition from the student's old environ
ment to the academic rigors of Stanford,"
Shendo said. "We try to create a strong
sense of community before everyone ar
rives, and it has been very successful."
Shendo said the support programs suc
cess is evident in the retention rates.
Denni Woodward, assistant director for
the American Indian Program
Office, said the conference was not
centered on Stanford's programs.
The conference was more a chance
to exchange ideas and explore pro
grams that worked.
"This is not to say that our pro
gram could fit in anywhere, but it
is certainly helpful to look at what
we're doing right. I'm not trying to
be boastful, but when you've got
near 90 percent retention rates,
something must be clicking," she
said.
Shendo said he was thankful
Stanford had taken a "long-term"
view of support programs by not
significantly cutting their funding.
"I'm glad that Stanford has not
chosen to consolidate our ethnic
program ... to save money,"
Shendo said. "Ours is a small
department, and because our pro
gram is held up as one of the mod
els, any cuts would have effects
that would hurt students across
the nation."
Last fall quarter, the Universi
ty granted $200,000 to the four
ethnic centers for additional pro
gramming. The Native American
center is planning to use part of
the funding for a college exchange
program with Dartmouth College.
Shendo said the program would
allow undergraduate and graduate
students to take classes at Dart
mouth.
"Dartmouth has a Native
(American) Studies Program
whereas we do not," Shendo said.
"This exchange would allow our
students (interested) in Native
(American) studies to take courses
that they would normally not have
the opportunity to take here."
Not only would the program
benefit students academically,
Shendo said, but it would allow
students to experience the aca
demic atmospheres on both coasts.
Shendo also said that Dart
mouth students, because of the
lack of graduate schools there,
could benefit from the Universi
ty's strong graduate programs.
"Basically, we are in the final
stages of planning the program,"
Shendo said.
He added that he anticipates
the program will begin some time
next year.
