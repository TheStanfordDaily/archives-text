# Four NCAA qualifiers ready to face the music at No. 1 Iowa
## 
### Ratha Harntha Staff writer 
Stanford wrestling head coach Chris Horpel decid
ed to turn up the music this week as his team prepares
for the NCAA championships that begin tomorrow.
With the Cardinal facing packed, boisterous crowds
in lowa, Horpel tried to simulate the competition's
atmosphere by blasting music at his athletes, having
teammates heckle the four qualifiers and acting as the
bad referee.
"I don't want anything to bother them [in lowa],"
Horpel said.
This could be the last time lowa head coach Dan
Gable will ever coach his team at an NCAA champi
onship in his home stadium. Consequently, every ses
sion has sold out. Also, No. 1 lowa qualified all 10 of

its wrestlers.
The Hawkeyes are the favorite and may set a
record for points scored at the tournament, according
to Horpel. "Everyone else will be battling for second,"
he said.
The Cardinal qualified four athletes, senior Jay
Jackson and juniors Jimmy Aguirre, Matt Cano and
Tod Surmon, for tomorrow's tournament. Junior
Sahlan Martin is the Pacific 10 Conference's first
alternate. If any one of the 38 Pac-10 qualifiers are
unable to compete, Martin will take his place.
"All of us who are competing could easily be Ail-
Americans," Surmon said.
To receive All-America honors, a wrestler must fin
ish in the top eight in his weight division. The ninth
through 12th place athletes receive honorable men
tion.

"I'm feeling great," said Surmon, who finished
13th at the NCAAs last year. "I'm going there with
the intent to win it all. I think I can beat anyone."
The 150-pound Surmon, who is 16-4 this season
and placed second at the Pac-10 championships on
Feb. 24 and 25, has the best chance of the four Cardi
nal qualifiers to win his division, according to Horpel.
"Tod Surmon has upset some highly ranked
wrestlers," Horpel added. "It'll be very difficult to do,
but he probably has the best shot [to win|."
Co-captains Aguirre and Jackson, like Surmon,
will also be making their second trip to the NCAA
championship.
Aguirre went two years ago as a freshman, placing
13th in the 134-pound division. He missed last year's
competition because of a herniated disc in his neck.
Jackson, who took third at the Pac-10 tournament,

finished ninth last year.
"Ideally, I'll come out [with All-America honors],"
Aguirre said. "I went back with the team last year and
it made me very hungry."
"Having experience is very helpful," Jackson said.
"This is my last chance at this. I want to be an All-
American."
Cano is the only one of the four never to compete in
the NCAAs. The junior, who placed fourth at the Pac
-10 at 126 lbs., is second on the team with his 24-11
record. "I'm excited," Cano said. "I feel better now
than I have all season. I have wrestled in national
tournaments before. I'm prepared to wrestle in front
of a lot of fans."
Last year, the Cardinal only qualified two
wrestlers, Jackson and Surmon. Stanford placed 56th
out of 80 teams.
