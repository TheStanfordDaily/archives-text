# Track generates eight All-Americans
## NCAAs close indoor season 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
On a weekend when most eyes were watching
NCAA basketball selections, a small group from
the Stanford track team went to Indianapolis for
the NCAA Indoor Championships.
The young women's team produced five All
American performances. The distance medley
relay of junior co-captain Dena Dey, freshmen
Tyra Holt and Sarna Renfro and sophomore
Monal Chokshi finished sixth in a time of 11 min
utes, 25.82 seconds in a crowded field where five
seconds separated third and sixth place.
"We have come a long way at the NCAAs," said
head coach Vin Lananna. "You can't sneak by in
the NCAA, you have to step it up a notch and I
think our athletes took a step closer this week
end."
In the 5,000 meters freshman Kortney Dun
scombe ran a gutsy race to take seventh place in
16:17 just a few seconds shy of the Stanford fresh
man record. The race was Dunscombe's second
indoor race ever.
For the men's team senior co-captain Dave
Popejoy demonstrated his leadership by example
in the 35-pound weight by throwing 66-2'/i for sev
enth place. Sophomore Pete Swanson finished
eighth in the weight and fourth in the shot put
with a 59-IIV* toss.
"The striking thing is looking back at Stanford
teams in the past, eight All-American perfor

mances in one meet is a telling sign of how our
teams have improved," Dey said.
The team now undergoes the transition from
the indoor season to the outdoor season with a
series of meets in the next few weeks. This Satur
day, Lananna will send a group of mostly sprinters
and field event athletes to the Mustang Invitation
al at Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo. The Stanford team
soundly defeated the Mustangs at a triangular
meet at Fresno State two weeks ago.
Former Stanford head coach Brooks Johnson
directs the Cal Poly-SLO program and was philo
sophical about his team's future.
"The [Fresno State] meet was a good chance to
see how far we've come and how far we have to
go," Johnson said. "We competed against two very
good Division I programs. To be in the top echelon
we need to rise to this type of competition. It was a
put up or shut up meet where we needed to per
form to win."
While Johnson and his Mustangs hope to prove
themselves this weekend, the Cardinal looks fur
ther into its own schedule.
The Stanford Invitational is the marquee meet
for the Cardinal program. On the weekend of
March 24, leading high school and college athletes
converge on Stanford Stadium for some of the best
competition in the nation.
A week after the Stanford Invitational the Car
dinal competes at UC-Irvine with Air Force, and
the outdoor season of dual meets and invitationals
commences.
