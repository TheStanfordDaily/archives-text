# Men's lacrosse win streak ends
## 
### Amir Arbabi Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's lacrosse
team kept its win streak alive
with a 12-6 victory over St.
Mary's college last Wednesday
but dropped a tough game on Sat
urday to 20th-ranked Whittier by
a score of 19-4.
St. Mary's, a Division I North
opponent, proved to be a tougher
game than the Cardinal expected.
The teams were playing neck and
neck until the Cardinal finally
turned things on and finished
strong.
"We got off to a slow start, but
after the first quarter, we came
together as a team and started to
play the Stanford lacrosse that
we have been playing all year
long," head coach Dan Williams
said.

The St. Mary's game was
important to the team for two
reasons. First, it showed the Car
dinal that any team cannot be
taken lightly, and second, the vic
tory was the team's first league
win with Williams at the helm.
"We're really happy to get our
first league win under our new
coach after we lost our first two
league games," said senior co
captain Matt Jones.
Unfortunately, things were
not as easy for the team against
Whittier, an established West
Coast power and nationally
ranked team at the NCAA Divi
sion 111 level. Hoping to pull off a
major upset, the Cardinal wanted
to play the game at a slow pace
and keep the game close.
"We knew we had a shot if we
kept the game close, but they just
didn't allow us to do that. Whitti

er has been a power on the West
Coast for the five years that I
have been here, and this time
their offense was as potent as
ever," Jones said.
"They were deep in that they
had a lot of talent at every line.
All of their players were of top
caliber," Williams said.
The team did end the game on
a positive note, successfully
outscoring the Whittier team in
the fourth quarter.
The team's next game is after
spring break on the weekend of
April 8 and 9. The Cardinal plays
host to Sacramento State on that
Saturday and travels to Sonoma
State the next day. With three
more league games left to play on
the regular season schedule, the
team must win at least two of the
three in order to advance to the
first round of the playoffs.
