# Synchro will host Nationals

### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
The No. 2 Stanford synchro
nized swimming team aims to put
an end to one of the longest streaks
in collegiate athletic history next
week.
Ohio State has not lost the
national title since 1981, the last
time the collegiate nationals were
held in deGuerre Pool. In 1995, the
Buckeyes seek to 14-peat in Cardi
nal waters from March 23-25.
"I think because of the home
pool advantage, it's not out of the
question [that Stanford could
dethrone Ohio State]," said head
coach Vickey Weir. "We would
have to have outstanding perfor
mances by everyone."
Over 150 swimmers from 20
schools — including No. 3 Rich
mond and several squads from the
Pacific 10 and Big Ten Conferences
— will be on hand for the three-day
event beginning next Thursday.
The Cardinal is coming off a
blockbuster performance in the
West Regionals at Berkeley two
weeks ago. Continuing to assert its
dominance on the West Coast,

Stanford (8-1 overall, 4-0 in the
Pac-10) qualified all 12 of its swim
mers for the nationals.
"I'm veiy happy with the way
we've come together," Weir said.
"Definitely with the strong show
ing at the West Regionals, and
we've been improving the past cou
ple of weeks."
Thursday's action will begin at
8:30 am. with the A Figures com
petition, which Stanford junior All-
American Bridget Finn controlled
at the West Regionals. Action will
continue throughout the day with
the duet and trio preliminary
rounds.
The B figures event leads off the
Friday morning action at the same
time, as Stanford junior Courtney
Harrison hopes to duplicate her
Berkeley success. Freshman
Megan Fix, who won the C figures
at the Regional, will have to move
up to the B division on March 24.
The solo and team preliminaries
round out the Friday afternoon
activity, and Saturday afternoon's
finals begin at 1 p.m. The duet,
trio, solo and team finals will con
sume an hour apiece and be the key
to the competition.

"The two duets of [juniors]
Jenn Graves and [Ail-American]
Julie Davies and Bridget Finn and
[sophomore] Eunice Woods are key
in us doing really well," Weir said.
These teams placed third and
fourth at the West Regionals.
Finn will also have to shoulder
the load in the solo event, a com
petition in which she finished fifth
in a tight field at the West Region
al.
"Those who were her toughest
competition at Regionals will be
her toughest at nationals also,"
Weir said. "I don't anticipate Ohio
State sending a person to solos."
Instead, the Buckeyes will enter
two groups into the team event,
which counts for more points. With
16 qualifiers, Ohio State can afford
the luxury of sporting two teams.
Stanford, on the other hand, will
field one team and two trios.
"That's totally dictated by my
depth," Weir said. "We don't have
the depth of an Ohio State or Rich
mond.
"The team absolutely needs to
swim really well. I anticipate that
they will get second, but I would
love to get first."
