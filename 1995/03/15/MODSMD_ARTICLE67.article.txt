# he Man of La Mancha brings an operatic Don Quixote to life
## 
### Linda Friedlieb 
ith "Man of La Mancha," the
San Jose Civil Light Opera
dares to dream the impossi
ble dream and reach the un
reachable stars — in this

case, a daringly choreographed and directed
production of Dale Wasserman's musical
reimagination of the legendary "Don
Quixote."
But don't let the word "opera" scare you.
Although opera conjures up images of
highbrow society ladies dressed in cocktail
dresses and furs watching corpulent divas sing
in Italian with voices that could break glass,
"Man of La Mancha" belongs in the realm of
the best of musical theater, side by side with
more tragic favorites such as "Les Mi/" and
"Phantom."

The play was last
performed by the Civic
Light Opera in 1980 and
is part of the association's
60th anniversary sea-

son.
Director anc
choreographer Di

anna Shuster does
not waste one inch
of the enormous

stage at the San Jose Center for the Performing
Arts. Skillfully transforming the performance
area into a jail cell during the time of Spanish
Inquisition, set designer John B. Wilson uses
red lighting to give the stage a fearful glow that
practically takes on a life of its own.
Wasserman's "Man of La Mancha" is a play
within a play within a play, based loosely on the
life of Miguel de Cervantes y Saavedra and his
fictional hero Don Quixote de la Mancha. To
begin, Cervantes — a part-time tax collector
— is thrown into a dungeon after placing a lien
on the Catholic Church. Faced with accusa
tions of "idealism" and being a "bad poet"
from his fellow inmates, Cervantes retreats
into his guilt but suggests role play as a kind of
mitigating defense.
Thus, the jail and its prisoners flip-flop from
Cervantes and the inmates and judges to the
story of Alonzo Quixana, an old man who
imagines himself to be the errant knight Don
Quixote and travels the world with spiral
shaped sword "to dream the impossible dream"
and carry chivalry from the past into the pre
sent.
As Cervantes / Quixana / Quixote, Joe Vin
cent delivers a fantastic performance, trans
forming himself from brave-but-delusional
Quixote to Cervantes, scared by the sound of
the guards' footsteps. While portraying a man
who is both weak and strong, Vincent's deep,
authoritative voice adds a dimension of truth to
his theme song, "The Quest," and emotion
without end to the love song "Dulcinea."
When Quixote reaches an inn full of rowdy
muleteers, his imagination transforms it into a
castle; when he sees the scullery maid Aldonza,
he envisions his own ladv Dulcinea.

Normally a Broadway baby, Ann Crumb
brings a fullness to Aldonza. Every movement
of her body speaks volumes and her clear voice
carries the depths of her character's pain
through the raucous "It's All the Same" and the
sweetly confused "What Does He Want of Me?"
Hut it is Kddie Korbich asQuixana's manser
vant and Quixote's Sancho Fan/a who steals the
proverbial show with his gift for comedy. From
the moment he straps on a pillow to transform
himself into Sancho to the time he sings "A Lit
tle Gossip" to his comatose master, Korbich
takes the limelight and makes it his own.
With every blow of his broken bugle and
every utterance of an unreal proverb — "As 1 al
ways say, have patience and shuttle the cards."
— Korbich shows a gift for both physical and
verbal comedy.
Ultimately, though, the value of a musical
rests on its song, not acting. As performed by
the orchestra under the direction of William
Liberatorc, Mitch Leigh's music tills the audito
rium and reaches hearts, providing a strong
basis for a story about innocence and imagina
tion in a world without either.

Shuster's choreography shines in numbers
such as "It's All the Same," using every square
inch of stage to demonstrate Aldonza's inabili
ty to escape both her sad life and the callous

muleteers out to use her body.
In"The Abduction," Shuster
again does not shy away from the re
alities of sexual violence as the
muleteers kidnap and rape Aldonza.
There is no pretense of sexiness or
love; instead it is pure violence— par
ticularly disturbing with young chil
dren in attendance.

Yet through all the turmoil of tragic W
reality, Quixote remains an undying
symbol of hope surrounded by despair Vj
and imagination. He embodies the
courage of those who dare to pursue the

o I
"impossible dream."
Although it is easy to yet lost between sub
texts — at any given moment is Vincent acting
as Cervantes, Quixana, Quixote or some twist
ed mixture of the three — "Man of la Mancha"
is well worth the effort required to decipher
the three distinct steps of imagination from

Wasserman to Cervantes to Quixana to
Quixote.
"So learned and yet so misinformed,"
Quixote says of his niece's fiance who aims to
return the good senor Quixana to sanity by
confronting him with reality. "Facts are the en
emies of truth."
And the" Man of la Mancha" is the purveyor of
hope to all those willing to bring an open mind
and active imagination to the red plush chairs and
elegant surroundings of San Jose's Center for the
Performing Arts.
