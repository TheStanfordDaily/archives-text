# Grub Focus on: Ginger Club
## 
### Chris Levinson 
"We're fully booked." Serves me right for
assuming 1 could squeeze my way into this
new member of the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter's mainstream eateries at 7 p.m. on a Fri
day night. There are tables reserved for walk
ins however — it would be a wait, but we de
cide to risk it.
The interior decorator seems to think
Asian means palm trees. The leafy foliage
dots the medium-sized room and shows up
in the most unusual places. The Ginger Club
promises Chinese with a twist, and a wait.
Forty minutes at the bar, or the table by the
door. Friday night is quite a scene, and the
thought of more than 10 minutes sand
wiched between the after-work set standing
at the bar (all holding drinks with hot pink
plastic palm tree stirrers) was enough to
send me running to that now charming little
table bv the door.

What threatens to be a
life sentence in Siberia
turns out to be a gift. This
place serves up noise for
atmosphere, so sitting up
front helps to lesson the
roar. That and the little
nibble of kimchee-like
cabbage (sweet tasting
but with a bite) put me in
the mood while 1 perused
the menu.
I he offerings combine
the flavors of China and
South East Asia (Thai
land, Vietnam) in* an
amusing take on East
meets West. Case in
point: the Ginger Club
Fries ($3.95) are a mixture

of the expected potato and
the more unusual yam and taro root. It's a
casual atmosphere, not meant to be taken
too seriously. Think of it as the California
Pizza Kitchen of Chinese cuisine.
Tonight we order big. If all goes as
planned there will be no need for a doggie
bag. First to arrive are the Vegetable Won
tons taking a dip in a vinegar-sesame sauce
($4.75). First bite has more hint than sub
stance. These steamed pockets fall flat, but
friend S. manages to polish them off, while
remaining skeptical. Next up, a trio. Shang
hai-Style Noodles with Vegetables ($7.50)
— roast eggplant, shiitake mushrooms, pep
pers and the like — proved unfortunate.
Thick, unwieldy noodles wearing a coat of
oil lay intertwined in a heap. Redeemed only
momentarily by the vegetables nestled on

top, I decided to move on.
My chopsticks land in the Chicken and
Water Chestnut Yellow Curry Noodles
($8.95) ordered extra hot. Even S., the king
of spice, shoots straight for his water glass.
The conflicting mix of chopped peanuts and
curry paste adds up to an odd texture while
the sheer heat of the dish dulls any taste-hud
to numbness. Here the noodles improve,
thin variations of capillini, but even they
can't save this dish.
Last chance, I opt for a fork and dig in to
the Stir Fried Chicken with Fresh Spring As
paragus ($9.95)... and strike gold. Firm lit
tle nuggets of chicken breast lulled in a
brown sauce worlds away from the standard
thick paste I was fearing. On the side, an airy
dome of Jasmine Rice.
For the lite-hearted or veggie-friendly

there is the Steamed
Buddhist Vegetables
($8.95) or Steamed
Fish of the Day
($12.75) topped off
with ginger, scallions
and black beans. Feel
daring? Try the
Burmese Coconut
Seafood Curry
($11.95) or the Grilled
Skewered Lamb
($14.75). Myself? I was
ready to call it a night.
1 wanted to like
this place.. Its close by,
not caught up in Palo
Alto attitude, but there
really isn't anything I'd
come back for. The

twosome next to us eats
here once a week (preferably on week nights
when they claim the place is almost quiet)
and swear by the curries and the candied
ginger that accompanies every check.
"At least you can say that the rice is good"
offers S. as he pockets the plastic palm tree
that came in our ginger ale. Sorry. That just
isn't enough.
