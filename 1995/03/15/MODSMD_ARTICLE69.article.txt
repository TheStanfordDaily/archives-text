# Trapped on the Farm over spring break?
## Here's what to do and where to go — even if you don't have a car 
### Seeta Gangadharan 
One of the great travel writers, Paul Th
eroux, said that planning a vacation is
like writing a book: "Travel is a cre
ative act — not simply loafing and inviting
your soul, but feeding the imagination, ac
counting for each fresh wonder, memorizing
and moving 0n... " Your original itinerary
might portend of great things to come, but
you never can tell what events might re-direct
your premeditated schedule.
Last year, my roommate and I had grand
visions of hitchhiking our spirited, au
tonomous selves all around the island of
Kuaui. We were quickly sobered up as a result
of bad weather conditions and of speeches by
locals admonishing against any pseudo-hip
pie, pedestrian endeavors. Our vacation
wasn't ruined by either unexpected occur
rence — it was just rendered different.
Well, for those of us who will be rooted
here in the great suburban wasteland of Palo
Alto, the opportunity to adapt to deviations
in spring break plans is less frequent. First, we
already know what to expect from Palo Alto
and its environs, because we've been breath
ing it in for the past (at least) two quarters.
The question which confronts the Stanford
student who plans to stick around is: What
did I intend to do during the quarter, but
never got around to doing? How many times
did I flake at the last minute in order to write
a paper (or more accurately, procrastinate on
writing a paper)? Exactly how lame and
unimaginative was I?
This article serves as both a reminder and
a guide, that there is more to the Bay Area
than what one does during scavenger hunts
for freshman orientation. With or without a
car, believe it or not, you too can enjoy spring
break without trekking all the way to Cabo
San Lucas. Quit secretly hoping that everyone
who went to Baja got sick, was rained out,
had car troubles and never made it. Concen
trate on relaxing and indulge yourself in a
day-trip to somewhere in or around Stanford
University.
On campus, or just off
There are few activities taking place on
campus. Many athletes sacrifice fun time for
the sake of Stanford sporting fame. Begin
ning with the Stanford Track Invitational on
the March 24, athletic competition during
spring break will include the tennis, baseball,
softball and men's volleyball teams. For more
information, call the Athletics Department at
723-1021.
Outside of sports, however, on-campus
events are virtually non-existent. If you plan
on spending most of your time working on a
thesis, finishing incompletes or what-have
you, treat yourself to an occasional spin
downtown, courtesy of the Marguerite.
That's right. Mobility is an option. There's no
reason you have to stay on campus; The Mar
guerite shuttle service, infrequently used by
undergrads, will transport you to the Stan
ford Shopping Center, Lytton Plaza in down
town Palo Alto or California Avenue.
With many of the eating facilities on cam
pus closed or empty, now is the chance to

brave eateries like Naranja, the Good Earth,
Ramona's, the Blue Chalk Cafe, Printer's Inc.,
St. Michaels' Cafe or Whole Foods. Per
chance you will even chance upon faces fa
miliar to favorite campus sites like the Coffee
House (although, I have to say I've never seen
Sister Pat in the downtown area).
The Marguerite can also let you off at the
train station. Riding to the station may be a
wiser choice, however, since the Marguerite
stops running to and from campus shortly
after 6:30 p.m. And if you are comfortable
riding around San Francisco, the train per
mits four bikes on at a time.
Relaxing with nature
A day-trip to Golden Gate Park promises
to transport one far, far away from the stress
and / or banality of Stanford life. One day at
Golden Gate is really not enough to explore
the park's 1,017 acres: Meadows, lakes, rose
gardens, Japanese gardens, an arboretum,
riding stables, museums, a rhododendron
dell, the Conservatory of flowers, an open-air
music concourse, children's playgrounds,
buffalo paddock and the tallest artificial wa
terfall in the West are all possibilities. Sun
days, when vehicles are prohibited, are par
ticularly good days to ride bikes or
rollerblade or skate (or people-watch, for
that matter).
The Exploratorium in the Park is a hands
on learning experience geared towards teach
ing kids how we see, hear and smell the world
around us. Even for an adult, the Explorato
rium furnishes an afternoon of playfulness
and trippy fun with over 700 exhibits. If you
plan on going to the Exploratorium, you
should definitely make reservations for the
Tactile Dome, a touchy-feely tour through 13
chambers in the dark. These must be made a
week in advance, as the Tactile Dome is a
popular place. Also worth your while is the
Morrison Planetarium and the Steinhart
Aquarium.
If you want to use the week to reacquaint
your self with the act of physical fitness, try
riding up to one of the 23 preserves in the
Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District.
These open space preserves boast over 36,000
acres of northern Santa Clara, southern San
Mateo and part of Santa Cruz counties.
The preserves burst with bucolic land
scapes, historical landmarks and geological
riches, offer more than 100 walks and hikes
each year and more than 250 miles of trails
for jogging, riding horses and hiking.
Because these preserves are committed to
the permanent protection of wildlife habitat,
natural resources and fragile ecosystems,
careful considerations must be considered —
some restrictions exist. For example, it is
worthy to note that not all trails are open to
mountain bikers.
The Russian Ridge Open Space Preserve,
according to one Stanford student, "gives you
the highest point on the ridge [of the Penin
sula Coastal Range] with a view inside of the
Bay."
To get there, at the junction with Page Mill
and Alpine Roads, turn west (right) off Sky

line onto Alpine. Within 500
feet, turn right again into a
large, new parking lot
tucked into the corner
of Russian Ridge

Open Space
Preserve.
Com
pared to the
bare, ex
po s e d
site of

Russian Ridge, the
preserve of El
Corte de Madera is
more thickly wooded,
spotted with breaks for
vista points. Located

about four or
five miles
north of the
top of La
Honda "
Road, El
Corte de
Madera has -
a vista park
ing lot on
the right side
of the street.
After a quarter
of mile, a trail
marker will ap
pear on the left.
This one
mile hike will
bring you to
sandstone
formations
and a "broad
sweeping view
of hills and ocean."

Purisima Creek Redwoods Open Space
Preserve a few miles further north than El
Corte Madera, this bike trail will take you to
the coast without ever having to travel past
roads.

Windy Hill Open Space Reserve, often fre
quented by members of the Columbae
Mountain Running Club, is another great lo
cation along the spine of the Peninsula
Coastal Range. On the east side of Skyline
Boulevard, two miles south of La Honda
Road (Route 84), you will find the trail head
parking lot.
Because the open-space district prefers to

keep a low-profile, the number of signs
marking the location of the preserves is kept
to a minimum. Small Y's are often the best
landmarks for locating the trail head. Other
signs indicate that the preserves are open
from dawn to dusk and issue this curt warn
ing: no dogs, no vehicles, no collecting.
If you do not look forward to the uphill
haul, consider utilizing the SamTrans bus,
which will take you all the way to the Skylon

tersection of La Honda and Skyline. Unfor
tunately, the scheduled times of the bus line
may cut your day of fitness in half: bus 50A
leaves the Stanford Shopping Center at 3:35
p.m., arriving at Skylonda at 4:16. However,
you can bring your bike on board and thus
will at least be able to get some riding and/or
hiking done without having to brave the ride
up to the preserves. The ride back to campus

da shop- is all downhill and you'll still be able to walk
ping center come nighttime.
at the in- You can also take your bike on the train —

which will cut down on the wait you
suffer when getting

around the city
of San Francisco
on public trans
portation. For a
taste of a park
other than Golden
Gate, try Park
Presidio, situated
at the north end
of San Francisco. A
seven mile hike

around this
1,400 acre
reservation
takes you
past sand
dunes and a
reservoir and

through a euca
lyptus forest.
All through
out there are
various ocean
overlooks and
of Golden
Gate Bridge.

Got wheels?
For those blessed
with the fortune of
vi owning a car but who

are staying on
campus (are there
. any of you?),
; you indeed
are the lucky

ones who can
turn spring break
into a symphony of
delight. Outdoor activi
ties in a 50 to 100 mile ra
dius abound and truly in
fuse one with the sense of

being truly free of Stanford.
A (mere) drive to the East Bay, for exam
ple, transports you to another dimension.
From east San Jose take Mount Hamilton
Road east. The road ascends slowly to
Mount Hamilton, 4,062 above sea level, and
then over the top into wilderness of San An
tonio Valley.
For another driving tour, Point Reyes in

Marin can be reached by a slow, languorous
route: take Bolinas / Fairfax Road. From
Fairfax, the road rises up the southern side
of Mount Tamalpais, past Alpine Lake, and
into dense woods. These woods thin out
once Fairfax near the coast. Turn north onto
Bolinas and head to Point Reyes.
Point Reyes is also virtual hotbed for fit
ness types. Several trails, such as the Palo
marin Trailhead, lie northwest of Bolinas.
This winds past Bass Lake, Pelican Lake to
Alamere Falls almost the Marin coast.
At the opposite end of the Peninsula, Big
Basin lies in the mountains of Santa Cruz.
Meteor Trail, a less-frequented path to the
Big Basin waterfalls, runs along Opal Creek
and then climbs 400 feet to the Middle Ridge
Fire Road, culminating in a spectacular
lookout called Ocean View Summit (1,600
feet).
For activities a little less rigorous, visit
any one of the following wacky locations:
• Llama Loft: Route 1, in Valley Ford. This
llama farm also has a llama gallery inside the
Williams' Victorian home.
• Honkey Donkeys: 5355 Hall Road, Santa
Rosa. Get to know a friendly and good-tem
pered ass or two. The landmark for Honkey
Donkey is a sign that touts "Bird Exchange."
Strange, but true.
• Surfing Museum: Lighthouse Point,
Santa Cruz. Meet some of the old-skool
surfers in this small museum of wet suits,
fiberglass and a plethora of other surfer
memorabilia.
• Packard Showroom: Webb Avenue off
Park Street, Alameda. Look for the neon sign
for the showroom on Webb. Inside are 15
brightly lit classic cars. Consider it an artis
tic collection of automobiles.
Of course, car owners can do any of the
things which those without automobiles
may aspire to do. And rather effortlessly at
that.
Chances are, if you own a car you proba
bly have an inkling as to what activities could
be fun. But in case you are suddenly
strapped for additional information, I ad
vise perusing the Guide to the Good Life.
More ambitious readers may refer to "Cali
fornia Walking Atlas" by Gary Yanker and
Carol Tarlow, McGraw Hill, or "Jerry Gra
ham's Complete Bay Area Backroads" by
Jerry Graham, Harper's Perennial.
After the sun sets
Nightlife is prejudiced towards those with
cars and ID's. For underage, earless kiddies,
raves are an option, provided that party bus
ing is offered not too far from a public trans
portation station. Since most raves last all
night, if "shuttles" are running, you don't
have to worry about sleeping at the train sta
tion or waiting for the 7F SamTrans bus
while everyone else is fast asleep. Take the
last train up and return on the first one back.
This does not happen too frequently, so if in
terested, your best bet is to pay attention to
the newsgroup "alt.raves."
If you are privileged with a car, "alt.raves"
will provide listings to various regular par

ties as well as "specials" that cater to the deep
trance, house, acid jazz and techno-mon
gers. One party to look for is the Bulletproof
Boat Party, a three-hour cruise on the Bay
the first Sunday of the month. This is cus
tomarily followed by an after-party (with
complimentary Caribbean food) at Miss
Pearl's Jam House. The cost is around 20
bucks — pricey, but definitely worth it for
practically a whole day of partying.
For musical and dancing opportunities of
a completely different type, several great
shows are playing during spring break:
Seven Year Bitch plays at the Bottom of
the Hill on March 25. Let's Go Bowling and
No Doubt will be at the Great American
Music Hall at 9 p.m. on March 27. Pantera
with Type O Negative are doing an all-ages
show at the San Jose State Events Center on
March 30. Morphine plays at the Great
American Music Hall on March 31. Also that
day, Swingin' Utters, The Lowdowns and the
Wrong Way Right are at Nightbreak, and
M.I.R.V. with Flesh Weapons and Boris Dig
will be at New George's.
These are just a smattering of concert op
tions — pay attention to concert listings on
KZSU or in the papers.
I've listed innumerable amounts of infor
mation — enough items with which to
fill a week, no doubt. The fun stuff "out
there" in the Bay Area is there for the taking.
Go out and get some. It's Spring — daylight
savings is in effect — it's about time.
As Paul Theroux reflected: w ... the best
landscapes, [either] dense or fruitless, hold
surprises if they are studied patiently, in the
kind of discomfort one can savor afterward."
There's no reprieve from a barren spring
break filled with acutely unsavory discom
fort if you sit around and pretend that an
empty campus allows you to contemplate
the beauty of life.
So get out there and just do it.

The Exploratorium: $8.50 for adults.

ative act — not simply loafing and inviting
your soul, but feeding the imagination, ac
counting for each fresh wonder, memorizing
and moving 0n... " Your original itinerary
might portend of great things to come, but
you never can tell what events might re-direct
your premeditated schedule.
Last year, my roommate and I had grand
visions of hitchhiking our spirited, au
tonomous selves all around the island of
Kuaui. We were quickly sobered up as a result
of bad weather conditions and of speeches by
locals admonishing against any pseudo-hip
pie, pedestrian endeavors. Our vacation
wasn't ruined by either unexpected occur
rence — it was just rendered different.
Well, for those of us who will be rooted
here in the great suburban wasteland of Palo
Alto, the opportunity to adapt to deviations
in spring break plans is less frequent. First, we
already know what to expect from Palo Alto
and its environs, because we've been breath
ing it in for the past (at least) two quarters.
The question which confronts the Stanford
student who plans to stick around is: What
did I intend to do during the quarter, but
never got around to doing? How many times
did I flake at the last minute in order to write
a paper (or more accurately, procrastinate on
writing a paper)? Exactly how lame and
unimaginative was I?
This article serves as both a reminder and
a guide, that there is more to the Bay Area
than what one does during scavenger hunts
for freshman orientation. With or without a
car, believe it or not, you too can enjoy spring
break without trekking all the way to Cabo
San Lucas. Quit secretly hoping that everyone
who went to Baja got sick, was rained out,
had car troubles and never made it. Concen
trate on relaxing and indulge yourself in a
day-trip to somewhere in or around Stanford
University.
On campus, or just off
There are few activities taking place on
campus. Many athletes sacrifice fun time for
the sake of Stanford sporting fame. Begin
ning with the Stanford Track Invitational on
the March 24, athletic competition during
spring break will include the tennis, baseball,
softball and men's volleyball teams. For more
information, call the Athletics Department at
723-1021.
Outside of sports, however, on-campus
events are virtually non-existent. If you plan
on spending most of your time working on a
thesis, finishing incompletes or what-have
you, treat yourself to an occasional spin
downtown, courtesy of the Marguerite.
That's right. Mobility is an option. There's no
reason you have to stay on campus; The Mar
guerite shuttle service, infrequently used by
undergrads, will transport you to the Stan
ford Shopping Center, Lytton Plaza in down
town Palo Alto or California Avenue.
With many of the eating facilities on cam
pus closed or empty, now is the chance to

brave eateries like Naranja, the Good Earth,
Ramona's, the Blue Chalk Cafe, Printer's Inc.,
St. Michaels' Cafe or Whole Foods. Per
chance you will even chance upon faces fa
miliar to favorite campus sites like the Coffee
House (although, I have to say I've never seen
Sister Pat in the downtown area).
The Marguerite can also let you off at the
train station. Riding to the station may be a
wiser choice, however, since the Marguerite
stops running to and from campus shortly
after 6:30 p.m. And if you are comfortable
riding around San Francisco, the train per
mits four bikes on at a time.
Relaxing with nature
A day-trip to Golden Gate Park promises
to transport one far, far away from the stress
and / or banality of Stanford life. One day at
Golden Gate is really not enough to explore
the park's 1,017 acres: Meadows, lakes, rose
gardens, Japanese gardens, an arboretum,
riding stables, museums, a rhododendron
dell, the Conservatory of flowers, an open-air
music concourse, children's playgrounds,
buffalo paddock and the tallest artificial wa
terfall in the West are all possibilities. Sun
days, when vehicles are prohibited, are par
ticularly good days to ride bikes or
rollerblade or skate (or people-watch, for
that matter).
The Exploratorium in the Park is a hands
on learning experience geared towards teach
ing kids how we see, hear and smell the world
around us. Even for an adult, the Explorato
rium furnishes an afternoon of playfulness
and trippy fun with over 700 exhibits. If you
plan on going to the Exploratorium, you
should definitely make reservations for the
Tactile Dome, a touchy-feely tour through 13
chambers in the dark. These must be made a
week in advance, as the Tactile Dome is a
popular place. Also worth your while is the
Morrison Planetarium and the Steinhart
Aquarium.
If you want to use the week to reacquaint
your self with the act of physical fitness, try
riding up to one of the 23 preserves in the
Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District.
These open space preserves boast over 36,000
acres of northern Santa Clara, southern San
Mateo and part of Santa Cruz counties.
The preserves burst with bucolic land
scapes, historical landmarks and geological
riches, offer more than 100 walks and hikes
each year and more than 250 miles of trails
for jogging, riding horses and hiking.
Because these preserves are committed to
the permanent protection of wildlife habitat,
natural resources and fragile ecosystems,
careful considerations must be considered —
some restrictions exist. For example, it is
worthy to note that not all trails are open to
mountain bikers.
The Russian Ridge Open Space Preserve,
according to one Stanford student, "gives you
the highest point on the ridge [of the Penin
sula Coastal Range] with a view inside of the
Bay."
To get there, at the junction with Page Mill
and Alpine Roads, turn west (right) off Sky

line onto Alpine. Within 500
feet, turn right again into a
large, new parking lot
tucked into the corner
of Russian Ridge

Open Space
Preserve.
Com
pared to the
bare, ex
po s e d
site of

Russian Ridge, the
preserve of El
Corte de Madera is
more thickly wooded,
spotted with breaks for
vista points. Located

about four or
five miles
north of the
top of La
Honda "
Road, El
Corte de
Madera has -
a vista park
ing lot on
the right side
of the street.
After a quarter
of mile, a trail
marker will ap
pear on the left.
This one
mile hike will
bring you to
sandstone
formations
and a "broad
sweeping view
of hills and ocean."

Purisima Creek Redwoods Open Space
Preserve a few miles further north than El
Corte Madera, this bike trail will take you to
the coast without ever having to travel past
roads.

Windy Hill Open Space Reserve, often fre
quented by members of the Columbae
Mountain Running Club, is another great lo
cation along the spine of the Peninsula
Coastal Range. On the east side of Skyline
Boulevard, two miles south of La Honda
Road (Route 84), you will find the trail head
parking lot.
Because the open-space district prefers to

keep a low-profile, the number of signs
marking the location of the preserves is kept
to a minimum. Small Y's are often the best
landmarks for locating the trail head. Other
signs indicate that the preserves are open
from dawn to dusk and issue this curt warn
ing: no dogs, no vehicles, no collecting.
If you do not look forward to the uphill
haul, consider utilizing the SamTrans bus,
which will take you all the way to the Skylon

tersection of La Honda and Skyline. Unfor
tunately, the scheduled times of the bus line
may cut your day of fitness in half: bus 50A
leaves the Stanford Shopping Center at 3:35
p.m., arriving at Skylonda at 4:16. However,
you can bring your bike on board and thus
will at least be able to get some riding and/or
hiking done without having to brave the ride
up to the preserves. The ride back to campus

da shop- is all downhill and you'll still be able to walk
ping center come nighttime.
at the in- You can also take your bike on the train —

which will cut down on the wait you
suffer when getting

around the city
of San Francisco
on public trans
portation. For a
taste of a park
other than Golden
Gate, try Park
Presidio, situated
at the north end
of San Francisco. A
seven mile hike

around this
1,400 acre
reservation
takes you
past sand
dunes and a
reservoir and

through a euca
lyptus forest.
All through
out there are
various ocean
overlooks and
of Golden
Gate Bridge.

Got wheels?
For those blessed
with the fortune of
vi owning a car but who

are staying on
campus (are there
. any of you?),
; you indeed
are the lucky

ones who can
turn spring break
into a symphony of
delight. Outdoor activi
ties in a 50 to 100 mile ra
dius abound and truly in
fuse one with the sense of

being truly free of Stanford.
A (mere) drive to the East Bay, for exam
ple, transports you to another dimension.
From east San Jose take Mount Hamilton
Road east. The road ascends slowly to
Mount Hamilton, 4,062 above sea level, and
then over the top into wilderness of San An
tonio Valley.
For another driving tour, Point Reyes in

Marin can be reached by a slow, languorous
route: take Bolinas / Fairfax Road. From
Fairfax, the road rises up the southern side
of Mount Tamalpais, past Alpine Lake, and
into dense woods. These woods thin out
once Fairfax near the coast. Turn north onto
Bolinas and head to Point Reyes.
Point Reyes is also virtual hotbed for fit
ness types. Several trails, such as the Palo
marin Trailhead, lie northwest of Bolinas.
This winds past Bass Lake, Pelican Lake to
Alamere Falls almost the Marin coast.
At the opposite end of the Peninsula, Big
Basin lies in the mountains of Santa Cruz.
Meteor Trail, a less-frequented path to the
Big Basin waterfalls, runs along Opal Creek
and then climbs 400 feet to the Middle Ridge
Fire Road, culminating in a spectacular
lookout called Ocean View Summit (1,600
feet).
For activities a little less rigorous, visit
any one of the following wacky locations:
• Llama Loft: Route 1, in Valley Ford. This
llama farm also has a llama gallery inside the
Williams' Victorian home.
• Honkey Donkeys: 5355 Hall Road, Santa
Rosa. Get to know a friendly and good-tem
pered ass or two. The landmark for Honkey
Donkey is a sign that touts "Bird Exchange."
Strange, but true.
• Surfing Museum: Lighthouse Point,
Santa Cruz. Meet some of the old-skool
surfers in this small museum of wet suits,
fiberglass and a plethora of other surfer
memorabilia.
• Packard Showroom: Webb Avenue off
Park Street, Alameda. Look for the neon sign
for the showroom on Webb. Inside are 15
brightly lit classic cars. Consider it an artis
tic collection of automobiles.
Of course, car owners can do any of the
things which those without automobiles
may aspire to do. And rather effortlessly at
that.
Chances are, if you own a car you proba
bly have an inkling as to what activities could
be fun. But in case you are suddenly
strapped for additional information, I ad
vise perusing the Guide to the Good Life.
More ambitious readers may refer to "Cali
fornia Walking Atlas" by Gary Yanker and
Carol Tarlow, McGraw Hill, or "Jerry Gra
ham's Complete Bay Area Backroads" by
Jerry Graham, Harper's Perennial.
After the sun sets
Nightlife is prejudiced towards those with
cars and ID's. For underage, earless kiddies,
raves are an option, provided that party bus
ing is offered not too far from a public trans
portation station. Since most raves last all
night, if "shuttles" are running, you don't
have to worry about sleeping at the train sta
tion or waiting for the 7F SamTrans bus
while everyone else is fast asleep. Take the
last train up and return on the first one back.
This does not happen too frequently, so if in
terested, your best bet is to pay attention to
the newsgroup "alt.raves."
If you are privileged with a car, "alt.raves"
will provide listings to various regular par

ties as well as "specials" that cater to the deep
trance, house, acid jazz and techno-mon
gers. One party to look for is the Bulletproof
Boat Party, a three-hour cruise on the Bay
the first Sunday of the month. This is cus
tomarily followed by an after-party (with
complimentary Caribbean food) at Miss
Pearl's Jam House. The cost is around 20
bucks — pricey, but definitely worth it for
practically a whole day of partying.
For musical and dancing opportunities of
a completely different type, several great
shows are playing during spring break:
Seven Year Bitch plays at the Bottom of
the Hill on March 25. Let's Go Bowling and
No Doubt will be at the Great American
Music Hall at 9 p.m. on March 27. Pantera
with Type O Negative are doing an all-ages
show at the San Jose State Events Center on
March 30. Morphine plays at the Great
American Music Hall on March 31. Also that
day, Swingin' Utters, The Lowdowns and the
Wrong Way Right are at Nightbreak, and
M.I.R.V. with Flesh Weapons and Boris Dig
will be at New George's.
These are just a smattering of concert op
tions — pay attention to concert listings on
KZSU or in the papers.
I've listed innumerable amounts of infor
mation — enough items with which to
fill a week, no doubt. The fun stuff "out
there" in the Bay Area is there for the taking.
Go out and get some. It's Spring — daylight
savings is in effect — it's about time.
As Paul Theroux reflected: w ... the best
landscapes, [either] dense or fruitless, hold
surprises if they are studied patiently, in the
kind of discomfort one can savor afterward."
There's no reprieve from a barren spring
break filled with acutely unsavory discom
fort if you sit around and pretend that an
empty campus allows you to contemplate
the beauty of life.
So get out there and just do it.

The Exploratorium: $8.50 for adults.

you never can tell what events might re-direct
your premeditated schedule.
Last year, my roommate and I had grand
visions of hitchhiking our spirited, au
tonomous selves all around the island of
Kuaui. We were quickly sobered up as a result
of bad weather conditions and of speeches by
locals admonishing against any pseudo-hip
pie, pedestrian endeavors. Our vacation
wasn't ruined by either unexpected occur
rence — it was just rendered different.
Well, for those of us who will be rooted
here in the great suburban wasteland of Palo
Alto, the opportunity to adapt to deviations
in spring break plans is less frequent. First, we
already know what to expect from Palo Alto
and its environs, because we've been breath
ing it in for the past (at least) two quarters.
The question which confronts the Stanford
student who plans to stick around is: What
did I intend to do during the quarter, but
never got around to doing? How many times
did I flake at the last minute in order to write
a paper (or more accurately, procrastinate on
writing a paper)? Exactly how lame and
unimaginative was I?
This article serves as both a reminder and
a guide, that there is more to the Bay Area
than what one does during scavenger hunts
for freshman orientation. With or without a
car, believe it or not, you too can enjoy spring
break without trekking all the way to Cabo
San Lucas. Quit secretly hoping that everyone
who went to Baja got sick, was rained out,
had car troubles and never made it. Concen
trate on relaxing and indulge yourself in a
day-trip to somewhere in or around Stanford
University.
On campus, or just off
There are few activities taking place on
campus. Many athletes sacrifice fun time for
the sake of Stanford sporting fame. Begin
ning with the Stanford Track Invitational on
the March 24, athletic competition during
spring break will include the tennis, baseball,
softball and men's volleyball teams. For more
information, call the Athletics Department at
723-1021.
Outside of sports, however, on-campus
events are virtually non-existent. If you plan
on spending most of your time working on a
thesis, finishing incompletes or what-have
you, treat yourself to an occasional spin
downtown, courtesy of the Marguerite.
That's right. Mobility is an option. There's no
reason you have to stay on campus; The Mar
guerite shuttle service, infrequently used by
undergrads, will transport you to the Stan
ford Shopping Center, Lytton Plaza in down
town Palo Alto or California Avenue.
With many of the eating facilities on cam
pus closed or empty, now is the chance to

brave eateries like Naranja, the Good Earth,
Ramona's, the Blue Chalk Cafe, Printer's Inc.,
St. Michaels' Cafe or Whole Foods. Per
chance you will even chance upon faces fa
miliar to favorite campus sites like the Coffee
House (although, I have to say I've never seen
Sister Pat in the downtown area).
The Marguerite can also let you off at the
train station. Riding to the station may be a
wiser choice, however, since the Marguerite
stops running to and from campus shortly
after 6:30 p.m. And if you are comfortable
riding around San Francisco, the train per
mits four bikes on at a time.
Relaxing with nature
A day-trip to Golden Gate Park promises
to transport one far, far away from the stress
and / or banality of Stanford life. One day at
Golden Gate is really not enough to explore
the park's 1,017 acres: Meadows, lakes, rose
gardens, Japanese gardens, an arboretum,
riding stables, museums, a rhododendron
dell, the Conservatory of flowers, an open-air
music concourse, children's playgrounds,
buffalo paddock and the tallest artificial wa
terfall in the West are all possibilities. Sun
days, when vehicles are prohibited, are par
ticularly good days to ride bikes or
rollerblade or skate (or people-watch, for
that matter).
The Exploratorium in the Park is a hands
on learning experience geared towards teach
ing kids how we see, hear and smell the world
around us. Even for an adult, the Explorato
rium furnishes an afternoon of playfulness
and trippy fun with over 700 exhibits. If you
plan on going to the Exploratorium, you
should definitely make reservations for the
Tactile Dome, a touchy-feely tour through 13
chambers in the dark. These must be made a
week in advance, as the Tactile Dome is a
popular place. Also worth your while is the
Morrison Planetarium and the Steinhart
Aquarium.
If you want to use the week to reacquaint
your self with the act of physical fitness, try
riding up to one of the 23 preserves in the
Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District.
These open space preserves boast over 36,000
acres of northern Santa Clara, southern San
Mateo and part of Santa Cruz counties.
The preserves burst with bucolic land
scapes, historical landmarks and geological
riches, offer more than 100 walks and hikes
each year and more than 250 miles of trails
for jogging, riding horses and hiking.
Because these preserves are committed to
the permanent protection of wildlife habitat,
natural resources and fragile ecosystems,
careful considerations must be considered —
some restrictions exist. For example, it is
worthy to note that not all trails are open to
mountain bikers.
The Russian Ridge Open Space Preserve,
according to one Stanford student, "gives you
the highest point on the ridge [of the Penin
sula Coastal Range] with a view inside of the
Bay."
To get there, at the junction with Page Mill
and Alpine Roads, turn west (right) off Sky

line onto Alpine. Within 500
feet, turn right again into a
large, new parking lot
tucked into the corner
of Russian Ridge

Open Space
Preserve.
Com
pared to the
bare, ex
po s e d
site of

Russian Ridge, the
preserve of El
Corte de Madera is
more thickly wooded,
spotted with breaks for
vista points. Located

about four or
five miles
north of the
top of La
Honda "
Road, El
Corte de
Madera has -
a vista park
ing lot on
the right side
of the street.
After a quarter
of mile, a trail
marker will ap
pear on the left.
This one
mile hike will
bring you to
sandstone
formations
and a "broad
sweeping view
of hills and ocean."

Purisima Creek Redwoods Open Space
Preserve a few miles further north than El
Corte Madera, this bike trail will take you to
the coast without ever having to travel past
roads.

Windy Hill Open Space Reserve, often fre
quented by members of the Columbae
Mountain Running Club, is another great lo
cation along the spine of the Peninsula
Coastal Range. On the east side of Skyline
Boulevard, two miles south of La Honda
Road (Route 84), you will find the trail head
parking lot.
Because the open-space district prefers to

keep a low-profile, the number of signs
marking the location of the preserves is kept
to a minimum. Small Y's are often the best
landmarks for locating the trail head. Other
signs indicate that the preserves are open
from dawn to dusk and issue this curt warn
ing: no dogs, no vehicles, no collecting.
If you do not look forward to the uphill
haul, consider utilizing the SamTrans bus,
which will take you all the way to the Skylon

tersection of La Honda and Skyline. Unfor
tunately, the scheduled times of the bus line
may cut your day of fitness in half: bus 50A
leaves the Stanford Shopping Center at 3:35
p.m., arriving at Skylonda at 4:16. However,
you can bring your bike on board and thus
will at least be able to get some riding and/or
hiking done without having to brave the ride
up to the preserves. The ride back to campus

da shop- is all downhill and you'll still be able to walk
ping center come nighttime.
at the in- You can also take your bike on the train —

which will cut down on the wait you
suffer when getting

around the city
of San Francisco
on public trans
portation. For a
taste of a park
other than Golden
Gate, try Park
Presidio, situated
at the north end
of San Francisco. A
seven mile hike

around this
1,400 acre
reservation
takes you
past sand
dunes and a
reservoir and

through a euca
lyptus forest.
All through
out there are
various ocean
overlooks and
of Golden
Gate Bridge.

Got wheels?
For those blessed
with the fortune of
vi owning a car but who

are staying on
campus (are there
. any of you?),
; you indeed
are the lucky

ones who can
turn spring break
into a symphony of
delight. Outdoor activi
ties in a 50 to 100 mile ra
dius abound and truly in
fuse one with the sense of

being truly free of Stanford.
A (mere) drive to the East Bay, for exam
ple, transports you to another dimension.
From east San Jose take Mount Hamilton
Road east. The road ascends slowly to
Mount Hamilton, 4,062 above sea level, and
then over the top into wilderness of San An
tonio Valley.
For another driving tour, Point Reyes in

Marin can be reached by a slow, languorous
route: take Bolinas / Fairfax Road. From
Fairfax, the road rises up the southern side
of Mount Tamalpais, past Alpine Lake, and
into dense woods. These woods thin out
once Fairfax near the coast. Turn north onto
Bolinas and head to Point Reyes.
Point Reyes is also virtual hotbed for fit
ness types. Several trails, such as the Palo
marin Trailhead, lie northwest of Bolinas.
This winds past Bass Lake, Pelican Lake to
Alamere Falls almost the Marin coast.
At the opposite end of the Peninsula, Big
Basin lies in the mountains of Santa Cruz.
Meteor Trail, a less-frequented path to the
Big Basin waterfalls, runs along Opal Creek
and then climbs 400 feet to the Middle Ridge
Fire Road, culminating in a spectacular
lookout called Ocean View Summit (1,600
feet).
For activities a little less rigorous, visit
any one of the following wacky locations:
• Llama Loft: Route 1, in Valley Ford. This
llama farm also has a llama gallery inside the
Williams' Victorian home.
• Honkey Donkeys: 5355 Hall Road, Santa
Rosa. Get to know a friendly and good-tem
pered ass or two. The landmark for Honkey
Donkey is a sign that touts "Bird Exchange."
Strange, but true.
• Surfing Museum: Lighthouse Point,
Santa Cruz. Meet some of the old-skool
surfers in this small museum of wet suits,
fiberglass and a plethora of other surfer
memorabilia.
• Packard Showroom: Webb Avenue off
Park Street, Alameda. Look for the neon sign
for the showroom on Webb. Inside are 15
brightly lit classic cars. Consider it an artis
tic collection of automobiles.
Of course, car owners can do any of the
things which those without automobiles
may aspire to do. And rather effortlessly at
that.
Chances are, if you own a car you proba
bly have an inkling as to what activities could
be fun. But in case you are suddenly
strapped for additional information, I ad
vise perusing the Guide to the Good Life.
More ambitious readers may refer to "Cali
fornia Walking Atlas" by Gary Yanker and
Carol Tarlow, McGraw Hill, or "Jerry Gra
ham's Complete Bay Area Backroads" by
Jerry Graham, Harper's Perennial.
After the sun sets
Nightlife is prejudiced towards those with
cars and ID's. For underage, earless kiddies,
raves are an option, provided that party bus
ing is offered not too far from a public trans
portation station. Since most raves last all
night, if "shuttles" are running, you don't
have to worry about sleeping at the train sta
tion or waiting for the 7F SamTrans bus
while everyone else is fast asleep. Take the
last train up and return on the first one back.
This does not happen too frequently, so if in
terested, your best bet is to pay attention to
the newsgroup "alt.raves."
If you are privileged with a car, "alt.raves"
will provide listings to various regular par

ties as well as "specials" that cater to the deep
trance, house, acid jazz and techno-mon
gers. One party to look for is the Bulletproof
Boat Party, a three-hour cruise on the Bay
the first Sunday of the month. This is cus
tomarily followed by an after-party (with
complimentary Caribbean food) at Miss
Pearl's Jam House. The cost is around 20
bucks — pricey, but definitely worth it for
practically a whole day of partying.
For musical and dancing opportunities of
a completely different type, several great
shows are playing during spring break:
Seven Year Bitch plays at the Bottom of
the Hill on March 25. Let's Go Bowling and
No Doubt will be at the Great American
Music Hall at 9 p.m. on March 27. Pantera
with Type O Negative are doing an all-ages
show at the San Jose State Events Center on
March 30. Morphine plays at the Great
American Music Hall on March 31. Also that
day, Swingin' Utters, The Lowdowns and the
Wrong Way Right are at Nightbreak, and
M.I.R.V. with Flesh Weapons and Boris Dig
will be at New George's.
These are just a smattering of concert op
tions — pay attention to concert listings on
KZSU or in the papers.
I've listed innumerable amounts of infor
mation — enough items with which to
fill a week, no doubt. The fun stuff "out
there" in the Bay Area is there for the taking.
Go out and get some. It's Spring — daylight
savings is in effect — it's about time.
As Paul Theroux reflected: w ... the best
landscapes, [either] dense or fruitless, hold
surprises if they are studied patiently, in the
kind of discomfort one can savor afterward."
There's no reprieve from a barren spring
break filled with acutely unsavory discom
fort if you sit around and pretend that an
empty campus allows you to contemplate
the beauty of life.
So get out there and just do it.

The Exploratorium: $8.50 for adults.
