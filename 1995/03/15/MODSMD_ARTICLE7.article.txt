# Language division runs well, profs say
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Faculty members were concerned about los
ing their autonomy when the creation of a new
Division of Literature, Culture and Language
was first proposed last year.
But more than halfway through its first
year the division is running smoothly, said pro
fessors in the foreign language departments,
although they cautioned that it is too early to
give a final verdict on the division.
The division brings together representa
tives of the six language departments —
French and Italian, Spanish and Portuguese,

German Studies, Asian Languages, Slavic Lan
guages and Literatures and Comparative Lit
erature — along with two at-large members to
form an executive committee. Each depart
ment is still run independently.
"This is an experiment to see if these six rel
atively small departments can enhance their
functioning by having a kind of shared struc
ture," said Spanish Prof. Mary Pratt.
Because the foreign language and literature
departments are small, she said, a collective
voice may be necessary to further the depart
ments' agendas.
"What we're finding out very positively,"
Pratt added, "is that indeed as a group we are

able to defend our shared interest much more
effectively through this committee."
The division's voice helped convince the
University to strengthen its foreign language
requirement standards, she said, and it has
also aided in the protection of the foreign lan
guage focus houses.
While the cooperative structure has worked
well so far, said French Prof. Ralph Hester,
chair of the French and Italian Department,
"it's a little too early to give a very meaningful
opinion."
The division came out of a notion among ad-
ministrators that "there would be
good reasons for the departments
to seek some means of collabora
tion and that this collaboration
could be formalized in one way or
anther," Hester said.
A task force last year explored
a variety of structures that might
work for the foreign language
programs and "this is the one
that emerged as the most viable
way," he said.
When the idea was first pre
sented, "there were lots of appre
hensions," Hester said. "The fac
ulty were concerned that their
departments might in fact be
swallowed up into a larger entity
that would cause them to lose
their own identity."
Last year "basically the entire
faculty, staff and graduate stu
dents from the foreign language
departments ... expressed great
worries about the loss of autono

my that this might bring with it,"
said German Prof. Orrin Robin
son.
Richard Schupbach, a profes
sor in the Department of Slavic
Languages and Literatures, said
he was concerned about the new
division but "it's working very
well. I'm surprised. It is an addi
tional layer of bureaucracy that's
been superimposed on us, but it
has worked very well," he said.
Although he said he remains
optimistic, the division is not yet
home free, Schupbach said. "The
next month or two will be criti
cal," he said. "I'm hoping that
reason will prevail."
By the end of this academic
year, the University plans to hire
a director for a new Language
Center, where research and train
ing in language instruction will be
coordinated. The director will
have a strong impact on the divi
sion, he said.
One positive sign is that "all
the people that we have inter
viewed thus far have felt very
strongly that the existence of
individual departments is abso

lutely crucial to the functioning of
the foreign language center,"
Schupbach said.
"On the other hand," he added,
"we have seen some 'thought
pieces' that have been produced
by those folks on high, and they
approach this job in a very differ
ent manner. They basically think
all the foreign languages should
be under [the control of] one indi
vidual who is the director of the
center."
Neither the director of the
Language Center nor the execu
tive committee of the language
division should have too much
power, Robinson said.
Discussion of how to handle
faculty promotions and appoint
ments arose recently and the
German Studies Department has
spoken out against the executive
committee playing an overpower
ing role in such decisions, he
said.
Robinson said he is concerned
that "the executive committee
[would be able to] in principle
sink an appointment or sink a
reappointment for insufficient

reason even if a department
wanted it. There are definitely
dangers as well as benefits to the
divisional structure."
Still, "it really is good for the
foreign literature (departments)
to talk with each other about
things they have in common —
like how do we teach foreign lan
guages and how do we support
the foreign language enterprise
here at Stanford," Robinson
added.
Schupbach said he began this
year with an open mind about the
new structure.
"I was told that we were to
think up sort of a new mission
and bring ourselves into the 21st
century," he said. "Maybe that's
exactly where we're going. But if
it is no more than a means of
homogenizing the foreign lan
guage departments at Stanford, I
think it will be a terrible mis
take."
So far, however, the executive
committee "really has been
great," he said. "I expected all hell
to break loose and it has not hap
pened. It looks like a success."
