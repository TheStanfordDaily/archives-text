# Juliana's high hat tricks
## 
### 
Appreciating Juliana Hatfield has every
thing to do with how much you're willing to
let her get away with. Where one hipster
hears cutesy, cloying candy floss, another
finds quick wit and a subtle sense of humor
which play off and play up the perfect pop
on the surface. Depending on the point of
view, Hatfield is either the caricature ot the
woman-child who doesn't know what she
wants or a clever performer who makes and

"Only Everything"
Juliana Hatfield

breaks the rock cliche. Even better, maybe
she's both, the latter because she has mas
tered the former.
Hatfield sticks to what got her there on
her new album "Only Everything." Edgier at
some moments and gooier at others, the ex
tremes and everything in between capture
the same deceptive vulnerability that's the
trademark of her tunes. Hatfield herself de
scribes her craft best on the flitty little num
ber "My Darling:" sweet on the outside, but
bitter on the inside.
"Only Everything" stands as the richest
musical piece of Hatfield's hat trick, a

nice sidekick for her obsessively enchanting
opus "Hey Babe" and an improvement on her
last go-round, the better-than-average "be
come What You Are." The first single, "I'ni
versal Heartbeat," is a nice variation on the
main theme, its burn and-crash guitar riffs
and a sna/./y bit of organ in the back moving
the song along briskly. Her smooth but
squeaky voice croons confidently, breaking
off and building up to pull off the sappy lyric s
with the straightest of poker faces. "What a
Life" and "C)K. OK." keep up the pace, pulling
their punches with hit and-run verses and
some chug-chug-chugging.
While Hatfield's previous efforts were
carried by her vocals, her improved guitar
work emerges as an equal partner on the
best cuts. The faux-Nirvana buzz-and
whine sets the mood on the endearingly
goofy "Dumb Fun," as punk as Hatfield has
gotten this side of her Blake Babies experi
ence. And it wouldn't be a surprise if guitar
deity J Mascis ghost-played "Simplicity Is
Beautiful," with its warm, fuzzy Dinosaur
Jr.-lite soundscape.
As on every Hatfield album, there are the
embarrassing moments to take with the pre
cious ones. "Congratulations" starts with
some gibberish about a jelly roll and "Fleur
de Lys" is sung in French, both leaving the
listener puzzled about the song and the

songwriter behind it. "Live on Tomor
row" — especially its chorus of "A

heartbeat says you haven't died /
You've gotta try to stay alive" —
finds Hatfield at her most un
bearably saccharine.
But it's not so hard to take
the winces and grimaces in stride,
because there are a lot more ner
vous smiles and happy frowns

served up on "Only Everything." Like
it or not, that's what indulgent pop is and
what Juliana Hatfield does really well.
