## Pavement and Sebadoh served up on the side for a day 
### 
A tew months ago, while Sebadoh and
Pavement were at the center of swirls of
indie media attention, members of those
hands needed someplace to unwind, a
place to try new things and just have fun.

"Take a look inside the
Folk Implosion"
Folk Implosion
"Hospital for the
Chemically Insane"
Gary Young

In the midst of all the hubbub, Se
badoh's Lou Barlow found time to play
with the Folk Implosion, and original
Pavement drummer Gary Young went solo.
The Folk Implosion is comprised of
Barlow and former Palace Brother John
Davis. And while it's natural to try to com
pare this band to Sebadoh or the Palace
Brothers, the Folk Implosion doesn't
sound much like either. In fact, there's real
ly nothing at all folksy about the band.
With 14 songs in 22 minutes, "Take a
Look Inside the Folk Implosion" is a fast
paced charge of innovative pop. From start
to finish, Barlow and Davis unleash dusty
but tasty melodies with a spontaneous and
direct appeal.
There are occasional glimmers of Bar
low's trademark sentimentality, but the
Folk Implosion specializes in ticklish, light
headed musical energy. Songs like "Slap

Me" and "Sputnik's Down' arc the quick
and springy guitar tracks that would be too
breezy to fit on a Sebadoh album.
Others recall a more laid-back take on
the semi-acoustic brainstorming of "Se
badoh III." "To me it's just really easy lis
tening and really fun, but still kind of
gutsy," Barlow said in a recent interview.
"John and I just don't have any pressures
(with this album)."
The lack of pressure shows, as "Take a
Look Inside the Folk Implosion" remains
free and relaxed, reckless and sloppy, yet
still oddly focused.
Even more loose and less focused is Gary
Young's debut "Hospital." In fact, Young is
about as unfocused as it gets.
The album skips from pointless acoustic
rambling to spacey Red Krayola-like exper
imentation, from perfect pop to mixed-up
punk, with it's only shred of continuity
lying in Young's obsession with inconsis
tency. Simultaneously impressive and un
deniably stupid, "Hospital" is a great
album that lots of people are sure to hate.
In both "Hospital for the Chemically In
sane" and "Missing In Action," Young re
peats, "Am I criminal / Am I insane / Am I
chemical / Am I insane?" When you hear
the ridiculous mess of "Ralph the Vegetari
an Robot" or hokey nonsense of "Plant
Man," you wonder as well.
But Young is just having fun, playing
music from the depths of his imagination,
where maybe vegetarian robots and plant
men really mean something.
