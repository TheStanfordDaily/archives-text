# Green with envy proves to be Wax's unlucky color
## 
### 
Wax's new album provides some interest
ing insights into the mind of a marketing ex
ecutive at a major label. Here we have a band
from L.A. that plays punky pop that's cuddlier
than Green Day with a singer who looks like
Anthony Keidis' younger brother and a gui
tarist who bears a passing resemblance to
Ministry's Al Jourgensen. That has nothing to
do with the music, but what would a market
ing exec care? From his point of view, Wax is a
hot prospect for success in today's post-Green
Day alternative rock universe.
So what about the music, anyway? Well,
"13 Unlucky Numbers" occasionally snags

"13 Unlucky Numbers"
Wax

the listener's ear with a catchy riff, but overall,
I get the feeling that this album was rushed to
stores to capitalize on Green Day-mania. The
result is a spotty album marked by immature
songwriting skills.
This isn't entirely Wax's fault, however.
The band showed promise on their first
album "What Else Can We Do," and their

sophomore effort naturally doesn't quite
measure up. For all my complaining, 1 should
admit that "Who Is Next" is a ripping, pound
ing fun-fest, "Torn In Two" features a cool Su
perchunky riff and "Jiffy Boy" is a pleasant,
rolling acoustic number. Besides that, howev
er, the rest of "13 Unlucky Numbers" is large
ly hit-and-miss; parts of songs are cool, but
never whole songs. "In Spite Of Me" is ruined
by off-key singing; "Settle Down" is down
right irritating. "Knot," a wimpy, short
acoustic number, is thrown onto the end of
the album, after which there are three empty
tracks. Why, do you ask? Well, apparently,

Wax only wrote 10 real songs, and since the
name of the album is "13 Unlucky Numbers"
... you get the picture. A pretty cruel trick to
play on someone who bought the album ex
pecting 13 songs and getting nine-and-a-half.
All in all, this is a pretty unspectacular
album. To make matters worse, the extrane
ous studio noise thrown in to make "13 Un
lucky Numbers" sound more "raw" instead
gives it a false ring due to the sterile produc
tion. Wax needs more time to work on their
song writing, and then maybe they'll be ready
to put out an album that they can be proud of.
