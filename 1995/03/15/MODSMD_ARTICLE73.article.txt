# Morrissey matures under the moon of a new World
## 
### 
The world of Morrissey is one of longing,
desire and delirium. In the fourteen tracks of
this album, the former lead singer of The
Smiths has created his own dimension that
one is to enter with caution.
Morrissey isn't very nice about what he
feels. Never one to sing quietly about his emo
tions, he expresses them loudly, extending
each moan and each cry tor as long as his vocal
range will allow.
I he songs have a delirious quality to them
that create an image of heads spinning. What
Morrissey achieves here is a sense of constant
circular motion — repeated, extended notes
echo in the background, and words are sung
over and over again. Morrissey creates a sensa
tion of movement through repeated, circular

rhythm. The result: The songs provoke the
uneasy sensation of spinning.
But it's an understatement of Morrisseys
craft to call them merely "songs," for these are
musical manifestations of an artist's angst and
desire. They are also very "visually" stimulat
ing. With his perfect control over the idea of
motion in music, Morrissey creates tracks that
easily provide the listener mental visions —
hands touching, faces approaching and re
t reating, feet walking away — his songs are the
musical equivalent of a turning kaleidoscope.
The best of the bunch is "Moon River," a
heart-breaking version of the Henry Mancini
classic. In it, Morrissey captures the essence of
innocent love trapped in a loveless world. His
voice makes it an instant anthem for dreamers

and other romantics chasing an ideal of pure,
perfect love. "Moon River" happens as quick
ly as a dream — one you wake up from feeling
sad, lonely and terribly aware of someone's ab
sence from your bed. The quietest song on the
album, Morrissey comes across as the quintes
sential tortured, misunderstood loner.
Morrissey's lyrics are not nearly as intrigu
ing as his music. For a self-proclaimed poet
("Sister, I'm a Poet" is one of the songs), Mor
rissey needs to do better than "I took my job
application into town / Didja hear they turned
me down?" ("Hilly Budd"). And he's also unin
spired with names, as in "You're the One For
Me, Fatty." Fatty? Why not Beth, or Suma? The
simplicity of his lyrics only works when he ex
presses longing, as in the sad repetition of the

"World of Morrissey"
Morrissey

words "I give up" in "My Love Life."
Complaining about his lyrics, however, is a
petty thing to do when you have an album as
rich and exciting as this. Morrissey sings
music that is fun to scream along with. His
songs are festive and sad, melodic and dis
jointed, good and very good. It's almost hallu
cinogenic, like something that you'd expect to
hear in the background of a wild mating ritu
al in which a virgin is sacrificed. In this case,
what is sacrificed is any self-pity or self-im
portance, as Morrissey celebrates, rather than
denigrates, a culture of longing and loving.
