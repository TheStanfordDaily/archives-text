## Elastica — welcome the next wave in the British invasion 
### 
It's like the boy who cried wolf. From one
invasion to the next, the British have been
coming and will keep on coming, those hip
and-hyped bands who continually try to make
a dent in the Americentric alt-rock world. But
all the hip and hype remain that if you don't
know any better: It's easy to confuse the bands
because yesterday was a Blur and tomorrow is
only an Oasis. As the saying goes, a Stone Rose
by any other name is still the same.
Elastica is the

next installment
in a never-end
ing series, the
current "biggest
thing since" with
a couple of chart

"Elastica"
Elastica

topping singles back home and not much
else.
More than anything, the circus surround
ing this quartet typifies the frenzied,
fetishized tastes of the British music scene:
Considering that singer / guitarist Justine
Frischmann was once a member of Suede
and that the foursome has been in court for
copping substantial chunks from other
groups, Elastica seems more a BBC soap
opera than a bunch of musicians.

To its credit, Elastica comes close to step
ping out of the muck of its own myth. The
band's self-titled debut struts freshly and fu
riously, a Brit outfit with a melodramatic
snarl rather than a melodramatic whine.
Bustling numbers like "All-Nighter" and
"Annie" get to the point quickly, the bass
bounding and the guitars lashing.
"Stutter," the band's first single way back
when, is another standout, chugging some
where fast with Frischmann's impatient vo
cals leading the way. As Frischmann puts it in
the band bio N "I want the best bits, verse-cho
rus, verse-chorus, that's it."
Still, Elastica's shtick fails to satisfy. In the
end, there's less to say about the band's music
than the band itself. Sure, the best bits are on
display, but they come and go and begin to
sound all the same. And when the quartet
takes a tune past the two-and-a-half minute
mark, the flaws become all the more appar
ent. "Waking Up" drags on, a three minute
pop song that should've cut off halfway
through.
If taking on the hype and staring it down
were enough, Elastica would be a success. It's
not, so Elastica isn't quite.
