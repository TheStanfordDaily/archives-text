# Damage does enough to itself

### 
Steve Morse's new album, "Structura
Damage," is a sorry affair. As Shakespeare
might say, "it is a tale told by an idiot, full o
sound and fury, signifying nothing."
An entirely instrumental album, "Struc
tural Damage" emphasizes the weaknesses o
rock virtuoso extremism. While the playing
is immaculate, the music's lack of depth anc
originality destroy the albums intentions.

"Stuctural Damage"
Steve Morse Band

Steve Morse's career reaches back to the
'70s, and Guitar Player's magazine's reader
poll voted him "Best Overall Guitarist" five
years in a row, but the only conclusion one
can draw from this album is that the readers
have exceedingly poor taste.
While trying to display versatility by imi
tating many different musical styles, Morse's
work becomes the musical equivalent of cold
stew, presenting as many different styles as

possible in the least appealing form.
Morse's basic problem is that his compo
sitions offer no sense of growth or develop
ment. Every song follows the same structure:
a theme is presented and repeated over and
over and over again. There is no noticeable
change in dynamics, tempo or even key.
In fact, the entire disc seems to be written
in major keys, and while the intention was
surely to create an "uplifting" album, the ef
fect is to alienate anyone looking for emo
tional depth in Morse's music.
Not only is the writing boring, but the
music is inexcusably unoriginal. The album
sounds like the soundtrack to an '80s film.
Whether he realizes it or not, Steve Morse
is encountering the inescapable fact that rock
was never intended to be a purely instru
mental art form. The only possible way to es
cape this is to adopt the viewpoint of tradi
tional composers. The songs need structure,
meaning and development.
Without such an approach, the results are
repetitive and uninteresting. The appeal of
jamming is severely limited.
