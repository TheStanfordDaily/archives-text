Alternative-rock of late is spitting up a lot of
bands with blues roots that give the tired-out
formulae a good swift kick in the seat of the
pants. Royal Trux plays slurry, muddy Rolling-
Stoncs-bascd rock; the John Spencer Blues Ex
plosion channels the swingin' spirit of Elvis
with a down 'n' dirty attitude; Mule roars its
particular brand of inbred backwater swamp
stomp. By contrast, Clawhammer likes its blues
bashed out with punkish fervor. Wired and

"Thank The
Holder Uppers"
Clawhammer

ready to wreck, "Thank The Holder Uppers"
careens furiously like a car full of drunks.
Songs on "Thank The Holder Uppers" are
long hut contain enough changes and pure
guitar know-how to keep the listener involved
throughout the album. Bad Religion alumnus
and Epitaph head Brett Gurewitz keeps the
production to a raw minimum, allowing the
guitars to fall all over one another. Clawham
mer also throws in some sax, harmonica and
piano for nood measure. This new addition

improves them. Previous efforts on Epitaph
came off as bland and monochrome, a punkish
barrage. Here, songs are more bluesy but retain
the energetic, ragged edge.
"Superthings" and "Sweaty Palms" get the
beer and blood flowing from the start with
jagged blues rifling and a nasty bar-brawl atti
tude. "Five Fifths Dead" opens with a mellow
piano-sax-and-spoken-word bit, exploding
into a rockin'-good time. "Bums on the Flow,"
a slower, stumbling song, would be great to
hear in concert after several drinks with the
guys. Hopefully you get the point. There aren't
many places to catch your breath on "Thank
The Holder Uppers;" most of the songs have
about as much subtlety as a fist in the face.
The only flaw in Clawhammer is frontman
Jon Wahls vocals. Imagine a singer whinier
than Billy Corgan and Moonshake's David
Callahan put together and you have an idea of
his sound. Wahl screeches through "Thank the
Holder Uppers" like fingernails on a black
board. His voice makes or breaks the album;
you'll either think it works wonderfully or you
won't be able to stand it. It's a great album, but
preview Clawhammer before you buy it to see
if you can stand Wahl's voice.
