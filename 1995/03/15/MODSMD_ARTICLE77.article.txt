# Take a break for 'Outbreak'
## 
### 
"The single biggest threat to man's con
tinued dominance on the planet is the virus,"
according to a Nobel Laureate quoted in the
beginning of "Outbreak." However, it a two
hour struggle between humankind and a
protein-encased piece of nucleic acid doesn't
appeal to you, don't worry — director Wolf
gang Petersen ("In the Line of Fire") keeps
laboratory scenes to a minimum while re
vealing a fascinating conspiracy plot.
It all begins back in 1967, when .in un
known disease is plaguing a remote merce
nary camp in Zaire's Motaba River Valley.

Outbreak

Nearly 30 years later, .1 monkey carrying the
Motaba virus makes its way to the United
States, where it infects the owner of a pet
shop in the fictional town of Gedar Creek,
Calif. I he army is called in to quarantine the
area while Col. Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoff
man) and his estranged wife Robby (Rene
Russo) search for the origin of the virus
and a vaccine.

They need to move fast. Maj. Gen. Mc-
Clintock (Donald Sutherland), one of the
doctors that witnessed the results of the 1%7
outbreak, has presidential authorization to
do whatever it takes to elimfriate the virus.
And Gen. Billy Ford (Morgan Freeman), Mc-
Clintock's lieutenant, doesn't appear to be
willing to stop him.
Fortunately, Daniels is. The helicopter
chase that follows is what makes "Outbreak"
more than interesting medical drama. In
cluding a high-speed pursuit down a riverbed
and .1 firelight, this footage is fantastic cine
matography. Still, this isn't just .111 action flick
— there are some pretty cool scenes in the
lab, notably the seamless opening sequence
which guides the moviegoer through the four
bio-safety labs that house the Army's infec
tious diseases research institute.
Save the strained scenes that focus on
their deteriorating marriage, Hoffman and
Kusso turn in strong performances. Freeman
was also (. Ast well as the bad but redeemable
General Ford, who must decide what comes
first — American lives or national security.
With several plot twists, "Outbreak"
keeps moviegoers 011 their toes if they are
willing to suspend belief a couple of hours.
