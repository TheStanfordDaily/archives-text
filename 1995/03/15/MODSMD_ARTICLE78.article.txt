# For love of music, not reality

If you have an uncontrollable passion for
the juxtaposition of film with classical music,
"Immortal Beloved," will fulfill those desires.
If, however, you want an accurate representa
tion of Ludwig von Beethoven's life and ca
reer, "Immortal Beloved" is not the movie to
see.
Don't misinterpret my criticism though.

Immortal
Beloved

The movie,
written and di
rected by
Bert rand Rice, is
quite a drama,
and won't dis
please you. The

story of the life of Beethoven (played by Gary
Oldman), unfolded during his secretary's
quest to settle his estate, "Immortal Beloved"
has it all: mystery, flashbacks, abuse, passion,
family quarrels, intrigue and jealousy. The
action keeps you anxiously awaiting the next
scene throughout the course of the movie.
Music director George Solti also adds to
the movie's attractions as he skillfully inter
twines the beauty of Beethoven's music with
the action and emotion in the film.

unfortunately, writer / director Bertrand
Rice does occasionally underestimate the in
tuitive skills of the viewer. However, this does
not outweigh the good attributes of the film.
What I can't overlook, however, is Rice's
misrepresentation of key facts in Beethoven's
life — the main plot of the movie suffers from
historical inaccuracies. Unfortunately, the
average movie attendee leaves with a distort
ed picture of Beethoven's life, such as the
claim that Beethoven's adopted son was in
fact his biological son.
The viewer does learn some important
facts about Beethoven — particularly con
cerning the nature of his temperamental
character and his relationship with his music
— but would never be able to differentiate
between the false and true aspects of the
movie.
Admittedly, you'll be happy that you went
as you hum the "Ninth Symphony" on the
drive home. However, if never exposed to the
life of Beethoven, after seeing "Immortal
Beloved" you'll leave the theater with a very
skewed impression of the composer.
