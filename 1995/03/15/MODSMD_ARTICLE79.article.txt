## Acceptance adds up to a worthwhile Sum 
### 
"Your (Iran said it once, I've never for
gotten it, the greatest explorers of all, she
said, .ire the explorers of the human heart."
lew would venture to call Harry
Mitchell (Jack Thompson) a regular
Aussie dad by any standards. The inspira
tional words above repeated by Harry to
his gay son Jeff (Russell Crowe) serve also
as a beautiful homage to his widowed
mother, an unapologetic "explorer" of
sorts who had shared the remaining 40
years of her life with her lesbian compan
ion Mary.
Jaded queens out there may beg to dif-

for, but there is
something de
lightfully deviant
about a gay film
like "The Sum of
Us," that instead of

The Sum
of Us

fixating upon the existential angst of its
lavender hero, elects to appoint a comical
ly tolerant patriarch as its flag-waving
spokesperson.
For one, in attempting to reason out his
son's sexual orientation, old Harry, solely
entrusted with Jeff's upbringing since his
wife's death, figures that the trait has mere
ly skipped a generation. Soon enough, a
whirlwind database-generated romance
with an attractive widow substantiates
Harry's claim to his lady-killing prowess.
lor all of I larry's best intentions, his in
terest in Jeff's social life proves meddle
some at times — like offering porn rags to
Cireg, a gardener whom Jeff brings home
one evening, so as to help the two lads "get
going." Unfortunately, Harry's accepting
gestures trigger off sharp pangs ofguilt in
Greg, who has yet to come out to his fami
ly and is unable to deal with the idea of a
supportive father.
Screenwriter David Stevens ("Breaker
Morant") and co-director Kevin Dowling
have wisely kept up with their partnership,

off-Broadway success of "The Sum of Us"
which was originally an intimate father
son play.
The makers' familiarity with and pas
sion for the material manifest themselves
in the film's seamless marriage of text and
image — the most evocative example of
which is surely the intricately interwoven
black-and-white flashbacks to Gran and
Mary's remarkable and dignified life to
gether, ending with poignant words of
farewell as failing health cruelly necessi
tates their separation.
Clearly, the decision to cast Thompson
and Crowe, the two foremost Australian
icons of masculinity in their respective
generations, appears somewhat calculated
to legitimate a progressive cause with their
celebrity status. Nonetheless, their in
volvement succeeds handsomely in decon
structing the old-school fey aesthetic
which defined a thankfully closed chapter
of queer film characters.
Next to Thompson's energetic turn as
the irrepressibly all-knowing PFLAG par
ent, the immensely likable Crowe under
plays Jeff, a plumber who indulges in ama
teur football on the side. Gay male mythol
ogy is exploded with a bang though, as Jeff
informs the audience that big, butch de
meanors amount to painfully little in bed
from his own experience.
Now who said well-meaning niceness
was incompatible with cultural subver
sion?
