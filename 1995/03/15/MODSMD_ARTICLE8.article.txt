Most 16-year-olds worry
about sitting next to one judge as
they attempt to get their driver's
licenses. But thousands of judges
scrutinized Stanford freshman
Heidi Hau's every move as she
played piano for a packed audi
ence in Carnegie Hall two years
ago.
Hau has continued to play for
enormous audiences even after
coming to the Farm. As one of the
youngest winners of the Philhar
monic Association's annual
Soloist Competition, Hau was
the featured pianist with the Palo
Alto Philharmonic Orchestra
last Saturday.

"Although the Philharmonic
has had young soloists in the
past, Heidi's piano talent is far
from ordinary for her age," Palo
Alto Philharmonic board mem
ber Dorothy Reller said.
Hau was selected to perform
with the Palo Alto Philharmonic
after a rigorous competition with
talented pianists from all over
the United States. The competi
tion involved sending an audio
tape of a piano performance to
judges, after which Hau was se
lected as one of six finalists. She
won the competition after play
ing for a panel of judges at the
Palo Alto Cultural Center.
