Most 16-year-olds worry
about sitting next to one judge as
they attempt to get their driver's
licenses. But thousands of judges
scrutinized Stanford freshman
Heidi Hau's every move as she
played piano for a packed audi
ence in Carnegie Hall two years
ago.
Hau has continued to play for
enormous audiences even after
coming to the Farm. As one of the
youngest winners of the Philhar
monic Association's annual
Soloist Competition, Hau was
the featured pianist with the Palo
Alto Philharmonic Orchestra
last Saturday.

"Although the Philharmonic
has had young soloists in the
past, Heidi's piano talent is far
from ordinary for her age," Palo
Alto Philharmonic board mem
ber Dorothy Reller said.
Hau was selected to perform
with the Palo Alto Philharmonic
after a rigorous competition with
talented pianists from all over
the United States. The competi
tion involved sending an audio
tape of a piano performance to
judges, after which Hau was se
lected as one of six finalists. She
won the competition after play
ing for a panel of judges at the
Palo Alto Cultural Center.

Freshman Heidi Hau's piano expertise has taken her to New York's
Carnegie Hall.
"The competition evoked a lot
of nervous excitement that I chan
neled into my performance," Hau
said. "I wasn't sure if I was going
to win, but I was going to give it
my all and enjoy the experience."
Hau said she was attracted to
Stanford's reputable music
department as well as to its aca
demic resources when she was
considering schools last year.

"Stanford seemed like a place
where I could have it all — a great
academic and musical education,"
Hau said.
Throughout her piano career,
Hau has received numerous
awards, including first prizes in
the 1989 California Soloist Com
petition of the California Music
Teachers' Association and the Sil
ver Lake International Piano
Concerto Competition in Wiscon
sin. She has also won accolades in
the 1990 Piano Competition for
the Soviet / American Youth Fes
tival of Music in New York and
subsequently performed at

Carnegie Recital Hall in 1991 and
1992.
Hau said one of her highest
emotional moments was her first
performance at Carnegie Hall.
"The excitement to play at such a
reputable music center created a
new sense of musical enjoyment
for me," Hau said. "And to this day
it still inspires me to pursue a pro
fessional career as a concert
pianist."
A native of nearby Los Altos,
Hau said she owes much of her
musical success to her teacher,
Erna Gulabyan, whose piano
expertise and emotional encour

agement have been intrinsic to
Hau's development for over a half
dozen years.
"I see Erna as a second mother
to me for she is a teacher not just
in piano, but in other aspects of life
as well," Hau said.
Hau has been playing the piano
since she was four. She said she
attributes her early starting age to
her two older brothers, who are
dual pianists and who inspired her
to pursue her musical capabilities.
Hau gave her first solo recital at
age 10 at her church in Los Altos.
"It was during my first perfor
mance that I realized how much I

loved performing," Hau said, "I
realized I wanted to do this for the
rest of my life."
During Saturday's concert,
Heidi performed the Liszt Piano
Concerto No. 1 in E flat major.
The Philharmonic concert also
included Beethoven's Fidelio
Overture and Berlioz's Symphonie
Fantastique.
Although she is busy with her
academic responsibilities — she is
interested in majoring in both
music and English — Hau said she
still manages to And time to prac
tice piano and entertain her dorm
mates.
