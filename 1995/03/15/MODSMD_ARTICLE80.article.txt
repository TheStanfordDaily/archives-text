# The 						web of Martha and Ethel is woven with feminine grace

### 
In the middle of "Martha & Ethel," Bette
Davis appears and delivers a monologue
about "the career of being a woman" — a bit
of a shocker in an otherwise very straight
documentary style portrait of two nannies
and the families that hired them.

But if "Martha
& Ethel" has a
theme that binds
its elements to
gether — pho
tographs, footage
of the subjects,

Martha
& Ethel

newsreel clips, interviews, music, a German
storybook — it is the experience of being a
woman more than the career of beinga nanny.
An aptly-timed visit by director Jyll John
stone to childhood friend Barbara Ettinger,
currently a graduate student at Stanford, cat
alyzed the idea of chronicling the lives of
their respective nannies, Martha Kniefel and
Ethel Edwards. The result of five years of re
search and production turns out to be an in
tricate character sketch of two families, of
which Martha and Ethel were and continue
to be very much a part.
While husbands, fathers and sons do fig
ure into the equation, "Martha & Ethel" fo
cuses primarily on its female subjects —

nannies, mothers and daughters — ulti
mately depicting the evolving role of women
from the '40s to the present through the long
tenures and memories of Martha and Ethel.
In the recollections of the mothers, nan
nies and children, we see not only the ten
sions caused by introducing "replacement"
caregivers for mothers but also the unforgiv
ing demands placed on women of all classes
and ethnic backgrounds.
Martha, a refugee of Hitler's Germany, de
scribes how after her husband died, she did
not want to remarry so her only real option
was to go to baby-nursing school. Ethel recalls
that she was able to sit in "white" sections of
restaurants as a black woman hired by a white
family, but that she always "knew her place."
Finally, "Martha & Ethel" offers an often
tender, often disturbing account of two
women who gave up lives and families of
their own to become "mothers," and, con
versely, two women who gave up mother
hood for responsibility to outside families.
And at the center of these complex rela
tionships stand two other women — film
makers Johnstone and Ettinger — who skill
fully offer us an intimate look into an in
tensely personal part of their lives.
