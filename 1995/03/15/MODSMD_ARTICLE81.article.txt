# Clever, beautiful 'Exotica' skimps on female characters

Exotic: Introduced from another country:
not native to the place where found; out
landish, alien; strikingly or excitingly differ
ent or unusual; of or related to striptease.
"Exotica," Atom Egoyan's new thriller,
meditates on themes of jealousy, guilt and
alienation by housing them within the con-

text of the exotic.
Club Exotica is a
dark underworld
where erotic music
plays, beautiful
naked women
dance, wealthy
men watch and the

seductive French voice of the M(' urges them
(Mi to new and ever-changing delights.
Zoe (Arsinee Khanjian), the pregnant
owner of Fxotica, Fric (Flias Koteas), its
alienated MC and Francis (Bruce Green

wood), a tormented tax collector, all orbit
around the elusive Christina (Mia Kirshner),
a school girl-turned-stripper in a fascinating
constellation of relationships.
These aren't the only people to find them
selves caught up in Exotica's web. Thomas
(Don McKellar) — a pet shop owner with a
penchant for exotic birds and darkly-com
plected companions— is also sucked into the
fray when Francis comes to audit him.
Vivid snatches of each characters past arc
intercut, adding depth to the story's glittery
surface. As the elliptical narrative progresses,
these memories interweave, each piece fitting
like a jigsaw puzzle, until a frightening and
tragic backstory becomes apparent.
While Canadian director Egoyan is an ex
pert at narrative (reconstruction and manip
ulation, psychology is not his strong point.
His characters, hopelessly obsessed with one

thing or another, often speak in didactic
monologues. And while we get a good idea of
how the men of Exotica arrived at this point,
the women remain completely shrouded.
Now this would not always be a problem,
but when most of the women on screen are
naked, they beg for a little more humanity.
Unfortunately, Christina, the ultimate object
of'desire, is left as just that. She strips, she teas
es, she throws tantrums, and then repeats the
cycle anew. On the other hand, Eric, Francis,
and even gay character Thomas, are all re
vealed through their interactions with her.
"F.xotica," is a clever story. It is well
planned, well-executed and beautifully shot.
But by the end of the film you're left with the
distinct impression that, for almost two hours,
you've simply watched the bodies of several
naked women and a few disturbed men.
