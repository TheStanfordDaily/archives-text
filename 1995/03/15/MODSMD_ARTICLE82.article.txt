# Go look out a 'Window to Paris'
## 
### 
If you're in the mood for a light-hearted
comedy with beautiful scenery and cultural
faux pas, then go see "Window to Paris" at a
movie screen window near you.
In a St. Petersburg apartment, Russian
tenants find a magical window which allows
them to teleport Star Trek-like to the cafe
lined streets of Paris. The movie illustrates the
conflict between money-grubbing wishes
and cultural exchange.
The main character, Nikolai (Sergei Don
stov), is an out-of-place aesthetics teacher in
a converted Russian business high school
who leads his students to class like the Pied
Piper. When transported to Paris, Nikolai re
jects material ventures for more soulful activ
ities, like visiting local cultural sights.
Meanwhile, Nikolai's uncouth neighbors
led by the chubby Gorokhov (Viktor
Mikhailov) use the window as a vehicle tor

acquiring wealth, even stealing a Citroen and
storing it inside their apartment. The looting
Russians constantly terrorize their French
neighbor Nicole (Agnes Soral) by trashing
her apartment. When Nicole accidentally en
ters the window, she sees a Petersburg raging
with crime, corruption and chaos. Asa victim
of chaos, she ends up in prison and Nikolai
saves her by bluffing she's Edith Piaf on tour.
Director Yuri Mamin explores the won
derful possibilities of a surreal gateway which
connects two disparate cities. Memorable
images include the school's walls plastered
with capitalist ideals like "Time is Money" in
five languages, or the Russians in folk cos
tumes selling their wares on Paris streets.
Donstov plays the slightly quirky, and later
lovestruck, musician brilliantly. And Soral is
charming as the typical Parisian female
artiste. Hut Mikhailov as the object-grubbing,

Window to Paris

vodka-swigging bozo often steals the show.
At the end, when the window closes, the
Russians choose to return home and improve
Russia in order to leave behind Paris' superfi
ciality. As a minor character notes, "the
French want spectacle... I remember in my
small Petersburg apartment, we would talk
about fine arts, the fate of Russia, and (iod."
Yet, once they return to Petersburg, Nikolai
thinks he has found another magical window
— and the tenants are intent on uncovering it.
So the last scene leaves you feeling that they re
gret their choice to return to Russia.
Unfortunately, this ambiguous ending
makes the film fall where it otherwise succeeds.
