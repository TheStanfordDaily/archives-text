It's Friday night, and you're bored out of
your mind. My suggestion? CXirl up on the
couch with some Orville Redenbacher and
the remote control, and check out some of
the new movie releases now on video.
Columbia Picture's "Wolf," starring Jack
and Michelle, gets a definite thumbs up. The
talented, sexy Pfeiffer and the talented (and
well, not so sexy) Nicholson have wonderful
chemistry in this strangely eerie, fantastic
fairy-tale-turned-nightmare of a film.
James Spader and Christopher Plummer
add crackling tension to the already electric
dynamics between Pfeiffer and Nicholson.
The word "cute" sums up Paramount's
"Milk Money." Melanie Griffith plays a
prostitute named V, who stirs up trouble in
suburbia when a young boy, Frank (Michael
Patrick Carter), brings her home to marry
his unsuspecting dad (Ed Harris). The ro
mantic interlude is light, comic and sweet in
its simplicity. However, the film gets a little
ridiculous when V's pimp comes to town in
search of his thousands of dollars in drug
money. Not a horrible film, but not worth
the three dollars at Blockbuster.
United Artist's "Sleep with Me" is a pseu
do-artsy film that you've probably never
heard of, with good reason. "Sleep with Me"
attempts to be original with a screenplay
created by six different writers, each con
tributing a scene. The plot is pretty ludi
crous and goes something like this: When
boy (brie Stoltz) asks long-time girlfriend
(Meg Tilly) to marry him, the boy's best
friend (Craig Sheffer) decides that he's got
to reveal his unrequited love for girl. Girl
and best friend have an affair, and when boy
finds out... well, you can guess what hap
pens.
If you're into sci-fi and action-adventure,
Universal Pictures' "Time Cop" is the flick
for you. Filled with gratuitous sex and vio
lence, "Time Cop" uses some funky futuris
tic toys and interesting special effects that
are reminiscent of Terminator 2. Though
the action scenes and special effects lose
some of their impact on the small screen,
Van Damme's martial arts and acrobatics
are so well choreographed that they alone
are worth the price. The plot is intriguing as
well. Walker (Van Damme) is the Time En
forcement Commission agent hot on the
trail of an evil politician. The tear-jerker ro
mance between Jean-Claude and Mia Sara
adds another twist that will keep you from
fast-forwarding this film.
Other new releases: "Cyborg Soldier"
and"The River Wild," March 14; "The
Scent of Green Papaya," "The Specialist"
and "Percy and Thunder," March 21.
