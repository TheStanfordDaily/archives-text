## Julie Tsai Finals? Here's how to Netscape from the real world 
### 
It was during the wee hours of a dark
not stormy — night as I sighed in despair
over yet another half-done, half-baked
paper. My eyes roamed longingly about the
computer study shack that was now my
home and all its familiar, faded charms. No
new procrastinatory distractions to be found
anywhere.
And then I saw out of the corner of my eye
the radiant neon glow of full-page photos on
my friend's computer screen.
"You've never been on the Internet he
fore?" my friend asked, whizzing through
links and home pages like .111 old hand.
Nope, I answered. And 1 laid my virgin
eyes upon a whole new world — the World
Wide Web, nascent as it is.
Look, you can peruse through random
people's home pages, I thought happily <is
my paper languished 011 the other comput
er. It was better than fingering on e-mail.
The home panes of the trulv computer liter

ate were worlds away from flimsy e-mail
plans and projects, ounce for ounce in
voyeuristic gratification. People that 1 knew
actually had constructed elaborate Web
personas complete with elaborate links to
pictures of their friends, their artwork,
poems and Web databases of obscure fac
toids.
For the uninitiated, here's my super-in
formed ultra-technical explanation from a
novice: Get onto Netscape on your closest
computer cluster and click away. The easiest
thing to do is to click onto the Stanford di
rectory pages and check out links to news
groups and other goodies.
I inks are highlighted words or pictures
that access other information pages on the
Web for you when you click 011 the highlight
ed part. Often, people will create links to
other pages they set up.
Some 11 cappclla home pages even dangled
.is enticement links to video clip home paces.

Moving graphics! I thought. Sound! I
thought, lust like TV! I thought. But alas, the
computer balked and refused to open the ap
plication.
Regardless, though, there remained still a
dizzying array of options, especially since
comfortable old e mail is accessible through
the Net.
Student directories at other universities
were a short-lived attraction since few ac
quaintances at my good ol' state school, Uni
versity of Illinois, were linked up. Oh well.
Much more interesting were random in
formation pages 011 entertainment stuff, in
cluding reviews and information and pic
tures. And I suddenly had nervous visions of
the slow, strangled death of printed media.
Hut, I reminded myself, progress is good.
And slow in coming.
Hut as much stuff as there is already on the
Net, the potential array of time-wasting stuff
is much more dizzying. Instant communica

tion and talk lines with others in search of
time-wasting options. Videos and music
provided for free to everyone on the Net. Hx
otic, foreign newsgroups from countries
you've never heard of. And, of course,
unimagined expanses of cyber-perversion.
I shook off my computer-induced stupor
and tried to readjust to serious paper-writing
mode, but visions of sugar-plum chat lines
danced still in my head.
Look, I thought, random conversations
on pre-arranged topics with anonymous
peoples! Look, I thought, instant USA
Today-beautiful pictures to accompany all
this wonderful, instant information, irrele
vant as it is to my life! Look, 1 thought, some
day I II have a home page too! But I promised
myself I wouldn't inflict any poetry on the
World Wide Web.
Anyway, you have to be careful what infor
mation you put out there, you know. As you
can see, any yahoo can get hold of it.
