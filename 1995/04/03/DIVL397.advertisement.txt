Daily seeks new staffers
STORKE PUBLICATIONS BUILDING, STANFORD, Calif. (Not AP) — It's spring quarter. You're bored. You're
taking 13 units. You have some extra time. You want to write for The Stanford Daily.
"The Daily welcomes new writers," said Editor in Chief Andy Dworkin. "Any time."
'Yeah. I heard there's a meeting Thursday at noon for people who want to write, take photos or make graphics
for The Daily," said Managing Editor Matt Gregory. "It'll be in The Daily office near Terman Engineering Building."
"They'll get to meet us," said a member of the Staff Development team. "Not only that, but they can call if they
can't make the meeting and are still interested, or if they just have questions. Call 5-2100 any time and ask for
Andy."
