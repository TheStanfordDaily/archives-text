# Fourth NCAA championship in 4 years
## Women swim to victory 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
In a meet that came down to the last two
races, Stanford's women's swimming team
captured a stunning fourth consecutive
NCAA championship on March 19.
The Cardinal squad amassed 497 V*
points to edge out Michigan, who scored
478'/t points.
Beating Michigan wasn't easy. The
Wolverines took the lead on day two of the
three-day meet and didn't relinquish it until
senior Eileen Richetelli nailed three of four
dives to win the platform event.
"It was a tremendously exciting team
meet," said women's swimming coach
Richard Quick. "We were thrilled that we
were able to do well on the last two events
and win the title."
The waterborne Wolverines led by 21

points going into the final events, the plat
form dive and the 400 meter free relay.
Richetelli took first in the diving event and
sophomore Megan Gardner came in seventh
to give Stanford the lead.
Then the free relay team of senior Jenny
Thompson, junior Jessica Tong, sophomore
Claudia Franco and freshman Becky Bick
nell cinched the victory, bringing in a time
of 3:17.17, the fastest time in the nation in
that event this year.
Richetelli said she was more nervous in
this contest than during any of her previous
meets at Stanford.
"This (championship) was the most ex
citing for me just because in the past years
Stanford was so far ahead they didn't need
the diving points," she said. "I was definite
ly feeling a lot of pressure just because I
knew my points would be crucial to
the team."
From day one of the champi
onship it seemed Stanford was des
tined to struggle for victory. The
400-medley relay team was disqual
ified on opening day when Franco
left the starting block too early.
On day two, Michigan overtook
the Cardinal, leading 33014 points to
315Vi points.
"It was a lot closer" this year
than in the past three years, said
Quick, who gave much credit to the
seniors on the team who have taken
part in each of the consecutive

championships.
"It was special for the senior
class and it felt great," he said.
"These people have done an awful
lot for Stanford swimming in four
years."
In fact, Thompson brought
home high-point honors from the
Austin, Texas meet. In her time at
Stanford, she has garnered nine
individual NCAA titles and 19
national titles overall.
Quick also applauded the indi
vidual performances of freshman
Amy Oberhelman and sophomore
Sarah Anderson who, he said,
excelled in the meet's first day.
But the coach warned that a fifth

championship might be an uphill
struggle for Stanford's women
swimmers. Next year's NCAA
championships will be held in Ann
Arbor, Mich. — the home of the
University of Michigan — and the
Wolverines are losing only one
swimmer to graduation. The Cardi
nal will need a good recruiting class
and strong performances to repeat
in 1996, he said.
But for now, the swimmers are
just celebrating their fourth victory
in a row.
"We were really happy,"
Richetelli said. "We needed to pull
together as a team."
They did just that.
