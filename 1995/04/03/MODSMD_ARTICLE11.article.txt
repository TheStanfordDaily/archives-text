Stanford Police recently appre
hended two East Palo Alto men
suspected of many recent vehicle
burglaries on campus.
On March 16, police received a
call that two suspicious men were
seen on Frenchman's Road near
Gerona Street. The deputies who
passed by saw them looking at the
cars in the parking lot.
When the sergeant looked in
nearby vehicles, he spotted a
black leather jacket with broken
glass fragments around it, Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer

said. The car in which the jacket
was found belonged to the sus
pects.
Deputies were detaining the
two men when a jogger came
along and asked what was hap
pening. The jogger told police he
knew the two suspects, Niemeyer
said.
When the jogger returned to
his truck, he discovered that his
window had been broken and his
black jacket stolen, Niemeyer
said.
Police then arrested the two
suspects for vehicle burglary.
Jose Francisco Lopez, 18, of East
Palo Alto, was booked at the San

Jose Main Jail and released on
bail. A second 16-year-old sus
pect, also of East Palo Alto, was
cited and released into the cus
tody of his parents. Police do not
release the names of juvenile
offenders.
In recent weeks, many
smashed windows and vehicle
burglaries have been reported by
joggers parking vehicles near the
Foothills, with purses, stereos,
wallets and clothing taken.
"We're hoping to pursue [the
two suspects] and tie them into
other burglaries, especially since
they have been seen before,"
Niemeyer said.
