# 'Someone who just kept pushing the limits of knowledge'
## Business Prof Webb dies at 61 
### Beth Berselli Editorial staff 
Business Prof. Eugene Webb, a pioneer in the
field of organizational behavior and social psy
chology, died March 14 at Stanford Hospital of
respiratory disease. He was 61.
During his more than 25 years at Stanford,
Webb played a key role in bringing behavioral psy
chology into the mainstream curriculum of Amer-

ican business schools.
"In his life and work, Gene
stood for basic human values and
an unwavering commitment to
his fellow human beings," Busi
ness School Dean Michael Spence
said in a statement. "His commit
ment to achievement, his kind
ness, his courage and his irre
pressible humor will be terribly
missed."

Webb's best known book was "Unobtrusive
Measures: Nonreactive Research in the Social Sci
ences," published in 1966 while he was teaching
at Northwestern University's Medill School of
Journalism and co-authored by Donald Campbell,
Richard Schwartz and Lee Sechrest.
In his book, Webb introduced a new unob
trustive method of research that involved such
activities as measuring youngsters' levels of activ
ity by how fast their shoes wear out.
Webb's methods departed greatly from the
more traditional experimental work based on cre-

ated situations, questionnaires and public opinion
surveys.
According to his Stanford colleagues, the book
reflects both Webb's sense of humor and his
wealth of knowledge.
"He had this capacity for humor and seeing the
playful aspects of the world," said Michael Ray, a
professor of marketing at the Business School and
a former student of Webb's at Northwestern.
"He was someone who just kept pushing the
limits of knowledge in a very human way," Ray
said. "He made learning fun and interesting
He was a real presence in the field."
"He was an extraordinarily imaginative and
innovative person in his research, teaching and as
an administrator," said Albert Hastorf, emeritus
professor of psychology and human biology and a
former Stanford provost.
In addition to his teaching activities, Webb
served as associate dean of the Business School,
chair of the Faculty Senate and as faculty sponsor
for Stanford in Washington.
Webb was born in Albany, N.Y. He received his
bachelor's degree from the State University of
New York at Albany and his doctorate from the
University of Chicago.
A memorial service for Webb was held March
21 at Memorial Church. The family requests that
donations be made to programs that promote the
healthy development of young people.
In addition, a fund will be established in
Webb's name at the Business School to benefit
students in need of financial assistance.
