# Tax-cut plan to come to floor
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” House Republicans will
probably send their tax-cut bill to the floor for a vote
this week without resolving an intra-party dispute
over how much the wealthy should benefit, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich said yesterday.
"We don't have a compromise yet, we're still
arguing and I'm not sure we'll get to a compromise,"
Gingrich said on ABC's "This Week with David
Brinkley."
Republicans are at odds over provisions in the bill
that give all families earning $200,000 or less annu
ally a $500-per-child tax credit. More than 100
Republicans, smarting from Democratic claims that
the bill mainly benefits the rich, have signed a letter
saying the ceiling should be reduced to $95,000.
But Gingrich predicted that dissenters within the
party would fall in line and support the bill, a key

element in the House GOP's "Contract With Amer
ica." It would reduce taxes by $189 billion over five
years.
Reps. Sonny Bono, R-Calif., and Roger Wicker, R-
Miss., two freshmen who signed the letter seeking
scaled-back benefits, indicated on NBC's "Meet the
Press" that they would vote for the Gingrich plan.
"I simply was for reducing to the $95,000 figure
because I thought it was a more reasonable figure,"
said Wicker. "It was easier to sell to the American
people and, quite frankly, would make the tax cut
more likely to be enacted."
The tax-cut bill is the last piece of unfinished
business in the Contract, and is expected to be the
last item the House takes up this week before con
cluding its 100-day agenda and leaving for its spring
recess.
