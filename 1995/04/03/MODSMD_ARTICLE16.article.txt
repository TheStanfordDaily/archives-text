# Players will get jobs back

CHICAGO (AP) - Baseball is
back.
Owners accepted the players'
back-to-work offer yesterday,
never even taking a lockout vote
that would have prevented real
major leaguers from reporting to
spring training camps.
"It feels good to talk about the
season starting, talking about
baseball. We are back and will
open April 26," acting commis
sioner Bud Selig said. "It's not
anything I want to go through
again."
Union head Don Fehr said, "I
think it's clearly a step in the
right direction. If they had voted
for a lockout, it would have been a
clear indication they didn't want
peace — at any price."
Fehr said the voluntary report
ing date for spring training camps
will be Wednesday, with a manda
tory reporting date of Friday.
Still to be resolved in the back
to-work agreement are matters
such as dates for re-offering con
tracts, salary arbitration filing

and other issues. Lawyers for
both sides were in contact
throughout the day.
Players ended their strike Fri
day after U.S. District Judge
Sonia Sotomayor slapped owners
with an injunction and restored
the old work rules.
A hearing is scheduled tomor
row before the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals on the owners'
motion for a stay of the injunction
and an expedited appeal.
Teams were told to release all
their replacement players Satur
day night, although some strike
breakers stayed on and signed
minor-league contracts. Some
were bitter.
"The owners got a high fast
ball under the chin and their
knees buckled," said Billy Faultz,
a replacement pitcher with the
Cincinnati Reds. "That's about
the way I feel about it."
Under the tentative agree
ment, each team would play 144
games, 18 fewer than the original
schedule. That would result in the

cancellation of the season's first
252 games, raising the total num
ber of games wiped out by the
strike to 921.
Regulars would have just three
weeks of workouts under the
schedule being discussed, the
same as in 1990, when a lockout
pushed the opening day date back
from April 2 to April 9.
Boston Red Sox general man
ager Dan Duquette said teams
hope to start exhibition games on
April 13.
The decision to release all the
replacement players was made so
owners didn't commit Sunday to
paying $25,000 bonuses to each of
the 32 replacements on each of
the 28 teams, a total of $22.4 mil
lion.
"It felt like it was our money
already," said Tim Dell, a replace
ment pitcher with the Milwaukee
Brewers. "The closer it got to
opening day, the more we thought
it was our money and the more it
felt like if we didn't get it, they
were taking it from us."
