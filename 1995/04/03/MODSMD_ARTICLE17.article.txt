UConn women win
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — With its final victory in
a magical season, Connecticut achieved something
rare in NCAA women's basketball — perfection.
Connecticut erased any doubts that it had fat
tened up during the year on a weak schedule by
winning the national championship and doing it
against the team that has won more women's titles
than any other.
The top-ranked Huskies capped an unbeaten
season by defeating three-time champion Ten
nessee 70-64 Sunday for its first national title. The
victory puts Connecticut (35-0) alongside Texas as
the only undefeated teams in 14 years of NCAA
women's play. Texas won the 1986 crown with a
34-0 record.
"This is just a picture perfect way for someone
to end their career," said Connecticut senior
Rebecca Lobo, voted the outstanding player in the
Final Four. "We're undefeated, we're national

champions and I did it with the people I love."
Connecticut pulled it off despite the foul prob
lems of leading scorers Lobo, Kara Wolters and
Jennifer Rizzotti and despite trailing by nine
points early in the second half.
Lobo's strong second half was a key after she
played only eight minutes in the first half. So was
Connecticut's second-half defense, which limited
Tennessee to three field goals in the final 10 min
utes. And so was Rizzotti's spectacular layup with
just under two minutes left.
"My players were really given the opportunity to
show what kind of character they had," said Con
necticut coach Geno Auriemma, who got a congrat
ulatory call from President Clinton. "It would have
been very easy for us to fold and feel sorry for our
selves and we never did that."
The loss ended a season that began with
immense promise for Tennessee, which was
ranked No. 1 until losing to Connecticut 77-66 in
mid-January.
