## SURE gets funding 
### 
THE ASSU Senate announced
last month that the Univer
sity would — pending the
approval of the Board of Trustees
— assume responsibility for fund
ing the SURE Escort Service.
Stanford and the ASSU deserve a
pat on the back for the change,
which would insulate the group's
funding from the whims of the spe
cial-fee process.
Last year, SURE's net special fee
of $54,259 was supported by 67 per
cent of voters in the April elections,
one of the highest levels of approval.
It is clear that the student commu
nity considers the service provided
by SURE — free after-dark trans
portation around campus for stu
dents who don't want to walk alone
— valuable and necessary.
That's why it makes sense for
the University to fund services like
SURE Escort; in recent years,
more and more needed student

groups have been forced to seek
funding through the special-fee
system because Stanford was
unwilling to fund them.
This change, if approved by the
Board of Trustees, would be a wel
come move away from this trend.
In the future, Stanford should
consider helping out other student
groups that currently depend on
the special fee for support.
Under the current system,
groups can lose their special fees
even if a majority of students are
willing to pay. A number of popu
lar groups that provide needed ser
vices — like Stanford-in-Govern
ment — lost their fees last year
because of a technicality in the
ASSU Constitution that requires a
minimum level of voter support.
In short, the more Stanford can
help groups that provide valuable
services to the community, the bet
ter.
