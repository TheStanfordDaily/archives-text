# Ex-Bookstore managers facing theft, tax charges
## Speed, Chiaramonte could get 8 years in prison 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Three former Stanford Bookstore
managers have been charged with grand
theft and tax evasion involving several
hundred thousand dollars.
The Santa Clara County District At
torney's Office charged former Book
store general manager Eldon Speed, for
mer assistant general manager Philip
Chiaramonte and former controller
Patrick McDonald with seven counts of
grand theft and six counts of state tax
code violations.
The three men surrendered to offi
cials on March 16 and were released on

their own recognizance. A date for a pre
liminary hearing will be set Wednesday.
Speed faces up to eight years in prison
for five counts of grand theft and two of
tax violations, Santa Clara County
Deputy District Attorney Linda Con
dron said. Chiaramonte faces the same
maximum penalty for six counts of
grand theft and two of tax violations,
and McDonald could be in prison for five
years on two counts of each charge.
Speed and Chiaramonte have entered
pleas of not guilty. Anthony Trepel, who
is representing McDonald in the case,
said his client also plans to plead not
guilty.
The charges stem from an investiga

tion by the district attorney and the Cal
ifornia State Franchise Tax Board, and
are the first criminal charges to be
brought in the case. The men came
under scrutiny after a Feb. 5,1992 story
in The Daily revealed that senior man
agers at the Bookstore were receiving
perks unheard of at other university
bookstores.
The California Attorney General's
Office has been involved in civil lawsuits
against the three. A cause of action suit
claiming McDonald took money for his
personal benefit is currently in litiga
tion, said Deputy Attorney General Jim


Speed
Schwartz.
Speed and Chiaramonte are
accused of using Bookstore funds
to purchase land for and furnish
a house in Twain Harte, Calif.,
and to purchase a residential lot
in Fremont, Calif., according to
the district attorney's investiga
tion report. They are also
accused of purchasing or leasing
more than the one vehicle per
employee authorized by a pro
gram for upper-management
Bookstore employees.
Chiaramonte is also accused
of using Bookstore money for a
loan to remodel his personal res
idence in San Jose and asking for
approval from the Bookstore's
board of directors after the
money had already been spent,
the report said.
McDonald and Chiaramonte
leased a motor home that the
Bookstore board "did not
approve or authorize the lease
of," the report says,"and mem
bers indicated that such approval
would not have been given in
light of the Twain Harte cabin
that was available for employ
ees."
A Bookstore check written by
McDonald was "deposited into
his private investment club
account at Charles Schwab," the
report alleges.
The final count of grand theft
accuses all three men of taking
excess compensation for such

items as tuition reimbursement
for their children, bonuses, life
insurance premiums, legal
expenses and personal credit
card expenses.
Between 1988 and 1991,
Speed's excess compensation
totaled more than $200,000,
while Chiaramonte's added up to
more than $87,000 and McDon
ald's totaled more than $51,000,
the report says.
Each of the six tax evasion
charges, the report says,
"reflects the failure of Eldon
Speed, Philip Chiaramonte and
Patrick McDonald to report com
pensation in their annual tax
returns, including loan repay
ments made by 'holding back'
salary, low- or zero-interest
loans obtained through [the
Bookstore], and personal bene
fits, including personal credit
card expense, automobiles, legal
expenses and life insurance poli
cies.
"Although each of the defen
dants filed amended returns
after the exposure of such bene
fits . . . those amended returns
still did not reflect the true com
pensation received by each of
them."
But the managers "didn't
declare stuff on income tax
returns because they didn't take
it," said Martin Quinn, who rep
resented Speed and Chiaramonte
in civil lawsuits brought by the
attorney general last year.
For example, several other
Bookstore employees used the
vacation home in Twain Harte,
Quinn said, "so obviously they

didn't declare it on the tax
returns."
"The notion of criminal
charges in this matter is abso
lutely ridiculous," he said. "It's
just an outrage. Anyone who
knows anything about what went
on knows there was no criminal
intent."
Condron declined to comment
on the probable outcome of the
case. Lawyers for the accused,
however, said they were confi
dent that their clients would be
found not guilty.
"The charges are not well
founded," said Speed's lawyer,
Allen Ruby.
Speed "should not have been
charged for these crimes because
he did not commit them," Ruby
said. "He's innocent and he'll be
vindicated," he said, adding that
he had "faith in the justice sys
tem to see that the charges are
not warranted."
Trepel said he believes the
charges should not have been
filed. McDonald is "very upset"
about the charges, Trepel added.
"His word and his reputation are
important to him."
The former managers "did
nothing wrong," said Kenneth
Robinson, Chiaramonte's
lawyer. "We are shocked that the
district attorney at this late date
has decided to file charges."
An audit found no fraud or
deception by the men, Robinson
said, and because they helped the
Bookstore become financially
successful, "they should be
receiving medals, not criminal
charges."
