### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Three former Stanford Bookstore
managers have been charged with grand
theft and tax evasion involving several
hundred thousand dollars.
The Santa Clara County District At
torney's Office charged former Book
store general manager Eldon Speed, for
mer assistant general manager Philip
Chiaramonte and former controller
Patrick McDonald with seven counts of
grand theft and six counts of state tax
code violations.
The three men surrendered to offi
cials on March 16 and were released on

their own recognizance. A date for a pre
liminary hearing will be set Wednesday.
Speed faces up to eight years in prison
for five counts of grand theft and two of
tax violations, Santa Clara County
Deputy District Attorney Linda Con
dron said. Chiaramonte faces the same
maximum penalty for six counts of
grand theft and two of tax violations,
and McDonald could be in prison for five
years on two counts of each charge.
Speed and Chiaramonte have entered
pleas of not guilty. Anthony Trepel, who
is representing McDonald in the case,
said his client also plans to plead not
guilty.
The charges stem from an investiga

tion by the district attorney and the Cal
ifornia State Franchise Tax Board, and
are the first criminal charges to be
brought in the case. The men came
under scrutiny after a Feb. 5,1992 story
in The Daily revealed that senior man
agers at the Bookstore were receiving
perks unheard of at other university
bookstores.
The California Attorney General's
Office has been involved in civil lawsuits
against the three. A cause of action suit
claiming McDonald took money for his
personal benefit is currently in litiga
tion, said Deputy Attorney General Jim


Speed
