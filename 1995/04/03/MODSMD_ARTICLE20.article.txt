IT HAS BEEN a difficult year
for the Coalition Against Sexu
al Assault, which lost its special
fee in last spring's election. The
group is currently reorganizing,
however, and looks poised to
receive funding from the Universi
ty and the student body in the near
future.
Although CASA was supported
by over 55 percent of students who
voted, the group lost its funding
because it was not supported by
the required minimum of 15 per
cent of the student body. This
rejection makes a strong case for
electoral reforms which would cor
rect this problem.
The $55,000 the coalition
requested would have funded the
much-needed position of sexual
assault prevention educator
($22,000 plus benefits), the Orien
tation program "Sex in the '90s"
($8,000), and all of the groups
housed under CASA's umbrella:
the Rape Education Project, Greek
Rap, the Stanford Men's Collective

and Project Heighten Awareness of
Acquaintance Rape. These services
are extremely valuable to the Stan
ford community, and it is truly
unfortunate that were students to
seek sexual assault counseling at
the Cowell Student Health Center
— as advertised on resource sheets
— they would find a closed door.
These resources need to be paid
for by someone; however, it should
not be just the student body. Sexu
al assault prevention services are
important enough that their costs
should be borne in part by the Uni
versity. Stanford should consider
funding the sexual assault preven
tion educator position and "Sex in
the '905."
Since they did not apply for a
special fee in this year's election,
CASA's members should focus on
lobbying the University to pick up
part of the tab. And with large
funding blocks taken out of the
picture, it would be much easier
for CASA to regain funding in next
year's election.
