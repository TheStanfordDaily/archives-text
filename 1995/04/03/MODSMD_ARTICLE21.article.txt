Body image week was misrepresented by The Daily

AS COORDINATORS of Body
Image Awareness Week '95, we
are concerned that the central
tenants of the week were misrepresent
ed by The Daily. The focus of the event
was not eating disorders per se, but how
pressures unique to college students can
manifest themselves in a variety of body
image problems. For example, in a study
of last year's Stanford freshmen,
researchers Hanson and Huang discov
ered that while only 0.6 percent of
freshman women had clinically defined
bingeing disorders, over 40 percent
demonstrated sub-clinical bingeing
behavior.
As students adjust to college life, they
are confronted by an entirely new atmo
sphere that challenges their previous

conceptions of self esteem and health.
In addition to new eating and exercising
habits, Stanford students inhabit a cam
pus that consists primarily of same-age
peers which presents a narrow and
unrepresentative social comparison
group. The resulting skewed sense of
what's normal or attractive can con
tribute to lower self esteem and body
image problems.
Although the overwhelming majority
of clinical eating disorders affect women,
men are not unaffected by body-image
concerns. They also face a misconstrued
social comparison group and pressure to
obtain a certain physique. Men, if not
personally influenced, certainly know
someone who has dealt with body image
issues. Finally, men need to be aware

that women may interpret their "com
ments" as indicative of what defines
attractiveness at Stanford.
Our goal was to raise awareness of
body-image issues on campus and to
highlight the corresponding resources
designed to help students cope with
these issues. For instance, in our sports
panel Stanford athletes noted that the
pressures concerning appearance or per
formance specific to their sports are
similar to the pressures non-athletes
face from society to obtain a certain
ideal. However, Stanford athletes have
access to special resources such as nutri
tionists which allow them to maintain a
high level of fitness in the most healthy
way possible. Also, the idea of meeting
an ideal beauty standard was addressed

by a panel of students representing dif
ferent ethnic backgrounds. These stu
dents expressed the conflicts they have
faced of not being able biologically to
match a culturally defined mold.
If you missed Body Image Awareness
Week events, we encourage you to
explore other educational resources.
Human Biology 34, "Body Traps," is
offered this spring and will address
these issues in further detail.
