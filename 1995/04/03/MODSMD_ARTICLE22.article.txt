# Editorial against grants to frosh depends on false 'principle of equality'
## 
### 
A Daily editorial on March 1 claimed
that offering grants to the 75 best
accepted freshmen runs counter to the
"principle of equality" of incoming fresh
men and goes on to build an argument
against these grants based on the exis
tence of this "principle." I dispute the
existence of any such principle in Stan
ford's entering freshmen and question
your use of this purported "principle"
only in the case where academically tal
ented students are sought.
One must wonder where this "princi
ple of equality" is evident in the admis
sion of targeted minorities? Where is it
when international students are told

that requesting financial aid will nega
tively affect their application? And
where does it show itself the case of
legacies?
When this fictional principle is not
applied when it is a non-academic con
sideration, what is wrong with reward
ing those whose hard work in school has
put them among the top 75 students
that Stanford has chosen to grant
admission to? Why does The Daily
accept a hypocritical environment with a
purported equality despite some target
ed groups being more equal than others
as long as the criterion is everything but
academics? Does The Daily, with its
sickening calls for "equality," want to
keep Stanford from getting what it
deserves: the cream of the academic
crop?
