# Disputed information in column on Chiapas is well-known
## 
### 
In response to Duße's criti
cism of my article about Chiapas, I am
impressed by the fact that he gets his
information from The Nation, but he com
pletely misrepresents my position. I am
not an uncritical admirer of capitalism. In
fact, I am outraged by the behavior of
bosses who give themselves obscene
salaries while firing workers and creating
untold misery. I have condemned the
behavior of some, but not all, American
capitalists in Latin America.
The information to which he refers is
well-known. What is not known is the
information I provided based on constant
monitoring of the news in many languages

and on the Internet, which incidentally is
being put to good use by the Zapatistas.
Recent events confirm my analysis. The
members of the network hostile to U.S.
capital range from those — including
Islamic fundamentalists — who believe,
rightly or wrongly, that capitalism is the
cause of the world's evils, through Lenin's
useful idiots to French capitalists resentful
of U.S. thwarting their plans in Iraq and
Saudi Arabia. The wife of French presi
dent Francois Mitterrand, who promoted
the European tour of Fidel Castro, is in
the second category. She gave a boost to
anti-Americanism but Castro's praise of
Beaiyolais wine might alienate his Muslim
admirers.
To deny the evidence I have assembled
is silly; I leave judgment to individuals,
including Duße.
