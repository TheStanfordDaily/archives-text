## Search for common ground 
### 
WE'RE TIRED of your sad tale of
two parties. We're discouraged to
pick up The New York Times
each day and read the results of the latest
round in the title bout between Republi
cans and Democrats. We're bitter that
this is how you like to shape the discourse
about real issues that affect the lives of
Americans. Somehow you've managed to
reduce poverty, environmental issues,
and civil rights to big-government versus
small-government. We're glad to see that
ideology comes before solutions.
You Republicans are not to blame per
se, although you seem to have missed the
point of your "Contract With America."
Usually, both sides agree to a contract in
a process of mutual negotiation and con
ciliation. The only signatures at the bot
tom of your deal are the members of your
party intoxicated with their own brand of
thinking. Newt, did you really get on the
phone and do some collective bargaining
with the student at Stanford, the farmer
in the Great Plains, the street vendor in
Central Park?
And you Democrats live in the same
faraway world of partisanship and ban
tering back and forth. It is the Republi
cans that you're against, not the solutions
that you're for. You won't admit that the
tissues of some vital organs in the govern
ment beast are malignant. You'd be
putting your big-government philosophy
at risk by assessing the situation objec
tively, and we wouldn't want that. But

now that you're not leading, the two
party waltz isn't turning so smoothly. All
of your energy is spent answering the
questions on how you're going to bounce
back from the Elephant's last left hook
that sent you to the canvas.
Here we sit as students, wondering if
it's even worth dreaming of progress and
social change. Day in and day out we hear
about one side versus the other. You and
the media beat the notion into our heads
that life is a choice between one side's
idea or the other's. Before we can resist,
we start believing it too. Either you agree
with the Stanford Review or STOP-187,
right? C'mon, are you liberal or conserva
tive? Pick a side, the game is about to
begin.
Please stop your finger-pointing and
legislative bullying for a few moments.
Look at the state of politics.
You Republicans rejoiced when Ben
Nighthorse Campbell from Colorado
changed his party affiliation from Demo
crat to Republican. Most forgot the read
the fine print, in which Senator Campbell
said he would not change his voting
record. Imagine looking at substance
instead of party affiliation. It's amusing
how you Republicans rejoiced and you
Democrats pouted just bemuse the letter
in the parentheses behind his name is an
"R" instead ofa"D."
When President Clinton sat down to
eat a school lunch with some youngsters
in D.C., the media again reduced it to par

tisanship. He's a Democrat, that's why
he's lobbying to retain school lunches. Of
course it's not simply because he cares
that some little boys and girls won't be
able to eat lunch at school because their
parents can't afford Lunchables and
Snapple.
This is the model of policy that you're
giving to us students to work in. You've
almost driven us to throw our idealism in
the trash. Almost. Be thankful that we
have not given in.
We still remember a little word called
compromise. It's a word with a simple
meaning: listening to both sides, giving a
little, keeping the end in sight and forging
a creative solution. It allows us to figure
out the best way to ensure that people can
eat who don't have a job. It lets us work
together to make sure that we have clean
water to drink, clean air to breathe, and
wilderness around us. The art of compro
mise is the only method for thinking
about race relations and what policies can
best reflect our respect for each other.
Compromise allows us to put our ide
ologies and our labels aside and recognize
that we're on the same sinking ship. Let's
get the lifeboats in the water.

over steamed milk at the C-oHo between
Newt, Bob, Bill, Aland Hillary.
