# Mountain lion sightings reported

### Beth Berselli Editorial staff 
Two sightings of mountain lions have been
reported to Stanford Police within the last three
weeks. However, the first sighting was determined to
be feral cats and the second has not been confirmed.
At about 8:30 a.m. last Wednesday, two workers
from the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center were
working near the intersection of Alpine and
Whiskey Hill Roads when they spotted what they
thought was a mountain lion, according to SLAC
Security Manager Rick Yeager.
The two workers — whose names were not
released — viewed the animal from a distance of
about half a mile, Yeager said. Although the workers
were on SLAC property, the animal appeared to be
on the property of Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve.
The workers watched the animal for a few min
utes before it turned and disappeared into the
brush, he added. They reported the sighting to Yea
ger, who then alerted the Stanford Police and the
head ranger at Jasper Ridge.
Officials stressed that Wednesday's sighting has
not been confirmed. In addition, they said it is very
likely that what the workers saw was not a moun
tain lion, but rather a smaller bobcat or feral cat.
"All we have is their alleged sighting," said
Philippe Cohen, administrative director of Jasper
Ridge. "Nothing has been confirmed yet."
People often make errors when trying to deter

mine the size of an animal, Cohen said.
Cohen said he is currently developing an "admin
istrative form so (that) when someone has a sighting
we know what kind of questions to ask." The form
will include questions about the conditions sur
rounding the sighting, including lighting in the area
and from what distance the animal was spotted.
He added that he is concerned that the public be
properly educated about this issue. Recent media
publicity may have "generated a risk that isn't
there," Cohen said, adding that it is important to
differentiate between a sighting and an incident.
"A sighting in and of itself is not a problem," he
said. "What matters is what the mountain lion is
doing."
In addition to last Wednesday's sighting, a Menlo
Park resident reported spotting two mountain lions
chasing deer at about 8:45 a.m. on March 15.
Sally Halstead-Harsch said she saw two moun
tain lions charge out of the brush and chase deer
grazing in a field between SLAC and the Buck
Estate, across from her Sharon Park Drive condo
minium.
But according to Cohen, a tracker has deter
mined that Halstead-Harsch saw feral cats, not
mountain lions.
Two mountain lion sightings were also reported
last September. On Sept. 10, a Palo Alto police offi
cer spotted a mountain lion in the Lagunita lakebed.
In addition, a mountain lion was seen near the Dish
on Sept. 25.
