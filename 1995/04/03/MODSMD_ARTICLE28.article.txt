## A
						small bit of heaven Men get first tourney win in 53 years 
### Daniel Kao Staff' writer 
It was the best of times. It was the worst of
times. It was NCAA tournament time for the
Stanford men's basketball team.
Only during the teary-eyed triumphs and
the heart-wrenching trauma of the Big Dance
can a team find itself making glorious history
one day and suffering painful defeat the next.
Such is the magic and mystique of the NCAA
tournament, and such was the Cardinal's tale
of two rounds in 1995's version of the tourna
ment to end all tournaments.
With its season-long goal of making the
NCAAs for the first time since the 1992 sea
son of Adam Keefe finally achieved, the 10th
seeded Stanford squad sought to make fur
ther history by winning its first NCAA tour
nament game since 1942, the year the Cardi
nal went all the way.
Stanford's cross-country trek to Albany,
N.Y., site of one-half of the East Regionals,
was worth every frequent flyer point as a
thrilling 70-68 victory over seventh seed
UNC-Charlotte (19-10) in the first round pro
vided a rousing opening chapter for the story
of the Cardinal revolution in college basket
ball.
"It wasn't so much a monkey on our
backs," said Stanford forward Darren Ail
away. "It was just something we had to do.
I'm just very proud and pleased to be a mem
ber of the team that got the win."
Just two years removed from a disastrous
7-23 season, this season's Stanford squad had
accomplished what no other Cardinal team in
53 years had been able to accomplish.
"We knew the last couple of years when
we've been able to get to the tournament we
haven't won," said guard Dion Cross. "I think
that also weighed in our minds and created
more incentive for us to win."
Stanford's dreams of further repeating the
feats of the 1942 team were short-lived, how
ever, as the Cardinal (20-9), instead of mak
ing history, became history against the sec
ond-seeded University of Massachusetts Min
utemen (29-5) in the second round.
With third-seeded Villanova becoming just
one of several upset victims in the tourna

ment losing to 14th-seeded Old Dominion,
Stanford's path to the Sweet 16 had opened
up considerably. The only hitch was this team
from about two hours west of Albany's
Knickerbocker Arena (can you say home
game?) that was once ranked No. 1 this sea
son and whose motto was "Refuse to lose"
(can you say big trouble?).
UMass became more than a mere obstacle.
Against 15th-seeded St. Peter's in the first
round, the Minutemen struggled and found
themselves losing with 10 minutes to go in
the game before pulling out a 68-51 victory
over the feisty Peacocks. With Stanford, how
ever, there was little struggling, just a lot of
smashing.
Using those seat-belt commercials as an
analogy, UMass was that big wall and the
Cardinal was the crash test dummy. And it
was more than apparent in the 75-53 drub
bing Stanford received from UMass that the
Cardinal didn't buckle up.
"Massachusetts is a great basketball team
and we knew that everything was going to
have to go well or work for us to have a
chance," said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "That obviously didn't happen.
[UMass] is a great team, and we just weren't
good enough."
Entering the contest, Stanford's edge lied
in its explosive back court. All season long, it
has been a tale of two guards, All-Pacific 10
Conference selections Cross and Brevin
Knight. Against a UMass team which fea
tured a front line that included likely future
NBA draft picks Marcus Camby and Lou Roe,
the Cardinal would need Cross and Knight to
exploit the Minutemen.
"We wanted to come out and play as hard
as we could and have the best game of the
year," Knight said. "We didn't have that. We
made turnovers, we couldn't get shots, we
just didn't play well."
The sharp shooting Cross, who led all Car
dinal scorers with 14 points, hit his first two
three-pointers which, along with a running
jumper by Knight, gave Stanford an early 8-5
lead. After that however, it was all downhill.
