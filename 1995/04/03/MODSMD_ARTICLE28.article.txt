## A 						small bit of heaven Men get first tourney win in 53 years 
### Daniel Kao Staff' writer 
It was the best of times. It was the worst of
times. It was NCAA tournament time for the
Stanford men's basketball team.
Only during the teary-eyed triumphs and
the heart-wrenching trauma of the Big Dance
can a team find itself making glorious history
one day and suffering painful defeat the next.
Such is the magic and mystique of the NCAA
tournament, and such was the Cardinal's tale
of two rounds in 1995's version of the tourna
ment to end all tournaments.
With its season-long goal of making the
NCAAs for the first time since the 1992 sea
son of Adam Keefe finally achieved, the 10th
seeded Stanford squad sought to make fur
ther history by winning its first NCAA tour
nament game since 1942, the year the Cardi
nal went all the way.
Stanford's cross-country trek to Albany,
N.Y., site of one-half of the East Regionals,
was worth every frequent flyer point as a
thrilling 70-68 victory over seventh seed
UNC-Charlotte (19-10) in the first round pro
vided a rousing opening chapter for the story
of the Cardinal revolution in college basket
ball.
"It wasn't so much a monkey on our
backs," said Stanford forward Darren Ail
away. "It was just something we had to do.
I'm just very proud and pleased to be a mem
ber of the team that got the win."
Just two years removed from a disastrous
7-23 season, this season's Stanford squad had
accomplished what no other Cardinal team in
53 years had been able to accomplish.
"We knew the last couple of years when
we've been able to get to the tournament we
haven't won," said guard Dion Cross. "I think
that also weighed in our minds and created
more incentive for us to win."
Stanford's dreams of further repeating the
feats of the 1942 team were short-lived, how
ever, as the Cardinal (20-9), instead of mak
ing history, became history against the sec
ond-seeded University of Massachusetts Min
utemen (29-5) in the second round.
With third-seeded Villanova becoming just
one of several upset victims in the tourna

ment losing to 14th-seeded Old Dominion,
Stanford's path to the Sweet 16 had opened
up considerably. The only hitch was this team
from about two hours west of Albany's
Knickerbocker Arena (can you say home
game?) that was once ranked No. 1 this sea
son and whose motto was "Refuse to lose"
(can you say big trouble?).
UMass became more than a mere obstacle.
Against 15th-seeded St. Peter's in the first
round, the Minutemen struggled and found
themselves losing with 10 minutes to go in
the game before pulling out a 68-51 victory
over the feisty Peacocks. With Stanford, how
ever, there was little struggling, just a lot of
smashing.
Using those seat-belt commercials as an
analogy, UMass was that big wall and the
Cardinal was the crash test dummy. And it
was more than apparent in the 75-53 drub
bing Stanford received from UMass that the
Cardinal didn't buckle up.
"Massachusetts is a great basketball team
and we knew that everything was going to
have to go well or work for us to have a
chance," said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "That obviously didn't happen.
[UMass] is a great team, and we just weren't
good enough."
Entering the contest, Stanford's edge lied
in its explosive back court. All season long, it
has been a tale of two guards, All-Pacific 10
Conference selections Cross and Brevin
Knight. Against a UMass team which fea
tured a front line that included likely future
NBA draft picks Marcus Camby and Lou Roe,
the Cardinal would need Cross and Knight to
exploit the Minutemen.
"We wanted to come out and play as hard
as we could and have the best game of the
year," Knight said. "We didn't have that. We
made turnovers, we couldn't get shots, we
just didn't play well."
The sharp shooting Cross, who led all Car
dinal scorers with 14 points, hit his first two
three-pointers which, along with a running
jumper by Knight, gave Stanford an early 8-5
lead. After that however, it was all downhill.
Sparked by six Cardinal turnovers in less

than five minutes, the Minutemen
executed a 10-0 run capped by a
swooping fast break dunk by
Camby over swing man David Har
bour.
Then, with just under 10 min
utes left in the first half, with Stan
ford down by just five points and
still within striking range, an
unlikely hero emerged for the Min
utemen.
As little known as his name is
difficult to say, UMass reserve
guard Carmelo Travieso came off
the bench to deliver the knockout
blow against the Cardinal.
Travieso's eight straight points,
six off of a blistering barrage of
three-pointers, put the Minutemen
up by 13, making it clear that it
was time for Stanford to pack its
bags.
"If anyone caught us by sur
prise, it was Travieso," Knight
said. "He came in and knocked
down some three-pointers. I played
against Travieso in some AAU
games, and I didn't think that they

went to him as much as they did.
He really hurt us."
UMass, which had a double
digit advantage throughout the
rest of the game, proceeded to ter
rorize the Cardinal on both ends of
the court.
Offensively, the Minutemen
converted 61.3 percent of their
field goals in the first half and
nailed 4-of-7 from behind the arc.
Meanwhile, Stanford made just
34.5 percent of its shots from the
field the entire game and regis
tered a season-low 23 points in the
first half.
The Minutemen's swat shop
was in full gear as UMass recorded
12 blocks for the game. During a
particularly painful sequence in
the second half in which the Cardi
nal failed to hit a field goal for six
straight minutes, the Minutemen
rejected four consecutive shots.
Simply put, the muscle of UMass
wore Stanford down. Camby had
10 points and five blocks and Roe
had 16 points and eight rebounds.
The Minutemen frustrated and
shut down all aspects of Stanford's
game. Even the usually cool
Knight had problems against a
physical, aggressive UMass press

which forced 21 turnovers.
"Certainly physically, quite
obviously, we just couldn't hang."
Montgomery said. "They're so big
and strong and aggressive. We just
couldn't get much going."
Against UNC-Charlotte two
days before, Stanford encountered
no such difficulties as Knight and
company shattered the 49ers.
The Cardinal hit 44.0 percent of
its field goals, turning in an effi
cient 47.8 percent showing in the
crucial second half. Stanford did all
this while at the same time
restricting UNC-Charlotte to 34.3
percent field-goal shooting, with a
paltry 27.0 percent in the first half.
Against Cardinal defensive
stopper Allaway, UNC-Charlotte's
Metro Conference Player of the
Year Jarvis Lang shot just 2-of-7
from the field in the first half. In
addition, the high-flying Lang
jammed just one dunk the entire
game.
"[Allaway] is a very big and
physical player," Lang said. "He
leaned on me a lot, and it was real
ly hard for me to get position. I give
credit to the coaching and to the
players for playing great defense."
While Allaway was doing his

best to frustrate Lang underneath
the basket, Cross and Knight spun
a wonderful duet of back court bril
liance, hurting the 49ers offensive
ly, but at the same time holding
Charlotte's starting back court to a
goose egg for the game.
Cross broke out of a mini-slump
by hitting his first two treys, 5-of
-11 for the game, en route to a
team-high 17 points.
"It was good to hit the early
shots," Cross said. "It was a veiy
important game. I was also happy
to be out of the PAC-10. There's a
new atmosphere and people also
don't have as much time to pre
pare for you, so I got some good
looks."
Knight, meanwhile, had 13
points to go along with six assists,
but more importantly the 5-foot
-10-inch native of New Jersey
found sweet success in his East
Coast homecoming by dominating
the tempo of the game and making
plays when they counted.
After blowing an early five
point lead to trail by as many as
nine midway through the First
half, Knight found Cross for an
open three to ignite an 11-2 run.
Then, with both clubs jockeying

for the lead going into half-time,
the Cardinal point guard pulled up
and drained a clutch three to
ensure a Stanford advantage going
into the locker room.
The 49ers stormed back to take
a 58-53 lead with a little over seven
minutes to play. After the Cardinal
closed that margin to a single
point, UNC-Charlotte pulled away
to five again, this time with less
than five minutes to play.
The Cardinal clawed its way
back to a 67-66 lead with just over
a minute to play. The 49ers got a
look at the basket but missed the
outside jumper which caromed off
the iron. Knight snatched the
rebound and ran a silky smooth
fast break that ended with center
Bart Lammersen's lay-up under
neath the basket to seal the game.
"We didn't want to panic,"
Knight said. "We just worked hard.
We knew from the beginning that
we would have to play hard. We
just had to stay together."
The two rounds of the tourna
ment provided two distinct images
for the Cardinal to ponder. First,
there was the good. The progress
of a 20-win season and an NCAA
tournament victory, neither of

which are small feats in anyone's
book.
"We've got no complaints,"
Montgomery said. "We've made a
lot of progress. Reflecting that two
years ago we were in the dog
house, or the out house, or wherev
er you want to put us. We weren't
very good. And two years later
we're in the second round of the
NCAA."
But then a different picture also
exists. Nevermore than in the
UMass contest has Stanford's
weaknesses been more apparent.
"There'B another level up there,
and we need to take that step,"
Montgomery said. "Certainly Mas
sachusetts is at that level and
we're not yet. We see what we have
to do. We didn't play very well, but
just the athleticism and the other
things out there. We have to get
better."
Finally, however, we may also
have gotten a peek at a third pic
ture — the future. With a tourna
ment win in hand, some much
needed NCAA experience under
the belt and its top six players
returning, the Cardinal tale next
season may be simply of the best of
times.
It was the best of times. It was the worst of

Stanford men's basketball team.
Only during the teary-eyed triumphs and
the heart-wrenching trauma of the Big Dance

to be out of the PAC-10. There's a
new atmosphere and people also
don't have as much time to pre
pare for you, so I got some good
looks."
Knight, meanwhile, had 13
points to go along with six assists,
but more importantly the 5-foot
-10-inch native of New Jersey
found sweet success in his East
Coast homecoming by dominating
the tempo of the game and making
plays when they counted.
After blowing an early five
point lead to trail by as many as
nine midway through the First
half, Knight found Cross for an
open three to ignite an 11-2 run.
Then, with both clubs jockeying

for the lead going into half-time,
the Cardinal point guard pulled up
and drained a clutch three to
ensure a Stanford advantage going
into the locker room.
The 49ers stormed back to take
a 58-53 lead with a little over seven
minutes to play. After the Cardinal
closed that margin to a single
point, UNC-Charlotte pulled away
to five again, this time with less
than five minutes to play.
The Cardinal clawed its way
back to a 67-66 lead with just over
a minute to play. The 49ers got a
look at the basket but missed the
outside jumper which caromed off
the iron. Knight snatched the
rebound and ran a silky smooth
fast break that ended with center
Bart Lammersen's lay-up under
neath the basket to seal the game.
"We didn't want to panic,"
Knight said. "We just worked hard.
We knew from the beginning that
we would have to play hard. We
just had to stay together."
The two rounds of the tourna
ment provided two distinct images
for the Cardinal to ponder. First,
there was the good. The progress
of a 20-win season and an NCAA
tournament victory, neither of

which are small feats in anyone's
book.
"We've got no complaints,"
Montgomery said. "We've made a
lot of progress. Reflecting that two
years ago we were in the dog
house, or the out house, or wherev
er you want to put us. We weren't
very good. And two years later
we're in the second round of the
NCAA."
But then a different picture also
exists. Nevermore than in the
UMass contest has Stanford's
weaknesses been more apparent.
"There'B another level up there,
and we need to take that step,"
Montgomery said. "Certainly Mas
sachusetts is at that level and
we're not yet. We see what we have
to do. We didn't play very well, but
just the athleticism and the other
things out there. We have to get
better."
Finally, however, we may also
have gotten a peek at a third pic
ture — the future. With a tourna
ment win in hand, some much
needed NCAA experience under
the belt and its top six players
returning, the Cardinal tale next
season may be simply of the best of
times.
It was the best of times. It was the worst of
times. It was NCAA tournament time for the
Stanford men's basketball team.
Only during the teary-eyed triumphs and
the heart-wrenching trauma of the Big Dance
can a team find itself making glorious history
one day and suffering painful defeat the next.
Such is the magic and mystique of the NCAA
tournament, and such was the Cardinal's tale
of two rounds in 1995's version of the tourna
ment to end all tournaments.
With its season-long goal of making the
NCAAs for the first time since the 1992 sea
son of Adam Keefe finally achieved, the 10th
seeded Stanford squad sought to make fur
ther history by winning its first NCAA tour
nament game since 1942, the year the Cardi
nal went all the way.
Stanford's cross-country trek to Albany,
N.Y., site of one-half of the East Regionals,
was worth every frequent flyer point as a
thrilling 70-68 victory over seventh seed
UNC-Charlotte (19-10) in the first round pro
vided a rousing opening chapter for the story
of the Cardinal revolution in college basket
ball.
"It wasn't so much a monkey on our
backs," said Stanford forward Darren Ail
away. "It was just something we had to do.
I'm just very proud and pleased to be a mem
ber of the team that got the win."
Just two years removed from a disastrous
7-23 season, this season's Stanford squad had
accomplished what no other Cardinal team in
53 years had been able to accomplish.
"We knew the last couple of years when
we've been able to get to the tournament we
haven't won," said guard Dion Cross. "I think
that also weighed in our minds and created
more incentive for us to win."
Stanford's dreams of further repeating the
feats of the 1942 team were short-lived, how
ever, as the Cardinal (20-9), instead of mak
ing history, became history against the sec
ond-seeded University of Massachusetts Min
utemen (29-5) in the second round.
With third-seeded Villanova becoming just
one of several upset victims in the tourna

ment losing to 14th-seeded Old Dominion,
Stanford's path to the Sweet 16 had opened
up considerably. The only hitch was this team
from about two hours west of Albany's
Knickerbocker Arena (can you say home
game?) that was once ranked No. 1 this sea
son and whose motto was "Refuse to lose"
(can you say big trouble?).
UMass became more than a mere obstacle.
Against 15th-seeded St. Peter's in the first
round, the Minutemen struggled and found
themselves losing with 10 minutes to go in
the game before pulling out a 68-51 victory
over the feisty Peacocks. With Stanford, how
ever, there was little struggling, just a lot of
smashing.
Using those seat-belt commercials as an
analogy, UMass was that big wall and the
Cardinal was the crash test dummy. And it
was more than apparent in the 75-53 drub
bing Stanford received from UMass that the
Cardinal didn't buckle up.
"Massachusetts is a great basketball team
and we knew that everything was going to
have to go well or work for us to have a
chance," said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "That obviously didn't happen.
[UMass] is a great team, and we just weren't
good enough."
Entering the contest, Stanford's edge lied
in its explosive back court. All season long, it
has been a tale of two guards, All-Pacific 10
Conference selections Cross and Brevin
Knight. Against a UMass team which fea
tured a front line that included likely future
NBA draft picks Marcus Camby and Lou Roe,
the Cardinal would need Cross and Knight to
exploit the Minutemen.
"We wanted to come out and play as hard
as we could and have the best game of the
year," Knight said. "We didn't have that. We
made turnovers, we couldn't get shots, we
just didn't play well."
The sharp shooting Cross, who led all Car
dinal scorers with 14 points, hit his first two
three-pointers which, along with a running
jumper by Knight, gave Stanford an early 8-5
lead. After that however, it was all downhill.
Sparked by six Cardinal turnovers in less

than five minutes, the Minutemen
executed a 10-0 run capped by a
swooping fast break dunk by
Camby over swing man David Har
bour.
Then, with just under 10 min
utes left in the first half, with Stan
ford down by just five points and
still within striking range, an
unlikely hero emerged for the Min
utemen.
As little known as his name is
difficult to say, UMass reserve
guard Carmelo Travieso came off
the bench to deliver the knockout
blow against the Cardinal.
Travieso's eight straight points,
six off of a blistering barrage of
three-pointers, put the Minutemen
up by 13, making it clear that it
was time for Stanford to pack its
bags.
"If anyone caught us by sur
prise, it was Travieso," Knight
said. "He came in and knocked
down some three-pointers. I played
against Travieso in some AAU
games, and I didn't think that they

went to him as much as they did.
He really hurt us."
UMass, which had a double
digit advantage throughout the
rest of the game, proceeded to ter
rorize the Cardinal on both ends of
the court.
Offensively, the Minutemen
converted 61.3 percent of their
field goals in the first half and
nailed 4-of-7 from behind the arc.
Meanwhile, Stanford made just
34.5 percent of its shots from the
field the entire game and regis
tered a season-low 23 points in the
first half.
The Minutemen's swat shop
was in full gear as UMass recorded
12 blocks for the game. During a
particularly painful sequence in
the second half in which the Cardi
nal failed to hit a field goal for six
straight minutes, the Minutemen
rejected four consecutive shots.
Simply put, the muscle of UMass
wore Stanford down. Camby had
10 points and five blocks and Roe
had 16 points and eight rebounds.
The Minutemen frustrated and
shut down all aspects of Stanford's
game. Even the usually cool
Knight had problems against a
physical, aggressive UMass press

which forced 21 turnovers.
"Certainly physically, quite
obviously, we just couldn't hang."
Montgomery said. "They're so big
and strong and aggressive. We just
couldn't get much going."
Against UNC-Charlotte two
days before, Stanford encountered
no such difficulties as Knight and
company shattered the 49ers.
The Cardinal hit 44.0 percent of
its field goals, turning in an effi
cient 47.8 percent showing in the
crucial second half. Stanford did all
this while at the same time
restricting UNC-Charlotte to 34.3
percent field-goal shooting, with a
paltry 27.0 percent in the first half.
Against Cardinal defensive
stopper Allaway, UNC-Charlotte's
Metro Conference Player of the
Year Jarvis Lang shot just 2-of-7
from the field in the first half. In
addition, the high-flying Lang
jammed just one dunk the entire
game.
"[Allaway] is a very big and
physical player," Lang said. "He
leaned on me a lot, and it was real
ly hard for me to get position. I give
credit to the coaching and to the
players for playing great defense."
While Allaway was doing his

best to frustrate Lang underneath
the basket, Cross and Knight spun
a wonderful duet of back court bril
liance, hurting the 49ers offensive
ly, but at the same time holding
Charlotte's starting back court to a
goose egg for the game.
Cross broke out of a mini-slump
by hitting his first two treys, 5-of
-11 for the game, en route to a
team-high 17 points.
"It was good to hit the early
shots," Cross said. "It was a veiy
important game. I was also happy
to be out of the PAC-10. There's a
new atmosphere and people also
don't have as much time to pre
pare for you, so I got some good
looks."
