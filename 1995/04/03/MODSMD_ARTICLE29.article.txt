It was not to be.
While Stanford seniors such
as Brian Retterer and Kurt
Grote hoped to close out their
collegiate careers with a fourth
consecutive NCAA team title,
the powers that be obviously
favored the University of Michi
gan at last week's NCAA men's
swimming championship in
Indianapolis.
Paying no mind to the 134-
109 loss they suffered at the
hands of the Cardinal earlier in
the year, the top-ranked Wolver
ines jumped out to a 25-point
lead over the Cardinal on the
first day of the three-day event
and never looked back, captur
ing the team's first national title
since 1961 with a total of 561
points. No. 2 Stanford placed
second with 475 points, well
ahead of third place finisher
Auburn's 393 points.
"Michigan had an amazing
first day," Retterer said.
While Stanford had expected
to fall behind on the first day,
which the squad viewed as its
least competitive day of events,
the Cardinal did not expect the
Wolverines to swim so well on
the second day.
"We looked at the first day as
weak when compared to Michi
gan," said junior free-stylist
Scott Gagner. "Our second and
third days are both much
stronger. We wanted to build
momentum as the meet went
along."
Wolverine swimmers dis
pelled these hopes early on as

they cruised to a number of vic
tories on the second morning.
"The second morning is when
you win or lose the meet. We
were hoping to capture the lead
on Friday," Gagner said.
"Although we swam really well,
Michigan swam exceptionally
fast."
At that point, Cardinal swim
mers resigned themselves to the
fact that their string of champi
onships would be broken and
concentrated on taking second
place.
"The kids were kind of down
after the second day, realizing
they weren't going to win," said
Stanford head coach Skip Ken
ney. "But our philosophy
became, if you're the second
best team [as pre-meet polls
indicated], then get second."
Kenney actually was not pre
sent on the pool deck during any
of the competition. The incredi
bly successful coach came down
with a case of walking pneumo
nia and was forced to watch the
event from the stands. Assistant
head coach Ted Knapp became
the floor leader in light of Ken
ney's illness.
The team did not feel that his
absence hurt their performance
in any way.
"He has instilled such confi
dence in us that at this point we
know we can swim well regard
less of the coaching staff on
deck," Retterer said.
Kenney's spirits were buoyed
by amazing performances from a
number of his swimmers.
