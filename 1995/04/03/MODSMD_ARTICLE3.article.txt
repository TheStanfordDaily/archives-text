# Ladies lose
## Hoopsters fall in Final 4 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
Losing is always difficult, especially when it
ends your season. The finality of the moment
sometimes presents an unbalanced view of the
total situation.
The Stanford women's basketball team finished
the season with a 30-3 record, won the Pacific 10
Conference championship and made the Final
Four. Despite not capturing the national champi
onship, it was a successful year by anyone's stan
dards.
"Our team had a very good season," said senior
center Anita Kaplan. "[The loss] was not represen
tative of our season."
In the semifmal of the women's NCAA tourna
ment, Stanford faced the University of Connecti

dominating the inside game. The
Huskies' front-line arsenal —
Kara Wolters, Rebecca Lobo and
Jamelle Elliott — combined for
69 of the team's points as eventu
al national champion Connecti

cut controlled the style of play.
"We didn't get into any kind of
running game," Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. The
Stanford offense really never got
started. After Kaplan hit her first
shot, a jumper from the right
wing, nothing seemed to go the
Cardinal's way. The Huskies took
over the flow by constantly
pounding the ball to the 6-foot-7-

inch Wolters, especially in the
beginning of the game: Wolters
scored 11 of UConn's first 14
points. The other three came on a
trey from national Player of the
Year Rebecca Lobo.
Running NBA-style isolation
plays and pick and rolls, UConn
jumped out to a 12-point lead by
the second TV time out.
"We had a plan and we did it,"
Connecticut head coach Geno
Auriemma.
Stanford sophomore Kate
Starbird picked up two quick
fouls to join Kaplan in foul trou
ble. Before long, many more Car
dinal would join the pair.
Freshmen Olympia Scott,
returning from her stress frac
ture, played numerous minutes
in the half, taking more shots
than she was accustomed to due
to the Huskie defense. Scott
made a turn-around basket to cut
the lead from 23 points to 17, the
closest Stanford would get for the
rest of the game. Auriemma
designed the Huskie defense to
key on certain players.
"We tried to take one or two
players out of each possession,"
Auriemma said. "We wanted to
play 4-on-4 or 3-on-3 as much as
possible."
Wolters hit on 7-of-ll shots
for 15 points while Lobo and
Elliott scored 12 apiece. In con
trast, Stanford made only 9-of-41
shots, a season low 22.0 percent
The Cardinal ended the half with
20 points, which tied its lowest
point total in a half this season.
"They were not getting on
players who weren't shooters,"
VanDerveer said. "We had the
wrong people shooting. Some
times we got good shots, but not
by the people we wanted to be
taking them. We just didn't fin
ish. You need to be able to finish,
and that was our real problem,
we just didn't finish. . . . We
never got any easy shots."
Many times during the season,
the Cardinal would come out of
the locker room after a difficult
first half and play much better.
Saturday, Stanford did play bet
ter in the second half, but failed
to put together the big run neces
sary for the win.
"We got ourselves down so
fast," VanDerveer said. "You
want to avoid the tendency to try
to come back too fast. We tried to
emphasize the kind of shots we
wanted and not rush our
offense."
During the second half, the

lead fluctuated between 17 and
28. For much of the final 20 min
utes, Stanford matched the
Huskies shot for shot but could
not put together more than a six
point run. With six minutes and
44 seconds left in the game, fresh
men Kristin Folkl hit a three
pointer from the corner, making
the score 70-50; Sophomore
Charmin Smith made another
trey and cut the lead to 17.
Connecticut, however, scored
17 of the final 24 points to bring
the final tally to 87-60. Wolters
finished the game with 31 points
on 11-of-17 shooting; she also
grabbed nine rebounds. Lobo,
later named Most Outstanding
Player of the Final Four, also
grabbed nine rebounds while
scoring 17 points. Elliott, named
to the All-Final Four team, ended
the game with 21 points.
For the Cardinal, Kaplan and
Folkl tied with the team high of
12 points. Senior Kate Paye
missed a double-double by one
assist, garnering 10 points to go
with her nine assists. She fouled
out with just over two minutes to
go in the game.
The many NCAA semifinal
records set during the game
included the largest margin of
victory. Also, the Cardinal
attempted only five free throws,
which tied the semifinal record
for fewest attempted. On the
other side of the ledger, the
Huskies set a record with 46 free
throw attempts, making a record
34 from behind the charity stripe.
"I don't like to comment on
officiating when it is a 30-point
game, but the numbers speak for
themselves," VanDerveer said.
The foul differential of 18 — 13
were called on UConn with 31
called on Stanford — was magni
fied in the second half. Stanford
committed nine team fouls before
the officials called one on the
Huskies.
"There's nothing you can do
about that," Hemmer said. "I
thought we would be able to be
more aggressive." With Kaplan in
foul trouble throughout, Hem
mer was forced to guard Wolters
for some of the game.
"I was pretty surprised [to be
guarding Wolters]," Hemmer
said.
"There was not much I could
do guarding someone who was 6-
8 when I'm only 6-I'A. I wasn't
able to get her away from her
sweet spots. She got on the block
and demanded the ball. She did

what she had to do."
Stanford finished the game 25-
of-81 from the floor for a season
low 30.9 percent. The Cardinal
also attempted a Stanford record
27 shots from behind the arc,
making seven.
The Cardinal reached the Final
Four by defeating UC-Irvine in
the opening game of the tourna
ment, running past Southern
Methodist University in the sub
regional final, knocking off
defending national champ North
Carolina in the regional semifinal
and exacting revenge on Purdue
in the West Regional's final game.
The Stanford offense was not
up to peak performance in the
game against the Purdue Boiler
makers (24-8). However, the Car
dinal did outscore Purdue 69-58
with Kaplan, named Most Out
standing Player in the West
Regional, leading the way with 18
points. She hit 9-of-12 field goals
and also grabbed five rebounds.
Hemmer added 18 points of
her own and grabbed eight
rebounds.
"Rachel was a real key for us,"
VanDerveer said "She was scor
ing, rebounding and talking, so I
knew she was back."
The key for the Cardinal was
the defense, which held the Boil
ermakers to 37.7 percent shoot
ing and forced Purdue into 21
turnovers, 11 more than Stan
ford.
Folkl, an All-Regional and All-
Tournament selection, scored
eight points and added four
boards. She got into foul trouble
early, getting called for two in the
first four minutes.
The Cardinal led for most of
the game, enjoying a seven-point
margin at half time. The Boiler
makers pulled within four with
two minutes to go, but Stanford
made its free throws to balloon
the final margin to 11.
Against North Carolina (28-5),
the Cardinal started tentatively
and quickly fell behind, 6-0. Stan
ford missed several inside shots
early before taking control of the
game and winning 81-71.
Stanford began to assert itself
once UNC's Marion Jones, a
member of the All-Regional team,
picked up her second foul after
4:47 of play. The Tar Heel point
guard was joined in foul trouble
early by first team All-American
forward Charlotte Smith.
Throughout the first half,
Stanford ran at the two key play
ers in an attempt to force them to

the bench. The plan worked as
Smith picked up her third with
just over five minutes to go in the
first half.
Folkl, en route to career highs
of 21 points and 12 rebounds,
took over the game, constantly
getting inside and receiving lob
passes for short jumpers and
iayups.
Kaplan also took advantage of
the size differential inside,
adding 16 points on 8-of-13
shooting. Naomi Mulitauaopele
contributed 12 points and also
snagged six boards. Starbird
added 12 and had seven assists
and matched her career best with
six steals.
Five days earlier, Stanford ran
by SMU 95-73 in a game that was
never close. Although the half
time score was 54-41, the Cardi
nal was always in control.
Starbird led the way with a
career-high 28 points in a game
suited to her style of play. She
also has six assists and grabbed
six rebounds.
Folkl added her second double
double by scoring 19 and grab
bing a team-high 11 rebounds.
She also blocked four Mustang
shots.
Paye added 14 points hitting 4-
bf-7 from behind the arc. SMU
played a 2-3 zone which freed up
the outside shot. The Cardinal
made 10-of-23 three-pointers,
including three each from Star
bird and Folkl, who stunned the
crowd with a dazzling display of
long-distance shooting in the sec
ond half.
Kaplan added 12 points and 10
rebounds.
Stanford opened the tourna
ment with a victory against the
Anteaters (19-11) that was sur
prisingly close in the opening 10
minutes. UC-Irvine, the Big West
tournament champion, held a 13-
12 lead early before Stanford
pulled away to an 88-55 victory.
Once again, Folkl led the team
with 20 points in only 17 min
utes. Mulitauaopele scored a
point a minute in her 13 minutes
and Kaplan played sparingly,
scoring 12. Starbird added 11 and
led the team with seven
rebounds.
Big West tournament MVP
Allah-mi Basheer scored 19
points and added seven rebounds,
despite giving up at least three
inches at the center position.
However, the Cardinal was
able to keep Basheer, unlike
Wolters, under control.
