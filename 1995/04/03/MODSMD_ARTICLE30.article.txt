# Men's gymnastics win MPSF
## Upset of top-ranked New Mexico captures title for squad 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
Going into last weekend's
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Gymnastics championships,
there was a lot of talk about the
low ranking of the Stanford
men's team. Fortunately, none
of the Cardinal gymnasts were
listening.
The squad (8-1-1), ranked
14th prior to the meet, posted a
season-high score of 299 to edge
out top-ranked New Mexico and
defending national champion
Nebraska, which placed second
and third, respectively.
"We were definitely the
underdog coming into the tour
nament," said head coach Sadao
Hamada. "There were five teams
who were ranked ahead of us
going in so we were very happy to
demonstrate our abilities.
"Many of the important peo
ple in the sport didn't give us
much of a chance to win the
NCAA championship before this
meet," Hamada continued, "but
now I think they have to recon
sider."
"We didn't care much about
the rankings because we knew
that everyone had different
judges," said assistant coach
Taka Miyagawa. "There are hard
judges and soft judges and this
was the first time that everyone
was judged by the same judges."
Stanford jumped out to a fast
start on Friday, hitting 6-of-6
routines on the vault. The squad

was forced to overcome inexperi
enced judging however, when the
vault officials erroneously scored
a few of the Cardinal gymnasts
with base difficulty scores three
tenths of a point lower than the
rules mandated. Coach Hamada
was able to appeal two of the
scores, but much of the damage
was left unrepaired.
The next three events were
shaky as the team turned in
below-par performances on the
floor exercise and the parallel
bars. In addition, the team suf
fered falls by two of their best
gymnasts in the high bar, only
salvaging the event with a stellar
9.85 routine by freshman Tim
Dalrymple.
The fifth event, the pommel
horse, was the deciding factor in
the meet. With five teams packed
together at the top of the field,
the Cardinal hit 5-of-6 routines
to post a season-high 38.95 in the
event. Stanford got strong per
formances from senior special
ists Oliver Demree and Evan
Wells, but the highlight of the
event was sophomore National
team member Keith Wiley's 9.9
score.
The success was helped out by
a little luck. Just a day before,
the team showed problems on
the pommel horse and coach
Hamada made a rather unortho
dox decision in asking the gym
nasts to perform three practice
routines in the event. It was an
unusually rigorous workout for
the day preceding a meet and the

request did not go without meet
ing opposition from many gym
nasts wanting to focus more on
mental preparation.
"I think physical preparation
is much more valuable than
mental or psychological prepara
tion," Hamada said. "If you can't
hit the routine in practice, you
aren't going to get it in competi
tion.
"I'm glad that the guys took
my strategies seriously though,
and that things turned out well,"
he added.
The Cardinal rounded out a
strong finish with six solid per
formances on the rings.
"We really weren't expecting
to win," said sophomore special
ist lan Bachrach. "We really had
no clue how we were doing in the
competition. We just focused on
doing our best and so it was kind
of a surprise when they made the
final announcements."
Despite the win however, the
team is still wary of becoming
overconfident.
"We're showing a lot of
improvement now, part of
Sadao's strategy," Miyagawa
said. "We're still making a lot of
mistakes, but we're making good
progress."
For the team, the meet had
little importance compared to
those coming up in the next cou
ple of weeks. The team must fin
ish in the top three next week at
the Western Regionals in order
to earn a trip to the NCAA cham
pionships.
