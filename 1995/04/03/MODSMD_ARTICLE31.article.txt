# After loss to Long Beach, Cardinal cruises to four wins
## Volleyball on roll after break 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
Two weeks ago, the Stanford men's volleyball
team was slumping: Over a stretch of four matches,
the Cardinal lost three. Over spring break, however,
the re-energized Cardinal squad charged back to
reclaim its season by winning four straight matches.
No. 4 Stanford (15-5 overall, 11-4 in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) is climbing back up in the
polls after falling from its No. 2 spot. More impor
tant, Stanford is keeping its playoff hopes alive.
On March 17, the Cardinal — then No. 3 in the
nation — fell to fourth-ranked Long Beach State in
five tough games, 11-15, 15-6, 15-9, 5-15, 13-15.
Stanford controlled the match for most of the night
and should have won; however, the Cardinal's youth
and inexperience caused it to stumble in the fourth
game. Cal State-Northridge had defeated Stanford
under similar circumstances two weeks before this
match.
"We didn't play smart in game four," said coach
Ruben Nieves. "We came out and made a bunch of
hitting errors."
The Cardinal rallied back in game five and held
the lead for most of the game. In rally-scoring, Stan
ford could have downed the 49ers (12-5, 8-5 in the
MPSF) by simply siding out consistently. Unfortu
nately, go-to Stanford swing hitters junior Mike
Lambert and sophomore Matt Fuerbringer were
stuffed back-to-back by Long Beach on two key side

out attempts with the Cardinal leading 13-11.
"All we needed to do was side-out," Nieves said,
"but they blocked us twice in a critical part of the
match. In those situations, we're going to turn to
[Lambert and Fuerbringer], and they have come
through in their careers more often than not. Unfor
tunately, they didn't come through that time."
Lambert finished with 28 kills and hit .353 and
Fuerbringer put 39 balls away for a .431 hitting per
centage. Freshman middle blocker Keen an White
hurst had a strong performance against the 49ers
with 17 kills and a .625 average. The Cardinal hit
.429 overall, but in the key fifth game only managed
to generate a paltry .055 percentage. Long Beach
maintained a .357 attack percentage in that game,
close to the .413 figure they maintained for the
whole match. Opposite hitter Tom Hoff and swing
hitter Geoffrey Cryst punished Stanford with 33 and
27 kills respectively.
"We're trying to recover from the loss still," said
sophomore middle blocker Michael Hoefer.
Stanford took big strides in its recovery when it
came back the next night to destroy Pepperdine, 15-
10, 15-7, 15-4. The Waves, whose record fell to 8-9,
had started the season very poorly by losing twice to
UC-Irvine, but they were regaining momentum
before the Cardinal entered Malibu.
Stanford unleashed the fury of its varied offen
sive arsenal and attacked for a .593 average versus
