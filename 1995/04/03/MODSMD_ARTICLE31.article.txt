# After loss to Long Beach, Cardinal cruises to four wins
## Volleyball on roll after break 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
Two weeks ago, the Stanford men's volleyball
team was slumping: Over a stretch of four matches,
the Cardinal lost three. Over spring break, however,
the re-energized Cardinal squad charged back to
reclaim its season by winning four straight matches.
No. 4 Stanford (15-5 overall, 11-4 in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) is climbing back up in the
polls after falling from its No. 2 spot. More impor
tant, Stanford is keeping its playoff hopes alive.
On March 17, the Cardinal — then No. 3 in the
nation — fell to fourth-ranked Long Beach State in
five tough games, 11-15, 15-6, 15-9, 5-15, 13-15.
Stanford controlled the match for most of the night
and should have won; however, the Cardinal's youth
and inexperience caused it to stumble in the fourth
game. Cal State-Northridge had defeated Stanford
under similar circumstances two weeks before this
match.
"We didn't play smart in game four," said coach
Ruben Nieves. "We came out and made a bunch of
hitting errors."
The Cardinal rallied back in game five and held
the lead for most of the game. In rally-scoring, Stan
ford could have downed the 49ers (12-5, 8-5 in the
MPSF) by simply siding out consistently. Unfortu
nately, go-to Stanford swing hitters junior Mike
Lambert and sophomore Matt Fuerbringer were
stuffed back-to-back by Long Beach on two key side

out attempts with the Cardinal leading 13-11.
"All we needed to do was side-out," Nieves said,
"but they blocked us twice in a critical part of the
match. In those situations, we're going to turn to
[Lambert and Fuerbringer], and they have come
through in their careers more often than not. Unfor
tunately, they didn't come through that time."
Lambert finished with 28 kills and hit .353 and
Fuerbringer put 39 balls away for a .431 hitting per
centage. Freshman middle blocker Keen an White
hurst had a strong performance against the 49ers
with 17 kills and a .625 average. The Cardinal hit
.429 overall, but in the key fifth game only managed
to generate a paltry .055 percentage. Long Beach
maintained a .357 attack percentage in that game,
close to the .413 figure they maintained for the
whole match. Opposite hitter Tom Hoff and swing
hitter Geoffrey Cryst punished Stanford with 33 and
27 kills respectively.
"We're trying to recover from the loss still," said
sophomore middle blocker Michael Hoefer.
Stanford took big strides in its recovery when it
came back the next night to destroy Pepperdine, 15-
10, 15-7, 15-4. The Waves, whose record fell to 8-9,
had started the season very poorly by losing twice to
UC-Irvine, but they were regaining momentum
before the Cardinal entered Malibu.
Stanford unleashed the fury of its varied offen
sive arsenal and attacked for a .593 average versus
.212 for Pepperdine. In the space
of three short games, Fuerbringer
put away 18 kills for a .593 hitting
percentage and Lambert pounded
19 kills for an astonishing .654
percentage.
"Pepperdine is one of the top
programs around," Hoefer said.
"They're definitely playing better
— they beat [No. 2] Hawaii. We
saw their potential in the early
minutes of the match, but then
they just folded."

Nieves cited the match as one of
the strongest performances the
Cardinal has put together all sea
son.
"We crushed them, we killed
them," Nieves said. "We dominat
ed by playing aggressively, and
with good defense. We also didn't
have any lapses. We never gave up
more than two points in a row, and
we only did that two times in the
match. That's the kind of volley
ball we want to play."
Stanford's inability to side-out,
especially against strong jump
serving, has hampered the team's
ability to win all season. Defeating
the Waves marked a turning point

for the Cardinal because Stanford
finally found a way to stymie los
ing big streaks of points.
After taking a break for finals,
Stanford eased back into its season
with a non-conference match
against fledgling Laverne Univer
sity on March 27. The Leopards
are a Division 111 team looking to
join the MPSF; however, they have
not yet managed to win a match in
the league.
The Cardinal overwhelmed
Laverne 15-6, 15-4, 15-9. Stanford
hit .405 but the Leopards managed
only .124 at the net. Stanford
starters only played the first game.
"I scheduled the match because

it was an opportunity to tune-up
before heading back into league
play."
Stanford headed back with all
cylinders firing and ran over San
Diego State University 15-11, 15-
13, 15-11 March 31 in Maples
Pavilion. Though inconsistent, the
Aztecs (9-10, 6-8 in the MPSF) are
a dangerous team with explosive
hitters and jump-servers. They
had just defeated Cal State-
Northridge and Long Beach State
in five games on the road,
matchups the Cardinal did not
manage to win earlier.
"We played pretty darn well,"
Nieves said. "They're a good team,

and it was a good strong win for us.
Even though we were behind a
couple of times, we toughed it
out."
Hoefer emphasized Stanford's
dominating pLay in defeating the
Aztecs. "We smoked them," he
said.
Nieves lauded both Lambert's
and Fuerbringer's performances
in the match. Lambert collected
25 kills, 13 digs and two blocks
and Fuerbringer managed 26 kills,
7 digs and two blocks, all in only
three games. San Diego State out
side hitters John Hyden and
Aaron Smith each put away 18
kills.

Stanford returned to Maples on
April 1 to undo another San Diego
squad, UC-Saii Diego (1-16, 0-14
in the MPSF). The Cardinal put
away the Tritons in three quick
games, 15-4, 15-3, 15-6, to redeem
itself after taking five games to
defeat UCSD in the teams' last
meeting.
Nieves again emphasized the
very complete and strong play of
Lambert, who pounded down 16
kills for a .667 average and ripped
four jump aces. Lambert also had
six digs and eight blocks. Nieves
also praised the solid performances
of middle blockers junior Brant
Shelor and senior Brian Garrett.
