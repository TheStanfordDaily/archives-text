# Trisecting women all in an evening's work for campus magician
## 
### Tracy Jan 
Aa spring fever hits the Farm, students
are looking to avoid studying and relax.
Freshman John-Carlos Ynostroza plans
to lift more than just students' spirits.
Ynostroza, an accomplished magician
who has worked many shows around the
country with famous professionals, is
producing a full-evening theatrical pro
duction here at Stanford, including such
acts as floating people, cutting a woman
in three pieces and vanishing and produc
ing people.
Showing an early interest in the field,
Ynostroza started performing simple
magic tricks at the age of four. "It was a
part of my personality," he said.
"I wanted to do something that just
pulls people in like that, to make them sit
up and take notice," Ynostroza added. He
learned most of his early magic tricks
from books when his parents would bring
him to the Oakland Public Library and
credits much of his success to his parents'
unconditional support.
"My parents saw my passion and sup
ported me 100 percent through every
thing," he said.
In the sixth grade Ynostroza started
performing shows at local neighborhood
parties and at age 13 became one of the
youngest members to be voted into the
International Brotherhood of Magicians.
The group holds monthly meetings, pro
viding advertisements and information
about various magic conventions. "The
group ranges from semi-pros to the top
of-the-line guys," he said.
Ynostroza is also a member of the
prestigious Oakland Magic Club,"the
oldest magic club in the country." The
club consists of approximately 75 mem
bers and Ynostroza was again one of the
youngest members when he was voted in
at age 14.
Ynostroza has performed at the Oak
land A's Christmas party for four years,
in addition to a show at the 1988 World
Series Bash Party when he was only 12.

There he met his long-time mentor Dr.
Robert J. Albo of Piedmont, who then
owned the world's largest magic collec
tion. Three-fourths of the collection was
recently sold to world-renowned magi
cian David Copperfield.
Albo remains an important figure in
Ynostroza's life and magic career, expos
ing the young magician to Houdini's
props, located on the third floor of Albo's
mansion.
"I was like a little kid in a candy shop.
Dr. Albo would set me up with shows. He
took care of me a lot. A glass of milk and
a talk with Dr. Albo and his wife are some
of my most memorable experiences,"
Ynostroza said. At a convention in Las
Vegas last March, Albo introduced Ynos
troza to Copperfield.
In high school Ynostroza performed
weekly shows around the Bay Area and
practiced magic daily at home or with
other magicians. "I read hundreds of
books and got polished from doing
shows," he said.
Ynostroza was also the youngest per
former of any type to ever do a show at
the Bohemian Club, an elite men's club to
which "every president of the United
States belongs." At 16, this was the first
time Ynostroza had ever worked with
"big-time pros." It was also the premiere
of his levitation act, or "floating girls."
Ynostroza calls the anti-gravity effect
a "soulful experience," adding, "Defying
gravity has been my deepest desire forev
er. I love making people happy through
what I do for them on stage." He donates
the profits from five shows each year to
various charities such as the Children's
Hospital Organization.
Besides magic, Ynostroza is also a
quarterback for the Cardinal football
team. He chose to attend Stanford in part
to maintain the magic connections that
he has made in the Bay Area. "I also like
the sunshine and being close to my fami
ly," he said.
From playing jazz piano, singing and
performing one of the lead roles in Win

ter One Acts, Ynostroza said, "It recently
hit me how important it is to combine
every step of theatrics to make a good
show." He added that his goal is to com
bine music, lighting, dance and costum
ing with powerful illusions to make the
magic experience unforgettable.
Developing his own tricks usually

takes Ynostroza at least five months.
Beginning with an idea of what he would
like to do, he then thinks of a method —
including practical logistics such as
transportation — and finally makes the
trick more attractive through staging and
choreography.
This summer Ynostroza hopes to per

form at theme parks or cruise lines.
"Maybe I'll be able to tour with a big
show to get the experience of a huge
Broadway-type show," he said.
As for his future, Ynostroza plans to
work towards a major in International
Relations and pursue his career as a
magician. "I would like to take magic as
far as I can. I'm willing to do everything
possible to become the greatest magician
the world has. If that doesn't work out,
magic will always be with me. It's just
what I love," he said.
Ynostroza plans to bring his magic to
the Farm on June 3. His show, titled
"Illusions: Acts of Magic with John Ynos
troza," will be held in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium. The music includes works by Sting,
Peter Gabriel, U2 and Prince.
"Music is very important to reach the
emotions of the audience," Ynostroza
said. He added that he loves audience
participation and is excited to bring qual
ity magic to campus.
"We are doing this on campus because
we want people here to experience some
thing beautiful and awe-inspiring.
There's more to magic than pulling rab
bits out of hats and people deserve to see
it,"he said.
The staff of Illusions consists of 24
people, including a construction team,
costumers, set designers, artists, stage
and sound crew and dancers. Senior Scott
Roos and freshman Fred Savage are pro
ducing the show, directed by freshman
Michael Glass. Joseph King, another
freshman, handles the financial and busi
ness aspects.
Freshman Stephanie Pieczenik, one of
four dancers in the show, said, "This is a
truly unique experience for the audience.
It'll definitely be worth it to come."
Everyone working on the show had to
sign a disclosure agreement. Ynostroza
explained, "The intrigue of magic is the
fact that it fools the eye and mind. The
magicians' group is very closed and secre
tive. Our success depends upon the main
tenance of secrets."

tion skills. How does he do it? Magicians never tell their tricks.
