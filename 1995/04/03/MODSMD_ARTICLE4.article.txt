# Minority program director named BCSC head
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Contributing Writer 
After an exhaustive nationwide
search, administrators Saturday an
nounced the appointment of a new di
rector for the Black Community Ser
vices Center.
The director's position — which has
been filled on an interim basis by Blair
Bowman since fall quarter — will be oc
cupied by Morris Graves 11. Graves,
who grew up in East Palo Alto, is cur
rently the director of the Urban Expe
rience Program at the University of
Houston. He will begin his new job on
June 1.

The Urban Experience Program
was designed to attract minority stu
dents, particularly blacks and Chi
canos / Latinos. The program attempts
to increase minority enrollment and
retention rates at the University of
Houston, Graves said.
Graves also said he hopes to bring a
fresh style of leadership to his new po
sition by integrating parts of the Urban
Experience Program into the Stanford
community.
"One of the things I've been success
ful at has been the development of rela
tions between campus groups and the
outside community," Graves said.
"Getting the community and civic lead

ers involved in the affairs of minority
students is needed if any initiative is to
succeed."
"This is the first year we tried out
the Urban Experience Program," he
added. "It's designed not only to re
cruit inner-city African-Americans and
Hispanics but is also geared toward re
taining them once they are here at the
University of Houston."
According to Graves, the program's
organizers include a variety of commu
nity, civic and private-sector leaders,
including a congresswoman and a
member of the university's board of re
gents.
Vice Provost and Dean for Student

Affairs Mary Edmonds said she is "very
delighted" that Graves is taking the po
sition.
"While [the center] has been able to
carry on wonderfully in an interim ca
pacity under Blair Bowman, Morris
will bring stability [and] ... the more
permanent working environment be
tween [the center] and the University
will benefit the African-American com
munity here," she said.
"I think it's great too that Morris
has roots here at Stanford and Palo
Alto," said Edmonds. "His mom
worked at the Medical Center and his
dad worked for [Hewlett-
Packard]. ... I think it gives him
a leg up in assimilating to Stan
ford."
Bowman said he had the
opportunity to meet Graves dur
ing an interview session.
"One of the things that stood
out was that he had an excellent
rapport with people and struck
me as very committed to the wel

fare of the students and to his
work," said Bowman. "He's the
kind of person that you take to
immediately."
Graves said he is excited to be
returning to the Bay Area after a
25-year absence and is "looking
forward to renewing old acquain
tances and identifying the priori
ties" of the University and the
center.
The search for a new director
was initiated when Barbara
Smith, the center's acting direc
tor, resigned at the start of fall
quarter over disputes in funding

for the ethnic centers.
A selection committee headed
by Dandre Desandies, a student
affairs officer in the Undergradu
ate Advising Center, conducted a
nationwide search and selected
five finalists to be interviewed on
campus.
The other final candidates
were Robert Bedford, from Indi
ana University Purdue Universi
ty at Indianapolis; Gwendolyn
Mosley, from UC-Berkeley;
Leonard Perry, from Brown Uni
versity; and Benita Ramsey, from
the Claremont Colleges.
