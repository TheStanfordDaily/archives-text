### Martin L. Yeung Contributing Writer 
After an exhaustive nationwide
search, administrators Saturday an
nounced the appointment of a new di
rector for the Black Community Ser
vices Center.
The director's position — which has
been filled on an interim basis by Blair
Bowman since fall quarter — will be oc
cupied by Morris Graves 11. Graves,
who grew up in East Palo Alto, is cur
rently the director of the Urban Expe
rience Program at the University of
Houston. He will begin his new job on
June 1.

The Urban Experience Program
was designed to attract minority stu
dents, particularly blacks and Chi
canos / Latinos. The program attempts
to increase minority enrollment and
retention rates at the University of
Houston, Graves said.
Graves also said he hopes to bring a

Experience Program into the Stanford
community.
"One of the things I've been success

outside community," Graves said.
"Getting the community and civic lead

students is needed if any initiative is to
succeed."
"This is the first year we tried out
the Urban Experience Program," he
added. "It's designed not only to re
cruit inner-city African-Americans and
Hispanics but is also geared toward re

University of Houston."
According to Graves, the program's
organizers include a variety of commu
nity, civic and private-sector leaders,
including a congresswoman and a
member of the university's board of re
gents.
Vice Provost and Dean for Student

Affairs Mary Edmonds said she is "very
delighted" that Graves is taking the po
sition.
"While [the center] has been able to
carry on wonderfully in an interim ca
pacity under Blair Bowman, Morris
will bring stability [and] ... the more
permanent working environment be
tween [the center] and the University
will benefit the African-American com
munity here," she said.
"I think it's great too that Morris
has roots here at Stanford and Palo
Alto," said Edmonds. "His mom
