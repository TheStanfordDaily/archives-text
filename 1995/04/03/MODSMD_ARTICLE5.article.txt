# Ill-will bill?
## Attack on Segal statue prompted drive for new hate-crime statute 
### Emily Bazar Staff writer 
Proponents of a new bill de
signed to broaden California's
hate crime statute say that last
spring's vandalism of Stanford's
"Gay Liberation" sculpture
sparked the drive for additional
legal protection.
Introduced by Assemblyman
Byron Sher, D-Stanford, and
sponsored by the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's Office,
the new bill would expand the
legal definition of a hate crime to
include actions against property
owned by entities such as Stan
ford and actions directed at
groups as well as individuals.
The bill was referred on March
16 to the Public Safety Committee
which will probably hear the bill
on April 18, said Christopher
Carlisle, Sher's legislative assis
tant.
On May 16, 1994, the George
Segal sculpture of two gay couples
located near the Physics Tank was
covered with black paint and then
struck with a bench. Although
several students were arrested
and charged with property dam

age, Santa Clara County Asst.
District Attorney Karyn Sinunu
could not charge the vandals
under the California hate crime
statute.
Sinunu has repeatedly said she
believes the attack was motivated
by hatred against gays, but be
cause the existing law limits hate
crimes to attacks against individ
ual victims or an individual's
property and Stanford owns the
statue, the attack did not meet the
legal definition.
"It wasn't a hate crime be
cause it wasn't aimed at the per
son who owned the statue," Sin
unu said.
After receiving an outpouring
of complaints from the gay com
munity, Sinunu — along with Bay
Area gay rights attorney Bruce
Nickerson — approached Sher
about introducing a bill to change
the language of the statute.
"The new statute would make
ownership of the property irrele
vant," said Nickerson, a Stanford
alumnus. The bill would also de
fine as hate crimes actions intend
ed to intimidate groups.
