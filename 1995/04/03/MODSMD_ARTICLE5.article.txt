# Ill-will bill?
## Attack on Segal statue prompted drive for new hate-crime statute 
### Emily Bazar Staff writer 
Proponents of a new bill de
signed to broaden California's
hate crime statute say that last
spring's vandalism of Stanford's
"Gay Liberation" sculpture
sparked the drive for additional
legal protection.
Introduced by Assemblyman
Byron Sher, D-Stanford, and
sponsored by the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's Office,
the new bill would expand the
legal definition of a hate crime to
include actions against property
owned by entities such as Stan
ford and actions directed at
groups as well as individuals.
The bill was referred on March
16 to the Public Safety Committee
which will probably hear the bill
on April 18, said Christopher
Carlisle, Sher's legislative assis
tant.
On May 16, 1994, the George
Segal sculpture of two gay couples
located near the Physics Tank was
covered with black paint and then
struck with a bench. Although
several students were arrested
and charged with property dam

age, Santa Clara County Asst.
District Attorney Karyn Sinunu
could not charge the vandals
under the California hate crime
statute.
Sinunu has repeatedly said she
believes the attack was motivated
by hatred against gays, but be
cause the existing law limits hate
crimes to attacks against individ
ual victims or an individual's
property and Stanford owns the
statue, the attack did not meet the
legal definition.
"It wasn't a hate crime be
cause it wasn't aimed at the per
son who owned the statue," Sin
unu said.
After receiving an outpouring
of complaints from the gay com
munity, Sinunu — along with Bay
Area gay rights attorney Bruce
Nickerson — approached Sher
about introducing a bill to change
the language of the statute.
"The new statute would make
ownership of the property irrele
vant," said Nickerson, a Stanford
alumnus. The bill would also de
fine as hate crimes actions intend
ed to intimidate groups.
Consequently, under the bill,
if motives behind vandalism
derive from hatred toward a cer
tain group, the charge will be
enhanced from a misdemeanor to
a felony.
"Penalty enhancement deals

with what people did and the
motives of the attack rather than
who owns the statue," Nickerson
said.
Carlisle said Sher has delayed
the Public Safety Committee's
hearing until the last day the bill
can be heard under legislative
rules for fiscal bills and the com
mittee's calendar. Sher, he said,
is waiting for an opinion from the
Legislative Council concerning

the constitutionality of the
revised statute.
Although he said he antici
pates no constitutional problems
with the bill, Carlisle said the
assemblyman wants to wait for
the opinion in case it suggests
minor revisions to the bill.
"If the Legislative Council
does make suggestions I want to
be able to amend the bill,"
Carlisle said. "I want to go into

the committee with the best bill
possible."
Carlisle said the bill's chances
in the committee and legislature
in general are uncertain because
of the comparable number of
Democrats and Republicans in
both.
For example, having four
Republicans and four Democrats
on the Public Safety Committee
means any bill will have a tough

time getting through committee,
Carlisle said.
"It will be particularly difficult
with hate crimes because it's a
controversial issue," he added.
But Sinunu and Nickerson
said they are confident the bill
will pass.
According to Nickerson, the
bill is symbolic of a societal move
toward the idea that hate crimes
should not be tolerated. "We are

gradually coming to a point of
saying that if some act is commit
ted by a person because he's a
bigot that act is worse."
If the bill passes through the
Public Safety Committee, it will
then go to the Ways and Means
Committee, the Assembly, the
Senate and California Gov. Pete
Wilson. If Wilson approves the
bill this year it can be enacted as
early as Jan. 1, 1996.
