# Spring break-in
## Students crash Casper's office, Stanford museum 
### Jamie Taylor Editorial staff 
Stanford students visited some unusual places on
campus over break, and some got arrested in the
process.
Four residents of the Beta Theta Pi house and one
Stanford alumnus were arrested after allegedly
breaking into the Stanford Art Museum late on
March 25.
Meanwhile, two other students were arrested
March 29 for allegedly prowling the attic above Build
ing 10, which houses the offices of University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper and Provost Condoleezza Rice,
among others. The incident represented the third
time alarms indicated a break-in at Building 10 in the
past month.
The four Beta residents — seniors Matthew Ben
gard and Jacob Kuramoto and sophomores Timothy
Kutzkey and Alejandro Quezada — were found near
the Oval by Stanford Police, according to Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. They were accompanied by Jos6 Farias, a
1994 Stanford graduate.
Two of the five were first discovered by Gurtie, a
Palo Alto police dog, he said.
"There was definitely a purpose in mind to commit
a theft," Niemeyer said. Noting that Kuramoto was
carrying various tools in a knapsack — including as
sorted screwdrivers, a wood saw and a hatchet —
Niemeyer added, "I don't know what they wanted to
steal, but the fact that they had tools shows intent.
They are really in deep trouble."
The five suspects referred all questions to their at
torneys, who could not be reached for comment over
the weekend.
The suspects served three days in jail after being
booked on suspicion of burglary, conspiracy and
evading arrest. They were then released on their own
recognizance. Santa Clara Asst. District Attorney
Lance Bayer will decide any charges as early as this
week.
"In my opinion, we have a felony burglary,"
