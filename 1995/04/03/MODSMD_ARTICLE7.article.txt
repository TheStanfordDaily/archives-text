# Spring break-in
## Students crash Casper's office, Stanford museum 
### Jamie Taylor Editorial staff 
Stanford students visited some unusual places on
campus over break, and some got arrested in the
process.
Four residents of the Beta Theta Pi house and one
Stanford alumnus were arrested after allegedly
breaking into the Stanford Art Museum late on
March 25.
Meanwhile, two other students were arrested
March 29 for allegedly prowling the attic above Build
ing 10, which houses the offices of University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper and Provost Condoleezza Rice,
among others. The incident represented the third
time alarms indicated a break-in at Building 10 in the
past month.
The four Beta residents — seniors Matthew Ben
gard and Jacob Kuramoto and sophomores Timothy
Kutzkey and Alejandro Quezada — were found near
the Oval by Stanford Police, according to Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. They were accompanied by Jos6 Farias, a
1994 Stanford graduate.
Two of the five were first discovered by Gurtie, a
Palo Alto police dog, he said.
"There was definitely a purpose in mind to commit
a theft," Niemeyer said. Noting that Kuramoto was
carrying various tools in a knapsack — including as
sorted screwdrivers, a wood saw and a hatchet —
Niemeyer added, "I don't know what they wanted to
steal, but the fact that they had tools shows intent.
They are really in deep trouble."
The five suspects referred all questions to their at
torneys, who could not be reached for comment over
the weekend.
The suspects served three days in jail after being
booked on suspicion of burglary, conspiracy and
evading arrest. They were then released on their own
recognizance. Santa Clara Asst. District Attorney
Lance Bayer will decide any charges as early as this
week.
"In my opinion, we have a felony burglary,"
Niemeyer said. "We don't know
the eventual repercussions, but it
could result in prison time. The
judge will have to decide."
The University may also take
disciplinary action, but Stan
ford's investigation will not begin
until Stanford Police have filed
their report with the District
Attorney's Office, according to
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole.
"We expect to look into this as
a possible violation of the Funda
mental Standard," Cole said,
adding that she has received a

complaint from Thomas Selig
man, the museum's director.
Niemeyer added that there
may be a connection between the
alleged burglary and the Beta fra
ternity. "There is some collusion
there, with the individuals all
belonging to the same fraternity.
I don't know if the fraternity had
anything to do with the burglary
itself, but it's a good possibility,"
he said.
But senior Jim Gombas, a
member of the Beta Executive
Council, said the fraternity was
not connected to the burglary. "I
hope that the University recog
nizes that it was not a fraternity
sponsored thing. It was just five
guys who finished finals and were
partying and then made a bad

decision. It was
their decision —
the guys could
have been in a
fraternity or a
dorm."
Fraternal
Affairs Adviser
Heather Dunn
— who would be
involved in any

University investigation of the
fraternity — could not be reached
for comment.
The alleged break-in may dam
age the fraternity's already-tenu
ous housing situation. Some resi
dents of the house said they think
the University might punish the
fraternity as a whole.
The Betas need an approxi

mately 20-person pledge class to
comply with a new rule that a fra
ternity must fill 90 percent of its
house in order to keep it.
"I think that with the Univer
sity's attitude, this is going to
negatively affect us, in terms of
our housing," Gombas said,
adding that the Beta Executive
Council will try to meet with
administrators to discuss the sit
uation.
Gombas added that the atti
tude of the fraternity members
is difficult to gauge. "Most don't
even know about it yet because
they're not back from spring
break," he said. "Personally,
I'm concerned with what's going
to happen with the four stu
dents."

The two students arrested
March 29 above Casper's office
are junior Jos6 Alcorta and senior
Clark Bailey, both physics
majors. The duo tripped the
motion detector on the second
floor after entering through a
crawl space between Building 60
and Building 10. Police later
booked them for resisting arrest,
burglary and possession of bur
glary tools.
Only five days before, police
responded to a 3:30 a.m. alarm in
the same building but failed to
find anybody there.
"Our department got there in
three minutes, but the people
were gone by the time we were
there," Niemeyer said.
On March 17, Stanford Police

responded to another alarm in
Building 10, arresting four Stan
ford students in the attic above
Casper's office. The investigation
has not been completed and
Niemeyer would not release the
names of those arrested.
Niemeyer said these forced
entries are unconnected to the
alleged burglary at the museum.
He added that several bombings
of the president's office in the
late 1960's makes breaking into
Casper's office a more sensitive
situation than other forced
entries.
"We have to treat any break-in
there like a felony burglary," he
said. "We had to go in with guns
drawn and everything. This is
not a fun deal."
