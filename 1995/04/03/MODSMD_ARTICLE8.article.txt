# Students may pay to attend certain sports

Starting next fall, Stanford
students may no longer be able to
attend men's basketball or
women's basketball and volleyball
games free of charge.
According to Athletic Director
Ted Leland, the Department of
Athletics is considering charging
students $20 for season tickets to
men's and women's basketball
games and an undetermined
amount for women's volleyball
games. Students will also have the
option of purchasing tickets to in
dividual games.
The Athletics Department will
make a decision on charging for
tickets in about two weeks, Leland
said.
"Stanford students have been
admitted free of charge [to these
events] for two or three years
now," he said, adding that this
change would only affect these
three teams.
For at least the last two years,
the cost of student tickets has
been picked up by corporate spon
sors, Leland said. Students have
been admitted free of charge to
any regular season game in all
sports except football.

However, the
contracts with
these sponsors
expire this year,
and the Athletics
Department
could lose up to
$60,000 if it
doesn't find other
sponsors or shift
the cost to stu
dents.

"I think that $20 for a season
pass for Division I basketball is a
pretty good deal," Leland said.
Sophomore Carter Lipton, a
member of the Sixth Man Club,
agreed that $20 is a reasonable
price.
"It's an incredible privilege and
deal that we get it all for free,"
Lipton said. He added that even if
he had to pay an extra $20 for tick
ets on top of the $20 he pays to be
a member of the Sixth Man Club,
the games would still be worth the
price.
"We have one of the best Ath
letics Departments in the country
and to be able to go to all the
games for free is quite a privi
lege," said sophomore Dave
