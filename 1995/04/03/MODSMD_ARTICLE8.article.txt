# Students may pay to attend certain sports

### Anne Dubinsky 
Starting next fall, Stanford
students may no longer be able to
attend men's basketball or
women's basketball and volleyball
games free of charge.
According to Athletic Director
Ted Leland, the Department of
Athletics is considering charging
students $20 for season tickets to
men's and women's basketball
games and an undetermined
amount for women's volleyball
games. Students will also have the
option of purchasing tickets to in
dividual games.
The Athletics Department will
make a decision on charging for
tickets in about two weeks, Leland
said.
"Stanford students have been
admitted free of charge [to these
events] for two or three years
now," he said, adding that this
change would only affect these
three teams.
For at least the last two years,
the cost of student tickets has
been picked up by corporate spon
sors, Leland said. Students have
been admitted free of charge to
any regular season game in all
sports except football.

However, the
contracts with
these sponsors
expire this year,
and the Athletics
Department
could lose up to
$60,000 if it
doesn't find other
sponsors or shift
the cost to stu
dents.

"I think that $20 for a season
pass for Division I basketball is a
pretty good deal," Leland said.
Sophomore Carter Lipton, a
member of the Sixth Man Club,
agreed that $20 is a reasonable
price.
"It's an incredible privilege and
deal that we get it all for free,"
Lipton said. He added that even if
he had to pay an extra $20 for tick
ets on top of the $20 he pays to be
a member of the Sixth Man Club,
the games would still be worth the
price.
"We have one of the best Ath
letics Departments in the country
and to be able to go to all the
games for free is quite a privi
lege," said sophomore Dave


Leland
Levine, also a member of the
Sixth Man Club.
However, some students aren't
so sure about the proposed
changes. Junior Leah Meagher,
who attends an occasional game,
said that "going to games for free
is one of the best things about
this school.
"I think [charging admission]
will change the makeup of the
fans," she added. "I just can't see
a great [number] of Stanford stu
dents who are not diehard fans
shelling out money to see these
teams play."
Team members said they are
afraid charging student admis
sion will hurt attendance, espe
cially at women's basketball and
volleyball games.
"We need things to attract
students," said sophomore Jami
la Wideman, a member of the

women's basketball team. "Stu
dent support is different than
that of 35-year-olds and their
kids."
Freshman Kristin Folkl, a
member of both the women's
basketball and volleyball teams,
agrees that the new policy would
hurt attendance.
"A lot of people around here
wouldn't go if they couldn't get
in free," she said. "People who
do go would be more selective
about which games they would
go to. It's just something you
have to deal with if [the Athlet
ics Department] is losing
money."
The women's basketball and
volleyball teams both saw record
attendance at home games this
year, with a more than 50 per
cent increase in crowds at volley
ball games.
Universities around the
nation handle student admission
to sporting events in a variety of
ways. According to Leland, UC-
Berkeley charges students an

activity fee which appears on
their tuition bill.
At Indiana University and
University of Missouri at
Columbia, students must pay for
tickets to men's basketball. Stu
dents at the University of Mis
souri pay up to $100 for season
tickets, with the best courtside
seats usually reserved for alum
ni.
Due to this policy "the lack of
encouragement and support [by
students] affects the players and
makes our school look boring,"
said Brian Drum, a junior at the
University of Missouri.
Harvard University gives stu
dents a free ticket booklet with
coupons usable for hockey and
football games, the only two
well-attended sporting events at
the school.
Other schools — such as
Princeton, Brown and Emory
Universities — require students
to show a student identification
card at the gate to get into any
regular season event.
