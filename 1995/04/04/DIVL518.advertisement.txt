Introducing some new faces moving into Resident Fellow places.
Joel & Miriam Beinin Potter (International Affairs Focus )
Joel is Associate Professor of Middle East History. He teaches courses on Islamic civilization, the modern
Middle East, women in the Middle East, the Arab-Israeli conflict and US foreign policy and cultural
attitudes towards the Muslim world. He hopes to encourage lively debate on international affairs. Miriam,
a clinical social worker at Stanford Health Services, works with the multi-organ transplant team. She
counsels patients and families receiving liver, kidney and kidney-pancreas transplants. Their son, Jamie,
will be a senior at Palo Alto High School and is interested in journalism and drama. The Beinins have lived
in Jerusalem, on a kibbutz, in Cairo, Oxford and Paris and traveled broadly in Europe and the Middle East.
Robyn Birdwell and Joel Simpson Trancos
Robyn, a physician, is an Assistant Clinical Professor in Radiology with special interests in mammography
and ultrasound. Her research is primarily in the field of breast cancer. She would like to be part of lively
discussions with students and invited experts about many areas of medicine including breast disease, the
availability of medical care, and the issues of cost-containment. Joel is a Resource Specialist in Special
Education at a continuation high school. His training as a teacher focuses on communication, advising and
career direction. Joining them every other week will be Robyn's children, Hayden 12, Ned 10, and Colin 8.
Joel's sons, Andy 15, Isaac 11, and Doug 6, spend Christmas and summers with them. As a family, they love
sports, camping and movies and hope residents will want to join them in the outdoors and at the cinema.
Ira Friedman and Jenny Dyer-Friedman Cedro
Ira, a physician, is Director of Cowell Student Health Services, and a Clinical Associate Professor in
Pediatrics and Medicine. Jennifer is doctoral candidate in Clinical Psychology at University of California
at Berkeley and will soon begin a post-doctoral fellowship at Stanford's Department of Psychiatry. Ira and
Jennifer share a deep interest in and commitment to, the health and well being of adolescents and young
adults. In collaboration with the house, they would like to create a forum for students to share and learn
about each other and their relationships. For example, they hope to explore how personality influences our
college and career paths, discuss communication between the sexes and continue the successful Cedro on
Cedro' program. In addition, Jenny and Ira share a love of cooking.
Sharon Holland and Meghan Lewis Yost
Sharon Holland is an Assistant Professor of English specializing in African American, Afro-Native
American, Feminist and Popular Cultural studies. Given her interests, Sharon would like to teach a house
film course where students allow themselves to actually critique images that circulate in the popular
medium. Joining Sharon at Yost will be her partner, Meghan Lewis, a graduate student at the Institute for
Transpersonal Psychology working toward a Ph.D. in Psychology. Meghan is interested in facilitating a
course around personal growth using various artistic approaches such as painting, collage work, movement,
voice & creative writing.
Lora Romero Casa Zapata (Chicano/a Theme)
Lora, an Assistant Professor of English, is a long-term Bay Area resident, having earned her A.B. at
Stanford and her Ph.D. at University of California at Berkeley. Her research interests lie in part in the
field of Chicano cultural studies — especially as they intersect with feminist and gay/lesbian studies. She
is at work on a collection of essays on California's Proposition 187 in the context of national and
international backlash against immigrant populations. Some of the written contributors to this scholarly
project reside in the Bay Area and would be willing to participate in a house lecture series. Lora is also a
film buff and would be interested in establishing a "Chicano Flicks" night at Casa Zapata. In her free time,
she frequents San Francisco clubs and galleries, does rasquache art projects, and talks about taking up
kickboxing.
Ben and Jane Simon Schiff (Performing Arts Focus)
Ben, a Senior Lecturer in Music, is the violist of the Stanford String Quartet and teaches viola and chamber
music in the department of music. A Yale and Juilliard alum, he has held a variety of professional positions
ranging from principal violist in a major symphony to a member of an internationally touring string quartet.
Ben wishes to encourage and challenge those already involved in the Arts as well as to stimulate others to
participate in the vibrant and vital artistic community here at Stanford. Jane is a teacher at Bing Nursery
School, with a wide variety of experience in early childhood education. Sharing the adventures of RFing
will be their 8 year old daughter Emily, their 5 year old son Nate, and a 2 year old dwarf rex rabbit named
Bunstor.
Resident Fellows arc faculty members, teaching staff, or occasionally senior staff members, who live in
apartments or cottages in undergraduate residences. RFs help students develop intellectually, learn from
each other, and enjoy their Stanford residence experience. If you would like more information, please call
Residential Education at 725-2800.

Ira Friedman and Jenny Dyer-Friedman Cedro
Ira, a physician, is Director of Cowell Student Health Services, and a Clinical Associate Professor in
Pediatrics and Medicine. Jennifer is doctoral candidate in Clinical Psychology at University of California
at Berkeley and will soon begin a post-doctoral fellowship at Stanford's Department of Psychiatry. Ira and
Jennifer share a deep interest in and commitment to, the health and well being of adolescents and young
adults. In collaboration with the house, they would like to create a forum for students to share and learn
about each other and their relationships. For example, they hope to explore how personality influences our
college and career paths, discuss communication between the sexes and continue the successful Cedro on
Cedro' program. In addition, Jenny and Ira share a love of cooking.
Sharon Holland and Meghan Lewis Yost
Sharon Holland is an Assistant Professor of English specializing in African American, Afro-Native
American, Feminist and Popular Cultural studies. Given her interests, Sharon would like to teach a house
film course where students allow themselves to actually critique images that circulate in the popular
medium. Joining Sharon at Yost will be her partner, Meghan Lewis, a graduate student at the Institute for
Transpersonal Psychology working toward a Ph.D. in Psychology. Meghan is interested in facilitating a
course around personal growth using various artistic approaches such as painting, collage work, movement,
voice & creative writing.
Lora Romero Casa Zapata (Chicano/a Theme)
Lora, an Assistant Professor of English, is a long-term Bay Area resident, having earned her A.B. at
Stanford and her Ph.D. at University of California at Berkeley. Her research interests lie in part in the
field of Chicano cultural studies — especially as they intersect with feminist and gay/lesbian studies. She
is at work on a collection of essays on California's Proposition 187 in the context of national and
international backlash against immigrant populations. Some of the written contributors to this scholarly
project reside in the Bay Area and would be willing to participate in a house lecture series. Lora is also a
film buff and would be interested in establishing a "Chicano Flicks" night at Casa Zapata. In her free time,
she frequents San Francisco clubs and galleries, does rasquache art projects, and talks about taking up
kickboxing.
