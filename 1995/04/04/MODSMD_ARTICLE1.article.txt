# Welcome to Stanford...
## 2,900 admitted; more effort will be made to increase yield 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
After hovering just under 50 percent for the past five
years, the number of women offered admission to next
year's freshman class finally broke that barrier.
Women make up 51.4 percent of the 2,900 students
mailed letters of acceptance to Stanford last Thursday and
Friday.
According the Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
James Montoya, nationally there is a "trend of more women
at colleges and universities." He added the number is as
high as 58 percent at other universities.
At Stanford, which began its history severely limiting
the number of female students,
the number of women accepted
has risen steadily over the past
few years, flirting with parity.
percent of admitted students.
Overall, the Undergraduate
Admissions Committee chose its
pool from 15,390 applicants, up
by 750 from last year. However,
the actual number of students
admitted remained the same,
with 18.8 percent of all applicants
accepted this year.
These prospective students
will be the first to participate in
the Yield Enhancement Program,
a pilot project designed to attract
more of the nation's top students
to the Farm. The program
includes giving Prospective
Freshman Week a more academic
focus and offering monetary
incentives for 200 admitted stu
dents to attend the Farm as Pres
ident's Scholars.
Offers of admission were
mailed to students in all 50 states
and 48 foreign countries. Califor
nia had by far the highest repre
sentation in the admitted class at
37.5 percent, followed by Texas
and New York, both around 5 per
cent.

African-Americans also
increased their representation in
the admitted pool. Last year, the
number of African-American stu
dents admitted dropped to 7.5
percent of the pool. However, that
number increased to 9.6 percent
this year, compared to 9.3 percent
two years ago.

Montoya said
both women and
African-Ameri
can students
were "extraordi
narily strong"
applicants this
year but added
that there is
variance in the
admitted pool

every year.
More than 44 percent of the
admitted class are ethnic minori
ties, a number that is relatively
consistent with previous year 3.
The percentages by groups are:
African American, 9.6 percent;
Asian American, 22.9 percent;
Mexican American/Chicano, 10.4
percent; and Native American,
1.3 percent. Just under 5 percent
of those admitted are interna
tional students.
Montoya stressed that admis
sion officers noticed a significant
increase in the number of stu
dents conducting scholarly
research in high school. "There
is much more initiative to

expand the boundaries of high
school."
In addition, nearly 50 percent
of admitt ed students have perfect
4.0 grade point averages. About
three-fourths of the applicants
and 90 percent of those admitted
had class rankings in the top 10
percent of their high school class
€ 3
Another 50 percent have com
bined SAT I scores of 1400 or
higher. More than a third of the
admitted class has SAT I verbal
scores of 700 or higher, compared
with 1 percent nationally, and
two-thirds have SAT I math
scores of 700 or higher, compared
to 4 percent nationwide.
Although the primary criteria
for admission is academic
achievement, more than half of
the applicants with straight 'A'
averages and 56 percent of stu
dents with combined SAT I
scores over 1400 were either
denied admission or wait-listed.
Among the changes the admit
ted students will face is an
enhanced President's Scholars
program, which gives the top 200
admitted students special incen
tives to enroll at Stanford. The
scholars will receive travel funds to
visit Stanford and, if they enroll,
the freshmen will benefit from
research grants of $1,500, a wel
coming dinner in the fall and
increased faculty contact.

Other admitted students will
receive phone calls from faculty
in fields in which they have
expressed interest.
This year's efforts to increase
Stanford's yield — or the per
centage of accepted students who
choose to attend the University
— come in the wake of compara
tive statistics released last year
by the University's Board of
Trustees: Of students accepted to
both Stanford and Harvard, 78
percent chose the Ivy League
school.
Efforts to increase the yield
rate have also led to changes in
Stanford's Prospective Freshman
Week, now known as Stanford
Admit Weekend. The weekend,
scheduled for April 20-23, has
been redesigned to be more aca
demically focused.
Next year, the Yield Enhance
ment Program will grow to
include an early decision program.
Students applying under early
decision would be notified of
admission as early as mid-Decem
ber.
Prospective students have
until May to decide if they wish to
attend Stanford.
In the meantime, the Finan
cial Aid Office has increased staff
to prepare for phone calls on
packages and various financial
aid options. Financial aid pack
ages will be mailed on April 7.
