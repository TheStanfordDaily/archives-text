# Scared to death? It's unlikely, study reports
## 
### Elisabeth Morse Contributing writer 
Fear of death may be a common human
feeling, but according to a new study, death
from fear is a different case altogether.
The Stanford University Medical Center
study — which surveyed patients in five
Santa Clara hospitals after the Loma Prieta
earthquake in October 1989 — suggests that
it is virtually impossible to be scared to
death.
"It is unlikely, unless they have very seri
ous heart disease, that people will die of
stress," said Barr Taylor, a psychiatry profes
sor at the School of Medicine and co-director
of the Stanford Cardiac Rehabilitation Cen
ter.
According to Taylor, even after the Loma
Prieta earthquake — which killed 62 and left
12,000 people without homes — numbers of
heart attacks and cardiac-related deaths did
not increase.
'"ITiere was an increase of the symptoms of
[heart attacksl, but not of deaths." Taylor

said.
Even so, he said that people were fright
ened. "We did the study to reassure people
who don't have serious heart disease that they
don't have to worry about these things," Tay
lor said.
Taylor believes that physical causes are
more likely to lead to cardiac-related death
than mental causes.
However, several other studies contradict
his results. Research conducted by doctors in
the Ix)s Angeles area and at Duke University
after last year's Northridge, Calif, earthquake
directly counters the Stanford group's find
ings.
"There was clearly an increase in [coronary
related | deaths after the earthquake," said
Robert Kloner, a physician at Good Samaritan
Hospital in Los Arigeles and one of the doctors
involved in the study.
"The coroner's office gave us clear data and
we also surveyed 72 care units and over 2,000
patients," Kloner said.
According to Kloner, the discrepancy in
results between the two studies arises from

their extremely different natures.
"Our study was much larger in terms of
number of patients and hospitals," Kloner
said. "The hospitals we looked at were within
15 miles of the epicenter, which is significant
ly closer than that of the other study."
The divergent times of day at which the
two earthquakes occurred also might have
affected the results of the surveys, he said.
"Heart attacks are more likely to occur in
the morning when people wake up and move
around," Kloner added. "The shock of an
earthquake at 4:30 in the morning might have
had something to do with our results."
Taylor defended his Bay Area research. "It
is very difficult to determine all of the com
plexities of the shock," he said. The San Fran
cisco earthquake "wasn't as intense as
Northridge."
Similar studies which corroborate the
results of the Los Angeles study have been
conducted in Greece and Australia.
"I think that it's good that people are
thinking about this . . . there hasn't been a lot
of research out there," Kloner said.
