ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -
Former United Way of America
president William Aramony was
convicted yesterday of stealing
nearly $600,000 from the nation's
biggest charity and lavishing it on
young women, some only in their
teens.
A federal jury deliberated over
seven days before finding Aramo
ny guilty of 25 counts of fraud,
conspiracy and money launder
ing.
Aramony was charged along
with Thomas J. Merlo and
Stephen J. Paulachak with
siphoning off money that had
been donated to the charity by
businesses and individuals. Merlo
was convicted of 17 counts;
Paulachak, of eight.
After the scandal broke in
1991, donations to United Way
decreased sharply. They recov
ered slowly but never reached the
pre-scandal level of $3.1 billion in
1990.
"This verdict sends the mes
sage that society won't tolerate
individuals who are charged with
protecting the precious assets of

charity diverting those assets for
their own personal use," Assis
tant U.S. Attorney Randy Bellows
said.
Aramony and Merlo could get
about five years in prison.
Paulachak could get about two
years. Sentencing was set for
June 14.
During the three-week trial,
the government depicted the 67-
year-old Aramony as a dictatorial
executive who treated girlfriends
and cronies to all-expenses-paid
vacations and tried to intimidate
or buy off those who might expose
him.
Prosecutors said he repeatedly
propositioned younger women
and romanced them with United
Way money, billing the charity for
getaways to London, Paris, Egypt,
Las Vegas and other spots.
One prosecution witness testi
fied Aramony propositioned her
at a business meeting with a
Roman Catholic priest.
The defense contended that
Aramony, who led the charity for
22 years until he resigned in dis
grace in 1992, suffered from

brain atrophy that made him
more impulsive and less able to
reason.
They also argued that any
abuses resulted from lax over
sight by United Way's board of
directors and bumbling by his
staff. The defense rested without
calling any witnesses.
Aramony's lawyer, William
MofTitt, noted that U.S. District
Judge Claude M. Hilton threw out
about half the charges against
each defendant last month.
"They won half the case, and
we won half the case," Moffitt
said. "We have a tremendous
appeal ready. No one won a clear
cut victory in this case."
Jurors acquitted Aramony of
two money-laundering counts;
Merlo was acquitted of one count
of tax fraud and Paulachak was
acquitted of four fraud counts.
Merlo, 64, was a consultant
and then chief financial officer
from 1990 to 1992.
Paulachak, 49, was a United
Way executive from 1971 to 1988
and president of a spinoff compa
ny, Partnership Umbrella Inc.
