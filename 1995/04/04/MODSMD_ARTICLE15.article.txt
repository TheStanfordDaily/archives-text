# Dollar hits record low

NEW YORK (AP) - The dollar
plunged to another record low against the
Japanese yen yesterday after intervention
by the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan
failed to bolster the sagging U.S. curren
cy.
But traders said the intervention may
have helped stabilize the dollar against
the German mark during U.S. trading,
with the American currency ending the
day only slightly lower.
"The intervention was unsuccessful
and didn't help pull up the dollar against
the yen," said Steve Flanagan, vice presi
dent of Credit Agricole in New York. "If
the Fed wants the dollar up, they should
raise interest rates."
In late New York trading, the dollar
was quoted at 86.13 yen, up from its
intraday low of 86.00 yen in early U.S.
trading, but down from 86.55 late Friday.
The dollar also was changing hands in

New York at 1.3725 marks, down from
1.3735.
The intervention by the Federal
Reserve and the Bank of Japan in over
seas trading helped to strengthen the dol
lar overnight. But that support collapsed
once U.S. trading began and speculation
grew that the Fed would not raise interest
rates to help the dollar.
Higher interest rates would make dol
lar-denominated holdings more attractive
to investors.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said
early Monday that the administration had
bought dollars for the first time since
early March, but he would not release any
details about the move.
But traders estimated that the Fed
purchased at least $1 billion worth of the
U.S. currency during two different ses
sions â€” once during Asian trading and
later alone during New York trading.
