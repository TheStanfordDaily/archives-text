UCLA wins championship
SEATTLE (AP) — With its starting point guard on the
bcnch and its greatest coach in the stands, UCLA won its
first national championship in 20 years and kept Arkansas
from joining the select list of repeaters.
The top-ranked Bruins won their record 11th NCAA
title last night with an 89-78 victory that was even more
impressive considering senior Tyus Edney was limited to 2
1/2 minutes because of a sprained right wrist.
Ed O'Bannon stepped up as he was supposed to, but so
did freshman Toby Bailey and Cameron Dollar, Edney's
replacement, and it all meant the first title for the school
since 1975, when John Wooden, who sat quietly in the
stands of the Kingdome, won the last of 10 in a 12-year span.
As UCLA received the championship trophy, O'Bannon,
who was voted the outstanding player in the tournament,
turned to the Bruins' fans in the stands, pointed at Edney
and shouted: "This is the real MVP right here. He got us

here."
For Arkansas, it was the end of a tournament run of
close finishes and it ended one game short of becoming the
second repeat champion since Wooden's Bruins won seven
in a row, ending in 1973.
Texan kills co-workers, self
CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) - A disgruntled
employee opened fire yesterday in the refinery inspection
company where he used to work, killing at least five people
before fatally shooting himself, police said.
The shooting took place at Walter Rossler Co., an indus
trial inspection company where authorities believe the
gunman was once employed.
Police Chief Henry Garrett said eight to 10 people were
still inside the business when the gunman entered through
the back door and began shooting. Two workers escaped by
crawling out the back door, he said.
