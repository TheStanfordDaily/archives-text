## The 						Stanford Daily Editorials Evaluation criteria

Editorials represent a majority of the Editorial Board. The board consists of five Dally editors, two at-large
staff members and two at-large editorial writers selected from the community by the Daily staff.

THE ASSU spring elections are
fast approaching and stu
dents will soon vote on
whether to fund approximately 30
student groups.
As usual, The Daily's Editorial
Board will make recommendations
about whether students should vote
yea or nay. Sometimes these
endorsements are controversial,
but making them is an important
part of The Daily's mission.
Many students do not have the
time to fully scrutinize a group's
budget and weigh the cost against
the group's contribution to campus
— and repeat this process 30 times.
For this reason, members of the
Editorial Board go through this pro
cess for every group.
At least three of the nine board
members meet with representatives
of each group, go over their budget
and ask them questions. Then the
entire board discusses each special
fee applicant, and decides whether
or not to endorse the group.
Ideally, these recommendations

help students think more clearly
and critically about student groups
before they vote. The endorsements
are not meant to take the place of
students thinking for themselves,
however.
To help our readers better under
stand where The Daily's recom
mendations come from, here are the
five criteria that will be used to eval
uate each group:
• Whether the group provides good
value for the dollar.
• Whether the group makes a con
scientious and reasonably success
ful effort to involve and serve a sig
nificant portion of the student body.
• Whether the group demonstrates
initiative in self-funding; that is,
whether its budget reflects that it is
actively seeking revenue sources
other than the special fee.
• Whether the group has responded
to its refund rate and the results of
last year's election.
• Whether the student body and not
the University or other parties
should be funding the group.
