# Fixing food service
## 
### 
FOR A UNIVERSITY on the
cutting edge of everything
from high-energy physics to
international economics, one would
expect that Stanford could figure
out a way to provide edible food ser
vice for a reasonable price. One
would be wrong.
For years beyond memory, the
food at Stanford has been over
priced and of poor quality. Vegetar
ians and kosher students are told
to eat salad and rice; light-eaters
are rewarded by having their
unused points or meals gobbled up
by the invisible food-service
bureaucracy.
Now, finally, there is a plan which
could change all that and provide
Stanford students with food that
they might actually look forward to
eating. The COP has formed an
advisory committee, the vaguely
named "Working Group," com
posed of three Dining Services man
agers, two COP members, one resi

dent fellow and four students
selected at large.
The Working Group should solicit
student input on how food service
should be improved and ought to
implement a structure such that
Dining Services managers are held
accountable for enforcement of
changes demanded by the commit
tee.
Food service needs to improve
the variety and quality of its selec
tion. Vegetarians in particular com
prise a large portion of the student
body, and they must be provided
with as appealing and varied choic
es as carnivores.
And the committee should look
into ways to trim the sprawling
food service bureaucracy and mak
ing the system much more efficient
â€” including convincing those Din
ing Services managers that they
will have to remove a number of
unnecessary positions, perhaps
even their own.
