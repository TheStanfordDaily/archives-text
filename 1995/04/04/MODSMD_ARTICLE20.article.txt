## In defense of theme houses 
### 
I SPENT the bulk oflast year overseas,
and therefore only heard secondhand
about the budget cuts, layoffs and
protests that seemed to overtake the
campus during the spring. The most
noticeable point was that the administra
tion was trying to streamline the Univer
sity to get rid of programs, positions and
people who were not deemed essential to
the operation of Stanford. In practice,
this meant that some of the most dynam
ic people on campus were laid off, and
that innovative programs that are
unique to Stanford got placed on an
endangered species list of sorts.
A friend of mine wrote to me during
that time, urging me to speak out in
defense of ethnic theme houses on cam
pus. She feared that the current adminis
tration would put them in the category of
expendable items and make a move to get
rid of them, and that students wouldn't
protest to keep them here.
At first I thought that this was ridicu
lous. Who could possibly object to the
existence of ethnic theme dorms? I
understand when people say they don't
want to live in one, but that certainly
doesn't imply that people would advocate
their demise. Slowly, however, I am
beginning to realize that many students
on campus would rather do away with
theme houses.
I listen to people refer to Ujamaa and
Casa Zapata as "ghettoes" that encour
age students of a particular ethnic back

ground to hate people of other races and
ethnicities. I hear students talk about
how residents of theme houses need to
"get out into the real world."
When I received that fateful packet
from Res Ed during the summer before
frosh year, I was as wary and skeptical as
these campus critics. Casa Zapata? Are
you kidding me? What, did they think I
was Mexican or something? I kept read
ing, and found out that half of the frosh
placed in theme houses are, in fact, stu
dents of different ethnicities than that of
the theme of the house. Some of these
frosh, like me, had not requested to live
in a theme dorm.
I was not pleased.
But I tried to remain enthusiastic, and
came to Orientation with a relatively
open mind. I would have never guessed
that I would meet so many warm, loving
and strong people in my frosh dorm. Chi
canas and chicanos who treated me with
the same respect and friendship that they
would anybody else, regardless of ethnic
background. Not only did I feel welcomed
and accepted by the community there,
but I also learned so much from the peo
ple and the programs in the dorm. Yes,
many of the programs were about Mexi
can and Chicano culture, but many were
about other things having nothing to do
with racial issues at all.
Along with all of the ups and downs
that I experienced that year, I was
exposed to something entirely foreign to

me: a dorm full of students of color. None
of the other students in Zapata were
Indian, but, for once in my life, I was sur
rounded by people of color and it was a
novel and enriching experience. I would
have imagined that some of the white
frosh in Zapata felt uncomfortable with
this situation, but that year all of the
white frosh had requested to live there.
As far as I know, they all had positive
experiences as well.
I realize that all residents of ethnic
theme houses do not share my enthusi
asm. I am fully cognizant of the fact that
people leave theme houses after a year
and are not happy, and on the flip side,
that some students stay in theme houses
for all four years of their Stanford under
graduate experience and really don't see
much of other communities on campus.
I strongly believe these people are
exceptions. For the rest of us, ethnic
theme houses are an alternative to aver
age dorms that offer a different sense of
community that is rooted, to some extent,
in a shared cultural heritage. Beyond
that, theme houses offer a comforting
focus to some students, and a challenge to
others: to look beyond ourselves and dis
cover something new, and more often
than not, something wonderful.
