Balanced Budget Act does not assign correct priorities

lAM WRITING in response to James
Reiner's March 1 letter to The Daily.
I have provided funding information
to Stanford faculty for the past ten years
and can provide figures on the budget of
the U.S. government. I can tell you that
I have seen a steady decline in the num
ber of federal research and education
awards since the mid-1980s, when the
national debt soared under President
Reagan and his huge boost to the
defense budget.
Appropriations to be precise: $300 bil
lion per year on defense; $11 billion for
the National Institutes of Health; $3 bil
lion for the National Science Founda
tion; $1 billion for the Department of
Education; and $177 million for the

National Endowment for the Humani
ties.
I exchanged e-mail with Reiner and
he said that the point of his letter was
that large structural budget deficits are
not good, with which I agree. I believe
the point that Bill Shen and Maria
Bleavins were trying to make in their
Feb. 27 letter, and with which I concur
(see figures above), is that the Balanced
Budget Act does not assign priority, as
Reiner says, to "each government pro
gram given the limitation of finite
national resources."
Quoting Jerold Roschwalb (Class of
1958), director of Federal Relations,
Higher Education National Association
of State Universities and Land-Grant

Colleges (NASULGC), Washington,
D.C.:
"This (Balanced Budget Act) is not
the voice of an enemy of science or
health research, this is advocacy for a
larger national purpose and goal that
may confuse all funds appropriated by
the federal government as fungible,
except those for national defense and a
few other areas. Discussion in academic /
federal relations circles all note that it
is our job to try to make Members of
Congress who may not be fully aware
that NIH may be the most important
national defense organization in the
federal government defined not too
broadly. (In the period of the last
decade, approximately the same length

of years as the Vietnam War, this coun
try has lost four times the numbers of
young men to AIDS as it has to com
bat. That is just a numerical fact and
the kind of thinking that is not always
considered during the appropriations
process.)"
I add to Mr. Roschwalb's statement
that education is our defense.
I also object to Mr. Reiner's attack on
Shen and Bleavins, assuming that their
undergraduate ranking corresponds to
their also being "political neophytes,"
and finally, "spoiled children." This he
knows how?
