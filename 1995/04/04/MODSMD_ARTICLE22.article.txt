# Multiculturalism is ruining humanities at Yale and Stanford
## 
### 
The Bass grant of $20 million, intend
ed to set up a traditional Western Culture
program at Yale, was withdrawn mainly
because the university wouldn't accept
the donor's proviso that he have veto
power over the faculty teaching it. That
was not Bass's original aim, but he obvi
ously — as George Will surmised (on
ABC's "This Week with David Brinkley")
— suspected that Yale would pull a fast
one, give the program lip service and dis
tort toward multiculturalism.
Comparable dishonesty has prevailed
at Stanford: We often hear, officially, that
little has changed from the old program,
and in some classes that may be true. But
over the years we have heard from superi
or students about the confusion of CIV
teaching (the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education spoke of its incoherence).
Given the scattered and adversarial
approach of the mandate, how couid it
have been otherwise?

On Friday, a distinguished alumna of
Asian extraction, who had been my stu
dent, came to visit. She described in
detail to my wife and me the degraded
nature of her CIV course, observing that
it had "no direction" and that the kids
were encouraged to chatter aimlessly.
Her brother, who also studied here, felt
the same way. Clearly, like the Japanese
Nobel Prize winner for literature this
year, Oe, she wanted her Western Cul
ture strong and unadulterated (his over
all models are Whitman, Yeats, Proust,
etc.). On the Brinkley hour on March 26,
Cokie Roberts sounded a note of total dis
gust with what Yale humanities (and its
likes) had become, echoed by everyone
else on the program and, I daresay, prac
tically every authentic intellectual in the
world.
But Stanford, in the face of the 99 to
one Senate vote against multiculturalism
(the cockamamie left wing revisionist new
history standards which leave out Edison
and Einstein and refer to marginal female
and black figures aplenty) and the huge
country-wide majority repudiating the
rigid affirmative action which is at the
heart of Stanford's current vision and
agenda (including the disastrous choice of
a new football coach), marches on in lock-

step, in a memorable phrase, "holding
hands as we go over a cliff."
