# Students should tell their representatives to support the ESA

If Newt and Rush and the rest of that
gang were honest for once, they'd have to
admit that behind their avowed inten
tions to weaken the Endangered Species
Act is their real agenda — to plunder
America's natural resources, saving noth
ing for future generations; to strip mine
and clear-cut, to turn this beautiful coun
try of ours into one vast parking lot and
shopping mall, all in the service of greed.
Our one protection against a despoiled
America is a strong Endangered Species
Act, an early-warning system for the
truly endangered species — ourselves!
Tell your U.S. Representatives and Sena
tors to support this important wildlife
and human protection.
