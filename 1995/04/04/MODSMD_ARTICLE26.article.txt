A conspiracy unmasked
There's 21 people in power in
the whole world. There's 17 benefi
ciaries of their power. Everybody
knows what they're talking about.
They're all on that krypton spray
stuff, they're all sniffing it up their
nose. And you know what I'm talk
ing about, all you Daily fufnjks, all
you Daily hacks, cause you're all
on it. You're all on krylon paint
glue. 70 percent of you are on it. I
guarantee it. I can tell by the way
you write. Krylon.
Bike free or die
This is in response to Julia
Hadju's letter in The Daily. All I
want to say is that if you come to
campus, either lead, follow, or get
out of the way, but it's people like
her that deserve to be hit.
Sunshine daydream
I have found it sort of intriguing
how the light source from the
heavens is unlimited during the
mid-afternoon. It's strange. I love
it. I like it.
Chill out, pre-med brother
I think all those pre-meds and
engineers out there should just
chill out and smoke a joint and stop
fu[n|king up the curve. You know,
you're taking life too seriously and
I think you need to stop and smell
the roses. Just relax a bit.
The essence of manhood
To walk down a flooding creek
that's raging in the runoff of
spring donning a wetsuit and a
bicycle helmet and carrying an
inner tube under the arm is the
essence of manhood.
Can Kennedy be stopped?
Sean Kennedy must be stopped
at all costs. He is dangerous. He is
Captain Kooky from Kazakhstan.
