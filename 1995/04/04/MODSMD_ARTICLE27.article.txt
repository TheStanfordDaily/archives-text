## In defense of the National Endowment for the Arts 
### Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar Malick Ghachem 
The recent controversy in
Washington over whether to contin
ue federal funding for the National
Endowments for the Arts and Humanities
is only the latest chapter of a very old story
in democratic life. Like multiculturalism,
anticulturalism can rightly lay claim to a
long and distinguished intellectual pedigree
in American history.
But also like the multiculturalists, anti
culturalists can't seem to exist without
their antithesis: those hapless proponents
of the life of the mind who appear always to
be on the defensive in battles of the sort
currently raging in our nation's capital. If
nothing else, this ideological dependence of
anticulturalism on the official symbols of
culture should serve notice that the latest
chapter of the NEA / NEH controversy is
unlikely to be the last.
In recent weeks such a politically and
intellectually formidable trio as Newt Gin
grich (former historian, self-avowed disci
ple of Alexis de Tocqueville), William Ben
nett (former chair of the NEH) and Lynn
Cheney (ditto), have called for the elimina
tion of federal funding for the National
Endowments for the Arts and Humanities.
The case for this proposed reversal of gov
ernment policy seems invariably to rely
upon a muddled combination of purported
ly moral and fiscal arguments: The endow
ments are accused not only of promoting
the ethical decay of American life through
their support of unpatriotic and subversive
artists on the radical fringes of society, but
also of acting as a drag on the federal bud
get.
There are of course several versions of
this argument, but almost all of them tend
to derive much of their polemical value
from the use of one or two examples of
NEA-funded "grotesque art" (in Newt Gin
grich's words) to attack federal support for
culture in general. This is only slightly less
absurd a position than the prospect of for

elimination of the executive branch of gov
ernment because his successor has con
fessed to having smoked a marijuana joint
in his youth.
THE PERCEPTION of a subversive
link between culture, moral corrup
tion, and the national welfare has
been a perennial theme in debates over the
role of the arts in our society. To take but
one example from early American history,
John Adams argued that the place of art

was with those declining aristocratic soci
eties across the Atlantic from which the
republic had recently fought to free itself.
Departing from such European critics as
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Adams insisted
that the salient characteristics of art were
its insatiable need for money and its ten
dency to promote deep divisions of labor in
society.
It is at once fascinating and disconcert
ing to note how both of these strands in the
rhetoric of anticulturalism have retained
their vitality in an age of radically different
economic, moral, and artistic conditions.
Interviewed recently on National Public
Radio, Rep. Philip Crane, Republican of Illi
nois, justified elimination of the endow
ments by calling the national debt "the
greatest threat to the survival of this repub
lic." In a slightly more serious vein, Lynn
Cheney declared "It is time to cut funding
for cultural elites." The implication is not
only that intellectuals are getting an
unneeded free ride, but also that culture
itself is somehow un-American, divorced in
principle from the "average" taxpayer and
irrelevant to our national life. It is on pre

cisely this point that proponents of the
endowments must make their case and
refute the critics.
Thus we must explain how — in a time
of suffocating fiscal constraints — the role
played by these endowments is important
enough to beat out competing uses for the
resources we currently spend on the agen
cies. Since the time of John Adams, critics
of federally-funded culture have contended
that the issue is not whether the humani
ties or arts matter — of course they matter.

Rather, the critics consis
tently argue, funding the
arts and humanities could
be accomplished more effec
tively by the private sector.
Gingrich, Cheney and
others point out that in light
of today's $4.2 trillion
national debt and mounting
fiscal pressures, federal
funding for culture has
become a luxury we can no
longer afford. In fact,
though, total annual fund
ing for both the NEA and
NEH is about $600 million.

The budget deficit, meanwhile, was about
$186 billion last year. Budgets for both the
NEA and NEH are such a small fraction of
one percent of the budget deficit that the
average calculator gives one an error mes
sage when asked to compute the exact fig
ure.
WHAT DO WE get for our invest
ment, which totals about 0.0005
percent of federal outlays in one
year? According to Congressional testimo
ny, every federal dollar spent on the arts
and humanities last year generated about
eleven dollars in private giving. Despite
detractors' arguments, there is no system
atic evidence that private sources would
pick up the slack if the federal government
stopped exercising leadership in funding
the arts and humanities. Moreover, a dis
tinctly federal role is justified; if we expect
the endowments to forge an American
artistic and cultural life, then the mandate
and funding for the agencies must be
national. A California Arts Council cannot
speak to the historical and cultural con
cerns of America the way the NEA or NEH

could.
The NEA and the NEH can also play a
crucial role in teaching Americans to think
critically at a time when knowledge is
power. In today's world, education still
means more than the natural sciences and
engineering. Studies indicate that students
at all levels who cultivate artistic reasoning
tend to develop critical thinking and uni
versal culture. Meanwhile, exposing stu
dents to rigorous work in the humanities is
a highly effective means of improving writ
ing and communication skills.
Both the NEA and the NEH have devel
oped initiatives to help younger scholars
reach these goals. As the world becomes
more competitive and American students
continue to languish in international tests
of scholastic achievement, it is more impor
tant than ever to our nation's purpose to
promote critical thinking and writing skills.
Is it worth it to spend resources allow
ing Americans to cast what Tocqueville
called "those eager and furtive glances into
the higher regions of the intellect?" In a his
torical sense, the debate about anticultural
ism will continue unresolved. But it ought
to be clear that federal funding for the arts
and humanities can promote a lively,
changing, strong American culture.
The benefits of this culture are not con
fined to highbrow art museums and elite
universities, but are shared by Americans
from prairies to the inner cities. At a time
when every shade of the political spectrum
decries the breakdown of family and com
munity, it is worth remembering how we
came to forge this country. Americans have
historically been tied together by the bonds
of culture and community despite a chang
ing history and a population of immigrants
that each add a tile to the cultural mosaic.
Although no one ought to let the federal
government define the meaning of this
mosaic, our shared culture — represented
by our arts and humanities — is our public
trust. This culture belongs to everyone.
And our government's support for our cul
tural expression is not only a historically
justified and tremendously cost-effective
investment in something we value. Rather,
the NEA and NEH stand as an affirmation
that our culture matters, that it is not
empty, and that it is worth learning and
remembering.
