# Stanford's educational legacy: intellectual failure in times of genocide
## 
### Brad K. Blitz 
THE FACULTY at this university
has proven themselves intellectually
and morally bankrupt. It's time to
set the record straight. month, The
New York Times revealed that, according
to the CIA, Serbian forces were responsi
ble for 90 percent of all acts of "ethnic
cleansing" in Bosnia. The leaked report
appeared two weeks after the Internation
al War Crimes Tribunal declared that
genocide had occurred at the Serb-run
concentration camp at Omarska. To those
of us who have been following this war,
this information was nothing new.
What is new is that in the knowledge
of these declarations, serious academics
can no longer pretend that the destruc
tion of Bosnia is the result of a civil war
in which all sides are guilty. That is
important for Stanford to hear. Since the
start of the war our university has been
the academic flagship of appeasement
and soft thinking.
Why should Stanford be singled out?
Here are some reasons: The most distin-

Students Against GEnocide (SAGE) —
Project Bosnia, the largest coordinated
national student resistance effort com
mitted to defending the existence of a
democratic, multi-ethnic state of Bosnia-
Herzegovina.
In spite of its presence, SAGE has
received no support from faculty, who
have refused to condemn the use of geno
cide against the citizens of Bosnia.'
Rather, in some cases, there has been a
backlash from prominent faculty against
such student organization. This has
taken the form of a simplistic relativism
which some faculty have used to criticize
student protest. This relativism assumes
that the University is an apolitical setting
where ideas are necessarily of equal
weight. It disguises a new ethic of indis
criminate moral equivalence and glosses
over a confused but powerful dogma.
A well-publicized example of this

appeared as an advertisement in The
Stanford Daily (May 7, 1993) by the
Balkan Peace Committee (BPC). This
open letter against intervention was
addressed to Clinton and signed by 45
senior faculty men. In search of a "bal
anced perspective," it contained state
ments that fell short of facts and figures
recorded in official reports. The tone of
moral equivalence was immediately
noted in the phrase — "no side has a
monopoly on either atrocities or suffering
in this war."
The advertisement was paid for by
Dusan Djordjevich, a history student
associated with Radovan Karadzic's
mouthpiece, the San-Francisco-based
Serbian Unity Congress. Two weeks
later, the co-founder of the BPC, Willam
son Evers, was seen at a forum where the
feminist lawyer Catherine MacKinnon
was due to speak running down the aisles
of Dinkelspiel Auditorium shouting
"Hear the other side!" The essence of
Evers' statements is not unusual. Stan
ford faculty and associates have repeated
ly demonstrated their confusion between
the legitimate ideal of "objectivity" and
the political demand for "balance."
THE DEMAND for "balance" and its
confusion with "objectivity" is part
of a powerful dogma. In a more

sophisticated variant, proponents of
moral equivalence argue that economic
interests are reflected in a "partisan
press" which is hostile to the Serbian
"point of view." Critics claim that "open
minded" people should be aware of the
forces of international capitalism and
thus be suspicious of the press. As it is
expressed, this is a completely bogus
argument. The greatest proof of media
manipulation rightly condemns the Serb
government-controlled media. Faculty
have no justification for promoting the
"other side." All evidence suggests that
the "other side" is sponsoring genocide.
Why this confusion? Most of those
who signed the BPC letter were either
one-time members of the "Left" who had
opposed U.S. intervention abroad or con
servatives on the "Right" who were isola
tionist. I believe the main reason for this
confusion among those on the "Left" is
the result of an impulsive reaction to be
seen as "critical." But whatever their rec
ommendations, traditional adversaries of
U.S. imperialism like History Prof. Nor
man Naimark should be able to distin
guish between principal victims and prin
cipal aggressors — that is, if they are
worth their academic salt.
This confusion was furthered illus
trated in a letter titled "Religion of vic
tims in Bosnia is not the only reason for

persecution" sent to The Stanford Daily
(May 27, 1993) by Robert Hammerton-
Kelly. The author suggested that religion
was only one reason for the persecution
against Bosnians and that Islam itself
was not the only cause. He dismissed the
forum on Bosnia, organized by Hillel, as a
propaganda exercise which was "unbal
anced." He accused the Jewish students
of hypocrisy since he noted that Hillel fre
quently questioned "one-sided" meetings
where only Palestinian speakers were
invited. Finally, he accused the Jewish
students of having been pushed by their
connection with the Holocaust from
"morality to moralizing." He then ended
with a quote from Joseph Nye's Nuclear
Ethics.
His letter was very revealing. Ham
merton-Kelly's assimilation of the con
flict in the Sudan to the war in Bosnia is
proof that even Bill Perry's closest col
leagues misunderstand the ideological
basis for the aggression in Bosnia. Con
fusing "objectivity" and "balance," the
author failed to distinguish legitimate
territorial claims from illegitimate
claims.
Only the most hardened extremist
would deny that either Palestinians or
Jews have a legitimate claim to the region
