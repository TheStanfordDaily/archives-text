## Men's tennis still the best 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
The top-ranked Stanford men's tennis team (15-0
overall, 4-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference) maintained its
flawless record over spring break by shutting out
unranked Brigham Young (6-8), disposing of No. 17
Arizona State (9-5) and blanking No. 46 Arizona (4-11).
The Sun Devils were the only team able to muster at
least one point against the Cardinal, bowing out 5-2. In
the most anticipated match of the week, the nation's
No. 1 player, Sun Devil Sargis Sargsian, defeated Stan
ford's seventh-ranked Jeff Salzenstein, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
Sargsian, a senior from Armenia, led 6-2 in the tie
breaker when Salzenstein began a small comeback,
fighting off two match points to bring the score to 6-4.
Just when it appeared that Stanford's junior captain
had brought the tiebreak to a 6-5 deficit, however,
Sargsian made a questionable line call. Salzenstein had
ripped a perfect line-hugging passing shot out of
Sargsian's reach, but Sargsian saw it differently. He
called the ball out, and with that ended the match.
"Yeah, it was a pretty questionable call," Sargsian
admitted. "I almost didn't call it, but then I said 'No,
I've gotta go home.' "
The chair umpire refused the appeal of a disbeliev
ing Salzenstein, who some spectators felt was the vic
tim of what tennis players call a "hook."
Sargsian won the first set due to the combination of
his blistering serve and Salzenstein's initial overag
gressiveness.
"I beat him because I was holding my serve, to tell
you the truth," Sargsian said, ignoring his confessed
hook on match point. "Sometimes I serve really well,
but most of the time it just sucks."
