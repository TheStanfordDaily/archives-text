## Men's tennis still the best 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
The top-ranked Stanford men's tennis team (15-0
overall, 4-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference) maintained its
flawless record over spring break by shutting out
unranked Brigham Young (6-8), disposing of No. 17
Arizona State (9-5) and blanking No. 46 Arizona (4-11).
The Sun Devils were the only team able to muster at
least one point against the Cardinal, bowing out 5-2. In
the most anticipated match of the week, the nation's
No. 1 player, Sun Devil Sargis Sargsian, defeated Stan
ford's seventh-ranked Jeff Salzenstein, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
Sargsian, a senior from Armenia, led 6-2 in the tie
breaker when Salzenstein began a small comeback,
fighting off two match points to bring the score to 6-4.
Just when it appeared that Stanford's junior captain
had brought the tiebreak to a 6-5 deficit, however,
Sargsian made a questionable line call. Salzenstein had
ripped a perfect line-hugging passing shot out of
Sargsian's reach, but Sargsian saw it differently. He
called the ball out, and with that ended the match.
"Yeah, it was a pretty questionable call," Sargsian
admitted. "I almost didn't call it, but then I said 'No,
I've gotta go home.' "
The chair umpire refused the appeal of a disbeliev
ing Salzenstein, who some spectators felt was the vic
tim of what tennis players call a "hook."
Sargsian won the first set due to the combination of
his blistering serve and Salzenstein's initial overag
gressiveness.
"I beat him because I was holding my serve, to tell
you the truth," Sargsian said, ignoring his confessed
hook on match point. "Sometimes I serve really well,
but most of the time it just sucks."
Stanford head coach Dick Gould said Salzenstein
"went out and overhit a little bit
early in the match and gave the
guy a quick break and that kind of
set the tone. He was always play
ing catch-up from then on."
The Cardinal's other singles
defeat came at No. 6 singles, where
ASU's Wolf von Lindeneau defeat
ed freshman Charles Hoeveler, 6-
3, 6-4. Hoeveler was filling in for
an ailing Ricky Becker, whose
action was limited due to a collat
eral ligament sprain of the elbow.
Stanford's first opponent of the
break, BYU, provided a warm-up
for the Cardinal after its three
week layoff. Salzenstein manhan
dled Boris Bosnjakowic, 6-0, 6-0.
Freshman Scott Humphries,
ranked 16th and fresh off a three
set loss to Henrik Hohm in the
first round of the Lipton Champi
onships in Florida, defeated
Andrew Sheppert 6-2, 6-3. No. 38
Paul Goldstein beat Craig Man
ning 6-2, 6-3. In No. 4 singles, the
46th-ranked Thomas got past Paul
Fairchild, 6-2, 6-7, 6-4. And sopho
more Grant Elliott defeated Lance
Squire, 6-1, 7-6.
The Cardinal defeated ASU on
the strength of doubles victories by
Humphries and Goldstein (8-5
over Sargsian and Sergio Elias)
and Thomas and Becker (8-6 over
von Lindeneau and David Critch
le), as well as victories in singles by
Humphries (6-4, 7-5 over Elias),
Goldstein (6-1, 6-1 over Tsolak
Gevorkian), Thomas (6-3, 6-4 over
Paul Reber), and Elliott (6-3, 6-4
over Critchley).
Against Arizona last Saturday,
Stanford swept all the doubles
matches, then needed three sets in
just two of its singles matches to
dispose of the Wildcats. Salzen
stein defeated Sumberg 6-2, 6-3.
Humphries walloped Chris Jenk
ins, 6-1, 6-2. Jack Enfield took
Goldstein to three sets for the first
time in 14 matches before losing 6-
2, 3-6,6-2. Thomas crushed James
Rey, 6-1, 6-3. Elliott defeated Vuk
Tapuskovic, 7-6, 6-4. And Becker
returned to action in No. 6 singles
to defeat Roland Kupka, 3-6, 6-2,
6-2.
