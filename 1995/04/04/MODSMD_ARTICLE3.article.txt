# Yes, sex exists at Stanford
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Despite the pervasive
stereotype that Stanford stu
dents neither date nor have
sex, 71.8 percent of students
responding to an anonymous
Cowell health survey said
they had been sexually active
within the previous year.
The Cowell Student Health
Survey was conducted in May
1993, analyzing the mental
and physical health, alcohol
use and sexual practices of
1,155 graduate and underâ€¢
graduate students.
The recently released sta
tistics show that among the
sexually active respondents,
93 percent reported having
sex with partners of the oppo
site sex. Nearly 70 percent
said they had limited their ac
tivity to one partner, and
about 15 percent had three or
more partners within a year.
Forty-seven percent of sexu
ally active respondents said
they had been tested or
planned to be tested for the
HIV antibody.
Director of Student Health
Services Alejandro Martinez said
that the health awareness survey,
conducted once every three to
four years, is a tool for determin
ing the overall health needs for
Stanford students.
"It's one of the mechanisms we
use to find out what direction we
need to be moving and what
health issues we need to be focus
ing on," Martinez said.
The numbers concerning sexu
al activity are somewhat off the
national averages and represent a
drop when compared to the 1990
Cowell survey in which 76 percent
of respondents indicated sexual
activity.
The March 23 issue of Rolling
Stone, for example, reports that
75 percent of college freshmen
across the country are sexually

active before they enter higher
education. That number jumps to
90 percent by the time they reach
graduation.
Cowell released limited statis
tics gathered from the survey
analysis. Administrators at the
center are still compiling a final
report.
"Sexual activity is a fact of the
campus culture," said Cowell
Health Promotion Program
Director Carole Pertofsky. "We
live in very perplexing times when
it comes to sexual behavior."
And while sexual images per
vade pop culture, some Stanford
students have resisted sexual
pressures. Fourteen percent of
survey respondents said they
have never had sex.
Pertofsky said the data about
sexual activity will be used to
develop sex education programs
and establish priorities. However,
she added that sexuality was only
a portion of the study.
"This was not specifically a

study on sexual behavior, but we
wanted to take a broader view of
the overall health situation of
Stanford students," she said.
The survey also looked at alco
hol usage by Stanford students
and the combination of alcohol
and sex. Forty-three percent of
sexually active students reported
having sex while under the influ
ence of drugs or alcohol.
More than one-third of all
respondents said that they drove
while intoxicated or rode in a car
with an intoxicated driver during
the school year. Eighty-three per
cent of respondents said that they
had consumed alcohol in the past
year, with 27 percent of that
group having more than three to
five drinks per sitting.
The study also focused on stu
dents' mental and physical
health.
"The good news is that Stan
ford students are remarkably
resilient," Martinez said. "But
while there is good news, we

found out that we must pay more
attention in some fields, particu
larly when it comes to students'
concerns about weight and
appearance as well as alcohol
usage."
Overall, Stanford students
describe themselves as being in
good physical and emotional
health. Sixty-four percent of
respondents felt "energetic" and
over half said they were satisfied
with their academic perfor
mance.
But while Stanford students
are on the whole able to handle
stress well, a significant minority
said that they said that they expe
rienced "substantial psychological
distress."
According to Martinez, approx
imately 20 students on campus
annually are hospitalized for psy
chological problems ranging from
"suicidal thoughts and depression
to anxiety attacks and the classi
cal nervous breakdown," Mar
tinez said.
