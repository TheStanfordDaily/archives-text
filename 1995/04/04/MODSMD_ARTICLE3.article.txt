# Yes, sex exists at Stanford
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Despite the pervasive
stereotype that Stanford stu
dents neither date nor have
sex, 71.8 percent of students
responding to an anonymous
Cowell health survey said
they had been sexually active
within the previous year.
The Cowell Student Health
Survey was conducted in May
1993, analyzing the mental
and physical health, alcohol
use and sexual practices of
1,155 graduate and underâ€¢
graduate students.
The recently released sta
tistics show that among the
sexually active respondents,
93 percent reported having
sex with partners of the oppo
site sex. Nearly 70 percent
said they had limited their ac
tivity to one partner, and
about 15 percent had three or
more partners within a year.
Forty-seven percent of sexu
ally active respondents said
they had been tested or
planned to be tested for the
HIV antibody.
