# Rising to Pacific heights?
## Volleyball faces Tigers in Stockton tonight 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
With four wins over Spring Break, the
Stanford men's volleyball team is back in
position to determine its own fate in the
postseason. Second-ranked Hawaii, the Car
dinal's main rival in the Pacific Division of
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation,
held first place heading into last week. How
ever, after losing to Pepperdine and Long
Beach State, the Rainbows are once again
even in losses with Stanford, at four apiece.
"We're back in a position to win the divi
sion. If we can close the season with four
wins, maybe we can sneak by Hawaii [to
win the Pacific Division title]," Cardinal
head coach Ruben Nieves said.
Stanford's first step to accomplish this
goal will be to defeat the University of the
Pacific Tuesday night in Stockton, Calif.
The Tigers have already been eliminated
from the postseason MPSF tournament,
but will be looking to spoil the Cardinal's
championship dreams. Last year, Pacific
almost stole away the title from Stanford in
the regular season's final match. This year,
the Cardinal will be more wary of the poten
tial spoiler.
"We've learned our lesson as far as tak

ing lesser teams for granted," said sopho
more middle blocker Michael Hoeffer. "I'm
not worried as much about it though,
because of the way we've been playing late
ly." , r
Pacific is coming off its best weekend of
the season, defeating UCSD and upsetting
San Diego State in five games. The Cardinal
defeated the Tigers in a tough three-game
match (16-14, 15-13, 15-2) on March 3.
Pacific is led by the physical Matt Suttie,
a sophomore middle blocker whom Nieves
compares to Hawaii's dominating Jason
Olive. Opposite hitter Greg Wiikeham is
also a key contributor for the Tigers. He led
the squad with 24 kills in the team's earlier
faceoff with Stanford, although he was held
to a less-than-spectacular .261 hitting per
centage.
The Tuesday night match will be the
beginning of Stanford's pitched battle to
gain a favorable position in postseason play.
"We were inconsistent earlier in the
year," Nieves said, "but we're not as young
now as we were then. We've been consistent
for four matches, we've swept four teams in
a row. We want to be peaking right now."
