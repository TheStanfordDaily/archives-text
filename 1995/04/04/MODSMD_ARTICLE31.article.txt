While their classmates
relaxed after finals, members of
the Stanford track team didn't
enjoy much of a vacation during
break. On Saturday at the UC-
Irvine Invitational, the team fin
ished on top against tough com
petition from Air Force.
Sophomore Brian Manning
keyed the men's 257 to 249 point
victory over Air Force with a
winning leap of 23 feet BV* inch
es in the long jump and a Pacific
10 Conference qualifying 49-4 Vi
in the triple jump, both season
best efforts. Sophomore Joe
Newsum finished second in the
long jump with a jump of 22-10.
"The victory over Air Force is
a great win for us," said head
coach Vin Lananna. "We had
good performances all around."
In the throwing events, the
men demonstrated their
strength with the combined
efforts of freshman Adam Con
nolly, winner in the hammer

throw with 198-11, and senior
Toby Norwood, second place fin
isher in the hammer with a toss
of 196-6. Sophomore Pete Swan
son won the shot put with a toss
of 58-9V4; Norwood and Connolly
finished third and fourth,
respectively.
In the running events, the
men stayed close to the Air Force
leaders but could finish no high
er than second place. In the 1500
meters, sophomore J.J. White
took the silver behind Air
Force's Eric Mack. The 5000
meters exemplified the team
spirit of the Cardinal as fresh
man Jonathan Weldon, sopho
more Andy Cowgill and sopho
more Jason Perscheid finished
second, third and fourth, respec
tively, just seven seconds behind
Air Force's Andy Meshan.
That team spirit carried over
to the 800 meters as Air Force
won the top spot. Stanford run
ners finished two-three-four-five
