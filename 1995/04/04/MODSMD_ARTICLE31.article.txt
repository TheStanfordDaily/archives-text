# Track runs wild and free over the break
## 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
While their classmates
relaxed after finals, members of
the Stanford track team didn't
enjoy much of a vacation during
break. On Saturday at the UC-
Irvine Invitational, the team fin
ished on top against tough com
petition from Air Force.
Sophomore Brian Manning
keyed the men's 257 to 249 point
victory over Air Force with a
winning leap of 23 feet BV* inch
es in the long jump and a Pacific
10 Conference qualifying 49-4 Vi
in the triple jump, both season
best efforts. Sophomore Joe
Newsum finished second in the
long jump with a jump of 22-10.
"The victory over Air Force is
a great win for us," said head
coach Vin Lananna. "We had
good performances all around."
In the throwing events, the
men demonstrated their
strength with the combined
efforts of freshman Adam Con
nolly, winner in the hammer

throw with 198-11, and senior
Toby Norwood, second place fin
isher in the hammer with a toss
of 196-6. Sophomore Pete Swan
son won the shot put with a toss
of 58-9V4; Norwood and Connolly
finished third and fourth,
respectively.
In the running events, the
men stayed close to the Air Force
leaders but could finish no high
er than second place. In the 1500
meters, sophomore J.J. White
took the silver behind Air
Force's Eric Mack. The 5000
meters exemplified the team
spirit of the Cardinal as fresh
man Jonathan Weldon, sopho
more Andy Cowgill and sopho
more Jason Perscheid finished
second, third and fourth, respec
tively, just seven seconds behind
Air Force's Andy Meshan.
That team spirit carried over
to the 800 meters as Air Force
won the top spot. Stanford run
ners finished two-three-four-five
with senior Dan McGinn, junior

Zak Wright, and junior Joe Karl
gaard within 0.6 seconds of eai h
other.
"We should have put someone
in front of the Air Force guy," said
McGinn. "You need someone to go
for the number one spot."
On the women's side, sopho
more Tyra Holt and freshman
Heather Miller each won two
events to lead Stanford to a 228 to

-147 victory over Air Force. At the
Stanford Invitational a week earli
er, Holt had tied the American
record in the pole vault, clearing
11 -6 V* and earning herself a spot at
the U.S. Olympic trials for the
1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
"I'm glad I've been given the
opportunity to do the pole vault,"
Holt said. "I never expected to do
this well. It's really great, it's unex
pected." This is the first year that
collegiate women compete in the
pole vault.
At Irvine, Holt led the victorious
Cardinal with first place finishes in
the 400 meters (56.31) and the long

jump (19-5V4). Heather Miller com
pleted an impressive sprint double
victory as she took gold with a time
of 12.40 seconds in the 100 meters
and 25.19 in the 200.
Freshman Bernadette Armand
ran 14.77 to win the 100-meter
hurdles. Senior Anne Lee took sec
ond just 0.12 seconds behind
Armand. Freshman Gina Heads
hurled the hammer 132-2 to win
the event, and freshman Sami Jo
Small continued her impressive
performance in the javelin with a
winning toss of 146-7.
"On the women's side we domi
nated most of the events," Lanan

na said.
The dual-meet mentality pro
vided the Stanford team a greater
sense of competition and team
unity. While several people excelled
individually, the bulk of the win
over Air Force came from numer
ous second- and third-place finish
es that snatched up the available
points in the meet.
"It was a really good team effort
— there was a really strong Stan
ford presence," Holt said. "The
competition in the dual meets
makes you really dig deeper for the
team."
Lananna agrees that his teams

now are better prepared for the rig
ors of dual-meet competition. By
adjusting the season schedule to a
more diverse combination of invita
tionals, dual meets and champi
onship events, Lananna said he
feels that the athletes can perform
at a higher level at the more impor
tant meets.
"We were out of the dual-meet
business for a number of years,"
Lananna said.
Now Lananna has the Cardinal
competing in more dual meets
against more top competition. The
close victory over Air Force proves
the success of Lananna's strategy.

Early in March, Stanford lost a
close dual competition to Fresno
State while defeating Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo.
Oregon and Oregon State come
to Stanford Stadium this Saturday
for a meet providing what Lananna
called "formidable" competition.
The Stanford Invitational over
spring break was a national show
case for the Cardinal program, but
a victory over the highly ranked
Ducks and the tough dual-meet
competitors of Fresno State would
provide the Stanford team the kind
of emotional boost that could carry
it to the NCAAs.
