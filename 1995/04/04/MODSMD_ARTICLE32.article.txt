# Women's tennis rolls in South
## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
Sunbathing and sipping margaritas were not
exactly high priorities for the seventh-ranked Stan
ford women's tennis team (15-2 overall, 3-0 in the
Pacific 10 Conference's Southern Division) last week
in tropical Southern California as the Cardinal
scorched llth-ranked Pepperdine, San Diego State
and UC-Santa Barbara in succession.
"We're getting into the crunch time of the sea

son," said head coach Frank Brennan. "These teams
were good solid opponents, so it was a good test. I
think this is sort of the first day of the rest of your
life kind of thing. It's time to get serious and put a
little different spin on the season."
These meets measured big in Brennan's eyes
after a disappointing home loss to Texas in March
and before tough Pac-10 South rivals UCLA and
USC come to pay a visit to Palo Alto this upcoming
weekend.
