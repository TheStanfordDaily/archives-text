# Women's tennis rolls in South
## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
Sunbathing and sipping margaritas were not
exactly high priorities for the seventh-ranked Stan
ford women's tennis team (15-2 overall, 3-0 in the
Pacific 10 Conference's Southern Division) last week
in tropical Southern California as the Cardinal
scorched llth-ranked Pepperdine, San Diego State
and UC-Santa Barbara in succession.
"We're getting into the crunch time of the sea

son," said head coach Frank Brennan. "These teams
were good solid opponents, so it was a good test. I
think this is sort of the first day of the rest of your
life kind of thing. It's time to get serious and put a
little different spin on the season."
These meets measured big in Brennan's eyes
after a disappointing home loss to Texas in March
and before tough Pac-10 South rivals UCLA and
USC come to pay a visit to Palo Alto this upcoming
weekend.
The Cardinal finished off the
three-match sweep with a 7-2 vic
tory over UC-Santa Barbara in
which Brennan was forced to mix
and match the lineup due to ill
nesses to both freshman Ania
Bleszynski and senior Amy
Chiminello and a slight hip injury
to senior Kim Shasby. Neverthe
less, opportunities for others
arose, and the Cardinal took
advantage of them.
Sophomore Katie Schlukebir
(11-4) sat in her familiar No. 1
spot and dominated opponent
Jean Okada in straight sets, 6-0,
6-4. Shasby (10-4), playing up at
No. 2 for the ill Bleszynski (8-4),
played through the bad hip, but
fell 6-4, 5-7, 6-2 in Stanford's only
singles defeat.
Sophomore Sandra De Silva
(12-2) stepped into the N0.3 posi
tion comfortably, disposing of
Kathy Peterson 6-2, 6-3. Fresh
man Julie Scott (14-2), shifted up
one spot as well and narrowly
avoided a third set as she finished
off Amelia White in a second set
tie-breaker, 6-2, 7-6.
Beth Berris (2-0), back in
action last week after lengthy
recuperation of a wrist injury,
found a groove in blowing away
Kelly Spencer in straight sets, 6-
3, 6-3 in the No. 5 match. Junior
Wendy Sacks (6-0) continued to
provide solid play off the bench
with a 6-3, 6-2 saucing of Court
ney Strauss in the No. 6 match.
The Cardinal also won two of
three doubles matches despite the
fact that the three teams taking
the court for Stanford had just
one match of experience together.
Berris and Schlukebir (2-0)
teamed up for the second time
this season for a 6-7, 7-5, 6-2 vic
tory in the No. 1 match against
Spencer and White.
A unique combination of Scott
and sophomore Emily Burt filled
the No. 2 position for the Cardinal
as their respective partners,
Chiminello and Shasby, both
received rests from Brennan.
Scott and Burt lost to Okada and

Coakley in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2.
De Silva and Sacks joined forces
for the first time as well, but
found more success in putting
down Peterson and Strauss 6-3,
4-6, 6-4.
Stanford's highest ranked
opponent of the week, the 11th
ranked Pepperdine Waves, proved
no more successful against the
focused Cardinal. Stanford
recorded five straight set singles
victories by Schlukebir, Shasby,
De Silva, Scott and Berris.
Chiminello dropped her first
match of the season, falling in a 6-
4, 6-1 loss to Annabel Rognon.
Stanford pushed the final score
to 8-1 with a doubles sweep.
Berris and Schlukebir rode the
momentum of a tough 7-5 first set
and finished the No. 1 match
strong in the second set, 6-2. At
the No. 2 position, Burt and Shas
by bulldozed through Isabela
Petrov and Natasha Pospich 6-3,
6-1. Scott and Sacks then com
pleted the sweep in the third
match with a 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 tie
breaker win over Tomoko Tsuru
tani and Rognon.
On the previous day, the Cardi
nal registered its fourth 9-0 sweep
of the season in ousting San Diego
State. Stanford dominated the
Aztecs in singles competition as
Schlukebir, Bleszynski, De Silva,
Scott and Sacks all recorded
straight-set victories. Only Shas
by was extended to three sets; she
lost the first set but then turned
her game up a notch to dominate
the rest of the match, 6-7, 6-3, 6-
4.
Bleszynski and Schlukebir, in
their only appearance of the week,
also needed three sets in winning,
6-7, 7-5, 6-0. The second and third
doubles squads breezed, however,
as both Burt and Shasby and
Scott and Berris cruised in
straight sets, 6-4, 6-4, and 6-1, 6-
1, respectively.
"I think the girls were good,"
said Brennan. "They were good
and they were focused. We had a
chance to talk about some things
since there was no stress from
school."
Berris' return to the Stanford
lineup highlighted the week's
activities as she was undefeated in

both of her singles matches and
all three of her doubles matches.
"It felt so good to be back out
there," Berris said. "It's been
hard to just watch my team all
year. I just realized in those first
matches how much I missed it
and how much I missed the com
petitive aspects of tennis."
"I think in terms of health I'm
pretty much completely healthy,"
said Berris in addressing her sta
tus at this point. "My wrist got real
tired. I'd say I'm about 90 percent.
My game is not at 100 percent yet,
but I was happy with my play."

"I think having her get ready
at this point in this season will be
very helpful for us," Brennan
said. "She's going to be our utility
infielder so to speak, our utility
infielder and outfielder and short
relief pitcher. She's capable of
playing singles or doubles, high or
low, anywhere you want in the
lineup. We're always going to
have somebody with some nicks,
and we're just very fortunate to
have her come off the bench, and
she's ready, willing and able to do
that. She's another piece to the
puzzle."

for the first time as well, but
found more success in putting
down Peterson and Strauss 6-3,
4-6, 6-4.
Stanford's highest ranked
opponent of the week, the 11th
ranked Pepperdine Waves, proved
no more successful against the
focused Cardinal. Stanford
recorded five straight set singles
victories by Schlukebir, Shasby,
De Silva, Scott and Berris.
Chiminello dropped her first
match of the season, falling in a 6-
4, 6-1 loss to Annabel Rognon.
Stanford pushed the final score
to 8-1 with a doubles sweep.
Berris and Schlukebir rode the
momentum of a tough 7-5 first set
and finished the No. 1 match
strong in the second set, 6-2. At
the No. 2 position, Burt and Shas
by bulldozed through Isabela
Petrov and Natasha Pospich 6-3,
6-1. Scott and Sacks then com
pleted the sweep in the third
match with a 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 tie
breaker win over Tomoko Tsuru
tani and Rognon.
On the previous day, the Cardi
nal registered its fourth 9-0 sweep
of the season in ousting San Diego
State. Stanford dominated the
Aztecs in singles competition as
Schlukebir, Bleszynski, De Silva,
Scott and Sacks all recorded
straight-set victories. Only Shas
by was extended to three sets; she
lost the first set but then turned
her game up a notch to dominate
the rest of the match, 6-7, 6-3, 6-
4.
Bleszynski and Schlukebir, in
their only appearance of the week,
also needed three sets in winning,
6-7, 7-5, 6-0. The second and third
doubles squads breezed, however,
as both Burt and Shasby and
Scott and Berris cruised in
straight sets, 6-4, 6-4, and 6-1, 6-
1, respectively.
"I think the girls were good,"
said Brennan. "They were good
and they were focused. We had a
chance to talk about some things
since there was no stress from
school."
Berris' return to the Stanford
lineup highlighted the week's
activities as she was undefeated in

both of her singles matches and
all three of her doubles matches.
"It felt so good to be back out
there," Berris said. "It's been
hard to just watch my team all
year. I just realized in those first
matches how much I missed it
and how much I missed the com
petitive aspects of tennis."
"I think in terms of health I'm
pretty much completely healthy,"
said Berris in addressing her sta
tus at this point. "My wrist got real
tired. I'd say I'm about 90 percent.
My game is not at 100 percent yet,
but I was happy with my play."

"I think having her get ready
at this point in this season will be
very helpful for us," Brennan
said. "She's going to be our utility
infielder so to speak, our utility
infielder and outfielder and short
relief pitcher. She's capable of
playing singles or doubles, high or
low, anywhere you want in the
lineup. We're always going to
have somebody with some nicks,
and we're just very fortunate to
have her come off the bench, and
she's ready, willing and able to do
that. She's another piece to the
puzzle."
