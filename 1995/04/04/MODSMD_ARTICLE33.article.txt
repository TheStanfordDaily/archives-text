A couple days off never hurt
anybody.
A two-week break from com
petition helped the 18th-ranked
Stanford baseball team break
out of its early season slump and
move into first place in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division (Six-Pac).
Stanford won five of six
games over spring break —
including the last five in a row —
to catapult past California into
the conference lead. The Cardi
nal (19-12 overall, 10-4 in the
Six-Pac) took two of three from
Arizona State at Sunken Dia
mond before sweeping the Ari
zona Wildcats at home last

weekend.
Stanford dropped its first
game after taking 12 days off for
Dead Week and final exams
before going on a tear with a
combination of powerful offense
and solid pitching.
After Arizona State pounded
out an 8-5 victory at Sunken
Diamond to open spring break
on a sour note, the Cardinal
came back with an impressive
victory the next afternoon.
Freshman designated hitter
Chris Draft belted his first colle
giate home run as Stanford
notched a 6-3 win over the fifth
ranked Sun Devils. Sophomore
starter Jason Middlebrook
emerged out of his season-long
slump the same afternoon,
silencing the powerful Arizona
State offense to finally pick up
his first win of the season.
Junior Ail-American catcher
A.J. Hinch continued the Cardi
nal's offensive power against the
Sun Devils with a three-run first
inning home run the next day as
Stanford captured the rubber
game of the series, 9-6.

The Cardinal bats came alive over spring break as Stanford took five of six
games.
throughout 1995 — continued his
strong season on the hill, working
well into the ninth inning to pick
up his fifth win of the year.
The Cardinal then traveled to
Tucson to flex its muscle against
the cellar-dwelling Wildcats. Stan
ford — a team known more for its
pitching staff than its offensive
prowess — pounded out 38 runs in
the series and swept all three
games at Arizona's Sancet Field.
The first game of the three was
clearly the most contested as the
Cardinal needed to plate six runs in
the top of the ninth inning to
escape with a 12-8 victory.
Junior lefthander Dan Reed, the
Cardinal's ace pitcher, struggled
against the Wildcats, allowing five
runs in the fifth inning as Arizona
built an 8-6 lead. But, as has often
been the case in 1995, Stanford
bats did not surrender, belting six
hits in the ninth inning to gain the
victory. Junior left fielder Cale
Carter led the offensive charge on
the afternoon, going 5-for-6 with

three RBIs and three runs scored.
The Cardinal's offensive surge
carried over into the next afternoon
when Steve Carver launched his
second grand slam of the season to
give Stanford an 8-5 win. Carver's
sixth inning blast gave the Cardinal
a 6-3 lead as junior starting pitcher
Mike Robbins worked into the
eight to pick up the win.
Stanford closed out spring break
in fitting fashion on Sunday after
noon with an 18-3 trouncing of the
Wildcats. This time, the Cardinal
wasted no time getting things going
offensively, scoring 17 times over
the first five innings to cruise to its
10th conference win of the season.
Hinch led the charge, going 3-
for-6 with two RBIs, four runs
scored and two stolen bases on
Sunday; Carver added his second
long ball in as many days to put
Stanford where many predicted it
to be all along — in first place.
The Cardinal will be back in
action this afternoon at Sunken
Diamond in a non-conference bat
tle with San Jose State beginning
at 2:30 p.m. And, considering the
way they're playing right now, the
last thing they need is a few more
days off.
