A couple days off never hurt
anybody.
A two-week break from com
petition helped the 18th-ranked
Stanford baseball team break
out of its early season slump and
move into first place in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division (Six-Pac).
Stanford won five of six
games over spring break —
including the last five in a row —
to catapult past California into
the conference lead. The Cardi
nal (19-12 overall, 10-4 in the
Six-Pac) took two of three from
Arizona State at Sunken Dia
mond before sweeping the Ari
zona Wildcats at home last

weekend.
Stanford dropped its first
game after taking 12 days off for
Dead Week and final exams
before going on a tear with a
combination of powerful offense
and solid pitching.
After Arizona State pounded
out an 8-5 victory at Sunken
Diamond to open spring break
on a sour note, the Cardinal
came back with an impressive
victory the next afternoon.
Freshman designated hitter
Chris Draft belted his first colle
giate home run as Stanford
notched a 6-3 win over the fifth
ranked Sun Devils. Sophomore
starter Jason Middlebrook
emerged out of his season-long
slump the same afternoon,
silencing the powerful Arizona
State offense to finally pick up
his first win of the season.
Junior Ail-American catcher
A.J. Hinch continued the Cardi
nal's offensive power against the
Sun Devils with a three-run first
inning home run the next day as
Stanford captured the rubber
game of the series, 9-6.
Freshman pitcher Kyle Peter
son — who has been impressive

The Cardinal bats came alive over spring break as Stanford took five of six
games.
