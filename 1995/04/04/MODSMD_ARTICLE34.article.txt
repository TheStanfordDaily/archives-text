The Stanford sailing team
wants history to repeat itself. In
what the Cardinal hopes will
serve as a prelude to the upcom
ing district and national regattas,
the team captured first and sec
ond place finishes in the week
end's South Six and designated

district regattas.
Saturday's competition got off
to a blazing start as Stanford
painted the competition Cardinal
red. Although the team came into
the event favored, the blowout on
the scoreboard was still a sur
prise. In the low-point scoring
system, Stanford posted a tally of

Stanford sailors enjoyed a productive break with first and second
place finishes.
16, with UC-Irvine finishing a dis
tant second with 44 points.
Senior Charles Meade and fresh
man Betsy Charmichael represent
ed Stanford in the A division, with
freshman John Meade and sopho
more Megan Ireson maneuvering
the B division boat. The two boats
coupled to capture the majority of
first place finishes in the day's
races.
"They had a string of bullets
that was unending," Bourdow
said, referring to the first place fin
ishes.
Stanford was also able to enter a
second team consisting of junior
Adam Lowery and freshman Mara
Holian in the A division and Alice
Maynard and Cybil Diver in the B
division. Their excellent perfor
mance earned the sailors a fourth
place finish overall. Impressed with
the work of Maynard and Diver,
Bourdow has high hopes for the

duo in upcoming district and
national competition.
"They're really showing poten
tial," Bourdow said.
Naturally, Saturday's results
against the top teams in the West
ern region pleased coach Bourdow.
"I was happy we finished so well,"
he said. "We proved our point."
Riding high after the first day,
the Cardinal came back to earth
with a second place finish behind a
surprisingly strong California
squad. Stanford used the same
teams in Sunday's competition, but
came up two points shy of victory.
Hoping to give his team a chal
lenge, Bourdow used slower equip
ment in the second regatta. Choppy
conditions and heavier wind also
hampered Stanford. Cal took
advantage of the stronger breeze to
post a victory that will keep the
Cardinal on its toes while preparing
for the district championship to be
held at the same Long Beach site
the end of the month.
"I was a little disappointed. I
really thought we could have done
better on Sunday," said Bourdow.
