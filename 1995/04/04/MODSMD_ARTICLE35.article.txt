# A 						tournament you didn't see
## 
### 
Hopefully, last Saturday's Stanford-UConn
matchup wasn't the only time you watched
women's hoops all year. That just wouldn't
be fair.

While most eyes were focused on one of the
more exciting men's tourneys in recent memory,
the women staged a show featuring more nail
biters than your average kindergarten class. Of
course, CBS got two yawners on Saturday.
CBS had its eye on more men's tournament
games before St. Patrick's Day (four) than it
would air women's games at all (three). No won
der most women's fans were seeing green. As a
Stanford fan without cable, you could watch the

Stone
men win their first NCAA game in
53 years and then get plastered by
UMass. But while the women won
four times, you could only watch
them shoot 22 percent in the first
half and fall prey to the Huskies.
You saw Miami of Ohio stun
Arizona and Lawrence Moten's
nonexistent time out and Tyus
Edney's buzzer-beater and Old
Dominion's win in triple overtime
over Villanova (well, at least two
out of three OTs). But in the
women's tourney, you saw Ten
nessee steamroll Georgia and
UConn rout Stanford before final
ly witnessing a great title game.
There was so much else to see.
For starters, you missed more
overtimes than the women's tour
ney had ever seen. Duke and
Alabama staged one of the most
incredible games ever on March 18
before a whopping crowd of 1,966.
Not to be outdone by ODU-Vil
lanova, these two teams needed
four extra frames to settle the
score.

When the last bead of sweat had
fallen, the Crimson Tide had
allowed more points (120) than
any team in tournament history â€”
except Duke, which had surren
dered 121. Alabama took 18 more
three-pointers than anybody had
ever done, and Duke scored 26
more points than any previous
loser. But can you call Duke's Jen
Scanlon, who played all 60 min
utes, a loser?
Then there's Drake, the No. 5
seed in the Midwest and universal
ly regarded as the most overrated
seed in the field. After opening the
tourney by knocking off favored
12-seed Mississippi in overtime,
they met George Washington, the
unquestionably worst fourth seed.
With a 17-point lead and less
than five minutes to go, the Bull
dogs jumped for joy and were plan
ning to join powerhouses UConn
and Tennessee as squad playing
before home crowds at regionals.
Then the roof caved in, as the Colo
nials rallied all the way back to
force OT and win by three. Even if
you had access to watch this one,
you might have flipped the channel
early and filled Drake in your
bracket.

With one weekend in the books,
the women's tournament had seen
four overtime games plus one four
overtime contest. Unfortunately,
you would have never heard this
from Gary Radnich or even Keith
Olbermann. And certainly not
from self-proclaimed Mr. College
Basketball Dick Vitale.
But for the regional semis,
Prime joined the act. The Stan
ford-North Carolina contest was
broadcast live to most of the
nation's cable operators, except the
Bay Area. Problem? Sharks game
comes first. Ugh.
So, you never heard Pauley
Pavilion's public address announc
er pronounce Tar a VanDerveer as
"Tyra VanDerbeleer" and reverse
the final scores of not one but two
regional semifinals. And you didn't
see a world-class sprinter in Tar
Heel Marion Jones. Kristin Folkl
bettered her career highs in scor
ing and rebounding for the third
time in four games, but you only
heard that from some pretty good
radio commentators.
Before that game, you and
8,000 fans who could have filled
the empty seats in Pauley Pavilion
missed this year's only buzzer

beating trifecta when Purdue's
Jannon Roland nailed a three to
stun Vanderbilt, the team that
every Stanford fan just knew
shouldn't have been seeded No. 1.
Elsewhere that night, the high
est seed remaining in either tour
nament bowed out. North Carolina
State, the 7-seed, had dealt Penn
State its annual choke before bow
ing to Georgia. In Connecticut,
Virginia assured that Louisiana
Tech would not advance to its
record ninth Final Four, scoring
on its last possession to pull out a
one-point victory.
On Saturday, March 25, ESPN,
which will get exclusive rights to
the women's tourney beginning
next year and lasting through
2003, broadcast a quadruplehead
er featuring all four regional finals.
Tennessee waltzed by Texas Tech
and Colorado, expected by all to
advance to its first Final Four after
Penn State's loss, had all but
packed its bags against Georgia.
The Buffs were up 10 in the lat
ter stages of the second half when
the Bulldogs went crazy. Final
score: Georgia 82, Colorado 79.
East Coasters who stayed up
until 2 a.m. got maybe their first

glimpse of Stanford in 1995, and
the Cardinal's offensive troubles in
that game may have provided a
hint as to what would occur vs.
UConn. But after the Huskies sur
rendered a 34-8 run earlier in the
day to Virginia in Storrs, Conn.,
Cardinal fans were giddy with
expectations of an upset.
But the UConn team that
showed up the first day of April
proved that its first-half collapse a
week earlier was merely a cruel
April Fools joke. The Huskies got
out to an early 19-point lead as
they had against Virginia. But this
time, Coach Geno Auriemma and
his three Ail-Americans prolonged
the clinic.
So much for playing in the
chump conference. So much for
the supposed lack of athleticism on
the Huskies. So much for the two
player bench. Maybe the criticism
was true, but UConn was just
good. And Stanford has never shot
the ball worse. Ever.
The Cardinal was nine for 41
from the floor in those first 20
minutes. Shots that had always
fallen, that the Cardinal had taken
for granted, clanged off the rim. Or
never hit the iron. If you were tun

ing in for the first time, you'd won
der how on earth Stanford had
come so far.
And that's too bad. Because,
after all, Stanford won 30 games by
an average of over 25 points. Van-
Derveer and company returned to
the Final Four for the first time in
three seasons and won the Pac-10
for the sixth time in seven years.
But the impression that may linger
in fans back East and in Min
neapolis, the site of the Final Four,
is that Stanford was just one of
many to be steamrolled by UConn,
only the second undefeated
women's team in NCAA history.
Next year, ESPN will have all
the regionals and whatever it
desires from the first weekend.
Presumably, the folks in Bristol,
Conn., will offer more women's
hoops than ever to the nation, so
fans from the network's home!
state will see more than just their
beloved Huskies. And maybe
women's basketball will stop being
the best-kept secret in sports.

Jcremy is a little bitter about the out
come Saturday, but he still wants to
thank the team for a free trip to Min
neapolis and a thrilling season.
