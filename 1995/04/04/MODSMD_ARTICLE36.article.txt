# Golf falls twice to Georgia Tech
## 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
Someone forgot to tell the
Stanford men's golf team to relax
between quarters.
The Cardinal worked through
out the week on a three-tourna
ment whirlwind tour. After post
ing a win in the Southwestern
Intercollegiate in Westlake Vil
lage, Calif., the team lost twice to
No. 3 Georgia Tech, falling first
in a head-to-head match in
Atlanta before going on to finish
second to the Yellow Jackets at
the Carpet Capital Classic in Dal
ton, Ga.
"We didn't play particularly
well," said senior Ail-American
Steve Burdick. "Not to make
excuses or anything, but I think a
lot of it was that we were really
tired. It was a really hard week of
traveling."
Indeed, the team was definite
ly on the road for a healthy por
tion of the week. After finishing
the tournament in Southern Cal
ifornia, the golfers made a mad
dash to the airport in time to
catch a late flight to Atlanta.
Arriving around 3 a.m. on Tues
day morning, the team was
expected to hit the course later
that morning for a practice
round.
"We spent so much of the trip
hopping onto planes, driving,
stopping and then driving some
more," Burdick said. "It kind of
took its toll."
Many of the team's problems
could also be attributed to lack of
practice. A number of factors
kept Stanford off the links in the
weeks leading up to the trip, and
the combination of finals and
heavy rain made it difficult for
the team to get much practice

time.
"We really didn't get much of a
chance to prepare with our home
course underwater," said head
coach Wally Goodwin. "And obvi
ously, if you don't have a chance
to prepare, you can't expect your
best performance.
"I think all things considered
however, the guys did well,"
Goodwin added.
The team kicked the week off
by demonstrating their strength
at the Southwestern. Against a
competitive field which included
top ten rivals Oklahoma, Arizona
State and Houston, the team
overcame mediocre play on the
first day to storm back on the next
two and take the title.
Immediately following was the
highly anticipated match-play
battle between the Cardinal and
the Yellow Jackets at Druid Hills
Golf Course in Atlanta. Georgia
Tech rode its home-course advan
tage to a 4-1 win as only senior
Ail-American Notah Begay
defeated his opponent.

Billed as a meeting of collegiate
goliaths, the event was headlined
by the matchup between Stanford
freshman Tiger Woods, the top
golfer in the country, and Georgia
Tech's Stewart Cink, second to
Woods in the rankings. Much to
the delight of the massive gallery
that had gathered for the meet,
Cink won the round .
"It was a fabulous event,"
Goodwin said. "It was a great
course and it was a thrill to final
ly get to play on it. With the high
level of competition, the huge gal
leries, and the media coverage, it
was just a great event."
Unfortunately, Georgia Tech
continued its dominance as the
teams joined 13 others in Dalton
for Tech's annual invitational.
Again, the field was highly com
petitive as eight of the top 20
teams in the nation were repre
sented.
After one round, the Cardinal
held the lead and it appeared that
the team felt at home playing on a
course nicknamed "The Farm."
However, the team faltered on the
second day, fighting windy condi
tions to finish with a team score
of 304, 16-over par. Meanwhile,
the Yellow Jackets produced a

spectacular effort, finishing 10-
under par and 11 strokes ahead of
their nearest opponent.
"We really played poorly on the
second day," Begay said. "We just
couldn't do anything and really
knocked ourselves out of con
tention."
The team rallied on the third
day, but its strong finish wasn't
enough to overcome Tech's lead;
Stanford was forced to settle for
second. Individually, Woods fin
ished second to add to his runner
up finish at the Southwestern
and Begay finished third, both
falling to tournament champion
Cink.
"They really just blew us away
in the second round," Burdick
said. "We dug ourselves a huge
hole and we couldn't quite get out
of it."
The Cardinal returns home for
two weeks before traveling to
Tempe, Ariz, for Arizona State's
invitational. The team hopes to
take advantage of the good weath
er to prepare itself more ade
quately before then.
"Our play this week was defi
nitely an indication," Begay said.
"It shows that we still have a lot
of work to do before NCAAs."
