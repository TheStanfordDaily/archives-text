# Golf falls twice to Georgia Tech
## 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
Someone forgot to tell the
Stanford men's golf team to relax
between quarters.
The Cardinal worked through
out the week on a three-tourna
ment whirlwind tour. After post
ing a win in the Southwestern
Intercollegiate in Westlake Vil
lage, Calif., the team lost twice to
No. 3 Georgia Tech, falling first
in a head-to-head match in
Atlanta before going on to finish
second to the Yellow Jackets at
the Carpet Capital Classic in Dal
ton, Ga.
"We didn't play particularly
well," said senior Ail-American
Steve Burdick. "Not to make
excuses or anything, but I think a
lot of it was that we were really
tired. It was a really hard week of
traveling."
Indeed, the team was definite
ly on the road for a healthy por
tion of the week. After finishing
the tournament in Southern Cal
ifornia, the golfers made a mad
dash to the airport in time to
catch a late flight to Atlanta.
Arriving around 3 a.m. on Tues
day morning, the team was
expected to hit the course later
that morning for a practice
round.
"We spent so much of the trip
hopping onto planes, driving,
stopping and then driving some
more," Burdick said. "It kind of
took its toll."
Many of the team's problems
could also be attributed to lack of
practice. A number of factors
kept Stanford off the links in the
weeks leading up to the trip, and
the combination of finals and
heavy rain made it difficult for
the team to get much practice
