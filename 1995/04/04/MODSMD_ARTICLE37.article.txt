# Worlds here?
## Stanford may host 1997 Track Championships 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
In a few years, Stanford could
be the host of the premier track
and field event in the world. The
San Jose Mercury News reported
Sunday that Athletics Director
Ted Leland has shown interest
in hosting at Stanford Stadium
the week-long Track and Field
World Championships in August
1997.
"It would be great for Stan
ford University and the Stanford
track team," said senior 800-
meter runner Dan McGinn.
Track and Field Director Vin
Lananna cautioned against mak
ing any hasty conclusions
regarding the possibility of the
first championships in North

America.
"There are many hurdles to
go through before we [Stanford]
host the World Championships,"
Lananna said.
The intended site for the meet
was Mexico City, but the country
withdrew last month citing
national economic concerns. The
International Amateur Athletics
Federation considers the United
States and North America a
largely untapped source of
potential revenue for the sport.
While track and field has
prospered in Europe and the rest
of the world, the sport has failed
to effectively penetrate the Unit
ed States market.
The lAAF is said to have been
particularly impressed by Stan
ford's money-making manage

ment of the World Cup soccer
tournament, another sport that
has been unpopular in America.
The world-wide interest in the
championships and the LAAF's
interest in earning more money
convinced the Federation to hold
the meet every two non-Olympic
years instead of every four.
Bringing the World Champi
onships to Stanford in 1997
could be the next coup for Leland
and the Athletics Department
after hosting several World Cup
soccer matches last summer.
An lAAF spokesman in Monte
Carlo said: "We'd always wanted
the championships on the Amer
ican continent, hence Mexico,
and a bid by a U.S. city would fit
that bill. We hope it happens, for
the good of the sport."
