# Wrestlers don't place at NCAAs

Nothing seemed to go right for
the Stanford wrestling team at
the NCAA championships from
March 16-18, as none of the four
Cardinal qualifiers placed. The
team took 48th place.
"We really prepared well,"
said head coach Chris Horpel. "It
was one of those times when
everything seems right for an
upset but it just didn't happen."
Junior Tod Surmon came the
closest to placing and was the
only Cardinal wrestler to win a
match. After winning his first
round match, Surmon faced Ari
zona State's Jeff Theiler. At the
Pacific 10 championships on Feb.
24-25, Surmon upset Theiler,
who was No. 2 in the nation and
the Pac-10's top-ranked wrestler
at 150 pounds at the time. But at
the NCAAs, Theiler beat Sur
mon, who was suffering from a
cold.
"I wasn't wrestling well on my
feet [at the beginning of the
match]," Surmon said. "I let him
take me down in the first round.

It was my only big mistake."
In his consolation match, Sur
mon came out strong and wres
tled hard but his sickness caught
up with him and he burned out
in the end, he said. Theiler even
tually placed third and Surmon
finished the year ranked 11th in
the country.
"I was mentally ready," Sur
mon said. "I didn't have it all
physically."
Senior co-captain Jay Jackson
was the only other Cardinal to
wrestle more than one match. In
his first round match, he met the
second seed at 134 pounds. Jack
son had an early takedown of his
opponent and led, 2-1, at the end
of the first round. With a minute
left in the match and Jackson up
3-1, he lost his focus and was
taken down. In his consolation
match, nothing went right and
Jackson suffered his second loss
of the tournament, ending his
college career.
"Jay was very disappointed,"
Horpel said. "His first match was
very close. He just lost his focus
for a moment. [Jackson's conso
lation matchl was a wrestlintr

nightmare. It was one of those
matches where everything goes
wrong."
Juniors Jimmy Aguirre and
Matt Cano both lost their first
round matches. Both were
denied a consolation match
because the athlete that beat
them did not make the quarterfi
nals.
"I just got out-wrestled," said
Cano, who competed in his first
NCAA championship. "I was
very ready for this tournament.
My opponent just wrestled better
than I did. It was a good experi
ence and I'll be back next year."
Overall, the year was marked
by rapid improvement arid great
results at the end, according to
Horpel. Once the Cardinal had
all of its starters in the line-up,
Stanford could compete with the
top teams, including Oregon
State, which finished second at
the NCAA championships behind
lowa. The Cardinal split its 10
matches in its 26-18 loss to the
Beavers on Jan. 28.
The Stanford wrestling team
did everything this year except
produce an All-American.
