# Cal up next for men's netters
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
The non-postseason-bound Cal
ifornia men's basketball team
must have left the groundskeepers
in Berkeley with a lot of spare time
on their hands. Why else would
they be outfitting Harmon Arena
with a tennis court for this
evening's matchup between the
No. 1 Stanford (15-0 overall, 4-0 in
the Pacific-10 Conference) and No.
21 California (9-2, 2-1 in the Pac
-10) men's tennis teams?
In a format reminiscent of the
old days of tennis in Maples Pavil
ion, the Nos. 2 through 6 doubles
and singles matches will be played
outdoors at Hellman Tennis
Courts beginning at 1:30 p.m. At
6:30 p.m., the match will move
indoors to Harmon, where Cal's
eighth-ranked duo of Michael Hill
and Bobby Mahal will take on the
nation's second-ranked team, Car
dinal freshmen Scott Humphries
and Paul Goldstein. The finale,
which Cal hopes will be the decid

ing dual match of the meet, will pit
Hill against Stanford's seventh
ranked JefT Salzenstein in a No. 1
singles battle.
"On paper, we should beat Cal,"
said Stanford junior Ricky Becker,
"but whenever we go there, weird
stufT always seems to happen, and
we end up with pretty tight match
es. Plus Cal is having a really good
year."
Cal has already scored impres
sive dual-match victories over No.
11 Miami, No. 17 Arizona State
and No. 25 Fresno State. In their
last meeting, the Cardinal defeated
the Golden Bears in a Feb. 18 dual
match at Stanford, 6-1. But don't
be deceived. Many of the Cal play
ers were ailing early in the season,
but are stronger now. And don't
forget that match saw Hill and
Mahal snap Humphries and Gold
stein's 19-match win streak with
an 8-5 victory.
Humphries also lost his No. 2
singles match to the gritty Casey
Louie, 7-5, 7-5. Humphries will
need to serve and volley better

than he did in that loss in order to
beat the speedy Louie this time
around.
Salzenstein breezed past Hill in
their last encounter, 6-4, 6-0. But
the Australian sophomore has
since improved his game, scoring a
2-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over the
nations top-ranked player, SargLs
Sargsian of Arizona State.
Sargsian had beaten Salzenstein
the day prior to that match, 6-3, 7-
6 (7-4).
Add the fact that Becker will be
playing with a sprained elbow, and
you have all the makings of an
upset. Don't think this fact is lost
upon Stanford head coach Dick
Gould.
"Over there, they are going to be
very good," Gould said. "We're
going to have to play well to win.
We will have to focus on what we
are doing and not let extraneous
things distract us."
One important factor would
seem to favor the Cardinal howev
er: Stanford teams are 4-1 this year
when playing in Harmon Arena.
