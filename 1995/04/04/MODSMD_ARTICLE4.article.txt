# Turning tuitions into scholarships
## New study shows 18% of University tuition supports financial aid funds 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
A new study shows that Stan
ford spends approximately 18 per
cent of tuition money on scholar
ships for needy undergraduate
students, but admissions officials
say the study's comparisons ig
nore the full picture of University
funding.
The study, by the Consortium
on Financing Higher Education,
concluded that Stanford directs
18.4 percent of income from un
dergraduate tuition and fees to
need-based scholarships, placing
Stanford slightly under the aver
age of 19.7 percent for the 31 pri

vate universities analyzed by the
consortium.
Mount Holyoke College tops
the list at 43.7 percent, while
Princeton University appears at
the bottom, spending only 1 per
cent of tuition on grants.
Stanford is under the average
percentage, which reflects that
"we have fewer students in finan
cial aid, perhaps, than other insti
tutions," Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions James Montoya said.
"Those students who are on finan
cial aid at the University are qual
ifying for perhaps fewer dollars."
But the method of analysis
used makes a precise determina
tion impossible, he said.
The report gives a false picture
of how tuition money — which at
Stanford will approach $20,000
per student next year — is dis
tributed in the University budget,
Montoya said.
The survey "left people with
the false impression that in fact a
significant percentage of tuition
increases are going to fund finan
cial aid," Montoya said. "What
this is suggesting is that tuition is
covering the cost of financial
aid. . .. Tuition itself is not."
Montoya said he believes the
percentages in the survey resulted
from a comparison of tuition and
financial aid statistics, two num
bers which Montoya said don't
give a broad enough picture.
"This article simply takes two
numbers and compares them and

that there are only two sources of
fundbig: endowments restricted
to financial aid and tuition," he
said.
Rebecca Dixon, associate
provost of university enrollment
at Northwestern University,
agreed that the report left out part
of the picture.
The percentages reported by
the consortium reflect a formula
created by the universities for dis
tributing income from tuition,
endowments and gifts, she said.
That Northwestern spends only
15.4 percent of tuition money for
financial aid, she said, "has been
our choice."
When financial aid packages
are being prepared, the Financial
Aids Office is given a lump sum,
Montoya said, adding that he

can't determine the exact amount
that comes from tuition.
But overall tuition and fees
provide only 17.6 percent of Stan
ford's budget, he said. Gifts
account for 20.6 percent of Uni
versity funding, and they also con
tribute to the scholarships, he
said.
Because tuition itself covers
only 50 percent of the cost of a
Stanford education, no student is
forced to pay the full price, Mon
toya added.
The consortium reported that
the percentage of tuition used for
scholarships and grants is grow
ing.
In 1975, an average of 9.1 per
cent of tuition was designated for
scholarships. By 1985, the per
centage had increased to 12.8 per
cent, and this year it reached 19.7
percent, the report said.
Joe Allen, vice provost for
enrollment and dean of admis
sions and financial aid for the
University of Southern Califor
nia, said USC is working to curb
that trend by increasing the
amount of aid that comes from an
endowment rather than tuition.
Currently, 23 percent of tuition
at the private Los Angeles univer
sity is used to fund scholarships.
The USC Board of Trustees
recently voted to "try to raise
money to endow scholarships ...
so as great a percentage as possi
ble is not from tuition," Allen said.
"That's the direction we're mov
• _ n
ing.
The determination of figures
wasn't the only distortion in the
March New York Times article
that reported the survey, Montoya
added.
The coverage also "suggested
that what the University is choos
ing in having need-blind admis
sion is diversity," he said. "What
we are choosing... is excellence."
