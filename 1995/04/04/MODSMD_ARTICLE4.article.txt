A new study shows that Stan
ford spends approximately 18 per
cent of tuition money on scholar
ships for needy undergraduate
students, but admissions officials
say the study's comparisons ig
nore the full picture of University
funding.
The study, by the Consortium
on Financing Higher Education,
concluded that Stanford directs
18.4 percent of income from un
dergraduate tuition and fees to
need-based scholarships, placing
Stanford slightly under the aver
age of 19.7 percent for the 31 pri

vate universities analyzed by the
consortium.
Mount Holyoke College tops
the list at 43.7 percent, while
Princeton University appears at
the bottom, spending only 1 per
cent of tuition on grants.
Stanford is under the average
percentage, which reflects that
"we have fewer students in finan
cial aid, perhaps, than other insti
tutions," Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions James Montoya said.
"Those students who are on finan
cial aid at the University are qual
ifying for perhaps fewer dollars."
