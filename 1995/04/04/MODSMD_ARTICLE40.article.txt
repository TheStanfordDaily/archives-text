In a spring break crammed with national cham
pionship contests, the only event hosted by Stan
ford came in the friendly confines of deGuerre
Pool. At the U.S. collegiate synchronized swim
ming championships, the hometown Cardinal
returned to second place after a one-year absence.
For the 11th consecutive year, Ohio State dom
inated the competition, qualifying 16 of its 23
swimmers for final events. As a result, the Buck
eyes' 95 point score was a full 20.5 above the Car
dinal; Richmond came in third with 58.5.
"Everything went pretty much as planned,"
said head coach Vickey Weir. "We'd hoped we
could have done better, but we're very happy with
second in the nation."
Stanford placed especially well in the larger
events, splitting two Ohio State squads in both the
trio and team events. With their huge contingent,
the Buckeyes were able to place two tandems to
Stanford's one in the lucrative team event.
The Stanford trio of juniors Bridget Finn and
Julie Davies and sophomore Amy Markezich took
second as the Buckeyes placed first and third. The
Cardinal's other threesome, featuring Stanford's
lone senior Jennifer Curtis, came in fifth.

"We were very hopeful that we could split
them," Weir said. "Their two teams are very close
caliber, but we were really counting on doing that.
We're thrilled to beat an Ohio State team."
Before the competition, Weir had cited the
duets as a key to the Cardinal's success. Davies
and junior Jen Graves responded to the challenge,
finishing a strong third overall behind two Buck
eye duos.
"Julie and Jen did an outstanding job of per
forming, better than expected," Weir said. "They
beat some girls that had beat them at regionals
[when they placed third]."
Finn also excelled in the solo category, placing
third behind two West Coast swimmers as Ohio
State neglected to enter, opting instead to qualify
two teams.
After two days of competition, Michigan State
the lead as only the A and B figures events had
been completed. Stanford's two All-Americans
Finn and Davies earned spots on the leader board
with fourth and llth-place showings respectively.
Freshman Courtney Harrison turned in per
haps the biggest surprise of the weekend by notch
ing fourth in B figures.
"We were really really pleased with Bridget and
Courtney's performance, given the caliber of com
petition," Weir said.
