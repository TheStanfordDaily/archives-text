# Entire fraternity will face sanctions for break-in
## 
### Gabriel a Teodorescu Contributing writer 
The University will judge the March 25
Stanford Art Museum break-in, allegedly
committed by five Beta Theta Pi members,
as a fraternity action.
The decision comes as a result of the "col
lective responsibility" policy which governs
fraternities.
Seniors Matthew Bengard and Jacob Ku
ramoto, sophomores Timothy Kutzkey and
Alejandro Quezeda and 1994 Stanford grad-

uate Jos6 Farias, also a Beta member, were
arrested for burglary in connection with the
break-in at the museum.
"Clearly this involved the Betas and it
entails a conduct process related to the fra
ternity," Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe said.
Fraternities and sororities on campus
are governed by a collective responsibility
policy. Because they are able to choose their
members, the University requires more of
these organizations than other student
groups, Howe said.

As with all cases, Howe and the Greek Ju
dicial Board, which consists of fraternity
and sorority members, will review the viola
tions. They will then make a recommenda
tion regarding University sanctions to Act
ing Dean of Students Jim Larimore.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole has
said that the University's investigation will
not begin until Stanford Police have filed
their report with the District Attorney's Of
fice. She said she expects the University will
approach the incident as a possible violation
of the Fundamental Standard.

"There could be sanctions against the
fraternity, including loss of their house and
loss of recognition," Howe said. "This is po
tentially a serious offense."
However, Beta President Mark Gaon em
phasized that the incident is in no way fra
ternity related.
"Most of the Beta members just returned
from spring break today, and the incident
came as a shock to all of us," he said. "Just a
few members who were left over break made
this foolish decision. . . . The
house had nothing to do with the
incident."
Jim Gombas, outgoing Beta
secretary, said he disagrees with
the policy of collective responsi
bility. "Personally, I can't
understand why the collective
responsibility policy is applied
only to fraternities," Gombas
said. "Why not take it to dorms
or drawmates?"
"The two guys who were
caught in the President's Office
lon March 29] were both physics
mqjors, but the Physics Depart
ment is not responsible for their
actions," he added.
Gombas said he feels that
individual responsibility is the
key in looking at violations.
"The idea of collective respon
sibility is a scapegoat idea," he
said. "If they apply individual
responsibility to the Honor
Code, why not apply it to every
one, including fraternity mem
bers?"
Intrafraternity Council Presi
dent Trey Stolz said in most
cases the application of collective
responsibility is generally fair.
"It's the rule and fraternities

know that it has to be followed,"
he said.
Marshall Brickeen, outgoing
Kappa Alpha president, said the
policy of collective responsibility
should be accepted.
"The policy is a double stan
dard, but it is also something
you have to accept for the privi
lege of living in your own
house," he said.
Rob Hatta, one of the social
chairs of the Theta Delta Chi
fraternity, sees the policy in two
ways.
"I think that collective
responsibility is very important
in principle, but the University
takes it too far," he said. "When
two or three guys do something,
it's not really fair to consider it
a house action because the
other guys couldn't have
known."
In this incident, membership
in the Beta house brought the
perpetrators together, said Fra
ternal Affairs Adviser Heather
Dunn.
"If we can relat" an incident
to a fraternity, then we 1 >ok at it
as collective responsibility," she
said. "Because fraternities are
the only groups which have the
privilege of choosing their own
members, (they) also have the
responsibility to govern the
behavior of their members."
