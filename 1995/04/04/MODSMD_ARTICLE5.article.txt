The University will judge the March 25
Stanford Art Museum break-in, allegedly
committed by five Beta Theta Pi members,

The decision comes as a result of the "col

fraternities.
Seniors Matthew Bengard and Jacob Ku

Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole has
said that the University's investigation will
not begin until Stanford Police have filed
their report with the District Attorney's Of

approach the incident as a possible violation
of the Fundamental Standard.

"There could be sanctions against the
fraternity, including loss of their house and

However, Beta President Mark Gaon em

ternity related.
"Most of the Beta members just returned
from spring break today, and the incident
came as a shock to all of us," he said. "Just a
