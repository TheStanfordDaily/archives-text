# Scholar decries UN, Yugoslav violence
## 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
Zvonimir Separovic, a former
minister of foreign affairs for
Croatia, was in Sarajevo on the
day that nearly 90 Bosnians were
massacred in the city's main mar
ketplace.
After serving as Croatia's first
ambassador to the United Na
tions in 1992, Separovic had no
qualms about criticizing the orga
nization in a speech that he gave
last night at the Medical School.
"I saw the U.N. soldiers with
the blue helmets and the white
uniforms washing blood from the
marketplace," Separovic said of
the incident.

"Typical," he added, raising his
eyeDrows reflectively before set
tling back into his slow-paced
English. "Instead of stopping it
they are washing away the
traces."
Separovic, however, is not pre
pared to let such war crimes go
unnoticed. As a founding member
and former president of the World
Society of Victimology, Separovic
said that he is firmly committed to
documenting the atrocities that
are occurring in the former Yu
goslavia and exposing the world to
the reality of what has happened.
Separovic's speech was spon
sored by Students Against Geno-
cide, a campus organization dedi
cated to raising awareness about
the plight of those targeted for
ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. Of
the approximately 80 people who
attended the speech, most were
either Bosnian or Croatian.
Victimology, or the study of
victims and genocide, was the
primary focus of the event.
According to Separovic, the sci
ence itself was developed in

response to the horrors of World
War 11.
Victimology attempts to iden
tify how and why a particular
group is targeted for abuse. More
importantly, victimology was
created to prevent possible sce
narios of victimization and to
provide shelter and protection to
the victims of ethnic cleansing,
Separovic said.
Citing Croatia as a specific
example, Separovic identified
many Croats as targets of Ser
bian victimization. According to
Separovic, 300,000 people have
been killed, 3 million people have

been displaced and 30,000 people
have been sexually abused as a
result of the conflict in the for
mer Yugoslavia.
While Separovic admits that
there are victims on all sides of
the conflict, he maintains that
the Serbs are the primary aggres
sors.
"This is not a civil war. This is
not a religious war," Separovic
said. "There is something new in
this terrible war. This is a war
where ethnic cleansing and mass
rape has been used systematical
ly to gain territory."
When Separovic was asked

what the Croatian government
should do to counteract the Ser
bian forces, a few raucous mem
bers of the audience interrupted
the question, crying "kill
them."
Separovic, however, offered a
different solution. He said he
believes that a just peace must be
found and that this justice can
not be achieved if the Croatian
and Bosnian victims are excluded
from peace negotiations. He also
recommended lifting the U.S.
arms embargo so that the Bosni
ans could have a chance to pro
tect themselves.
