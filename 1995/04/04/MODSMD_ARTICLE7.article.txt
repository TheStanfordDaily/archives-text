# Spring break — out on the streets
## Students spend week learning about Bay Area homelessness 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
For many students San Francisco means danc
ing, dining and a night on the town. Last week, how
ever, the City took on a different character for the 11
students, including this reporter, who participated
in the Homelessness in the Bay Area Alternative
Spring Break Project.
Instead of touring North Beach and Chinatown,
we walked the streets of the Tenderloin to observe
the problems of the homeless first hand.
"Homelessness is a very immediate problem,"
said freshman Katie Monahan. "Most Americans do
not live very far above the poverty line, so it is easy
for people to end up on the street."
During the week, we met with homeless advo
cates, non-profit organizations and other experts
who provided us with insight into the problem. Not
only did we work to educate ourselves, we also strove
to give back to the community by serving free meals
and helping Habitat for Humanity lay two founda
tions at a low-income housing project.
"I feel very fortunate that I was able to look at
homelessness from all levels," said freshman Cindy
Urquidez. "It is amazing that there are so many peo
ple concerned with the issue."
While there are 5,000 to 7,000 homeless people
living on the streets of San Francisco, Empty the
Shelters and other organizations estimate that
there are 22,000 "hidden homeless" people in the
city at any given time. The hidden homeless are a di-

verse group of people who are
always on the move. They stay with
friends when they can and iive in
cars and hotels when they can't.
In response to the growing
numbers of homeless people living
in San Francisco, the city has been
developing a five-year plan to com
bat homelessness. On March 29,
we trekked to San Francisco City
Hall to meet with Liz Reznor, head
of the mayor's Commission on
Homelessness.
Reznor highlighted two points
that the commission agreed were
essential to understanding home
lessness. First she pointed out that
short-term shelters are really a
short-term solution. Second, she
identified homelessness as part of
a continuum of poverty rather
than an isolated affliction.
Co-group leader A 1 Chi had a
similar understanding. "Homeless
ness really isn't a problem," he
said, and then paused, "It is really a
symptom of a lot of other problems,
whether it is child abuse, unem
ployment or mental disability."
After a year and a half of plan
ning, the commission is prepared
to submit its plan, formally called
the Continuum of Care, to the city
Board of Supervisors for approval.
San Francisco currently spends
$79 million on homelessness and is
applying for more money through
the U.S. Housing and Urban
Development Department.
Although Reznor is confident
that the plan will be adopted by
the Board of Supervisors, many
homeless advocates doubt that the
plan will be much more than a
paper push.
Paul Boden, director of the
Coalition for Homelessness, is hes
itant about a plan drafted by peo
ple who are far removed from the
problems on the streets. Following
our meeting with Reznor, we hud
dled into Boden's smoky den to
quiz him about his involvement

with the issue.
Boden — once homeless him
self — wears long hair, a feather
earring and makes around
$15,000 a year. He refuses to go to
college, stating that higher educa
tion is an "expensive band-aid"
that doesn't solve social problems.
He also said that he does not
believe that the Continuum of
Care plan will do much. Yet he
emphasized that it was important
to attack homelessness on many
different levels.
The Coalition on Homelessness
takes a grass-roots approach to
attacking the problem. "We are
always in the background trying to
create something out of the dismal
situation that exists," Boden said.
Some were pessimistic after
spending a week inundated by the
homeless problem. "This issue is
so overwhelmingly real and urgent
and vivid," freshman Valerie
Hsieh said. "I would expect us, a
group of students, to come up with
solutions and want to change
things. But it seems to me that we
didn't see a solution."
For many, the experience and
education gained was enough to
justify the trip.
"It was an incredibly challeng
ing week, but a tremendously
rewarding week," said freshman
Tiffany Griego.
Co-group leader Price Lawhon
was particularly pleased with the
project. "I was really looking for
ward to this week and it's turned
out better than I expected," he
said.
Most of us plan to continue
working to eliminate homeless
ness and hope to share the knowl
edge that we gained with the Stan
ford community. Sophomore
Steve Chinnavaso said he hopes
that he can maintain his current
enthusiasm.
"I want this to extend beyond a
simple week thing," he said. "So
often you do things and just let
them go, but I don't want to do
that this time because this experi
ence has been so enlightening and
so rich and warm."
