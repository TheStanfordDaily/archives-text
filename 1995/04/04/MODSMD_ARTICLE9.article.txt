# Getting their STV
## Rooms will soon come cable-ready 
### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
Come next fall, many Stanford
students will finally get their STV.
Future residents in most of the
major undergraduate dorms —
Stern, Wilbur, Roble, Kimball,
Toyon, Branner, Manzanita, La
gunita and Florence Moore Halls
— should have access to cable tele
vision by fall quarter, said Mau
reen Trimm, assistant director of
Communication Services.
In addition, the number of
units in Escondido Village with ac
cess to cable will be increased sub
stantially by fall quarter, Trimm
said. The expansion was warrant
ed by high subscription rates in
graduate residences, she added.
However, STV will not reach all
student housing on campus be
cause of a lack of funds. Gover
nor's Corner, the Suites and indi
vidual houses on campus as well as
numerous graduate residences
will continue to lack cable access
next year.
According to Trimm, about half
of the Row already has the neces
sary wiring, but "we have to do
quite a bit of equipment installa
tion." STV will be offered in parts
of the Row starting in the 1995-96
school year.
For undergraduates, the future
of Stanford TV — the University's
experimental cable service — was
decided after a survey of Lagunita
students in late February showed
sufficient demand.
The survey's results — released
in mid-March — showed that 52
percent of the undergraduate re
spondents would subscribe to
STV, if possible.
This percentage of favorable re
sponses was more than enough to
convince Communication Services
to expand STV access for under
graduates, Trimm said. A 30 per
cent subscription rate is "the goal
for graduate and undergraduate
subscription rates combined," she
said.
STV costs $20 a month for the
basic rate. Premium channels —
HBO, Showtime, Sports Channel
and the Movie Channel — cost
$9.50 for one, $17.00 for two,
$22.50 for three and $28 for all
four.
STV's popularity among
undergraduates was unclear after
this fall's experimental installa
tion in Flo Mo, Trimm said. Only
15 percent of Flo Mo residents
currently subscribe to the cable
service.
Lagunita residents were sur
veyed in February to see if this
percentage was representative of
the undergraduate community as

a whole. "We needed another data
point before making our deci
sion," Trimm said.
Trimm attributed the lack of
enthusiasm in Flo Mo to the fact
that it has a lot of freshmen. "Not
as many freshmen tend to have
TV sets as upperclassmen," she
said.
However, Cardenal resident
Robert Swierk, a junior, said,
"You really only need one or two
TVs with cable per floor and then
everyone can come in and watch.
You'll never get everyone in the
dorm to subscribe."
Satisfaction among those Flo
Mo residents who did subscribe to
STV this year appears to be high.
Freshman Kim Giffin said she
is pleased with the upcoming

expansion of STV because she has
enjoyed her subscription. "My
roommate watches cable every
day," Giffin said. "It's really easy
to watch tons of TV, so I think
everybody will want to have
cable."
She warned, however, that it is
easy to get sucked into watching
hours of cable TV in one sitting.
"Once more students get it they
might realize that it's a trap. I
trap myself into it," she said.
STV is also being extended to
more graduate residences due to
the positive response from resi
dents of McFarland and Escondi
do buildings 88 and 116.
Of the 300 Escondido units
with STV access this year, 45 per
cent currently subscribe to the

service. Consequently, STV is
being installed in 270 more apart
ments in Escondido this week.
More STV installations will occur
in Escondido each week until
September, Trimm said.
A survey of graduate students
last spring showed that 68 per
cent of respondents would sub
scribe to STV, if possible. Gradu
ate student residences do not
have lounges with TVs, like
undergraduate dorms, so more
graduate students have TVs than
undergraduates, Trimm said.
However, dorms cannot sub
scribe to STV for their lounge
televisions. The University's
arrangement with the providers
prevents subscriptions for "public
rooms," Trimm said.
