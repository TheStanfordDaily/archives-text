# Getting their STV
## Rooms will soon come cable-ready 
### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
Come next fall, many Stanford
students will finally get their STV.
Future residents in most of the
major undergraduate dorms —
Stern, Wilbur, Roble, Kimball,
Toyon, Branner, Manzanita, La
gunita and Florence Moore Halls
— should have access to cable tele
vision by fall quarter, said Mau
reen Trimm, assistant director of
Communication Services.
In addition, the number of
units in Escondido Village with ac
cess to cable will be increased sub
stantially by fall quarter, Trimm
said. The expansion was warrant
ed by high subscription rates in
graduate residences, she added.
However, STV will not reach all
student housing on campus be
cause of a lack of funds. Gover
nor's Corner, the Suites and indi
vidual houses on campus as well as
numerous graduate residences
will continue to lack cable access
next year.
According to Trimm, about half
of the Row already has the neces
sary wiring, but "we have to do
quite a bit of equipment installa
tion." STV will be offered in parts
of the Row starting in the 1995-96
school year.
For undergraduates, the future
of Stanford TV — the University's
experimental cable service — was
decided after a survey of Lagunita
students in late February showed
sufficient demand.
The survey's results — released
in mid-March — showed that 52
percent of the undergraduate re
spondents would subscribe to
STV, if possible.
This percentage of favorable re
sponses was more than enough to
convince Communication Services
to expand STV access for under
graduates, Trimm said. A 30 per
cent subscription rate is "the goal
for graduate and undergraduate
subscription rates combined," she
said.
STV costs $20 a month for the
basic rate. Premium channels —
