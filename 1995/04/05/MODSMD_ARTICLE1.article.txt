The Santa Clara County Dis
trict Attorney's Office has decided
to level misdemeanor charges of
trespassing against junior Jos§
Alcorta and senior Clark Bailey in
connection with the March 29
break-in at the University presi
dent's office.
The police had originally ar
rested the two students on
charges of resisting arrest, bur
glary and possession of burglary
tools. However, the police report
indicated that each was only car
rying a flashlight. Alcorta and
Bailey could not be reached for
comment yesterday.
The report also stated that the
two suspects entered the attic
above the president's office via
Building 60 — the Jewish Stud
ies, Public Policy Program, Sym
bolic Systems and Urban Studies
building. The building is located
across the Inner Quad from the
President's office.
According to the report, the
suspects told police they received
the key to the building from Jon
Lindsay, a senior majoring in
Symbolic Systems. Lindsay could
not be reached for comment yes
terday.
Alcorta and Bailey set off an
alarm when they tripped a motion
sensor in the attic at 1:15 a.m.,
the police report said. This sensor
had just been installed by a secu
rity company the day before in re
sponse to previous incidents at
the president's office.
The two suspects crawled
through a ceiling trap door in the
building and then walked into the
adjacent attic catwalk, which con
nects all of the Main Quad build
ings, according to the report. The
two students then tried several
ceiling doors in other buildings
but found them all locked.
One police deputy saw Bailey
wearing dark pants and a dark
turtleneck and going through a
door. The deputy shouted to Bai
ley, "Stop, police!" but he ran
through the doorway, the report
stated.
Alcorta and Bailey were caught
a few moments later by another
