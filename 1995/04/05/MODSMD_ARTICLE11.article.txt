Over 100 killed in Philippines
ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) â€” About 200
Islamic separatists attacked a southern Philip
pine town yesterday, plundering banks and
stores, burning buildings and fighting troops
flown in to defend the town.
At least 100 people died and 30 more were
injured before soldiers drove the rebels into the
forest, military officials said.
President Fidel Ramos declared a state of
emergency in Ipil, a town of 50,000 people on the
island of Mindanao about 480 miles south of
Manila and put all troops on Mindanao on alert.
The government said the heavily armed men
were members of Abu Sayyaf, a Muslim group
fighting for a religious state in the southern
Philippines. The group has been linked to a plot to
kill Pope John Paul II and blow up American air
liners over the Pacific.

Police said they found a banner in Ipil marking
Abu Sayyafs third anniversary. The group sur
faced publicly in 1993.
The gunmen, who arrived on boats, trucks and
a bus, waited for a signal to raid four of the town's
seven banks simultaneously at midday, according
to radio reports and the military.
They also ransacked at least one department
store and set many buildings on fire to confuse
police and soldiers, said military spokesman Maj.
Fredesvindo Covarrubias.
Late afternoon radio reports said thick smoke
filled the town, and one witness who arrived in
Zamboanga by bus called Ipil "a burning inferno."
National police chief Recaredo Sarmiento said
in a television interview that police could only
confirm that 23 people had been killed, but the
military in Zamboanga and the interior secretary
said at least 100 had died. Covarrubias said
another 30 were wounded.
