# Would-be assassin convicted

WASHINGTON (AP) - Fran
cisco Martin Duran, a Colorado
upholsterer who raked the White
House with semiautomatic rifle
fire last fall, was convicted yes
terday of attempting to assassi
nate President Clinton.
In returning the guilty ver
dict, a federal court jury rejected
Duran's insanity defense. He had
claimed he was shooting at an
evil "mist" hovering over the
White House but psychiatric
experts disagreed about whether
he was deranged.
Duran, 26, of Colorado
Springs, Colo., faces a maximum
sentence of life in prison on the
attempted assassination convic
tion. U.S. District Judge Charles
Richey set sentencing for June
29.
During the two-week trial,

defense attorneys had argued
that insanity drove Duran to pull
the rifle from under his trench
coat and open fire on the White
House on Oct. 29, 1994, as
dozens of tourists stood nearby.
No one was injured. The
Secret Service said Clinton was
inside the White House's family
quarters at the time, watching a
Saturday afternoon football
game, and was never in danger.
Duran was subdued by two
bystanders.
After deliberating nearly five
hours, jurors rejected the testi
mony of two psychiatrists and a
psychologist who characterized
Duran as a paranoid
schizophrenic who didn't realize
his actions were wrong.
"Clearly Mr. Duran knew
what he was doing was wrong,"

Assistant U.S. Attorney Brenda
J. Johnson told reporters after
the verdict was announced. "He
wrote things down. He planned
this out. He wasn't crazy.... It
was deliberate and premeditat
ed."
In addition to attempted
assassination, Duran was con
victed of nine other charges: one
count of damaging federal prop
erty, four counts of assaulting
the Secret Service officers, one
count of unlawful possession of
the rifle in interstate commerce,
one count of unlawful possession
of a shotgun in interstate com
merce, one count of carrying a
weapon during a crime of vio
lence and one count of carrying a
firearm across state lines with
the intent to murder the presi
dent.
