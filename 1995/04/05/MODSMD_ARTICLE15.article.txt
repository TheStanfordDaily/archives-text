## Editorials Congrats, athletes

WHILE THE REST of us
were sweating through
finals, several dozen Stan
ford men and women were literal
ly sweating to make our school
look good.
From Dead Week through
spring break, the members of
Stanford's women's and men's
swimming and basketball teams
gave up valuable study and party
time to compete in their respective
championship tournaments and
meets.
Not that competing is all sacri
fice. The athletes all presumably
enjoy the competition and get a lot
out of it themselves. Still, we all
owe them a debt of gratitude for
representing Stanford well.
And they did do well. The
women's swimming team edged
out Michigan to win its fourth con
secutive NCAA championship, an
impressive feat by any measure.
None of the other three squads
won a championship, which is, of
course, a bit of a disappointment.

Still, all can be proud of their
accomplishments.
The men's swimmers were
tough competitors, coming in sec
ond only to the top-ranked Michi
gan squau, which performed very
well in the finals.
The women's basketball team
made it to the NCAA Final Four,
where the Cardinal fell to an unde
feated Connecticut team that
advanced to win the finals. Yes,
Stanford students are used to see
ing their team in the Final Four,
but that doesn't dim how impres
sive it is to reach that top level.
Finally, the men's basketball
team went to the tournament and
won its first-round game â€” scor
ing the first NCAA tourney victory
for a Cardinal team since Stanford
won it all in 1942.
So, from everyone at Stanford,
congratulations to all the athletes,
coaches, managers and everyone
else who worked so hard and com
ported themselves so well repre
senting the Farm athletically.
