# Keep admission free
## 
### 
THE DEPARTMENT of Ath
letics recently announced
that it is considering charging
students for admission to men's
and women's basketball games and
women's volleyball matches. Sea
son tickets for men's and women's
basketball would cost $20; the price
for women's volleyball tickets is
still undetermined. Under the plan,
students would also be allowed to
buy tickets for individual events.
The reason given for the possible
change is that, until now, students'
tickets have been paid for by sever
al corporate sponsors whose con
tracts recently expired. Without
sponsors, the Athletics Department
could lose up to $60,000 if it contin
ues to let students in for free.
Charging students to attend
these athletic events is poorly-con
ceived notion. Stanford students
have traditionally been very apa
thetic when it comes to supporting
athletics. Although this trend has

started to change of late, charging
for tickets would keep many casual
— yet important — fans at home.
Having a large number of stu
dents in the stands is an obvious
advantage that can often make the
difference between winning and
losing a tight game. By charging
students, the Athletics Department
would only hurt its teams.
Stanford should therefore try
much harder to get corporate spon
sors to cover the costs of students'
admission to games.
If that doesn't work, the Athlet
ics Department ought to consider
borrowing a page from the book of
the Sixth Man Club (while doing
away with the group altogether):
Stanford itself could charge a nom
inal season-ticket fee to die-hard
fans who want guaranteed seats to
every game while keeping the rest
of the student section open to casu
al fans, who would get in for free.
They could even throw in a T-shirt.
