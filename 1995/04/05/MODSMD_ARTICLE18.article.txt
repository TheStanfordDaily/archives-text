GOLDMAN SACHS, Deloitte and
Touche, Bankers Trust. The list is
endless. Everybody has seen the ads
in The Daily for "informational sessions"
and "on-campus recruiting." Frankly, I
never paid attention to them before my
senior year. The real world didn't apply to
me yet; I still had lots of school ahead of
me.
But suddenly, taking me by complete
surprise, I've come back from spring break
and realized that I'm graduating in less
than three months and I seem to be the
only Stanford student who still has no
clue. This is not good.
Now, I'm a pretty brave person, but I'll
admit that the Career Planning and Place
ment Center scares me. This small, unas
suming building, nestled in the trees
between the Bookstore and the School of
Education, appears to hold the key to a
Stanford senior's future. At this time of
year, there is a constant stream of seniors
walking out of the CPPC wearing navy
blue suits and carrying briefcases, hoping
that the half hour that they spent with a
middle manager from a software company,
an investment bank or a consulting firm
wasn't a complete waste of 800 valuable
bid points.
Which brings up a couple of interesting
issues. I've always wondered, is it an offi
cial rule that a person interviewing with a
company in the CPPC has to wear a navy
blue suit? And what would an unemployed
senior possibly have to carry in the brief

case Mom and Dad gave them for Christ
mas? One resume?
Don't get me wrong — I have the
utmost respect for people who know exact
ly what they want to do with their lives and
what they need to do to accomplish that.
Hey, I'd show up to an interview wearing
my mother's prom dress if I knew it would
get me a job I really wanted. But, as uncer
tain as the consequences may be, I've
decided to bypass the on-campus recruit
ing process.
As you can probably guess, the parental
unit does not approve:
"But honey, aren't all of your friends
doing it? Didn't Kelly just get a free trip to
Chicago for an interview?"
"Um ... well, yeah ma, I guess she did."
"Well, why don't you try it? Just for
fun!"
"Just for fun." The three words my
mother always uses when she's trying to
get me to do something I don't want to do.
I got a permanent for my hair, just for fun
— and I had to wear a hat for two months.
I ate a raw oyster once, just for fun — and
I threw up all over the neighbor's patio.
For some reason, anything I've done just
for fun in my life hasn't been very fun.
So when the fun bit didn't work, I got
"The Talk." You know, when the parents
sit you down on the couch and proceed to
grill you about "your future plans." For
some reason, now that I can drink legally,
I also have to know exactly which high
powered career I want and what path I'm

going to take to get it. Especially since I go
to Stanford. Stanford students are the
most intelligent in the country; thus, they
must know exactly what they want to do
with their lives. Is that true? Do all of you
in the blue suits know exactly what you
want to do with your futures?
All I'm saying is, people take different
routes to reach the goals which they've set
for themselves, or even to figure out what
those goals should be. I admire everyone
who's putting themselves through the cut
throat recruiting process. But don't con
vince yourself that it's the only route open
to you as a graduating senior at Stanford.
Explore the different types of companies
that don't come to Stanford to interview.
Or take some time off and work in a ski
resort or a national park.
Who knows? Maybe you'll find a great
job or meet the love or your life. Take some
time to fmd yourself independent of school
or the corporate ladder and you might be
surprised. If worst comes to worst, you can
always go back to school and escape from
the real world once again. Why don't you
try it? Just for fun.
