Inconsiderate bicyclists make blood pressure rise

AS I WAS hunting down the e-mail
address for The Daily I noticed a let
ter from visitor Julia Hajdu (March
15) who was almost hit three times by
bicyclists and thought my timing most
apropos.
Imagine this: You're driving along
Campus Drive, stop at a busy intersection
and patiently wait your turn. As you push
down the gas pedal, accelerating quickly
lest you miss your chance, you suddenly
find yourself screeching to a halt barely
missing a clueless bicyclist. He was pedal
ing on a biker / pedestrian path and
thought he could just cruise through any
stop signs and pedestrian crosswalks with
out stopping. Does it get your blood boil
ing? Mine too. My husband and I have

lived on campus for four years now and
believe most bicyclists are just as dense
(or belligerent!) as those Bears might be
across the bay.
Avid cyclists ourselves, we find the sit
uation ironically turned on us when we
are riding our tandem (protected by hel
mets of course!). You see, the inconsider
ate bicyclists have trained motorists to
wait as they negligently run stop signs.
Thus, whenever we stop at an intersection
to wait our turn, we are harangued by the
motorists! They give us the finger, honk
or glare at us for the inconvenience we've
caused by accidentally stopping.
Whether on a bicycle or in a car, the
irresponsible cyclists continue to aggra
vate me. I must mention, however, that

there are a few considerate and literate
cyclists out there and we applaud their
efforts. Nevertheless, our united example
seems to go unheeded. Students (graduate
and undergraduate alike), faculty and
Stanford employees continue to abuse
traffic laws and raise many motorists'
blood pressure day in and day out.
To all of those who may be uncon
sciously knuckle-brained, might I bring
this basic concept to your attention:
Bicyclists must obey the same traffic
laws as automobiles. This includes stop
ping at stop signs, moving in the same
direction as traffic, and staying out of
crosswalks as they are for pedestrians
only. If you must cross between those
white lines, dismount and walk your

bike across. Believe it or not, that's the
law. If you question that, cruise down to
your local DMV and get a copy of the
moving vehicles handbook. You'll be
amazed at what is in there for those of
you on bikes!
Will this letter increase the intelli
gence, courtesy and awareness of bicy
clists on campus? Probably not. However,
my mind will now rest at ease as my heart
pounds wildly during our last few weeks
here at Stanford among such intelligent
life forms. Those of you who have read
this might now understand, when you get
glared at, hit or yelled at, why the lady in
question is acting so crazy.
