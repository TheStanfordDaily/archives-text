# Attack on new coach completely unfounded
## 
### 
Normally, I find Prof. Robert Greer
Cohn's numerous letters in The Daily
and Campus Report humorously out
of-step in the best fashion of the cur
mudgeonly old gadfly; however, his
most recent screed stepped over the
bounds of propriety into inflammatory
venom.
I won't discuss his well-known view
of the decline of the humanities other
than to posit that most people on the
right or left cherish the notion of aca
demic freedom. Thus Yale was correct in
returning Bass's donation, although the
university probably should have never
accepted it with such stipulations in the
first place. Demanding ice cream every

day in a dorm is one thing, requiring
veto power over academic hiring some
thing else altogether. Note my point has
nothing to with whether one believes in
a traditional canonical curriculum.
Let me address the one clear outrage
in this piece. Critiquing "the rigid affir
mative action ... at the heart of Stan
ford's current vision," Cohn lays into
the "disastrous choice of a new football
coach." On what grounds does Cohn
make this charge? Yes, Tyrone Willing
ham is an unproven entity as a head
coach, but then Bill Walsh, who won
multiple Super Bowls is considered a
"genius" yet failed to really deliver in
his second tenure on the Farm.
Given Stanford's academic stan
dards, maybe a winning, bowl-bound
football team year in and year out is
unrealistic. However, Cohn clearly sees
the new coach's race as an issue. Of
course, you might say that his ethnici

ty in and of itself explains his lack of
head coaching experience. I have no
idea how successful coach Willingham
will be, although I hope he wins.
The point is, to hurl venomous
abuse at him before he's even had a
chance to field one team — let alone a
series with his own recruits — is not
only ridiculous but also, in this case,
horribly racist. An "authentic intellec
tual" cannot leave such opinions
unchallenged.
