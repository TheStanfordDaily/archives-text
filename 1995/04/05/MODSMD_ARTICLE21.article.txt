# Silence should not be taken for consent
## 
### 
I have followed with interest The
Daily's coverage of the debate over the

new math framework being waged in
Palo Alto. I wish to address one of the
points made in the March 6 letter by
David Louis defending this framework.
Louis states that only five parents
protested the math changes. The rea
son for this is probably more do to feel
ings of despair and hopelessness than
with satisfaction with the change. In
the last year, the Education Program
for Gifted Youth, which offers comput
er-based mathematics courses to
advanced students, has received
numerous phone calls from Palo Alto
parents desperate to find a mathemat
ics curriculum that will adequately
challenge their children. This is one
case where silence should not be mis
taken for consent.
