## Bug explodes myth of Pop Rocks, Coca-Cola No need for fear of fizz

Q:Will eating Pop-Hocks with Coca-Cola
really kill you?
— anonymous
A:This is one of those questions that people
inevitably ask the Science Bug. It must go
all the way back to 7th grade, when the
biggest rumor going around was that Mikey (the
Life Cereal guy) blew up his insides when he ate
Pop Rocks together with a Coca-Cola.
For those of you who missed this little bit of
American culture, Pop Rocks (also known as
Fizz Wizz) are those crystals of candy that start
crackling and popping when you put them in
your mouth — "action candy," as the package
calls it.
So I set to work by calling Carbonated Candy
Ventures, the makers of Pop Rocks. Here I

learned the secret to putting the pop into Pop
Rocks.
The base of the candy is just normal sugar,
artificial flavors and colors — your normal sugar
candy. The trick, however, is that this is all heat
ed up into a gooey sticky mess and then put
under high pressure. Carbon dioxide gas is then
injected into the mixture and the candy is
allowed to cool. As the candy solidifies, these
bubbles of compressed gas are trapped inside.
At this point, the candy is similar to a can of
soda. In soda, the carbon dioxide is held dis
solved in the drink by the pressure inside the
can. In Pop Rocks the carbon dioxide is trapped
inside its candy-coated shell. When you put the
Pop Rocks in your mouth, this sugar starts dis
solving and the carbon dioxide is violently
released, just like opening a Coke can. This tears
apart the little piece of candy and gives you the
tingly sensation in your mouth.
You may be wondering if this has anything to
do with that Snap, Crackle and Pop you hear in
the morning with your Rice Krispies. Not very
much actually, except that they are both are due
to little bits of food being fractured.
When you pour milk on your cereal, each
crisp starts absorbing the milk, which causes it
to expand. However, certain parts of the crisp
will absorb milk faster, causing it to swell
unevenly. This puts stress on the crisp and caus
es it to undergo tiny fractures.
Kelly at CC Ventures assured me that the
amount of carbon dioxide released by a package
of Pop Rocks could never be enough to cause any
internal damage. According to the company, the
amount of carbon dioxide released by one pack
age of Pop Rocks is about the same as one-tenth
of a can of Coke.
However, this assertion didn't rule out the
possibility that there was some as-yet-unknown
reaction between Pop Rocks and Coke that
would result in extraordinary production of gas.
So just to be sure I decided to take the empirical
approach and do a little investigation on my
own.
First, I had to find a few samples of our effer
vescent reagent. Pop Rocks aren't as popular as
they used to be; it took a little searching to find
a store that still carries them. Finally, armed
with 10 dollars worth of Pop Rocks; and several
cans of Coke, I set out to try my experiments.
The first experiment involved determining
exactly how much gas was produced by Pop
Rocks alone, Coca Cola alone and then the two
together. So I held a graduated cylinder under
water and put the substance to be tested in a
flask with rubber tubing coming off the top. This
tube was placed at the bottom of the graduated
cylinder so any gas produced in the reaction
would be trapped in the cylinder, allowing me to
measure the volume of the gas.
First, I mixed one package of Pop Rocks and
an ounce of water, and shook it until the candy
had totally dissolved and stopped fizzing. This
produced approximately 25 milliliters of gas.
Then I put in an ounce of Coca-Cola and shook it
up, which produced roughly 50 milliliters of gas.
(This was hard to measure, since a lot of the gas
escaped into the air as it was being poured.)
The final result, mixing the Coke and Pop
Rocks, was about 65 milliliters of gas — meaning
there was no huge increase from the mixture. (In
fact, the drop was probably because the Coke
started going flat in the minute ors so it took me
to get everything into the flask.)
With these preliminary studies under my belt,
I decided to go for the real thing. I ate the pack
age of Pop Rocks and washed them down with a
can of Coke. Aside from the usual belches, there
were no signs that I had put it all on the line in
the name of science.
So overall, it looks like you'd have to eat a lot
of Pop Rocks to do any damage to yourself. If five
Coke cans would cause you major distention,
then it would take about 50 packets of Pop Rocks
to do the same. That would be $40 at the going
rate in Palo Alto — more than anyone could
spend on sugar and artificial Blue #1.
