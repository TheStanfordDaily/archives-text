# Skewed circadian rhythms in rat fetuses can be traced to moms' nicotine exposure
## New Med School study finds smoking contributes to sudden infant death syndrome 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
Stanford University researchers
now speculate that nicotine usage by
pregnant women could lead to sud
den infant death syndrome (SIDS) by
desynchronizing the fetus' and
mother's biological clocks.
In a study that appeared in the
January issue of Developmental
Brain Research, Thomas Kilduff, a
senior research scientist at the Stan
ford Center for Sleep and Circadian
Neurobiology, said that the study
found a "jet lag" effect that could
contribute to SIDS.
The study was designed to find
real physical variables to validate
that smoking is a risk factor for
SIDS. The research team found that
exposure to nicotine affected a single
gene to reset the biological clock,
causing an effect much like jet lag for
the baby.
However, Kilduff said that there
is no definite correlation indicating
what amount of nicotine will cause
those effects in humans since the
experiment was conducted with labo
ratory rats.
The discovery is not new for
abused substances. According to Kil
duff, cocaine causes the same jet lag
effect, although it does so in a differ
ent way.
In the United States, the propor
tion of women who smoke is estimat
ed to be between 21 and 28 percent,
but second-hand smoke can also have
some effect. Many infants are subject
to the effects of nicotine during fetal
development, Kilduff said.
These effects have been correlated
to SIDS deaths. SIDS, a failure of an
infant's heart and breathing mecha
nisms, usually occurs during sleep in
the first year of an infant. The infant
is most prone to SIDS during the sec
ond through fourth months.

Although there are no definite
causes for SIDS, some scientists have
suggested that it can be triggered by
something as simple as a baby's sleep
posture. However, the strongest cor
relation is if a mother smokes or not,
although no causal link has been
proven.
"[We wanted] to turn nebulously
called risk factors and find definite
causes," Kilduff said.
In order to do this, the study
looked to see if specific external stim
uli like nicotine usage could trigger
changes in the genes of a fetus and
mother.
A stimulus can initiate three kinds
of reactions in the body, Kilduff said.
One type of communication involves
the synapses between cells; a second
involves changes within cells, and a
third involves changes in the gene
expression. In order to find the spe
cific gene related to nicotine stimuli,
the researchers concentrated their
efforts on the third messenger,
changes in the gene expression.
The specific gene that was found
by Kilduff and his team was gene c
fos, which has been shown to be acti
vated by signals that reset the biolog
ical clock, the suprachiasmatic nuclei
(SCN), in adult rats, mice and ham
sters.
Kilduff found that although nico
tine caused several changes in the
genes of the brain of both the fetus
and mother, there was one area
which was discordant. In the SCN,
only the genes of the fetus were
affected by nicotine.
The SCN, a tear-shaped area
located at the base of the brain, gov
erns the biological clock and controls
the circadian rhythm. According to
Kilduff, a slight change in the SCN
can lead to a phase shift that causes a
jet lag effect.
To explore the effect of nicotine,
the researchers injected one group of

They observed the effects of nicotine
on the third messenger during fetal
development and the first few days
after birth.
The findings will help scientists
understand the development of the
biological clock of the fetus, which
also controls other circadian
rhythms such as body temperature
and sleep.
Kilduff added that the experiment

will lead to more work in the same
area.
"Ultimately you can't say this is
why SIDS occurs," he said, adding
that there is a very close communica
tion between the mother and fetus
that should not be tampered with.
Nicotine, by forcing the phase shift,
could cause that tampering.
The findings of Kilduff and his
research team were presented at the
Society for Research on Nicotine and
Tobacco at a March 25 meeting.
