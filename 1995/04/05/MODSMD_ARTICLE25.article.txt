# Recently developed vaccine will put an end to childhood itching and scratching
## Prof helps lead charge against chicken pox

Ahh! The trials and tribulations of childhood.
Remember the itching, the fevers, the extreme dis
comfort that go hand-in-hand with the affliction of
chicken pox? For the 4 million Americans who are
infected with the disease each year, there is now
relief.
Dr. Ann Arvin, professor of pediatrics, microbi
ology and immunology at the School of Medicine
and chief of the Pediatric Infectious Disease Service
at the Children's Hospital, is among a group of
researchers who have developed VariVax, a new
chicken pox vaccine.
Approved by the Food and Drug Administration
on March 17, the vaccine will soon be available at
doctors' offices and clinics throughout the country.
More than two decades of research have gone
into the development of VariVax. In Japan, it is
already used to immunize all children. In the Unit
ed States, it is licensed for both children and adults.
Before VariVax, chicken pox was "the last of the
major childhood viral infections that we did not
have a vaccine for," Arvin said.
"Had it been available when my children were
toddlers," she said in a column in the March 22
issue of Campus Report, "I would have had them
vaccinated."
In order to simplify the immunization process —
which currently includes a recommended 18 shots
by the time a child enters kindergarten — and man
age the cost of delivering the chicken pox vaccine, it
will be given along with the measles, mumps and
rubella vaccine, Arvin added.
When Arvin's research group first began study

ing the chicken pox (varicella) virus in 1981, they
were only the second group in the nation investi
gating ways to prevent it.
The vaccine was originally given to susceptible
adults and children with leukemia, Arvin said.
"Our job was to keep on evaluating" it, she
added.
Of those who are afflicted by the chicken pox
virus, 60 percent are between the ages of 5 and 9.
Each year, "about 9,000 develop serious complica
tions" and 90 die, Arvin said.
"[The vaccine] will prevent the chicken pox,"
Arvin said, but more importantly, it will also "pre
vent the serious complications which, although
very rare, are very unpredictable." It is a "clinically
important" breakthrough, she added.
Parents benefit from the new vaccine as well.
According to officials at the national Centers for
Disease Control, the social costs of chicken pox cur
rently amount to millions of dollars in time parents
take off from work to care for their children and
reduced workplace productivity.
The vaccine has been tested on more than 9,000
children and has been found to be safe and 95 per
cent effective. It will be marketed in the U.S. by
Merck & Co.
While VariVax is aimed primarily at vaccinating
children, Arvin's research group is starting a new
study aimed at immunizing healthy adults who are
susceptible to chicken pox. Adults who have the
virus have been shown to experience high fevers,
respiratory infection, brain swelling, hundreds of
skin lesions and even death.
For the millions who suffer through the chicken
pox each year, there is an end to the itching and
scratching after all.
