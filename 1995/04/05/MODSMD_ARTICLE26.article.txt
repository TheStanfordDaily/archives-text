BERKELEY, Calif. â€” The top-ranked
Stanford men's tennis team (16-0 overall,
5-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference) came up
against its stiffest competition of the sea
son yesterday in Berkeley, but rose to the
occasion with a 4-3 victory over the 27th
ranked Bears (9-3, 2-2 in the Pac-10).
The Cardinal won the doubles point
and then relied on strong performances by
No. 25 freshman Scott Humphries, No. 46
junior Jim Thomas and sophomore Grant
Elliott to clinch the dual-match victory. As
the score indicates, one less victory in any
of those singles matches would have given
Cal the upset.
"That match could have gone the other
way very easily," Stanford head coach Dick
Gould conceded.
The Cardinal clinched the dual-match
victory before play moved indoors to Har
mon Arena for the No. 1 singles and dou
bles matches.
The Cardinal scored first when the No.
3 doubles team of Jeff Salzenstein and
Elliott got a break in the last game of their
match to beat Kian Raiszadeh and Nathan
Jackmon, 8-6; then the 24th-ranked duo of
Thomas and Ricky Becker pulled out 9-8

(7-3) victory over Casey Louie and David
Melmed. Stanford's No. 2 doubles team
saved three match points before dominat
ing the tie-breaker that clinched the dou
bles point.
Cal notched the first singles victory of
the day, a 6-2, 6-4 decision for Canadian
Bobby Mahal over 36th-ranked Paul Gold
stein. It was the Stanford freshman's first
dual-match loss of the season.
From the early stages of the match,
Mahal established his lethal forehand
down the middle of the court. Goldstein,
who was not serving well and had prob
lems moving his usually lightning quick
feet, was never able to get into the match.
"I had a lot of trouble focusing on the
match," Goldstein said. "I was not very
strong mentally."
Thomas continued with his steady play
in singles action, defeating David Melmed
6-4, 6-2 in the No. 4 matchup. The victory
put the Cardinal in the lead, 2-1, as every
other remaining match stretched to three
sets.
Elliott was the next Cardinal off the
court; he defeated Raiszadeh 6-3, 4-6, 6-3
in No. 5 singles. Elliott's dual-match
record remains unblemished aside from a
loss sustained when he retired due to a
shoulder injury in the second set of a
February match.
Needing just one more victory to clinch,
Humphries came through with a 7-5, 2-6,
6-3 win over 12th-ranked Casey Louie in
No. 2 singles. Louie had beaten

Humphries 7-5, 7-5 in a matched
played earlier this year at Stan
ford. This time around, however,
Humphries made sure the story
would change.
"I put a lot of pressure on him
by attacking his forehand side
more and getting in my first
serves," Humphries said.
In the last outdoors singles
match completed, Becker fought
hard but could not overcome the
stubborn ground strokes of Jack
mon, who outlasted the Stanford
junior in the No. 6 singles match,
6-4, 6-7 (7-4), 7-5. Although
Becker was obviously distracted
by the recent hospitalization of
his mother, Barbara, he was still
hard on himself after the match.
"It's discouraging that I still
play this way at the age of 21,"
Becker said. "When I was 17, I
would've considered this a bad
match."
When play moved indoors for
the night matches, the second
ranked duo of Humphries and

Goldstein avenged a defeat from
earlier this season by prevailing
over the ninth-ranked team of
Michael Hill and Mahal, 9-7. The
Cardinal tandem used a late
break of serve to deal the Califor
nia duo its first dual-match loss
of the season.
The No. 1 singles match pit
ted the sixth-ranked Salzenstein
against the 43rd ranked Hill.
Hill was already expected to
make a considerable jump in the
next rankings after beating the
nation's No. 1 player, Sargis
Sargsian last Saturday, but the
jump will be even bigger since he
beat Salzenstein last night, 6-7
(7-5), 6-4, 6-4.
Salzenstein served impeccably
in the first set and appeared to
have Hill on the ropes after
breaking him early in the second
set. But the Stanford captain
was unable to land the knockout
punch, mostly because Hill
began slicing the ball low. This
adjustment forced Salzenstein to
volley balls upwards with
decreased velocity; his once
lethal volleys became sitting
ducks for Hill's shotgun fore
hand.
