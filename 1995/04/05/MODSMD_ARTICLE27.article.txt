Stanford 15 15 15
Pacific 6 7 13

They just keep going and
going and going. In Energizer
Bunny-like fashion, the Stanford
men's volleyball team (16-5 over
all, 12-4 in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) chalked up
its fifth sweep in a row last night
by upending the University of
the Pacific 15-6, 15-7, 15-13.
"This is the best performance
we have had at and against
Pacific in a while," said head
coach Ruben Nieves.
Pacific (3-14, 7-14 in the
MPSF) was coming off its best
weekend of the year after defeat
ing UC-San Diego and upsetting
San Diego State. Opposite hitter
Greg Wakeham was very hot and
garnered 40-plus kills in both
matches. However, Stanford
stopped Wakeham cold and held
him to a .143 hitting average.
Pacific as a team only hit. 165.
The Cardinal's big gun, junior
swing hitter Mike Lambert,
turned up his play versus the
Tigers and led Stanford's domi
nating charge against Pacific.
"Lambert came out really fir
ing," Nieves said. "His attitude
and play set the tone for us for
the entire match. He was playing

with lots of intensity."
Tenacious defense played a pri
mary role in Stanford's victory and
Lambert led the team with 13 digs.
Sophomore setter Stewart Chong
continued his unflinching policing
of the backcourt and came up with
eight digs, including several spec
tacular negations of sure-kills. As a
team, the Cardinal generated an
unusually high 37 digs (consider
ing the match only lasted three
games) against the Tigers' 27.
Stanford completely dominated
games one and two, but despite its
strong defensive showing it fal
tered briefly in game three. The
Cardinal actually fell behind in the
third game 7-9 after Pacific started
serving tougher and blocked Stan
ford several times. The coaching
staff then made a key substitution
by replacing freshman swing hitter
Tad Hoffman with sophomore
swing hitter Aaron Garcia.
"Garcia came off the bench for
Hoffman and really steadied us
out," Nieves said. "He helped us

out a lot."
Nieves pointed out, however,
that Stanford has had its most suc
cessful spell of the season with
Hoffman in as a starter: The Car
dinal's five match winning streak
started with its dismantling of
Pepperdine, a match Hoffman
started. Another key to Stanford's
success starting with that win over
the Waves was senior middle
blocker Brian Garrett. Garrett put
on a strong but balanced show
against Pacific by collecting seven
blocks, five digs and 10 kills for a
.427 hitting percentage.
By far the largest force behind
the rising Cardinal wave has been
Lambert. With speculation about
his national team future already
rampant in volleyball circles, Lam
bert is displaying that he not only
has great physical abilities but also
has the necessary mental focus.
"He is having a good a spell of
volleyball as I can remember him
playing," Nieves said. "The
biggest, most significant, and most
encouraging factor behind our last
five wins has been the play of Lam
bert. As he has played with
increased intensity and steadiness,
the team has too."
