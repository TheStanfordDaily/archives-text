San Jose State 9
Stanford 4

In what has been a roller-coaster
1995 season, the 14th-ranked Stan
ford baseball team has learned to
expect the unexpected.
After tearing through conference
foes Arizona State and Arizona over
spring break, the Cardinal returned

home yesterday to the friendly con
fines of Sunken Diamond — and
dropped a non-conference decision to
lowly San Jose State (14-19-1).
"It's always disappointing to lose,
especially because of the problems
we've had with Tuesday non-confer
ence games," said junior outfielder
Rich Crowe.
Stanford (19-13) fell behind the
Spartans early and never regrouped,
finishing on the short end of a 9-4
score.
San Jose State tagged Cardinal
starter Mario Iglesias for four runs in
the top of the first, a spate highlighted
by second baseman Patrick Walsh's

three-run home run over the left field
wall. After the Spartans' Eric Pitt got
the scoring started with an RBI single,
Walsh quickly put Stanford in a 4-0
hole with his first long ball of the sea
son.
The Cardinal tightened the gap to
5-2 with single runs in the fourth and
fifth before San Jose State put the
game away in their half of the sixth.
The Spartans posted another four
spot in that inning, capitalizing on two
hits and three Stanford errors to open
up a 9-2 win before cruising to a win
that snapped the Cardinal's season-

long five-game winning streak.
"It was really important for us
to play well over vacation and
finally break out," Crowe said.
"Cal was running away with the
conference lead and we were able
to reel them in. Right now,

despite the loss [yesterday],
things look pretty good for us."
Iglesias, who worked just four
innings while allowing five runs
on six hits, picked up the loss for
Stanford to even his record at 2-2.
Right-handed starter Chris
Townsend earned the win for San
Jose State, allowing just two runs
in five innings pitched.
On the positive side for the
Cardinal, Ail-American junior

catcher A.J. Hinch continued his
torrid offensive streak; he fin
ished the day at 2-for-3 with two
RBIs and a run scored.
San Jose State pounded out
ten hits on the afternoon to score
an upset victory over its highly
touted Bay Area neighbor. Left
fielder Travis Peterson led the
charge, going 2-for-5 with two
RBIs, and catcher Geoff Fes
senden added another couple of
hits for the Spartans.
"When we have an important
game in conference we always
seem to play well," Crowe said.
"It's a combination on bad luck
and a lack of focus that gives us
problems outside the conference.
Today we seemed to hit the ball
pretty hard but we still couldn't
get a win."
Stanford hopes to return to its
winning ways when UCLA travels
to Sunken Diamond for a three
game set starting Friday at 2:30
p.m. The Cardinal took two of
three games from the Bruins in a
dramatic conference-opening
series earlier this year and hopes
to continue its recent domination
of the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division.
