San Jose State 9
Stanford 4

In what has been a roller-coaster
1995 season, the 14th-ranked Stan
ford baseball team has learned to
expect the unexpected.
After tearing through conference
foes Arizona State and Arizona over
spring break, the Cardinal returned

home yesterday to the friendly con
fines of Sunken Diamond â€” and
dropped a non-conference decision to
lowly San Jose State (14-19-1).
"It's always disappointing to lose,
especially because of the problems
we've had with Tuesday non-confer
ence games," said junior outfielder
Rich Crowe.
Stanford (19-13) fell behind the
Spartans early and never regrouped,
finishing on the short end of a 9-4
score.
San Jose State tagged Cardinal
starter Mario Iglesias for four runs in
the top of the first, a spate highlighted
by second baseman Patrick Walsh's

three-run home run over the left field
wall. After the Spartans' Eric Pitt got
the scoring started with an RBI single,
Walsh quickly put Stanford in a 4-0
hole with his first long ball of the sea
son.
The Cardinal tightened the gap to
5-2 with single runs in the fourth and
fifth before San Jose State put the
game away in their half of the sixth.
The Spartans posted another four
spot in that inning, capitalizing on two
hits and three Stanford errors to open
up a 9-2 win before cruising to a win
that snapped the Cardinal's season-
