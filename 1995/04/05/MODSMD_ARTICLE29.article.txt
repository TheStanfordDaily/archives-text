# Golfers fare well in Tempe
## 
### John Lawson Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's
golf team spent the tail end of
spring break like many of the
rest of us: trying to better
their tans down south.
The difference between
the members of the nation's
third-ranked golf team and
normal tanning Stanford stu
dents was that the golfers
were teeing it up against the
best collegiate golf has to
offer.
The result of the Cardi
nal's labors was an impres
sive second-place showing in
the Ping / Arizona State Invi
tational at the Karsten Golf
Course in Tempe, Ariz.

The No. 1-ranked and two
time defending national
champion Sun Devils, looking
more and more impressive
with each tournament victo
ry, easily outdistanced the
rest of the 16-team field,
which included the top five
ranked women's teams
according to Golf World mag
azine. Arizona State posted a
three-day winning score of
859 on its own course, some
33 strokes better than the
Cardinal.
Stanford (892), with a
strong last day of play, held
off No. 2 San Jose State
(896), No. 5 UCLA (902) and
No. 7 Texas (912) to earn the
second-place finish.
"I was really pleased with our
performance," said senior Amy

Lawrence. "We haven't had all
that much time to practice
because of all the rain the last few
months, but we were able to put
together three solid rounds, and
that gave us the victory."
Stanford was led by Lawrence,
who shot a 221, good enough for a

fifth-place tie. Sophomore
Andrea Baxter (224) and senior
Jamille Jose (224) earned an
llth-place tie, while sophomore
Mhairi McKay (228) golfed her
way to a tie for 17th. Junior
Vicky Strada (232) rounded out
the scoring for the Cardinal, fin
ishing in a tie for 36th.
"There had been much written
in the San Jose Mercury News
about how San Jose State's
golfers were more likely to place
better than ours," said head
coach Tim Baldwin. "Our girls
took that to heart and played
with all they had. They were able
to wrest second place away from
San Jose State in the last few
holes, something that they
weren't able to do earlier this
year."
The individual title was won
by Arizona State Ail-American
Wendy Ward, who smoked the
field in route to a 205. Her team
mate Kellee Booth (213) played
tremendous golf herself but had
to settle for second.
With three of its golfers plac
ing in the top six (All-American
Heather Bowie tied Lawrence for
fifth), Arizona State's dominance
of the collegiate golfing world was
obvious.
When the Sun Devils took a
seven-stroke lead after Friday's
action, it became clear that, for
all practical purposes, the Cardi
nal would be fighting it out with
the Spartans, Bruins, Longhorns
and others for the second spot.
"Arizona State has a great
team, they're loaded with talent,
and they had an advantage play
ing on their own course," said
Lawrence. "There were just too
many obstacles for us to overcome
to win the tournament. But I still
think they're beatable. We were
very close to them in the fall."
The Cardinal will not have to
deal with the Sun Devils in its
next tournament as it hosts the
California Collegiate the weekend
of April 15 to 16. The 12-team
field includes San Jose State,
UCLA, and USC, who all finished
in the top six in Tempe.
"It's a much smaller tourna
ment," said Baldwin, "but it's
always competitive."
