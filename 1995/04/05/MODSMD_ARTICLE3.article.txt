# Students can get voice, not money
## Rice favors students on Bookstore, dean of students search committees

University Provost Condoleezza
Rice refused last night to promise
University funding for a number of
student activities but did consent to
increased student representation
in administrative affairs.
Under questioning from ASSU
senators and Council of Presidents
members at last night's ASSU Sen
ate meeting, Rice said the adminis
tration will neither subsidize stu
dent athletic tickets nor financially
support a student publication re
viewing classes and faculty.
The expiration of corporate
sponsorship of student tickets at
the end of this athletic year has
forced the Department of Athletics
to reexamine its policy of allowing
students to attend men's basketball
and women's basketball and volley
ball games for free.
"Athletics also faces economic
realities," Rice said. "They have to
balance their budget without com
ing to the University asking for
needed dollars. Athletics can't print
money. They're not the federal gov

ernment. Economic realities are
economic realities."
Rice admitted that the Universi
ty has been under "pretty tight"
economic times. Last year, the Of
fice of Student Affairs cut $1.2 mil
lion from its budget as part of a
three-year plan to cut at least $18

million from the overall University
budget, Rice said.
"We're trying to keep the essen
tial services," she said. "We don't
want to drive tuition costs up."
Despite a 5.5 percent tuition
increase for the 1995-96 academic
year — 2 percent over inflation —
Rice said that regulatory, salary
and other costs increase at a rate
higher than inflation.
"People ask me to [grant funds
for] everything. We're going to have
to make choices," Rice said.

Recent movement in the U.S.
Congress toward curbing financial
aid resources has compounded the
issue, Rice admitted. She said she
would fight in Washington to
defeat this legislation.
However, when asked repeated
ly by Deputy Senate Chair Michael
Choo for student voices on Univer
sity committees, Rice endorsed
student representation on the
selection committee to hire a
replacement for Dean of Students
Michael Jackson, who left Stan
ford for the University of South
ern California.
Rice also supported student rep
resentation on the Stanford Book
store board of directors. "I'd like to

see a student or two sit on the
board... and lam happy to at least
raise this issue with the board of
directors," she said.
She also said she would act in
the "next couple of weeks" on a sen
ate task force report on campus
safety, which recommended more
phones in public areas and around
campus dorms.
"Obviously, since I walk around
the campus — and when I leave the
office late at night — sometimes
I've been concerned about the issue
of phones and lighting," she said. "I
just haven't been able to do my
homework."
Rice also discussed two unclear
relationships between students and
the University: the connections
between the ASSU and the admin
istration and between fraternities
and the University.
But she said she could not
resolve either issue.
"I can't help," she said under
questioning from undergraduate
senator Stephen Russell on
whether the ASSU is a department
of the University. "It shouldn't be
beyond humankind to be able to fig
ure it out. I'll ask legal counsel to
look into it."
On the second issue, Rice said
she will work with Director of Stu
dent Activities Nanci Howe this
summer to clarify the relationship
between the administration and
fraternities and the amount of col
lective responsibility fraternities
have for their members.
In other action, the senate
approved a constitutional amend
ment which, if passed by students
in this month's election, would
open ASSU documents to the pub
lic except those "of proprietary
business information."
