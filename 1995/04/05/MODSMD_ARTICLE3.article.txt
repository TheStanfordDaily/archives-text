# Students can get voice, not money
## Rice favors students on Bookstore, dean of students search committees

Rice refused last night to promise
University funding for a number of
student activities but did consent to
increased student representation
in administrative affairs.
Under questioning from ASSU
senators and Council of Presidents
members at last night's ASSU Sen
ate meeting, Rice said the adminis
tration will neither subsidize stu
dent athletic tickets nor financially
support a student publication re
viewing classes and faculty.
The expiration of corporate
sponsorship of student tickets at
the end of this athletic year has
forced the Department of Athletics
to reexamine its policy of allowing
students to attend men's basketball
and women's basketball and volley
ball games for free.
"Athletics also faces economic
realities," Rice said. "They have to
balance their budget without com
ing to the University asking for
needed dollars. Athletics can't print
money. They're not the federal gov

ernment. Economic realities are
economic realities."
Rice admitted that the Universi
ty has been under "pretty tight"
economic times. Last year, the Of
fice of Student Affairs cut $1.2 mil
lion from its budget as part of a
three-year plan to cut at least $18
