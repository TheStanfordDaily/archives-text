# McClain is champion
## Fencers sixth 
### Jason Weintraub Contributing writer 
Prior to his team's departure for the NCAA national
tournament at Notre Dame over Spring Break, Stanford
men's fencing head coach Zoran Tulum predicted that
freshman sensation Sean McClain would win a national
championship in the foil division. On March 25, McClain
proved him right.
McClain, one of six Stanford fencers competing in the
tournament, bettered 23 other fencers on his way to the
title. Due to the tournament's round-robin format,
McClain faced every other fencer in the competition, win
ning 20 of his 23 bouts. No other fencer won more than
18.
"It was an entirely new format," Tulum said. "You
never know how you're doing because [no one is elimi
nated]. Without team national titles, there's no passion
to the competition. It makes it hard to concentrate on
each individual bout."
Seeded second going into the tournament, McClain
faced a tough early draw. In his first bout, he defeated
sixth-seeded Brian Moroney of St. John's 5-2.
"St. John's has a ton of scholarships," Tulum said.
"They just buy fencers every year and they're a very
strong team."
The Red Storm's Leroy
Thompson, the tournament's
12th seed, proved Tulum's point
in the second match, where he
beat McClain 5-3.
"The format was hard on Sean
at first," Tulum said. "You have
to motivate yourself very quickly,
and he started slowly."
McClain picked up his game
after the loss, posting seven con
secutive victories before falling to
Andy Gear hart, the No. 1 seed
from defending national champi
on Penn State. McClain only lost
one other match the rest of the
way, however, dropping a 5-3 deci
sion to 16th seed Colin Clinton of
Brandeis.
The Stanford freshman

secured the championship in dra
matic fashion, ending the tourna
ment by beating two fencers from
Ivy League powerhouse Yale,
including fourth seed Peter
Devine.
"All of his losses were flukes,"
Tulum bragged. "He was clearly
the most dominant fencer in the
event."
McClain, who is currently on
his way to Paris to compete with
the U.S. Junior National team,
was Stanford's fourth national
champion foilist in the past six
years. Recent graduate Nick
Brevin won three foil crowns dur
ing his Stanford career.
Stanford also received excellent
performances from the women's
squad. Junior epee specialists
Stephanie Wien and Morgan Hoch
finished seventh and 10th, respec
tively. As a result of their perfor
mances, Wien and Hoch, like
McClain, were named to the 1995

Ail-American Team, an honor
bestowed upon the top 12 finish
ers in each event.
"I was very pleased with their
performances," Stanford women's
coach Sherry Posthumous said.
"We should have a very strong
epee team next year." In addition
to Wien and Hoch, "we'll have two
good recruits coming in."
As a team, Stanford posted the
lOth-best performance in the
nation, finishing ahead of such
national powers as Harvard, six
time NCAA champion Wayne
State, Northwestern and Duke.
Although the NCAA no longer
awards team titles, team scores
were kept for bragging rights;
Penn State won the honor for the
second consecutive year, finishing
ahead of St. John's and host Notre
Dame. Rounding out the top 10
were Yale, Princeton, Columbia-
Barnard, Pennsylvania, New York
University, Rutgers and Stanford.
