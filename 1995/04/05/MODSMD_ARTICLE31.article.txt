# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
After the break, Athletes of the Week
has returned. Over the break, this
week's selections took center stage. Both
picks took charge for their respective
teams and helped Cardinal squads to
wrap up outstanding seasons in out
standing fashions. Each athlete was com
peting in their final collegiate event,
making their spectacular performance all
the more worthy of recognition.
Eileen Richetelli, two-time NCAA
Diver of the Year, helped Stanford's top

ranked women's swimming and diving
team to defend its national champion
standing and capture a fourth-straight
NCAA title.
The Cardinal was locked in a fierce
battle with second-ranked Michigan over
the course of the three-day NCAA cham
pionships in Houston and actually
trailed the Wolverines by 21 points with
only two events to go.
Enter Richetelli. The senior from Mil
ford, Conn., nailed three of four dives to
capture the platform diving event and
catapult Stanford into the lead. The self
proclaimed "big-meet performer" came
through in the clutch for the Cardinal.
Shortly thereafter, the 400-meter relay
team entered the nation's fastest time in
the event this year to seal the deal and
clinch a fourth-consecutive national title
for the team.
O O O
Brian Retterer, a senior from Sparks,
Nev., led the second-ranked men's squad
in their own quest for a fourth straight
NCAA Championship in Houston. While
the team did not accomplish that amaz
ing feat, they did place second, well
ahead of the rest of the field. Only top
ranked Michigan finished ahead of the
Cardinal.
Retterer had a large hand in maintain
ing Stanford's national powerhouse sta
tus. As part of the 400 yard medley relay
squad, he helped set a new American
record of 3:07.28 along with freshman *

Sabir Muhammad, senior Kurt Grote
and junior Joe Hudepohl. In the first leg
of that event, the 100-yard backstroke,
Retterer set a U.S. record with a time of
45.5.
He also did very well on his own. In
the 100-yard back individual event, he
bested his own time with a swim of
45.43. And he broke yet another Ameri
can record in the 200-yard back with a
time of 140.06. Both swims garnered
Retterer the title of national champion
in those events.
