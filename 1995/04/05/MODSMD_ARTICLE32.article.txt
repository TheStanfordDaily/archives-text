Everyone is an expert at
something, no matter how
trivial or meaningless or
downright stupid. Whether it's
playing the ukulele or making
chocolate brownies, we've all got
a special gift.

One of the beauties of March
Madness is becoming an expert at
the game of college basketball.
I'm just one of the millions of
viewers who tuned in, lounged
back and watched the action
these past few weeks. But some
how, especially in large groups of
rowdy fans, the status of "viewer"
takes a back seat. We become
authorities.
I watched the Stanford-UMass
game in the lovely confines of my
dorm's TV room, miles away from
New York and certainly eons
away from the talent I found

myself critiquing. But neverthe
less, I coached from the couch,
cussed, cheered and — most
important — tried to sound intel
ligent.
"What are they thinking? You
can't press against a pass
offense!"
"Obviously he'll go left. He
always goes left!"
"There's no way he can make
that shot. He shoulda looked to
the cutter
I'm not alone. Given a small
room, high emotions and even
some petty cash on the line, we
all try to show off what we know.
It's not a competition between us
and the commentators, or even
between us and the coaches. It's a
whole sub-culture of open
mouthed couch potatoes that
evolves in front of the screen, a
subtle yet aggressive forum for
analysis more critical than most
professors would offer.
The competition for expert sta
tus is between us and ourselves.
Who knows the most, who's
played the game, who speaks the
loudest and who holds the most
credibility? Watching some col
lege hoops should settle it. Those
soft couches become marble

pedestals, and we eagerly climb on.
Contrary to popular belief, the
highest expert points do not go to
the loudest viewer. Volume is
important, but so is intelligence.
Anyone can yell and scream and
pound the armrest — but basket
ball is a game of strategy, skill and
finesse. As is the game of being (or,
rather, appearing to be) an expert.
The viewer with the most tech
nical knowledge (and this is easy to
fudge) generally scores the most
points. Mentioning the players'
hometowns, heights and weights is
definitely impressive. Knowing the
O'Bannon brothers' averages, the
names of their parents and their
birthdays might boost the viewer's
status even more. To really take
the cake, though, the potential
expert must have the lingo.
Know words like finger roll,
trey, carom, downtown, backcourt.
Know the difference between a
screen and a pick. Know all the
synonyms for "dunk," "block" and
"rebound." Words like jam, slam,

stuff, house, ribbie, board, bound.
Be dramatic, conclusive, creative,
and above all, never say, "I could
do it better than that!" After all, if
you could, it would be your airball
we'd be analyzing.
Being an expert while viewing
basketball may not be the most
important label to add to one's
identity. But in the context of tele
vision sports — college basketball
most notably — it brings cama
raderie and excitement to the TV
room. Sure, it's a bunch of people
watching the set. But it's also a
room full of pseudo-coaches and
players who wish they were there
but can't be, yelling from the side
lines as though those figures could
hear them through the wires.
It's one more way to have some
fun and be intelligent on this hum
bling campus. And for those of us
who can't even pretend to be
experts, at least it's fun to watch
those that can. It's a show as enter
taining and intense as the one on
the screen.

Thanks to Hanson for the expert
suggestions, even though he's
never heard of a ribbie. (That's
from one expert to another.)
