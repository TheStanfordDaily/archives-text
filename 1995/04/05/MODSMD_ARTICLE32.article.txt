Everyone is an expert at
something, no matter how
trivial or meaningless or
downright stupid. Whether it's
playing the ukulele or making
chocolate brownies, we've all got
a special gift.

One of the beauties of March
Madness is becoming an expert at
the game of college basketball.
I'm just one of the millions of
viewers who tuned in, lounged
back and watched the action
these past few weeks. But some
how, especially in large groups of
rowdy fans, the status of "viewer"
takes a back seat. We become
authorities.
I watched the Stanford-UMass
game in the lovely confines of my
dorm's TV room, miles away from
New York and certainly eons
away from the talent I found

myself critiquing. But neverthe
less, I coached from the couch,
cussed, cheered and — most
important — tried to sound intel
ligent.
"What are they thinking? You
can't press against a pass
offense!"
"Obviously he'll go left. He
always goes left!"
"There's no way he can make
that shot. He shoulda looked to
the cutter
I'm not alone. Given a small
room, high emotions and even
some petty cash on the line, we
all try to show off what we know.
It's not a competition between us
and the commentators, or even
between us and the coaches. It's a
whole sub-culture of open
mouthed couch potatoes that
evolves in front of the screen, a
subtle yet aggressive forum for
analysis more critical than most
professors would offer.
The competition for expert sta
tus is between us and ourselves.
Who knows the most, who's
played the game, who speaks the
loudest and who holds the most
credibility? Watching some col
lege hoops should settle it. Those
soft couches become marble
