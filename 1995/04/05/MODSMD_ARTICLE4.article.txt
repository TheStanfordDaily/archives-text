# Students borrrowing more thanks to new rules
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
The number of education loans
granted to Stanford students continues
to increase as more people become aware
of new government regulations which
make borrowing easier.
For the 1994-95 academic year, 281
unsubsidized loans have already been is
sued to undergraduate students at Stan
ford, 49 more than in 1993-94 and 149
more than in 1992-93, according to As
sistant Director of Financial Aids Nan
McKenna.
Graduate students have already been
awarded 31 unsubsidized loans this
year, compared to 19 in 1993-94 and 13
the year before, McKenna said.
Passed in 1992, the Higher Educa
tion Reauthorization Act made unsubsi
dized federal Stafford loans available to
students in all income brackets.
The more common subsidized loans
are distributed only to students who
meet certain need-based criteria. The

federal government pays the interest on
subsidized loans while the student is in
school.
The number of subsidized Stafford
loans taken out by graduate students
this year has also surpassed the total for
all of the 1993-94 academic year.
McKenna said the Office of Financial
Aids has recorded 504 subsidized loans
this year. The 1994-95 total reached
458, while 383 loans were awarded in
1992-93.
The number of subsidized Stafford
loans taken by undergraduates has not
yet approached the 1993-94 total of
1,942 or the 1992-93 total of 1,820. But
McKenna said 1,755 of the loans have al
ready been distributed and she expects
between 200 and 250 more to go
through.
Unsubsidized loans are "where the
real growth is," McKenna said. "I think
[the unsubsidized program] is becoming
more familiar to students and parents."
The number of unsubsidized Stafford
loans for undergraduate students will

most likely increase by 30 to 50 by the
end of this year, McKenna said.
"Because it's a non-need-based loan,
it means that students who in the past
would not have qualified for the need
based subsidized Stafford loan are now
able to get the unsubsidized loan," she
added.
The number of students at Stanford
pursuing a master's degree has also in
creased, McKenna said, which makes
the increase in loans by graduate stu
dents more dramatic. Master's students
"as a rule tend to rely more heavily on
loans" than doctoral students, she said.
The changes in the federal loan pro
gram that made loans more accessible
have added "another source of loans
while once again holding the available
federal grant money steady or decreas
ing it," McKenna said.
But moves by the federal government
to end its interest subsidy program may
greatly change the borrowing picture,

McKenna said.
"For example, take a typical
Stanford Stafford loan borrower
. . . who has borrowed around
$11,000 from the Stafford program
for four years of undergraduate
study. If the interest subsidy were
taken away, that student would be
another $2,700 in debt by the time
he graduated," she said.
"What we're afraid of is that it's
going to frighten people off from
borrowing at all or even from apply
ing," she added.

Director of Government Rela
tions Larry Horton said Stanford
representatives have spoken with
members of the U.S. House of Rep
resentatives committees on educa
tion and post-secondary education
and testified before Bay Area mem
bers of Congress at a San Francisco
hearing.
"The University is heavily
involved in encouraging the federal
government to maintain its strong
commitment to offering this
nation's students financial aid," said
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
James Montoya. "Our involvement
has never been more important.
"The increasing level of loan
indebtedness is keeping (students!
from choosing private institutions,"

Montoya said. "That concerns me."
Right now, however, "the
unsubsidized program is helpful
for families who are in a reasonably
strong financial situation and can
use that to help them to come up
with a parent contribution,"
McKenna said.
Rather than having subsidies
taken away, students from low- and
middle-income families need even
more help, she said. "That's why a
lot of students tend to question
whether or not they'll be able to
afford college and maybe don't even
apply," she said.
The University is trying to con
vince government officials that
"higher education remains a very
good investment," Montoya said.
