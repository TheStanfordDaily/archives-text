						good seismic upgrade is one you can't see...
## Crews improve weak buildings

On the second floor of Building 20, carpenter Paul
Lanning lies on his belly, squeezed into a pint-sized
crawl space. Above him shines a 110-watt light bulb
"trying to barbecue the hell out of you."
Stanford is in the midst of completing a five-year,
$200 million seismic upgrade project that will affect
over 30 buildings, most of which were damaged in the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
The result will soon be safer buildings, but right
now it is a campus that sometimes resembles a fenced
school yard with more hard hats than Cardinal caps.
The workers have been digging and building since
late July, with plans to finish tentatively scheduled
for fall of 1996. The workday is supposed to end at
3:30 p.m., but Stanford insists upon quiet.
Thus Lanning's workday often extends into the
evening — when classrooms are empty — and the
crew is required to use an electric crane, which pro
duces a low hum instead of a gas engine roar.
Night was the only time the crew could operate the
pneumatic chipping gun last fall to break up dirt and
rocks. Attached to a noisy vacuum truck, the gun
sucked up two-pound rocks as well as the rats living
under the building, Lanning said.
A good seismic upgrade is the one you can't see,
said engineer Raoul Karp, who designed the upgrade
for the century-old Classics Building.
Making the work invisible falls to Fred Sutton, the
project foreman for Building 20.
Plans call for the reinforcement of Building 20's

Building 20 is just one of many structures on campus undergoing
seismic strengthening.
