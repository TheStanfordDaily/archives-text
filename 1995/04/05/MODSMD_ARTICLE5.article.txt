# A 						good seismic upgrade is one you can't see...
## Crews improve weak buildings

On the second floor of Building 20, carpenter Paul
Lanning lies on his belly, squeezed into a pint-sized
crawl space. Above him shines a 110-watt light bulb
"trying to barbecue the hell out of you."
Stanford is in the midst of completing a five-year,
$200 million seismic upgrade project that will affect
over 30 buildings, most of which were damaged in the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
The result will soon be safer buildings, but right
now it is a campus that sometimes resembles a fenced
school yard with more hard hats than Cardinal caps.
The workers have been digging and building since
late July, with plans to finish tentatively scheduled
for fall of 1996. The workday is supposed to end at
3:30 p.m., but Stanford insists upon quiet.
Thus Lanning's workday often extends into the
evening — when classrooms are empty — and the
crew is required to use an electric crane, which pro
duces a low hum instead of a gas engine roar.
Night was the only time the crew could operate the
pneumatic chipping gun last fall to break up dirt and
rocks. Attached to a noisy vacuum truck, the gun
sucked up two-pound rocks as well as the rats living
under the building, Lanning said.
A good seismic upgrade is the one you can't see,
said engineer Raoul Karp, who designed the upgrade
for the century-old Classics Building.

Plans call for the reinforcement of Building 20's

Building 20 is just one of many structures on campus undergoing
seismic strengthening.
existing walls to the depth of the
building's foundation. While engi
neers have labored over chalky
drawings, construction workers
spent weeks this fall digging a
three-foot high crawl space
beneath the building.
"We're putting in new pre-cast
columns and reinforcing the walls
with steel supports and concrete,"
Sutton said, describing the work of
his 20-man crew.
The description sounds simple
enough, Sutton said, but his crew
spent three months this fall scoop
ing out nine inches of the foot
thick sandstone brick to be
replaced by new cement.
Some construction workers
were quick to point out that certain
problems and dangers can arise in
such restoration projects. Open up

the guts of an old building,
Espinoza said, and pipes, beams
and plumbing are not always
where the blueprints indicate.
University expenses can also be
a problem. Losing a load of con
crete costs Stanford $700 and if
work must stop due to danger or
injury, the crew stands around for
$40 an hour.
The plans also specify that
workers cannot peel back the floor
to bring in supplies. So workers
must pass supplies, tools and cop
per pipe through a 2-by-2 inch
opening into the crawl space "kind
of like a submarine hatch," said
head carpenter Ralph Espinoza.
So far Sutton and the project
engineer have had few disagree
ments. "The engineer is pretty
much gospel," Sutton said.
But that isn't true of all con
struction jobs. Bud Richards, an
electrician not associated with this
project, said that engineers are not
always aware of what labor and

materials can cost.
But old buildings can have their
perks. Stuffed away in the walls or
tucked behind plaster, both Lan
ning and carpenter Bob Serio have
found and pocketed old bottles and
coins.
Lanning and Serio were both
working at Sacred Heart Cathedral
in San Jose a year ago when they
found the bones of a 4,000-year-old
Native American woman. The con
struction workers were sent home
for a week of unpaid vacation while
archaeologists sifted through the
dirt.
So far Building 20 has not yield
ed much of interest except for a few
hand-forged nails, Lanning said.
San Francisco is the place to
find relics, according to Serio. "We
found bodies and cannonballs dig
ging around the wharfs," he said.
"But I told everybody not to say
anything about what we were
finding. It just brings work to a
stop."
