# More graduates choosing to continue on in school

The number of Stanford seniors heading
straight to graduate school is growing, ac
cording to a survey done by the Career
Planning and Placement Center. The sur
vey also shows that those seeking employ
ment are successfully finding jobs.
Last summer, the CPPC sent question
naires to all students who had received
bachelor's, master's or doctoral degrees
during the 1993-94 school year. Forty-five
percent of those who received bachelor's
degrees last year said they plan to go
straight to graduate school, a rise of 7 per

cent from the previous year. CPPC Direc
tor Ruth Schneider said that percentage
was "surprising."
Of those heading directly to graduate
school, about one-third were entering mas
ter's programs, 28 percent were entering
medical school, 16 percent were entering
law school, 13 percent were entering doc
toral programs and 1 percent were entering
MBA programs. The low number of MBA
students reflects the recommendation that
students work for a year or two before en
tering business school. The remainder of
those heading directly to graduate
school planned to obtain other
sorts of advanced degrees.
Parental or family pressure
was identified by 19 percent of
respondents as a factor in choos
ing to go to graduate school.
Other factors cited included an
inability to find jobs (5 percent)
and a desire to defer payment of
educational loans (3 percent).
The study also dealt with those
not immediately seeking to con
tinue their education, showing
that 43 percent of students who
received bachelor's degrees last
year planned to work full-time
after graduation, a drop of 12 per
cent since 1990.

Those who did seek employ
ment, Schneider noted, appeared
to be successful in finding jobs. Of
the 59 percent of all respondents
who intended to work full-time
after graduation, four-fifths had
already accepted job offers, most
ly in engineering and business. Of
those who had accepted jobs, 19
percent received their offers
through campus recruitment ser
vices, said Schneider.
"There's a whole cadre of peo
ple for whom the on-campus
recruiting program isn't appropri
ate," she said. "When you look at
who it is useful for, you'll see that
19 percent is pretty good."
Engineering graduates report
ed the highest starting salaries,
ranging from $36,000 for those
receiving bachelor's degrees to
$64,000 for those receiving doc
torates. Humanities and Sciences

graduates reported starting
salaries of $30,000 for bachelor's
recipients and $43,000 for doctor
ates. The highest starting salary
— $110,000 — was reported by an
engineering Ph.D. who joined a
consulting firm after graduation.
Some bachelor's degree recipi
ents planned to head neither
straight to graduate school nor to
full-time employment. Those who
planned to travel, work part
time, hold internships or volun
teer made up 12 percent of the
group.
A comparison with registrar's
office records showed that the 44
percent who responded to the sur
vey had a demographic break
down similar to that of the entire
group. Those working on the sur
vey were "delighted to see that
the sampling was so close,"
Schneider said.
