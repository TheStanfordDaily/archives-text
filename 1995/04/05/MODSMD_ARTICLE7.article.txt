A new volunteer project will give four
Stanford students the opportunity to work
in Haiti with grassroots organizations to
address local community needs.
The "Tet Ansanm" ("Heads Together"
in Creole) community service program will
match a total of 16 student volunteers from
Stanford, UC-Berkeley, UC-Davis and
Santa Clara University with Haitian stu
dents from the university in Port-au-
Prince to work in villages and parishes in
the Haitian countryside this summer.

project this summer, the program may be
expanded to a national program that will
continue to send student volunteers to
Haiti.
