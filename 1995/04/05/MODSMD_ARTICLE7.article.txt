# Putting 'Heads Together'
## Pilot program takes volunteers to Haiti 
### Marie Rosencrantz 
A new volunteer project will give four
Stanford students the opportunity to work
in Haiti with grassroots organizations to
address local community needs.
The "Tet Ansanm" ("Heads Together"
in Creole) community service program will
match a total of 16 student volunteers from
Stanford, UC-Berkeley, UC-Davis and
Santa Clara University with Haitian stu
dents from the university in Port-au-
Prince to work in villages and parishes in
the Haitian countryside this summer.
The social service project is being orga
nized jointly by Christian ministries from

the four Bay Area universities and repre
sentatives from the Christian community
in Haiti. According to the Rev. Herb
Schmidt, Lutheran campus pastor at Stan
ford and coordinator of the Stanford volun
teers, the aim of the program is to promote
understanding and support between Haiti
and the United States.
Depending on the success of the pilot
project this summer, the program may be
expanded to a national program that will
continue to send student volunteers to
Haiti.
The cost of the Tet Ansanm project is
$2,000 per student. Students are
expected to contribute to a part of
this expense. Scholarships will also
be available to assist student vol
unteers.
Schmidt said almost all skills
may be of assistance to different
grassroots organizations, but espe
cially needed are skills related to
legal assistance, computer skills,
engineering, teaching, medical
assistance, agricultural projects,

construction, child care, public
health education, alternative ener
gy, community organizing and
French or Creole language ability.
According to Schmidt, the vol
unteer project organizers hope
that the people who go to Haiti will
all have "social good will" but do
not need to have any specific reli
gious affiliation.
Schmidt visited Haiti early this
spring with a delegation in order to
meet with different Haitian Chris
tian-community leaders and iden
tify community needs that the stu
dent volunteers may work to
address.

During his stay in Haiti,
Schmidt visited different locations
where human rights violations
were committed during the mili
tary regime. Schmidt said he
returned with "tremendous
impressions of a people with
tremendous hope" and observed
an appreciative but cautious atti
tude on behalf of the Haitian pop
ulation toward the presence of
U.S. soldiers in their country.
After their return to the United
States, students will be expected to
work on Haiti-related educational
and political action projects for up
to one year.
