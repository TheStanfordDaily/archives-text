David Letterman joked about it
at the Oscars. Critics were out
raged about it. But "Hoop
Dreams" director Steve James
was more philosophical about his
film's absence from the major
Oscar races.
"Ultimately it wasn't that dis
appointing. We've gotten so much
acclaim and attention — tenfold
what you normally get from a
nomination," said James, speak
ing last night to a packed house in
the Branner Hall lounge.
In a moving speech full of
humor, heart and honesty, James
talked about the moral dilemmas
encountered during the film's
making as well as the rewards of
its release. The film started out
with practically no financing and
took seven years to finish.
"We were the world's luckiest
guys," said James about the mak
ing of his documentaiy, which de
tails the lives of two young basket
ball players over four-and-a-half
years, from inner-city Chicago to
college.
"We thought we had a good
film, but no real clue as to how it
would play with audiences. We
had a lot of strikes against us,"
James said, referring to the lack of
box-office appeal of documen
taries about sports featuring black
people.

Steve James, the director of the critically acclaimed documentary "Hoop Dreams,"
spoke last night at Branner Hall about how the film affected him and the families
who were its subjects.
"Hoop Dreams" the best picture
of 1994, the film failed to garner
either a Best Picture or Best Doc
umentary nomination in last
week's Academy Awards.
But James seemed less con
cerned with awards than with
"the mythology of the American
dream" that his film captures.
"The making of 'Hoop
Dreams' yielded many revela
tions," said James. "Despite my

liberal attitude, I don't think I
truly appreciated how like me —
and I presume, like you — those
two families really are. Every
body wants the same thing: a lit
tle piece of the American Dream.
The more we filmed, the more
the basketball dream came to be a
metaphor for the American
Dream."
James movingly described the
difficulty of filming this real-life
story at times when the film's
subjects found themselves in
extreme poverty. As problems of
unemployment, welfare, drugs

and violence beset the families,
James found himself in a tough
situation, as he had to balance his
work as filmmaker with his situ
ation as a friend of the families.
According to James, during
the making of the film one of the
subjects feared that the movie's
audience would think that they
were "bad people" because they
couldn't afford to pay light bills
and such.
James tried to comfort her,
saying that "people will under
stand your dreams are not any
different than theirs. Maybe

they'll listen and see that you're
not just a welfare mom. You
won't be a sound bite in the
evening news."
"Perhaps the greatest moment
in terms of the release of the film
happened when the film pre
miered in New York," James said
about the documentary's hon
orary screening at the closing
night of the New York Film Fes
tival.
He recounted how that night
the white, "well-to-do" audience
watched in reverent silence as
the story unfolded. After the

screening, a spotlight appeared
over the box where James was
sitting with the families.
"The place just erupted. They
were giving these families a
standing ovation," James said.
"It lasted for ten minutes. Every
body hugged each other. It was
like a hugfest.
"Their hopes and dreams were
what the people were clapping
for, in shock of recognition that
there wasn't much to separate
them. It was a big pay-off,"
James added. "It was a great
moment."
