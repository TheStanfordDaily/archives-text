Iraq denies violations
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Iraq yesterday denied
charges it is still seeking to make biological weapons,
calling them "political fabrications" by Washington
aimed at keeping the U.N. oil embargo in place.
"The U.S administration does not like to see Iraq
comply with Security Council resolutions .. .
because the U.S. wants to continue with the sanc
tions against Iraq," Information Minister Hamed
Yousef Hammadi said in a statement.
President Clinton said Tuesday that Iraq "could
be regaining" a capacity to produce biological
weapons, while Secretary of State Warren Christo
pher said there was "strong evidence" Iraq had such
intentions.
Clinton said his concern was based on the fact
that Iraq had not accounted for imports of suspi
cious technology in its reports to the U.N.

Another O.J. juror out
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The trouble-plagued
O.J. Simpson jury lost a sixth member yesterday,
intensifying fears that a complete panel won't
survive the stresses of the trial long enough to
deliver a verdict.
The ouster of the 38-year-old black woman,
reportedly for failing to disclose her own experi
ence with domestic abuse, left only six alternate
jurors — half of the original number. If the alter
native pool is exhausted and the number of jurors
falls below 12, a mistrial would be declared unless
both sides agreed to continue.
When the jury finally was called into court, the
judge asked his clerk to pick another juror by lot.
Another black woman, a 44-year-old computer
technician with Los Angeles County Superior
Court, took the empty seat.
