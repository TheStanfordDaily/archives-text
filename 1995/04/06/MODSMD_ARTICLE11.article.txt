# US makes a nuclear pledge

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Clinton pledged
yesterday not to launch nuclear attacks against coun
tries that have no nuclear weapons and agree not to
acquire them.
The pledge reaffirmed one taken in 1978 by the
United States, Britain and the Soviet Union and
apparently would bar U.S. nuclear attack on such
countries as Iran and Iraq.
Clinton's statement underscored, however, that
the pledge would not apply if the United States or its
allies were invaded or attacked.
Similar assurances will be offered by the leaders of
Russia, Britain and France, Secretary of State Warren
Christopher told dozens of ambassadors and foreign
diplomats at the State Department.
And he said China would provide similar assur
ances as part of a United Nations resolution.
At the same time, Clinton reaffirmed a U.S. com
mitment to provide immediate assistance to states
without nuclear weapons in the event they were
threatened or attacked by nuclear-armed countries.
This could include medical, scientific and humani

tarian assistance, he said.
The dual pledges are a response to "the legitimate
need" of non-nuclear countries for assurances "that
forgoing the nuclear option does not jeopardize their
security," Christopher said.
The president's move was designed to promote
indefinite extension of the 1968 Nuclear Non-Prolifer
ation Treaty at an international conference that
begins April 17 in New York.
The treaty has kept the number of countries with
nuclear weapons lower than anticipated, reduced the
risk of nuclear conflict and promoted the safe use of
nuclear energy, Christopher said.
"Only indefinite and unconditional extension of the
NPT can preserve this treaty's true strength," he said.
Two years of intensive diplomacy are paying off,
Christopher said. "We believe that a majority of NPT
parties will support indefinite extension."
John Holum, the U.S. arms control director, on
Tuesday likened the importance of making the treaty
permanent to the founding of the United Nations 50
years ago.
