Fraternity shouldn't be
held responsible for the
actions of five members

ON MARCH 25, five mem
bers of the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity allegedly broke
into the Stanford Art Museum.
Accordingly, those students were
arrested and face possible
charges. The University, howev
er, has decided to judge the
entire fraternity for the action,
possibly imposing sanctions as
severe as taking away its house.
This decision was justified by
the University's collective
responsibility policy which
applies to fraternities and soror
ities. This policy, as implied by
its name, places responsibility
for individuals' malfeasances on
all of the members of the Greek
organization to which they
belong. It is explained by the
University with the reasoning
that because fraternities and
sororities are subjectively selec
tive student organizations, they
should be held responsible for
their members' activities.
"Clearly this [incident]
involved the Betas, and it entails
a conduct process related to the
fraternity," said Director of Stu
dent Affairs Nanci Howe.
Well, yes, it did involve Betas,
but that does not mean it
involved the Betas, which would
be an entirely different story.
And what is a conduct process,
anyway? Assuming that Howe is
referring to the crime, that is,
trying to break into a building, it
is only related to the fraternity
by the same previously men
tioned fact that it may have
involved five of the fraternity's
members. Is Howe trying to
imply that breaking and enter
ing is somehow intrinsically fra
ternity-like? One would certain
ly hope not, but her statement
seems to do just that.
So one is left with the fact

that the vast majority of Betas
returned from spring break only
to learn that their housing for
next year may be in jeopardy
partly because of the actions of
five of their less civically-respon
sible fraternity brothers. That is
unfair, and the unincriminated
Betas should be justifiably out
raged for being blamed for
actions which they not only did
not take part in, but also had no
prior knowledge of.
The silver lining behind this
dark cloud should be the re
examination and correction of
what is currently an unjust stan
dard — the University's collec
tive responsibility policy. For one
thing, fraternities are not the
only subjectively selective stu
dent organizations. Singing
groups, publications, athletic
teams and other groups have
their own ways of screening out
prospective members. But none
of these organizations are sub
ject to the rule.
It is true that housed fraterni
ties (but not sororities and
unhoused fraternities) are the
only subjectively selective
housed student organizations,
but even if this fact alone justi
fied treating them differently (it
does not) the policy should not
be applied to unhoused Greek
organizations. But, more impor
tant, the policy does not make
logical sense — individuals
should be held responsible for
their own actions, not the
actions of others.
The only way the University
should be able to prosecute the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity for the
allaged crimes of five of its mem
bers is if it can prove that the
fraternity, as an organization,
was directly involved. This
would be difficult to do, but in
the absence of such proof the
University risks penalizing inno
cent Betas for actions over which
they had no control.
And a fraternity brother will
be forced to become his brother's
keeper.
