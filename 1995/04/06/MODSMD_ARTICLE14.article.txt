Women 9 s basketball article wrongly overemphasized loss

1 WOULD LIKE to comment on the
disappointing article on women's
basketball in Monday's Daily. After
an incredible 30-3 season, I think the
players deserve more than an article
entitled "Ladies Lose." As the article
politely stated, the Stanford women's
team had an enormously successful
year; however, the article immediately
started to praise the University of
Connecticut team that defeated the
Cardinal in the Final Four. The
Huskies are certainly an outstanding
team, but The Daily isn't the UConn
student newspaper. I forced myself to
trudge through two-thirds of the arti
cle, before I could find anything
remotely praiseworthy of Stanford's

team, and even then it seemed to be
just an afterthought.
I think The Daily could take a big
hint from the writer of the men's arti
cle that ran the same day. Unlike the
women's article, the men's piece
opened with an exciting depiction of
the Big Dance that relays the magic
and mystique that accompanies what
is appropriately titled "A Small Bit of
Heaven." The women's team played
four exciting games to reach the Final
Four (some were even on their home
court), but the author apparently
deemed these games completely irrele
vant. The majority of the article read
as a great summary of a bad beating.
Perhaps the article should have

been moie about the magic and the
mystique of the Final Four and what it
takes to get there. After all, 60 other
teams went home before we did (not to
mention the many teams that didn't
even make it to the Big Dance). I'm
sure they would all have much rather
had a chance to play in the Final Four.
When the article finally began to
talk about the earlier games and Stan
ford's outstanding accomplishments,
they are treated in a very brief manner
as if to say, "Oh yeah, this is what
took place before the UConn game."
It's as if the previous games were not
important, like they were just any
other game that the team played.
Even this section of the article con

tains constant reminders of the UConn
game. The last sentence of the article,
which graciously reminds us that the
Cardinal defense did not control
UConn player Kara Wolters, serves as
one last unnecessary slap in the face to
the team, the fans and the readers. As
a devoted fan of women's basketball
(especially Stanford basketball), I am
tremendously disturbed and disap
pointed by an article that appears to be
nothing more than a critique of one of
the top teams in the nation, especially
when I consider the fact that it was
written and printed by the team's own
school newspaper.
