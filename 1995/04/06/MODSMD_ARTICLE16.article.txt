## Dealing with the Whatifs 
### 
Last night, while I lay thinking here,
Some Whatifs crawled inside my ear
And pranced and partied all night long
And sang their same old Whatif song . . .
— Shel Silverstein
THE WHATIFS are back. Just like
Shel says, they're the embodiment
of all the anxieties you can think of.
And isn't it fun to sit around and listen to
them chat! It's a great game during a
final.
I thought I'd gotten rid of them. It was
like remission. But now the little
varmints are chatting. An unmistakable
insidious little whisper of doubt, of
maybe, of why. It's hard to keep the
Whatifs away. They're powerful little
buggers, too.
The Whatifs make alumni head back
to campus, straight to the Career Plan
ning and Planning Center for the mid
career change. "Whatif I'd be happier if I
became a .. Still, the alums feel per
fectly normal, quoting things like "In
this new era of rapid economic change
and flux, an individual may have as many
as seven careers, not just jobs, in a life
time."
It's the gosh-I'm-so-normal theory in
action. Used commonly to explain things
like your third major in three years ("the
normal college student will change
majors five times"), or not knowing what
you're going to do after you've finished
your second coterm ("gee, dad, the aver

age age of entering law students is 26").
And maybe that really is normal, any
way. As long as you're not alone. But
wait — didn't you used to be outstand
ing? Whatif you really are just normal,
gulp, average? Whatif you are alone?
Whatif you're the only one who hasn't
found your road less traveled by?
You're not. Because we're all dealing
with it in one way or another. If you listen
just a little, you can hear everyone's
Whatifs whispering aloud. What am I tak
ing this quarter? Did I choose the right
path? Will this introspection ever end?
Rumor has it that we eventually grow
out of this searching motif. Some of us
sooneip than others. Maybe not. Truth is,
you never outgrow the Whatifs. So you
have to learn to live with them. Calmly.
And, just maybe, that's a good thing.
It all goes by really fast. You're facing
the end of some year, and you're chewing
a hole in your pouting lower lip. Whatif I
don't find something to do this summer?
Whatif I don't find something to do with
my life? Whatif I don't rewind videos?
Whatif I don't ever find out what the
nine-month stretch of a relationship is?
And Whatif you never figure it all out?
Well, so what?
The Whatifs are toying with you.
When you start to think of your entire
future, it gets a little overwhelming, a lit
tle nauseating. For everyone. But think
ing about five years at a time is doable.
Eventually, something happens.

But every now and then those excel
lent plans are snapped by fate. Like your
grandmother dies during a routine
surgery. Or your parents are getting
divorced because your father has a
boyfriend. Unpredictability at its finest.
And even the Whatifs don't warn you
about that kind of stuff.
So Whatif?
I don't know how to answer the What
ifs. Maybe just tell them to shut it. It'll
either work out or it won't. You deal
either way. Then you just make it work.
And maybe you're a better person
because of all the change. Whatif you
are? But the CPPC keeps that alumni
appointment book handy, just in case.
The Whatifs, the doubts, will always
be there. Voices of the past gnawing away
at us. And, somehow, we've all got to
keep on moving. Oh, they'll retreat into
hiding by the second week of the quarter,
when life settles down. After you finally
pick the damn classes and drop a couple
hundred at the Bookstore.
But I have a feeling they'll be back. I
just hope that next time the Whatifs
sneak in, they don't bring the Shoulds
with them.

Julie really doesn't have little Whatifs
living inside her head. They have a spe
cial little fishbowl in her room.
