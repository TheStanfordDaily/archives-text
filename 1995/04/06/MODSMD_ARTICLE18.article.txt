## Bart! Senior center leaves legacy of leadership 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
"Time running down, Stanford and Arizona all
tied up. Stoudamire down the lane. Shot sent back
by Lammersen! Cross on the break. All alone, pulls
up for the three! No good! Lammersen with the
rebound! Lay-in no good! On to overtime...."
The day was Jan. 14. The time was approximate
ly 9:30 p.m. And the place was right underneath the
basket for Stanford's graduating senior center Bart
Lammersen. A chance of a lifetime to win the game,
a contest that Stanford eventually lost to Arizona in
overtime.
That will be a time and place Lammersen won't
soon forget. Even now, nine wins and 12 weeks
removed, the 6-foot-9-inch man still heaves a sigh
of regret when talking about that fateful evening
where basketball immortality was there for the tak
ing — only to clank off the front of the rim.
"The Arizona game at home for me was a per
sonal low point just because we had a ranked team
here in front of everyone," Lammersen said. "And I
had a chance at the end to make a difference in the
outcome of the game, and I couldn't finish it.
"It was just disappointing because it was a
chance that comes along once in a career where you
had a legitimate shot at the end of the game to
decide the outcome. It hurts a little bit because you
didn't complete the play, yet you tried your hardest
to do it. I guess it comes with the territory because
if I had tipped it in I would have been the hero and
everything."
Major publications like the San Francisco Chron
icle would continue to dog the center for weeks to
come never realizing that it was Lammersen who
blocked All-American stud point guard Damon
Stoudamire's shot to prevent the win in regulation
and his hustle that placed him in such an opportune
place for such an inopportune act.
But then again, it's all about opportunity. Lam
mersen is not haunted because he missed the put
*back, but more because he realizes what could have
been.
"I think the Arizona game bothered him quite a
bit," said senior forward Andy Poppink. "It was an
opportunity for him to do something that he could
have held on to for the rest of his life."
Poppink, who had an opportunity the prior sea
son to down UCLA with a game-winning shot,
speaks from personal experience. "He doesn't feel
bad about missing it," Poppink continues. "It
haunts him because of the prospect of it going in.
What if it had gone in?"
If it had, it would have been a just reward for
Lammersen, who has essentially put everything he
has had on the court. Perhaps that's the main state
ment about the Arizona game. Whether it is
rebounds, rejections, lay-ups or even missed put
backs, Lammersen lets it all hang out.
Sportscasters and writers love to talk about
heart, but if you took a look inside Lammersen's
hefty chest you might not find one. In its place
might lie a gigantic beating basketball. Some play
ers have the love for the game, while others simply
live it. Guess which one Lammersen is?
While you may be hard-pressed to compare Lam-

mersen's journey on the hard
wood to a real-life "Hoop
Dreams," basketball nevertheless
has been a driving force in this
Virginia native's life.
"Even though I'm done, I still
love playing the game," Lam
mersen said. "You really can't
stop cold turkey. Basketball has
been my whole life since I was a
kid. The game of basketball has
given me the chance to meet some
great people and see some new
things. I've learned to handle
adversity better.
"Basketball's also kept me
focused. Growing up, I had
friends that weren't really run
ning with the right crowds. They
had tried to get me to hang out
with them, but simply because I
loved playing basketball so much
I didn't. Those guys are definitely
not where they could or should
have been or definitely where I
am now. Basketball's given me
the ability to keep my nose clean

and stay out of trouble."
Even out of practice he can't
seem to get enough of the game.
Off the court, his roommates are
teammates Poppink, David Har
bour and Warren Gravely. His
hobbies are his friends and his
friends are basketball.
"It's going to be tough because
they're such a big part of your
life," Lammersen said. "The guys
on the team, especially in my class
have been the most important
people in my life here. I've learned
a lot from those guys. The entire
team's just really close. The close
ness of all the guys will be
missed."
But don't be mistaken. Lam
mersen has given much more to
the game then simply, as he him
self puts it, "a big white guy who
likes to play and plays hard every
time out." With a career points
per-game average of 3.1, Lam
mersen isn't exactly an offensive
superstar; still, he has thrived in
his role off the bench and has
made the most out of his big-time
minutes (17.4 per game) by
relentless rebounding and
defense.
Throughout the season, the

"Hammer," as he has been aptly
dubbed, has displayed a no-holds
barred attitude in the trenches.
"I just think I use my body
well," Lammersen said. "I've
worked hard to put on some
weight. I'm not as quick as a Mar
cus Camby or Ed O'Bannon, but I
have more size. So I try to use it
and lean on people.
"I basically tell myself that no
one's going to get anything for
free. If you're going to foul some
one you might as well get your
money's worth. If he falls, I'll just
help him up and tell him that I'll
do it again. I'm not going to be
intimidated by anyone. If you go
out there and think that you're
tough, you might actually play
tough. On an everyday basis I'm
not a hard ass or a tough guy, but
on the court I just do what needs
to be done."
The 245-pound body of Lam
mersen will be sorely missed next
season. With his departure, that
leaves the Cardinal with just one
returning player over 6-8, fresh
man Tim Young.
"We're going to miss Bart
quite a bit," Poppink said. "He
provided leadership. Also, he's a

physical big guy, and we'll miss
his size, strength and toughness."
All season long, Lammersen
has been invaluable as a key
reserve off the bench when Young
either becomes winded or gets
into foul trouble.
"He was kind of thrust into a
role on the team," Montgomery
said. "He did a great job of accept
ing that role and saying that's
where I can help and that's what I
can do. He ended up being a real
ly good basketball player. He was
a guy that always knew what he
was doing. What you end up with
is leadership, stability and matu
rity to help a lot of the younger,
emotional guys. When he was
voted captain, it was a perfect
deal."
More than that however, Lam
mersen has been integral in the
tutelage of Young, Stanford's
freshman phenom.
"He's had a tremendous
impact in my development,"
Young said. "When I first started,
I was nervous and unsure. He
brought me along slowly. He was
always patient and helped me get
use to a new program and new
plays," Young said.

Still, the Cardinal's senior cap
tain could easily have perceived
the emergence of Young as a bit
ter pill to swallow with Lam
mersen being the senior and —
without Young — the probable
starter. That never happened,
however, as Lammersen, recog
nizing Young's talent, did every
thing he could to make the transi
tion comfortable. No anger, no
jealousy. Just a lot of support and
teaching.
"I took it upon myself to make
it as easy for Tim to fit in to the
system," Lammersen said. "I
think it was clear right away that
he was going to be a significant
part of this year's team. I just
tried to help him out so his adjust
ment to the athletic side of college
life wouldn't be so hard."
Young couldn't find a better
tutor, either. Players and coaches
have gushed about Lammersen's
knowledge of the game. Not only
may you find a basketball buried
in his chest, but maybe lodged in
his cranium as well.
"Bart knows the game," Pop
pink said. "He knows what the
coaches want, and he helps the
coaches a lot too. He's also just a

really hard worker. A lot of the
younger guys don't have that
kind of attitude, but Bart shows
the younger guys how hard you
need to work to succeed at this
level."
Likewise Montgomery praises
Lammersen's disposition as a
leader, "What he's done is be a
consistent worker, and probably
the most impressive thing is the
leader he's turned into. As a
senior, he's turned out to clearly
be the leader, and it's always been
positive."
But now that Lammersen's
rise with Stanford basketball,
from a 7-23 ditch to a second
round appearance in the NCAA
tournament, has ended, what
does the future hold?
Even though he's graduating
with a degree in public policy, it
will still have to do with basket
ball. His sights are set on the
European leagues and maybe far
ther into the future, a front office
position in the NBA.
"If you're going to do some
thing in life, you might as well
enjoy it," Lammersen said. "And
most anything that has to do with
basketball I enjoy."
"Time running down, Stanford and Arizona all
tied up. Stoudamire down the lane. Shot sent back
by Lammersen! Cross on the break. All alone, pulls

here in front of everyone," Lammersen said. "And I
had a chance at the end to make a difference in the
outcome of the game, and I couldn't finish it.
"It was just disappointing because it was a
chance that comes along once in a career where you
had a legitimate shot at the end of the game to
decide the outcome. It hurts a little bit because you
didn't complete the play, yet you tried your hardest
to do it. I guess it comes with the territory because
if I had tipped it in I would have been the hero and
everything."
Major publications like the San Francisco Chron
icle would continue to dog the center for weeks to
come never realizing that it was Lammersen who
blocked All-American stud point guard Damon
Stoudamire's shot to prevent the win in regulation
and his hustle that placed him in such an opportune
place for such an inopportune act.
But then again, it's all about opportunity. Lam
mersen is not haunted because he missed the put
*back, but more because he realizes what could have
been.
"I think the Arizona game bothered him quite a
bit," said senior forward Andy Poppink. "It was an
opportunity for him to do something that he could
have held on to for the rest of his life."
Poppink, who had an opportunity the prior sea
son to down UCLA with a game-winning shot,
speaks from personal experience. "He doesn't feel
bad about missing it," Poppink continues. "It
haunts him because of the prospect of it going in.
What if it had gone in?"
If it had, it would have been a just reward for
Lammersen, who has essentially put everything he
has had on the court. Perhaps that's the main state
ment about the Arizona game. Whether it is
rebounds, rejections, lay-ups or even missed put
backs, Lammersen lets it all hang out.
Sportscasters and writers love to talk about
heart, but if you took a look inside Lammersen's
hefty chest you might not find one. In its place
might lie a gigantic beating basketball. Some play
ers have the love for the game, while others simply
live it. Guess which one Lammersen is?
While you may be hard-pressed to compare Lam-

mersen's journey on the hard
wood to a real-life "Hoop
Dreams," basketball nevertheless
has been a driving force in this
Virginia native's life.
"Even though I'm done, I still
love playing the game," Lam
mersen said. "You really can't
stop cold turkey. Basketball has
been my whole life since I was a
kid. The game of basketball has
given me the chance to meet some
great people and see some new
things. I've learned to handle
adversity better.
"Basketball's also kept me
focused. Growing up, I had
friends that weren't really run
ning with the right crowds. They
had tried to get me to hang out
with them, but simply because I
loved playing basketball so much
I didn't. Those guys are definitely
not where they could or should
have been or definitely where I
am now. Basketball's given me
the ability to keep my nose clean

and stay out of trouble."
Even out of practice he can't
seem to get enough of the game.
Off the court, his roommates are
teammates Poppink, David Har
bour and Warren Gravely. His
hobbies are his friends and his
friends are basketball.
"It's going to be tough because
they're such a big part of your
life," Lammersen said. "The guys
on the team, especially in my class
have been the most important
people in my life here. I've learned
a lot from those guys. The entire
team's just really close. The close
ness of all the guys will be
missed."
But don't be mistaken. Lam
mersen has given much more to
the game then simply, as he him
self puts it, "a big white guy who
likes to play and plays hard every
time out." With a career points
per-game average of 3.1, Lam
mersen isn't exactly an offensive
superstar; still, he has thrived in
his role off the bench and has
made the most out of his big-time
minutes (17.4 per game) by
relentless rebounding and
defense.
Throughout the season, the

"Hammer," as he has been aptly
dubbed, has displayed a no-holds
barred attitude in the trenches.
"I just think I use my body
well," Lammersen said. "I've
worked hard to put on some
weight. I'm not as quick as a Mar
cus Camby or Ed O'Bannon, but I
have more size. So I try to use it
and lean on people.
"I basically tell myself that no
one's going to get anything for
free. If you're going to foul some
one you might as well get your
money's worth. If he falls, I'll just
help him up and tell him that I'll
do it again. I'm not going to be
intimidated by anyone. If you go
out there and think that you're
tough, you might actually play
tough. On an everyday basis I'm
not a hard ass or a tough guy, but
on the court I just do what needs
to be done."
The 245-pound body of Lam
mersen will be sorely missed next
season. With his departure, that
leaves the Cardinal with just one
returning player over 6-8, fresh
man Tim Young.
"We're going to miss Bart
quite a bit," Poppink said. "He
provided leadership. Also, he's a

physical big guy, and we'll miss
his size, strength and toughness."
All season long, Lammersen
has been invaluable as a key
reserve off the bench when Young
either becomes winded or gets
into foul trouble.
"He was kind of thrust into a
role on the team," Montgomery
said. "He did a great job of accept
ing that role and saying that's
where I can help and that's what I
can do. He ended up being a real
ly good basketball player. He was
a guy that always knew what he
was doing. What you end up with
is leadership, stability and matu
rity to help a lot of the younger,
emotional guys. When he was
voted captain, it was a perfect
deal."
More than that however, Lam
mersen has been integral in the
tutelage of Young, Stanford's
freshman phenom.
"He's had a tremendous
impact in my development,"
Young said. "When I first started,
I was nervous and unsure. He
brought me along slowly. He was
always patient and helped me get
use to a new program and new
plays," Young said.

Still, the Cardinal's senior cap
tain could easily have perceived
the emergence of Young as a bit
ter pill to swallow with Lam
mersen being the senior and —
without Young — the probable
starter. That never happened,
however, as Lammersen, recog
nizing Young's talent, did every
thing he could to make the transi
tion comfortable. No anger, no
jealousy. Just a lot of support and
teaching.
"I took it upon myself to make
it as easy for Tim to fit in to the
system," Lammersen said. "I
think it was clear right away that
he was going to be a significant
part of this year's team. I just
tried to help him out so his adjust
ment to the athletic side of college
life wouldn't be so hard."
Young couldn't find a better
tutor, either. Players and coaches
have gushed about Lammersen's
knowledge of the game. Not only
may you find a basketball buried
in his chest, but maybe lodged in
his cranium as well.
"Bart knows the game," Pop
pink said. "He knows what the
coaches want, and he helps the
coaches a lot too. He's also just a

really hard worker. A lot of the
younger guys don't have that
kind of attitude, but Bart shows
the younger guys how hard you
need to work to succeed at this
level."
Likewise Montgomery praises
Lammersen's disposition as a
leader, "What he's done is be a
consistent worker, and probably
the most impressive thing is the
leader he's turned into. As a
senior, he's turned out to clearly
be the leader, and it's always been
positive."
But now that Lammersen's
rise with Stanford basketball,
from a 7-23 ditch to a second
round appearance in the NCAA
tournament, has ended, what
does the future hold?
Even though he's graduating
with a degree in public policy, it
will still have to do with basket
ball. His sights are set on the
European leagues and maybe far
ther into the future, a front office
position in the NBA.
"If you're going to do some
thing in life, you might as well
enjoy it," Lammersen said. "And
most anything that has to do with
basketball I enjoy."
"Time running down, Stanford and Arizona all
tied up. Stoudamire down the lane. Shot sent back
by Lammersen! Cross on the break. All alone, pulls
up for the three! No good! Lammersen with the
rebound! Lay-in no good! On to overtime...."
The day was Jan. 14. The time was approximate
ly 9:30 p.m. And the place was right underneath the
basket for Stanford's graduating senior center Bart
Lammersen. A chance of a lifetime to win the game,
a contest that Stanford eventually lost to Arizona in
overtime.
That will be a time and place Lammersen won't
soon forget. Even now, nine wins and 12 weeks
removed, the 6-foot-9-inch man still heaves a sigh
of regret when talking about that fateful evening
where basketball immortality was there for the tak
ing — only to clank off the front of the rim.
"The Arizona game at home for me was a per
sonal low point just because we had a ranked team
here in front of everyone," Lammersen said. "And I
had a chance at the end to make a difference in the
outcome of the game, and I couldn't finish it.
"It was just disappointing because it was a
chance that comes along once in a career where you
had a legitimate shot at the end of the game to
