## Bart! Senior center leaves legacy of leadership 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
"Time running down, Stanford and Arizona all
tied up. Stoudamire down the lane. Shot sent back
by Lammersen! Cross on the break. All alone, pulls
up for the three! No good! Lammersen with the
rebound! Lay-in no good! On to overtime...."
The day was Jan. 14. The time was approximate
ly 9:30 p.m. And the place was right underneath the
basket for Stanford's graduating senior center Bart
Lammersen. A chance of a lifetime to win the game,
a contest that Stanford eventually lost to Arizona in
overtime.
That will be a time and place Lammersen won't
soon forget. Even now, nine wins and 12 weeks
removed, the 6-foot-9-inch man still heaves a sigh
of regret when talking about that fateful evening
where basketball immortality was there for the tak
ing — only to clank off the front of the rim.
"The Arizona game at home for me was a per
sonal low point just because we had a ranked team
here in front of everyone," Lammersen said. "And I
had a chance at the end to make a difference in the
outcome of the game, and I couldn't finish it.
"It was just disappointing because it was a
chance that comes along once in a career where you
had a legitimate shot at the end of the game to
decide the outcome. It hurts a little bit because you
didn't complete the play, yet you tried your hardest
to do it. I guess it comes with the territory because
if I had tipped it in I would have been the hero and
everything."
Major publications like the San Francisco Chron
icle would continue to dog the center for weeks to
come never realizing that it was Lammersen who
blocked All-American stud point guard Damon
Stoudamire's shot to prevent the win in regulation
and his hustle that placed him in such an opportune
place for such an inopportune act.
But then again, it's all about opportunity. Lam
mersen is not haunted because he missed the put
*back, but more because he realizes what could have
been.
"I think the Arizona game bothered him quite a
bit," said senior forward Andy Poppink. "It was an
opportunity for him to do something that he could
have held on to for the rest of his life."
Poppink, who had an opportunity the prior sea
son to down UCLA with a game-winning shot,
speaks from personal experience. "He doesn't feel
bad about missing it," Poppink continues. "It
haunts him because of the prospect of it going in.
What if it had gone in?"
If it had, it would have been a just reward for
Lammersen, who has essentially put everything he
has had on the court. Perhaps that's the main state
ment about the Arizona game. Whether it is
rebounds, rejections, lay-ups or even missed put
backs, Lammersen lets it all hang out.
Sportscasters and writers love to talk about
heart, but if you took a look inside Lammersen's
hefty chest you might not find one. In its place
might lie a gigantic beating basketball. Some play
ers have the love for the game, while others simply
live it. Guess which one Lammersen is?
