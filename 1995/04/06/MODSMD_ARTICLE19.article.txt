# Lacrosse blows by Gaels
## Western States Tournament up next 
### Seth Goldstein Editorial staff 
St. Mary's 3
Stanford 14

East meets West. East beats
West.
Although Stanford's women's
lacrosse team (10-4 overall, 6-0 in
the Western Women's Lacrosse
League) dominated St. Mary's 14-
3 yesterday at Maloney Field, the
squad did not fare so well over the
break on a trip to Florida, when it
fell 18-5 to Middlebury College
and 20-2 to Harvard.
The win over the Gaels gave
the Cardinal a commanding lead
in the Northern Division of its
league. With only three confer
ence games remaining, Stanford
hopes to stay ahead of its tough
est rival, UC-Davis, and is look
ing forward to a possible
matchup against Southern Divi
sion leader UC-Santa Barbara.
"Our hardest games are
behind us," said junior defensive
player Hannah Flatau. "We
should be in control the rest of
the way."
Senior center Amy Leib helped
the Cardinal cause with three
goals and seven draw controls
(similar to a face-off in hockey or
tip-off in basketball). Stanford
also got another outstanding per
formance in the goal from senior
co-captain Emily Chang. Still,
despite the one-sided score, the
team wasn't all that satisfied
with its performance.
"We weren't playing all that
well," said senior Wendy Golden.
"No one was all that happy. Our
passing and ball control weren't
all that they should have been."
Flatau agreed with this assess
ment. "We were playing kind of
weird," she said. "We went from
trying to rise to the levels of East
ern schools (over spring break) to
playing down to the levels of
Western schools."
The team had traveled to St.
Petersburg, Fla., to play in a
number of scrimmages against
squads from the East Coast.
Every spring, eastern lacrosse
teams gather in Florida to cele
brate the fact that they can now
play outdoors and to work on
their skills.
Stanford felt that it had an
advantage over some of these
schools in that the Cardinal has
been playing for a longer period
of time this season. While this

played out during the scrim
mages and work-outs, strong
opponents outmatched Stanford
in the only two games that affect
ed its record.
Middlebury, the second
ranked Division 111 school in the
country, and Harvard, the No. 6
squad in Division I, showed Stan
ford a brand of lacrosse that the
Cardinal won't soon forget.
"It was really eye-opening,"
Flatau said. "Now we know
where we want to be in a few
years."
"We don't get that kind of
competition out here," Golden

added. "It was kind of a shock to
the system. It's a totally different
type of lacrosse out there. We
were able to hold our own at
times, but not for too long."
Stanford will have a chance to
flex its muscles more competi
tively at the Western States
Tournament this weekend at UC-
Santa Cruz. Teams from Arizona
and Texas will be in attendance
as well as league foes like Davis
and Santa Barbara. The Cardinal
will be placed in the toughest pool
with Colorado and club teams
from Northern California and
Seattle.
