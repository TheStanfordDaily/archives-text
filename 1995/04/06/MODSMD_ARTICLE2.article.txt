# Domestic violence reports increase
## 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
A recent rash of domestic violence re
ports on campus has raised questions as
to whether it is part of a bigger trend or
merely coincidence.
Four cases of domestic violence were
reported to the Stanford Police between
March 27 and April 3. In addition, two
domestic disputes were reported during
the same period. Domestic disputes in
volve no physical violence.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
was at a loss to explain the recent cases of

violence, saying he could not remember a
period when so many domestic incidents
were reported in such a short time.
"I can't predict trends," he said. "We
don't really normally have that many
cases of domestic violence. This is kind of
unusual."
Niemeyer did speculate, however, that
the increase may be related to an in
creased awareness among the victims of
domestic violence as a result of the heavy
publicity surrounding the O.J. Simpson
trial.
Thirteen cases of domestic violence
were reported in 1994, Niemeyer said. He

said there had been 14 in 1993, 10 in
1992 and 19 in 1991.
In the first case, on March 27, two stu
dents were arrested and booked for
felony domestic battery following an al
tercation in Escondido Village in which
both students were injured. Julia Gonza
lez Luna, a graduate student in the
School of Education, and Omar Ocon-
Hernandez had been dating according to
Niemeyer. The district attorney declined
to prosecute the incident.
On March 28, Michael Simek
was arrested for assaulting his
wife at their Escondido apart
ment. Niemeyer said that Simek
allegedly "beat and punched and
kicked his wife, who is consider
ably smaller." Simek was booked
and released.
Later the same day, a woman
reported domestic violence
inflicted by her husband. The
case is still under investigation,
and no charges have been filed.
According to Niemeyer, though,
there has apparently beei#a pat
tern of battery in the relation
ship.
Finally, two arrests were made
on April 3 when a married couple
had a disagreement and began
pushing and shoving. Although
there was no serious physical
injury, both Irene Li and Fukuo
Chang were arrested, Niemeyer
said.
"There was evidence of injury,
so we had no choice but to book
them," Niemeyer said.
