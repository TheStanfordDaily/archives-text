# Ruggers hope to ax Golden Bears
## But Cal is No. 1 
### Mike Jensen Contributing writer 
"It's like David and Goliath,"
said rugby coach Franck Boivert.
And don't let the No. 1 and 2
rankings fool you. When Stanford
takes Maloney Field this Satur
day at 1 p.m. for the annual rugby
version of Big Game, the Cardinal
definitely faces a steep uphill bat
tle.
California comes into the tra
dition-rich matchup undefeated
over the last three years of colle
giate competition. The top
ranked Bears have captured a
gaudy 11 of the last 14 national
championships and boast a squad
full of Ail-American candidates.
The varsity status of Cal rugby
gives the program added funding
and a boost in recruiting. To top it
off, Stanford hasn't defeated the
Golden Bears since 1979. It can
be stated, with little debate, that
Cal is the "Goliath" of men's col
lege rugby.
Hope is far from lost for the
Cardinal, however.
Stanford brings its No. 2 rank
ing to the table and is riding tall
in the saddle after a string of
impressive victories. Stanford

in a thrilling last-second victory,

-27-25, and then crushed No. 3
Colorado 52-0 at Boulder. The
team is coming into its final
league game playing by far its best
rugby of the season. Boivert cred
its the late season push to "enthu

siasm, discipline and fantastic
commitment."
In preparation for the home
stretch of the season, the team
traveled to Hawaii over spring
break. Enduring heat and humid
ity during a series of grueling two
a-day workouts, the Cardinal
strengthened its stamina and
endurance, both crucial to Satur
day's match against an incredibly

deep Cal squad.
Despite their impressive
bench, the Bears' greatest
attribute is size. However, Cal is
not a team of uncoordinated
brutes; doubling as the U.S.
national team coach, Cal's Jack
Clark is able to recruit skilled,
experienced players.
Stanford hopes to neutralize
its opponent's strength with

aggressive tackling. The position
of flanker plays a pivotal role in
providing hits, and is considered
one of the Cardinal's strongest
areas. Sophomore flankers Jared
Hopkins and Trung Ngo hope to
lead what Ngo described as "an
orgy of tackling."
Second-row player Jeff Siemen
also must continue his strong
play. The junior possesses incred

ible leaping ability that Stanford
hopes to utilize to gain possession
of the ball and control the game.
Sound technique and strong for
ward play are also keys to Cardi
nal victory, according to Boivert.
Against the No. 1 team in the
country, however, tactics can take
a team only so far. Ngo stressed
the importance of playing the
game to win. "It's a great oppor

tunity. We have to lay it out
there."
"This is the most important
game of their life," said a half-jok
ing Boivert. "It's like the quest for
the Holy Grail."
Stanford rugby definitely has
the heart and determination to
pull off the upset. The only ques
tion remaining is, will the Cardinal
bring its slingshot on Saturday?
