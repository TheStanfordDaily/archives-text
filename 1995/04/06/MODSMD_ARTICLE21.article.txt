# College sports in islands pack a Hawaiian punch
## 
### 
I would love to live in Hawaii. In one
week there, my friends and I got to
do a little of everything: We relaxed
on the beaches of Waikiki, caught some
waves at the North Shore and rode the
party bus to a luau. And we caught a
pretty good baseball game as well.
On the first rainy night of our vaca
tion, two of my buddies and I took my
relatives' season tickets and braved
intermittent showers to see the Univer
sity of Hawaii-Manoa shut out UH-Hilo
in the opening game of the UH Easter
Tournament. Two nights later, we
watched perennial powerhouse Wichita
State use a ninth-inning rally to defeat
the Rainbows — on television, in prime
time.
With no mqjor professional teams for
3,000 miles, college sports take center
stage in Hawaii. They make prime-time
television, lead stories in the local news
papers' sports sections and are a leading
topic of conversation among local sports
enthusiasts. At dinner one night, two of
my aunties discussed who was playing
well and which Rainbows needed to
break out of slumps.
As a college sports nut, I'd love to get
that type of coverage here — and I'm
sure I wouldn't have to scour the San
Jose Mercury News with my magnifying
glass to find a one sentence blurb about
Stanford winning another NCAA cham
pionship.

But would I be satisfied with my
sporting options if I lived there? Maybe.
Of course, in this day and age, they get
everything we see here via satellite. But
what about the thrill of being there? I've
always been spoiled, living in Orange
County at the doorstep of the Big A and
now just a quick jot away from five Bay
Area teams.

For my dad, growing up in Hawaii
was far from boring as far as live sports
were concerned. He tells me about pro
teams like the New York Giants and the
New York Yankees barnstorming after
their seasons ended in the 19505. And of
Roy Campanella bringing all-star teams
of African-American ballplayers to play
a series or two against local teams.
In the 19605, the Hawaiian Islanders,
a Triple-A team, played at Honolulu Sta
dium in town. Like many of the imyor
athletes he saw, the most famous
