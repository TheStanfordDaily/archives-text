Tiger Woods ready for Masters
It is the greatest assembly of golf professionals in the world. Yet
when the Masters ends on Sunday, the coveted green jacket could be
placed on the shoulders of a lanky, 19-year-old amateur.
Today, against the backdrop of the legendary Augusta National
Golf Club in Georgia, Stanford freshman Tiger Woods begins his
quest for a Masters title.
Woods' bid to beat the odds will be televised on the USA cable net
work today and Friday before CBS takes over the final two rounds.
