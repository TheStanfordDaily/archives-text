# Late Night with Marsh McCall
## 
### Martin L. Yeung 
You. Stanford student. What will you be
doing six years after graduation? Toil
ing, that's what. Unless you're the heir
to some stack of cash — or you marry some
one with mega-bucks — you'll be out labor
ing in the salt mines until the loans you took
to finance those go-go undergraduate years
are paid off.
But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the
taste of salt while you labor. Just ask Marsh
McCall, member of the Class of 1986. After
struggling as a writer for the Palo Alto Times-
Tribune for four years and then in L.A. for
two, he finally hit the big time.
Yeah, the big time. We're talking pressure
that causes ulcers the size of silver dollars and
hair loss faster than a patients

on chemotherapy. We're talk
ing about national TV, where
you're only as good as your last
show, and one goof can earn
you the scorn of a million
households. We're talking
about "Late Night with Conan
O'Brien."
Marsh was recently promot
ed to head writer in charge of
the writing staff on the show.
He's the equivalent of the man
aging editor here at The Daily
— one of the last lines of de
fense before the jokes go on the
air.
But however high and lofty
the position, 1 doubt Marsh is
being paid enough for all the
running he has to do. Other
wise, he would be taking longer
lunches and eating something
more zesty than the nasty mac
and-cheese dish from the NBC
studio commissary that he was
swallowing while we were
doing the interview....
The Daily. What exactly do
you do?
Marsh: I'm in charge of
writers on the show. I do a little
writing myself, but most of my
job is sifting, editing. We work
as a team; its a lot like newspa
per writing.
Where do you tape the show?
We're in Letterman's old
studio in Rockefeller Plaza.
Our guys tape the show around
5 p.m. The hours are pretty
rough, they can go for like 12
hours straight. We usually
come in at around 11 a.m. and
go home at around midnight.
One guy, who lives in Con
necticut, just brings in his
sleeping bag during the week
and camps out in the studio be
cause it's not worth it for him to
commute home. Thankfully,
we get weekends off.
How did you land the job?
The writing business is very
competitive. There was a lot of
luck involved, being at the right

place at the right time. After leaving the
Times-Tribune, I landed a few jobs in L.A. I
sold a script to the guy who was the former
head writer of the show. In July of' 93, the guy
hired me on a staff writer. Around January of
this year, the guy went off to write a movie
and I was promoted to fill his spot.
What are some of the famous people you've
met on the show?
The celebrities are not necessarily the ones
I'm most impressed with. Some of the people
I've been really excited to meet were people
who are TV icons, like Maureen McCormick
(Marsha on the "Brady Bunch"). I had a
crush on her while I was in high school. And
William Shatner (Captain Kirk). This week

we're doing a piece with Doug l.uellen (of
"The People's Court'' fame).
Truly, though, half the time I don't get the
time to meet the guests we have. It's weird be
cause I can quote for you every part of the
script's comedy, but I can't remember who
the heck we had on the air last night.
Do you enjoy your job?
Definitely. It never gets old, I never sit in
one place for too long. Hearing people laugh
at the stuff you wrote, it's definitely an ego
trip. And it's a daily challenge. You're only as
good as your last show, and you've got to keep
coming up with material.
Have you ever been on national TV?

I've written as well as performed in sketch
es. A lot of our writers have acting ability.
They've done improv or stand-up before. As
for myself... I had a periodic sketch where I
would play the guitar to these choir boys
singing songs commemorating the most ob
scure holidays or sing the wrong song to cel
ebrate the holiday.
After putting Marsh through my list of
hard-hitting, provocative questions, I
asked him about his wild and willy days
at Stanford. For you dullards who haven t al
ready guessed, this guy is the son of our eminent
Dean of Summer School and Classics Prof.
Marsh McCall....
So what's the wildest thing

— ~ — " ; - <?>
you're willing to confess you did
while an undergrad at Stanford?
I played in a rock bank
called "Color Force." We were
pretty popular and got a lot of
gigs. But the band broke up tem
porarily so we could all go off to
Stanford in wherever on over
seas adventures. When we got
back together, we were never as
good as we were before. So we
changed our name to "Chapter
111 also wrote for The Daily.
Do you have any advice for
kids students taking your dad's
(Humanities) CIV class?
If he makes up a multiple
choice exam, the answer will al
ways be % "C." It amazing that no
one has noticed this yet.
I used to write derogatory
stuff about my dad all the time.
L.ike once my dad and I went to a
dude ranch and a horse fell on
him. I wrote a column about it
and told students that if they
didn't believe me, they could call
him at home, and I put his home
phone at the bottom of the arti
cle.
Do you have any advice for
Stanford students now that you're
a alum and have a wealth of ex
perience behind you?
If I could go back, I would
definitely be a lot more wild than
I was before. The maturity you
gain while going through college
doesn't really benefit you until
you have the luxury of hindsight.
You don't realize a lot of oppor
tunities until they pass you by.
Don't waste all your time
studying and engrossed in acad
emics. Stanford has so much to
offer other than just academics.
Sure, right now you may be say
ing to yourself'l'm just too busy
with classes and some activity,'
but you really need to make an
effort. Doing well in class at the
price of enjoying college is a
high price to pay and you don't
realize it until it's over.
Hey, sounds like excellent
advice to me.
