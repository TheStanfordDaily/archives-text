# 'Martha & Ethel' director plots twists of life
## 
### Angie Chuang 
Both a curse and a blessing, the lack of a
script sets documentary filmmaking
apart from all other motion-picture
genres. Even the most perceptive director —
such as a filmmaker chronicling members of
her own family — cannot anticipate the idio
syncrasies of real life.
Such "plot" twists led Stanford graduate
student Barbara Ettinger and her high
schoolmate Jyll Johnstone through the evo
lution of a five-year project that began as a
20-minute short on Johnstone's nanny mov
ing across the country, and ended as a full
length piece spanning several decades, telling
the stories of both of their families and the
nannies who raised them.
The film's itle, "Martha & Ethel," reflects
the original intention to profile nannies
Martha Kniefel and Ethel Edwards largely
outside of the context of their respective
"families." However, it was a very unscripted
twist of fate that encouraged the filmmakers
to enlarge the movie's scope to include their
families. Ettinger refers to it as a "miracle."
"We were talking to Ethel on the porch,
filming her, and Mom walked in," Ettinger re
calls. "They started this great conversation,
the cameras kept rolling, and Ethel made the
most amazing statement. ... I thought,
'There's a lot more here than we had imag
ined.' "
Placed near the conclusion of the film, this
clip is a defining moment, a possible answer
to the two questions "Martha & Ethel" con
stantly raises: whether the mothers are threat
ened by a "rival" maternal figure and whether
the nannies regret not having children of their
own.
Explaining that the family's children are
really hers in a way, Ethel says, "You don't have
to birth a child to love it" — this is the state
ment that Ettinger found so moving. Ettinger
acknowledges, with no hint of jealousy or in
security, that she and Ethel share the role of
"mother" to the children.
What truly makes the moment, however, is
Ettinger and Ethel's singular chemistry, best
described by Barbara's narration, "Mom and
Ethel are addicted to each other, like an old
married couple."
In a particularly memorable interview clip,
the boisterous Ethel and usually reserved Et
tinger playfully make jokes and rib each other
like conspiring schoolchildren. Ethel sudden
ly becomes uncharacteristically camera-shy
and leans over to Ettinger, giggling and whis
pering, "What should 1 tell him [the camera
man]?"
A couple of minutes later, after she began
discussing Ettinger's merits, Ethel says to her
while maintaining a resolutely straight face,
"You are good-natured and I'm better."
The light-hearted bantering simultane
ously belies and illuminates the long and
often hard road that has brought the two
women together in semi-retirement. Ethel, an
African-American woman originally from a
sharecropper family in South Carolina, has
been a part of the Ettinger family through a
period of sweeping changes for women and
people of color, as well as the family itself —
including a divorce that left Ettinger a single
parent.
Watching such crucial moments as Et

tinger and Ethel's interactions, or Johnstone
and her children discussing her decision give
up childrearing for social commitments, we
might wonder why co-producer Barbara and
director/ producer Jyll had ever planned to
not involve the families.
Perhaps because both filmmakers were
aware of risks of autobiographical doc
umentary, they seem to have initially
shied away from thrusting themselves and
their family members into the spotlight.
As Ettinger's family members became in
creasingly drawn into the project, encourag
ing (even "forcing," she jokes), each other to

participate, they remained supportive and
willing to share themselves with potential au
diences, she says. Despite the very personal
and honest nature of the film, they always
"respected the artistic process and didn't sti
fle it," always giving Ettinger final decision
power.
Nevertheless, Ettinger found herself in the
spotlight when what started as an indepen
dent, low-budget project began to make the
rounds at film festivals all over the country,
including the high-profile Sundance, and was
picked up by mega-distributor Sony Pictures.
Sitting in her apartment near Stanford, Et
tinger, 40, has finished traveling to film festi

vals as "Martha & Ethel" opens for its regular
runs, and seems to have settled in to her more
quiet lifestyle as a student in the one-year So
cial Sciences and Education program. The
sounds of Enya drift into the living room,
with a computer workstation on one side,
cushy couch on the other; scattered on the
coffee table are anthropology textbooks and
an Ann Rice novel.
And it is with this mix of business and
pleasure, hard work and relaxation that Et
tinger reflects on her publicity commitments
— which, fortunately, were mostly complete
by the time she started at Stanford in Septem
ber.
However, with the shift from festivals to
big openings, the spotlight was even more in
tensified by the fact that Ettinger is both film
maker and subject. She says she does not have
regrets about involving her family so heavily,
but, recalling some of the difficult times, im
plies that the personal investments often be
came overwhelming under the public eye.
While the overwhelming response has
been very positive, Ettinger cannot forget one
journalist's particularly harsh criticisms,
which were directed at the people in the film
rather than at the filmmaking techniques. "I
have taken great care to protect my family,
while remaining very honest [in the film's
content]," Ettinger says. "But it was very hard
to encounter a personal attack. It was a film
about my family."
I'll never do it again," Ettinger says, refer
ring to the familial involvement, not film
making. Actually, she is already working
on her next documentary project, on the re
vival of the Native American Ojibwe lan
guage, with the same camera crew from
"Martha & Ethel."
Contrasting film to her other favorite
artistic pursuit, photography (she has taken
many portraits of Ethel), Ettinger emphasizes
the importance of trusting your collaborators
in a film project. "Their vision has to be simi
lar to yours," she says. "1 absolutely loved my
crew [for' Martha & Ethel'] so I wanted to stay
with them."
Also, Ettinger says, documentary film has a
unique ability to educate people, to send mes
sages. Here is where "Martha & Ethel" be
comes significant to a more universal set of is
sues, particularly the definition of the mod
ern family.
Pointing out that the nuclear father-and
mother childrearing structure is not as "tradi
tional" as many of us think, Ettinger says that
"Martha & Ethel" not only looks back to a
time when mothers routinely sought to share
their responsibilities, but also offers future al
ternatives to nuclear family structures — a
norm that is often, according to Ettinger, "un
reasonable" in today's world.
Citing her mother and Ethel as models for
two women at the head of a household, Et
tinger says that such less-conventional fami
lies "should not be looked upon with suspi
cion." Smiling, half-thinking about a planned
visit to her two "mothers" in the near future,
Ettinger says, "There is a bond that can't b;
found with a man and a woman. Women can
create a warm household."

discussing Ettinger's merits, Ethel says to her
while maintaining a resolutely straight face,
"You are good-natured and I'm better."
The light-hearted bantering simultane
ously belies and illuminates the long and
often hard road that has brought the two
women together in semi-retirement. Ethel, an
African-American woman originally from a
sharecropper family in South Carolina, has
been a part of the Ettinger family through a
period of sweeping changes for women and
people of color, as well as the family itself —
including a divorce that left Ettinger a single
parent.
Watching such crucial moments as Et

tinger and Ethel's interactions, or Johnstone
and her children discussing her decision give
up childrearing for social commitments, we
might wonder why co-producer Barbara and
director/ producer Jyll had ever planned to
not involve the families.
Perhaps because both filmmakers were
aware of risks of autobiographical doc
umentary, they seem to have initially
shied away from thrusting themselves and
their family members into the spotlight.
As Ettinger's family members became in
creasingly drawn into the project, encourag
ing (even "forcing," she jokes), each other to

participate, they remained supportive and
willing to share themselves with potential au
diences, she says. Despite the very personal
and honest nature of the film, they always
"respected the artistic process and didn't sti
fle it," always giving Ettinger final decision
power.
Nevertheless, Ettinger found herself in the
spotlight when what started as an indepen
dent, low-budget project began to make the
rounds at film festivals all over the country,
including the high-profile Sundance, and was
picked up by mega-distributor Sony Pictures.
Sitting in her apartment near Stanford, Et
tinger, 40, has finished traveling to film festi

vals as "Martha & Ethel" opens for its regular
runs, and seems to have settled in to her more
quiet lifestyle as a student in the one-year So
cial Sciences and Education program. The
sounds of Enya drift into the living room,
with a computer workstation on one side,
cushy couch on the other; scattered on the
coffee table are anthropology textbooks and
an Ann Rice novel.
And it is with this mix of business and
pleasure, hard work and relaxation that Et
tinger reflects on her publicity commitments
— which, fortunately, were mostly complete
by the time she started at Stanford in Septem
ber.
However, with the shift from festivals to
big openings, the spotlight was even more in
tensified by the fact that Ettinger is both film
maker and subject. She says she does not have
regrets about involving her family so heavily,
but, recalling some of the difficult times, im
plies that the personal investments often be
came overwhelming under the public eye.
While the overwhelming response has
been very positive, Ettinger cannot forget one
journalist's particularly harsh criticisms,
which were directed at the people in the film
rather than at the filmmaking techniques. "I
have taken great care to protect my family,
while remaining very honest [in the film's
content]," Ettinger says. "But it was very hard
to encounter a personal attack. It was a film
about my family."
I'll never do it again," Ettinger says, refer
ring to the familial involvement, not film
making. Actually, she is already working
on her next documentary project, on the re
vival of the Native American Ojibwe lan
guage, with the same camera crew from
"Martha & Ethel."
Contrasting film to her other favorite
artistic pursuit, photography (she has taken
many portraits of Ethel), Ettinger emphasizes
the importance of trusting your collaborators
in a film project. "Their vision has to be simi
lar to yours," she says. "1 absolutely loved my
crew [for' Martha & Ethel'] so I wanted to stay
with them."
Also, Ettinger says, documentary film has a
unique ability to educate people, to send mes
sages. Here is where "Martha & Ethel" be
comes significant to a more universal set of is
sues, particularly the definition of the mod
ern family.
Pointing out that the nuclear father-and
mother childrearing structure is not as "tradi
tional" as many of us think, Ettinger says that
"Martha & Ethel" not only looks back to a
time when mothers routinely sought to share
their responsibilities, but also offers future al
ternatives to nuclear family structures — a
norm that is often, according to Ettinger, "un
reasonable" in today's world.
Citing her mother and Ethel as models for
two women at the head of a household, Et
tinger says that such less-conventional fami
lies "should not be looked upon with suspi
cion." Smiling, half-thinking about a planned
visit to her two "mothers" in the near future,
Ettinger says, "There is a bond that can't b;
found with a man and a woman. Women can
create a warm household."
