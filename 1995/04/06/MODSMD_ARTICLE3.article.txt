"Lynn" Orr was named permanent dean of
the School of Earth Sciences on Tuesday,
after serving as interim dean since Septem
ber.
"I'm really delighted [Orr] chose to serve
as permanent dean," Provost Condoleezza
Rice said of the appointment. "I've never
seen stronger support from faculty. . . .
Everyone has been really enthusiastic."
Orr has taught at Stanford for just over
10 years and previously taught at New Mex
ico Tech in Socorro, N.M. He received his
undergraduate degree from Stanford in
1969 and his graduate degree from the Uni
versity of Minnesota. Both degrees were in
chemical engineering.
Rice said that Orr will face the same chal
lenges all other deans currently face. These
challenges include "maintaining and ex
tending the excellence of the school in times
of restricted funding." Rice added that she
believes the school is looking to get more ac
tively involved in undergraduate education.
Orr said he knew the committee was con
sidering him in its search so it "wasn't a
huge surprise." He added that he was sur
prised, however, at how quickly the com
mittee completed its work.
The School of Earth Sciences "has a
group of very good people and I'm really
glad to be working with them," Orr said.
Over the years, Orr has received several
awards for his work. He received the Distin
guished Faculty Award from the Society of
Petroleum Engineering and also garnered
the Earth Sciences Teaching Award last

year.
Orr has also been instrumental in this
year's extensive review of the School of

Earth Sciences, said for
mer Earth Sciences Dean
W. Gary Ernst, whom On
replaced. In the fall, Rice
appointed an external com
mittee to look at the school
"from top to bottom," On
said.
"They made a number
of recommendations for us
to follow up on," Orr
added. "They suggested

academic planning for the school . . . [and]
we've made our proposals to the provost to
make some new appointments."
Faculty members praised Orr's leader
ship and attributed his appointment to his
actions this year. "He's the perfect person
for the job," said Ernst, who served as dean
for five years before stepping down last fall.
"He has a very broad perspective and has
brought great cohesion to the school."
The search committee which recom
mended Orr was formed in January and was
headed by Chemical Engineering Prof.
George Homsy. The committee wrote to fac
ulty and graduate students in the school to
ask for input about the qualifications they
felt were important in a new dean.
According to Homsy, faculty members
were looking for someone to build consen
sus within the school. They were looking for
someone to "understand the new opportu
nities for the school" as well as improve on
the quantitative aspects of earth sciences.

"The world is changing," Ernst
said. "Faculty members are con
servative ... when it comes to
changing the focus of a discipline.
It's necessary for the University
to do new things â€” better teach
ing, better research. People are
now realizing how limited the
earth is."
Orr said his goal for the school
was for it to "be the best around."
He added that they will "continue
to work on problems with scien
tific interests," such as natural
hazards.
The school is "pretty good
right now, and we have every
intention in making it better," he
said.
