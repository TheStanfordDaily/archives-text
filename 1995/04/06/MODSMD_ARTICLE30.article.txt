# Used but not abused. . .
## The 						Bay Area recycled fashion scene 
### story by Kristie Lü Stout photos by Ari Kurtz 
Fashion is a form of ugliness so repug
nant you have to change it every three
months. But you can't afford that.
So you remain stagnant in that pair of
threadbare rayon palazzo pants that you, like,
swear you got your lubridermed hands on be
fore that Pi Phi in your econ class bought it.

Alas.
So you remain stagnant in that

black mesh shirt from "Interna
tional Male" that you, like, swear

you purchased before that
clubkid wore it at the last

Genderfuk.
You poor, poor

thing.
Well, suck it
up, baby,

suck it
up .

We're
speak i n

to you with
more glam-girl

punch than Linda
Evangelista in stillet-

to heels and we're here
to tell you this, bucko: End

the pathos. Hit the Haight.
Whip out the AmEx. Alter your

halter, and unleash the fashionphil
iac that lurks under that oh-so-typical Stan-

ford sweatshirt.
The Wasteland: Courtney Love was here
This joint is cooler than an Otter Pop.
It's so cool that Courtney Love bought a
slip here last week. It's so cool that Rev. Mor
ton Heat bought a necktie here two weeks ago.
It's so cool that Alyssa Milano has never made
an appearance here and continues to shop at
Wet Seal.
The Wasteland, located at 1660 Haight St.,
is a crowded warehouse of used, abused, and

temporally confused relics of pop trash. The
taste is eclectic: At our last visit, there was a
"bring out the gimp" black leather mask on

sale for $35, a pair of sequined hot
hot-hot pants for $15, a day-glo

feather boa for $18 and (for
those of you into disaster-

chic) a TWA safety vest for
$15.

The Wasteland is
mainly a store-

house for recy
cled wear; it

buy s
112 r o m

a n d
trades

with the
public. How-

~ ever, it also has a
selection of

spankin'-ncw clothing
such as hot pink vinyl

r skirts, lycra halter tops and
baby tees that proclaim such

hip-happenin mottos as "69" or
"Superstar." This mecca of garb is also

r a collection post for accessories such as
fluorescent pink Snork lunch boxes, sterling
silver cigarette boxes and Samsonite from the
'50s.

Although this joint offers a groovy collage
of nouveau-funk wear and accessories, it
doesn't provide a practical opt ion for the typ
ical student lifestyle or pocketbook. The
Wasteland may delight the hedonist in you

who yearns to suit up for a
guest appearance on MTV's
"The Grind," but it fails to pro
vide a good selection of flan
nels or 501s. Furthermore, the
poor selection of such student
staples is paired with hyper-ex
pensive price tags; the sparse
selection of non-novelty jeans
that they offer can reach near
$40. You'd have better luck at,
ack!, the Gap.
St. Vincent de Paul Thrift
Store: grandmomma-mia chic
St. Vincent, located at 1519
Haight St., is the bona-fide
thrift shop of the Haight. This
is the dive where you can find
velvet paintings of teary-eyed
clowns, Lawrence Welk on
vinyl and clothes that you
wouldn't be caught dead in un
less you think suiting up like
Jackie O or Frank Sinatra (circa
1959) is coolness.
St. Vincent is a charity or
ganization that sells donated
clothing, accessories and Nau
gahyde period pieces to raise

money for various projects. Unlike the
Wasteland, this joint does not specialize in
trendwear. But, if you scour the moth-balled
racks long enough, you'll find some incredi
ble retro garb at unbelievably low prices. The
scarlet Jackie O mini dress with a faux fur
lined collar is to drool for. This embodiment
of chic cost only 10 green ones. Like, incroy
able. We also stumbled upon a newish,
whitish, sexyish-but-virginish lessica Mc-
Clintock formal dress for only 12 bucks.
Paraphrasing Joey Lawrence, "Like, whoa"
Although St. Vincent's clientele primarily
consists of "priests, nuns and some professor
from Berkeley," according to salesperson
Margarita Cespellen, there have been sight
ings of "Sassy" magazine subscribers there as
well. During our investigation of St. Vincent,
our ears were assaulted by the shrieks of two
chicks in training bras:
Heather: "Like, omigod! I found these
leather knee-high boots for, like, $10!"
Heather No. 2: "No, way, Heather! That's
like too 'wow,' you know?"
St. Vincent sells pork pie hats to raise
funds for the poor and sells suede platforms
to raise the social status of struggling pre
teens. Even Mother Theresa would feel inad
equate.
La Rosa: la vie en fuschia
If you listen to Green Day, stay away from
this store. They don't want you here.
La Rosa, located on 1711 Haight St., is the
mecca of thrift store elitism. You will not find
baby T's here. You will not find skate-rat
Dickies here. You will not find Heather No. 2

here. Rather, you'll encounter an incredible
selection of resurrected vintage-wear and

pre-McCarthyism rarities that
attract stylists who have an
affinity for gothic-coolness, di
rector Tim Burton and Winona
Ryder wannabes.
According to store manager
Kristi Neff, La Rosa specializes
in "high-end vintage for the
vintage purist." The store caters
to such purists by not buying
from the public but, rather,
buying through wholesalers
who frequent estate sales.
Upon entering this bou
tique, expect exceptional qual
ity, juicy price tags and finger
snapping swing tunes. Em
broidered piano shawls from
the '20s sell for $100 to $250.
Vintage bowling shirts from
the '50s sell for 55 bucks. There
is also a great selection of faux
fur oddities and wearables,
Hawaiian shirts and Levi's.
Their hip collection of vintage
501s is what we consider to be
the best available on the
Haight: Variety is mucho.
Quality is tr£s. Warning: The
price is equivalent to three
CDs.
But hey, CD, Schmee Dee.

Charge it.
Buffalo Exchange —
Stephen Sprouse for nine bucks
It took us three hours to get out of this
store.
Although Buffalo Exchange (1555 Haight
St.) looks like a generic Ups n' Downs fran
chise, it's not. Granted, you can find the oc
casional overpriced mohair sweater here.
However, what makes Buffalo such an excep
tional hole-in-the-wall is the availability of
some awesome pieces from the '60s to the
'90s at prices lower than the 1Q of an Aero
smith groupie.
Take, for instance, a wool Stephen
Sprouse shirt for nine bucks, a Club Monaco
tailored jacket for $15 or a pair of patent
leather Kenneth Cole mary janes for just $30.
No wonder the likes of Tia Carrera, Winona
Ryder, Darryl Hannah, Weird Al Whatever
his-last-name-is and the 'Frisco cast of "The
Real World" have graced this store with their
moolah.
If you want trendyshit, you can find it here
... for almost nothing. Wicker handbags sell
for $8. Polyester golfing shirts for $3.50. Suzie
Wong dresses in red pseudo-silk are on sale
for less than the new Stone Roses CD. Other
incredible finds include a yellow ruffled tuxe
do shirt in polyester for $3, a pair of patent
leather four-inch stilletto heels for $7, a
brand new pair of Simples for $25 and a $3
gold lame tank top.
Groovalicious....
Kristie: Kiesha, I think I'm a fashion vic
time.

Kiesha: I know
that I am, with the silver
backpack to prove it.
Kristie: Blasphe
my. Karl Lagerfeld would
spit on you. You gotta lose
it. Like, pronto.
Kiesha: Right on.
Maybe I should replace it
with that lunch box from
the Wasteland.

Kristie: Word. The Snorks arc more bad
ass than vintage day-glo vinyl.
