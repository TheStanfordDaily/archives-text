# When life is Phair
## 
### Arnold Pan 
The provocatively-titled thread "Am I sposed
to like Liz Phair more..." on the alt.music.al
ternative newsgroup begs an answer. Entries
on the alt.music.alternative.female group give
these responses: "Liz Phair is a piece of shit"
and the subsequent retorts that "Liz Phair is
not exactly a piece of shit" and "Liz Phair is a
piece of cake."
Either and any way you slice it, Liz Phair has
become a cultural commodity, one of those
artists who has widespread name recognition
even though a large audience would be hard
pressed to recite any of her lyrics other than the
oft-quoted dirty ones. Her work has become a
badge for those who know best about such
things and a target for those who know better.
Consequently, her work has been taken for
granted as either stark brilliance or a simplistic
gimmick, marginalized because it has been
built up as a manifesto for feminine feminism
and cut down for the same reasons.
Back to the Internet, a sampling of posts
yields lots of opinions about Phair and what
her music reflects, though little about the
music itself. Says someone from Carleton Col
lege: "The movement for equal rights between
the sexes is going nowhere if Liz Phair is lead
ing the way."
If that's the case, Phair's forthcoming per
formance at the Warfield Sunday night might
be more a speaking engagement than it is a
rock V roll show. Then again, perhaps her
"solo electric" concert epitomizes the live ex
perience shtick instead, an event that plays off
the tendency of people to pay to witness an act
that's probably better on disc. Hut seeing is be
lieving as evidenced by the fact that the gener
al admission area sold out within a day.

Whatever her
reasons for
going on the
road now, one
can read it as an
attempt by Phair
to silence the
critics by con
quering her
well-document
ed stage fright;
that she flies on
her own without
the safety of a
backing band
hints at such a
sense of defi
ance. Add the
incorrect re
ports that she
canceled an au
tumn tour to
promote her lat
est album,
"Whip-Smart,"
to the mix, and
it's enough hype

to warrant a feature for a gig preview.
But when Phair takes the stage, all the hoopla
can't help but crash down because the image cre
ated by the photo spreads and the soundbytes
transmutes into a girl-with-a-guitar. That was
certainly the case when Phair made her last Bay
Area appearance a year ago: Dwarfed by the
massive Warfield stage, drowned out by her

guyville band
and outshined
by opening act
the Spinanes,
the most lasting
impression
Phair left behind
was that she
wasn't all that
different from
her fans. The
strong / weak
voice on her
landmark
debut, 1993's
"Exile in
Guyville," found
form in a ner
vous, college
graduated sub
urbia-brat, en
dearing and em
powering be
cause she gave a
glimmer of

hope that any of
! us might be able to

pull it off if we had to.
What's most startling about Fhair is
that she isn't really so. After listening
to "Exile" and the better bits of
"Whip-Smart," what jumps out isn't the four
lettered words or the bold-faced sexual refer
ences. Rather, it's the well-conceived pop-and

roll that grabs and doesn't let go, the kind that
draws one to sing along to the chorus of "Fuck
and run / Fuck and run / Even when I was 12"
without thinking too much about it. "Exile in
Guyville" is like the "Pulp Fiction" of alterna
tive music, a piece of pop culture so entertain
ing and so enthralling that it manages to sus
pend its audience's disbelief.
There's nothing shocking about Phair's dis
like of playing live. Least cynically put, what's
more "human" than shying away from the
adoring gaze of hundreds of your closest
strangers? Autobiographical or not, it can only
be difficult to put one's most personal
thoughts out for exhibit and have to look a
mass of humanity in the eye at the same time.
Who's to blame her if she needs a little help
from the crowd to get through the sticky parts
of "Flower," the silly tune where Phair became
identified Generation Slack's "blowjob
queen?"
Like anyone, Phair has a job to do and
touring is part of that, as she recently told the
Los Angeles Times — even could-be super
stars worry about obligations that must be
met. But unlike most working grunts, she
possesses control over her career: If anything,
the tour gives Phair a chance to shift the focus
back on her perfect pop, even if the news
groups dwell on what she's wearing. Recon
figured for a solo treatment, her beautifully
sparse confessions stand on their own, to suc
ceed or fail on Phair's improved playing. Es
pecially for someone who seems so interested
in controlling her own objectification and
transformation, performing live presents
Phair a valuable opportunity to reinvent her
music and herself.
