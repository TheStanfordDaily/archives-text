# Grub Focus on : The Duck Club
## 
### Michael G. Nichols 
The Duck Club is the Ralph Lauren of
restaurants. Set in the Stanford Park Hotel,
this small but fine dining establishment is
formal by California standards. In fact,
friend E. and I were the only ones wearing
jeans, though we donned dinner jackets for
the occasion in this house of fine fowl. In
other words, wait for your parents to take you
here — and dress nicely.
The food, like the New England ambiance
with southwestern accents, does not try to
imitate; rather, it strives to mark its own ter
ritory.
Though not large, the menu has several
dishes that catch the eye and earn points for
preparation. Appetizers include crab and
scallop cakes ($6.25) with spicy vegetable
slaw and sweet chili sauce and entrees range
from fowl to beef to fish, including a tempt
ing grilled swordfish ($17.50) served with
stir-fried wild rice, julienne vegetables and
garlic vinaigrette.
The specialty is, of course, duck. Though
only two varieties are offered, there's no need
for more. Governor Stanford's Favorite Duck
($17.95) is roasted crisp with ginger sauce
and candied orange, and Muscovy Duck
Breast ($18.25) is served over a fresh rata

touille with a port wine reduction.
We started with the appetizer sampler
($11.50), which offers venison capriccio,
smoked salmon and duck pate. Terrified im
ages of Nouveau Cuisine entered my head as
it arrived; though the configuration of food
on the plate was stunningly attractive, there
wasn't much to go around. And friend E.,
ravenous from the day, made it disappear all
the faster.
The tender venison was sliced thin like
steak tartar and accompanied by shaved
parmesan and juniper berries infused with
olive oil. With a tinge of clove in the flavor, it
was absolutely divine in my book but friend
E. found it too seasoned. The salmon was al
most raw, like sashimi, and served on thin
potato crisps. The flavor was only mildly
smoked, so it retained its fishy taste. The
duck pate, which is house-made, was served

with sweet onion relish and jelly. Although it
tasted distinctly unique — the tlavor was
hold and slightly peppery — it lacked the
harshness of some pate and was stunningly
delicious; the pate was the best of the three
offerings.
For the main course I had the dry venison
rubbed in herbs and spices with vegetables,
orzo (a small and delicate grain-like pasta
that appears and tastes like tender, broth
boiled rice) and sweet apricot sauce ($17.50);
my friend opted for the Muscovy Duck (with
the same accompaniments).
Both were excellent choices, but the veni
son is not for the faint of heart. Though I fell
for its flair, this dish was spicy enough to
make friend E. pucker and send the offering
back to my plate. Unfortunately, the undeni
ably perfect meat loses character to the heavy
seasoning, and the apricot sauce can't quite

hold hack the hite. This is hunting lodge food
only for carnivores who find most meat bland
and lifeless.
The Duck Muscovy was something all can
love. It was so good that friend E. actually had
the audacity to demand back some of the
generous portion he gave me to taste. The fla
vor was full and round, the tastes simmering
together rather than emerging separately. It
was unlike any fowl friend E. had ever tasted
and was so superior to the other duck that it
seemed a dish all its own. The coup de gras
was its sauce — adding to and not battling
against, complimenting rather than aug
menting, the taste of the meat.
The desserts ($3.25 to $5.95), with names
like Candy Bar Ice Cream Fie, are surprising
ly down-home. We opted for the Chocolate
Stonehenge ($7.50 for two): a chocolate
mouse, orange creme brule and nougat
tower with a toasted walnut brownie and
chocolate truffles on the side. Don't be fooled
by the description — my friend called the
shockingly small dessert the "first disap
pointment of the evening." The tower was
frozen solid, and friend E. actually looked
rather humorous trying to split it, attacking
the sweet like an angry archeologist attempt
ing to dissect an Arctic find. Finally, social
conventions be damned, we resorted to eat
ing it with steak knives.
The Duck Club has its drawbacks —
pricey wine ($5-$7 per glass), small appetiz
ers, and imported-tasting desserts — but if
you come just for the duck you'll find your
trip unforgettable.
