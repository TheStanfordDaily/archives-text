# LEGENDARY BLUESMAN BUDDY GUY STOPS BY FOR A LITTLE SOULFUL SINGING
## 
### SEETA GANGADHARAN 
Imost 25 years ago, in"The Story of
the Blues," Paul Oliver traced the
of this musical form from
backwater origins to urban centers. Accord
ing to Oliver, younger guitarists, born in the
mid-19305, elaborated on the technique of
8.8. King, who inherited his from T-Bone
Walker and Guitar Slim. This technique con
sisted of contrasted long and whining notes,
clearly cascading rapid runs, explosions and
flurries, clever embellishments and repeated
riffs with the vibrato amplified in pulsating
sound at peak volume. "Buddy Guy |was|
perhaps the best and most flamboyant of
these guitarists," Oliver wrote.
Flamboyant? Oliver, in his nearly apoca
lyptic and purist way, was predicting the
death of the blues back then, and flamboy
ance and implicitly Buddy Guy "types" were
not to be excluded from this pending funer
al. Hxalting a folk form of the blues, Oliver
argued the blues "shows every sign of cultur
al decline; the ascendancy of for

mal mannerism over content,
the rococo flourishes and

extravagant posturings
both physically and in
strumentally are signs

of an art form in its
final stages."
Obviously,
Oliver was wrong
in both aspects.

which has the capacity to reach every one of
us no matter what the listening trend or au
dience preferences may be. And Buddy Guy
is, perhaps, one of the greatest blues artists
who has made it his priority to keep this
genre alive and well. He realizes his responsi
bility to carry on the blues tradition, espe
cially since Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf,
L ittle Walter, and a plethora of other greats
are no longer around to pick up the pieces
should Guy drop out of the running. In an
interview with Billboard editor Timothy
White, Guy reminisced over the inception of
his 1991 Grammy-winning album, "Damn
Right I've Got the Blues."
"I realized all those who taught me were
gone, and if I didn't do it, maybe nobody
would, so damn right, I got the blues!" Guy
said.
Without a doubt, this attitude is part and
parcel of what electrifies any Buddy Guy per
formance. And any fan, new or old, who has
seen Guy on tour, knows that he is living his-

tory. A Buddy Guy concert isn't just a
collection of songs. It's a blizzard

of songs and bits of songs that,
pieced together, reflect the
full history of the blues,
rock and soul.
reach this status,
I Guy had to endure a
■ rite of passage into the
blues world which many
artists as gifted as him have
not experienced. From his
break into the industry in
the 19505, Buddy Guy has
suffered scorn, diminishment,

fits of jealousy by envious rivals
(his guitars were stolen on sever
al occasions) and repeated career

frustrations (including a ten-year recording
hiatus).
George "Buddv" Guy was born to a
farmer / woodcutter in a tiny

house in
Lettsworth, La.

on July 30, 1936. Working five days a week
for his parents in this sharecropping town
which lies some 50 miles north of Baton
Rouge, young Guy eventually was permitted
to pick cotton on Saturdays so that he could
earn his own meager wages. Around the time
he was 13, Guy's father installed electricity in
the house and bought a phonograph. The
wages which Guy saved were promptly and
eagerly spent on first John Lee Hooker's
"Boogie Chillen'"and from there on a count
less number of blues 78s, for 69 or 79 cents a
package. Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, John
Lee Hooker and countless other releases on
Chess Records became the staple of Guy's lis
tening diet.
Their music, imbued with the events of
the period (the Great Migration of African-
Americans, the Depression, World War I, the
ascendancy of American leadership), seeped
into the anxious mind of Guy. From those
artists, he developed his yearning to play the
blues.
With a makeshift guitar — screen door
wires stretched over tops of paint cans —
Guy tried to imitate "Boogie Chillen' " until
his father, exasperated with the continual
damage to the door, bartered for an acoustic
guitar for the aspiring musician. It was

the beginning of an endless love affair
that Guy diligently nurtured in the

following years until his devotion
paid off and he was sought out by

Big Poppa Til ley.
With Poppa Tilley, Guy played the Baton
Rouge-area circuit for one-and-a-half years
— but not too successfully. On top of gig
ging, Guy was forced to work long hours in
order to support his younger brothers' edu
cation as his mother lay bed-ridden due to a
stroke. Eventually, Guy took up a full time
job as a custodian at Louisiana State Univer
sity. Hopes of becoming a professional musi
cian were grim, if not altogether wiped out of
the picture.
Yet, when his mother recovered, she urged
him to ship out of Louisiana so that his talent
would be recognized. And with her blessing
and demo tapes sent first class to Ghess
Records' Chicago headquarters, Buddy Guy
embarked on a train in 1957, headed for the
country's blues capital.
Jerked around, ignored, and impover
ished, Guy did not get his first break until ap
proximately a year later. Guided by a
stranger, who had picked Guy up on the
street corner and asked Guy to play for him,
the young guitar slinger was led to the most
celebrated blues joint, the 708 Club, where
he impressed the crowd with jarring rendi
tions of Jimmy Reed classics.
This performance immediately bolstered
Guy's popularity and gained him the respect
of other blues musicians, including Muddy
Waters, Guy's longtime idol. His entry into
the blues world was somewhat secured, and
once he established himself as an ax wielder
to contend with — cutting contests versus

the likes of Earl Hooker, Magic Sam, Otis
Rush and even Muddy Waters himself —
Guy advanced rapidly.
The continual drive to develop his own
style led Guy to experiment and fuse all sorts
of styles and techniques of playing. In addi
tion to drawing from 8.8. King, T-Bone
Walker and Guitar Slim, Guy experimented
with distortion sounds, in-tune squeals,
droning cries, and most importantly, feed
back effects. He learned to pound, thump
and skip his pick with the feedback in order
to create a spiraling vibrato effect. And he
used a 150 foot electric cord on his guitar, so
that he could walk in and around the club
while still playing (a suspicious Earl Hooker
actually ripped it off from him).
These inventions on the guitar earned
Buddy Guy relatively unrivaled popularity
in the late '50s and '60s and got him a
recording deal with Cobra Records and then
Chess Records. Although it had always been
his lifelong dream to record with the label,
his relationship with owner and producer
Leonard Chess was turbulent. Chess bad
mouthed Guy and refused to give him any
accolades for his innovations on the electric
guitar. Chess furthermore failed to recog
nize Guy's amazing capacity to adapt to the
tastes and styles of various other artists, a
versatility which produced sweet cuts with
various blues ensembles. This uncomfort
able interaction between company and artist
put a strain on Guy and possibly resulted in
a delayed release of an invaluable compi-

lation of sessions recorded between
1960 and 1964.

■■hollowing the '60s, Buddy Guy
r descended into relative obscuri
ty and fell from the limelight,
is not to say that he became un-

popular. In contrast, his popularity in
rock circles since his entry into the blues
world has continued to prosper. Yet, per-

haps because of this, Guy has taken a back
seat to those performers who capitalize on
his style and technique of electric blues gui-

tar playing.
When Buddy Guy plays on The
Farm, how will the Stanford cam
pus react to this great blues artist?
How many of us realize the legend which
performs before us?
Arguably, at Stanford we are neither here
nor there in the world of blues music — 1
think it's accurate to portray our population
as being largely out of sync with the rest of
the music audience in America, if not apa
thetic to this original American music form.
In October, when the Stanford Concert Net
work brought blues guitarist Chris Duarte
to the Coffee House, the audience seemed
unaffected by this Texan ax wielder. Duarte,
who has periodically played with Buddy
Guy, put on an amazing show and exuded
an electric blues energy which Stanford
folks did not, or simply could not, tap into.
This type of reaction is embarrassing. Yet
a tepid reception of blues is an occurrence
with which artists such as Buddy Guyare not
unfamiliar. The songs he plays are an Amer
ican art form about which many in the col
lege generation are mis-, un- or under-in
formed. If we have been exposed to Buddy

Guy, it is probably through Jimi Hendrix,
Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Steve Miller, Carlos
Santana, Eddie Van Halen, Robert Cray, Ste
vie Ray Vaughan and Eric Clapton, whose
assimilations and reinventions of Buddy
Guy's style virtually rendered Guy obsolete.
Not until big-time rock star Eric Clapton in
vited Buddy Guy to Royal Albert Hall in
London in 1991 did the legendary blues
artist begin to receive mass-media acclaim.
While he's grateful for the support of in
dustry superstars, the Louisiana-born gui
tar legend also laments that these same mu
sicians dominate the American musical
marketplace, Guy told the Baltimore Sun.
He and most of his gifted contemporaries
continue to glean little from their lifelong
efforts in the blues. Clapton's record "From
the Cradle" reached No. I on Billboard
charts — a first for a blues record. Yet the
songs which Clapton recorded were written
by Muddy Waters, Bobby Bland, T-Bone
Walker and Eddie Boyd. In the interview
with the Sun, Guy asked, "What did we do
to deserve what we don't get?"
Through mega-stars of rock-'n-blues,
Guy is best known and has been "rediscov

ered." Yet Buddy Guy is and should no
longer be considered as such. With two
Grammy-winning albums under his belt —
"Damn Right I've Got the Blues" in '91 and
"Feels like Rain" in '92 — along with the
Billboard Century Award, critics are gradu
ally recognizing that Guy has been here all
this time. While he's no mass-media-cul
ture hero (for which we may all be thank
ful), his electric blues do move. "All blues
are lusty, lyrical realism charged with taut
sensibility," Richard Wright wrote in the in
troduction to "The Meaning of the Blues."
Guy is a living testament to this. Perhaps,
with Buddy Guy, we will be less preoccupied
with Stanford goings-on and will actually
take the time to listen to this legendary elec
tric blues guitarist. We would be wise not to
miss the opportunity.
