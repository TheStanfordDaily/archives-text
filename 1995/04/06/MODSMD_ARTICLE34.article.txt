# CONTROVERSIAL
## SCBN'S WOULD-BE BUTTON-PUSHER: 'THE BILL DOUGLAS SHOW' SERVES UP THE SHLOCK OF THE CRUDE VIDEO 
### ILANA MANTELL 
Mrii he Bill Douglas Show" is likely
I to offend, amuse and perhaps
even inform. Created by senior
Bill Douglas, the hour-long pilot premiered
on March 16 on SCBN (Channel 5 on Stan
ford cable).
I approached the show with skepticism:
Would students care about a very low-bud
get, sex-oriented, alternative talk-variety
show? But as I was watching preview tapes in
my dorm lounge, every person who walked
by had something to say. After getting over
the shock of seeing dildos as big as an arm or
the Virgin Mary in orgasm, there were sever
al common responses:
"This is the most disgusting thing I've ever
seen."
"Why are you watching this?"
1 was surprised to find myself defending
the show. For all of its crude skits and low
level humor, there were several quality dis
cussions. While Douglas states that his pur
pose is to "challenge mainstream ideas and

discuss sexuality," the show has an identity
crisis — exemplified by the variety and treat
ment of topics — which makes it difficult to
categorize.
ARTICULATE AND LOADED
An example of this split-personality treat
ment is the interview with seniors Stew
Richardson and Mike Szwed that was in turns
philosophical debate and juvenile mockery.
Don't be misled by the fact that they smoked
four packs of cigarettes and drank half a case
of beer during the course of the interview —
they are quite articulate and not to be dis
missed.
Richardson and Szwed argued that Stan

ford is becoming more uptight, adding that
admissions now favors "nerds who study 25
hours a day,"and has lost the "individualistic
atmosphere the school has a reputation for."
They went on to say that this attitude has
led to a more narrow-minded student popu
lation and that "intellectualism is dead" on

campus. The two criticized
students who are "so con
ventional" as to shun drug
use and other such experi
mentation, declaring that
students don't decide on
their own, hut "blindly ac
cept anti-drug propaganda."
"Nancy Reagan says 'lust
say no' and they listen,"
Richardson said. "This is a
woman who consults an as
trologist [to make deci
sions]."
Throughout the interview,
Douglas guided his guests in
an entertaining yet very cere
bral discussion. But there
were many other segments
which seemed to have been
made by an adolescent with a
video camera gone terribly
wrong.
The "Ganja Gary" skit
("this man has done more
drugs than Buddha!") also
encouraged students to ex
periment with drugs — and
actually showed viewers
how. It was mildly offensive,
but perhaps would be amus
ing once you've had several
beers.
Which is not to say that
Douglas' interview with
Vicky Vagina wasn't funny,
exactly. The thought of a
talking, smoking latex vagi
na who "likes Sigma Chi
penises" and hangs around
Roth House is so ridiculous

that you might laugh, but probably wouldn't
admit it the next morning.
If nothing else, such episodes taught me
that even bathroom humor is an art. Where
as his expose on San Francisco club scene was
relatively "decent," the interview with Satan
and the Virgin Mary showed that Douglas
holds nothing sacred, especially the sacred.

Of all those freshmen who caught passing
glimpses of this episode, their level of offense
was in direct correlation with how often they
attend church. One of my friends suggested
the following warning: "If you take religion
seriously, you will be shocked. If you are in
the Campus Crusade for Christ, you will
probably be offended, and may want to save
time by writing that letter to the editor right
now."
LOW-QUALITY DECONSTRUCTION
But Douglas himself acknowledged that
this wasn't intended to be high-quality pro
gramming.
When I asked the inevitable question —
"Why are you doing this show?" — Douglas
said that "the purpose of the show is to de
construct. To deconstruct authority figures,
deconstruct taboos and deconstruct tradi
tions which enjoy juggernautic devotion.
"I want to encourage students to open up,
to express themselves without fear and to be
themselves completely," Douglas said.
This higher-mindedness came through in
his interviews with senior author Aida Croal
and the band Fez.
But much more characteristic of the
show's sensationalist nature were the seg
ments featuring non-student and self-pro
claimed sexpert Amanda Kovattana. In one
episode, Kovattana is topless except for a

Hawaiian-style "lei" made of tampons. One
wonders why Kovattana appears half-naked
in the segment, other than to appeal to horny
freshman guys. They may not be interested,
however, in her discussion of using sea
sponges instead of tampons in an effort to
preserve the environment. She explains how
sponges save money as they can be used over
and over "until they fall apart." While
sponges may be inconvenient in public re
st rooms, Kovattana said they give women an
alternative to tampons and help foster a
"more intimate relationship with [one's]
blood."
Kovattana reappeared in a truly educa
tional segment about sex toys and dildos. Her
enthusiasm occasionally seemed like an in
fomercial, yet 1 was impressed with her
knowledge on the topic and her incredible
collection.
SENSATION VERSUS INFORMATION
Yet as a viewer, 1 felt that Douglas must de
cide whether he will pander to the lowest de
sires of his audience, or seriously inform
those who have questions about sexuality.
The first segment of the show attempted to
do both but seemed more sensational than
informative. It featured a panel of Stanford
women openly discussing sexual issues and
answering questions like "I'm a 25-year-old
female grad student and I've never had an or
gasm — what should I do?" or "Is it possible
to masturbate too much?"
Douglas' future plans for the show include
a panel discussion of lesbianism at Stanford.
Meanwhile, as one of my friends com
mented, "there is nothing [I] can say which
could prepare Stanford for this."
While Douglas is working to "de-sensitize
[that which is considered] taboo," I am left to
wonder how future episodes will turn out.
Although Douglas promised to be both
"responsible and sensitive," I can't help but
wonder whether he wants to show mature
role models for students questioning their
sexuality or broadcast all-out fights about
whatever topic he can exploit. That remains
to be seen.

women openly discussing sexual issues and
answering questions like "I'm a 25-year-old
female grad student and I've never had an or
gasm — what should I do?" or "Is it possible
to masturbate too much?"
Douglas' future plans for the show include
a panel discussion of lesbianism at Stanford.
Meanwhile, as one of my friends com
mented, "there is nothing [I] can say which
could prepare Stanford for this."
While Douglas is working to "de-sensitize
[that which is considered] taboo," I am left to
wonder how future episodes will turn out.
Although Douglas promised to be both
"responsible and sensitive," I can't help but
wonder whether he wants to show mature
role models for students questioning their
sexuality or broadcast all-out fights about
whatever topic he can exploit. That remains
to be seen.
