Rape victims and Nazi criminals alike
will have their stories told tomorrow
night in "Voices of the Victims: A Col
lage of Personal Narratives from Nazi Ger
many and Bosnia." Presented by the drama
department, the play features the first-per
son stories of victims and perpetrators from
the Holocaust during World War II and
from the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.
"It's not really a play, since a play implies
a beginning, middle and end. It's more of a
theatrical collage," said senior Mark Bra
nom, who created and directed this produc
tion.
The cast of seven lend their voices to the
words of rape victims in Bosnia, war crime
perpetrators, victims from Nazi concentra
tion camps and others. The text came out of
articles from newspapers, books and maga
zines, as well as personal interviews and
speeches where survivors spoke of their ex
periences.
"I started out with 4,000 different stories
and now [have] 25," said Branom.. |Dra
maturgj Alison Duxbury and 1 took all of
the research and found the stuff that was the
most dramatic and compelling theatrically."
Branom, a URO grant recipient, re
searched at museums and libraries around
the country, including the Simon Rosenthal
Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles. Soon
he found himself deluged with information
and stories from victims and survivors.
"I got tons of material," he said. "Literally
thousands of documents about Bosnia and
hundreds of thousands about Nazi Ger
many."
Branom wrote the script during the first
half of winter quarter, and finished it in Feb

ruary. "I've chosen which stories get to be
told, but 1 think all the stories pretty much
speak for themselves," Branom said.
Actor Thomas Freeland, a graduate stu
dent in drama, thinks it is helpful that the
style is so simple. "It could've been a great
deal more traumatic if we had to act out a
rape scene on stage," Freeland said. "I think
Branom was wise to just leave it simple and
keep the words directly from the people and
not try to dramatize or re-create any events."
"Theater isn't well suited to fully depict

events like these," Freeland added. "You
can't have detailed reconstruction of a real
event on stage. Mark was very wise to keep it
to the level of people telling their stories,
which is what theater is really suited for."
In what Branom calls a "theatrical docu
mentary," Freeland plays several different
characters, like the rest of the cast. These in
clude, among others, a Serbian soldier who
raped several Bosnian women and killed
several Muslim men and a Nazi officer in

volved with the mass-murder at Auschwitz.
Freeland said it is tough to play "only had
guys." "It's very hard to speak nonchalantly
of having a young girl raped. It's difficult to
say things like that and then say that in a very
callous way," he said.
"Voices of the Victims" grew out of Bra
nom's interest in the parallels between the
situation in Bosnia and the Holocaust in
Nazi Germany.
"Fifty years ago we said we'd never again
allow this sort of thing to happen and then
we go off and let it happen again," Branom
said. "The things that I've heard recently on
why we shouldn't get involved in Bosnia are
some of the same things that Prime Minister
Chamberlain said about Nazi Germany. His
words are almost exactly what people were
saying in the Senate and the House of Repre
sentatives."
"What I want people to get out of it is to
raise their awareness of the situation," Bra
nom said. "Without people constantly being
reminded of these things, they begin to fade
away."
This 30-minute production will be pre
sented with two short sound plays lasting a
little more than half an hour â€” "Victoria
Station" by Harold Pinter and"The Cask of
Amontillado" by Edgar Allen Poe.
WHAT: "Voices of the Victims: A Col
lage of Personal Narratives from Nazi
Germany and Bosnia"
WHERE: The Nitery, Old Union.
WHEN: 8:15 p.m. Friday, April 7 and
Saturday, April 8.
