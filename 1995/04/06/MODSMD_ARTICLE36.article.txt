# Flicks — The Spring Quarter Lineup
## 
### 
Now that we've sprung forward and it will
stay lighter longer, along comes the new
Flicks schedule to draw us back into the dark.
This quarter's schedule is, with one glaring
exception, rock solid. The schedule should
appeal to fans of all genre, too: There are sci
fi films, dramas, comedies and even two mu
sicals. And, of course, "The Graduate."
As usual, there are two showings each
Sunday night, at 7 p.m. and 10 p.m., in
Memorial Auditorium. A pass to see all 10
movies costs $20. Individual-show tickets
are $3. And what are the shows? Here we go:
April 9 — Pulp Fiction
What haven't you heard about this movie?
Quentin Tarantino gives us this baby, which
means lots of violence and a fair-to-mid
dling soundtrack. The difference between
"Pulp Fiction" and "Reservoir Dogs" is that
this one's funny. One of this year's best pic
ture Oscar nominees, it is, stunningly, the
first of two John Travolta Flicks and also fea
tures Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman and
Bruce Willis. All the cool kids are seeing it.
April 16 — Star Trek Generations
The members of the "Star Trek: The Next
Generation" TV show meet up with battle

weary Captain James T. Kirk to battle Scot
tie's ever-increasing girth. A sub-plot has
Data solving the riddle of Kirk's hairpiece.
Seriously, if you watched the show, chances
are that you'll head to this movie. Patrick
Stewart, LeVar Burton, William Shatner and
all those spacey actors make an appearance.
April 23 — The Shawshank Redemption
Another best picture Oscar nominee. This
excellent movie explores the relationship be
tween two prison inmates, portrayed by
Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Based
on a Steven King story, it's not a horror
movie but a touching, bittersweet exposi
tion. You'll leave the theater satisfied.
April 30 — Bullets over Broadway
Woody Allen's latest, surprisingly not a de
scription of life with Sinatra-ex Mia Farrow.
Rather, the script explores what happens
when mobsters take over a Broadway play —
a nifty piece of concept work. Woody plays
this one for more laughs and less philosophy
than, say, "Shadows and Fog." Dianne Wiest
and John Cusack are the big stars.
May 7 — Grease
Travolta again, now with Olivia Newton-
John. A fluffy but fun musical. Good girl

meets bad boy and love ensues, with plenty
of 1950s trappings to make the trip enter
taining. Be forewarned, the movie is chock
full of songs that just love to stick in your
head like "Summer Lovin'" and "Greased
Lightning."
May 14 — Clerks
A comedy about, well, clerks — specifically a
convenience store employee and his friend
who works at the video store next door.
Filmed in black and white, it's like "Slacker"
— not much happens, but the unique char
acters can be pretty entertaining. This movie
focuses heavily on the sexual, everything
from necrophilia to "snowballing." (If you
don't know what it is, go see the movie.)
May 21 — The Blues Brothers
Consistently one of the highest-attended
flicks, this movie may have the greatest
soundtrack of all time. It certainly is one of
the funniest movies of all time. John Belushi,
Dan Aykroyd, James Brown, Aretha
Franklin, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway... I'm
running out of breath. Terminally cool. See
it.
May 29 — Hoop Dreams
Showing on a Monday night, with only one

show, at 8:30 p.m. A documentary about two
high-school basketball players with dreams
of making it big. Many, many people were
shocked and disappointed when this film
was not nominated for a best picture Oscar
— indeed, it was even unfairly snubbed for a
best documentary nomination. Any basket
ball lover will enjoy this film, but it's not just
for sports nuts. Any lover of humanity will
be touched by the profiles.
June 4 — Dumb and Dumber
And the schedule had been so good. The
idea is to have a mindless film for Dead
Week. Mindless it is. Bad it is, too. Jeff
Daniels and Jim Carrey play two idiots who
try to return mob money to the gorgeous
woman they believed lost it in a drop-off
scheme. Yep, it's just about that good.
June 11 — The Graduate
A Flicks tradition. The very funny story of
new alum Dustin Hoffman and his affairs
with both ultra-sexy Anne Bancroft and her
daughter. Norman "Mr. Roper" Fell makes a
great cameo as a Berkeley landlord. As usual,
seniors wearing their cap and gown will get
into this showing free.
— Andy Dworkin
