"Medusa"
Annie Lennox

Pleasure and pain. Upon first listening to
Annie Lennox's new album, "Medusa," I
began to understand why people sabotage
relationships; give up salt, sugar and fat
from their diets; and watch really weird, de
pressing movies. Lennox has mastered the
art of ambivalence. She has conquered a
magic quality that enables her to vocalize the
most tearingly melancholy feelings without
being overwhelmingly depressing.
"Medusa" consists of Lennox's versatile,
gorgeous voice covering songs by a diverse
group of other artists, set against music
which, in scale and diversity, closely resem
bles landscapes such as snowy mountains,
purple sky during a desert dusk and the
horizon of the ocean at sunrise. "Medusa" is
both vaguely familiar and breath-taking.
In the beginning, however, "Medusa"
doesn't look promising. The first song, "No
More 'I Love You's,' " (originally by the
Lover Speaks) is as pop as anything Elvis'
new stepson has ever recorded.
But "Medusa" deserves intense attention,
as would any powerful and somewhat
snakey entity. The album is multi-layered,

112 ull of soul and surprises. Lennox takes oth
ers' songs and adds her own twists and per
sonality.
"No More 'I Love You's' " is bittersweet, a
cheerful melody intertwined with devastat
ingly disconsolate lyrics, as is "Downtown
Lights," (originally by the Blue Nile).
"Don't Let It Bring You Down," (from
Neil Young) is stunningly beautiful, with
Lennox stretching her voice to the edges of
one's imagination. And with "Take Me to the
River" (Al Green) and "Thin Line Between
Love and Hate" (Blue Nile), Lennox express
es an hypnotic female ferocity. Similar to
"Would I Lie to You," the two songs evoke
both pain and strength.
Altogether, "Medusa" is absolutely entic
ing. "Train in Vain" (the Clash) and"I Can't
Get Next to You" (the Temptations) are
catchy enough that, without cautious listen
ing, they are likely to end up stuck in your
head. Even the weakest songs on the album
aren't the type you skip through.
Annie Lennox possesses one of the most
potent and elegant voices in current music,
and she continues to establish herself as a
wonderfully artistic diva on "Medusa." She
is correct when she sings "I could turn a
river into a raging fire. ... 1 could make the
seasons change with just a wave of my
hand."
