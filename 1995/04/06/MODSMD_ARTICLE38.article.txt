catcd to representin' the home turf as it is to
lovin' on the ladies. Still, you have to won
der about the sincerity of an artist who tai
lors his songs to specific radio stations in
exchange for extensive air play. But this is
exactly how Montell Jordan does it.
Over the airwaves, a large section of Jor
dan's title track hit is devoted to giving
shouts out to various DJs and radio shows.
By substituting proper nouns and rearrang
ing a few rhymes, he insures that all regions
get their own custom-made version of the
track. The drawback of this commercial
strategy is that the song is easily mistaken
for a local radio station promo.
But it only takes a quick foray beyond the
album's title track to discover that quality is
often subordinated to commercialism. The
album is a mish-mash of pop, R&B and hip
hop that never settles confidently into any
single genre. As song after song rolls by, we

hear the voice of Teddy Riley and musical
influences from Alexander O'Neil and Big
Daddy Kane to 2Pac. Problem is, all these
cats have done it much, much better.
This musical mediocrity is compounded
by the fact that Jordan has literally nothing
to say. Bookended by a ghetto-testifying
"My Mommy Intro," and a gospel-inflected
"Daddy's Home," the album's lyrics trek
over the same tired terrain, suggesting that
Jordan's imagination has been far surpassed
by the album's budget.
Take "I Wanna." This title is short for "1
wanna get laid," a sentiment which Jordan
repeats continually during the song. Then
we get "Down On My Knees" — a real
show-stopper. With lyrics like "I'll go
down / I'll do all the things that you want
me to / all the things that your man won't
do" and, better still "let me kiss you
around / 'til that kitty starts to gimme that
sweet, sweet sound," Jordan cheapens the
very experience he is trying to celebrate.
Perhaps we should all be grateful that
bitches and blunts aren't a primary preoc
cupation for this Wcstside boy. Neverthe
less, the occasional hoochie is required so
that we all recognize that Jordan is very
down with that G thang and consequently
"won't be played." Oh no. He'll "rip that,
smack that, hit that ass," before going out
like that.
