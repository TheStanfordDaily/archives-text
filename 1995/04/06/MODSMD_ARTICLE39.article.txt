# Remembering McLachlan makes for concert dreams
## 
### 
So it's been six months since the hit
track "Possession" has been in heavy rota
tion on even' modern rock station in the
Bay Area. You've wandered down your
dorm's halls only to be greeted by "Good
Enough" wafting from one room while the
Live 105 hags groove to "Circle." When
someone mentions the Sarah McLachlan

"Fumbling Towards
Ectasy"
Sarah McLachlan

concert you still say, H Sarah who?"
Well, no worries. There's ample time to
salvage some semblance of music-lore
kewl. But before you rush out to Block
buster Musk and play catch-up, here's a
handy synopsis of McLachlan's third effort,
"Fumbling Towards Ecstacy.*
Her mellow sound, reminiscent of Tori
Amos' work sans the melodic quirks, lulls
the listener with its lilting harmonies and
medium tempo, Mclachlans whispery vo
cals glide up and down the scale like frost
ing on a freshly cooled cake. Her tone is $o

gentle, you'd swear she was sharing inti
mate secrets with a good friend.
In pcrfect accompaniment, other in
struments (piano, guitar, bass, et cetera)
have been tempered, avoiding a possible
clash with McLachlan's soothing voice. Yet
they too have their power. In 'Plenty," a
groovy bassline underscores synthesized
keyboard wind, adding a modern edge to
an other-worldly tune.
Perhaps the most unobtrusive, the
drum machine in "Good Enough'" softly
keeps time as barely noticeable piano
chords slip in and out. At the same time,
the guitar quietly grinds out a solo suggest
ing an insistent rage aching to burst forth
and scold the track's distrustful lovers.
Along those lines, McLachlan s lyrics re
veal a tougher side of the songs than the
music insinuates. "Good Enough" depicts
cynics gradually discovering the strength to
open up again. She sings, 4< l never would
have opened up / but you seemed so real to
me / After all the bullshit I've heard / its
refreshing not to see"
Overall, McLachlans music is simple
but piercing. In two words: good stuff.
