# Guided by Voices brilliant in its confusion

### 
With all the critical acclaim surrounding last year's
irresistible "Bee Thousand," Ohio's Guided by Voices
could easily have hit it big with another record from
that same Beatlesesque mold.
If that was their goal, they've failed with "Alien
Lanes." More likely, however, is that Robert Pollard
and company simply opted for a bolder and grittier
approach — one that would drag fans' imaginations
on a bumpy ride through the mud and the clouds that
the band calls home.
Spitting out 28 songs in 41 minutes, "Alien
Lanes" is choppy and quick, leaving you to grapple
with its ragged lack of structure and coherence. The
overall impression is confusing and pleasantly over
whelming— as appealing as ever but in a not-so-ob
vious way.
Frontman Robert Pollard remains one of the
world's greatest and most puzzling pop songwriters.
Straight from the top of his head, his lyrics drift from
honestly profound ("You could never be strong / you
can only be free") to sadly hopeful ("And the hellfire is
dying around you my love") to ridiculously scrambled
("Post-punk X-Man parked his fork-lift / Like a bil

lion stars flickering from the grinder's wheel"). Pol
lard allows his mind to wander freely so that yours will
do the same.
Songs like "Blimps Go 90," "My Valuable Hunting
Knife" and "As We Go Up, We Go Down" rank among
GBV's catchiest yet. "Game of Pricks" jabs and hooks

with genuine
sweetness, while
"Chicken
Blows" sounds
like GBV's
soothing stroll

"Alien Lanes"
Guided by Voices

down the Beatles' "Long and Winding Road."
But the album's prettiest tracks are complemented
by dirty and freakish songs like "Pimple Zoo" or "Al
ways Crush Me," which are equally engaging in a less
pop-y way, recalling the jagged, hairy sound of GBV's
"Grand Hour" EP.
From start to finish, "Alien Lanes" is shaky and un
balanced, and that's a big part of what makes it bril
liant. It's too slippery to ever pin down, but you can at
least have a great time trying.
