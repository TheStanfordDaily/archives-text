# The 						6ths' 'Wasps' Nest' is an indie-pop dream team

If there is such a thing as an indie-pop
Dream Team, it might go something like the

somewhere, pinch hit with New Zealand
wonder Chris Knox and Mac Superchunk
from the bench and this is probably the best
squad playing the game.
Instead, the 6ths is the supergroup that
isn't, more a solo deal of the Magnetic Fields'
Stephin Mcrritt than anything else. Carried

out by Merritt with a little help from his
friends, "Wasps' Nest" resembles one long
song broken up into 15 parts by the 15
singers. Track after track, the basic recipe
stays the same: Beside the jilted love vocals,
with their vivid images of light green lipstick
and pink lemonade done up by the special
guest stars, Merritt's lush synthesizer-fueled
pop glistens and glimmers like music made
by playing with a chandelier.
Despite the near monotonous composi
tion of the tunes, the album doesn't wear
thin because the gimmick works. All that
glitters shines thanks to the fresh twists the
singers make on the common plot: The

buoyant, precious pieces of "Wasps' Nests"
are guided by the voices. From the deep,
downbeat drone of Merritts own singing to
the Heavenly croon of Amelia Fletcher on
frenetic "Looking for Love," it's a treat to lis
ten to what the talented vocalists do with
their cuts.
Besides the staggering all-star roster,
"Wasps' Nest" serves up few surprises and
works because of it; The faves deliver in a way
their fans have come to expect. Manning is as
charming as ever on the humorously blue
"San Diego Zoo" and Timony emotes with

Dreams." R.E.M. producer Mitch Easter de-

livers as well, making "Pillow Fight" stand
out with its distant vocals and screechy gui
tar accompaniment. Easter's instrumental
supplement breaks out of the formula nicely,
fitting in with the brisk arrangement rather
than overpowering or distracting from it.
Although "Wasps' Nest" isn't the be-all
and end-all of side projects, it is a strong col
lection of nice voices and pretty sounds. But,
then again, who would expect any less?
