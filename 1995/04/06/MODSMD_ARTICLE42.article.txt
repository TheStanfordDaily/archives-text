# '100% Fun' is a sweet pleasure
## 
### 
Matthew Sweet is an artist full of contradic
tions. His lyrics are consistently dark and
brooding but his voice is so appealing and up
beat that fitting the two together is difficult.
Furthermore, although his heart seems to be in
straightforward rock, his use of steel guitar
makes his dedication questionable.
At best, Sweet is an original maverick forc
ing the listener to accept the music on his
terms, or not at all. Not an artist of excesses,
Sweet possesses an impressive control over his
ambitions. His music remains focused and
rarely extends itself past its natural limits.
With his sixth solo release, "100% Fun,"
Sweet has produced his most accessible album
yet. Instead of experimenting further as he did
on "Altered Beast," Sweet has chosen to return
to the successful formula of "Girlfriend."
The songs are short and tight, with appro
priately simple melodies. The singing is subtle
and well-mannered, with some beautiful har
mony lines.

The album opener, "Sick Of Myself," is a
great example of Sweet's new concentration. It
contains an undeniably appealing guitar hook
and moves along at an assertive pace, which
combines stinging guitar and sweet vocals to
form a perfectly crafted pop song.
Many other tracks display his more artistic
side. On "Lost My Mind," Sweet melds cascad-

ing drums with flowing, brooding lyrics to
form a sum much greater than its parts. The
song creates a hypnotic atmosphere which in
vites the listener to disappear within the waves
of the music.
Overall, however, the album does suffer
from too few musical and emotional changes.
Many of the songs can blur together, and be
cause Sweet has a naturally droning voice, the
feel of much of the album is the same.
Songs such as "Smog Moon" are proof that
Sweet can overcome this problem. Containing
Sweet's most affected singing "Smog Moon"
also possesses an emotional progression which
creates the album's most impressive moment.
Thus, while "100% Fun" is a worthy
achievement for Sweet, it also contains blue
prints for making even greater works in the fu
ture.
