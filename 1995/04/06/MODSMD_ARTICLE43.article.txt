# Sugar Ray's 'Lemonade and Brownies' is unsavory mixed-up thrash metal
## 
### 
Sometimes, a crazy schizophrenic band
comes along and tries to destroy musical
categories for the sake of being different.
Usually these bands either gather a cult fol
lowing or simply vanish from the pages of
musical history. Sugar Ray, with its pre
mier album, "Lemonade and Brownies,"
tries to achieve musical notoriety with its
spirit of casual irreverence in the genres of
thrash metal, rap and soul.
With the first pop into the stereo,
"Lemonade and Brownies" left me with
mixed feelings. From listening to its music,
it is hard to tell exactly where Sugar Ray's
musical allegiances are. The album leans
more heavily towards the thrash
metal / heavy metal side, with characteris
tically energetic power chords grinding to
the rhythm of similarly agitated drums
and vocals. However, there are smatterings
of Beastie Boys style punk / rap, Motown
style soul and Aerosmithesque rhythm
guitar that muddle rather than focus the
Sugar Ray persona.
Some of the band's best efforts are the
tracks "Hold Your Eyes," "10 Seconds
Down," "Danzig Needs a Hug" and "Ca
boose." Unfortunately, these are, at best,
generic songs that make the whole album

incoherent. "Hold Your Eyes" butters up
the musical ear with an in-the-pocket
groove that could serve well as the sound
track to some cheap-budget movie. "10
Seconds Down" fringes on punk but does
not quite make it.

Brownies"
Sugar Ray

Hard-core fans of bands like Fuga/.i or
NOFX or the Misfits would probably
chuckle at Sugar Kay's good but unsuc
cessful effort. "Danzig Needs a Hug"
shines as another gem of Sugar Ray's po
tential with a smooth, cold-filtered soul
accompaniment to some off-kilter lyrics.
While "Caboose" could use some poetic
help with its lyrics, it shows that Sugar Ray
can slam like Aerosmith or Guns 'n' Roses.
With hope, Sugar Ray will refine its mu
sical ideas and clarify what exactly it is try
ing to accomplish. Now, listening to Sugar
Ray is like listening to spilled marbles:
Each marble goes every which way and you
don't know which one to pick up first.
