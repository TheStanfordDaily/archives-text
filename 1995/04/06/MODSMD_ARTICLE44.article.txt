## 'Jefferson in Paris' can't design away contradiction 
### 
Architect of American democracy or un
apologetic Southern slave-holder? Devoted
husband or reckless lecher? By most ac
counts, Thomas Jefferson must rank as one
of the most enigmatic of figures in U.S. po
litical history. Yet producer Ismail Merchant

Jefferson in Paris

and director James Ivory's epic 145-minute
excursion to the world of exquisite 18th
century French fashions and aristocratic
manners fails to illuminate the man's inner
most ghosts and the self-contradictory as
pects of a complex personality.
Set in the years 1784 to 1789 in Paris,
Lafayette and Versailles where Jefferson
(Nick Nolte) had served as the U.S. ambas
sador to the Louis XVI court, the film cele
brates the libertarian ideals of the widowed
author of the Declaration of Independence.
Among his fawning French audience, Jeffer

son pays particular at
tention to a ravishing hut married woman,
Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), although he
later finds himself drawn instead to his 15-
year-old slave Sally Hemings (Thandie
Newton).
One comes away from Merchant-Ivory's
latest outing — and their first for Touch
stone Pictures — with not so much emo
tional engagement or psychological chal
lenge hut rather images over-saturated with
the artifice of set and costume design which
places a disproportionate demand on the
production's energies, leaving its character
izations pitifully malnourished.
Whatever one has no time to say proper
ly should not be said at all, but screenwriter
Ruth Prawer Jahbvala clearly thinks other
wise. During the film's later stages, one par
ticular announcement over dinner of Guil
lotine's notorious invention leaves one
scratching one's head about its contextual
significance, other than its obvious role as a
self-congratulatory billboard for parading
historical detail. The French revolution
backdrop is likewise mostly reduced to

newsreel-style asides made by Jefferson's
cronies over parlor games and garden par
ties.
Despite one saving grace in the intricate
ly-etched figure of Jefferson's willful daugh
ter Patsy (Gwyneth Paltrow) — who shares

a curiously intimate relationship with her
father — it is apparent that the Disneyfica
tion of Merchant-Ivory's heritage act has
taken out a whole lot of subtle candor and
replaced it with an endless parade of
fctishized pomp.
