# 'Muriel's Wedding' absurd, worthwhile and crazy enough to be like real life
## 
### 
I have sworn to an Australian friend that I will begin this review with
a disclaimer: "Muriel's Wedding" (directed by P.J. Hogan) and all char
acters therein are not representative of Australia at large. Anyway, the
figures — simple human frames piled high with traits too universal to
represent one person or place — are too exaggerated to be realistic.
This movie is not a slice of life. But it is a slice of something.
Muriel Heslop (Toni Collette) is this plain, overweight girl who
doesn't dress right and doesn't have any real friends and lives with her
dowdy family in this tacky house in this tacky little town called Porpoise
Spit. Muriel wants to get married, which she figures will prove she's a
"success" like the pretty, popular girls from her old high school who
seem to have everything she's ever wanted.
1 kept thinking she was about to be transformed like Ally Sheedy in
"The Breakfast Club" — rehabilitated and ready to rejoin society. She'd
get thin and be beautiful and somebody would fall in love with her and
popular girls would ask her to be in their club and she'd win. Consider
ing who Muriel wants to be like — the 20-something "girls" who keep

Muriel's
Wedding

forgetting that high
school was last week —
her goal doesn't seem
like much of a victory.
But don't worry: Muriel
wins.
Muriel is a great

character. You're rooting for her. You care about what happens to her
and enjoy watching her throw out the petty standards that had op
pressed her; when she learns some self-respect, it strikes a chord. Every
body has to learn that appearances don't have much to do with happi
ness. Muriel triumphs over her Barbie-doll oppressors in the best pos
sible way: She learns that they have no power over her. She is every out
sider, and thus everyman.
The movie is sincere enough to be worthwhile, even if it weren't such
a scream. Like life, it is absurd, crazy and worthy of the utmost atten
tion. And yes, she does get a wedding, too.
