# 'Claiborne' psychological horror rings true
## 
### 
The best horror movies aren't those filled with
blood and gore but ones that are psychologically
frightening. "Dolores Claiborne," the new thriller
based on the novel by Stephen King, succeeds in ter
rifying the viewer with a complex psychological por-

Dolores
Claiborne

trayal of the heroine, Dolores (Kathy Bates).
Dolores Claiborne is a middle-aged, stubborn
housemaid in a seaside Maine town. A life spent
washing dishes, doing laundry and catering to the ec
centric needs of her mean-spirited employer, Vera
Donner, leaves Dolores as rough and pessimistic as a
Maine winter.
The film opens with the final scuffle between Do
lores and Vera. Within minutes, a bloody Vera mur
murs "Please Dolores" as she lies crumpled at the bot
tom of the stairs. Meanwhile, Dolores hovers suspi
ciously over Vera with a rolling pin aimed at her head.
At that moment the mailman arrives and witnesses
the scene. Things definitely don't look good for Do
lores.
But wait... there's more. It turns out that this isn't
the first mysterious death linked to Dolores. Her hus
band, played by David Strathairn in a series of flash
backs, also died years ago under puzzling circum
stances.
The newsofVera's death reaches Dolores' daughter
(Jennifer Jason Leigh) a high-powered, edgy New
York journalist who reluctantly returns to Maine to
aid her mother. The remainder of the movie is spent

discovering what really happened to Vera Donner and
Mr. Claiborne.
The tense interaction between Bates and Leigh is
the highlight of the film. Dolores scoffs at the critical
comments and jeers of othefs, remarking "Sometimes,
being a bitch is all a woman has to hold on to." Dolores
epitomizes the survivor with her raw, bleeding hands
that continue to perform the monotonous yet de
manding tasks of Vera Donner. Leigh, meanwhile,

portrays the edgy victim who still harbors secret pangs
of guilt and anger about her father's death. Their in
evitable confrontation marks the climax in the movie.
The shocking ending sheds new light on the char
acters' motivations and proves that true horror
movies don't involve dead guys in goofy hockey
masks.
