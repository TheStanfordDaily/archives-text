# Isaiah's losing ending
## 
### 
The plot of "Losing Isaiah" sounds like a
possible script for the latest made-for-TV
movie: Mom addicted to crack dumps baby in
trash, baby miraculously survives, social work
er falls in love with baby and adopts him, newly
reformed biological mother discovers baby
lives and demands custody. "Losing Isaiah"
rises above those average television plots, how
ever, with strong performances and a racial
twist that questions the issue of motherhood.

Halle Berry stars as
an African-American
mother named Kailah
who mistakenly leaves
her baby in a dump
ster when she is high
on crack. After spend
ing a couple of years

Losing
Isaiah

in prison for shoplifting and cocaine posses
sion, Kailah emerges, haunted by the guilt of
her baby's supposed death.
Only after discovering that her child still
lives does she resolve to completely reform and
gain custody of her son, Isaiah, played by
adorable newcomer Marc John Jeffries. Isaiah,
meanwhile, lives happily with a white social
worker named Margaret Lewin (Jessica Lange)

and her®
family, and'
they are deter
mined to fight

the ensuing custody battle.
The movie revolves primarily around the
trial and the nasty confrontations that result as
tensions mount and the propriety of interracial
adoptions comes into question. Kailah's case
hinges predominately on her belief that biolog
ical rights precede those of love.
"Losing Isaiah" captures the viewer's inter
est with great performances by Lange, who
seems overworked and tense throughout, and
Berry, who successfully portrays a woman
struggling to rebuild her life. The irony of the
film lies in the character similarities between
Margaret and Kailah and their forced legal op
position towards each other.
The movie fails, though, with banal lines
like, "Look in the mirror. I'm his mother. God
says so." In addition, the contrived ending
seems unrealistic after the previous conflicts
between Lange and Berry. With a plot like this
one can't help but wonder if this isn't a TV
movie after all.
