# 'Bye Bye Love' has real heart
## 
### 
"Bye Bye Love" is an entertaining snack of
a movie. Nothing too substantial — but a
pleasant way to spend two hours; lots of good
stuff and nothing bad.
The story revolves around a trio of best
friends who are all divorced dads (Matthew
Modine, Randy Quaid and Paul Reiser) as
each tries to be a part of his kids' lives even

Bye Bye Love

though they are no longer a full-time family.
The movie follows a typical weekend from
McDonald's pick-up on Friday to McDon
ald's drop-off on Sunday night (meetings
with their ex-wives, like hostage exchanges,
are apparently best done on neutral ground).
Mild adventures — the highlight of which

is a hellish blind date between Randy Quaid
and Janeane Garofalo of "Reality Bites" —
ensue. The three dads come to grips with
their new roles as full-time fathers in part
time families.
The comedy / sentiment formula is a fa
miliar one but it's rarely done this well. The
jokes are funny and the sentiment rings true.
The characters are a tad exaggerated but not
stereotypical, and all the acting is solid. They
hit everything: The guy who can't reach his
daughter; the guy who can't get along with
his ex; the guy who can't get on with his life.
We've seen it all before — maybe because
it's stuff that actually happens. "Bye Bye
Love" seems genuine. Deft handling of famil
iar situations evokes sympathy for these typ
ical guys who seem to have typical problems.
Nothing groundbreaking, but good stuff.
1 doubt you'll hear of "Bye Bye Love" next
Oscar season, but it may be in the running for
"feel-good movie of the year."
