# 'Circle' delights from end to end

Focusing on the intertwining lives of three
Irish women attending college in Dublin,
"Circle of Friends" offers an intriguing look
at late 1950s Ireland and the strong influence
the Catholic Church had over daily life.
After spending their childhood years in a
boring small town, Benny (Minnie Driver)
and her friend Eve (Geraldine O'Rawe) are

Circle of Friends

eager to experience the grown-up pleasures
of university and city life. On their first day of
school, the pair bumps into childhood friend
Nan (Saffron Burrows), who — after moving
to Dublin with her family several years be
fore — has become quite the socialite.
Although Benny, the "plain Jane" of the
group, has to take the bus from home while
her friends get to live in Dublin, the trio still
stays close as they search for true love. While
Nan pursues an older non-Catholic man,
Benny starts to develop a relationship with

lack (Chris O'Donnell), the handsome star
of the college rugby team.
Benny's low self-confidence and their
common fear of the Church, however, keep
the couple from consummating their rela
tionship, which starts to deteriorate after
Benny's father dies and she has to spend
more time with her mother at home. Left
alone in Dublin, Jack starts to stray, which
eventually puts him in a difficult bind — the
prospect of marrying a girl he doesn't love.
O'Donnell turns in a good performance
as the popular guy who values Benny's
warmth and honesty over other girls' good
looks. Still, actress Minnie Driver truly steals
the show in "Circle of Friends." Her inspired
performance as the headstrong — yet still
tender — Benny should give Driver a lot of
offers to choose from in the future.
Still, "Circle of Friends" is not perfect. We
are not told what happens to Nan, the only
tragic character in the film. By avoiding her
predicament, the movie is able to end on a
high note with its positive theme intact: True
love will survive any obstacle — even the
stringent Catholic Church.
