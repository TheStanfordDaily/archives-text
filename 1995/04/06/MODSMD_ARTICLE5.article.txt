# Ex-Bookstore heads plan new corporation
## Former managers, still facing criminal charges, trying to establish "superacademic bookstore" 
### Hussein Kanji Brian Singer Staff writers 
Two former Stanford Bookstore offi
cials, currently facing charges of grand
theft and tax evasion for their activities
while at the University, are attempting to
establish a Southern California bookstore
corporation that could replace existing
major college bookstores in the region.
Eldon Speed, who resigned as manager
of the Bookstore in February 1992, would
be chief executive officer of this corpora
tion, said Donald Queen, director of the
University Corporation, which manages
the Cal State-Northridge bookstore. Speed
said his future job is still undecided.
Speed's proposal, which he terms a "su
peracademic bookstore," would be set up
by Cal State-Northridge and be analogous
to a corporation. A number of universities
would give money to the corporation in re
turn for books.
As a consultant for Cal State-North
ridge, Speed has contacted Philip Chiara
monte, his former colleague at the Book
store and now the director of the USC
bookstore, to establish the corporation.
Chiaramonte was charged March 15

with six counts of grand theft and two
counts of tax evasion. Speed is charged with
five counts of grand theft and two counts of
tax evasion. Both have pleaded not guilty to

all charges and, if convict
ed, face a maximum of
eight years in prison.
Speed's proposal would
create a central bookstore
inventory corporation. The
number of books which
member universities could
access would be directly re
lated to their investment in
the corporation.

The idea has also been proposed to UC-
Irvine, UCLA and Cal State campuses at
Fullerton, Long Beach and Pomona.
According to Queen, the bookstore cor
poration is the only way to "solve the prob
lems of sales volume and inventory going
down" at Northridge.
He added that other private corpora
tions such as Crown Books are already set
ting up these superstores and taking busi
ness away from campus stores.
Queen said he is not concerned about
the criminal charges that were brought


Speed
against Speed. "At this point there
will be no effect," Queen said. "He
will continue as he has in the past."
"I would say that the charges
that are being brought... there is
not any substance to them," said
Jerry Olson, director of Titan
Shops, which manages the book

store at Cal State-Fullerton.
Currently, Queen said, Speed is
working for free with Cal State-
Northridge on the project,
although he is being considered for
the position of project director.
Queen added that Speed was only
hired to help an inexperienced
bookstore manager learn his job.
Speed, however, said he is being
paid at around "a third to half
time" by Cal State-Northridge to

work on the bookstore corporation.
Speed's contract expired as an
inner manager at the Utah State
University bookstore last Friday,
two weeks after he turned himself
in to Santa Clara County authori
ties in San Jose. He was released
on his own recognizance.
However, Speed said he was not
interested in keeping the Utah job.
"They are looking for a permanent
manager and they were interested

in having me in that job but I wasn't
interested," he said Tuesday.
Speed resigned as manager of
the Stanford Bookstore after a
Feb. 5, 1992, article in The Daily
revealed that senior managers at
the Bookstore were receiving perks
unheard of at other university
bookstores, including the use of
company cars and a vacation home.
In a January civil suit settle
ment, Speed, Chiaramonte and for

mer Bookstore employee Patrick
McDonald — also charged with
grand theft and tax evasion — paid
approximately $1 million from
their insurance policies to the
Bookstore and the state of Califor
nia. They also returned ownership
of the vacation house to the Book
store.
Chiaramonte did not return
repeated phone calls from The
Daily yesterday.
