Exotica
"Exotica," Atom Egoyan's new
thriller, meditates on themes of jeal
ousy, guilt and alienation by housing
them within the context of the exotic.
Club Exotica is a dark underworld
where erotic music plays, beautiful
naked women dance and wealthy
men watch.
Zoe (Arsinee Khanjian), the preg
nant owner of Exotica, Eric (Elias
Koteas), its alienated MC and Fran
cis (Bruce Greenwood), a tormented
tax collector, all orbit around the elu
sive Christina (Mia Kirshner), a
school girl-turned-stripper in a fasci
nating constellation of relationships.
While male characters are fully ex
plored, the female personalities re
mained little more than fully exposed
— naked with little humanity. Unfor
tunately, Christina, the ultimate ob
ject of desire, is left as an object. She
strips, she teases, she throws
tantrums and then repeats the cycle
anew. On the other hand, Eric, Fran
cis and even gay character Thomas
are all revealed through their interac
tions with her. But by the end of the

film you're left with the distinct im
pression that you've simply watched
the bodies of several naked women
and a few disturbed men.
Martha & Ethel
"Martha & Ethel" binds the many
elements of the theme of "the career
of being a woman" together — pho
tographs, past and present footage
of the subjects, newsreel clips, inter
views, music, a German storybook
— it is the experience of being a
woman, even more so than the ca
reer of being a nanny.
An aptly-timed visit by director Jyll
Johnstone to childhood friend Bar
bara Ettinger, currently a graduate
student at Stanford, catalyzed the
idea of chronicling the lives of their
respective nannies, Martha Kniefel
and Ethel Edwards. The result of five
years of research and production
turns out to be an intricate character
sketch of two families, of which
Martha and Ethel were and continue
to be very much a part.
"Martha & Ethel" offers an often
tender, often disturbing account of

two women who gave up lives and
families of their own to become
"mothers" and two women who
gave up being mothers for their re
sponsibilities to outside families.
The Sum of Us
Few would venture to call Harry
Mitchell (Jack Thompson) a regular
Aussie dad by any standards. His in
spirational words to his gay son Jeff
(Russell Crowe) serve as a beautiful
homage to his widowed mother, an
unapologetic "explorer" of sorts who
had shared the remaining 40 years
of her life with her lesbian compan
ion Mary.
Instead of fixating upon the exis
tential angst of its lavender hero, the
film elects to appoint a comically tol
erant patriarch as its flag-waving
spokesperson.
Screenwriter David Stevens
("Breaker Morant") and co-director
Kevin Dowling have wisely kept up
with their partnership, instrumental in
the off-Broadway success of "The
Sum of Us" which was originally an
intimate father-son play where, like

the film, gay male mythology is ex
ploded with a bang and the good
ness of life shines through.
Window to Paris
In a St. Petersburg apartment,
Russian tenants find a magical win
dow which allows them to teleport
Star Trek-like to the cate-lined streets
of Paris. The movie illustrates a con
flict between money-grubbing wish
es and cultural exchange.
Director Yuri Mamin explores the
possibilities presented by a surreal
gateway connecting two disparate
cities. Characters like Nikolai (Sergei
Donstov), an out-of-place aesthetics
teacher in a business high school,
are transformed by their travels.
But the end, when the window
closes, the Russians choose to re
turn home and improve Russia in
order to leave behind Paris' superfi
ciality.
The film's ending, when another
magical window is discovered,
makes the movie fall where it other
wise gloriously succeeded.
