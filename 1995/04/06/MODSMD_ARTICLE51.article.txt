## Julie Tsai An ugly reincarnation of the teenage girl

"Your sister's on the phone."
As my roommate handed me the receiver
for this unexpected weekday call, I anticipat
ed dire news of idiot boyfriends, unsympa
thetic teachers or a sick and vomiting pet dog.
"I never realized how much this meant to
me," my 16-year-old sister lamented. "But
Sass/s changed."
"You called me long-distance from Chica
go about a teenybopper magazine?" I asked in
disbelief.
"They wiped out the entire editorial staff."
As I tried to console her with the prospect
of graduating full-time to Vogue, Harper's
Bazaar and other lovely mind-numbing pub
lications, I wondered to myself how bad it
could be. Sassy targets a particular population
of the teenage girl market with its under
ground-leaning entertainment tests, feminist
diatribe and a refreshingly caustic writing
style. How much profit could some big bad

publisher make from realigning the editorial
content to the genre standard of boys-make
up-sex? Who would even bother?
But indeed, when I next had the chance to
browse through the magazine racks, I per
ceived a not-so-subtle, insidious change.
"Make him look twice." "Shop, shop ...
can you stop?" "When to say yes to sex." "EAT
OUT don't pig out."
Inside it got just worse and worse. Gone
were the quirky and attitudinal fashion mod
els and the witty editorial touches. Gone was
any semblance of the beloved knee-jerk liber
alism. Instead were pages and pages of vacu
ous stories, headlines and models' faces. It
was even reminiscent of icky fluorescent pink
Teen magazine.
This was not anything close to the same
magazine that had been "co-opting your cul
ture since 1988." That issue included a satire
on "she-woman tactics" recommended for

Man-catching by more stodgy publications
YM and Cosmopolitan, a story on teenage
mothers, and a cake recipe from a Beastie Boy.
Inanity suffused with subtle intelligence. This
new Sassy would never have thought of any
thing like that, though.
Clearly having too much time on my
hands, I dug deeper.
It turned out the old publisher — Lang
Communications who also used to do Ms. —
had gone bankrupt. Coincidentally enough,
the new owner, Petersen Publishing, also pro
duces Teen.
Though repeated echoes of Susan Faludi's
prophesied backlash swirled through my
head, I tried to keep things in perspective.
After all this is only some stupid teenage
girl publication, right? But this is also the
same machine that keeps feeding impression
able young minds with an endless junk info
diet of malls, boy obsessions and body image

problems. Truly a formula for cultivating
greatness in one-half of the country's popula
tion.
Catharine Ettlinger, Sassy's new editorial
director, said simply, "maybe it was just time
for a change." While I'm not sure what that
meant, she did add that in the future months
the magazine would try to revive its edginess
to appeal to Sassy's original audience. "It will
be progressive," she promised, "but not gratu
itously provocative."
Sorry, but I can't help but be skeptical
given what's come out in the months since Pe
tersen took over. Besides, gratuitousness was
what the old magazine was all about: what a
lot of young girls need is to be encouraged to
be assertive, not more lessons on how to look
and act well-behaved.
And I admit that I'm a fashion magazine
junkie. But hey, what am I but a product of
my environment and its culture?
