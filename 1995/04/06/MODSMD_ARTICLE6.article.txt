# No initiative?
## Core Alliance proposal could be denied from ballot 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
The Student Rights Initiative — the
centerpiece of the Students' Alliance plat
form — may be ruled ineligible for the
spring election if ASSU Elections Commis
sioner Jonathan Berent decides that the
proposal's method of introduction doesn't
fulfill the ASSU Constitution.
In response to this potential threat, Al
liance members requested that the Council
of Presidents call a special senate meeting
today to discuss the issue.
The initiative consists of two parts: a set
of advisory questions to be put on the ballot
and four amendments which would consti
tutionalize the right of fee refunds, expand
the pre-existing freedom of information
act, make it easier for senators to put refer
enda on the spring ballot, and create a judi
cial branch of the ASSU Senate.
Two potential problems, however, exist
with the initiative — it may not have gone

through the constitutionally mandated no
tification process and it may not have re
ceived enough signatures to put both parts

on the ballot.
Berent said he would
rule on the issue by to
morrow.
"The constitution
specifies that an amend
ment must be submitted

to the senate chair, who presents it to the
senate for a vote," said Senate Chair
Nawwar Kasrawi. "If the senate does not
act on the amendment, petitions may be
circulated, which are due within 21 days of
the election."
Kasrawi said he did not see the text of
the initiative before the deadline. However,
Alliance members claim that Kasrawi had
seen the amendments.
According to Alliance co-chair and sen
ate candidate Andr6 Vanier, Kasrawi was

asked by Alliance members to
sign the petition to put the ini
tiative on the ballot.
"On March 13, I was getting
signatures for the Student
Rights Initiative in the Man
zanita dining hall," said
Alliance senate candidate Marci
Reichbach. "I went to Nawwar's
table and explained the four
points, circulated the petition
and asked him to sign it. He
refused."
Kasrawi said he could not
recall the event, but in any case
does not believe that asking for
his signature on a petition
would "constitute fulfillment of
the [constitutional] require
ments."
"Nawwar's either blind or
lying and I know he's not
blind," said Alliance candidate
and current undergraduate sen
ator Stephen Russell. "Copies of
the Student Rights Initiative
were strewn all over the office,
they were stuffed in the boxes,
and Students' Alliance present

ed it to him for his signature. If
we shoved it into Nawwar's face
and he closed his eyes, does that
mean that we did not present it
to him?"
Russell said Kasrawi's role as
the People's Platform campaign
coordinator was influencing his
conduct as senate chair.
"At every turn, Nawwar
claims he doesn't want to get
involved, but why then does he
persist in engaging in this form
of constitutional abuse?" Rus
sell said. "If Nawwar is going to
choose to involve himself and
manage the Platform campaign
. . . then he should step down as
senate chair."
Kasrawi said he sees no rea
son to step down as senate
chair.
The initiative is also being
challenged on the grounds that
it actually contains two sepa
rate provisions — which would
require 1,700 petition signa
tures, Vanier said. Only 850 sig
natures were collected, enough
for one provision.
Berent "is saying that we can
only have one on the ballot
because we did not get [enough
signatures]," Vanier said. "He

would rather have the advisory
referendum on the ballot, not
the constitutional amend
ments."
In response to the possibility
of a negative ruling by Berent,
Alliance members asked the
COP to schedule a special sen
ate meeting today.
"We wanted to call a special
meeting to make the senate go
on record in favor of or against
the Student Rights Initiative by
either voting to place it on the
ballot or by issuing an instruc
tion to the elections commis
sioner to place it on the ballot,"
Vanier said.
As of press time, no special
meeting had been scheduled.
Russell said he would be dis
appointed if Berent rules to
keep the initiative off the ballot.
"What is the People's Plat
form afraid of? The students
should have the right to decide
on the initiative," Russell said.
"More importantly, if it is taken
off the ballot, it will hurt the
students. If the Students'
Alliance is elected, it will do
everything in its power to make
sure the initiative comes back
into full force."
