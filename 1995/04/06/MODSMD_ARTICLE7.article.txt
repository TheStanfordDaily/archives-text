# Saving paper
## Class offers material only on Web 
### Elisabeth Morse Contributing writer 
Put away those inefficient, overstuffed three
ring binders — a class entirely without paper is no
longer just a virtual reality. This quarter, a new
course will, for the first time ever at Stanford,
make homework, syllabus and readings available
solely over the World Wide Web.
Industrial Engineering 275: Organization and
Information Systems, taught by Consulting Asst.
Prof, of Industrial Engineering and Engineering
Management Behnam Tabrizi and teaching assis
tant Jonathan Bachman, aims to "establish histo
ry by having a class on the Web," said Tabrizi.
The 50-person class, which does meet in person
five days a week, has its own Web page containing
information such as the names of the students in
the class, biographies of the guest lecturers, brief
summaries of each lecture, the day's San Jose
Mercury News and a picture of Redwood Hall, the
building in which the class is held.
"The nice thing about the Web is that we can
evolve," Tabrizi said. "Each time I want to make a
change, I don't have to give out a piece of paper. I
can just go in there and change it."
"I'm attracted to the amount of information
that is accessible just by sitting at your desk. I'm
excited about the potential and possibilities," said
graduate student Andre Williams, a member of
the class.
The enrollment is limited because the class "is
a bit experimental and we don't want it too large,"
Bachman said.
"My goal is to provide a sense of community for
the students," Tabrizi added.
The course — which was created by Tabrizi and
Bachman with the support of Industrial Engi
neering Chair James Jucker and Mechanical En
gineering Prof. James Adams — will focus on
what the World Wide Web can offer.
