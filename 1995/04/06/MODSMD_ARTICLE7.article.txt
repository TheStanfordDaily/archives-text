# Saving paper
## Class offers material only on Web 
### Elisabeth Morse Contributing writer 
Put away those inefficient, overstuffed three
ring binders — a class entirely without paper is no
longer just a virtual reality. This quarter, a new
course will, for the first time ever at Stanford,
make homework, syllabus and readings available
solely over the World Wide Web.
Industrial Engineering 275: Organization and
Information Systems, taught by Consulting Asst.
Prof, of Industrial Engineering and Engineering
Management Behnam Tabrizi and teaching assis
tant Jonathan Bachman, aims to "establish histo
ry by having a class on the Web," said Tabrizi.
The 50-person class, which does meet in person
five days a week, has its own Web page containing
information such as the names of the students in
the class, biographies of the guest lecturers, brief
summaries of each lecture, the day's San Jose
Mercury News and a picture of Redwood Hall, the
building in which the class is held.
"The nice thing about the Web is that we can
evolve," Tabrizi said. "Each time I want to make a
change, I don't have to give out a piece of paper. I
can just go in there and change it."
"I'm attracted to the amount of information
that is accessible just by sitting at your desk. I'm
excited about the potential and possibilities," said
graduate student Andre Williams, a member of
the class.
The enrollment is limited because the class "is
a bit experimental and we don't want it too large,"
Bachman said.
"My goal is to provide a sense of community for
the students," Tabrizi added.
The course — which was created by Tabrizi and
Bachman with the support of Industrial Engi
neering Chair James Jucker and Mechanical En
gineering Prof. James Adams — will focus on
what the World Wide Web can offer.
Students will be expected to
fully immerse themselves in
cyberspace, creating their own
home pages and participating in
team presentations.
The only drawback, Tabrizi
said, is that "once you get on the
Web, you have to be careful not
to turn into a Web-a-holic."
IE 275 does not require spe
cial funding, Bachman said. The
software to connect to the Web
only cost about $200 and Bach
man loaned the machinery used
to create the server.
The technology for the course
just became available last year,
and Tabrizi said he expects that
with rapidly advancing technol
ogy the course will change sub
stantially next year.
"In the future, I envision
that students will all come in
with their own [computer] note
books and communicate
through teleconferencing,"
Tabrizi said.
The class will address both
"managing in cyberspace" and

issues of corporate information
systems, he added.
"This course is not just about
learning technology but also
about finding out how the Web
is useful," Tabrizi said. "For the
first time in history, small busi
nesses have access to computers
and the net. The Web is also
useful for finding jobs."
"The big thing is that infor
mation technology is revolution
izing the way business is done,"
Williams said.
The Internet, Tabrizi said,
provides essential elements
missing from popular culture,
such as instant feedback of con
temporary issues and a building
of community.
Though the course is techno
logically oriented, it will also
deal with "people issues,"
Tabrizi said.
"I don't think not having a
computer science background is
a disadvantage," Williams
added.
In order to protect the priva
cy of students who have listed
personal information on their
Web pages, access to the
course's home page will be limit
ed to members of the class.
