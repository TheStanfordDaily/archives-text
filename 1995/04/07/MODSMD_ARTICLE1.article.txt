# Regulations threaten Stanford's independence

### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
From environmental regulations and
student aid to indirect costs for research,
the federal and state governments are in
volved with most aspects of Stanford and
other private universities.
Government intrusion in private insti
tutions is cause for concern, although aid
for research and student loans remains es
sential, says University President Gerhard
Casper.
Regulations directing the University's

actions abound and despite the federal gov
ernment's move toward decreased bureau
cracy, the future may contain even more
red tape, Casper said in a recent interview.
"I worry greatly about the future sur
vival of private universities," he said. "I'm
quite troubled by the government-universi
ty relationship."
When federal and state governments in
fringe on private universities' freedom to
set their own policies, Casper said, the pri
vate institutions are in danger of losing
both their distinction from public universi
ties and their excellence in comparison to

the rest of the world.
"On the whole, [American universities]
have been given a lot of autonomy by the
government," Casper said. "Since they are
competitive... there has been a lot of qual
ity produced.
"My worry is that American universities
will end up being more like their counter
parts elsewhere in the world ... under the
heavy hand of state and political pressure,"
he said.
The recent defeat of Stanford's speech
code, environmental regulations that limit
research and indirect-cost rules indicate

'I'm quite troubled
by the govern
ment-university
relationship.'

that governmental regulation may be the
biggest problem that universities will face
in the coming years, Casper said.

Red tape
In late March, Casper spent three days in
Washington, D.C., speaking with members
of Congress to try to save funding for stu
dent aid and university research.
Because "research is in the discretionary
part of the budget, I worry that as we go
through deficit reduction exercises, re
search will be hurt," Casper said. "[The
country] will not do the investment in the
future that research represents."
Much university research money comes

from the Department of Defense,
and with the new Republican
majority, the defense budget may
have more support.
"But we don't know what the
defense spending will go for,"
Casper said. "The good news is that
many members of the new majori
ty express support for basic
research."
The question of " 'whether the
money is where the mouth is'
remains to be answered," he said.
Environmental regulations can
often cause problems for research
universities, as they did for Stan
ford last September. The Universi
ty paid $2.65 million to settle a suit
brought by the California Environ
mental Protection Agency for
improper handling of hazardous
waste on campus.
"In some circumstances," said
Barbara Hirsch, government rela
tions director for the Association of
Higher Education Facilities Offi
cers, environmental regulations
"have a negative effect on research
universities."
But "there has been no spillover
from the debate on environmental
legislation," Casper said.
Along with the issue of basic
research, indirect costs — over

head costs of research that cannot
be attributed to a single project —
"continue to be the subject of a lot
of discussion," said Stanford Vice
Provost of Institutional Planning
Geoffrey Cox.
"There is talk about additional
changes in the whole structure of
indirect costs," said Cox. "Every
time there are changes, that cre
ates financial issues for us and we
have to adjust our way of defiling
with the government around those
changes.... It's difficult to know
how to plan given the uncertainty
of these issues."
New legislation often adds to
bureaucracy, Casper said, and
American leaders must decide "the
extent to which regulatory burdens
can be carried."
"What costs do we want to
impose on society to make small
gains?" he asked.
For example, further bureau
cracy might be added if the federal
government transfers student loan
programs to universities, Cox said.
"In some respects, there's a very
reliable system [for student aidl
where students receive money
through banks with certain guar
antees," Cox said. "Now there are
discussions about going to direct
student loans through universities.
"I think it's clearly the intention
of the new leaders in Congress to
reduce regulations," Cox added,
"but it's not clear yet whether
they'll succeed or whether by

changing programs they'll create
new regulations. It's sort of hard to
know what might go away and
what might be replaced."
Losing freedoms?
With more government inter
vention, private universities like
Stanford are "increasingly becom
ing like public institutions," Casper
said.
A good example, he said, is Cali
fornia's Leonard Law — a law that
extends First Amendment protec
tions to students at private univer
sities. In late February, a Santa
Clara County Superior Court judge
determined that Stanford's speech
code violates the Leonard Law.
"The state of California should
be wary of telling a private univer
sity what its educational policy
should be," Casper said. "What will
the state of California tell us next?
"I do not believe the Constitu
tion specifically protects academic
freedom either of public or private
institutions," said Casper, who spe
cializes in constitutional law. "We
have the same free speech rights
and the same freedom of associa
tion rights that any other citizen or
group of citizens has. I do not think
universities have special status."
Casper said, however, that the
"four essential freedoms" of uni
versities — freedom to determine
who teaches, what is taught, how it
is taught and who is admitted —
remain important.

"I do believe Stanford has asso
ciations! freedoms," he said. "The
mission of the University is incred
ibly delicate and fragile in ensuring
the freedom of learning.
"We have to permit people many
more freedoms than an industrial
corporation We are treated as
if we were a shopping center,"
Casper said.
Heavy government interfer
ence in universities began with
the McCarthy hearings in the
1950s and increased again during
the height of the free speech
movement at UC-Berkeley in the
19605.
Many issues raised during the
free speech movement reflected
concerns of the rest of the country
about freedoms, Casper said. But
the media focused on students and
"never since have we quite been
left alone," he added.
Universities are "also up against
the view that perhaps universities
in general, especially the best uni
versities in the country, are elitist,"
he said. "Well, of course we are eli
tist."
A university cannot maintain its
level of research "unless you have
very high standards," Casper said.
"We cannot make concessions on
our standards.
"It takes decades to build up an
institution such as Stanford and
only a few years to pull an institu
tion such as Stanford down," he
said.
