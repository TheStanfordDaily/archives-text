# Regulations threaten Stanford's independence

From environmental regulations and
student aid to indirect costs for research,
the federal and state governments are in
volved with most aspects of Stanford and
other private universities.
Government intrusion in private insti
tutions is cause for concern, although aid
for research and student loans remains es
sential, says University President Gerhard
Casper.
Regulations directing the University's

actions abound and despite the federal gov
ernment's move toward decreased bureau
cracy, the future may contain even more
red tape, Casper said in a recent interview.
"I worry greatly about the future sur
vival of private universities," he said. "I'm
quite troubled by the government-universi
ty relationship."
When federal and state governments in
fringe on private universities' freedom to
set their own policies, Casper said, the pri
vate institutions are in danger of losing
both their distinction from public universi
ties and their excellence in comparison to

the rest of the world.
"On the whole, [American universities]
have been given a lot of autonomy by the
government," Casper said. "Since they are
competitive... there has been a lot of qual
ity produced.
"My worry is that American universities
will end up being more like their counter
parts elsewhere in the world ... under the
heavy hand of state and political pressure,"
he said.
The recent defeat of Stanford's speech
code, environmental regulations that limit
research and indirect-cost rules indicate

ment-university
relationship.'

that governmental regulation may be the
biggest problem that universities will face
in the coming years, Casper said.

Red tape
In late March, Casper spent three days in
Washington, D.C., speaking with members
of Congress to try to save funding for stu
dent aid and university research.
Because "research is in the discretionary
part of the budget, I worry that as we go
through deficit reduction exercises, re
search will be hurt," Casper said. "[The
country] will not do the investment in the
future that research represents."
