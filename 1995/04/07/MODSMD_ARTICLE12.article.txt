# Senate cuts social spending

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Senate unanimous
ly approved a $16 billion package of cuts in social
programs late yesterday, giving the chamber's
Republicans a first victory in their promised year
long drive to whittle down federal spending.
On a 99-0 roll call, senators approved the mea
sure that Democrats had been stalling since last
week. The vote came after a compromise was
reached among Msuority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and the Clin
ton administration.
The vote allowed the Senate to begin its Easter
recess, joining the House in Congress' first long
break since the grueling legislative year began the
first week of January.
It also permitted leaders of both parties to declare
that they had achieved their priorities: deficit reduc
tion for Republicans and protection of some social
programs for Democrats.
Dole called the package "an important down pay
ment on deficit reduction." He knew the measure
was but a tiny fraction of the record $1.2 trillion in

savings Republicans will need to deliver their
promise of a balanced budget in seven years.
Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., was the only senator
who did not vote on final passage.
Under the deal, $835 million would be restored to
programs for children, housing and jobs that Repub
licans wanted to cut. In addition, more than $1.6 bil
lion would be trimmed from airport improvements,
rental assistance, federal administrative and travel
costs and other programs. Overall, the changes
boost the measure's deficit reduction by $812 mil
lion to about $16 billion.
In addition, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
agreed to drop an amendment he had offered that
would have halted the administration's $20 billion
rescue of the faltering Mexican peso.
The White House and Democrats vehemently
opposed the amendment, which they said would
have imperiled the Mexican economy and markets
the world over. D'Amato had said the bailout was
wasting taxpayers' money, but he dropped his effort
to let the spending-cuts package go through.
