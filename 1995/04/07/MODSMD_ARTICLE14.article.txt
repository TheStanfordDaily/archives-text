Expanding definition of
hate crimes will punish
actions towards groups

LAST YEAR, the hate-motivat
ed vandalism of George
Segal's "Gay Liberation"
sculpture revealed the unfortunate
reality that, even at Stanford,
homophobia is a problem. The inci
dent also revealed a shortcoming in
the California Penal Code. As part
of an effort to correct the larger
defect, several local legislators have
modestly set their sights on the
smaller one.
Existing California law provides
penalty enhancements for various
crimes when their commission was
motivated by a hatred of the victim
for reasons such as race, gender or
sexual orientation. Although the
Santa Clara County District Attor
ney's office felt the statue vandal
ism was hate-motivated, it could not
pursue a penalty enhancement
under the so-called "hate crime
statute" because the crime's victim
was an institution (Stanford) and
not a person.
Because the statute's original
drafters either overlooked or did not
anticipate a situation like the one on
campus last year, the hate crime
statute specifies that the crime in
question must be committed
against a person or his / her proper
ty. Since the statue belongs to Stan
ford and not an individual, the rule
was not applicable, and prosecutors
had to pursue simple vandalism
charges.
In February, Democratic Assem
blyman (and Stanford Law profes
sor) Byron Sher introduced Assem
bly Bill 1295 to rectify the problem.
The bill simply removes the require
ment that the property belong to a
person. Accordingly, any hate-moti
vated vandalism would be covered
by the revised law, regardless of who
(or which institution) owned the
property.
State Sen. Milton Marks (D-San
Francisco) has introduced a similar

measure, Senate Bill 911, in the leg
islature's upper house. Marks' bill
includes a provision which would
allow the governor to issue up to
$50,000 in rewards for unsolved
hate crimes. This provision was
prompted by the recent shooting of
Victor Rohana in San Francisco.
Rohana was murdered while hold
ing hands with his male partner, an
incident which is believed to have
been hate-motivated.
SB 911 was designed with the
help of Republican state Sen. Tom
Campbell, another Stanford Law
professor. Along with Marks and
state Sen. Diane Watson of Los
Angeles, Campbell is a member of
the Senate Subcommittee on Hate
Crimes.
Hate crimes against institutional
property are rare, and, according to
Senator Marks' office, approximate
ly 90 to 95 percent of them go
unsolved. Accordingly, neither mea
sure would greatly increase state
law enforcement costs (such as
prosecution and incarceration).
Similarly, even if the governor
decided to issue rewards on a regu
lar basis, it is likely that few would
be collected.
Nonetheless, both bills will have
to weather fiscal committees and
gain approval in a legislature
strapped for cash. There may a new
wrinkle as well: Sher's bill will be
one of the first gay rights votes for
newly-elected Assembly members,
half of whom are Republicans.
Hopefully, neither partisan politics
nor the legislature's newfound con
servative bend will slow these bills
down.
Both bills represent needed mod
ifications. More important, both
send the strong message that
hatred and bigotry will not be toler
ated. Neither bill will greatly miti
gate homophobia, but their symbol
ic importance cannot be overlooked.
It is unfortunate that those who
vandalized the "Gay Liberation"
statue could not receive the punish
ment they deserved. It will be even
more unfortunate if the legislature
fails to take the appropriate
response.
