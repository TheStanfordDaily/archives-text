University indirectly supports conservative agenda

IF THE DEPARTMENT of Political
Science or the Department of English
claimed credit for the "Contract With
America," rejoiced at last fall's Republi
can victory, admitted that only generally
conservative scholars "fit well" in the
department, ran an op-ed program that
placed hundreds of essays in the nation's
media and earned a national and interna
tional reputation as a leading conserva
tive think tank, would anyone at Stan
ford wonder what was going on?
We think the Stanford administration
would question the propriety of such
activities. We think Stanford students
would ask whether the informal but
effective political litmus test applied to
departmental appointments is the way to

recruit faculty in quality departments.
And we think such a department would
be a national disgrace.
In response to Hoover Institution
Director John Raisian's public acknowl
edgment of Hoover's political mission, we
recently requested that University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper appoint a nonparti
san review committee to explore the
question of severing ties between the
University and Hoover. President Casper
referred our letter to Raisian for a
response, saying that his "own position
about the University and politics is
clear." We wonder about this position,
especially in light of reports that money
for Stanford faculty early retirements
has been used to finance retirement buy

outs of Hoover fellows. If true, Stanford
is now directly contributing to Hoover's
political activities, which is a marked
departure from past support limited to
the Hoover Library and Archives.
By allowing the Hoover Institution to
continue as an autonomous think tank
connected to — and now partially sup
ported by — the University, President
Casper condones something he would
never accept as a regular part of the Uni
versity. By failing to grasp the distinction
between an independent think tank, ded
icated to promoting free enterprise capi
talism, and a department, Casper, The
Daily editorial backing Hoover and Cam
pus Report in quoting The Daily, help
perpetuate the myopia that sees nothing

particularly special about Hoover.
Yale recently returned a $20 million
gift from a donor who tried to control
faculty appointments in a new Western
civilization program. The Hoover Institu
tion solicits and spends millions of dol
lars to advance political causes, while the
Stanford administration and the Stan
ford community look the other way. If
Stanford really wishes to be considered
on a par with major eastern universities,
perhaps we need to weigh the costs of
associating with Hoover along with the
alleged benefits.
