## The 						disabled lead the race 
### 
CIVIL RIGHTS HAVE been doing
poorly, but lately disability rights
have fared well. The disability
rights movement has triumphed with
landmark legislation such as the Ameri
cans with Disabilities Act, which extend
ed anti-discrimination principles beyond
race to encompass disabilities.
As the black civil rights movement has
provided the moral authority and politi
cal example for other causes — with the
language and spirit of its reforms being
borrowed widely — so now the disability
rights movement may be able to return
the favor. Revolutionary concepts have
gained mainstream acceptance in the dis
ability context. These ideas can con
tribute to progress elsewhere.
We have transcended the moral belief
in disabilities as a divine and deserved
sign of an inner evil. We are evolving
from the medical model of disabilities as
behaviors and conditions to be treated
and cured. While the transition may
never be completed, post-modern cul
ture is coming to understand that dis
abilities are subjective and socially con
structed.
Disability rights activists have demon
strated that it is less the biologically
based disability than the socially
imposed handicap that creates "crip
ples." It is the prejudice, the internalized
shame and the artificial physical barriers
that must be overcome. Likewise, we may
look at race as an historical and ideologi

cal feature, rather than an inherited and
innate fact of life.
Disability rights have achieved
advances because the cause is universal.
As advocates are fond of pointing out, the
disabled are a minority group we can all
join. As average life expectancy rises,
with high-technology saving and improv
ing lives at all extremes, each of us can
expect eventually to face temporary or
permanent physical challenges, and
almost certainly to be close to family or
friends who are differently abled. Simi
larly, people of color and blended back
grounds will soon become the majority
and the norm.
Whether measured economically or
considered philosophically, integrating
the disabled is better than isolating
them. That the disabled can contribute to
the mainstream as well as enjoy lives that
are meaningful is still a new idea.
The changes urged on behalf of the
disabled can come to benefit all of us.
Products designed for the disabled are
convenient for the young, the elderly or
those who are trying to do too many
things at once. With race, we have forgot
ten that the country as a whole stands to
gain from efforts to end discrimination
and provide equal opportunity.
There are many measurements of
"ability." Each of us, in different ways, is
more or less able.
To be fair requires "reasonable accom
modation" for each of us. Fairness ought

not depend on abstract rules that may
seem easy or logical, but which fail so
obviously in practice. Sameness is not
equality. The same set of stairs are not
equal for a person walking and a person
in a wheelchair. To mix a metaphor, we
have pulled up the ladder with respect to
race.
Rather than attacking the people who
are disabled, we look beyond blaming
either wrongdoers or victims in solving
the problem of disability. It is easy to see
that there are few rational reasons to
defend unnecessary inequities — the
inaccessible bathroom, the inessential
requirements for a job, the failure to
communicate.
It is early to be sanguine. There
remains resistance, sometimes from sur
prising sources such as well-meaning but
poorly-prepared parents of disabled chil
dren. And social Darwinism has returned
— smallness and meanness dressed false
ly in the garb of economics and science.
It is encouraging that the rights of the
disabled are being recognized and pro
tected after lengthy struggle. A renewal
of the civil rights movement may grow
from this latest branch.

The San Francisco Bay Area has been at
the forefront of reform to eliminate dis
crimination towards the disabled.
