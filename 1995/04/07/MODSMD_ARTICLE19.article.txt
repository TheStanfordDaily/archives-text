## Soon there will be lights Bruins come to Sunken 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
A new era is about to sweep in at Stanford's
Sunken Diamond and the Cardinal baseball team
hopes to do likewise with UCLA.
In a change not nearly as earth-shattering as it
was for Wrigley Field, Thursday's game will be
played under the lights for the first time in Stan
ford's history. However, before those festivities
begin, three contests remain to be played as the Bru
ins (18-15, 6-9 in the Pacific 10 Southern Division)
take on the 14th-ranked Cardinal (19-13, 10-4 in the
Six-Pac) in the second series between the two teams.
In the first meetings at Jackie Robinson Stadium
Feb. 24-26, Stanford won two out of three dramatic
games to claim an early stake on first place in the
Six-Pac.
In the opener of the series, senior third baseman
Steve Carver hit a grand slam with two outs and a 0-
2 count in the top of the ninth for the victory. In the
second game, UCLA continued the excitement by
winning 8-6 in 10 innings with help from a home
run and a disputed call. The rubber game of the
series saw freshman right-hander Kyle Peterson
toss a six-hit shutout to claim the victory.
Freshman center fielder Joe Kilburg, juniors A.J.
Hinch and Troy Kent and Carver each lit up the
Bruins pitching staff to go a combined 20 for 41
with two homers in that three game set. On the
mound, the Cardinal enjoyed a stellar performance
from junior left-hander Mike Robbins, who gave up
one earned run in an extended relief appearance of
sophomore Jason Middlebrook. Robbins pitched
seven and two-thirds innings and garnered a no
decision.
At 2:30 p.m. today junior left-hander Dan Reed
will go to the mound to try to spark another winning
streak. After hitting its way to a season-high five

victories in a row, Stanford lost to San Jose State 9-
4 on Tuesday. Reed, who currently sports a record
of 3-3 and a 4.14 ERA, will face a lineup that fea
tures Six-Pac player of the week Tim DeCinces.
DeCinces, a sophomore catcher, has a batting
average of .347 and also shows some power. The son
of former major leaguer Doug DeCinces has hit
seven home runs so far in addition to tallying 30
RBI. The Cardinal will look to run whenever run
ners get on base as DeCinces has thrown out only 25
percent of all base stealers.
Freshmen Eric Byrnes and Troy Glaus also power
the Bruins. Byrnes, a former catcher at St. Francis
High School in Portola Valley, Calif., now plays right
field and has six home runs while the third baseman
Glaus also has slugged six. Byrnes, who leads UCLA
with 12 stolen bases, was drafted by the Los Angeles
Dodgers in the 38th round last year while Glaus
turned away overtures from the San Diego Padres
after being selected in the second round. Glaus has
been less than stellar in the field, committing 14
errors for a woeful .878 fielding percentage.
The Bruins' pitching staff features Ryan Lynch,
Rick Heineman and reliever Peter Zamora. Lynch, a
sophomore, stands at 1-1 with a conference-best
2.61 ERA in six starts; he has struck out 32 batters
in 38 innings. Heineman, tied for the team lead with
five wins, sports an ERA of 3.48 while the freshman
Zamora has three saves to go with his 2.84 ERA.
For Stanford, Robbins and Peterson will take the
mound in the final two games. Robbins will start
Saturday at 1 p.m. and has a 2-0 record, two saves
and a team-leading 2.63 ERA as he will make hi 3
third start in 12 appearances. Peterson, twice
named Six-Pac pitcher of the week, paces the staff
with a 6-1 record and 64.2 innings pitched. Peter
son, whose ERA is 3.06, also will throw his first
pitch at 1 p.m., albeit on Sunday, the last game
before the lights are installed.
