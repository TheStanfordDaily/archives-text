# Greeks submit proposals for campus houses

Hoping for their own houses, two fraternities
and one sorority submitted applications for hous
ing to the University during winter quarter.
The applications come as the University works
on a 1993 proposal to consider unhoused Greek or
ganizations for housing. It is still unclear, howev
er, if the proposal will be approved, said Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Heather Dunn.
"We are hoping that we can have a new policy
that can include women and organizations that
could not apply in the past," Dunn said.
Fraternities Sigma Nu and Zeta Psi and the
Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority all submitted appli
cations. If the Kappas are accepted, it will be the
first time a sorority will have its own house since
they were forced to leave the Row in 1944.
Currently, the University grants housing to
fraternities using a "grandfather" system, Dunn
said. In 1977, 12 fraternities, including Zeta Psi,
were chosen to receive priority to have residences
on the Row.
Zeta Psi, one of the grandfather fraternities,
lost its house in 1981 for throwing a Mills College
student into a cement pond. The recent applica
tion is the first time Zeta Psi has tried to obtain a
house since regaining University recognition in
1992 -
Kappa president Frandy Moiso, however, said
that because of "gender equity" sororities may
have preference if the current proposal is ap
proved.
She added that although she was positive in the
beginning of the year that a sorority would receive
housing this year, "as it comes closer to the Draw
... I can see Stanford delaying it another year."
Dunn said she is still discussing the proposal
with the Greek organizations. "We'd all like to get
this taken care of," she said.
The pending proposals may affect the choices
rushees make this year, said Zeta Psi President
Joe Bialowitz.
However, Moiso said that "since we haven't
heard anything, I don't think it's going to be a fac
tor at all [during Rush]," which begins tomorrow
for sororities and Monday for fraternities.
Dunn said that she is unsure when the propos
al will be finalized.
