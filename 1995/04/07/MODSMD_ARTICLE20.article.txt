# Swords, shields and spikes
## Volleyball will use all its weapons vs. BYU 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
The No. 2 Stanford men's volleyball team's
matchup with eighth-ranked Brigham Young tomor
row will be a battle between the sword and the
shield. Stanford spearheads the nation in offense,
and BYU possesses the top defense in the country.
The Cardinal (16-5 overall, 12-4 in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) has attacked for a .385
overall percentage this season, better than even No.
1 UCLA. Stanford's arsenal features two All-Ameri
can candidates, swing hitters junior Mike Lambert

and sophomore Matt Fuerbringer. Lambert and
Fuerbringer are essential components of the punish
ing side-out game that Stanford relies on to win.
BYU (10-7, 9-7 in the MPSF), on the other hand,
counts much more on quick scoring. The Cougars
lead the nation with 7.9 blocks per game; middle
blocker Kevin Hambly is one of the best blockers in
the nation with 2.1 blocks per game. The Cougars'
setter, Jesse Gant, has a higher blocking average
than any Stanford player with 1.7.
If any balls penetrate the wall BYTJ setr up at the
net, they will probably be picked
by the Cougars in the backcourt.
Swing hitter Scott Larkin has
averaged 2.2 digs per game, again
better than any Stanford player.
Overall, the Cougars are holding
their opponents to a very low .287
attack average this season.
The Cougars' record does not
seem to reflect their dominating
defense this year. However, they
have only lost three of their last
eight matches, and the five-game
defeats came against No. 1
UCLA, No. 3 Hawaii, and Cal
State-Northridge. All three have
defeated Stanford.
"They have beaten a lot of
good teams," said coach Ruben
Nieves, "including us and UCLA
at the UCSB Invitational tourna
ment earlier this year — they're
very capable. I think they're one
of the teams that if they put
together a good run, like they did
at Santa Barbara where they beat
us all, they can win the national
championship."

One chink in the Cougars'
armor that seems at first para
doxical is their blocking system.
BYU uses a read-blocking scheme
where their blockers wait and
react to the opponent's sets. This
system makes them vulnerable to
quick attacks in the middle, a
weakness Stanford could exploit
because the Cardinal's quick hit
ters — middle blockers Keen an
Whitehurst, Michael Hoefer and
Brian Garrett — all hit for very
high percentages.
"We can't get predictable with
our offense," Nieves said. "We
have to keep their blockers mov
ing. They are vulnerable to quick
attacks, but that means that
we're going to have to pass well
enough to set our quicks."
Other than adjustments to
Stanford's offense, Garrett also
pointed out that the Cardinal will
have to try to match BYU's defen
sive production to be successful.
"Against a blocking team like
BYU, we just have to be very per
sistent with our side-out game,"
Garrett said. "And we have to get
scrappy on defense ourselves —
do things that aren't necessarily
our forte."
