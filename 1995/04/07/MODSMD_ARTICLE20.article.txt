# Swords, shields and spikes
## Volleyball will use all its weapons vs. BYU 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
The No. 2 Stanford men's volleyball team's
matchup with eighth-ranked Brigham Young tomor
row will be a battle between the sword and the
shield. Stanford spearheads the nation in offense,
and BYU possesses the top defense in the country.
The Cardinal (16-5 overall, 12-4 in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) has attacked for a .385
overall percentage this season, better than even No.
1 UCLA. Stanford's arsenal features two All-Ameri
can candidates, swing hitters junior Mike Lambert

and sophomore Matt Fuerbringer. Lambert and
Fuerbringer are essential components of the punish
ing side-out game that Stanford relies on to win.
BYU (10-7, 9-7 in the MPSF), on the other hand,
counts much more on quick scoring. The Cougars
lead the nation with 7.9 blocks per game; middle
blocker Kevin Hambly is one of the best blockers in
the nation with 2.1 blocks per game. The Cougars'
setter, Jesse Gant, has a higher blocking average
than any Stanford player with 1.7.
