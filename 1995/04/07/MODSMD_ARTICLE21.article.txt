## Women out for revenge vs. No. 3 Bruins 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
As March Madness turns into April
Insanity, NCAA women's tennis is heat
ing up as the third-ranked UCLA Bru
ins (14-2 overall, 4-1 in the Pacific 10
Conference's Southern Division) and
the USC Trojans (6-9, 1-4 in the Pac-10
South) venture north to visit the No. 7
Cardinal (14-2, 3-0 in the Pac-10 South)
this Friday and Saturday at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.
Since falling to the then fourth
ranked Texas Longhorns, the Cardinal
has torn through its opponents, losing
only three total matches on its way to
consecutive victories against UC-Santa
Barbara, San Diego State and Pepper
dine during last week's break.
Hoping to continue on its current win
streak, Stanford has the added incentive
of revenge as the Bruins sent the Cardi
nal home early from the National Indoor
Team Championships in February with
a 5-4 victory in Madison, Wis.
The Bruins bring a lineup loaded
with talent to Stanford, especially up
front where junior Jane Chi, junior Keri
Phebus and freshman Stephanie Chi
have combined for a dual-match record
of 51-2 at the top three positions in the
Bruin lineup. Phebus remains unde
feated this season, with a record of 4-0
in the No. 1 spot and 10-0 in the No. 2.
"They're really good, they're one of
the premier teams this year," said Stan

ford head coach Frank Brennan.
"They're super strong at the top â€”
they've probably got the best one-two
punch in the country, and both of their
top doubles are ranked in the top eight
in the country."
Often the doubles seedings feature
Phebus and senior Susie Starrett (5-1)
at the No. 1 position followed by the Chi
sisters (5-3).
The Cardinal experienced troubled
waters up front in the teams' first meet
ing, dropping the top two singles match
es in straight sets. However, Stanford's
No. 1 doubles duo of sophomore Katie
Schlukebir and freshman Ania Bleszyn
ski, currently ranked No. 29 in the
country, upset Phebus and Starrett 6-4,
7-5.
"The last couple of days have looked
pretty good," Brennan said. "It all
depends on whether we're focused or
not. We've had a lot of problems with
getting focused and getting through
finals and stuff like that. I think we're
finally realizing that this is crunch
time, and this is when we have to do it.
I've seen some more enthusiasm and
some more hard work. Hopefully, that's
going to pay off."
The Cardinal dominated the lower
half of the singles competition in the
February meeting, taking three of the
remaining four matches, but dropped
both the Nos. 2 and 3 doubles matches.
