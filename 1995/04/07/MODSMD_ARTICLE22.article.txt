# Pac-10 slate hurting softball
## 
### Jason Weintraub Contributing writer 
Coach Sandy Pearce knew that the
strength of the Pacific 10 Conference
would pose many problems for her young
Stanford softball squad. Wednesday's dou
bleheader against those dreaded weenies
from Cal proved her right, as Stanford
dropped two games to the Bears by a com
bined score of 20-1.
Stanford (10-18 overall, 1-9 in the Pac
-10) is finding Pac-10 competition to be as
tough as advertised by the experts who call
it the best conference in the nation. Over
spring break, the Cardinal lost both games
of a doubleheader with 20th-ranked Wash
ington by scores of 8-3 and 11-0. Stanford
fared better against Oregon State last Sat
urday, winning the second game 9-5 after
dropping the opener 6-1. The next day,
however, Oregon swept the Cardinal, win

ning game one 6-0 and taking the second
game 3-1.
Stanford was hurt during the Oregon
road trip by the loss of freshman sensation
Jessica Schulman from the starting rota
tion. Schulman, the highly recruited pitch
er from Los Angeles, has developed a stress
fracture in her back and will be out of the
lineup indefinitely. Schulman, who has an
earned run average of 1.28 and ranks sec
ond in the Pac-10 in individual pitching,
had helped Stanford maintain a team ERA
of 1.80 that ranked fourth in the confer
ence prior to her injury.
"It just happened because of over-use,"
Schulman said of her injury. "Too much
pitching, too much strain [on the back]."
In her absence, sophomore Angela Webb
(4-11) has performed admirably, picking up
the win against Oregon State. Neverthe-
