# Pac-10 slate hurting softball
## 
### Jason Weintraub Contributing writer 
Coach Sandy Pearce knew that the
strength of the Pacific 10 Conference
would pose many problems for her young
Stanford softball squad. Wednesday's dou
bleheader against those dreaded weenies
from Cal proved her right, as Stanford
dropped two games to the Bears by a com
bined score of 20-1.
Stanford (10-18 overall, 1-9 in the Pac
-10) is finding Pac-10 competition to be as
tough as advertised by the experts who call
it the best conference in the nation. Over
spring break, the Cardinal lost both games
of a doubleheader with 20th-ranked Wash
ington by scores of 8-3 and 11-0. Stanford
fared better against Oregon State last Sat
urday, winning the second game 9-5 after
dropping the opener 6-1. The next day,
however, Oregon swept the Cardinal, win

ning game one 6-0 and taking the second
game 3-1.
Stanford was hurt during the Oregon
road trip by the loss of freshman sensation
Jessica Schulman from the starting rota
tion. Schulman, the highly recruited pitch
er from Los Angeles, has developed a stress
fracture in her back and will be out of the
lineup indefinitely. Schulman, who has an
earned run average of 1.28 and ranks sec
ond in the Pac-10 in individual pitching,
had helped Stanford maintain a team ERA
of 1.80 that ranked fourth in the confer
ence prior to her injury.
"It just happened because of over-use,"
Schulman said of her injury. "Too much
pitching, too much strain [on the back]."
In her absence, sophomore Angela Webb
(4-11) has performed admirably, picking up
the win against Oregon State. Neverthe-
less, after the two losses to the
Weenies, Webb's ERA for the sea
son rose to 4.65, while the team's
ERA ballooned to 2.67, sixth-best
in the conference.
"It's still very sore," Schulman
said. "I have to stay off of it for
about three weeks. If it doesn't
bother me after three weeks, I can
start some light throwing and prac
ticing."
The significance of Schulman's
injury was obvious against eighth
ranked Cal on Wednesday, as the
Bears controlled game one
throughout. Cal scored five runs in
the first three innings en route to
an 8-1 victory. After scoring a sin
gle run in the top of the first, Cal
erupted for four runs in the top of
the third to take a 5-0 lead.
Stanford attempted to begin a
comeback in the home half of the
third, scoring its only run of the
doubleheader behind the hitting of
sophomore shortstop Summer Lee.
Lee was 3-3 in game one and 1-2 in
game two, raising her team-leading
batting average to .457. That mark

is good for seventh in the Pac-10.
As a team, Stanford managed only
seven hits in game one and was
unable to mount a scoring threat
after the third inning rally.
Whitney Floyd (12-6) got the
win for the Bears, who improved
their season record against the
Cardinal to 3-0.
Cal made it 4-for-4 against
Stanford in the nightcap, demol
ishing Stanford with a 12-run, 16-
hit offensive outburst. Cal was led
offensively by catcher Gillian Box,
who hit her fourth home run of the
season and drove in three runs in
game two.
The Lady Cardinal managed
only two hits in the five-inning
game against Cal ace Anne Walsh.
With the victory, Walsh improves
to 14-3 on the year.
With the two wins, Cal
improves to 26-9 overall and a
league-best 8-0 in the Pac 10. Right
behind Cal in the league standings
are Arizona and UCLA, who are
ranked first and second nationally.
On Saturday, Stanford enter
tains Arizona State in a noon dou
ble header at El Camino Field. The
Sun Devils are 19-14 on the season
and have a 4-6 record in the Pac
-10.
