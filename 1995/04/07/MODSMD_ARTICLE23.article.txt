# Gymnasts off to Norman
## 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
About now, the Stanford
men's gymnastics team must be
wondering what it has to do to
get a little respect.
Despite a strong performance
by the 14th-ranked Cardinal at
the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation championship in
Albuquerque, N.M. last week
end, some in collegiate gymnas
tics still doubt the squad's abili
ty. The team will try to chal
lenge such naysayers this week
end in Norman, Okla. at the
NCAA Western Regional Cham
pionship.
Stanford posted a season
high score of 229.0 last week
end, topping a strong field
which featured six teams
ranked in the top 10, including
defending national champion
Nebraska and the host school,
No. 1 New Mexico.
Lobo gymnasts were quoted

in local papers as saying that
the Cardinal shouldn't have
won.
"They thought it was a
fluke," said Stanford sophomore
lan Bachrach. "Their guys defi
nitely didn't think we had the
ability to win and that when
they face us in Regionals, that
they'll beat us."
The disrespect that the team
faces is not a new development.
Traditionally a gymnastics pow
erhouse, the Cardinal — which
won the national championship
in 1992 and 1993 and finished
second last season — was picked
to finish fifth in the preseason.
However, the squad has been
plagued by inconsistency and
injuries this year and has seen
its ranking plummet out of the
top 10. Despite its lower stand
ing, the team has paid little
heed to its critics.
"Going into the meet
[MPSFs] we knew that the
rankings didn't really matter,"

said freshman specialist
Clarence Miao. "Judges are dif
ferent all over the country."
The rankings of college teams
are determined by a team's best
three scores averaged, which
include two away meets and one
home meet.
"Rankings don't really mean
anything," said head coach
Sadao Hamada. "The team that
wins will be the one who per
forms the best on a given day."
Throughout the season,
Hamada has scoffed at
doubters, indicating that it is
his plan to have his team peak
for the NCAA Championships.
After some rough meets and the
season's low point in an ugly
win against San Jose State, the
squad has made marked
improvement, posting season
high team scores in two of its
last three meets.
While the team still showed
some inconsistency in Albu
querque, flashes of brilliance
were seen in several events,
most notably on the pommel
horse and rings where Stanford
hit a combined 11 out of 12 rou
tines.
In addition, the team is no
longer hobbled by injuries. While
senior Jason Cohen continues to
be racked by back pain, freshman
Tim Dalrymple, sophomore Oliv
er Demree and junior Andrew
Manson have all returned to
nearly 100 percent after serious
injuries during the season.
Manson's recovery has been
especially strong. Originally
believed to be out for the entire
season after a knee injury in the
warm-ups at San Jose State,
Manson has looked impressive
as of late. He capped his come
back last weekend with a second
place finish on the rings in the
event finals.
While the team's hopes for
the title have been bolstered by
its performance at MPSFs, it is
clear that there is a measure of
guarded optimism surrounding
its quest for the title.
"We are still having some
problems," said assistant coach
Taka Miyagawa, "but if we hit.
our routines we can win. The
key is there."
