# Tumblers are ready for regional
## 'Pumped' squad can garner automatic NCAA bid with win 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
They have waited all season for this.
The time has come for the Stanford
women's gymnastics team to realize its
goal.
"We're definitely pumped," said
freshman Keri Monahan.
The Cardinal squad travels to Ore
gon State to compete in Saturday's
NCAA regional competition. The win
ner from each region receives an auto
matic berth in the NCAA nationals; six
wild card bids are also given.
Stanford must perform better than
it did in last weekend's Pacific 10
Championship if the team expects to
qualify. Despite a respectable perfor
mance, the Cardinal finished fifth with
a 191.825, nearly four points behind
first place UCLA.
"We had an average meet," said
Stanford coach Breck Greenwood. "We
need to work a little harder."
The squad began the meet on the
vault, where freshman Keri Monahan
scored an impressive 9.800 while
senior co-captain Jen 6 Elzie merited a
9.775. Senior Meegan Lannin also
vaulted well, recording a 9.650.
The Cardinal started to run into

trouble on the bars, its next event.
Both Moore and Lannin suffered falls,
forcing the team to count one of the
mistakes. On the balance beam Stan
ford once again hit only four of its six
routines, as freshman Christie Jones
and sophomore Ariel Passanisi both
fell, Jones for the first time this sea
son.
"Christie has had a tremendous
year on beam," Greenwood said. "It
was miraculous that she went 10 for 11
on the season."
The team moved from the beam to
the floor exercise, where Moore, Elzie
and senior Tina Snowden all recorded
marks of 9.750. Normally very reliable,
Monahan struggled at the beginning of
her routine as she attempted a new
tumbling sequence.
Perhaps the most unfortunate event
of the afternoon occurred during
senior co-captain Katie Clancy's floor
routine. After an awkward landing,
Clancy figured that she had damaged
some cartilage but MRI tests revealed
something far worse.
Clancy had torn her anterior cruci
ate ligament for the second time in as
many years.
"It is definitely disappointing not to
finish the last two meets of the sea

son," Clancy said. "But I did get to
come back, and it was great. All I can
say now is thank God that I had a
chance to return."
Although the squad didn't do as well
as it had hoped at the Pac-10 Champi
onships, the disappointment could be
seen as a blessing in disguise. Last
year, the team had its best outing at
Pac-10's, only to suffer one of its worst
performances at regionals.
"[Pac lO's] just felt like another
meet," Moore said. "It doesn't count
for much. But we are really excited
about regionals."
For Stanford to qualify for nation
als, the Cardinal would have to either
win its region or score enough points to
earn a wild card spot. Since UCLA
remains the heavy favorite, the Stan
ford gymnasts believe that a wild card
berth is Stanford's ticket to the NCAA
Championship.
A week of spring break and intense
practice has left the squad with a sense
of optimism about its chances. The
gymnasts are rested, prepared, and
looking forward to Saturday's chal
lenges.
"Our goal is to hit 24 out of 24 rou
tines," Greenwood said. "If we do that,
then it is up to the judges."
