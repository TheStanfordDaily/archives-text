# Spring back or fall forward? A dilemma
## 
### 
Did you ever have the feeling that you want
ed to go, still have the feeling that you wanted
to stay? — Jimmy Durante

Springtime: Wool sweaters burst like
chrysalises, releasing metamorphosed tushies,
newly pert, into the aromatic, pheromone
laden air. Jean-shorts flutter like butterfly
wings causing pollination in the transfer of
booty.
Springtime: The clock tower strikes Senior
Year, reminding some that this frivolous gaiety
comes fettered and defined. Graduation, like
nirvana, promises freedom from the bitter cycle
of register-midterm-final-register.
It's a mixed blessing, this tortured time of
sunshine.
It breeds certain thoughts — gulp adult
thoughts — in the minds of those who may not
be here to see it again next spring. Big ques
tions like: What the hell ami doing once Casper
finishes rewinding that tape of "Pomp and Cir
cumstance?"
The notion of leaving the second nest is
associated with much fear, and for good rea
son. The alternative to staying sounds an
awful lot like the future. To leave means facing
that; it means the end of this nonsensical romp
and a cessation of reassuring-yet-false short
term goals; it means that all unconsummated
flirtations — academic or amorous — will
remain unconsummated and that if the dark
haired, chocolate-eyed beauty from the Coffee
House and I don't mack by June, we never will.
And then there's the glorious safety net of
the Stanford bubble — the one which promises
that so long as you remain within its semiper
meable confines you are secure. None of the
outside badness can touch or taint you unless

it's in the World & Nation section of The Daily.
Only when you leave do you become suscepti
ble.
Yet with that vulnerability to what we've all
heard referred to as "The Real World" comes
something which only occurs here in kid-size
doses: opportunity.
Sure, Stanford offers a more-than-impres
sive slew of activities, but they're all so very
limited in their number, if not their scope.
(After all, how much effect can you really be
having when the audience for your efforts is a
campus full of the same dorks you lived with
freshman year?) Only outside the bubble do
you have the chance to affect those who have
never known its comforts.
The battle of the safe versus the possible.
Oh, but even the possible poses its prob
lems, doesn't it? Because when you're finally
reveling in the fact that you can learn without
having to prove that you've learned, occupy

ing your days with the globe's endless poten
tial, the thing that might make you wish you
were back in Great Works trying to memorize
the names and occupations of all of Achilles'
relatives is the complete lack of direction pro
vided.
No one can tell you what is the right step to
take once you've returned that rented cap and
gown. No one can say one path will lead to more
success, more happiness, more money, more
nookie — whatever your goal — than another.
There are no instructions printed on the back
of your diploma. And in an infinite universe
with six controllable directions of freedom,
there are more possibilities for motion than
there are in Disney's new Indiana Jones Adven
ture.
It's like being a little-little kid on a
bumper car ride but someone pushes a but
ton to make the walls disappear. Suddenly,
you're a six-year old in control of a free run
ning automobile — only you have no idea
where to go.
Finally, the seductive power of the pre-med
track starts making sense. Because that's pret
ty much all it is: a track. Safe and sound and
mindless. "Make this choice," they are told.
"Do the following and your next seven to twelve
years are planned for you. Heck, we'll even
throw in a career and some bucks to boot." All
just for sticking it out through the Chem series.
It's almost starting to sound worth it.
The turmoil, the frenetic discombobulation
of the senior moment is a powerful motivator of
panic. But Figure at least there's still spring
left, giving you two options: You can go ahead
and sulk over its temporality or you can revel in
its sultry charms. ..
Don't forget to put on suntan lotion.
