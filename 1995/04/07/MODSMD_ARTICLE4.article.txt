# ASSU ballot won't include initiative
## Elections commissioner Berent denies Students' Alliance rights proposal 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Due to constitutional violations
in the form and content of the Stu
dent Rights Initiative — a series of
reforms sponsored by the Students'
Alliance party — ASSU Elections
Commissioner Jonathan Berent
ruled yesterday that it will not ap
pear on the spring election ballot.
The Council of Presidents also
denied the Alliance's request for a
special meeting to discuss the initia
tive's status. According to COP
member Mork Murdock, it would be
unconstitutional to put the initia
tive on the ballot through such a
meeting.
The failed initiative contains two
sections: advisory referenda and a
set of four amendments which
would create a judicial council,
guarantee the right to special-fee
refunds, make it easier to put refer
enda on the ballot and strengthen
the ASSU's current freedom of in
formation act.
In his ruling, Berent wrote that

the initiative
did not go
through the
proper ad
ministrative
process to get
on the ballot,
did not pro
cure there-

quired number of student signa
tures and failed to contain all of the
required introductory information.
Instead of following the consti
tutionally maidated process which
requires first presenting the pro
posal to the ASSU Senate, the Al
liance went directly to students by
asking them to sign petitions to put
the initiative on the ballot, Berent
said.
"They had to bring it to the sen
ate chair, have the senate act on it
and then take it to the students,"
Berent said.
Berent said the initiative also did
not receive the 1,700 petition signa
tures needed to put both parts of the

measure on the ballot. The
Alliance only collected 850 signa
tures, enough for one part but
not both.
The Alliance also did not pro
vide enough information in the
proposal packet for students to
understand the purpose of the
initiative, Berent said.
"Basically what I wanted in
the petition packet is clear infor
mation that this is a constitu
tional change," Berent said. "It
was not clear that this was a pro
posed constitutional change."
Berent said that he surveyed
10 students about the informa
tion contained in the packet.
"Over half did not realize that
this was a proposed constitution
al change."
He also called 10 students who
had signed the petition, only two
of whom knew the purpose of the
initiative.
"To place a constitutional
amendment on the ballot is a
serious endeavor," Berent said.
"Its position should be clear."
People's Platform COP candi
date and current Deputy Senate
Chair Michael Choo agreed.
"There are a lot of ideas in the
Student Rights Initiative that

the People's Platform supports,
but this is a matter of the ASSU
Constitution," Choo said.
"It is our understanding that
the Student Rights Initiative did
not follow constitutional proce
dures to be put on the ballot," he
added. "We support the election
commissioner's ruling that the
constitution must be adhered
to."
Senate candidate and current
undergraduate senator Steve
Russell said the ruling was unfair
because the Alliance has made a
good faith attempt to follow all of
the election rules.
"The purpose of three sepa
rate meetings between Andr6
Vanier and [Senate Chair]
Nawwar Kasrawi was to work
out the constitutional require
ments needed to put the Student
Rights Initiative on the ballot,"
Russell said.
"We followed every directive
given to us by the senate chair,"
he said. "It seems however that
there were certain facts that Kas
rawi conveniently left out," Rus
sell said. "I find the idea that he
suddenly became enlightened
two nights ago ridiculous."
Kasrawi denied Russell's
allegation. "Basically, this issue
was not brought to my attention
when Russell and Vanier specif
ically asked my opinion," he
said.
