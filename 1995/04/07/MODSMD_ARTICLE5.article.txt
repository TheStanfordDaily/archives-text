# Sororities, fraternities to begin Rush activities
## 
### Anne Dubinsky 
Let the season begin.
Tonight, Stanford's six official soror
ities kick off Rush events in their search
for new members. According to Inter
sorority Council President Britt
Wahlin, more than 260 women have al
ready signed up.
Prospective members will attend
Rush parties through Tuesday held at
Escondido Elementary School. With
each set of parties, the rushees and
sorority members will each be asked to
limit their choices. Final bids will be dis

tributed on Wednesday.
Wahlin also said that sororities this
year plan to de-emphasize decorations.
"This way, we can get rid of the frills and
let women get to know other women,"
she said.
Fraternity Rush starts on Monday.
Prospective members will attend parties
sponsored over a two-week period by
each of the 18 fraternities.
According to former Interfraternity
Council President Tom Baranowski, be
tween 300 and 400 men will take part in
Fraternity Rush. There is no fee and
men can join the process at any time by

attending a Rush event.
Each fraternity will hold six sched
uled events during this time and cannot
host events on other nights after 8 p.m.
All Rush events will be non-alcoholic.
Fraternity bids will be distributed on
April 24.
This year, due to a new policy stating
that a housed fraternity must fill 90 per
cent of its house with members, some
fraternities are taking Rush very seri
ously.
One of these is Beta Theta Pi —
which needs between 18 and 20 men to
fill the quota, said Rush Chair Jason

Jordan.
To achieve this goal, the Betas plan to
spend more time with prospective mem
bers but are not relying solely on the
two-week Rush period.
"Rush is a year-round process," said
Jordan. "We can't expect a full pledge
class of enthusiastic young men in a
two-week period. By this time, we know
who we are getting. It's a bonus if we get
more."
If housed fraternities do not acquire
enough pledges to fulfill the require
ment, they will have until the time of the
housing draw to accomplish the goal.
