### Molly Stephens Contributing writer 
Aresa Pecot, a junior majoring
in political science, recently won a
$30,000 Truman Scholarship.
She is one of 69 Truman Schol
ars chosen this year for outstand
ing leadership potential and com
mitment to public service.
The Harry S. Truman Scholar
ship Foundation asks colleges and
universities around the country to
each nominate three applicants.
Pecot competed with 17 other
Stanford candidates and 763 can
didates nationwide to become a
Truman Scholar.
"I'm very honored," said Pecot.
"I think the [application] process
itself [made me] realize what an
honor [the scholarship] is, because
I met so many qualified people."
Pecot completed interviews,
answered 15 short questions and
wrote a policy proposal titled "En
terprise Zone Guidelines" for the
scholarship application.
"I wrote about the current
shortcomings and possible im
provements for the economic sit
uations of inner cities," Pecot

said.
"I think my interest in domestic
economic issues sets me apart
from other applicants," Pecot con
tinued. "[Urban development] has
been neglected in a lot of ways."
Pecot plans to use the scholar-

ship in communities, citizenship and individ
ual interaction with the political environment.'

ship to obtain both a master's de
gree in public policy and a law de
gree.
She is also interested in design
ing her own master's study of eco
nomic intervention programs.
"I am currently studying po
litical science because I never
wanted to be too narrowly fo
cused," Pecot said. "But I want
to refine [my studies] in gradu
ate school."
Pecot added that she is cur
rently focusing on political psy
chology.

"I'm trying vo learn how to en
hance membership in communi
ties, citizenship and individual in
teraction with the political envi
ronment," she said.
Pecot said she wants to use
graduate school to focus on the ac

tual economic and urban situa
tions.
"I also believe a law degree is
very important since economic
laws are generally not legally
sound," Pecot added.
Pecot said she later hopes to
work for either the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
or the Senate Subcommittee on
Housing and Urban Affairs, using
her knowledge to address the
urban crisis.
Political Science Prof. Emeri
tus Hubert Marshall, a member
of Stanford's selection commit
tee, commended Pecot's work.
The committee "looks for a
commitment to a career in public
service, which is defined as activi
ty in government and nonprofit
organizations, advocacy organiza
tions and private organizations,
[along with] leadership poten
tial," Marshall said.
"We were impressed that
[Pecot] had overcome a lot of
handicaps in her background,
such as coming from a low
income family," he added. "We
were also impressed by her
success in academics, her leader
ship in high school, the recom
mendation from her internship
in Washington and her sterling
performance in the interview."
Pecot attended the Stanford
in Washington program, where
she interned for the Senate
Subcommittee on the Constitu
tion.
