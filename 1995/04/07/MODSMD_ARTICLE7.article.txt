### Molly Stephens Contributing writer 
Amid the buildings of a mock concentration
camp, Students Against Genocide (SAGE) held a
protest and candlelight vigil in White Plaza yes
terday to recognize the third anniversary of the
war against Bosnia.
Members of SAGE distributed literature de
scribing the atrocities in Bosnia and collected
signatures from Stanford students to demand
that the U.S. Congress lift the current arms em
bargo.
To raise money for the Bosnian refugee fami
ly the group is assisting, SAGE members also
sold "Save Bosnia" pins. SAGE helped Amna
Tokmo and her daughter escape from Sarajevo.
The family arrived in the U.S. two weeks ago.
The group hopes to raise $6,000 in donations to
help the Tokmo family buy furniture, clothing
and other necessities.
At noon, members of SAGE also began con
structing a symbolic mock concentration camp
enclosed by wire and covered with signs decrying
the war crimes in Bosnia.
The concentration camp was filled with dolls

and toys splattered with red paint
to illustrate the bloody nature of
the war. The camp was also filled
with some donated children's
clothes not wanted by the Tokmo
family, symbolically spray-paint
ed red.
"SAGE is hoping to reach stu
dents and educate students about
what is happening [in Bosnia],"
said graduate student Sheri Fink,
SAGE president. "We want to
encourage students to write to
Congress, to join our group and to
push for humanitarian aid.
"The concentration camp sym
bolizes the concentration camps
established by Serbs in Bosnia,"
Fink continued. "The concentra
tion camps in Bosnia are similar
to the Nazi concentration camps."
In the evening, SAGE mem
bers once again congregated in
White Plaza to greet Bay Area
community members who are
intimately concerned about the
war in the Balkans.
SAGE members earlier took

down the U.S. flag from the post
office flag pole and raised the
Bosnian flag.
"We were hoping that someone
would try to stop us, but no one
did," Fink said.
About two dozen people lit can
dles and gathered in the concen
tration camp to support each
other.
"Today, unbelievably and
unexpectedly, is the third
anniversary of the war in Bosnia-
Herzegovina," Fink said. "On
April 6 and throughout April, stu
dent groups throughout the Unit
ed States are making protests
against the war."
Fink then read the manifesto
signed by student groups opposed
to the war.
"On every campus ... we must
demand that elected officials take
action to prevent further
tragedy," Fink read. "Can we go
out on dates when young lovers in
Bosnia are separated?
"We must rise up," she contin
ued. "We must make [students]
understand, make them angry at
the injustice and make them com
passionate for the victims."
Fink held up the United

Nations flag and said that she
believes "the U.N. has made big
mistakes in Bosnia and has exac
erbated the problems." Fink then
used her vigil candle to burn the
U.N. flag.
Natka Buturovic, a former
reporter for the now-government
controlled Borba newspaper in
Sarajevo, Serbia and Belgrade,
then spoke to the audience.
"If we cannot have a multicul
tural Bosnia-Herzegovina, then it
is not my country," Buturovic
said. "My message tonight is that
if you save one person then you
have saved all the world."
Buturovic is currently a
Knight Fellow at Stanford and a
reporter for the independent
newspaper Nasa Borba. She is
studying national and ethnic con
flicts and resolutions and is tak
ing classes in peace studies, hop
ing to make peace without vio
lence.
Tokmo, a former humanitari
an aid worker with Biser — an
organization to help women and
children in Sarajevo — spoke
next.
"The American people must
help in some concrete way, like

lifting the arms embargo," she
said. "If someone does not help
us, then the war will continue for
five, six or years.
"Lifting the embargo is the
best thing," Tokmo added. "We

are not able to defend ourselves
when we do not have arms.
"When we start fighting, the
Serbs have to think about them
selves — how to fight with us,"
she said. "It becomes a real war."
