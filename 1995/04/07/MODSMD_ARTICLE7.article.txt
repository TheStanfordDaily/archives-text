### Molly Stephens Contributing writer 
Amid the buildings of a mock concentration
camp, Students Against Genocide (SAGE) held a
protest and candlelight vigil in White Plaza yes
terday to recognize the third anniversary of the
war against Bosnia.
Members of SAGE distributed literature de
scribing the atrocities in Bosnia and collected
signatures from Stanford students to demand
that the U.S. Congress lift the current arms em
bargo.
To raise money for the Bosnian refugee fami
ly the group is assisting, SAGE members also
sold "Save Bosnia" pins. SAGE helped Amna
Tokmo and her daughter escape from Sarajevo.
The family arrived in the U.S. two weeks ago.
The group hopes to raise $6,000 in donations to
help the Tokmo family buy furniture, clothing
and other necessities.
At noon, members of SAGE also began con
structing a symbolic mock concentration camp
enclosed by wire and covered with signs decrying
the war crimes in Bosnia.
The concentration camp was filled with dolls
