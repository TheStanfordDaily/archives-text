Undergraduate Scholarship Available
for Summer Research Support in Japan
The Ai Isayama Scholarship has been created by the Asia/Pacific Research Center to allow a
qualified Stanford undergraduate to conduct research in Japan in preparation for writing a
senior honors thesis related to Japan or U.S.-Japan relations. The scholarship is normally given
for summer support between the awardee's third and fourth years of undergraduate work.
The Isayama Scholarship provides economy-class air travel and living expenses for up to ten
weeks in Japan. The maximum amount available to each awardee is $4,000 (including travel);
the total amount awarded depends on the proposed length of stay.
Students majoring in any discipline are eligible to apply. Applicants need not be proficient in
the Japanese language but must demonstrate that their time in Japan will contribute
substantially to the completion of their proposed project.
Thr application deadline is April 15. To apply, please submit a written proposal of no more
than five pages in length, along with your resume, current Stanford transcript, two letters of
reference, and a budget for the proposed period of stay in Japan. The proposal should describe
your research topic in detail and explain why you need to spend time in Japan in pursuing this
research. Send your materials to:
