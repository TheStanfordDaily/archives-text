# Number of women in CS is declining
## 
### Ben Sussman Contributing writer 
Lack of female mentors and
subtle forms of discouragement
have contributed to a nationwide
decline in the number of women
pursuing computer science de
grees, according to a recent report.
But, according to Computer
Science Prof. Eric Roberts, who
has studied such trends in the
past, Stanford has taken steps to
minimize the decline.
A study published by the Com
puting Research Association shows
that the number of women receiv
ing bachelor's degrees in computer
science today is less than hall' of
what it was a decade ago, despite a
rise in the number of women earn
ing degrees in other technical fields
such as engineering.
All told, women currently re
ceive less than 30 percent of all
computer science undergraduate
degrees, the study says.
As recently as ten years ago
women received fully 35 percent

of all bachelor's degrees awarded
in computer science, with nearly
15,000 women receiving degrees
in 1986.
The intervening decade has not
been so kind. While the drop-off in
female degrees can partly be
linked to a general decline in the
total number of computer science
degrees, female students still suf
fer disproportionately.
They are hurt, Roberts said, be
cause such reductions damage the
ability for departments to create
what he calls a "critical mass" of
female mentors and professors.
"Building numbers is more im
portant than percentages,"
Roberts explained. "There is an
enormous difference between
having one [woman] out of 20 and
having five out of 100."
Following that argument, Stan
ford can claim a small victory.
Even though women currently
make up less than 15 percent of
the 240 undergraduates majoring
in the field, Roberts maintains
that Stanford still boasts a larger
number of female computer sci
ence students than many other
schools. He said this has been
achieved by Stanford's efforts to
increase its total number of com
puter science students.
However, of Stanford's 33 com
puter science faculty members,
only three are women. And
Roberts said female computer sci
ence students face other barriers to
their education.
Although these barriers can
take the form of overt sexism and
harassment, Roberts points to less
obvious forms of discouragement
as the more damaging factors. A lot
of discouragement can occur
before women even set foot on a
college campus.
"Women have a very different
process in education that leads
them away from technical fields,"
Roberts explained. Unlike boys,
he said, girls are "not given as
much time to 'play' with

machines."
Once on campus, women find
an entirely different set of barriers.
Aside from the lack of female role
models and mentors, Roberts con
tends that professors often have
different expectations for female
students.
Many professors, he said, sim
ply do not challenge their female
students. And while an easier
course of study may result in bet
ter grades, in the long run these
women are not given the opportu
nity to expand their bases of
knowledge, Roberts said.
Despite these difficulties,
Roberts said he remains convinced
that women in computer science
have a vast opportunity for
advancement, mainly because of
the expanding market for comput
er science students.
"The economic viability of the
commercial sector creates a
demand for well-trained stu
dents that will make it easier for
the number of women to reach
the critical level at which peer
support networks can form," he
said.
