# Number of women in CS is declining

Lack of female mentors and
subtle forms of discouragement
have contributed to a nationwide
decline in the number of women
pursuing computer science de
grees, according to a recent report.
But, according to Computer
Science Prof. Eric Roberts, who
has studied such trends in the
past, Stanford has taken steps to
minimize the decline.
A study published by the Com
puting Research Association shows
that the number of women receiv
ing bachelor's degrees in computer
science today is less than hall' of
what it was a decade ago, despite a
rise in the number of women earn
ing degrees in other technical fields
such as engineering.
All told, women currently re
ceive less than 30 percent of all
computer science undergraduate
degrees, the study says.
As recently as ten years ago
women received fully 35 percent

of all bachelor's degrees awarded
in computer science, with nearly
15,000 women receiving degrees
in 1986.
The intervening decade has not
been so kind. While the drop-off in
female degrees can partly be
linked to a general decline in the
total number of computer science
degrees, female students still suf
fer disproportionately.
They are hurt, Roberts said, be
cause such reductions damage the
ability for departments to create
what he calls a "critical mass" of
female mentors and professors.
"Building numbers is more im
portant than percentages,"
Roberts explained. "There is an
enormous difference between
having one [woman] out of 20 and
having five out of 100."
Following that argument, Stan
ford can claim a small victory.
Even though women currently
make up less than 15 percent of
the 240 undergraduates majoring
in the field, Roberts maintains
