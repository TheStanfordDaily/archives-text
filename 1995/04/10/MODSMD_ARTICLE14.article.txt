Peruvian elections
LIMA, Peru (AP) â€” President Alber
to Fujimori, credited with crushing both
inflation and a Maoist rebellion, won a
second five-year term yesterday in
Peru's first peaceful election since 1980,
unofficial exit polls said.
Fujimori denied accusations by rival
candidates, including former U.N. Sec
retary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
that he was involved in a vote fraud
scheme uncovered days before the elec
tion.
Exit polls by Apoyo, Peru's largest
polling firm, gave Fujimori an over
whelming victory with 60 percent of the
vote, followed by 26 percent for Perez de
Cuellar. The margin would be enough to
avoid a runoff.

Fujimori said he was waiting for offi
cial results, expected by midnight yes
terday. Election board officials said the
final tally would not be available for five
days.
But Fujimori said he was encouraged
by preliminary figures and wanted to
thank the Peruvian people, "who not
only have supported me in this election
but during my five years in office."
All of Peru's elections since 1980 had
been marred by violence from the Shin
ing Path, the Maoist guerrillas who
have been all but defeated since the cap
ture in 1992 of their leader, Abimael
Guzman.
Yesterday, soldiers guarded voting
stations with rifles but their numbers
were smaller than in past years and
they did not appear to be needed.
