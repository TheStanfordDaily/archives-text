KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip (AP)
— Islamic militants opposed to the
Israeli-PLO peace process killed six
Israeli soldiers and wounded dozens
of people in two suicide bombings
yesterday near isolated Jewish settle
ments in the Gaza Strip.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin said he would continue talks
with the Palestine Liberation Orga
nization despite calls by right-wing
opponents and some of his allies to
halt them in protest.
In the first attack, a van parked by
the main Gaza highway exploded near
an Israeli bus at about noon, killing
six soldiers, said Brig. Gen. Doron
Almog, Israel's commander in Gaza.
Officials said 34 people were wounded.
Two hours later, about six miles
up the road, a Palestinian car drove
into an Israeli convoy of military and

civilian cars and exploded, Almog
said. Eleven Israelis were wounded —
including two girls ages 2 and 4 —
and two soldiers who were in critical
condition.
Three of those injured were Amer
icans, said White House spokesman
Mike McCurry, who was traveling
with President Clinton in Los Ange
les. He wouldn't give their names,
and didn't say in which attack they
were wounded.
One of those wounded in the first
attack was identified as Alisa Flatow
of West Orange, N.J., a Brandeis Uni
versity junior on leave to study at a
Jerusalem yeshiva. Her mother, Ros
alyn Flatow, said her daughter was
unconscious and on a respirator after
surgery.
The militant group Islamic Jihad
claimed responsibility for the first

attack and said it was carried out by
Khaled Mohammed Khatib, a 24-
year-old construction worker.
Sources in the group Hamas con
firmed a report that the group's mili
tary wing, Izzedine al-Qassam,
staged the second attack. They iden
tified the suicide bomber as Imad
Abu Amouna, also 24, from the Shati
refugee camp.
More than 100 fundamentalist
youths gathered at Khatib's home in
the Nuseirat refugee camp, their
cries for revenge mingling with the
wails of women from inside the house
and the crack of gunshots fired into
the air.
"The language of bullets is the
only one that will guarantee the
departure of the enemy from our ter
ritory," one Islamic Jihad activist
intoned through a loudspeaker.
