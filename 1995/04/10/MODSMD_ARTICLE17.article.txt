## Editorials Diverse admissions 
### 
FOR THE FIRST time in as
long as we can remember,
more of the 2,900 letters
offering applicants a spot in the
Class of 1999 went to women
than to men.
Announced by the Office of
Admissions last week, the figures
— which included the fact that
51.4 percent of acceptances went
to women — reflect a trend that
is sweeping the nation: More and
more women are applying to and
attending college.
And although the 50 percent
barrier is largely symbolic, it's
nice to know that Stanford is on
the leading edge of gender equity
in American universities. We've
already seen an example of that
this year — for the first time in
recent memory, more than half of
this year's freshman class, 50.5
percent, are women, even though
slightly more men than women
were offered admission last
spring.
There was other good news in

the announcement from Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions
James Montoya. Stanford still
enjoys the benefit of being able
to choose from the best and
brightest in the nation.
Of the 15,390 applicants, less
than one in five were offered the
chance to come to the Farm.
Three-fourths of the candidates
hailed from the top 10 percent of
their high school classes, and
more than half had straight A
averages.
In addition, the Farm still
attracts a diverse student body;
more than 44 percent of appli
cants offered admission are eth
nic minorities and around 5 per
cent are students with interna
tional backgrounds, creating a
truly diverse student population.
In short, Stanford seems to be
doing a great job attracting a
variety of exceptional students
from around the country and the
world. That's something we
should all be proud of.
