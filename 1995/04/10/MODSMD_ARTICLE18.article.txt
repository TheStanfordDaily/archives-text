MANY OF THE Universi
ty's science and engineer
ing courses are recorded
by and broadcast on the Stanford
Instructional Television Network.
If they have access to Stanford
cable, students can watch these
classes from their residences — or
even record them for later view
ing.
Even with this technology, how
ever, the four television channels
which broadcast SITN are empty
for most of the day. They are only
active during times when the
courses are actually being taught.
The University should put this
"dead air" time to better use by
broadcasting programs which
could aid students interested in
watching courses at different
times or watching courses not even
taught during the current quarter.
A student could then, for example,
preview a course to be taught in
the following quarter or even sign

up for two classes which meet at
the same time in the same quarter.
While such programs would
require extra work and manpower
on the University's part, the bene
fits to students could far outweigh
the costs.
Stanford already makes video
• tapes of SITN broadcasts available
in libraries, but by rebroadcasting
lectures over the television net
work, the University would be
making these valuable resources
much more accessible to the entire
community.
With the substantial cost of cre
ating SITN already paid for, Stan
ford should take advantage of its
capabilities by publicizing and
broadcasting more of the net
work's class library.
There is no point in keeping
SITN from realizing its full poten
tial. Broadcasting more of its
library of recorded classes is a step
in the right direction.
