## On the bright side of life 
### 
THE GLASS is half full. It's not
that I'm ignorant of the air occu
pying the other half, it's just that
I don't want to give it any attention. I've
decided that I'm not going to be apolo
getic anymore about the hope I feel for
this world or the good I'm hard-wired to
see in each day. Some enigmatic force at
a place like Stanford seems to threaten
us if we dare speak of idealism, like it's
contrary to the academic training we
receive and the scholarly inquiries we
pursue.
Hope has become a four-letter word of
sorts in academia. A university's goal is
to train us to think critically about
issues — to evaluate what is happening
in an insightful way. While this endeav
or doesn't explicitly entail offering a pes
simistic interpretation of our world, the
characterization often turns cynical.
Implicitly, attempting to capture the
imperfect world in a critical way means
we can't ignore its painful shortcomings.
The mark of a sound theory is its
effectiveness in explaining and predict
ing phenomena accurately. A realistic
theory does not discard the dishearten
ing parts of the world just because we
don't like them. So where does optimism
come in?
Seizing hope means taking a long
look at the world, holding on to the
bright spots and envisioning change. If
you don your rose-colored glasses,
everything you saw before will still be

there, imbued with a new hue of encour
agement. Robert Kennedy understood
and articulated the art of optimism:
"Some men see things as they are and
say 'why?' I dream things that never
were and say, 'why not?' "
Kennedy never said he would ignore
poverty or war or death. He never meant
to look past the real problems in the
world. His shortened life itself illus
trates the fragility of hope and its inabil
ity to stop an assassin's bullet. We can
not believe that the hope alone which
exists in our minds can stop domestic
violence, genocide, high-stakes corrup
tion, discrimination or any other prob
lem we could add to a list that would
consume The Daily from front to back.
Yet, in the midst of all these problems
(or challenges, as I like to call them),
I've decided that I'm not going to let
reality deter me from dreaming of what
the world could be. I don't expect the
world as we know it to transform itself
into a Utopia before my time is up. Yet I
cannot help but be intoxicated by the
possibility, especially given the chance
that we might catalyze some sort of
change.
I heard Jimmy Carter speak once
about giving change a try. He wove a
tale about a handful of people who set
out to change the world in the small way
that they could. None of them could
have known that they would make a
dent in the previous scheme of reality all

by themselves, but they at least resigned
themselves to the possibility and set
about their work. Perhaps they never
sat down one day and vowed to be the
anomaly in a world of problems, but in
the end they became just that.
President Carter's recent efforts
surely live as a testament to the power
of a simple goal, like bringing two par
ties together to negotiate at a peace
table. Who knows how long any agree
ments will last or when the process will
have to begin anew. I find solace in the
moment of improvement, the still-dry
ing ink of the signatures of two former
enemies. Carter's activities are not lim
ited to the world of high-powered diplo
macy. He can be seen just as often driv
ing the nail in another Habitat for
Humanity house. He knows this will not
eradicate homelessness, but he does
realize that one more family will have a
roof over their heads because of his con
tribution.
Life is there for the taking. Even in
our academic efforts here we need not
discard idealism. Dream of change. Let
life ooze out of you. Remember, sunrises
and sunsets still happen twice a day.
