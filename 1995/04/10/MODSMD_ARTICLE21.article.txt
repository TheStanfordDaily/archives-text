Balkan Peace Committee denounces all war crimes

THE COLUMN by Brad K. Blitz in
Tuesday Thoughts on April 4 crit
icizing the Balkan Peace Commit
tee asserts that back in May 1993 I ran
up and down the aisles of Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, shouting disruptively while
a forum was underway. The reality was
that in a subdued fashion I handed out
pro-peace literature with Blitz's express

permission before the forum began.
Second, I agree with Blitz that seri
ous widespread atrocities, amounting
cumulatively to mass rape and mass
murder, have been taking place in the
Balkans. The various sides (Serb, Croat
and Bosnian) have used rape, murder
and inhumane internment camps as
ways to terrorize people and drive them

from their homes. I also agree with
Blitz that, by far, the bulk of the atroci
ties have been committed by Serb
forces. The Balkan Peace Committee's
original statement denounced ethnic
cleansing and the "atrocities committed
by Bosnian Serb forces," but added that
"no side has a monopoly on either
atrocities or suffering in this war."

The real difference between Blitz
and the Balkan Peace Committee is
that we do not welcome the prospect of
American troops trying to take and
occupy the streets of Belgrade and
Sarajevo.
