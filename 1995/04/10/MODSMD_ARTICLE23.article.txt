## Back to NCAAs Lobos can't top tumblers 
### Brian Lee Contributing writer 
Last weekend, Stanford left its opponents in
men s gymnastics wondering if they were for
real.
The only thing they're wondering now is what
hit them.
The underrated 14th-ranked Cardinal (8-1-1
overall and Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
champion) obliterated doubts and doubters, scor
ing a 228.750 and topping runner-up Oklahoma
by nearly a point and a half en route to taking the
NCAA Western Regional title in Norman, Okla.
"It was definitely one of our best perfor
mances," said sophomore U.S. national team
member Jamie Ellis. "Our score didn't really
reflect it since it wasn't our season high, but
because it's the postseason, judging is different.
"All year long we've been gearing up for this
and now we're right on target. We really limited
our mistakes and pulled it together."
The victory was by no means without its diffi
culties, however. The Cardinal had to overcome
the home-gym bias by judges towards host Okla
homa. In addition, co-captain and senior national
team member Josh Stein, normally a leading con
tributor, suffered a subpar performance.
"We definitely had our problems in vault and
landings," said freshman specialist Tim Dalrym
ple. "We have room for improvement, before
NCAAs. Still, it's encouraging to win such a com-

petitive meet by a point and a half
without being in top form."
A key aspect of the team's suc
cess was its grace under fire. After a
slow start, Stanford could have eas
ily folded. Instead, the squad
turned on the intensity and charged
through the next four events, lock
ing the win with a stellar perfor
mance on the rings.
"We did our best to not let the
importance of the meet affect our
performance," said senior specialist
Evan Wells. "We just tried to
remain calm. With the high pres
sure, it was important not to let it
get to us."
Towards the end of the meet the
team was surely feeling a bit of deja
vu as the critical juncture fell on the
pommel horse, which was the fifth
event. Just a week earlier the team
had faced a similar must-deliver sit
uation in the same event. In both

instances, Stanford took advantage
of the opportunity to establish its
lead and pave the way for a win.
Perhaps many would have been
less surprised had this been the end
of the road for the Cardinal's 1995
campaign. Ranked No. 5 in the pre
season, the team was written off by
many after early disappointment.
However, head coach Sadao Hama
da remained unfazed, and his gym
nasts started to improve.
"I'm just preparing my team to
peak at NCAAs," he maintained
throughout the season. "I'm not
worried about their ranking."
However, the rest of the gym
nastics community continued to
ignore the Cardinal as a possible
title contender, the most absurd
display of disrespect following on
the heels of last week's MPSF win.
An article in the Albuquerque
Journal downplayed the team's
success and quoted a source from
host school New Mexico as saying
that the victory was a "fluke." Most
of the team seemed to place little
value on UNM's opinion, however,

and proved that the only thing that
was questionable was the Lobos'
No. 1 ranking, as they left New
Mexico in the dust back at fifth
place.
"It was a laughing matter more
than anything," Wells said. "We
just kidded about it a lot. Obviously,
it was kind of a motivating factor,
but we really didn't dwell on it and
tried to focus on just being ready."
With all naysayers put in their
proper places, the team must now
focus on preparing for the challenge
it has been waiting for all season.
Next Tuesday, Stanford will trek
east to Ohio State for the NCAA
finals, where it will vie for its third
national crown in four years.
Hamada led the school to titles in
1992 and 1993 before finishing
runner-up to Nebraska last year.
"None of this has been as sur
prising to us as it has to everyone
else," Dalrymple said. "It's all part
of Sadao's plan. He's definitely had
the season scripted from the very
beginning and now we're peaking
at the right time."
