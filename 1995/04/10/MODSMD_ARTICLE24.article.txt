They may have raised the championship
banner in Pauley Pavilion this weekend,
but UCLA would not find victory on the
road at the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
The Cardinal (16-2 overall, 6-0 in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division)
avenged for an early season defeat and
extended its win streak to five with victo
ries over both third-ranked UCLA (14-4, 4-
3 in the Pac-10 South) and 25th-ranked
USC (6-10, 1-5 in the Pac-10 South) this
weekend out at the Stanford Tennis Stadi
um.
Led by the experience of fourth-year

junior Kim Shasby in Saturday's match
against UCLA, the Cardinal took four of six
singles matches as well as the Nos. 2 and 3
doubles matches for a 6-3 upset.
"I thought the singles were good," said
head coach Frank Brennan. "We played
well, and we played tough, and we stayed
focused basically."
Shasby (12-4), ranked No. 55 in the
nation, highlighted the singles competition
with a 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 victory over junior Paige
Yaroshuk.
Shasby feasted on the emotional weak
ness displayed by Yaroshuk, coming back
after a tough first set with solid ground
stroke play that kept the UCLA junior on
the run for the remainder of the match.
"She's a survivor," said Brennan about
Shasby. "She's the one that goes in and out
of matches, but I think she plays better at
home."
However, UCLA's one-two punch was
too much for the Cardinal to handle up
front. Junior Keri Phebus, boasting a
national ranking of No. 3, remained
unbeaten for the dual-match season in
defeating lOth-ranked Cardinal
sophomore Katie Schlukebir (12-5)
in the No. 1 match, 6-4,6-1.
Freshman Ania Bleszynski (9-5)
could not pull off the upset against
second-ranked junior Jane Chi, but
the 32nd-ranked freshman fell 6-1
6-7,6-4.
Along with Shasby's win, the
Cardinal swept the bottom four
matches. 58th-ranked sophomore
Sandra De Silva (14-2) surprised
freshman Stephanie Chi with a 6-3,
4-6, 7-5 triumph in the No. 4 matchi
as 82nd-ranked freshman Julie
Scott followed suit with a straight
set victory over sophomore Diana
Spadea, 7-5, 6-3.
Senior Amy Chiminello posted a
6-2, 6-4 victory over junior Anicia
Mendez.
UCLA poses almost as lethal a
threat with its top two doubles
teams, as the No. 1 team of Phebus
and senior Susie Starrett rank fifth
nationally while the Chi sisters cur
rently reside at No. 6 in the country.
Phebus and Starrett held off a
late rally by Schlukebir and
Bleszynski (9-3) to hold on for a 6-4,
6-3 win. However, the Cardinal
needed only one victory, entering
doubles play with a 4-2 lead.
"Our problem is we got sloppy;
we get up a little bit and as soon as
we get a lead, we take a nap," Bren
nan said.
The win looked even more secure
as De Silva managed to put
Stephanie Chi out of commission
for doubles as Spadea filled in at the
No. 2 match. With both Stanford
squads at the Nos. 2 and 3 matches
taking the first set, UCLA came
storming back with one last gasp at
the match.
Shasby and sophomore Emily
Burt (7-2) held on, however, for a 6-
2, 2-6, 6-2 triumph which clinched
the upset.
Yaroshuk defaulted her match at
No. 3 after the victory had been
secured. Chiminello and Scott (7-2)
wanted to continue at 6-3, 4-6, 5-4
and leading in the final game, but
were forced to accept the win.
The Cardinal looked even
stronger against USC in dominat
ing 5-1, which became a warm-up
for the Bruins after rain suspended
the match on Friday.
Stanford made doubles unneces
sary with five singles victories.
Rain temporarily postponed the
match until the clincher, Chiminel

lo's 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 win over Pam
Trump, could be completed at an
indoor site in Fremont.
The Cardinal swept the top four
singles matches. Schlukebir was
first to waltz off the court, posting a
6-2, 6-2 disposal of Suzie Italiano.
Bleszynski fell behind 3-6 in the

first set, but breezed through the
second set 6-1 and triumphed in the
third with a 7-6 tie-breaker win.
Shasby began her impressive
weekend by cruising 6-4,6-2 against
Maggie Simkova, while De Silva
defeated Petra Schmitt, winning 6-
3, 6-2.
