# Women's track wins at home
## Men end up third, Oregon triumphs 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
The Stanford track team had
mixed success Saturday against
Oregon and Fresno State. The
women won impressively while
the men finished in last, unable to
muster enough points to offer a
significant challenge.
The women began the running
events with freshman Kortney
Dunscombe racing to a huge lead
in the first lap of the 5,000 meters,
a lead she never relinquished. She
finished in 16 minutes 50.5 sec
onds, well ahead of the rest of the
field.
The enthusiasm carried over to
the 1500 meters, where sopho
more Monal Chokshi and junior
co-captain Dena Dey waited until
the final lap to put away their
opponents en route to a one-two
finish.
"Coach told us to stay up with
the leaders and kick," Chokshi
said. "With 500 [meters to go] it
could have been anyone's race.
Everyone was in a huge pack and I
decided to go at 400 meters. I was
all alone at 350."
As Chokshi made a strong
move on the outside at the gun
lap, Dey followed to leave the com
petition behind.
Sophomore sensation Tyra
Holt continued to dominate in the
400 meters. Running in lane one,
Holt overcame the stagger after
200 meters and jetted to the win
in 56.2 seconds with junior Moni
ca Hoggatt close behind in 56.3.
The spirited running continued
to the 800 meters, where fresh

man Sara Moore combined with
Dey to take the top two spots in
another inspired race.
The Cardinal women rolled in
the next event as senior co-captain
Christy Boyd and freshman Amy
Henderson took first and third in
the 400-meter intermediate hur
dles.
Boyd later joined Hoggatt,
freshman Heather Miller and Holt
in a victorious mile relay that pro
vided the perfect capstone to the
Stanford win.
"Being a senior in my second-to
last home meet and being able to
beat both Oregon and Fresno State
is absolutely wonderful," Boyd
said.
The men had several individual
successes but, unlike the women,
could not put together a sustained
team effort.
The throwers started the meet
on a high point as senior co-captain
Dave Popejoy won the hammer
with a throw of 225-3. Freshman
Adam Connolly continued to

demonstrate amazing poise and
maturity as he took second with a
personal best 208-0 and senior
Toby Norwood completed the
sweep in third place.
"It's nice to have the hammer as
the first event of the meet," Pope
joy said. "It's a good emotional
starter for everyone else."
The field event athletes provid
ed the majority of the points for the
Cardinal as Pete Swan son won the
shot put at 57-6 Vi and the discus at
168-2.
"The throwers should be at a
point where people can count on us
to score," said Popejoy.
Sophomore Chris Buddin added
a personal best in the pole vault as
he soared to the win clearing 16-
9 I A.
Meanwhile, the emotional high
point of the running events was
J.J. White's dramatic victory in the
5,000 meters in a personal and sea
son best of 14:16.58. White battled
with Oregon's Matt Davis
throughout most of the race.
"I wanted to run the race with
out any doubts in my head," White
said. "As I crossed the line on every
lap, I reminded myself to stay
focused and look ahead. I wanted
to key ofT the front runner with a

mile to go and if I felt it I wanted to
move."
And move he did. With 200
meters to go, White took a decisive
lead and put away Davis with a
tremendous kick that evoked the
vocal support of his teammates.
Earlier in the day, sophomore
Bryan Zmijewski created a similar
sensation in the steeplechase when
he kicked down Fresno State's
Israel Pose in the last meters of the
race to finish second in 9:17.26.
"We're building and the process
is slow," head coach Vin Lananna
said. "If you scored the meet as a
dual meet with Fresno State we
would have beaten them."
The final score left Stanford in
third and last at the end of the day,
a position that frustrated some.
"The men have a little bit of
maturing to do," Popejoy said. "As
a team we were lacking something.
We need to figure out what that is.
It might be intensity or involve
ment on the team side. I'm hoping
it's just a matter of people coming
on at the end of the season."
Senior co-captain Tovi Abello
agreed. "I think our potential is
greater than this meet shows. We
can do much better in a number of
areas," he said.
