### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
The Stanford track team had
mixed success Saturday against
Oregon and Fresno State. The
women won impressively while
the men finished in last, unable to
muster enough points to offer a
significant challenge.
The women began the running
events with freshman Kortney
Dunscombe racing to a huge lead
in the first lap of the 5,000 meters,
a lead she never relinquished. She
finished in 16 minutes 50.5 sec
onds, well ahead of the rest of the
field.
The enthusiasm carried over to
the 1500 meters, where sopho
more Monal Chokshi and junior
co-captain Dena Dey waited until
the final lap to put away their
opponents en route to a one-two
finish.
"Coach told us to stay up with
the leaders and kick," Chokshi
said. "With 500 [meters to go] it
could have been anyone's race.
Everyone was in a huge pack and I
decided to go at 400 meters. I was
all alone at 350."
As Chokshi made a strong
move on the outside at the gun
lap, Dey followed to leave the com
petition behind.
Sophomore sensation Tyra
Holt continued to dominate in the
400 meters. Running in lane one,
Holt overcame the stagger after
200 meters and jetted to the win
in 56.2 seconds with junior Moni
ca Hoggatt close behind in 56.3.
The spirited running continued
to the 800 meters, where fresh
