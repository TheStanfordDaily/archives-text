UCLA 9 4 3
Stanford 1 7 16

The Stanford baseball team, favored by many to win
the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division, entered
last weekend with an unexpected challenge from Cali
fornia. Facing UCLA for the second time this seasoit,
the Cardinal entered the three game series intending
to send a message. The team delivered.
Stanford (21-14 overall, 12-5 in the Six-Pac), after
losing the first game to the Bruins (19-17, 7-11 in the
Six-Pac) by a score of 9-1, turned up the intensity and
took the final two to expand its lead in the division.
"We knew Cal was slipping and that this was our
chance," said senior third baseman Steve Carver.
The Cardinal, in two distinctly contrasting styles,
won 7-4 Saturday in the second game of a doublehead
er and demolished UCLA in the rubber game, 16-3.
The Cardinal needed a strong pitching performance
from junior left-hander Mike Robbins in the nightcap
of the twinbill after coach Mark Marquess used four
pitchers in the opening game. Although Robbins did
not turn out his best game of the year, Stanford got
what it needed as he went seven and two-thirds
innings picking up the victory.
"It wasn't easy," Robbins said. "I wasn't hitting my
spots with my fastball."
But Stanford batters were hitting spots without
fielders. The Cardinal pushed across three runs, one in
the first on a RBI single from
Carver and two in the second on
sophomore shortstop Eric Sees's
two-run single, before UCLA got
on the scoreboard. The Bruins put
four hits together in the third to
cut the Stanford lead down to 3-2.
In the sixth inning, UCLA tied
up the game, but Stanford coun
tered in the bottom of the inning.
Back-to-back singles from junior
catcher A. J. Hinch and Carver
gave the Cardinal runners at first
and second. Senior right fielder
Dusty Allen sacrificed both run
ners along and Bruins coach Gary
Adams ordered his infielders in to
prevent Hinch from scoring on an
infield ground ball.
The play failed as Kent
grounded to senior shortstop Gar
Vallone and Hinch broke for
home plate. The throw from Val
lone to DeCinces was high and
Hinch slid across home plate for
the go-ahead run. Schaeffer fol
lowed up with a sacrifice fly to
score Carver, and that was all
Stanford needed.
The Cardinal added two insur
ance runs in the bottom of the
eighth and Sullivan struck out
two in the perfect top of the ninth
to get his fourth save.
Robbins claimed the victory
despite allowing 16 Bruin base
runners.
"Anytime they get 13 hits and
only four runs gives me a good
feeling," Robbins said. "One of
the big things as a pitcher is to
win the 'big spots.' A big spot
occurs when they have runners in
scoring position. I won a few big
spots."
Stanford's pitcher on Sunday,
freshman Kyle Peterson, had
veiy few big spots to deal with.
Peterson went the distance for
the fourth time this year and

claimed his seventh victory on his
19th birthday. The Cardinal's
surprise ace this year, Peterson
gave up eight hits and only three
runs, despite surrendering two
home runs, while striking out five
Bruins.
The easy victory came about
with the help of the sometimes
dormant Stanford bats. All nine
starters reached base and Hinch
and Sees extended their hitting
streaks to 12 and 10 games
respectively. Stanford pounded
out a total of 15 hits off of the
four Bruin pitchers and also
walked a combined 11 times.
However, one Stanford star
shined above all others: Steve
Carver.
Carver liked the first pitch he
saw from UCLA starter John
Phillips, promptly taking the fast
ball over the scoreboard in left
field for a three-run homer. His
next plate appearance could be
considered his worst of the after
noon — Carver walked.
His next at-bat turned out to
be better. With two outs, Carver
hit a high bouncing grounder
down the first base line which hit
the lip of the infield grass and
skipped between the wickets of
first baseman Pete Zamora for a
fluke double.
Not quite done for the day,
Carver led off the bottom of the
sixth with a line drive down the
right field line. Motoring along
the base path, Carver did not stop
until he reached third.
His final at-bat came in the
next inning. Needing a single to
become the first Stanford batter
to hit for the cycle since 1992,
Carver stepped into the batter's
box with Hinch on first following
a single. Carver promptly
launched his second homer of the
game, a blast over the left field
fence off of junior Jeff Howatt.
The two-run blast gave Carver
five RBIs for the game, the most
since Jed Hansen drove in six

against the Bruins last year.
Carver entered the series with
a .283 batting average and left for
tonight's game against Nevada at
.317. Making a bid for Six-Pac
player of the week, Carver went
8-for-12 during the three games
with a pair of home runs and six
RBIs.
Carver was not the only slug
ger to succeed yesterday. Junior
second baseman Brian Dallimore
went 3-for-5 with three RBIs and
fell a homer short of hitting for
the cycle; Allen and Hinch
reached base on nine of 11 tries.
In the first game of the series,
however, UCLA took care of the
scoring. The Bruins notched
seven early runs en route to the 9-
1 victory. Junior left-hander Dan
Reed completed two and two
thirds innings in his shortest out
ing of the year. Reed gave up six
runs, five of them earned, on five
hits and three walks. The three
ensuing Stanford pitchers, sopho
more Tom Reimers, junior Todd
Bartels and sophomore Mark
Williams each gave up two hits
and one run in their two-plus
innings of work. Reimers worked
the extra third of an inning in
relief of Reed.
The Cardinal hit the two Bruin
pitchers well, garnering 11 hits,
but failed to bunch them together
as freshman left-hander Jim Par
que and freshman Ryan O'Toole
spread the hits around.
The first game, originally
scheduled for Friday, was rained
out and postponed until Satur
day. The doubleheader then actu
ally had a rain delay between
games as the clouds poured down
for approximately 20 minutes.
Today's matchup against Neva
da is also a make-up game. The
Cardinal was scheduled to play the
game on March 28, but snow
forced a postponement. Nevada
defeated Stanford 7-4 in the first
meeting between the two teams
March 7 at Sunken Diamond.

The Stanford baseball team, favored by many to win

last weekend with an unexpected challenge from Cali
fornia. Facing UCLA for the second time this seasoit,
the Cardinal entered the three game series intending
to send a message. The team delivered.
Stanford (21-14 overall, 12-5 in the Six-Pac), after
losing the first game to the Bruins (19-17, 7-11 in the
Six-Pac) by a score of 9-1, turned up the intensity and
took the final two to expand its lead in the division.
"We knew Cal was slipping and that this was our
chance," said senior third baseman Steve Carver.
The Cardinal, in two distinctly contrasting styles,
won 7-4 Saturday in the second game of a doublehead
er and demolished UCLA in the rubber game, 16-3.
The Cardinal needed a strong pitching performance
from junior left-hander Mike Robbins in the nightcap
of the twinbill after coach Mark Marquess used four
pitchers in the opening game. Although Robbins did
not turn out his best game of the year, Stanford got
what it needed as he went seven and two-thirds
innings picking up the victory.
"It wasn't easy," Robbins said. "I wasn't hitting my
spots with my fastball."
But Stanford batters were hitting spots without
fielders. The Cardinal pushed across three runs, one in
the first on a RBI single from
Carver and two in the second on
sophomore shortstop Eric Sees's
two-run single, before UCLA got
on the scoreboard. The Bruins put
four hits together in the third to
cut the Stanford lead down to 3-2.
In the sixth inning, UCLA tied
up the game, but Stanford coun
tered in the bottom of the inning.
Back-to-back singles from junior
catcher A. J. Hinch and Carver
gave the Cardinal runners at first
and second. Senior right fielder
Dusty Allen sacrificed both run
ners along and Bruins coach Gary
Adams ordered his infielders in to
prevent Hinch from scoring on an
infield ground ball.
The play failed as Kent
grounded to senior shortstop Gar
Vallone and Hinch broke for
home plate. The throw from Val
lone to DeCinces was high and
Hinch slid across home plate for
the go-ahead run. Schaeffer fol
lowed up with a sacrifice fly to
score Carver, and that was all
Stanford needed.
The Cardinal added two insur
ance runs in the bottom of the
eighth and Sullivan struck out
two in the perfect top of the ninth
to get his fourth save.
Robbins claimed the victory
despite allowing 16 Bruin base
runners.
"Anytime they get 13 hits and
only four runs gives me a good
feeling," Robbins said. "One of
the big things as a pitcher is to
win the 'big spots.' A big spot
occurs when they have runners in

spots."
Stanford's pitcher on Sunday,
freshman Kyle Peterson, had
veiy few big spots to deal with.
Peterson went the distance for
the fourth time this year and

claimed his seventh victory on his
19th birthday. The Cardinal's
surprise ace this year, Peterson
gave up eight hits and only three
runs, despite surrendering two
home runs, while striking out five
Bruins.
The easy victory came about
with the help of the sometimes
dormant Stanford bats. All nine
starters reached base and Hinch
and Sees extended their hitting
streaks to 12 and 10 games
respectively. Stanford pounded
out a total of 15 hits off of the

walked a combined 11 times.
However, one Stanford star
shined above all others: Steve
Carver.
Carver liked the first pitch he
saw from UCLA starter John
Phillips, promptly taking the fast
ball over the scoreboard in left
field for a three-run homer. His
next plate appearance could be
considered his worst of the after
noon — Carver walked.
His next at-bat turned out to
be better. With two outs, Carver
hit a high bouncing grounder
down the first base line which hit
the lip of the infield grass and
skipped between the wickets of
first baseman Pete Zamora for a
fluke double.
Not quite done for the day,
Carver led off the bottom of the
sixth with a line drive down the
right field line. Motoring along
the base path, Carver did not stop
until he reached third.
His final at-bat came in the
next inning. Needing a single to
become the first Stanford batter
to hit for the cycle since 1992,
Carver stepped into the batter's
box with Hinch on first following
a single. Carver promptly
launched his second homer of the
game, a blast over the left field
fence off of junior Jeff Howatt.
The two-run blast gave Carver
five RBIs for the game, the most
since Jed Hansen drove in six

against the Bruins last year.
Carver entered the series with
a .283 batting average and left for
tonight's game against Nevada at
.317. Making a bid for Six-Pac
player of the week, Carver went
8-for-12 during the three games
with a pair of home runs and six
RBIs.
Carver was not the only slug
ger to succeed yesterday. Junior
second baseman Brian Dallimore
went 3-for-5 with three RBIs and
fell a homer short of hitting for
the cycle; Allen and Hinch
reached base on nine of 11 tries.
In the first game of the series,
however, UCLA took care of the
scoring. The Bruins notched
seven early runs en route to the 9-
1 victory. Junior left-hander Dan
Reed completed two and two
thirds innings in his shortest out
ing of the year. Reed gave up six
runs, five of them earned, on five
hits and three walks. The three
ensuing Stanford pitchers, sopho
more Tom Reimers, junior Todd
Bartels and sophomore Mark
Williams each gave up two hits
and one run in their two-plus
innings of work. Reimers worked
the extra third of an inning in
relief of Reed.
The Cardinal hit the two Bruin
pitchers well, garnering 11 hits,
but failed to bunch them together
as freshman left-hander Jim Par
que and freshman Ryan O'Toole
spread the hits around.
The first game, originally
scheduled for Friday, was rained
out and postponed until Satur
day. The doubleheader then actu
ally had a rain delay between
games as the clouds poured down
for approximately 20 minutes.
Today's matchup against Neva
da is also a make-up game. The
Cardinal was scheduled to play the
game on March 28, but snow
forced a postponement. Nevada
defeated Stanford 7-4 in the first
meeting between the two teams
March 7 at Sunken Diamond.
