UCLA 3

For Stanford junior Jim
Thomas, it was the stuff dreams
are made of.
His top-ranked Cardinal
men's tennis team (18-0) stood
deadlocked at three points
apiece with the fourth-ranked
UCLA Bruins (14-3) after eight
matches at the Los Angeles Ten
nis Center last Friday. But there
was plenty of action remaining
in the ninth and deciding match
between the 46th-ranked
Thomas and Bruin Matt Breen.
When all eyes turned toward
their No. 4 singles match, the
two opponents were tied at 1-1
in the third set. Thomas was
aware of his match's impor
tance.
"Those are the kinds of situa
tions you dream of. And you cer
tainly don't dream of losing,"
Thomas said.
Lose he did not. In a neck and
neck battle, Thomas prevailed
on his fifth match point oppor
tunity, 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (12-10) to
preserve the Cardinal's unde
feated record. The match was
even more of a nail-biter
because Thomas fought off five
match points of his own before
finally overtaking the speedy
Breen.
The 6-foot-4-inch Thomas
saved his first match point
when, while serving at 4-5, 30-
40 in the second set, he
unleashed a kick serve with too
much kick for Breen to handle.
After going on to hold serve,
Thomas hit an abnormally high
number of winner returns to
break Breen and go up 6-5, at
which point he served out the

second set.
With Breen, a freshman from
Australia, serving at 5-5 in the
final set of the day, a long break
point was ended with some help
from the Big Cardinal in the
Sky. Thomas hit a topspin lob
winner even though the ball had
left his racquet looking other
wise. The difference was a fortu
itous gust of wind that brought
the ball down right smack onto
the baseline.
But the best was yet to come.
Now leading 6-5, Thomas used
his tremendous serves and vol
leys to build a 40-0 lead. Breen,
however, refused to be flustered
by Thomas' triple match point
opportunity. The Bruin began
his comeback by slicing a back
handed crosscourt return that
was very close to being out.
"It looked in, so I called it
good," said Thomas, "but then I
saw the ball mark 10 seconds
later, and it looked out."
Thomas then missed a back
hand volley to make the score
40-30. On the next point,
Thomas approached the net off
his serve, and was met with a
net court that his reflexes were
barely able to get his Prince
Graphite II racquet on. Breen
responded to Thomas' volley
with a backhand passing shot
that hit the tape once again.
This time, the ball sailed over
Thomas' racquet. Thomas
whirled around and gave chase,
but his desperate backhand was
not enough to usher the ball
over the net. For the third time
during that match point, the
ball hit the Bruin home tape
with a thump and fell to the
