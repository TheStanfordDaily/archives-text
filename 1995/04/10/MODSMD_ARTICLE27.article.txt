Stanford 4
UCLA 3

For Stanford junior Jim
Thomas, it was the stuff dreams
are made of.
His top-ranked Cardinal
men's tennis team (18-0) stood
deadlocked at three points
apiece with the fourth-ranked
UCLA Bruins (14-3) after eight
matches at the Los Angeles Ten
nis Center last Friday. But there
was plenty of action remaining
in the ninth and deciding match
between the 46th-ranked
Thomas and Bruin Matt Breen.
When all eyes turned toward
their No. 4 singles match, the
two opponents were tied at 1-1
in the third set. Thomas was
aware of his match's impor
tance.
"Those are the kinds of situa
tions you dream of. And you cer
tainly don't dream of losing,"
Thomas said.
Lose he did not. In a neck and
neck battle, Thomas prevailed
on his fifth match point oppor
tunity, 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (12-10) to
preserve the Cardinal's unde
feated record. The match was
even more of a nail-biter
because Thomas fought off five
match points of his own before
finally overtaking the speedy
Breen.
The 6-foot-4-inch Thomas
saved his first match point
when, while serving at 4-5, 30-
40 in the second set, he
unleashed a kick serve with too
much kick for Breen to handle.
After going on to hold serve,
Thomas hit an abnormally high
number of winner returns to
break Breen and go up 6-5, at
which point he served out the

second set.
With Breen, a freshman from
Australia, serving at 5-5 in the
final set of the day, a long break
point was ended with some help
from the Big Cardinal in the
Sky. Thomas hit a topspin lob
winner even though the ball had
left his racquet looking other
wise. The difference was a fortu
itous gust of wind that brought
the ball down right smack onto
the baseline.
But the best was yet to come.
Now leading 6-5, Thomas used
his tremendous serves and vol
leys to build a 40-0 lead. Breen,
however, refused to be flustered
by Thomas' triple match point
opportunity. The Bruin began
his comeback by slicing a back
handed crosscourt return that
was very close to being out.
"It looked in, so I called it
good," said Thomas, "but then I
saw the ball mark 10 seconds
later, and it looked out."
Thomas then missed a back
hand volley to make the score
40-30. On the next point,
Thomas approached the net off
his serve, and was met with a
net court that his reflexes were
barely able to get his Prince
Graphite II racquet on. Breen
responded to Thomas' volley
with a backhand passing shot
that hit the tape once again.
This time, the ball sailed over
Thomas' racquet. Thomas
whirled around and gave chase,
but his desperate backhand was
not enough to usher the ball
over the net. For the third time
during that match point, the
ball hit the Bruin home tape
with a thump and fell to the

ground on Thomas' side. Breen
went on to take the game and force
a tie-breaker.
Thomas pulled ahead 5-4 in the
tie-break, but lost points on his
serve twice in a row. Now with
Breen serving for the match at 6-5,
Thomas saved the point. Thomas
did likewise with Breen leading 7-6,
8-7 and 9-8, coming up with huge
serves and huge volleys when the
Cardinal needed them most. He
worked his way to match points at
10-9 and 11-10, finally putting the
match away with a kick serve fol
lowed by a drop-volley crosscourt.
Stanford head coach Dick Gould
simply enjoyed watching his player
duke it out.
"It was like two heavyweights in
the 15th round," Gould said. "Just
when you thought one guy had
come up with a great shot, the
other guy would come up with an
even greater shot."
Thomas is usually a slow and

methodical worker on the court, so
it is never surprising when his is
the last match remaining. What
made the UCLA match different
from most was that his match was
the clincher.
After a sweep in all three doubles
matches, Stanford lost its momen
tum by dropping three of the first
four singles decisions.
The Bruins' 34th-ranked Eric
Taino defeated the 25th-ranked
Scott Humphries, 6-1, 6-3 in No. 2
singles. Humphries' fellow fresh
man, No. 36 Paul Goldstein, also
fell, 6-2, 6-2 to Bruin Justin Giinel
stob in the No. 3 matchup. And in
No. 6 singles, junior Ricky Becker
was defeated by the formidable
forehand of Loren Peters, 6-4, 6-1.
The Cardinal was saved in sin
gles by the play of Thomas, junior
captain Jeff Salzenstein and sopho
more Grant Elliott. Salzenstein,
ranked sixth in the country, kept
his feet moving in ord( r to beat the
16th-ranked Rolx>rt 'anacrk. 6-3,
3-6, 6-3. The super-co r Lent
Elliott won by a similar score over
Eric Lin, 6-4,3-6, 6-3.
The next day's match was at

ninth-ranked USC (12-5). This
time, there was no need for dramat
ics as Stanford prevailed 5-2 to
break a five-match losing streak to
the Trojans dating back to 1993.
The last loss was in the finals of last
year's NCAA Championship.
Salzenstein defeated the fourth
ranked Brett Hansen, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
Humphries suffered a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4
defeat at the hands of 47th-ranked
Adam Peterson. Goldstein
rebounded from a two-match losing
streak with a 6-4, 6-0 drubbing of
No. 57 Lukas Hovorka. Thomas
appeared a little flat after his emo
tionally wrenching match of the
day before, as he succumbed to
Manny Ramirez 7-6, 7-5. Elliott
remained unbeatable, frustrating
Fernando Samayoa 3-6, 6-2, 7-6.
And Ricky Becker used a hot start
to defeat Kyle Spencer, 6-0,4-6,6-3.
The trip to Los Angeles bodes
well for Stanford. This was the
fourth time in 50 years that the
Cardinal has swept USC and UCLA
on the road. In every other of those
years - 1978, 1983 and 1988 -
Stanford went on to win the nation
al championship.

Thomas then missed a back
hand volley to make the score
40-30. On the next point,
Thomas approached the net off
his serve, and was met with a
net court that his reflexes were
barely able to get his Prince
Graphite II racquet on. Breen
responded to Thomas' volley
with a backhand passing shot
that hit the tape once again.
This time, the ball sailed over
Thomas' racquet. Thomas
whirled around and gave chase,
but his desperate backhand was
not enough to usher the ball
over the net. For the third time
during that match point, the
ball hit the Bruin home tape
with a thump and fell to the

ground on Thomas' side. Breen
went on to take the game and force
a tie-breaker.
Thomas pulled ahead 5-4 in the
tie-break, but lost points on his
serve twice in a row. Now with
Breen serving for the match at 6-5,
Thomas saved the point. Thomas
did likewise with Breen leading 7-6,
8-7 and 9-8, coming up with huge
serves and huge volleys when the
Cardinal needed them most. He
worked his way to match points at
10-9 and 11-10, finally putting the
match away with a kick serve fol
lowed by a drop-volley crosscourt.
Stanford head coach Dick Gould
simply enjoyed watching his player
duke it out.
"It was like two heavyweights in
the 15th round," Gould said. "Just
when you thought one guy had
come up with a great shot, the
other guy would come up with an
even greater shot."
Thomas is usually a slow and

methodical worker on the court, so
it is never surprising when his is
the last match remaining. What
made the UCLA match different
from most was that his match was
the clincher.
After a sweep in all three doubles
matches, Stanford lost its momen
tum by dropping three of the first
four singles decisions.
The Bruins' 34th-ranked Eric
Taino defeated the 25th-ranked
Scott Humphries, 6-1, 6-3 in No. 2
singles. Humphries' fellow fresh
man, No. 36 Paul Goldstein, also
fell, 6-2, 6-2 to Bruin Justin Giinel
stob in the No. 3 matchup. And in
No. 6 singles, junior Ricky Becker
was defeated by the formidable
forehand of Loren Peters, 6-4, 6-1.
The Cardinal was saved in sin
gles by the play of Thomas, junior
captain Jeff Salzenstein and sopho
more Grant Elliott. Salzenstein,
ranked sixth in the country, kept
his feet moving in ord( r to beat the
16th-ranked Rolx>rt 'anacrk. 6-3,
3-6, 6-3. The super-co r Lent
Elliott won by a similar score over
Eric Lin, 6-4,3-6, 6-3.
The next day's match was at

ninth-ranked USC (12-5). This
time, there was no need for dramat
ics as Stanford prevailed 5-2 to
break a five-match losing streak to
the Trojans dating back to 1993.
The last loss was in the finals of last
year's NCAA Championship.
Salzenstein defeated the fourth
ranked Brett Hansen, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
Humphries suffered a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4
defeat at the hands of 47th-ranked
Adam Peterson. Goldstein
rebounded from a two-match losing
streak with a 6-4, 6-0 drubbing of
No. 57 Lukas Hovorka. Thomas
appeared a little flat after his emo
tionally wrenching match of the
day before, as he succumbed to
Manny Ramirez 7-6, 7-5. Elliott
remained unbeatable, frustrating
Fernando Samayoa 3-6, 6-2, 7-6.
And Ricky Becker used a hot start
to defeat Kyle Spencer, 6-0,4-6,6-3.
The trip to Los Angeles bodes
well for Stanford. This was the
fourth time in 50 years that the
Cardinal has swept USC and UCLA
on the road. In every other of those
years - 1978, 1983 and 1988 -
Stanford went on to win the nation
al championship.
