# No. 2 spikers allow victory to slip away
## Two-game, five-point lead wasted as MPSF West title hopes dim

Stanford 15 15 14 12 13
BYU 12 11 16 15 15

This weekend in Provo, Utah, the
Stanford men's volleyball team's train of
five straight wins screeched to a grinding
halt. Despite dominating Brigham Young
in almost every statistical category, Stan
ford could not tame the Cougars and fell
15-12, 15-11,14-16, 12-15,13-15.
The Cardinal (16-6 overall, 12-5 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
walked into BYU's riotous gym and won
the first two games in spite of a subpar
performance. Junior swing hitter Mike
Lambert pulled Stanford through these
games with his barrage of kills and jump
serves; Lambert ended the night with a
whopping 43 kills and a .325 hitting aver
age.

"We did not play well enough to beat
BYU on their own court," said Coach
Ruben Nieves. "We won games one and
two, but we didn't play well. We weren't
shutting the door on them."
In the pivotal third game, Stanford led
8-3 but did not restrain the rabid Cougars
(11-7, 10-7 in the MPSF), who charged
back to 13-13. BYU coach Carl McGown
made a key substitution by placing fresh
man swing hitter Steve Hinds in to
receive serve. This stabilized the BYU
side-out game and rendered Stanford's
serving game ineffective. The officials
made two important and controversial
calls against the Cardinal when Stanford
had a chance to take match point. Afler
this demoralizing loss, Stanford faded.
"We really got screwed two times in a
critical part of the match," sophomore

setter Stewart Chong said. "In games
four and five, we just didn't bounce back
— it's hard to regroup when we should
have won."
While Nieves agreed that the officiat
ing affected the outcome of the match, he
pointed out that Stanford placed itself in
a situation where it was vulnerable to bad
calls instead of winning outright.
"When you play on the road, you have
to expect that some calls are going to go
against you — it's just a part of athletics
and you have to deal with it," Nieves
said.
BYU rode the momentum of its come
back game three win to victories in games
four and five. However, throughout the
match, Stanford still outplayed the
Cougars statistically. BYU hit .256, dug
40 balls and collected 25 blocks; the Car
dinal hit .315, dug 73 balls and collected
24 blocks against the top blocking team in
the country. Freshman middle blocker
Keenan Whitehurst blocked 13
balls and swing hitter Tad Hoffman
blocked 10; BYU's Kevin Hambly,
the No. 1 blocker in the nation, only
blocked 9 balls.
Stanford could not find a side
out rhythm all night even though it

is one of the top offensive teams in
the country. Sophomore swing hit
ter Matt Fuerbringer, who put
away 34 kills for a .333 attack aver
age, did not connect well with
Chong out of the back-row. Also,
the Cardinal did not capitalize on
its usually-productive quick attack.
With the loss, the Cardinal falls
one place behind Pacific Division
leader Hawaii and will likely have
to fight through the postseason
tournament with a lower seeding.
