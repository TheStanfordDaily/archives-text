# Arizona State sweeps softball

In what is fast becoming a frustrating journey
through the Pacific 10 Conference, the Stanford soft
ball team (10-20 overall, 1-11 in the Pac-10) dropped
another doubleheader to a league opponent Saturday,
losing to Arizona State by scores of 5-3 and 8-0.
The Stanford squad, whose starting lineup usually
consists of six or seven underclassmen, found itself
overmatched by the more experienced Sun Devils. Ari
zona State outhit the Cardinal in the two games, 26-7.
Nevertheless, Stanford forced the Sun Devils to pull
the first game out in the top of the ninth inning. Ari
zona State began the scoring with a single run in the
top of the third. The Sun Devils added two more in the
top of the fourth, while shutting out Stanford through
five innings.
Just when it appeared that the Cardinal would be in
for another long afternoon at the plate, Stanford
fought back, evening the score with a three-run rally in
the home half of the sixth. Sophomore shortstop Sum
mer Lee, whose six-game hitting streak came to an end
in the game, reached on an error and scored the Cardi
nal's first run.
"It was really big to get that three-spot in the sixth,"
coach Sandy Pearce said. "That really boosted our con
fidence and kept us in the game."
In the top of the seventh, however, Arizona State
came right back with two runs for the game's final mar
gin. Kristin Korb led the Sun Devil offense, going a com
bined 6-for-7 and driving in two runs on the afternoon.
More important than the Sun Devils' 12 hits during

game one, however, were six Cardinal errors that
plagued the defense and starting pitcher Angela Webb.
"Six errors is way too many," said assistant coach
Andy Pearce. "We're just not producing enough [offen
sively] to be able to afford to give away runs."
Carrie Breedlove took the win for ASU, improving
her season record to an impressive 16-5. With the loss,
Webb, the sophomore hurler from Modesto, fell to 4-12
on the year. Forced to pitch both games of every dou
bleheader due to the loss of freshman phenom Jessica
Schulman to a back injury, Webb may be beginning to
show signs of wear and tear.
Arizona State went to work quickly in the nightcap,
scoring two runs off Webb in the top of the first to take
an early 2-0 lead.
"We had trouble shaking off the heartbreaker in the
opener, and we let ourselves get down early,' Sandy
Pearce said. "Unfortunately, it's hard to play catch-up
against these Pac-10 teams."
The Sun Devils took advantage of their early lead
and shut down Stanford's offense, limiting the Cardi
nal to two hits for the contest. Webb (4-13 with the loss
in game two) kept the Cardinal close through four
innings, but Arizona State broke through in the fifth
with six runs. Tina Ruff highlighted the Sun Devil rally
by smacking her second homer of the season.
Roxanne Tsosie (6-2) recorded the win for the Sun
Devils. Arizona State improved to 25-14 overall and 4-
8 in Pac-10 play.
"We could have used (at least a split] before the Ari
zona road trip [this weekend]," Andy Pearce said. "We
still need to work on playing consistently in all phases
of the game."
