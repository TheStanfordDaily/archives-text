# Beagle breakout
## After 'extraordinary' search, lost dog found 
### Kristie Lilje 
It took lots of legwork, piles of
pink paper and a little luck to find
Montana.
Thursday morning, around
7:30, Ethel Steuteville let her four
year-old beagle, Montana, outside
for his usual morning stroll; 10
minutes later, the dog had broken
off the rope and was gone.
Steuteville, awaiting the out
come of her husband Bob's surgery
that day at Stanford Medical Cen
ter, had little time to spare to search
around this unknown campus for
the dog. While the couple perma
nently resides in Rodeo, Calif., they
are traveling around the country in
their five-wheel trailer, now parked
in the Stock Farm Road lot near the
Medical Center. Steuteville had tied

Montana — named after quarter
back Joe Montana — to the trailer
for some fresh air.
Panicked, Steuteville contacted
the Medical Center's Security De
partment to see if anyone could help
her. Then began what security
guard Hugh Mcßride called a "most
extraordinary effort to find this
dog."
Hearing Steuteville's distress in
the security office, Shari Berg, ac
cessibility coordinator for the dis
abled, and her assistant Kristine
Nichols set off to their computers
immediately to print up a flyer de
scribing the lost Montana. The flyer
was quickly distributed around the
Medical Center and surrounding
areas.
