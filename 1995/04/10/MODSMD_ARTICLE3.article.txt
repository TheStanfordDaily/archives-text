# Beagle breakout
## After 'extraordinary' search, lost dog found 
### Kristie Lilje 
It took lots of legwork, piles of
pink paper and a little luck to find
Montana.
Thursday morning, around
7:30, Ethel Steuteville let her four
year-old beagle, Montana, outside
for his usual morning stroll; 10
minutes later, the dog had broken
off the rope and was gone.
Steuteville, awaiting the out
come of her husband Bob's surgery
that day at Stanford Medical Cen
ter, had little time to spare to search
around this unknown campus for
the dog. While the couple perma
nently resides in Rodeo, Calif., they
are traveling around the country in
their five-wheel trailer, now parked
in the Stock Farm Road lot near the
Medical Center. Steuteville had tied

Montana — named after quarter
back Joe Montana — to the trailer
for some fresh air.
Panicked, Steuteville contacted
the Medical Center's Security De
partment to see if anyone could help
her. Then began what security
guard Hugh Mcßride called a "most
extraordinary effort to find this
dog."
Hearing Steuteville's distress in
the security office, Shari Berg, ac
cessibility coordinator for the dis
abled, and her assistant Kristine
Nichols set off to their computers
immediately to print up a flyer de
scribing the lost Montana. The flyer
was quickly distributed around the
Medical Center and surrounding
areas.
Meanwhile, Mcßride was busy
contacting various other organi
zations — such as the Stanford
Department of Public Safety and
the Palo Alto Police Department
— to help in the search.
Steuteville, not wanting to
excite her husband so soon after
his surgery, withheld the infor
mation from him for a while.
After he was told that the dog
was lost, Bob Steuteville recalls
that "everything imaginable that
I thought of doing .. . the police
had already done. If it had been a
lost child, they couldn't have
done any more."
Fortunately, the Steutevilles
received a phone call about 5:30
that evening that their dog had
been found.
Christine Farquhar, wife of
Medicine Prof. John Farquhar,
found the dog wandering in her
garden. After calling Montana's
veterinarian — whose name was
listed on the dog's tag — she
finally hooked up with the
Steutevilles. She and her
daughter Meg returned the dog
to the couple around 6 p.m.
"I'm veiy impressed that we
all got connected. This is the third
dog I've rescued, and I'm glad
that I didn't have to take this one
to the pound," said Farquhar.
Needless to say, the

Steutevilles were not only ecstat
ic to get their dog back, but
thankful for the help of everyone
involved.
"I felt so helpless," explained

Bob Steuteville. "I had just got
ten out of surgery and I couldn't
go look for my dog."
Steuteville added he can never
express his gratitude.

Stanford "is the politest and
kindest place I've ever been,"he
said. "I don't know what I would
have done if I had lost Montana
forever."
