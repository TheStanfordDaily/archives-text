Public masturbator seen
A sex offense that reportedly occurred
at Wilbur Field last week remains
unsolved.
A female student who was sunbathing
on March 31 reported that she observed a
man standing in a bush near the field,
apparently masturbating under his
clothes.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said that no arrests have been made,
despite the description the woman pro
vided of the offender.
The man is white, probably in his mid
-208 to 30s, with brown, wavy hair. He is
described as overweight and was last seen
wearing a blue windbreaker and gray

sweatpants.
Niemeyer indicated that anyone who
sees suspicious behavior by a man of this
description should contact the Stanford
Police.
Child nearly drowns
A child found by his mother floating
face down in Peter Coutts Pool April 2
was taken to Stanford Emergency Hospi
tal and revived.
Benjamin Levoy was semi-conscious
when the Palo Alto Fire Department
arrived. Paramedics transported Levoy to
the hospital, where he received further
treatment and subsequently recovered
fully.

Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said there are a series of questions that
have arisen as a result of the near
drowning. Among them are how the
child was able to get into the pool and
what can be done to increase safety
around it.
The pool is located east of Stanford
Avenue off Peter Coutts Road.
"We're lucky," Niemeyer said. "All's
well that ends well with that one."
Bomb threat at hospital
A man calling for an appointment at
the Stanford Psychiatric Hospital
allegedly threatened to bring a bomb to
Stanford.

Brad Maddox of Sunnyvale called the
hospital on April 4 to make an appoint
ment for a psychiatric exam. The recep
tionist at the hospital, Sally Hayman,
denied him an appointment because his
insurance did not cover it, Stanford
Police Sgt. John McMullen said.
Maddox then allegedly got very angry
and said he was making a bomb in his
kitchen and would bring it to Stanford,
McMullen said. Hayman quoted the
man to police as saying, "I made a bomb
in my kitchen for $40 like the one in
Japan."
Stanford Police immediately contacted
the Sunnyvale Police, who committed
Maddox for a 72-hour hold and a psychi
atric evaluation.

Sleep monitor stolen
A sleep monitoring device has been
reported stolen from the Stanford Psy
chiatric Hospital.
The device, an "Edentrance II" which
is worth $12,000, was last seen on Ja. 15.
The technicians at the hospital thought
the machine had been moved to another
part of the building, said Stanford Police
Sgt. John McMullen.
"The technicians needed it on April 3,
and that is when they noticed that it was
gone, when they couldn't find it,"
McMullen said.
