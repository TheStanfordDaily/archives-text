# Ex-president: Bookstore board encouraged 'generous benefits'
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
The former president of the Stanford Book
store board of directors said the board encour
aged former executives Eldon Speed and Philip
Chiaramonte to accept "generous benefits,"
corroborating claims of a national letter re
questing donations for their legal defense.
Jack Friedenthal, who served on the board
of directors for over 20 years until he left Stan
ford in 1988, said he was "pretty sure" that the
board authorized Speed and Chiaramonte to
purchase vehicles in order to provide trans
portation to a number of lucrative consulting
jobs.
"It was legitimate for them to take certain
benefits that were necessary for the running of
the store," Friedenthal said.
Speed, Chiaramonte and former Bookstore
employee Patrick McDonald each face multiple
counts of grand theft and tax evasion, stem
ming from their allegedly illegal procurement
of perquisites. They face up to eight years in
prison if convicted.
Bookstore executives nationwide are unit
ing behind Chiaramonte and Speed and have

created a fund for their legal defense. A letter
soliciting donations to the fund last month al
leged that the former Bookstore board of direc
tors "encouraged [Speed and Chiaramonte] to
install these 'creative' perquisites."
Profits warranted compensation
In an interview with The Daily on Saturday,
Friedenthal, a Stanford alumnus and former
Stanford law professor who now serves as dean
of the law school at The George Washington
University, rationalized the Bookstore's pur
chase in the mid-1980s of a recreational vehicle
and a vacation home.
"Phil [Chiaramonte] and Eldon [Speed] had
made substantial sums of money through out
side consulting which they didn't have to do.
But they said they would like to use that money
for the benefit of themselves and their fellow
employees," Friedenthal said.
"And so those things that involve those
funds we would have considered legitimately
used for perks," he said.
In criminal charges against the former offi
cials filed March 16, the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's office, however, cites IRS


Speed
records in alleging that Speed and
Chiaramonte's consulting compa
ny, Colleagues Management Ser
vices, earned no consulting income
from 1986 to 1992. The consulting
firm's only client between 1982
and 1986 was UC-San Francisco,
the criminal report says.
"Initially, they purchased a
recreational vehicle to be checked
out to people, and it didn't work
out well because it was big and
hard to maneuver and people felt
that not as many people used it,"
Friedenthal said. "The notion was
to take the money that they had
put into that and to put it into a
vacation place — one which I never
visited or saw — in the Foothills
and that would be usable as a vaca
tion place for the working people.
"As we were concerned, it
would be all employees that would
have an opportunity to use it,"he
said.
Friedenthal said Speed and
Chiaramonte's intentions were
good and no charges should be
brought against them.
"They were penalized enough
when the civil matter occurred,"
he said. This year Speed, Chiara
monte and McDonald were
ordered to pay $1 million, funded
by their insurance, to the Book
store in a civil suit settlement.

"If someone's arguing that they
should not have taken cars, that
would be foolishness," Friedenthal
said. "To the extent that I knew
and the members of the board
knew that they had vehicles that
they could use for going from one
place to the other, this is not
unusual or unprecedented."
However, he said he doubted
that the makes and models of the
cars — which included Cadillacs,
an Infiniti and a Chevrolet Subur
ban — were discussed by the
board.
The criminal charges accuse
Speed, Chiaramonte and McDon
ald of purchasing the vacation
home with Bookstore funds while
telling the board of directors that
personal funds were used.
Friedenthal, however, claims
that because of Speed and Chiara
monte's successes in building the
Bookstore to "not only one of the
best college bookstores, |but] one
of the best bookstores in America,"
the perks that they received were
appropriate.
"They needed adequate com
pensation given the size of what
the Bookstore had become,"
Friedenthal said. "Therefore we
did provide and encourage a num
ber of specific types of benefits,
none of which I think were wrong
or incorrect in any way."
But Law Prof. Robert Weisberg,
the board's current spokesman,
claimed it remains uncertain
whether the board encouraged the

executives.
"There wasn't a good structure
for the board to give the managers
all the guidance they needed," he
said. "Different members might
have known of [the perquisites] to
different degrees."
Weisberg declined to comment
on the merits of criminal charges.
A unique structure
National bookstore executives
say the unusual organization of
the Bookstore contributes to many
unanswered questions about its
management and how rules —
such as accepting and dispensing
perquisites — are made and autho
rized.
Stanford's bookstore, they say,
is unlike any other national college
bookstore. The Bookstore is a non
profit corporation run by a board
of directors composed mainly of
professors, meaning employees
and board members could exercise
more liberties than a private or
university-owned bookstore.
Pam Mills, head of the book
store at lowa State University,
said a public school's bookstore
"works to the advantage of the
university" because any profit
which the bookstore accumulates
is taken by the university and not
always used for bookstore costs.
Privately-owned bookstores
usually give a greater degree of
incentives and perquisites, she
said.
The Stanford Bookstore falls

directly in the middle of the public
private spectrum. "Stanford was
quite frankly somewhat unique,"
said Garis Distelhorst, executive
director of the National Associa
tion of College Stores. The Book
store "is kind of an in-between —
it's kind of private but it's not," he
said.
"I answer to a vice president,"
Mills said. "The Stanford Book
store answered to a board. That
board was the one that allowed,
approved and created such perks
— it was not Phil or Eldon saying,
'Oh I think I'll buy a new car.' "
Friedenthal said the Book
store's unique structure is an
advantage. He lauded the amount
of flexibility the board has in han
dling Bookstore affairs, a liberty
which would not be granted if the
store were controlled by the Uni
versity or another supervisory
organization.
However, he added that
because the board of directors is
composed mainly of professors, the
business aspect is often lost.
"We didn't run it like a series of
businessmen run a business,"
Friedenthal said. "We were inter
ested in the quality of the books
and what we offered. I have always
felt that it is one of the great
stores."
Because of the liberties, he said,
"we as a board could have, and in
effect did, give [Speed and Chiara
montel the green light to do a
great many things."
