# Ex-president: Bookstore board encouraged 'generous benefits'
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
The former president of the Stanford Book
store board of directors said the board encour
aged former executives Eldon Speed and Philip
Chiaramonte to accept "generous benefits,"
corroborating claims of a national letter re
questing donations for their legal defense.
Jack Friedenthal, who served on the board
of directors for over 20 years until he left Stan
ford in 1988, said he was "pretty sure" that the
board authorized Speed and Chiaramonte to
purchase vehicles in order to provide trans
portation to a number of lucrative consulting
jobs.
"It was legitimate for them to take certain
benefits that were necessary for the running of
the store," Friedenthal said.
Speed, Chiaramonte and former Bookstore
employee Patrick McDonald each face multiple
counts of grand theft and tax evasion, stem
ming from their allegedly illegal procurement
of perquisites. They face up to eight years in
prison if convicted.
Bookstore executives nationwide are unit
ing behind Chiaramonte and Speed and have

created a fund for their legal defense. A letter
soliciting donations to the fund last month al
leged that the former Bookstore board of direc
tors "encouraged [Speed and Chiaramonte] to
install these 'creative' perquisites."
Profits warranted compensation
In an interview with The Daily on Saturday,
Friedenthal, a Stanford alumnus and former
Stanford law professor who now serves as dean
of the law school at The George Washington
University, rationalized the Bookstore's pur
chase in the mid-1980s of a recreational vehicle
and a vacation home.
"Phil [Chiaramonte] and Eldon [Speed] had
made substantial sums of money through out
side consulting which they didn't have to do.
But they said they would like to use that money
for the benefit of themselves and their fellow
employees," Friedenthal said.
"And so those things that involve those
funds we would have considered legitimately
used for perks," he said.
In criminal charges against the former offi
cials filed March 16, the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's office, however, cites IRS
