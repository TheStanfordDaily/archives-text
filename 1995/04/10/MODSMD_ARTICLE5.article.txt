# Letter sent to bookstore execs appeals for funds
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Numerous national bookstore officials,
including a former president of the Stan
ford Bookstore board of directors, have
come to the defense of former Bookstore
executives Philip Chiaramonte and Eldon
Speed since they were arrested March 16.
In a March 27 letter, four colleagues of
Speed and Chiaramonte exhorted national
bookstore executives to contribute to a
legal defense fund for Speed and Chiara
monte.
The letter was sent to 3,000 bookstore
executives, including the mailing list of the
National Association of College Stores.
Garis Distelhorst, executive director of
the association and a signatory to there-
quest, said he is convinced of Speed
and Chiaramonte's innocence
based on their characters and rep
utations.
"We're not in a position to
judge," he said. "We just know
the individuals. It's hard for any
of us to believe that [they] would
have done anything illegal on pur
pose."
Distelhorst echoed concerns
that criminal charges should not
have been filed after Bookstore and
state audits failed to produce any
obvious violations.
Speed, Chiaramonte and former
Bookstore controller Patrick
McDonald are charged with multi
ple counts of grand theft and tax
evasion.
Jack Friedenthal, who served as
president of the Bookstore board of
directors for 14 years until he left
Stanford in 1988, said he "might

very well" donate to the support
fund. "If they [included me] I
would certainly consider it favor
ably," he said.
Speed is currently working with
Cal State-Northridge toward cen
tralizing bookstores in Southern
California. Chiaramonte heads the
bookstore at the University of
Southern California.
One signatory to the letter,
however, admitted to being unin
formed about the case and said he
knew neither Speed nor Chiara
monte.
The other signatories "just
needed a vendor [to sign the letter]
more than anything," said Dick
Kremer of the Southern Califor
nia-based Kremer and Associates.
Kremer's company supplies books
to many bookstores throughout
the nation.
However, Kremer exemplified
the unity that this case has
brought in the bookstore industry.
"I would help out anyone in the
college store industry," Kremer
said. "I think it's necessary."
