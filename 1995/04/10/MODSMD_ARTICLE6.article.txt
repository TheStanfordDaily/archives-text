IBM's recent $1 million donation in new
equipment and research grants to the Uni
versity will benefit Stanford scholars in the
fields of computer science, electrical engi
neering and physics.
The donation brings IBM's total contri
butions to Stanford in the past two years to
$2.5 million.
In a statement, Dean of Research
Charles Kruger called the relationship be
tween IBM and Stanford a model of cooper
ation between private firms and the Uni
versity.
It "promises to be a model for effective
university-industry interaction and has
been handled promptly with a minimal

amount of paperwork," said Kruger.
The grants include nearly $900,000 in
equipment, more than $90,000 in aid for
graduate students and approximately
$50,000 in cash for departmental grants.
Chemistry Prof. Hans C. Andersen is
one of the researchers who will benefit from
the grant. The UNIX workstations he will
receive are "nice, powerful machines"
which will help in research of chemical re
actions, he said.
"The machines will be used to find meth
ods for calculating rates of chemical reac
tions from the knowledge of the forces be
tween atoms and molecules," said Ander
sen.
Andersen said his research was not di-
rected at producing any part icular
result or solution, but added that
he hoped the research would pro
duce new methods and algorithms
that could be used in a broad array
of applications.
Workstations have been given
to three other professors: John
CiofTi, associate professor of elec
trical engineering; Robert Dutton,
professor of electrical engineering
and research director of the Cen
ter for Integrated Systems; and
George Homsy, chair of the Chem
ical Engineering Department, for
use in Stanford's Center for Poly

mer Interface and Macromolecu
lar Assemblies.
The University also awarded
fellowships to six graduate stu
dents: Navin Chaddha, Krista
Jacobsen and Susan Lin, all stu
dents in electrical engineering;
Marcus Grote in mathematics;
Alex Poon of the information sci
ences program; and Leonid
Pryadko of the Physics Depart
ment.
Rajeev Motwani, assistant pro
fessor of computer science, and
Tom Lee, assistant professor of
electrical engineering, were both
awarded a departmental grant to
purchase a high-speed digitizing
signal analyzer for use in studying
broad-band wireless communica
tions.
