IBM's recent $1 million donation in new
equipment and research grants to the Uni
versity will benefit Stanford scholars in the
fields of computer science, electrical engi
neering and physics.
The donation brings IBM's total contri
butions to Stanford in the past two years to
$2.5 million.
In a statement, Dean of Research
Charles Kruger called the relationship be
tween IBM and Stanford a model of cooper
ation between private firms and the Uni
versity.
It "promises to be a model for effective
university-industry interaction and has
been handled promptly with a minimal

amount of paperwork," said Kruger.
The grants include nearly $900,000 in
equipment, more than $90,000 in aid for
graduate students and approximately
$50,000 in cash for departmental grants.
Chemistry Prof. Hans C. Andersen is
one of the researchers who will benefit from
the grant. The UNIX workstations he will
receive are "nice, powerful machines"
which will help in research of chemical re
actions, he said.
"The machines will be used to find meth
ods for calculating rates of chemical reac
tions from the knowledge of the forces be
tween atoms and molecules," said Ander
sen.
Andersen said his research was not di-
