## 
### Pamela Phan Contributing writer 
In a move designed to make top special
ty care provided by the Stanford Medical
Center more accessible to the Bay Area
community, the Coastside Medical Clinic
in Half Moon Bay became a part of Stan
ford Health Services (SHS) on April 1,
changing its name to Stanford Coastside
Medical Clinic.
The purchase went into effect after six
months of "on-and-off negotiations, ac
cording to Peter Gregory, chief medical of
ficer of SHS and associate dean of the Med
ical Center.
"It is a business operation and a patient
care operation," Gregory added.
The clinic was established in 1985 and
consists of six family physicians, a Stan

ford-trained physician assistant and sever
al other staff members. Since the purchase,
it has continued to operate at 225 South
Cabrillo Highway with existing physicians
and staff.
Stanford provides the clinic with facili
ties and specialty care that it did not have
access to before.
"We expect to put specialists of our own
on-site," Gregory said.
"These on-site services — and our ex
tended hours and walk-in hours — afford
our patients convenient access to top-qual
ity care in as convenient a manner as possi
ble," said Dr. Larry Casalino, a family
physician at the clinic.
Stanford will also benefit from the
arrangement.
"We don't have a lot of primary
care physicians," Gregory said.
"With the national emphasis on
medical school education, [the
clipic] will serve as an additional
site where we can teach."
He added that it will provide
valuable ambulatory experience
for Stanford's medical trainees.
The clinic will also act as an
excellent referral service, Gregory
said.
Stanford Health Services, an
organization formed last Septem
ber to coordinate health-care at
the Medical Center, played a

major role in the negotiations.
Its duty was to make sure that
the deal succeeded and was satis
factory to Stanford, to the clinic
and to the clinic's patients, Grego
ry said.
Prior to this purchase, Stan
ford joined with the Redwood
Medical Group in Redwood City
and the Menlo Medical Clinic in
Menlo Park, said Anne Fyfe,
director of network development
for Stanford Health Services.
The purchase of Coastside is
"the latest in a series of moves in
which Stanford has sought to
build a network that can provide
local, high-quality primary care
with links to the top specialty care
available at Stanford Medical
Center," Fyfe added.
