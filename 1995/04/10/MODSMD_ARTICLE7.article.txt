## 
### Pamela Phan Contributing writer 
In a move designed to make top special
ty care provided by the Stanford Medical
Center more accessible to the Bay Area
community, the Coastside Medical Clinic
in Half Moon Bay became a part of Stan
ford Health Services (SHS) on April 1,
changing its name to Stanford Coastside
Medical Clinic.
The purchase went into effect after six
months of "on-and-off negotiations, ac
cording to Peter Gregory, chief medical of
ficer of SHS and associate dean of the Med
ical Center.
"It is a business operation and a patient
care operation," Gregory added.
The clinic was established in 1985 and
consists of six family physicians, a Stan

ford-trained physician assistant and sever
al other staff members. Since the purchase,
it has continued to operate at 225 South
Cabrillo Highway with existing physicians
and staff.
Stanford provides the clinic with facili
ties and specialty care that it did not have
access to before.
"We expect to put specialists of our own
on-site," Gregory said.
"These on-site services — and our ex
tended hours and walk-in hours — afford
our patients convenient access to top-qual
ity care in as convenient a manner as possi
ble," said Dr. Larry Casalino, a family
physician at the clinic.
Stanford will also benefit from the
arrangement.
