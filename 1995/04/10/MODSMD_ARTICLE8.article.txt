In making the transition from Stanford to a public el
ementary school in Long Beach, Calif., 1992 graduate
Michael Simon had no idea what to expect from his first
year with Teach For America.
"I really tried not to be a Stanford graduate, going in
on my little white horse to save the ghetto," he said.
After only six weeks in an emergency licensing and ori
entation program run by Teach For America — which
was developed in 1989 by Princeton undergraduate
Wendy Kopp in her senior thesis — selected applicants
are placed in schools in any of 15 different locations
across the country, from New York City to East Palo Alto.
