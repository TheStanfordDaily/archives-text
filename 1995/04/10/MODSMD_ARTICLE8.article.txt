# Grads learn to teach America
## 
### Blair Lawson Contributing writer 
In making the transition from Stanford to a public el
ementary school in Long Beach, Calif., 1992 graduate
Michael Simon had no idea what to expect from his first
year with Teach For America.
"I really tried not to be a Stanford graduate, going in
on my little white horse to save the ghetto," he said.
After only six weeks in an emergency licensing and ori
entation program run by Teach For America — which
was developed in 1989 by Princeton undergraduate
Wendy Kopp in her senior thesis — selected applicants
are placed in schools in any of 15 different locations
across the country, from New York City to East Palo Alto.

The corps members commit two
years to teach in urban and rural
public schools that traditionally
suffer from teaching shortages.
"No program could possibly pre
pare you," admitted Simon, now in
his third year teaching elementary
school in Long Beach. "The first
year was like trial by fire. It was
like walking into a mine field."
John Griscavage, who graduated
in 1993 and now teaches in the Mis
sissippi Delta, said he, too, faced the
challenge of unpreparedness his
first year. "I don't think there's
anything Teach For America can
do to prepare you. Kids expect you
to have a handle on things like any
other veteran teacher."
Tamika Westfield, a 1994 Stan
ford graduate in her first year
teaching middle school in Comp
ton, Calif., agreed that the first

year is usually the toughest. "I'm
going through the battle now," she
said, referring to the challenge of
being a new teacher. "The scariest
thing was realizing that I'm actual
ly their teacher ... now I'm their
real teacher."
Stanford graduates in the pro
gram generally conveyed attitudes
about their Teach For America
experiences which, while grounded
and realistic, were also inspiringly
positive.
"Every year that I'm doing it
these kids are extremely special to
me," Simon said. "I don't know if
I'm ever going to have such a real
impact on real people's lives. I have
these kids who are expecting me to
help them."
While pointing out the possible
problem that "people go in with no
concept of what they're doing,"
Simon asserted that without the
corps, "A lot of quality people who
are in the schools wouldn't be
there."
Westfield teaches seventh- and

eighth-grade science and pre?-alge
bra math. In all, she teaches more
than 100 students and sometimes
encounters discipline problems.
"We have no recourse as teach
ers," she noted, referring to the
fact that her school no longer sus
pends students. "It's just a few
bad apples making it hard for
you."
In contrast to those corps mem
bers teaching in urban areas,
Griscavage requested to be located
in the Mississippi Delta because, as
he pointed out, "you can't deny the
need in rural areas."
Teaching ninth- and tenth
grade English in rural Tunica has
allowed Griscavage to become
involved in the community as well
as in the school. "It's not just any
old job," he said. "It is your life for
two years."
In addition to a general feeling
of unpreparedness, corps members
cited the resistance of school
administrators as a frustrating
barrier to teacher creativity.

"It's so disheartening," West
field said. "I believed that every
thing was about the kids. It's not
about the kids. It's about politics at
the administrative level. That's
what really brought me down. It's
not for the kids, it's politics."
Todd Russell, a 1994 Stanford
graduate teaching seventh-grade
geography and ninth-grade local
history in Washington, D.C., had
extensive difficulties with the
Washington, public school
administration. "I'm like the
poster child for Teach For Amer
ica," said Russell, who has been
relocated twice because of
"mess-ups in the D.C. bureau
cracy."
Now at his third school in seven
months, Russell said he continues
to feel thwarted by the administra
tion within his school. "A lot of the
administrators come in with the
idea of finding fault with what
you're doing," he said.
"It's a real battle," noted
Griscavage, who encountered resis

tance from the administration
when he and another Teach For
America teacher organized the first
musical ever in their school, an
"ethnic twist on 'A Christmas
Carol' " entitled "Christmas is
Coming Uptown."
"The better we did, the worse
we made them look," Griscavage
observed. "We went in with a lot of
enthusiasm and really shook
things up."
Another major problem for the
teachers is the lack of school
resources. Westfield, who foots the
bill for many activities in the class
room, called her instruction "sci
ence on a shoestring."
In the Mississippi Delta, which
Jesse Jackson once referred to as
"America's Ethiopia," Griscavage
claimed to have seen very little of
the money allotted to public
schools from Mississippi's new
casinos. "I had to paint my own
room at the beginning of the year,"
he remembered.
Some corps members said they

acknowledge problems within the
concept and structure of the pro
gram. Westfield said she feels that
the Teach For America premise,
which assumes that "well-to-do,
middle-class kids from the sub
urbs" are the "best and brightest"
and therefore best equipped to deal
with the problems encountered in
low-income school districts, is "a
little shady."
Nevertheless, she acknowledges
unequivocally that Teach For
America corps members are "mak
ing a difference in those kids'
lives."
"Teach For America wastes a lot
of resources," Griscavage noted.
"They need to really, really reorga
nize themselves," he added.
All the same, Griscavage's atti
tude is also pervaded by unflagging
optimism. "If more people would
do something like I've done, I think
we'd have a more compassionate
society. I've seen stuff down here
that would blow the socks off Newt
Gingrich," he said.
