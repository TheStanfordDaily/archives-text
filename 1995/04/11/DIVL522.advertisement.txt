Strategies for Standardized Tksts in a Diverse World
Strategy # 11...n*: Take Our Course
A lot of the strategies we've developed can't be explained in a newpaper
ad. In fact, there arc quite a few strategies that we wouldn't want the test
makers to lcam about too quickly.
As you take our course, you'll discuss strategics with a teacher in a small
classroom setting. Many strategies began with the insight of one student that
we later identified as a pattern. You might inspire the next breakthrough!
