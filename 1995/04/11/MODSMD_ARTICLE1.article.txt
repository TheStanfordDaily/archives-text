# The
						rap on frats
## Members, profs discuss pros, cons of group identity 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
By breaking into University
buildings, driving golf carts
through windows and illegally
lighting bonfires, fraternities
have come under review over the
past year.
Although only a few members
of each fraternity were actually
responsible for the incidents,
some people have raised questions
about the influence of Greek orga
nizations over their members.
Sociology Prof. Joseph Berger
and Psychology Prof. Lee Ross,
who have studied group theory,
both say that as groups fraterni
ties can exert forms of social con
trol over their members.
Groups like fraternities, Berg
er said, "have a set of norms, val
ues and beliefs." There is a "sub
tle and indirect pressure to adhere
to those," he added.
Ross, who has never studied
fraternities themselves, agreed
that "people certainly feel some
pressure to be liked and accepted
by fraternity brothers. ... To
some extent there is some direct
and indirect pressure" by frater
nities, he added.
Fraternities are also subject to
pluralistic ignorance, Ross said. It
is very hard for a person to break
out of a group when an entire
group follows the same lead, he
explained.
According to Ross, there is also
a "tendency in male groups for
males to try and outdo each
other." He added that women are
"not as likely to take the form of
aggressive behavior."
This can be traced, Ross said,
to male proclivities in groups
since males tend to act more
macho and aggressive. There are
also some more subtle changes
when individuals enter into a fra
ternity, Ross added, explaining
that people can change their defi
nitions of right and wrong when
they enter into a fraternity.
