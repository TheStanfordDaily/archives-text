# The 						rap on frats
## Members, profs discuss pros, cons of group identity 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
By breaking into University
buildings, driving golf carts
through windows and illegally
lighting bonfires, fraternities
have come under review over the
past year.
Although only a few members
of each fraternity were actually
responsible for the incidents,
some people have raised questions
about the influence of Greek orga
nizations over their members.
Sociology Prof. Joseph Berger
and Psychology Prof. Lee Ross,
who have studied group theory,
both say that as groups fraterni
ties can exert forms of social con
trol over their members.
Groups like fraternities, Berg
er said, "have a set of norms, val
ues and beliefs." There is a "sub
tle and indirect pressure to adhere
to those," he added.
Ross, who has never studied
fraternities themselves, agreed
that "people certainly feel some
pressure to be liked and accepted
by fraternity brothers. ... To
some extent there is some direct
and indirect pressure" by frater
nities, he added.
Fraternities are also subject to
pluralistic ignorance, Ross said. It
is very hard for a person to break
out of a group when an entire
group follows the same lead, he
explained.
According to Ross, there is also
a "tendency in male groups for
males to try and outdo each
other." He added that women are
"not as likely to take the form of
aggressive behavior."
This can be traced, Ross said,
to male proclivities in groups
since males tend to act more
macho and aggressive. There are
also some more subtle changes
when individuals enter into a fra
ternity, Ross added, explaining
that people can change their defi
nitions of right and wrong when
they enter into a fraternity.
Ross also said that in a study of
eating clubs at Princeton Univer
sity there was a tendency to see
one's own group as variable and
other groups as homogenous.
"You expect to see this in fraterni
ties," he said.
In order to curb the group
behavior of fraternities, Stanford
judges fraternities on the princi
ple of collective responsibility: If
fraternity members are caught
breaking rules, the entire organi
zation is held responsible.
According to Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Heather Dunn, this is
because a fraternity is given "the
privilege to selectively select
members. With that privilege [of
choosing members] comes an
added responsibility."
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Delta
Tau Delta and Beta Theta Pi were
all subject to the collective respon
sibility principle when their mem
bers got in trouble. The Universi
ty still has not decided whether
the Betas — several of whom

allegedly broke into the Stanford
Art Museum over spring break —
will go on social probation.
The Delta were in danger of
losing their house earlier this year
as a result of excessive damage to
the building, including driving a
golf cart through a window. SAE
also faced social probation when
members lit a bonfire in their
backyard after being warned
against doing so.
The idea of collective responsi
bility, however, concerns some fra
ternity members. Junior Trey
Stolz, president of the Interfrater
nity Council, said when a discipline
problem arises the University
should look at whether the frater
nity was truly responsible for its
members, adding that Stanford is
sometimes too quick to judge.
Ross agreed, saying that, for
criminal matters, a group like a fra
ternity should not necessarily be
judged by collective responsibility.
However, that is not true of civil
and financial matters, Ross said.
Other fraternity presidents,
however, disagreed. Senior Cyd
Zeigler, president of Theta Delta
Chi, said the policy is effective
although sometimes misapplied.

Sigma Nu president Jeff Baird,
a senior, said it was difficult to
judge: "I see argument behind it
and arguments against it .. . but
it is a vexy difficult standard to be
held to."
Dunn said a fraternity should
simply choose members who are
not going to get into trouble. A
strong fraternity is also less likely
to see problems, Dunn added, cit
ing the success of SAE and its
internal systems of checks and
balances on its members.
According to Stolz, a member
of SAE, strong members are pre
cisely what his fraternity will seek
during Rush, which began last
night. "We definitely don't want
someone who's going to be in
trouble in the future."
But members stressed that fra
ternities don't deserve their trou
ble-maker reputations. According
to Zeigler, members of his frater
nity do a lot of good for the East
Palo Alto community, such as
working with children and ele
mentary schools.
Ross, however, said "fraterni
ties organize and do positive
things but can be a vehicle to do
negative things."
