# Students join to fight Contract, Prop 187
## 
### Tristan Sorah Reyes Contributing writer 
Last quarter, a small group of students
decided to go beyond the ivory tower of Stan
ford to deal with the issues facing this coun
try.
Now calling itself RAGE (a convoluted
acronym for Resistance Action orGanizing
Education), the group of about 15 members is
hosting an open campus meeting tonight at 5
p.m. in the Asian American Activities Center
to discuss ways to fight the GOP's "Contract
With America."
Sophomore Vanessa Frank, a RAGE mem
ber, said the group actually grew out of the
fight against California Proposition 187, a
measure to deny social services to illegal
immigrants which voters passed in the
November election.
Many of the students who worked togeth
er against the proposition found themselves
with energy for another fight and are now
focusing their efforts on the "Contract With
America" as well as continuing to fight the

effects of Proposition 187.
RAGE organizers consider the group pro
gressive and liberal and boast that there are
no leaders or followers, only members.
"RAGE does not have any leaders, presi
dents or directors; everyone is simply a mem
ber," said senior Abdi Soltani, a RAGE mem
ber. Soltani estimated that at least 30 people
have expressed serious interest in the group.
According to Soltani, RAGE has two main
objectives — to provide a forum for student
debate on intellectual and social issues and to
choose specific issues that are often ignored
on campus in order to educate the Stanford
community.
"The group is awesome and long over
due," said graduate student Greg Barnes.
"There are too many groups in isolation and
not working together on the problems of soci
ety. That is the whole point of the group, to
bring together these different groups."
Frank said RAGE members would like to
get individuals from all groups on campus
working together, especially in fighting the
Republican "Contract With America,"

because the issues the contract raises affect
everyone.
"There are a lot of issues within the 'Con
tract With America' that we are concerned
about, such as the effects that it will have on
the poor, women, people on welfare and envi
ronmental laws," said Soltani.
"I have to give Newt Gingrich credit: He
wanted to create a revolution and he has, but
it's just not the revolution that I wanted v "
Frank added.
According to Barnes, most members of
RAGE are simultaneously working on other
issues — varying from ethnic studies and
affirmative action to environmental issues.
"I've been in a lot of groups on campus and
this one has a lot of strength, especially with
in its members, who are people with a lot of
experience in dealing with the issues,"
Soltani said.
"This is the sort of group that if an issue
arises we would be there to help," added
Frank. "We are a group that is willing to deal
with all issues involving all groups. RAGE
shows that we can all work together."
