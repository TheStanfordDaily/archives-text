## Dole announces candidacy 
### 
EXETER, N.H. (AP) -
Embracing a conservative agenda
of lower taxes, smaller govern
ment and a balanced budget, Bob
Dole launched his third White
House bid yesterday by casting
himself as uniquely qualified to
"lead America back to her place in
the sun."
"I am not afraid to lead, and I
know the way," the Senate major
ity leader said, formally declaring
his candidacy for the 1996 Repub
lican presidential nomination in
the Kansas capital of Topeka,
where he began his political career
in the legislature 40 years ago.
Then it was off to New Hamp
shire, where his 1988 bid was
derailed after a victory in the lowa
caucuses. This time, Dole sought
to remedy a position on taxes he
blamed for his 1988 defeat.
As he addressed a large crowd
in Exeter, his campaign revealed
that Dole had signed a pledge not
to raise income taxes — the very
pledge Dole was criticized by
George Bush and others for refus
ing to sign in 1988.
Dole, 71, entered the race with

a scornful critique of President
Clinton as a "clever apologist of
the status quo," elected on a plat
form of change in 1992 but now
fighting the change voters
demanded last year when they put
Congress in Republican hands for
the First time in 40 years.
In addition to reaching out to
economic conservatives on taxes,
Dole made entreaties to Christian
conservatives powerful in GOP
affairs, questioning the need for
federal funding of arts and
humanities.
In the months ahead, Dole's
age will certainly be an issue. He
will be 73 by the 1996 election, an
age reached by an elected presi
dent only by Ronald Reagan, cho
sen for his second term.
So as he began his quest, Dole
sought to turn his age to an
advantage over GOP rivals
untested on the national stage —
and a baby-boomer president
whose leadership skills have
repeatedly been called into ques
tion.
Looking to prove his commit
ment to conservative causes, Dole

promised enactment of the line
item veto and a balanced-budget
amendment, a tax credit for fami
lies and a cut in the capital gains
tax. Looking ahead, Dole said the
entire federal tax system needed
to be made "fairer, flatter, sim
pler."
He advocated eliminating four
Cabinet departments: Commerce,
Education, Energy and Housing.
And he promised a review of every
federal program to determine if it
met this test: "Is this program a
basic function of limited govern
ment or is it an example of how
government has lost faith in the
judgment of our people?"
Over his nearly 35 years in
Congress, many Republicans have
suggested Dole has had too much
faith in government. "Tax collec
tor for the welfare state" was the
label once put on Dole by Rep.
Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
Begging to differ with such
characterizations, Dole said he
lived by this parental guidance:
"Put trust in God, not govern
ment, and never confuse the
two."
