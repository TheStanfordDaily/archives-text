## Brandeis student dies from blast injuries

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) â€” In a
move that could push Palestinians closer to
civil war, Yasser Arafat cracked down on
Islamic militants yesterday after suicide
bombings killed seven Israelis and an Amer
ican college student.
Arafat's security forces arrested 112 fol
lowers of Hamas and the smaller Islamic
Jihad after Sunday's deadly back-to-back
bombings near two Jewish settlements in
the PLO-ruled Gaza Strip.
"If [Arafat] practices this behavior, we
will defend ourselves by all means," warned
Mahmoud Zahar, a leader of Hamas.
Despite the tensions and anger, Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin told negotia
tors to resume talks with the Palestine Lib

eration Organization on arranging Palestini
an elections and an Israeli troop pullback to
allow Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank.
The bombings wounded more than 40
people. Two of them died yesterday, includ
ing Alisa M. Flatow, a 20-year-old junior at
Brandeis University on vacation for
Passover. She was wounded in the head
while traveling to a beach resort at a Jewish
settlement in the Gaza Strip
After doctors declared her brain dead,
Alisa's father, Steve, authorized an opera
tion to remove organs for donation. In a
statement, he said his daughter loved Israel
and "her lasting contribution to the people of
Israel is that her organs were donated for the
saving of lives in need."
