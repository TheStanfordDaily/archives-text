Yale student expelled
NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) — A Yale University senior
was expelled one month before graduation and charged with
accepting more than $10,000 in financial aid under false pre
tenses by allegedly lying on his admission application.
University police arrested Lon Grammer on Thursday
in his campus room. He was released on his own recog
nizance for arraignment today.
"He applied for different grants to pay for his college
tuition, and we were able to find that he was not who he
portrayed ' olf to be," said James Perrotti, assistant
chief of campus police. "There were a number of fraudu
lent records."
The 25-y ! from Brentwood, Calif., was charged
with first-degree larceny, which means theft of at least
$10,000. Campus police wouldn't give the exact amount of

financial aid involved.
Free air time, Murdoch says
LAS VEGAS (AP) — Fox Inc. Chairman Rupert Murdoch
urged broadcasters yesterday to provide free air time to polit
ical candidates, a wildly unpopular notion in the TV industry.
"We don't need the money," he told several hundred
broadcasting executives at the National Association of
Broadcasters convention.
About 95 percent of the money raised by political candi
dates goes to buying advertisements, he said. "It's really a
scandal and we are the beneficiaries of it."
For years, campaign reform legislation has been offered
in Congress that would require broadcasters to provide
free air time. The broadcasting industry has successfully
fought against each proposal.
