## Classes on the Web 
### 
SELECTED STANFORD stu
dents are now experiencing
an unusual event — a class in
which the syllabus, all homework
and readings are available only on
the World Wide Web. Five lectures
a week are also given.
The class — Industrial Engi
neering 275 — intends to teach
students about information sys
tems for business and "managing
in cyberspace." With this purpose,
it should be a very useful learning
tool to require students to use the
Web as an integral part of the
class. We applaud the professor,
Behnam Tabrizi, and others
involved in the class for their cre
ativity.
At the same time, students and
teachers alike should be wary.
Electronic classes, like all newfan
gled gizmos, can be shiny and pret
ty and fun to play with. If not kept
in check, however, they could seri
ously damage college education.
Already many courses are
broadcast over television. Soon, a

student may be able to complete a
Stanford degree by only sitting in
front of a TV or computer screen.
This would only damage the
value of a university, especially
StanfGi J. Stanford prides itself on
the ideals 01 residential education,
learning through interacting and
community. It is more difficult, if
not impossible, to attain all these
goals without good, old-fashioned
human contact.
Students and faculty alike come
to Stanford for real education. For
contact and conflict and the rub
bing of mind against mind. Most
often, these things are best done in
person. Indeed, Prof. Tabrizi still
sees the value in giving lectures.
So we must be wary and limit
on-line classes to those areas of
knowledge in which computer-use
is demanded. Americans are
already complaining about a
slovenly generation of youth suck
led on the boob tube. Let's be care
ful not to move this trend into
higher education.
