# Women in the house
## 
### 
Sometimes, sexism involves
keeping women in the house.
At Stanford, it has involved
keeping them out of the house.
Sorority houses, that is.
Fortunately, all that may change
soon.
The University gave sororities
the heave-ho from the Row in 1944.
Since that time, only the men have
been allowed to live in Greek hous
es.
There is no good reason for this
policy. The fact is, it's plain, old
fashioned sexism. Indeed, some
might argue that sororities are
more likely to respect their houses
than fraternities; they might be less
likely to, say, drive a golf cart
through a plate-glass window. But
let's digress lest we trip too far
down a different sexist path.
Now Stanford seems to have
seen the error of its ways. Indeed,
since 1993, University administra
tors have been hinting at a plan

that would allow unhoused frater
nities and sororities to apply for
Greek houses that become vacant.
Houses would open up if one of the
housed frats lost its abode due to
low membership or disciplinary
actions.
Two fraternities — Sigma Nu
and Zeta Psi — have applied for the
next available Greek house. One
sorority — Kappa Kappa Gamma
— has also applied.

Heather Dunn says she is still con
sidering approving the proposal. We
urge her to say yes.
Furthermore, when a house
opens, the Kappas should be the
ones moving in. Indeed, until there
are an equal number of housed fra
ternities and sororities — or no
sororities apply to fill vacant houses
— the women should be given pref
erence.
There is no more equitable solu
tion.
