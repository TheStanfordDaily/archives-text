Administrators should be fired under their own policy

WE AGREE with The Daily in
questioning the University's
"collective responsibility" policy,
which, as articulated by Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Heather Dunn in an
article on April 4, holds that, "If we can
relate an incident to a fraternity, then
we look at it as collective responsibili
ty."
Under the policy, just because the
five students who allegedly broke into
the art museum are Betas, all Betas are
held responsible and may lose their
housed status. In defending the collec
tive responsibility policy, Dunn and
Office of Student Activities head Nanci
Howe place great weight on the fact that

fraternities can choose their members.
It is a pity Dunn and Howe were not
available to work for the 1950s House
Un-American Activities Committee, jus
tifying the imprisonment of commu
nists. Under an eerily similar "collective
responsibility" policy, any American
who had chosen to be a communist
instantly became an enemy of the state
because Soviet communists wanted to
overthrow the U.S. government.
One of the lessons of McCarthyism is
that we cannot punish otherwise inno
cent individuals for the actions of those
they merely associate with. It is unfor
tunate that, at a school with a constitu
tional law scholar for its president, sec

ond-rate bureaucrats like Howe and
Dunn possess so much power over stu
dents and so little understanding of
important principles like these.
If the collective responsibility policy
does stand, we would like to propose the
only reasonable alternative, applying it
to its full extent. The Betas are all
guilty if they "chose" members who
eventually committed a crime; let's run
with the Howe / Dunn logic for a bit.
We must also take away Howe's and
Dunn's offices for "choosing" to let the
Betas be a housed fraternity in the first
place. Dean Montoya and the entire
admissions staff should also be rendered
homeless for choosing to admit these

students. Finally, if anyone at this
school ever chooses to send Howe and
Dunn off to the unemployment line,
they should also choose to fire Casper
and Rice for choosing to allow Howe and
Dunn to work for them.
In closing, we urge President Casper
to reconsider the collective responsibili
ty policy, which unfairly allows bureau
crats to punish disfavored groups with
the justification that they include a few
bad apples. Stanford deserves a policy
that is fairer to students and equitable.
