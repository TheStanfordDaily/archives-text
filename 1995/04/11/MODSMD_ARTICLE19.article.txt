# 'New math' doesn't teach basic concepts, is a form of social engineering
## 
### 
In response to the letter of David Louis
(March 6), I would like to offer a parent's
perspective on the new "new math" in the
Palo Alto Unified School District. Although
The Daily is hardly the forum to discuss
this issue in depth, Louis' letter is mislead
ing in several respects. First, it is not "only
five parents" that have protested the
changes in the math curriculum. Approxi
mately 600 parents signed a petition,
attended a school board meeting, and were
essentially ignored in a rather patronizing
"we know best" fashion.
Second, as a survivor of the original
"new math" and"the open classroom," I
can personally attest to the inadequebes of
similar "research" when applied to the real
world of education. There have been no
controlled trials of the program which the
school district has launched into head over
heels.
Third, we all want our children to learn
the concepts as well as the mechanics of
mathematics. However, it is unclear to
many parents how writing paragraphs

about things like "how did you feel about
the problem" and being given more credit
for answers that are "politically correct"
rather than mathematically correct have
anything to do with learning mathematical
concepts. For more details about this issue,
consult the HOLD homepage on the Inter
net.
Finally, the real issue here is choice.
What upsets many of us is that essentially
the entire curriculum is being "dumbed
down" in a misguided attempt at social
engineering directed at "equal outcome"
rather than equal opportunity. If such a
track were offered as an experimental
choice, no one would be complaining. How
ever, each child only goes through the edu
cational system once and being the subject
of an uncontrolled, ill-conceived "experi
ment" is not what most parents (or most
societies) desire from a sdiool district.
