# Does Professor Cohn hate African-Americans?
## 
### 
I see that Prof. Cohn is at it again. In
his April 4 letter to The Daily he blames
multiculturalism, "marginal black fig-

ures" and the "disastrous" hiring by
Stanford of a black football coach for the
demise of Western civilization. Does
there exist a single black student, faculty
member, coach, secretary or janitor
whose presence on the Stanford campus
Cohn does not hate? Dare we hope that
if he has any venom left over he could
perhaps give people of African descent a
break and pick on a different ethnic
group?
