# Remark about new coach was the opposite of racist
## 
### 
George Evans Light, in his letter to The
Daily of last Wednesday, gives a classic
illustration of the politically correct men
tality: If you object to clumsy affirmative
action, he plays the race card by calling you
a "venomous" racist. Actually, my remark
about the new coach was the opposite of
racist: It was an objection to racial consid
erations which caused an "ill-prepared"
(quoting Glenn Dickey, sports writer for
the San Francisco Chronicle) person to be
hired. Can anyone imagine my demurring

at a fully-proven coach of any race?
Of course, coach Tyrone Willingham
may do well despite his inexperience. But
as many alumni agree, it is a poor way to
run things and casts discredit on our lead
ers. Or is Stanford headed the way, foot
ball-wise, of San Francisco State?
Am I indeed "out of step"? I sure hope
so at Stanford. Campus liberal lockstep has
become a national, and international, joke.
The universities are literally written off, in
terms of vision, even by intelligent non
conservatives like Morton Kondracke (his
last-printed column sees us as headed
down a futile path).
