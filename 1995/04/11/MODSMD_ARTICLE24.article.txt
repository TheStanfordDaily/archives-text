## Theses are worth the work 
### 
I FEEL like I've been doing the
masochism tango all year. It's not a
job, a class, a bribe nor an infatuation
with the cute guy who stacks books on
the third floor that brings me to Green
Library almost every afternoon. It's my
honors thesis.
It all began my frosh year when in
October I saw seniors in my dorm start
out, looking excited and interested in
their theses. They were embarking on a
long journey of concentrated academic
research and writing, and they were
thrilled. By the end of winter quarter,
however, the tension set in. They locked
their doors and started drinking horren
dous amounts of coffee, scowling mania
cally at anyone who suggested a game of
Ultimate Frisbee. By May, we were all
relieved that they had finished, if for no
other reason than that they were show
ering regularly again.
Why, I wondered, would anyone do
this? What a foolish endeavor just to get
"with honors" printed on a diploma.
Truly, writing a thesis is extraordinar
ily foolish and painful if it is done just to
have a spiffier diploma. For a project of
this size, most people need more motiva
tion and drive. I decided to write a thesis
in order to achieve a lot of things, but pri
marily to gain a sense of cohesiveness
and academic closure to my time at Stan
ford. I realized through my years as a
student in the humanities and social sci
ences that most of these majors are so

flexible that students often graduate
without feeling like they are really an
expert in any specific area.
So I started out last year, going over
seas with the intent of developing an idea
for my thesis. By last summer, I still
hadn't found a topic. Great. I signed up
to come back to school early for Honors
College / Nerd Camp, in hopes of pushing
myself to do some work. Along with
learning how to paraglide and drinking
sangria with faculty, I managed to think
of a great topic. I later found out that a
four-volume collection could be written
on that particular question. Round two.
More topics came to mind, but because of
lack of available material and suitable
advisors, I discarded all of them.
It was a comedy of errors that made
me feel utterly incapable and frustrated. I
had no revelation of a brilliant topic; I was
just hauling myself through books, hop
ing for a crumb of inspiration. Finally, it
happened. I found something interesting
that I could discuss in 60 to 70 pages.
Something that I had done no previous
research on. And so the real work began.
Through the hurricanes and sunshine
that have characterized Stanford recent
ly I have gone to Green Library — where
I even have my own locker — to sit
blankly at my computer and try to eke
out something intelligent to put down on
paper in a hurried effort to present yet
another section of this monstrosity to my
advisor. Along with the other seniors

who have chosen this particular path, I
keep making mental lists of why I chose
to actually write a thesis, why I am not
outside enjoying the sun along with,
apparently, the rest of the world, and
most important, why my thesis topic is
actually worthwhile.
We are all plagued by similar worries.
Does anyone besides my parents and my
advisor care that I am writing this?
Would my advisor even read this thing if
he was not paid to do so? Does he read it
anyway? If this is such an important
topic, why hasn't anybody written about
it before?
I still have those fears and anxieties,
despite the fact that my thesis is in its
final stages. I worry about its quality
because I have invested so much of
myself in this project. But I keep myself
afloat with the thought of how great it
will be to actually finish this paper, and
the underlying knowledge that it will be a
decent piece of academic writing.
And, if nothing else, I can turn in a
copy to the library and get cheap thrills
off the fact that I can log onto Socrates,
type in "fin a setty, sudha," and see the
title of my thesis scroll up on to the
screen. Hey, to each her own.

Ben, stop being such an autocrat and give
us our damn T-shirts.
