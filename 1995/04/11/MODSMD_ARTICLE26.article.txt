## The 						Greek system at Stanford: blessing or burden? A 						great social life... and much more

this might sound like the stereo
typical portrayal of collegiate
Greek life, today's Stanford fraternity
member is far from the

sexist, homophobic,
always-drunk slacker
on the six-year under
graduate program. In
fact, joining a fraterni
ty may be the most
rewarding decision a
college student makes.
Although Greek life
does not suit everyone,
the advantages avail-

able to a fraternity member can develop
an individual in ways not easily
matched by a typical college dorm.
The greatest initial attraction of
joining a fraternity is indeed the social
life. Just like academics and athletics, a
student's social life is an important
sphere of the college experience. A fra
ternity allows members an important
social outlet. In a group of 50 guys,
there is always someone ready to go out
to eat, play hoops in the backyard, road
trip to San Francisco or even hit the
library to cram for that Econ 52
midterm. Indeed, there is never a bor
ing or dull moment.
The facet of social life for which fra
ternities are most recognized is the
party scene. Virtually every weekend,
one or more Greek organizations host a
party. Although not everyone would
like to admit it, these parties are an
integral part of Stanford's social scene.
Let's face it â€” Palo Alto is just not a
big college town. The few local bars fre
quented by Stanford students are sev
eral minutes drive away and inaccessi
ble to those under 21.
While these are the most visible
aspects of a fraternity, this social side

of Greek life in no way dominates an
individual's time, as Greeks spend no
more than five percent of their time
engaged in these types of activities.
Due to the aforementioned daily
social life, Greeks develop strong con
nections which outlive their college
years. After all, my best friends are my
fraternity brothers, whom I know I will
stay in touch with long after I gradu
ate. Such friendships are much more
difficult to develop in one year in a
four-class dorm, which lacks the com
mon bond found in fraternities. Most
residents change dorms with a small
draw group of friends; thus, there is a
lack of continuity with their dorm
mates.
Furthermore, strong friendships
lead to a solid network of alumni rela
tions. Our constant contact with our
fraternity alumni is an invaluable
resource for helpful advice and funding
for special projects. Statistically, Greek
alumni donate money to their school in
much larger numbers than the general
student body. In addition to donations,
Greek alumni serve as contacts in the
real world for the future. Along with
Stanford alumni, members of the same
Greek organization at different schools
are generally willing to assist young
Greeks in the professional world.
ALL OF THIS is great for mem
bers of fraternities themselves,
but often overlooked is exactly
how much fraternities give back to the
school and local communities. In addi
tion to the social contributions
described above, Greeks are very
involved with the athletics at Stanford.
Fraternity members show up in large
numbers to support athletic teams in a
very loud and spirited fashion. Frater
nity men tend to be some of the most
vocal and faithful of college sports fans,
consistently helping to boost our
teams' performances. One of the rea
sons fraternity members are such
faithful fans is the fact that many
members of the sport teams are frater
nity members as well.
Stanford Greeks are also very
involved in programs that support the

local communities. Through
out the school year, Greek

organizations sponsor
countless fund-raising

and philanthropic
events. Greek

organizations
come together
in their chari- /
table efforts \
more so than an
J

average dorm, as >
traditions are set and

passed on to the younger
members. Some examples

of these efforts are DG
Anchor Splash, KA Mud Vol
leyball and the SAE Haunted

House. With Greeks placing
great effort in these pursuits, the
results are rewarding both to the
aided community and the members

sponsoring such events.
On the whole, fraternities offer
many opportunities that other
wise would not be available to
Stanford students. Members of
these groups acquire advan
tages that will benefit these
individuals for the rest of
their lives.
From a personal stand
point, joining a fraternity has
been the major factor which
has contributed to my enjoy-

able and rewarding college
experience. While I know
that I will remember Stan
ford for its beautiful cam
pus and its excellent edu
cation, I will always
cherish my many close
friends in the house and
the long-lasting effect

that it has had on me.
Enough about the
future; when the
weekend rolls

around,
TOGA
TOGA!
