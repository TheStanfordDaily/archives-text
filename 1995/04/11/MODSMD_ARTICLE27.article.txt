System destroys friendships
The Greek system is ridiculous
because it's a social organisation that is
based almost primarily on drinking and
hooking up; once you are tired of get
ting drunk at the same old parties or
enter a monogomous relationship, it
becomes a burden. In addition, friend
ships fall apart because they are not
based on anything substantial or real.
Free beer
The Greek system is incredible
because it provides the whole campus
with free beer and open parties with no
cover charge. I don't know what people
are complaining about. No one forces
people to go to these parties; if they
choose not to go they don't have to go
â€” to criticize them is ridiculous.
If they want to do away with the fra
ternity houses, why can't we do away
with theme houses. ... People should
have the freedom to have houses like
they want as long as they don't harm
anyone. I think fraternities are a great
way to have open parties for the entire
community.

Don't get sucked in
I never cease to be amazed by the
number of [sorority] women who con
stantly talk about de-activating yet
never do. I take pride in the fact that
my friends are not bought, that I no
longer pay money every quarter
towards date-finding functions, that I
am no longer part of an institution that
blatantly discriminates on the basis of
wealth, beauty, fashion and the ability
to small talk.
I have friends who remain in sorori
ties, and I love them dearly. Neverthe
less, I hope that freshmen read this and
see that it is not the envious rantings of
a woman deemed unwanted by these
organizations but of one who has been
there, and I'm embarrassed about that.
Don't buy your friends freshman year.
If anything, I encourage you to go
through Rush to both see what it's like
and meet people if you want to. But
don't get sucked in. There are thou
sands of women on this campus who
thrive, who meet lifelong friends and
even have fun without belonging to
such arcane, elitist organizations.
