# Fraternities are a danger to women

### Rachel Katz 
THERE ARE many reasons to think
that housed fraternities are a bad
idea from a feminist perspective.
This opinion goes beyond gripes about
the loud, rowdy parties and such trans
gressions as the alleged Beta thievery.

The roles that fraterni
ties — particularly
those that are housed
— play in our culture
have many negative
effects on women.
Fraternities come
from a history of
straight male privilege.
This is one of the places
where the "old boys"

networks originated. That privileged and
exclusionary position still holds. A small
example at Stanford: 10 of the 36 houses
on the Row are run by fraternities. The
houses are all-male and all of the resi
dents are exempt from the Draw. They
can take (male-only) boarders of their
choice. Many people consider the Row to
have the best housing options on campus,
and when Draw rolls around it's consis-

tently harder for women to get into Row
houses than men.
But it's really the deeper problems
that are fundamental to all fraternities,
not just those at Stanford, that many find
troubling. Men often live in frat houses
for the length of their undergraduate
careers, beginning in sophomore year and
continuing on until senior year. The envi
ronment is rather homogeneous, by gen
der, If not by race and class as well. When
one does not live, eat and socialize with a
group of a certain identity, it is very easy
for people with that identity to become an
"other" and seem less human. Without
that empathy, it is easier to hate or be
destructive towards those people.
The absence of women also reduces
the chances that someone will keep the
sexist behavior and thought in check. In
an environment that demands conformi
ty in the name of "brotherhood," there is
often no one willing to challenge oppres
sive and intolerant actions, not just
towards women but towards queers and
others who do not fit the cultural norm.
There can be an enormous pressure to
conform to macho attitudes that con
strain the personality of the fraternity
members themselves. Any behavior that
is not entirely masculine is often deemed
unacceptable and queer brothers are
strongly discouraged from coming out of
the closet.

The power dynamic of these tightly
bonded communities make fraternities a
huge influence in many young men's
lives. According to sociological studies of
fraternity culture, misogynist behavior in
particular is encouraged as part of a pro
cess of gaining masculine identity as a
"brother." And the misogyny can be
extreme and violent. One of the most
common settings for gang rape is a fra
ternity house. It has been documented to
be part of some fraternities' rituals.
Because of the free-flowing alcohol,
experimental nature of college students
and pressure on men to be sexually
active, acquaintance rape is also ram
pant. Those women that are in relation
ships are often seen less as equals and
more as objects.
I wonder why the existence of housed
fraternities at Stanford is not challenged
more. Federal laws — such as Title IX of
the Educational Amendment of 1972 —
that guarantee equal educational access,
funding and housing to both sexes, as
well as freedom from a hostile learning
environment, call the legality of fraterni
ties into question. So what keeps them
housed at Stanford? Is it the wealth of
their alumni? The reluctance of Stanford
to deal with issues that concern women?
Or do Stanford students not particularly
care, as they bike to class, heads low and
thoughts inward?
