# Many types of women have positive experiences in sororities

### Lauren Pressman 
lAM AWARE of the salient controversy
surrounding the value of the Greek
system and admit that membership is
not for everyone. However, I am con
vinced that it is equally undeniable that,
for many Stanford women, being part of a
sorority is an extremely positive experi
ence.
First, 1 would like to dispel a few
myths. Stamford sororities are not collec
tions of carbon-copied women who have
gravitated to these groups with the inten
tion of hiding in an insulated subculture.
On the contrary, one will find that within
each sorority there are women from a
variety of backgrounds and disciplines
who are involved in a myriad of campus
activities outside of the Greek system. I
would like to point out that each sorority
member, like every other Stanford stu
dent, was chosen by the grueling Stanford
admissions process requiring inexorable
dedication to their academics, athletics
and comm nity involvement that gener
ally supersedes any social commitment.
The very nature of the system, which is
extremely relaxed compared to other uni-

versities, provides an opportunity for
interested women to add another dimen
sion to their Stanford experience while
continuing to chart their own personal I
course. Sororities do not make or break a i
Stanford career; they represent one outlet i
on campus for women to get to know each <
other. The very fact that Stanford sorori
ties are unhoused illustrates my point i
that membership in a sorority is not all- 1
encompassing. While some groups may be i
considering the option to be partly- <
housed in the future, that will not pre- 1
elude the traditional aspiration of the sys- <
tem, which is to encourage women to be 1
exposed to Residential Education and to 1
form friendships exogenous to Greek 1
involvement. I
It is precisely for this reason that Rush 1
is held in the spring. It is important that i
frosh women have a sizable amount ef I

time to get acquainted with Stanford and
settle iii to their collegiate lives before

deciding whether or not they are inter
ested in rushing. Whether a woman J

chooses to pledge or not, Rush offers a
fabulous opportunity for frosh toi

meet hundreds of upperclassi
women and their own classmates. It'

is no myth that it can be difficult to

form friendships in casual and sporadic
social settings, and sororities offer a reli
able framework in which these friend
ships can be cultivated.

In my own case, I was placed in a
four-class dorm with very few frosh
women. Although I had arrived at Stan
ford with no intention of rushing, I
changed my mind when I realized that
my housing situation had been a serious
disadvantage in meeting other frosh
women. And, although almost all of my
drawmates are not in my sorority, I am
thankful for the chance to have
increased the faces that I recognize on
campus by about 400 percent. In addi
tion, when I returned from overseas,
despite the unpredictable housing situa
tion and random dispersion of my
friends, I had about 80

women who enthusias
tically welcomed me

back. Thanks to my
sorority, readjusting
to Stanford after i

being away was not too difficult. This
has been my experience, and I do not
intend to posit that all women rush for
the same reason, but rather to highlight
that there are many reasons outside of
access to closed Greek parties that moti
vate people to Rush.
OFTEN, SORORITIES and fraterni
ties are identified with forcible and
harmful drinking habits and ques
tionable social practices. I don't wish to
war over statistics, but after four years
living in Stanford housing ranging from
dorms to self-ops, I am comfortable saying
that these habits are not exclusive to the
Greek system. I wish to make no norma
tive judgment on drinking but just want
to remind you all that alcohol intake is not
an invention of the Greek system.
Re-reading what I've written, I realize
I am sounding somewhat

defensive. Maybe I am
paranoid, but I do feel
v that I often have to
the pejorative
' association with the
i sorority system. It dis
turbs me that many
members of this commu-

nity are so
critical of
our exis
tence on

campus. We are in no way perfect organi
zations, but then again, what is a perfect
organization? If friendships are made,
community service events are planned
and people have some fun through the
Greek system, then can it be so unequivo
cally detrimental? Although the exclusivi
ty of the system is certainly not a positive
attribute, I do feel that an effort is made
to ameliorate this. Parties are generally
open and the entire Stanford community
is invited. The University has capped the
size of our organizations and, therefore,
contributes to the exclusivity.
Sororities, for me, represent only one
option on campus for people to comple
ment their daily lives with some group
involvement. Look around: Most of the
people around you belong to at least one
group, or, in many cases, a variety of
groups. I find that it is common for peo
ple to criticize the system without real
izing who is actually a member. In my
opinion, the character of the Stanford
Greek system is such that you often
never know who is involved. It is not
uncommon to realize that someone you
never considered a "Greek-type" hap
pens to be a member of a sorority. At
Stanford, I am happy to say, there is no
describable type. This might kill some of
you to hear, but I'll say it anyway â€” it is
more than likely that there is a someone
in a sorority who is a lot like you are.
