# Med School will lose some funds for assistantships
## Seeks support for teaching, research 
### Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing writer 
As its parent organization,
Stanford Health Services, at
tempts to cut $25.3 million from
next year's budget, the School of
Medicine is facing yet another
funding constraint as it prepares
to lose federal indirect-cost money
for research and teaching assist
antships in 1997.
A meeting of the Medical
School Faculty Senate on April 21
will address alternative sources of
funding to minimize the possibly
substantial loss of assistantships
for medical students.
This loss could seriously affect
teaching and research at the Med
ical School, administrators said,
as well as be a detriment to stu
dents whose tuition costs are re
duced by the assistantships.
Whenever a university re
ceives a federal research grant, a
certain percentage of the funds is
directed specifically to the pro
ject and another portion of the
money is used for institutional
expenses accrued indirectly by
many projects and activities.
Roughly 50 percent of the grant
can be used for indirect costs
such as building depreciation, as
well as water, gas and electric
bills.
At the Medical School, indirect
cost grants are compiled into a
pool, sometimes called the Staff

Benefits Fund, which in the past
has been used to fund many as
sistantships. Currently, most as
sistantships — which pay at a rate
of $8,000 per quarter — receive
about 40 percent of their funding
from the professor involved in the
research and the remainder from
the indirect-cost pool.
The University successfully ar
gued in the past that assistant
ships were indirect costs and
therefore could be funded by the
Staff Benefit Fund.
As of 1997, however, the feder
al government will reduce the in
direct-cost rate by about 50 to 70
percent as a result of a recent gov
ernment-University agreement,
said Anatomy Prof. Larry Math
ers, Chair of the Medical School
Faculty Senate. One effect of this
agreement is that assistantships
will now have to be almost fully
funded by the professors sponsor
ing the research.
This change could result in the
substantial reduction of both re
search and teaching assistant
ships.
There are approximately 50 to
100 research and teaching assis
tants at the Medical School each
quarter, Mathers said. So several
hundred thousand dollars are
spent each quarter on research as
sistantships.
