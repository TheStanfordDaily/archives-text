# Med School will lose some funds for assistantships
## Seeks support for teaching, research 
### Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing writer 
As its parent organization,
Stanford Health Services, at
tempts to cut $25.3 million from
next year's budget, the School of
Medicine is facing yet another
funding constraint as it prepares
to lose federal indirect-cost money
for research and teaching assist
antships in 1997.
A meeting of the Medical
School Faculty Senate on April 21
will address alternative sources of
funding to minimize the possibly
substantial loss of assistantships
for medical students.
This loss could seriously affect
teaching and research at the Med
ical School, administrators said,
as well as be a detriment to stu
dents whose tuition costs are re
duced by the assistantships.
Whenever a university re
ceives a federal research grant, a
certain percentage of the funds is
directed specifically to the pro
ject and another portion of the
money is used for institutional
expenses accrued indirectly by
many projects and activities.
Roughly 50 percent of the grant
can be used for indirect costs
such as building depreciation, as
well as water, gas and electric
bills.
At the Medical School, indirect
cost grants are compiled into a
pool, sometimes called the Staff

Benefits Fund, which in the past
has been used to fund many as
sistantships. Currently, most as
sistantships — which pay at a rate
of $8,000 per quarter — receive
about 40 percent of their funding
from the professor involved in the
research and the remainder from
the indirect-cost pool.
The University successfully ar
gued in the past that assistant
ships were indirect costs and
therefore could be funded by the
Staff Benefit Fund.
As of 1997, however, the feder
al government will reduce the in
direct-cost rate by about 50 to 70
percent as a result of a recent gov
ernment-University agreement,
said Anatomy Prof. Larry Math
ers, Chair of the Medical School
Faculty Senate. One effect of this
agreement is that assistantships
will now have to be almost fully
funded by the professors sponsor
ing the research.
This change could result in the
substantial reduction of both re
search and teaching assistant
ships.
There are approximately 50 to
100 research and teaching assis
tants at the Medical School each
quarter, Mathers said. So several
hundred thousand dollars are
spent each quarter on research as
sistantships.
The change in funding for as
sistantships is only one aspect of
the October settlement of a four
year dispute with the federal gov
ernment about the validity of its
billing of indirect costs in
research.
The federal government origi
nally alleged that the University
overbilled it by $185 million over
a period of 12 years, but dropped
its claims of fraud and wrongdo
ing late last year.
One way to deal with the
change in rules would be for fac
ulty to include the costs of assis

tantships in their grant propos
als. However, many faculty may
not want to do that, said Ed
Caron, director of financial aid
for the Medical School.
"Some won't because it might
affect their competitiveness since
it will have to be included in their
bid and increase its cost," Caron
said.
Other faculty may feel that it
is cheaper to hire part-time
research assistants rather than
graduate students.
"In 1997, we as a school have to
come up with a way to cope with
the loss of money," Mathers said.
Mathers said he thinks the
money will have to come from
departmental budgets. "There

will be a fair amount of new
financial burden on individual
departments," he said.
Martin Brown, director of the
radiation biology division, said he
is concerned about how the cuts
could affect his department. "It is
going to make graduate students
more expensive and research
assistantships for medical stu
dents harder," he said.
"It'll affect everyone who has
graduate students in the labs.
The departments don't have any
extra money to support these
research assistantships," he
added.
Oncology Prof. Charlotte
Jacobs, associate dean of the
Medical School, said she is

already seeking alternative fund
ing sources. "It will be the joint
responsibility of the dean, faculty
and departments," she said.
"The cost will prevent faculty
from hiring the same number of
students," Caron said. Although
the Dean's Office will attempt to
defray costs, faculty will still end
up responsible for a significantly
larger portion of assistantship
funding.
Ultimately, the cost burden
could adversely affect both teach
ing and research.
"A lot of teachers have teach
ing assistants and the ability to
support them is in jeopardy —
our educational mission is in
jeopardy," Mathers said.
