## Best-ever not good enough Women's gymnasts just miss NCAAs 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gymnastics team knew that it
had to perform flawlessly in order to qualify for the
nationals. However, its showing on Saturday proved to
be less than perfect.
Despite recording its best score ever in NCAA region
al competition, the Stanford squad failed to qualify for

nationals. The team tallied a 192.575 and placed third
in the region behind Oregon State (194.925) and cham
pion UCLA (195.900).
In order to go on to nationals, a school must either
win one of the five regior.als or finish in the top 12 in the
country. The Cardinal finished 15th overall, barely
missing the cut.
Stanford suffered a rough start on the floor exercise,
scoring a 47.700, an average number for the Cardinal's
high-powered floor team. Little mistakes hurt Stanford,
including two instances of stepping out of bounds for
which the team was penalized a tenth of a point.
"People were nervous," said senior Meegan Lannin.
"It was kind of a tight floor so it was a little jumpy."
The squad pulled itself together on the vault, as
freshman Keri Monahan and senior co-captain Jene
Elzie led Stanford with a 9.775. Freshman Christie
Jones and Lannin finished only 0.025 points behind.
From there the fired-up Cardinal moved to the
uneven bars; here, disaster struck. The squad suffered
three falls, two of which occurred during medium-level
skills. Monahan saw her hopes of qualifying for the
NCAA individuals dashed when she fell on a transition
move, and, more important, the team witnessed its
dream of going to nationals start to disappear.
"I think the problems we had on bars were indicative
of the problems we had been having in practice," Mona
han said.
Stanford ended the meet on the balance beam and
enjoyed one of its best performances of the season.
Freshman Misty Moore led Stanford by scoring a 9.825,
the fifth-best score in the region. Teammates Monahan
(9.800) and Elzie (9.725) also hit their routines.
Despite the strong finish, Coach Breck Greenwood
was hoping for a more successful overall result.
"We didn't reach our goal for the season," Green
wood said. "We had some great things happen this year,
but for us it all came down to going to nationals, so it
was a bit disappointing."
The brightest spot for the Cardinal proved to be the
performance of Elzie. The senior from El Cerrito, Calif.,
registered her best all-around mark of her career and
broke the school record with a 39.025, the third-best
score in the region. She qualified for the NCAA individ
ual nationals held at Georgia, a competition between
the top 12 gymnasts in the nation whose teams did not
qualify.
"Jene was awesome," Greenwood said. "[Sophomore
Ariel Passanisi] and her were the high points in the
meet."
Monahan finished 15th despite her fall on bars, a tes
tament to her talent as well as her enormous potential.
Had she not suffered the 0.5 point deduction, she would
have easily qualified and joined her teammate in Geor
gia.
For seniors Katie Clancy, Tina Snowden and Lan
nin, this marks the close of their illustrious collegiate
careers.
"It hit me after the meet, but it hasn't really sunk in
yet," Lannin said. "Gymnastics is not one of those
things that you can just pick up and do anytime, and I
will definitely miss it."
