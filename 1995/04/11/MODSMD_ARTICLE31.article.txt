California 22
Stanford 10

On Saturday the Stanford
men's rugby team came up
empty-handed in its quest for
college rugby's holy grail. Seek
ing to upend No. 1 California for
the first time in 16 years, the
Cardinal battled throughout the
close match, but ultimately fell
22-10 to the Golden Bears.
Cal started the contest quick
ly, capturing a 3-0 lead 20 min
utes into the match. Stanford
was able to keep a physically big
ger Cal team in check for the
middle portion of the first half
before the Bears scored again to
open up its lead to 10-0. The

Cardinal made several strong
pushes during the first half, tan
talizing the large Maloney Field
crowd but never capitalized on
its offensive efforts.
The Stanford attack was suc
cessfully thwarted throughout
the first half by a defensive- mind
ed Cal squad. Although the Cardi
nal didn't have a point on the
scoreboard, it carried momentum
off the field at the end of the first
half. With less than two minutes
remaining before the break, Stan
ford provided a strong defensive
push to stop a charging Cal at the
goal line.
Stanford stepped up its level of
play coming out of halftime.
Intense defense led to several
offensive opportunities that
resulted in a 10-10 score early
into the second period. Coach
Boivert's halftime speech focused
on applying offensive pressure

and taking the game to the Gold
en Bears.
"If we put the pressure on
them defensively, we could
score," Boivert told his players
during the intermission.
The tie on the scoreboard
brought the match to a new level
as both squads fought to gain
control of the match. Vicious hit
ting and inspired efforts were
provided by both sides before Cal
eventually tipped the match in
its favor. Stanford was unable to
stop the relentless flow of Gold
en Bear runs coming on the
wings. Despite two late offensive
runs, Stanford couldn't crack
Cal*B defensive wall and fell 22-
10.
"Unfortunately we didn't
play as well as we wanted,"
Boivert said. "On offense we gave
away too many balls."
The Cardinal's lack of offensive
composure was marked by rushed
kicks and dropped tosses. Although
Boivert commended the forwards
for their collective "fantastic
game," the Cardinal established no
real offensive cohesion. Fatigue
also played a role in the loss, with
the players having little juice left at
the end of the game.
The technical mistakes, howev
er, are not the only explanation for
the disappointing outcome. Boivert
considers psychological aspects of
the match more important than
the technical.
"We didn't match Cal's compo
sure and determination. We lacked
determination," said Boivert. "In
the end, they overpowered us."
One courageous Stanford per
formance personified determina
tion. Having gashed his head open
on an opponent's cleat, junior
Bobby Blunt received treatment on
the sidelines and then re-entered
the game for the final 20 minutes
of contact. With his head bandaged

like a mummy, Blunt made two
tremendous offensive bursts carry
ing the ball close to the goal line.
Although the Cardinal failed to
convert Blunt's efforts, his reckless
abandonment earned cheers from
the crowd.
Blunt deflected praise to his
teammates, but Boivert, accus
tomed to his junior's tremendous
play, said, "That's business as
usual with Bobby. He plays every
game 110 percent."
Stanford rugby will now focus
on playoffs at the end of April when
it very well could face Cal again.
Amidst frustration and disappoint
ment, Stanford definitely sees
hope, and, more importantly, room
for improvement. Both coach and
players believe the team can pick it
up a notch going into playoffs.
"We definitely have played bet
ter," said Blunt.
Conditioning can build
endurance and practice can elimi
nate mistakes, but in the end, only
attitude an determination will earn
the Cardinal a victory against Cal.
"My challenge is going to be to
motivate the players. That is going
to be the key to playoffs," Boivert
said. "The team must get the
enthusiasm back."
