Stanford 10

On Saturday the Stanford
men's rugby team came up
empty-handed in its quest for
college rugby's holy grail. Seek
ing to upend No. 1 California for
the first time in 16 years, the
Cardinal battled throughout the
close match, but ultimately fell
22-10 to the Golden Bears.
Cal started the contest quick
ly, capturing a 3-0 lead 20 min
utes into the match. Stanford
was able to keep a physically big
ger Cal team in check for the
middle portion of the first half
before the Bears scored again to
open up its lead to 10-0. The

Cardinal made several strong

half. With less than two minutes

push to stop a charging Cal at the
goal line.
Stanford stepped up its level of

offensive opportunities that
resulted in a 10-10 score early
into the second period. Coach
Boivert's halftime speech focused
on applying offensive pressure

and taking the game to the Gold

"If we put the pressure on
them defensively, we could
score," Boivert told his players
during the intermission.
The tie on the scoreboard
brought the match to a new level
as both squads fought to gain
control of the match. Vicious hit
ting and inspired efforts were
provided by both sides before Cal
eventually tipped the match in
its favor. Stanford was unable to
stop the relentless flow of Gold
en Bear runs coming on the
wings. Despite two late offensive
runs, Stanford couldn't crack
Cal*B defensive wall and fell 22-
10.
"Unfortunately we didn't
play as well as we wanted,"
Boivert said. "On offense we gave
