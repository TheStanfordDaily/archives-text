# Riders end 2nd
## Equestrian unable to topple champ Oregon 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
The West region's second-ranked Stanford
Equestrian Team headed to Fresno State last
weekend needing spectacular victories to take
over the top spot. The wins did not materialize in
Saturday's team competition, however, as both
the Cardinal English and Western squads placed
second behind the season's eventual champions.
In the English events, despite strong perfor
mances by freshmen Amanda Hoche and Kristen
Maan, the team fell to the Ducks of Oregon, who
earned the right to represent the region at
nationals in Fort Collins, Colo, on May 5-7. Still,
the Cardinal did beat the host Bulldogs, the vis
iting UC- Davis Aggies and four other teams,
securing a second-place overall finish for the sea
son.
In Western, senior Ingrid Hoffman led the
charge, winning the blue ribbon (first place) in
Advanced Stock Seat, while senior Julie Hill and
junior Tricia Kreinberg finished second in their
classes. A late-season addition to the team,
Kreinberg rounded out the year with three
straight top-three placings.
