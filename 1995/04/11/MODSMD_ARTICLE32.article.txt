# Riders end 2nd
## Equestrian unable to topple champ Oregon 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
The West region's second-ranked Stanford
Equestrian Team headed to Fresno State last
weekend needing spectacular victories to take
over the top spot. The wins did not materialize in
Saturday's team competition, however, as both
the Cardinal English and Western squads placed
second behind the season's eventual champions.
In the English events, despite strong perfor
mances by freshmen Amanda Hoche and Kristen
Maan, the team fell to the Ducks of Oregon, who
earned the right to represent the region at
nationals in Fort Collins, Colo, on May 5-7. Still,
the Cardinal did beat the host Bulldogs, the vis
iting UC- Davis Aggies and four other teams,
securing a second-place overall finish for the sea
son.
In Western, senior Ingrid Hoffman led the
charge, winning the blue ribbon (first place) in
Advanced Stock Seat, while senior Julie Hill and
junior Tricia Kreinberg finished second in their
classes. A late-season addition to the team,
Kreinberg rounded out the year with three
straight top-three placings.

Stanford's Western squad
placed second in the meet, losing
only to the nationals-bound Bull
dogs. Both English and Western
teams were very satisfied with the
season, with impressive second
place finishes overall, following last
year's fifth-place final standings.
But the weekend was not over
yet. On Sunday, the best riders in
the West (Zone VIII) came back to
the ring to compete for individual
spots at nationals. The top two rid
ers in each class would earn the
right to compete at Colorado State
next month.
The day did not start too well for
the Cardinal, as senior Quito Perl
man placed third in Intermediate
Fences, behind riders from USC
and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo.
Next in the ring for the Cardinal
was freshman sensation Amanda
Hoche, who extended her dream
season with a second place finish in
Open Equitation on the Flat,
becoming the first Cardinal rider of
the day to qualify for nationals.
Then the Western classes began.

In the Open Reigning class, senior
Duane Kracke took second place
and thus received a bid to represent
the region in Fort Collins. A few
minutes later, Kracke was back in
the ring for the Open Stock Seat
Equitation class, and again he
placed second, making him the Car
dinal's only double-qualifier.
Perlman had his second chance
of the day in Advanced Stock Seat.
This time, however, Perlman did
qualify for nationals, finishing sec
ond in the class. His winning per
formance in Western rather than
English was ironic because he had
learned to ride in Brazil.
Stanford's Ingrid Hoffman and
Julie Hill then rode in Intermediate
Stock Seat, the largest class of the
day. Hill drew the worst horse of
the field and finished sixth, while
Hoffman had a perfect round and
won the zone championship. In the
last class of the day, Beginner Stock
Seat, Stanford's Whitney Schott
beat Fresno State's Lisa Uribe to
become zone champion and earn
the right to go to nationals.
Junior Christina Russell, the
team president, was overjoyed with
her team's performance. "This has
been a really great season, for both
the English and Western teams."
