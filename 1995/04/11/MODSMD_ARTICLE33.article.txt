Stanford 25
Nevada 6

Supposedly, the Stanford base
ball team struggles in non-confer
ence games. After yesterday,
Nevada might not believe that.
Continuing an offensive ram
page that began with Sunday's
16-3 romp over UCLA, Cardinal
bats pounded 24 runs in the first
three innings to cruise to a 25-6
thrashing of Nevada (25-10) yes
terday in Reno.
The Wolf Pack, known for
putting runs on the scoreboard,
had knocked off the Cardinal (22-
14) in an earlier game at Sunken
Diamond, 7-4. But yesterday
Stanford hitters did all the talk
ing — with the generous support
of Nevada fielding.
The Wolf Pack committed six
errors, but, more importantly,
surrendered 18 unearned runs.
The 25 total scores surpassed any
single-game Stanford output since
a 27-4 massacre at conference foe
Arizona on March 27,1994.
In only his third start of the
season, junior Todd Bartels post
ed his second victory against one
loss. He left with an insurmount
able 22-run advantage after two
innings of work, allowing four
hits and two unearned runs. Six
Cardinal relievers assured that
no miracles would happen at Pec
cole Field.
That is, unless 24 runs in
three innings is a miracle.
Against its most recent non-Six-
Pac foes, Stanford had mustered
just a total of 10 runs in three
crushing defeats, surrendering

Junior right-hander Todd Bartels, who picked up his second win of
the season yesterday, fires to the plate earlier this year.
26. Continuing a trend from last
season, the Cardinal was only 9-9
outside the Six-Pac, 12-5 within. In
three magical innings yesterday,
Stanford took a giant first step
toward thwarting its non-confer
ence blues.
Senior third baseman Steve
Carver continued to give opposing
pitchers the blues, as he left the
yard for the seventh time this sea
son in the first inning. Carver, who
also homered in his first plate
appearance Sunday against UCLA,
is seeking his second Six-Pac Player
of the Week award after his 3-for-5,
six RBI performance yesterday and
4-for-6, five RBI output Sunday.
Senior right fielder Dusty Allen
followed Carver's home run with
one of his own, circling the bases
for the first time this season.
Allen's second homer of the season
came later on as Stanford chased
losing pitcher Matt Wells (4-3).
