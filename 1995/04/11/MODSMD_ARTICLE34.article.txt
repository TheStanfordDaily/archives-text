## Wrestlemania's would-be star

I had to face facts. I was never going to get to play
professional baseball.

Goldstein

The instant the striking players returned to
work and the owners decided not to lock them
out, my dream of catching on as a replacement
player somewhere had been heartlessly crushed.
(Actually, it was crushed when the California
Angels wouldn't even take me on as a scab.)
Never would the loudspeaker at Shea Stadium
ring out, "Now batting — number 13 on your
scorecards, but number one in your hearts —
Seth Goldstein." Which would have been fol
lowed, of course, by the overwhelming roar of

those wonderful New York crowds.
So what was I to do? How was I to satisfy that
craving for glory in the athletic arena that ached
in my heart?
Lawrence Taylor answered my question.
Although I grew up in the shadows of the
World Wrestling Federation's headquarters in
Stamford, Conn., I did not recognize the unparal
leled opportunities that pro wrestling had to offer
an athlete of my dubious caliber until the former
NFL All-Star embarked upon his wrestling
career.
At that point, all my problems were solved.
Pro wrestling was perfect for me. You don't
need to be really strong or fast or in good shape.
Most of those guys are much fatter than I am. It
doesn't require a whole lot of thought or hard
work, things which I try to avoid as much as pos
sible. The ability to speak coherently is frowned
upon. And random acts of senseless violence,
which I am prone to, are actually encouraged. It
was my dream job.
However, when I went to apply for a job in
Wrestlemania XI, I found out that there is much
more to a career in pro wrestling than I had origi-

nally thought. The helpful staffing
department of the WWF alerted me
to the fact that I needed to be capa
ble of following a script. They want
ed a flair for the dramatic. They
wanted a certain style, a special way
of doing things that was all my own,
a trademark signature, before they
considered me for a position.
Luckily, I possessed the neces
sary acting skills (as any of my bas
ketball-court buddies can attest to).
I could growl and make angry faces
with the best of them. Behaving
like an imbecile came second nature
to me.
I lost out on the personal signa
ture thing, though. As they told me,
everything is in a name. Without a
catchy nickname, a captivating cos
tume or an interesting alter ego to
entertain the rubes — oops, fans —

my career as a pro wrestler
wouldn't even get into the ring.
At home that night, I racked my
brain for a title that would gain me
entrance into my chosen field.
"Hulk Goldstein" and "Seth the
Giant" seemed like contradictions
in terms. (Not to mention the fact
that they wouldn't be entirely orig
inal, either.) Every good idea I came
up with, such as "The Wrestler For
merly Known as Seth," just
wouldn't work for me. I needed an
inspiration.
It came in the form of a Dukes of
Hazzard rerun. As soon as I saw the
familiar face of Cooter, I knew what
I would name myself. The actor
who played the mechanic later
became a congressman from
Kansas, where he wreaked havoc
upon a helpless city. I would be...
The Topeka Destroyer.
Everything seemed to fall into
place after that. I would imitate
that classic country-hick style that
had made the likes of King Kong

Bundy, Hillbilly Jim and Hacksaw
Jim Duggan into stars. Unshaven,
unshowered and untamed, I would
ride that unmistakable Cooter-look
into the Pro Wrestling Hall of
Fame.
Unfortunately, the hacks at the
WWF didn't see things in quite the
same light as I did. They offered me
a job, but not the one I wanted.
They recognized talent when they
saw it, but didn't think The Topeka
Destroyer would fly with the fans.
Instead, I became the larger half
of a tag team called The Gimps. We
have to dress up in these black*
leather costumes and terrorize the
fans.
This whole experience taught
me a valuable lesson. Be careful
what you wish for because you
might get it.
