# Sailors prolong current success despite winds
## 
### Mike Jensen Contributing writer 
This weekend, the Stanford
sailing team put the St. Francis
Invitational first-place prize into
its trophy case. The Cardinal top
pled an intersectional field in a
regatta that proved to be any
thing but smooth sailing.
The race took place on the
beautiful, yet unpredictable,
waters of San Francisco Bay. The
various bay currents and chang
ing wind made sailing an adven
turous endeavor. One current
would pull the flying junior boat
one way while another would
carry the sailors in the opposite
direction. Combine the shifting
gusts and a difficult course and
the result was a very challenging
weekend of sailing.
The Cardinal rose to the occa
sion and also gained some experi
ence in the bizarre conditions. In
what is becoming a tradition,
Stanford blew the field away on
the first day of the two-day com
petition. In what is also a Stan
ford tradition, senior Charles

Meade led the way. Crewing with
freshman Betsy Carmichael, the
team dominated the A Division
and earned first place in the
regatta. The duo impressed coach
Steve Bourdow with its boat
speed. Bourdow specifically cred
its Meade's experience for his
ability to maneuver the boat in
difficult conditions.
"Meade was very fast on Satur
day. He has improved in heavy
winds," Bourdow said. "He
doesn't have to think about going
fast, it's just natural. r
In the B Division, freshman
John Meade and sophomore
Megan Ireson got off to a slow
start, but the young team
improved as the competition pro
gressed. When winds continued to
pick up, Bourdow replaced Ireson
with a heavier crew, freshman
Dave Thomas. Bourdow's move
was designed to both put more
weight in the boat and give
Thomas experience in prepara
tion for this weekend's East
Coast regatta, the Admiral's Cup.
Several Stanford crews are
new this year. However, the
rookies have quickly gained the
coach's confidence.
"We are at the point where all
of our crews can skipper and take
a boat around the course —
that's very unusual," Bourdow
said.
Stanford didn't quite domi
nate the second day of competi
tion, but sailed well enough to
win the regatta by a comfortable
margin of 20 points. Senior crew
Ki Mun replaced Carmichael in

the A division and John Meade
and Ireson reunited to sail in the
B division. The combined efforts
of the two boats maintained
Stanford's cushion over second
place California. The team of
sophomore skipper Alice Manard
and junior crew Sybil Diver solid
ified its position as Stanford's
top women's squad.
Bourdow used much of the
regatta to determine who is going
to sail in the Admiral's Cup. The
challenging conditions also rein
forced a valuable lesson.
"The regatta opened my eyes
to the mental side of the game,"
Bourdow said. "We have to be
able to maintain a positive atti
tude in the face of discouraging
events."
