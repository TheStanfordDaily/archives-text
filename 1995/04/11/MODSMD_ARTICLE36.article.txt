# Summer again so soon?
## Sanders out of retirement 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff with AP wire reports 
Though it may only be
April, Summer is here to stay.
Former Stanford swimmer
Summer Sanders, who shocked
the sporting world by retiring
from competitive swimming in
January 1994, will make a run
at the 1996 Olympic team.
"As the excitement for
Atlanta grew, I realized that
this event is too big not to give
it my best shot," Sanders
announced last Friday. "I real
ly want to be a part of an
Olympics in my own country."
Atlanta will host the Games
of the XXVI Olympiad next
summer, 100 years after the
revival of the Modern Games
in Athens. Sanders paced all
American swimmers in the
1992 Barcelona Games with
four medals â€” two gold, one
silver and one bronze.
In those games, she posted
career bests in the 200-meter
butterfly, both the 200- and
400-meter individual medleys

and in her leg of the 4 x 100-
meter medley relay.
Sanders continued to swim
professionally until announc
ing her retirement last year,
when she said "it just wasn't
as enjoyable as in the past."
But after hosting MTV's
"Sandblast" and freestyle ski
ing on CBS, Sanders decided
that the chance to win in
America was too good to pass
up.
"Barcelona was a tremen
dous experience, but now I
realize competing in a U.S.
hosted Olympics is a once-in-a
lifetime opportunity," Sanders
said. "I feel the fire again."
Sanders, who has been at
UCLA to complete her educa
tion and be near her boyfriend,
still has Stanford record times
in the 200-meter butterfly and
200- and 400- meter IMs. After
the 1992 college swimming
season, Sanders gave up her
final two years of eligibility to
train full time for Barcelona.
Now Sanders will give up
her retirement to train full
time for another Olympics.
