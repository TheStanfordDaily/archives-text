# Stanford could host '97 Track Worlds
## Lananna, others remain wary, say chances are slim 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
Stanford Stadium may see more world
class competition in the near future if a four
man San Jose partnership gets its way.
San Jose business attorney Thomas Bartasi
heads a group called The 1997 Partnership
that has approached USA Track & Field to
petition the International Amateur Athletics
Federation for the 1997 world championships
to be held here.
"We have a real passion for track and field,"
Bartasi was quoted in the San Francisco
Examiner. "We really feel Stanford offers one
of the most unique areas for these events."
After the Olympics, the world champi
onships is the most important meet for track
and field.
The 1997 World Championships were
scheduled to be held in Mexico City until
Mexico withdrew, citing financial problems.
At a meeting in Sweden on May 18-20, the
lAAF will decide on a host between bids from
Finland, Spain, India and — if The 1997
Partnership gets its way — the United
States.
Stanford Track and Field Director Vin
Lananna remains wary of too much optimism
concerning the hosting of the event.
"USA Track & Field needs to feel that

[Stanford] is a site that they would want to
use. This is a private group trying to influence
USA Track & Field to consider Stanford an
acceptable site.
"I can't imagine that with the 1996
Olympic Games in Atlanta the lAAF would
approve the Worlds to be held here the next
year. Both events in the same country in two
years is hard to imagine.
"It needs to be taken a lot further, a lot
more needs to be explored," Lananna said.
"It's exciting to look at but it's still quite pre
liminary."
Were the championships to come, the Ath
letic Department would rent the Stadium to
the private group as was done for the World
Cup last summer and The 1997 Partnership
would take over the management from there.
"I think it would be great if we could host
this event," Athletic Director Ted Leland said.
"But we're a long way from getting an agree
ment."
The athletic department feels that hosting
another world-class event would be positive
for both the university and athletics but there
are many organizational details to be resolved.
Bartasi's partnership is made up of law
partner Nick Petredis, Bruce Jenner Classic
meet director Bert Bonanno and Los Angeles
businessman Rich Perelman. Perelman spe
cializes in managing sporting events with the

1987 Pan Am Games, the 1990 Goodwill
Games, the 1993 World University Games
and the 1994 World Cup under his company's
belt.
The World Championships started in 1982,
have never been held in North America and
have been outside Europe only once (at Tokyo
in 1991).
Stanford Stadium would need thorough
renovation to host the World Championships.
The present track has too few lanes and curves
too wide for international competition. Next
door, Angell Field is in the process of improve
ments that will enable Stanford to host the
Pacific 10 championships in 1997. With the
5,000-seat complex at Angell Field as a prac
tice track and a renovated stadium oval, Stan
ford could offer a good site to the LAAF in
terms of facilities.
"The facilities at Stanford are outstand
ing," Perelman was quoted in the San Fran
cisco Examiner. "From the standpoint of con
venience and quality, you can't do better than
Stanford. We're excited, but our excitement is
tempered by the fact that reality bites."
When Stanford and Perelman's company
hosted the World Cup, both impressed inter
national sporting bodies with the successful,
money-making management of the games —
selling out most games and handling the com
plicated logistics of an international event.
