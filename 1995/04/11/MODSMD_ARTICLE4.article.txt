# Escondido residents searching' for parking relief

Responding to student complaints of in
sufficient parking, Escondido Village resi
dents and administrators have begun to ex
amine Escondido's parking situation. The
group working on the issue has tentatively
planned a meeting for April 19.
These residents claim the University has
been unresponsive in dealing with their
parking problems.
It appears as though "the response has

been batted back and forth," said Karen
Seta, a graduate resident assistant for Es
condido and a member of the graduate
housing advisory committee.
"One of the most frustrating things
about EV," said Charlie Hasselbrink, a doc
toral student, "is getting them to do the
things that they should be doing anyway."
However, administrators involved main
tain that the process is moving along
smoothly.
Christine Griffith, director of Graduate

Residences, said residents and administra
tors met in late February to discuss student
concerns about parking in Escondido. "I
walked out of the meeting hearing everyone
saying it was a good way to start," Griffith
said.
"It's a very, very long-standing set of
problems," said Julia Fremon, director of
Transportation Programs. Escondido park
ing has always been governed with the same
set of rules and regulations as all other cam
pus parking, she said. "What's new this year

is realizing that (using these rules) is not
the best way to go."
"The main problem is that the village
was built for families of the '50s and '60s,
where one person was a student and one
stayed at home with the kids," Fremon said.
Thus there is roughly one parking spot as
signed for each one bedroom apartment.
This problem is exacerbated due to the
placement of three individual residents,
often each with his or her own
car, in a three-bedroom apart
ment designed for a single family
and allocated only one parking
spot.
"The car population is bigger
than when the complex was
built," said Fremon.
According to a study done by
Carol Nyholm, assistant director
of Graduate Residences for Escon
dido, a number of "neighbor
hoods" have less than 90 parking
spaces available per 100 residents.
Residents claim the lack of
available parking in certain loca
tions forces some students to
park a considerable distance from
their apartments.

This places an especially signif
icant burden, said Smadar Shiff
man, a doctoral student, on single
women who are returning home
late at night and on those who are
caring for small children.
Escondido residents are
required to purchase parking per
mits for a cost of $70. The park
ing permits allow the vehicle to be
parked in the Escondido, Rains
and Mirrielees lots. Though the
spots are numbered, students are
advised when purchasing their
permits that they are not guaran
teed a specific spot.
Some neighborhoods, howev
er, opt to create their own
assigned-space system. While this
is popular in family-only neigh
borhoods — where the one spot
per apartment ratio tends not to
be problematic — neighborhoods
where singles share apartments

tend to avoid such systems and
allocate their spots on a first
come, first-served basis.
The inconsistency of the regu
lations has resulted in confusion
and, in some cases, conflicts, Has
selbrink said. He described a
mixed single-family neighbor
hood in which the families had
assigned the spots on one side of
the street. According to Hassel
brink, a single living in that
neighborhood was physically
threatened for parking in some
one's spot.
"It creates a bad atmosphere,"
said Shiflman, who has conducted
an informal e-mail survey of
Escondido residents on their park
ing opinions. While her survey
showed a general discontent with
current parking procedures, she
also noted "a conflict of interest
between students and families."
