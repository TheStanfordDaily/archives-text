# Later than Late Night...
## Co Ho stays open 'til 2 am 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Stanford is not renowned for its raging
night life, but starting today extended
hours at the Coffee House may provide a
place to socialize for those burning the mid
night oil into the wee hours.
Duke Diercks, general manager of the
Co Ho, said student suggestions provided
the impetus for keeping the Co Ho open
until 2 a.m. Tuesday through Friday. Sat
urday, Sunday and Monday nights the es
tablishment will continue to close at mid
night.

"We had people who were unhappy
about our hours. Many folks thought that
we closed too early," Diercks said. He
added that in the past, even if the Co Ho
was packed, the staff would have to kick
them out because it was closing time.
Not only were the hours perceived as in
convenient by students, but Diercks said
the midnight closing time made some
bands and campus groups shy away from
hosting events at the Co Ho.
While patrons had often suggested the
Co Ho stay open later, management hesi-
tated on behalf of their student
employees, Diercks said. He
added that he disliked having to
keep his student staff at work
after midnight because of their
academic commitments.
Diercks was able to arrange
reduced late night hours by mov
ing each day's msyor cleanup to
the morning, before opening
rather than after closing.
"We wanted to give the stu
dents a broader array of choice,"
said Diercks. "We are always try
ing to improve our service."

Gail Warren, the Co Ho's
interim night manager, said the
pay rate for workers is
unchanged. While the extra two
hours may end up costing more in
the short run, Warren said she
hopes the Co Ho's profitability
and reputation will be enhanced
in the long run.
"We have a lot of full timers
and the turnover in staff that we
experience at the beginning of
every quarter allowed us to make
a schedule that will make this
happen," Warren said.
In addition to new hours, the
Co Ho has plans to add new items
to its menu and hold more social
events and has added some new
decorations.

Among the new furnishing is a
gold couch that Diercks picked up
at a secondhand store.
"I think he picked it up at a
Salvation Army store," said
Warren. "We've gotten a lot of
positive feedback on it. People
are pretty psyched and say it
makes the place look more
homey."
Sophomore Won Jung Park
said that the couch is "great" and
that "she uses it all the time."
"I like the new things they've
done here with the lighting and
stuff, too. A lot of people study
here and I'm sure they appreciate
the more comfortable atmo
sphere and better lighting," she
said.
