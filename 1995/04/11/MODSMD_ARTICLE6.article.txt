# Slate of COP hopefuls says 'Let's Be Candid' to voters
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Law student Cur
tis Kin says he won't
be intimidated in his
role as advocate for
the student body.
"I consider myself
a peer of the admin
istrators and the
ar nonnln \irlin nrn

other people who are
running this campus," Kin said.
Kin, the first graduate student in four
years to run for Council of Presidents, joins
senior Tom Baranowski and juniors
Michelle Gee and Rachel Hall in the battle
to lead Stanford students in the 1995-96
school year.

The foursome, representing the Stu
dents' Alliance party, will face slates from
the People's Platform and the Hammer
and Coffin parties in the spring election to
be held April 19 and 20.
Gee said that while no individual slate
member appeals to everyone, together
their appeal is diverse. "We balance each
other out," she said.
Kin's presence on the slate should ap
peal to graduate students. The last gradu
ate student to serve on the COP was John
Overdeck in the 1991-92 school year.
"The COP thing kind of fell in my lap,"
Kin said. "This is a really talented
group."
As an undergraduate at USC, Kin ma
jored in international relations with a busi-

ness minor and served as a resident
adviser and president of his frater
nity, Pi Kappa Alpha. Since coming
to Stanford, he has worked with
Cardinal Consulting, an ASSU
financial project. He has also
served as an ASSU senator this
year.
Kin's experience in student gov
ernment stems from his stint on
the USC student senate.
"I have good experience creating
new government and seeing how it
would work," said Kin, who served
as parliamentarian when the USC
senate rewrote its constitution.
At USC, Kin learned about the
perils of politics during a 1992
scandal when an independent sen
ate candidate allegedly taped phone
conversations — including some
comments made by Kin — which
were used by the then-program
board director to blackmail sena
tors.
"I said outlandish stuff (on the
phone) at the time, but I say that
kind of stuff all the time, so it
doesn't matter," he said.
At Stanford, however, Kin joked
that corruption like that in the
USC student government would
not be exposed. "They're just
smarter here," he said. "They
wouldn't get caught."

Gee, a product design mqjor and
the only other member of the slate
with ASSU experience, said she has
"seen a lot of the personal differ
ences that get in the way of getting
work done."
She served as senate secretary
last year and this year as a senator
and senate parliamentarian. In
addition, Gee has been active in
public service as last year's finan
cial director of the Stanford Volun
teer Network and as a one-time
Barrio Assistance tutor.
She said the slate's name, "Let's
Be Candid," is representative of a
desire to change the political pro
cess and eliminate student apathy.
"In the past, we've represented
the administration to students.
Now we will represent the students
to the administration," Gee said.
Although she is a junior, Hall
has the unique perspective of a
first-year Stanford student. A
Japanese nruyor, she left UC-Davis
because the Japanese program was
being "phased out" and it became
increasingly harder to enroll in
Japanese classes.
"I have the opportunity to famil
iarize [myself] but still have a fresh
perspective on what it's like to be
new here," she said.
At UC-Davis, Hall worked with
state education policy, and she will
attempt to increase awareness of
state issues to the student body.
"Once you have the awareness,
the people may want to influence

the state level," she said.
At Stanford, Hall serves on the
COP cabinet and is currently work
ing with the Haas Center for Public
Service in initiating an AIDS clear
inghouse.
"There is still a sense that there
are a lot of student issues that
aren't being addressed," Hall said.
In contrast, Baranowski has
longtime familiarity with Stanford.
In his fourth year, he has done
football play-by-play for KZSU and
served as president of the Interfra
ternity Council and as vice presi
dent of the Delta Kappa Epsilon
fraternity.
Baranowski said he is running
for COP for two reasons. "I want
the COP to bring Greek issues
right to the doorstep of the admin
istration," he said, claiming that
IFC powers are limited.
He also will push for privatiza
tion of both Food Service and the
concessions at Tresidder Union.
"They've talked about it for two
or three years and each time it is
pushed aside. Everyone always
talks about it and no one ever
changes anything," he said.
"I want to be approachable so
[students] can still come up to us
with problems and concerns. We
will act on them. We want to break
down the invisible barrier between
the ASSU and the students," he
said, adding that he has felt this
barrier since students voted not to
have a COP four years ago.
