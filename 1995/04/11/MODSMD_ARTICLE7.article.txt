### Samuel Park Staff writer 
Two stories examining the frailty and follies of
men found a receptive and compassionate audience
when writer Tobias Wolff read at Kresge Auditori
um last night.
The near-capacity crowd listened attentively and
often broke into laughter while Wolff used an inti
mate and animated voice to tell his stories of human
weakness and discovery.
"I love being back here. It breaks my heart, of
course ... it's wonderful to be back," Wolff said
after a deluge of applause followed his entrance. A
Stegner Fellow at Stanford in 1975, he started writ
ing short stories under the encouragement of men
tors such as then-Creative Writing Director John
L'Heureux.
Wolff described his departure from the Stanford
campus as a scene from "Paradise Lost," with him
and his wife playing the role of Adam and Eve, and
"the angel at the back with the burning sword, say
ing, 'You're gone, man, go earn a living!' " Wolff
joked.
The first story Wolff read was "Souvenir" from
his memoir "In Pharaoh's Army." It recounted an
incident that happened when an arrogant and self
important officer came to replace him after the end
ofWolffs tour of duty in Vietnam.
Wolffs second story, "The Life of the Body,"
came from a collection of short stories on which he
is working.
"One way to go back from Syracuse to San Fran
cisco, where I lived for 15 years, is to write about it,"
Wolff said as an introduction.
Wolffs comical character study followed the
misadventures of a lonely English teacher who
gets drunk, beaten and has an epiphany, all with-

in 24 hours.
"He wanted to get married and
had always assumed that he
would get married by then, but he
had no luck with women," WolfT
read. One of his former flames, a
French teacher named Monique,
is described as wearing "dark
glasses even when she went to the
movies."
The hero of the story is soon
revealed as a self-deluded man liv
ing amid foolish literary conven
tions that don't apply to real life.
Comparing himself to creatures
in short stories, he is desperate to
transcend his ordinary existence
into the realm of fiction.
The delighted audience broke
into laughter several times dur
ing the reading of that story, and
Wolffs face broke into a thinly
disguised smile of delight, with
his voice growing in animation.

Wolff recounted how he was
forced "dragged and kicking and
screaming" into writing his mem
oirs. "Obviously I'm not Winston
Churchill, so there weren't mil
lions of people waiting to hear
how I spent those 15 years,"
Wolff said.
Creative Writing Director Eliz

"one of our own — local boy

Tallent praised him as an
"extremely accomplished prose
stylist," and hailed his "compas
sion, seriousness and commit
ment to the soul searching of a
writer's life."
Wolff worked as a waiter,
reporter, high-school teacher and
night watchman, among other
things, before coming to Stanford
to work on his writing as a Stegn

Syracuse University.
