For last relief from the nagging ache of taxes, we
recommend TIAA-CREF SRAs. SRAs are tax
deferrcd annuities designed to help build additional
assets -money that can help make the diHercnce
between living and living well after your working years
are over.
Contributions to your SRAs arc deducted Irom
your salary on a pre-tax basis. That lowers your
current taxable income, so you start saving on taxes
right away. What's more, any earnings on your SRAs
arc also tax-deferred until you receive them as income.
That can make a big difference in how painful your tax
bill is every year.
As the nation's largest retirement system, we oiler
a wide range of allocation choices —from TIAA's
traditional annuity, with its guarantees of principal
and interest, to the seven diversified investment
accounts of CREF's variable annuity. What's more,
our expenses arc very low,* which means more ol
your money goes toward improving your future
financial health.
To find out more, call our planning specialists at
1 800 842-2888. We'll send you a complete SRA
information kit, plus a free slide-calculator that shows
you how much SRAs can lower your taxes.
Call today —it couldn't hurt.
