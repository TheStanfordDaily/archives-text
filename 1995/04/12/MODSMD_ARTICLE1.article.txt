Women's basketball head
coach Tara VanDerveer will
take a one-year leave of absence
from Stanford to coach the 1996
U.S. Olympic team, sources
close to the team told The Daily.
In addition, both assistant
coaches, Julie Plank and Car
olyn Jenkins, are close to an
nouncing their permanent res
ignations from the program.

These moves would repre
sent a upheaval in the
Cardinal coaching staff, which
has been relatively stable for 10
years. According to players on
the team, associate coach Amy
Tucker will take over the head
coaching reins for the 1995-96
season.
While none of the develop
ments has been officially an
nounced, speculation about


Matthew Lawrence â€” Daily
Women's basketball head coach Tara VariSen/eer watches her
team In a contest with UCLA earlier this year. VanDerveer will
take a leave of absence from Stanford to coach the Olympic
team.
VanDerveer's possible Olympic
future has brewed for months. She
already has international coaching
experience having led the U.S.
National "A" Team last year in the
World Championship Games and
(he Goodwill Games. The official
mnouncement of VanDerveer's
election will likely take place at a
ress conference Thursday at 10
m.
"It reflects well on our team
that she's chosen as our Olympic
lasketball coach," senior center
vnita Kaplan said.
Contacted by The Daily last

night, VanDerveer said she could
not answer any questions related to
basketball or the Olympics until the
press conference. Athletics Director
Ted Leland also declined to com
ment on whether VanDerveer
would take the one-year sabbatical
required to coach the team.
However, members of the bas
ketball team confirmed that Van-
Derveer is leaving and expressed
their unanimous support for her
endeavor.
"She knows what you have to do
[to coach an Olympic team I "
Kaplan, who played 1 n-
Derveer in the Goodwii. t
year.
Freshman forward Kribiin
Folkl, who played in the Goodwill
Games last year as a volleyball
player, also agree that VanDerveer

is an excellent choice.
"She knows the fme line from
being your coach and being your
friend," Folkl said. "She also
understands the game of basket
ball better than anyone I know."
Kaplan and Folk! both said that
Tucker has been chosen to head
the team in VanDerveer's absence.
Tucker will spend her first sea
son without VanDerveer in 16
years. She has spent the previous
10 years as a member of Van-
Derveer's staff at Stanford; during
the eight years prior to that, Tuck
er was associated with Ohio State
University. VanDerveer coached
the Buckeyes from 1980 to 1985
before taking the Stanford position.
Tucker has never before served as
head coach at any institution.
The transition to Tucker will be

made more difficult by the depar
ture of the other two assistant
coaches. Folkl confirmed that
Plank and Jenkins will not be part
of the team next year.
Plank also has long connections
with VanDerveer; she spent the
last 10 years as a Stanford coach
and the two years prior to that as a
strength training and conditioning
coach at Ohio State. Jenkins joined
Stanford in 1991 after a successful
playing career at California.
Leland stressed last night that
neither coach has officially resigned,
as did Kaplan and a source close to
the team. However, the squad
appears to be preparing for a season
without Plank and Jenkins.
"We're a close team and we're
going to be able to pull through it,"
Folkl said. "You have no control

over it and you have to deal with
the hand you're dealt."
The news of the duo's departure
was first announced to the team in
a meeting yesterday afternoon.
According to both Kaplan and
Folkl, the team was shocked by the
announcement of the assistant
coaches' resignations, although
there had been rumors prior to the
meeting.
No official reason was given to
the team about Plank and Jenkins'
impending departures. Neither
coach could be reached for com
ment last night.
Stanford women's basketball
might also lose one of its best play
ers to a sabtiatical next year. All-
Pac-10 freshman Folkl told The
Daily yesterday that she has accept
ed an invitation to try out for the

Olympic volleyball team this sum
mer. If selected, Folkl will redshirt
next season in volleyball and bas
ketball to practice with the team.
"Yes, I am [going to try out],"
said Folkl, an Ail-American in vol
leyball. "I am very excited but it's
kind of hard [to get overly excited]
since the odds are stacked against
me. In women's athletics, [the
Olympics] are as high as you can
go. It's a goal most people have."
Official practice for the players
chosen to try out for the team will
begin in late June. According to
Folkl, they will practice for three
months before the first cut is
made. Sixteen players will be
selected who will practice together
before the final cut to 12 is made.
Folkl is one of five collegiate play
ers selected to try out.
