# Student allegedly forged transcripts
## 
### 
NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -
Lon Grammer desperately
wanted to go to Yale University.
As a mediocre student at an
obscure community college,
that would have seemed a long
shot. But Grammer managed to
get in anyway.
Two years later, he was a
month away from picking up an
Ivy League diploma when police
picked him up instead.
Grammer's downfall came
when he bragged to a former
roommate about forging his
transcripts, police said.
The 25-year-old man was
expelled and Yale is pressing
larceny charges, saying the stu
dent stole two years' worth of a
high-priced education from the
school and the government. He
owes $61,475 in grants and
loans, authorities said.
Yale admissions officers

refused to discuss how they
were duped.
Grammer refused to com
ment on the case, but his attor
ney, Norman A. Pattis, said he
will fight the charges.
Grammer arrived at Yale in
1993, transferring from Cuesta
Community College in San Luis
Obispo, Calif., where tran
scripts showed he had compiled
nearly a straight-A average. He
also presented Yale with an out
standing recommendation from
Cuesta's dean of students and
favorable letters from a political
science professor and science
instructor.
His high school record also
was exemplary, with an excel
lent recommendation from the
principal.
But the grades were doc
tored, some of the recommenda
tions were from people who

didn't exist, and those who do
exist say they never wrote
them, according to court
papers.
Cuesta's records show his
real grade-point average was a
C and his high school in Con
cord, Calif., told Yale that his
transcripts, test scores and let
ter from the principal were
fakes.
Grammer was caught when a
detective from the Lebanon,
N.H., police department con
tacted campus police about a
forged driver's license and reg
istration on a leased Jeep.
The vehicle was registered to
John Miles, Grammer's former
roommate in California. Miles,
who had never been to Lebanon,
N.H., told police that Grammer
had bragged to him about get
ting into Yale with forged tran
scripts.
