MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Qubilah Shabazz's
confession to FBI agents can't be used against her
because FBI agents violated her constitutional
rights when they entered her home without a war
rant, a magistrate ruled yesterday.
But in his ruling, U.S. Magistrate Franklin
Noel denied a defense motion to dismiss the mur
der-for-hire charges against Malcolm X's daugh
ter.
Shabazz, 34, is accused of plotting to hire her
high school friend Michael Fitzpatrick to kill
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
According to transcripts of their telephone con
versations, Shabazz believed Farrakhan was
responsible for her father's assassination in 1965,

and feared for the safety of her mother, Betty
Shabazz, who had publicly expressed her suspicion
of Farrakhan.
Defense attorneys have claimed Fitzpatrick was
able to manipulate Shabazz because she was in
love with him. Farrakhan, who denied any role in
the assassination, has also said he believed
Shabazz was set up.
In throwing out Shabazz's confession, Noel
ruled that her Fourth Amendment rights were vio
lated when two FBI agents entered her home Dec.
20 without permission and lied about how they
had acquired information about the alleged plot.
The agents told her they were investigating coin
dealing fraud involving Fitzpatrick's employer.
