# Energy, food prices down
## 
### 
• WASHINGTON (AP) - The
cost of energy and food fell at the
wholesale level in March, giving
the country its best news on
prices in five months and sug
gesting the economy was still on
the Federal Reserve's glide path
for a "soft landing."
The Labor Department
reported that its Producer Price
Index, after posting worrisome
gains of 0.3 percent in both Jan
uary and February, showed no
increase at all in March as the
price of gasoline, autos and
women's clothing dropped.
Financial markets initially
rallied on the news with
economists taking heart from
the fact that the steep slide in
the dollar has so far failed to
show up in higher prices.
But the gains melted away
later in the day after remarks by
Federal Reserve board member
Janet Yellen called into question
the market's view that the Fed is
through raising interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial
average finished the day down
11.07 at 4,187.08. Bond prices,
however, were up, pushing the
yield on Treasury's benchmark

30-year bond down to 7.37 per
cent in late trading as many
investors continued to hold to
the view that benign inflation
reports were showing the Fed's
string of seven rate increases had
accomplished its inflation-fight
ing goals.
Many economists said the PPI
report added to their convictions
that the central bank has put
any further credit tightening on
hold.
The March figures for infla
tion at the retail level will be
released Wednesday. Some ana
lysts said the better-than-expect
ed wholesale number was caus
ing them to revise downward
their forecast for a rise in the
Consumer Price Index.
"Any pickup in inflation will
be minimal this year," said Bruce
Steinberg, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch in New York.
Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, speaking to a
gathering of central bank offi
cials in Stockholm, hailed the
"dramatic slowdown in the rate
of price inflation on a worldwide
basis" while emphasizing that "it
is important that this progress

continue."
But not all economists are
convinced that Greenspan and
his colleagues have succeeded in
avoiding a recession in their
campaign against inflation.
Alan Davidson, chief
economist at Zeus Securities Inc.
in Jericho, N.Y., predicted the
economy would be in a downturn
by the end of this year. He said
the central bank should actually
be lowering interest rates now
but can't afford to do so because
of the weakness of the dollar.
The zero rate of increase in
March was the best showing
since wholesale prices at the fin
ished-goods level actually
declined by 0.4 percent in Octo
ber.
Even more significant to some
analysts was the fact that price
pressures eased significantly at
the crude and intermediate lev
els of production, areas where
steep increases in previous
months had caused worries
about growing pressures in the
inflation pipeline. Crude prices
fell by 1.3 percent while products
at the intermediate level were up
just 0.3 percent.
