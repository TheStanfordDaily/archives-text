# TV tape contradicts testimony

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Spectators at the O.J.
Simpson trial gasped Monday when a newly
revealed TV news tape appeared to show two bare
handed criminalists touching a key piece of evi
dence at the murder scene.
The defense attack on criminalist Dennis Fung,
which frequently had the combative flair of a
"Perry Mason" episode, came after a five-day hiatus
dominated by juror problems and an investigation
by the judge.
Superior Court Judge Lance Ito appeared deter
mined to get the trial back on track with testimony,
although he disclosed that someone tried to com
municate with jurors on a weekend outing.
Fung, appearing weary and glum despite the
five-day break, told defense attorney Barry Scheck
that Scheck was wrong in his interpretation of the
brief videotaped scene, which television viewers did

not see because of technical problems.
Scheck maintained the object in question was an
envelope containing the prescription glasses of vic
tim Nicole Brown Simpson's mother, left behind at
a restaurant and returned by waiter Ronald Gold
man. That envelope, with the glasses still inside,
was later found in the blood at the slain Goldman's
feet.
"That's you getting the prescription envelope
from (criminalist) Andrea Mazzola, grasping it in
your bare hands, isn't it?" Scheck asked Fung after
the video was played at various speeds both back
ward and forward.
"No," Fung said. "I know my fingerprints are not
on that envelope."
Under questioning, he said he knew not to touch
evidence with his bare hands because it could oblit
erate other fingerprints.
