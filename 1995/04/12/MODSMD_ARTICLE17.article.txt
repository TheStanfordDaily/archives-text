Alzheimer's funds needed
WASHINGTON (AP) — Telling stories of fam
ily struggle and sacrifice, people touched by
Alzheimer's disease urged lawmakers yesterday
not to cut funds for research on the illness that
afflicts 4 million Americans.
"Our message to Congress is simple: You can
not save money by slowing down medical
research," actress Shelley Fabares told a Capitol
Hill news conference.
"We also want Congress to understand that
they will not solve any problems by making mas
sive cuts in Medicaid," said Fabares, a national
spokeswoman for the Alzheimer's Association.
"In fact, they will make things worse. . . . People
with Alzheimer's disease aren't suddenly going to
be able to take care of themselves."
About 600,000 people with the disease rely on
Medicaid, the government program that pays
medical costs for the poor, because they have used
up their savings to pay for long-term care,
Fabares said. The actress, who plays the career
woman and football wife on ABC's "Coach," lost
her mother to the disease.
Public awareness of Alzheimer's grew signifi
cantly after former President Reagan announced

in November that he is suffering from the disease,
and Nancy Reagan has made public service
announcements on the subject.
Accused murderer molested?
COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — The woman charged
with drowning her two sons told authorities that
her stepfather fondled her when she was a
teenager, but that she felt she had to protect him
because he was "the only father" she had.
Susan Smith, who faces a murder trial in July,
said the molestation started in the summer of
1987 and continued until a sheriffs investigation
began in March the next year, according to a sher
iff's report released yesterday.
According to family court records released in
February, Mrs. Smith's stepfather was never
charged with a crime but signed a March 25,
1988, court decree admitting the allegations.
Mrs. Smith's lawyers objected to release of the
records, arguing that they will hurt her defense.
On Monday, Circuit Judge William Howard
became the second judge to release such reports,
saying there was no evidence the defense would
be harmed. Two newspapers sued for access to the
documents.
