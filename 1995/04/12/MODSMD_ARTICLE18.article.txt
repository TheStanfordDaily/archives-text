Students' Rights prop
would have limited the
power of senate chair

THE STUDENTS' Rights Ini
tiative intended to put some
constitutional clamps on the
arbitrary power of the senate chair
to interpret the constitution as he
or she desires. Ironically, its
authors failed to clear the current
constitution's bureaucratic hoops,
and it will not be placed on next
week's ASSU ballot, according to
Elections Commissioner Jonathan
Berent.
Nonetheless, members of the
Students' Alliance who drafted the
Students' Rights Initiative tried to

address some much needed
reforms for the ASSU —
most importantly the cre
ation of a separate body to
check the senate's total
power to interpret its con
stitution.
And the initiative seems
to have more than just the

Alliance's endorsement. According
to People's Platform Council of
Presidents candidate and current
deputy senate chair Michael Choo,
"there are a lot of ideas in the Stu
dents' Rights Initiative that the
People's Platform supports."
In addition to taming the sen
ate, the initiative would guarantee
the right to fee refunds and open
financial records of the ASSU. It
would also make it easier for stu
dents and senators to bring "advi
sory referenda" to the ballot; these
would provide some much-needed
feedback on the current value of
the ASSU's services.
A second part of the Initiative
would bring several long-overdue
questions to the students immedi
ately: How has the current COP
done? Would you like a single pres
ident rather than a COP? Would
you prefer senators to be elected
from your own dorm or residence,
rather than at large? Do you think
the ASSU effectively represents

undergraduates more than gradu
ates? Do you think the senate
should be divided into graduate
and undergraduate bodies? Should
the student government and its
agencies become more indepen
dent of the University?
It's been far too long since such
questions were out in the open,
and many of the problems we've
seen over the past few years — like
the lack of action on graduate
interests in the senate, the bicker
ing over special fees and the lack of
strong leadership from the COP —
could be easily addressed if stu
dents were allowed to voice their
opinions. The senate doesn't seem
to want to hear the answers.
The authors of the bill should
immediately begin the process of
bringing this piece of legislation to

the students in a special
election, following the prop
er constitutional channels.
If Choo is to be believed,
both parties in the senate
support the thrust of the
measure, and action could
be swift to bring it before
the students. It would be an

amazing and rare example of the
senate working to reduce its own
petty politics and create a less fick
le student association that is more
in touch with Stanford students'
real interests.
As we have seen repeatedly this
year, however, the current senate
is a fickle group. Sometimes, sena
tors who disagreed with the senate
chair have been disqualified on
important votes for not wearing
their sweatshirt all day. At other
times, the constitutionally man
dated "sweatshirt rule" has been
virtually ignored.
One wonders what particular
aspects of the Students Rights Ini
tiative warranted such close
scrutiny of the constitutional
guidelines to keep it off the ballot.
Maybe it was the part that would
have posed this question to stu
dents: "Do you think that the
ASSU, as it is now, effectively rep
resents the interests of individual
students?"
