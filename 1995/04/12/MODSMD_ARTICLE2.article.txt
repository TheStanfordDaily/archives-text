# COP hopefuls stress diversity
## People's Platform slate says 'We Deserve Better' 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Coming back to Stanford this quarter
from Oxford, junior Rich Stolz found him
self in the middle of a whirlwind campaign.
"It wasn't as overwhelming as I

thought," Stolz said.
"I saw the train com
ing to hit me, but
when it did I was pre
pared. Now that I'm
in it, it hasn't been so
overwhelming that I
haven't been able to
keep up."

Stolz, along with
juniors Jon Oram, Nicole Vazquez and
Michael Choo, make up the "We Deserve
Better" Council of Presidents slate.
Sponsored by the People's Platform, the
four will challenge the Students' Alliance
and the Hammer and Coffin slates in the
COP election on April 19 and 20.
An American Studies major, Stolz is a
founder of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity,
co-chair of the Student Advisory Council of
the Haas Center for Public Service and a
former member of the COP Executive Cab
inet.
"If people have complaints about the
ASSU now, it was a lot worse last year,"
Stolz said. "I was on the COP Executive
Cabinet the year after there had been no
COP. There was a lot to get done, and the

administration was accustomed to there
being no COP."
As an executive cabinet member, Stolz
said he lobbied to put students on the Com
mittee for Undergraduate Education and
worked to save the Career Planning and
Placement Center, the Center for Teaching
and Learning and the ethnic centers from
budget cuts.
Stolz said he thinks that one strength of
the slate is its diversity.
"We are inclusive," Stolz said. "We rep
resent the whole student body. We will fight
to get action."
Oram, however, is a relative outsider to
the ASSU. Most of his involvement with
student activities has been through Stan
ford-in-Government, for which he has been
an assistant director, a director, chair of the
Public Policy Forum and treasurer.
Oram beirame involved with the ASSU
because of the effects of the Stanford Fund
policy and the special-fee system on Stan
ford-in-Government.
"Both issues threatened to cripple our
organization financially and I felt that I had
to do something about them, because I care
about the future of my organization," Oram
said. " [Later] I found that I actually enjoyed
doing this stuff. I really believe that I have
been called to public service. Helping stu
dents and student groups is important to
me. I just want to be able to make a positive
difference in students' lives."
