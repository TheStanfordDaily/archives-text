# COP hopefuls stress diversity
## People's Platform slate says 'We Deserve Better' 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Coming back to Stanford this quarter
from Oxford, junior Rich Stolz found him
self in the middle of a whirlwind campaign.
"It wasn't as overwhelming as I

thought," Stolz said.
"I saw the train com
ing to hit me, but
when it did I was pre
pared. Now that I'm
in it, it hasn't been so
overwhelming that I
haven't been able to
keep up."

Stolz, along with
juniors Jon Oram, Nicole Vazquez and
Michael Choo, make up the "We Deserve
Better" Council of Presidents slate.
Sponsored by the People's Platform, the
four will challenge the Students' Alliance
and the Hammer and Coffin slates in the
COP election on April 19 and 20.
An American Studies major, Stolz is a
founder of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity,
co-chair of the Student Advisory Council of
the Haas Center for Public Service and a
former member of the COP Executive Cab
inet.
"If people have complaints about the
ASSU now, it was a lot worse last year,"
Stolz said. "I was on the COP Executive
Cabinet the year after there had been no
COP. There was a lot to get done, and the

administration was accustomed to there
being no COP."
As an executive cabinet member, Stolz
said he lobbied to put students on the Com
mittee for Undergraduate Education and
worked to save the Career Planning and
Placement Center, the Center for Teaching
and Learning and the ethnic centers from
budget cuts.
Stolz said he thinks that one strength of
the slate is its diversity.
"We are inclusive," Stolz said. "We rep
resent the whole student body. We will fight
to get action."
Oram, however, is a relative outsider to
the ASSU. Most of his involvement with
student activities has been through Stan
ford-in-Government, for which he has been
an assistant director, a director, chair of the
Public Policy Forum and treasurer.
Oram beirame involved with the ASSU
because of the effects of the Stanford Fund
policy and the special-fee system on Stan
ford-in-Government.
"Both issues threatened to cripple our
organization financially and I felt that I had
to do something about them, because I care
about the future of my organization," Oram
said. " [Later] I found that I actually enjoyed
doing this stuff. I really believe that I have
been called to public service. Helping stu
dents and student groups is important to
me. I just want to be able to make a positive
difference in students' lives."

One issue on which Oram said
he would like to work is finding a
new corporate sponsor to subsidize
student athletic tickets.
"Selling student tickets would
be horribly unfair. It would mean
that the same 1,000 students
would get to go to all the games,"
Oram said. "This means that the
same people who now get those
Sixth Man shirts will dominate the
crowd for each and every game. I
think that Stanford students
deserve equal access to all sporting
events."
Oram added that sponsors
would be easy to find. "I'm sure
that there are sponsors out there
who would love to pay for some
thing like this," Oram said. "The
University just finds it easier to
make students pay."
Oram is currently studying at
the Stanford Program in Oxford,
but he will return for the election.
Vazquez said she thinks the
non-academic portion of students'
Stanford experiences is very signif
icant and as a COP member, she

would work to enhance it.
"It's important to me to have
something to parallel the academic
experience," Vazquez said. "Co
curricular activities form a large
part of the Stanford experience.
They enrich the vitality of the cam
pus community. Students should
be able to own the University. They
should be able to get out as much
as they are putting in."
A political science and English
major, Vazquez is currently an
undergraduate senator and has
been active in MEChA, Barrio
Assistance, Derechos and Ballet
Folklorico.
Vazquez said she hopes to
improve student life by empower
ing student organizations,
strengthening academic advising
and being responsive to student
needs.
Tuition and financial aid issues
are also important to Vazquez.
"Attention needs to be paid to
how students are affording it, how
much students are working and
how they balance it with their stud
ies," she said.
Choo, deputy ASSU senate
chair and a public policy major,
became involved in student govern
ment because of his frustration

about students' powerlessness.
"Freshman year, we had no
COP and many times I felt that the
University would make decisions
with effects on students' lives,
without the students having any
input," Choo said. "My involve
ment began in trying to fight bud
get cuts."
Choo said he would like to make
the ASSU relevant to students'
lives. Too much time in the past
has been spent on wrangling over
ASSU internal matters which
don't affect students, he said
Students deserve a proactive
COP, Choo said. "Students deserve
a real advocate in the senate on
issues which affect their lives
rather than on internal adminis
tration and rules or budget stuff.
We deserve a stronger say in Uni
versity policy-making before,
rather than after the fact."
Choo said he would like to work
on such issues as the high prices at
Tresidder Express and making the
ASSU relevant to graduate stu
dents, perhaps by providing a tax
service for graduate students.
"Only through a coordinated,
collective effort can we help stu
dents and their student activities,"
Choo said.
