## The 						fun and games of Rush 
### 
OVER THIS past weekend, I saw
three different frosh women in my
dorm crying about their experi
ences with sorority Rush. Since last
week, several hundred women have been
putting themselves through the time
consuming Rush process, hoping to be
invited into the sorority of their choice.
Obviously, this process had already led to
disappointment for many by the end of
the weekend.
Okay, I'll admit it, I rushed during my
freshman year. Just like many of this
year's freshmen and sophomores, I
wanted to explore what the Greek sys
tem might have to offer to me, but I was
not sure I wanted to actually pledge a
sorority. In the old days, sorority Rush
was conducted in a group of big white
tents which were set up in the middle of
Wilbur field. This location added a
degree of excitement and danger to the
Rush process which I believe has now
disappeared. To the disappointment and
consternation of many East Campus res
idents, sorority Rush is now conducted
indoors.
Back then, a number of unpredictable
situations arose at a moment's notice,
some due to uncontrollable causes, many
due to a group of very enterprising male
students. During the first several days,
the power generator broke down at least
three times, often cutting short the excit
ing and informative skits and songs
which were being presented to the young

rushees. During a period between Rush
parties when all of the rushees were wait
ing outside, a rain squall broke out, send
ing several hundred impeccably dressed
women scurrying under the one large
tree in the area. This scene must have
been quite comic to anyone who may
have witnessed it from the safety of their
dorm rooms.
This was not the only time that the
rushees were forced to take shelter from
the dangerous skies above. The young
men of Wilbur and Stern became quite
skilled at lobbing water balloons from the
roofs of their dorms, often hitting those
new Gap shoes and perfectly coiffed
hairstyles right on target.
By far the most innovative prank dur
ing that Rush season was an imposter
who supposedly made it through three
different sororities' tents before he was
found out. As you've probably guessed, a
transvestite had invaded our select
group. His incursion into this exclusively
feminine world was a subject which was
kept strictly hush-hush during the Rush
parties.
As for the activities going on inside the
big tents, the word "surreal" comes to
mind. There is no way to describe the
experience of parading down a double
line of singing, clapping sorority mem
bers who then proceed to grab you, chat
with you and then pass you off to anoth
er member every three minutes or so. So
many truly meaningful and memorable

conversations resulted from these
encounters. Not to mention those crazy
skits, which gave rushees the lowdown
on which fraternities each sorority par
tied with and emphasized how "diverse"
these groups of women truly are.
I'm not bringing these situations up to
make fun of the Rush process. Well,
okay, maybe I am. But there is another
important point hidden somewhere in
my walk down memory lane. The Greek
system is only one aspect of the diverse
Stanford community. Unlike many state
schools, one can still have a social life
outside of our small Greek population.
Stanford's restriction against rushing
before the end of our freshman year gives
us ample opportunity to make meaning
ful friendships and have a lot of fun with
out wearing Greek letters across our
chests.
Rush can be a disappointing experi
ence for some people but, come on, think
about it. Frat parties are not closed at
Stanford and, once a woman is inside, the
frat boys will still push the beer on her
just as they did before she rushed. That's
what I've found in my experience. You
don't need to be in a sorority for that.

Amanda spends at least two hours a week
clapping and singing just for the fun of
it.
