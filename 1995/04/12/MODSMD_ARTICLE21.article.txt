Fritz Reinhart was an invaluable friend to Stanford

lAM WRITING in tribute to a true
member of the Stanford family, who
recently passed away at a fearfully
young age.
Fritz Reinhart was a lecturer in the
mechanical engineering department. He
created the GM-sponsored Internal Com
bustion Engine Laboratory, where he
performed research and taught graduate
and undergraduate students for many
years. His classes were extremely popular
among students for many reasons.
Fritz offered the experience of a sea
soned auto mechanic in combination

with the theoretical understanding
gained in earning his Degree of Engineer
at Stanford. This translated into a class
room and laboratory environment
unique in the department, where all
aspects of engine knowledge were avail
able to the student, from the installation
of a supercharger to the explanation of
its effect through analysis and measure
ment of conditions within the cylinder.
His frequent joking on the misused
language of television car commercials
gave students practical knowledge even
as it lightened the mood of the class. He

was constantly available for questions. If
you couldn't find him at the lab, he
never minded an intrusion as he took a
coffee break on the Tresidder patio.
I am grateful that I was allowed to
work with Fritz over the years as a
course assistant. As his student, I had
admired his thorough and patient teach
ing style, as well as the magnificent
preparation of his laboratory. As his
assistant, I saw another side to him,
which is why I write this letter. Fritz
was genuinely kind-hearted. He felt for
his students, which is why he structured

his lab to save them busy work in turn
for exciting analytical problems. In fact,
he demonstrated feeling for all of us who
worked around him. Last spring, as I
was graduating and had not landed a
job, Fritz approached me without my
asking. He personally contacted two
companies on my behalf. Since August I
have been working at a job that he
helped me to obtain. Fritz was a sincere
and invaluable friend to me and to Stan
ford.
