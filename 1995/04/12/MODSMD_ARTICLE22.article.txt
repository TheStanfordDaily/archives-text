# Cars, like the bonfire, should be banned from the Stanford campus
## 
### 
Twice recently we have only narrowly
avoided treading on the poor pulverized
corpses of tiger salamanders, their
endearing marking√ü smeared with blood
and salamander innards. Their mangled
bodies, denied whatever burial rites are
common among salamanders, lay rotting

on the streets of the Stanford campus.
What fugitive from decency committed
these heinous murders? An automobile.
These defenseless amphibians met their
fate caught between rubber and asphalt.
The carnage has gone on long
enough. Tiger salamanders have a right
to live in whatever habitat they choose.
Whether they choose Lake Lagunita or
the streets of Stanford, we must let
them live there. Automobiles, cars and
vans alike, possess the power to kill sala
manders in their habitat; therefore, we
propose to ban all automobiles from the

Stanford campus. These instruments of
death have no place in a community
devoted to education.
Now, some defenders of the automo
bile may hold that salamanders have no
place on the streets; that in fact, auto
mobiles do only infinitesimal damage to
the salamander population; or that cars
don't kill salamanders, people kill sala
manders. To them we say that each and
every automobile exhales enormous
amounts of poisonous pollutants into
the air we breathe, endangering the lives
of every human on campus. In a single

year, automobiles produce many times
the amount of pollution caused by, say, a
Big Game Bonfire. For that alone we
should exile these accursed machines.
Since it is University policy to outlaw all
things that have the potential to harm
salamanders and pollute the air, we
expect that cars, like the bonfire, will
soon pass into the realm of Stanford leg
end.
