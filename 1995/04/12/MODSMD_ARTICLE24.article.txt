## Museum repairs delayed until October Construction may take 18-20 months; opening aimed for 1997 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
The start date for the restoration of
the Stanford Art Museum has been
pushed back to October of this year con
struction and is estimated to take 18 to
20 months.
"We dearly hope to reopen in the fall
of 1997," Museum Director Thomas
Seligman told members of the Mothers
Club in a speech yesterday.
Since the Loma Prieta Earthquake in
1989, the museum's doors have been
closed to the public.
The University has contracted with
Polshek and Partners and has hired
Richard Olcott as the principal architect,
Seligman said, adding that he hopes the
museum will be ready by Homecoming
Weekend two years from now.
According to Seligman, the two
rotundas — which were the worst hit by
the earthquake — will be kept in the
final design. Lomita Way, which runs in
the front of the museum, will be turned
into a pedestrian and bike path.
In addition to modernizing the cur

rent museum, the University is planning
to add a new 40,000-square-foot wing.
The two wings of the Anatomy and
Health Resources and Policy Building,
located behind the museum, are sched
uled to be removed to make space for the
museum's expansion.

The earthquake was "one of the most
critical times in the museum's history"
because it forced the University to com
pletely rethink its plans for the museum,
Seligman said.
Of the roughly 20,000 objects of art in
the museum, only five were damaged in
the quake. Since then, all five have been
successfully restored.
All the pieces in the museum have
also been custom packed and will be

moved to Encina Gymnasium in May.
Security measures and "modest environ
ment control" have already been put in
place in Encina to protect the pieces,
Seligman said.
The total project cost for the muse
um's restoration has been put at $30
million to $31 million. Seligman said
that at the present time, $27 million has
been raised, including $1.4 million from
the Committee of Art, $5.1 million from
the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and $10 million from Iris and B.
Gerald Cantor, who are also responsible
for virtually all of the Auguste Rodin
sculptures in the museum's collection.
At its reopening, the museum will be
renamed the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor
Center for the Visual Arts at Stanford.
"One of the silver linings from this
whole thing ... is that we have the
opportunity to do a complete inventory,"
Seligman said. A full museum inventory
has not been done since 1917.
"It's a time-consuming, laborious and
tedious process," but it has allowed the
University and the museum to "rational
ize what we have," he said.
