Q:Why does the moon look so big when it's
near the horizon?

A:This may not be as glamorous as Pop Rocks
and Coke, or flammable bodily emissions,
but I figured it was time to get back to some
of those underappreciated questions that lots of
people ask but very few people know the answer
to. Also, most people who think they know the
answer are wrong (even professors), so this might
be a good way to humiliate your favorite know-it
all.
In case you haven't spent enough evenings
under the moonlight recently, go outside some
time when the moon is low in the sky. The moon
will look eerily large. Particularly around full
moon, the effect can be pretty amazing.

The Science Bug

Many people, all the way back to Aristotle,
claimed that the moon looked large due to some
physical effect. But the moon is not any closer to
the earth; its distance actually varies little. And
it's not a weird effect of the atmosphere — for
a couple of minutes before the sun or moon sets
it will be slightly distorted due to refraction of
the atmosphere, but this can't account for the
moon looking huge when it's lower down in the
sky.
In fact, it's actually pretty easy to prove that
the moon is actually the same size no matter
where in the sky it is. If you hold up a ruler at
arm's length, and measure the moon at different
heights, you'll find it doesn't change. It's even
been checked more rigorously with photographs
and other high-tech methods, and there is no dif
ference.
So the "moon illusion," as it's known, is just
that — an optical illusion. It's purely a psycholog
ical effect.
But that just leads to the next question — what
kind of crazy wiring in the brain makes us see the
moon as larger near the horizon? This is a little
bit harder to answer.
Countless theories have again been offered for
this, some of which sound pretty crazy. One per
son back in 1899 claimed that when you looked
upwards, gravity pulled on your retina, stretching
your eye out and making things seem further
away. This, needless to say, was quickly ruled out,
except by those of us who do 100 much acid.
The most widely accepted theory today is
known as the "apparent distance' theory. Basi
cally, when you look at the moon overhead, you
have no visual clues to help you figure out how far
away it is. But when it's low in the sky, you know
it's way past whatever is on the horizon. So if the
spot of light is the same size but your brain thinks
it's further away, it makes the automatic decision
that the moon itself must be bigger. So you per
ceive it as larger.
There's some pretty good evidence to support
this explanation. First, you can prove that the
horizon is necessary. Bend over and put your head
between your legs and try looking at the moon.
(Make sure that nobody you know is watching.)
Suddenly, the moon seems a lot smaller, because
you can't use the underlying horizon as a distance
gauge.
People have also arranged mirrors so that the
overhead moon appears just over the horizon,
and sure enough it looks bigger.
And it's not just that you use trees or houses as
a "measuring stick." Even if you're in the desert
or looking out over the ocean, without anything to
directly measure size, the effect still works.
Furthermore, it's been shown that most people
think of the horizon as further away than the
zenith (the highest point in the sky above head),
even looking at an empty sky. It's like your brain
thinks we're living in a dome, where the roof is
closer than things that are far away. Which makes
sense, because until recently, nobody had a good
way of telling how high things were, whereas you
can try walking to the horizon.
So if you take the same size spot but you think
the horizon is further away, it's natural for your
brain to think that the moon itself is larger. Of
course, there is still some contention over this
subject, so check it out for yourself sometime.
Just make sure there's no silent motion detectors
before you go up on any roofs — it seems the
police don't take too kindly to that.
