# Gravity Probe B will set out to examine aspects of the theory of general relativity
## Stanford, NASA and Lockheed test Einstein 
### Anand Ramachandran Contributing writer 
Although Einstein first proposed
his general theory of relativity near
ly 70 years ago, the theory has never
been tested — until now.
A team of Stanford scientists is
working to build a satellite to test
Einstein's theory. The Gravity
Probe B (GPB) - Relativity Mission
is a joint venture of Stanford Uni
versity, Lockheed Missiles and
Space Company and NASA.
The theory of general relativity is
Einstein's revolutionary explana
tion of gravitation. Einstein envi
sioned gravity not as a Newtonian
force, but as a "field distorting space
and time." The general theory dif
fers from the more popularly known
special relativity, which deals with
the perception of time and the speed
of light.
The Relativity Mission will try to
check two results predicted by Ein
stein. The first result is called the
geodetic effect. First, imagine space
and time to be connected into a sort
of flat wire frame "mesh sheet." If
placed on this sheet, a star or plane
tary body — the Earth for example

— would create a slight depression
in the sheet because of the gravita
tional field of the planet. One can
picture this effect like a marble
lying on a bed sheet.
The second result is the so-called
frame-dragging effect. If the marble
in the depression on the bed sheet
were to be twisted, the sheet would
twist as well. In fact, the rotating
Earth produces just such a twisting
effect in the mesh surrounding the
planet. The mesh is dragged around
as the Earth spins.
Using very precise instruments,
the Relativity Mission will try to
measure the geodetic and frame
dragging effects of the Earth. To do
this, four incredibly precise gyro
scopes are being constructed here at
Stanford. The gyroscopes will be
placed into a block of fused quartz.
This block will then be inserted into
a sort of "giant thermos bottle,"
explained Dr. Francis Everitt, prin
cipal investigator of the GPB Pro
ject.
The bottle contains several hun
dred gallons of liquid helium which
will allow the gyroscopes to spin
freely once in space at about 10,000
rpm. The entire structure will be fit

ted onto a satellite to be launched
aboard a Titan II rocket. So precise
are these gyroscopes that they can
determine the width of a human
hair at a distance of 100 miles.
According to Einstein, the geodetic
and frame-dragging effects would
cause a freely-spinning gyroscope in
space to slowly change its direction.
This change in direction is what the
GPB will try to measure.
However, there is more to the
GPB project than simply spinning
gyroscopes and mesh sheets.
Though the project itself was start
ed in the 19605, it is expected to be
finished ahead of schedule, within
five years. Scores of faculty, under
graduate and graduate students
have worked on the project over the
years, including astronaut Sally
Ride and current Stanford Physics
Prof. Charles Marcus. Currently,
over 50 students alone are involved
in the research. Seven other aca
demic institutions are collaborating
in the project as well.
In addition to the large number
of participants, the project itself has
been responsible for a myriad of sci
entific accomplishments. For exam
ple, the gyroscopes consist of per

haps the most perfect spheres ever
made by man, contained within a
shell of quartz and floating in an
electrical field. The quartz-niobium
spheres are so nearly perfectly
round that if the spheres are magni
fied to the size of the Earth, the ele
vation of the highest mountain
would be barely eight feet. Further
advances have been made in cryo
genics, magnetics, quantum devices
and telescopy, to name just a few
areas.
Finally, one may ask why verify
ing or disproving Einstein's theory
is so important. The reason is that
the general theory of relativity
remains one of the last truly untest
ed formulations of science — one
that connects space, time and gravi
ty to everything from our own plan
et to the farthest black holes. Its
importance is evidenced by the
observation that the same gravity
that keeps us on the Earth also con
trols how the Earth revolves around
the sun, and the sun around the
center of the galaxy and so on. The
Relativity Mission will try to shed
some light on the reasons why grav
ity, and the universe in general,
behave the way they do.
