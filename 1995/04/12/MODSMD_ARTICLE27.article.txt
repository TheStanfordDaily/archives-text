# Does milk really do your body any good?
## The
						relationship between calcium and protein holds the key to this question 
### Janna Gordon-Elliott Brian Halweil 
The "Milk: It does a body good" campaign, spon
sored by the National Dairy Council, has provided
many ingenious and memorable television commer
cials. The commercials portray scrawny adolescents
blossoming into strikingly attractive adults as they
consume more milk.
Such ads remind one of the first time Snap, Crack
le and Pop hit prime time, or th* "Hefty, Hefty,
Hefty, wimpy, wimpy, wimpy," garbage bag jingle.
Yet, while Rice Krispies do, in fact, snap, crackle and
pop, and Hefty garbage bags are the strongest con
sumer garbage bags around, milk may not be as good
for the human body as one is led to think.
In its commercials, the National Dairy Council
conveys the impression that milk (a good source of
both protein and calcium) is an essential ingredient
fcr proper bodily growth.
As a good source of animal protein, milk's status is
unquestionable. A serving size of cow's milk may pro
vide as much as 10 grams of protein (15 percent of
the total calories of the serving), more if the milk is
protein-fortified. However, recent nutritional
research — as well as newly uncovered research dat
ing back 50 years — has called into doubt milk's role
as a source of calcium for human beings. In fact,
some studies demonstrate that milk may actually
cause the body to lose calcium. None of this new
research was conducted, or sponsored, by the Nation
al Dairy Council, but pervades the Journal of Clinical
Nutrition, Medical Tribune, British Medical Journal,
Lancet, and other internationally-acclaimed publica
tions.
Calcium, as we are continuously taught, is an
important component in maintaining and repairing
bone structure. But despite the popular notion that
this is calcium's primary role in human physiology,
calcium commands other essential functions — func
tions which, in fact, take priority over the skeletal
needs.
John Robbins, nutritionist and founder of the
Earth Save foundation, states that the human body
requires calcium for several vital functions, "such as
controlling muscular contractions, including the
heart, blood clotting, transmission of nerve impulses
and other utterly essential tasks." Furthermore,
when the non-skeletal functions demand calcium, the
body draws the calcium from bones, which begin to
serve as a calcium bank.
One of the mtyor, non-skeletal functions which
calcium serves is to help maintain blood pH balance,
especially when the body consumes and breaks down
protein. Former Stanford Surgery Prof. Ronald Elliot
explains calcium's role in this process: "Amino acids
tend to acidify the blood, which causes a compensato
ry withdrawal of skeletal calcium to neutralize the
arid and keep natural blood pH." The ramifications
of this phenomenon are that, as the body consumes
more protein, more calcium will be leached out of
bones to balance the additional acidity.

This process of drawing calcium out of bones obvi
ously can be quite dangerous for the human body. In
extreme cases, this can lead to osteoporosis, kidney
stones, diminished growth and other disorders.
Therefore, it is essential to get enough calcium, so
that non-skeletal functions are not continuously
depleting bone calcium reserves.
Milk has traditionally been heralded as an excel
lent source of calcium, but this is not completely cor
rect. To understand this, the distinction between a
substance which is a good source of calcium and a
substance which contains a large amount of calcium
becomes important. Just because a substance con
tains a great deal of calcium does not mean that the
consumer will be able to benefit from the calcium
contained in the source.
Milk, as far as natural substances go, contains a
large amount of calcium. There is a complex set of
chemical processes (requiring vitamin D and certain
enzymes, among other things) which involve the
human body's uptake of calcium from milk. It is
important to note that even if one is able to absorb
calcium into the blood stream, one must be able to
retain that calcium or else it will serve no purpose at
all and simply be lost through urination. The combi
nation of these two processes — calcium uptake and
calcium retention — determines milk's merit as a
source of calcium.
Milk is high in animal protein. As a result, milk
(more specifically the amino acids in milk) tends to
leach calcium out of the bones. As a source of calcium,

milk can be seen as self-defeating.
When humans consume milk, the cal
cium in the milk is lost as a result of
the protein in the milk — one does
not even retain the calcium that one
sought to obtain. It follows that a diet
high in protein (in excess of the pro
tein which humans require) will leach
additional calcium out of bones. This
is, in fact, true.
One may, at this point, wonder if
the fact that mammals produce milk,
and provide it as a major source of
nourishment for newborns, is some
blip in the course* of evolution (actual
ly working against the well-being of
offspring). But humans only drink
human milk when they are infants.
After that time, humans choose to
consume cows' milk, or perhaps goats'
milk.
The protein content of cows' milk
(and goats' milk) is significantly
greater than the protein content of
human milk; cows' milk contains 15
percent protein by calories, goats' milk
contains 17 percent and human milk
contains five percent. This difference
in protein content is enough to
increase calcium leaching greatly.
Evolutionarily, the milk for newborn

mammals is species-specific. Any behavior counter to
the process of evolution tends to have ill-results.
The calcium-leaching phenomenon seems to lock
milk-drinkers into a never-ending loop of calcium loss
and compensatory milk consumption. Lowering the
protein content of one's diet can largely eliminate
this problem. Eliminating meat, eggs and other such
protein sources from one's diet will accomplish this
protein reduction. Not consuming dairy products
such as milk, yogurt and cheese (all high in animal
proteins) would also lower the leaching process.
How, then, can one expect to get enough calcium
or protein in one's diet? Protein derived from veg
etable sources — such as soybeans, broccoli, and
spinach — other legumes, wheat and other vegeta
bles, contain less acidic amino acids than animal
sources and thus leach less calcium. All of these
sources, and vegetarian diets in general, can provide
a person with more than enough protein.
As far as calcium is concerned, green vegetables
and other plants are quite high in calcium. These
same substances do not contain the counterproduc
tive protein. Even if one continues to include meat in
one's diet, green vegetables and other vegetarian
sources of protein should be consumed as a source of
calcium. Alternatively, many people turn to calcium
supplements in pill form. Yet studies have shown
that the body has a hard time absorbing such large,
concentrated amounts of calcium. Also, the pill form
of calcium may encourage calcium deposits within
the body, leading to another set of serious problems.
