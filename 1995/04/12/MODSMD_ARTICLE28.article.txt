## Tennis sends Utes back home winless

Stanford 5

Rick Majerus could be binge
eating right now.
The Utah basketball coach
might well be disappointed with
the performance of his universi
ty's men's tennis team yesterday
at Stanford Tennis Stadium. The
top-ranked Stanford men (19-0)
dismantled No. 49 Utah (12-8) by
a 5-2 count.
The margin of victory would
have been even greater — and
Majerus' food tab even higher —
had Stanford's normal No. 2 sin
gles player, Scott Humphries, not
sat out the day with a minor
muscle pull in his arm. His
replacement in the lineup, fresh
man Charles Hoeveler, filled in at
No. 6 singles, where he was
unable to pull out any of the tie
breakers in a 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (13-
11) loss to Richard Nuttall.
"I wasn't match tough, but
each match I play I get more and
more match tough. Today I just
didn't have the toughness needed
to pull it out," said Hoeveler, who
was only playing his third singles
match of the year.

Stanford avoided a letdown
after an emotionally wrenching
weekend of road victories against
top-notch teams.
"After matches like the ones
down there at UCLA and USC,
you just have to go out there,
focus and play hard, which is
what I did in my match and what
the team did pretty much over
all," said sophomore Grant
Elliott.
Elliott upped his team-leading
record to 18-1 with a 6-2, 6-3
defeat of Brandon Hodges. Elliott
has won 15 consecutive matches
since defaulting in a match early
in the season.
Sixth-ranked Jeff Salzenstein
took care of the Runnin' Utes top
representative, Christian Svens
son, 6-2, 6-2.
Moving up one position to No.
2 singles, 36th-ranked Paul Gold
stein wasted little time with Mag
nus Hjalmerson, winning 6-4, 6-
2.
Jim Thomas continued to per
form well for the Cardinal,
defeating Brandon Owen, 6-3, 6-
3." Jim played really well today,
especially in doubles," said Stan
ford head coach Dick Gould,
referring to Thomas' perfor
mance with Ricky Becker in a 8-4
defeat of Svensson and Owen in
No. 1 doubles.
Becker suffered a 7-6, 1-6, 7-5

defeat to Glenn Irwin in No. 5 sin
gles. The Stanford junior was bat
tling a mild case of the flu in addi
tion to Irwin.
In the other doubles matches,
Salzenstein and Elliott defeated
Hjalmerson and Hodges, 8-3 in
No. 2 doubles. And Goldstein
teamed with Hoeveler in No. 3
doubles to defeat Irwin and Nut
tal, 8-3. A national father-son
doubles champion, Hoeveler is 5-
0 this year as roving doubles part
ner.
