# Goldie and Hump, dynamic duo
## Doubles team made of two great tastes that taste great together 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
When two 11-year-old tennis
prodigies first met each other at
an under-12 tournament eight
years ago, they knew they were
both on the fast track to tennis
success. But they didn't know
they'd be traveling down differ
ent roads that would intersect
seven years later in Stanford,
Calif.
Somewhere in their develop
ment as players and people, the
top-ranked Cardinal's freshmen
sensations Paul Goldstein and
Scott Humphries became differ
ent but the same. They are long
time friends with athletic poten
tial as limitless as the sky. And
yet these high-flying birds are
not of the same feather.
Both former national team
members entered Stanford with
impressive junior credentials:
Goldstein was the first three
time IJSTA national junior
champion while Humphries last
year became the first American
since 1981 to win the boys' title
at Wimbledon. As doubles part
ners, the duo reached the finals
of the 1994 U.S. Junior Open.
Together they have helped
offset the loss of four seniors
from last year's Cardinal squad,
helping the team to a spotless 18-
0 record. They are the nation's
second-ranked doubles team,
and in singles competition, the
25th-ranked Humphries and
36th-ranked Goldstein have
compiled 14-3 and 16-2 records
at Nos. 2 and 3 singles positions,
respectively.
"They've blended in really
well with the team. You'd think
two guys with their credentials
would be cocky, yet they're really
very modest and willing to help
the team," says junior captain
Jeff Salzenstein.

So what could be so different
about them?
Tennis upbringings
At the age of 12 Humphries
traveled from his home in
Alamo, Calif, to attend the ten
nis academy of Palmer Prep in
Florida, where he would be for
the next five years. It is a 55-stu
dent hotbed of future tennis pros
in which academic classes are
scheduled in between rigorous
tennis lessons and matches.
"A lot of touring pros came
through who I could simulate my
game after," Humphries says.
Goldstein opted to stay closer
to his Rockville, Md. home by
attending the Sidwell Friends
School in Washington, D.C.,
where Chelsea Clinton began
ninth-grade during his senior
year.

"I didn't want to be exposed to
tennis 24/7" he says."I needed to
get away from tennis from 8 a.m.
to 3 p.m. every day. It kept me
hungry for it when I was away
from it. My priorities were aca
demic, social, and then tennis."
Goldstein doesn't regret the
route he has taken, even though
he knows it may have stunted his
development into a future pro.
"By not going to the academy,
I certainly sacrificed some of my
opportunities in tennis, but
being around socially was pretty
beneficial to me."
Personalities
"Goldie and Hump are two
great guys to hang out with,"
says Salzenstein, using his team
mates' nicknames.
But Humphries and Goldstein
each have unique demeanors.

Humphries explains: "We're
both pretty laid back. A lot of
times I'll stay more quiet and do
my own thing, but he has always
gotta be talking to somebody.
I'm content to sit down, and he
can't stand still. I don't have to
be doing something every
minute of the day, whereas he
does. He always wants to know
what's going on."
Goldstein takes a genealogical
approach to his partner's differ
ing personality. "Scott's a really
independent person — more
independent than me because
I've only lived on my own for six
months, whereas he's lived on
his own since the age of 12."
"Even though he went to a
tennis academy, he turned into
an unbelievably well-rounded
individual. Scott is an example of

omeone who went to the acade
my and was still able to lead a bal
anced life."
In a sport with a reputation for
brat-breeding, Goldstein and
Humphries find ways to endear
themselves to others. Their per
-1 onalities may differ, but both are
extremely well-liked by players
and fans alike.
"They are really universally
respected in life — or as close to it
as you can be," says head coach
Dick Gould.
Goldstein won the Sportsman
ship Award at the National
Indoor Doubles Championships,
;in impressive accomplishment
when one considers that such an
.iward is usually reserved as con
solation for one of the losers
rather than the tournament
champion.

Psychology and style of play
"On the court Paul is a lot
more energetic, bouncing the ball
between his legs and walking
back and forth. I'm conserving
my energy between points, taking
a deep breath and getting ready to
play the next point," says
Humphries.
Humphries is more the
methodologist, following what
looks like almost a set routine
with his towel throughout the
match, drying himself and his
racquet when need be.
There is a method, however, to
Goldstein's madness. His antics,
he says, have "always been a
habit."
As for playing styles, the two
match up very well. "They're
both equally dominant. They
just dominate in different ways,"
explains teammate Ricky Beck
er.
Humphries and Goldstein's
singles games' complement each
other when combined on the dou

bles court. Like any of the great
doubles teams — McEnroe and
Fleming, for example —
Humphries and Goldstein com
bine differing styles of play into a
total doubles package.
Goldstein is a natural baselin
er with great hands and returns.
Humphries' biggest strengths are
his serves, his world-class volleys
and his accurate and powerful
overheads.
They respect each other's
games, knowing that each play
er's strengths compensates for
the other's weaknesses. And they
feed off each other emotionally.
"We've been good friends with
each other over the years, so we
never give up on each other on the
court," Goldstein says.
And after Stanford?
Gould thinks both players
need to make different improve
ments in their games. He says
both "are learning a style of play

that will allow them to adapt to
their opponents and change gears
when they have to."
Goldstein has improved his
serves and volleys under Gould's
tutelage, while Humphries has
learned the hard way in some of
his matches that his attacking
style of play doesn't work against
all players. These are things any
young college player learns very
early, and Goldstein and
Humphries are apparently learn
ing well.
Gould explains: "In general
you can get frustrated when you
play against some of the guys
who weren't necessarily great
juniors but have leveled off in col
lege because they have had a
chance to play day in and day out
with their teammates. Scott and
Paul have handled that very well.
A lot of people have said, 'Oh,
these guys are so good and
they're gonna come in and take
over college tennis.' But of course
it hasn't been that way. It

could've been a lot easier out on
the pro tour playing against guys
you have nothing to lose playing
against."
Goldstein says he hasn't given
much thought to turning pro, but
Humphries says it definitely
entered into his own decision to
play for Gould.
"I thought coming here would
allow my game to mature and
help down the road, and you don't
get many academic chances like
the one to come to Stanford," says
Humphries.
Who knows? Both Goldstein
and Humphries might follow like
paths from here on. Both will
probably try their hands on the
pro circuit; Humphries has
already performed impressively
in several ATP events this year.
But for now they are just two kids
playing the hands they were
dealt, trying to parlay their
respective talents into one crown
they have yet to wear: an NCAA
championship.
