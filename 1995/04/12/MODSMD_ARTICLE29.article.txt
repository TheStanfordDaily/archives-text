# Goldie and Hump, dynamic duo
## Doubles team made of two great tastes that taste great together 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
When two 11-year-old tennis
prodigies first met each other at
an under-12 tournament eight
years ago, they knew they were
both on the fast track to tennis
success. But they didn't know
they'd be traveling down differ
ent roads that would intersect
seven years later in Stanford,
Calif.
Somewhere in their develop
ment as players and people, the
top-ranked Cardinal's freshmen
sensations Paul Goldstein and
Scott Humphries became differ
ent but the same. They are long
time friends with athletic poten
tial as limitless as the sky. And
yet these high-flying birds are
not of the same feather.
Both former national team
members entered Stanford with
impressive junior credentials:
Goldstein was the first three
time IJSTA national junior
champion while Humphries last
year became the first American
since 1981 to win the boys' title
at Wimbledon. As doubles part
ners, the duo reached the finals
of the 1994 U.S. Junior Open.
Together they have helped
offset the loss of four seniors
from last year's Cardinal squad,
helping the team to a spotless 18-
0 record. They are the nation's
second-ranked doubles team,
and in singles competition, the
25th-ranked Humphries and
36th-ranked Goldstein have
compiled 14-3 and 16-2 records
at Nos. 2 and 3 singles positions,
respectively.
"They've blended in really
well with the team. You'd think
two guys with their credentials
would be cocky, yet they're really
very modest and willing to help
the team," says junior captain
Jeff Salzenstein.

So what could be so different
about them?
Tennis upbringings
At the age of 12 Humphries
traveled from his home in
Alamo, Calif, to attend the ten
nis academy of Palmer Prep in
Florida, where he would be for
the next five years. It is a 55-stu
dent hotbed of future tennis pros
in which academic classes are
scheduled in between rigorous
tennis lessons and matches.
"A lot of touring pros came
through who I could simulate my
game after," Humphries says.
Goldstein opted to stay closer
to his Rockville, Md. home by
attending the Sidwell Friends
School in Washington, D.C.,
where Chelsea Clinton began
ninth-grade during his senior
year.

"I didn't want to be exposed to
tennis 24/7" he says."I needed to
get away from tennis from 8 a.m.
to 3 p.m. every day. It kept me
hungry for it when I was away
from it. My priorities were aca
demic, social, and then tennis."
Goldstein doesn't regret the
route he has taken, even though
he knows it may have stunted his
development into a future pro.
"By not going to the academy,
I certainly sacrificed some of my
opportunities in tennis, but
being around socially was pretty
beneficial to me."
Personalities
"Goldie and Hump are two
great guys to hang out with,"
says Salzenstein, using his team
mates' nicknames.
But Humphries and Goldstein
each have unique demeanors.

Humphries explains: "We're
both pretty laid back. A lot of
times I'll stay more quiet and do
my own thing, but he has always
gotta be talking to somebody.
I'm content to sit down, and he
can't stand still. I don't have to
be doing something every
minute of the day, whereas he
does. He always wants to know
what's going on."
Goldstein takes a genealogical
approach to his partner's differ
ing personality. "Scott's a really
independent person — more
independent than me because
I've only lived on my own for six
months, whereas he's lived on
his own since the age of 12."
"Even though he went to a
tennis academy, he turned into
an unbelievably well-rounded
individual. Scott is an example of
