# Casper rejects grape boycott
## Administration decides against departmental, University-wide bans 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Stanford will neither sup
port a University-wide boycott
of grapes nor allow administra
tive units to boycott, although
residences will still have a
choice, University President
Gerhard Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice said in a
statement dated today.
The statement is in re
sponse to a report made in Feb-

ruary and released today by the Grape Policy
Committee that recommended both residences
and administrative units have the choice to boy
cott.
"We believe, as does a majority of the com

mittee, that a University-wide boycott of grapes
is not justified," the committee's report said.
The committee was formed after students on
a hunger strike last spring demanded a grape
boycott in response to grape farmers' treatment
of their workers, who are mostly Chicano / Lati
no.
Current policy allows residences, but not ad
ministrative units, to vote on a boycott. The new
policy would in effect continue the current policy
but give more University support to student ed
ucation on the issues.
Casper explained the decision by arguing that
administrative units are representative of the
University — while residences are relatively in
dependent — and any action taken by the units
could be perceived to be University-wide policy.
The University should not make a political
statement on an issue like grapes, Casper said.

"That was the single most im
portant aspect" in making the
decision, he said.
The committee, made up of
10 students and faculty mem
bers and chaired by Political
Science Prof. Luis Fraga, di
rector of the Stanford Center
for Chicano Research, recom
mended that the University
"expand its current policy of al-

lowing and encouraging University units to
make informed decisions about participating in
a grape boycott."
Stanford "should require where possible, and
encourage where not possible, all University
units to make regular, formal decisions whether

or not to boycott grapes," the com
mittee's report said. "A Universi
ty-wide committee should be
appointed by the president to
determine ... the decision-making
processes to be used by academic
and administrative units and ...
educational programs to be made
available to the University com
munity."
But Casper and Rice proposed a
plan similar to that currently in
effect, which they said is "prefer
able to what the committee recom
mended: a complex University
wide system that would be difficult
to administer."
Residences are "in a sense, local
communities that engage in a mea
sure of self-governance, deciding
collectively their rules and regula
tions for residential life," the state
ment said. "This is clearly differ
ent from administrative units,
which are not collectively governed
residential communities."
Fraga declined to comment on
the president's statement.
The administration's statement
also argued that the University's
"increasing diversity makes it
more important than ever that the
University not take political

stands on the ground that a partic
ular group, or a portion of a group,
feels strongly about a specific
cause.
"Doing so would cast the presi
dent and officers of Stanford as
judges of the relative moral and
political weight of the positions of
the University'B many voices," the
statement said. "Taken to its
extreme the University would
become a patchwork of limitations
and regulations based on the polit
ical causes of different groups.
That we cannot permit."
Implementing a complete boy
cott of grapes would mean the Uni
versity would be taking a political
position, Casper said. "I very much
hope that the Stanford community
will understand that the opposite
is really important for us to take as
a position to keep the University
[from being] torn apart," he said.
The Grape Policy Committee's
recommendation was one of four
options voted on by the committee.
The other three options — that
Stanford have no policy on grapes,
that Stanford continue its current
policy or that Stanford adopt a
University-wide boycott —
received little support among com
mittee members.
Through the final recommen
dation, Stanford would be able to
fulfill its role as "a good citizen of
California by taking a position,

when appropriate, on issues of par
ticular concern to California," the
committee report said.
"The issue of grapes is of deep
importance to a significant seg
ment of the University's students,
staff and faculty," the report con
tinued. "The University's actions
on this matter will necessarily
have a major effect on how [Chi
cano / al individuals perceive their
role in the University."
The grape policy is "very impor
tant to some members of the com
munity," Casper said, but the Uni
versity must refrain from making
political statements of this sort.
It follows, he said, that adminis
trative units within the University
should not be allowed to determine
individual grape policies.
"Administrative units have to
do with University functions,"
Casper said. "They are not meant
as self-governing with respect to
issues of this kind, and therefore,
if the administrative units were to
vote on this, too, then actually,
Stanford University would,
through the back door, begin to
take positions on this."
Residences voting to boycott or
not boycott grapes have that right,
Casper said, but "if an administra
tive unit takes a position, that will
be attributed very easily to the
University."
Stanford's influence should be

used "to bear on the political pro
cess ... only when such issues
directly affect the core teaching
and research mission or other
important institutional interests,"
the statement said.
The administration will further
support dorms in making individu
al decisions on the boycott, the
statement said.
The committee's report main
tained that "the existing system of
dorm-wide votes on the grape boy
cott has never been implemented
clearly or consistently.
"Moreover, it has placed virtu
ally all the burden of educating
and monitoring the University on
this issue in the hands of some
Chicano / a students who feel very
strongly about it,"the report said.
Casper and Rice promised to
have the Dean of Students and
Office of Residential Education
collect information for use by resi
dences. Resident Fellows and Resi
dential Assistants will be "asked to
ensure that there will be a fair
opportunity to raise the grapes
issues in the course of the house
meetings," the statement said.
Now that the recommendations
and statement have been formally
made, Casper said, he thinks the
grape debate will return to the
dorms once again.
"I don't think it will be over at
all." he said.
