# Casper rejects grape boycott
## Administration decides against departmental, University-wide bans 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Stanford will neither sup
port a University-wide boycott
of grapes nor allow administra
tive units to boycott, although
residences will still have a
choice, University President
Gerhard Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice said in a
statement dated today.
The statement is in re
sponse to a report made in Feb-

ruary and released today by the Grape Policy
Committee that recommended both residences
and administrative units have the choice to boy
cott.
"We believe, as does a majority of the com

mittee, that a University-wide boycott of grapes
is not justified," the committee's report said.
The committee was formed after students on
a hunger strike last spring demanded a grape
boycott in response to grape farmers' treatment
of their workers, who are mostly Chicano / Lati
no.
Current policy allows residences, but not ad
ministrative units, to vote on a boycott. The new
policy would in effect continue the current policy
but give more University support to student ed
ucation on the issues.
Casper explained the decision by arguing that
administrative units are representative of the
University — while residences are relatively in
dependent — and any action taken by the units
could be perceived to be University-wide policy.
The University should not make a political
statement on an issue like grapes, Casper said.

"That was the single most im
portant aspect" in making the
decision, he said.
The committee, made up of
10 students and faculty mem
bers and chaired by Political
Science Prof. Luis Fraga, di
rector of the Stanford Center
for Chicano Research, recom
mended that the University
"expand its current policy of al-

lowing and encouraging University units to
make informed decisions about participating in
a grape boycott."
Stanford "should require where possible, and
encourage where not possible, all University
units to make regular, formal decisions whether
