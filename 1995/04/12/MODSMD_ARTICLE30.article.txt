### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
In its first year as a varsity sport, Stan
ford women's lacrosse is definitely mak
ing a statement.
After a runner-up finish in last week
end's Western States Tournament in
Santa Cruz, Calif., the Cardinal (16-5)
controls its own destiny for the right to
bypass the April 29-30 qualifying tourna
ment for the Final Four.
After avenging last year's loss to UC-
Davis in Sunday's semifinals with a con
vincing 7-1 victory, the squad came up a
goal short in the championship game
against a club team from San Francisco's
East Bay, falling 6-5.
"We played very well all weekend
long," said junior co-captain Peppie
Stephenson. "It was kind of disappointing
to lose to the San Francisco club team,
because we know eventually we can do it."
The East Bay squad, which defeated
Stanford earlier in the season, features
Cardinal head coach Kay Cowperthwait.
Despite the awkward situation of playing
against their current coach, Stanford
maintained its composure and battled
back from a 4-1 halftime deficit.

Senior center Amy Leib Jed the second
half charge in the finale, notching three
goals and applying constant pressure on
the offensive end of the field. Senior
goalie Emily Chang, the team's other cap
tain, registered fantastic saves to keep the
game within reach.
The finals loss came on the heels of the
stunning victory over rival UC-Davis. The
Aggies, who had fell to the Cardinal earli
er in 1995, never mounted a substantial
threat in the "pretty intense game,"
according to Stephenson.
Stanford advanced to Sunday's cham
pionship rounds after disposing of four
teams Saturday. Thirty teams west of the
Mississippi, including high school squads,
were grouped into four divisions. The
Cardinal, in the top division, faced a stiff
challenge in the first game but controlled
the next three contests.
A Seattle club squad provided the
steepest hurdle but fell just short, 6-5.
Santa Barbara and Los Angeles club
teams fared no better, falling 8-2 and 7-1,
and another San Francisco squad was on
the short end of a 10-4 trouncing.

Dara Kaplan for her outstanding
effort, Stephenson, a defender,
noted the Cardinal's balanced
output as a key strength.
"Our scoring is very
widespread," Stephenson said.
"This was one of the first week
end's we've played really well
together as a team."
In the team's victory over St.
Mary's the Wednesday before the
tournament, Stephenson said the
Cardinal passing was not nearly as
crisp.
"We hadn't put it together
well," Stephenson said. "We
weren't really sure what was
wrong. But everybody played well
[this weekend]."
