While the NCAA championship dreams
of the Stanford women's gymnastics team
fell by the side of the road at the NCAA
Western Regional meet at Oregon State,
there were still a few shining lights for the
Cardinal this past weekend.
Jen 6 Elzie was one of these lights. The
senior co-captain led the squad to its high
est point total ever at such a competition.
Strong showings in the vault and balance
beam events helped Elzie to 39.025 points,
good for third individually at the meet.

This mark was not only a career bÂ«*st for
Elzie, but also a new school record for Stan
ford. Elzie's previous high of 38.975 had
been the school's top mark.
With the impressive showing in Corval
lis, Ore., the El Cerrito, Calif, native quali
fied for the NCAA Individual Champi
onships in Georgia later this month. The
top 12 performers nationwide whose
schools did not make the Team Champi
onship meet will be in attendance.

The Stanford baseball team recently
unleashed an offensive barrage against
opposing pitchers. And leading the attack
was third baseman Steve Carver. Carver,
making an impressive bid for Six-Pac Play
er of the Week, had 11 hits in 17 at-bats
over the last four days, including three
home runs and 12 RBIs.
In Saturday's 7-4 home win over UCLA,
the senior got the Cardinal off on the right
foot, lacing a RBI single in the first inning
to give Stanford an early lead. The Bruins
were only feeling the initial sting of Carv
er's venom, however.
In Sunday's 16-3 thrashing of UCLA,
Carver drilled a three-run home run in the
first to begin the romp. He soon added a
double and a triple, but then stumbled in
his quest for the cycle. Instead of going
after a single, the easiest type of base hit to
acquire, Carver foolishly hit a two-run shot
out of Sunken Diamond for his second
homer of the day. What was he thinking?

Carver continued his reign of terror on
Monday in Nevada where he belted yet
another dinger in yet another first inning
to send Stanford on its way to avenging a 7-
4 loss to the Wolf Pack earlier in the sea
son. He went 3-for-5 on the day with six
RBIs.
Over the course of the past four days,
Carver raised his batting average from an
already-respectable .283 to an impressive
.328 and increased his team-leading totals
to seven home runs and 43 RBIs on the
year.
