# McEnroe's spirit, or just good tennis?

Enough talk about the base
ball team. Stanford still has
one preseason No. 1 team
that has retained that ranking
until this late stage of the year.

That team plays at Stanford Ten
nis Stadium, across the way from
the Sunken Diamond.
They are Dick Gould and John
Whitlinger's men, whose 18-0
record in dual matches this sea
son should awaken you from the
slumber of your spring-break
hangover-from-hell. To give you
an idea of how impressive this
season has been, hearken back to
1978 â€” the Cardinal's only other
undefeated season. That was the
year that the greatest hands to
ever come to the Farm used his
NCAA opponents for fodder.
Yes, I am talking about John
McEnroe. Besides the fact that

McEnroe's sheer greatness is
derived from his Queens, N.Y.
upbringing, he is also remem
bered for his antics. When people
were asking what was wrong with
tennis last year (people seem pret
ty happy with it this year), most
people pointed to the deep and
abysmal void left by Johnny
Mac's departure from the tennis
scene.
I argue that the McEnroe has
been reincarnated in the 1995
Stanford men's tennis team. No, I
am not saying that the Cardinal's
No. 1 player, lefty Jeff Salzen
stein, will go on to win more
Grand Slam titles than you can
count on two hands.
Neither am I saying that No. 6
singles player Ricky Becker's
incessant muttering can ever
match the wonderful crap that
came out of McEnroe's mouth.
I'm sure Becker could come close
in style points, but he is limited
by the NCAA's harsh speech code.
Nor am I saying that No. 2 per
former Scott Humphries will ever
be able to question a line call in
quite the way McEnroe did.
Humphries is not afraid to stick
up for himself when he thinks
he's been cheated, but I've never
