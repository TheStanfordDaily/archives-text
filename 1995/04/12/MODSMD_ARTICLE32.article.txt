# McEnroe's spirit, or just good tennis?
## 
### 
Enough talk about the base
ball team. Stanford still has
one preseason No. 1 team
that has retained that ranking
until this late stage of the year.

That team plays at Stanford Ten
nis Stadium, across the way from
the Sunken Diamond.
They are Dick Gould and John
Whitlinger's men, whose 18-0
record in dual matches this sea
son should awaken you from the
slumber of your spring-break
hangover-from-hell. To give you
an idea of how impressive this
season has been, hearken back to
1978 — the Cardinal's only other
undefeated season. That was the
year that the greatest hands to
ever come to the Farm used his
NCAA opponents for fodder.
Yes, I am talking about John
McEnroe. Besides the fact that

McEnroe's sheer greatness is
derived from his Queens, N.Y.
upbringing, he is also remem
bered for his antics. When people
were asking what was wrong with
tennis last year (people seem pret
ty happy with it this year), most
people pointed to the deep and
abysmal void left by Johnny
Mac's departure from the tennis
scene.
I argue that the McEnroe has
been reincarnated in the 1995
Stanford men's tennis team. No, I
am not saying that the Cardinal's
No. 1 player, lefty Jeff Salzen
stein, will go on to win more
Grand Slam titles than you can
count on two hands.
Neither am I saying that No. 6
singles player Ricky Becker's
incessant muttering can ever
match the wonderful crap that
came out of McEnroe's mouth.
I'm sure Becker could come close
in style points, but he is limited
by the NCAA's harsh speech code.
Nor am I saying that No. 2 per
former Scott Humphries will ever
be able to question a line call in
quite the way McEnroe did.
Humphries is not afraid to stick
up for himself when he thinks
he's been cheated, but I've never


The Real
Deal

Joe
Bialowitz
11card him tongue-lash an umpire
with a rhetorical "You can't be
serious!"
What I am saying is that this
team possesses the ability to work
magic wherever they go. The Car
dinal is as well-balanced as a jewel
er's scale. All the stars are in line
lor a national championship sea
son.

They are coached by Gould, the
John Wooden of tennis. Gould has
won 12 NCAA team titles in his 28
years at the helm of the Cardinal.
They possess a clutch player,
junior Jim Thomas, who is begin
ning to become known as "The
Iceman." Big Jim is starting to
make a habit of clinching matches
with third-set tiebreaks that
would drive any recovering alco
holic back to the sauce.
They possess a PTPer (Prime
Time Player) in Grant Elliott at
the No. 5 singles position. The

sophomore sports an 18-1 record
whose only blemish was due to a
default.
They possess a court jester,
Paul Goldstein, who does eye
catching tricks with racquet and
ball. I cannot describe these tricks
further; you have to go see them
to understand.
And they play in Stanford Ten
nis Stadium, the Camden Yards of
college tennis. Arrillaga Sports
Pavilion provides the warehouse
like backdrop for spectators seat
ed at stadium court.

So why waste your sunburn at
Sunken Diamond? You might as
well come out to watch the men's
tennis team on their road to
Athens, Ga. for the NCAA cham
pionships.
Not only can you get a great tan
at Stanford Tennis Stadium, you
too can become part of the McEn
roe mystique. Go ahead and shout
some disses at the Cardinal's
opponents. The acoustics of the
stadium courts are well-suited to a
catcall of "I could catch a whale
with that hook!" when the road

team dares to "hook" (or "cheat,"
for you non-tennis fans not down
with the lingo) the nation's top
ranked team. And for more per
sonalized heckling, head to Beck
er's Bleachers adjacent to Court 7.
You can get deep into the kitchen
of Becker's opponents, and Becker
has assured me that he never
minds a vociferous sixth man or
two seated in his bleachers.

Joe often walked past the McEnroe
home as a kid, but never mustered
the nerve to ring the doorbell.
