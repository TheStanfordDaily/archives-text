## 
### Burt Herman Gabriela Teodorescu Contributing writers 
Four Stanford students and one
alumnus have been charged with
felonies after they allegedly broke
in to the Stanford Art Museum
March 25.
Santa Clara County Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Lance Bayer has
leved second-degree burglary
charges against seniors Jacob Ku
ramoto and Matthew Bengard,
sophomores Timothy Kutzkey and
Alejandor Quezeda and 1994 grad

uate Jose Farias.
Second-degree burglary involves
commercial buildings, as opposed to
first-degree burglary in which a res
idence is involved.
Bengard and Kutzkey would not
comment on the charges. The other
three men did not return The
Daily's phone calls.
The five were arrested when po
lice received a call about an alarm
being tripped in the museum.
Farias and Bengard were found
lying in the grass near the museum
by a police dog. The other three
were found later in the area.

According to Stanford Police
Sgt. John McMullen, the men were
charged with a felony after "the
Deputy DA went out and looked at
the scene and the value of art.
"The [suspects] were right out
side the painting storage area
where all the most valuable paint
ings are kept," McMullen said.
Bayer said the maximum possi
ble sentence for each if convicted on
the burglary charge is three years in
a state prison. "It would also be in
the judge's discretion to place them
on probation for as long as five
years," he added.

McMullen, however, said he "se
riously doubted" the alleged bur
glars would serve time in jail.
Kuramoto has also been charged
with two misdemeanors: posses
sion of burglary tools and bringing a
weapon onto school grounds.
Kuramoto was carrying a back
pack containing the following tools
at the time of his arrest: one hicko
ry-handled ax, two pairs of pliers,
two Phillips screwdrivers, one stan
dard screwdriver, one hand-held
flashlight, one hand-held saw, one
hacksaw, an Allen wrench set and a
six-inch crescent wrench. The bag
also contained pens and pencils in
the front zipper pouch.
Kuramoto was also carrying a
"Fury" brand knife with a lockable
blade that measured 3.5 inches —
one inch longer than the permissi
ble length.
During the police interrogation
after the incident, Kuramoto said
he "had the tools with him in case
they needed to get into some place
that was closed," the report stated.
He also told police that he carried
the knife "for protection."
"Obviously we weren't supposed
to be there," Kuramoto said to
police according to the report. "We
weren't there to steal anything."
In his statement to police,
Kuramoto also admitted to entering
other closed buildings on campus,
including Green Library and the
English department. He denied ever
having entered Building 10, where
the president's office is located.
Kutzkey told police that the
alleged burglars entered the muse
um because they decided it would be
"sweet" to get on top of the roof.
However, Kuramoto told police that
"he wanted to go inside the muse
um and look around," the report
stated.
Kuramoto said he thought it
would be "neat to wander around
the closed buildings and look at
things," according to the report.
According to Quezada's state
ment, he and the other alleged bur
glars "decided to do something
'crazy' since finals were over." They

"decided they were going to climb
on top of a high building," Quezeda
told police, adding that he did not
think the building was protected by
an alarm.
Farias told police that he
"thought the whole incident was
funny, like being in college again,"
the report stated.
Edward Mahler, Kuramoto's
lawyer, said the students had no
intention of stealing any art objects.
"Obviously this was not their
highest intellectual hour," Mahler
said. "One of them, if in fact this
was a concocted story, would have
cracked — these kids aren't tough.
"The young men do have to pay a
price and that's fair," Mahler said.
"The question is, what is the price?"
Even though the alleged bur
glars may not have wanted to steal a
painting for profit, McMullen said,
stolen items from around campus
have often been found in fraterni
ties. The four students are mem
bers of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity,
and Farias is a former member.
"In my years here we've seen
some interesting things in frats —
people go out and collect things,"
McMullen said. "[A painting] would
make a nice little thing to put up in
someone's room or inside the lobby
of a fraternity."
None of the five men were
charged with conspiracy or delaying
a police officer — charges for which
police originally booked the alleged
burglars.
At the scene of the crime, police
found blood on the latch of the win
dow and the window exterior, as
well as on a roll of toilet paper locat
ed in the bathroom of the museum,
the report stated.
Bengard was found later with
blood on a yellow rain jacket he was

wearing, according to the report,
and claimed that he had cut himself
with a knife earlier at the Beta
house.
Kuramoto told police that Ben
gard pulled the grate from the win
dow, but later admitted to also
being involved, the report stated.
Kutzkey also said to police that he
had been involved with pushing in
the window.
All five suspects were wearing
dark jeans and dark, plaid, button
down shirts. All of the suspects
except Farias were wearing dark
baseball caps. The rear of Bengard's
cap read "Everything Sucks."
Farias was the only man not to
be released on his own recog
nizance, meaning he did not sign a
release promising to return for the
arraignment or the trial. Police
have requested a warrant for
Farias' arrest.
All five will be arraigned on April
13.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
said that the filing of the charges
will have no effect on University
measures against the four students.
"But, now the University is free to
begin to look into the break-in with
out hampering the police investiga
tion," she said.
Cole said she will be meeting
with the individual students. If mis
conduct is found, the students can
accept the charges and have a hear
ing with someone in the Dean of
Students Office. If they deny the
charges, there is a more elaborate
fact-finding process, she said.
"I'm surprised that Stanford
students living in the late 20th Cen
tury think that this is a prank,"
Museum Director Thomas Selig
man said. "They've been living in an
isolation chamber."

stolen items from around campus
have often been found in fraterni
ties. The four students are mem
bers of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity,
and Farias is a former member.
"In my years here we've seen
some interesting things in frats —
people go out and collect things,"
McMullen said. "[A painting] would
make a nice little thing to put up in
someone's room or inside the lobby
of a fraternity."
None of the five men were
charged with conspiracy or delaying
a police officer — charges for which
police originally booked the alleged
burglars.
At the scene of the crime, police
found blood on the latch of the win
dow and the window exterior, as
well as on a roll of toilet paper locat
ed in the bathroom of the museum,
the report stated.
Bengard was found later with
blood on a yellow rain jacket he was

wearing, according to the report,
and claimed that he had cut himself
with a knife earlier at the Beta
house.
Kuramoto told police that Ben
gard pulled the grate from the win
dow, but later admitted to also
being involved, the report stated.
Kutzkey also said to police that he
had been involved with pushing in
the window.
All five suspects were wearing
dark jeans and dark, plaid, button
down shirts. All of the suspects
except Farias were wearing dark
baseball caps. The rear of Bengard's
cap read "Everything Sucks."
Farias was the only man not to
be released on his own recog
nizance, meaning he did not sign a
release promising to return for the
arraignment or the trial. Police
have requested a warrant for
Farias' arrest.
All five will be arraigned on April
13.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
said that the filing of the charges
will have no effect on University
measures against the four students.
"But, now the University is free to
begin to look into the break-in with
out hampering the police investiga
tion," she said.
Cole said she will be meeting
with the individual students. If mis
conduct is found, the students can
accept the charges and have a hear
ing with someone in the Dean of
Students Office. If they deny the
charges, there is a more elaborate
fact-finding process, she said.
"I'm surprised that Stanford
students living in the late 20th Cen
tury think that this is a prank,"
Museum Director Thomas Selig
man said. "They've been living in an
isolation chamber."
