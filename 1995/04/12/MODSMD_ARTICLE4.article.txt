Four Stanford students and one
alumnus have been charged with
felonies after they allegedly broke
in to the Stanford Art Museum
March 25.
Santa Clara County Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Lance Bayer has
leved second-degree burglary
charges against seniors Jacob Ku
ramoto and Matthew Bengard,
sophomores Timothy Kutzkey and
Alejandor Quezeda and 1994 grad

commercial buildings, as opposed to
first-degree burglary in which a res

Bengard and Kutzkey would not
comment on the charges. The other
three men did not return The

the burglary charge is three years in
a state prison. "It would also be in
the judge's discretion to place them
on probation for as long as five
years," he added.

McMullen, however, said he "se
riously doubted" the alleged bur
glars would serve time in jail.
Kuramoto has also been charged
with two misdemeanors: posses
sion of burglary tools and bringing a
weapon onto school grounds.
Kuramoto was carrying a back
pack containing the following tools
at the time of his arrest: one hicko

two Phillips screwdrivers, one stan

flashlight, one hand-held saw, one
