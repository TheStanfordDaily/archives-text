# RA applicant pool down 50 from last year
## 
### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
The number of students applying to be resi
dent assistants for next year has fallen by 50, a
substantial drop from applicant pools over the
last few years.
By last Friday, the due date for all RA appli
cations, only 269 students had applied — com
pared to 319 last year and 320 the year before.
But according to Susan Cass, program assis
tant for the Office of Residential Education,
the drop is not part of a trend. She said the
number of applicants has hovered between 320
and 350 for the past four years.
"There are a lot of new leadership positions
available on campus that people are trying for"
which may steer some away from pursuing an
RA position, Cass said, citing the new peer
health education program in the Cowell Stu
dent Health Center as an example.
Res Ed will soon be looking further into

other reasons for the drop in applicants, she
added.
Cass maintained that there is no need for
worry, since there are only 165 RA positions

I'm not necessarily concerned
about the drop because those
RAs who have applied are ap
plying for the right reasons.'

available for next year. "Over 100 people will
still need to be turned away," she said, and the
field includes "plenty of good applicants and
good diversity."
Some current RAs, who will help choose
their replacements, seemed unworried by the

drop in applicants.
"I'm not concerned about it because from
what I've seen so far the candidates are quali
fied," said Faisan RA Adam Fingerhut. "If Res
Ed continues how it has this year, there is no
problem."
"I'm not necessarily concerned about the
drop because those RAs who have applied are
applying for the right reasons," said Cardenal
RA Matthew Francis. "They want to give back
to the community. The numbers are not con
cerning me."
Even though totals have fallen, RA applica
tions for Branner Hall have remained constant
from last year, according to Branner Resident
Fellow Kennell Jackson.
As to the drop as a whole, he said, "I don't
have any concerns about it. We get a sufficient
number of applicants to cover our purpose."
Applicants for RA positions will be notified
on May 10 about whether they have been cho
sen.
