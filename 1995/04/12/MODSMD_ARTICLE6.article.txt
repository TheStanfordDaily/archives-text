# 'To help the rest of us understand what's going on in the world'
## Haas celebrates public service 
### Kyung Lee Contributing writer 
After 10 years as a pioneer of community service
among college students, Stanford is celebrating.
To commemorate its 10th anniversary, the Haas
Center for Public Service is bringing speakers and
special events to the Farm today to discuss the im
portance of public service.
On Wednesday afternoon in Kresge Auditorium,
Haas will sponsor a symposium entitled "Education
for a Responsible Society," dealing with the connec
tion between public service and academic mission.
The symposium will feature a panel of Stanford
alumni and faculty led by former University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, said Tim Stanton, director of
the center.
The keynote speaker, Thomas Ehrlich, former
dean of the Law School and former president of In
diana University, will address service learning and
educational reform.
In addition, Drama Prof. Anna Deveare Smith,
an award-winning playwright who has addressed
various contemporary issues in her plays — such as
the conflict between blacks and Orthodox Jews and
the Rodney King incident — will "dramatically ex-


Peter Laguerquist — Daily
plore her characters" in her pre
sentation for the Haas Center,
Stanton said.
"The purpose is to help the rest
of us understand what's going on
in the world and to understand
individually and collectively what
the pressures are," he added.
Stanton said the symposium is
an important "cerebral examina
tion of the place of public service
and 'An Evening with Anna Dea
vere Smith' will get to the heart of
the matter, to the issues that vol
unteers respond to."

In 1984, Katherine Milton, then
Kennedy's special assistant, helped
found the center after a year of
leading an effort to obtain Univer
sity support.
"The main rationale behind
founding the center was to get
strength and visibility for commu
nity service," Stanton said. "There
was service going on, but it wasn't
very apparent."
Ten years later, the center pro
vides a place for community-ser
vice meetings, computers and a
storehouse of information for
prospective volunteers.
Stanton added that the center
allows faculty and students to meet
in order to connect research inter
ests with local community needs.

Sophomore Kesha Weekes, stu
dent director of the East Palo Alto
Stanford Summer Academy, said
the center, besides providing a
place for the academy's meetings,
distinguishes itself with a genuine
ly interested and supportive staff.
"Even though they have their
particular jobs, they do more than
is required of them," Weekes said.
"They put in hours that they don't
need to just so they can give us sup
port."
Stanton said in the years since
the University instituted the cen
ter, it has witnessed a "clear and
gratifying response from the stu
dents to be engaged in community
service."
"Student culture around com

munity service has changed," he
said. "Not only have the numbers
increased, but there's also much
more feeling out there that one
ought to get involved."
To honor those students who
have dedicated themselves to com
munity service, visiting mentors
this spring will select three gradu
ating seniors to join the annual
John Gardner Fellowship pro
gram, Stanton added.
"These students will join a post
graduate fellowship program with
mentors who support public sup
port," he explained.
Past mentors have been high
profile figures like Henry Cis
neros, secretary of Housing and
Urban Development, Stanton said.
