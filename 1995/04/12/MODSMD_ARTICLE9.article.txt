# 6 honored with Deans' Awards
## Ceremony praises academic achievement, research 
### Marie Rosencrantz 
Honored for work ranging from environmental
engineering research to organizing an archeology
course, six undergraduates yesterday received the
Deans' Award for Academic Achievement at a recep
tion in the Mitchell Earth Sciences Building.
Four of this year's awards recognized research in
highly technical fields, such as electrical engineering
and physics, while two honored anthropological field
work in Peru and the creation of a national philo
sophical journal for undergraduates.
The award, which has been given for eight years,
honors undergraduates for academic achievements
from all majors. Students are nominated for the
award by faculty and staff who they have worked with
in academic or research areas.
During the ceremony, the professors who nomi
nated the four seniors, one junior and one coterminal
student described the research or project that each
recipient had done.
Keith Toh, a senior in electrical engineering, was rec
ognized for his research on optical fibers which has been
published in four different opto-electronic journals.
Together with a group of faculty and graduate stu
dents, Toh has used a unique optical monitoring sys
tem to conduct molecular beam research.
Coterminal student Timothy Carrothers received
his award for work in the field of civil engineering.
Carrothers has done extensive interdisciplinary
research in environmental engineering and completed
an honors thesis for the Institute for International
Studies on organic chemical regulations.
"I wanted to branch out beyond chemical engi
neering," Carrothers said.
Jinoos Yazdany, a senior in human biology, was
honored for her research on the benefits of exercise
for elderly health care. She has prepared herself for
her upcoming medical school studies through service
at the Haas Center for Public Service, the Richstone
Center for child abuse prevention and the East Palo

Alto Free Clinics.
Another science nwyor, senior Fred Mancofi",
received an award for his extensive research on two
dimensional electron transport in a disordered mag
netic medium.
As the top senior student within the physics
department with a grade-point average above 4.0,
Mancoff has already given a talk at an international
conference attended by over 5,000 physicists.
The other two students awarded were recognized
for their work in the humanities.
The award recognized senior Dale Yeatts' efforts to
plan and organize a class in archeology last quarter.
Yeatts, an anthropology major, invited archeological
scholars from all over California to speak about their
research experiences in Egypt, Peru and Central
America.
"There are so many people with experience. It is
only a question of getting them all together," Yeatts
said. He lias also conducted independent anthropolog
ical research in southern Peru for his honors thesis.
Shua Knobe was modest about his achievements,
claiming that "I actually don't know exactly why I got
this award."
The only junior among the recipients, Knobe last
year organized and contributed to the national jour
nal "The Dualist," which features undergraduate
work in philosophy.
Knobe, who individually designed a major incorpo
rating ethics, religious studies and philosophy, also
wrote "A Self-Guided Book to the Foothills," which
was published last year.
The fact that the majority of award recipients this
year are science majors is merely a coincidence, accord
ing to Ram6n Saldi'var, vice provost and associate dean
of undergraduate studies. "The award recognizes con
tribution of knowledge, not only accumulation of
knowledge," Saldivar said.
Each student received a copy of the citation read at
the ceremony and a specially chosen book with a per
sonalized book plate.
