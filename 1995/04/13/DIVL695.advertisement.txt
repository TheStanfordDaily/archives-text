Some Achieve By Leaps and Bounds.
WE ACHIEVE BY LEAPING BOUNDARIES.
At Cisco Systems, making respectable
progress isn't good enough. We always go
beyond the expected, always in the direc
tion of wide open possibilities. That's how
we've managed to leap so many boundaries
in the development of hardware, software,
and customized internetworking products.
Very soon, virtually every industry will rely
upon internetworking. That means they will
rely upon Cisco.
What does it take to perform at this
level? People who are irrefutably the best at
what they do. Technologists and strategists
of the highest order. And what happens
when so much talent comes together in one
company? A lot of milestones.
This fiscal year alone, we achieved the
first ATM switch to integrate the ATM
Forum's ATM routing standard, the first
full-speed 155-Mbps ATM router interface,
and the company's first LAN switch. Not bad
for a year's work, but there's more.
In the span of one year, our sales
jumped from $649 million to over $1
billion. Fiscal 1994 also brought about the
acquisition of Crescendo Communications,
our firsr equity position with Cascade
Communications — and over twenty other
partnerships with such technology leaders
as Alcatel and IBM. We closed the year with
a joint venture between Cisco and 13 lead
ing Japanese companies — and opened fis
cal 1995 with the acquisition of Newport
Systems, Kalpana and LighlStream.
A "company" didn't do all this —
people did. This is an exciting, progressive,
and highly successful environment to do
what you do best. Come join those like you
who see a challenge as something to aim
for — then surpass.
