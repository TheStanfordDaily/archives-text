# No housed sororities this fall
## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
After five days of sharingsmiles,
songs and conversation, this year's
Sorority Rush ended last night,
concluding an event that differred
in several respects from previous
years.
Among the major issues affect
ing the atmosphere and outcome
of Rush are the pending possibility
of sorority housing, the positive ef
fects of the event's relocation and
the elimination of "cross-cutting"
— a process by which certain
women have been denied final
bids.
According to Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Heather Dunn, on
campus sorority housing "will
not occur next fall," although
discussions between Vice
Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds — who
will ultimately make the decision
— and various housing offices
are moving ahead in hopes of
opening opportunities for un
housed Greek organizations, and
sororities in particular.
Thus far, Kappa Kappa Gamma
is the only sorority that has sub
mitted a proposal for on-campus
housing.
In order to progress toward ef
fecting concrete changes in hous
ing opportunities for sororities,
officials must revise Stanford's
1977 "grandfather clause," Dunn
said.
According to the clause, 12 fra
ternal organizations have priority
for on-campus housing. One plau
sible angle of revision would be to
extend the opportunity of being
considered for housing to Greek or
ganizations currently not present
in the clause's list.
Among other considerations
featured in current discussions
are various requirements the
administration feels that frater
nities and sororities should meet
in order to receive housing,
including financial stability, close
alumni relations, good standing
with the University and an
enthusiastic level of contribu
tions back to the Stanford com
munity.
"We're really committed to
positive change for the future,"
Dunn said.

While high in the minds of
housing authorities, Intersorori
ty Council Co-Rush Chairs Cor
nelia Ercklentz and Britt Wahlin
remarked that "housing was not
an issue in Rush this year."
Regardless of the housing
issue's uncertain status, 250
rushees turned out for the first
day of the event — a number
comparable to those in years
past.
Over the course of the week,
the number of Rush participants
decreased to 141, all of whom
were offered bids as a result of
the elimination of the "cross-cut
ting" process — when women
who choose their top two choices

could end up being cut from both.
This year, every woman who
rushed the entire week and indi
cated her two top choices was
granted a final bid.
Responding to what she feels
to be a common misconception of
exclusivity, Wahlin said that the
ISC "wants the system to reward
all women who go through the
entire Rush process."
Both Ercklentz and Wahlin
attribute much of the week's suc
cess to the more friendly and
inclusive nature of this year's
decision process.
The relocation of Rush head
quarters from Wilbur Field to
Escondido Elementary School

was another change adding to the
popularity and effectiveness of
this year's Rush, Ercklentz and
Wahlin added. In addition to cre
ating a more pleasant atmo
sphere for rushees, the new site
reduced total costs by approxi
mately two-thirds.
Overall, everyone involved in
Rush was pleased with the
changes incurred by relocation —
Escondido Elementary itself, in
particular. All costs of the week's
programs go directly back to the
elementary school, Ercklentz and
Wahlin said, adding that they
were "very excited" about
putting money back into the local
community.
