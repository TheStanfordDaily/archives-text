# No housed sororities this fall

### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
After five days of sharingsmiles,
songs and conversation, this year's
Sorority Rush ended last night,
concluding an event that differred
in several respects from previous
years.
Among the major issues affect
ing the atmosphere and outcome
of Rush are the pending possibility
of sorority housing, the positive ef
fects of the event's relocation and
the elimination of "cross-cutting"
— a process by which certain
women have been denied final
bids.
According to Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Heather Dunn, on
campus sorority housing "will
not occur next fall," although
discussions between Vice
Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds — who
will ultimately make the decision
— and various housing offices
are moving ahead in hopes of
opening opportunities for un
housed Greek organizations, and
sororities in particular.
Thus far, Kappa Kappa Gamma
is the only sorority that has sub
mitted a proposal for on-campus
housing.
In order to progress toward ef
fecting concrete changes in hous
ing opportunities for sororities,
officials must revise Stanford's
1977 "grandfather clause," Dunn
said.
According to the clause, 12 fra
ternal organizations have priority
for on-campus housing. One plau
sible angle of revision would be to
extend the opportunity of being
considered for housing to Greek or
ganizations currently not present
in the clause's list.
