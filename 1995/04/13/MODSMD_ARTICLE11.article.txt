# Iacocca's Chrysler takeover bid fails
## 
### 
DETROIT (AP) — In a move that stunned
the business world, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian
and former Chrysler chairman Lee lacocca
made a $22.8 billion bid to buy the nation's
No. 3 automaker yesterday. Hours later, the
company said it wasn't for sale.
"We don't want to put Chrysler at risk,"
Chairman Robert J. Eaton said in a statement
after the directors met to consider an unso
licited proposal of $55 a share from lacocca
and Kerkorian, the company's largest share
holder.
"We've worked hard to build this company's
financial strength, to increase shareholder
value and to build the confidence of customers.
We have no desire to reverse the process."
The stock offer — 40 percent above
Chrysler's Tuesday closing stock price — is the
biggest and most daring takeover gambit to
come along since the 1980s heyday of hostile
corporate raiding.
Alex Yemenidjian, an executive at Kerkori
an's Tracinda Corp. in Las Vegas, rejected the
idea that the offer was hostile.
"It certainly is not hostile to the sharehold

ers, who own the company and who are going
to make a bundle of money," Yemenidjian uaid
in a telephone news conference.
Chrysler finished 1994 with a record $3.7
billion profit and a cash surplus of $7.5 billion
its managers say they need to weather the
industry's next downturn.
Kerkorian contends that cushion is too big
and the company's stock is priced too low. He
pushed Chrysler's board in December to
increase the stock dividend and buy back
shares to push up the price.
Under the proposal, Kerkorian would put
up $2 billion of his own money. He already
owns 10 percent of Chrysler.
About $50 million would come from lacoc
ca, who retired as chairman in 1992 after
becoming a corporate icon by bringing
Chrysler back from bankruptcy's brink. Other
investors, still to be recruited, would add $3
billion more.
An additional $5.5 billion would come from
Chrysler's cash surplus and the rest from bank
loans and bonds, Yemenidjian said.
In rejecting the offer, Chrysler noted that

no financing had been lined up and the deal
would deplete the company's cash reservoir by
more than 70 percent.
"I want to make absolutely clear that
Chrysler management is in no way involved
with Tracinda's proposal," Eaton said. "I told
Mr. Kerkorian that last night when he
informed me by telephone of his intention to
make an announcement."
Meanwhile, 28 lawsuits were filed in
Delaware, where the corporation is registered,
seeking to block Chrysler from accepting the
buyout offer. The suits were by shareholders
who claimed the company would be breaching
its financial responsibility unless it got a price
higher than the $55 a share offered by Kerko
rian.
The proposal sent Chrysler shares shooting
up in heavy New York Stock Exchange trad
ing, though they ended only $9.50 higher at
$48.75, well below the takeover price.
That reflected plenty of skepticism about
whether such an audacious attempt could suc
ceed and what the prospective buyers plan for
the company.
