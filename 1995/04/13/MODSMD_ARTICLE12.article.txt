GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) - PLO chief Yass
er Arafat widened his crackdown on Islamic mili
tants yesterday by issuing an ultimatum: register
your guns by May 11 or Palestinian police will take
them by force.
Palestinian critics warned that Arafat's strong
arm tactics were a sign the Palestinians were on
the road to military rule.
The Hamas group reacted with defiance, saying
its fighters would not give up their weapons as long
as Israeli forces remained in the Gaza Strip.
The challenge increased fears of civil war
between Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants and
the PLO, which has ruled Gaza and the West Bank
city of Jericho for 11 months.
A spokesman for the militant group Hamas said
its fighters would not surrender arms as long as
Israeli soldiers remained in Gaza, guarding the
Jewish settlements that are home to 5,000 Israelis.
"While the Israelis are still here and killing the

people, it is nonsense to ask the people to give up
their weapons with which they protect them
selves," said Mahmoud Zahar, a senior political fig
ure in Hamas. "We will never give up our
weapons."
Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath
vowed that the campaign would be carried out to
the end.
"Until Hamas, Jihad and everybody commit
themselves to respect the agreement (with Israel),
we have to take the measures necessary to protect
the national interest," he said. "We have to get our
house in order."
Arafat also sent a message asking Jordan to
crack down on Hamas.
Arafat's advisors drew up recommendations on
how to stop Hamas by cutting off the flow of money
through charity organizations and financial insti
tutions run by the movement, Israel Television
reported.
