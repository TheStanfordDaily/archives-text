Sweet 'N Low offered bribes
NEW YORK (AP) - Top officials of the com
pany that makes Sweet 'N Low pleaded guilty
yesterday to funneling more than $200,000 in
illegal contributions to political campaigns to try
to head off a ban on saccharin, the sugar substi
tute's key ingredient.
Among the recipients of the illegal largess
were the presidential campaigns of Bob Dole in
1988 and George Bush in 1992, as well as cam
paigns by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., former
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and former Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro, D-N.Y., who ran for vice
president in 1984.
There was no evidence that the lawmakers or
anyone on their campaign staffs were aware the
contributions were illegal, prosecutors said.

Top officials and contractors of Cumberland
Packing Co., a Brooklyn-based business that
makes Sweet 'N Low, pleaded guilty in federal
court to conspiracy, tax evasion, obstruction of
justice and false-statement charges.
They admitted siphoning off about $2.9 mil
lion from Cumberland from 1985 to 1994
through a false invoicing scheme.
According to prosecutors, more than
$224,000 of the money went to political candi
dates in a position to stave off a ban on saccha
rin. The Food and Drug Administration pro
posed banning the sweetener as a possible car
cinogen in 1977, but Congress has repeatedly
blocked a ban.
Other money went to improvements on the
homes of company officials and friends, and for
other personal uses, prosecutors said.
