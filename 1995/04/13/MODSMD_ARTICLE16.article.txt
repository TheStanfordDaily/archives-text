## 'Public' television? 
### 
AFTER A survey and experi
mental installation in Flo
rence Moore Hall, real
cable service will be available to
students living in most dorms by
fall quarter.
Well, sort of.
Students living in most of the
major undergraduate dorms —
Branner, Flo Mo, Kimball, Lagu
nita, Roble, Stern and Wilbur —
will have the option to subscribe
next year to in-room cable ser
vice. The price will be $20 for the
basic package; premium channels
like HBO will cost extra.
Communications Services
should be thanked for (finally)
providing a service that the
entire Stanford community —
especially oft-neglected graduate
students — has wanted for a long
time.
However, there is a major
problem. The University's agree
ment with the service provider
does not allow cable subscrip
tions in "public rooms" — name

ly, dorm lounges.
This seems to run counter to
the general ideals of Stanford's
Residential Education program,
whose mission is, at least in part,
to foster community spirit
through dorm activities. Though
certainly not destructive, encour
aging students to retreat to their
rooms to watch ESPN's "Sports-
Center" or MTV's "Beavis and
Butt-head" isn't going to help.
And who's to say that a dorm
room isn't "public," anyway. A
resident of Flo Mo put it this
way: "You really only need one or
two TVs with cable per floor and
then everyone can come in and
watch."
Most Stanford students would
quickly concede that, however
unintellectual it may seem, bond
ing around favorite television
shows is common in dorms.
By keeping cable out of dorm
lounges, Stanford may be making
its student housing less friendly
places.
