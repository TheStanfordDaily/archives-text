# Students and power
## 
### 
PROVOST Condoleezza Rice
recently announced that she
supported putting students
on two key committees. If this
actually happens, it would be a
welcome trend.
At last week's ASSU Senate
meeting Rice said she favored plac
ing a student on the Stanford
Bookstore's board of directors and
one on the secdrch committee in
charge of hiring a new dean of stu
dents to replace outgoing dean
Michael Jackson.
Both of these moves make
sense. A dean of students is some
one who students should be able to
relate to and look to for leadership;
it is important that students have
some say in the selection process.
It is also fair to say that stu
dents are the Bookstore's most
important client and therefore
have a vested interest in keeping
the costs of books and academic
supplies low. Although the power

of such a student member might
be limited, it would be a welcome
symbolic move considering the
Bookstore's poor reputation of
recent years.
Speaking of committees, let's
get another student on the com
mittee that oversees all commit
tees (including the Committee on
Committees) — the Board of
Trustees. Currently, the Board has
33 members plus only one student,
who is nominated each year by the
ASSU.
Over a hundred years ago,
Leland and Jane Stanford willed
this university to the students.
They did not bequeath it to the
administrators and tell them they
could kick around the students
however they saw fit. So let's claim
the power that is rightfully ours —
representation on the committees
and boards that govern Stanford
behind the scenes.
It looks good on r6sum6s, too.
