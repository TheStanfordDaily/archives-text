## Families and holidays 
### 
ABOUT THIS time of year, the kids
sitting near me at that cold formica
cafeteria table in elementary school
thought my lunch was the weirdest thing
ever. I'd tentatively peer into the gaping
mouth of my plain brown bag knowing that
the sandwich of sideways glances was
somewhere inside. After a brief reprieve by
the string cheese, I took it out.
The tuna fish on matzah.
I did the spokesperson for the minority
group thing with my canned bit about the
Israelites in the desert and the dough not
having time to rise when the scrunched up
faces of "What is that?" glanced over. And
I'd either feel really cool or really dumb.
Sometimes the difference between being
unique and being strange is just percep
tion.
But Passover wasn't and isn't about the
mushy matzah sandwich to me. Or the
impromptu explanations. It was more
about making the sandwich with my dad.
And the fighting about who's having the
seder at their house. Ah, family.
Religious holidays are the thing this
weekend, and people are heading home. If
you're not going home, you want to go or
you're scurrying to find someplace to be. Of
course, you may prefer being dragged
across the freeway by the tongue than sit
through a family dinner.
For me, this Friday night isn't going to
be about religion itself. Religion can get
frighteningly ugly when it becomes
wrapped up in the politics of hate like this

week's senseless suicide bombing in Israel.
I don't think these holy days are about spir
itual intangibles alone. If that makes me a
blasphemer, oh well. Sure, for some people,
prayer is the thrust of it. I'm more into eat
ing. Still, within the ancient religious con
text, there are other things, monumental
things, going on.
Things that make a family a family.
It's about the comforting predictability
that every year, there is the seder with the
relatives once again. Sometime after the
opening the door for Elijah, there's a sense
of purpose and connection. Of belonging
and tradition.
Amidst the tension of who is sitting
where, of course.
It's the stuff of continuity, a sense of
sureness where you can take that deep
breath because for a moment, it seems that
everything is OK Even with the annoying
great aunt who needs that kiss hello dan
gerously near her major chin hairs.
And this weekend, that sense of stability
comes in the form of religion. Works for
some, but for others, memories and togeth
erness come from another place. Just
someone who watched college football with
you or listened to you clank away at the
piano until you actually got good. Same
idea as religious gatherings. The feeling
that someone out there cares about you.
Cares enough to give your often amor
phous life a bit of shape. A shared event
where you were watched and wanted, and
missed if you were gone.

So whether that's in the realm of reli
gion or the framework of football, I don't
think it matters. But we all need a sense of
purpose, support and connection.
I wasn't going to do the Passover event
with the family this year because the tug of
all the stuff to do was too overwhelming.
Then the mighty matriarch spoke. For a
brief moment I felt like a Kennedy. The
pull of the Family. But then my grand
mother's New York twang kicked in and it
was more like Fiddler on the Roof. Tradi
tion. She fiddled.
"How could you not come? I'm making a
whole big to do. You should see the matzah
balls!"
"Well grandma, I really want to, but the
quarter is just starting, and...
"Please, the Imp rotas are coming over!
How long has it been since you've seen
them?"
"Well, I'll see them when I see them."
"And God forbid I'm not here next year,
then this would be the last seder...."
That was it. I put her on hold, called
Southwest and booked the flight. I'm going
to her Seder, even though there won't be
any tuna fish on matzah. And even if it
means I'll be planting a juicy one on the
chin hair aunt.

Julie wonders where Time cover girl Clau
dia Schiffer is going for Passover.
