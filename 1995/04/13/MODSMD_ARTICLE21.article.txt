## Even without lights, baseball must shine over USC Trojans, ESPN on hand but night games on hold 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
Contrary to original plans,
there will be no aura of light ema
nating from Sunken Diamond
after the sun sets this evening. If
the Stanford baseball team is
going to take another step
towards securing its second
straight Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion title in this weekend's series
against USC, it will have to be
done under God's natural halo
gen.
While today's 2:30 p.m. game
might not be played under the
lights — installation has been
slower than expected — the Car
dinal (22-14 overall, 12-5 in the
Six-Pac) cannot afford to play
poorly. The Trojans (27-15, 10-8
in the Six-Pac) are red-hot, the
winners of six straight and nine of
the last 10, and are currently
ranked 10th nationally. USC's
recent streak has brought them
to within two and a half games of
the Cardinal in the Six-Pac.
"This weekend is big," said
senior third baseman Steve Carv

er, who is batting .688 with three
home runs and 12 RBIs in the last
four games. "It has the potential
to make or break some of the
teams in the Pac-10 [South]."
The series could make it for
the Cardinal, which still holds the
top spot in the conference. In the
preseason, the Trojans were
picked to pace the conference
along with Stanford, and the Car
dinal might be all that can stop a
USC team that has a soft home
stretch schedule.
"These games could put USC
in a position to compete for the
title," Carver said. "For us to hold
on, to sweep or win two out of
three, will put us in a great posi
tion to wrap things up next week
end instead of waiting until the
last week of the season."
Stanford is certainly in a posi
tion to step up to the plate. The
Cardinal is in the midst of a win
ning spurt of its own, posting an
8-3 record and batting .335 since
the team took 12 days off for win
ter quarter exams. Hot players off

Pac success against USC in a three-game set beginning today.
