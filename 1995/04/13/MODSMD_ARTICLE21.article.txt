## Even without lights, baseball must shine over USC Trojans, ESPN on hand but night games on hold 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
Contrary to original plans,
there will be no aura of light ema
nating from Sunken Diamond
after the sun sets this evening. If
the Stanford baseball team is
going to take another step
towards securing its second
straight Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion title in this weekend's series
against USC, it will have to be
done under God's natural halo
gen.
While today's 2:30 p.m. game
might not be played under the
lights — installation has been
slower than expected — the Car
dinal (22-14 overall, 12-5 in the
Six-Pac) cannot afford to play
poorly. The Trojans (27-15, 10-8
in the Six-Pac) are red-hot, the
winners of six straight and nine of
the last 10, and are currently
ranked 10th nationally. USC's
recent streak has brought them
to within two and a half games of
the Cardinal in the Six-Pac.
"This weekend is big," said
senior third baseman Steve Carv

er, who is batting .688 with three
home runs and 12 RBIs in the last
four games. "It has the potential
to make or break some of the
teams in the Pac-10 [South]."
The series could make it for
the Cardinal, which still holds the
top spot in the conference. In the
preseason, the Trojans were
picked to pace the conference
along with Stanford, and the Car
dinal might be all that can stop a
USC team that has a soft home
stretch schedule.
"These games could put USC
in a position to compete for the
title," Carver said. "For us to hold
on, to sweep or win two out of
three, will put us in a great posi
tion to wrap things up next week
end instead of waiting until the
last week of the season."
Stanford is certainly in a posi
tion to step up to the plate. The
Cardinal is in the midst of a win
ning spurt of its own, posting an
8-3 record and batting .335 since
the team took 12 days off for win
ter quarter exams. Hot players off

the Farm include catcher A.J.
Hinch, who is looking to extend
his 13-game hitting streak during
the weekend run. Hinch hit .400
and scored two runs in the first
USC series last month and has
racked up 17 RBIs and 23 runs
during his streak.
Carver is perhaps Stanford's
biggest story in the past week,
and he knows the importance of
his personal performance and his
team's performance this week
end.
"I want to lead the way," Carv
er said. "Last week I produced
and it took the pressure off some
of the other players, allowing
them to contribute in different
ways."

Not only did Carver produce,
he manufactured like a high
speed assembly line. His 11 RBIs
in the past two games, combined
with his three home runs and 7-
for-9 showing at the plate, has led
the team in 16-3 and 25-6 mas-

sacres of UCLA and Nevada
respectively.
In addition to their win streak,
the Trojans will bring sophomore
southpaw Randy Flores into
Sunken Diamond today to match
up against Stanford right-hander
Todd Bartels. Flores is 7-2 with a
2.63 ERA on the season and has
had the Cardinal's number in the

past. He pitched his second com
plete game of the season en route
to USC's lone victory over Stan
ford this seaj-on, allowing only six
hits in the 5-1 contest. He is 3-0
with a 1.09 ERA lifetime against
the Cardinal.
But the Trojans will face a dif
ferent Cardinal team this after
noon, a squad that has dropped
only three games since meeting
USC one month ago in Los Ange
les. With the return of senior right
fielder Dusty Allen and the
improved batting, Stanford enters
this weekend's series primed and
eager to enter nab the upper hand
in conference standings.
In today's game, which will be
televised on a tape-delayed basis
by ESPN on Monday at 10 a.m.,
Bartels will make his fourth start
of the year. He earned the win in
Monday's victory at Nevada, but
has not pitched more than three

innings in a single game in 1995.
Friday's game will match up
Trojan hurler Ben Tucker (2-2,
3.75 ERA) and Stanford junior
lefty Mike Robbins. Robbins faced
only one batter in the first USC
series but is 3-0 this year with a
2.98 ERA. Tucker, a right-han
der, is coming oft an effective
start against Arizona State last
week in which he held a perfect
game for five innings.
The third game will feature
Trojan junior right-hander Brian
Cooper and Stanford freshman
righty sensation Kyle Peterson.
Peterson's stats would light up
Sunken Diamond any night, as he
is 7-1 with a 2.52 ERA and four
complete games this year. He
pitched a stellar complete game
against USC last month in Stan
ford's 9-1 victory, allowing only
one unearned run and collecting
five strikeouts.
