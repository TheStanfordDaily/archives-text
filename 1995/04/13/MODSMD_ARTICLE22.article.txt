# On the run
## Track off to Mt. San Antonio 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
After several weeks of head-to-head competition,
the Stanford track team heads south this weekend
for a little variety at the Mt. San Antonio College
Relays.
A versatile core group of runners, throwers and
jumpers will make the trip to Walnut, Calif., east of
Los Angeles. Most of the Cardinal's qualifiers are
also Pacific 10 Conference qualifiers, so this week
end's meet will be a yardstick to Stanford's chances
at the conference championships.
On the women's side Stanford sends a strong
group of sprinters who have proven themselves over
the course of the season. The women's mile relay
team of junior Monica Hoggatt, freshman Heather
Miller, senior co-captain Christy Boyd and sopho
more Tyra Holt make the trip after an impressive
victory over Oregon and Fresno State last weekend.
After a highly successful indoor season, Boyd
feels that the mile relay team is ready to compete

outdoors against some of the best.
"This is a time to look at where the competition is
outside the Pac-10," Boyd said. "It's nice to have dif
ferent faces to compete against."
Boyd will also enter the 400-meter hurdes early
Saturday morning where she hopes to raise her run
ning to another level in preparation for th> champi
onship meets. She is only 0.7 seconds from the
NCAA provisional qualifying time. Like her team
mates, Boyd sees this weekend's meet as a perfect
opportunity to reach new standards.
"It's fun because we get to change .jears from a
team atmosphere to a more individual atmosphere,"
Boyd said.
Holt, who anchors the mile relay, fdso shares the
American record in the pole vault. Qi Friday night,
she will get an opportunity gain sde possession of
the mark.
For the men, senior Travis Clarf, last year's Pac
-10 decathlon champion, heads down a little earlier to
start the 10-event competition.
Throughout the season Clark
has varied his events at meets to
gain all-around experience. Last
weekend Clark ran the open 400
meters, pole vaulted and ran a
leg on the mile relay.
The bulk of the 25 men at Mt.
SAC will be field event athletes
and distance runners. Senior co
captain David Popejoy and
sophomore Pete Swanson will
throw their weight around in
the hammer and shot put, hop
ing to better their already
impressive marks. Both Popejoy
and Swanson distinguished
themselves at the NCAA
Indoors Championship, scoring
all of Stanford's eight points.
The throwers also provided
most of the points at last week
end's home meet. The field event
athletes have consistently sup
ported the team scores over the
last two years under the expert
instruction of throwing coach
Robert Weir, a world record
holder at the indoor weight and
British Olympian in the hammer
and discus in the early 1980s.
Both track and field stars
need to excel to assure the
team's success. After Mt. SAC
the squad hopes to be in a posi
tion where it can identify the key
players in the season's future
and work toward a common goal.
"The Mt. SAC meet is an
important opportunity for our
team to bond well," Popejoy
said. "It should be a good com
petitive meet for everyone."
