# On the run
## Track off to Mt. San Antonio 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
After several weeks of head-to-head competition,
the Stanford track team heads south this weekend
for a little variety at the Mt. San Antonio College
Relays.
A versatile core group of runners, throwers and
jumpers will make the trip to Walnut, Calif., east of
Los Angeles. Most of the Cardinal's qualifiers are
also Pacific 10 Conference qualifiers, so this week
end's meet will be a yardstick to Stanford's chances
at the conference championships.
On the women's side Stanford sends a strong
group of sprinters who have proven themselves over
the course of the season. The women's mile relay
team of junior Monica Hoggatt, freshman Heather
Miller, senior co-captain Christy Boyd and sopho
more Tyra Holt make the trip after an impressive
victory over Oregon and Fresno State last weekend.
After a highly successful indoor season, Boyd
feels that the mile relay team is ready to compete

outdoors against some of the best.
"This is a time to look at where the competition is
outside the Pac-10," Boyd said. "It's nice to have dif
ferent faces to compete against."
Boyd will also enter the 400-meter hurdes early
Saturday morning where she hopes to raise her run
ning to another level in preparation for th> champi
onship meets. She is only 0.7 seconds from the
NCAA provisional qualifying time. Like her team
mates, Boyd sees this weekend's meet as a perfect
opportunity to reach new standards.
"It's fun because we get to change .jears from a
team atmosphere to a more individual atmosphere,"
Boyd said.
Holt, who anchors the mile relay, fdso shares the
American record in the pole vault. Qi Friday night,
she will get an opportunity gain sde possession of
the mark.
For the men, senior Travis Clarf, last year's Pac
-10 decathlon champion, heads down a little earlier to
