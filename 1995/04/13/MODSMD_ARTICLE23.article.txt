# Sailing sets sights on the big time
## 7th-ranked Stanford to test East Coast waters

"If I can make it here, I'll
make it anywhere."
That is the tune the Stanford
sailing team will be singing as it
travels to New York for one of its
most important regattas of the
season. The prestigious Admi
ral's Cup will pit Stanford
against top-notch East Coast
competition in a measure of the
Cardinal's relative strength as it
heads into district and national
competition.
The Admiral's Cup is a major
intersectional fleet racing regat
ta hosted by the U.S. Merchant
Marine Academy in Kings Point,
N.Y. At such a major event —
and at this late point in the sea
son — teams are trying to estab
lish dominance heading into
championship competition.
Regattas are no longer used for
experience or practice, intensify
ing the competition. The 20
schools entered in the Admiral's
Cup have the same objective —
to win. Stanford is no exception.
"We are definitely at a peak
point in the season," said Stan
ford Coach Steve Bourdow. "We
don't want to go home and start
over."
Currently seventh in the
nation, the Cardinal will have
the opportunity to challenge five
higher ranked teams. No. 1 Navy

enters the regatta favored to
win, followed by No. 3 Tufts, No.
4 Old Dominion, No. 5 College of
Charleston and the No. 6
Marines. Stanford defeated Navy
and Old Dominion in competi
tion earlier in the season, yet
still lack the respect necessary to
garner a high ranking. Rather
than protest and politic, Bour
dow welcomes the team's deflat
ed position in the polls. He rel
ishes the roll of underdog and is
looking forward to facing the
stiff competition.
"I'm hoping to find out where
we stand with other teams in the
country," Bourdow said. "We
haven't checked in a long time."
Stanford will be traveling
light this weekend, sending a
"skeleton crew," meaning the
team will send only enough
sailors necessary to fill the boati.
The Cardinal will also bring one
additional team member to
accommodate possible condition
shifts.
The two-day event is divided
into three divisions. Sailors will
be using Flying Junior boats in
the A division, 420 boats in B
competition and the single
manned Lasers in C. Because
Lasers are rarely used in West
ern competition, Stanford will
concentrate on the A and B divi
sions.
