# Golf awaits final home invite
## 
### John Lawson Contributing writer 
If you hadn't noticed, spring has definitely hit
the Farm.
With the arrival of shorts, shades and sunblock
is the anxious realization by all spring sports
teams that they are entering the crux of their sea
son. And, no one knows that better than the third
ranked Stanford women's golf team.

'Arizona State has a great team.
But I think they're beatable.'
-Amy Lawrence

This Saturday and Sunday the Cardinal will
play host to 11 other squads in the California
Women's Intercollegiate at the Stanford Golf
Course. The field is smaller than those in most

strong tournaments, but it does include No. 2 San
Jose State, No. 5 UCLA and a USC team that fin
ished sixth in the Ping/ASU Invitational two
weeks ago.
In that tournament, the Cardinal showed a will
that head coach Tim Baldwin had not seen so far
this year but knew he would have to if he wanted
his team to contend for the NCAA title at the end
of May.
"Arizona State had already won the tourna
ment, and San Jose State had a 15-shot lead on us
for second place with four holes to play," Baldwin
said. "We were able to charge through those
remaining holes really well and beat out the Spar
tans, who the San Jose Mercury News had
declared a better team than ours a few days earli
er. I was awful proud of our girls."
It has been hard for the Cardinal to play consis
tent golf this year due to the heavy rain that hit
the Bay Area during winter quarter. The Stanford
course — which has been under
repair throughout the year as
every green and many fairway
bunkers have been reformed for
easier drainage — has also
caused problems. This $1 million
project was just recently com
pleted, leaving the Cardinal with
less of a "home-course advan
tage" for the California Colle
triate than the team would like.
'it's always nice to play on
your own course," Baldwin said,
"but we're not as familiar with
it this year. Hopefully, we'll be
ible to overcome that and get a
victory," which his team hasn't
done in two months.
The main reason for that has
l>een the presence of two-time

defending NCAA champion, No.
1 Arizona State, which has
looked nearly invincible in
recent tournaments, with an
average margin of victory of
over 30 strokes in their last
three.
"Arizona State has a great
team. They're loaded with tal
ent," said senior Amy Lawrence.
"But I think they're still beat
able. We were very close to them
in earlier tournaments last fall."
The Sun Devils are absent
from this weekend's 36-hole
event, which will commence at
8:30 a.m. each morning. Every
team begins play at the same
time in what is known as a
"shotgun start."
Teeing it up for Str, ford will
be Lawrence and fellow senior
Jamille Jose, junior Vicky Stra
da, and sophomores Andrea
Baxter and Mhairi McKay.
