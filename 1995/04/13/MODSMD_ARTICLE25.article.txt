# No. 2 men's golf thirsty for victory in Arizona

"Drink a lot of water."
Such a simple piece of advice
for the head coach of the second
ranked golf team in the nation to
be giving his players. And yet,
Wally Goodwin will repeat that
mantra until he goes hoarse — he
knows his team's success depends
on it.
When the defending national
champion Cardinal travels down
to Tempe, Ariz., this weekend for
the three-round Thunderbird
Invitational, getting enough flu
ids will be the key to surviving
the brutal Arizona heat.
"I can't stress enough, the
importance of getting the guys to
drink," Goodwin said. "A cool day
there is a scorcher here in Palo
Alto, and we're just not used to
playing in that kind of heat."
The Cardinal learned a tough
lesson at last year's event — host
ed annually by Arizona State —
when the team suffered dehydra
tion during the tournament's sec
ond round and ultimately fell out
of contention.
"We just didn't drink enough
water and the temperature was
well above 90 [degrees]," Good
win said. "The problem with not
getting enough water is that you
don't really feel it until it's too
late, so we have to be very cau
tious."
Even if Stanford is able to
combat dehydration however,

there is still the matter of a high
ly competitive field which
includes No. 1 Oklahoma State
and No. 4 Texas. The Cowboys
displaced the Cardinal as the
nation's top-ranked team in late
February and has clearly been
the team's toughest rival.
"This will be a good meet for
us because of their presence in
the field," Goodwin said. "This
tournament will be important for
rankings."
Despite the obvious edge the
Cowboys have with the voters,
the competition between the two
squads has been fierce. In head
to-head play, OSU sports a 4-2
advantage, but when Stanford
does win, it destroys. The stroke
advantage between the two
schools lies heavily on the side of
the Cardinal at 53.
"We are definitely competitive
with them," Goodwin said.
"Three out of the four times they
beat us, it was by two or less
strokes, and when we beat
them...
Arizona State's home course
will be yet another ordeal that the
Cardinal will have to overcome.
While the course is not especially
long, there are a number of tricky
holes, and putting proves to be a
problem for all. Constantly sub
jected to the searing heat, the
greens have been baked hard and
are among the fastest Stanford
has played on.
