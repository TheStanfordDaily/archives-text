# Postseason success for both polo teams

The Cardinal polo teams fin
ished their seasons with strong
showings in postseason play, with
the women's team qualifying for
the national tournament for the
first time in Stanford polo histo
ry-
The men'B squad fell to USC in
the regional tournament, which
was held at the end of last quar
ter. The Cardinal led most of the
way but lost in the last chukker
largely because of fatigued hors
es.
"The season didn't go as well
as we'd have liked," said junior

Jason Knight.
All three players that compet
ed in the regionals this year will
be returning next season. Along
with Knight, junior JefT Heeder
and sophomore Adam Strom will
both be back. Looking forward to
next season, Knight said, "We
expect to do very, very well."
The women's team played well
enough in postseason action to
distinguish itself as the first Car
dinal women's squad to win
regionals and participate in the
nationals.
In the regional semifinals, the
women beat UC-Davis in sud
den-death overtime. Sophomore
Courtney Riggle scored the win
ning goal that sent the women's
team into the regional final.
In the final, the Cardinal
faced USC, which won the
match 11-9. Just when the sea
son appeared over, officials
learned that the Trojans had
fielded an ineligible player. As a

result, USC had to forfeit, send
ing the Cardinal to the next
level.
The national tournament
took place in Fort Worth,
Texas, April 4-8. Once there,
the Cardinal team, consisting of
Riggle, junior Ilia Christy,
senior Suejin Hwang and fresh
man Alexa Christy, faced top
seeded Connecticut in the first
round.
UConn played a hard and
fast East Coast-style game. "In
the first chukker, we just got
swept away," Ilia Christy said.

The Cardinal could not over
come the Huskies' quick start
and fell 18-9, but made a strong
showing considering the team's
relatively young age.
With only one of the starters
graduating, the women's team
is excited about their prospects
for next year.
"We are improving really
fast," Ilia Christy said. "Next
season we plan to travel around
much more and compete with
teams that play the style of play
you see in the nationals. We
have tremendous potential."
