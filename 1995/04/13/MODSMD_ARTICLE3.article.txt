# Smith presents powerful perspectives
## 
### Kristie Lilje 
About 700 students, faculty and other mem
bers of the Stanford community packed into a
crowded Dinkelspiel Auditorium last night to
hear renowned actress and writer Anna Deavere
Smith bring to light issues that permeate Amer
ican culture.
As part of the Haas Center's 10-year anniver
sary celebration, Smith was asked by Haas Di

rector Tim Stanton to read from some of her
works — a dynamic reading which included se
lections from "Fires in the Mirror" and "Twi
light — Los Angeles, 1992."
Conducting interviews with people over a 13-
year period for her works, Smith sought to
weave diversity into a "stage that was not as di
verse as the society it was within."
Her "important mission" began, she recalled,
as she invited people "to see themselves per

formed by me." Her works represent her por
trayals of these different characters and the var
ious insights she has gained from them, she said.
Interested in the language of society and how
it represents a person, Smith explained that lan
guage is rhythmical, although not always sensi
cal. "People speak in organic poetry," she said.
Her first reading, which highlighted this
rhythmical speaking, came from
the man she said had the "best jazz
on language." The performance
elicited spontaneous outbursts of
laughter and applause from the
audience.
Smith added that her interests
also include social issues. Her sec
ond piece, "Glass All Over My
Clothes," showed what Smith
called the "importance of imagery
in organic poetry." The work,
which dealt with a black student's
experience at the University of
Georgia during integration,
showed Smith's capability to
change the entire mood of the
audience within a few short min
utes.
Most of her time, however, was
spent on pieces from the highly
acclaimed "Fires in the Mirror"
and "Twilight — Los Angeles,
1992."
"Fires in the Mirror" repre
sents a series of perspectives
Smith gained through her inter
views concerning the Crown
Heights riots in Brooklyn in
1991 between Jews and blacks,

which arose over the death of a
seven-year-old black boy and the
subsequent shooting of a Jewish
man.
The pieces Smith read from
this work highlighted the varying
perspectives in the community
over the two deaths. One piece
from the Rev. A 1 Sharpton, enti
tled "Rain," addressed the justice
system for the black community,
while a piece entitled "The Coop"
presented the Jewish view of the
situation.
Ending the night with selec
tions from "Twilight," she simi
larly highlighted a variety of per
spectives — a newspaper editor, a
Mexican jogger, a real-estate
agent — on the 1992 Los Angeles,
riots.
Responding to the crowd's jubi
lant standing ovation as she left
the stage, Smith returned to read
another selection that relayed the
problems of the judicial system.
Through "Maria," who served
as a juror in the second trial of the
four officers accused of beating
Rodney King, Smith articulated
the prejudices jurors carry into
the trial with them.
Smith said she aimed to create
a "physical way to juxtapose voic
es" in her work.
