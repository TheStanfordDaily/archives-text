Less than a year ago, Spin magazine senior writer Jim
Greer wrote a feature on Dayton, Ohio's Guided by Voic
es discussing how they "have been cranking out great
songs by the barrow-load for close to a decade." Previewing
their then-new album, he added," 'Bee Thousand' promises
more of the 10-fi splendor GBV thrives on, a crazy mix of'6os
psychedelic pop, Sebadoh-style experimentation and massive
tape hiss."
Months later, Greer is part of that crazy mix as the band's
new bass player. Putting his Spin career on hold, Greer got the
spot when old GBV bassist Greg Demos left the band to pur
sue a career in law. Band leader Robert Pollard auditioned
Greer, who had played in bands before and met all the basic
requirements.
"There were a lot of people who wanted to play bass for the
band," Greer says. "But a lot of them didn't live in Dayton.
And that's kind of a requirement Bob has: You have to live in
Dayton — and you have to drink a lot of beer."
It probably also helped that Greer was a well-documented
GBV fan, a rare member of the mainstream press who actual
ly paid attention to what was bubbling under the surface of
the Dayton indie scene.
"My involvement was in giving them their first bit of main
stream exposure," Greer says. "But there was a huge under
ground buzz way before I was writing about them. The main
stream thing was going to happen whether I did it or some
body else did. 1 just happened to live in Dayton, so it was just
more obvious to me than it might have been to a lot of peo
ple."
With a knack for churning out ragged rock treasures by the
dozen, the GBV phenomenon — now consisting of Pollard,
Greer, Tobin Sprout, Mitch Mitchell, Jim Pollard and Kevin
Fennell — wasn't going to stay underground for long. With or
without Greer's flattering press, it's hard to imagine a group
this bold and sweet going unnoticed.
Mow that the band has finally stepped onto the fringes
of the mainstream, Pollard's long-time musical hobby
has become a full-time job. Last spring, Pollard quit
his job as a fourth-grade school teacher to devote more time
to the band. Since then, the group has kept busy, playing
shows across the country and releasing a stunning amount of
material, including last summer's "Bee Thousand," a 5-CD
boxed set of early recordings and the brand new album "Alien
Lanes."
The band's 10th release and its first on new label Matador,
"Alien Lanes," offers another shimmering glimpse into the
basement daydreams of the self-proclaimed "sad freaks."
Slightly more aggressive than "Bee Thousand," "Alien Lanes"
charges through 28 tracks of sweet pop hooks with a solid
rock drive, bursting crazily in and out of songs, frequently
without warning.
"We deliberately didn't leave space between any of the
songs in the overlap," Greer says, explaining the quick, jumpy
transitions. "The way they all bust in, it's just continuous."
Pollard plays similar games with his lyrics. While they
seem to come out of nowhere, they retain a certain power and
relevance from Pollard's imaginative honesty and flexibility.
Pollard can get away with a line like "Unless you've got the an
swers/Don't patronize the mountain man" from 1987's
"Devil Between My Toes" album because, somehow, he
makes it mean something.
"When Bob writes his lyrics, they're very stream-of-con
sciousness," Greer says."I think they have a lot of meaning,
but 1 think it varies according to what you want to put into it.
It's almost like an interactive exchange. They mean many dif

ferent things to many different people. And they mean differ
ent things to him at different times."
The GBV songwriting process sometimes starts at Pol
lard's breakfast table with a morning session of laid-back
brainstorming.
"He'll get up in the morning, have a cup of coffee and fill a
page up with a bunch of cool-sounding titles," Greer says.
"And then he'll look at those and pick out the ones that are
just begging to be made into songs. Then he'll write the lyrics
... and a lot of times he pores over them later and tries to fig
ure out what they mean, or we'll all sit around and talk about
what they might mean."
With titles like "Pimple Zoo," "Ergo Space Pig" and"The
Goldheart Mountaintop Queen Directory," GBV has served
up some of the most powerfully nonsensical songs in memo
ry, a staggering mix of wild imaginations, heart-felt emotions
— and maybe a few drinks.
"We're definitely beer drinkers," Greer says. "You have to
drink beer when you rock — or at least we have to. It's like a
liquid backbone-intensifier, or liquid stage fright-reducer."

I he beer-factor has typically lent the band's live shows
an element of unpredictability, making raw emotion
rawer and gritty tunes grittier. Greer is quick to admit
that GBV has had its fair share of drunken stage accidents.
"Bob does a lot of rock moves on stage," he says, describ
ing an incident at a recent show. "There's a lot of kicking,
jumping, and dancing and stuff. And this one time he was just
doing a kick or something and slipped on the floor and fell on
the amps.
"But there haven't been any real disasters," Greer adds.
"Last night Bob kicked my bass and it stopped working for a
song, but 1 fixed it. A few nights ago I hit Toby upside the head
with my bass. Just little mishaps like that."
It's easy to imagine these little mishaps while listening to
the jagged and reckless songs on "Alien Lanes," rolling in
and out and bumping into each other along the way. But all
the band's rough edges just serve to make the melodies
sweeter, allowing GBV to carry an emotional charge as in
toxicating as anything you might find in a bottle.
