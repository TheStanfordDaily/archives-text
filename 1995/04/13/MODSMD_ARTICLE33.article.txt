# Common Culture's chaos
## Havel hits the stage at San Francisco's Phoenix Theatre 
### Linda Friedlieb 
San Francisco's Phoenix Theatre is an old
gem that's lost a bit of its sparkle, but
Common Cultural Practice is attempt
ing to re-ignite the theater's fire this week
with a chaotic production of Vaclav Havel's
"The Increased Difficulty of Concentration."
Located in an old converted warehouse at
Eighth and Folsom, you have to pass through
a locked security door and wander a maze of
hallways lined with concrete blocks just to
find the theater entrance. So nondescript is

the entrance that I passed it
twice opening night before re
alizing I was in the right place.
The Phoenix has none of
the modern conveniences of
newer, more expensive the
aters: no valet parking or even
outrageously costly garages
nearby, and no built-in bar
area. Parking is on the street,
and you're lucky if you can get
it. Coffee for intermission is
made back stage; Friday night,
it was accidentally made a bit
too strong and handed out for
free.
Inside the Phoenix, there
are no assigned seats; the only
rule is to avoid sitting in those
with masking tape running
from arm to arm. They are not
reserved — they're broken.
Still, amid the slightly run
down atmosphere of the
Phoenix, the work of Havel —
once a playwright, now presi
dent of the Czech Republic —
appears just right. Both are
worn-down: the theater from
overuse and age, the society
Havel writes about from the

chafing restraints of totalitarianism. In each
case, this form of atmospheric exhaustion
leads to a breakdown of the natural orcier.
Thus, everything is a bit chaotic and un
certain, both on stage and off, at "Increased
Difficulty."
Our hero for the evening is Dr. Eduard
Huml (Wendell Willat), an abstract social
scientist (of some sort) who juggles a wife
and a mistress, each of whom believes that
Huml will dump the other and go on to a

fairy-tale ending with her.
Huml spends his non-amorous time with
his secretary, dictating abstract gibberish
with an air of authority in typical absent
minded professor style: "Happiness is, in the
exact meaning of the word, unstable, chang
ing... and yet at the same time happiness is
something permanent."
"Increased Difficulty" takes place within
a day (more or less) in Huml's life, but in a
set of disjointed scenes which jump back
wards and forwards in time — covering
breakfast with his wife, a morning meeting
with his secretary, a noontime rendezvous
with his mistress, an afternoon meeting with
some scientists who wish to study him, and
then evening spent back with his wife.
Yet, none of this happens in order. Fans
of "Pulp Fiction" can learn that Havel
predates Tarcntino in making past,
present and future simultaneous yet inter
changing. The only set (designed by Iva Wal
ton) is a dining area, complete with table,
chairs, abstract murals painted on the walls
and an easy chair. Four doors lead outside, to

the kitchcn/pantry, to the study and to the
bedroom and bathroom.
As characters exit, we never know who to
expect to come through which door into
what scene which we may or may not have
seen part of already. We may be jumping
ahead, or backwards, or merely — some
times most unexpectedly — staying within
the same scene.
Directed by Common Cultural Practice
founding member Zach (single name, like
Cher and Madonna), "Increased Difficulty"
is an exercise in both physical and psycho
logical chaos. This is demonstrated most ex
plicitly in the scenes between Huml and the
highly suspicious scientists who wish to ex
amine him using a machine called Puzuk, a
contraption intended to ask the correct
questions to help determine the pattern of
the uniqueness of humanity (more or less a
contradiction in terms).
Although the scientists have trouble get
ting their masterpiece working, eventually
Puzuk asks questions which bring the confu
sion and complexities of life down on Huml,
causing him to panic.

Willat turns in an adequate performance
as Huml, but is often outshined by his female
costars: Karen Criswell as the mistress
Veronica, Sarah Huntington Rossell as
Huml's wife Vera and CCP founding mem
ber Fran Sholly as Dr. Anna Balcar.
In addition, Jennifer Taggert walks away
with her scenes when, as Huml's secretary
Bianca, she steals her boss' cookies (literally)
and frequently messes up dictation when her
eyes and mind focus on more interesting
things than the professor's ram-
blings.

Philosophically, Havel's play
sends an anti-totalitarian
message loud and clear,
making fun of the formalization of
both speech and academia
through Huml's meaningless
soapbox speeches. Anything that
could be construed as a real opin
ion is denied by Huml's deliberate
intent to make sure it cannot be ei
ther proven or disproven.
In addition, dialogue is
often repeated. For instance, both
Veronica and Vera tell Huml that
he has gone into decline since
starting to lead a double life. They
frequently ask the same questions
— "Do you tell her you love me?"
— generating identical responses
from Huml.
Speech, relationships and
life are ritualized to the point of
meaninglessness.
Ultimately, Havel's per
spective as president of a former
Communist country is clear. "In
creased Difficulty" provides an ab
surdist's critiuue of life in totalitar-

ian societies, demonstrating the destruction
of individualism and the collapse of thought
and language as independent constructs.
At one point in the play, Veronica tells
Huml, "1 dreamed yesterday we got married
in a mortuary." The line is a fitting metaphor
for this production — a hurst of newness,
creativity and modernity in the old, slightly
ragged Phoenix Theatre. ■
