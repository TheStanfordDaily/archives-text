# Focus on: Ristorante Piatti
## 
### Chi Elliott 
When my four year-old friend M. nodded
"yes" that she wanted Margherita (a pizza
with tomato, mozzarella and basil), our wait
er promptly asked her, "With green stuff or
no green stuff?"
A recent addition to the Tiburon-based
eight-restaurant chain, the Palo Alto Ris
torante Piatti offers an attention to detail that
distinguishes it from the majority of generic
Italian restaurant clones. From the muted
frescoes of vegetables and pasta dishes on the
walls, to the cheerful hand-painted bottles of
olive oil on each table, this Piatti has the feel
of an original.
Situated in the southeast corner of the
Stanford Shopping Center, Piatti is a com
fortably upscale, sociable open space with
charming murals and an abundance of nat
ural light. But don't be sidetracked by the
inviting decor. The number one reason to go
to Piatti is the food.
The menu boasts a good offering of Italian
standards and regional favorites. Entrees cost
$12 on average, with chef Aram Chakerian's
signature dishes like Scallopine de Vitello con
Porcini (a veal scallopine with porcini mush
rooms, proscuitto, white wine and butter,
served with grilled spinach polenta) priced

slightly higher ($16.95). Old favorites like
their angel hair pasta with fresh tomato,
basil, garlic and olive oil ($8.95) exemplify
the essence of Piatti cuisine — balance. Fla
vors are rich yet unobtrusive, with bold ac
cents like garlic, basil and saffron (all poten
tial trouble spots) blended to suit the charac
ter and textures of the dish. But watch out for
dishes with olives. My Pugliese (a pizza with
tomato, mozzarella, black olives, onion and
oregano) was so bitter I immediately regret
ted ordering it. My oven-roasted garlic bread
($3.50), however, more than made up for too
many olives.
Dining at Piatti is also a visual treat.
Friend M. and I counted the foods on the
murals, which kept us from staring at other

people's lunches. And the dishes themselves
are beautiful. Priced at $4.50, the Insalata
Mista (mixed baby greens tossed with fen
nel and carrots in a red wine vinaigrette)
looks freshly picked from a summer gar
den.
If I haven't mentioned the service yet, it's
because it speaks for itself. The amiable staff
seemed to anticipate my needs before I did.
Fresh bread (baked and driven in every
morning from their specialty baker in
Yauntville), ice water and freshly grated
parmesan and pepper were offered without
my having to ask, as was a booster seat for M.
1 just sat back, slurped on my iced latte (with
the perfect amount of milk!) and enjoyed the
meal.

Piatti is a good place to go for mealtime
conversations — either yours or the next
table's. The main drawback is the virtual im
possibility of not eavesdropping, at least in
the main dining room. Try to get seated on
the open-air terrace if you really want to gos
sip with your guest.
But why talk when you can eat their
desserts? With a baked cream custard with
caramelized sugar ($5.50) that just melts in
your mouth to everyone's favorite tiramisu
($5.95), super-light ladyfingers soaked in
espresso and rum layered with whipped mas
carpone cheese, who has time for conversa
tion? One warning — don't go buck-wild
with your main course if you want to have
room for dessert. Piatti's moderately-sized
portions don't look excessive but are really
quite substantial. So if you have a penchant
for pear torte with pear brandy sauce and
caramel gelato ($5.95), you'd better skip the
antipasti. And if you like your warm apple
crisp to be crisp (not butterlogged), you'd
better order it someplace else.
All said, Piatti is still the best Italian
restaurant I've been to in the area. The ser
vice is superb, the atmosphere pleasant and
the food is so good that you'll find yourself
interrupting your guest with "You have to try
this!" With a new spring menu being intro
duced this week and new desserts coming in
May, now is the perfect time to splurge on a
good meal. Why? Because the best endorse
ment for Piatti comes from my lunch date.
Said friend M. after finishing her pizza with
out green stuff: "It's better than
McDonald's!"
