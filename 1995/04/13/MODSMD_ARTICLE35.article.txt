## 'Once on this Island 
### 
When "Once on this Island" opens to
morrow night at Memorial Audito
rium, sophomore director Karen
Brecher is not going to be in the audience.
"I'm going to be sitting at my best friend's
home, hoping everything goes well. . . .
When the curtain goes up, it's out of your
hands," said Brecher.
When the curtain goes up, Ram's Head's
production of the Tony-nominated Broad
way show starts weaving its tale. And what a
tale it is. Set in the Caribbean, "Once on this
Island" is the story of a beautiful peasant girl,
I i Moune (Tami Jones), who falls in love with
Daniel (Brant Richards), a man outside her
class. Fairy tale, love story, fantasy yarn all in
one, the musical is about "peasants at the
mercy of wind and sea, (who) pray constant
ly to the gods."
How to describe it? Refreshing, breezy, en
tertaining. ... The show is close in flavor to a
Disney musical like "The Little Mermaid,"
but the setting is more "Wide Sargasso Sea"
than "Under the Sea."
But unlike Disney musicals, the plot of
"Island" has a socio-economic dimension to
it as it chronicles the struggle between the
poor black peasants and the ballroom-danc
ing French aristocracy. As a bonus, the hero
ine of the story is an independent, likable and
headstrong woman — coming-of-age, taking
risks and accepting consequences.
"I feel that the whole story is something
we all run into in our lives," Brecher said.

"Deciding what to do with our lives, telling
our parents and moving on. And facing the
fact that we may not eventually achieve our
final goal."
Rehearsals: "long hut fun"
It's Thursday night in the first week of
spring quarter and the production staff is
watching as the cast runs through the show in
Mem Aud. It's a scene featuring the two ro
mantic leads, Tami Jones as Ti Moune and
Brant Richards as Daniel. In this moment of
sweet romance, Jones is putting a charm
around Richards' neck — it's a token of her
love.
"Oh, shit, I broke it!" Jones exclaims, look
ing at the charm.
The production staff breaks into laughter,
and somebody claps.
"When they'd get together, we'd be con
stantly laughing," Brecher had mentioned a
few days before, talking about their goofi
ness. She added, smiling, "It's hard to get a se
rious rehearsal."
Full of energy and enthusiasm even at 10
p.m. after a full day of classes, Jones enter
tains the tired staff by pretending to do a
strip-tease on stage.
"We like to play around a lot, and that's
good tor the atmosphere of the rehearsals,"
Jones said about her rapport with Richards.
"It's all frustrating at first since we go bit by
bit, so we like to joke around a lot and have
fun."

That's true. The rehearsal is a series of
starts and stops, with movements and en
trances continually being changed. The light
est moments in that evening's rehearsal
comes from the witty interplay between
Jones and Richards. "We're really good
friends," Richards said. "We have this rela
tionship where we always give each other a
hard time and then we have to, 'Ah! Be in
love!' in the play."
Jones and Richards knew each other be
fore they were cast in the musical, when they
sang a capella together in Talisman. "The first
time we had to hug we burst out laughing. It
was funny as hell the first time we did it,"
Jones said.
Their relaxed and upbeat off-character
banter makes their relationship in the show
all the more sad and tragic. Daniel, after all,
does not come from the Tristan or Romeo
school of heroes. He is a complex character
whose actions can be interpreted as either
pitiful or cruel.
"Portraying the softer side of him is more
difficult than playing the asshole side of
him," Richards said about Daniel. "I just de
cided after playing this that assholes area lot
easier to play than victims."
After about two hours, the rehearsal for
the hour-and-a-half show is over. Generally
described as long but fun, the run seems to
have taken its toll on the actors, as some of
them wipe sweat off their foreheads and
rush offstage to change costumes.
"Rehearsals are fun. I'm bitter. I'm older,"
said choreographer and medical student
Alex Mazard, stifling a laugh.
"I probably would've had more fun if 1
didn't have to read Pathology for the next
day and study formed school exams,"
Mazard added.
Whistle while tjou work
I notice that even before rehearsal starts,
people in the cast are already singing tunes
from the show. According to Zimmerman,
when the cast files out after rehearsal they're
still singing the songs — even after working
on them for several hours.

" I he cast walks around singing this all tl
time, even at our retreat. It's so catch)
Brecher said. "Most people who don't like

musicals liked the music ofthe show. It's

like something you'd hear on the
radio."

The choreography, however, is
not the standard kicklines-and

showstoppers. There are several long

and complex dance sequences in the
show, some of them involving the whole

cast.
"Alex has done some really challenging
dances for us. They're very hard," Jones said
of Mazard's choreography. "It's a different
style of dancing than I've done before —

quite different from what you see in the
American stage."
Mazard said that the actors' difficulty
came from the fact that Caribbean dancing is
something you don't see in Western Euro
pean ballet. "The movements are lower to the
ground, to the earth," she said. These dances
required them to keep their bodies low and
do circular hip movements with a relaxed
spine. "It has a kind of rolling feeling," she
added. "Undulating."
After 11 weeks of rehearsal, the cast is now
in costume, and in character. But 12 weeks

before they reached this

stage, they had to au

Non-traditional casting?
Because the play is set in the Caribbean
amongst its peasant population, and because
the original Broadway production featured a
black cast, race might have come to be an
issue during the casting process. But Brecher
said race was not taken into consideration.
"It was completely merit-based," said
Brecher. "Nothing to do with race. When
people auditioned, they either felt right for a
certain part or they didn't. The show almost

cast itself. Someone would sing and we'd im
mediately know."
"Island" has eight principal roles — the
romantic duo of Ti Moune and Daniel, Ti
Moune's parents and four gods. Of them,
only one role is played by a white person, the
goddess of love Erzulie. Zimmerman took
over the role when the original actress
dropped out of the production.
"I don't know that they didn't [consider
race). Maybe they did, maybe they didn't,"
said Richards, who plays Daniel. "I think
they had to be sensitive to the fact that Stan
ford is not an all-black campus, and to

the fact that this is the biggest
production of the year."

An explanation
for the unusual

num
ber of

blacks in the pro
duction might be the

fact that more blacks would audition for a
play like "Island," with its African flavor and
large number of African characters, than for
a white-bread musical like "Oklahoma."
"I don't think there should be restrictions
in race in casting," Jones said. "But I'm glad
more people of color came out to audition."
Both Jones and Mazard feel that the inte
grated casting will not confuse audiences be
cause the universal story transcends race.
"It seems odd for me to be directing what
is apparently an all-black cast musical, but

the race isn't the most important aspect of
the story," Brecher said. "The most impor
tant aspect is the story. |Ti Moune's story)
could've happened to anybody. It's what im
mediately grabbed me."
Richards said that he was pleased with
how the cast's ethnic mixture turned out,
noting how the eight leading roles and the
chorus are interracial. According to
Richards, the musical itself constantly talks of
blacks and mulattos, and the Ram's Head
production did a "good job of being true to
the writer's intentions."
"The musical loses so much if you take out
the class struggle, and class is based on skin
color. [The director] did a good job of casting
the principals with people of color, at the
same time being sensitive to the fact that a lot
of people wanted to get involved."
Curtain call
When the curtain rises tomorrow night,
the end result of a year's work will have its
trial by fire. The producers, the sound and
light designers, the run crew and of course
the cast will be listening with attention when
the orchestra starts playing those first notes.
"I'm gonna... try to focus and feel lam
this character for the entire show and be very
convincing on stage," Jones said. "I just
wanna feel it. I just want it to come naturally
to me." She will probably look behind and see
a smile from her friend Brant.
As the actors become other people and go
on stage, they'll step into a fantasyland tar
from their own. Meanwhile, hundreds of
people will watch in the audience. "When the
curtain goes up, it's out of your hands,"
Brecher had said.
And into the minds and hearts of anyone
willing to hear the tale.

Its a woman's world, at least backstage in this "Island"; that's
where director Karen Brecher and producer Laura Wilson are
calling the shots.
"Trust tnc"
Karen Brecher sits up straight, wears glasses, and talks in a firm,
intelligent manner. But she's not anchoring a newsmagazine, and
Peter Jennings isn't sitting across from her. Karen's at the Coffee
House — describing her directing style as improvisational.
Brecher makes it clear that her directing style isn't dictatorial,
or mean. But that doesn't mean it's nice.
"I'm definitely both [mean and nice}. 1 don't like to play up the
fact that I'm the director," Brecher says. "Unless 1 have to." Junior
Kim Williams, who plays the goddess Asaka in the play, remem
bers a time when Brecher changed the blocking — how actors
move across the stage — upon the actors' request.
"We said we didn't like the blocking of a scene, and she thought
about it and the next day came back and said, 'You guys are right,'
and changed it," said Williams.
"She's coming from the perspective of a performer. A lot of di
rectors have only a technical background. But Karen has a visual
perspective," Williams added. "Performers, like myself, tend to be
temperamental. She knows what it's like to be on Mem Aud stage
for six hours, and you wanna cry, because you want to be pertect
but you keep messing up."
Brecher emphasized trust in working with what she fondly calls
a "crazy, efficient and off the wall" cast, "more on the loud side
than the not-so-loud side."
"It's hard to work on Mem Aud. It's huge. I'm working with
some frosh who don't know how tiny they look," said Brecher.
"They need to trust me when I tell them to overdo it."

"She's not spineless," Williams said. "She's very able to make
her own decisions without hurting other people's feelings."
"Mother Hen"
Brecher is the one captaining this boat to the shore during re
hearsals, but somebody else had the steering wheel before. Sitting
in the audience is producer Laura Wilson. Hired last May as the
producer of the spring show, she had the last word on choosing to
bring the "Island" to the Farm.
"It was great to do something that was new," she said. "In the
past we've done 'West Side' and 'Guys and Dolls.' We wanted to do
something new and original and exciting, not necessarily some
thing people had already seen."
Wilson got the rights for "Island," hired a production staff, held
meetings and planned all the social stuff. She describes herself as a
worry-wart — and as mother hen.
"I would hate to use the word mother hen," she says."I make
sure people are happy. I nitpick to make sure no area is left un
done."
Energetic and enthusiastic, Wilson uses the words "happy" and
"great" a lot during our interview. She's the kind of person that
people writing recommendations for her might describe as "car
ing" and "highly motivated." She talks about "Island" as if it were
her baby, full of pride and affection. But like every mother, she
wants to know how the other kids in the playground are treating
her baby.
"When is this article going to run?" Wilson asks. "I was won
dering if we could read a copy in advance?" I tell her that's against
Daily policy. Besides, I think to myself, we have enough proof
readers.

"Rehearsals are fun. I'm bitter. I'm older,"
said choreographer and medical student
Alex Mazard, stifling a laugh.
"I probably would've had more fun if 1
didn't have to read Pathology for the next
day and study formed school exams,"
Mazard added.
Whistle while tjou work
I notice that even before rehearsal starts,
people in the cast are already singing tunes
from the show. According to Zimmerman,
when the cast files out after rehearsal they're
still singing the songs — even after working
on them for several hours.

" I he cast walks around singing this all tl
time, even at our retreat. It's so catch)
Brecher said. "Most people who don't like

musicals liked the music ofthe show. It's

like something you'd hear on the
radio."

The choreography, however, is
not the standard kicklines-and

showstoppers. There are several long

and complex dance sequences in the
show, some of them involving the whole

cast.
"Alex has done some really challenging
dances for us. They're very hard," Jones said
of Mazard's choreography. "It's a different
style of dancing than I've done before —

Mazard said that the actors' difficulty
came from the fact that Caribbean dancing is
something you don't see in Western Euro
pean ballet. "The movements are lower to the
ground, to the earth," she said. These dances
required them to keep their bodies low and
do circular hip movements with a relaxed
spine. "It has a kind of rolling feeling," she
added. "Undulating."

Non-traditional casting?
Because the play is set in the Caribbean
amongst its peasant population, and because
the original Broadway production featured a
black cast, race might have come to be an
issue during the casting process. But Brecher
said race was not taken into consideration.
"It was completely merit-based," said
Brecher. "Nothing to do with race. When
people auditioned, they either felt right for a
certain part or they didn't. The show almost

cast itself. Someone would sing and we'd im
mediately know."
"Island" has eight principal roles — the
romantic duo of Ti Moune and Daniel, Ti
Moune's parents and four gods. Of them,
only one role is played by a white person, the
goddess of love Erzulie. Zimmerman took
over the role when the original actress
dropped out of the production.
"I don't know that they didn't [consider
race). Maybe they did, maybe they didn't,"
said Richards, who plays Daniel. "I think
they had to be sensitive to the fact that Stan
ford is not an all-black campus, and to

the fact that this is the biggest
production of the year."

An explanation
for the unusual

num
ber of

blacks in the pro
duction might be the

fact that more blacks would audition for a
play like "Island," with its African flavor and
large number of African characters, than for
a white-bread musical like "Oklahoma."
"I don't think there should be restrictions
in race in casting," Jones said. "But I'm glad
more people of color came out to audition."
Both Jones and Mazard feel that the inte
grated casting will not confuse audiences be
cause the universal story transcends race.
"It seems odd for me to be directing what
is apparently an all-black cast musical, but

the race isn't the most important aspect of
the story," Brecher said. "The most impor
tant aspect is the story. |Ti Moune's story)
could've happened to anybody. It's what im
mediately grabbed me."
Richards said that he was pleased with
how the cast's ethnic mixture turned out,
noting how the eight leading roles and the
chorus are interracial. According to
Richards, the musical itself constantly talks of
blacks and mulattos, and the Ram's Head
production did a "good job of being true to
the writer's intentions."
"The musical loses so much if you take out
the class struggle, and class is based on skin
color. [The director] did a good job of casting
the principals with people of color, at the
same time being sensitive to the fact that a lot
of people wanted to get involved."
Curtain call
When the curtain rises tomorrow night,
the end result of a year's work will have its
trial by fire. The producers, the sound and
light designers, the run crew and of course
the cast will be listening with attention when
the orchestra starts playing those first notes.
"I'm gonna... try to focus and feel lam
this character for the entire show and be very
convincing on stage," Jones said. "I just
wanna feel it. I just want it to come naturally
to me." She will probably look behind and see
a smile from her friend Brant.
As the actors become other people and go
on stage, they'll step into a fantasyland tar
from their own. Meanwhile, hundreds of
people will watch in the audience. "When the
curtain goes up, it's out of your hands,"
Brecher had said.
And into the minds and hearts of anyone
willing to hear the tale.

Its a woman's world, at least backstage in this "Island"; that's
where director Karen Brecher and producer Laura Wilson are
calling the shots.
"Trust tnc"
Karen Brecher sits up straight, wears glasses, and talks in a firm,
intelligent manner. But she's not anchoring a newsmagazine, and
Peter Jennings isn't sitting across from her. Karen's at the Coffee
House — describing her directing style as improvisational.
Brecher makes it clear that her directing style isn't dictatorial,
or mean. But that doesn't mean it's nice.
"I'm definitely both [mean and nice}. 1 don't like to play up the
fact that I'm the director," Brecher says. "Unless 1 have to." Junior
Kim Williams, who plays the goddess Asaka in the play, remem
bers a time when Brecher changed the blocking — how actors
move across the stage — upon the actors' request.
"We said we didn't like the blocking of a scene, and she thought
about it and the next day came back and said, 'You guys are right,'
and changed it," said Williams.
"She's coming from the perspective of a performer. A lot of di
rectors have only a technical background. But Karen has a visual
perspective," Williams added. "Performers, like myself, tend to be
temperamental. She knows what it's like to be on Mem Aud stage
for six hours, and you wanna cry, because you want to be pertect
but you keep messing up."
Brecher emphasized trust in working with what she fondly calls
a "crazy, efficient and off the wall" cast, "more on the loud side
than the not-so-loud side."
"It's hard to work on Mem Aud. It's huge. I'm working with
some frosh who don't know how tiny they look," said Brecher.
"They need to trust me when I tell them to overdo it."

"She's not spineless," Williams said. "She's very able to make
her own decisions without hurting other people's feelings."
"Mother Hen"
Brecher is the one captaining this boat to the shore during re
hearsals, but somebody else had the steering wheel before. Sitting
in the audience is producer Laura Wilson. Hired last May as the
producer of the spring show, she had the last word on choosing to
bring the "Island" to the Farm.
"It was great to do something that was new," she said. "In the
past we've done 'West Side' and 'Guys and Dolls.' We wanted to do
something new and original and exciting, not necessarily some
thing people had already seen."
Wilson got the rights for "Island," hired a production staff, held
meetings and planned all the social stuff. She describes herself as a
worry-wart — and as mother hen.
"I would hate to use the word mother hen," she says."I make
sure people are happy. I nitpick to make sure no area is left un
done."
Energetic and enthusiastic, Wilson uses the words "happy" and
"great" a lot during our interview. She's the kind of person that
people writing recommendations for her might describe as "car
ing" and "highly motivated." She talks about "Island" as if it were
her baby, full of pride and affection. But like every mother, she
wants to know how the other kids in the playground are treating
her baby.
"When is this article going to run?" Wilson asks. "I was won
dering if we could read a copy in advance?" I tell her that's against
Daily policy. Besides, I think to myself, we have enough proof
readers.



When "Once on this Island" opens to
morrow night at Memorial Audito
rium, sophomore director Karen
Brecher is not going to be in the audience.
"I'm going to be sitting at my best friend's
home, hoping everything goes well. . . .
When the curtain goes up, it's out of your
hands," said Brecher.
When the curtain goes up, Ram's Head's
production of the Tony-nominated Broad
way show starts weaving its tale. And what a
tale it is. Set in the Caribbean, "Once on this
Island" is the story of a beautiful peasant girl,
I i Moune (Tami Jones), who falls in love with
Daniel (Brant Richards), a man outside her
class. Fairy tale, love story, fantasy yarn all in
one, the musical is about "peasants at the
mercy of wind and sea, (who) pray constant
ly to the gods."
How to describe it? Refreshing, breezy, en
tertaining. ... The show is close in flavor to a
Disney musical like "The Little Mermaid,"
but the setting is more "Wide Sargasso Sea"
than "Under the Sea."
But unlike Disney musicals, the plot of
"Island" has a socio-economic dimension to
it as it chronicles the struggle between the
poor black peasants and the ballroom-danc
ing French aristocracy. As a bonus, the hero
ine of the story is an independent, likable and
headstrong woman — coming-of-age, taking
risks and accepting consequences.
"I feel that the whole story is something
we all run into in our lives," Brecher said.

"Deciding what to do with our lives, telling
our parents and moving on. And facing the
fact that we may not eventually achieve our
final goal."
Rehearsals: "long hut fun"
It's Thursday night in the first week of
spring quarter and the production staff is
watching as the cast runs through the show in
Mem Aud. It's a scene featuring the two ro
mantic leads, Tami Jones as Ti Moune and
Brant Richards as Daniel. In this moment of
sweet romance, Jones is putting a charm
around Richards' neck — it's a token of her
love.
"Oh, shit, I broke it!" Jones exclaims, look
ing at the charm.
The production staff breaks into laughter,
and somebody claps.
"When they'd get together, we'd be con
stantly laughing," Brecher had mentioned a
few days before, talking about their goofi
ness. She added, smiling, "It's hard to get a se
rious rehearsal."
Full of energy and enthusiasm even at 10
p.m. after a full day of classes, Jones enter
tains the tired staff by pretending to do a
strip-tease on stage.
"We like to play around a lot, and that's
good tor the atmosphere of the rehearsals,"
Jones said about her rapport with Richards.
"It's all frustrating at first since we go bit by
bit, so we like to joke around a lot and have
fun."

That's true. The rehearsal is a series of
starts and stops, with movements and en
trances continually being changed. The light
est moments in that evening's rehearsal
comes from the witty interplay between
Jones and Richards. "We're really good
friends," Richards said. "We have this rela
tionship where we always give each other a
hard time and then we have to, 'Ah! Be in
love!' in the play."
Jones and Richards knew each other be
fore they were cast in the musical, when they
sang a capella together in Talisman. "The first
time we had to hug we burst out laughing. It
was funny as hell the first time we did it,"
Jones said.
Their relaxed and upbeat off-character
banter makes their relationship in the show
all the more sad and tragic. Daniel, after all,
does not come from the Tristan or Romeo
school of heroes. He is a complex character
whose actions can be interpreted as either
pitiful or cruel.
"Portraying the softer side of him is more
difficult than playing the asshole side of
him," Richards said about Daniel. "I just de
cided after playing this that assholes area lot
easier to play than victims."
After about two hours, the rehearsal for
the hour-and-a-half show is over. Generally
described as long but fun, the run seems to
have taken its toll on the actors, as some of
them wipe sweat off their foreheads and
rush offstage to change costumes.
"Rehearsals are fun. I'm bitter. I'm older,"
said choreographer and medical student
Alex Mazard, stifling a laugh.
"I probably would've had more fun if 1
didn't have to read Pathology for the next
day and study formed school exams,"

noting how the eight leading roles and the
chorus are interracial. According to
Richards, the musical itself constantly talks of
blacks and mulattos, and the Ram's Head
production did a "good job of being true to
the writer's intentions."
"The musical loses so much if you take out
the class struggle, and class is based on skin
color. [The director] did a good job of casting
the principals with people of color, at the
same time being sensitive to the fact that a lot
of people wanted to get involved."
Curtain call
When the curtain rises tomorrow night,
the end result of a year's work will have its
trial by fire. The producers, the sound and
light designers, the run crew and of course
the cast will be listening with attention when
the orchestra starts playing those first notes.
"I'm gonna... try to focus and feel lam
this character for the entire show and be very
convincing on stage," Jones said. "I just
wanna feel it. I just want it to come naturally
to me." She will probably look behind and see
a smile from her friend Brant.
As the actors become other people and go
on stage, they'll step into a fantasyland tar
from their own. Meanwhile, hundreds of
people will watch in the audience. "When the
curtain goes up, it's out of your hands,"
Brecher had said.
And into the minds and hearts of anyone
willing to hear the tale.

Its a woman's world, at least backstage in this "Island"; that's
where director Karen Brecher and producer Laura Wilson are
calling the shots.
"Trust tnc"
Karen Brecher sits up straight, wears glasses, and talks in a firm,
intelligent manner. But she's not anchoring a newsmagazine, and
Peter Jennings isn't sitting across from her. Karen's at the Coffee
House — describing her directing style as improvisational.
Brecher makes it clear that her directing style isn't dictatorial,
or mean. But that doesn't mean it's nice.
"I'm definitely both [mean and nice}. 1 don't like to play up the
fact that I'm the director," Brecher says. "Unless 1 have to." Junior
Kim Williams, who plays the goddess Asaka in the play, remem
bers a time when Brecher changed the blocking — how actors
move across the stage — upon the actors' request.
"We said we didn't like the blocking of a scene, and she thought
about it and the next day came back and said, 'You guys are right,'
and changed it," said Williams.
"She's coming from the perspective of a performer. A lot of di
rectors have only a technical background. But Karen has a visual
perspective," Williams added. "Performers, like myself, tend to be
temperamental. She knows what it's like to be on Mem Aud stage
for six hours, and you wanna cry, because you want to be pertect
but you keep messing up."
Brecher emphasized trust in working with what she fondly calls
a "crazy, efficient and off the wall" cast, "more on the loud side
than the not-so-loud side."
"It's hard to work on Mem Aud. It's huge. I'm working with
some frosh who don't know how tiny they look," said Brecher.
"They need to trust me when I tell them to overdo it."

"She's not spineless," Williams said. "She's very able to make
her own decisions without hurting other people's feelings."
"Mother Hen"
Brecher is the one captaining this boat to the shore during re
hearsals, but somebody else had the steering wheel before. Sitting
in the audience is producer Laura Wilson. Hired last May as the
producer of the spring show, she had the last word on choosing to
bring the "Island" to the Farm.
"It was great to do something that was new," she said. "In the
past we've done 'West Side' and 'Guys and Dolls.' We wanted to do
something new and original and exciting, not necessarily some
thing people had already seen."
Wilson got the rights for "Island," hired a production staff, held
meetings and planned all the social stuff. She describes herself as a
worry-wart — and as mother hen.
"I would hate to use the word mother hen," she says."I make
sure people are happy. I nitpick to make sure no area is left un
done."
Energetic and enthusiastic, Wilson uses the words "happy" and
"great" a lot during our interview. She's the kind of person that
people writing recommendations for her might describe as "car
ing" and "highly motivated." She talks about "Island" as if it were
her baby, full of pride and affection. But like every mother, she
wants to know how the other kids in the playground are treating
her baby.
"When is this article going to run?" Wilson asks. "I was won
dering if we could read a copy in advance?" I tell her that's against
Daily policy. Besides, I think to myself, we have enough proof
readers.
