## Mary Lou Lord's mediocrity 
### 
Asked about indie-folkie Mary Lou Lord,
Courtney Love once told Spin magazine,
"There are five people in this world that if I
ever run into I will fucking kill, and she is
definitely one of them."
The Love-Lord feud — which allegedly
stems from a romantic encounter between
Lord and Kurt Cobain — has become alt
rock tabloid material that unfortunately is
mt)re interesting than Lord's recent self-ti
tled debut.

With the smooth voicc and delicate gui
tar work that decorates her eight-song
album, it is a shame that Lord isn't more
ambitious. Of the eight tracks, five are cov
ers, and they too often become muddled in
a steady stream of mediocre folk.
The album's one plugged-in track, the
Bevis Frond's "Lights Arc Changing" (fea
turing Juliana Hatfield on backing vocals),
is pleasant, upbeat and pretty, but its gener

ic appeal comes off like an oversimplified
Bettie Serveert b-side.
After that, the remaining tracks are solo
acoustic numbers that are consistently un
exceptional, with songs like "I'm Talking to
You" and"The Bridge" tip-toeing the line
between quietly soothing and plainly dull.
The album's most interesting track is
"His Indie World," which Lord wrote; in it,
she lists and taunts dozens of indie bands,
with lines like, "Eric's Trip and Rocketship /
Rancid, Rocket From the Crypt / Bikini Kill
and Built to Spill / It's plain to see that I
don't fit." Playfully defiant, this track is
catchy and surprising, with an attitude and
spirit that the rest of the album lacks.
The album ends on a disappointing note,
however, with Lord's straightforward and
watered-down rendition ofDaniel Johnston's
oft-covered classic "Speeding Motorcycle."
Lord can write a nice song and carry a
pretty melody but she has yet to develop a
personalized sound or character that sets
her apart from the scores of other un
plugged coffee house performers. Until
she finds a musical identity (Courtney
Love foe doesn't count), Lord seems cre
atively stifled by her obsession with per
fect folk.
