# The
						strong get stronger with Helium's brilliant 'The Dirt of Luck'

A year ago, an Alternative Press review of
the Helium's debut EP "Pirate Prude" de
clared that the Boston-area trio was "the best
and most challenging new band in America
today." What seems like hyperbole rings true
here, because it's difficult to imagine many
recordings so compelling and thrillingly con
ceived as that six song mini-album. As blunt
ly put as the empowering lyrics heard on the
work, "Pirate Prude" is perhaps the best of
fering of the past year.
From such lofty praise and sky-high ex
pectations rises "The Dirt of Luck," the band's
first LP. But the inevitable comparisons be
tween the two works are difficult to make be
cause the brilliant new effort takes a different
approach than its overpowering predecessor:
While "Pirate Prude" conquered with its sim-

mering brutality, "The Dirt of Luck" finds its
strength in bold cunning and sly trickery. In
turn, the mood of the music is delightfully
ambiguous, more frisky but every bit as inci
sive because mastermind / vocalist / guitarist
Mary Timony still bares her razor sharp
words. Only this time, they sneak a smirk as
they bite.
Indeed, Timony's ability to combine con
trary elements in seamless cohesion is a part
of what makes Helium's art so engrossing.

The album's opening track "Pat's Trick" sets
the tone from the start, bringing a meander
ing guitar line together with the flat, tense
bass thump that runs through the song. Tim
ony's piercing voice surges to the surface, up
front and anything but "creepy and sullen,"
the first words she sings. When she sneers the
chorus of "You are the most beautiful thing,"
Timony embraces multiple moods, mean and
wry, resigned and in control. The laziest
twang-pop of "Honeycomb" sways sugary
sweet while sourpuss verses are smoothly
done up; loud and quiet, the guitars on
"Skeleton" chop as Timony's hissy whisper
stirs up a creepy and spooky sentiment.
The subtleties complete Helium's euphor
ic sound and best testify to Timony's genius.
The ebb and tide of the majestic "Babv's

Going Underground" seem all the more
beautiful and imperious with the canny xylo
phone accompaniment to the chorus. On
"Silver Angel," a keyboard snippet creates a
dialogue with the standard guitar-bass
drums arrangement that parallels the conver
sation Timony has with herself in the lyrics.
That genius also emerges in the "simple"
accomplishment of delivering a word, phrase
or measure. Timony starts the chorus of"Su
perball" with "I'm small," then gets in an awk
ward "I'm fragile," and lets it tail off with an
emphatic "I'm mad as hell," the ends and
everything in between connect with everyone
who's been low and needed a boost. A mo
ment like that makes for a great record, and
"The Dirt of Luck" has many more.
