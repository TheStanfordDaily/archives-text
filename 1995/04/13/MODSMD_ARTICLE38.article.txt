# Peter Murphy emerges from the underground with a new sound
## 
### 
It is exceedingly difficult to review an
album by an artist you not only admire and
respect but also almost worship — you ogle
over interviews, own every CD by aforesaid
idol and impatiently await each new release.
To say the least, objectivity is not easy.

Peter Murphy has a long history of creating
good impressions. Bauhaus, Murphy's first
band (just add Love and Rockets, some hot
water and you have the same thing), was pow
erful enough to spark a whole scene of de
pressed people dressed in black. Murphy's
four previous albums arc appreciated for gor
geous, wry lyrics as well as soaring melodies.
"Cascade," Murphy's newest creation, is
incredibly wonderful. (Does that sound dis
gustingly gushy? Well, the album title justifies
it.) "Cascade" is not dark, it is not gloomy, it
is not baroque and cob-webby. Murphy sings:
"We are not asking no favors from the dead."
Actually, it is a relatively happy creation, with
songs such as the first single, "Scarlet Things
in You," bouncing along with the saccharine

vivaciousness found in most pop-albums.
Yes, "Cascade," could he described as top
-40 fodder, music I regard with passionate ha
tred. However, using imaginative lyrics, an
incredibly sexy voice and mysterious
melodies, Murphy almost redeems the genre.
"Cascade," the title song, features Murphy
alternately talking in low, hushed tones and
singing with the full, extensive range of his
voice: The effect is chillingly superb.

On "Subway," Murphy sarcastically de
clares, "There's a place where we can meet...
let love begin." Clearly no longer under
ground nor dismal, songs such as "Gliding
Like a Whale," "Sails Wave Goodbye," and
"Disappearing" are upbeat without being
cheesy, addictive without being harmful.
"Huuvola," about Murphy's children —
"one fine night the air did bring two little
ones" — is touching and slow. "Wild Birds
Flock to Me" is an immense soundscape.
"Cascade" is a surprisingly even album: It
contains no unpleasant songs, yet lacks the
next earth-shattering classic single that our
grandchildren will be listening to. It is simply
a remarkably enjoyable and listenable CD.
