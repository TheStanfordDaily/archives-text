# Nitzer Ebb's latest album offers listeners a 'Big Hit' of industrial-strength annoyance
## 
### 
There are things in this world which are
just inherently painful: having teeth pulled,
finding out about the death of a pet — and lis
tening to Nitzer Ebb's new album, "Big Hit."
The only way the CD lives up to its name is
that its auditory experience is somewhat sim
ilar to being repeatedly pummeled.

Once upon a
time, Nitzer
Ebb was actual
ly worthwhile.
The band
wasn't produc
ing music that

"Big Hit"
Nitzer Ebb

was going to shake the foundations of the
western world, but the songs it created had a
good beat you could dance to and they were
appropriately evil. Unfortunately, some ne
farious pumpkin godmother thing has
zapped the group's creativity and left it pro
ducing music which is boring at best and, at
its low points (there are many), sounds like a
wounded buffalo whining piteously.
According to the happy little press release
which accompanied the album, "Big Hit" is
supposed to be more acoustic, with more real
instruments than past Nitzer Ebb projects. 1
couldn't hear this at all. It sounded like pure,

unadulterated techno with pseudo-bitter
lyrics to keep it in the realm of "ini istrial
music." On first listening to the album I free
associated and thought "this must be the ele
vator music of the industrial world. ... On
the other hand, elevators are actually engi
neered, aren't they?"
So ... the songs themselves. Out of an
album of 10 songs, I was only tempted to lis
ten to one, "border talk," all the way to its end.
As 1 progressed through the hour-long CD,
the skip button on my stereo remote looked
increasingly seductive.
Lyrics such as "well, winter comes as soon
as summer is through, it's true," make my
econ book look truly erudite and poetic. With
its cowboy twinges, "floodwater" confused
me thoroughly.. .Garth Brooks meets a sam
pling machine? And "living out of a bag," was
reminiscent of the Beach Boys on acid, with
lyrics such as "i'm heading out across the sea /
i want the land and you alone with me."
"Big Hit" was monotonous and annoying.
It's one or two interesting moments were not
nearly long enough to redeem the rest of the
album. As Nitzer Ebb themselves sing,
"sometimes i feel it's taking me nowhere."
