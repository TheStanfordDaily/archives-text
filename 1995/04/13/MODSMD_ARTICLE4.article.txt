## Candidates taking a unique look at COP 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Sean Kennedy used to do birth
day parties. Now he wants to make
the Council of Presidents one big
party.
"I got to the point where I'd
have to drink 20 [beers] before I
could go to little kids' houses,"

Kennedy
said. "Then
one day I
puked on
cake. I
snapped
and now
I'm run
ning for

politics.
Kids did not like it. Instead of puk
ing on cake, I intend to puke on
ASSU cake .. . after 20 [Wein
hard's Ice beers]."
Kennedy, along with Chris On
stad, Eric Saxon and Scott Gagner
are running for COP under the
name "The Very Serious Clowns."
The four are running against
slates fronted by the People's Plat
form and Students' Alliance par
ties in the election to be held April
19 and 20.
They're not always serious,

though — only when their red
noses are off.
Affiliated with the Hammer
and Coffin party, the political arm
of the Stanford Chaparral humor
magazine, the four plan to take the
ASSU to the big top.
"We do expect to win," Onstad
said. "It's time to vote for blatant
ly, admittedly and concededly a
bunch of clowns."
However, each candidate's past
is not as rosy as their cheeks. Al
though Kennedy, a junior interna
tional relations has been a
Daily columnist and is a KZSU disc
jockey, he said he has tried all sorts
of drugs, Valium included. And
Gagner claimed to have led an up
rising against circus authorities
before he matriculated to Stan
ford.
Gagner, a junior English msyor,
said the experience provided him
with necessary leadership skills.
"It has given me great leaps and
bounds over the common Ameri
can citizen," he said. "We'd like to
stress that in our campaign. We'd
like to stress that as clowns, we
don't act silly, we don't juggle. We
represent the common man and

his struggle to survive under the
heavy hand of the oppressive
ringmaster of Stanford Universi
ty."
But the four were not as
descriptive when asked to
describe their future relationship
with University administrators.
Onstad did say that they "don't
plan to do serious things with the
administration" and that there
will be "lots of tickling and burp
ing."
Onstad, a sophomore commu
nication major, is editor of the
Chaparral this year. If elected, he
said he will work to open dinner
15 minutes earlier to prevent the
pre-dinner hunger which he
claims runs rampant through the
student body. He also plans to
construct a monstrous marshmal
low pillar in the center of campus.
"This campus is a circus, but
even a circus needs leadership,"
he said. "We are the natural lead
ers of this leadership. We envi
sion, hands raised, all of Stanford
under one tent."
Unity is a big issue in their
campaign. Saxon, a sophomore
earth systems major, claims that
"everyone can catch the clown

spirit. Everyone has a clown heart
inside them. The main agenda is
to make the campus more fun.
It's a pretty apathetic campus."
Though the issue of student
apathy has been addressed by all
three slates, Saxon said with the
clown spirit, school spirit can be
achieved. "When we appeal to
[the students'] sense of fun as
clowns, we will have a better,
more enriching experience at
Stanford," he said.
Other goals are to rewrite the
ASSU Constitution, although the
slate neither specified what the
new constitution would contain
nor how it would garner senate
support. They are also interested
in writing a "Clowntract With
Stanford," though, again, slate
members did not elaborate on the
substance of the document.
Gagner did specify that they
would be willing to "do whatever
we need to do." He said the slate,
if elected, may take on the roles
and responsibilities of a COP, but
only "if we feel like it next year.
We're planning on it."
Saxon, though , was not so opti
mistic. "Clowns have very short
attention spans," he said.
Though they have yet to for
mally begin campaigning, Saxon
said they will use flyers and
"clown surprises" to solicit votes.
"We will be making appearances

all over campus," he said. "We're
really running a common man
campaign."
With its homogeneous back
ground, the "Very Serious
Clowns" hope to push the clown
spirit from the tent to the political
spectrum — and vice versa.
"There's a whole new clown

movement going on," Saxon said.
"It's really important to know
this. The mainstream society
doesn't know this. Kind of a left
ist clown Utopia. Clownville. It
could be called Clownville."
Onstad summed up the Ham
mer and Coffin platform: "We're
not going to do shit," he said.
