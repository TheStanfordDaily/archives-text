# No need to ask about The Who: New release is essential music
## 
### 
One of the greatest bands to emerge from
the 19605, The Who had an extremely unique
sound. As melodic as they were powerful,
they preferred to invent rather than imitate.
While the Rolling Stones followed blues
greats such as Muddy Waters and Willie
Dixon, and the Beatles followed rock and roll
greats such as Chuck Berry and Little
Richard, The Who preferred its own blend of
"Maximum R & B." Rock's original punks,
they won over fans with their creativity, dar
ing and wit.
Furthermore, while the Beatles eventually
stopped touring entirely and other '60s icons
like Bob Dylan were as enigmatic as they
were successful, the Who never lost the con
nection with their audience. Their live shows
became legendary.
Dedicated to the masses, they never short
changed their concert fans. During the peak
of "Tommy," the band would play over an
hour of music in addition to the rock opera in
its entirety. The concert given at Leeds Uni
versity on Feb. 14, 1970 was such an event.
The Who's "Live at Leeds" album, de
scribed by the Rolling Stone Album Guide as
"one of the handful of essential in-concert
recordings," has been remastered and

re-released in an expanded

form. With the number

of tracks in
creased from
six to 14 and
the playing
time nearly
doubled, the
album's sta
tus has been
elevated
from essen
tial to un-

believable.
With fiery, tight performances of the sin
gles "1 Can't Explain," "Happy Jack" and "I'm
A Boy" the album continues in the vein of the
incendiary version of "Substitute" from the
original.

"Live at Leeds"
The Who

The album opens strongly with "Heaven
and Hell" and the guttural power of "Young
Man's Blues" (also from the original release).
It then veers off to include Pete Townshend's
first attempt at rock opera, "A Quick One,
While He's Away" as well as two songs from
that night's performance of "Tommy."
The album's climax, however, comes from
the same four tracks as the original: "Sum
mertime Blues," "Shakin' All Over," "My
Generation" and the juicy "Magic Bus." The
almost 15-minute version of "My Genera
tion" is especially inspired. Starting strong,
the song goes through numerous changes,
including a passage where Townshend

uses his own echo as counter-

point for his guitar.

Already
an incredible
album, "Live
at Leeds"
could now be
the greatest
live record
ing of its
generation
