# Buddy Guy's blues still sounding good
## 
### 
To the unenlightened ear, the first tones of
Buddy Guy's "Feels Like Rain" album sound a
whole lot like Stevie Ray Vaughn. The starting
track, "She's a Superstar," begins with soulful
ly twangy guitar that rips into fiery but sub
dued scales, held back only by the energetic
vocals of the one-and-only Buddy Guy. This
man sounds as sprightly as Robert Cray, and
his relentless emotional tones rock this album
consistently from start to finish.

Unlike some blues recordings, this effort is
clearly a studio one, done with many layers,
rich and perfect in composition. While mim
icking tracks like "Feels Like Rain" live would
be hard (with its gospel vocals, clean piano

"Feels Like Rain"
Buddy Guy

and slide guitar), you don't go to a Guy concert
to hear a perfect three-minute reproduction of
a three-minute song.
One of the tracks that conforms most
strictly to the conventions of straight blues is
"She's Nineteen Years Old," a song that es
chews thin guitar and lackluster vocals for the
deep sound of piano, guitar, bass, drums and a
crying harmonica 1 haven't heard the likes of

since Led Zep
pelin's first

album. This is blues
rock, not rock-blues, and

the music is performed not by a petty under
study but by the principal actor.
One of the many tasty tracks is the). Ellison
cover "Some Kind of Wonderful." Familiar yet
fresh, this ripping rendition has horn backup,
organ, guitar, piano, bass and background vo
cals. With a song this familiar, it is hard to
make it sound new, so Buddy Guy doesn't try.
He just makes it sound good — different
enough from the standard oldies-station ver
sion that you aren't repulsed by hearing it

again, but so
much the same
that he doesn't

try to stomp on the in
tegrity of the original song.

Featuring renditions of songs by John
Fogerty, Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye, James
Brown as well as a couple Buddy originals,
"Feels Like Rain" is sure to satisfy a broad au
dience, and is an excellent introduction to
blues music being produced today for the
tepid consumer. Out is the graininess and
harsh live quality of some older recordings; in
is the carefully-crafted sound of a man who
takes the time to treat his listeners right.
