# Risen from the metal underworld, White Zombie plays devil's lyre once again
## 
### 
Rising oncc again from the sludge of the
metal underworld is the ruffian clique known
as White Zombie, a group whose surreal blends
and macabre power chords could only have
been inspired by the devil. The Zombie's
sophomore seminar in supernatural sounds
has the burdensome title "Astro-Creep: 2000
Songs of Love, Destruction and Other Synthet
ic Delusions of the Electric Head," an appropri
ate precursor to a stormy listening experience.
Although White Zombie's new release

"Astro-Creep:
2000 Songs..."
White Zombie

echoes a ring familiar to the debut, "La Sexor
cisto: Devil Music Vol. 1," there are plenty of
progressive elements here that reflect a more
mature and experimental Zombie approach.
"More Human Than Human," an adventure in

stylistic fusion, unites a Trent Reznor industri
al clank with a melodic and hefty guitar sound,
all the time maintaining wonderful balance
and blend. Perhaps the most audacious of ex
periments comes on "Blood, Milk, Sky," a song
that marries hard-edged Western metal with
Far Eastern dance music. The concoction takes
on a character of its own, absorbing the origi
nal elements into an explosive musical explo
ration.
For White Zombie fans of old, "Astro-

Creep" continues a tradition of integrating
long-forgotten portions of 1950s horror flicks
into dense metal arrangements, forming a
retro soundtrack of sorts. But this time around,
the group embellishes the activity with longer
terror interludes. Coupled with the usual
strong chorus lines and creative instrumentals
that brought White Zombie to life with "La
Sexorcisto," the repertoire of "Astro-Creep" re
flects a technique molded to perfection.
