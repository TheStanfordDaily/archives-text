## Nothing to blame in 'Priest' 
### 
Typically, unbearable entities of hype
and controversy weigh down a much-an
ticipated film event so adversely that the
eventual experience markedly pales in
comparison with the preceding hulla
baloo. Thank the Lord for delivering
"Priest" to our

very eyes without
expectations
being let down, as
well as for the
corporate
courage of Mira-

Priest

max Films to stand by the film against a
seething Catholic Legion.
Hell hath no fury like a religion
scorned. In the same vein, "Priest" traces
the brutal path of action taken by the
Church against the protagonist Father
Greg (Linus Roache) who finds himself
outed by the tabloid press as a gay man.
Employing an uncommon reversal of
roles, Jimmy McGovern's script designates
the closeted priest as the staunch tradi
tionalist. The beer-guzzling, avidly
karaokeing heterosexual Father Matthew
(Tom Wilkinson) upsets his colleague's or
thodox mores by adopting a convicted left
ist stance in his sermons to an impover
ished congregation from working class
Liverpool.
It takes a tragic revelation from Lisa
(Christine Tremarco), a 14-year-old vic
tim of sexual abuse by her father, for Father
Greg to begin questioning the inadequacy
of clerical doctrines which have outlived
their historical legitimacy. Unable to in
form the proper authorities of Lisa's suffer
ing due to the sacred nature of the confes-

sion, Father Greg re
sorts to the "power" of
faith to do the right
thing.

The convenience of such melodramatic
devices — used again in the too-neat fi
nale — have somewhat undermined the
otherwise raw realism of a drab and deso
late English urban landscape. Neverthe
less, McGovern's virtuoso writing man
ages to convey an acutely-observed sense
of blue-collar humor amid the most
poignant of human confrontations not
just between one another, but also against
towering institutions of dogmatic
Catholicism and a legal system that sanc
tions the arrest of Father Greg and his
lover Graham (Robert Carlyle) for kissing
in their parked car.
Politically, Father Greg's conservatism
confounds his characterization, but it is a
position that McGovern and director An
tonia Bird strongly defends. Although Fa
ther Greg is never shown to arrive at any
kind of peace with his emerging sexuality,
the filmmakers have insisted on an in
your-face veracity in underscoring his
complex personal battles and his passion
ate liaison with Graham.
Consider Father Greg's articulation of
his emotional encounter with divinity —
Christ on the crucifix: "1 turn to him for
help, and 1 see a naked man, utterly desir
able." Sharply-worded sentiments like
these add up to a gutsy, if sometimes un
subtle, critique of organized religion that
demands an extended ovation from all,
and for believers, nothing less than a thou
sand Hail Marys.
