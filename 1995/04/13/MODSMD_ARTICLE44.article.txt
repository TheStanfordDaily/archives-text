# 'Rob Roy' swashbuckles with the best
## 
### 
If you are seduced by the backdrop of
rolling Scottish hills, the plight of honor and
the charm of broadsword battle, you will be in
cinematic heaven watching "Rob Roy." De
spite the film's kitschy name, this tale of a
Highlander's war against the stifling arm of

aristocratic oppression is not to be missed.
Honesty and integrity go beyond the
themes of this film and also rest with its cre
ators. "Rob Roy's" brilliance rises from direc
tor Michael Caton-jones ("Memphis Belle")
and writer Alan Sharp ("Night Moves"), both
of whom come from Scotland. Paying careful
attention to a stylized blend of language remi
niscent of the 18th-century period setting, yet
intelligible to the modern ear, this team has
created a film that enthralls from start to finish.
All three leads seem perfectly cast, Liam
Neeson ("Schindler's List") as the honorable
clansman who places character and loyalty
above all else, recent Oscar-winner Jessica
Lange as his strong but not bitter or brash
wife Mary and Tim Roth ("Pulp Fiction") as
the delicious dandy Cunningham, who
wields his sword with a callous might foreign
to his foppish appearance.
But what of the story itself? Conflict for

Rob Roy (a folk hero to the Scottish as Robin
Hood is to the English) begins when he bor
rows a thousand pounds from the Marquis of
Montrose, tax collector from the city's im
poverished, with the aim of keeping the small
community of villagers he oversees warm and
well-fed the coming winter. The money

proves a source of ir
resistible desire for
the down-and-out
nobleman Cunning
ham, who plots to
steal it and leave Roy
and his countrymen
penniless.

Rob Roy

Thus the stage is set for a battle between
the have and have-nots. Complicated by po
litical intrigue and the conspirator's mind
set, the question of honor and morals are ex
amined not only from the point of means but
also of ends.
"Rob Roy" is a tale of an epic hero, but not
one we would care to trade places with. And,
with a sword fight scene near the end that re
defines this over-glorified form of combat, we
have a film that leaves us not only elated, but
also panting for breath.
