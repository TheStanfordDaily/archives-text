# Apocalypse now for this 'Tank Girl:' This brain-dead sucker's out of gas
## 
### 
Envision yourself sitting tin the couch
early on any Saturday mornhjg watching
cartoons and eating the sugariest cereal
you can tind (Lucky Charms were always
my favorite). Your age doesn't matter:
Many college students still worship Scoo
by Doo. That's right, slip quickly back into
that brain-dead sugar-high state that so
many of us inhabited constantly as
younger children.
Now imagine paying $8 for the same
experience, except you have to sit in a
crowded movie theater filled with an audi
ence intimately familiar with the critical
eye of Beavis and Butt-head, minus the
sugar cereal. Also, the hero isn't an
adorable pot-head with continual
munchies and his oversized scaredy-dog,
hut a maniealiy stupid riot-grrrl wanna
be.
To put it mildly, "Tank Girl" kind of
sucks. It's pointless* plotless* brainless,
mindless, repetitive, unoriginal and long.
It has its cute points, but they are clich£d,
few and far between.
The entire cast of characters of "Tank
Girl" is appropriated from other movies.
Rebtxca the tank girl (fori Betty) is remi
niscent ttyle-wise of Madonna in her
"Borderline'' days and, acting-wise, of her
"Who's That Girl" period. Petty's helium
influenced voice and laugh are extremely
grating. The villain, Kieslee (Malcolm Mc-
Powell), quotes poetry, hordes water
(don't even ask about the plot — vou don't
want to know), and finally turns into
something resembling Dr. Claw of Inspec
tor Gadget. This transformation is done
by the reconstructive surgeon we are well
acquainted with as the eye-guy from
"Blade Runner."

The movie is full ol loopholes, and the
most amusement I derived from watching
jt came from pondering these questions
With a friend (in Beavis and Butt-head
voices, of course). For example
Why. if the first shot of the movie is of
the Golden (late Bridge* does everyone
seems to have Australian accents? Well,
maybe Australian actors arc cheaper. Or
maybe it's a rip-off of Mad Max.
How does Rebecca, the tank girl, man
age to keep her eyebrows plucked to a bare

Tank Girl

minimum and her skimpy wardrobe
changed in every scene even though she
has to beg at one point even to go to the
bathroom?
Isn't driving a tank and drinking marti
nis at the same time kind of, huh- huh,
dangerous? !
Would kiiier-kangaroo people really
have enormous libidos and suck nitrous
(otherwise known as whip-its)?
And finally, if the earth is .suffering an
enormous water shortage (due to a colli
sion with a comet), how come beer is in
such high supply?
So, if'you want your brain to beconv.
mush (or it t'eels like th.it already), don t
hesitate to sec "Tank Girl." Hut make sure
you, huh-huh, do some cool mind-alter
ing substances first.
