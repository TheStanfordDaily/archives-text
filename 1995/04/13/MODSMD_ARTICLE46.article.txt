# Smells stupid: Teens take to the air on KZSU
## 
### Sangeetha Ramanujam 
For most of us, the world of high school
— though it now seems to have existed
in a completely different era — is still
firmly entrenched in our memory. Govern
ment class, SAT scores, starting to think
about colleges and careers, U.S. history,
extra-curricular activities, getting a driver's
license — sound familiar? Sam Anderson,
Lindsey Liberatore, Sasha Dinwiddie, Megan
Louwerse and Zane Ashman are five
teenagers who are no different, and yet they
are doing something I doubt many of us did
in high school.
They have produced a unique program
called "The Stupid Teenager Show" on
KZSU, Stanford's student-run radio station.
With a combination of skits, interviews,
news briefs and music, they have created the
only forum on the air for high-school expres
sion. Given the freedom to create their show,
the teens do it with talent, creativity, and off
the-wall humor.
This wacky disposition is evident in the
name of the program which the creators se
lected. When trying to recall how they
reached this decision, Louwerse remem
bered, "We were driving someone home and

someone said that people are going to think
we're just a bunch of stupid teenagers. So we
decided to call it The Stupid Teenager Show.'
The program is the brain child of Stanford
alum Ali Salomon, who first developed it
after working on a KZSU radio show called
"Keep Your Head Up," another production
for a younger audience. "I wanted to do
something like that with a slightly older audi
ence," she said. She allows the students to
freely determine the format and content of
"The Stupid Teenager Show." "We have a half
hour and they can fill it in whatever way they
wish."
The creators choose to fill their allotted
time with skits that they write themselves, in
terviews with members of the community,
discussions and other methods of relaying is
sues that are pertinent to teens. They also
choose their own music to complement the
program.
Their show sometimes borders what they
themselves call "the edge of obscenity."
Humor can also be seen in other shows: re
cently, they did a spoof of the O.J. Simpson
trials. Still, there are limits for these high
schoolers — they considered mocking reli
gion for Easter but finally decided not to. "We
get together and feed ideas off of each other
until they become so ridiculous that we drop
them," Anderson explained.
"The Stupid Teenager Show," however, is
not nonsensical. All of the members exam
ine, in his or her own way, issues that are rel
evant to teens. They have, for example, ad
dressed topics such as abortion, commercial
radio and teen homelessness.
"They're very controversial," Salomon
added with a slight grin as the students relat
ed instances where listeners had called in to
voice complaints. But all jests aside, they ad
mitted that very few people probably tune in.
"Oh, maybe two," Anderson remarked with
out any sign of annoyance or embarrass
ment.
None of them seems to find this fact
daunting. "It doesn't really bother me," Ash
man said. "I'm doing this more for myself."
Other group members strongly echo this sen
timent — they are producing the program so
that they have a chance to voice their opinions

and to do something they enjoy
doing. All of these students
have had long-term interests in
broadcasting or drama and are
considering the fields as possi
ble career choices.
Working on "The Stu
pid Teenager Show"
provides them with
the opportunity to pursue
their interests and develop
skills that can be used later on
in life. Salomon added that
they are learning to put togeth
er most of the show them
selves. "1 really wanted to give
people the opportunity to
learn more about the radio."
"We're also doing it for the
college application," Dinwiddie
added jokingly.
All of these teenagers are
from Gunn High School in Palo
Alto. They've been working on
the show since it started in late
January. Dinwiddie described
the group dynamic by saying,
"I just feed off of everyone
else." Anderson added quickly,

"We all feed off of each other." Dinwiddie, like
other members of the group, is naturally suit
ed to the show. He does much of the technical
work and has an interest in music that is so
great that "(If I weren't doing this], I'd just sit
around at home, mixing music anyway."
Louwerse, a junior, recently moved from
Palo Alto to Larkspur, hut she still drives in
for meetings and rehearsals. She also does
technical work and sketches for the show. "I
look at the things going on around me and
use them for my ideas." Liberatore prefers to
do interviews and news briefs. For example,
she interviewed an attorney to get his views
on the O.J. trial for their show on Simpson.
She also criticized the excessive coverage that
Palo Alto High School receives compared
with Gunn
Anderson and Ashman are also both Ju
niors. Anderson is the dramatist of the group.
Ashman admits that he has done a few inter
views, but "that's not really me." He prefers to
do skits and random sketches. It is clear from
talking to both students that they are the
source of much of the show's wacky humor.
The group came together when Salomon
explained her idea to their history teacher and
asked which students might be interested in
putting together a show. The students work
about 10 hours on each 30 minute program,

both in meetings where they develop ideas
and in actual production. The Stupid Teenag
er show airs every other Monday at 6 p.m., al
ternating with "Keep Your Head Up," the
show with which Salomon was first involved.
The group forms a rather tight-knit cir
cle. All the students admit that it is dif
ficult for others to join them and feel
completely comfortable. But perhaps they
work so well together because of this close
friendship and their varied talents.
Throughout the interview, this cama
raderie was evident with their climbing trees
for photos, their contemplating tying some
one up in head phones for a creative shot,
their discussing their classes and teachers and
their general distraction and joking around;
in short, they acted like "typical" teenagers.
But these students are hardly ordinary. "I
think it's neat that we're doing something that
most teenagers don't get to do," Louwerse re
marked.
Anderson immediately answered "most
teenagers don't play football either." That
might be true, but these teens are displaying
their originality with something more unusu
al than playing a sport. With humor and cre
ativity, they have produced something much
more inventive and much more interesting.
