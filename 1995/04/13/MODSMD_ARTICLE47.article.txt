Bye Bye Love
"Bye Bye Love" revolves
around a trio of best friends who are
all divorced dads (Matthew Modine,
Randy Quaid and Paul Reiser) as
each tries to be a part of his kids'
lives even though they are no longer
a full-time family.
The comedy / sentiment for
mula is a familiar one but it's rarely
done this well. We've seen it all be
fore — maybe because it's stuff that
actually happens. "Bye Bye Love"
seems genuine. Deft handling of fa
miliar situations evokes sympathy
for these typical guys who seem to
have typical problems. I doubt you'll
hear of "Bye Bye Love" next Oscar
season, but it may be in the running
for "feel-good movie of the year."
Circle of Friends
Focusing on the intertwining
lives of three Irish women attending
college in Dublin, "Circle of Friends"

offers an intriguing look at late-1950s
Ireland and the strong influence of
the Catholic Church in daily life.
After spending their child
hood years in a boring small town,
Benny (Minnie Driver) and her friend
Eve (Geraldine O Rawe) are eager
to experience the grown-up plea
sures of university and city life. On
their first day of school, the pair
bumps into childhood friend Nan
(Saffron Burrows), who has become
quite the socialite. The trio stays
close throughout the film as they
search for true love.
While the movie is excellent,
it is not perfect. By avoiding Nan's
predicament, "Circle" is able to end
on a high note with its positive
theme intact: True love will outlast
any obstacle — even the stringent
Catholic Church.
Jefferson in Paris
One comes away from Mer

chant-Ivory's latest outing with not
emotional engagement or psycho
logical challenge but images over
saturated with the artifice of set and
costume design, which places a dis
proportionate demand on the pro
duction's energies, leaving its char
acterizations pitifully malnourished.
Set in the years 1784 to 1789
in Paris, Lafayette and Versailles
where Jefferson (Nick Nolte) served
as the U.S. ambassador to the Louis
XVI court, the film celebrates the lib
ertarian ideals of the widowed author
of the Declaration of Independence.
Jefferson pays particular attention to
a ravishing but married woman,
Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), al
though he later finds himself drawn
instead to his 15-year-old slave Sally
Hemings (Thandie Newton).
Despite one saving grace in
the intricately-etched figure of Jeffer
son's willful daughter Patsy
(Gwyneth Paltrow) it is apparent that

the Disneyfication of Merchant-
Ivory's heritage act has taken out a
whole lot of subtle candor and re
placed it with an endless parade of
fetishized pomp.
Losing Isaiah
Halle Berry stars as an
African-American mother named
Kailah who mistakenly leaves her
baby in a dumpster when she is
high on crack but is forever haunted
by the guilt of her baby's supposed
death. Only after discovering that
her child survived does she resolve
to completely reform and gain cus
tody of her son, Isaiah, played by
newcomer Marc John Jeffries.
"Losing Isaiah" captures the
viewer's interest with great perfor
mances by Jessica Lange and
Berry. But its downfall is banal lines.
In addition, the contrived ending
seems unrealistic after the previous
conflicts between Lange and Berry.
