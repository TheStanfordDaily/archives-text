## Kristie Lü Stout Earth to Planet Hollywood: Get some real food 
### 
Arnold Schwarzenegger is out to get me. I
know it.
I'm not shittin you here. He and his freak
ing horde of celluloid-processed, soloflexed
Hollywood junkies are out to play Zimbardo
with my mind and ... numb my taste buds.
1 ate at Planet Hollywood® and all I
brought back was this lousy column.
Arnold, Bruce, Sylvester et al. are the fascist
restaurateurs / conspirators of this pseudo
eatery. Yes mon ami, Planet Hollywood® is,
supposedly, a restaurant. But get real.
Planet Hollywood® is the narcissistic
brainchild of a So Cal clique whose members
thought it would be soooooo, like, cool
whipped to exhibit their Hollywood status in
a so-called restaurant so that aaaaaaaall the lit
tle people would point and smile and coo and
bat their Maybellined lashes at aaaaall the Hol
lywood paraphernalia on display... while
choking on their degenerate ground chuck
burgers.

Ahem.
Upon entering PH® (after a one-hour
wait), I was immediately assaulted by a multi
tude of video monitors, neon signs, auto
graphed film stills and a pouty Marilyn Mon
roe impersonator who, when turning around
to escort me to my seat, flicked her Nice & Eas
ied blonde locks into my left eye. Bitch.
Next to my booth was an immortalized
napkin framed in chrome. Nicole Kidman had
left a juicy Red No. 2 smooch on the exalted
three-ply sheet. "Wow." But wait! There's
more! While sipping my Pretty in Pink® (an
inappropriately named cocktail that tasted
like a blend of grenadine, Kiwi Strawberry
Snapple and Mocha Mix), 1 actually saw —
with my very own optic orbs — a hound
stoothed suit that Sammy Davis once per
spired in while doing the watusi!
I saw the gun from Ray Liotta's unforget
table magnum opus "No Escape." I saw a life
sized authentic copy of the replica of Amies

robo-hunk alter-ego from "T2"... genuine
vinyl jacket included. I saw the heel of the shoe
that Munchkin No. 65 wore in that one movie
where the color changes and the trees get pre
menstrual on a certain wandering little girl. I
saw a dress that this one really famous actress
wore to portray another really famous actress
in a movie I watched in a 3 a.m.-induced stu
por on USA Up All Night.
I forget what I ordered.
The entertainment industry just ain't satis
fied with the mere domination of media, mar
keting merchandise and the intellects of pre
teens. It wants more. So, it's going straight for
the esophagus; show hi/, has infiltrated the
food biz. Now, Arnieet al. ain't the only group
of glam restaurateurs / conspirators. Spiel
berg and fellow Dream Worker Jeffrey K. are
the masterminds behind Dive!, another glitzy
pseudo-restaurant. And then there's the soon
to-serve-those-who-actually-do-eat Fashion
Cafe, brought to you by Elle, Naomi and Clau-

dia (three cat-waJkin' chicks who claim to
know about service with a smile).
Wait. Wait. Wait. Something really twisted
this way comes. Cafes run by models?!? Sip
ping a cocktail called Pretty in Pink®?!?
Going out to eat has transformed into an
opportunity to cower under the in-jokes and
trophies of the richer-than-thou and the so
called fabulous. Originally aimed to seduce
the tongue, the restaurant has morphed into a
gigantic Plato's Cave amusement-park ride.
Instead of lapping up a decent dinner at the
local hole-in-the-wall, we consume hyper
sentimental film scores, images of movie-sets
and special-effect stunts and glamorous
fuschia feather boas that once tickled Mari
lyn's thyroid at Planet Hollywood®. As we
consume these representations of glam and
glitz at PH® with pathetically wide-eyed con
sumer gullibility, we fall for image over sub
stance, fashion over fettucine.
All I wanted was a lousy chicken sandwich.
