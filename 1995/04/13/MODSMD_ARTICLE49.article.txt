■ Go behind the scenes and down the
rabbit hole of American politics circa
1995 with Norman Solomon's "Adven
tures In Cllntonland." This multi-layered
show is about the best and brightest baby

ton era. Called "one of the fiercest and most

rosa realities from Washington to San Francis
co. Playing at The Marsh on 1062 Valencia

■ "More than Words"
are all the words I
know of to describe
the band Extreme,

for a thrasher band.

$18.50. Get tickets
through by calling Bass.

■ Mike Noren is an
Intermission writer.
His favorite color is
blue. His favorite
group is Guided by
Voices. He likes
them a lot. They are
playing at the Great
American Music Hall at
9 p.m. on 859 O'Far
rell. He likes that

place. Tickets are $8. That's not too expensive.
He'll be there. Will you? Call 885-0750 for infor
mation.
■ Scared of heights? If not, then try out
William Garnett's "Aerial Photographs" at the
Vision Gallery on 1155 Mission Street in SF.
For almost 50 years, Garnett has been making
photographs from the air, shooting out the
window of his small plane as he pilots himself
high above the earth. A pioneer in the field of
aerial photography, Garnett was the first to
demonstrate that it has aesthetic potential. At
age 77, he is still flying and photographing (I
hope I'm still flying at that age). Gallery hours
are Monday through Saturday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Call 621-2107.
rUES/18
■ Do you remember "King of the Wild
Frontier?" Me neither, but It was one of
Adam Ant's big hits. It sounds cool. Maybe
I'll listen to it in preparation for his 8 p.m. show
at the Fillmore in San Francisco. Gosh, that
should be great. General admission tickets are
$16.50. I'm going to call Bass at (510) 762-
BASS for more information. Hope I'm not on

hold for too long.
■ Speaking of junior high, we've got arts
and crafts galore. Check out the Arts and
Crafts Fair and International Festival at
San Francisco State University. Over 75 ar
tisans, importers and craftspersons will be rep
resented in this fair which will be held on SFS's
Main Lawn from Monday through Thursday,
from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. And its free! International
music and dance will be presented daily at
noon. Call 338-2444 for info.
WED/19
■ It's back to Josie's Cabaret and Juice
Joint for more riotous and eye-opening
shows, tonight it's "Basic Black, A Dishy
Discourse." This piece is a heaping platter of
severe satire, scintillating stories and appropri
ate fashion put on by Brian Freeman of Pomo
Afro Homos and Terrence Smith of "Late Night
with Joan Jett Black" fame. It is a none-too-de
mure evening of ready-to-wear comedy and
tasteful performance directed by Tony Kelly.
$10 for tickets to the 8 p.m. show. Call 861 -
7933. Josie's is located on 3583 16th Street at
Market.
