# MEChA upset by ruling on grapes
## Group will discuss further action 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Members of the group central to
bringing grapes into the forefront
of last year's campus politics ex
pressed their disappointment yes
terday at the administration's deci
sion not to support the boycott of
grapes.
"President Casper's response to
the Grape Committee's policy rec
ommendation. . .comes as an obvi
ous and great disappointment,"
Stanford's Chicano / Latino stu
dent group, MEChA, said in a
statement.
University President Gerhard
Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice released a statement yester
day announcing that the adminis
tration would not support a Uni
versity-wide boycott.
The administration statement
also said the University would not
follow a recommendation by the
Grape Policy Committee to allow
both individual residences and ad
ministrative units to decide
whether or not to boycott.
Instead, the current policy
which allows dorms to make the de
cision — but not administrative
units — will be continued. The
president and provost promised
more support for educating stu
dents about their decisions on the
issue.
The Grape Policy Committee

was formed last year in response to
a hunger strike by students calling
for the boycott, among other de
mands. The committee has since
researched the issue and reported
to Casper in February.
The decision not to follow the
committee's recommendation was
even more of a disappointment be
cause "over the past nine months,
MEChA has participated and con
tributed significantly to the work
of the Grape Policy Committee,"
the group's statement said.
Further discussion is still need
ed, the statement said.
"The decision touches on a mul
titude of recurring issues and con
cerns for our community,"
MEChA's statement said. "In
order to properly respond to the
president's final decision on the
grape policy proposal, it is neces
sary to allow time to inform our
community on the impact of this
decision."
Javier Ruiz, a resident assistant
in Casa Zapata, the Chicano / Lati
no theme house, said he was hop
ing for a University-wide boycott
but realized it was unrealistic.
"We've talked about this before
... and we all agreed that no mat
ter what they would say that
Casper wasn't going to take it,"he
said.
"Honestly," he added, "Casper
wasn't going to give [the boycott]
to us even if the committee had
recommended it."
Civil Engineering Prof. Jim
Leckie, who has done research on
the effects of pesticides on workers
on grape farms, said "I'm not sur
prised that that was their determi
nation."
Although several studies have
determined that pesticides harm
the health of workers, many of
whom are Chicano and Latino,
Casper and Rice argued "that
there were insufficient supporting
data indicating adverse effects of

pesticides on workers," Leckie
said.
"There have been very few
studies," he said. "Several of them
have been flawed, so they're incon
clusive.
However, "the [studies] with
larger data sets indicated a higher
probability of [a negative] effect,"
he said. "What we do know is that
of the studies that are credible, the
effects are adverse."
Leckie, who picked grapes dur
ing his childhood, said if he had
family in the grape fields, he
would want to take the "conser
vative approach" and trust the
few studies. But, he added, "on
the other hand, it is a political
issue."
The administration's statement

said a University-wide boycott
would be inappropriate because
Stanford should not get involved
with a political issue such as the
treatment of workers on grape
farms.
MEChA's statement said the
group plans to discuss the issue
with the Chicano / Latino commu
nity in the next few days. "We will
continue to educate the Stanford
community and support the plight
of farm workers as many members
of our community and their fami
lies are directly affected by harm
ful pesticide use and inhumane
labor practices," the statement
said.
Ruiz said he hopes dorms will
continue to support the boycott
and that it will expand as an issue

for the entire campus.
"A lot of people have said the
Chicano community sees it as only
a Chicano issue," Ruiz said. "It's
not an issue like that. It's a health
issue If they realize that, then
maybe they'll realize it's a human
issue, that people are dying
because of this."
In its response, MEChA also
complained about Casper's timing
in releasing his response.
"Although the president has
had the recommendation of the
committee for over two months,"
the statement said, "a final deci
sion on the issue was not made
until the eve of the special-fee cam
paign."
MEChA members declined to
elaborate on the statement.
