# MEChA upset by ruling on grapes
## Group will discuss further action 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Members of the group central to
bringing grapes into the forefront
of last year's campus politics ex
pressed their disappointment yes
terday at the administration's deci
sion not to support the boycott of
grapes.
"President Casper's response to
the Grape Committee's policy rec
ommendation. . .comes as an obvi
ous and great disappointment,"
Stanford's Chicano / Latino stu
dent group, MEChA, said in a
statement.
University President Gerhard
Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice released a statement yester
day announcing that the adminis
tration would not support a Uni
versity-wide boycott.
The administration statement
also said the University would not
follow a recommendation by the
Grape Policy Committee to allow
both individual residences and ad

which allows dorms to make the de

units — will be continued. The
president and provost promised
more support for educating stu

issue.
The Grape Policy Committee

was formed last year in response to
a hunger strike by students calling
for the boycott, among other de
mands. The committee has since
researched the issue and reported
to Casper in February.
The decision not to follow the
committee's recommendation was
even more of a disappointment be
cause "over the past nine months,
MEChA has participated and con
tributed significantly to the work
of the Grape Policy Committee,"
the group's statement said.
Further discussion is still need
ed, the statement said.
"The decision touches on a mul
titude of recurring issues and con
cerns for our community,"
MEChA's statement said. "In
order to properly respond to the
president's final decision on the
grape policy proposal, it is neces
sary to allow time to inform our
community on the impact of this
decision."
Javier Ruiz, a resident assistant
in Casa Zapata, the Chicano / Lati
no theme house, said he was hop
ing for a University-wide boycott
but realized it was unrealistic.
"We've talked about this before
... and we all agreed that no mat
ter what they would say that
Casper wasn't going to take it,"he
said.
"Honestly," he added, "Casper
