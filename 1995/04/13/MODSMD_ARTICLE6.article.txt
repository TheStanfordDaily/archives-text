### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
In a reorganization of residen
tial administrators, Diana Con
klin has been appointed to the po
sition of manager of undergradu
ate residential facilities.
Conklin, the former associate
director of Residential Education,
replaces Lynn Glick, who is now
the Escondido manager of residen
tial facilities. Glick will now work
with capital improvements.
Conklin's new duties include
overseeing about 80 undergradu
ate residences and ensuring that
they are safe, clean, comfortable

and support the residential mis
sion.
According to Conklin, the posi
tion of associate director for Res
Ed will be "empty for a while."
Currently, her former duties are
being redispersed by Ann Porteus,
acting director of Res Ed, until the
ongoing search for a permanent
director is completed.
For Conklin, the new position
— which she assumed on Monday
— is more of a step sideways. She
said that she has been serving as a
liaison to residential facilities for
the past three years
