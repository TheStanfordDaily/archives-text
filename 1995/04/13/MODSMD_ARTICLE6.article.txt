## 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
In a reorganization of residen
tial administrators, Diana Con
klin has been appointed to the po
sition of manager of undergradu
ate residential facilities.
Conklin, the former associate
director of Residential Education,
replaces Lynn Glick, who is now
the Escondido manager of residen
tial facilities. Glick will now work
with capital improvements.
Conklin's new duties include
overseeing about 80 undergradu
ate residences and ensuring that
they are safe, clean, comfortable

and support the residential mis
sion.
According to Conklin, the posi
tion of associate director for Res
Ed will be "empty for a while."
Currently, her former duties are
being redispersed by Ann Porteus,
acting director of Res Ed, until the
ongoing search for a permanent
director is completed.
For Conklin, the new position
— which she assumed on Monday
— is more of a step sideways. She
said that she has been serving as a
liaison to residential facilities for
the past three years
When she saw the position
open, she said the "whole new
thing was tremendously exciting."
"I've worked extensively in
Housing and Dining," Conklin
said, adding that she has devel
oped a tremendous respect for the
job the department does.
In working with undergradu
ate residences, Conklin said she
will be in charge of the supervi
sors who lead the custodians. In
addition, she will be involved with
upcoming dormitory renovations,

she said.
Her most important duty, how
ever, will be to lend her support
and commitment to Res Ed's mis
sion in dorms, she said.
This will include discussing
problems and maintaining con
tact with students, resident assis
tants and resident fellows.
For example, Conklin said, if a
dormitory had an untuned piano
and a concert pianist, she would
be responsible for having the
piano tuned more quickly. Along
the same lines, she added that if a
group of students liked to study in
a particular room, she would
make sure that the room was well
lit and heated.
