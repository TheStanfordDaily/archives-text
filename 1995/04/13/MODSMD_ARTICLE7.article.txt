# Jim Mather: The karate legend continues
## 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
Jim Mather is faster than a
speeding arrow.
While attending Stanford in
the '70s, Mather appeared on the
TV show "That's Incredible" to
catch arrows in mid-air. These
days, Mather is still just as quick
on his feet.
Last month, Mather and five
students from his California
Karate Academy attended the
karate team trials for the Pan-
American Games in Colorado
Springs. Eighty of the most elite
karate athletes in America were
invited to attend. "You have to be
qualified through objective
means. At this level, people can
get seriously hurt," Mather said.
Although none of his students
made the team, Mather said he
believes they have a good chance
of qualifying at the trials —
which are at the end of the
month — for another prestigious
competition, the Pan-American
Karate Championships.
After serving in the Korean
War, Mather decided to return to
school in 1970, first attending
San Jose City College and then
transferring to Stanford his ju
nior year. "The first quarter was
tough. I kept at it, though. I had
lots of support from my wife and

family," he said.
Because of his reflex ability,
Mather kept himself busy as the
goalie coach for the Stanford
water polo team, helping nation
al champions such as Chris

Dorst. He also wrote a national
newsletter, "Speed Enhance
ment," that dealt with develop
ing faster reflexes.
Eventually, Mather graduat
ed with a bachelor's degree in

communication and a master's in
physical education. He continued
to study toward a doctorate in ed
ucation but became too busy
teaching and coaching.
