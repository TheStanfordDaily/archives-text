# Jim Mather: The karate legend continues
## 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
Jim Mather is faster than a
speeding arrow.
While attending Stanford in
the '70s, Mather appeared on the
TV show "That's Incredible" to
catch arrows in mid-air. These
days, Mather is still just as quick
on his feet.
Last month, Mather and five
students from his California
Karate Academy attended the
karate team trials for the Pan-
American Games in Colorado
Springs. Eighty of the most elite
karate athletes in America were
invited to attend. "You have to be
qualified through objective
means. At this level, people can
get seriously hurt," Mather said.
Although none of his students
made the team, Mather said he
believes they have a good chance
of qualifying at the trials —
which are at the end of the
month — for another prestigious
competition, the Pan-American
Karate Championships.
After serving in the Korean
War, Mather decided to return to
school in 1970, first attending
San Jose City College and then
transferring to Stanford his ju
nior year. "The first quarter was
tough. I kept at it, though. I had
lots of support from my wife and

family," he said.
Because of his reflex ability,
Mather kept himself busy as the
goalie coach for the Stanford
water polo team, helping nation
al champions such as Chris

Dorst. He also wrote a national
newsletter, "Speed Enhance
ment," that dealt with develop
ing faster reflexes.
Eventually, Mather graduat
ed with a bachelor's degree in

communication and a master's in
physical education. He continued
to study toward a doctorate in ed
ucation but became too busy
teaching and coaching.

Stanford alum Jim Mather, renowned for his reflexes, works with one of his karate students.
Mather said he didn't start off
being successful. "I grew up in
the poor part of town, in East
San Jose. I was small for my age
and insecure. I lacked direction."
He attributes his personal
growth to his training in the
martial arts. "Karate gave me
the discipline and inner
strength."
In 1955, before coming to
Stanford, Mather met his
instructor, Hironishi, who intro
duced him to karate. "I guess he
needed someone to beat on,"
Mather laughed. The pair
trained together until Hironishi
went back to Japan a few years
later.
Mather entered the service to
fight in the Korean War and
was able to keep training in
Korea. He founded the Califor
nia Karate Academy after he

came back in 1961 to teach a
technique unheard of in those
days, and continued to run the
school even while attending
Stanford.
"In those days, not many peo
ple had heard of karate. There
was only judo," Mather said,
explaining that karate is both a
physical and spiritual discipline
originating from Japan. "There
were only a handful of schools
around the country."
The quality of teachers, how
ever, was excellent. Mather
remembered a star-studded
karate tournament in 1965 in
San Jose. "Bruce Lee had a
school in Oakland. Chuck Nor
ris drove up with his school.
And Takyuki Kubotai, who
taught the FBI, the L.A. police
and Elvis Presley, was there
too, he said."
His experiences finally con
vinced Mather to go back to
school. "If you keep putting it
off, the next thing you know,
you're 50 and your life has gone

by," Mather said. "Also, I had
the self-confidence I didn't have
when I was younger."
Mather has taught thousands
of students over the years and
presently has several branch
schools in the Bay Area. He also
has special programs for senior
citizens, at-risk children, self
defense for women and people
with disabilities.
"Recently, I worked with
young males with spinal cord
injuries. Many were active risk
takers before the accident. Now
they are totally vulnerable. Two
thousand years ago, karate
helped people defend themselves
from external dangers. Today,
karate helps people combat
inner problems. It can help peo
ple achieve their ultimate capa
bilities, " Mather said.
Mather said teaching has
been a rewarding career. "I have
files of letters from people who
say that karate turned their lives
around. I take that responsibili
ty very seriously."
