# Having their day in court
## Bldg. 10 prowlers plead guilty; Betas get new date 
### Gabriela Teodorescu Contributing writer 
The six Stanford students who allegedly broke in to
campus buildings over spring vacation had their day in
court yesterday. Two students pleaded guilty to tres
passing, while the other four declined to enter pleas.
The two suspects who plead guilty in the March 29
president's office break-in — junior Jose Alcorta and
senior Clark Bailey, both physics majors — entered
Building 10 through Building 60 and were caught by
police when they tripped an alarm.
Santa Clara County Judge Eugene Hyman asked
the two students what they were doing above the Quad.
"We don't really know," Bailey said.
"Just exploring," Alcorta added.
"We heard that if you go up there, there are neat
things to see," Bailey said.
Hyman then asked the students to sit down because
he wished to talk about the sentencing with Santa
Clara County Deputy District Attorney Tim Pitsker.
"We don't like to see Stanford students in here, be
cause they have an opportunity that so few people do,"
Hyman said. "We are a bit shocked to see good people do
stupid things.
"I can see that neither of you were there to steal," he
added.
Once the judge explained the circumstances to
them, both Alcorta and Bailey pleaded guilty to tres-
passing, were placed on informal
probation and received a sentence
of 100 hours of community service.
The judge explained to them
that since the charge is a misde
meanor, it will not be placed on
their permanent records. Never
theless, the charge will still show
on records if either of the men
want a job with security clearance
or any profession requiring a
license.
If Alcorta and Bailey do not ful

fill their sentences they could face
up to six months in jail and a
$1,000 fme.
Also yesterday morning, four
Stanford students connected to the
alleged Stanford Art Museum
break-in were arraigned. None of
the students — seniors Matthew
Bengard and Jacob Kuramoto and
sophomores Timothy Kutzkey and
Alejandro Quezeda — entered
pleas.
1994 graduate Jos6 Farias —
who has also been charged in con
nection with the break-in — did
not appear at the hearing.
Pitsker, who is also prosecuting
the break-in, joked with the judge

that Farias, who did not return
from Minnesota, should be shipped
back in chains. "They shouldn't
have given him a diploma," he said.
The police currently have a war
rant out for Farias' arrest because
he did not sign a release guarantee
ing his appearance in court.
Commenting on the absence of
Farias, Hyman said, "The problem
is that until he gets back from Min
nesota, [the other four suspects]
will all point the finger at him."
Because Bengard and Kutzkey
did not have attorneys, Hyman set
a new court date for April 18. All
the students were released on their
own recognizance.
