Iraq may sell oil
UNITED NATIONS (AP)
— The United States and its
allies yesterday offered Iraq a
plan to let it sell oil to buy
food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its
people.
The U.N. Security Council
was expected to vote on the
proposal today.
Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq
Aziz, who is in New York, was
consulting with his govern
ment on whether it would
accept terms of the draft reso
lution, a British diplomat said
on condition of anonymity.
The plan aims to deflect
criticism that ordinary Iraqis
are suffering from U.N. eco
nomic sanctions in place since
Saddam Hussein's army
invaded Kuwait in August
1990.
The oil sale proposal,
backed by the United States,
Britain, Argentina and Oman,
would let Iraq export $2 billion
worth of oil over 180 days
despite U.N. sanctions.
Iraq rejected a similar pro
posal in 1991 saying the condi
tions infringed on its
sovereignty.
The new proposal would
allow oil exports to continue as
long as U.N. monitors certify
that Iraq is ensuring "equi
table" distribution of the sup

plies to its 18 million people.
Harvard explanation
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP)
— The student whose admis
sion to Harvard was rescinded
after the school learned she had
killed her mother was rejected
for lying about the crime during
an admissions interview,
sources said yesterday.
Gina Grant, 19, claimed dur
ing the interview with a Har
vard alumnus last year that her
mother had died in a car acci
dent, according to sources
involved in the admissions pro
cess. The sources spoke on con
dition of anonymity.
After learning that Grant's
mother was actually blud
geoned to death with a candle
stick, Harvard on April 3
rescinded its offer of admission.
Harvard spokesman Joe
Wrinn declined again yesterday
to comment on the case.
The application asks
whether a student ever has
been on probation. Grant said
no; in fact, she was on proba
tion until age 18 after pleading
no contest to killing her mother
in 1990.
Grant's mother, 42-year-old
Dorothy Mayfield, was blud
geoned at least 13 times with a
lead crystal candle holder and a
carving knife was plunged
through her neck.
