# Court allows Faulkner to drill at Citadel

CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -
An appeals court cleared the way
yesterday for Shannon Faulkner
to become the first woman to take
part in military training at The
Citadel, unless the school comes
up with military-style education
for women by the fall.
A panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals panel agreed
that South Carolina's all-male
military college violated Faulkn
er's rights under the equal protec
tion clause of the 14th Amend
ment in refusing to admit her.
The 2-1 decision upheld an
order last July by U.S. District
Judge C. Weston Houck, who
ended 151 years of all-male mili
tary education at the Charleston
school.
Faulkner has been attending
classes at The Citadel since Jan

uary 1994 under an order from
Houck but had not been allowed
to take part in military training
or wear a uniform while the case
was being appealed.
The appeals court ordered the
school to admit Faulkner to the
corps of cadets in August unless it
can come up with an alternative
plan to give women military-style
education by then.
But the panel also said it was
unlikely the school could have
such a plan ready by the fall,
when Faulkner will be a junior.
Cadets cannot begin the program
after their junior year.
"We're basically where we
were last summer, playing beat
the clock again," said Faulkner, a
20-year-old sophomore. "I'm very
optimistic about getting in, it's
just how are things going to work

out."
The Citadel's lawyer, Dawes
Cooke, said school officials have
been working on an alternative
plan.
"I like to think we're in good
position to meet the court's
requirements" to have a plan in
place by August, he said.
South Carolina Attorney Gen
eral Charlie Condon said the state
will move ahead with the alterna
tive program and won't immedi
ately appeal the order.
"We're pleased with the deci
sion. It says very clearly that sin
gle-gender education is constitu
tional ... it's just that you have to
have a substantively comparable
program," he said.
Faulkner applied to The
Citadel in 1993 after having her
high school guidance counselor

delete references to her sex on her
transcript. The college accepted
her, then rejected her after learn
ing she is a woman.
Faulkner sued in 1993, claim
ing the school's all-male policy
amounted to sex discrimination
and Houck agreed.
The Citadel argued during a
trial last May that staying all
male was not discrimination but
part of a state policy of offering a
variety of choices in higher educa
tion. The school also said there
was no demand by women for a
Citadel-type education.
The Citadel and Virginia Mili
tary Institute in Lexington, Va.,
are the only state-supported all
male military colleges in the
nation and both schools have
been sued by the Justice Depart
ment over their policies.
