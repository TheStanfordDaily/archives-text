# Japanese police try to catch cult members

### 
TOKYO (AP) — After weeks of moving cau
tiously, police threw a wide dragnet around
Japan yesterday to find the leaders of a cult sus
pected in the deadly nerve gas attacks on
Tokyo's subways.
At least 20,000 officers fanned out to search
cars at roadblocks, while the coast guard checked
boats leaving the country. Police in Tokyo went
on "emergency alert" over fears cult followers
might launch an attack this weekend.
In a book released last month, cult leader
Shoko Asahara predicted a disaster in Tokyo this
weekend. Police patrolled the city's most crowd
ed neighborhoods and its government district
yesterday in case cult members interpreted the

prediction as a sign to do damage.
According to police sources, sect followers
have telephoned their families and told them to
be careful in the next few days and there are
rumors in the sect that sarin — the nerve gas
used in the subways — may be scattered in a
Tokyo nightclub district, the Kyodo News Ser
vice reported.
Police have arrested more than 70 cult mem
bers on a variety of pretexts since the March 20
subway attack that killed 11 people, sickened
5,500 and stunned a nation that had thought
itself free from terrorism.
Now, however, police apparently believe they
have enough evidence to arrest most of the top

figures of the Aum Shinri Kyo sect.
Across the nation, police mobilized about
20,000 officers at 1,000 checkpoints, according
to Yomiuri, Japan's highest circulation daily.
Kyodo put the number of police at 30,000.
Police also planned raids this weekend at
more than 110 cult facilities and "hiding places,"
Kyodo said. Asahara and other top leaders of the
sect have dropped out of sight, although follow
ers say Asahara is still in Japan.
Police would not comment on any of the
reports.
The cult denies involvement and says the tons
of chemicals seized in weeks of raids on its facili
ties were for making fertilizer, not nerve gas.
