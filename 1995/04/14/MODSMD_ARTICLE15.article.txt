## Editorials Partying professors 
### 
THE ONLY TIME many stu
dents get to see faculty
members is in the class
room, or just maybe for a few
minutes during office hours.
For many faculty members,
seeing students means that they
will be called upon to work in
some manner, and it can be hard
to relax when students are
around.
It would be nice if there were a
different, more casual venue in
which professors and students
could interact. Fortunately, soci
ety has created the perfect event
for such interaction: the cocktail
party.
No place other than the cock
tail party is so perfectly created
for people from all stations to
meet, chat and have fun, without
worries of work or further
required social obligation. No
other event would give students
and faculty members the chance
to truly enjoy each other's com
pany, setting work aside for a few

hours to really get to know one
another.
We urge just such an event,
and propose the students take
the initiative.
Specifically, we urge the ASSU to
take some of its cash and do
something all students can use
and enjoy, for a change: throw a
student/teacher bash in the
Quad.
Of course, being Stanford it
wouldn't be your traditional
cocktail party. The ASSU would
have to serve EANABS. Heck, it
might all be EANABS. That is
beside the point. Let's not get
hung up on details of cocktail
weenies and proper dress.
The main point is to offer
undergraduates and graduate
students alike the chance to rub
elbows with their professors in a
new, casual fashion. And who
knows? Both sides might even
come out of the experience feel
ing refreshed and excited about
some new friends.
