WE'VE ALL complained
about it to our friends at
different schools — Palo
Alto sure isn't much of a college
town. In fact, it practically turns
into a ghost town after five p.m. So
instead, most Stanford students
have to search for amusement on
campus. But besides Stern late
night or the 24-hour study room in
Meyer, in the past people have had
nowhere to go after midnight.
UiUiLnom-.,...
In addition to debuting a new
feature — a gold couch — the Cof
fee House has responded to student
demand by extending its hours:
The Co Ho will remain open until 2
a.m. Tuesday through Friday
nights; the other three nights of
the week it will close at midnight as
usual. Still, this change will give
students a place both to socialize
and study until the wee hours of
the morning for most of the week.
Thanks is due to the Co Ho for giv

ing students what they want.
Changes extend beyond longer
hours, however: The Co Ho has
also expanded its menu to include
chicken wings and pizza, giving
students a convenient alternative
to food service to satisfy their late
night munchies. And the Co Ho has
also improved its lighting, which
should help the eyes of those stu
dents who can't work in complete
quiet. Moreover, the name for the
new promotion is derived from the
Co Ho's new furniture — three
couches that have replaced the
overcrowded upper tables, includ
ing a fantastic second-hand, bright
gold couch.
Although it had to close early one
night this week because of concerns
about the availability of bathrooms
after the rest of Tresidder closed at
midnight, the Co Ho has perma
nently changed for the better.
We may never get a Taco Bell,
but at least we have our Co Ho.
