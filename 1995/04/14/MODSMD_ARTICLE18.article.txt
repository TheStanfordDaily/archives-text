## Who needs common sense? 
### 
WE NEED more lawyers. Or
rather, we need more people
who understand the law and
laws that are more accessible to every
one.
There is a popular perception that we
have too many lawyers and too much lit
igation. The argument goes like this: We
have more lawyers per capita than any
other society in the world; therefore, we
must have drastic reform. By the same
reasoning: We have more guns per capi
ta than another society in the world, so
we should have at least mild gun control.
The argument against gun control based
on the Second Amendment is ironically
only another legal technicality. And the
oft-quoted Shakespeare line is meant as
a warning against, not an argument in
favor of, "killing all the lawyers."
Overseas, the number of lawyers is
distorted by the high proportion of peo
ple who study law but never pass the
bar. These individuals do not practice
law, strictly speaking, but nonetheless
perform services that would be handled
by attorneys in the United States.
Very few American attorneys practice
law in the sense that is imagined — by
trying cases. Many more attorneys per
form counseling that does not require a
legal background, competing with other
professionals.
People trained in law also leave it
altogether and venture into business,
government, consulting and academia.

Their legal training, like most profes
sional degrees, serves as a credential
more than anything else.
We have a distorted picture of the
civil caseload. Nobody cares about the
innumerable suits that are deterred by
cultural disapproval or never initiated
because of rational economic analysis by
the potential plaintiff or his attorney.
Few worry about the majority of cases
which settle without trial and the many
cases that result in judgments for the
defendants or meager awards to the
plaintiffs. Punitive damages are quite
rare, but they receive undue attention.
For example, of 1,800-plus cases filed
against tobacco companies over deaths
related to smoking, fewer than two
dozen have gone to trial, resulting in but
two plaintiffs' victories — and both were
reversed on appeal.
As de Tocqueville observed when the
nation was young, law fulfills an impor
tant role in America. A dynamic society
with interaction among different races
and cultures and rapid technological
progress must use formal dispute reso
lution more than a small community
that is homogenous and unchanging. It
is preferable that a civil judge and a jury
of peers replace churches, guilds and
community leaders, because we do not
belong to the same institutions and we
are not bound by the same informal
norms.
We do well collectively when each of

us individually stands up for his or her
rights. It is not accidental that the cul
ture of the trial lawyer is the culture of
the gunfighter. Our courtroom, with its
adversary system, presents ritualized
and stylized fighting as a spectator
sport. Courtroom language, manners
and posturing mimic behavior of the
frontier and the battlefield.
We simply demand too much, howev
er, from this system of abstractions
combined with procedures. The law
must provide an opportunity to plain
tiffs who have legitimate complaints,
without burdening defendants with
frivolous filings; it must be blind but
just, efficient but fair; it must compen
sate and deter without awarding wind
falls or punishing innocents. In any
given case, half the parties will conclude
that they have been done wrong.
The need for law will always increase,
but the law will remain contradictory,
difficult and garbled. Democracy forces
the law into impossibilities because of
the need for consensus and compromise.
The crisis arises not because we have a
legal system that allows people their
proverbial day in court, but because we
have so much injustice and so many real
problems.
