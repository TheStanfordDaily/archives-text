Casper makes political statement with no grape boycott

UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT Ger
hard Casper has rejected the
grape boycott under the pretense
that the University should not get
involved with politics. Please, President
Casper, do not insult our intelligence.
When you decide to support the status
quo, that is, indeed, a political state
ment. The Grape Policy Committee said
that "a University-wide boycott of
grapes is not justified." Isn't that a polit
ical statement?
Why not be honest? Aren't we in a
community where open, intelligent dis
course is valued? Come out and tell us
why you rejected the grape boycott.
Shall we speculate? You weighed the
likely campus turmoil (student protests,
hunger strikes, building occupations, et

cetera) against the "important institu
tional interests" of not offending the cor
porations and individual donors who
give funds to Stanford. The grape boy
cott issue is especially sensitive. It is a
clear example of oppressed people strug
gling, not for equality, but for the bare
essentials of life — yet dying for
marginally higher corporate profits. Uni
versities form a key link in the transfer
of power in society. Elite institutions
such as Stanford must train young peo
ple to accept the wrongs of the society
they will eventually control. You walk a
delicate line — between offending those
with real power or money and losing
control of the minds of the next genera
tion of leaders.
There is nothing that the "civilized"

(read "wealthy") community fears more
than that their children will wake up to
the inhumanity, the brutality, the sup
pression of the third world. They hope
for the imprisonment of the poor at
home instead of the opportunity to
receive an education which might prove
dangerous to the interests of investors.
Any intelligent human being who sees
the reality of our society can conclude
only one thing: that the concentrated
ownership of mass amounts of property
in the hands of a few inhumane institu
tions is not only immoral, it is not only
anti-human, but it is quite simply unac
ceptable.
What happens if this generation
refuses the bribes, refuses the plush job
offers, refuses to ignore the brutality of

the present economic system? The grape
boycott issue is just another example of
why the future economic system will not
work to increase profits — it will work to
improve the human condition. The nar
row-minded business leaders and
investors of today refuse to contemplate
an economic system that would be demo
cratic and just; they only think about
next quarter's investment returns,
regardless of whether another poor child
has to die for that extra one-half cent on
the share. We will no longer accept this
system, and so your job of balancing the
desires of Stanford donors and the awak
ening power of the students is likely to
only get harder, I'm afraid.
