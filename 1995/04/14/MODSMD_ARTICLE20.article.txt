# Daily wrongly stresses the negative aspects of Stanford fraternal life
## 
### 
The front-page article in The Daily on
April 11 called "The Rap on Frats" was
disappointingly lacking in substance. A
more appropriate title would have been
"The Crap on Frats." I was hoping that
the writer would share with us some
wonderful insights on fraternal life.
Instead, his article was filled with valid
but inconsequential observations which
he tried to relate to Stanford's fraterni
ties. The writer paints a generally nega

tive picture of the Greek system based
on Profs. Lee Ross' and Joseph Berger's
research on group identity and the few,
well-publicized incidents involving select
individuals from certain fraternities.
We do not need experts to tell us that
fraternities have the ability to influence
their members. All social organizations,
from family units to athletic teams,
influence their members. Personal val
ues can and do change as a result of
interacting with others. By focusing pri
marily on recent criminal acts, the arti
cle seems to suggest that the fraternity
system as a whole exerts negative pres
sure on its members, causing them to
engage in inappropriate or illegal activi
ties. This is simply not true.

Common sense alone can tell us that
what matters is the people you associate
with. Joining a fraternity does not nec
essarily result in the deterioration of an
individual's morals. In many cases,
Stanford men join fraternities with a
sincere desire to achieve fraternal love.
Many students probably know people in
fraternities and can attest to the fact
that these; men are no different from
other Stanford students.
I am also disappointed that Fraternal
Affairs Advisor Heather Dunn assumes
that fraternities can "simply choose
members who are not going to get into
trouble." What? The University sets
rules governing Fraternity Rush, limit
ing it to a two-week period at the begin

ning of spring quarter. The process is
brief and intense, and there is no guar
antee that all those selected are of high
moral standards. Why doesn't the
Admissions Office simply choose stu
dents who are not going to get into trou
ble? How about the University take
some responsibility?
No one can claim to be perfect. The
fraternity system is certainly far from
perfect, but it has many positive aspects
that The Daily has often chosen to
ignore. Rush is on right now, so I
encourage freshmen to go and find out
what the different fraternities are about.
