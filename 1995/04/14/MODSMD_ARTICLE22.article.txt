# Humanities Center gets new head
## 
### Valerie Hsieh 
The Humanities Center will experience a chang
ing of the guard in September, when History Prof.
Keith Baker begins a three-year term as the cen
ter's new director.
Baker — who will give up the chair of the His
tory Department for the new position — succeeds
Art Prof. Wanda Corn, who will return to her
department. Corn declined to serve a second term
at the center to enlarge and build Stanford's Pro
gram in American Art and Material Culture.
Corn said she "is delighted that Baker is going
to be the next director." Considering that the cen
ter's former directors hailed from the English and
Art Departments, Corn said that it is "nice to have
someone from the History Department."
Discussing his vision for the Humanities Cen
ter, Baker said he believes the center — which
offers lectures, conferences and discussions — ful
fills a crucial role as a "place for research and
reflection and writing on humanities," where visit
ing fellows, Stanford faculty and advanced gradu
ate students can discuss issues and problems.
The Humanities Center, located near the
School of Law, sponsors six to seven members of
Stanford's faculty, approximately 10 advanced
Stanford graduate students and six fellows from
other colleges and universities each year to pursue

their own research and writing projects in the
humanities.
Baker is already preparing for his role as the
center's director with a proposal for a new gradu
ate workshop program. The program would bring
together Stanford faculty and graduate students
to discuss problems and issues of their choosing
and to present papers, hold discussions and lec
tures.
The new project has won support in high places.
Vice Provost and Dean of Research and Graduate
Policy Charles Kruger, who made the final selec
tion and appointment of the new director, noted
that both he and University President Gerhard
Casper support the graduate workshops.
Baker himself brings a variety of perspectives to
the position of Humanities Center director with
his background in history.
"Historians tend to be jacks-of-all-trades,"
Baker said. "History has no clear boundaries with
the rest of humanities. If it's happened in the past,
historians want to explore it in as many ways as
possible."
With his background exploring the history of
science and social sciences, Baker fits the require
ments proposed by English Prof. George Dekker,
head of the selection committee, who said during
the selection process that he wanted someone with
"quite eclectic interests."
