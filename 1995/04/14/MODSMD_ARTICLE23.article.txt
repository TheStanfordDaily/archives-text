Stanford 5

When a team that scored 48
runs during its previous three
games faces a pitcher who has
given up one run in his last 18
innings of work, something is
going to give. Unfortunately it
was the Stanford baseball team
that yielded yesterday.
Entering the afternoon game
at Sunken Diamond, the Stan
ford baseball team (22-15 overall,
12-6 in the Pacific 10 Southern
Division) had demolished its
opponents by an average score of
16 runs in its previous two
games. However, the starting
pitchers in those two games were
not Randy Flores of USC (28-15,
11-8 in the Six-Pac).
Flores, a sophomore, stunned
the baseball world last year when
he completed the season with an

11-1 record and a 1.66 earned run
average. The left-hander was
deservedly named to the Ail-Amer
ican second team and the Fresh
man All-America team. This year,
he has pitched well, although his
ERA is almost a run higher.
Flores, the Six-Pac Pitcher of
the Week the last two weeks, does
not give up many runs and the
Cardinal knew that it would have
to keep the score low in order to
win. Stanford was unable to do as
planned as USC jumped ahead
quickly and hung on to win by a
score of 7-5.
"We just weren't able to get on
them," coach Mark Marquess said.
"They got some runs early and he
pitched well."
The Trojans scored their first
run in the fastest way possible in
baseball. Junior right-hander
Todd Bartels threw his first pitch
to leadoff batter Walter Dawkins
and Dawkins promptly deposited
it over the left field fence for his
sixth home run. Hitting homers is
common to Dawkins — he clouted
17 last year.
The Cardinal replied in the top
of the inning as freshman center
fielder Joe Kilburg singled, moved
over to second base on a sacrifice
by junior left fielder Cale Carter
and stole third. Junior catcher A.J.
Hinch, extending his career-high
hitting streak to 14 games, singled
in Kilburg to knot the game at one
apiece. Stanford could not muster
another run until the eighth
inning as Flores settled down.

USC took the lead for good in
the top of the second inning as the
Trojans mounted a two-out rally.
Four consecutive singles from the
catcher Chad Moller, second base
man Ryan Stromsborg, Dawkins
and designated hitter Paul Cruz
led to the two USC runs. The Tro
jans added two more runs off of
Bartels, one in the third and one in
the fourth to expand the lead to 5-
1. Stanford gave USC a gift run in
the sixth inning as Stromsborg
singled and was caught off of first
base on a pitch out. However,
Hinch threw the ball away and
Stromsborg ran all the way to
third base. Cruz then hit a sacri
fice fly to score Stromsborg.
The Cardinal made it interest
ing in the eighth and ninth inning.
Through seven innings, Flores, a
Jimmy Key type pitcher, threw
only 65 pitches as he changed
speeds and mixed up his pitches
and location well keeping Stanford
off balance. Entering this juncture
of the game, the Cardinal had only
mustered three hits off of Flores.
However, Flores began to tire and
Stanford threatened but ultimate
ly could not take the lead.
Troy Kent, the junior first base
man, hit his second home run of
the season, a solo shot to cut the
lead down to 6-2. The designated
hitter, freshman Jon Schaeffer,
singled. After a pop-up sophomore
Eric Sees singled and Kilburg
walked to load the bases. The rally
ended after Flores struck out
Carter but the Cardinal started to
wear down Flores as he was forced
to throw 27 pitches.
The Trojans added an insur
ance run in the top of the ninth
after loading the bases with one

out. The next batter, freshman
Derek Baker, grounded a Mario
Iglesias to shortstop and Sees
threw to second baseman Brian
Dallimore for the second out of the
inning. However, Dallimore's
relay to first base pulled Kent off
the bag and junior shortstop Gabe
Alvarez scored USC's seventh run.
In the bottom of the ninth,
Hinch was hit by a pitch to lead off
the inning but was erased on
senior Dusty Allen's fielder's
choice for the second out off the
inning. Kent followed with a hard
ground ball to third base. Baker,
who until this time had been per
fect defensively, took the high hop
per off of his left arm for an error,
allowing Kent to reach base. D£jci
vu occurred as the next batter,
Schaeffer, hit an identical
grounder and Baker took it off his
left arm again. Allen scored and
the two other runners moved up
two bases.
Head coach Mike Gillespie
made a pitching change, removing
Flores in favor of right-hander
Justin Parle. Parle promptly
rewarded Gillespie by giving up a
two-run single to Dallimore. Gille
spie then removed Parle in favor
of his closer, right-hander Jason
Garner. Garner walked Sees
before recording his ninth save on
an unassisted ground ball by Kil
burg.
The Trojans and the Cardinal
meet again today at 2:30 p.m. with
junior left-hander Mike Robbins
taking the mound. Freshman
right-hander Kyle Peterson pitch
es the final game of the series on
Saturday at 1 p.m. Ben Tucker
