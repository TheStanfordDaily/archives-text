## Will take leave of absence to coach US Olympic squad 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
As expected and rumored for
months, Stanford women's bas
ketball head coach Tara Van-
Derveer announced yesterday
that she will take a year's leave of
absence to coach the U.S. Olympic
team.
Introduced by USA Basketball
Executive Committee President
C. M. Newton as the unanimous
choice by the staff selection com
mittee, VanDerveer said that she
would accept the position,
although with some trepidation.
"I agonized over [leaving the
team]," VanDerveer said. "The
hardest part was leaving people.
It's been extremely difficult."
However, the seal of approval
she received from the squad and
the administration has alleviated
some of her worries.
"I definitely feel the support
from our team," VanDerveer said.
"I've had tremendous support
from [Athletics Director] Ted
Leland, [Senior Assoc. Athletics
Director] Cheryl Levick and the
staff at Stanford."
VanDerveer also said that she
was told that she had been chosen
approximately a week ago and
that she debated whether or not
to accept during the interim. The
squad was officially informed of
her decision in a meeting on Tues
day.

Associate coach Amy Tucker
will be taking over the head
coaching reins for the 1995-96
season, Leland said. The three
assistant coach positions have not
been finalized, Leland and Van-
Derveer said.
"We will be building the best
coaching staff we can around Amy
Tucker," VanDerveer said.

The rumored departures of
assistant coaches Julie Plank and
Carolyn Jenkins was not con
firmed at the press conference
yesterday morning. However,
Leland stated that there is some
dissension in the Stanford staff.
"Some people were disappoint-

Ed of the decisions Tara and Stan
ford made," Leland said. "But
there were no official resigna
tions."
Although VanDerveer will be
taking a year leave of absence, she
will be spotted periodically on the
Stanford campus. After the trials
for the national team roster spots
and exhibition games in Europe in
May and June, VanDerveer said
that she would return to recruit for

the Cardinal until September. After
the 1996 Olympic team is designat
ed, the squad will travel around the
country and play a series of exhibi
tion games against NCAA Division
I women's teams and conference
all-star teams. Stanford is among
the schools included.
"It's going to be great coming
back," VanDerveer said. "But it's
going to be odd sitting on the other
bench."
The selection of VanDerveer is
one step towards completing the
quest to regain the Olympic gold
med;J. After claiming the bron2e
medal at the last Olympics in
Barcelona, Spain, USA Basketball

decided to create the year-long
Women's National Team, design
ing it specifically towards the 1996
Olympic Games in Atlanta.
"USA Basketball is committed
to doing everything within its
power to reclaim the Olympic gold
medal in Atlanta," Newton said.
"By securing Tara VanDerveer as
our Olympic team head coach we
are a giant step closer to that goal.
She brings a wealth of experience
from both the international and
collegiate coaching ranks to our
national team and we are extreme
ly excited that a coach of her caliber
will direct this extraordinary
women's basketball program."
