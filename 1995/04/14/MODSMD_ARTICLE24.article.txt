### Emery Chen Staff writer 
As expected and rumored for
months, Stanford women's bas
ketball head coach Tara Van-
Derveer announced yesterday
that she will take a year's leave of
absence to coach the U.S. Olympic
team.
Introduced by USA Basketball
Executive Committee President
C. M. Newton as the unanimous
choice by the staff selection com

hardest part was leaving people.
It's been extremely difficult."
However, the seal of approval
she received from the squad and
the administration has alleviated

from our team," VanDerveer said.
"I've had tremendous support
from [Athletics Director] Ted
Leland, [Senior Assoc. Athletics
Director] Cheryl Levick and the
staff at Stanford."
VanDerveer also said that she
was told that she had been chosen
approximately a week ago and
that she debated whether or not
to accept during the interim. The
squad was officially informed of
her decision in a meeting on Tues
day.

Associate coach Amy Tucker
will be taking over the head

season, Leland said. The three
assistant coach positions have not
been finalized, Leland and Van-

"We will be building the best
coaching staff we can around Amy
Tucker," VanDerveer said.

The rumored departures of
assistant coaches Julie Plank and
Carolyn Jenkins was not con
