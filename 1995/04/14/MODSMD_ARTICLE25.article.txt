# Off to the desert
## Tennis hopes to burn 'Zonas 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
The No. 1-ranked Stanford men's tennis
team (19-0) will wander through the desert this
weekend to defend its perfect record against
No. 16 Arizona State (9-6) and No. 50 Arizona
(4-11).
The team is riding a surge of momentum cre
ated not only by its 19 consecutive victories but
also by its two emotional victories on the road
last week against UCLA and USC.
"Those two matches were real confidence
boosters for this team," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould.
The challenge this weekend will be to keep
the emotions riding high for the Cardinal play
ers against one good team from Tempe and one
struggling team from Tucson.
The Sun Devils are led by the nation's top
ranked player, Sargis Sargsian, who attended
the Institute of Sport in Yerevan, Armenia
prior to signing on with Arizona State. He
defeated Stanford's sixth-ranked Jeff Salzen
stein, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), last March 31 at Stanford
Tennis Stadium. Salzenstein will be looking for
a measure of revenge after Sargsian won their
match on a highly disputable line call. After
that match, Sargsian confessed to cheating
Salzenstein on the call.
The day after his match with Salzenstein,
Sargsian was upset by California's 42nd-ranked
Michael Hill at Berkeley.
ASU took one other match from the Cardinal
in their previous meeting, but that was at No. 6
singles, where junior Ricky Becker was out of
the lineup with a sprained elbow. He is back

Every other Cardinal player
won their previous matches
against the Sun Devils in straight
sets.

No. 33 Jan Anderson of
Hamar, Norway leads the Wildcat
lineup. He missed the Wildcats
last match against Stanford due
to the chicken pox.
In their dual match last April
1, the Cardinal blanked the Ari
zona, 7-0. Becker and 36th
ranked freshman Paul Goldstein
were the only Stanford players
who needed three sets to win

their matches against the Wild
cats.
This is the Cardinal's final
road trip of the season. Stanford's
final home stand will take place
next weekend, when USC and
UCLA will make a final bid to
spoil the Cardinal's attempt at a
second undefeated season. Stan
ford went undefeated in its NCAA
championship season of 1978.
