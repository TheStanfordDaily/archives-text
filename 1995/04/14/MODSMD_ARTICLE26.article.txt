# Softball may feel the heat this weekend

### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
Throughout history, the role of the
underdog has been one of the most cher
ished aspects of sports. Audiences were
captivated by the Los Angeles Dodgers'
stunning victory in the 1988 World
Series, Villanova's shocking defeat of
Georgetown in the 1985 college basket
ball championship game and Rocky's
upset win over Apollo Creed for the
heavyweight championship.
Tonight at 6 p.m., the Stanford soft

ball team takes center stage as the ulti
mate underdog when, in only its second
season as a varsity sport, the Cardinal
faces two-time defending national cham
pion Arizona.
Stanford (10-20 overall, 1-11 in the
Pacific-10) has struggled this year
against conference competition. Rarely
able to mount a consistent offensive
attack, the Cardinal hasn't put enough
runs together to threaten its more expe
rienced opponents. In addition, Stan
ford's propensity for committing too
many errors and its inability to make big

plays has cost the team more than a few
games. Outside of a doubleheader split
with Oregon State, Stanford is winless
in Pac-10 play.
The job doesn't get any easier in Tuc
son as this year's Arizona squad is per
haps the most explosive team in the
country. Offensively, the Wildcats are
led by Laura Espinoza, who leads the
nation with an astonishing 26 home
runs in just 39 games. Arizona's lineup
also includes first baseman Amy Chelve-
old, who leads the country in hits.
If the Cardinal somehow man
ages to shut down the Wildcat
hitting attack, Stanford will face
an equally arduous task attempt
ing to score. Arizona comes
equipped with fireballer Cari
Dolan, a sophomore from Los

Alamitos, Calif, whose record on
the season is 20-1. Stanford's
ability to score will largely
depend on the bat of sophomore
shortstop and leadoff hitter Sum
mer Lee, who leads the Cardinal
with a .457 batting average.
When Lee gets on base, Stan
ford's offense tends to produce
runs.
"They're just a great team,"
Stanford coach Sandy Pearce said
of Arizona. "They have the hit

ting, the pitching, and the
defense to compete with anybody.
They really don't have any weak
nesses."
Never failing to express opti
mism, however, Pearce noted
that the Wildcats are by no
means invincible.
"Against UCLA [last week
end], Espinoza went 0-8, so they
definitely can be stopped," she
said.
Stanford, however, is no
UCLA. The Bruins, ranked first
in the nation, swept the Wildcats
in a doubleheader over the week
end to run their season record
against Arizona to 3-1 and their
overall record to 22-2.
To make matters worse, the
Cardinal must face the mighty
Wildcats without the services of
"diaper dandy" hurler Jessica
Schulman. Schulman, a fresh
man from Los Angeles, is out
indefinitely with a stress fracture
in her back. In her place, Angela
Webb, a sophomore from
Modesto, Calif., has been pitch
ing both games of every Pac-10
double header.
"Angela is doing a great job,"
Pearce said. "Obviously it hurts
not to have Jessica because any
time a batter can see you that
many times you're less effective.
But she can outsmart them if she
mixes up her pitches well and
hits her spots."
In other words, Stanford must
play a perfect game to win, some
thing the young team has had
trouble doing this season.
On Saturday, the Cardinal
travels to Tempe to take on Ari
zona State. Last Saturday, the
Sun Devils came to Stanford and
swept the Cardinal by scores of 5-
3 and 8-0.
ASU is led offensively by
Kristin Korb, who torched the
Cardinal for six hits in seven at
bats at El Camino field. Tina
Ruff also carries a big stick for
the Sun Devils, as evidenced by
the long home run she smacked
in the second game of Saturday's
doubleheader. Carrie Breedlove
(16-5) leads a solid ASU pitching
staff.
"These will definitely be tough
games for us," Sandy Pearce said.
"[Playing against] U of A always
means facing that 5,000 seat sta
dium that's full of screaming fans
every time they play. We're defi
nitely excited about going down
there."

the Cardinal to succeed this weekend.
