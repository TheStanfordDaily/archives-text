# Stanford cycling hosts the nation's best
## 
### Rajen Sheth Contributing writer 
Early Saturday morning, while most
Stanford students are sleeping soundly,
it will be business as usual for the Stan
ford cycling team — the top ranked col
legiate squad in the nation — as it pre
pares to host the Stanford Race Week
end.
The weekend event will bring togeth
er 15 top schools from the West Coast
and Nevada for a road race, a criterion
and a time trial. The road race, which
will be held on Saturday outside of Liv
ermore, features a 23-mile circuit high
lighted by many steep hills. Racers,
depending on their category, take
between one and three laps around the

track. Stanford cyclist Dave Bailey, a
grad student, said, "This is definitely a
very long and tiring event."
However, after racing up to almost 70
miles on Saturday, the racers must wake
up early Sunday morning as well to race
in the time trial which will be held on a
3.5 mile stretch parallel to Highway 280.
Finally, the weekend ends with a criteri
on held on the Stanford campus starting
at 11 a.m. In the criterion, cyclists race
between 30 and 40 laps around a short
0.5 to 0.6 mile loop. In order to enliven
the action, some of those laps are desig
nated as prime laps. The first four racers
to cross the starting gate on a prime lap
are given bonus points.
For the Stanford cyclists, this gruel
ing weekend is nothing unusual.

we do this every weekend, we get used to
it by the end of the season," Bailey said.
"Road trips are even rougher. We stay in
little motels in many different towns
and just suffer, but it ends up being a lot
of fun."
The cycling season starts in Febru
ary; each weekend a different school
hosts a series of races. Stanford's main
competition on the West Coast includes
second-ranked California, UC-Davis,
UCLA and Cal Poly-San-Luis Obispo.
The teams accumulate points at the
races which they can carry with them
into the conference championship. The
Stanford road race is particularly tough,
so it attracts many schools.
At the conference champi
onship on May 12-13 at Cal Poly,
a team is allowed to come in with
the points from their ten best fin
ishes in a single event whether it
be the road race, criterion, or time
trial. The most points a team can
bring from an event is 100 points,
so a team which has won 10
events can bring in 1,000 points.

Cal has already won 10 events
and Stanford hopes to soon
achieve the same. The five top
teams at the conference champi
onship then advance to Nationals
on June 3-4 in Reno, Nev., to
compete against the nation's top
teams.
The Stanford team, coached by
Art Walker, includes an impressive
group of cyclists, many of whom
have attained national honors. The
captain of the team is grad student
Dario Falquier, a strong hill
climber and road racer who is a

favorite to win the road race this
weekend. Also on the men's team is
junior Andrew Lewis, a specialist
at the time trial and criterion who
has spent considerable time racing
in Europe and used to race for the
U.S. National Cycling Team.
The women's team is anchored
by senior Tracy Timms who, as a
freshman, won the national colle
giate road race. She is also on the
U.S. National B Team. Grad stu
dents Megan Troxell and Joan
Wilson, both excellent road racers
and hill climbers, also star.
