# No. 3 volleyball team heads to LMU, USC

The Stanford men's volleyball team
starts its charge for the NCAA Final Four
this weekend with its last two regular sea
son matches. The No. 3 Cardinal hopes to
build up momentum for the postseason
tournament by running over Loyola Mary
mount University tomorrow and USC on
Saturday.
"We're treating this weekend like
mock-playoffs," said freshman middle
blocker Keenan Whitehurst. "We haven't
won two in a row yet on the road since
playing in San Diego at the beginning of
the season. The way the playoffs are set
up, we're going to have to win back-to
back matches."
LMU (7-14 overall, 4-13 in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) could pre
sent a formidable roadblock in the Cardi
nal's way. The Lions have already been
eliminated from the postseason tourna
ment, but Stanford (16-6, 12-5 in the
MPSF) is worried that LMU will play bet
ter because of this fact — that the Lions
will be trying hard to end the season on a
positive note.
LMU, one of the rising programs in the
league, has shown dramatic improvement
season to season. Opposite hitter Jason
McEntee can catch fire in matches and
pull off strings of kills. Whitehurst empha
sized the fact that LMU has the potential
to knock off unsuspecting top teams. How

ever, Stanford will still approach the Lions
as a lesser team that must not be allowed
to get hot.
"To win in these situations what we
have to do is get them down early and not
let them get rolling," said sophomore Matt
Fuerbringer. "You have to try to make
them feel like they can't play with you, you
can't let them develop confidence."
The Cardinal's face-off with 11th
ranked USC (10-11, 7-9 in the MPSF) will
present a different, and probably tougher,
challenge. With seven out of eight spots
already accounted for in the tournament
field, the Trojans are one team among
many that are battling to play in the post
season.
"USC is playing to get in the playoffs,"
said coach Ruben Nieves, "There's a lot of
incentive for them, a lot on the line."
The Trojans are a perennial power
house in men's volleyball, but their for
tunes have sunk this season. USC started
the year with high expectations — return
ing the solid passing of swing hitter Rus
sell Brock and the big arm of opposite hit
ter Jason Mulholland. Mulholland is cur
rently seventh in the nation in kill average
with 6.6 and is hitting .339.
However injuries, inconsistent team
chemistry and instability at the setting
position have all dogged the Trojans.
"Even though we're not as good as in
past seasons, we're improving," said USC
