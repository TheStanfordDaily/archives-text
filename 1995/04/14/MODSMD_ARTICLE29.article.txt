# Tough stand for women
## No. 5 Arizona, No. 8 ASU come to Stanford 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion powerhouses collide this weekend as
fifth-ranked Arizona (16-3 overall, 5-2 in
the Pac-10 South) and eighth-ranked Ari
zona State (13-6, 2-5 in the Pac-10 South)
attempt to blemish Stanford's seventh
ranked women's tennis team's (16-2, 5-0
in the Pac-10 South) perfect divisional
record at the Stanford Tennis Stadium
this Friday and Saturday.
The Cardinal had little trouble with
these two squads earlier this season on
the road, downing Arizona 7-2 and Ari
zona State 5-2 in achieving their first two
Pac-10 South victories. However, both
teams have been on a tear since those

matches in mid-February. The Sun Devils
boast a 9-3 record since then, losing only
to highly ranked opponents such as
UCLA, Arizona and Texas.
The Wildcats have lost only twice since
the matchup and are currently on a run of
six straight victories that includes
impressive triumphs over three top-15
squads, USC (No. 13), Arizona State (No.
8) and the second-ranked Texas team
which defeated the Cardinal 6-3. Arizona
has also put down other nationally promi
nent teams such as UCLA, California,
Kansas and Florida.
The Sun Devils, Stanford's Friday
opponent, pose a serious threat up front
with Kori Davidson (11-6), who currently

sits in the Rolex Collegiate Rank
ings at No. 6 nationally. Davidson
did not appear in the Cardinal vic
tory earlier this season and may
not compete this weekend due to
injury. Arizona State's Nos. 2 and
3 singles competitors, Joelle
Schad and Reka Cserenyes, also
rank highly nationally at No. 32
and 26, respectively.
Davidson, Schad and
Cserenyes, despite putting up a
total record 37-17 record at the
top three spots, have not per
formed well in the Pac-10 South;
their combined in-conference
record is 8-12. The Cardinal won
two of three matches up front in
February. Sun Devil Anna Moll,
usually competing at the No. 6
position, holds Arizona State's
only winning record in the divi

sion at 5-2. Moll handed Cardinal
freshmen Julie Scott her first
defeat of the season in Tempe, 7-
5, 6-2.
"I thought we were flat against
them," said head coach Frank
Brennan. "The match against
Arizona was one we pointed to,
and then the next one was sort of
a letdown, especially when we got
there and realized that Kori was
not going to play. They're good,
but they're not great."
In doubles, the Sun Devil
squad of Davidson and Schad
rank seventh nationally and will
most likely meet sophomore Katie
Schlukebir and freshman Ania
Bleszynski who currently sit at
No. 14.
"The one we have to worry
about is the next day [Arizona!,"
Brennan said. "They've done
well, they've got a good team. We
gave them a lot of respect when
we went down there, and I think
we played one of our better

matches. Things really went our
way."
The Wildcats may not have the
big names or the national power
houses, but Arizona quietly has
downed a number of notable
opponents and seeks, with a win
over either the Cardinal or Cal
this weekend, to win more games
(six) in the Pac-10 South than
they have in their history.
"They're sleepers; their No. 1
player is very good," Brennan
said. "That was a good win for
Katie. She [Vicky Maes] is better
than most of the Nos. 1 out there.
The No. 2 girl, Schurhoff, is pret
ty damn good. Ania beat her and
that was probably Ania's best win
of the year."
Eva Maria Schurhoff, Ari
zona's highest ranked player at
No. 44 in the country, has reeled
off six straight victories and
Melody Falco has not lost since
Scott defeated her 6-4, 6-4 in
February.
