# Keeping government environmental
## Montana senator discusses regulatory issues in today's government 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Stanford alumnus and U.S. Sen. Max Bau
cus, D-Mont., focused on environmental issues
and problems with government in a speech last
night in the Political Science Building.
About 100 students and visitors attended the
speech, which was sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau and Stanford-in-Government.
Baucus — who is the ranking minority mem
ber on the Senate Environmental and Public
Works Committee — counted cleaning up the
environment among the greatest achievements
of the federal government.
From the Clean Air Act and Safe Drinking
Water Act, to Superfund and the Endangered
Species Act, the federal government has made
rules that people today "take for granted," he
said.
"America was born with unspoiled wilder
ness, unique in the world," Baucus said. "We
took it for granted and exploited it to the hilt."
Baucus said that some in the new Republican
congressional majority are trying to roll back en
vironmental regulations to benefit corporations

and special interests. While Baucus said he is not
opposed to reviewing such rules, he is opposed to
"crippling" environmental laws.
"Whether environmental regulations are an
noying sources of bureaucracy and red tape is
subject to debate," said Baucus.
The senator also objected to using "cost-ben
efit" analyses in trying to balance out economic
and environmental benefits. Baucus said there is
no way to quantify the benefits of a clean and
safe environment.
Baucus cited environmental problems in his
home state of Montana caused by copper mines
that operated there over a century ago.
"Half the world's copper used to come from
Montana — copper that made the U.S. an indus
trial giant," he said. "The money that came in
from the mines was incredible.
"Yet at many of those sites today the water is
so acid that it would burn your face if you tried to
wash with it," Baucus added. "Thousands of fish
die when the spring rains run off from the old
mines."
The senator said cost-benefit analyses could
lead to court battles.
But not all the news is bad, in terms of feder

al policy on environmental issues. Baucus cited
many examples in which government regulation
has helped to save the environment, saying laws
like the Clean Air Act have given the current
generation "a cleaner, healthier world."
IjOS Angeles "now has three extra months
where the air is not rated as hazardous. Lead
emissions are down 90 percent from levels in the
'70s, and species like the Grizzly Bear and the
Bald Eagle are saved from the brink of extinc
tion," Baucus said.
Also in his speech last night, Baucus talked
about U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-
Ga., and the "Contract With America." He said
the Republicans were "masterful" last year in
engineering their electoral victories over the De
mocrats by using the media to their advantage.
"Cut spending and lower taxes, that's a quick
and easy soundbite. The Democrats had no
soundbite that could cut to the chase," said Bau
cus. "Responsibility and a more inclusive party
— that's hard to get across in a short message."
Baucus said the messages the Republicans
were sending to the electorate were amplified
through popular conservative radio
personalities like Rush Limbaugh
and G. Gordon Liddy, who could
not be matched by the Democrats.
Banco* predicted that the most
divisive issue for Democrats in the
'96 election will be affirmative
action. While the senator said he
favors such programs, he added it
is necessary to review the focus and
purpose of many of them to ensure
fairness.
Revealing his sense of humor,
the senator recalled for the audi
ence his most memorable experi
ences as an undergraduate at Stan
ford.
After Baucus finished his sopho
more year at Stanford's Paris cam
pus, he took a year off to hike
around the world. He visited vil
lages in Africa and had the oppor
tunity to meet personally with
India's prime minister at the time,
Jawarhalal Nehru.
Baucus recalled being "sick as a
dog" with dysentery in Egypt and
the Philippines. One major prob
lem was that toilet paper was a rare
commodity in the places where he
traveled.
"So a friend gave me a paper
back novel. I had to decide whether
I wanted to know the ending that
much. In the end, I decided to make
up my own ending," Baucus joked.
