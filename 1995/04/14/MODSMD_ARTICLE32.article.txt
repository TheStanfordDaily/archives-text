# Matztipation and other Seder sensations
## 
### 
By the time this paper comes out I won't be
here. I'll be in a cab taking me from JFK to
Mamaroneck, N.Y. so I can get home in time
to eat matzah.
It's Passover and it's a strange time of year.
For many, it's a time for family — as conse
quential as Christmas, except instead of trad
ing presents, somebody makes soup.
At a baseline level, almost every Jew will
consecrate a meal for matzah and, even if they
don't shun the leavened life during the eight
days of yeast-abstention (seven if you happen
to be in the Holy Land), they'll at least take
out a moment to feel guilty about it.
Matzah: Seven by seven inches of pure
unleavened fun — munched plain for millen
nia, with cream cheese for a century. Aerody
namic in its simplicity, matzah is the central
symbol of Passover.
Matzah: Sounds fun 'n' tasty to non-Jewish
friends who enjoy the challenge of spreading
peanut butter on a full sheet without breaking
it. But if you oblige yourself to subsist on the
stuff for over a week you'll find that certain
things start to happen. About a week from
ioday, a six-to-eight-inch cylinder of half
iigested unleavened wheat thin will be lodged
in enough colons (read: matztipated) that if
you stuck the wads end to end, you'd have
yourself a hefty enough train track of pre-poo
to cross Texas and a good chunk of Arkansas.
"For verily, this is the bread of affliction."
Matzah: The wasa cracker of irony, eaten
in commemoration of a grand Exodus only to
prevent any expulsions of our own.
But Passover restrictions imply not only
the eating of matzah, but the ritual eradica
tion of chametz, of anything leavened — sym
bol of the inflated comfort too easily gotten

used to — from the palate and from the home.
In pantries around the globe, bread is ban
ished, English muffins exiled — at some point
or another you have to wonder why.
The simple answer the rabbis gave us in
elementary school was the linear fairy tale
story: the Hebrews didn't have time to let
their bagels rise when they were packing their
suitcases for the Promised Land and so we do
the same. Some deeper motives aren't too far
off.
Consider that the prescribed punishment
for purposeful transgression of the no-bread
policy is among the harshest described in the
Judeo-legal world: not only is one made per
sonally accountable, but one's lineage is
thought "to be cut off from the nation of
Israel." Metaphysical banishment — just for a
eating a Twinkie.
So in the minds of those who devised
Passover's restrictions the consecration of the
menu was not unimportant. It isn't that some
long-dead sages were obsessively intent on
getting crap caught in your teeth, rather that,
to them, a denial of the shared experience of
an exodus from slavery was thought to be a
denial of one's personal freedom.
Matzah: Not just an oversized Saltine gra
tuitously set out by Food Service in lieu of reli
gious compassion; it stands as a crunchy sym
bol of a nation-turned-ethnicity's emancipa
tion. In its meticulously baked bubbles is
imprinted a story of freedom chosen — of will
manifest.
The retelling of that liberation is what con
stitutes the Seder, the ritual dinner of
Passover. For reasons of particularity and
obscure symbolism, Seders are the stuff of so
much Jewish kitsch. Every textbook-case

short, funny, curly-haired Yid ever to have
theii own sitcom or movie has sanctified at
least one scene for the Seder gag.
But there is something to the meal's
quirks. With our attendance we build and
share memories: memories of the scarcely
speaking youngest child being forced to recite
"the four questions" as Uncle Simcha changes
the battery on the video camera; of opening
the door for the spectral Elijah who comes to
every household who invites him for a sip of
wine and maybe a pee break; of texts
archaically translated into Thousand verilys
which impede appreciation of the holiday's
humanistic sentiments; of the vague wisdom
in the neuroses of the Sages.
And then there's the solemn moment when
someone makes the comparison between the
loss of freedom in biblical history and the
atrocities of the Nazi prison camps — abrupt
ly broken, of course, when someone's mom or
aunt or cousin brings in a fruit salad for
dessert.
Still, for reasons of identity, tradition
and/or obligation, we celebrate Passover in all
its superannuated splendor — each in our own
way. Through bitter herbs and through gefilte
fish and through Seders and through, yeah,
matzah.
The most depressing smell in the entire world burnt popcorn
