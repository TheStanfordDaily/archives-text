## Trustees give preliminary approval to new grad dorms, pedestrian mall 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
The University Board of
Trustees has approved plans to
construct two new graduate
housing facilities and to convert
Serra Street into a pedestrian
mall.
At its meetings on Monday and
Tuesday, the board gave program
approval to plans to build a new
graduate housing facility on the
west side of campus near Gover
nor's Corner, according to Robert
Bass, a University trustee and
chair of the trustees' Committee
on Land and Buildings.
Program approval means the
trustees have given "the go-ahead
to begin serious design," Bass
said. This move follows concept
and site approval, which the
trustees granted last June.
The facility, which will be con
structed on the current site of the

Governor's Corner parking lot,
will contain 124 apartments with
each housing two graduate stu
dents. According to Housing and
Dining Services Director Keith
Guy, the project will cost about
$16.2 million overall.
Bass said the board has seen
and favorably reviewed basic de
sign plans for the project but there
are as yet no construction docu
ments.
"We're scheduled to break
ground this summer," Guy said. If
all goes as planned, the new resi
dence will be open for occupancy
by fall 1996.
Guy said the University will
also construct new parking facili
ties and expand existing facilities
to replace the Governor's Corner
lot.
"We're hoping to have some
parking available to replace that
parking," Guy said. "Those are
going to have to be done along
with the project this summer."
The board has also granted
design approved to a plan to con
vert Serra Street into a pedestri
an mall, according to Michael
Kuntz, the project manager.
The plan is to narrow the road
way and restrict it to transit vehi
cles and bicycles, Kuntz said.
Expanded sidewalks will accom
modate pedestrians.
Kuntz said the goal of the pro
ject is to make it safe and conve
nient for bicycles to travel on the
roadway, leaving the sidewalks to
pedestrians.
"Eventually it will go .. . from
Via Ortega to Galvez (Street),"
Kuntz said. "The long-range plan

is to continue to expand that out
to Campus Drive East."
The project will be completed
in sections and will begin with a
segment on the west end of Serra
Street, Bass said.
Kuntz added that construction
will begin in May with some utili
ty work and will continue into the
fall.
Construction on the first seg
ment is scheduled to be completed
later this year to coincide with the
completion of the Gates Informa
tion Sciences Building and the
expansion of the Center for Inte
grated Systems.
"That end of Serra Street is
integral to the Gates Building,
which is on one side, and the sci
ence and engineering quad, which
is on the other," said trustee Mer
noy Harrison.
The cost to complete the
improvements on the first seg
ment will be about $1.4 million,

Bass said.
The Board of Trustees also has
given concept approval to a gradu
ate housing project in Manzanita
Park, according to Shirley Chen,
the project manager. The project
will house 280 students in small
single rooms.
During the summer, the new
residence will house students in
an executive education program
offered by the Graduate School of
Business. During the regular aca
demic year, the building will
house graduate students, with
preference given to Business
School students.
Chen said the project could go
before the trustees again for
design approval as early as this
summer and construction is
scheduled to begin in the winter
of 1996. The project is scheduled
to be completed by the summer of
1997, she said.
