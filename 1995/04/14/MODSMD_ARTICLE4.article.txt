## Trustees give preliminary approval to new grad dorms, pedestrian mall 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
The University Board of
Trustees has approved plans to
construct two new graduate
housing facilities and to convert
Serra Street into a pedestrian
mall.
At its meetings on Monday and
Tuesday, the board gave program
approval to plans to build a new
graduate housing facility on the
west side of campus near Gover
nor's Corner, according to Robert
Bass, a University trustee and
chair of the trustees' Committee
on Land and Buildings.
Program approval means the
trustees have given "the go-ahead
to begin serious design," Bass
said. This move follows concept
and site approval, which the
trustees granted last June.
The facility, which will be con
structed on the current site of the

Governor's Corner parking lot,
will contain 124 apartments with
each housing two graduate stu
dents. According to Housing and
Dining Services Director Keith
Guy, the project will cost about
$16.2 million overall.
Bass said the board has seen
and favorably reviewed basic de
sign plans for the project but there
are as yet no construction docu
ments.
"We're scheduled to break
ground this summer," Guy said. If
all goes as planned, the new resi
dence will be open for occupancy
by fall 1996.
Guy said the University will
also construct new parking facili
ties and expand existing facilities
to replace the Governor's Corner
lot.
"We're hoping to have some
parking available to replace that
