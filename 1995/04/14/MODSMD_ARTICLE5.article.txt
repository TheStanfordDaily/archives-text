# Before the new grading policy starts
## Last call to drop a class at last minute 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
As the deadline for filing study
lists approaches, some students are
packing their schedules, hoping to
take full advantage of the last quar
ter before the new grading policy is
fully implemented.
At the same time, professors in
classes which typically see a large
number of returning students say
they see few people scrambling to
retake courses, though it is the last
chance to do so without penalty.
"Given that the policy is going to
change, I plan to take advantage of
the leniency available to me this
quarter," said freshman Andy
Salter. "I'm taking a course load
that is too difficult for me, and I
plan to drop the course that is ei
ther the most difficult or the most
uninteresting."
Beginning next year, students
must drop classes by the fourth
week of the quarter if they do not
want the dropped course to appear
on their transcripts. Classes
dropped between the fifth and
eighth weeks of the quarter will
show up on transcripts with a "W"

notation for "withdrew." Currently
students can drop a class right up to
the course's final exam without
penalty.
In addition, students' tran
scripts will record an "NP" for "not
passed" when they fail a class. Fail
ing grades have not been recorded
on students' transcripts since 1970.
"From talking to the registrar
and other professors, my main im
pression of (the new policy) is that
there was a little confusion at the
end of last year and at the begin
ning of this year, but most of that
has died down," said Geology Prof.
Gail Mahood, who chaired the com
mittee that created the grading pro
posal last year. The Faculty Senate
approved the committee's proposal
last June.
"There's no real reason to think
that things aren't going smoothly,"
Mahood said.
Other professors agreed that
this year's transitional period has
progressed smoothly. Mathematics
Assoc. Prof. Rafe Mazzeo, a fresh
man adviser who taught Math 43
winter quarter, said that while
