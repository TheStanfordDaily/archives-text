# Before the new grading policy starts
## Last call to drop a class at last minute 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
As the deadline for filing study
lists approaches, some students are
packing their schedules, hoping to
take full advantage of the last quar
ter before the new grading policy is
fully implemented.
At the same time, professors in
classes which typically see a large
number of returning students say
they see few people scrambling to
retake courses, though it is the last
chance to do so without penalty.
"Given that the policy is going to
change, I plan to take advantage of
the leniency available to me this
quarter," said freshman Andy
Salter. "I'm taking a course load
that is too difficult for me, and I
plan to drop the course that is ei
ther the most difficult or the most
uninteresting."
Beginning next year, students
must drop classes by the fourth
week of the quarter if they do not
want the dropped course to appear
on their transcripts. Classes
dropped between the fifth and
eighth weeks of the quarter will
show up on transcripts with a "W"

notation for "withdrew." Currently
students can drop a class right up to
the course's final exam without
penalty.
In addition, students' tran
scripts will record an "NP" for "not
passed" when they fail a class. Fail
ing grades have not been recorded
on students' transcripts since 1970.
"From talking to the registrar
and other professors, my main im
pression of (the new policy) is that
there was a little confusion at the
end of last year and at the begin
ning of this year, but most of that
has died down," said Geology Prof.
Gail Mahood, who chaired the com
mittee that created the grading pro
posal last year. The Faculty Senate
approved the committee's proposal
last June.
"There's no real reason to think
that things aren't going smoothly,"
Mahood said.
Other professors agreed that
this year's transitional period has
progressed smoothly. Mathematics
Assoc. Prof. Rafe Mazzeo, a fresh
man adviser who taught Math 43
winter quarter, said that while
some students retook the class to
get a better grade, he did not have
the sense that a large number of
people were repeating his class sim
ply due to the policy change.
In addition, Chemistry Prof.
Paul Wender, who teaches Chem
istry 33 this quarter, said he has
not noticed more students retaking
his class this quarter than in previ
ous years.
Approximately 400 students are
enrolled in Chemistry 33, Wender
said, which is about 60 fewer stu
dents than last spring.
He added that in his estimation,
the new grading policy will be a pos
itive change since students will be
forced to think more about intellec
tual pursuits, rather than focusing
solely on grades.

Biology Prof. Robert Simoni
said retaking a class is too common
at Stanford. He added that he does
not think it is appropriate for stu
dents to retake a class if they get a
C or better.
Simoni, who taught Biology 31
fall quarter, estimated that 30 of
the 450 people in his class were
retaking the course, but said these
numbers were not any higher than
in previous years. Typically, five to
six percent of students in a class
are repeating it, he said.
"How you are going to do in a
course shouldn't be the determin
ing force of whether or not you
take a course," Simoni said. "You
take a course because you are inter
ested in it or because you have to. I
don't think [the change in policy]
will be that significant because stu
dents will still take the classes that
they want to take."
In contrast, some students con
tinue to express reservations about

the new policy, saying it will limit
their academic choices and
requires them to be more cautious
when choosing classes in order to
avoid unflattering marks on their
transcripts.
"I just don't have the comfort of
knowing I can retake the class,"
freshman Janelle Thompson said.
"I fear graduate schools will look at
the mark as bad. Under the new
system it is more life and death to
do well."
Freshman Stephanie Min said
she is particularly concerned
because she will eventually apply to
medical school and so has to be
more cautious in the way she
approaches course selection.
"If you have medical school or
graduate school off in the distance
it is just that much more harrow
ing to do well in a class," Min said.
