# 3 senior class slates seek leadership role
## With various goals, all stress community 
### Molly Stephens Staff writer 
Members of the junior class will
pull themselves out of their spring
quarter reveries next Wednesday
and Thursday to elect Senior Class
Presidents, who are charged with
creating the ideal senior year.
Three slates — named "Four
Play," "The Final Four" and "Wel
come to Par-

adise" — are
vying for the
office and
though each
slate pos
sesses differ
ent ideas
and goals, all
share the de

m

sire to create a sense of community
within the senior class.
In addition, the victorious slate
will be in charge of traditional se
nior-class activities — including
aiding in the selection of next year's
graduation speaker.
'Four Play'
Juniors Reed Kennedy, Liane
Nomura, Nancy Salas and Tom
Sharpe of "Four Play" believe that
the Senior Class Presidents should

provide seniors with a fun and
memorable year.
They say they want to continue
the traditional senior activities,
such as senior pub nights and skip
days, but they also want to add new
activities.
"We're thinking of having a se
nior cruise, freshman dorm re
unions and junior / senior activities
and wars," said Nomura, an Ameri
can Studies "We want to
build spirit through competition."
Nomura added that they feel it is
important to know what seniors
want. "We want to create an e-mail
alias [for seniors to express their
ideas] and a newsletter to keep se
niors informed," she said.
Members of "Four Play" believe
they can serve the senior class well
since they are a diverse group of
people and have been involved in
many organizations.
'The Final Four'
Juniors Christopher Ruiz de Es
parza, Jeffrey Dahmus, Mercedes
Carnethon and Carol Cocker of
"The Final Four" say they are dedi
cated and willing to work hard for
the senior class.
"We're really excited about [se
nior activities]," said Carnethon, a
human biology major. "We have
the time to put into these activities
since most of us are almost fin
ished."
Dahmus, a mechanical engi
neering major, said the group plans
to "continue with the normal
senior activities such as Pub
Crawl."
But since members of "The
Final Four" feel that solidifying
the senior community is the most
important goal, they want to
focus more on getting seniors
involved.

"We want to try different things
with the traditional activities,"
Carnethon said. "In the past, not
everyone was involved."
"We also want to try community
service outreach," Carnethon
added. "We think we can get a lot of
the senior community involved
through this type of program."
'Welcome to Paradise'
Juniors Angela Booker, Sarah
Cranston, Andre Javier and Aaron
Lehman of "Welcome to Paradise"
want to make senior year a virtual
paradise for seniors.
"We want to bring the class
together since we will always be
recognized by our class year," said
Booker, a sociology major.
Members of "Welcome to Par

adise" say they have many ideas for
new senior activities.
"We are thinking of holding a
senior showcase to allow seniors to
show their talents," said Cranston,
an international relations and art
history major.
"We're planning random senior
hang time," Booker said. "We also
want to work with the sophomore
and junior class presidents to plan
a campus-wide event."
Members of "Welcome to Par
adise" believe they can serve the
senior class well. "We are all very
involved and reach most of the
class," Booker said.
"We have some fun people with
a lot of creativity and energy to
focus on senior year," Cranston
said.
