# Lenient stop-out plan lets students explore
## 
### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
Sometimes the most important education a
college student can get takes place far outside
the classroom.
Whether traveling to foreign countries,
working in the "real world" or determining
one's priorities, taking time off from the every
day bustle of school can be essential for a true
liberal arts experience.
Fortunately for those students wanting to
take time off from their four-or-so years of
schooling, Stanford has a lenient stop-out pol
icy which allows students to return to campus
anytime they wish.
A small number of students take advantage
of this each year, according to Joe Mayer, spe
cial registration assistant. "It is for under
graduate students. They have the right to
annul quarters on the basis of their request."
Stopping out for both winter and spring
quarters of last year, senior Alison Hart re
turned home to Oklahoma to work and then
traveled to Europe with a friend. During this
time she re-thought her future plans.
"I stopped out because I was a junior pre
in ed and I wasn't sure I wanted to go to med
school," said Hart. "I wanted time to think
about it."
She said she had always enjoyed writing,
but pursuing it as a career had sounded like "a
crazy idea." As she took time off from her stud
ies, Hart said she realized "that's not so crazy

after all."
Now back at Stan
ford, Hart is still ma
joring in biology be
cause she said chang
ing majors now would
be difficult. But she is
taking English classes
and plans to pursue
publishing as a ca
reer, with writing on
the side.
Hart said Stan
ford's stop-out policy
made a big difference
for her. "Without it I
would have been mis
erable. I would have
floundered through,"
she said. "Or I might
have dropped out. I
don't know."

Unlike Hart's expe
rience, taking time off from school reinforced
fifth-year senior Kenn Dunn's career goals. He
stopped out during fall quarter this year to in
tern at the Free Medical Clinic of Greater
Cleveland, primarily because an internship is
required for the human biology mqjor.
His experience turned out to be much more
than a fulfillment of a requirement. Dunn
worked as a medical practitioner, which in
cluded seeing his own patients, working in the
lab, drawing blood, moderating substance

abuse support groups, working with HIV-pos
itive clients and counseling HIV patients at a
runaway center.
Dunn said he considers himself very lucky
to have stumbled into the internship. "It was
one of the most amazing experiences I have
ever had in my life," he said.
Dunn added that he is sure he wants to go
into public health, and the internship helped
reaffirm this desire for him.
