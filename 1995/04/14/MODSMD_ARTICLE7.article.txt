# Lenient stop-out plan lets students explore
## 
### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
Sometimes the most important education a
college student can get takes place far outside
the classroom.
Whether traveling to foreign countries,
working in the "real world" or determining
one's priorities, taking time off from the every
day bustle of school can be essential for a true
liberal arts experience.
Fortunately for those students wanting to
take time off from their four-or-so years of
schooling, Stanford has a lenient stop-out pol
icy which allows students to return to campus
anytime they wish.
A small number of students take advantage
of this each year, according to Joe Mayer, spe
cial registration assistant. "It is for under
graduate students. They have the right to
annul quarters on the basis of their request."
Stopping out for both winter and spring
quarters of last year, senior Alison Hart re
turned home to Oklahoma to work and then
traveled to Europe with a friend. During this
time she re-thought her future plans.
"I stopped out because I was a junior pre
in ed and I wasn't sure I wanted to go to med
school," said Hart. "I wanted time to think
about it."
She said she had always enjoyed writing,
but pursuing it as a career had sounded like "a
crazy idea." As she took time off from her stud
ies, Hart said she realized "that's not so crazy

after all."
Now back at Stan
ford, Hart is still ma
joring in biology be
cause she said chang
ing majors now would
be difficult. But she is
taking English classes
and plans to pursue
publishing as a ca
reer, with writing on
the side.
Hart said Stan
ford's stop-out policy
made a big difference
for her. "Without it I
would have been mis
erable. I would have
floundered through,"
she said. "Or I might
have dropped out. I
don't know."

Unlike Hart's expe
rience, taking time off from school reinforced
fifth-year senior Kenn Dunn's career goals. He
stopped out during fall quarter this year to in
tern at the Free Medical Clinic of Greater
Cleveland, primarily because an internship is
required for the human biology mqjor.
His experience turned out to be much more
than a fulfillment of a requirement. Dunn
worked as a medical practitioner, which in
cluded seeing his own patients, working in the
lab, drawing blood, moderating substance

abuse support groups, working with HIV-pos
itive clients and counseling HIV patients at a
runaway center.
Dunn said he considers himself very lucky
to have stumbled into the internship. "It was
one of the most amazing experiences I have
ever had in my life," he said.
Dunn added that he is sure he wants to go
into public health, and the internship helped
reaffirm this desire for him.

"l needed to come down from
the ivory tower that I consider
Stanford to be," Dunn said. "I
wanted to apply what I'd learned
and see how it fit into the real
world."
Senior Nicole Lindermayr also
stopped out last year during spring
quarter. During winter quarter,
she participated in Stanford's
overseas program in Berlin, and
stayed through the spring as the
recipient of a Krupp internship.
While in Germany, Lindermayr
worked in the Berlin Senate, deal
ing with foreign affairs. Double
majoring in international rela
tions and German, she said her
experience in Germany helped
determine her future goals. "I
want to go into international busi
ness and deal in free trade issues
at the policy level," she said.
Stanford's unusual flexibility
Hart, Dunn and Lindermayr all
agreed that the Stanford stop-out
policy is flexible. Lindermayr said
it was just a matter of "not regis

tering."
"Students can stop out pretty
easily here. There is no leave of
absence form required, and theo
retically they can stop out for as
long as they want," Mayer said.
He added that he has seen under
graduates who stopped out in the
1950s come back to complete their
degree.
Not all universities are as flexi
ble as Stanford with students who
wish to take a leave of absence.
Albert Lucero, a student affairs
officer at UC-Berkeley, said,
"Anytime folks want to take time
off at Berkeley, they have to apply
for re-admission. Generally speak
ing, as long as they are in good
standing, they can re-admit."
Penny Hein-Unruh, the inter
departmental coordinator for the
College of Letters and Science
Counseling at UCLA, said, "As far
as students taking time off, as
long as they have a 2.0 GPA over
all, they are free to leave and
allowed to return at any time."
However, Hein-Unruh contin
ued, "If they are gone for more
than one quarter, they must file
for re-admission and pay a mini
mal fee."
Students at Harvard Universi

ty may have a much harder time
taking time off than at some
schools on the West Coast.
Susan Green, the public infor
mation officer at Harvard, said in
order for students to take a leave
of absence, they "must petition
the administrative board. Leaves
will usually be granted if their
record is satisfactory."
If students decide to leave after
the semester has already begun,
however, they are charged with
tuition, room and board for the
remainder of the term, Green
said.
In order to come back, the stu
dents must notify Harvard's regis
trar eight weeks before the new
term begins. Green said students
must also write an essay on how
their time has been spent away
from campus and provide evi
dence that they are ready to
resume schooling. This may
include a letter of recommenda
tion from an employer if the stu
dent was working during the time
away from campus, according to
Green.
"Not many students do take
time off just to travel or do other
things that the university may see
as frivolous," she said.
