Tuesday, April 18, 4:00 pm, Donald
Kennedy Room, Haas Center.
Co-sponsored with Women's Herstory Month
"SCHOOL DAYS WORK DAYS:
MAKING THE TRANSITION AND
CREATING THE CLIMATE FOR
PERSONAL AND SOCIAL CHANGE"
An angry world, injustice, epidemics, loss of
open space, poor air quality, no money, and not
enough time - has the world go you down? Ms.
Leicester will outline successful strategies to
create a climate for change in you and your
communities. She will share perspectives on
developing her management style and non
traditional educational programs in what has
been a predominantly white, male organization.
She will invite audience discussion on how
communication and management skills labeled
"female" are critical in today's rapidly changing
and challenging world.
Wednesday, April 19, 6:30 pm.
Humanities Center Annex
"WOMEN'S PERSPECTIVES ON
LINKING LAND AND PEOPLE"
An informal discussion and dinner focusing on
non-traditional methods of land management
and preservation using education and
community outreach rather than the "technical"
side of land management. In addition to Marti,
the following will be joining us as well:
B.J. Griffin, Superintendent of Yosemite
National Park
Marcia McNally, Bay Area Ridge Trail Council
and Partner in Community Development by
Design
Judith Knofsky, Yosemite Restoration Trust
While on the Stanford campus from April 17-20, Marti will be meeting with students
in a variety of forums, discussing community outreach and organizing strategies,
constituency building, multi-media communications, volunteer management - skills
and strategies that can be applied to organizing any public service program. Whether
you and/or your organization would like to "talk strategy", exchange ideas, or simply
chat with Marti, give us a call at 723-9181 and ask for Jackie.
