Tuesday, May 9.1995
It didn't take long to finger all the usual suspects. Yesterday's
development tools. Bum utilities. Chintzy applications software. The
enterprise was destined for trouble from Day One.
m
Luckily. I'm on the case. I work with the pros at Symantec, a class
operation specializing in mysteries of the enterprise kind. We're racking
our brains over open applications software. Next-generation 3GL and
4GL technology Not to mention leading-edge utilities, our claim to
fame. And hey. we'reigood. But we won't celebrate until we become
the single source for a total enterprise solution.
That's where you come in. Together, we can bring the enterprise up to
standard and make it safe for computing again. Arc you with me!?
