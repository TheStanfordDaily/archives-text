Pope appeals to war victims
VATICAN CITY (AP) — Embracing the vic
tims of unrest, Pope John Paul II sent a mes
sage of peace Easter Sunday to people seeking
"recognition of their deepest aspirations,"
including the Palestinians and Kurds.
In his traditional address from the balcony of
St. Peter's Basilica, the pope directed his mes
sage to the people of Algeria, Bosnia-Herzegov
ina, Burundi and southern Sudan.
"To families torn apart by war, to the victims
of hatred and violence . . . the Church does not
hesitate to renew the Paschal message of peace,
reminding everyone of our common origin in the
one God," he said.
More than 50,000 people filled St. Peter's
Square under an icy drizzle. An ocean of
umbrellas covered the square, brightened by
splashes of color from azaleas, tulips and rhodo

dendron.
Wilson raises quick $8 million
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov. Pete Wilson took
a giant step last week toward gaining a place in
the top tier of candidates for the Republican nom
ination for president.
Three days of telephone calls by nearly 100
Wilson supporters produced over $8.1 million in
pledges to his presidential campaign.
There is a big difference between pledges and
cash in the bank. But the high number is still a
phenomenal accomplishment which demon
strates why Wilson has drawn so much attention
despite low name recognition and even lower
ranking in polls.
Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas is the runaway lead
er in fund raising at $16.7 million, including $8.5
million raised this year. But Gramm is a distant
second in polls to Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas.
