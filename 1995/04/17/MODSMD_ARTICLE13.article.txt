HEBRON, West Bank (AP) -
Israeli security forces ambushed
and shot dead three Palestini
ans yesterday who the army said
were en route to a planned
attack on Israelis.
As the army clamped a cur
few on nearby Hebron, leaders
and supporters of the Hamas
fundamentalist group to which
the men belonged said others
would take their places and con
tinue attacking Israelis.
"If you think you killed three
Hamas people then you are mis
taken," Marwan Abu Shuker
shouted at Israelis checking the
bodies. "We are all Hamas. The
whole city is Hamas."
Abu Shuker, 35, who lives
next to the ambush site, said the
Israelis were dressed as Arabs
and ambushed the men as they

drove through an olive grove,
firing "until they were sure the
Palestinians were dead."
The Israeli army
spokesman's office said security
forces clashed with a "terrorist
cell" and three Palestinians
were killed.
"Preliminary reports show
the terrorists were on their way
to carry out an attack," the
statement said, adding that two
assault rifles, ammunition, a
pistol and Israeli army uniforms
were found in the car.
The Israeli army identified
the dead as Adel Falah, 23, and
Jihad Ghulmeh, 25 — both
wanted men — and 22-year-old
Tarek Natche.
Maj. Gen. Ilan Biran, Israel's
top West Bank commander, said
the men were suspected of sev

eral attacks, including a shoot
ing on a bus last month in which
two settlers were killed.
Islamic militants have killed
65 Israelis since October. The
attacks are aimed at derailing
Israel-PLO talks on expanding
Palestinian self-rule set up in
the Gaza Strip and West Bank
district of Jericho last May.
Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin said Israel would contin
ue its battle against Hamas in
the Hebron area. He said he
believed that Yehiya Ayash, a
Palestinian chemist who tops
Israel's wanted list, was in
Gaza.
"He is alive and active (and)
will try and continue to attack
us, but as every guerrilla finds
his end, so will he," Rabin told
Israel television.
