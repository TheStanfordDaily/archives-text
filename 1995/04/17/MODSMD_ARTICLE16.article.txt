Proposed special-fee
reform is confusing,
should not be passed

ALTHOUGH THE special-fee
system works well enough
given its mission — to poll
students and fund groups they
support — many feel that its prob
lems need to be remedied.
However the "Common Sense
Fee Reform Amendment" on the
ballot in this week's ASSU elec
tions is a poorly-conceived and con
fusing constitutional change that
students should not support. Even
ASSU legislators appear to not
understand the difference between
the text of a constitutional amend
ment and the bill that puts it on
the ballot — both appear in the
elections handbook under the
amendment title.
The main thrust of the amend
ment is fairly simple. If passed,
student groups would, beginning
next year, have to decide whether
they want to be funded by one of
three "populations" within the
Stanford community — graduates
only, undergraduates only or all
students.
This is fairly logical. Groups will
have to decide whether they want
to approach graduate students for
funding and will probably be more
responsive to that sector of the
population if it supports the spe
cial-fee request.
However an item tacked on at the
end of the bill that placed this
amendment on the ballot is trou
bling. It is not clear whether this
item — which would force the
ASSU Senate to "enact appropriate
By-Law changes, including the elim
ination of the Fee Refund Buffer" —
is considered part of the amendment
that students are voting on.
To those not familiar with ASSU
technical terms, the fee-refund
buffer is the amount that the
ASSU tacks on to special-fee
requests to compensate for fund
ing lost due to refunds. If this
amendment passes, student
groups would be encouraged to
insert another line item in their
budgets to "add to [the group's]
reserves for future expenses" or to
"offset expected fee refunds."
The comments above are actual
ly not part of the amendment; they
are included in an "executive sum
mary" of the proposal given to the
senate. Fortunately, this summary

sheds light on the problems with
this bill. Unfortunately, it was not
included in the poorly produced
ASSU Elections Handbook.
The sponsors of this bill are
approaching this problem in the
wrong way — they hope that the
electorate will pass a flawed consti
tutional amendment and promise
to go back to fix the problems later.
Based on previous campaign
promises from ASSU senators,
we're not going to hold our breath.
First of all, the item is mislead
ing. The fee refund buffer is not
going anywhere; it would just be
made a budget line item so the
ASSU financial manager would be
no longer be responsible for setting
the buffer level.
Second, the change is dangerous.
Student groups are already given
inadequate oversight and advice
from the ASSU during the budget
writing process. Allowing groups to
decide how much they need to off
set expected refunds is unfairly
shifting another burden on them.
Finally, this amendment would
effectively punish groups that
choose to request funding from
both undergraduates and gradu
ates. The ASSU currently caps
increases in special-fee requests
(outside the special-fee buffer) at
10 percent a year. Groups that
desire to exceed that increase must
go through difficult petition pro
cesses. Groups that are funded by
both populations would undoubt
edly suffer from a higher refund
rates than groups that only
approach undergraduates.
For reference, the winter refund
rate of 22 percent was largely due
to graduate students: 45 percent of
grads took refunds, compared with
just 15 percent of undergrads.
Supporters argue that the sen
ate could make exceptions for
groups that suffer from higher
refund rates, yet the summary
claims that the amendment would
eliminate "the bureaucracy and
senate involvement in setting the
special fee buffer rate." Giving the
senate — as opposed to the non
partisan financial manager — the
power to effectively limit the size of
a student group's buffer level is
dangerous.
Although this amendment
enjoys wide support from the sen
ate, and the underlying concept is
good, the document is poorly writ
ten, poorly presented and in points
seems half-baked.
Students should reject it and
demand that the senate come back
with a better proposal next year.
