Changing bylaw to an
amendment will ensure
informed student body

IT'S HARD TO argue against
the merits of freedom of infor
mation, and it's hard to argue
against the "Freedom of Informa
tion Amendment" to the ASSU
Constitution.
The amendment is very simple.
It makes a previously existing por
tion of the ASSU Bylaws a part of
the constitution. While the effects
of this move may be minimal —
the ASSU Senate currently has
the power both to interpret and

overrule the bylaws as well as the
power to interpret and overrule
the constitution — the value of the
freedom of information bylaw is
clear. The statement is worthy of
becoming a permanent amend
ment to the ASSU Constitution.
Similar to the Freedom of Infor
mation Act passed by the U.S.
Congress, this amendment would
make all documents of the ASSU
available to the public, with the
exception of certain types of pro
prietary information from ASSU
business projects, financial
records, records from the ASSU
Legal Counseling office and per
sonnel records.
This amendment is simple and
fair. Students should approve it.
