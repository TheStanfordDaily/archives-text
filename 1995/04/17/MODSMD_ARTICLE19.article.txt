## There’s no place like home 
### 
IT'S PROBABLY the place where life's
a little more settled than Stanford,
where you had your first kiss and
where people remember you for what you
did back in high school. It's a place where
you can step back into the identity of
your former self. At least while we're in
college we can go back and hang out with
family and friends as if all those stressful
days of studying on the Farm never hap
pened. Home sweet home.
Driving toward home slowly brings us
into familiar surroundings. Businesses,
houses and streets trigger vivid flickering
memories of events not so long ago. The
DMV office where you nervously succeed
ed in securing that first driver's license.
The high school gym where your team
pulled out the close one. The flashes from
the past and the physical sensation of
actually being home again produce a spe
cial contentedness because we know we
can forever claim this place as our home
town.
As we travel beyond the city limits to
go to school — to begin living our adult
lives — some of us get irrationally nostal
gic (especially those of us from Colorado;
don't even try arguing with us because
everything inevitably has a better coun
terpart in Colorado). When we actually
do go back, things may not be as rosy as
we remembered from afar, but it's great
nonetheless just because it's home. Even
ice cream at the local Dairy Queen tastes
better. Home is special, either because it
made us who we are or because we were

able to overcome its limitations!
Yet as much as we preserve the ideal
image of our hometown in our minds, in
reality it doesn't remain static. The new
supermarket on the corner where that
field used to be alerts me of the time that
has passed since the glory days. The
freshmen in high school look younger
each time back. Sleepy corners have a
way of disappearing in our world. Life
marches forward in the places of our
youth while we're away becoming what
we want to be when we grow up.
While it is easy to slip into old roles, at
times I feel like an interloper coming
back home. I've got this other life now
faraway at school. People will ask me
about what I'm doing at Stanford, but
after the easy questions like "How do you
like Stanford?" and "What are you major
ing in?" the conversation stalls. When I
go back to the barbershop the conversa
tion rarely makes it that far. I don't
mind. It's fun to argue with the guys
about how the Denver Broncos will do
next year. The intellectual me is best kept
locked inside until I get back to poli sci
section.
We leave after high school as innocent
kids and thrust ourselves in the ideology
free-for-all at college. What we believe
and hold sacred gets all shaken up, even
if we do eventually keep the lessons
learned from childhood close to heart.
With our enlightened (and maybe still
confused) convictions, we come home
where everyone's more set in their ways.

It's straight from "Back to the Future":
Do I dare mess up the space-time contin
uum by opening my mouth and mind to
everyone at home? I wouldn't want to
eschew the easy flow of reality for my
dear-old hometown.
I toe the balance between Stanford
sophomore and home-grown kid. I
become the hybrid of different experi
ences. Eighteen happenstance years of
instruction from my parents, Little
League coaches and friends who grew up
next to me. And now who-knows-how
many self-decided years of learning from
Stanford professors, students from
around the world and future colleagues
in my career of choice. As an internation
al relations major it's doubtful I'll ever
come back to pay property taxes in my
hometown nestled against the Rockies in
northern Colorado.
So I must be content to come home as
a visitor now. I am revitalized by the vista
of the mountains in the morning as I saw
them before school all those years. We all
have those oh-so-familiar images burned
in our brains no matter where we're
from. I look around slowly and know that
this will forever be my home town.
