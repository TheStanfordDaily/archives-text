## New program SATAN could be to blame in computer crimes 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Two recent computer-related
crimes on campus have left au
thorities with few leads to find the
electronic criminals.
An incident of computer hack
ing may have occurred at the Her
rin Biology Lab, but police are still
unclear as to whether a hacker is
to blame.
On April 9, between 7:30 p.m.
and 10:30 p.m., computer supervi
sors were alerted by someone try
ing to access the system from Es
cor.dido Village, Stanford Police
Sgt. John McMullen said.
It later turned out that this was
a legitimate access, but system su
pervisors also discovered that
other files were scrambled, Mc-
Mullen said.
Carl Bergstrom, a graduate
student in the Department of Bio
logical Sciences who reported the
incident, told police that he sus
pected the new SATAN program
may have been involved, Mc-
Mullen said.

The SATAN program, which
stands for System Administrators
Tool for Analyzing Networks, is
used by computer experts to probe
for leaks in their network's securi
ty â€” but it can also be used by
hackers to find holes for gaining il
legal access into unprotected sys
tems. The program is available for
free over the Internet from nu
merous sites.
Bergstrom declined to com
ment on the incident.
If administrators don't use the
SATAN program first, "the hack
ers will use it to break into the sys
tem," McMullen said.
The incident at the Herrin Lab
is especially puzzling because it is
not apparent which gateway the
hacker entered through, Mc-
Mullen said.
"Typically, you can find a way
that someone got in and did some
thing," McMullen said. In this
case, "it's kind of a mystery," he
said.
