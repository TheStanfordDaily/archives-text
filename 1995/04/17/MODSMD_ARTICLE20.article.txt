THANK YOU for choosing to cover
"Once on this Island," Ram's
Head Theatrical Society's spring
show, in your April 13 edition of Inter
mission. We always appreciate seeing
the campus' continued interest in our
production. Unfortunately, your article
contained several errors and misrepre
sentations of this year's production.
Many cast and staff members were
displeased at their representation in the
article. Karen Brecher, the show's direc
tor, was egregiously misquoted through
out the article most notably in the open
ing paragraphs. We can assure you that
Brecher will be in attendance on opening
night as well as all other performances.
Although a director's duties may end
with the final dress rehearsal, her
responsibility to the production is unfin
ished until the last curtain.
Many of producer Laura Wilson's
words were taken out of context, includ
ing a number of comments which she
said she didn't want in the article. Your
characterization of her as a mother hen
is based entirely on a term that she told
you "she would hate to use."
The article also confused some issues
of race in casting. Director Karen Brech
er clearly stated in your article that cast
ing was "completely merit-based." How
ever, the article tries to refute this with
another statement applauding Brecher
for "casting the principals with people of
color." The Daily never took an honest
look at the 11 (not eight) featured roles
and the ensemble, which includes people
from all races, not just blacks and
whites. This show has our most ethni
cally diverse cast yet, and Brecher was
correct to say that they were all chosen
on the basis of their individual talents

and "nothing to do with race."
Furthermore, the article paints an
inaccurate picture of the rehearsal pro
cess, focusing on expletives and strip
teases rather than the three hundred
odd hours of intense dance training,
vocal reviews, and technical rehearsals
to which the cast has dedicated their
past four months.
Most important, the show runs April
14, 15, 20, 21, and 22, as printed, but
the second weekend is Thursday
through Saturday, not Friday through
Sunday.
These errors are all the more disap
pointing since we provided The Daily
several weeks in advance, by regular
mail and e-mail, a press packet contain
ing accurate information, rehearsal pho
tographs and quotes from staff and cast
members about the show. No materials
from this packet were used in the Inter
mission article.
We were particularly unamused by
the intimation that our requests to read
The Daily's articles early are petulant.
Clearly, the profusion of errors in not
only this article but the entire season's
coverage of Ram's Head productions
illustrates the severe inadequacies of
The Daily's editing and proofreading
process. So long as we continue to find
the need to write letters like this one, we
will continue to request early copies of
The Daily's coverage.
