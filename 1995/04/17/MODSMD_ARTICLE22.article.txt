But University Accounting Offi
cer Chris Canellos said he has told
Howe for two years that the Direc
tory clearly must pay tax on its sur
plus revenue.
Taxable revenues
Canellos said the surplus rev
enues of the Directory are taxable
as "unrelated business income,"
which is assessed when non-profit
organizations conduct business
unrelated to their charters.
A portion of the Directory's
income would fall under this cate
goiy, since the publication must
pay tax on its surplus revenue from
certain types of advertising, Canel
los added.
"We knew we might have to pay
taxes [in 19921, but it wasn't clear
if the Directory fit into that catego
ry" of unrelated business income,
Howe said.
Canellos said, however, that he
has been sending "a consistent
message" for two years that Direc
tory revenue falls under the unre
lated business income category.
The rules governing unrelated
business income state that "income
from advertising is unrelated busi
ness income and is therefore not
exempt from tax," said A 1 a
tax attorney at the San Francisco
firm of Steefel, Levitt and Weiss.
Howe said confusion about the
status of the Directory's income
was due to how the publication
spends its surplus revenue.
But both Canellos and Levitt
said the manner in which the
Directory's surplus revenue is

spent is irrelevant in determining
whether it should be classified as
unrelated business income.
"The unrelated business income
rules are very clear," Canellos said.
"The destination of the money is
not relevant. The source of the
money is what counts."
The University itself may have
violated federal and state tax laws
by failing to report the income of
the Directory. If the Directory is
considered a part of the University,
the Directory's surplus revenue
should be included in the Universi
ty's overall unrelated business
income calculation, Canellos said.
Control confusion
But whether the Directory can
be classified as a University publi
cation is under dispute.
For tax purposes, control is
determined by who governs the
organization and who receives the
money, Canellos said.
Under the directive of the Office
of Student Activities, the Directory
currently uses the ASSU banking
services and the ASSU tax code
number instead of the correspond
ing University services, said former
Directory Business Manager
Stephen Russell, a junior.
But according to a memoran
dum issued by the Office of Stu
dent Activities, the Directory "is a
University project managed by the
Office of Student Activities."
Former Directory Business
Manager Mark Belanger, who
graduated last year, agreed with
this description, saying the
Directory is a University publica
tion.
Despite the memo issued from
her office, Howe disagreed, claim

ing the Directory is a voluntary
student organization registered
with her office.
According to the 1994-95 Hand
book for Stanford Student Organi
zations, "All organizational deci
sions" for voluntary student
groups "must be made by Stanford
students. Others may serve in an
advisory role, but cannot lead or
direct the organization's activities
in any way."
The Directory, Howe said, "is
overseen by the Dean of Students
Office." The memo from Student
Activities also states, "While a
great deal of daily independence on
the part of the Directory staff is
desired, Directory management
staff are expected to consult with
the Office of Student Activities
about all major decisions."
The memorandum additionally
states that all payroll expenditures,
petty cash receipts, individual
reimbursements and capital expen
ditures must be approved by the
Office of Student Activities.
Directory members also cannot
control their surplus revenues, said
ASSU Supervisor Linda Whit
comb. The University's control of
Directory finances stems from the
fact that it provides the informa
tion the publication prints on facul
ty, staff and student addresses and
phone numbers, she said.
Current surplus Directory rev
enues pay for the operating expens
es of Lake Lagunita — including
the purchase of sand, lifeguards'
salaries and trash removal service
— as a result of an agreement
made between the ASSU and the
Dean of Students Office, Howe
said. Students could propose other
uses for the surplus money, but she
would have to approve them.
