Stanford 7

Stanford women's tennis (18-2
overall, 7-0 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference's Southern Division)
stood firmly as no mirage for the
desert squads from Arizona (16-5,
5-4) and Arizona State (13-8, 2-7)
this weekend. The seventh
ranked Cardinal refused to disap
pear down the stretch as they put
down the fifth-ranked Wildcats 7-
2 and the eight-ranked Sun Devils
7-2 at the Stanford Tennis Stadi
um, clinching at least a tie for
their eight straight Pac-10 South
championship.
"I don't know if we're peaking
right now, but we're definitely
getting better," said Stanford
head coach Frank Brennan.
"We're on a good run. . .. Hope
fully, we'll peak right around May
12 [the date of the NCAA champi
onships)."
Saturday's upset of the Wild
cats ended their streak of six con
secutive dual match victories and
— combined with some other
losses among the nation's top
teams — may have catapulted
Stanford back into the top three

ranked teams.
"It's always comfortable to see
your name in the top three,"
Brennan said. "But the NCAA
will do their own rankings come
tournament time and those are
the ones we have to worry about.
There are about six teams that
are really even and it'll be a mat
ter of who is playing the loosest in
Pepperdine [the site of the NCAA
tournament]."
The Cardinal swept all three
doubles matches and won four of
six singles matches in cruising to
their seventh straight dual-match
win. Rain forced the termination
of the match indoors to the Bay
Courts at Fremont. The Cardinal
was close to clinching the victory
in singles as freshman Julie Scott
and sophomore Melody Falco bat
tled through a light drizzle in the
No. 5 match. When Falco slipped
on her way to a return early in the
game at 6-2, 1-6, 5-5, officials
postponed the match with Stan
ford leading 4-1.
Falco pulled out the match in
Fremont, outlasting Scott in a tie
breaker 7-2 and forcing the dou-

bles competition. Scott and Falco,
despite being close friends, put
relations behind them, as neither
seemed to be willing to concede.
Falco will be transferring to
Scott's hometown University of
Texas next year, joining a promi
nent program in Austin.
"It's almost easier to play
against friends because you know
it will be a fair match," said Scott.
"You don't hold anything against
them after you get off the court.
Win or lose, you still have your
friendship."
The win represented Falco's
12th win in 13 attempts, a streak
that began directly after Scott
downed her 6-4, 6-4 earlier this
season in Tucson.
"I definitely think I played
better than I did in Tucson,"
said Falco. "It's also pretty
inspiring to play at Stanford
because of its tennis tradition. I
was pretty pumped up, and I
really felt good since I had been
playing so well."
Stanford dominated in the
doubles play. At the No. 1 match,
sophomore Katie Schlukebir and
freshman Ania Bleszynski (11-3)
upset the No. 4 team in the
nation, Vicky Maes and Eva
Marie Schurhoff, 6-4, 6-4 in
straight sets. That seemed the
norm on the indoor courts yester
day as the Nos. 2 and 3 Stanford
squads also walked off with
straight set victories.

Falco and Stephanie Sammar

tiano 6-4, 6-4 as well, while Scott
and senior Amy Chiminello (9-2)
bulldozed Erin Pavelko and
Angela Bernal, 6-2, 6-1. Stanford
doubles went undefeated for the
weekend, winning all of their six
matches in straight sets.
Chiminello got even less of a
workout from Pavelko at No. 6
singles. She exited without break
ing a sweat, winning twelve
straight games for a 6-0, 6-0 wipe
out.
At the No. 1 match, Schlukebir
(13-6) sweated out a 7-6 tie
breaker win in the first set which
saw the Stanford All-American
come back from a 6-5 deficit in
the set and a 3-1 deficit in the tie
breaker. Schlukebir then proved
to be too much for Maes in the
second set, taking the match 7-6,
6-2.
Shasby (14-4), behind the sup
port of the crowd, continued her
torrid play with a 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 vic
tory over Schurhoff at the No. 2
slot. Shasby, the fan favorite, and
Bleszynski switched positions for
the match as Shasby had defeated
Schurhoff previously in tourna
ment play while going 1-2 against
Sammartiano, who played in the
No. 3 slot.
Sammartiano looked tough in
that spot, downing Bleszynski (9-
7) in straight sets, 6-1, 6-4.
Sophomore Sandra De Silva (16-
2), quietly posting phenomenal
numbers, fought off a late bid for
a third set by Angela Bernal in
holding on in the second, 6-3, 7-6.
The Cardinal played a similar
match on the previous day versus
the Sun Devils as it took a 4-2
lead into doubles play, as it has
for the last three matches.
Despite the absence of ASU's No.

1 player Kori Davidson due to a
knee injury, Stanford dropped the
first two singles matches but
brought out the brooms for the
back four singles matches and all
three of the doubles.
Arizona State's Joelle Schad
upset Schlukebir, utilizing power
ful groundstrokes to tire the
Stanford sophomore. Schlukebir
took the first set but could not
find the groove for the rest of the
match, falling, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2. Sun
Devil Reka Cserenyes also was
more than Bleszynski could chew
as she dropped the No. 2 match,
6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
The Cardinal was virtually
unstoppable in the bottom four
matches, three of its victories
coming in straight sets. Shasby
typified that trend with a 6-1, 6-0
blowout of Kara Schertzer.
De Silva followed in the No. 4
match, defending the home court
with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 victory over
Stephanie Lansdorp. Scott and
Chiminello breezed past their
opponents for straight set victo
ries at 6-1, 6-4, and 6-2, 6-3,
respectively.
Stanford began its dominant
doubles weekend stand as
Bleszynski and Schlukebir
bounced back from their singles
defeats for a 6-4, 6-1 win over
Moll and Schertzer. Shasby and
Burt took the No. 2 match against
Cseresnyes, 6-2, 7-5. Scott and
Chiminello completed the sweep
at No. 3, hanging on for a 6-4, 7-6
tie-breaker triumph.
"They're [the doubles teams]
getting better and better," Bren
nan said. "We've made a switch
with the Nos. 2 and 3 teams, and
that seems to be working out
fine."

"They're [the doubles teams]
getting better and better," Bren
nan said. "We've made a switch
with the Nos. 2 and 3 teams, and
that seems to be working out
fine."

Stanford women's tennis (18-2
overall, 7-0 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference's Southern Division)
stood firmly as no mirage for the
desert squads from Arizona (16-5,
5-4) and Arizona State (13-8, 2-7)
this weekend. The seventh
ranked Cardinal refused to disap
pear down the stretch as they put
down the fifth-ranked Wildcats 7-
2 and the eight-ranked Sun Devils
7-2 at the Stanford Tennis Stadi
um, clinching at least a tie for
their eight straight Pac-10 South
championship.
"I don't know if we're peaking
right now, but we're definitely
getting better," said Stanford
head coach Frank Brennan.
"We're on a good run. . .. Hope
fully, we'll peak right around May
12 [the date of the NCAA champi
onships)."
Saturday's upset of the Wild
cats ended their streak of six con
secutive dual match victories and
— combined with some other
losses among the nation's top
teams — may have catapulted

ranked teams.
"It's always comfortable to see
your name in the top three,"
Brennan said. "But the NCAA
will do their own rankings come
tournament time and those are
the ones we have to worry about.
There are about six teams that
are really even and it'll be a mat
ter of who is playing the loosest in
Pepperdine [the site of the NCAA
tournament]."
The Cardinal swept all three
doubles matches and won four of
six singles matches in cruising to
their seventh straight dual-match
win. Rain forced the termination
of the match indoors to the Bay
Courts at Fremont. The Cardinal
was close to clinching the victory
in singles as freshman Julie Scott
and sophomore Melody Falco bat
tled through a light drizzle in the
No. 5 match. When Falco slipped
on her way to a return early in the
game at 6-2, 1-6, 5-5, officials
postponed the match with Stan
ford leading 4-1.
Falco pulled out the match in
Fremont, outlasting Scott in a tie
breaker 7-2 and forcing the dou-

bles competition. Scott and Falco,
despite being close friends, put
relations behind them, as neither
seemed to be willing to concede.
Falco will be transferring to
Scott's hometown University of
Texas next year, joining a promi
nent program in Austin.
"It's almost easier to play
against friends because you know
it will be a fair match," said Scott.
"You don't hold anything against
them after you get off the court.
Win or lose, you still have your
friendship."
The win represented Falco's
12th win in 13 attempts, a streak
that began directly after Scott
downed her 6-4, 6-4 earlier this
season in Tucson.
"I definitely think I played
better than I did in Tucson,"
said Falco. "It's also pretty
inspiring to play at Stanford
because of its tennis tradition. I
was pretty pumped up, and I
really felt good since I had been
playing so well."
Stanford dominated in the
doubles play. At the No. 1 match,
sophomore Katie Schlukebir and
freshman Ania Bleszynski (11-3)
upset the No. 4 team in the
nation, Vicky Maes and Eva
Marie Schurhoff, 6-4, 6-4 in
straight sets. That seemed the
norm on the indoor courts yester
day as the Nos. 2 and 3 Stanford
squads also walked off with
straight set victories.
Senior Kim Shasby and sopho
more Emily Burt (9-2) defeated
Falco and Stephanie Sammar

tiano 6-4, 6-4 as well, while Scott
and senior Amy Chiminello (9-2)
bulldozed Erin Pavelko and
Angela Bernal, 6-2, 6-1. Stanford
doubles went undefeated for the
weekend, winning all of their six
matches in straight sets.
Chiminello got even less of a
workout from Pavelko at No. 6
singles. She exited without break
ing a sweat, winning twelve
straight games for a 6-0, 6-0 wipe
out.
At the No. 1 match, Schlukebir
(13-6) sweated out a 7-6 tie
breaker win in the first set which
saw the Stanford All-American
come back from a 6-5 deficit in
the set and a 3-1 deficit in the tie
breaker. Schlukebir then proved
to be too much for Maes in the
second set, taking the match 7-6,
6-2.
Shasby (14-4), behind the sup
port of the crowd, continued her
torrid play with a 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 vic
tory over Schurhoff at the No. 2
slot. Shasby, the fan favorite, and
Bleszynski switched positions for
the match as Shasby had defeated
Schurhoff previously in tourna
ment play while going 1-2 against
Sammartiano, who played in the
No. 3 slot.
Sammartiano looked tough in
that spot, downing Bleszynski (9-
7) in straight sets, 6-1, 6-4.
Sophomore Sandra De Silva (16-
2), quietly posting phenomenal
numbers, fought off a late bid for
a third set by Angela Bernal in
holding on in the second, 6-3, 7-6.
The Cardinal played a similar
match on the previous day versus
the Sun Devils as it took a 4-2
lead into doubles play, as it has
for the last three matches.
Despite the absence of ASU's No.

1 player Kori Davidson due to a
knee injury, Stanford dropped the
first two singles matches but
brought out the brooms for the
back four singles matches and all
three of the doubles.
Arizona State's Joelle Schad
upset Schlukebir, utilizing power
ful groundstrokes to tire the
Stanford sophomore. Schlukebir
took the first set but could not
find the groove for the rest of the
match, falling, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2. Sun
Devil Reka Cserenyes also was
more than Bleszynski could chew
as she dropped the No. 2 match,
6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
The Cardinal was virtually
unstoppable in the bottom four
matches, three of its victories
coming in straight sets. Shasby
typified that trend with a 6-1, 6-0
blowout of Kara Schertzer.
De Silva followed in the No. 4
match, defending the home court
with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 victory over
Stephanie Lansdorp. Scott and
Chiminello breezed past their
opponents for straight set victo
ries at 6-1, 6-4, and 6-2, 6-3,
respectively.
Stanford began its dominant
doubles weekend stand as
Bleszynski and Schlukebir
bounced back from their singles
defeats for a 6-4, 6-1 win over
Moll and Schertzer. Shasby and
Burt took the No. 2 match against
Cseresnyes, 6-2, 7-5. Scott and
Chiminello completed the sweep
at No. 3, hanging on for a 6-4, 7-6
tie-breaker triumph.
"They're [the doubles teams]
getting better and better," Bren
nan said. "We've made a switch
with the Nos. 2 and 3 teams, and
that seems to be working out
fine."
