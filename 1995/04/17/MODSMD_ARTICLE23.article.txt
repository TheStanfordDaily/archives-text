Stanford women's tennis (18-2
overall, 7-0 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference's Southern Division)
stood firmly as no mirage for the
desert squads from Arizona (16-5,
5-4) and Arizona State (13-8, 2-7)
this weekend. The seventh
ranked Cardinal refused to disap
pear down the stretch as they put
down the fifth-ranked Wildcats 7-
2 and the eight-ranked Sun Devils
7-2 at the Stanford Tennis Stadi
um, clinching at least a tie for
their eight straight Pac-10 South
championship.
"I don't know if we're peaking
right now, but we're definitely

head coach Frank Brennan.
"We're on a good run. . .. Hope

Brennan said. "But the NCAA
will do their own rankings come

the ones we have to worry about.
There are about six teams that
are really even and it'll be a mat

Pepperdine [the site of the NCAA
tournament]."
The Cardinal swept all three
doubles matches and won four of
six singles matches in cruising to
their seventh straight dual-match
win. Rain forced the termination
of the match indoors to the Bay
Courts at Fremont. The Cardinal
was close to clinching the victory
in singles as freshman Julie Scott
and sophomore Melody Falco bat
tled through a light drizzle in the
No. 5 match. When Falco slipped
on her way to a return early in the
game at 6-2, 1-6, 5-5, officials
postponed the match with Stan
ford leading 4-1.
Falco pulled out the match in
Fremont, outlasting Scott in a tie
