The No. 3 men's volleyball wrecking crew
swung through southern California this weekend
and demolished everything in its path. On Friday,
Stanford upended Loyola Marymount 15-9, 9-15,
15-11, 15-6. The Cardinal maintained its momen
tum the next night and smashed USC 15-6, 15-9,
15-5. Stanford hopes to keep rolling all the way
through its first-round playoff match this Satur
day in Maples Pavilion.
Even though the Cardinal won game one
against LMU (7-15 overall, 4-14 in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation), the team began the
match a little slow and could not find its side-out
rhythm. However, after losing the second game,
Stanford (18-6, 14-5 in the MPSF) came back with
a vengeance to put down the feisty Lions.
"After they won their game," said sophomore
setter Stewart Chong, "we came back to the form

of intensity we had all week in practice and carried
it all the way through to USC."
