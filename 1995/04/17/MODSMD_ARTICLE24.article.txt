The No. 3 men's volleyball wrecking crew
swung through southern California this weekend
and demolished everything in its path. On Friday,
Stanford upended Loyola Marymount 15-9, 9-15,
15-11, 15-6. The Cardinal maintained its momen
tum the next night and smashed USC 15-6, 15-9,
15-5. Stanford hopes to keep rolling all the way
through its first-round playoff match this Satur
day in Maples Pavilion.
Even though the Cardinal won game one
against LMU (7-15 overall, 4-14 in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation), the team began the
match a little slow and could not find its side-out
rhythm. However, after losing the second game,
Stanford (18-6, 14-5 in the MPSF) came back with
a vengeance to put down the feisty Lions.
"After they won their game," said sophomore
setter Stewart Chong, "we came back to the form

of intensity we had all week in practice and carried
it all the way through to USC."

kills for a .230 average in the
Lions' struggle to keep pace with
Stanford. LMU also played spec
tacular defense, collecting 55
team digs. The Cardinal kept pace
with the Lions even in this cate
gory, however, by collecting 52.
The Lions attempted to stem
the Cardinal tide by focusing its
blocking scheme on Stanford star
swing hitters sophomore Matt
Fuerbringer and junior Mike
Lambert. Lambert was held to a
.152 average and Fuerbringer hit
.232. However, Stanford compen
sated by attacking with its quick
middle hitters.
"Chong did a nice job of adjust
ing and getting the ball to our
open hitters," said Stanford head
coach Ruben Nieves.
Freshman middle blocker

Keenan Whitehurst put away 14
kills for a .440 average and sopho
more middle blocker Michael
Hoefer collected 15 kills on 16
attempts for an astounding .875
hitting percentage.
Stanford continued its impres
sive offensive efficiency versus
No. 2 USC (10-12, 7-10 in the
MPSF). The Trojans only scored
20 points the entire match, large
ly because the Cardinal sided-out
56 times. Nieves pointed out that
any team able to maintain this 1-
3 ratio will rarely lose.
Whitehurst had 12 kills and hit
.733, senior middle blocker Brian
Garrett pounded nine kills for a
.692 average and Fuerbringer put
away nine balls for a .381 average.
"It was one of the most bal
anced attacks of the season,"
Nieves said.
The one player who stood out
in this balance was Lambert.
While he did not have a spectacu
lar hitting night (14 kills, .216

percentage) he led the team with
his intense play and dominating
blocking. Lambert collected 11
blocks and eight digs in the shor
space of three quick games.
"Mike came out swinging
hard," Nieves said. "His aggres
siveness, leadership and enthusi
asm set the tone for the team. He
took charge of the match at times
with his blocking."
The Trojans' Ail-American
hitter, opposite Jason Mulhol
land, could not seem to lift up his
team and get past the Stanford
wall. The Cardinal smothered

"Stewart continues to surprise
opponents with how well he ca
block," Nieves said. "His play is
one of the main reasons we came
away with two solid victories."
