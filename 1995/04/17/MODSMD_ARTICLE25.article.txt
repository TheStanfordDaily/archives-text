# Cardinal track stars shine bright at relays

### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
Maybe it was the full moon
hanging over the stadium, or per
haps it was the hot Southern Cal
ifornia air, but something at the
Mt. San Antonio College Relays
inspired great performances from
the Stanford track team.
Friday night, the suspense
came from the women's pole
vault, an event only recently con
tested but not yet accepted as a
scored collegiate event. Stanford
sent two of its best in co-Ameri
can sophomore record holder
Tyra Holt and junior hurdler
turned-vaulter Jen Dalton.
In her first attempt at 11 feet,
Dalton sprinted down the run
way, planted her pole and elevat
ed, clearing with her legs but
catching the crossbar with her
hips and missing. Dalton sat in
the pit and stared determinedly at
the standards.
Meanwhile, Holt, the favorite
as a result of a previous vault of
11-6 1/4, warmed up in the infield
in a world of her own, trying to
get 11 feet out of the way. She
stripped off her sweats and picked
up her pole. She gathered herself,
took off down the runway,
jumped into the air and missed.
A few minutes later Dalton
found herself ready for her second
attempt at 11. As she waited at
the top of the runway, a rhythmic
clapping descended from the
stands. Led by freshman decath
lete and pole vaulter Josh Glea

son, the Cardinal clapped with
every stride as Dalton approached
the standards. She planted the
pole, swung her legs forward, and
in a hushed moment gently
brushed the crossbar, but not
enough to remove it from its 11-
foot height.
Dalton stood, waved and
acknowledged the loud cheers and
applause of the crowd. She had
jumped a personal best and
secured herself second place in
the event behind leader Chelsea
Istre of the Run Tex track club.
The pressure was now on Holt,
who had been marvelous the past
few weeks in all her events. Fight
ing a cold that kept her up the
night before, Holt was competing
in both the long jump and the pole
vault on the same night. The ill
ness may have slowed her down,
as she missed her second attempt
and also her third and final
attempt at 11, leaving her in
fourth place overall.
Holt pulled on her sweats and
sat by the runway, head in hands,
wondering what went wrong. Her
chance to grab sole possession of
the American record would not
come tonight.
It was Dalton's day in the
women's pole vault. She finished
second overall, but first among
collegiate competitors.
"I felt really good clearing 11
feet — it marked a big improve
ment," Dalton said between
smiles. "I'm really happy and I

can still do better."
Dalton was quick to give credit
for her improvement to assistant
coach Casey Roche, who tirelessly
worked with the pole vaulters on
every aspect of their event.
"Without him, we wouldn't be
anywhere," she said.
Saturday was the day of
Olympians: world record holder
Leroy Burrell running in the invi
tational 100 meters and gold
medalist Carl Lewis competing in
the long jump.
Taking advantage of this high
quality atmosphere in the univer
sity open 800-meter race was Sara
Moore. She went out fast in the
first 100 then settled into a com
fortable third position in the first
circuit of the track. As the bell
rang for the final lap, Brigham
Young's Ashley Monahna tried to
pass on the inside, but Moore held
her position and made her move
on the leader, UC-Davis's Suzy
Jones. With 200 meters to go,

Moore was 10 meters behind
Jones. Rounding the last curve
into the final 100, Moore closed
the difference with a spirited kick
as Jones began to tire. With 50
meters to go Moore took the lead
and the win with a personal
record and Pacific 10 Champi
onship-qualifying 2 minutes and
9.38 seconds.
The Cardinal men enjoyed the
competition in pursuit of Pac-10
and NCAA qualifying times.
Sophomore Pete Swanson threw
the discus a NCAA provisional
qualifying 179 feet 2 inches. In a
quick 10,000 meters, junior Rob
Reeder used the fast field to run a
NCAA provisional qualifier of
29:46, a personal record by 36 sec
onds. Junior Mark Fadil and
sophomore Brian Zmijewski qual
ified for Pac-lOs in the 3,000-
meter steeplechase, while sopho
more Greg Jimmerson did so in
the 5,000-meters.
"We wanted to put ourselves in
a position to get qualifying times
and distances and from that per
spective we did really well," said
head coach Vin Lananna in sum
ming up the meet.
