The juggernaut rolls on.
The No. 1-ranked Stanford men's tennis team
(19-0 overall, 9-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
moved a couple of notches closer to an undefeat
ed regular season last weekend in Arizona. The
Cardinal's latest victims were No. 50 Arizona (6-
13, 0-8 in the Pac-10), which fell 5-2 on Friday,
and No. 16 Arizona State (11-8, 2-7 in the Pac
-10), who were 6-1 losers on Saturday.
The Cardinal's lopsided victories were made
more impressive by the fact that the team played
without the services of their normal No. 2 singles
player, the 25th-ranked Scott Humphries. The
freshman sat out most of the weekend to nurse a
minor muscle pull.
"It was good that we did as well as we did with
out Scott playing," said junior Ricky Becker.
Humphries only saw action in No. 1 doubles
