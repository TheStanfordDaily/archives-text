The juggernaut rolls on.
The No. 1-ranked Stanford men's tennis team
(19-0 overall, 9-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
moved a couple of notches closer to an undefeat
ed regular season last weekend in Arizona. The
Cardinal's latest victims were No. 50 Arizona (6-
13, 0-8 in the Pac-10), which fell 5-2 on Friday,
and No. 16 Arizona State (11-8, 2-7 in the Pac
-10), who were 6-1 losers on Saturday.
The Cardinal's lopsided victories were made
more impressive by the fact that the team played
without the services of their normal No. 2 singles
player, the 25th-ranked Scott Humphries. The
freshman sat out most of the weekend to nurse a
minor muscle pull.
"It was good that we did as well as we did with
out Scott playing," said junior Ricky Becker.
Humphries only saw action in No. 1 doubles

against the Sun Devils, where he
and partner Paul Goldstein pulled
out an 8-3 victory over Sargis
Sargsian and David Critchley.
"I put Scott in at doubles
against ASU just to get an idea [of
how he was doing!," said Stanford
head coach Dick Gould. "He
served about two miles per hour
and they still beat a heck of a
team."
Humphries and Goldstein are
the nation's No. 2-ranked doubles
team.
Sargsian's doubles loss was
just the beginning of a long day
for the Armenian, who stands
atop the singles rankings. He was
downed in singles by Jeff Salzen
stein, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 in a grudge
match for the Stanford junior.
Sargsian had cheated Salzenstein
last March 31 at Stanford in a 6-
3, 7-6 (7-4) win for the top-ranked
Sun Devil.
After sweeping the doubles
point from ASU, Stanford outper
formed the Sun Devils in all of the
singles matches.
Paul Goldstein moved up to
No. 2 singles to best Sergio Elias,
6-3, 6-4. Goldstein is ranked No.
36 in singles.

Jim Thomas continued to
calmly pull out tiebreakers,
defeating Paul Reber 4-6, 6-3, 7-6
(7-4) in No. 3 singles.
"A lot of times I have close
matches that probably shouldn't
be that close, but this time the
guy played well," said Thomas.
Grant Elliott stretched his
dual match win streak to 17, beat
ing Tsolak Gevorkian 7-5, 6-4 in
No. 4 singles.
Becker outplayed Critchley in
the No. 5 position, 6-2, 7-6 (12-
10). Becker had suffered defeats
to players from Utah and UCLA
the previous week.
"Ricky is back on beam, and
that's good," Gould said.

him after the second set of his
match. With the team victory
already clinched for Stanford, he
retired to Wolf von Lindenau, 6-7
(7-3), 7-5.
Against Arizona the day
before, the Cardinal began its
road swing in low stride but fin
ished the day in high stride.
With Humphries resting,
Thomas and Becker teamed at
No. 1 doubles against the Wild
cats' Chris Jenkins and Sten

match point opportunities, the
24th-ranked Cardinal tandem

fell, 9-8(12-10).
