USC 7 9
Stanford 5 8

The Stanford baseball team
suffered its first sweep of the sea
son in a three-game series against
USC culminating in a heartbreak
ing marathon defeat played over
two days. The losses dropped the
Cardinal (12-8) into third place in
Pacific 10 Southern Division
standings, a half game behind the
Trojans (13-8) and a full game
behind surprisingly strong Cali
fornia (13-7).
Hoping to rebound from
Thursday's 7-5 loss, the Cardinal
sent undefeated junior Mike Rob
bins (3-0) to the mound. Robbins*
strong hurling held the Trojans
scoreless until the fifth inning,
when USC catcher Chad Moeller
belted a homerun to left field.
Robbins quickly regained his
composure to strike out the next
batter and exited the inning on
the heals of clutch 5-4-3 double
play.
Stanford had grabbed an early
1-0 lead behind the solid hitting of
senior Steve Carver. The third
baseman doubled to center field

to lead off the second inning and
eventually crossed the plate on
junior Troy Kent's infield ground
out.
Th-.! game remained close until
the top half of the eighth inning
when USC put three runs on the
board to take a 5-1 lead. With the
bases loaded and one out, Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess
replaced Robbins with sophomore
Brendan Sullivan. Sullivan sur
rendered two hits and one bases
loaded walk that led to a three
run inning for the Trojans.
USC added an insurance run in
the top of the ninth, extending
the margin to five. Stanford
refused to quit and used the bot
tom of the ninth to keep the game
interesting.
Freshman center fielder Joe
Kilburg triggered the comeback
with a leadoff single. Kilburg, 2-4
on the day, is hitting at a torrid
.444 clip over his last seven
games. A double by junior Cale
Carter and an intentional walk of
junior A.J. Hinch loaded the bases
for the Cardinal with no outs.
Steve Carver promptly roped a
double to left to clear the bases,
giving the senior three RBIs on
the day.
Watching the game slipping
out of his team's grasp, USC
coach Mike Gillespie went to the
bullpen and called upon closer
Jason Parle. The junior right
hander entered the game and
struck out the first batter he
faced. Junior first baseman Troy
Kent kept the Cardinal hopes
alive with a single to left field, but
Parle buckled down to retire the
next two Cardinal batters and
extinguish the Cardinal rally.
Stanford hoped to pick up the
pieces of the series in Saturday's
final game. Freshman pitcher
Kyle Peterson looked to stop the
team's two-game slide and avoid
the first home Six-Pac sweep in
more than two years. The fresh
man carried an impressive 7-1
record to the mound and the con
fidence of a one-run complete
game victory against the Trojans
in March.
Kilburg led off the bottom of
the first with a single to right.
Carver drove the freshman home
with a two-out single to right. The
Cardinal posted its second run in
the third inning coming off clutch
back-to-back two-out doubles by
Carter and Hinch.
Fueled by the clutch hitting
and strong pitching, the Cardinal
cruised until the fourth inning.
Then with one swing of USC Ail-
American candidate Geoff Jenk
ins' bat, the game was quickly
tied at two.
The Cardinal matched USC's
output in the fourth with two
runs of its own. Once again, Kil
burg sparked the Cardinal scor
ing. The offensive catalyst singled
to center, driving in junior Brian

Dallimore.
In the bottom of the fifth, the
Cardinal padded its lead. Fresh
man designated hitter Jon Scha
effer drove in senior right fielder
Dusty Allen for the Cardinal's
fifth run.
At this point in the game,
everything was going the Cardi
nal's way. The team had a 5-2
lead, a runner on first with one
out, and Peterson was pitching
tremendously. Everything was
going the Cardinal's way, that is,
except Mother Nature. The skies
opened up and rain began to
pound Sunken Diamond. The
final four innings would be played
on Easter Sunday.
Coach Marquess inserted
sophomore pitcher Tom Reimers
for Peterson in Sunday's continu
ation. The righty surrendered one
run in less than an inning before
Marquess called on junior Mario
Iglesias. Iglesias's strong pitching
held the Trojans scoreless until
the eighth inning.
In the bottom of the sixth, Eric
Sees used smart baserunning to
take advantage of a USC error to
turn a leadoff single into a run,
returning the Cardinal's lead at
three.
The score remained 6-3 until
the eighth inning when USC used
two hits and an error to put a run
across the plate. Iglesias struck
out Trojan Ernie Diaz with two
runners on base to end the
inning.
The Cardinal maintained its
three-run lead heading into the
ninth inning as a result of
Carter's two-out RBI single to
center field. The eighth inning, 7-
4 Stanford lead would be the Car
dinal's last of the day.

The top of the ninth started
harmlessly enough with a pop
out. USC then singled before
what turned out to be the most
important sequence of events in
the game.
Trojan Gabe Alzarez was hit by
a pitch and then the Cardinal
loaded the bases by intentionally
walking the power hitter Jenkins.
With the bases loaded, Marquess
replaced Iglesias with sophomore
Brendan Sullivan. The first bat
ter Sullivan faced knocked a dou
ble to right field, driving in two
Trojans. Marquess decided to
intentionally walk Derek Baker to
load the bases. The tactic back
fired and two more runs crossed
the plate off of a USC single.
Trailing by one, Marquess
returned to his bullpen. Sopho
more hurler David Brammer
entered the game. The flame
thrower struck out the first bat
ter he faced with the bases loaded
before giving up a single to Walter
Dawkins, the final batter of the
inning. One Trojan crossed the
plate before Dusty Allen gunned
down another possible run with a
laser from right field to home
plate. Allen's spectacular throw
ended the inning, but the damage
was already done.
Hungry for the sweep, Gillespie
brought in the ace of the USC staff,
Randy Flores, to close the game.
Flores retired the first two batters
in order before the Cardinal mus
tered up one final rally. Junior
Troy Allen kept the Cardinal alive
with a single to right. With runners
on first and second, Dallimore
slapped a single to left, driving in
Kent. The next Cardinal batter,
Eric Sees, fouled out, ending the
game with a stinging 9-8 score.

going the Cardinal's way, that is,
except Mother Nature. The skies
opened up and rain began to
pound Sunken Diamond. The
final four innings would be played
on Easter Sunday.
Coach Marquess inserted
sophomore pitcher Tom Reimers
for Peterson in Sunday's continu
ation. The righty surrendered one
run in less than an inning before
Marquess called on junior Mario
Iglesias. Iglesias's strong pitching
held the Trojans scoreless until
the eighth inning.
In the bottom of the sixth, Eric
Sees used smart baserunning to
take advantage of a USC error to
turn a leadoff single into a run,
returning the Cardinal's lead at
three.
The score remained 6-3 until
the eighth inning when USC used
two hits and an error to put a run
across the plate. Iglesias struck
out Trojan Ernie Diaz with two
runners on base to end the
inning.
The Cardinal maintained its
three-run lead heading into the
ninth inning as a result of
Carter's two-out RBI single to
center field. The eighth inning, 7-
4 Stanford lead would be the Car
dinal's last of the day.

The top of the ninth started
harmlessly enough with a pop
out. USC then singled before
what turned out to be the most
important sequence of events in
the game.
Trojan Gabe Alzarez was hit by
a pitch and then the Cardinal
loaded the bases by intentionally
walking the power hitter Jenkins.
With the bases loaded, Marquess
replaced Iglesias with sophomore
Brendan Sullivan. The first bat
ter Sullivan faced knocked a dou
ble to right field, driving in two
Trojans. Marquess decided to
intentionally walk Derek Baker to
load the bases. The tactic back
fired and two more runs crossed
the plate off of a USC single.
Trailing by one, Marquess
returned to his bullpen. Sopho
more hurler David Brammer
entered the game. The flame
thrower struck out the first bat
ter he faced with the bases loaded
before giving up a single to Walter
Dawkins, the final batter of the
inning. One Trojan crossed the
plate before Dusty Allen gunned
down another possible run with a
laser from right field to home
plate. Allen's spectacular throw
ended the inning, but the damage
was already done.
Hungry for the sweep, Gillespie
brought in the ace of the USC staff,
Randy Flores, to close the game.
Flores retired the first two batters
in order before the Cardinal mus
tered up one final rally. Junior
Troy Allen kept the Cardinal alive
with a single to right. With runners
on first and second, Dallimore
slapped a single to left, driving in
Kent. The next Cardinal batter,
Eric Sees, fouled out, ending the
game with a stinging 9-8 score.
