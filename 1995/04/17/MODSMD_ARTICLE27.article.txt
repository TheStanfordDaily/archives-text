USC 7 9
Stanford 5 8

The Stanford baseball team
suffered its first sweep of the sea
son in a three-game series against
USC culminating in a heartbreak
ing marathon defeat played over
two days. The losses dropped the
Cardinal (12-8) into third place in
Pacific 10 Southern Division
standings, a half game behind the
Trojans (13-8) and a full game
behind surprisingly strong Cali
fornia (13-7).
Hoping to rebound from
Thursday's 7-5 loss, the Cardinal
sent undefeated junior Mike Rob
bins (3-0) to the mound. Robbins*
strong hurling held the Trojans
scoreless until the fifth inning,
when USC catcher Chad Moeller
belted a homerun to left field.
Robbins quickly regained his
composure to strike out the next
batter and exited the inning on
the heals of clutch 5-4-3 double
play.
Stanford had grabbed an early
1-0 lead behind the solid hitting of
senior Steve Carver. The third
baseman doubled to center field

to lead off the second inning and
eventually crossed the plate on
junior Troy Kent's infield ground
out.
Th-.! game remained close until
the top half of the eighth inning
when USC put three runs on the
board to take a 5-1 lead. With the
bases loaded and one out, Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess
replaced Robbins with sophomore
Brendan Sullivan. Sullivan sur
rendered two hits and one bases
loaded walk that led to a three
run inning for the Trojans.
USC added an insurance run in
the top of the ninth, extending
the margin to five. Stanford
refused to quit and used the bot
tom of the ninth to keep the game
interesting.
Freshman center fielder Joe
Kilburg triggered the comeback
with a leadoff single. Kilburg, 2-4
on the day, is hitting at a torrid
.444 clip over his last seven
games. A double by junior Cale
Carter and an intentional walk of
junior A.J. Hinch loaded the bases
for the Cardinal with no outs.
Steve Carver promptly roped a
double to left to clear the bases,
giving the senior three RBIs on
the day.
Watching the game slipping
out of his team's grasp, USC
coach Mike Gillespie went to the
