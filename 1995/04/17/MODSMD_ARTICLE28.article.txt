# Of late rallies and rivalries

A good college rivalry
requires tightly contested
games, intense competitors
and bizarre occurrences.
While any Stanford athletic
event against California quali
fies as a rivalry, add the Cardi
nal versus USC in baseball to
that list of athletic tradition.
Labeled the fifth-best col
lege baseball rivalry in the
nation by Baseball America —
the bible of baseball enthusi
asts — the weekend series
between the Trojans and the
Cardinal saw a little of every
thing and plenty of excite
ment. Although Stanford was
swept by USC, losing 6-4 and
9-8 in the final two games,
fans could not walk away from
Sunken Diamond without
feeling enthused about college
baseball.
The three-game set
between the two teams
allowed the audience to wit
ness three valiant, but ultimately
fruitless, ninth-inning comebacks
by Stanford, great hitting by some
of the best collegiate hitters, gutsy
pitching performances — and plen
ty of controversy.
What rivalry would be complete
without great athletes? Some of the
big names, and soon to be big
names, involved the series are
Geoff Jenkins, Gabe Alvarez,
Randy Flores, A.J. Hinch, Steve
Carver and Kyle Peterson.
Jenkins, a first team All-Ameri
can candidate and possible first
round draft pick, entered the week
end with a .376 batting average and
left after raising his average 20
points, hitting two home runs and
making a bid for his third Six-Pac
Player of the Week. Alvarez batted
safely in each game and flashed
good leather while Flores held
Stanford in check in the opener and
garnered his first save of the season
in the finale.
For the Cardinal, Hinch is bat
ting over .350 for the season and

has been hitting the ball with
increased authority, especially in
the Six-Pac. Carver, named Base
ball America's Summer Player of
the Year after batting .398 with 17
homers and 62 RBI in Alaska
(Jenkins won the award last year),
is Stanford's run producer in the
middle of the order, and Peterson
claims two Six-Pac Pitcher of the
Week awards in addition to sport
ing a 7-1 record and 3.09 ERA.
Rivalries always involve players
who play for the love of the game.
Flores, an All-American lefl-han
der, proved that by pitching twice
in the series, one of them a start.
He went eight and two-thirds
innings giving up two earned runs
on Thursday to claim his eighth vic
tory of the year and took the
mound yesterday to bail out Trojan
head coach Mike Gillespie. When
Gillespie ran into trouble, he called
on Flores, and the sophomore deliv
ered.
In rivalries, games are almost
always close, and this weekend was
no different. The three games were
never decided until the final pitch,
and both teams had ample opportu
nities to win.
The Cardinal scored seven runs
in the trio of ninth innings in its

attempts to overcome Trojan leads,
three apiece in the first two, one in
yesterday's contest. USC, however,
did one better by batting around in
the ninth of the series finale and
scoring five runs after being down
by three to complete the only come
back that succeeded.
And what rivaliy would be com
plete without its oddities. In the
rain-delayed two-day contest, both
head coaches, Gillespie and Mark
Marquess, stepped onto the field to
argue numerous calls. Gillespie had
the better of Marquess as Gillespie
appeared to leave the dugout every
inning for one dispute or another.
Marquess was more even-tem
pered, as he only left his perch
about three or four times.
However, the Trojans take the
cake for the oddest ejection. While
Stanford first base coach Troy
Paulsen was tossed out in normal
baseball fashion — during a face-to
face argument with the umpire in
the seventh inning of Sunday'scon
test — USC player Brian Ponchak
was ejected from over 150 feet
away. Apparently tossed for trash
talking, Ponchak was removed as
the second base umpire called time,
pointed to Ponchak and yelled "he's
gone" at the top of his lungs.
