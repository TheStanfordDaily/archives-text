## Stanford, Spartans tied up at tourney 
### John Lawson Contributing writer 
Back and forth.
That's how it's been this
year for the women's golf teams
of Stanford and San Jose State.
While two-time defending
national champion Arizona
State has looked very comfort
able with its No. 1 ranking, the
Cardinal and the Spartans have
battled constantly for the No. 2
spot â€” and neither has been
able to rid themselves of the
other.
So when the two teams con
verged on the Stanford Golf
Course this past weekend as the
favorites to win the California
Collegiate (Arizona State did
not participate), the conven
tional wisdom was that one
would finally out-shine the
other.
The result?
A tie, of course.
The newly ranked No. 2 Car
dinal and No. 3 Spartans golfed
their way to two-day final team
scores of 594 (10 over par).
Fourth-ranked UCLA finished
in third (600) while unranked
Washington played its best golf
of the year, scoring 608 and

ending in fourth place among
the 12-team field that consisted
solely of teams from the West
Coast.
"It was a great weekend of
golf," said head coach Tim Bald
win. "Both Stanford and San
Jose State played strong tour
naments. They put together
two solid rounds to tie us."
The Cardinal had a three
stroke lead (293-296) after an
outstanding round on Saturday
but couldn't shake off the
steady Spartans on Sunday.
"San Jose State always plays
well on our course," said sopho
more Mhairi McKay. "Although
I would have liked the outright
victory, I was happy that they
didn't beat us."
McKay definitely helped
Stanford's cause. The first
team All-American played her
best golf of the year en route to
a 142 (4 under par) and her
third individual title of the
year.
McKay had been struggling
since the autumn tournaments,
and her swing underwent mas
sive reconstruction as a conse
quence.
