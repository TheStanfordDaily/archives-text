# Trying new positions
## Junior slates work for new programs 
### Marie Rosencrantz 
This week, members of the
sophomore class will have their
first chance to elect representa
tives to the newly created position
of Junior Class Presidents.
Two slates — "Experience the

Difference" and"The
Groove" — are compet
ing for the opportunity
to introduce and orga
nize programs to bene
fit the junior class.
The ASSU Senate
voted in late February
to create presidents for
the sophomore and ju
nior classes.

While the four members of
each slate have different experi
ences and ideas for how to im
prove their upcoming junior year,
the two slates share the same de
sire to strengthen the junior class
bond.
'Experience the Difference'
Sophomores Mark Cordoba,
Rupali Gandhi, Jason Liu and
Charles Katz of "Experience the
Difference" are all members of
the senate. They were involved in
drafting the senate bill that led to
the creation of the new class pres
ident positions.
