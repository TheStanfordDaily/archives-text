# Trying new positions
## Junior slates work for new programs 
### Marie Rosencrantz 
This week, members of the
sophomore class will have their
first chance to elect representa
tives to the newly created position
of Junior Class Presidents.
Two slates — "Experience the

Difference" and"The
Groove" — are compet
ing for the opportunity
to introduce and orga
nize programs to bene
fit the junior class.
The ASSU Senate
voted in late February
to create presidents for
the sophomore and ju
nior classes.

While the four members of
each slate have different experi
ences and ideas for how to im
prove their upcoming junior year,
the two slates share the same de
sire to strengthen the junior class
bond.
'Experience the Difference'
Sophomores Mark Cordoba,
Rupali Gandhi, Jason Liu and
Charles Katz of "Experience the
Difference" are all members of
the senate. They were involved in
drafting the senate bill that led to
the creation of the new class pres
ident positions.
"It may look weird that we cre
ated the position and now we are

ASSU
running for it, but we really felt
a need for the positions," Katz
said. "It is absurd that Stanford
has existed for over 100 years
without having presidents for
each class."
Ideas for class bonding events
include a junior formal, a junior
day at Great America and post-
MCAT, LSAT and GRE parties.
The Slate also wants to create
a database of internships avail
able for juniors, organize a com
munity service day for juniors,
standardize the process through
which students can obtain let
ters of recommendations from
faculty members and develop a
newsletter which reports
upcoming events and describes
the accomplishments of mem
bers of their class.
'The Groove'
Sophomores Cabral Bonner,
Brad Davies, Tarina Kang and
Meghvi Maheta of "The Groove"
see their primary goal as
improving class bonding and

unity.
"We have seen that there is
not as much unity among the
senior class as we had hoped. We
think this is due to the lack of
unity on the sophomore / junior
levels," Maheta said.
To foster unity, "The Groove"
plans to implement different
social events like welcome-back
barbecues at the beginning of
each quarter, a formal for
juniors and other junior parties
throughout the year.
As members of the Stanford
Student Alumni Network
(STAN), three of the four mem
bers in"The Groove" have
assisted this year's Senior Class
Presidents in organizing senior
events.
In order to make juniors more
aware of different opportunities
for internships and summer
jobs, slate members plan to work
with STAN and the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center to
organize career fairs where
alumni can share their profes
sional experiences. They also
want to advertise available
internships in a newsletter that
would be sent to members of the
junior class two times a quarter.
