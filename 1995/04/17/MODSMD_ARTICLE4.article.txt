# Four sophomore slates vie for office
## 
### Jesse Oxfeld 
Four slates of candidates are
vying for the new office of Sopho
more Class Presidents. Despite
the creative and diverse slate
names - "SPAM," "Delilah
Jones," "Royale with Cheese" and

"Cheers" — the four
groups seem to echo
the same ideas: in
creasing class identity
and providing social op
portunities for sopho
mores.
The offices of
Sophomore Class Pres
idents and Junior Class
Presidents were creat-

Ed by the ASSU Senate in late Feb
ruary and modeled after the exist
ing Senior Class Presidents. The
goal in creating the two new posi
tions was to foster greater class
unity by running assorted events
every year.
♦SPAM'
"SPAM" stands for Sophomore
Platform Advocating Merrymak
ing. Despite its playful moniker,
however, "We're not taking this as
a joke," said slate member Andrew
Howard, a freshman political sci
ence msgor. Howard is running
along with freshmen Rebecca
Dodds, Andrew Blackburn and
Ramesh Srinivasan.
"The most important thing is to
bring our class together," said
Howard. He added that "SPAM" is
also interested in doing "stuff to get
involved with the community orga
nizations," such as ethnic centers.
The slate's list of ideas includes
sophomore class trips to nearby
attractions, sophomore-only par
ties and the creation of new sopho
more traditions.
'Delilah Jones'
Freshmen Alex Leung, Matthew
Lippert, Jason Marsh and Stanley
Yung form the "Delilah Jones"
slate. They believe that their
strength lies in a willingness to only
follow students' wishes.
"We're more representative
than anything else. What we hope
to do is reflect what the people
want," said Leung, an industrial
engineering and economics major.
"Delilah Jones" also seeks to
"increase class solidarity — make
the sophomore class feel like every
one belongs together," he said.

Leung painted an image of
"Delilah Jones" as the populist can
didates. "One of our mottoes is
'Regular people for president,' " he
said. "We're sick of the political
types ... we think we're different."
The name "Delilah Jones"
comes from a Grateful Dead song,
in which she is referred to as the
mother of 10. The slate members
liked the idea of a mother looking
after her children, said Leung.
'Royale with Cheese'
The term "Royale with Cheese"
was chosen as a slate name merely
because it was a funny bit from a
good movie ("Pulp Fiction"), said
freshman Greg Vosganian.
"There's no deep philosophical rea
son," he added apologetically.
The other members of the
"Royale with Cheese" slate are
freshmen Kara Dußray, Andy Lane
and Rachel Ochoa.
"We just want to get our class
unified as sophomores," said Lane.
Both Lane and Vosganian com
mented on the unity felt by fresh
men, starting off college, and by
seniors, getting ready to graduate.
"Royale with Cheese" would like to
see that unity be maintained
through four years.

Some of the slate's ideas for
doing this, Lane said, include an all
sophomore dance, sophomore
intramural games and a carnival.
The slate is also interested in work
ing toward a Dead Week without
classes, Vosganian said.
'Cheers'
The "Cheers" slate is made up of
freshmen Kimberly Shapiro, Joey
Kwok, Kruti Patel and Praveen
Rangnath.
"We have the best diversity of
all the slates," said Kwok. Shapiro
noted that the slate's members,
two male and two female, come
from many different ethnic back
grounds and from different parts
of campus.
While the slate is planning to
hold a sophomore semi-formal,
Shapiro noted that members plan
to listen to what events the stu
dents are interested in having.
"Cheers" is looking to plan events
that are "not just social, but aca
demic too," she said. Ideas include
workshops on choosing majors.
"Cheers" was chosen as the
slate's name because the slate wish
es "cheers to the sophomore class
and cheers to having a great year,"
said Shapiro.
