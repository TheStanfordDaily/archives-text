# Directory must pay back taxes
## Failure to pay in past due to confusion over control issues 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
For the first time ever, the
Stanford Directory will file and
pay taxes â€” something the publi
cation has failed to do since 1989
when it began to make surplus
revenue. This, tax experts say, is a
violation of federal and state tax
laws.
The failure to pay may be the
result of confusion, both over
whether the Directory's income is
taxable and over who controls the
publication. Though the Directory
banks with the ASSU and uses its
tax identification code, the Office
of Student Activities controls the
Directory's operations and some

of the publication's surplus rev
enues go to maintain Lake Lagu
nita.
The Directory's taxes for this
year total between $10,000 and
$20,000. The publication will also
pay an unknown amount of back
taxes accumulated since 1989
when the Directory began making
profits from advertising revenue.
Citing confusion over whether
the Directory was tax-exempt, Di
rector of Student Activities Nanci
Howe, who oversees the publica
tion, conceded that the Directory
has known for as many as two
years that it might owe back taxes,
but has not paid them until now.
