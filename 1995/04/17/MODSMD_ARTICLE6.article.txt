# Student input on grapes to be heard
## 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
After last week's University decision to en
courage individual residences to make in
formed decisions on the boycott of grapes, both
Residential Education and Dining Services are
working to inform students of the new policy.
The new University policy, approved by
University President Gerhard Casper and
Provost Condoleezza Rice last Tuesday, allows
dormitories — but not departments — to de
cide whether they want to serve grapes.
The new policy comes after a year-long re
view by the Grape Policy Committee, which
recommended that both residences and depart
ments be allowed to choose whether to boycott
grapes.
The Grape Policy Committee also sought to
foster educational programs to allow students
"to make regular, formal decisions," according
to the group's report. The president and
provost agreed to provide more support for ed

ucating students about the issue.
"The most important part is to let students
and residence staff know what the policy is,"
said Ann Porteus, acting director of Residen
tial Education.
To make the new policy successful, Acting
Dean of Students Jim Larimore said there will
be student involvement early on in the process.
"We must be successful in coming up with a
means of providing student information," La
rimore said.
This will include talking to resident assis
tants, resident fellows and students, Porteus
said. "We must figure out how to let the policy
be known."
According to Porteus and Dining Services
Operations Manager of Finance Craig
Mitchell, communication between Dining Ser
vices and Residential Education is necessary.
"Our policy is basically [onel of support,"
Mitchell said.
The previous University policy on grapes
gave student residences, but not departments,

an option to decide if they wanted to serve
grapes. The new policy adds to the previous one
by offering more University support to the stu
dents' decisions.
In the old policy, "I don't think students uti
lized their decision-making ability," Mitchell
said. In both the new and previous policy, stu
dents are allowed to decide whether they want
their residence to serve grapes.
"It just wasn't an issue in the forefront...
except for (Casa) Zapata," Mitchell said.
However, in most dorms this year, students
did not vote on whether to serve grapes and
continued their policies from last year. Bran
ner Hall students, for example, voted last year
— but not this year — on whether to serve
grapes. Branner has continued not to offer
grapes.
Other dorms, including Stern, Florence
Moore and Wilbur Halls, all did not vote this
year but have continued policies from last year
to not serve grapes. At Stern, a peti
tion has to be formulated by a stu
dent for Dining Services to consider
bringing back grapes.
"A few years ago, Stern voted to
boycott grapes. Since then nobody
has come up with a petition to serve

grapes again," said Javier Ruiz, an
RAin Casa Zapata.
"At Dining Services, we will not
take a political [stance]," Mitchell
said.
Although the University intends
to inform students of the new poli
cy, it will not do so until next fall.
"We have a lot of time between
now and then (fall quarter)," Por
teus said.
Mitchell, however, added that

Dining Services "doesn't see any
change in plans" from last year's
policy.
Stanford's Chicano / Latino stu
dent group, MEChA — members of
which went on a hunger strike last
spring calling for the boycott of
grapes because of the harm done to
migrant farm workers by pesticides
— refused to say whether they will
help inform students about the new
policy.
