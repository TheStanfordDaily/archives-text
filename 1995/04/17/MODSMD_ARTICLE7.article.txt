# Afterburner enters the solar Sunrayce

A group of Stanford students is
planning a road trip for this sum
mer, but they won't be bringing
along their Chevron cards. They
only fuel they will need is the sun.
A group fluctuating between
10 and 15 students has been
building its own solar car —
which runs on electricity pro
duced by solar panels — since
February of last year in prepara
tion for Sunrayce 1995, a solar car
competition.
The race, which will take place
June 20-29, consists of 40 cars
from universities around the
world racing from Indianapolis,
Ind., to Denver, Colo.
Juniors Kate Von Reis and Do
rian West, both engineering ma
jors, have been involved in devel
oping solar cars at Stanford since
their freshman years. Von Reis
said the project shows how much
unnecessary energy American
cars are currently using.

"This project is really interest
ing in terms of problems they give
you to solve," she said. "We are
building a car for two people that
goes 40 miles per hour on less en
ergy than a hairdryer." She added
that this shows that, for Ameri
can cars, "things can radically
change."
West added that "gasoline en
gines are archaic."
Von Reis and West will both
travel with the group to Indi
anapolis with their solar car, the
Afterburner. Four people will al
ternate driving the car, which
holds two people. Others in the
group will drive alongside After
burner in support vehicles to help
navigate, strategize and repair
the car if needed, Von Reis said.
All racing cars will travel a pre
determined distance — 70 to 175
miles — each day. The winner is
the car with the lowest cumula
tive time.
