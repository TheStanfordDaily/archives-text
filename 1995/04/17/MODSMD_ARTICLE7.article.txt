# Afterburner enters the solar Sunrayce
## 
### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
A group of Stanford students is
planning a road trip for this sum
mer, but they won't be bringing
along their Chevron cards. They
only fuel they will need is the sun.
A group fluctuating between
10 and 15 students has been
building its own solar car —
which runs on electricity pro
duced by solar panels — since
February of last year in prepara
tion for Sunrayce 1995, a solar car
competition.
The race, which will take place
June 20-29, consists of 40 cars
from universities around the
world racing from Indianapolis,
Ind., to Denver, Colo.
Juniors Kate Von Reis and Do
rian West, both engineering ma
jors, have been involved in devel
oping solar cars at Stanford since
their freshman years. Von Reis
said the project shows how much
unnecessary energy American
cars are currently using.

"This project is really interest
ing in terms of problems they give
you to solve," she said. "We are
building a car for two people that
goes 40 miles per hour on less en
ergy than a hairdryer." She added
that this shows that, for Ameri
can cars, "things can radically
change."
West added that "gasoline en
gines are archaic."
Von Reis and West will both
travel with the group to Indi
anapolis with their solar car, the
Afterburner. Four people will al
ternate driving the car, which
holds two people. Others in the
group will drive alongside After
burner in support vehicles to help
navigate, strategize and repair
the car if needed, Von Reis said.
All racing cars will travel a pre
determined distance — 70 to 175
miles — each day. The winner is
the car with the lowest cumula
tive time.

close looks at the cars during mid
day and overnight stops, as one of
the main purposes of Sunrayce is
to introduce the public to alterna
tive transportation technologies
that benefit the environment.
Cars like Afterburner may not
be practical for the American pub
lic, since they are designed for rac
ing only and are not allowed to be
recharged overnight during the
race. Similar electrical cars, how
ever, are feasible for everyday
driving, since they can be
recharged, according to West.
He said he thinks moving
towards such alternative energy

sources is imperative for the sake
of the environment, but first the
public must be educated on the
practicality of electric cars.
"I think we are going to have to
look at other sources of energy.
The American Auto Industry is
afraid that the market is not
there. People may not have the
correct view of electric cars. They
think they are like golf carts,"
West said.
With no assembly line for solar
or electric automobiles, these cars
are currently very expensive. The
group building the Afterburner
has spent $50,000 in cash, mostly
funded by ASSU special fees, said
Von Reis. This figure does not
include material supplied by Boe
ing and General Plastics, which is
worth another $70,000, according

to Von Reis.
West said such prices could be
reduced considerably. "They
could be affordable if facilities
were available to provide them,"
he said.
The design of solar cars alone
is enough to reduce the required
energy. "Solar cars revolutionize
the aerodynamics of cars. You
have to make solar cars super
light and components have to be
very efficient," West said.
In fact, West said if a gas
engine was put in a solar car, the
gas mileage would be three times
better than in a normal car.
Both Von Reis and West are
the only group members who also
competed in a similar race, the
World Solar Challenge, in Aus
tralia in November 1993.
