"/ want my software to fly jets, SIR!"
If you've got the right stuff, we're looking for a few good men—and women.
At IntegriNaiUics, we're developing an exciting new way to land commercial
jet aircraft safely in low visibility, completely automatically, all over the
world, and via satellite. Recently our state-of-the-art landing system
technology was hooked into the autopilot of a United Airlines Boeing 737. As
reported on CNN and other news media, the system successfully guided the
aircraft to 110 flawless landings—right on the numbers. The system is so
accurate, it can tell you where you are to within the volume of a baseball.
