AASA $33,254.03
($2.37)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
AASA is a major group on campus and
puts on many programs, including a talent
show and the popular Extravaganza. Further
more, AASA acts as an umbrella group fund
ing many other organizations, like Sanskriti
and the Korean-American Students Associa
tion. Finally, it is a resource for the large num
ber of Asian-American students on campus —
a group including just under one quarter of the
undergraduate population. For all these rea
sons, AASA is valuable.
However, AASA leaders could and should
demonstrate more initiative in funding their
group. Members raise only $3,000 of their
budget outside the special fee, comparable to
the amount of money the smaller Black Stu
dent Union is able to raise. AASA should do a
little more work looking to economize and find
new sources of revenue.
ASSU Legal $83,409.41
Counseling ($5.94)
® YES O NO
In an ideal world, a student would never
need ASSU Legal Counseling. This is not an
ideal world. Students will often find them
selves in a tricky situation and in need of legal
advice. The counseling group offers such
advice free to students and their spouses.
Group members are not spending all their
money prosecuting big cases. Rather, they
provide lots of primary legal advice to many
students, and refer larger cases to more
appropriate venues. Most of the budget
request goes to a San Jose-based law firm
and to pay an office coordinator.
Yes, you may never use this office — and
if so, lucky you. ASSU Legal Counseling is
really insurance in case you ever need advice
on the law.
ASSU Speakers $102,531.00
Bureau ($7.31)
(D YES O NO
Isabel Allende, James Carville, John
Sununu, Camille Paglia, Edward Albee and
Joycelyn Elders. These are just some of the
personae the ASSU Speakers Bureau has
brought to the Stanford campus this year. The
bureau uses its special fee largely to pay hon
oraria and airfare for the orators invited to
campus. They also co-sponsor many speak
ers with other groups. A small portion of the
budget — $3,250 — goes toward salaries.
There is one somewhat fishy practice: The
bureau pays for members of its staff to go out
to dinner with invited speakers. On the whole,
however, this is a useful group that has been
especially good this year.
Barrio $24,246.86
Assistance ($1.72)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
Barrio Assistance is a wonderful group
doing a wonderful thing. Members get up
eight Saturday mornings a quarter so that
they can bring approximately 50 low
income Chicano/Latino students to cam
pus, tutor them and feed them a hot break
fast. Volunteers are required to stay com
mitted and attend regularly, furthering a
healthy bond between the tutors and their
young pupils.
However the main cost for the group —
making up nearly half its budget — is the
rental of vans to bring the children to Stanford
on Saturdays. This seems wasteful. With
some effort, it would almost surely be possible
for Barrio Assistance to find some person or
