corporation to donate vans to the program.
The group could then reduce transportation
charges to just insurance and maintenance
costs. A move in this direction would show
great commitment toward providing maximum
service with minimum cost to students.
Black $26,636.36
Student Union ($1.89)
(§) YES O NO
The Black Student Union funds a number
of cultural events and celebrations, such as a
Kwanzaa celebration and Black Liberation
Month. In addition, the union helps produce
publications like Enigma and The Real News.
The union is to be applauded for slicing
their buffered fee request by about $16,000,
from $42,735 last election to $26,636 this
year. This is the kind of fiscal care with others'
money all groups should show. However, we
are still concerned that some fat exists in the
BSU budget — a $3,750 price tag for the soul
food dinner, for example, seems high. Ticket
sales and other forms of revenue generation
could help this group improve in the future on
its impressive reduction.
Caribbean $7,977.92
Students ($.56)
Association
O YES ® NO
The Caribbean Student's Association is a
fairly new group that has planned some
speakers and participated in events including
Bechtel Sunday Suppers and the Diaspora
Get-Down.
The groups' request has a serious flaw.
More than half the fee sought — about $3,300
— would go to fund a charity fashion show
and dinner whose proceeds would go toward
two charity groups, including Feed the Chil
dren. However, group members expect to
raise only $1,400 from the dinner. Paying
$3,300 to donate $1,400 just doesnt make
much sense.
Club Sports $153,533.33
($10.94)
® YES O NO
Traditionally one of the most popular spe
cial-fee groups, Club Sports serves nearly
1,000 students, about half of them graduate
students. The group provides funding to 17
different non-varsity athletic teams, including
the rugby, hockey, cycling and polo teams.
Anyone can participate in any sport,
although people of lower ability may be placed
in lower "B" teams. Team athletes demon
strate great initiative in finding non-special-fee
money, often working to make extra money,
for example by picking up after football
games. Also, all athletes pay dues to their
clubs. Both in the number of students served
and the use of other funding sources, Club
Sports is in many ways an ideal special-fee
group.
KZSU $116,180.00
($8.28)
O YES (§> NO
KZSU, Stanford's radio station, provides
several valuable services to the community.
The coverage of Stanford sports, especially
football, is very popular and informative. The
station offers broadcasting training to many
students. Perhaps most important, the station
will broadcast emergency information during
earthquakes and other crises.
All of these benefits do not add up to the
size of KZSU's fee request. The station has
one of the biggest requests at $116,180 —
over $8 per student. Nearly $15,000 goes to
