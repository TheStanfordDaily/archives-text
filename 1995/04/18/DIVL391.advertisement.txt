support the "news" department — a subscrip
tion to the AP wire. A subscription to the
Chronicle or the New YorK Times would be
cheaper. Furthermore, while earthquake pre
paredness is important, that is the responsibil
ity of the University to fund.
Most importantly, KSZU doesn't often play
the music students want to hear. Managers
say the station can't compete with Live 105 or
the like, but we believe that given a choice
students would rather hear their friends and
campus station play popular music than listen
to corporate strangers. KZSU needs to get off
its obscure-music high horse and play what
students want to hear. Then their hefty
request would be more easily stomached.
MEChA $34,746.10
$2.48
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
MEChA has done a great job of connecting
Chicano/Latino students and providing infor
mational programming for the rest of the Stan
ford community. However, while MEChA has
reduced its budget slightly since last year (by
approximately $5,000), the organization is still
requesting a large amount of money and
should find ways to further trim its spending.
Specifically, the' $4,990 spent on the Ballet
Folklorico concert and $3,487 for a Cesar
Chavez commemoration seem excessive.
This year, MEChA raised lots of money after
not receiving a special fee. In the future, the
group should continue this and also include all
fund-raising as a line item in its budget.
Project $9,992.65
Motivation ($-71)
(§> YES O NO
Project Motivation serves an excellent pur
pose — educating disadvantaged youth and
encouraging them to go to college. The group
has requested a very reasonable amount of
money and has shown excellent restraint in
limiting spending. The Office of Admissions,
however, should be paying for some of the
organization's recruitment expenses, espe
cially the Stanford Admit Weekend which cur
rently takes up about $2,500 of ProMo's bud
get.
REDWOOD $17,677.53
($1.26)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
REDWOOD is an excellent organization
with a good goal — to organize camping trips
for first year students. These trips, which are
mandatory at several other universities, offer
a chance to get acquainted with other first
year students. The group has also done an
excellent job of trimming its budget in
response to losing its special fee request last
year, especially by greatly reducing student
salaries. And it has plans to create a resource
center on campus that would provide informa
tion on outdoor activities.
The main problem, however, is that —
although anyone can go on a REDWOOD trip
— they are certainly not everyone's cup of
tea. Everyone should not be paying for them.
Shooting Star $9,042.01
Traveling ($.64)
Children's Theater
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
The Shooting Star Travelling Children's
Theater is a great idea — it provides educa
tional theater to thousands of schoolchildren.
The group's fee request is modest, and it
appears to have a bright future ahead. How
ever since it is brand new there is still some
uncertainty as to how it will perform in years
to come, and there exists a possibility that
the rewards to the Stanford community may
not merit the costs. We also wonder if the
entire student body should be a source of
funding for a group like this one.
SCBN-TV $12,953.25
($.92)
® YES O NO
SCBN-TV, Stanford's student-run televi
sion network, deserves its special fee. The
group provides valuable training to students
interested in broadcasting and offers interest
ing programming. Furthermore, the station
has drastically reduced its fee request from
over $44,000 last year in response to losing
its fee; its budget is now very efficient. If
SCBN is awarded its special-fee request, the
station will be able to purchase much-needed
equipment and produce more shows.
SPOON Hunger $5,847.56
Relief Network ($.42)
(§) YES O NO
SPOON is a very effective and efficient
student organization — its members collect
uneaten food from residences and distribute it
to food pantries for the hungry. Given the
amount of food that would otherwise be wast
ed at Stanford and the group's very modest
fee request, SPOON is worthy of a special
fee. In fact, SPOON — by doing so much with
so little — could serve as a model for other
student groups.
Stanford $25,583.42
American Indian ($1.82)
Organization
(§) YES O NO
SAIO does a very effective job of serving
both the 180-member Native American pop
ulation on campus as well as the rest of
Stanford. The annual Pow Wow, the group's
banner event, brings 40,000 people to cam
pus and is a valuable experience for every
Stanford student who attends. However, the
group still uses part of its fee to offset costs
of the May event; in the future it should try to
at least make the Pow wow self-sufficient
since it benefits more than just Stanford stu
dents. SAIO also serves as the umbrella
organization for a number of useful smaller
groups. Its special fee is a bit higher than
the amount requested (and approved) last
year.
Stanford Axe $12,234.35
Committee ($.87)
<§) YES O NO
The Stanford Axe Committee is charged
with protecting the Axe while It is on campus;
it also organizes the annual Big Game Bonfire
