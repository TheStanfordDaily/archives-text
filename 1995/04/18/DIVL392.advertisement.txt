and sponsors other school-spirit related activ
ities. Without its special fee this year the orga
nization has done its best to keep its traditions
alive, but has been forced to scale back
somewhat and seek other funding sources,
including ASSU reserves. Realizing the pre
vailing attitudes on campus, the group has
chopped its special-fee request by over half
since last year. The group provides a valuable
service that all students can benefit from for a
relatively small cost. It deserves the voters'
support.
Stanford Band $63,040.54
(LSJUMB) ($4.49)
(§) YES O NO
The Leland Stanford Junior (pause) Uni
versity Marching Band is an institution that, for
better or worse, makes Stanford unique. The
Band lost funding from the Music Department
several years ago and needs the special fee
to replace equipment, among other things.
Although the Athletic Department gives the
Band money to go to one away game each
year, members often pay their own ways to
others. The Band is open to anyone who
wants to join, and does get some outside
funding. It is a valuable group that should be
paid for by students.
Stanford $10,266.67
Chaparral ($.73)
<§) YES O NO
The campus humor magazine has been in
a bit of a slump of late in terms of humor, but
it is still a Stanford institution that should be
supported by the student body. The Chappie
is open to all students and is distributed to
undergrad dorms free of charge; in the future
members should try to better involve the grad
uate community. The magazine's editors also
say they hope to get more revenue from
advertising in the future; this is a good idea.
The group's special fee increase from last
year is small.
Stanford $61,358.97
Concert Network ($4.37)
(§> YES O NO
The Stanford Concert Network brings
big-name musical groups to the Stanford
community; students also benefit from dis
counts on tickets. This group fullfills the cri
terion of reaching out to the entire commu
nity — two graduate students have high
level positions in the organization and plen
ty of graduates enjoy the concerts. Howev
er, the types of music groups the network
has brought to campus recently have often
been obscure; it should aim for more main
stream acts in the future. $6,500 of the
group's special-fee request goes to staff
salaries.
Stanford Daily $55,505.18
($3.96)
NO RECOMMENDATION
Stanford $7,100
Homelessness ($.51)
Action Coalition
O YES ' (§) NO
The Stanford Homelessness Action Coali
tion has a noble goal but it really does not
directly serve the Stanford student communi
ty. The group — which has less than 20
members — meets off campus in Palo Alto.
Much of the special fee funds the printing
costs of a newsletter, the SHAC Sheet,
which the group gives to homeless people to
resell (they get to keep the money). Students
should not be funding a group that has a min
imal impact on the Stanford campus.
Stanford Hybrid $15,547.01
Automobile ($1.11)
Research Project
O YES <§> NO
Although it's hard to argue against the
idea of an environmentally-sound automo
bile, this special-fee group is a clear example
of an organization that should not be support
ed by student fees. The Stanford Hybrid
Automobile Research Project involves about
25 graduate and undergraduate students
who are developing a hybrid-electric vehicle
with the support of corporate and government
sponsors. However, academic research pro
jects like this one should not be supported by
the special-fee system; the School of Engi
neering ought to give more support. In addi
tion, this type of engineering project isn't
exactly open to all segments of the communi
ty.
Stanford In $31,914.29
Government ($2.27)
<§) YES O NO
SIG provides a valuable service to all stu
dents interested in getting involved in govern
ment. The group's Haas Center office, staffed
by 85 unpaid students, contains a plethora of
information about internships in Washington,
D.C. as well as in Sacramento and in other
state governments; this fulfills a need that the
CPPC does not adequately address. SIG
also offers several fellowships that give stu
dents summer internships; which are sup
ported by funds independent of special fees.
In addition, SIG helps bring many entertain
ing speakers to campus, such as Ollie North.
After losing its special fee last year, SIG has
shown sincere efforts to fund raise and
decrease its budget.
Stanford $12,857.14
Jazz Orchestra ($.91)
O YES m NO
Although having a jazz group on campus
definitely adds to the cultural ambiance at
Stanford, the University should fund it
through the Music Department. To its credit,
the Jazz Orchestra has tried to better serve
the graduate population on campus, with
shows at the business school. Moreover, in
response to the rejection of its special fee
request last year, the group has cut funds
which formerly paid for trips and shifted its
funds toward more equipment-based costs.
In the end, however, the Jazz Orchestra
should look for other ways of funding, in par
ticular by applying to the University for funds
or by charging for their shows.
