Rape Elimination
(§> YES O NO
SURE Escort is an indispensable asset to
Stanford, providing rides to those who do not
wish to walk home alone at night. The special
fee mainly pays for the drivers' salaries and
cart services. Recently, the University has
shown increased support for campus safety
and will most likely fund SURE next year. The
Board of Trustees still has to approve the bill,
however; if the University does pay for it, the
group will not take their special fee. However,
without University assistance, the group must
rely on the special fee to fund its valuable ser
vice.
Stanford $5,063.29
Volunteer Network ($.36)
® YES ONO
The SVN serves to promote student ser
vice to Stanford and the surrounding commu
nities. It sponsors several projects including
Reach Out Today, Holiday Sharing Drive,
Community Carnival and the Jefferson/Stan
ford Buddy Program. Their boast in the Elec
tions Handbook that "SVN has grown less
dependent on the Haas Center for its funding
of these projects" shows unclear thought.
SVN should actively pursue alternative forms
of funding to reduce its special fee request as
much as possible. Nevertheless, SVN offers
excellent value for the dollar.

Action at Stanford
® YES O NO
SEAS helps establish environmental
awareness on a generally apathetic campus.
It has worked this year on its dorm-based
Environmental Representative Network, the
quarterly publication of its newsletter the Daily
Planet and a day of service projects for stu
dents to participate in called Earth Action Day.
SEAS is also planning to push the University
to divest from Texaco. Students should be
aware of this relatively unpuDlicized — yet
very political — goal when voting, even
though relatively little of the special fee money
is allotted for this cause. Most of the funds will
pay for honoraria to bring speakers to cam
pus, like this year's Winona LaDuke. Overall,
SEAS has cut its budget significantly after last
year's election defeat.
Stanford $20,343.57
Women's Collective ($1.45)
® YES O NO
The Women's Collective acts as an
umbrella organization, serving both the under
graduate and graduate populations in the
education about and advocacy of women's
issues. It works closely with the Graduate
Women's Network, the African-American
organization Sisters in Stanford and Body
Image, Food, & Self-Esteem. The group pro
vides a dissertation support group and Body
Awareness week, among other programs.
The Collective has actively increased its grad
uate women outreach efforts this year to
increase the number of women who benefit
from its resources. The Collective's main
event — Herstory month — celebrates the
achievements of women around the world by
bringing successful women speakers to cam
pus. The group should beware of alienating
males in its effort to educate about women.
The group could further trim its budget by
printing flyers on less expensive paper, but
generally the Collective serves a worthwhile
function at reasonable cost.

Conference
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
After an overwhelming loss in last year's
election, YCMAD has cut its budget by more
than half. Salaries have been reduced, and
YCMAD has invited Bay Area speakers to fur
ther decrease its costs. In spite of these
impressive financial improvements, a special
fee may not be appropriate for YCMAD. It is
questionable whether all students should pay
for a one-time conference when only one-half
of the 400 or so attendants are Stanford stu
dents. In addition, YCMAD's service-oriented
conference suggests that it should possibly
seek funding from the Haas Center to
decrease its special-fee request. Finally,
YCMAD continues to choose topics which fail
to raise significant student interest (this year's
conference focuses on children).

The Publications Board gives money
to a variety of campus publications; it
desperately needs more money to
update its equipment and increase the
amount of discretionary funding avail
able to student publications. The gener
al-fee structure makes it hard for the
board to increase funding, and students
are usually not willing to vote for an
increase. However, given the expanding
number of publications seeking funds,
students should vote to give the Pub
Board the highest increase possible.
