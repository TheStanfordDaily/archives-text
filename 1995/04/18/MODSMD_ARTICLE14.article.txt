# Affirmative action on trial
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - With affirma
tive action under fresh scrutiny, white men
claiming reverse discrimination emerged
victorious yesterday as opponents' chal
lenges were turned away by the Supreme
Court.
In one case, the justices let stand a lower
court ruling that a plan for promoting black
firefighters in Birmingham, Ala., unlawful
ly discriminated against whites.
And the justices let a white man collect
$425,000 from a Pittsburgh company he
accused of denying him a promotion
because of his race.
In Birmingham, Lt. Charles Brush, pres
ident of the majority white Birmingham
Firefighters Association, said, "We've
always contended this is not a race issue,
it's a fairness issue."
But Lt. Carl Cook, president of the all
black Birmingham Brothers Inc., said affir

mative action "has helped the whites who
have cried and whined .. . because they
have gotten the attention. The squeaky
wheel gets the grease."
The court left intact federal appeals
court decisions in each case.
But yesterday's action came amid grow
ing debate in all three branches of govern
ment over whether affirmative action still is
needed to help minorities — and whether
such aid is fair to non-minorities.
Republican leaders in Congress are seek
ing elimination of most affirmative action.
President Clinton has asked for a review of
the 100-plus federal programs that invoke
affirmative action.
And the high court is expected to
announce a major decision by July on a
white-owned company's challenge to a fed
eral highway program that offers special
help to minority-owned small businesses.
